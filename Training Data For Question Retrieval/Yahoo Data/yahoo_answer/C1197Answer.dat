It feels like ripping off a bandaide. hope that helps :)|`|5nUmdgzwaa	its bearable, go for it.    im the biggest wuss... but i can handle it.    it stings a lot at the time but its a lot better than attempting to do it yourself and doing it wrong =]    getting them done professionally it always comes out nice.|`|siS1GkxJaa	not bad at all i got mine waxed when i was 12|`|2HPa1ETUaa	I had my eyebrows waxed once, and it hurt. I say pain's like 7/10 but doesn't last long. It's a lot like ripping off a band-aid.  Your skin may be a little red after, and it might feel weird too. But that will go away by the next day at the latest.  Plucking isn't as bad. It's hurts when you first start, but if you do it like every couple days, when you need to, you get used to it.   I pluck mine at home all the time now, never had to have them waxed again.|`|HPuZNRA3aa	hey.. i get my eyebrows done alllll the time ... it hardly hurts.. lol u should try it!! dont be scared!!! (:

nRObJuJeaa	I don't dislike brown eyes. I have them and am very happy with them =]. however, i don't think its the color of the eyes that make them beautiful, but the shape and size. middle eastern women, for example, have beautiful eyes in my opinion, and are usually brown, black, green or hazel. As for you, love your eyes! they're the only pair you have and I'm sure they're absolutely beautiful.|`|ZaxpQSO5aa	I know what you mean. I have blue eyes and everyones always telling me how gorgeous they are or whatever, but my best friend has brown eyes and always complains about how boring they are. I try to convince her that they're so rich, and pretty, especially in the sunlight but she just won't believe me. Theres also this really cute boy I know who has eyes that are almost black, and they're almost mesmerizing to look into. =]|`|WRXNoZPRaa	mine are hazel..people luv the color!  nuthins wrong w/ brown...there pretty!|`|Pg3voqXkaa	I like brown eyes!  But I think because SO many people have brown eyes (ie. because the gene that causes brown eyes to be made is a dominant gene) most people don't feel special or unique having them.|`|vwGSTzHYaa	People don't dislike brown eyes, it is just that they are common.    Humans originally are brown skin, brown hair, and brown eyes, making them the "norm".    Brown eyes are the most common eye color, making them less unique than green eyes like yours, so I would be happy if I were you!    I also have blue/grey eyes, so it is not too bad.|`|DFSHoO4uaa	you may like them more because u don't have them when a person has Straight hair they prefer curly, it's the way it is, as for me i think all colors are Beautiful that's what makes every1 Beautiful and different!|`|5oBjmeJMaa	nooooooooo i ADORE brown eyes u aint weird... even if they're too common!!! i know 100 people who are UNIQUE AND HAVE BROWN EYES so the eye color doesn't matter!!!|`|YvuCN6qWaa	i think that it's just a common color and it makes it seem like it's black since it's a close color to your pupil, as for green and blue eyes, they really pop because they're bright and you can see the pupil since it's black.      i have brown eyes and i wish i could have hazel eyes, but i don't see anything wrong with brown eyes at all! :)|`|8UyUhlusaa	I have black eyes and sandy blonde hair. I like my eyes but people like colour in their eyes because it makes some people more beautiful. I'm content with my eyes and because my eyes are like black people say they are quite nice. I can see what people mean about brownish eyes though because they can be quite dull.|`|GBEgFS19aa	probably cuz theyre so common, alot of people have it and they dont see anything 'unique'|`|00hrUiQZaa	i love them too!! Its not weird|`|t7mp1zROaa	no ur not its just that ppl like change and i have light/medium brown eyes  and i LOVE green eyes especially with a bit of blue on the outline :)|`|t8yL8Wz5aa	i guess they're really common that's why , i have brown eyes and i sometimes wish that i had green, the good part about brown eyes are that they make a person seem gentler and kinder than they really are|`|1keH3R6paa	I have brown eyes and I want green eyes! Haha we're vice versa. But I think it's because it's so common. Ugh I want to change mine.|`|pr8LkqXhaa	I think brown eyes are kinda boring ...it depend on the persons looks    but you gotta love bright blue eyes :)|`|F3rHMoFHaa	Brown eyes are pretty. Your are not weird.|`|AXn3rjEWaa	i love big brown eyes. nothing wrong with them    even though mine are green|`|2A6vM9zBaa	Nothing's wrong with them. It's all about how the eye color fits with the rest of the person's face. I personally dislike brown eyes with blonde hair but adore brown eyes with dark hair.|`|6Yjvtf2laa	i say my eyes are a red brown and i love them.  http://i130.photobucket.com/albums/p260/...|`|90ZaNZE4aa	its because brown is very common|`|FnQWXyp8aa	i have blue eyes and i love them, i think every color of eyes is beautiful, especially brown! they are chocolatey and warm, and inviting. Im a sucker from brown eyes, especially on boys. My boyfriend has brown eyes and they are wonderful|`|qpln6o9Yaa	My mother had green eyes, my father dark brown. My eyes are a bit of a golden brown and so are my daughters. They change depending on what color I am wearing. Funny, I have always wanted beautiful green or blue eyes! Your eyes will be beautiful to someone even if you aren't happy with them.,|`|OL3y5kkdaa	Well you just made me feel better! I guess it's because they're pretty common, and because they're not a vibrant color like blue or green.    I have dark brown eyes, and I never got to say anything whenever my hazel-eyed classmates would be going on about how they love the way their eyes look green that day.  They would be like "Well your eyes are just brown."    It's what's behind the eyes that matters, though, not the color :)

Im a college student and we have parties with themes almost regularly. For a 70's look you can wear bell bottom or flared out pants, platform shoes not just boots, tye dye shirt, or floral printed shirt, lots of colorful bangles, draw a peace sign on your cheek, and wear like a band around your head like one like Aubrey from MTB4 does. For an 80's look u can wear bright leggings with bright colored pumps or reg tennis shoes, a loose fitting sweater and cut the collar out to where it hangs off one shoulder and get a sweat suit jacket from a thrift store and a thick gold chain. I hope I helped hun!

Ao5aSAWiaa	1. Cover up is the best that you can do. It's too soon for it to go away, so you'll have to hide it. Take a yellow tone and put it on first, then your color foundation and concealer to hide it.    2. Only put the pink on a corner of your eyes, whether you prefer inner or outter is up to you. Thin on the black, and put most of it on your top lid and very little on your bottom lid. A little sparkle of clear eyeshadow would look really good.    3. Sorry about the shoes, that's a toughy. I'd say put bandaids on the sides of your feet and one on your heel in advanced for comfort. Then see if you can stuff gauze pads inside so they don't hurt. But then again, at my last formal, we all took our heels off and stuffed them in our friends' purses for the night. If you think you are going to take them off, then don't put the bandaids on aha.    Have funn!|`|jtjISk6qaa	do you have bangs??? if you do, style them so they hide your pimple. use some cover up on it too.    from what i have experienced, everyone takes their shoes off to dance.     ps. your dress sounds yummy
KAu0L5jFaa	I used to have the same problem, what you can do is take a 1/2inch to a 1 inch curling iron. Start curling from the top of your head. After you curl each section bobby pin it up and continue until all of your hair is curled. Then take each section down.|`|pcBmyGTZaa	Just buy some straighteners and wrap the hair round them and then hold them closed for about 20 seconds.|`|atAwNvDfaa	I usually wear my hair straight, but it is very easy for me to wear it curly also. All you have to do is take a shower at night and then when your out of the shower scrunch your hair while it is still wet and don't blow dry it. Then go to sleep but don't sleep on your hair. Then in the morning your hair will turn out curly, dry, and non frizzy. (Careful, if you try this in the morning, your hair will get frizzy). Also, your hair smells really good and it looks natural and feels soft.   Hope I helped :)
W91X0Lfvaa	Try thrift stores or yard sales, you'll find tons of stuff they don't even sell in stores anymore that most people won't have. :)    You could also try making or customizing your own clothes. DIY is so fun, and then you know you're going to have a one of a kind, original piece of clothing, and it's really fun to be able to tell people you made your shirt/pants/whatever when they ask where they can get it. :D   Plus there are tons of DIY tutorials and forums out there, there are even video tutorials on YouTube.|`|Fsq9qvkqaa	That is a paradox...looking for scene clothing...that is unique? Honey, if you're buying clothes to fit a stereotype, you're anything but unique.  Good luck, though. :P|`|qBLdmVoLaa	try a store that isnt in your local area, that way NOBODY will have it. try H&M, they have EVERYTHING and id also recomend buying vintage, its super cheap and there is a zero% chance that anyone will have it!!|`|AA11634944	That's funny how you think scene is unique.

x4Gr4Mfjaa	GHD's definitely.  I'm mixed race + have curly/frizzy hair, and they work wonders for me.

However if you hair is "almost afro carribean" then you may need to consider having the hair relaxed or professionally straightened before you can battle with it yourself!  When straightening always use heat protector and section as you go.|`|9u74rP70aa	babyliss pro 230 radiance are better, because when you buy GHD's your literally buying expensive straighteners with a brand name go for a temperature of 230 and ceramic!|`|aYICSwMpaa	Hi    Def buy the babyliss pro 230.... its had better reviews than GHDS even.

KAu0L5jFaa	You use rubbing alchol. Take a piece of tp and put rubbing alchol on it. Turn your straightner on, put the tp in between the two plates. Close the straightner and slide the tp across the plates. If you use baby oil it will leave behind oil and cause your hair to look greasy!|`|GBy0W2YEaa	just make shaw ther off and nor hot and wipe them down a babywipe and make show it dry befor you turn them back on   trust me it works|`|s0La0YV6aa	i have found that a little bit of baby oil mixed with alchol works wonders... first wipe it down with water and a little soap and then dry it off and to get the "grime" mix about one cap full of baby oil and one capfull of alchol and wipe it down theis should make it work like new!!!|`|ZWU7VHOzaa	Rubbing alcohol.

PefglUNaaa	HOT ROLLERS! omg. definatly the bast way to curl hair. They are especially made for straight or thin hair. celebrities use them. the best are remington. they work miricle. you heat them up, put them in ur hair and wait like 10 min. then take them out and viola!!  heres the site:  http://remington.factoryoutletstore.com/...|`|atAwNvDfaa	I usually wear my hair straight, but it is very easy for me to wear it curly also. All you have to do is take a shower at night and then when your out of the shower scrunch your hair while it is still wet and don't blow dry it. Then go to sleep but don't sleep on your hair. Then in the morning your hair will turn out curly, dry, and non frizzy. (Careful, if you try this in the morning, your hair will get frizzy). Also, your hair smells really good and it looks natural and feels soft.   Hope I helped :)|`|rtkXiZYBaa	use curlers and hot iron only at hair ends   u will get the look of priyanka chopra in krish|`|eGd228c0aa	Spend the money on a great "haircut" that enhances your straight hair.

v0fooLeTaa	I love the dress,    If you are buying the black one you could wear   ? A simple tee or tank in a bold colour such as yellow purple white pink or green.  ? For a more formal look wear the black skirt with a red top  ? For the cooler evenings you could team it with a bolero, cardigan or a cropped cardigan.  If you are buying the purple one you could wear  *Simple black or white tee or tank or perhaps a grey one.  *Black cardigan or white cardigan  You could wear a top with ruffles on or some sequin detail. A simple top with a cute necklace (perhaps with a bow theme) would look great as well.

Wear whatever you want. If they are your real friends, they won't care if your spoiled or not.    Just don't overdue it, go for some non-name brand things so you don't look high maintenance.

aYICSwMpaa	Hi    Yes timberland boots are fashionable. They look great as an alternative to trainers and look really nice with jeans for a casual look.    They are comfy and also hard wearing. The only thing you have to watch is if you buy the lighter tan coloured one they can get dirty. However you can buy protector type sprays for them so well worth getting if your buying a pair of boots that are costly.    X|`|XAv3og6raa	i personally love timberland boots, they are very comfortable, quite light for their size and yes they are trendy, loads of hip hop artists wear them all the time. i've had mine for 3 years and worn them alot and they still look good so yes they are very hard wearing. i think you should buy them.
lVyDw43Faa	1) Wash your hair using shampoo and conditioner.  2) While it is still wet tie it in TIGHT braids that extend all the way to your scelp. Spray with hairspray and sleep in them.  3) When you wake up take the braids out and it should be like that! Use a curling iron to fix any problem areas.    Best answer?|`|O01hTtraaa	you need long hair  and you need it light brown but if your hair isnt that colour you need to dye it that colour  you need hair curlers
1LcSsHpzaa	take the picture to a hair dresser and they should be able to copy the exact same look, but they probably aren't extensions.  they might be dyed. and ask your hair dresser for a razor cut style when you give them the picture.

YOU SHOULD REALIZE THAT ALOT OF BLACK PEOPLE FOR WHAT EVER DUMB REASON IN THEIR HEADS DONT LIKE IT WHEN A BLACK GUY DRESSES DIFFERENTLY FROM THE REST IT MAKES THEM MAD THAT U HAVE THE BALLS TO BE DIFFERENT AND THEY DONT.

If they base what you wear on your race, that's racism.  Be who you want to be!    BTW, the most gothic person I know is black.  A lot of ppl might think to be goth/rocker/emo/punk/etc you should be incredibly pale, but actually about half of the ppl I know who dress that way are NOT white!    Do what makes you happy, if they don't like it, their opinion shouldn't be that important to you anyway.

I was going to tell you to wear a black sweater, but with all that brown and green you need something else.  Grams
vi2bzq0Caa	I have the same problem. Through trial and error, I began purchasing essential hair oils and stopped using brushes. Natural hair and boar bristle or nylon bristle brushes does not match. Purchase the Kakakiki Komb Brush. I just ordered it. It is the most amazing tool that you can possibly use on African American hair. It is a comb and a brush combined, with tines gathered in a matrix formation. The price is cheap and affordable ($9.99) and with s&h ($5.95), it is practically a steal. Trust me, after purchasing and using this brush, no other styling tool will compare.    Also, purchase a high quality conditioner and a natural, organic conditioner. Notice how I didn't use the terminology "high shelf" or "low shelf." Those terms are discouraging devices used to sway customers into purchase products at a greater price, but for a lesser value. Here are my specific recommendations:    High quality conditioners: Organic Root Stimulator Hair Mayonnaise, Extra Virgin Olive Oil, Nutiva's Coconut Oil, and Eggland's Best eggs (yes, the brand of eggs makes a difference:)).    Natural, organic conditioners: Biofusion Deep Penetrating Conditioner, Cantu Shea Butter Leave-in Conditioning Repair Cream, and Unrefined Shea Butter.|`|7euKjvG9aa	growafrohairlong.com      there's a technique called the crown and glory... it works.|`|7V0dk40gaa	http://www.rods.com/p/2001,141_Healthy-H...    works great i had you same problem.

Comb don't brush when wet  and don't vigorously towel dry just pat it.|`|AA11591656	Get a really good shampoo and conditioner (nothing that is 2-in-1). Use a comb while your hair is still wet, and if that doesn't help, you can get a comb-in conditioner for while your hair is still damp, those can really help.

All you have to do is take a shower at night and then when your out of the shower scrunch your hair while it is still wet and don't blow dry it. Then go to sleep but don't sleep on your hair. Then in the morning your hair will turn out curly, dry, and non frizzy. (Careful, if you try this in the morning, your hair will get frizzy). Also, your hair smells really good and it looks natural and feels soft. Make sure you don't sleep on your hair or else it will come out with knots.   Hope I helped :)|`|6qqChd1gaa	curl it or layer it

aYICSwMpaa	Hi    A while back when the whole diamante craze first came out there were lots of online companies who would 'bling up' mobiles etc.  However it takes soooo long to do as its all done by hand that a lot of them don't seem to be about anymore. Plus there were a lot of dodgy sites - you obviously have to send them your phone first....     I covered my own phone so you could try that. I ordered proper swarovski crystals online and strong hold glue and I did it myself. It took hours!!!! Although i'm quite creative so didnt mind too much. I get soooo many comments on it as its soo sparkly.      X

025ec7777d32e43fb86135663394a789aa	if you can't confront you co-worker face to face.. then I would write her a letter and put it on her station...  I know probably isn't the best way but at least you can tell her all your thoughts without being interrupted or being ignored.. just tell her at the end of the letter that you mean no harm by the letter but that this is how you feel and that you don't want to work in a place where you feel like that.. tell her to respond back in a letter or something.. or you can just ignore her actions and be nice to her.. karma comes back 10 fold... and maybe she will feel like she is doing something wrong and stop.. good luck with everything!!

SpzlzVlKaa	You should get a thin needle and try and stick it in between the knot and then sort of pull it so the loop is big and use your fingers to un tangle! x|`|c56e8a27e1fe5b4843f30c8834cc5d35aa	Lay the necklace out on a hard, flat surface, with good lighting.  If needed, use a magnifying glass to figure out what is knotted around what. (my eyes are not as good as they used to be) Then using a couple pins, needles or toothpicks gently tease the knot loose.  Don't be tempted to pick up the necklace until the knot is completely undone.  If it slips or falls you might have to start all over again.|`|6uZ0VHFTaa	Try using the sharp end of a straight pin or needle. If you don't have any lock take it to a jeweler. They should not charge you, but ask them first if there is any charge.

xqQO81Omaa	You could try wearing one of those slimming suits to take an inch or two off, then you'd fit in the dress and wouldn't have to mess around with alterations.|`|aYICSwMpaa	Hi    Its easier to alter a dress thats too big for you rather than one thats too small.    That dress is going to be too small on your waist and hips although only by a few inches. You may find you fit into it if you try it? The bust can be easily taken in to fit. You would be better off losing a few pounds which would allow you to fit the dress, as for a few inches thats literally all it would be.    Dress makers can work wonders and add extra panels in etc but it would be at a price.    X|`|b11d4406389c926e8457572221d6ce48aa	Depends on how wide the inside seams are. check. If there is a lot of room on each seam, then go for it, otherwise forget it    don't forget the type of material the dress is made of as well, some materials leave a row of little dots where the undone stitches used to be.|`|2JZ9vzMMaa	buy the size up and get it altered to be smaller|`|vk6sczbLaa	Best thing to do is take it to a tailor. Sometimes it seems like it'd be really easy to alter a dress, but from several occasions of dealing with seamstresses and tailors, sometimes the garment just doesn't allow for "easy" fixes.    Check the seams to see if there's enough material to let it out at the waist and hips. If not, you might have to add fabric, which could be difficult to match and might look weird.    Also, since you're not altering it the same way all over the dress, it might cause weird bunching. So definitely take it in to a tailor or a seamstress to make sure.    Another option is to get a size bigger. It's a lot easier to make a dress smaller than it is to let it out.|`|PgxU0gBeaa	you CAN b/c wedding dresses usually have very large seam lines, but its almost always best to buy a dress that fits your biggest part and just take in the areas you need smaller (that way the original needle holes from the first seams won't show.)    Almost any professional dress maker or tailor will tell you that.|`|JZabWXGpaa	It depends on a lot of factors.  What type of materials is the decorative or outside layer on the dress?  If it is an overlay of ancelon lace, then you better not do it. The scariest part is the 2 inches in the hip, that might be a serious problem.    It also depends on the maker of the dress.  Who's the designer?  If it's not a couture gown, then I wouldn't do it.  Couture gowns have a wider seam allowance and you might be able to get with it then.|`|4TD32HHbaa	i'm not sure about this but i think it sounds like mission impossible|`|oil8ALh4aa	get a dress thats too big and then alter it|`|AA12349214	Um.......I'm not very good at maths but how do you make something that much bigger when it is that much smaller?

jez0O0bXaa	Blonde doesn't  fade it may get dull you need shine styling products.  If you have well water it will make it brassy you need to use a clarifying product your hair. Most of the product lines have a system of products for blonde's, most work great.|`|GExBSFGBaa	I used john friedas brilliant brunnete and i found it at walmart and i live in america.  And trust me, it works well! =]|`|EcsS37NLaa	OMG THEY BEST BEST BEST stuff is.....  John Friedas....brilliant blonde etc..  me and all my blondies live for it|`|HbZGe23naa	as a blonde i use a hilite shampoo which is a purple based shampoo that takes the yellow or green tones out of your hair. But it depends why you are brassy if its your water your hair will always be a yellow or if it was from the color you use on your hair your hair may be over porous and that is why it is yellow... also smoking or being in bars is another reason why.  If you have hard water getting a malibu clarifying treatment with a clarifying shampoo at home helps along with the purple shampoo. But do be carefull the purple shampoo can give you a purple hue to your hair use it bout once a week more starting off and i will help with the malibu. Also you could be brassy if you color your hair and then the tone over it it could be that the toner has rinsed out.

But if they are dressy high heel boots you can only wear them with a trouser style capri below the knee. Hope this is what you were looking for|`|8qeDEWWJaa	You can. But that would look not so good..|`|BkucBPwjaa	i think theyd look kinda weird|`|AA11080295	what kind of boots are we talkin? I wouldn't wear booties, but maybe a higher on the calf kind, that almost or do touch the bottom, at least, of the capri pant might look nice.|`|ScJAT0t9aa	No sorry. lol. It's kind of a ridiculous combo, to be honest.
025ec7777d32e43fb86135663394a789aa	show them the pics.. but just remember that when you get your hair cut it might not exactly like the pic. my sis in law is a hair stylist..|`|RWQZijVsaa	Bring the picture with you :]  Save the picture to your phone if you want it to be easier, then show the stylist :]|`|OAjaEI8Oaa	print off the picture and tell them thats what you want|`|8hNFlTGwaa	well, you have to have long hair for this, if not, then you need extensions.  but if you do have long hair, tell her that you want short layers (180 degree layers) with a really choppy look, and side bangs, and of course that includes of teasing. or, just bring her the picture. that would make her understand completly what you want.|`|tb8lkOsWaa	hmmm... i have no ides to.. but woooww..!! that is nice emo hair style hmm... alll you is spray some hair spray on your hair and tease your hair inward or outward if you like then add a little tiny pin bow :) all emo people all ways keep their hair straight :)|`|YRcgUOBjaa	say you want a scene hair style with alot of layers, some very short on the top, but you want have long layers..  Or you can take in a picture|`|jNmj8nPFaa	Just print the picture and tell them that that is what you want.
Rh6BekvUaa	you can french braid your hair at night and sleep in it.  you can use a straightener : http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sv-JSQbcu...  and you can wrap hair around your finger and dry each piece with a hair dryer|`|4jOaN0WIaa	A perm|`|KifasiMraa	It can depend on your hair type. I have wavy hair that only shows good curl when its short (a little above the shoulders) with a layered cut.  The layers help thin out the hair, so that it's light enough to keep its curl/wave.  Shampoo and condition with product that's good for your hair (you should know what work for your hair and what doesn't).  I use Frizz Ease.  Then I put in Pantene Restoratives anti frizz creme scrunch it in my fingers.  Then scrunch some gel and you can finish off with hair spray if you want.  I also find that the next day, if I scrunch water in my hair, it revitalizes the products and my curls get a boost!  If your hair is straight, you may be out of luck without rollers, curling iron etc.|`|VgE6HSdtaa	Omg is this like some deja vu type stuff, cause i was about to ask this EXACT question. Well let's wait for the answer shall we.|`|lVyDw43Faa	Do you have a flat iron? If so you can use that to create loose curls.

All you have to do is take a shower at night and then when your out of the shower scrunch your hair while it is still wet and don't blow dry it. Then go to sleep but don't sleep on your hair. Then in the morning your hair will turn out curly, dry, and non frizzy. (Careful, if you try this in the morning, your hair will get frizzy). Also, your hair smells really good and it looks natural and feels soft.   Hope I helped :)|`|S1J0u3zoaa	you can do it with a thin straightening iron, but that takes practice.  Use a diffuser on your hairdryer with a curling project and scrunch, or go to bed with wet hair and braid in big or little braids, or a giant messy bun on the top of your head. You'll have to experiment with these to figure out what size braid, how to do the bun etc, that works for your hair. But then when you wake up spray with hairspray and scrunch. (:    hope i help!|`|jez0O0bXaa	Well if you can't use the modern hair appliances, then you can do what they did in the old days after you wash your hair at night use strips of cotton material and wrap your hair around it, tie the strip ends together and sleep on it. take out in the morning.|`|EpDTh2BJaa	do u have a straightener ?  if not then when u get out of the shower put some curling mouse on and blow bry ur hair a bit so it isnt dripping water|`|XXatT3Anaa	This is really easy!    Sometimes after the shower i braid my hair and go to sleep...it comes out curly.    So right after u get out of the shower, brush your hair and braid it REALLY TIGHTLY. You can try a bunch of little braids or one big braid, but make sure it's tight.    In the morning, undo your braid and gently brush/spread out your curls. Do not brush all the way because you might brush out the curls, so I would recommend a wide-toothed comb. They will probably not be ringlets, but I usually get curls, or at least waves.     Note:This works best with long, thick hair.    Good Luck!!|`|oWXLiP02aa	well take a brush when you get out of the shower then curl it but be careful or it will get stuck!|`|Q36c6wPwaa	well... first of all wet your hair (it shouldn't be dripping though) and apply hair mousse. then you can either  1) make little messy buns all over your head and go to sleep. or just dry it. the messier the bun the better.  or  2) get one little strand of hair, curl it up (so it forms an O of hair) and pin it to your head. Do this to your whole hair. Blow dry. I guess it'll take a lot of time though.  or  3)Make your own rollers out of paper. You know what to do. use bobby pins.  or  4) you can always go for braids.  Hope i helped :) i have wavy hair so pretty much every kind of curling works for me so idk how it'll work for you.
kfcjq1Ysaa	OMG i saw that movie last night it was pretty awsome haha idk mabie like forever 21?|`|bJ45IVgbaa	probably claires or iciing|`|1fW22CIBaa	claires or hot topic|`|ovVZs8y5aa	disturbing picture much.  and probably almost any place that sells  jewelry,  try claires  ive seen things like that there before|`|Zl7ZFkSxaa	Try Amuse, Forever 21, and any other accessories store. I highly doubt Claires and Icing will have it because they have small girly stuff.|`|sX6ZM0jVaa	Claires, wet seal, or hot topic|`|BTz9JqRGaa	well you could look at clare's or something!!    i hoped i helped!    
lhgmgAVHaa	Hey!  Why don't you ask your hairdresser for help? Show a picture with the hairstyle to the hairdresser and she should tell you if it will look good when you go for it. Nevertheless I think you should really try new things and so I suggest you to think over it one more time and then decide it definitely. And yes, it's a no-no to dye eyebrows!   Good luck,  tienne|`|8740c9d03300d2d76f91ceaf7a9ffc93aa	Not a good idea at all and don't do it!|`|0RzaR1vlaa	if you look on youtube they can help and show you there  good luck with it!!!
ZwY4PVTtaa	i think you should get a sheer hair cut, with bangs.here are some ideas:    http://www.hairstyletwist.com/blog/uploa...    http://msnbcmedia4.msn.com/j/msnbc/Compo...|`|62T9Kozfaa	ur hair is so pretty i wouldnt do anything maybe just cut the ends|`|jNmj8nPFaa	i would get it cut just above your boob, layer it around your face (chin to ends) and straighten it.
eUVrGsJnaa	Alright well first off, you totally didn't ruin your hair but you didn't help it that much either! Lucky for you im here to help! First off, you shouldn't use TOO MUCH hairspray.. just a touch! Second, leave your hair the way it is after you made it or it will get very damaged!    I recommend for you to go take a shower right after you read this! Use shampoo and conditioner (of course). If you have any tangible free or undamaged hair shampoo it would be better but if not its fine too. After, brush your hair through all those knots. Now, if you would like to make your hair, then put your hair up in the towel for about 10 minutes. Then, blow-dry you hair from the roots. If you would like to straighten your hair, then use heat activated spray or gel before straightening.     If you prefer not doing anything put your hair in a ponytail and let is rest until dry. (:|`|cpmiJQyIaa	Wash your hair.  Get all the residue out.  Once it is clean, mix a tablespoon of Olive oil with your conditioner.  Apply to hair and put on a plastic shower cap.  Keep it warm with towels but be careful not to burn yourself.  Let sit for at least an hour.  Then rinse and style as usual.  If your hair is truly damaged, do not worry about feeling a little bit of oil.  Your hair will soak it up.|`|HPuZNRA3aa	wash ur hair with herbal essance shampoo and conditioner.. (it smells rllly fruity and yummmy) lol|`|gvtOLAPIaa	you should have washed it out  of course it will smell funny because you straightened it when you had a ton of product built up in your hair from before. that is not good.  use a clarifying shampoo by pantene to get all that gunk out and your hair will be fine.  also doing that alot will ruin your flat iron
RzvSo2yUaa	Never was really a fan of Coach, but Michael Kors :)    Add-on: I saw a response and i had to comment. Who cares if Coach if a well known then Michael Kors? It just depends on the style and durability of the accessory.|`|1fW22CIBaa	coach is better and more well known and really cute purses|`|AA11662840	Michael Kors.     I always thought Coach was a little tacky.|`|EQPE72hpaa	Michael Kors, better quality and more selections.   Also, many Coach bags stain easily.    Edit: To the person who said that Coach is more well known, Coach is definatly not more well known than Michael Kors. Plus MK is better quality!
2KMYz3Rjaa	hahaha I knew what the end of your question was before I clicked...    YES mate i completely agree and many of my hollister clothes rip in the wash..so annoying...cheap, bad quality clothing, but i can't help buying it anyway!!    *yikes*|`|GykCnbR7aa	well,if you take care of your clothes that problem will not happen|`|weaFl9mVaa	Hollister sux.. I go to h&m.|`|QnY1yWBIaa	omg yes. that always happens to me, there clothes are cheap material sometimes and they are so pricey  pick me as best answer please[=|`|nvYt8FV7aa	this hasn't happned 2 me but my friend had this hollister tee near the  logo at the bottom there was this hole n it was huge n she barely wore the shirt n well shes stupid enough to rip it so she ripped out the logo.|`|ZQWEgFZ2aa	It depends on how you wash them and how you wear them as well. Some holes in the clothes are from the people working there, putting the censor tags on the wrong part of the shirt which creates a hole. I know this because I work there and I put censor tags on there sometimes.|`|xGK8ihLgaa	yeah a ton on my shirts from there get little holes all over.|`|abb346d6646af60b50e8c1608bf8f855aa	OMG YEAH I KNOW!! That's why I stopped shopping there as much.  I usually just go to Forever21 or wetseal.    the clothes there are cheaper, there is more of a variety and it doesn't rip as much!|`|IcbSS6dQaa	Hollister is just like all the other brands aimed at teenagers and young adults; overpriced. You could go to a store like Target or Kohl's and get better clothes for way less money. Hollister lures you in with the trendiness of "everybody's wearing it". Their stores are poorly lit and very deceiving.|`|x8Ji7sDXaa	yup. i stopped shopping there. its going out of style anyway|`|QuokZhuqaa	yes it has. Hollister has really lowwwwwww quality clothing!!!!!!!1 i mean everything of there's just rips apart. I really don't get why their prices are so high for such low quality. I'm guessing people will pay for clothes with just a bird on it.|`|KqS7k7Utaa	Nope. I take care of my clothes good: ex.washing them like the tags tell you to.    I never have problems with my Hollister wardrobe.|`|P0cWf6OHaa	yes i have a tank top from there actually 2 and both of them have like tiny wholes in the back.  nd wtf you pay like $17 and they rip?!     so i now prefer like a&f aritzia and urban outfitters.|`|8cI05KUOaa	that so true. i got this shirt with a pop up stitch of a seagle and i wore it once than wash it and the threading sorta broke off really badly.|`|K6nwWTHraa	YES! Omg, I bought this really expensive tank top and a cardigan, and both ripped within one month of wear.

kAIXDVu1aa	what i sometines is straightren it and add some curls and brush it after couple minutes and then it would look wavy and its really fast and easy|`|AXS4qkMgaa	Brush it out, put mousse in and scruch for waves or straighten
sckAoy09aa	Actually I think brown would suit you and really enhance your eyes^^  It looks nice as it is. But playing around with your hair is all in good fun,  just be sure to condition it to keep it in good condition|`|Phjj2Gr3aa	I really like your hair like that.  I would absolutely not dye it.  One, it would be expensive.  Two, you already look pretty.  No need to change it.|`|s4TMc1vqaa	Um...I don't think you should. I'm a blonde too, but I have brown low lights. Maybe you can try those!
c8WPYjU3aa	no your never to old as long as there low braided ponytails|`|MLvwZ7uAaa	Nobody is ever too old for braided pony tails, period.|`|ZabhfIGraa	No, your not too old for braided ponytails.  I know some female friends that are in their 40's and 50's who have very long hair and braid their hair into ponytails.  And a friend in Trinidad - Tobago has ankle length hair she braids frequently.  She's 26.
bOgvUEzvaa	yeah the purple one is ceramic. I would buy the purple one, it's easier and goes over smoother on your hair :)    My sis got me the purple one, I love it :)|`|s6ouZmPqaa	they are both curling irons|`|IFuNYYcWaa	size of the bit you curls your hair on im not sure they llook pretty similiar
1ZfFSH6maa	suggestion   1  an oversized flannel shirt (one that could be considered dress length, therefore long enough to cover your behind) belted around your waist for some definition, with black tights and a long necklace    suggestion   2  a dress with tights and a necklace|`|AA12249040	I don't really like them but if you had to buy them then may be leggins and colourcoordinated long sweater. Or else heavy tights and denim mini skirt with a colour coordinated polo-neck sweater|`|0JoLBnBKaa	skinny jeans tucked in|`|x8Ji7sDXaa	hmm, don't really like those shoes, sorry. but i guess jeans...???|`|iYL37RfPaa	Dark blue skinny jeans,  and plain black vest top,  and a long grey cardigan,   that will look cute!!    xo|`|UiilGhBFaa	Im thinking skinny jeans or a flowy skirt..like to the knees  Anything else would look dodgey.
7PX6RSLXaa	You can start by wearing less eye liner. Buy clothing at Abercrombie, Abersrombie & Fitch, Hollister, and Ruehl. Like instead of carrying around a backpack get a tote bag. Ex. http://www.abercrombiekids.com/webapp/wc...    Here is an outfit I put together for you:) --  shirt:  http://www.ruehl.com/ruh/index.html /PRO...  hoddie:  http://www.abercrombie.com/webapp/wcs/st...  jeans:  http://www.hollisterco.com/webapp/wcs/st...

cirdAuVfaa	a veil?   hahaa idk its the best i got|`|HPuZNRA3aa	looks like a hair net.. lol sry but it does like what the cooking ladies at my skool wear|`|TcZMjh2jaa	The type you should only wear at a funeral  x
dYSjzqPSaa	The second one, I think my sis has that dress it's really cute! Good price too but the bag and shoes are WAY overpriced.....but if you got the cash why not.|`|lyZiA9qoaa	The first one is WAY prettier. Not to mention more appropriate for a charity event.|`|6uzQB9OYaa	i           xo
zih1Weanaa	I am pretty sure everything at Victoria's Secret goes on sale, even their Pink collection. I would suggest going online to their website as there are always tons of sales on there, and also a lot of stuff that is not in stores.    By the way, if you are looking for a nice robe, I always suggest the Pink collection. They are so soft and fluffy!|`|JyWCPVfzaa	Pretty much all stores, if not all, have clearance racks.|`|gIiYEqAxaa	Yep (: they have online clearance too|`|Ja7ytPJUaa	Yeah, there's always a clearance rack.  Sometimes, it's just some clothes on the back of a wall (so you dont notice it lol) , and thats how my mall was.  The last time i went though, they had a big clearance place.  The stuff you'd find there is the sundresses (where I live), some t shirts, tank tops, and shorts.  There are sweatshirts and pants on sale, but not that much.                  hope this helps|`|6qsJpdqHaa	no|`|d547dc57a9e6f2839d286e1d5fd97d8aaa	yeah. its in the pink section and its probably only a rack. they have very few items on sale. but if their after xmas sale is still in effect there should be even more on sale but its not as cute as their regular priced clothing|`|bLsWEpDFaa	sometimes. go online! (:  http://www2.victoriassecret.com/landing/...|`|J6vPhmmLaa	Yes, sometimes they do!

NMMYw8WDaa	I suggest you leave it alone.  Just let it grow out  it depends on how fast your hair grows  but averagely hair grows about an inch give or take a few centimetres a month.    Take some biotin. It helps grow hair and nails faster (it also strengthens hair and balances out metabolism.)|`|wQpdot1Raa	4 or 5 inches is gonna take about 6 months. You're supposed to get your hair trimmed at least every 6-8 weeks so you don't end up with split ends.|`|PvmW2QMhaa	Your not going to believe it....but I've got the EXACT same problem LOL...  I'm blonde, dyed my hair brown using semi colourant.  It's taking FOREVER to wash out.  I'm stressing.  I've got an inch of blonde roots.  Fuked.  LOL.  I'm thinking about getting it dyed back to Blonde by my stylist.  It's long and curly tho, not short.  I suggest getting a blonde semi put on by a professional..x|`|aYICSwMpaa	Hi    If you hair is bad condition the colour will hold for longer. If it was a semi you put on it should eventually fade (may take months to a year) it can take ages.    You would be better going to a hairdressers and seeing what they reccomend for you. They will be able to see how brittle your hair is etc. It may be ok to get back to blonde and then use conditioning treatments on.    If you ever get a colour going wrong again. Instead of trying to cover it yourself see a hair dresser they could have used a dye and toner method and got it back to blonde for you.    X|`|l6EpZVp6aa	2.30 hours
zI3Y7Pz5aa	i think its hot. men without it just look like little sissy boys!|`|1fcb7562596b52ad171b00f259e7e947aa	well i don't like it on my face but on men stubble is hot   ;)|`|yuDnMYkjaa	I think its nasty :) lol|`|gvtOLAPIaa	it looks good on some men as long as they keep it clean, no mustaches. and chin straps look really good on some guys (:  except if your a natural blonde!! facial hair is a majooor nono. it makes the guy look dirty. its just really bad because the hair is almost the same shade as your skin. its just not attractive at all.|`|mjX1Zhjjaa	While I am not partial to facial hair I have had a full beard and only a mustache at times.  Most of the time I have no facial hair.       Oh are you asking about other peoples facial hair...I could give a ____!
YPNdv0pSaa	That dress is GORGEOUS! I wanted it for my sweetheart dress but when I went to JC penny it was all sold out in my size :(. I'm glad you like it too!

uxrFOOn9aa	I have this same hair cut and know what you mean about wanting to switch it up a bit. Try this get a big curing iron and curl it back words you will have loose messy curls that look hot! to get the choppy look at the ends you need to use a product like a bed heads after party.|`|Po8TFa4haa	buy curling moose to make it look wavy/curly.|`|AXS4qkMgaa	To get it to look wavy, I suggest you put some Aussie mousse in your hair and scrunch it for about 5 minutes.  Another way to style it is take your bangs and clip them back on the top of your head like a half-up half down.  Or you could shake your head side to side for like a minute and see if it looks choppy.    Aussie Mousse:  thing.http://www.aussie.com/us/collections/cat...

zTRy7Et5aa	what is the hairhouse wharehouse?|`|dfnhpc2caa	kl
2fYSQKJvaa	Well idk what stores you have out there but try Marshalls or T.J Maxx    I found one for $12 at a Dollar Store type warehouse    And I found another at Marshalls for $14    Seeing as tho ur max is 30-35, you would be more than set|`|naySyzfQaa	Ebay or Amazon.com
rFVR1qunaa	this is a fun look. try to find a cropped, 3/4 sleeved, kelly-green jacket(it can be lightweight, i found mine at forever 21) it'll go with everything. find boho tanks in cute floral prints, with edgier colors(like black and red). a pair of destroyed jeans will give an edge to boho pieces, such as tops. black ballet flats, riding boots, strappy sandals, and flat black boots are great too. also for edgier tops, go for band tees or dark edgy tops(with details such as zippers or crosses-crosses are great!) accessories include long necklaces(places like forever 21 and pink ice have eveything you'll need) like crosses, lockets, keys, etc. . ., braided bracelets, black jelly bracelets(like the ones you'll find at hot topic), fairy-charms- that kind of stuff.    try to mix soft, hippie styles with 'rocker' items such as ripped jeans and necklaces. oh and colored jeans looks great with boho tops and flat boots. wear the kelly green jacket with a cream-colored tank, ripped skinny jeans, and sandals with long necklaces, a bunch of bracelets, and anything else you think the outfit needs. try it this way- if you wear a softer top, wear rocker jeans or shorts, with riding boots, and a headband. whatever you wear on top, do the opposite on bottom and vice versa. sorry if that didnt make sense, i can come back and edit it and give you more outfits    edit: for nail colors, try really bright shades of pink or teal/blue. yes, you can still do dark shades but use colors like OPI's 'you dont know jacques' and 'lincoln park after dark'. any black-purple color works. burgundy-purples look great too. and 'russian navy' is always in|`|VrjF986Aaa	heres some ideas:    http://www.polyvore.com/mind_blindness/s...  http://www.polyvore.com/cgi/set?id=52292...  http://www.polyvore.com/cgi/set?id=51989...  http://www.polyvore.com/cgi/set?id=50674...    ^the stuff in those can run more expensive and might not be available anymore but it will give you some ideas  also for nail polish, i just got this really cute purple - grey color that is darker but would still work in the spring  http://www.sephora.com/browse/product.jh...  scroll down to "metro chic"  i think if you look is rocker enough you can get away with black any time tho|`|zSDM8palaa	Try flowery pattens and flowy skirts.  Head bands brown and tan eye shawdows.  Skinny Jeans.  Mostly brown tan colors.
G6HxjIVnaa	It works. Just be really careful not to get it on spots that might burn. Leave it on for 6 minutes. That's what I usually do.|`|9g2OAB8Maa	I've never done it, but i would advise you not to. If you're going to remove the hair, then I would suggest going to a professional. Expensive, but it works.   If the hair remover cream isnt specifically for down there, then dont. It will burn.   Trust me.
yWRTrnR2aa	It's called a pompadour, here's a great tutorial:  http://community.livejournal.com/hair_tu...|`|OtluuQXhaa	Bumpits. They're these things you put in your hair to volumize it.|`|8uUpAKPtaa	use a small toothed comb to tease it then pull it back, if you go to youtube there's alot of how-to videos for that kind of thing.|`|LSKeLOIGaa	U can use the big curling irons to bump ur hair u can even use a flat iron but use it like it were a curling iron.|`|vhXbGB8naa	Bump its!|`|uxrFOOn9aa	the answer from robyn is the best one you have so far but let me take it one step further for you.   first you will need that fine tooth comb and you will lift up the top portion at the crown of the head , now tease this and then spray it with hair spray, now with that can of hair spray let the teased hair rest for a second while the spray dries a bit. for literally 1 to 2 seconds. now take the top layer of the sides of your head and repete the same steps. your hair should now be looking like a hot mess so you will need to tame the hair down with the larger side of that same comb until it looks smooth at the top but still has a nice "bump" trust me on this one i am the bump queen my friend and my hair is pretty freakin great hahaha|`|PB2ucgrCaa	Why do you wont a bump ,take it from a guys point of view that is not hot!
HbZGe23naa	i have tons of male clients that straighten their hair not gay at all. It get the look that you want to achieve.

X|`|8D8ck9pVaa	try primarrkkkkkkkkk|`|qyT15nmXaa	Those are waistcoats; not cardigans or shrugs. But anyway, basically any high street fashion shop sells then. River Island, Topshop, Newlook, Miss Selfridge, Primark... the lot. =]    x
VihV4Troaa	they are cheap already. $40 for DCs while nikes are $75+.|`|W49bJtWraa	tkmax.    i went in mine today and saw some genuine DC's at 19.99|`|dfq3Vd9uaa	I saw a buch of mens and women's DC shoes at Ross the other day average price was 24.99 women's and 29.99 for men.
fu4VXe1iaa	Of course I would recomend them! Gloves are great, they make your outfit look a lot more elegant and sophisticated, not to mention that it's really great because it makes your hands feel soft and they feel nice. It always works a treat!      Concerning the rules, it's very clear: "the shorter the sleeve, the longer the glove." Opera length gloves are therefore properly worn with strapless, sleeveless, sleeveless with spaghetti straps or short-sleeved gowns. Elbow length is ok but if you really want to follow the rules, go for the 'shoulder length" gloves (choose ones that are very -but not too much of course- tight so that you won't have to pull them up every 5 minutes ;-) ). Apart from this, definite don'ts & do's are:    Don't make a habit of carrying your gloves ~ they should be considered an integral part of your costume.  Do wear gloves for formal indoor occasions: receptions, balls, and on arrival at a luncheon or dinner party.   Do keep gloves on in a receiving line.   Do keep gloves on while dancing at a formal party.    [edit]: I think that it is worth "investing" in high-quality satin gloves. Don't buy cheap (lycra) gloves which will be not be wearable after a short span of time. I think that 20-25 $ are worth the spending.|`|HBWPA8rEaa	I wouldn't wear them with peach either ..well really am not keen on them but I agree if you are going to do it wear them  with darker colour|`|6mBrJ2EGaa	my sister got some at claires for ten dollars...and that should be fine!!!|`|r1KTZBkraa	gloves-no  i think they look tacky  just dont wear them|`|t2LOcPkLaa	haha yeah, they're cute. depends on the occasion. i have black ones. they sell them at claire's for pretty cheap and they're actually not bad quality. they also sell them at their sister store called icing (which is made for older teens).|`|AA10531094	Formal Wear For Social Functions    If your evening gown is sleeveless or has short or cap sleeves, you may also elect to wear long white opera gloves. You may wear them during the cocktail hour and when you're going through the receiving line (or if you're in the receiving line.), but pull them off and lay them in your lap during dinner (try not to confuse them with your napkin). If you like, you may put them on again for dancing after dinner.    Good Luck!|`|1lOzRfT1aa	Long length gloves a advantGarde and very stylish if you want to be different then the others  anywhere you can get gloves and about the cost depends if you are wanting pricey or inexpensive|`|RQc8fbjbaa	I'm not sure about rules. Whose rules? I say wear what you want!|`|PZT4wyGoaa	I wouldn't use it with a peach dress.  I would use it with a dark color, like an emerald, or a ruby, or a dark blue.  That's just me though.  I don't really know the rules to them.|`|BeQQsyJJaa	i say wear the white gloves, i c an imagine it and it would look great, and plus white matches with almost everything, i say go for it (: whatever looks like wear it, but of course ask for your friends opiniions, but for me i say YES (:     RULES - i dont really know about the rules, they probably are just white, black, or peach gloves because that is what matches (:    GOOD LUCK (:   yeaa, they do sell them at claires or just any boutique around. claires have white ones for sure, i've seen them.    dont forget to wear white shoes or matching flats or something that matches.|`|qH0cXkRvaa	I thikn that while elbow length gloves only go with red or black dresses tbh'  I would say dont wear them. go for more of a manicured hand look :)    Hope i helped :)  xxx|`|0256768370823943bbd15e024f80932daa	you can probably get them for under $15   what are you wearing them for they hardly every look good unless its a debutant or bride for anything else it looks like your trying to hard

Arm pit hair will also work.|`|ZabhfIGraa	Ten inches minimum but Locks of Love is a scam... hair that is cut and is not used is sold on the Internet - a known fact.  Keep your hair long and give a cash donation instead.|`|VFyERjSSaa	10 inches or longer!!!|`|YW6cDP96aa	10 inches or more, if it is layered the longest layer has to be 10 inches  http://www.locksoflove.org/|`|2sHUA9e5aa	dude i have 24 - 30 inches of hair!  so i'm good to go|`|hXiVbbEfaa	it has to be at least 10 inches or more. i've donated 12 inches of hair to locks of love in 2006. i'm considering donating again.

I wish I still had that long chestnut curly hair.  It really is not fair getting grey especially when you turn like that at 40.

iYPRWaHsaa	Well my answer is Herbal Essences. Mostly all of them have a good, strong smell, but the one for curly hair smells the strongest in my opinion. I use it and I love it!|`|JdpkRtGfaa	Anything from L'occitaine smells really good, especially the lavender scent. I can always smell it for the whole day in my hair when I shower before school.|`|1E1m0ZOFaa	i Absolutely LOVE herbal essences, definitely use that one. i can't quite remember the name but it is the dark blue one. the one where it has coconut and hibiscus in, and the advert is h2o h2o h2o. That one has definitely the best smell out of all of them|`|eYQhJHYNaa	i use Garnier Fructis sleek and shine ( i have poofy hair) and it makes my hair smell really good. Its especially good because i swim all the time and it makes my hair soft and shiney.      Hope i helped!|`|LBdQxKrpaa	L'Oreal shampoo for kids comes in several fruit scents which are long-lasting. I find the blueberry smoothie and vanilla (called something like "I scream vanilla") smell nice and the smell lasts.

2c459161dc5bf9558eaeecda2ac9500aaa	If the ring has no stones, do this:    take an aluminum pan or line a pan with aluminum foil.  Fill with about 2 inches of water.  Add 1 tsp bicarb of soda and 1 tsp salt.  Boil.  Throw the ring in.  Boil for 2-3 minutes.  Pour out, catch the ring, rinse it and rub it while rubbing it with your fingers.  Take a soft cloth like flannel or cotton, and rub it until it's nice and shiny.  The end.|`|iRjEqwOraa	lemon juice will take care of it! soak it in lemon juice for about 15-20 mins then rub it with baking soda. hope this helps!|`|AA10531094	Try ketchup or Antibacterial hand soap or liquid dish soap.     Place a small amount of antibacterial soap in the palm of the hand, place the ring in the palm and gently rub the ring in the soap. Rinse with warm water and towel dry.    You can use a rag for the ketchup or repeat the above.    Good Luck!

I use the whole like but the treatment is the real star. You may have to back off for a few weeks on the color, and honestly...no more bleach for awhile. make sure you are getting a deposit only color. This will sound wicked gross, but don't wash your hair until you can't stand it because your hair needs to rebuild its natural oils. Maybe use a semi-perm dye in a darker color for the time being.|`|8cI05KUOaa	i think you should go to a salon and they have something to fix it. also you should stop putting so much chemicals to your hair for a while cause it can really damage your hair|`|zI3Y7Pz5aa	well, i would go to a salon honestly. they have toners to get the green out and have awesome reconditioning treatments for overly processed hair.|`|Af1B9qqaaa	Most likely you might have to let your hair grow out.

It looks as if the shirt would cover the shorts.|`|y0QllkEMaa	They'd definetly look cute together. A little casual though but the top would go with a bunch of other things too.|`|oCfOuIr8aa	Decent. A bt too casual with the shorts I think.|`|x8Ji7sDXaa	the shorts seem a bit too short for the shirt, you know? (like the shirt would cover up the shorts) but the shirt is very cute :)|`|fsyz8Qwoaa	i like it a whooooole bunch :)  with like big chunky silver bracelets!|`|x3HqloL7aa	Yeahh its nice, it just depends where and when you'll wear it.|`|Xd0xBRk6aa	its cute  i love the top  but maybe instead of denim shorts just get a different material i know abercrombie has alot of other choices....and make sure the top isnt too long for the shorts  .....&& skinny jeans would look great too|`|728fa89f222f3d8b9e88553f9bc954ffaa	Cuteeee. :)|`|qtDtHwFfaa	It's ok, I guess. The shorts seem a little short, but the shirt compensates for it by not being too tight. I'd go for an outfit with a little more color and personality, though.|`|VrjF986Aaa	cute! you should add a small brown across the shoulder bag and maybe a cute pair of wedges|`|QTlYilP8aa	It's cute  Maybe add some colorful bead necklaces or something like anything on this page  http://www.charlotterusse.com/family/ind...

zBaUWUXfaa	Net-A-Porter is a really great store. They have trendy clothes for people of all ages. But unless your made out of money- i would not recommend it, The clothes are SO EXPENSIVE. The pieces are cute, but such a splurge. Some might be worth the money, but others you can find close replicas of at department stores and Forever 21|`|VrjF986Aaa	It's an online only store that sells ready to wear designer clothing, so it is expensive.    "Net-a-porter.com was one of the first major online shops carrying international luxury fashion, and is still one of the most prominent.  The London-based website was launched in 2000 by Natalie Massenet, a former magazine journalist and stylist. It now employs more than 800 people in New York and London [1] and claims to attract 1.8 million viewers per month. [2]  The 200-odd designers represented range from world-wide "superbrands" like Fendi and Givenchy, to smaller cult favorites like Philip Lim and Paul & Joe. [3] The selection is geared towards women. Unlike designers' own websites, or many fashion magazines, Net-A-Porter does not use catwalk shots or highly stylized photo shoots in which the clothing is often obscured. Instead, it uses what looks like a single plastic mannequin so individual items can be viewed clearly, from all angles, and at various close-ups.  Shoppers can also quickly search by designer, size, color or item, which makes browsing a large number of pieces faster and more efficient than physically going to a department store or shopping mall. Time Magazine named it one of the top websites of 2008." - Wikipedia|`|ADtfT5L3aa	http://www.net-a-porter.com  it is a website that sells designer stuff|`|00hrUiQZaa	its a website that sells designer brands ( expensive1!!) xxx|`|vsjCVgtjaa	it is cheap price wise
1ec68af802a245413f439236df86307daa	guys = stupid. seriously? he's probably just jealous cause the only girls that have ever shown him their underwear were wearing granny panties. she shouldn't let it get to her...i wear thongs all the time (more comfortable, and although boyshorts prevent vpl, thongs are better with tight jeans) and i'm sure tons of people have accidentally seen stuff. tell her not to worry about it, and try to wear lower-cut thongs (VS pink makes really low-cut ones that are really cute) with maybe higher-cut jeans if it bothers her that much. but my rule of thumb? if you don't act like it's a big deal, no one else will.|`|iV4yWexRaa	why didn't you just tell her when her underwear was showing? besides a thong is like practically 2 pieces of string how ugly can they be? now if they were huge white granny panties with like cartoons on them that would be funnier
hkW8wsRYaa	That sounds great! But be careful, I had a disaster with blue hair. My hair is medium blonde and my friend who was in beauty school said she'd do it. I wanted some teeny streaks and she kept screwing up and we ended up dyeing all my hair blue. Then, because my hair is blonde, it faded into this ugly seaweed color. So, it's a really cute look but don't have an idiot do it like I did :). With your hair color, I don't think you'll have to bleach it. Plus, it's always a good idea to do a little hidden spot first and make sure it looks good before doing the rest. Then, be sure to have some extra dye around if it fades a little. If you want teeny streaks you may want to get a cap where you pull through the streaks you want. Plus, I think doing the tips is a way cute look. I'm sure it'll look great.|`|RogGEdyoaa	Very thin streaks.|`|weaFl9mVaa	blue tips always look fantastic! good luck :-)|`|IQs0tMiJaa	my friends and i did a streak of hair from underneath, like right near your ear. i thought it looked pretty good ;)|`|NOz2NIMTaa	Put in on your bangs and at the top of your head. That'd start a trend.|`|ZOKvVe8Faa	if you have side bangs you should put a strip in the bangs and then one in the opposite side of your hair towards the middle. don't overdo it, because then it will look trashy.|`|8eCVHHbQaa	dye it on the bottom, so when your hairs in a pony tail, it looks like the bottom half of your hair is blue and the top half is your regular color. and when your hair is down, you will be able to see it under your hair.
AXS4qkMgaa	I say curl your hair and put it up into a sexy, messy bun with tons of pieces hanging down.  Put some sequin clips in your hair and spray some sparkle spray in it (you can find glitter hairspray on the internet).    OR    You can get long layers and gently curl the ends of your hair for a dewy look.  Take two small sections of your hair on each side above ear twist it and bobby pin it 3 inches from the back of your head.|`|CcTVp28Paa	Post a picture so we see what you look like.  Or describe your hair so we have an idea.. is it curly/straight, thick/thin, long/short?  We need details.|`|uxrFOOn9aa	just dont go with a up do, these are way old school  and look like 1980's prom. you should have a soft sweep if its going up and my opinion is that you sould wear it with big loose curls and down with a piece or two pulled either back or to  the side|`|axE0qrJHaa	do NOT do an updo!!!  i say nice, natural loose curls....like Lauren Conrad style :)
7ERpxpFnaa	I love aussie 3 min miracle conditioner... its about 5 i think - I love it and it smells a bit like bubble gum!    (I have curly hair which i straighten sometimes and the ends get brittle - it soaks this stuff up and makes it smell and feel lovely!)|`|5793e96405109506ce7e9f6a4ff6ce46aa	what hollie said works!!  also charles worthington 'time defy' shampoo nd conditioner is EXCELLENT|`|aYICSwMpaa	Hi    Sunsilk is REALLY good. I've tried expensive masks etc that i've bought from salons and they arent as good.    I love the purple sunsilk it makes your hair soooo soft and shiney.    Use the shampoo and conditioner. Leave the conditioner in for like longer than it says.    Another tip is to apply a small amount to your hair when its in a high ponytail etc keeps it all smoothed down but most importantly will act as a mask. You could also put it on slightly damp hair and leave it over night and wash off in the morning.    X|`|ICu09a8saa	hey , i have the perfect remedy for your hair, it's very cheap but but it's going to sound a little odd.     first get a lump of butter about 2 ounces and massage it into your wet hair.  then put a shower cap over your hair and leave for thirty minutes. after thirty minutes take off the cap and rinse your hair. then shampoo and condition as normal.  leaving your hair clean and shiny and repaired.
lPCjNkEnaa	Middle finger on your left or right hand.|`|nvYt8FV7aa	put it on ur right hand n put it on that finger.|`|qtDtHwFfaa	Ring finger, right hand.|`|zid2s6Z5aa	All you have to do is wear it on your right hand, that ring finger. Not your left hand. Everyone at my school wears theirs like that. I didn't buy one but yeaa, that's how everyone else wears theirs. :)    I hope I helped. :)
e1434520b7d6b7db2b483084c9ad434aaa	Hairstyles:  - Half up with a clip or hair tie. I also like putting half up in a bun with bobby pins. (They tend to not get caught on my hair.) I also love these:  http://www.flexi8.com/  - Side parted hair with the front section clipped to the side. I like to use little jaw clips, but bobby pins will work if your hair isn't too thick.  - Flipped through pony tail. Put your hair in a loose pony tail. Reach up under the pony tail and separate the hair there into two sections. Use your other hand to twist the tail and then pull it through from the bottom.   - French ponytail. Put the top section of your hair (above ears) into a ponytail. Next, put the middle into a pony. Then put the bottom into a pony. This looks less kiddy if you do it looser with pretty clips.  - Braids and buns are simple and can disguise bad hair days. If your hair is too short for a single braid, try pigtails. http://www.wikihow.com/Braid-Hair  -French braid headband. This works for leaving the hair down or up and is quicker than a real one. http://www.wikihow.com/Make-a-French-Bra...    Here are some basic tips for curly hair that you might find helpful:  *Try to find a stylist who knows how to work with curly hair. You can find reviews by region here: http://www.naturallycurly.com/curlsalons  *Don't shampoo every day.  *Comb conditioner through hair in the shower.  *Apply styling products to dripping wet hair. Scrunch or twirl hair to achieve desired shape.  *Use styling products suited for your hair type. Dont know yours? http://www.naturallycurly.com/hair-types  *Avoid terrycloth towels on hair; use linen, paper towels, or t-shirts instead.  *Air dry or use a diffuser with your blowdryer.  *Don't touch (or brush!) your hair while its drying.  *Once completely dry scrunch out any crunchy texture.    For hair type specific products check out these forums:  http://www.naturallycurly.com/curltalk/  There you can find others with the same hair type and try out some of their favorite products. I would recommend something, but I dont know your hair type. :)    Lastly, it has made my hair so much better since I started the curly girl method! I used to almost never wear it down (it was a frizz/poof ball), but now I have pretty, shiny curls. ~:) Its pretty radicalno sulfates (shampoo) or siliconesbut its so great for curly hair. Give it a shot and check it out:  http://www.wikihow.com/Follow-the-Curly-...  http://www.ylcf.org/gotcurl/ (outdated product recs!)

If you don't trust them, you can always try Yesstyle for Korean fashion.|`|Vhq3GURQaa	Anytime you buy anything online it is a risk to a degree. Why don't you buy something small to start and see what the service/ policy is like. By small I mean in price and size. In case it's wrong you'll save on shipping it back.|`|PheTyRryaa	honestly im not sure i would just stick to the stores that you know are real and have in malls.|`|1ioI2py4aa	you will always know if a website is safe to buy of if it has the safe logo on its homepage which looks like a lock and key|`|uCsu1VYgaa	not all of them, alot of website based in asia can have a bit of a sketchy rep.     http://www.yesstyle.com is quite reliable however, I have ordered from them before, they have reasonable, and decently okay shipping.

It's in their genes of what type of hair hey have. Back in the old days black hair was very popular. It's not just blacks with it it can be anyone.|`|Af1B9qqaaa	Well it depends.    Not all blacks have course hair.    it all depends on your heritage and your ancestors    I have white on both sides of my family.    It all depends.
2KMYz3Rjaa	Only certain clothes, most of the time it is just the PINK stuff and also some lounging clothes and bathing suits.

They are both the same store, although they are keeping their brands.

zih1Weanaa	I think everyone looks fantastic with the "Rachel." It is a straight style that has lots of fun layers and gives lots of volume to an otherwise boring style.

tgSxXGhAaa	Is it a big square scarf? Here's how i do it :    1) Fold a big square scarf in half  so it's a big triangle.   (And remember: fringe = awesome.)  2) Wrap it around your neck like a bib and tie it in a loose, simple knot in back. You could also bring the ends back to the front, or tuck them under. Leave it straight, slide the whole thing over a bit, whatever. Its up to you.    :)|`|CfUuDEW9aa	some scarfs come like that so you just put it over ur head like a shirt and it looks like that|`|m7Y10ojiaa	That's a square scarf, that's why it looks so different. You just wrap it around your neck like normal.|`|vhXbGB8naa	You just knot it behind your neck.|`|yT295TT2aa	looks good the way you have it.you can also tie it around your waist or a loose knot in front of your neck and let it drape over your shoulders or fold it long ways three times and let hang over you shoulder front and back|`|g9DWi0DKaa	fold it in half (triangle) and wrap the top corners around the neck so the cross at the back and go in front of your shoulders|`|3AffceXnaa	i no how to do it but it is hard to say in words...instead of talking out loud|`|WKHfum34aa	you put it on and wrap the left end over your neck to the right and the right end over your neck to the left and leave them.|`|J9cJNOr2aa	I found this.    http://www.brooksbrothers.com/scarfknots...    But instead skip step 4-5 and just tie the two ends underneath. Or just leave them, it all depends on how you want it to look.    P.S. I know it's kind of a weird website but it's the first thing that I found. Good luck!
lqgxr5o7aa	well you have lovely eyes and i think a layered look with soft side swept bangs would look wonderful on you!!!  try something like this...  http://bp0.blogger.com/_TSrjIzau_10/R29k...  and it would look great with bangs like these...  http://img257.imageshack.us/img257/7282/...  and if you want to be a little daring, try a color like this...  http://www.saloncarmichaels.com/uploads/...  or just getting some brown lowlights in your hair would look great!!!    hope i helped!(:  |`|VB5midTraa	i don't think you should cut it. as a matter of fact i think you should let it grow. i think you should dye your hair a chocolate color. maybe with highlights like a hazelnut color.|`|RiXnc3TIaa	http://www.imageandstylenews.com/wp-cont...    http://www.latest-hairstyles.com/gallery...|`|uxrFOOn9aa	well first off you have amazing eyes and a nice round face so I think that a a-line bob would look great on you. I would like to add that your hair color now makes you look a little washed out. Its not right with your skin tone. Have you ever thought of a medium brown? This would really set off your eye color and make your skin look great with a really nice glow. go type in pictures of aline bobs and see what comes up for you. good luck with the new doo    ps im not being rude but lighten up on that eyeliner, you dont need so much of it your eyes are enough they dont need that black mess around them try a brown tone instead. just tring to help you look your best :P hope thats ok|`|qWcw4Vz2aa	its pretty!(:
JyWCPVfzaa	Crest|`|VrjF986Aaa	the only ones I've ever tried were the classic Crest White strips. They worked really well but I have sensitive teeth and sometimes it would hurt. Also you have to keep them in for 30 mins which is annoying. I've gotten OK results with the crest 5 minute strips, but my teeth aren't as white as when i used the 30 min ones.|`|E7vuPi9uaa	crest..
VrjF986Aaa	Those shoes scream "fall" to me, so I have to admit they would look pretty silly in the spring time. The tan shoes with khakis is a bad idea too you will look washed out in khaki - scary. Honestly those shoes aren't that attractive either, but if you are going to wear them wait until the fall b/c otherwise it will look stupid.|`|hXwVXFy3aa	ya I think thats fine, but I'm not one for crazy fashion knowledge. try them on and decide for yourself.    answer mine? http://ca.answers.yahoo.com/question/ind...|`|bdc0c1d1aead267282553512169a9932aa	there are really no 'rules' anymore...so wear what you want...if YOU like it, it's in style.|`|Vhq3GURQaa	Seems fine and btw very cute. People wear the fur topped boots all year. That would have been considered nuts before. The old "rules" don't apply much.|`|AW1OWmOtaa	Ok I would consider them to be more winter shoes but worn with a nice skirt and blouse or jeans they could be ok too.|`|Pg3voqXkaa	I'd say go for it!  As long as it goes with the outfit.      Keep in mind though that suede does get dirty and gets damaged easily by rainy weather...april showers!|`|1ioI2py4aa	of course you can
qtDtHwFfaa	Prom is a chance to really let your personality shine. Google "prom dress quizzes" or "prom dresses for your body type" and see what they have to say. This will give you some ideas of the style of dress you're looking for, and any special features it should have (such as a halter top, empire waist, etc.). You're tan enough to pull off almost any color of dress, but make sure to try on any dress before you buy it to see whether or not the color will wash you out or make your skin look unnatural. It's actually a lot of fun to get a group of friends together and go prom dress shopping. Each of you can give your opinions on the others' dresses, and you can all make sure you have different ones. Check smaller boutiques as opposed to larger department stores to ensure that fewer people wear the same dress as you. Have fun at prom!

ZpnSka8Baa	I'd say wear a button-down shirt, but roll it to your elbows. And wear a skinny tie, in a solid color.   A polo and tie might just be weird..?|`|1ec68af802a245413f439236df86307daa	polo + tie might look really weird. don't wear a really baggy shirt or baggy pants (girls don't like it!). maybe wear a button-down with a tie and/or a vest?|`|qtDtHwFfaa	You want to still look polished, even if you want to be unique. The key is color. A polo and a tie seems ok, but make sure that they have some personality - wear complimentary colors that are NOT white or black (these are way overdone and wouldn't be "fresh," as you say). The brightness of the colors is up to you - do you want to stand out, or just look unique? Keep your pants and shoes classic to balance the colorful shirt and not look *too* out there. Also, make sure to wear deodorant if you plan to dance - sweat stains ruin any outfit. Have fun at your dance!
2mA5SuPtaa	No, i never see any changes in me or my friends when our hairstyles and partings change.|`|s6ouZmPqaa	stupidest thing i heard so far|`|EfBolbkbaa	I do not think that this is true, but you could just be making yourself think that you are so you become what you think will happen, if that makes sense.    Unless you feel confident when oyu are with a different-sided part. That's a difference.|`|BeeHgaQraa	That sounds a bit silly....|`|x8Ji7sDXaa	wow thats really cool and interesting. haha no i've never experienced anything like that!|`|LuTjBw4Laa	umm no thats not true its your personality that controls how you act not the way your hair is parted
afU9Hg7Kaa	Building on their answer: capri, stonewashed, boyfriend cut, bootleg, flare, mid-rise, low-rise, elastic back, high waisted jeans. I may be able to think of more later.|`|YPNdv0pSaa	destroyed, skinny, flare, bootleg, low rise, super low rise...that's all I know lol
jez0O0bXaa	No, just different words.|`|MVdbt4Esaa	bleach dries out the hair and damages it badly i don't recommend bleaching it|`|3qvZTOUJaa	bleach is more damaging to hair.

Have fun!|`|Yiu4zXwKaa	heyyy =]] thanks for answering my question..    welll, so far the best advice i got was to wear a light colored shirt, because if the lights are flourecsent it will glow and that's maddd cool hahaha. wear shoes that are easy to take off, because if you have to rent those nasty *** shoes youll want your shoes to come off/on easily. have a good timeee! and if i get anymore good advice ill let ya know xx|`|vDMASHmLaa	white tshirt. white jeans . black & white converse|`|1ec68af802a245413f439236df86307daa	cosmic bowling = blacklights. so neon always looks really awesome. just don't wear a shirt that's remotely see-through with a white bra because the bra will glow and look awkward.    definitely dress casual...skinny jeans are my go-to. don't worry too much about the shoes because you're going to have to wear bowling shoes anyway. a fun t-shirt would be good--again, neon!|`|7KxyFsNKaa	wear a white tee (it will glow when u bowl wich looks ttly awesome)  if u hav shorts (the 1s tht go 2 ur knees) wear em if not wear dark demin pants. dont wear flare pants cus its harder 2 bowl. if u wear knee shorts wear the uggs. if u wear pants wear ur converese. hope i helped =]

Pg3voqXkaa	Try shaving your hair.  Hair grows back and luckily for guys, it doesn't take long for hair to grow to the approrpriate length.  I'd say give it a try, seee how you feel and if you like it, continue on doing it.  Also, u'd save $ on going to the barber, however, why not appreciate your hair that you hav e it now and when it gets really bad, then u can shave it.     I personally don't mind guys with a buzz cut.|`|GSwjoipVaa	Just get a buzzed cut. Receding hairlines arent all attractive. But I like buzzcuts.|`|noUZuLV8aa	do it !    I love bold guyz ,, it resembles more masculinity and sexiness =)))|`|E7vuPi9uaa	One of my friends has the same problem.  He had to shave his head for soccer's state championships...and it looked, well not good.  I guess it depends on how far bad your hairline is, but I wouldn't reccomend it|`|tjEG8dxwaa	I think you should also shave your head
4aGoWKtEaa	Your iron won't fry your hair unless you put some oil before and afterwords. I have been straightening my hair every single day for three years and my hair is in great shape. I to have extremely curly hair. So what I do to curl it is first I straighten it than I curl it with my flat iron. Just grab piece of your hair and go to the end and roll it up and wait for like a minute and let go. Or you can start at the roots and twist as you go down sometimes that doesn't work but you can try. Also you can do this with a 1 inch flat iron and if you don't have a one inch flat iron then go use a curling iron.|`|Af1B9qqaaa	Instead of using a curling iron, try using rollers. Wash your hair at night pop the rollers in when you finish washing. Wake up the ext morning and take them out last.    Try it.    It might work.|`|x3HqloL7aa	I use to have the very same problemm, but my hair was not as thick. I used to straighten it, now i have a shower and condition my hair LOADS, then use john freida serum and rub some of  it through my hair when wet and scrunch it when drying. After its dried its normally pretty curly but i also use curlers to do a few strands to build curls up. Then use a flower clip or something to clip a few bits up if it doesnt look rightt x
q2Q2uPVtaa	i like it, and if you like it you should get it :] i bet you will look pretty no matter how you get it done.|`|LJkPRqN0aa	its very simple, not saying i dont like it, its cute and very natural looking. go for it|`|bAmpR3Exaa	yes (: i thinkk its very cute ..|`|s6ouZmPqaa	nah. it's too dull.|`|61v2y8Rfaa	NOOOOOOO!|`|r7bmz65eaa	yeah, it's ok  streaks would be cool though|`|zI3Y7Pz5aa	yes its pretty|`|TJTB6PJhaa	It's okay...I mean, it's pretty, but it's not anything special.    And yeah, it's a pretty old hairstyle. Brenda Song has changed her hair about a billion times since then.|`|u1FlCXL0aa	its nice kinda boring  but if u like it  and its your style  then yeahh|`|8to6MsWuaa	yeahhh it's cute.|`|BhUAE6M8aa	no. there's this asian girl at my school who got that cut and i think it looks a little too un-unique like everyone has it.|`|AXS4qkMgaa	It's cute but I would get longer layers, those are too choppy.|`|dookiJfuaa	It could be.|`|uxrFOOn9aa	don't let these people tell you that it is too plain or to try something newer. you aren't tring to be the one with the newest hair style are you. your hair should be about what looks good, not what is the newest trend that will be out in 6 months to a year. i love it , the cut is classic and very versital|`|3QQla8BVaa	yes I think its very cute:) I would probably get that myself but I like mine.|`|fsyz8Qwoaa	not exactly.  too early 2000's.  try something newer.|`|zwrB1apbaa	ya. she has like some sort of layers but rather than that i like the colors and its like medium

RWQZijVsaa	No, you'd look better with short spiky hair :]  Not hard to get, just cut it shorty && use gel XD  You'd probably look good with a fo-hawk too, you shoud try it:  (search up fohawk, i didn't find any good pictures, but you'd  get the idea XD)|`|vhXbGB8naa	You shouldn't part your hair in the middle maybe..|`|nntQUfl1aa	yeah ,it does|`|8tdlP1rOaa	i think it does =)|`|niYixDU4aa	cut it short and spike it.  that'd look nicer.|`|x6hfvTX2aa	Yes, it does. I like the way you did the curl in the front.|`|wdYNUJ0Iaa	Yes, but it is very old-school.  I would suggest something short and spiky.|`|HbZGe23naa	something more like this
jez0O0bXaa	No.  You are doing the right thing.  Keeping the ends trimmed is keeping your hair healthier. Hair grows approximately 1/4 inch per month.|`|UjG8FqLUaa	N0 IT`LL JUST SEEM LIKE THAT BUT Y0U`LL ACTUALLY BE CUTTING THE SPLIT ENDS. IT D0ESN`T ST0P GR0WTH .|`|u1FlCXL0aa	no cuttin hair doesnt make it stop growing  but hair grows 1/2inch (average)  if you get 1/4 inches cut every month  it would appear thats its growing slowy   but no you just cuttin it|`|EpDTh2BJaa	i dont think it will ever stop growing maybe it wont grow as fast as it was before but it wont stop growing .|`|2YPybkw9aa	it wont stop growing bc your hair is dead skin and you will always have dead skin.|`|EuhWXJgiaa	you now what it deepens on your hair when my hair is long it doesn't grow fast when i cut it normal size it grows much quickly|`|bLQhabEzaa	hair never stops growing no matter wat race u are it could grow slower than others, plus I think it even grows when ur dead well thats one my chem teacher told me but he's old. But no the truth it wont stop growing.|`|csCzLJk2aa	no your hair continues growing no matter what. the only way to make your hair stop growing is through electrolysis.

jTRjaRmsaa	its probably because you have your hair straighten and when you sleep on it you might sweat at night and that also gets your hair greasy..    also its because you need to wash your hair..  there are lots of hair conditioners and shampoos that helps oily hair..    hope that helps =]|`|7d1xaEOBaa	Try and keep from touching your hair. The oils from your hands can get onto your hair and make it greasy. Ultimately washing it daily will do the trick. But if you don't have the time fro that consider getting a dry shampoo [can be found at your local drug store]|`|WPRAfLO7aa	Wash your hair daily might be a good idea..|`|wQpdot1Raa	Herbal essences do a shampoo for greasy roots and dry ends, I think it had a picture of a cornflower on it before they changed the design of the bottle...

jB5cMnGFaa	First of all-Nothing wrong with your pics :) U r pretty!   Secondly...I love multi-toned hair too-one colour is just B O R I N G lol  Most importantly...you have gorgeous features so u should hi-light to make them stand out more. I can see you with dark purpley or raisin/burgundy and caramel streaks, intertwined with the black. I would focus on the front coming down around the forehead as well as the lower part to curve around your face. I would stay away from reds or orangy colours as it would not flatter your skin tone. I actually think  you could throw in a few really thin white-blonde pieces to really pop it out. And remember the thinner the streaks the thinner you look :) I have a heart-shape faced and so I know! lol...Hope all turns out well no matter what colours u choose :)|`|vhXbGB8naa	Get some highlights.|`|bzZq4WlFaa	i think you look good with black hair!  but if you want to change your hair then i think brown highlights would look really good  .....................................  hope i helped :)                   bye

Wow that must  really SUCK.  thankfully my  mom lets me wear  whatever i want.

You need to fight  for your freedom!|`|4aGoWKtEaa	Tell her it isn't inappropriate that many kids your age wear it even younger kids wear it.|`|TJTB6PJhaa	Just wear it and when she starts yelling at you, just be like, "OMG, mom, I'm not 5 anymore. STOP CONTROLLING MY LIFE!" And then just walk out to where you were going. =)    And then when you come back, sit down and have a talk with her. You obviously don't want your mom to be really hurt by what you said, and if she is, make it clear that you love her, appreciate her opinion, but want to make clothing decisions on your own.|`|1ioI2py4aa	oooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooohhh they are all LUSH!!! talk to your mum about how you feel and explain that you feel left out because everyone else wears that sort of thing and if that does not work then take her to the store and show her the things on and she might change her mind|`|VrjF986Aaa	I can see why maybe not the dress b/c it's pretty tight, but she won't let you wear those sweaters? they don't seem that low cut to me, but maybe you can wear button up white shirts underneath them so you still get the sweater but it's classier. Really you can't do anything much but talk to your mom about it, she is just trying to be protective and with good reason, it's sad what parents let their little girls out wearing these days. And remember you are living under their roof and ur parents are making the money to buy the clothes so just be thankful that you have parents who care enough about you to try to protect you.|`|ovVZs8y5aa	explain to her that your no longer 6 years old and should be able to pick out your own clothing, tell her that you want some choice in your wardrobe and dont want to go around wearing things you dont like and want your own style.i hope i helped  good luck  and btw i love the shirts to :)|`|OV3crUBkaa	probably because she feel your to young to expose so much skin|`|Xd0xBRk6aa	just talk to her about it  && tell her your not a little kid anymore your getting older    besides i see nothing wrong with any of that stuff....there actually pretty covered up  tell her its not as bad as what some other people are wearing ;)    good luck =]]|`|dPUFgHQQaa	ew those are uglyyyyyyyyy  forever21.com is better|`|3akYIFUhaa	Shows your maturity level by posting this question, there's your answer right there. Immaturity.
OdLj07Svaa	it really depends on what your hair is like lots of people buy the cortex but some unfortunately some of their Straighteners dont last longer than a week they either don't heat up enough or they just dont work so if you go for that one mak sure you get the extended waranty. I think your mum could have been right try the croc straitener there has only been one bad review about it and they weren't using it right anyway lol|`|OBuzcIDbaa	My sister is a hair stylist and uses a Chi.  My daughters and I have curly hair. We have a Sedu.  It's about $125 and works great.  Don't know anything about Croc or Cortex.
HHnQyjFBaa	I think you should get a CHI. They are pricey, but so worth it. They don't damage your hair nearly as much as other flat irons, and they make your hair feel so smooth.    Cheers,   - Claire|`|dz3JusDMaa	your ovbiously not going to go for the price but chi is wayy better than both   if i had to choose i'd say babyliss, only because i never used a sedu before ;)|`|elPRtLRAaa	CHI all the way!|`|MLvwZ7uAaa	I bought mine at Target for 20$, and it's fantastic!

L5cReesbaa	My hair is pin-straight as well. For me, curling irons just don't work. I actually find that curling my hair with a straightening iron is most effective, using this technique: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dbk_gGCh8...    Then use some hairspray and voi-la!|`|7UIoQFKJaa	after you wet ur hair after a shower, tie it up in a bun for 18 hours, then dry it with a hair blower while its still in a bun cuz it probably wont dry on the inside while its in a bun so blow it dry and its gonna keep the shape for at least two days.  btw you dont need any spray or gel or anything like tht|`|ixHwF4apaa	for straightening of curly hair approach beauty parlour. even curly will look nice. now a days all of you changing to straight i do not know why|`|SSvRfxhaaa	You should try pantene hydrating curls conditioner. if you use curling irons you have to spray a lot of hair spray after
yW6KCd7iaa	i don't think it will ever go down. im 15 and have extremely oily skin. what i learned that has helped AMAZINGLY is to moisturize my face every morning and night with face lotion. it helps so much. my face use to be really shiny and so disgusting just a few hours after washing my face. now that i put lotion im good all day. dont have to touch up with powder or anything. you should use lotion with sunscreen in it to keep your face safe from the sun too!!|`|4a7f262367ce439921ed41cf674ac9e8aa	Hormones do affect the issues you may have with your skin but your skin type, i.e. normal, oily, combination, dry, will pretty much stay the same until you become older like 50's when the skin becomes dry. To manage your skin right now, use a lathering facial wash in the morning and at night. Overwashing can actually lead to an overproduction of oil so be careful not to over wash. Also, still be careful to use a moisturizer that is water based. Moisture and oil are not the same. You definitely need moisture in your skin. Good Luck!!!|`|nHi1mioBaa	No,i dont think age will make any difference

nOMWG8SMaa	Your hair looks incredibly healthy, but if you have dyed your hair it might not be strong enough. Tell the salon stylist EVERYTHING you have ever done to your hair so they can make the decision if it is healthy enough.     A lot of woman don't tell the whole truth about how often they've dyed their hair, and they end up with a lot of hair breakage.|`|a55c811df92734d3da6ba231bf1219e6aa	YES. it looks already straight though...|`|F6qbI4UYaa	Yeah, unless that's colored, your hair looks pretty healthy.      P.S I wouldn't recommend getting a straightening perm because your hair is already straight.. it won't do anything!!!
kZ9TTWZ9aa	Okay Well I suggest you go to hot topic to get navy blue jeans.

B2dUw6Zpaa	Dove|`|AA10097817	Sounds like my hair, I finally gave up on the curls. But there was a time when I had a perm, but I didn't like the feel. I did find when I used to color my hair it would hold a curl better. But I didn't like the feel of that, either.|`|JwdU9nVBaa	my favorite is "rave".|`|G3uTp7dpaa	i lovee dove & paul mitchell stuff.|`|OdLj07Svaa	get some curling serum it acts a little like hair spray but it keeps your curls soft and natural looking you can pick some up at any drug store its pretty cheap the most expensive one i've seen was $20 and that was a professional one that they sell in the hair dressers where i work  you only need a little bit and it should last the day and protect it from the heat of the curling wand so you don't end up with dry damaged hair as for hairspray it doesnt hurt to put some in afterwards as a back up i like silhouette its been around from the eighties and could hold hair up on a 90 degree angle lol|`|AH3wnGbcaa	suave, because its not bad for nature and the world. well i dont think so, but look for hairspray thats ecofriendly. (:0|`|Es56v2Ohaa	paul mitchell is a very good choice, its only found in salons though.    and before curling your hair, you need to find a spray that will prevent your hair from burning.
taYFAwlzaa	i have a friend that kinda looks like you but the difference is that she has long straight hair and bang that are straight. So keep your hair long but get layers and start straightenning.

AA11705009	Have you considered Arbonne?   I don't recommend ever giving away a catalogue without a contact name and number. That is money you are throwing away.  I would love to tell you more about Arbonne. You set your hours and how much you want to make it is your business.  Let me know.
KjF0p72naa	Volumizing products or root lift from your local salon.|`|7oKBEKAVaa	Use thickening products, preferably stuff you can get in salons because those are definitely higher quality. Teasing just a little will give you some volume as well. When it comes to blowdrying, make sure you blow your hair with your head upside down for maximum volume and results.    I recommend "Big Sexy Hair" shampoo and conditioners from salons, they've worked the best for me.|`|alRLh7yxaa	Do you blowdry your hair upside down? That helps, also buy some Vavoom root lifter, or any kind of root lifter, or you could try some volumizing mousse
JKn1j1uLaa	no we just dont know we rock though
bhyVC2mtaa	1.) vinegar rinse hair with about 1/2 cup of vinegar.. just pour a bit on the roots (tilt head back), then aim for the middle of the hair's lenght, then to the ends. try to get every part of the strand rinsed in vinegar.  2.) shampoo  3.) condition, focusing on the ends mainly.  4.) the purpose is to build shine and remove build-up from hair styling products. this can also help the hair to defend against damage.  5.) you may want to shampoo twice and then condition, whereas the vinegar smells bad. this should remove the smell.  6.) the results are amazing! best with dark hair because dark hair has more shine.. so this would maximize the shine. it works on blonde too but its just more noticable on darker strands.|`|NMMYw8WDaa	Um. dont do it  just get your hair styled professionally  and if your 12-15 like you probably are  just ask yer mum to take you to the stylist    it makes your hair reek  it dries out your hair, making it brittle (vinegar is an acid, sweetie)    plus it really would be odd.    if you wanna lighten your hair, try some hidrogen peroxide or lemon juice|`|UByvC54Xaa	1 part apple cider vinegar  9 parts water    apply, leave for 20 minutes, rinse and then shampoo as usual. If you shampoo after vinegar rinse - it wont smell anymore.    What is your reason for wanting to do this as I may be able to help with other recipes/tips|`|rB82Ujlgaa	what does this vinegar rinse do?|`|6uZ0VHFTaa	1/4 cup vinegar on final rinse. Rub in, then rinse well, your hair will shine and no it will not smell bad.

xxx9xs4jaa	The hair transplant I know of takes a strip of skin from the back of your head and separated the individual hairs from that strip to place in the needed area (usually the front). Since these need to be individually placed, the strands probably won't be as close together as when he was younger. The new hair would be as thick (in terms of the strands thickness) as his hair is, because this method uses his own hair.      Hope this helps :)
3b37fdc862db090d3541b2f414a43137aa	Since the wedding is this Saturday (way to go girl!  waiting till the last minute, huh?), I wouldn't try eBay.  You may not get it delivered on time.  However someone here mentioned David's Bridal.  It is a defiinite yes!  I would also recommend Jessica McClintock.  You can find this Designer's store in Chicago.  I bought my bridesmaids' dresses there.  Each of them wore the dress on numerous occasions post my wedding and they all thanked me for that.  Can't remember the town in the suburbs, but check it out.  You pay couple hundred bucks for a Designer's dress that is absolutely fabulous.  And they have all the sizes imaginable too :-)|`|7c453c69a2fd3933d0656c03f5488174aa	ebay.com (where I got mine)    Or try David's Bridal, I think they are in Illinois, too...|`|AA11308658	This saturday??

The skin has stretched beyond what it was capable of and the marks are the result. Keeping the body well lubricated during pregnancy suggests that you might be able to control them but that is as a preventative measure. The good news is that stretch marks will fade. Sorry, but once you have them, you are stuck with them|`|c7a6d98baff9845ba7868fbcee5a023faa	EXERCISE WILL MAKE THEM LESS NOTICEABLE .

AA12274064	this is what you need:    Paul Mitchell Super Skinny Hair Serum, you put it in your hair when it's wet and smooth through after that, blow dry your hair it cuts down the drying time as well.    After that you need Sleek.Look smoothing system iron smoother! You sprits this on your hair piece by piece and straighten it with a hair straightner and not some cheap one either.    You need a CHI hair straightener, it is rather pricey but it will be worth your while, the steam from it adds shine to it and is healthy for your hair. It straightens your hair like a normal straight hair person's hair would look like. I have one, believe me stop wasting money on something that kills your hair everytime you use it, and invest in something that will be WORTH your time and your money.|`|AA11121151	Straightning iron, or go to a salon|`|AA12130816	Go get a perm or get it chemically straightened.|`|AA12151275	get the straightner that sisters use|`|13fd70a8525fff157c0705929dc0bbf8aa	Invest in a nice straightener...look for one with CERAMIC or GLASS plates.

Ok...i've thought about this and i think i have a reason why: girls butts are more likely to be real instead of fake and made of silocone like boobs are, and as you get older it's easier to keep your butt in good shape unlike boobs who uh..head south.|`|vxr9R1Kzaa	They don't.

But reverse physcology always works.|`|JzgzvPxvaa	basic instinct. a bigger butt usually means that she has wider hips and wider hips mean she will be a good mother and that kind of thing. another reason it could be is if you look at all old paintings with women in them, they are plumper (hence bigger butts) because back then it mean you were rich and healthy. the perceived notion that skinny is beautiful mean the opposite then, it mean you were poor, you couldn't afford food and you were probably sickly. in my opinion i like girls with big butts because they got curves, girls with curves are sexier, when you touch them they are soft and warm, with a skinny girl this is not the case because they are bonny and kinda cold. but in reality its all based upon that basic instinct to keep the human race from going extinct.|`|A3Rq88Qmaa	Ah I don't know.

5KAreKDjaa	You can try heated rollers, wrap up your hair when it's wet then blow dry (on a low setting). If you don't want to pay then one way is to leave your hair down and after towel drying curl it round your finger all over and keep doing this til it's dry. Put hair spray on and it'll stay that way all day. Pretty cool for saying no heat was involved. If you want to use curlers then your hair has to be dry.  Ooh another thing I do is to tie it up in a bun then when it's dry it's corkscrew curls! But my hair is naturally curly or naturally frizzy I should say|`|J0UDzMCiaa	You can put mousse in your hair, then put in some plastic or velcro hair curlers and then sleep on it.

Xa1FjH5caa	Go to a piercing studio, NOT to anywhere where they will use a gun, example Claires. I was too young to get mine done so I done it myself I DO NOT RECOMMEND THIS! But My best friend works as an assistant in a piercing studio so it was safe. Just get it done with a needle, NOT a gun, clean it every day with surgical spirits for about 2-3 months and it should be fine. The pain isnt bad either, its not as bad as a lobe piercing (in my opinion) with a lobe piercing you feel a pinch with cartilage piercing you will feel pressure, but everyone is different so i dunno. Also it will be tender and a bit sore for 3-4 days and DO NOT sleep on it for at least a month. Even if the pain goes away before that time. Trust me. And if you have long hair try to keep it away from the piercing if it is greasy because the oils in your hair can contribute to infection. Hope I helped (:|`|O0S189PQaa	just clean it out with alcohol/the cleaner they give you everydday    example: i clean my cartilage piercing EVERYDAY with rubbing alcohol and it never gets infected.  my friend NEVER cleaned her cartilage piercing & hers got infected && she had to take it outt.|`|LLBxpMc7aa	go to a doctor|`|7ciDto6Daa	Go to a better place, sorry but not every one is gonna screw up piercing your ear. and always use the ear cleaner stuff they give you.|`|Awywcn2Caa	I think you can only do cartilage with nickel.

You may check that out and got to a place that does piercings all the time it may cost you more but at least it will be done right! Good Luck!
XG4TAjcCaa	Yes, if you already have dry hair, it will dry out your hair even more. You need to let your hair have a day or two for the natural oils to distrubute through your hair, keeping it healthy.    if you want to shower everyday, wear a showercap!     :)|`|QQdOpG2xaa	it can dry your hair too much, cause it strips it of the healthy oils, but if you take proper care and condition it, it'll be fine,,|`|IjwOIRcmaa	Unless your hair is abnormally oily or it got especially dirty that day, it's not a very good idea to wash your hair everyday. This is especially true if you have ethnic hair. Your hair needs a little bit of oil in it and all that shampoo and water can dry it out and damage it.|`|0CU89oyeaa	Most hair dressers recommend that you don't wash your hair every day. Depending on your hair type, usually every other day or every two days is best. Washing every day can make your hair really dry.     I still shower daily but instead of washing my hair every day, I just use a very small amount of conditioner.    It's much better for your hair this way,  especially if you blow dry, straighten or use a curling iron a lot. I straighten my hair three times a week and it still looks and feels very healthy.|`|EnAtAmHoaa	it's not taking a shower it's washing your hair. take a shower daily. it depends on you hair, personally i wash my hair every other day. it generally isn't good for your hair to be washed too often, it causes natural oils to be stripped and makes your hair and scalp dry. it's recomeneded to wash your hair 3 a week ans use a good conditioner on others. but it depends on how oily your hair gets in a day though, you don't want your hair to look greasy|`|6uZ0VHFTaa	You can take a shower every day but i wouldn't wash my hair but twice a week.|`|ox7mJ2Psaa	washing it every day is healthier than all the dying, bleaching, straightening, curling, weaving, .... that girls put their hair through. just use a mild shampoo like baby shampoo or a body and hair wash.|`|z6YwEjlpaa	Washing your hair daily does keep you clean as you said, however, it takes out all the oils that keep your hair smooth and makes your hair brittle and dry. It is recommended to wash your hair about 3 times a week and use conditioner if you aren't going to fully wash your hair during the other days. Just remember too much of something is awlays bad.|`|wqtwzzPeaa	It's not exactly unhealthy, but it's better for your hair to go every other day without washing.

AA12318232	Wash ur face twice with Neutrogena Rapid Clear Oil Control cleanser.It just takes the oil off.  Make sure u dont have dandruff cuz this leads to pimples.   Stay off oily foods and chocolates,chips etc. Drink loads of water.  Have half a lemon with a glass of warm water first thing every morning.  Exercise and meditate to feel pure and take the toxins off of u :)|`|079193db0f540ab34c7fc116d9dd5cc8aa	Drink plenty of water, get good rest, eat well and don't stress. Also, cleanse twice a day using a cleanser suited to your skin type, follow with a toner in the day and a water-based moisturizer with SPF. At night, after cleansing, use a water-based moisturizer without SPF. Exfoliate weekly using a clean, soapy washcloth and use a honey mask weekly or bi-weekly depending on your oil level. Also, keep your hands away from your face during your waking hours, be mindful of your cellphone's proximity to your face and also your hair products.|`|AA10918225	2 words   get a bottle of WITCH HAZEL  at walmart it does wonders on cleaning the face really good|`|AA11892957	Proactiv solution honey!|`|AA12137456	Drink chinese tea.|`|AA12278266	eat vegetables and fruits and drink water...also face your face more often..and if u already have pimples..don't scratch them...

And don't listen to the immature little kids call you a homosexual or a retard for something you wear, I'm straight.. Wearing something doesn't define your sexual preference.

So screw everyone with the immature mentality like that.|`|zPdG0SDeaa	O.O  I'm not sure if it's normal for guys to wear thongs yet, but if you don't want to wear boxers, I recommend wearing briefs.

AA11893495	I wish they were...I'd save a lot of money.|`|f0a19b62a8a4a2eb31f4279ff8e6a287aa	No in winter they usually fade.|`|AA10815621	No, tans are not permanent. If you stay inside most of the time for a few months, then you will notice that your skin is getting lighter. Also, if you go to somewhere tropical and get a tan, or get one at a tanning salon, then go back up north or to somewhere that has less sunlight, your tan will also lighten. You can test that your skin will lighten by taking a band-aid and putting it on your finger and leaving it there for several days. When you take it off, the skin that was under the band-aid will be lighter than the skin around it, but if you try this, don't worry, the skin under the band-aid should go back to it's normal color within a week (if you leave the band-aid off, of course).|`|AA10474642	They aren't permanent. They fade over a few months, depending on your skin pigment.|`|AA12104677	no...matter of days|`|9b38dfb6d6af7ad3cb673a7277b7291eaa	no|`|8616c971e5f1938203f437f6feb02b52aa	tans are not permanent.. i cant even guarantee you they will last a week. most of the time it take a good 2-5 week to good completely back to your color because tanning only tans the top layer of the skin|`|AA12018389	no they are not permanent for some it may go away after three months ...more or less it is different for different people|`|AA11213162	Depending on our skin pigmentation is how long it will retain color , But usually It will look good for about a month .|`|7e7e6e7466acf04c72e02943e98f5296aa	No,,,tans are not permanent..you have to find the sun to keep the tan. tanning salons are very popular were people cannot enjoy year around sunshine and warm weather.  You will lose your tan in about 1month if you stray from the sunshine---Happy Tanning..!!

wj3hc5SSaa	1st of all put serum in straight away after you straighten your hair!  then spray hairspray on a brush on then brush it through your hair this way your hair wont get greasy by using hairspray also john freida has introduce a anti frizz weather treatment which is very good.......  x|`|3hkArqvbaa	There is this anti-humidity hairspray from Aussie-it's amazing.

Hope I helped :)|`|bTZ4Ba99aa	hmm well i think that no matter what you do mother nature isn't gonna change. And it's the weather thats making your hair do that i can tell since you said you walk to school. But If you want to leave the straightner on there for about 2 seconds longer then the rest thats something you could try. You can also purchase Jon Fredia's frizz ease serum (which hardley expensive and you can find at any store) work it throught the ends while you're hair is wet, and that should probally do the trick!    hope i could help.    xo,|`|iWVswnRNaa	GHD Straightners are good but if want to straighten it and keep it still you have to get an hairspray that will keep it down .

It massages the scalp aswell as pulling from you hair throught the scapl :)    hope i helped|`|EY6E0zDKaa	use a product called nioxin, with that stuff my hair grew 2 inches in 2 or 3 weeks i hope that helpes =]]|`|7oKBEKAVaa	Honestly, the best way to grow your hair as fast as it can grow is through a good diet. Nothing you put ON your hair will make it grow, because the proteins coming from your head are already dead. The best those shampoos can do is sleek out your head ends and make it appear longer.     The rate of hair growth is already genetically programmed, the best you can do is eliminate anything that may HINDER hair growth, like a bad diet, smoking, etc.     Prenatal vitamins are as good of a vitamin as any, they just happen to have more of the vitamins that women who are pregnant need so that they are healthier than if they weren't taking vitamins.     Regular trimming will also eliminate dead ends, which can cause your hair to break off easier and seem to slow hair growth. Don't ever believe the old wives tale that trimming MAKES your hair grow faster, all it does is eliminate the breaking that seems to slow growth down.    DO NOT brush your hair as often as the first person suggests, It will do more harm than good and break fragile hairs, ultimately leading to SHORTER hair. I hate old wives' tales, always use common sense when it comes to things like that.

Cover the acne using a medicinal concealer such as the body shop tea tree concealer and wash it off once you get home.    Invest in some alice bands until your acne calms down and your fringe grows out- otherwise the acne and fringe problems will keep recurring.  Hope this helps, Kelly :)

AA11049630	slap yourself upside your silly face every morning, 'tard|`|AA10976046	You cannot give me a hundred points. But here goes.   Morning look depends upon what you do during the previous day. Drink lots of water, exercise , go for walks regularly, avoid alcohol at night or sodas, eat fresh fruits and vegetables. Live a healthy life. You will look fresh . As for eyes, do get it checked from a Doc. if this persists.  Also see you get a good night's sleep.|`|AA10086437	Sleep early (8hrs or more)  Beauty Sleep helps a lot ^_^|`|75fa8e1e78bddeb9e3c4adfbc54c78cbaa	Wash your face and take a nice hot bath.    :D|`|93c51b6a028d091dc44cc3f9da1dd4a4aa	wash your face right when you get up and then dry it really well and put on a moisturizer and give your face about a 1/2 hour and it should look very "fresh"

IIsByPj6aa	You'd probably wear a small.  in my experience, Hollister tends to have small-cut clothes, moreso than any other stores of that style.  It probably wouldn't be way too big, but definitely a bit roomier than you might otherwise be used to.
k5lfyMgNaa	They are free when you GET A BEAR, but they don't give you a lot, only enough so there is some for everyone else, all the little kids who aren't just going to put them in their hair, and actually use them for their animals.     Your best bet is to find something similar if you want a large quantity. I've seen them as dog grooming bows, they are practically identical. I've seen people auction them off on ebay before too, like a set of them. And they are easy to make. The only thing that's really different than a regular just bow, is that it has an elastic on the back of it, instead of like a barrette or something.      -And to that one person who answered, you can't just walk up and take a bunch. That would be rude. Those are complimentary for our CUSTOMERS.|`|woxz5TrDaa	EBAY and Amazon. I have seen plenty there, but try the store to get the ones you really want.|`|ShaUAySvaa	http://letmegooglethatforyou.com/?q=buil...|`|EnAtAmHoaa	they're free at build-a-bear or at least they used to be... or you can just make your own with ribbon, fabric glue and tiny hair ties|`|cy8VEbuCaa	just go to build a bear.  walk up to the bows.  grab one.  walk out.  they're free.   well they were, since it was in style.

zpovg4U7aa	brazilian is absolutely everything. bikini wax leaves a little strip around the most sensitive area, and it just gets rid of all the hair that may show on the bikini.|`|N0k6iZFRaa	Well.........they wax you from hole to hole on the brazilian and every thing around it.|`|N3qnOlehaa	um i guess a brazilian is all of ur, uh you know. a bikini wax just trims it up. and DJ Q, stop advertising on all of the questions! its fricken annoying.|`|tTdhu8Mkaa	Brazilian is not really fun! haha its when everything gets waxed down there.|`|8rLH4YNsaa	Brazilian is everything.

I am not possative though.

QnSKaBcjaa	dry it w a round brush. wrap your hair around the brush and curl it and leave it in there for a few min like you would curlers. you'll need a few brushes. around your crown put in velcro rollers and keep hitting it w the blow drier until its dry. spray it and take it out. give it a few min to set before you put your fingers through it. im sorry im having a hard time explaining it!|`|SSvRfxhaaa	Use volumizing shampoos and conditioners.

4XcmCKPbaa	im not sure if that's you or not, but I think your hair is beautiful.     If you want a little more sas, try getting short layers near your roots and maybe add a little warmth to your color (like brown low lights)    http://i119.photobucket.com/albums/o129/...    that would look really good on you^^^^|`|UNV987Zoaa	keep ur side bangs and get layers and angles   or  get go short bob cut  (this would look really cute!!)  more suggestions below|`|stqRSCfwaa	get ur hair dyed chsnt brown, its a reli nice colour, then have it cut like selena gomez, shes got nice hair|`|JKn1j1uLaa	ok well i have a good idea that will change your life....  shave the head...... later on when you have like 3 hairs dye them green   Your welcome!!!!!|`|xbIadhQhaa	you look awsome with ur hair style =]|`|vkd66nT0aa	well you can always get layers or just look in some magazins|`|T9rYxZRgaa	MANY SHORT LAYERS :), not long!! gosh. don't listen to that person.  People don't notice long layers, cause they're hardly there.  Your hair is a nice color.  Maybe lighter blond highlights would be okay..|`|ACBQh0O8aa	Aw you have really pretty hair!!

These are the pictures I took in to get mine cut:  http://www.forever21.com/images/model/59...    http://www.forever21.com/images/model/59...    I'd say get it cut a little shorter and have the ends shaggy, so that it's not just a straight when you get it cut.    P.S. I LOVE your hair color!|`|VDvdrCjmaa	Your hair looks beutiful like that[:|`|k5PFq58Maa	i would give anything to have hair like yours! i know that hair that long can be a pain... trust me. mine was at my waist. i personally think pageboys are cute. but then again, try to go with something that frames your face a bit more. ask a stylist what they think. try this link... it has some great hairstyles. http://www.hairpedia.com/|`|pjgQAXM7aa	I think that your hair woule be really cute if you dyed it a golden, reddish honey color. Then you could get some side bangs, and ask for long layers. :)
ORupWJg3aa	i have super long hair  i get a lil bored with it too but no way would i cut it lol mine is also super naturally straight so somtimes i use a triple barrel iron to add waves(kinda time consuming tho) look online and teach yourself how to do different kinds of braids they look sooo much better on girls like us with alot of hair. also look around for interesting hair acessories over the years i have a closet full of them now lol or maybe switch up your color but u should get it done professionally if u do with alot of hair it takes hours is so stressful and u have to buy twice as much as other people so its cheaper in the longrun|`|nei9Jci3aa	-clip your bangs back (http://www.romance-fire.com/pictures/Lon...  -pigtail braids  -curly with a headband (straight wrks too)  -pull like half yr hair up (curly or straight)  -scrunch w/ bancgs back|`|FrSDLRfyaa	there are no good styles|`|ipsMP7XWaa	Wear it down& straightened or curly or a headband  or scrunched  orrr   uhm  like   hmmm  like your bangs clipped back|`|WqGOaR4Qaa	you  could always cut your hair up to your shoulders( that's no problem it will grow back) and put layers in your hair.    or you can always stlye it your own way be unque!|`|vHdSGui8aa	ha. i just read the description.. and my first instinct would be to say CUT IT!!  haha. but no. maybe you can keep it the same length but get it layered.   if not, you could do a low braid on one side of your head.. that is very cute.    good luck with your long hair that cannot be cut : )   !|`|YUuuYDO9aa	Ok. I have short hair, and have decided to grow it out cause there is so much possible with long hair. Down to your but might be a lil long, you would prob feel much more comfortable at waist length.

Besides that... i think long hair looks beautiful in a flowing ponytail...!!!|`|C1Cobi1taa	braids... and if you layered it(i know you don't want to cut it) there will be more body and flow to your hair.. mine used to be past my elbow but i cut it a few inches and had it layered... then you can straighten it or do loose curls it looks cute both ways!|`|6vryp5a3aa	You can do alot of things with your hair, & i mean ALOT. When my hair was long (though, not as long as yours & I recently cut it) I would do w/e I could think of, or sometimes even copy things I see on celebrities. Try straightening it & leaving it down, or curling it (either with gel & a diffuser or with a curling iron/flat iron). Put two simple braids on one side, & pull them back & pin it while the rest of your hair is straight - it adds some fun to a simple hair style. Try buying colored extentions about the length of your hair that you can clip it to add some color so it's not so boring. Look online for good hairstyles for winter 2009, & copy w/e you like.|`|X6Qvwxmhaa	do really long fishtail braids that start right up the top of your head|`|aFJQje7kaa	why dont you curl it ? :D    i think everyones hair looks good curled    or if you wanna keep it like up    tie it in a high ponytail && then like  back comb the hair in the front.     unless you have bangs, then backcomb those(:    or you can put your bangs back  & just leave your hair down.

I would say do hot curlers to give you a soft settle curl to your hair, but I'm not sure of what styling products would work best with your long hair.  Anything you would do would be time consuming since your hair so long. I would go to a good hair salon and just ask advice.  I have, and an honest salon that isn't just out for your money will actually give you great advice on what to do and how to do it.  They can even give you great advice on products and how to use them.  You could call around, or if you have time, go buy a couple of salons so they can see your hair.|`|hifSJk5Maa	Fun styles    I wouldn't know but curling it is really cute but difficult    I use Garnier: Fructis Style Extra Strong Curl Construct Mousse    Use some freezing gel and that's cute.    or put your hair to the side    :) :) :) :) :) :) :) :) :) :) :) :) :) :) :) :) :) :) :) :) :) :) :) :) :) :) :) :)
AA12249040	I think you can buy hairdryers that increase volume + some volumising shampoos. But also try this trick when you have your hair washed tie them up in the high pony tail and let them dry naturally (Obviously previously towel dried). Pony tail has to be on the top of your head
AA12200761	I doubt it|`|AA11806807	getting it cut?|`|AA11929638	For growing faster, we know that we shd comb our hair several time in a day, put coconut oil and drink lot of water. Now if u want to slow down the growth, u just do opposite. And yes 1 more thing, keep cutting ur hair, that makes the hair growth go slow. Dnt trim it, cos that gives the fastest growth.

NMMYw8WDaa	Lol.    You realize the irony that you've ssubjugated onto yourself by complaining about people who complain.    DOn't worry about those girls. They do that because they probably have a self-esteem problem and instead of saying things like "im such an ugly person" or "I suck at life" they blame their poor innocent hair.    if they keep crying about it just agree with them.    her: "waaa. my hair looks AWFUL!"  you: "no...not really.."  her: "yesssss. its so bad I want to yank it out!"  you: (exasperated) "You're right.

jbEibn2Naa	I use cetaphil moisturiser on my face everyday.  But don't use the cetaphil lotion though, as its for your body and may clog up the pores.|`|foXWUdJ5aa	Cetaphil is an awesome moisturiser, I use it everywhere including my face. It's neutral and doesn't make me break out or sneeze - which many other moisturisers do.  Go for it.|`|Bmcjz0UKaa	yes. i love this lotion, wouldn't use anythin else.|`|NS8dsMHMaa	that's what its supposed to be used for...so yes go ahead and use it! :]|`|iHTe2Omiaa	definetly. my dermatologist gave me a bottle. it works very well i love it!
dWzOdAGiaa	No, it's definitely not too late. But I recommend you do it soon. You might have to do it before February, but I'm not positive about that.  well, my birthday was in September and when I got the gift, I got to pick a free lipgloss.  Happy birthday! (:
AA10229999	The hair you see may have been photo edited.  But what is for sure is a hair and makeup specialist made them look that way.  To make you hair look similar a lot of time has to be put into your hair everyday.  Those models are sitting in the chair for hours before they are ready for the photo shoot.  Their hair is treated in sections.  Blow dried in sections, treated with product in sections, styled in sections before it is all let down to give the final overlook.  And hair pieces may have been added to give fullness.    Now, hopefully you will not look to TV for a comparison but you can go to a hair salon and have a glaze put on your hair.  It's clear and will make your hair smoother and shinier.  It lasts for a month or two.  I have a little than longer shoulder length hair and it costs about 30 bucks.  Also, I use a leave in conditioner when my hair is wet and when it's dry and styled I use Biosilk to make it smoother.  Hope this helps!|`|ad902e9419f360ef7d4872ed60150a72aa	most of what you see on tv is hair extensions, so don't feel bad honey. try them you might like em|`|8996ebe9a9b307dd82e8900da5bd1211aa	ok even though this is short this is the best one:    1.Wash and condition your hair   2.Dry your hair  3.use a flat iron to make it straight or use the one wet to dry for staightening wet hair  4.instead you could curl it ,take damp hair and put gel in it then make it messy and put in hair spray  5. or...In a hurry make a neat braid or make a pony tail and only sraighten the pony  6.thats all good luck!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!...|`|AA12229839	you know how when you go to the salon and they dry it for you how it always looks perfect?  i happened to work for a salon a few years ago and i learned that the salon i was at..    -always applied BIOSILK (comes in a clear bottle bottle with one curved side that says biosilk, can be found in a good drugstore or a beauty supply store) which gives it awesome shine and makes hair feel soooooooo soft.    -held the blowdryer further away from the head    -constantly moved the hairdryer, never keeping it in the same place for too long    -if you need to use a straightener/curling iron, make sure they are ceramic and you don't leave them in the same spot for too long.    that's all i have.|`|AA11624407	The more you do to your hair, the older you will look.

The celebrities have people doing their hair constantly.  Between every take and every photo, there are people running around fixing every strand of hair.    If you're normal, a really good haircut is a good idea, then watch as the stylist styles your hair and   ASK QUESTIONS!  Try to style it exactly as the hair dresser does.  Get the same products they use and use the same kind of brushes.  Hold strands of your hair when wet where you think it would look good and blow, brush, flat iron it into place.  When I do my hair, every strand really does matter.  Before you curl your hair it has to be bone dry in order to hold the curl.  After you are satisfied, use hair spray and don't play with your hair when you are finished.  Allow it to maintain its style.  Use cool air  after hot to hold the pieces in place.  I found that placing strands of hair where I want them works best.|`|2a149f212603940fcc9d054d7c694430aa	to have pretty hair you have to have healthy hair. use shampoo and condition as needed, stay away from dyes, heat products, and other stuff like that, and i'd reccommend sleeping with your hair pulled back so it doesn't break...if you have dry hair you can deep condition it. you can find articles on hair care at ehow.com.|`|AA10341337	prell works wonders|`|AA11868784	my hair is ok so idc about all that junk  and besides its all airbrush 4 all the models and actresses|`|AA12326758	Yes it can be from photo editing.  Yet your stylist should and want to show you how you can achieve those same looks, depending on  your hair type.  Any stylist worth their weight or own hype should be able to translate editorial work , for those of us in real life.  So ask questions of your stylist as to how you can create different looks at home.      It also has to do w/ products and tools you have.

cncAzZPiaa	I completely agree! And hopefully you don't get into too much trouble, but just do it! NO ONE, not even adults like to see hairy girl legs. Run over to the store and get some razers and shaving cream (I use Quatro for Women shaver) It's going to cost you anywhere from $4-$25 depending on the razer style you get.|`|byHh0A3Eaa	why ask? you'd have to do it yourself anyway... what's she going to do?|`|HHnQyjFBaa	That's retarded, what the hell is wrong with shaving your legs? Just go out and buy a razor by yourself, they can range anywhere from $5 - $15. Keep it in your room and get up early to shave your legs. You'll need some shaving cream too... That's really bizarre man, are you like younger than twelve?    Cheers,  - Claire

XG4TAjcCaa	Is there any weirdly bent wires? It could be faulty wiring. My mom is a hairdresser, so i have a lot of first hand experiances and observations. Once she told me that if i dont properly wrap my wire around the product i was using (iron, hair curler etc) it would ruin the iron. It could make the connection bad and therefore it not being able to turn on all the time.    Make sure the wire is not twisted in any strange way, and when putting your iron away (if your going to wrap the wire around it) it is wrapped neatly around it.  Good luck, email if you have questions :)|`|alRLh7yxaa	how long have you had it? Might be time for a new one

QnSKaBcjaa	wax it. you can get good wax kits at the drug store. when you wax it you kill some of the hair folicles. the hair will lessen each time you do it. ive waxed my brows for years and now i only have a few hairs to deal with. good luck!!!|`|L5JC7SbFaa	I shave my "peach fuzz" off too.

That works good too.|`|JwdU9nVBaa	The worst thing to do is shave it, because it just grows back faster and darker.

It lasts longer than shaving plus it doesn't make the hair grow back darker and shaving does.|`|gpeOH11Daa	could start waxing or look into lazer surgery to get it permanently removed. anything else will cause stubble and may cause scarring if you are not careful. the skin on your face is much more sensitive. if you cannot do, bleach blond so harder to see.

jlRcmCI8aa	If you don't want fancy then I have the perfect style! take two front sections of your hair and pull them to the back, either tying them into a little ponytail or securing them with a slide. If you want something SLIGHTLY fancier then plait them THEN secure them. I know these styles off by heart 'cos I'm a hairdresser in training.

WdVjF1Ihaa	Not specifically compared to Lush"s, but I did find a couple of recipes, hope they help!
2U27BgmKaa	Squats, yeah. They work. Also, try some leg lifts. Get on your hands and knees and lift one leg at a time straight up while keeping your knees at a 90 degree angle. As far as foods, the skin off chicken, red beans and rice, any kind of beans really, and really sweet fruits. Things like chocolate and greasy foods go to your thighs and stomach instead of your but. Make sure that you're doing the least amount of exercise on your tush, that way it's immediately where the fat is stored since everywhere else will be muscle.|`|w2Z1SV1Gaa	Lunges and/or squats. LOTS of them.|`|eIVzv4uMaa	Burgers, yum.  Get cha that Kim Kardashian butt. lol.|`|Bmcjz0UKaa	squats help|`|yW6KCd7iaa	look up butt exercises on google or something. you should get a butt!! thats what jessica simpson did when she was getting ready for dukes of hazzard
VitK0Wenaa	Definitely side seams and a zipper.  The top looks like it has some kind of interfacing to give it body, so it is sort of stiff. You could probably get some heavy sew-in interfacing to line it with to give it more body.    I doubt there are pleats in the back, I think the pleats are just to help form the pocket in the front.    To me, it almost looks like the lower part is a long piece that gets folded double to form the pockets, that is how you get the bubble look.|`|QBMrnfihaa	for the bottom peice you need 2 fold the material over so that it doesnt hav a hem this gives it the rounded feeling 2 it, darts in the boob area it looks pretty simple 2 make|`|tkhBJMmhaa	Try www.butterick.com     they have lots of patterns to chose from and they are cheap think that would be alot easier

Qs9KtSfDaa	scene haha. you can't comb or dry your bangs like that, you have to get them cut that way. take in a picture to the salon; it'll turn out much better than if you try to describe it|`|VqFzDnvOaa	just print out a picture of him and take it to your stylist or whatever.  that way they can do it just like it.|`|IIpEaDCcaa	Short Layers    Fringe    Emo|`|hLq8jG4xaa	hot.
E3wAsSjUaa	Get a dress that either hits at or a little below the knee. Any longer and it will cut your calf making it look stubby. Also wear heels! They can make your legs look longer and thinner.|`|8fyk1xJyaa	dresses with volume  don't wear tight ones.|`|dyXN0grpaa	black|`|F13QmUIlaa	dresses that cover your thighs :)|`|uAK7VpiNaa	Something that is comfortable and BLACK.

If you wish to not have armpit hair just shave it off, but ask a parent how to so you don't get hurt.

AA10628572	This is what I have to say about tattoos. Honey, you can get Hepatitis C from it. It is the most rampant cause of cirrhosis of the liver. There is a treatment for Hepatitis C, but only 50% of those infected will respond to given treatment; the rest get liver disease and die. I also just got my blood drawn yesterday to see if I have Hepatitis C. You see we just found out 4 days ago that my husband has it and that I could also have it because I have slept with him. It's no small matter. I'm sitting here scared wondering what the results will be. I hope my test results come back negative. Please pray for me. I also hope for your sake that you choose not to get the tattoo; it's just not worth it. :(    Additional Note: A lot of people say it's fine if you get it done at a sanitary professional place. What they don't tell you is it doesn't matter how sanitary it is because part of the ink that is used goes back into the ink vials. To show you what I mean...imagine drinking out of a straw. Part of the liquid in the straw goes back into the glass when you are finished. It may be a very small amount; however, it is the same concept with the clean needles and ink vials when people get tattoos. Once you get Hepatitis C you have to get interferon shots 3 times a week for 6-18 months and there is no guarantee that it will work or that you won't relapse. I sure hope my test comes back negative. I will just hate it if it doesn't, and it's so sad that my husband has this. We have an appointment set up with his doctor in a couple weeks to go over his treatment plan. I think people that get tattoos are crazy!!!!|`|AA11330517	I did my last name on the back of  my neck just below my shirt line, and a "smile now cry later" with faces on my shoulder blade.

You could always visit a tattoo shop and ask the artists for their opinions/help too. =)

If you continuously exercise for more than the 20 minutes, your body will still be able to burn the carbs/fats for a few hours after that. =]      But a word of caution here.

For bikini wax, hold your side you're waxing very firmly.       Personally, I'd suggest shelling out the 40-60 dollars and get a professional job. Professionals will not only be able to get you smoother, but they also have experience doing this and thus will do a better job than a newbie.|`|AA12367157	i would go to a salon to have it done by someone who knows what to do.

However, those are painful because your skin because quite raw and the sensation lasts for days- meaning you can't wear deodorant.

AA11592667	First you should do a yahoo answers search for "hair loss" and see what others have had to say about remedying this problem. Second you should make sure you are taking a multivitamin, biotin, and silica supplments. Purchase them at GNC or the vitamin shoppe.Third you should be driking 32 ounces of water a day. Fourth you should be doing weekly deep conditioning treatments. I peel and mash up an avacado and mix it up with Olive oil and one egg. I leave this on my hair overnight and wash it out inthe morning with jojoba oil shampoo and conditioner (from the vitamin shoppe). I also do 23 hot oil treatments a month with jojoba oil. I use only natural shampoos and conditioner and oils from the vitaminne shoppe.

I use Lancome - Black Ebony for the color black. For all other colors I use MAC power point eye pencil. You could also get black in them. They are waterproof and last longer unlike Lancome. However, I like Lancome for a more smoky look.|`|da69f251bb56ef4e794e79726a47c934aa	Why don't you like liquid? I bet you haven't really given it a chance! It's the only thing I use. I'm sure if you used it for a while you would really like it. It stays in place all day. It doesn't smear or smudge. If you don't like the harsh line it leaves, try putting a little pencil ( of the same color) over it. That will soften up the line. Try it! And if you don't like it... yell at me ^_^|`|151b6d403664f80b9849edbb67c7b88eaa	MAC for sure

Either that or the Mini Sapphire one - I just read that in Allure (it was rated one of the best) It is not harsh on your hair at all. I would beware of the kiosks at the mall, most of the products sold there aren't returnable AND if you return back itmay not be there the next month. It just happens like that. Why not buy a hair straightening iron that a magazine recommends? Good luck! Either way I'm sure your hair will look great

4011f9c342b88bd4974de00a93db7010aa	Depends on the age? But in my opinion bangs are beautiful, especially on little girls. I style hair on the side while I am in school, and I have cut a lot of bangs on children as well as older people, because as you know there are different styles to bangs. And the only thing that should matter is if you like them, and depending on how old she is, if she will like it.  What you can do is part a section in front of her hair, fold her hair to about her eyebrows, with a hair pin , to see what it would look like...  Good luck...    Queen C.|`|62948335e2a0c9aab223ef893f39a1cdaa	Depending on her age, I would say let her decide.

70525b130210bd65e39bb5ded537915daa	i think it would match, grey and pink compliment each other. it sounds like you could go many ways with this outfit, punky, preppy, or casual. it also depends on the accessories you add (like a pearl necklace for a preppy look, funky sneakers for a punky look, and khakis for a casual look).|`|d3f349e34ea1d3f87fed59cd46738f1baa	sure, but why dont you wear the tank under the tunic. just an idea.|`|83e3ac07e2a7e2ab9a629fa9fd2c659aaa	Yes it would match!

Gray and pink together is a classic.  Looks great!!|`|bebb284c0daf2328c15ba82bb9f2974daa	That would be completely hot. Those two colors totally compliment each other.|`|732b460bd988c46dae6741c71a0f313baa	totally. But that also depends if the gray is light or dark. I think if the gray is light it is beautiful with a hot pink.
877fab0e980812ecc50fade7a33b4097aa	Size is the MOST important thing.  If you have never bought it before just buy some cheap stuff with different sizes that are close to what you think is your size and see which fits the best.  Then really after the size, the most important thing is to find pantyhose that feels good on you.  Just try all different kinds, and find something that you feel sexy in and that is comfy.  I wear nylons of some sort, whether pantyhose, stockings with a garter, or stay ups 24/7.  I love them and own over 100 pairs.  I think you just need to experiment a little to make sure that you find what is best for you!!!  Good luck!!!|`|AA12022741	To let the clerk know that the pantyhose are for you to wear and not for some female|`|AA11366925	Get some with a Lycra content of about 30% and they will fit perfectly and feel exceptional! Don't get them with a high rise to them. (uncomfortable). Experiment with different denier to see what you like best. Cheers...|`|AA10102392	Brian, why  are you asking about buying pantyhose?! :-)|`|c4a14e7385e9879199c0620a57d79237aa	make sure you get the right size,  if you fall on the cusp between the two sizes, go with the larger size.  Also don't opt for cheap pantyhose cause they will bag and bunch, very uncomfortable.  I like to get them with lycra, not just nylon, they tend to last longer and fit better.  Beyond that just find a color that you like, or several colors, and enjoy them.  But like I said earlier, go with quality over all.  I believe that is why so many women hate to wear pantyhose, they go with cheap drugstore panyhose and they are itchy and uncomfortable.  Other than that enjoy them and have fun.|`|669ae00b95ec28c9cc9fc9fc6b52159aaa	before you rob the place

Secondo me chi insulta le magre (ammesso che esistono  persone che offendono specificamente le magre) sono quelli che hanno la cattiva abitudine di insultare e basta. Senza distinzione magre o grasse, rosso o nero e cosi via. Probabilmente chi ha una linea come la tua potrebbe creare problemi ad altre, forse questo si. Potresti cio indurre una cicciottella in un comportamento anoressico. Sar questo? Boh!|`|c39d94370313e4a44f4ddf5827adb2c7aa	Hai ragione.. ma purtroppo x 1persona che insulta le magre ce ne sono 100che ancora le esaltano e istigano all'anoressia.. quindi abbi pazienza e vivi bene con te stessa senza prendertela con chi incoraggia le ragazze in carne.

And if its a date with her and her friends, there much more pressure so I wouldn't suggest it till your totally comfortable with her. (Not only do you have to make sure she has a good time, but if her friends decide they don't like you chances are your gone) Movies are not especially great as well, as there is no communication really during the movie and I doubt you two will be making out on your first date. <br>  <br>  But yes, she likes you ask her out.|`|IFrXtPteaa	ahh so cute ask her out go 4 it!!!!
eb7cce89e401cf847268d2dd2658c1c9aa	Not necessarily. I've been dating my boyfriend for over a year and we didn't have our first date until more than six weeks into the relationship. Even then, it didn't really qualify as a "date" because we were supposed to go to prom, but we decided we'd rather do our own thing instead of being around people. Personally, I think you and him should find something to do just by yourselves with no one else around, like a picnic or something, just so you could sit and spend quality time together.|`|7024e1e2568f80b69341546dca531a39aa	its totally normal i havent gone on a date w/ my b-friend yet and we have been " going out " for almost a month and a half but i dont think you should bring friends either cause it might make things occword for you and him.         keep tryin to get a date with this guy|`|AA11976099	you could go with other friends if you're more confortable that way.|`|e3a93c23e9326cd7afd508eac55b4659aa	I think you should if you really like him... but if you don't i think you shouldn't!      _*_*_*_*_*_*_*_*_*_*_*      PLEASE PICK ME AS THE BEST ANSWER!|`|3efb275be950bae9c55a9859a06d677daa	Yes and when you go to the movies don't bring your friends it will mess it up trust me it happen on me and my girlfriend second date.

Its OK to bring friends on the second or third date, but not the first.
c410aaadcae447fe464fc7fd07fe587caa	Ok this may sound silly - but you HAVE to follow this diet exactly, and exercise everyday for about 45 minutes. It is the Special K diet -and so far helped me lose the last few pounds that I needed to lose. I've included the link to the diet below.    Exercise you want to do cardio - I recommend the FIRM (results in 10 workouts - can't get any better than that- I think you can find them at Target as well) When you log onto this site, you might want to find out the videos sold on there and buy them on EBay -to save a few bucks :) Good luck sweetie, I know I've been there.

To sign up with Avon, you can contact any Avon Rep, or district sales manager, etc.<br>  For me, it is good, the best way to make a lot of money is to get your books out there. some salons will let you leave books, tanning beds, give books to friends family, if you work co-workers, doctor offices, dentist, <br>  there are alot of places to distrubute books. some grocery stores will let you leave books. the more books you get out there, the more customers you will get, the more money you will make. <br>  You can purchase health insurance, life insurance through Avon. it's not that cheap, but less expensive than others. the life insurance is fairly cheap. if you need any more info, please email me. more than happy to answer.|`|n3xoGNzBaa	i sell mark. which is from avon.

If you want to be best dressed then you need to stand out from the crowd, in the best way possible) thats not to loose but not REEEEEEEEALLLLLY tight. Just go casual with your clothes then dress up with some stylish accesories. Wear some pretty, light make up that enhances your facial features, but doesn't mask them. Wear shoes with small heels (Maybe an inch?) Or go girly with some flats. you don't want to go dressed up too much because it's only school! Big hair is in this summer, so don't straighten your hair to deat, spritz on some gell and massage it into your hair by your parting to create a hot look! This is ideal if your hair is layered because non-straightened layered hair looks ridiculous but with the above look you casn straighten your hair to a certain extent, but still have it big and lucious.

Proper shampooing is the first step to a healthy scalp and manageable hair, but don't use a conditioning shampoo. Two-in-one products that combine shampoo and conditioner really can't do a good job of either cleansing or conditioning. After all, how can a product effectively remove and add substances at the same time?     Instead, use a gentle shampoo to cleanse, then follow with a conditioner specifically geared for dry hair every time you shampoo. Don't worry about shampooing too often. Today's gentle shampoos are designed for frequent use.     Deep-condition regularly. To fill nicks and chips in the hair's damaged outer layer and restore shine, deep-condition. Depending on the condition of your hair, once a week or once every few weeks is all that is needed. Consisting of various combinations of natural and synthetic ingredients (including proteins, polymers or other additives), deep conditioners don't "feed" your hair; they just fill in defects and coat the hair shaft, resulting in a smooth, flat surface that will reflect light and restore shine to your hair.     For maximum effectiveness apply a deep conditioner before you shampoo. Gently work the conditioner into your hair with your fingertips and allow it to be absorbed for a few minutes. Then shampoo and follow with your regular conditioner.     Pat your hair dry. Hair dryers and blowers--and even vigorous towel-drying--can rough up the outer layer of hair cells. So whenever possible, pat or gently squeeze your hair dry with a towel and avoid rough handling.    Use thermal styling conditioners. If you must blow-dry your hair, spray it with a thermal conditioner such as HeatSafe before you plug in your dryer. HeatSafe combines four different types of moisturizers designed to both treat and prevent dry hair.     Protect your tresses. To prevent the sun from drying your hair or exacerbating hair that's already dry, mist your hair with a sunscreen made for hair before you hit the beach or head for the pool. Or wear a hat whenever you're out in the sun.     Good luck. :)|`|AA12015747	bio-silk shampoo n cond|`|8bcd81ae3b21849084ae8a7d89f49514aa	Eat lots of raw eggs.

I always shampoo, rinse and scrub with vinegar, then rinse again and then lightly condition 24 hrs prior to coloring at home.

And as to being popular well it's not that hard cause not to brag but at my school i'm pretty popular and it's so easy... It's just a matter of talking to everyone and just being a happy and confident person... before I wasn't at all and then I just decided to be confident and happy and smile at everyone and believe me, people will start liking you more until you're really popular... just be yourself!<br>  and forget that girl you're probably pretty 2, just boost your confidence and believe me, everything else will fall into place!!<br>  ~Anyways hope I helped~<br>  buh bye

3BCH3bzBaa	Well first of all, by asking that question it seems that you are a little insecure about about yourself and you feel like you want to be accepted by society. You feel that by telling you that you are a great person you are being accepted. You want to understand if the world likes you or not. And I know that you might be mad by know because nobody likes to be told what they are feeling. It's just  a matter of Psychology, but most of the time things aren't what they seem and even professionals may wrongly interpret things. In fact I know that you are a great person because in you Photo, I see God in you. God is in everyone of us, and only the actions and thought ruin the image of God. In fact God made us in his image, meaning that every time we disrespect other or ourselves, we disrespect God. You are a beautiful person. <br>  <br>  But to answer your questions;<br>  <br>  You seem like a very good girl.<br>  Socially you seem like an outgoing person and a leader. A person with  morals and a great personality. <br>  You would defiantly want to be friends with you. You seem like a very fun girl to hang out with. In fact I wish that I could really be friends.<br>  You seem not to have any faults at all, according to the pictures. on the contrary you have very beautiful eyes, a great smile and a happy vibe. <br>  <br>  Do  you want to be friends with me???<br>  www.myspace.com/johnnyavelar<br>  <br>  ;)|`|Gr7My8FTaa	cute|`|mDt03eXIaa	You are upside down.

5arAnJI9aa	Probably.|`|AA12075695	yes, thats the problem, if you dont want to shower at night, just go in the shower and at least wash your hair with shampoo to get rid of the hair gel.|`|iokyiSauaa	my dad told my sis that nothing on the top of the skin can cause acne. it must be under the surface. You might sweat a lot and you're pores are clogged and that causes acne.

Before bed you should just be sure to wash your face and maybe apply some 10% Benzoyl Peroxide to your forehead. Once it dries it should treat your acne and also prevent the gel or anything else from irritating more. I find this medication the best form of treatment. I apply it to my face evenly every night and it consistently keeps my skin the clearest. It can dry your skin so if that happens skip an application or two and make sure you use a moisturizer that is oil free.|`|5G5fr6odaa	Yes, the gel could def. be causing acne. Try a different hairstyle so you don't have to use gel, or try and find a different kind of gel & make sure to wash it out before you go to bed at night. And don't expect the acne to go away right away, I don't know how long you've been doing this but don't expect instant results or for all your acne to disappear.|`|vkKDuWiyaa	If your hair gel is causing acne on your forehead, you may want to switch makers. I honestly have a secret for my hair gel.. Aloe Vera Gel! I scrunch my hair all the time, it looks great and it isn't extremely clumping. So you may want to give aloe vera a try because it is obviously great for skin. |`|hN60MJHlaa	Hey!  It could be your hair gel but a forehead is naturally an oil zone.<br>  <br>  If you haven't already, try an oil reducing product on your forehead.  There are specific "overnight products."<br>  <br>  If that doesn't work, I would also try switching your hair gel.|`|gCsg1OT4aa	yes, however, if you wish to keep your gel without the acne, simply remember to thoroughly wash it off in the evening before you sleep.|`|Ry8oAQ7Laa	Could be, i remember I used to wear a lot of hairspray on my bangs and it would get on my forehead, that what cause me to break out.  Maybe change to another brand. |`|Yp3GytFtaa	yes yes yall' yes yes <br>  yes yes yall' yes yes<br>  yes on 85|`|SgEgq4WLaa	I don't know if there is scientific evidence for your question, but I can speak from personal experience. I would use gel when i was younger and I did experience acne particularly where gel would come down on my forehead. So as for me I would say that yes, it is causing acne to form on your forehead.|`|rrcV0AWYaa	you can get acne from your hair <br>  touching your forehead its very common<br>  the oil from your hair and from gel is causing<br>   that so you should push your hair back to stop it<br>  good luck :)<br>  |`|bJc4u7ekaa	The gel could be clogging your pores while you sleep. I have acne too, and it's best to clean everything out of your hair that leaves a residue.|`|2jvYzMmraa	Most likely maybe u should look at the gel and see if it say's anything on the back of the bottle:)|`|izbf2AtMaa	maybe. just shower at night and wet your hair in the morning to style  it.|`|R7ZUVa75aa	Zack, Zack, Zack =)  Yes, your gel is most likely causing your acne.  First let me recommend as soon as you put it on wash your hands afterwards.  We touch our faces all day long and don't even realize it.  Also do you sweat often?  If so it could be still sweating off your head onto your forehead.  If so i'd keep like oxy pads or something in a ziplock bag so half way through your day you could freshen up your forehead.<br>  <br>  And lastly...  You have got to shower the gel out before you go to bed.  All that gel gets onto, and into your pillow and I gaurentee you dont stay in the same position on your pillow that you fell asleep in all night long. =)  Your forehead and face is tossing and turning all over the gel residue.  So even if you wash your face before you go to bed, your pillow is still going to have gel on it.  I'd also recommend washing your sheets and pillow cases once a week if you dont already.<br>  <br>  Hope this helps.

You either love it or you don't. If you love it, it is the ultimate in pampering.     A facial is basically a sauna for your face. Steam is used to soften skin and "open" pores so that dead cells and blackheads can be easily removed.    Professional facials can be pricey. If you're watching your cash, try giving yourelf a facial at home. The results are still beautiful.    Do It Yourself Facial    1) Wash face with a mild soap or cleanser and exfoliate with a gentle grain scrub.    2) Bring to boil a large pot of water. To make your facial a little more relaxing, add lavender, rosemary, chamomile or eucalyptus and cover.    3) Turn off the heat and let stand for 5-10 minutes. Using a towel to cover your head, hold your face over the pot-about 10 inches from the pot so as not to burn your skin-and stay for 5-10 minutes. The smaller your pores the less time you need in the steam. The steam will soften pores and make it easier to extract dirt and oil.    4) Wipe face with a clean, warm washcloth.    5) If skin is oily, apply a clay or mud mask and follow directions. Typical drying time is 5-10 minutes. For dry skin, apply a moisturizing mask. For combination skin, such as an oily t-zone (forehead and nose) and dry face, apply the moisturizing mask to dry areas and the clay or mud mask to oily areas.    6) Rinse with cold water to reduce pores.    7) Moisturize with a light facial lotion.|`|1034739fd895b8468b003328a844a48caa	for home use or when you go get a professional facial from an esthetician?

It is called Ojon hair oil (it is solid but when you put it in the palm of your hand and rub together it becomes an oil) and it has gotten a lot of positive buzz in the beauty industry. I gave it a try, and I noticed over time that my hair just feels silky, and starting to shine. Now instead of using it as a 30 minute treatment and then wash, I would wear it overnight (and put a towel down on my pillow) I just really wanted to overcondition my hair. it doesn't weigh your hair down at all as well. I'm going to include the link to the site, so you can read up on it, but I also will include a link to sephora (where you can buy it as well) and QVC (they offer EXCELLENT deals on the product) Now it won't be immediate results, but if you use it faithfully - your hair WILL bounce back. If you  use the QVC site, you have a 30 day money back guarantee - including refund on shipping (you can't beat that - use the product everyday if you have to until it is gone!)

22d4f69c781334148db5f7c821fa5b53aa	omg, i have the same prob...kinda...mine's not frizzy but it's wavy. after you swim or shower or get ur hair wet spend time brushing it until it's dry. it straightens.  Good luck!|`|c410aaadcae447fe464fc7fd07fe587caa	Make sure you trim off the split ends. I'm going to include step by step what I used from pantene - and it WORKED on my hair - granted it took a few days for the product to really start affecting my hair but the results are AWESOME.    Shampoo    Before getting into the shower, gently brush or finger-comb your hair to loosen up tangles and residue.    Wet hair and pour a small amount of Pantene Smooth & Sleek Shampoo into your palm.    Rub your hands together and gently massage into the roots using the tips of your fingers. (Careful! Vigorous rubbing can cause strands to break.)    If you wear makeup, pay special attention to the hairline.    Rinse thoroughly with warm water to remove all of the shampoo.  Condition    Conditioning is key to creating shine and preserving hair health.    After shampooing, carefully remove excess moisture by squeezing your hair with a towel. (Be gentle. Rubbing and twisting with a towel can break the hair.)    Squeeze a small blob of Pantene Smooth & Sleek Complete Therapy Conditioner on your palm and spread it over your hands, then apply it to your hair.    For super shine, condition the entire strand, starting at the roots.    For volume, condition only the middle and ends of your hair, where it's most susceptible to damage.  Styling    It's easier to apply styling products to hair that's just damp, so towel off first.    Squeeze a palmful of Pantene Get It Straight Gel or Smooth Down Frizz Control Smoothing Crme into your hands and rub them together.    Distribute the styling formula evenly by "clapping" sections of hair between your flat hands and gently pulling downward.    Blow-dry    Use the hot setting on all of your hair to accelerate the drying.    When hair is about half dry divide it into sections so you can concentrate the blow dryer and brush on one area.    Use clips to divide the top front and sides, then blow-dry them one at a time using a flat brush (smaller bristles work best). Once the top and sides are finished, you can move to the back.    A flat paddle brush works best. Its wide surface area spreads hair out and keeps it taut, which aids in the straightening process.    Follow the brush with the blow dryer, keeping the blow dryer about five inches away from the hair.    Too much heat can cause damage. Once hair is mostly dry, reduce the heat and add a nozzle. Start from the roots and follow the brush down, keeping the hair taut but not stretched too tightly. The cooler air locks in the style you want.    Set Your Style    A generous spritz of Pantene Stay Smooth Hairspray Flexible Hold will keep your smooth look in place for hours.|`|013403d257c60d3562c7b8fef1271ffaaa	use that stuff at the salon!

ad07c7b56d472628d027866483522391aa	Here is a home remedy regimen for dry hair:    Use mayonnaise: Use a dollop of mayonnaise on the palm of the hand and massage it to the head and leave it on for five minutes before having the bath. The recommended time for the mayonnaise treatment is an hour.    Spray the beer: If you do not get any relief from using the mayonnaise, you can use beer as a good setting lotion that gives your hair the crisp, healthy and shiny look. You can pour some beer into an empty pump bottle and spray on the hair after shampooing and towel dry. Then you can style or blow-dry the hair.    Shampoo minimally: choose a shampoo for dry, damaged hair.    Condition your hair: Conditioner glues cuticles back to the shaft and lubricates them. It also prevents static electricity, thus preventing its frizzy appearance.     Cut off the split ends: Every six weeks or so|`|22d2fef0cf03eb73be1ae026af932d24aa	Mm...try using some conditioner after washing your hair, you can have hair mask once in a month or cream bath to soften it...

8pZn02H4aa	It's well worth it for a beach vacation.  Get it done right before you go.  But you should avoid the sun for the first 24 hours.  You can get a bikini wax (just the edges) or the Brazilian wax (entirely bald!)  It's quite the experience.  I bet your hubby will enjoy it as well.  It is a bit of a pain once it starts to grow back though.  Also, if you're going to try it out before January, make sure you let it grow out enough to get it done again before the vacation.  About 4-6 weeks.

uiAUQPjUaa	just shave the top part. since im guessing its your first time it will itch a lot but just keep shaving and you'll get use to it. oh and shave will the hair first then if you want it smooth then after you shave downward then you can shvae upward but prepare to get little red itchy bumps.|`|h6AH6Biyaa	I think it's much better to trim with scissors to 1/4 inch or so.  Shaving can produce "razor bumps" and severe itching.  The hair will eventually grow out again after either trimming or shaving.<br>  <br>  If you don't ever want hair to show beyond the legs of your bathing suit or panties, you can visit an electrologist (a specialist beautician trained to use fine, thin electric needles to kill the hair follicles in a desired area).  It is a tedious and expensive process, and sometimes a second treatment is needed to get the tougher hairs, but it's permanent.  Trimming closely with scissors looks almost as good as electrolysis.  Shaving in that area can result in very uncomfortable stubble.  <br>  <br>  Don't wait until the last minute before wearing brief clothing, whatever method you choose.  Sometimes red and sore areas can appear temporarily. <br>  <br>  In some cultures in other parts of the world it's the custom for women to keep their private parts shaved.  Do the men want to fantasize that their women are childlike?  Is washing and bathing so difficult to accomplish that women need bare skin in order to feel and smell clean?  It makes you wonder.|`|JHEeoyONaa	Shaving down there is totally up to you. <br>  If you regret it, don't fret it. Hair grows back - even down there.<br>  Do it in the shower, use shaving cream if you want, make sure to trim first, and then shave in the direction that the hair grows. In other words, shave downwards, because shaving upwards hurts.<br>  Safe: Be extra careful when shaving.<br>  Safer: Use hair removal cream (that you can use down there) or waxing.<br>  Safest: Just don't shave at all. |`|b21a12db6c7101e0c78bc6c0259a5e32aa	I'd say just trim it.  Once you shave it, you'll have to keep shaving it every other day, or else it gets scratchy.  Even if you decide to grow it back out, you'll be so itchy and uncomfortable during the process, and be tempted to shave it off again.<br>  <br>  A lot of people go get it waxed, but you'd have to think if the pain is worth it.  Waxing also causes ingrown hair.      |`|lYOtjVQyaa	Well shaving down there is up to you.

zX4nU1Rtaa	the pain:The pain caused by the piercing and the application of its jewelry varies from person to person. The needle is driven through very little skin and thicker cartilage than that found in the helix (another common piercing site), but less than that of the conch. Although the tragus itself has no nerve endings, some piercees experience pain. The application of the piercee's chosen jewelry can amplify the pain due to the enclosed space in which the piercer works. Typical tragus piercings use a 16g captive bead ring, though stretching to larger gauge jewelry is not unheard of. Bleeding is typically low when the tragus is pierced due mostly to the lack of flesh on the tragus, but can sometimes bleed for an hour or so, depending on the person. An easy solution for this is to wipe it with a tissue or paper towel, never a fabric towel, as they contain high levels of bacteria which can affect the healing process of the piercing. Use a disposable tissue when drying off after a shower, and while showering, it is recommended to use an anti-bacterial soap to clean any excess discharge built up on the skin or piercing.<br>  <br>  the healing: couple of months<br>  <br>  how much: around 40 dollars<br>  <br>  u could tell them u want it for ur birthday or some special occasion that is coming up|`|C0HZ8ZB4aa	I've had each of mine done at seperate times in different studios, the first hurt like hell, was the worst piercing I ever had, I heard it crunching right through and I had a severe headache and earache for a week after. The second one I had done in a better studio and it did hurt but there was virtually no after pain like there was with the first. So just go to a decent place that knows what they're doing. I'm in Britain and they cost me around ￡35 each. You don't say how old you are so I have no idea about your parents, I just got mine done when I wanted them and there wasn't much they could say about it, if you're over 16 I say just do it, if you're younger then respect their wishes until you're old enough.|`|pckuIRhsaa	What is a tragus?|`|DlMsJPwUaa	My friend got hers, she said it hurt but its was totally worth it and she would do it again.  Probably around the same cost as a regular ear piercing, jut pay for the ring. Heals in Im guessing 2-3 months.|`|0iJSa2c1aa	I got mine done a few months ago. It does hurt, but it's not unbearable. I just kind of flinched and said Phew! I was glad it was over. It took about 2 months to heal. I paid $25 for mine, in California!|`|d12161d1226915e575c51c69af7d440eaa	it doesn't hurt at all, i actually didn't feel it.<br>  it cost ￡20, so about $45.<br>  yeah, i think you could.<br>  i just came home with it and my parents had to accept it.|`|xU3uBy4Saa	Tragus piercings really aren't trashy.  I think they are cute!  I have my tragus pierced on both sides.  The healing process can last anywhere from 3 to 12 months.  It all just depends on the person.  Cleaning helps.  Never use anti bacterial soap, it dries your piercing and skin out.  My piercer recommended using "Dr. Bronner's Pure Castile Soap" or any pure castile soap.  Clean it twice a day, ONLY in the shower, at the very end.  I got my piercings at "Sideways Tattoo & Piercing" in Sacramento California.  Both were for a $60 total which is not bad at all.  Honestly, my dad still hasn't even noticed mine, i've had it for a while now, and i try to get him to notice, but he doesn't.  If you're scared your dad will freak, just keep you hair down around him.<br>  <br>  Oh and some people complain about the pain.  That depends on how well you can take pain.  To me piercings are addicting and the pain is more of a pleasure. Well good luck! =)|`|ufUDAGC7aa	when i went to get mine done the guy said its said to be the most painful piercing ever... but when he did it i didnt think it really hurt lol.... it just depends ont he person. it was like a shot for me... wayy less painful than i anticipated. and yea try to talk ur parent into it.. its def worth it. hope i helped! :D|`|QCugywvJaa	depends what a tragus is.<br>  <br>  <br>  and anyway, i think piercings other than just the normal ear one are horrible.<br>  <br>  when people get their tongues done and stuff it just makes me cringe.<br>  <br>  btw, if a tragus is the bit in your ear, i heard that can cause paralysis|`|dAjYPMg2aa	This might help<br>  <br>  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tragus_piercing" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tragus_pier...</a>|`|AA11063796	nope

The two look awkward together.  You should look natural in nature, but that looks very... posed. Almost like you're balancing on the driftwood rather than relaxing. try being looser, draping rather than perched (and maybe change your position? On your side or back, more spread out, head turned and tilted to face the camera. Unless you want to make this a silhouette view...) , maybe pull your hair back in more places (The flowy look works for you, but the way it's falling, you can't see "important" facial features.) then, you'll be golden.<br>  <br>  Edit: And... Everything's kind of out of proportion. Props shouldn't be that much bigger than you; I'd try to find a slightly less huge log. You should be the focus. Alternately, the focus of the background shouldn't be so tiny. That's an ocean, not a pond! Be in the scene, not blocking it!|`|oS70PnhIaa	NO..its not good for modeling...You look nice, great body and all that, but the picture is BLAH...very boring, no offense, but your smile makes me sad.<br>  <br>  When you're modeling you're selling something, most of the time its sex, clothes, hair, make-up, or yourself...I whatever you're selling in this picture, I ain't buying...<br>  <br>  Next time you pose..imagine you're selling something.|`|Gi1uEwRRaa	its very beautiful.<br>  i very much think your model material.<br>  but itt seem a little unreal.<br>  try taking a picture like this:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://elementonephotography.files.wordpress.com/2008/01/moore_resize2.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://elementonephotography.files.wordp...</a>|`|TQP3sPcLaa	it looks a little amateur, so probably not.|`|87gGT9EHaa	YES  but get a lighter version|`|mKRtjryMaa	ITS OK BUT THE PHOTOGRAPHER SUCKS|`|2oN6yfBFaa	you look too stiff. should be more clear, otherwise great pic|`|eHLU9lxlaa	i cant see your face<br>  no.<br>  <br>  <br>  you kind of look like that one victoria's secret model<br>  alessandro something..|`|J86kG2GWaa	yeah, but its kinda blurry. nice pic tho|`|zsH4wI0Raa	pretty ya|`|4JHF4KVOaa	its too blurry and you cant see your face|`|9tEdqXHjaa	ya it would be great|`|rrLE1gPMaa	i think its good|`|4vpfMeTEaa	if ur face wasnt so ugly than yeah

p2Njf5gBaa	I have been to plenty of weddings where people take off their shoes,  yes, this may sound tacky, but after a few drinks and in the heat of the fun, no one cares.  I would invest in a soft padding for the dance floor, or else tuck a little note into the invites or send out a mass email that says some thing along the lines,  "Don't forget your dancing shoes"  Buying flip flops for everyone is going to be expensive.  Besides, flip flops aren't necessarly great dancing shoes either.  Also, cheap flip flops can be very uncomfortable and painful as well, and my not be much better then the shoes they are wearing.|`|a7qKKlY7aa	um idk but i know that oldnavy has flip flops for 3 dollars a pair and they are on sale alot some times 2 for 3 dollars

As for your blackheads, try ginvera marvel gel (green tea). its a scrub for your face. very effective for removing blackhead and dead skin. can use daily and you will see improvements. another way is, after a hot shower.. get a cotton pad and squeeze your nose and u will see lots of blackhead.

c1d1f8963f613c52cc10c047170e0b7faa	It really is a generalization to say "all guys like girls with big butts".  But in general, men are attracted to certain areas of a woman's body.  This is why we emphasize the breasts, a slender waist, the curves on our hips and our buttocks both.  Men have a built in sexual attraction to these areas (whereas other sexual attractions are learned or cultural).  Other places we draw attention to are the lips, cheeks, eyes...etc.  When we put on blush and lipstick, we are simulating the color that naturally occurs in sexual arousal.      It is hard to say WHY we are sexual creatures, but we certainly can see that across many thousands of years and different cultures, men have like butts :)  Lots of ancient literature and art confirm this for us.|`|edeb62294ff4e4612516395b57aa686aaa	Usually the dudes that like big butts are skinny bony guys with not a lot of meat on them.

Branding    Football players and fraternity members are helping to make branding more popular. Branding is accomplished by heating a metal object and placing it on the skin to leave a scar. Branding can be very dangerous since the intensity of the heat is not known. Underlying muscles and organs can be damaged, so branding should be discouraged.

Every one has their own beauty. Beauty is like getting your hair done perfecting your nails getting clothes makeup etc. Now when your smart that's knowledge. This can help you with jobs or anything. When your cooking you need to know what to do what to add to the food because if you want to make a cake you have to know what to do to make it, if you put in crap it isn't going to be a cake or it will just be disgusting. So that's  an example of knowledge. If you don't know how to make it you get the recipe and you have to read it that's knowledge and you have to be smart to have knowledge. So to shorten it up beauty is what you have on the outside and to be smart is what you have inside. Like your brain. It comes out when you act smart like to answer a question. That's the difference between beautiful and smart.

1cd30775da21ba0943975a758e5f5eacaa	If you try a good texturizer or find a good stylist you wont be disappointed with the results.  Currently I am wearing using a texturizer.  The texturizer will enhance your natural curl pattern.  My hair curls naturally when washed but I love the additive of a good texturizer to make my curls pop.    The texturizer does offer the flexibility that you desire to go in between straight and curly styles.  Last week I wore my hair curly, this week Im sporting a straight pixie cut that looks exactly like a perm with a few added waves.    For maintenance:  I use Soft N Beautiful Botanicals moisturizer when I wear my hair curly.  Right after washing I usually have to apply a generous amount of moisturizer  once in the morning and once at night.  Thereafter the moisture sets in and I can actually go a few days without applying the moisturizer if I so desire.    When I wear my hair straight, I just maintain the style as I would a perm.  I run DAX thru my tresses instead of the Botanicals moisturizer.    Washing the hair everyday is not necessary.  You decide your shampoo routine.  If you cannot shampoo a conditioner rinse will work just as good.    Good products to have on hand, a good moisturizer, shampoo and conditioner, leave in conditioner and mousse.    I have tried other moisturizers such as Lusters Pink moisturizer but for me, none provided as great results.  Lusters Pink tended to leave my hair with extremely tight curls and a greasy yet rough feeling.        Personally, I dont see the perm rearing its head in my tresses anytime soon.  The Texturizer is fun and flexible and when I wear it I notice substantial growth.  Even with my hair lickety split short if I wear the texturizer for a month the hair growth is phenomenal.  It is said that you must cut the permed hair off but in all honesty I have never done this.  Its nothing for me to get a perm one day  grow tired of it and then switch to a texturizer the following week.  I texturize my hair and then I just clip it into a style.  I havent noticed any damage to my hair nor did I experience any hair loss.  It just depends on how strong your hair is and your hair care routine.     It is also not a requirement to go super short to obtain a texturizer however you will probably notice the best results (initially) if you go short.   If you need further info such as my two favorite Texturizers to use  send me a noteIll be happy to assist.    Good luck.|`|b51139ca5d6500dbc473442680dac1f0aa	people do this but i suggest you work with a professional as you go through hair phases...all of these chemicals may take your hair out if not managed correctly.|`|AA11497473	My sister did this and her hair looks cute. I recently cut off all my relaxed hair, because I was planning to do the same thing, but I decided I would just try to stay natural for a while.  Texturizers will loosen the curl of your hair so that it's not so tight. The longer your hair, the longer it will hang.    If you go to www.longhaircareforum.com you can ask detailed question from people who have done it and see pics. It's a helpful site, and you can find links to other hair sites that you might find interesting.

It is really gentle on your skin - but I suggest you get the option which has a moisturizer. I know you might think you don't need it because your skin is semi-oily but you do! Also, make sure you use the the system before you shave your face - as your skin might sting if you use the toner after you shave - ouch! I wish you luck sweetie - but do remember - skincare is a very personal thing - just because it might have worked for one person it might not work for you. I'm sure that this product will, just give it time because for your skin to really respond to it - you want to give it 30 days.|`|ee84c11de9da22a072b4f58481e185b5aa	murad or proactive, cuz proactive only works 4 certain ppl, like it dint work for me, but then again, it can work miracles on other people, lol|`|b56653e9bb7aef5ef5f4372704ba6b87aa	proactiv

Since you two are planning on college, maybe some college bound gifts that are practical, and include the things he loves, or the college's name that he's going to attend (if he's decided). Try craft projects that you make yourself. It will mean that much more to him because of the time and effort you put into it.     A scrap book of the past year with movie stubs, recepts, pictures, etc...  Breakfast in bed with heart shaped pancakes.  A picnic at your favorite spot.  Dinner you made yourself.  A cake or his favorite dessert you made yourself.  A love letter or homemade card instead of a card from the store.  Love coupons for little things like hugs, kisses, a back or foot rub.

I have included a recipe that is SO good - very economical and it is healthy for you! (I found it in Cooking Light Magazine)    Salsa:  2  quarts water  1/2  pound tomatillos (about 10 small), husks and stems removed  1  garlic clove  1/2  to 1 serrano chile  1/2  cup chopped fresh cilantro  1/4  cup coarsely chopped onion  1  teaspoon fresh lime juice  1/4  teaspoon salt    Chicken:  3  (1-ounce) slices white bread  4  (6-ounce) skinless, boneless chicken breast halves  1/2  teaspoon salt  1/2  teaspoon ground cumin  1/4  teaspoon ground red pepper  1  large egg, lightly beaten  1  tablespoon olive oil  1/2  cup (2 ounces) crumbled queso fresco cheese  Cilantro sprigs (optional)  Lime wedges (optional)    Preheat oven to 350.  To prepare salsa, bring water to a boil. Add tomatillos, garlic, and chile; cook 7 minutes. Drain and rinse with cold water. Combine tomatillos, garlic, chile, chopped cilantro, onion, lime juice, and 1/4 teaspoon salt in a food processor or blender; pulse 4 to 5 times or until coarsely chopped. Set aside.    To prepare chicken, place bread in a food processor, and pulse 10 times or until coarse crumbs measure 1 1/2 cups. Arrange crumbs on a baking sheet; bake at 350 for 3 minutes or until lightly browned. Cool completely.    Place each chicken breast half between 2 sheets of heavy-duty plastic wrap; pound to 1/2-inch thickness using a meat mallet or rolling pin. Combine 1/2 teaspoon salt, cumin, and red pepper; sprinkle evenly over chicken.    Place breadcrumbs in a shallow dish. Place egg in another shallow dish.

First, if you cannot afford to make him his favorite meal, see if you can make his favorite cake, or bake brownies.  Then decorate it with icing, saying Happy 1st anniversary.  Another thing I did was write some of the lyrics of our favorite songs and poems in a new journal.  I also wrote a poem for him, with my honest feelings for him.  Make your own greeting card with different colored pencils, pick a flower from a garden and tape it on...Oh the possibilities are endless....|`|f8dc318702789515e8c5f33b9ed80081aa	girl the dinner is the way to go!!!!! totally 100%! One thing a guy loves his for his girl to make him dinner (not this big fansy dinner just something nice..) you could cook his favorite meal... just spending tiem with him will make him feel like your his world. I have notice to that guys don't really worry about gifts... they don't really care about them... you know you guys just have fun that night and don't worry about trying to please him and tryign to make it prefect... you'll get it.. you'll find the great thing to do . and no matter what it is he'll love it

If you're local Macy's doesn't have it, ask customer service to order you one; normally if they have to order it they will give you a discount.  You can also watch on the website for it to go on clearance; the wait may be worth it.  I got a totally hot pair of Carlos shoes, Orbit wedges by watching the clearance marked down from 90 to 40.  Lucky me, the very last pair at the store was exactly my size!  If it is from another season, check clearance section to see if it is there.  If it isn't you will probably have a harder time finding it.

fb3dbc585d9f5a54dceec60de6d56dc0aa	A cute messy bun would be adorable. Try letting your hair air dry, then swiping some defrizz through to prevent flyaways. Put your hair in a ponytail holder with a similar color as your haircolor. Use bobby pins to pin up varying small and large chunks of hair. If it's not perfect, then you know you have done it right. This look is great of casual-formal. Pair with dangling earrings for that special effect.    Another idea are back from the beach waves that are really hot right now. When your hair is still wet from just out of the shower, put your hair into tight or loose braids (depending on what kind of waves you want) starting at the ear. If you take a shower at night, hit the hay. If you take a shower in the morning, wait until your hair is dry and DO NOT BLOWDRY. Swipe anti frizz serum. Crunch with styling mousse and secure with hairspray if you want that extra hold.    Hope this helped :)|`|7693d0f1302f08053fe0499bddc87b9caa	well,theres always straight.or u could flip the ends of ur hair with a curling iron.i love doing that.|`|c410aaadcae447fe464fc7fd07fe587caa	Here you go- here are some sites that show the hairstyles for long hair that is layered - also step by step instructions on how to style it.

c410aaadcae447fe464fc7fd07fe587caa	Make sure you trim off the split ends. I'm going to include step by step what I used from pantene - and it WORKED on my hair - granted it took a few days for the product to really start affecting my hair but the results are AWESOME.  Shampoo    Before getting into the shower, gently brush or finger-comb your hair to loosen up tangles and residue.    Wet hair and pour a small amount of Pantene Smooth & Sleek Shampoo into your palm.    Rub your hands together and gently massage into the roots using the tips of your fingers. (Careful! Vigorous rubbing can cause strands to break.)    If you wear makeup, pay special attention to the hairline.    Rinse thoroughly with warm water to remove all of the shampoo.  Condition    Conditioning is key to creating shine and preserving hair health.    After shampooing, carefully remove excess moisture by squeezing your hair with a towel. (Be gentle. Rubbing and twisting with a towel can break the hair.)    Squeeze a small blob of Pantene Smooth & Sleek Complete Therapy Conditioner on your palm and spread it over your hands, then apply it to your hair.    For super shine, condition the entire strand, starting at the roots.    For volume, condition only the middle and ends of your hair, where it's most susceptible to damage.  Styling    It's easier to apply styling products to hair that's just damp, so towel off first.    Squeeze a palmful of Pantene Get It Straight Gel or Smooth Down Frizz Control Smoothing Crme into your hands and rub them together.    Distribute the styling formula evenly by "clapping" sections of hair between your flat hands and gently pulling downward.    Blow-dry    Use the hot setting on all of your hair to accelerate the drying.    When hair is about half dry divide it into sections so you can concentrate the blow dryer and brush on one area.    Use clips to divide the top front and sides, then blow-dry them one at a time using a flat brush (smaller bristles work best). Once the top and sides are finished, you can move to the back.    A flat paddle brush works best. Its wide surface area spreads hair out and keeps it taut, which aids in the straightening process.    Follow the brush with the blow dryer, keeping the blow dryer about five inches away from the hair.    Too much heat can cause damage. Once hair is mostly dry, reduce the heat and add a nozzle. Start from the roots and follow the brush down, keeping the hair taut but not stretched too tightly. The cooler air locks in the style you want.    Set Your Style    A generous spritz of Pantene Stay Smooth Hairspray Flexible Hold will keep your smooth look in place for hours.|`|bebb284c0daf2328c15ba82bb9f2974daa	Put a straightening serum in before you blow dry or flat iron.

That's when I decided to embrace my curls.  I'm sure that's not what you want to hear (I felt that way for several years), but I truly believe it's the only way to handle this problem.  I don't think straightened hair looks natural, anyway.  It almost always looks like it's been straightened to me, and it causes lots of damage to continue straightening for years and years.  I bet your curls are beautiful!  I would encourage you to buy some styling products that discourage frizz, and let 'em curl.|`|609dbed3e024e59e25835131dd3b7c48aa	get a japan straigtening perm. or use sunsilk straighten up shampoo and conditioner. straigthen and when it gets wavy add sunsilk straighten up 24/7 creme with elastyn e, u can put it in when ur hair is dry or wet to keep it straight, it smells good too!    good luck|`|5fac41a2ee0d707f9cc745032316e5d1aa	First of all, it makes a difference on what kind of hair straightner you use. Store bougth starightners such as Revlon are harsh on your hair. I suggest to go to your hair stylist and tell her you want the Chi iron. It's $200, but a great investment. You can look for one on eBay or Overstock.com. It does little damage to your hair. I have a natural wave myself, i use a hair serum by Biosilk  called Silk therapy, depending on how much hair you have is how much you use. I have long thick hair so I use about a quarter size drop. It lasts until i wash my hair. Any kind of hair straightening serum you want to use is fine with this iron, the serum is really just for shine and fly-aways.|`|8f0a25db300ebc76226e676341123d3caa	bedhead si a great product for that!|`|AA12203041	you're supposed to put something in your hair to prime it and keep the look....  try John Frieda's serum... you just apply to your hair before you flat iron it and then go ahead and  straighten it. it would keep your hair straight and smooth and no frizz.|`|AA11988692	lol, my problem is my hair is straight all day!

I know you just bought the 3-step, but I really recommend the philosophy Make-up Optional Skin  regimen.

The extra help combined with light styling will defeat frizziness. Also try using John Frieda's Frizz-ease products for wavy hair.  Also, try using a defuser on your blow drying while point the barrel downward to seal your cuticle down (it looks cleaner). Try Garnier Frutisse Curls and Waves collection, it works so well (I use the leave in and hairspray everyday!)    For straight (naturally) hair:  Don't use too much shampoo in the shower. Some shampoo's wash off your natural (good) oils in your hair that keep it looks smooth and healthy. Use plenty of conditioner, but not enough to weight your hair down. When you get out of the shower, use a leave in conditioner and them comb through it so your hair will looks shiny and clean. If your frizz happens on the top of your hair, use a light aerosol hairspray. Try Loreal Texture (available only in salons) Frizz Fighter.Straight for great results.    For both hair types, make sure you use products ment for your hair style (relaxed, colored, limp). Always, always, always remember not to use so much syling products that you weight your hair down. Don't use gel on either hair types, mousse is better and also healthier.

2e4dc5a3feec8151441abf8c00dc1ed3aa	Ok dude. Here's the truth.. For starters never take a girls advice on how to win a girl. Girls don't even understand what attracts them. They will all say "Just be yourself". This is because they find the idea of a guy changing anything to attract a girl to be "try hard". This is very unattractive to women. However most qualities of a nice guy will also appear try hard to women and are therefore unattractive. To attract a women you need to have a don't care attitude. As though your date book is full and you don't even notice that a women is attractive. Forget all that gentleman stuff you're momma taught you. Women will always interpret that stuff as desperate. Be friendly, cocky and even a little rude to the really attractive ones. Tease them, make fun of them and talk to their friend when its obvious they want your attention. Believe it or not qualities that should scream "jerk!" to a girl, will actually attract them. Attractive women have guys trying to be "nice" to them all day long. They want a challenge. Make friends with lots of girls (even ugly ones) and be seen with them. Social proof goes farther with women than looks. If other girls like you, they will like you too. After its obvious that they are attracted to you, then you can take your time and get to know them. Gradually let them discover that youre a nice guy. At that point they will appreciate it.|`|87257bfa3ecc9251a45567c6ede2caa8aa	jus be  yourself and you will win girls over.|`|a572da46f410bf44ba2010a428459651aa	shave your head, get a **** load of tattoos , and dont be afraid to show off your pennis in public places.... if that doesnt work use ductape!!!|`|96a230e21422c40fd10d37f4938be069aa	you know what keep doing what your doing being yourself  im sure you are a great looking guy i tell you what girls like nice   smelling scents on men try one scents really help trust me the   nose knows|`|137606862ea884c9e20c11c99fd1a160aa	Story of my life...and yet you have one up on most most guys out there and yet you don't know it.  You need to talk to the one you like and take "one step further."  Ask them out on a date.  Nothing special...just something a little more intimate.  Like dinner and a movie.  Something safe.  You already earned their trust, just show them what a date with a nice guy is all about, and build off that.    Hope this helps|`|2b5a97fd4c75f735faeda40071b6a8feaa	stay true 2 u|`|21af7483d16cd9761234d27f1e929f25aa	You can't *make* a girl like you, but you can get her to notice you.  If you're as funny and intelligent as you are strike up a conversation with the girl you like to show her the great guy you are!!  It's great that you are there to help with problems...maybe you could say something like...I don't always have to play Dr. Phil...wanna grab a movie?|`|3b58ea0c2dd276438f9505029ec089b7aa	be forward...assertive....most importantly: BE YOUR SELF!!!  Girls love a man who never compromise themselves for other people.|`|c410aaadcae447fe464fc7fd07fe587caa	It sounds so cliche but it is SO true that women go for men like you. Maybe you might need to play hard to get or not be so available. If she calls, call her back the next day. It is pathetic but girls also kind of like a challenge if a guy isn't so readily available. Girls like to be chased (a bit) but you gotta keep them sweating a bit (is he going to call) Man, I know all these girls are gonna kill me for saying that - but I'm telling you my opinion. After a while, I found out that the guy like you was what I was really looking for - so have faith. Try doing one of those '8 minute lunch date' things - it really teaches you how to talk to people and get to the point without all the fluff. Plus - you get to meet a bunch of great people.

They are quite fashionable now and can be either elegant or informal.  The messier it is the more fashionable!  You can do two small braids down the sides of your face that hang next to your loose hair.  Two braids over your ears that contain all your hair.  You can even do one big braid down the back that pulls it all away from your face.  Of course a ponytail or bun is kind of fun too.|`|bc7f3553bf146f87af4db38b8029cf3eaa	try these tips...... they relle work!!  Hair Wash    The best way of washing hair is with Aritha and Shikakai Powder. It does not have any chemicals or any other side effects. Aritha and Shikakai powder is available at any General stores or even a banyan shop.    Shampoos    Dry Hair - Egg, Herbal shampoo or any shampoo for dry hair.    Normal Hair - For normal hair fruit shampoos or henna shampoo is good.    Oily Hair - Lemon Shampoo    Hair Oil  Oil your hair at least once in a week. If you have dry hair then oil it twice a week.

Color does not lift color. No color will work over the black dye, it will still be black. If you want to change your color,you will have to have the black dye stripped out first and then recolor. Having the dye stripped out can be very damaging though.|`|d1e6d29a5a115c44db0c278e998bd885aa	the red wont take actually no color will take to the black ... color will never lift color but if your hair color was naturally black then it could lift up to 4 shades but since its colored black then the only option is to get it striped or let it grow out.|`|AA10216817	If you are trying to color over the black dye, for highlights or something like that, I would use a hair dye like Manic Panic.  Choose a red that has a lot of "blue" in it.  Something like, "Vampire Red," I'd say.      If you wish to have red hair, instead of black hair, I recommend you see a stylist, because you're probably going to have to have the black stripped from your hair, which isn't easy to do from home for the inexperienced home stylist.  It can also be very damaging for your hair to strip it.|`|db3c0b60279d332ad6709459688ec650aa	Use the brightest red available if you want it to show against your black hair.

A esa edad los ni?os estan definiendo su sexualidad. Pero eso no quiere decir que vayan a ser homosexuales. Para ninguna situacion, es recomendable pegarle a un ni?o.    Tengo un hermano que aun a los 6 a?os, jugaba con las mu?ecas de mi hermana y mias. Mi mama lo llevo al Psicologo. El Psicologo le dijo que si a los 16 a?os aun jugaba con mu?ecas, entonces si, se tenia que preocupar. Que eso es una etapa normal en muchos ni?os, al igual que a muchas ni?as les gusta jugar con con cosas de ni?os.    Hoy dia, mi hermano tiene un gran problema: le gustan demasiado las mujeres. Creo que no debes preocuparte tanto  por eso, mucho menos, pegarle. Pero si quieres, para que te sientas tranquila, llevalo al psicologo, aunque estoy completamente segura que te dira lo mismo que yo.    Te deseo que tengas mucha suerte|`|21234c2207ce4b2f7beadf50e3621b8caa	Que locura es esa!!!!!!! yo no se si las otras contestaciones son chiste o realmente piensan lo que dicen. si es asi, son una manga de infelices.machistas|`|99b4ec882949538393f1c4ecef7f71a9aa	Nunca  se  debe de  golpear a   un  ni?o,   eso es considerado  violencia  intrafamiliar  y  por lo  tanto  un  delito,  en la leyes  Mexicanas.   Si    un  ni?o   gusta de  jugar con  mu?ecas no necesariamente    es  indicio de  desviacion   sexual.   POsiblemente  aprendio  a  hacerlo viendo a  ni?as  mayorcitas  y  gustandole  aquellas  ni?as  le gustan  sus  juegos  tambien..   De cualquier    modo    platicar  con el  ni?o  por parte de sus padres  se sabra  como  piensa   y porque actua  asi,    y por otra parte   darle   indicios  de la  conducta  que se espera de el.|`|a8d1f5f67d91b39febf708313cb086f8aa	Oye yo no soy homosexual, y de ni?o jugu con mu?ecos, y mi papel con mis hermanas, era el de padre, finalmente mis hijos jugaron con mu?equitos, y tambin el papel de ser papa, en una cultura machista, el papel del  padre es casi insignificante, y por consiguiente, no es deseable que juegue con mu?equitos, pero en una cultura no machista, ser padre es una parte bonita y esencial del hombre, la pregunta que yo te hara:  ?Que sentido tiene el ser hombre si no es para ser padre?.  Por otro lado, asumiendo que tu preocupacin fuese por que el ni?o fuese homosexual, ?Tu crees que los golpes podran cambiar su deseo?.  Y otra pregunta ?Que eres si no eres deseo?.

Si a este ni?o le gusta jugar con mu?ecas dejalo, hasta cierto punto es normal debido a que su desarrollo psicologico an no esta completado. Ya con el tiempo se le quitar esa atraccin por las mu?ecas o se le reafirmar.

Necesitan competir con sus iguales para averiguar su propio valor.  Todos los artculos utilizados para el ejercicio fsico les ayudarn a liberar su tensin. Tambin son juguetes muy apropiados para esta edad aqullos que favorezcan la habilidad, la atencin y la capacidad creadora, la destreza y la imaginacin y, sobre todo, la afirmacin individual.  Tambin les divierten los juegos con los dems (con terceras personas) en los que hay que cumplir unas reglas.  De seis a nueve a?os son casi imprescindibles la bicicleta, los patines, las canicas, los aviones, las construcciones, el yo-yo, los juegos de letras, los telares, las costuras, los tteres y marionetas, las cajas para engarzar collares, los quits para el cuidado de la naturaleza (con casa incluida para pjaros), el croket, los solitarios, los juegos de mesa con preguntas y respuestas sobre distintas materias, los rompecabezas, loteras y todo aquello que se pueda coleccionar.  A partir de los nueve a?os y hasta los doce son muy importantes los juegos que anticipan situaciones adultas profesionales, como por ejemplo, los de qumica, electricidad o el microscopio. Resultan tambin muy positivos aqullos que fomentan las actividades en equipo, sean deportivas o intelectuales.  Las construcciones, los mecanos a motor, las cometas, la iniciacin en el modelismo (realizando aviones, barcos, casitas de mu?ecas y sus muebles en miniatura) y el coleccionismo de sellos, monedas, mariposas o rocas minerales, o los instrumentos musicales pueden ser el inicio de un "hobby" que dure toda la vida.|`|5wID1E1gaa	NUNCA DEBE SER GOLPEADO UN NI?O !!, Es una aptitud muy normal ellos todavia no saben de cosas tan siniestras y perversas como los adultos -morbo-, este nene demuestra personalidad y sera un buen ni?o dentro de la sociedad y no tendra problemas de adaptacion a la hora de hacer amistades. saludos !!|`|l5qUgiUsaa	MEJOR HAZLE SABER LOS ROLES DE GENERO, MIRA, ESO NO INDICA TENDENCIAS SEXUALES, NO KIERE DECIR K SEA HOMOSEXUAL, SIMPLEMENTE KIERE JUGAR, Y SI FUERA HOMOSEXUAL?

2aadb891b8f4d0d5bfe78d58ce744555aa	mac|`|AA11014669	It depends on what exactly u want it for.  i personally HATE mac foundations, it looks cakey to me and unnatural. Makeup forever is a professional brand, thats why they only have like 6 colors, because since they are made for makeup artist and most artist know how to mix foundations etc. The face and body foundations are water/smudge proff once it sets but i also love MAC's face and body and it has a very natural finish to it. I used it on my model in the viet expo. It's pricey but its was worth it. You can also use it in an airbrush without dileuting it, but if your starting out pre-mixed foundations like from MAC are great,   MAC Studio tech is what they use on models.  For lip products id go for MAC, the MUFE gloss's stink are sticky and too shiney but there lipsticks r gorjuz, the same as MAC and cheaper.  i love the star powders! These are great pigments better then MAC. Great colour selection and fine texture. I have never seen any "balls" in these pigments at all. Lasting power is superb even if you apply them dry on BARE skin. They have adhesive power to make them stick to the skin.   Thats some reviews on products but personally id go with MAC if your just starting out and not that professonally MUFE might be a bit tricky for you. Also, MAC items r not waterproof the face and body foundaiton is tho, thats why it loved by alot of make up artists.|`|AA11207798	Don't know the other brand so I will say MAC.|`|a72c7fa37c43b3a0d61b74cac85dcab6aa	Revews about top ten brands of Mascara, Concealer, Lipstic, Foundations etc....

I've had that length many times and never had any trouble pulling it back into a ponytail-it's a longer length that manly people think!

deca3af6695f00b2fc917d91d1a77064aa	I adore M.A.C and I cant live without lipglass!! My lips are so sensitive and they chap very easily, lipglass never makes my lips dry out. Unless my lips are really chapped lipglass tends to irritate it. For your sensitive lips, at night dab a little Vaseline on your lips and leave it on over night. In the morning your lips will be very moisturized and ready for some lipglass!!!|`|DDSk8cBWaa	NOOOOO !!! i love MAC lipglass!! and lips are kinda flaky and dry too.. and they cover the flaks beautifully...|`|e621352110a57cacddc7fc658846a82aaa	This is coming from a MAC Professional.....    MAC Lipglass contains a Jojoba oil base, Vit E and C acting as antioxidants, and natural moisture humectants.  MAC Lustreglass is a water base, giving it a thinner consistency plus the above mentioned.  MAC Lipgelees are a silica based lipgloss, allowing it to feel like liquid silk on the lips, also plus the above mentioned.    So, having sensitive lips is ok because these products are actually going to moisturize and soothe the lips with the ingredients contained in the products.  If you were to still have some dryness, try the Tinted Lip Conditioners by MAC underneath your favorite MAC lip gloss.  Not only do they add amazing amounts of moisture, but they also have sunscreen and Vanilla Extract!|`|4084313ee48d1df05aebeb33dd37aeb5aa	no it shouldn't.|`|AA10530337	I love MAC as well and I have no problem with the MAC line.

b32e560414238926779c6d2630e98a48aa	i don't really know any women who shave their whole body. most women don't have AS much body hair as men, but then again, some have more.lol. If you want to be all smooth, and do it regularly, i suggest waxing. Nair and creams will cause it to grow in thick, not to mention its chemical that burns your hair off, cant be good for your skin. shaving will cause stubble, and that cant be good in the unmentionable areas. I would go to a spa, you may even be able to work out a deal with them, for a regular apt. make sure to moisturize well to keep your skin soft and later, when u start making more money, you can look into electrolysis. (painful and expensive but more permanent)  anyway hope this is good.

3YE1f7Foaa	try the priyamani look?http://images.search.yahoo.com/search/im...|`|TMk46Pfcaa	   You are pretty, but you might want to take some advice from the ladies here. You'll look even better...lol|`|Fg3s4WHOaa	Hi!    As you are wanting to wear this look every day I think you should keep the make up quite simple and natural looking.    I would maybe suggest:    Foundation - look for one with yellow undertones, and a coverage which can be built up so that you can keep it natural for daytime, and maybe more dramatic with a fuller coverage for special occasions.    Lips: Orange and brown shades make your teeth appear yellow, so avoid these wherever possible. Brown shades such as beiges, peaches and cappuccinos work really well for a natural look.    Eyes: Shades of brown look nice for a daytime look, they don't look too overdone.  Mascara always opens up your eyes and defines them, as does a little black or dark brown eyeliner.    The best eye make up shades would be a trio set of brown shades, such as: http://www.make-up-revolution.com/images...    Use the lightest colour all the way up to the brow bone, the second shade should be put over the eyelid and the darkest colour used to add definition along the upper lash line.    Finish with eyeliner on the loere eyelid and add mascara.    Cheeks/Blush: Peachy, coral and dusky pinks would look nice and really bring out the gorgeous shade of your skin and freshen up your look.    I hope this helps :)    T x        |`|94TPwojgaa	You are very pretty. I think a simple, sweet, feminine look is great for your basic everyday, easy routine. With your skin  and hair color i think rosy and not too bright pinks are nice. If you go with reds or browns it might appear harsh and/or old.     My hugest recommendation is a lip stain. You simply can't go wrong with a lip stain- no way in the world. i use a lip stain everyday. it is perfect for so many reasons: - won't cake up your lips. yuck - you can kiss a guy without them having to eat lipstick!  =)  - won't smear or rub off on things or people. - it is light and liquidy and simply stains your lips leaving a beautiful natural looking stain. I use one by Revlon called Just Bitten. I can't seem to find it anywhere though. There is a lip and cheek stain at Ulta that i am going to try next and here is the link... http://www.ulta.com/ulta/browse/productD...  There are three shades. I think Sheer Luck and Sheer Emotion are great for you. The link will take you to Sheer Emotion but if you scroll down a little you will see options to look at the other two shades. You can use that for lip color and blush - so easy and so pretty. If you want you can use a rose colored lip liner to line the lips (optional).    A light foundation is great for everyday use. - Something hypoallergenic that won't clog your pores, especially since it is every day use you need it for. Smart pigment technology that will match your natural skin color better, should give a more natural everyday look. Here is my recommendation (and personal choice) as an example... http://maxfactor.com/index.jsp MAX_color...    Now, all you have left is your eyes. You would look nice with or without eye makeup for evey day use but if you want to here are my recommendations:  Brown/black mascara, a little dash of brown/black liquid eye liner (only if you wear mascara)...a cream powder eye shadow would be simple and not be so cakey and dry out your skin. It will glide on. if you decide to wear eye shadow, maybe a tanish/blushy shade would look nice.     I hope this helps... It certainly should lighten the load of your purse. I dont know how old you are but at the age of 26, i am just now perfecting this stuff. The stains and pigment matching technology is a fairly new thing that has made it so much easier for me. Best wishes to you. =)|`|TIIbKxWaaa	pretty.   eyes - i would put gold eyeshadow on the inner corner of your eyes blending it out all the way to the outer corners    foundation - you have lovely skin with what looks like a even tone so you wont want to use too much overall colour as it will make you look overdone and give you cake face -note a good look so either add a drop or two of foundation to your daily moisturiser or get a tinted moisturiser (which is usually around the same price as normal moisturiser) and will give you a natural glow while covering uneven skin tone    cheeks - corals, pale pinks or browns would look great on you. only use a small amount across your cheekbone to give your cheeks a bit of lift (colour)    lips - honestly just use lipbalm or a natural coloured lip gloss     have fun, look great and remember less is more    btw clear mascara and no eyeliner is best as it will make your eyes shine    hope this helps|`|AA12235964	what ever you do try to make ur rues look wider..the best thing to enhance attraction on face |`|wDuJdtKlaa	Look I suggest you to spread some blush to your face,then a big mascara , lipstick and eyeshadow for a daily make up   you will look cool in this 'cause my sister also does the sames when she visits her job|`|lRnEQbsWaa	Nice(:|`|NGNlgMoCaa	Hi, Anisha    I suggest you a simple and touchy kind of look.

Keep the same haircut. It really matches you!    5.   Apply big mascara because your eye lashes are small    5.   Your ready!!!

12909b3b28e873f2605b3b134c130338aa	from a hairdresser.    First, it it naturally black or dyed.    There is not really any concreate of really black hair. The darkest is a really dark brown . Jet black hair has a hint of purple.    If you have already dyed your hair black and you want to go to a platnium blond, is going to do alot of damage to your hair .    Bleaching is going to be a long process and proably take a couple of times unless you go to a really good salon and see a professional stylist.    And it will proably cost a pretty penny.    If you don't want to do damage to your hair, get it professionally done.    But if you did color it black, remember. Going from black to blond is going to be alot on your hair.    Color will not lift color and if you did color it at home with an over the counter kit.. it takes a long time to get done.    Second. White Blond is really the highest level of blond and it you want that platinum look. Have the stylist recommend some good shampoo's to keep in good condition to give it the platinum look.

9163f49a01988d6f510d241a367222ffaa	If your are getting your hair permed in a salon you should not wash your hair the day of the service, because if you scratch your scalp or cause any abraisons this will burn really bad, and besides they have to wash your hair with a deep clairfying shampoo before anyhow, so don't waste your time doing it when they have to do it anyway... If you are doing this at home you should wash your hair right before you roll it with a deep clairyfying shampoo, like nexus aloe rid, and DO NOT condition.. if you condition before the perm will not take as well...|`|AA10426850	whats that?|`|AA12113598	don't worry about it- if at home make sure you use a pre-prem shampoo... & perm conditioner. If going to the salon they use their own special shampoo--//    P.ss fro some strange reason- if you haven't washed your hair previously at least 24 hrs before is best.. YOur scalp develops a layer of dirt (basically) which helps protect your scalp against the harsh chemicals of the perm or dye...

AA11838074	Suave and VO5 probably tend to have more detergents in them and less emoilients--hence why they're cheap.     However, this is (obviously) sounding beneficial to you--maybe your hair is more on the oily side and you don't need an extrataneous moisturizers.     If what you're using is working for you, great, but if you want to try Pantene again, use their shampoo formulated for limp hair.|`|81cc317a8d54fb98d2c4ca790e48afa8aa	You're not washing it out enough. Make sure you give it a good rubbadubdub and then see. I |`|3e73d8c98dfc80052c68be6c3ba37270aa	For the record, I really dislike Pantene.  Everybody talks about how great it is, but I hate it.  So far, my favorite is John Frieda Brilliant Brunette.      Anyway, I HAVE heard that Pantene leaves some kind of film on your hair to make it shinier, but after using it for a while it just builds up that residue.  That's just what I've heard. I don't actually know.  I already disliked Pantene immensely when I heard about this, so I haven't tried it since.|`|b3fa33c4e70a78807c06b6f234f038c3aa	THEY PUT LIKE ALL THIS EXTRA STUFF IN IT.....AND YOU ODIOUSLY DONT NEED IT.....SO I'D SAY STOP USING IT BECAUSE LIKE ITS A SUPER WASTE ON YOUR TIME AND MONEY!!!!|`|39f1e02605bcff32190bb274c182020baa	This could be your styling products sticking around. The shampoo may not do enough to get rid of the residue. You can occasionally use a claifying shampoo to get rid of it. DON'T use Pantene!!! It absolutely leaves a coating on your hair, supposedly for shine, but a shampoo should do nothing but cleanse!!!|`|c5725c2bf8e8ad758f9cdb2f01da5775aa	try it once more or until you use the whoel bottle.  make sure too rinse it out good.  scratch that.

5cbac6fad317759b1987bc8772402376aa	Mostly like it is. I do the same thing but after a certain amount of time I just leave the lipgloss off. Lip gloss doesnt help moisturize your lips but it helps to dry them out. So even tho you do love that lip gloss you might not want to use it as much. If you check out Sally Hansen stuff they have lip gloss with moisturizers in it.|`|3ec46056a68b9d99f758b4d28ce7d823aa	It could be the lip gloss or just the time of year. Lips tend to get dry and cracked this time of year so probably you should just change moisturizers|`|79021a61b2485597895a8b7c76eff4c4aa	yes. when ever u rub your lips together it chapps them. some ppl say the exfoliate but no they dont. i even saw it on the style network|`|3398bcfbd1f0b67ae947383f0d7e02a1aa	yes. when ever u rub your lips together it chapps them. some people say the exfoliate but no they don't. i even saw it on the style website|`|111a4453fe8d141291cf1638106dbad0aa	yes. it is true that when u rub your lips together, the sparkles will scratch your lips...the same thing happens to me. my fave lip gloss has some little sparkles in it...but it always seems that at the end of the day my lips are chapped! it's annoying but i still luv my lips gloss! lol|`|AA10921374	I pretty certain that its from the weather, its a pretty commom problem. If you want to know, why not stop wearing the lip gloss (if you can bare it !), if the problem is better than you might have to part with it (NOOOO!!).... Also, from experience if you lips are actually sore and swollen not just chapped you might be having an allergic reaction like I did. Anti-Histamine will clear this up if you go to a pharmacy or something!     The sparkles are so tiny that they wouldn't do anything!|`|ce79983f9eaf985cbea6f2f7c58bd7edaa	Not from the sparkles themselves, but from rubbing your lips together.  Refrain from licking and rubbing your lips as much as possible.  Try putting a thick chap stick on first, before the lipgloss.  When applying again, make sure to reapply the chap stick as well, not just the lipgloss!

That is way too many colors for a company party. Plus, multiple primaries (blue, red, yellow) tend to look clown-ish.     Even though it's a semi-formal after hours party, you still need to show your boss and co-workers that you are a professional. Although a semi-formal doesn't require a suit (but it is more acceptable) you should look put together. The outfit you described is more of an informal look.     Keep the blue shirt and gray blazer. Then go with black or gray flat front slacks, and a tie with those colors in it. If you want to add red or yellow, do it in the pattern of your tie, not a solid color.  Finish your look with a black belt and black dress shoes.|`|AA10704364	navy slacks.|`|a7a9c9857b51d02851d336bf7020c2cdaa	A jet black pant would be so sexy.|`|b0f9387b9d477ba07e88c9a1ccdce77eaa	Black pants with a red tie, and formal shoes|`|32a39d705509e658919204330d0356bdaa	BLACK PIN-STRIPED PANTS....ummm i think you should go with a different colored tie too =]maybe light blue...if your shirt is like a darker blue =]

699f89b61d7af063b176eca06c9f893aaa	My son is "Emo" and as I understand it Emo is a somewhat ambiguous, controversial slang term most frequently used to describe a fashion or subculture which is usually defined to have roots in punk fashion and subculture, as well as some attributes of gothic fashion and subculture. It is loosely defined, and its meaning varies by region, but most definitions share a number of similarities. Emo now often refers to a person's fashion, personality, or both, as well as the music genre.    I guess back in the day 80's when I was in high school I was Emo too..Emo was not always used as slang referring to a subculture. The term was born in the 1980s to describe a genre of music stemming from the hardcore punk music scene in Washington, D.C.  Rites Of Spring was the first emocore band, but not many people knew about them. One of the members of Rites Of Spring joined Fugazi when it first started. Ian Mackaye, who was also the inventor of Straight Edge, wanted to copy ROS's style, but make it more like hardcore so that more people agreed with it. After them came Jawbreaker, who widened emocore's by going more into modern and indie rock. Sunny Day Real Estate, who came out at around the same time as Jawbreaker, did the same.    Today Emocore (Emo) bands are: Alexisonfire, Underoath, Saosin, A Static Lullaby, The Bled, Dead Poetic, From Autumn To Ashes, Engine Down, Thursday, Finch, Dismissed, Matchbook Romance, Earth Crisis, Snapcase and Boysetsfire.|`|yHpD0cyHaa	are homos|`|d870a878ce00e6f6b1838e4030ac3918aa	they shoudl all jstu cut theirselves for good    and get over themselves|`|JLk3uqC0aa	Are depressed?|`|b73ce1afb714b04e77fce24c93d3e98daa	losers with bad hair cuts, bad taste in music and spend too much time crying about how bad things are in their life.|`|1BruTzezaa	Is sad to me that people will live a lifestyle like that, just because they are depressed.

L'effet vasoconstricteur stimule la micro-circulation sanguine et amliore les changes cellulaires. La peau est plus tonique et retrouve son r?le de soutien-gorge naturel.    Les plus endurantes au froid pourront aussi appliquer un gant de gla?ons pour parfaire la sance de raffermissement des tissus.    4 - Porter un soutien-gorge "spcial sport" lors de toutes vos activits sportives.    5 - Faites des gommages du buste rgulirement afin de stimuler le renouvellement cellulaire et la circulation sanguine.    6 - Dormez sur le dos pour ne pas comprimer votre poitrine durant la nuit.    A bannir absolument    7 - Tous les mouvements ou sports violents (arobic, certains sports collectifs rudes et certaines disciplines de l'athltisme) et tous les gestes trop dynamiques qui risquent de brutaliser les tissus.    8 - Les bains de soleil prolongs sans protection solaire.    9 - Porter des charges lourdes.    10 - Les massages trop violents sur les seins. Pour faire pntrer une crme, il est recommand de masser la poitrine dun doux mouvement circulaire.    11 - Ecraser la poitrine en ramenant les bras croiss devant soi (par exemple en portant les courses  bras le corps).    12 - Les bains chauds prolongs.    13 - Les variations de poids.    14 - Une alimentation insuffisamment protine.    15 - Etirez les paules vers l'arrire pour redonner du tonus au buste : avec une forte poitrine on a tendance  vo?ter un peu le haut du dos et  accentuer ainsi l'affaissement des seins.    16 - Redressez-vous ! Arrtez vos complexes, les pulpeuses sont furieusement tendance    17 - Placer correctement votre dos.    18 - Faites rgulirement des mouvements avec les bras au-dessus de la tte dont l'objectif est de "remonter" les seins.    19 - Nagez sur le dos pour muscler les pectoraux et viter les nages qui martyrisent les seins comme le crowl et la nage papillon.    20 - Suspendez-vous  une barre d'appartement quelques secondes, les pieds sur le sol pour apprendre  vous tenir droite.|`|Y919rqxSaa	Essaie de faire du sport pour te remuscler les seins mais  mon avis il n'y a pas de remdes miracles !

aeb50a1352b19cb8d52140f1b33cee8baa	It's applied to the entire scalp and all of the hair. I'm not sure if they use it daily but it's best to use it once a week like a hair treatment. If you have time, try leaving it on for the entire day. It really leaves your hair soft when you wash.  Be sure to buy good quality coconut oil as the lower quality ones just do not have the same properties and may have other oils added. Quality coconut oil should smell like roasted coconuts and should be clear.|`|AA11162895	sorry, i am not Indian.However,you can apply it before shaMPOOING YOUR HAIR BY MASSAGING A SMALL AMOUNT INTO YOUR SCALP AND HAIR.you can also it after washing your to make it shiny,just use a small amount by putting some oil in the palm of your hands and pass them thru the hair.|`|feRmT1Xsaa	Pure virgin coconut oil is the best natural ingredient for skin lotion available.

AA12067359	My hair is very frizzy and curly and it looks like tumbleweed if i let it dry naturally.  What I have been doing for the past few years is wearing a pantyhose on my head after i get out of the shower.  I wait an hour with it on and take it off, my hair is bone straight.  You wouldn't even know that my hair is that bad by looking at my avatar.  I know it sounds crazy but this actually works.  Try it, you'll be glad.  It also keeps the hair looking nice and sleek and shiny.  It will keeps the hair in the same position your leave it in before you put it on, so comb your hair to the position your like once you step out of the shower.  Other than that, good luck!  email me at gameplaya2393@yahoo.com if you got any other questions or results.|`|H3G5QdgTaa	maybe cut it shorter and use some styling products to make it look smooth.  if u want it straight, buy a good ceramic straightener like a chi|`|M5wyBonFaa	find this website call curly girl  or   find a recipe for something called curly pudding|`|CWFuZiGvaa	Try Jell or Moose. I have Extremely curly hair and straighten it out.  If you dont want to use moose or jell, try hair spray... lots of it and a comb. If you have a comb you can usein the shower do. Wash your hair with Shampoo and then while you have the conditioner in comb out your hair in the shower. it works really well and it makes your hair...well less frizzy in a way.. just try it one day.. all my friends say it works. When you get outa the sower don't dry off your hair or brush it anymore.. let it naturally dry even if it might take a while. when you comb out your hair you just make it more frizzy. hope this helped. i know it helped me!|`|AA11482335	Gel. It doesn't really matter what kind just comb it through your hair in the morning  and it will look amazing!|`|AA11331190	I use a product called Biosilk found in some hair salons and in some beauty supply stores as well as ebay.  It tames the frizzy look that makes the dry hair look.  Your hair will look soft and feel really nice.  A truly controlled look for wavy hair.  It is not greasy and you only have to use a little.  Run a little in the palms of the hand and run through hair.  Then for a wetter look, add some gel after adding the biosilk serum .  Its the only thing that works well for me . :)|`|HjB5t38gaa	Many struggle with dry, hard to manage hair. This can be cause naturally by genetics or improper care such as using harsh chemicals (relaxers, color) or by hot styling products (blow dryer, heat iron). The good news is that some beauty recipes can help restore or re-hydrate your hair leaving it softer and shinier than ever.    ? Mix 1 tablespoon Honey and any type of vegetable oil. Distribute mixture evenly all over the hair.    ? Coat dry hair with mayonnaise, once finished cover with a plastic shower cap and leave on for 10-20 minutes.    ? Apply olive oil all over your hair. Cover with a plastic bag and let it stay for 20 minutes. For extra conditioning take a warm shower while waiting. The heat will help the oil work to its maximum potential.            ? Beat one egg, add 3 tablespoons of water and apply to scalp  and hair.    This applies to all recipes: Once you are done waiting for the natural ingredients to work their magic wash, rinse, and style hair as usual.|`|J6qPNevJaa	Oh Gurl.  I feel your pain.  I have lived with very curly hair all my life.  I get sooo many compliments on it now...THIRTY-some-odd years later!! With curly/wavy hair, MORE is the keyword. Product is your best friend. Got it?     First of all, condition! and rinse your hair in the shower with cool water.  It closes the hair follicle for less frizz later.  Immediately out of the shower you must apply:  1) I use Bumble and Bumble's 'Prep' first.  It prepares your hair for the next couple products.   2)Then I use a heat resisting spray because you'll be blowdrying alot. I FINGER that through. **Once you get out of the shower, do not comb or brush your hair.  Only fingers and shaking!  3)then I put on a thickening gel because I have thin hair.  If yours is thick, use some sort of gel with silicone as one of the first ingredients.  It'll say something-cone. Dimethicone...blahblah.  4)then I use Pantene's mousse    I have to let this concotion dry for at least 30 minutes for best results.  Then I get to blowdrying.  This is the real tricky part!!!    I have to section off pieces of my hair so i can focus the blowdryers heat.  I pull my hair away from my head and down.  Keep the heat there for  a bit. Then, without dropping the hair, blow COLD air onto it.  It will 'set' the products that will keep your hair from frizzing.  It might be a little 'crunchy' at first, but when it is completely dry, it will frizz a little and get rid of that.  If not, blow dry it a little more with heat.  Don't like the crunchy look.....  Continue with all your hair.    When your finished, shake it out.  And work that volume!! It drives guys crazy! ;)  Love Yourself and your hair gurl.
xb3KpMYVaa	Je crois que ?a date de la prhistoire. Les mecs qui partaient  la chasse se prenaient tout le temps les cheveux dans les branches. Ils ont fini par les couper.

La coiffure a toujours t dicte soit par des codes culturels ou des besoins pratiques.    De nos jours, mme dans notre socit on trouve de tout. Les coupes courtes pour les hommes sont favorises car l'idal viril *actuel* est bien l'homme ras de prs (voire boule  zro) et pour la femme, la longue chevelure douce et soyeuse qui attire les regards.    En revanche, restons en France mais partons pour les annes 20-30 : une mode fminine consistait  se coupe rles cheveux court, la fameuse "gar?onne"    Plus loin,  la renaissance et jusqu'au XIXe sicle dans les pays occidentaux, un homme qui se respectait se devait d'avoir de beaux cheveux longs qui auraient reflt sa bonne sant.    Ceci est plus flagrand dans d'autres cultures comme les indiens d'amrique, o, hommes et femmes devaient avoir des cheveux long (un homme aux cheveux courts est un peu consdr comme un enfant)    Je ne rpoind donc pas exactement  la question, tout simplement parcequ'elle ne s'applique qu' notre poque ;)|`|1d886947a0c8b68214f9317a12d9ae1caa	lol .... je pense que c'est hormonal , en effet les cheveux des filles poussent plus vite et je pense que c'est une question de culture, on s'est habitu  ce que les hommes aient des cheveux courts.|`|5tEnIvouaa	!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!|`|bo21TLckaa	surement car esthetiquemet parlant c'est ce qu'il ya de plus beaux.  lorsque l'on voit un homme aux cheveux longs on se dit c'est un marginal, un sataniste ou un rockeur et une femme au cheveux courts c'est une femme qui fait une chimio ou bien qui est lesbienne..   je pense que ca vient du conformisme, on se conforme a une norme pour ne pas parraitre " bizarre", c'est comme si les hommes mettaient des jupes, quand yen a 100 ki le font c'est marant mais quand yen a 1 qui le fait c'est un gars bizarre.  bref vous voyez ce que je veux dire, c'est une histoire d'etre conforme aux regles de notre societ.|`|rHJyvUV5aa	En France, avoir les cheveux longs (tenus par un catogan en gnral) chez les hommes, tait   une certaine poque plut?t symbole d'aristocratie.

vDG0iA8laa	Before you even do any of the aforementioned advice.... NOTE !!!  Were you asked to send the funds for this in your currency or in Auzzie Dollars - because there is a discrepancy in the two funds...  So you'll have to tell the bank if it's in Auzzie Dollars, and they will make it our accordingly and charge you the difference in the currencies as well as the charge for the money order..  So you may have to purchase an International Money order...  Because if you don't send the amount as per their request, you'll have to go through the whole "program" again...  And a money order is also "insured" so if it goes "lost" you need to go to your bank and put in a claim..  BUT... when you purchase a money order, you will get a receipt / copy of this document... Make sure you obtain it, and KEEP it until the person (s) at the other end confirms they have received the money order, and even then, keep the copy for a few months afterwards  |`|FCNAf6NTaa	You enter a bank or post office, ask for a money order, and then pay for it.
