20080305203622AA6JNxz	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	I am completely confused on my sexuality?	I've been dating guys compulsively since this one guy broke my heart in 7th grade. Thing is, I always stared at girls, I guess attraction? I thought I was bi for a while and dated a girl. I felt fuzzy and fine with her but when she cheated on me after I ditched her to hang out with a boy I liked before I dated her, I ended it and shrugged it off. Then it felt that "bi" didn't fit and I was "straight" and was happy. While dating guys, I got confused and didn't want them touching me nor wanting to be with them nor wanting to kiss them but I didn't let go and kept feeling hurt. I always felt these emotional attachments to girls and after dating a wonderful guy, I was confused and didn't want to date him but wouldn't let go and keep returning, once it felt just SO right kissing him. After months, we ended it and I felt no need to date. I felt so tired of it. But I was staring at girls. Didn't care for guys. Now when I look at girls, I feel horny and attracted. Thing is, I would notice only

Se sonrie por entre la barba y dice:      - "Mi tiempo se llama eternidad y alcanza para todo;      que preguntas querés hacerme?"      - "Ninguna nueva ni dificil para vos...      ?Qué es lo que más te sorprende de los hombres?"

Que primero pierden la salud para tener dinero      y enseguida pierden eldinero para recuperar la salud.      Que por pensar ansiosamente en el futuro, descuidan      su hora actual, con lo que ni viven el presente ni      viven el futuro.      Que viven como si no fueran a morirse, y se mueren      como si no hubieran vivido, y pensar que yo..."         Con los ojos llenos de lágrimas y la voz entrecortada      deja de hablar.      Sus manos toman fuertemente las      mías y seguimos en silencio.      Después de un largo tiempo y para cortar el clima,      le dije:      - "?Me dejás hacerte otra pregunta?"      No respondió con palabras sino con una tierna mirada.      - "Como padre, ?qué les pedirías a tus hijos para este      nuevo milenio?"      - "Que aprendan que no pueden hacer que alguien los ame,      lo que sí pueden es dejarse amar.      Que aprendan que toma a?os construir la confianza,      y solo segundos destruirla.      Que aprendan que lo más valioso no es lo que tienen      en sus vidas, sino a quienes.      Que aprendan que no es bueno compararse con los demás,      pues siempre habrá alguien mejor y alguien peor.      Que aprendan que "rico" no es el que más tiene,      sino el que menos necesita.      Que aprendan que deben controlar sus actitudes,      o sus actitudes los controlarán.      Que aprendan que bastan unos pocos segundos      para producir heridas profundas en las personas      que amamos, y que pueden tardar muchos a?os      en ser sanadas.      Que aprendan que a perdonar se aprende practicando.      Que aprendan que hay gente que los quiere mucho,      pero que simplemente no sabe demostrarlo.      Que aprendan que el dinero lo compra todo menos      la felicidad.      Que aprendan que a veces cuando están molestos      tienen derecho a estarlo,pero eso      no da derecho a molestar a los otros.      Que aprendan que los grandes sue?os      no requieren de grandes alas, sino de      un tren de aterrizaje para lograrlos.      Que aprendan que los amigos de verdad son escasos,      que encontrar uno es encontrar un verdadero tesoro.      Que aprendan que no siempre es suficiente      ser perdonado por otros, que      algunas veces deben perdonarse a sí mismos.      Que aprendan que son due?os de lo que callan y      esclavos de lo que dicen.      Que aprendan que de lo que siembran se cosechan.      Que aprendan que la verdadera felicidad      no es lograr sus metas sino      aprender a ser felíz con lo que tienen.      Que aprendan que la felicidad no es cuestión      de suerte sino producto de sus decisiones,      que pueden decidir ser felíz con lo que son      y tienen ó morir de envidia y celos por lo      que les falta y carecen.      Que aprendan que dos personas pueden mirar      una misma cosa y ver algo totalmente diferente.      Que aprendan que sin importar las consecuencias,      aquellos que son honestos consigo mismos      llegan lejos en la vida.      Que aprendan que a pesar de que piensen      que no tienen nada más que dar,      cuando un amigo llora con ellos      encuentren la fortaleza para vencer sus      dolores.      Que aprendan que retener a la fuerza      a las personas que aman, las aleja      rápidamente de ellos y el dejarlas ir      las deja para siempre a su lado.      Que aprendan que a pesar de que la palabra "amor"      puede tener muchos significados, pierde valor      cuando es usada en exceso.      Que aprendan que amar y querer      no son sinónimos sino antónimos,      el querer lo exige todo y el amar lo entrega todo.      Que aprendan que nunca harán nada      tan grande para que Dios los ame más ni      nada tan malo para que los ame menos.         Simplemente los amo, a pesar de sus conductas.      Que aprendan que la distancia más lejana que puedan estar      de Mí es la distancia de una simple oración...      Y así, en un encuentro profundo, tomados de las manos,   continuamos en silencio.

Cuando estas enamorado de una chica, y no sabes lo que piensa ella de ti, aunque le caes bién y te trata bién......................      Para salir juntos, y comenzar una relación de novios y eso...................?es bueno ser amigos al principio, o es malo?      osea, ?es necesario ser amigo de una chica primero, para ser su novio un tiempo mas tarde??o eso hará que ella pierda el interés en ti?      por otro lado: ?os parecen normales los novios, que se hicieron novios cuando apenas eran conocidos? si pasar por la fase de amistad y eso.................      pues eso, estoy dudando, si los meses de amistad PREVIA al noviazgo, son algo positivo o negativo para enamorar a la chica, y que surja el propio noviazgo.      AYUDADME A ACLARAR MIS IDEAS, gracias a todos.   (simple curiosidad despiadada XD)

20090104174141AATN4XQ	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	What exactly constitutes a "dessert"?	My husband and I constantly have this argument so I figured I'd get other people's opinion.      When the kids want dessert, he says that they should have something like applesauce, or an apple or orange. Something more on the healthy side. Actually, his point is that it doesn't always have to be junk food...dessert can be fruit or something similar. I, on the other hand, think that dessert is the "fun" part of the meal, if you will. I get that his options are healthier, but we make our kids eat their vegetables at dinner, and they usually drink water or milk (OCCASIONALLY a small cup of soda, but even then it's diet). In fact, it's the rule that they have to eat all of their dinner before dessert is even an option. Anyway, in my opinion, once you've eaten all the healthier stuff for dinner, dessert should be a piece of candy, or cake, or ice cream. Something sweet. I mean, have you ever gone to a restaurant and, when ordering dessert, had the option of a bowl of applesauce (yes, you can order that as a side dish at some places, but we're talking about the dessert menu)?      Really, there's no right and wrong here. It's about preference. We just decided to bring the question to YA! and get other's opinion. So, what is "dessert" in your household?      Btw, we have two 5 yr old boys.
20060726112433AAoCRcc	Family & Relationships;Friends	Need some advice. what would you do and how would you feel?	i had a friend i knew since i was in the fourth grade. we were close. where one was, the other was there. i loved her very much. five years ago, i noticed that weeks would pass by before i would hear from her. if i called her, i would get her answering machine. a few weeks turned to two months. i was worried. so called her parents thinking they may know what's wrong with her. she called me (on her time) and told me she's depressed and even thought about suicide. i told her to call me day or night. i'm always there. well, she disapeared again for another 4 months. went to her house and she looked awful. she had gotten worse. i gave her space and hadn' t heard from her for months. when i i was to get married, i couldn't get a hold of her. i tried so hard. after i got married i called her. (i was fed up at this point). she cried and said we're in different places in life and we needed to go our seperate ways. i haven't heard from her since. what should i do? leave it alone?

20081014165507AADIkss	Family & Relationships;Friends	HELP i'm all worried that the guy i really like someone else?	last night we went to this scary halloween event thing with all his friends and my friends. we met up later in the night actually because we bumped into each other. him and his group was with this girl(let's call her kate)'s group and when we went into the mazes she kept clinging on to him and my friend because she was scared.   and then during the night he asked her if she needed his arm.      a)was he trying to be nice?      and when it was time for "kate"'s group to go home, she was supposed to give him a ride and "kate" told him if he wanted to stay later then someone from MY group can give him a ride home and he said "but i want to go with you".      b)was he just trying to be nice to her?      but the thing is i held his hand when i got scared and my friend held onto his hand as well.    he seems really nice and doesn't seem player at all.      and another thing, we were going on this roller coaster and "kate" didn't want to ride it for a stupid reason and he kept saying he wanted kate to sit next to him. he said that he didn't really want to ride alone but i don't think that was the reason at all.      but my question is, from what i told you above(i know it was confusing), do you think he might like her, or am i just paranoid?
20081022123106AAwqMWX	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Adult Question....No kids allowed.?	This is kind of embarrassing, but i need some opinions. My g/f is very experimental (sexually). We have tried many things. Things she liked, things I like. Lately it has been getting hotter and heavier in the bedroom. She has asked me to try a*** beads or and b*** plug. I have never had anything near my back door and I am skeptical about the situation. I am open to maybe trying it, but I don't know if that is something I would like  or be terrified of. The thought kinda turns me on.      I would like to hear thoughts and opinions. Thanks

Now im absolutely sure he(Tom) likes me, i could give you a list of all the things he does when he flirts  but i wont cos the list would go on an u wouldnt wanna read it :P.       Now were getting quite close. i recently got in a small fight with one of my friends, He was followed me when i walked away, and said dont worry about her,and comforted me in a sorta ''you still got me!'' way. i just wanted to hug him for being so sweet lol      Oh yeah! everyone kinda hinted we should get together on the bus back from camp, one of the bf/gfs were making out beind the teachers' backs and the rest of the back of the bus were like:    Hey Tom! You and *insert my name here* should play some tonsil hockey! we looked at each other quickly, sorta embarrased        my question is, do you think he it will progress into a relationship naturally? or what move do i make to take it further?       PS: he has never had a gf, unbelievably, apparently wants to kiss someone and we're both quite shy apart from flirting, know i like him and he seems really happy when we talk on msn

20081013124757AAnYAu6	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Two years have past - and Im still heartbroken, how do I move on?	I dont wanna drone on and depress everyone but Im stuck in a total rut and cant pull myself out. I had the perfect boyfriend, we were together for two years. Towards the end of our relationship our group of friends split in two and went in very dif directions and we just drifted apart and split. I tried to get back with him for 6 months but he wasnt interested. I got a new boyfriend but we split up 9 months later cos I still loved my ex (we'll call him k).  K has only kissed one girl, once since we split and he said it was a mistake to his friends. Its been two years since we split in Dec. We hooked up a few times at the start of the year but then fell out. I told him how I felt and he said although he cares for me too he just wanted to be on his own. We fell out for a good reason to be honest - he was always close to my brother and my brother got seriously ill and nearly died. i asked K to go see him in hospotal as my brother asked for him and he didnt go so now we dont speak. hes a really decent nice guy it was so out of character to do that and it really hurt. I just wanna be with him so much, I still love him so much and I cant move on.       I need to get over this cos its a total lost cause isnt it?      (so much for not droning on!)
20081014171340AA6mfN3	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	How could I get her to notice me?	I've just been really lonely lately, to a point where I'm basically just depressed.

I need some advice on how to talk to her more and to get her to notice me, without just walking up and suddenly talking to her, because that would seem kinda weird. lol      A few things that might help...   We are in the same grade, but we have no classes together...   We ride the same bus...   Some of my friends are friends with her...      Also.. today I found out that one of my friends kinda likes her, too.   what do I do about that?

20081030211006AACQMZT	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	I have a question about this shy boy...?	Okay, so there's this boy in my class (it's a college class by the way) whose really shy and I have an inkling that he might like me. I never see him talking to anyone during the break we have during class and he pretty much just keeps to himself.    I'd talk to him, you know... but I'm just as shy as he is. I mean, what if he doesn't like me at all and I go up to him and he's like, "Why is she talking to me?    Anyway, some things that I've noticed he does around me is stare at me when he thinks I'm not looking and randomly being in the same place I am. Don't know if those point to OMG HE LIKES ME... but what are some things I should be noticing that he does?    Oh, and how should I start a conversation with him? I've never talked to him, besides saying sorry the two times I opened the door and he just happened to be behind it and I hit him... stupid I know ;D

20060916100733AA63fMH	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Can a woman have sex with somebody and remain emotionally detached?	i'm in a relationship in which we have agreed that we're not going to restrict ourselves, but over time we've come to have a real relationship even though we still go out.  i'm pretty sure that she had sex with somebody last night.  so i'm wondering, is it possible for her to have a one night stand with no strings attached like a guy can?  do any of you know of a woman who has been able to this - and not just speculate that it can be done - because i've never slept with a woman that wasn't all about making it into something bigger afterwords.

20061211201832AAfyAER	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	I really like this guy. How do I know if he likes me back?	I have band with him and I have had a massive crush on him since school started. He is a year older than me, and is the most polite, mannerly guy I have ever met. He is kind of quiet though, and it takes a while to get to know him. He has just started to talk to me a little more. I have noticed that he always looks at me when I am playing my flute in band. My best friend asked him if he liked me. She said that he just stared at her for a long time then said quietly, "No." My best friend is his best friend's friend. His best friend told MY best friend that he is shy and doesn't feel comfortable around new people. It is still a mystery to me though and I want to solve it. Please help me. He kind of just stares for a long time, and actually laughs at my jokes. (no one ever laughs at my jokes except for him)

20070131084202AApmA5Y	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Is this a good idea for Valentine's Day?	My boyfriend and I have decided not to celebrate Valentine's Day because our one-year-anniversary is ten days later on the 24th so we decided to celebrate everything that day. The only thing we're doing for Valentine's is going out with my parents on the 16th (everywhere is too packed the day of Valentine's and it will also be their 22nd wedding anniversary). I'm just worried that he may get me something on Valentine's anyway and I won't have anything for him. So, I was thinking, he's a huge Georgia Tech fan (and I could get him a little teddy bear with the logo or Buzz on it with a card and maybe a rose, just in case, and if he doesn't get me anything I could just keep it and give it to him on our anniversary. Good idea, too corny, or should I just not worry about getting anything until the anniversary?

20070105095749AAAFuA4	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Relationship intelligent women:  Please tell me what you think of this...?	After a bad fight about a week ago my live in fiance told me she needed space. I apologized profusely but it just seemed to make her angrier. So I temporarily moved out.      She called me on Wednesday to talk about something trivial then let me know how hurt and angry and upset she was about the fight. She told me not to call her unless I needed something. She also said the dogs missed me. And when I told her I was looking for roommate she told me not to do anything till I talked to her.      When I asked what our status together or apart she said she didnt know. She said she wasn't going to see anyone else, but she didn't care what I did. She said why should it matter what our status was, and to just do whatever my conscience tells me to do.      After hearing her out I sent her an email to her work that she wouldnt get till next day, just apologizing and letting her know things could still be good between us, but I would leave it up to her to contact me.      How will things work out?

20061204155317AADt3RM	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Why do people worry so much about finding an attractive person to be with?	In my opinion attractive people are usually the most rude and arrogant and disgusting of anyone else. They know they're beautiful so all they care about is how they look with someone else. Why would someone want to be with a person that will probably get tired of them after a while and move on to the next model? Also being with an attractive person makes you more worried that someone is going to try and steal your 'beauty' away from you.       I know this sounds bitter and yes I am just one of those plain ordinary looking people, but I don't really find attractive people that great. I want someone that I can talk to and laugh at things with and to be comfortable with when I'm being ugly and dumb on my off days. What else could be better than that?

20070415145502AAwDUVV	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	How can I move on and what should I do about my best friend?	My bestfriend and I fell for eachother. Then we cooled down. He began dating a girl. I told him I didn't want to be in the middle so I withdrew myself from the situation. He said if he had to choose he chose me. We started acting as though we were together, but truly he never left her. I found out. I am so heartbroken and done with him. He says he still loves me and wants to continue being bestfriends, but I am so much closer to hating him rather then loving him. He played me. I did everything for him. I cooked, cleaned, gave him sex, did little things and was his bestfriend. THere is no way I can pretend we are okay. The sad thing is I still love him. But My heart is so hurt. What should I do? What do you think will happen between he and I? I really thought he was made to love me. Our times together are  full of life. We know each other so well he could write my bio and I could write his, but he hurt me, really bad! What would you do and if moving on is the answer how do I move on?

My boyfriend and I have been together for about 6 months in all.  Though this is our second time around my parents never knew about the first.  This first time we met and went to the mall and stuff without my parents even being suspiscious.  But tired of being sneaky we decided maybe my parents should meet him.  So I begged mom and dad to let him come over and they agreed as long as I got the house straightened up.  I did and then I went and met him at the gas station to follow me home.  Well to make a long story short when dad got home we had pizza and instead of chatting and getting to know him we watched a movie and dad locked himself in his room and would hardly speak.  Then the second meeting when we sat down to eat dad studied his food and never spoke.  After both these times my parents of expressed there disproval for my bf who I love.  It breaks my heart... especially since they won't TRY to get to know him.

Last week i told a friend of mine that it would be better that we didn't talk so i can get over my crush on him since he's in a long distance relationship with another girl, as a matter of fact, she's in the Phillipines and he's here in the US. Before this happened, we joked around about hooking up, but then i felt bad and hurt about us joking about it. I told him that i really wanted to do it since i like him, but he has a gf and that it wouldn't be wise if we did it. Anyway, i got angry with him since he didn't respond back to me after I texted him Happy New Year's and I ended up sending him another text calling him a "dog" and that i didn't want to have anything to do with him, then later i apologized via text. Then the next day , I wrote him a letter telling him how i felt hurt about us joking around, and the fact we just treat each other as professionals. He's ignoring me, though seems like he still wants me to see him, like when he's talking on the phone.

20070801085954AAAxL37	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	On a walk?	So today i am supposed to hang out with a my friends and this kid that i like and he likes me. Last time i hung out with everyone my friend just kept bugging him to kiss me and going on and on so i took him aside from everyone and told him he didnt have to listen to my friend. Well i probably was going to kiss him there but he wouldnt look me in the eye at all and said something stupid that didnt relate to the subject. So i texted him later because he left and was supposed to come back but never did. I talked to him about the kiss and he wants privacy so i was thinking that we could go on a walk at night. I want to kiss him then but it will be awkward because we would both know were leaving everyone for a kiss. Is there anything i can say to make it obvious for a kiss to happen. A line like how do you say kiss me in spanish or something like that.

20070129102556AAcyqxM	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Is it friendship or something else?	So my friend "Rick" and I recently started sleeping together. Were truly good friends and nothing can come between us. Everytime were together and its just me and him , him acts like hes my boyfriend , you know the arm around the shoulder while watching tv, holding hands in public and a lot of kissing which usually he starts the first move. When were near friends hes more relax , but hes alway near me . At the bar there will be a room fulled with good looking girls but he will pick me out and sit beside me all night, make sure that I get home and everyonce in a while we dance a slow dance together. I asked him if he wanted something more before but he didnt want the commitment due to his career choice which has him gone foe 2 months now. So is he acting like a normal friend or is he acting like he wants something with me but not fully. Im confused and need help.

If it were another friend, I'd get her a CD or some jewelry or whatever. But she always gives me awesome gifts! She's given me a homemade memory box with pictures of us in it, and a notebook that she designed herself (because we both love to write). I want to get her something as sentimental as those things.      Plus she just started going to a different school. We've been besties since we were 5 or 6, so I want to get her something she'll love and that will make her remember me in the midst of all of her new friends.      Any creative ideas?
20071124074117AAbNW3L	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	What should I do?	Should I tell him how I feel?   This summer I fell in love with a boy that worked at a summer camp. I'm 16 and he is 18. We would stay up for hours and talk. I never asked him if he liked me or not because I was too shy. The problem is that I live in Spain and he lives in the UK. We have kept in close contact via the internet and I go to the UK really often. I am going to see him this Christmas as well. Also I am moving to the U.K in a couple of years to study at university . He got a girlfriend recently but I think they have split up. Assuming that they have, when I go and see him should I tell him how I feel?

20061117093915AA64plT	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	He's flirting on myspace, what to do?	My boyfriend left his myspace profile up the other day while I was over at his house and he left for the store. Well...I snooped a little and read some of the messages that he had sent and received from a couple of girls.      The girls are all out of state, and they are not his friends.   I could tell by the messages a couple of the girls just sent him a message to say "hi" and they thought he was hot.    I guess they randomly saw his profile and wanted to say "hello."   However he wrote them back and told them he thought they were nice looking too, and he never once mentioned he had a girlfriend.      Also, his myspace is still set at "Single" even though we have been dating for five months. However,    My myspace profile is set at "in a relationship."      Anyway, was he wrong? Is it just harmless flirting since the girls are in another state?
20061129104716AAoCczs	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Is this guy throwing a hint to me, or am I reading too much into it?	I live out west and I have been communicating via emails and through myspace with a guy who lives on the east coast. We both have mutual friends here in the west, but we have never met personally.      Anyway, we have been very flirty in our messages to one another.      Then the other day I ran into one of our mutual aquaintences and she told me he was in a relationship (had a girlfriend).   He never mentioned this to me in our communications and his myspace is at "SINGLE."      Well, he just sent me a message saying he was coming out west to my town in Febuary and wanted to know what the weather was like here in Febuary.      I know he could easily ask one of his other friends who live out here what the weather will be like.      Do you think he was trying to see what I would say when I found out he was coming to my town??   Was he trying to line up a "hook up" while away from his girlfriend?      Or.....is is just curious about the weather?

I was a fool on discussing my problems I had with my sis to my aunt. She promised she won't tell anyone but told everything to her daughers. They told my sis everything about what I told my aunt along with a bunch of lies. When my brother inlaw went back home to my country to visit he found out that my aunt had called someone back home to my country & said that my mom & I are traveling country after country looking for a man to marry but her kids all have white boyfriends & have college degree. I went to europe with mom to visit a sick relative last year not to find a man. I met a wonderful white man at church & now engaged.

When he is not free she decides to text, phone or meet me just to staisfy me, not meaning it . Basically only when convienent for her.   I have told her many times how I feel, and she does not listen and always has an answer. I have texted her recently again, saying I miss the old days, the fun, and said also that I am not trying to be awkward but only telling the truth. She hardly ever replies to my texts now, and we never meet up alone now. I hate her boyfriend for taking all my time, and am just fed up with how I have been treated. She may be nice to me, but I have just lost interest really...

I don't want to be tortured by his lies anymore. He really let me down and he will only feel like he won if I call him because I'm down and I miss him. I do miss him, but I don't want to let him know that. I don't want to be with a liar. Should I not tell my friends what happened?

20070317165404AA3s0wp	Family & Relationships;Weddings	Una  lettera d' amore  secondo voi può funzionare ?	Ho scritto   circa tre sabati fà dopo essere tornato dalla discoteca ,  tra le 5 e le 6 del mattino, pensate come mi piace questa ragazza, una lettera dove volevo dirgli tutto quello che provo per lei. Pochi giorni dopo mi sono dichiarato a lei, senza la lettera chiaramente , e non ha funzionato . Però quella lettera non l' ha ricevuta io l' ho scritta con l' anima e vorrei dargliela per farle capire a fondo quello che provo per lei che và ben aldilà dell' attrazione fisica ma non ho il coraggio di dargliela per paura di essere preso in giro dopo che mi ha già detto di no , pur dicendo che le faceva piacere del mio interesse . Ma a me piacerebbe correre questo rischio anche perchè voglio che lei sappia tutto quello che ho provato per lei e non si deve limitare a quell' unica frase ( mi piaci) detta con estrema timidezza . Voi ragazze che mi consigliate l' apprestereste una lettera d' amore scritta col cuore o no??

20070425014041AAgFuSx	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Equal Oppertunity Parenting. Sex For Boys And Girls?	I just got into a huge fight with my brother-in-law about boy and girl sexually. He stated that he wouldnt mind if he discovered his son was sexually active however he would be appalled if his daughter was. I stated i woulnt mind if my son or daughter was having sex as long as they were safe. I argued why should my rules be any different for my son than my daughter. He replied because my daughter would be talked about more and called "easy". He said "I don't make the rules that's just the way it is." He also said i shouldnt be surprised if my daughter "turned out to be a slut" beacuse of this. I disagree. i grew up listening and watching Madonna who taught me that it's okay to be a woman and be sexual. I think society should change it's view of this subject.  What do you think of my brother-in-law's comments? Is that the way it should be? Why are women looked down on for being sexual when men arent?

20070508115706AAENNHR	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	How can I tell if this girl likes me?	Hi all, I'm not too hot on the whole dating thing really, but there's a girl I like alot, and I've been getting on with very well, and I've spotted what I thought where a few of the 'attraction' signs. Anyone, after a month or so since I met her, I got the courage to ask her out for a drink to get to know her better, and she agrees to it. She gave me her number so that I could contact her to arrange where/when to meet.        Anyway, obviously I go away feeling quite chuffed with myself. I texted her the next morning, after asking a mate where a good pub/bar in our town to go would be for a date, and I didn't get a reply. I texted again much later, asking if she got my reply, and basically she didn't want to meet anymore.      Why would a girl agree to going out, and give her number, and then change her mind (she was quite apologetic in her messages)? Also, does there seem to be anything iv done wrong? Have i misinterpreted signs? so many questions...lol      Any help would be great! cheers

I've met this guy causually like 3 times now and am completely confused about how I feel about him. Everytime I'm face to face with him, it seems like he's just a really good friend, we have long 6 hour talks where I'm in heaven just talking to him. But everytime I go back home and think about it again, I fall for him. I love being with him and everything about him, but then again I think to myself that his politeness and attentiveness is what he does for any other girl. Apparently he dates around a lot so I was put off by that but, what should I do about it? I would hate to lose what we have right now because I really do love it but these feelings kept inside is hard.
20070802212031AAfKtrm	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Does She Like Me??????	Okay, So I asked this girl out 3 months ago and she rejected me, but since then we have become really really close. She is calling or txting me constantly, our convos on msn can last for atleast 3 hours and we hang out all the time.      We are there for each other when we are upset or need support. We compliment each other (I call her beautiful, she tells me im her "go to guy"). We both trust each other (I tell her personal stuff, she tells me personal stuff). When I set myself up for an insult she uses it to her advantage, or vice versa. We find ourselves play wrestling with each other on a regular basis, when we are hanging out in a group she pulls me away to be alone with me.      Here is why I am unsure: Her best friend told me she doesn't like me, but when the 3 of use are hanging out the best friend makes the girl I like spend time with me alone which confuses me.

20071120153754AAfPtCQ	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Does he like me!?	I went to the movies with an old friend of mine, and I have had a crush on him for quite some time. My two cousins came with me. My crush took the seat next to me, and we talked for a couple of minutes. He thanked me for inviting him to come along. I noticed that during the movie his legs kept fidgeting, but he was leaning on the arm of the chair towards me. He looked over at me once or twice. Our legs were kind of close together, but he didn't bother moving them. He leaned closer to my side, with his face towards the screen, just like he was just watching the movie. He seemed pretty comfortable around me, besided his legs fidgeting in the beginning. He said he had fun afterwords, and I said, "Yeah, we should hang out again sometime." and he said, "We should, but not this weekend, I have to go to my grandparents for thanksgiving." We message each other on myspace five times last night, and today my friend told me we should date and that we'd make a cute couple.

20071122131551AASoNAl	Family & Relationships;Friends	I don't know what to do...?	Two years ago, when I was thirteen, my friends and I used to go to the mall and hang out with a bunch of people pretty often...one person we hung out with was someone named Donald and I don't remember how old he was then but I think he was like 16-18 years old. He never did anything, usually we would all just talk and stuff, and he was always with his girlfriend anyway.         We dropped contact over like the past year and a half I'd say and haven't really talked, but now we started talking again.       I'm now fifteen, and he asked me if we could hang out again sometime...and well it's kind of awkward not just because of the age difference, but also I haven't talked to him in so long I wouldn't know what to say..      Should I try to get another big group to all hang out again? I don't really want to hang out with him alone..it would probably be awkward.

20090226114557AATPMck	Family & Relationships;Weddings	How much money did you get at your wedding?	Before I get attacked, we would never ASK anyone for money as a gift nor are we trying to calculate how much we would get. I heard this girl at work today talking about how she is inviting 175 people to her wedding so she is expecting to receive $17,000-$20,000 from guests at her wedding ($100 per person is the accepted norm around here to give at weddings) but I think she is wrong.  It seems to me that even though some people would give more than the norm, some people might give much less or even bring a gift.      How has your experience been?  Also (and this terrifies me and strikes me as being super rude), did anyone NOT bring a gift or money at all?      Thank you!

Did i do something wrong by doing so? Can anyone suggest a way to shut her up for good?

He hurt me, I woudnt tell him I loved him etc. Today I am with him in work, he talks to every woman bar me and is kind and considerate to them. Me he is OK with but ignores a bit and when we do talk he is distant. He chats up these girls in front of me, I say how well they look, he gets annoyed/ sharp with me. Then this other male friend comes along, sees me there and my guy behind me and smiles deeply at me for a long time, so I actually have to say 'what's up'? and says you are better looking than any of the girls in here. I get embarrassed, the guy I like walks away. Moments later the guy I like touches my arm to ask me something, I respond without thinking and put my arm around him. Then he touches a younger woman in front of me with the same intimacy. Later he sees me and avoids me. Later again, he talks to a woman he told me before was not sexy and who is not into him and is all familiar with her, but as I pass he asks me if I am OK. Am I in the friend zone? Why did my other male friend do that really complimentary thing for me, saying I was nice looking in front of my fella. He never says things like that this male friend. It was all weird.the guy I like is a total confident with women, big time.

20090226114826AAuOpHB	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Have i just proven that personanilty wins over looks in loving relationships?	Because theres this girl in my university who is very attractive and loads of 'good looking' guys have asked her out and she turned them all down.   I personally dont like girls who walk around like sluts.   But she is really pretty and dresses like a normal mature woman and she is nice to, and thats why i like her, shes funny and nice.      Well, to be quite honest, im not george clooney when coming to looks and charms, but im not really ugly either, im just average.      Anyways, yesterday i was walking into the library, and the only seat available was the one next to that girl, so i asked to sit next to her and she said yes.      So for the first 5 minutes there was a silence, and then i asked her about some of the work we were doing.   And i put my only technique i know into practice when i try to friends with a girl, i make jokes or i play sarcasm.   And they worked, i love her smile so much :)      Then she asked me what i thought of her as a person.   I was a little shaken because it was completely random,   But i told her that i liked her because there are not many women like her today,that she is nice, pretty and that she doesnt act like a woman totally obsessed with looks like most women.   That she was different and i told her thats why i liked her.   She smiled after this and thanked me.   She kissed me just on the cheek.      After 10 minutes she said she had to go and she handed me a piece of paper to help me with my notes as i was a little stuck,   and since i already had to them i was a little puzzled,   then i looked on the back of the paper and her phone number was on the back.      It was basically her phone number and a heart next to it.      Score.      :)

A very young waitress kindly took my order and sparked a conversation. We talked about the economy and business and how everyone has been affected.       I don't think she was just being nice. There was a lot of eye contact. She kept walking around the bar, passing me as I stood waiting for my food. She occasionally glanced at me, made sure I was ok, etc. She even preened her hair. Was a little stiff walking by. When talking, she maintained eye contact... so did I... and she blinked several times. No matter what, she kept talking and talking and talking. It kept going and going. Most bartenders I met, don't really do this.       Can anyone explain her behavior?    Thoughts?

Last night, he started talking about sharing some of that with another woman.  We are not seriously involved.  I just got out of a relationship.  This is my fall back guy for late night visits.  I wouldn't really call him a booty call.  We are really good friends.  Last night, he just kept on about this other woman.  It really upset me to be honest, but what could I really say.  I don't know why he all of a sudden started talking about this woman.  He knows I really don't care for her.  I told him that if he went there, I would never have $ex with him again.  It is simply because she is not a "clean" woman.  How can I explain all this to him?  He thinks it is jealousy. I told him I had my reasons, but didn't know how to explain them.  Please help!
20090216120608AAw3JiT	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Help what do you think this guy was trying to say...?	So I had been having a 1:1 sexual relationship with this guy. Lately he had been calling and starting to show he was wanting more. Well I was starting to lose interest, he really had nothing in soul, wasn't the Caliber of men I dated. I did test his intentions a couple of times and he did pass.    I was perplexed by him to say the least. Everything he did said he loved me, everything he said was saying it was just sex. Usually it is the actions that I look at not the words, but he was an exception to the rules.    So I decided to tell him I was going to dated and were was he mentally in our relationship? he said it was just sex and then put great sex into the sentence. So I went on my date. The next day, he left a message saying that he hopes I was not mad at him. So I felt he needed to know that, I had been dating all along that I just want to know were he was emotionally in the relationship, and I was not mad. He was not the man. That I had not broken our agreement. He called back with a message and said I won't call you, you don't call me. Why did he get mad? I know he loved me. He was just afraid to tell me. He would hold me and care how I felt no guy just looking for sex cares like that in bed. Am I wrong, Did he love me and I hurt him. Help what do I do.

20090226113501AAxMIFc	Family & Relationships;Weddings	How long should I wait for a proposal?	My boyfriend and I have been together for 2 years now and we have a 5 month old son together. Im planning on moving in with him in May but other than that he shows no sign of commitment. Im 20 and hes 31, my view on it is that at his age if hes not ready now chances are hes not ever going to be. It seems to me that all he wants to do is drink and have fun and not have any responsibility. Every time I bring marriage up it starts a huge fight and I end up crying and feeling bad about pressuring him. So I'm wondering how long is long enough and when, if ever should I give him an ultimatum and break it off?

He's new this school year... and Id noticed he'd look at me quite a lot.. and one of my friends noticed a few times too.

I dont know if Im just imagining him looking at me, and theres a possibility he could like my friend which is why he came up, but I dont notice him looking at her (but a lot of guys have liked my friend coz shes "hot") Im not ugly and a few guys have liked me but Im not amazingly good looking or anything... I just I dunno I really like him... so could he like me? Just give me any advice or insight or whatever.. thanks

I took this painting class because I'm finishing my requirements and whatnot. Anyways, my art teacher seems really young and he's really talented, but I get a weird feeling everytime I'm with him/ he's by me. Everytime I'm painting he gets really close to me (behind me) and whispers in my ear what I'm doing wrong. I've told him it makes me feel uncomfortable but he says artists shouldn't be "disturbed". Whatever that means.. Anyways, i want to tell him how I feel but I know now that I'm 18 I can't really tell the school because I'm no longer considered a minor, so technically he's not doing anything wrong.. I know it sucks but what are some other ways I can avoid these situations? I can't leave the class though, it's too late to do these transfers.      Any advice would be great

20090226114609AApkAwZ	Family & Relationships;Family	What would you do with this TV?	Okay, so here's a long story. My mom lives in a nursing care center. All she has is her bed and her TV. She had a smaller TV that was given to her by my uncle. My husband and I decided to give her our TV. It's newer, bigger, and has a flat screen. We placed it in her room and left a phone message for my uncle to ask him if he wants his old TV back. He never replied. So, it's been sitting in a spare room, unplugged, collecting dust. My grandmother kept calling and calling us, leaving these weird phone messages stating the big TV is bad for my mom's eyes and demanded we put the little TV back in. I think my grandmother has some form of psychiatric problems or something, b/c she has also stated in the past that the FBI is tapping her phone, etc.       So, we just ignored her demands and eventually her phone calls. We did ask the nursing staff at the nursing care center if the bigger TV is okay and they said it was. Now, we're going to move and we need to do something with this TV.       If we leave it on my uncle's doorstep then we're afraid he'll give it to my grandmother who will then replace the TV. Just a possibility.      Do we sell it in a yardsale?   Do we leave it on my uncle's doorstep (who ignored us)?      What would you do?

20090226115915AAc23h8	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	My fiancé and I are moving  away from each other for  financial reasons, how do we  make it work?	We have been together for 2 years, and planning on getting married next April, but we currently both live in CT where he has a job, but currently no where is hiring, and I can't find a job. And we can't save money if one paycheck is already supporting 2 people. And our lease is up this April, and we don't have enough for a new deposit, and we have to move because our landlord won't let us renew, too many noice complaints. So he's moving in with his brother. But a guarenteed job has fallen into me one town away from my grandmother in SC. Now we were planning on moving out of state because of the economy, and to start a new life together somewhere else because we hate CT, and it's so expensive to live there. So this is a perfect opportunity to do that. So I'm moving into my grandmothers, but he can't come because they are traditional, and saving up $9G by Feb 14, and then he would move down with me, and then find a job. So it's a positive move, but very diffcult. But I know we can do it. But what are some ideas to keep the flame going strong. We already are on the same family plan for our cells, so we can talk anytime. And my family comes back to CT often, but like every few months. Like I've looked online and found articles, but they don't really fit to my situation, so I wanted real people's suggestions and input.

20090226114902AAc32jt	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	A question about marriage?	The word marriage is ever so a controversial topic to me. I always asked the question: "Why bother to get married?" if you love someone buy them a ring, declare your love for them and just live on with them. Why waste so much money on marriages when you can save it for helping your relationship or future children.        I understand that religion comes into things, but why when I mention my own belief of marriage to my peers at school am I met with narrowed eyes and discontent glaces?  I'm in year 11 you know, so that's that is the  reason I would ask this question, heck people get married at 16, God knows why! I would rather enjoy my life!      Anyway, I'll stop boring you now, is it a bad thing about my view of marriage? After all, I always argue and say, "If you don't get married you can't get divorced and get your money taken." Imagine the waste of money spent on the marriage :O.       Also, will my view of marriage affect my relationships with women? I'm not a person that believe love don't exist, just that you can love without marriage, its just a signed piece of paper after all!!      Thanks I want to clear this up!

20080708081945AAH5hys	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Is he not worth my time? Should I forget him?	There's a guy that isn't looking for a relationship right now but says he wants to be friends...I really like him. I'm fine with just being friends because I respect the fact that he doesn't' want a relationship right now. Here's the thing. I haven't heard from him in nearly 2 weeks even though I had asked him (called him) to go grab some coffee about a week and a half ago. He said he couldn't so I was like, that's fine just let me know what's good for you. Well, I have heard nothing back and I have made no effort to get in touch with him because to be honest, I was a little upset that he wouldn't even return my call. So, basically I've gotten mixed signals from him...says he wants to hang out with me yet makes no effort to get in touch with me. Should I try to contact him once more or just completely forget him? Thanks for your advice!

Anyway, he always gretts me by coming up behind me when I lease expect it and tickling/sqeezing my stomach. I don't mind too much, my friends and I actually laugh, but for a guy that I just became friends with, don't you think it's a little too touchy-feely?      It's not like I'm that uncomfortable around him, but it is a little strange, especially because I'm a year younger than him. He's not a perv, and he's actually very nice, (He helps special eduacation students at our school and is very nice to them.) but guys often misinterpret my friendliness and start "liking" me, and I like someone else, so I don't want that to happen!

All of my other guy friends do not do this and even get embarrassed when I see them looking at other girls. When I mention how a guy is good looking, he say "I don't want to hear about it" with a snotty tone.

One of my best friends just met a guy who is a sophmore.. she is only in 8th grade and she already wants to date him. My other friend and I keep telling her dating in high school is a lot different than dating in middle school (especially where she goes). I am really worried about her, she is not listening to me, she doesn't believe he would do anything to hurt her or take advantage of her. She already has a reputation for being a slut, and I don't want other people to think of her that way. I know that her mom would not approve of her dating someone 3 years older than she is, but she doesn't care and threatened to date him no matter what her mom says. I don't want anything to happen to her.. I know this guy is bad news, but I don't know who to go to about it. Should I tell her mom or someone else or just let her figure it out for herself?

(as i'm trying to get out of homework) i was wonder what group people would think i belonged to, if any.   Music:- i like lots of different music. my iPod ranges from girls aloud to a few odd songs by the smiths, but it mainly includes bands like the killers, fall out boy, Elliot Minor, the kaiser chiefs and the wombats.   Dress:- I don't usually dress in a paticular way. Out of school i mainly wear jeans with a T shirt with trainers or converse unless its the summer. If i'm going out then i'll wear a dress (sometimes with skinny jeans ) or a skirt with heels.    thanks , :~Lemur~:

20090226113224AAaoWCs	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Best friend... does he want more?	sorry its sooo long. help!      so, me and my best friend jarad have been really close for like 5 years now. and recently things have been different. we used to talk on the phone a few times a week, when we were free. now, he calls every night after his parents go to bed (he's a sr. in high school, im a jr.) and we talk for at least 2 hours every day. there has been a crazy amount of eye contact recently, and him picking on me. we joke around sooo much. sooo much. to the point that i said something to a teacher about him yesterday and she said "he teases you and you love every second of it" i've noticed within the past couple days that when we're in a crowd, he looks at me when he talks, even when he's addressing the group. also, the other night was telling me how he was joking around in front of my friends and called me an idiot, (??) and then started singing You are the music in me from high school musical 2 with me. it sounds like he likes me right? we've had the whole "should we date" conversation about a year ago, and he said he just sees me just as a sister. what is this crazy boy wanting? how would you handle this? is this a change of heart?
20090226113345AA36YUF	Family & Relationships;Other - Family & Relationships	Mature adults only, please answer I need help?	Me and this girl have been dating for 2 months now and things had been going great. We both agreed about a week and a half ago that we were really happy with the way things were going. At that time she also told me "shes lucky I didnt give up on her", that it always makes her smile when I tell her I'm thinking about her, and she would tell me randomly that she was thinking about me. We live a couple hours apart so only see each other once or twice a week, but when we do we're very affectionate, sometimes kissing for long periods of time on end and laughing and joking around alot.      The past week and a half have been different though. Coming off of a really romantic valentine's day weekend we are talking less. We usually text each other and the enthusiasm that I'm used to her having seems gone. We barely talked the last week and a half and she said she's been very busy with school and work but that she didnt forget about me and that she likes the way things are good and she's doing good.       Friday she said she definitely wants to see me this week, but our texts are still more sporadic and less "lovie dovie" I guess. I decided I would give her her space and didnt contact her until monday just to see when she wanted to get together. She got back to me tuesday, apologized for not getting back to me sooner, but said she was studying and running errands, etc.       Tuesday we set up plans for thursday night, but again last night we texted back and forth and the enthusiasm wasn't there. Her tone and everything was just noticably off. I asked her where we were going today because I made a suggestion Tuesday and she said she "likes that idea". Anyhow I'm seeing her tonight.      I don't know why she's been acting so strange lately. I'm afraid she's trying to create distance from me or something but I can't understand why. Everything was going perfectly and she was reciprocating my feelings for her and vice versa. Does it sound like I have anything to worry about tonight like she will drop the bomb on me and reject me suddenly? Would her feelings change despite nothing really happening? She's been working everynight and school, but I've been giving her space for that. I'm really afraid she's going to break my heart right when we were making a strong bond and heading into a relationship.

20090226114205AASsrS8	Family & Relationships;Weddings	Boyfriend's marriage plans, should I ask questions?	I have been dating my boyfriend going on 7 years. We have had "the talk" a few times, but mainly just me trying to fish for how he feels. It wasn't until a fight last winter when he realized I was just frustrated and confused as to why he was incapable of discussing the matter. He finally told me he would like to eventually marry me and I felt a bit more at ease. I didn't think much of it though, since it wasn't brought up again and it seemed so far in to the future the way he said it.       A few days ago, I had a heart to heart talk with his sister, who asked about our future. I told her how I had no clue and he really avoids the topic. I did mention the fight and the discussion. This is when she told me that he has openly talked about marrying me to her several times.       The next night, she brought up topics like, ring and honeymoon plans during dinner. He answered them like it was no big deal. I finally asked him why he talked to her about this stuff and not me and why he wasn't uncomfortable when she brought it up in front of me. He said he wanted it to be more of a surprise when he does it and he has been planning to do it within the next two years.      Well, everything in the above has happened within the past 3 days and I feel like I have so many questions, but don't want to annoy the crap out of him with my curiosity and excitement.      So, if you were in my shoes, would you ask more questions or would you leave it be now that you know? If you say ask more questions, what would you ask?

He used to talk in class and I would sometimes turn around and he was just staring at me while talking. I don't know, but it felt like there was a connection between us, some sexual tension, or whatever, call me mad or insane but I could just FEEL it you know? Like you do with some people. I didn't make a move on him and I know he wouldnt make a move on me...I mean I'm his student for god sakes.      And then a couple of weeks ago he just stopped completely, and now he blanks me in lessons, he never talks over my work with me and avoids me. Whenever he does talk to me he tells me off.   Help?!

20090226114926AAvcoVU	Family & Relationships;Weddings	Can't decide on what type of ceremony...?	My fiance and I are having a hard time trying to decide what to do.  I would prefer to have a large wedding, reception, all of the traditional things people do at weddings (or most anyway) while he would prefer to have something small.  If it was his way, it would actually be done with just the two of us, two witnesses and a JOP and no get together with family or friends or anything.  He is very nervous and uncomfortable with being in front of people, especially people that he doesn't know, which is understandable.      I love him and want to give him what he wants and feels comfortable with, but I also want to have family and friends there.  I want to celebrate the day with not only him but the people who have been there for me most, if not all, of my life. I know that a marriage is about the life-long partnership and commitment that we have and that should be enough.  But is it wrong for me to want more? Is it wrong for me to ask him to do something he doesn't truly want, but would be willing to do, just because I want the whole "traditional wedding day"?  I know that he would do it if it came down to it, just as I would do what he wants.  We both just want the other to be happy, but I'm afraid one of us may be disappointed and hurt either way.        Any ideas or suggestions on how can we come to an agreement/compromise?  (We have an awesome relationship and great communication.  We agree on most everything else, we just don't see eye to eye on this one area.)

I was really excited to be apart of the wedding, until I told my friend that I would be cutting my hair.  She doesn't want me to cut my hair and stated it was selfish of me to cut it, especially when she has asked me not to.  My hair is long, frizzy, and annoying and I was really excited to cut it into a cut stylish bob.  I've had short hair previous but due to time management and being busy with school, my internship, and work, I haven't had time to schedule a cut.  It makes me not want to be part of the wedding and I really believe that her behavior or reaction to my physical appearance is terrible.

20090226122239AAfeqUv	Family & Relationships;Weddings	Would sending out announcement cards after an elopement help us get some money or gifts or acknowledgment?	We eloped at a Sandals one month ago.  My mother, sister, and my husband's parents attended.  We had been engaged for fourteen months, but hadn't got ourselves organized enough for a traditional wedding, partly because my father's health has been touch and go, and because my sister has been having mental problems, both problems preventing my family from being able to focus on a wedding.      Anyway, I thought that after eloping, we would probably receive money, gifts, or some kind of acknowledgment (in the form of a card) from my very large family.      At every cousin's wedding, I brought a gift, and my parents, aunts and uncles gave large amounts of cash.  After my wedding, though, I only got one card, no presents, no money.        It seems a bit unfair after spending money on cousin's gifts, to not receive any after my wedding, but I realize that it is probably because of the fact that it was an elopement.      I would like to send out wedding announcement cards.  Do you think announcement cards would make it look like I am fishing for gifts?  Do you think that we would be more likely to receive gifts or cards, if we sent out announcements?

20090225111142AAIJBb5	Family & Relationships;Family	How come father and son relationship doesn't usually go well?	I don't know it's just me but i've seen a lot of it...   Guys are cool with their dad when they were still kids...   then after that it just goes downhill starting from the teen years. Like they don't talk to each other much anymore, and more prone to conflicts....      That happens a lot right?      the converse is somewhat true too. It seems like daughters are usually (or more like than guys) to have better relationship with dad. Guys stick with mom all the time.      Come think of it, I probably want a daughter if I ever become a father.      coming from a half-broken family, i'm just being quasi-sentimental....just curious.

We used to hang out every recess together, but now a girl who I've made friends with this year keeps butting in. Whenever me and my best friend start hanging out, she runs and jumps in between us, and even chases us so she can tickle us and touch our pressure point. She always snaps her fingers in my face, and sometimes pretends to steal my pens to be funny. Once I had cookies, and she took them and started eating them just to be funny. I know this may sound rude, but I sorta miss the time when it was just me and my best friend having a great time. What can I do to feel better about this, or nicely make her leave?

20090226125235AAN3QPO	Family & Relationships;Weddings	Why am I considered white trash because I want an informal wedding reception?	I'm very laid back, and when the time comes I want simple, inexpensive wedding. To me, having money to put on a house is more important than a $10,000 wedding. I'm only planning on inviting like 50 people, and I'll be having the ceremony in a church.      After wards I'd like to have a small, outdoor wedding reception - very cookout/BBQ like. I want it to be laid back and fun for everyone - kids, teenagers, adults, grandparents, etc. I want hot dogs, hamburgers, chicken, chips, cake, etc. I want music and dancing, games, etc. Pretty much everything a wedding reception is minus the formality.      Why does this make me white trash? I get called tacky every time I've asked about this type of reception, and I don't understand. People would have so much more fun at a reception like this than one with assigned seating, a four course meal with food that barely fills you up, and a stuffy atmosphere.      What do you think? Thanks!

Out of 3 adults in the home one is on disability, another's on unemployment and she's on welfare for the baby.  The step-dad is awful and my mom talks about leaving him all the time but of course has no money.  There's nothing but insecurity in the home for the child.  I'm afraid that child services is going to take my nephew.  I don't know what to do.  I don't think my sister would even listen to me.  I told her numerous times before she needs to be more mature but there's a child involved now.  I feel like I'm being nosy and intrusive if I say anything, but at the same time irresponsible if I don't.
20090226125104AAIcQ9m	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	Mommy is dating and daddy isn't - What do I say about this?	I've been divorced for almost two years and I've done almost no dating. My ex-wife has been dating since the day we separated, most likely before, but she's also flirting with me in front of our eight year old son. She's always trying to give me hugs in a flirtatious manner in front of him as if to say she wants me back. I know this is just an act but I try not to create a scene. My son does and doesn't get it that we are divorced and I know in the back of his mind he wishes we we would get back together as a family. I've told him many times that it won't happen and that I'm happy being on my own just him and me.       Now it's becoming more obvious that mommy is dating and daddy is not. I have gone out on dates but it hasn't amounted to anything serious. Over time I'm sure that will change, but my son has never known about it.  I've only done this when he's staying at his mothers during her weekend. As far as he knows I'm always at home, at work, or shopping.      I don't want to upset my son because he's a really happy kid, but at some point I'm going to be going out more and the fact that his mom is already dating is going to become obvious.       How do I handle this? I'm sick and tired of my ex-wife putting on a show in front of our son like we could get back together. I want to talk  to my son about the fact that his mom is dating but on the other hand I don't want to stir up bad feelings. I also want to find a lady to spend time with and bring her into our lives but I don't know how that's going to play out. The whole issue seems twisted and I'd rather just leave it alone rather than do anything about it. I'm not sure what to do.

She wants to move out on her own, to a small apartment, to live on her own for a short while. The problem is, her part time job pays $500 a month, and her rent would be $600 a month, so she expects me to pay the rest of her expenses. I refused, she's mad, and says I am a "controlling jerk" because I won't pay her way? Am I crazy?

20090225105959AAd6rDx	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	Help for a friend considering divorce?	I have a friend considering divorce. She is married to a married (they've been married for a year) and they have a 2 year old. She's a stay-at- home mom. Right now she says the only things stopping her from filing are whether she'd get custody and how she'd be doing financially. Her husband is telling her all these lies about how alimony works and everything, so I'm wondering if I can get any help and answers for her? **If she were to divorce, we would move in together and she would get a job as well as go to college - if money allowed.**

20090225110044AAlEC8m	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Girls Get The Rough End of The Deal?	Surely females get the rough end of the deal as it is typical for a female to be expected to be physically attracted to a male. For males, we are truly blessed because we get to be attracted to absolutely amazing/beautiful/sexually attractive females. We as males have SO many ridiculously desireable body parts to be physically attracted to.       It just doesn't seem fair to me that females typically are taught to have to find males attractive. It is truly inequality in its most direct sense.      What's more, males don't have aesthetically pleasing organs protruding from their chests, wonderful hair, nice legs and bodies, beautiful faces etc :P :)  *laughs*      Note that I am talking in terms of general heterosexual interaction between males and females here.      Surely males get the better deal for getting to like females as opposed to females typically being brought up to like males? (In a physical attractiveness sense).      Can I get a hell yeah ladies?      I'm so glad to be male! :)
20090226124439AApEhMN	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	Wives, when you ask your husband what his fantasies are, what are you really saying?	I think many of you would be offended and disgusted if you knew what his fantasies were. Are you just hoping he will say something simple like "I want to see you in a thong instead of white cotton panties"? I mean most guys are pretty much able to have their realistic fantasies fulfilled before they even met you. By the time you meet us, the only fantasies we have left are usually ones that are not very realistic. So why ask? Are you actually looking for something simple, or are you looking for a reason to get mad?

20090225111501AAt55Aw	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	Does sex leads to unwanted marriage in india?	This is a really serious question. I just wanted to know that if a boy is in his post teen years or say 20-21 years and is in relationship with a girl only because he wants sex with her and no marriage, but the girl thinks that the boy is not cheating on her and as he is ready for sex would also be ready for marrying her. The boy also for getting sex pleasure says he would be marrying her but his intentions are of not marrying. Can this sex leads a boy to marry this girl by any way in the coming future.

My boyfriend was recently caught trying to put a down payment on a jag with 12 counterfeit $100 bills. When i met him i knew his criminal history but i still fell in love with him. I am pregnant and due next month with his baby boy. I dont know what to do or how long he will be in prison for. Here is his link with all his felonies and charges. How long do you think he will be in prison for.

20090226124903AApGRxK	Family & Relationships;Family	MIL went spaz??????????	My husbands mother (never been a good mother, cheated on his dad 2 x's and then left all 4 kids (2 by cheated men) for another man) went nuts on him the other day.  Here's what happened:  He called her to see if she wanted to come to our house to watch our 8 1/2 month old daughter (her 1st and only grandchild) for 2 hours so we could go watch a movie.  She told him no and wanted to know why we weren't bringing our daughter back to her house, that's what she heard.  Well we did say this b/c at Christmas she told us she wasn't sick and I overheard her on the phone say that she was running a fever = strike 1...she smokes cigarettes in her house and our daughter is VERY sensitive to it, she has respiratory problems = strike 1 1/2, she has very wild parties, let's young people get drunk and other things at her house all the time = strike 2, and here's the doosey....her boyfriend was smoking weed while we were there with our daughter at Christmas!  I know some of you might not think this is a big deal, we do...anyway = STRIKE 3!  So my husband proceeds to tell her these reasons why and she flips out (real mature, huh) she said she was gonna come cuss us out and all kinds of things.  We live like 2 blocks from her and we have never told her that she couldn't come to our house to see our daughter, she did just a few weeks ago...but now she has no interest to see her and hasn't called or anything.  Should we take our daughter down there or do you think she will come around and realize that she is going overboard with this whiole thing?  Need some answers please, thanks!

After this happens she says "next time i wont sleep with the guy until the relationship has gone far and we both have a strong connection to each other" Or something like that she'll say.       However when she meets another guy, she doesn't keep her word and the same situation happens. My friend says she wants a guy who is romantic, kind and going to treat her with a respect and like a princess, but how is she going to find a guy like that if on the first date she screwing them?!. So anyways recently my friend with out with this guy, lets call him BOB, about last week. I just thought they went on a date and kissed (thats what she told me last week)       Now last night me and her were talking and I asked how her and BOB were doing (there not dating, they just talk to eachother once and a while, but last week was her 2nd time seeing him) anyways she said that they have an attraction to eachother but not a connection, and I told her "well maybe the connection will grow" (trying to be nice) and thats when she told me "idk, but the sex was good"       Her reason for having sex with him to me was stupid. It was because he drove her home and she wanted to reward him. Wtf reward him?! You dont gotta screw him, just give the dude a hug and say thanks for the ride. Geez. I told her that she should respect her self and all the good stuff. She says she does respect her self and does agree with me, but I think she's lying and doesnt respect herself in that way.       They did it in the car too, and when I told her why not do it in a bed or couch like other ppl, they couldnt cause both houses werent empty. I mean she told me she has some hormones problems but geez a car, how low can you get?! I asked her something like well wouldnt you want it to be special?(the sex, the person) and she was like yea but were not married so it doesnt really matter.       I was mad at her and a little dissapointed, but its her life not mine. Also she has had 2 or 3 pregnancy scares in the past year-year and half.       So my questions are: Does my friend know that she is acting easy and why do you think she acts like this? Do you think its for attention? she's pretty but a little on the chubby side and she told me when she was in middle school she was bulimic (I've seen a pic and she was thin) but since i've known her we met eachother at 14/15 yrs old she was chubby. Could that have something to do with how she acts around guys?      My friend is 18 btw and i've known her for a few years and since I known her she's been like this. I'm 19 btw if that matters.      Sorry its so long. I guess i'm just concerned.        I also posted this in the Psychology section.
20090226124632AAoc4R6	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	SINGLE MEN...what do you think?	What are you looking for in a woman. Not a girl. A real woman.       Would you date some one like this..      I'm 21 yrs old, work 2 jobs, have my own car and buying a house this summer. I love sports and art, Im a hopeless romantic so love a guy that's sweet, but yet isn't to soft. I'm far from jealous. I have a lot of guy friends and need a man to understand that, just as I would if he has female friends. One problem with me is that I'm very affectionate and my past guys said that's a problem. Also they didn't like the fact that I wanted to pay for things here and there. Is that a problem?
20090225110557AAbJXze	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	What should i do about this HORRIBLE situation.?	My sophmore year was going pretty good until one day i was at the park with my sister and a couple of friends. She didnt want me to go with her and her friends so i went walking. This guy that i thought was my friend asked if i wanted to hang with him and his cousins. With out thinking i said yea sure i thought they were cool.       They picked me up and when i got in the car they started to smoke weed. they passed it to me and without thinking i did it once. I didnt feel good and started to feel weird. I knew from then that was a bad idea.  I told them to let me out of the car. They wouldn't so i had to deal with it. They got on the highway and they drove far away from my house. i started to freak out.       We got to his cousins house and they left us there and took off. I wanted to go home but they said they would be back in a little bit.  Me and this guy walked inside and down stairs. We were on the couch watching tv. He sat far away from me and then slowly got closer and closer. He grabbed my leg and asked if i could feel it. which i couldn't so he grabbed me and tried aking off my pants i told him to stop and i fell on the floor. crawled to the steps and ran out of the house. i was sooooo scared i didnt know where i was so there was no point in walking. So i walked back into the house and told them to take me home that instant.      hours went by and i finally got home. When i got home i was grounded cause my mom was worried. I called my friend and told her what happened and that i was soo scared but luckily i got away. She was so supportive at first and i thought she was my friend. until she met the guy.       After she met him she thought he was nice. I told her not to believe him and she wouldnt listen. I told her i didnt like that she was talking to him after what he tried to do to me. She didnt listen and started dating that guy and wouldnt stop talking about him. which made me really upset and depressed kind of. Then she told me that he said that i was all over him and that i was leading him on to do it. She ditched me for him all the time.      I couldn't believe she fell for it and i broke off our friendship immediately. The next couple weeks she was telling everyone i was a fake friend and that i had sex with him and it wasnt true. and that i was a bad friend cause i didnt support her relationship with him.       DONT I HAVE THE RIGHT TO NOT LIKE HER AND PERSONALY HATE HER FOR WHAT SHE DID AND WHAT HE DID TO ME.???      oh and its kinda funny cause after that whole situation they went ot a party togethor and he got her drunk and had sex with her. so idk       WHAT SHOULD I DO.???
20090226120951AABeb4x	Family & Relationships;Family	I need some more advice?	We had to move our wedding back because my dad was just diagnosed with colon cancer. I love my dad very much and could not see him missing out on the destination wedding that we had planned on. We were scheduled to get married in May of 09, (my fiance and I didn't want to wait this long (we got engaged2-14-08) but that was what my parents really wanted so we waited) Both of my parents had originally said that we would probably just have to wait until like october. Then it changed to Nov and now its Dec. I don't know why they keep pushing things back. My dad is doing great and the doctor said he will be through with his treatments and all of his surgeries by the time Oct comes. But they refuse to help me pick a date. I am fine with whatever date is convenient but they just refuse to commit. We have now been engaged over a year and by the time the end of the year comes it will almost be 2 years. I just want a date so I can go ahead and start planing. My moms solution is just wait and we will give you about 2 months notice and then you can start planning. I cant plan a wedding in 2 months!!! Help!! Am I being selfish? How can i get my mom to understand that I don't care when I just want them to pick a date?
20090226122657AAed5Dy	Family & Relationships;Other - Family & Relationships	WHAT NOW? I LOVE MY SISTER BUT SHES DRVING ME CRAZY!?	She is 18. She never pays rent on time. (even though my parents give her the money to pass on to me) Always comes in late, is loud, drinks, has a different guy at the house all the time, refuses to respect my fiance, has dated all of my guy friends and does them wrong so they hate her, she misses class all the time, doesn't clean her room and never helps out around the house. I have set rules but she refuses to follow them. Not to mention she shares every detail of every little fuss and squabble that my fiance and I have, with the entire family (her goal is to make him look bad). I let her move in because she was going to quit college. I talked her in to moving in with me and attending a local community college and she found a full time job that she loves. I know if I make her move out she will have to quit her job and quit school. There is no where in the area that she could afford to live on her own. I want her to succeed in life without ruining mine!!! HELP! What can I do?
20090225110319AAhg5li	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	Is cyber sex cheating?? PLEASE READ!!!?	I found this website that my boyfriend had logged into and it was basically like a "find someone to have sex with website" basically filled with like raunchy photos and like a place to talk dirty...uuhh yea so anyway he posted a picture of himself (just his face- i know he's an idiot) and he exchanged messages with other women..about 3 women -complimenting how hot he thought they were, that he was into hot blondes (im brunette), that he loved one girl's body, and asked nationalities. The others i can't remember (maybe i blocked it out). When i confronted him about it he was honest and said that when i was in Miami - he was really horny, but then he said that he thought it was gross and logged off and never logged on again. And he's not lying because when i looked at the last login it said August of 2008 so in other words he went on about 2 times and never went on again..but i still feel hurt why?? I'm hurt because I'm not blonde and i don't know if this is cheating- the website was gross!! Also he really is loving and we have a great relationship - do you think this is a big deal? Please dont be rude or nasty this is important.. Thank you !

20090225110125AAq3wvK	Family & Relationships;Friends	Not sure how take this?	I received an email yesterday from a friend, who I dated in and just after high school (about 10 years ago). We've kept in touch here and there through emails over the years, and are now both married. He informed me that he has just gotten married and they are going to be having a baby. he then went on to express love for me (as a friend) and told me that he wants his child to consider me an aunt.   I haven't seen this guy in probably 6 or 7 years, and although I'd still consider us on friendly terms, this really seems very awkward to me. I would say over the past 5 or 6 years we have emailed back and forth an average of once every 4 - 6 months, so we don't even keep in great touch, or anything like that.   I haven't even written back yet because i don't even know what to think of it all. Can anyone give me some insight here?

I am not able to express my feelings and frustrations to my wife. I have tried to communicate my needs and desires in many nice ways and she does not pay much attention. I have expressed my sexual needs from her and she does not seem to care much and I am pleasing this need by masturbating and porn movies. She will not stop me having intercourse with her but will not take initiatives to please my desires. I have always taken initiatives to watch porn movies with her and bring her adult books, etc., to bring more excitement in our relationship and nothing makes difference. I care for her needs and am willing to do all in my capacity but she is not appreciating. She is very stubborn. I am now trying avoiding matters which are creating conflicts in our relationship and communication is not helping and it becomes rather complaining. I am the only one thinking of strengthening relationship with my but she does not seem to care much. I have a two year old child and cannot leave her. I got to accept this as my destiny. Well, I don’t want to ask her much because she is not a giving person. However, I have a strong sexual desire and I never want to commit adultery sin. How can I at least keep myself sexually satisfied and be happy in life.

20090225111143AAHstY2	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Is she giving me the green light?	So theres this girl at work that I like and I have a feeling she likes me but not sure if she sees me as a friend or a potential...anyways, I asked her out one weekend but she already had a date with some guy and she said I could take her out the following weekend. She was sick the following weekend and I asked her out for valentines but she already had planned to go out of town for school related agenda. That same saturday my friend told me she was at work and that he was talking to her and she said she didnt know what she wa doing that night (uh huh). She apologized both times and after that I told my buds and they said she was blowing me off and that I should not talk, txt, or call her. At work I pretty minded my own business and didnt seek her out like I did and I'm pretty sure she got the vibe because she'd ask me why I was being quiet today and she'd try to touch me.       Getting to the point last night I walked with her coming out of work and before we departed I hugged her and said goodbye and out of nowhere she said that some guy at work is starting rumors that I have a boyfriend and I just looked at her and said "you're going out with that one guy right" and shes like "nooo! I dont even talk to him anymore" and then I was like "Ohh cause I figured you when out with him on valentines from what I've heard..." and her voice changed a bit and she was like "Noo, I went out with my friends".       This girl has ask me to go to places with her and her friends before and we have mutual friends. As far as her body language she touches me quite a bit and she smiles at me when we talk and she finds me hilarious. Shes still a senior in high school and I'm in college.

Everything went wrong (except gambling: I actually won! :)) we fought the whole drive there and back, and by the time we got home we were really annoyed with each other. I've pretty much forgotten about the whole thing and am ready to go on as usual, but now she tells me she wants to slow things down and needs some space. I'm not clingy or asking her to move in with me or anything. Things were pretty good up to the trip. she gets moody from time to time, but things had generally been good and we had a great valentine's day. Despite all that, am i dumped? Is this unrepairable? What should I do? I was going to wait about a week and then send flowers and chocolates...

NO i want it as though im talking to her normally and in some way get me to say foot rub. but not in a freaky way seriously so any suggestions?

He flirts with me a lot and kind of leads me on.    But he always says he only likes me as a friend.       He’s talk to other girls but it never lasts. We always come back to each other I guess you can say. He stares at me or looks at me almost every time I’m near him at school.      We haven’t talked in over a week. I’m waiting to see if he will actually talk to me first.       But I just want to know if he actually cares if I’m in his life or not.    If I continue to just wait for him to talk to me will he actually talk to me or will he just move on completely?      I’ve told him before that he doesn’t want me in his life then just to tell me but he freaked out and asked if I really meant it and said that’s ridiculous to say.      Its like, though, he thinks I'm mad at him when I don't talk to him for a while, that's not true at all.      Oh and he's 17 and I'm 16.

20090226122718AA3CxtY	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	How do I deal with the after-math of a messy break up?	My ex-boyfriend dumped me the same day his ex broke up with her boyfriend... The same ex he assured me over and over again that he had no feelings for. He claims the timing was a "coincidence", but I'm no idiot. I'm pissed off and hurt. A lot of other things have come to the surface after the break up and I have realized that he is a huge scum bag and I'm embarrassed I let myself be with him.      But here's the thing... we're co-workers. Oh, and so is the ex that he left me for. Probably the worst case scenario. I haven't spoken to him since he broke  up with me, over the phone. I haven't seen him for almost a week, which is really strange since I usually see him in the halls around school at some point throughout the day. But we just haven't crossed paths... yet. I don't know what to do. I can't act too pissed off since I have to work with him, but I also have nothing good to say to him either. So what do I do when I finally see him? How do I deal with the work situation?      Thanks
20090226123029AAS1iuv	Family & Relationships;Friends	My ex-boyfriend's friend is talking to me...?	My boyfriend and I broke up last night, and today I got a post on my wall from one of his friends asking me what's new. He's a really nice guy, but I think he probably doesn't know about the break up yet. He's not that close to my ex and he is kinda oblivious... It's just an awkward situation... Nothing new or exciting is going on with me and all I can think about is the break up. So any ideas of what I could say to him? I know my ex will read it so I want to sound happy, but not like I'm faking it, if that makes sense..      I feel like saying "nothing much" is a total lie since SO much is going on with the break up and everything, plus I hate when people say that haha.

This is definetly something that most women don't have problems with and it includes my husband and 3 kids, but I'm not saying what it is though and yes i have talked to my husband about it, but his opinon hasn't helped at all and i don't want to turn to anyone else about my business because that would cause problems too.

We are moving together in the summer & want to get engaged by fall.  I have met his family, they know our plans & our seriousness to one another, YET this is the THIRD wedding in his family I am not invited to attend.  There is a 250+ guest list for this expensive NY wedding, his cousin was invited to bring his girlfriend, & my boyfriend is part of the wedding party. (His "date" will be the "corresponding bridesmaid".) We are 23 year old college grads, not young kids.  My boyfriend is always invited to weddings, birthdays, & other celebrations with my family/friends, and I've pointed this out to him. I'm not dying to go, but it would have been nice to be included and thought of.  Do I have reason to not understand this situation and to feel rejected and upset with his family?

20090225110336AAvxq2i	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	How can I get over my boyfriend cheating/having a drug problem?	My ex boyfriend and I have known each other since we were 13 (11 years) and have always had a thing for each other (we went to prom one year, we dated 1,000,000 times, etc.).  He always drank too much and partied too hard so it never worked out, but he has always told people that I was his "dream girl" and when he got his life together, he would marry me.  Well, he ended up going to rehab in FL 2 1/2 years ago for pills, and started doing extremely well - he had 2 years of sobriety and had an awesome job, was himself again, happy, sober.  So 6 months ago I moved down there to live with him after a lot of consideration.  We had an amazing relationship, I thought everything was perfect, we got a dog and a house and I got a job, didn't even make any friends just made him dinner, pampered him.  Then he tells me the other day that he's been drinking again and cheating on me.  He doesn't know why he did it (bullshit?) and said he felt like he "ruined his entire life and lost his future".  So I left and drove back to NJ alone and have been "mourning" for the past 5 days.  I have no idea how to move on - I thought we were going to be together forever, he was such a huge part of my life, we had a dog and a house together, we talked about having kids, the whole thing.  I have to just get over him and move on, right?  Is there any way to make this easier??  My life has been turned upside down ahh!

20090226124210AAWQrdU	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	What do I do? Im in huge trouble!!!?	Okay so longstory short, recently Ive been getting into a lot of trouble. It just seems like one thing after another and I have no escape. I feel trapped. So heres what Ive already done and been caught for doing:   1) myself and three friends took one their dads car out and drove around. We videotaped it and months later the video found its way to all of our parents. (All of us were 14)   2) I skipped school about 15-20 times. Sometimes I would just skip a class or two and then other times I would just not go to school at all.   3)Going over to a friends house when I said I would be staying at my moms house.   4) Sometimes I get an attitude with my parents w/o even releasing it until they say something to me.   These are the bad things that im still hiding:   1) I smoked weed 1 time the day after xmas with my friends. The only time I have ever done drugs.   2) Me and 1 of my friends got some bad grades on our last report cardrs. My friend made 5 f's and 1 d. I made 1 A, 1 B, 2 C's, and 2 D's.   We fixed our report card using photoshop and gave them to our dads. This time we left no evidence. But after school is over the school sends the report cards home in the mail randomly. I just know Im going to get caught.    So please I need somebody's advice.   Yes I know these were poor choices and whatever but I feel trapped by all of my lies and my parents are not the one that will understand this. They are both very strict. They already want me to go to counciling. No stupid responses please. Oh and by the way my dad is a cop.:(

20090226130447AAmTIJ0	Family & Relationships;Friends	HELP! Girl won't leave me alone???	Ok, well I am in 8th grade; middle school. So, there is a girl (let's call her Paula, but its not her real name!) Anyways,  "paula" doesn't really have any friends, so I feel bad for her and I am nice to her. I started talking to her in  Gym last year, and this year she talks to me more. I'm fine with that, but now she won't leave me alone at all. Like I can't hang out with other friends without her following me. And she doesn't really talk to anyone else, and it's starting to get on my nerves. I understand she has no other friends, but I have other friends (who are nice to her too, but I am the only one she wont leave alone) and I want my space. I tried to introduce her to other people so she can have other friends, but they all don't want to be her friend. So how can I get her to stop being so clingly? I'm not saying I never want to talk to her again,  but I want to be able to hang out with other people without her always being by my side. Ok thanks!!

20090226130144AAn1abI	Family & Relationships;Family	How does it feel like to lose a loved one?	I'm writing a novel, and one of my characters lost both her parents & brother.       I've never lost a closed one, so I can not relate to her. I am having difficulty expressing her emotions when it comes to dealing with such a lost. I'd prefer first-hand experience on how it feels, so I can try to understand the feeling, and hopefully also my character's pain at the deaths of her family members.      Thanks in advance. I know it's hard for some to talk about this kind of stuff, but I'd really appreciate it. If you don't wanna go public, but still wanna help me, you can send me a PM (you can still post something here, like notifying me of a PM, for your 2 points. If your answer rocks, then I can still pick you for best answer, even if it's a PM).      Thanks in advance.

So there's this guy that I've been hooking up with on and off for about two years... we tried actually dating but it didn't really work. We always use each other as a rebound for when we've just gotten out of a different relationship. I feel like kind of a **** doing this. But we're not sleeping together. We've talked about it but I told him I don't want to unless we're in a serious relationship. And it just feels dirty to me when we run and hook up in the 6 minutes between classes and such. I'm just wondering if I'm a total **** for doing this.

20090226130421AAsJIzA	Family & Relationships;Family	My brother... Why does he do this?	I'm starting to really wonder about mu brother. He's 14 yet acts ridiculiusly immature for his age, I've seriously seen 7 year olds act better. He can become really violent sometimes and he had random outburts shouting stupid words. He also has the tendency to make so much stuff up, mainly about me, just to try and get me in trouble/annoy me. He has an obsession over stupid words like 'poo' and 'googley', and I feel these stages are egtting worse and worse. It's gotten to the point where I don't actually want to talk to him anymore because he just can't hold a normal conversation. I also think it really sparks when he plays video games (which he plays way too much of) and/or when he has stuff like fizzy drinks/sweets.       Does this sound like anything in particular, or is he just really immature for his age? This attitude has been going on for a good 2 years now, so I really think he's passed anything like immaturity. Thankyou for any help.

First of all, I will start with my background.  I am a 32 year old single mom who has been in an amazing relationship with a guy now for over 18 months.  My boyfriend and I have been talking about getting engaged and planning a wedding.  He thinks that I need a big expensive engagment ring.  How can I tell him that I do not need something fancy without destroying his dream?        The second part of my question is as follows:      My sister, was engaged last February.  This will be her second marriage.  Her first marriage ended in divorce because she was simply too young to be married the first time.  She keeps rubbing it in that she is going to be married twice before I am married once.  Then she turns around and says that she does not want me as maid of honor because she "dosen't want her second wedding to be like her first",   Why should anyone justify her actions, including me?  I feel like saying that I do not want to be a part of her day because she makes me feel like a complete idiot.      I need all of the advice I can get on these two subjects.

Recently I was snooping through my loved ones recycling bin on his computer and came across downloaded pornographic pictures of children mixed in with regular adult porn. I'm not really sure how to handle this because the pictures were deleted almost 4 years ago and there has been no recent activity of any other downloads of that sort (or any other since we started dating 2 years ago)...and honestly I am so shocked that I found it...I would have never expected anything of the sort from this person so I'm not really sure how to bring it up or how to handle it...maybe it was downloaded by accident? I'm not a porn down-loader so I'm not sure what the chances are of mistakenly downloading the wrong kind... the other possibility is maybe it wasn't even him that did it? I'm not really sure how to bring it up because I was snooping when I came across it and I find that it's a pretty big thing to accuse someone of...and of course...don't you think he'll deny it, even if he did do it? How will I ever know the truth...

20090226130515AAtpmzv	Family & Relationships;Other - Family & Relationships	Girlfriend Troubles What am i suppose to do?	Well i have met my perfect girl and well we talked alot and spent alot of time together. Well after a long conversation about past relationships i found out that she had over 20 relations ships in the last 2 years and 10 of those she went all the way with. That sorta makes me uneasy, i have only been in 3 in the last two years. Another thing is that she occasionally does drugs not like hardcore but weed and that stuff. Her friends are about 80% guys and 20% female.   What should i Do? I enjoy being with her and now that i heard all that i have a weird feeling of doubt and others. Any help?
20090226130530AAuIpVu	Family & Relationships;Weddings	Gloves with wedding dress?	im getting married in May, and in the spirit of family tradition, im wearing my big sister's wedding dress. it's a beautiful strapless, with sequins peeking out at the top of the bust and at the bottom . problem is, i don't want to look just like my sister did in it. i've already added a small tiara instead of a veil like she had, but i'm considering adding gloves. i just don't think him putting the ring on my finger will be quite so special with gloves in the way. anybody got some input?
