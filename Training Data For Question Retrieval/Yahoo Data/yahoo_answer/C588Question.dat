20090128131636AAfG1eP	Health;Diet & Fitness	Bulimia - WANT OUT OF IT?	A friend of mine has bulimia but she wants out of it. It started out as eating very little (to lose weight) and then turned into throwing up if she ate more than she wanted, and then throwing up no matter what she ate. It didn't seem like a BIG problem because it was something she could stop anytime she chose to.      Now, however, her mind set has changed. She used to think "eat healthy - exercise - be healthy." Now she thinks "I want to eat only healthy foods, but I know that I can eat something unhealthy anytime I want because I can just throw it up!"      Now her throat hurts from throwing up sometimes twice a day, sometimes not for a whole day at all. She gets bad headaches, seems more like migraines, and she feels bad about herself.      I need something to say to her to help her get out of this and help her feel better about her self esteem, too.

20090128134455AAEQraS	Health;Diseases & Conditions;Respiratory Diseases	Am i really out of shape?	i am 14 years old. i have been playing sports my whole life. i play soccer, basketball, soccer, softball, volleyball, i run cross country and track, and i swim. last year when i was in 8th grade in the middle of basketball season i realized that my mouth was a tad dry and i couldn't run like normal. and it kept getting worse. and i told my mom to take me to the doctor to check for asthma. and they told me i had exercise induced asthma. i tried 3 inhalers. they would work for about 2 weeks and then stop working. now i went to a pulmonologist (sp?) and they did two breathing tests. one to check for normal asthma, and the other for exercise induced asthma. the both tests came back negative for asthma. and the one for exercise induced asthma had me run on a treadmill for 6 minutes and my heart rate went up too high, and now they are telling me i am out of shape. i will not take that as an answer, i am not out of shape. it just started last year (in the middle on bball season). and i have done sports my whole life with no trouble. i run to stay in shape over the summer, and i sprint on my own. i do suicides. i am not out of shape. can anyone tell me what could possibly be wrong? please? i really like playing sports, they are my life and passion. and i want to play them fr the rest of my life, hopefully competitively. please help? :(      umm im 5'6" and i weigh 145 ish if that helps any?         to me it makes no sesne... how am i out of shape for a whole year when i play a sport eveyyyy season? what could it be?
20090128134900AAOBhaI	Health;Women's Health	6 days after c-section with burning at incision site. What is causing this?	I had a routine c-section last Thursday and am moving around and feeling pretty good. I have no pain except for in the far left end of my incision. It doesn't hurt when I am sitting or laying down. It only hurts when I stand up or am walking. And then its not really pain that I'm feeling, but more of a burning sensation. The area isn't red and it hasn't been producing any fluid (such as puss or anything). I have noticed that the area looks a little more gaped than the rest of my incision, but other than that it looks fine. Has anyone else experienced this sort of burning sensation with a c-section incision before? If so, what was the cause? I'm kind of paranoid because a girl died at the same hospital that I had my baby at from a staph infection from her c-section just days before I had mine. Again, I have no strange symptoms, the incision looks fine and I'm not running a fever. Is this burning normal? Any input would be appreciated. Thanks!

I've tried everything, and it works but not completely. Now I'm using this lotion MG217 and it's doing fine on me, just "Fine" but it doesn't clear my skin all the way. I'm in high school now and I'm starting to go through the teenage years, and I don't like people looking at me all weird, and asking me about what's on my skin. Because i seriusly don't like to answer that question, but they have the right to ask. So know that I've heard a lot of good things about Enbrel I've talked to my mom and I'm planning on using it. But I really want this out of my skin, I CAN'T STAND BEING LIKE THIS FOR THE REST OF MY LIFE. I've had it since I was 10 and im 14 now. I wanna wear undershirts outside, I wanna be able to put my shirt sleeve all the way up, although I do wear normal T-shirts to school and in public. But still. please tell me if is a good idea to buy it. HELP ME!

He got out of his living situation and detoxed- alone, without help from any professional counselors or support groups.  Since then he was not drinking but could not seem to hold down a job, etc and was fearful that the stress from work would push him to drink.  Now it appears that he is drinking again and has no job, etc and does not seem to be able to function in the real world out of fear.        Should he get professional help?  What type?  My family has tried everything to get him into a productive job and into living his life.  It seems he has too much time and sits and dwells on his fear and problems.  He has struggled with depression, ADD and also a serious illness in the past, which I think has contributed to his drinking.      I cannot really relate to what he is experiencing, any advice would be appreciated.

Only a little while later i realized that i may die from the naegleria fowleri infection, from breathing in contaminated soil/dust, i ran to my room and blew my nose hard hard hard and did that for the remainder of the night and all today, i had this fear before so for 2 weeks i blow my nose hard-even when there is nothing in it, to clear out stuff, but it hurts and sometimes bleeds, and i am scared i may die from this infection. i inhaled dirt that may have been contaminated as it said in the article. i didn't even clean the particles in my kitchen, my mom cooked and stuff not knowing, today i breathed in my kitchen through my nose again and i am so scared i may die??         Do you think i will, i inhaled contaminated soil...?   Am i being paranoid?   I told mymmom and she is sick of my health freak outs, but what if this one is real?   has this infection infestedmy house what should i do?      help please, tell me everything you know!

20090128140514AAPAK2m	Health;Diet & Fitness	Is this way of losing weight bad?	Ok, so I'm 16 years old, and I'm about 5'6". On january 1st I weighed 170 pounds, which is a BMI of over 28. And VERY unhealthy.       I've been eating a bowl of ceral everyday for breakfast, for lunch I eat a piece of fruit like an apple or an orange, and then for dinner I eat whatever my mom puts on my plate, but then I go upstairs and throw it up. I've been doing this all month, and I havent felt sick at all. Now I weigh 156 pounds. I've lost 14 pounds in less than a month, and I don't feel bad at all. So why does everyone say that eating like this is unhealthy? I'm in all honors classes in school, and my grades are all in the A range, except for a few B-'s. None of my test grades changed, so its not affecting my school work, and I still have plenty of energy.       How could this be bad?

Surely they should be regular by now?    I know they can take time to settle and I thought after 3 years I'd be regular. Well, I was wrong.    I'm a little over weight. Admittedly, I could lose around 10lbs but I find it hard to lose weight due to lack of motivation and any weight lost isn't as apparent as I would've hoped.    My mother has talked about putting me on the pill to regulate my cycles. At 15, I don't want to be on the pill for various reasons. The main one is possible weight gain and I cannot gain any weight.    Is there anyway I can increase the regularity of my cycles? I got my period today - 26 days later than it should have come.    Another thing is that they often last for up to 9 days and I'm on very heavy. Could this be helped by going on the pill?    I'm beginning to become worried about this affecting my fertility as an adult.

20090128145347AARQqkg	Health;Dental	Toothache in tooth that has already had a root canal?	3 months ago I had a tooth fixed and capped/crowned. I had to have a root canal because I had a large abcess that was even infecting my bone. The dentist corrected the problem which took 4 visits over a 2 month period.   After the problem was corrected the sensitivity (to hot and cold) and the chewing pain went away and so did my headaches.  Now it's been about 4 months and the pain has returned to my tooth, jaw, and head. It is almost identical. It hurts most if I drink something hot but I can feel something there when I drink something cold also. It hurts when I go outside in cold weather and it hurts to even touch it a tiny bit.. even if my tongue brushes against it, it is very very painful! I can't even chew properly on the right side (pain is on the left) because of the chance of it hitting the teeth below it.   It was my understanding that after getting the root canal and crown that I'd never feel pain in that tooth again because of the absence of the root. But it is definitely the same tooth.. Matter of fact, it feels like the tooth wants to fall out!    I take pretty good care of my teeth. This specific tooth issue happened while I was pregnant and I guess I somehow cracked it and didn't know. I've only had one other problem like this before but it was because when I was a kid I fell on my face and broke a tooth and how to have a root canal and a crown but that tooth never started hurting again and the crown is not even noticeable.     So is it possible that the dentist didn't get all of the root? Will it always hurt during inclement weather? What could possibly be the problem? I did just get over a sinus issue/cold.. is there a chance that it could have aggravated it? I am no longer having sinus issues.. just the occasional runny nose but no congestion.    I am so worried that the dentist is going to have to pull it. He told me this crown was permanent and not something that could be fixed :(     I plan to make an appointment but I am so sick of dentists!

I can't even picture myself graduating high school, and I'm not sure I want to live past 25, at worst.     Is that normal?

I hear that it does, but that when you stop taking it, it screws up your natural hormones, and you might grow more hair and look manlier (if that's even a word). So it sounds kinda unhealthy, but i was just wondering. I am a 34 C, but i would like to be a D because people with bigger boobs always make fun of me. I dont think i'm that small but i just wanted to go up one more size. I know i shouldn't care, but im just so tired of them making fun of me.

If biomass and energy are lost at each stage of the food chain, we can improve the efficiency of food production by reducting the number of levels in food chains so theoretically, we would get more energy from eating potatoes than eating a cow which loses 90% of the biomass from a plant    Does this mean we would put on more weight if we ate the same mass of potatoes as we would do a cow

There are too many mixed answers for this question so I wanted the definite answer and please answer only if you remember clearly your experience. I am wondering how much pain there really is involved with getting your wisdom teeth pulled out while you are awake. I have heard that there is no pain during the extraction at all just a little pressure and the pain doesn't kick in until recovering at home. I am fine with pain AFTER the surgery I am just scared of pain during the procedure. I remember pulling extra teeth out for braces and it was painless because of the numbing but I heard that wisdom teeth are more complicated which causes more pain to pull them out.

I've never gotten a straight answer for this on here (I realize turning to the public isn't an answer but at least I could hear about an experience), nor from a doctor.      I have conversations with people that aren't even in the room. I pretend I'll be talking to someone, normal conversation, sometimes a confrontation with arguing/yelling, violence. I don't actually hear anything said back to me but I hear it in my mind. I was wondering if this is a symptom of Bipolar or just something else. I have more lows than I do highs but I'll switch between the two, although my highs are not that drastic. I was given Risperidone and it was working - I was talking to myself half as much on 2mg. But I was never told what I had. Can someone give me some answers?      I can't go to the doctor because I'm very low on money and it's a $25 copay, so complete strangers on a mental health board is my best option right now.

I try to tuck them into my outer lips, but they don't say. I don't feel like a girl, and I hate it.   I'm really sick of people say learn to accept your body; if i dont like something, then i dont like something. I've never had sex or anything, but when I was a baby, I played with it a lot. I don't know what to do. because I'm only 13. My friend and I were just randomly talking about it yesterday and he goes, yeah saggy vaginas are really gross.   i really do hate it. there has to be something I can do.    dont tell me to accept it, because i wont, and it will just make me angry, and please, no rude comments, i know, its gross.   thank you.

I have these little black bumps I get on my penis, and they're like under the skin, but are slightly protruding through little holes in the skin. They're very tiny, and I have been able to take them out but they leave a little crater type thing. I'm wondering if this is build up dirt?

20090128144418AAFWj6c	Health;Other - Health	:S??!!?!!:S??!!??!!:!??!!???!! :@?	OK, so first off, my problem is that I'm losing weight, even though I eat every possible minute of every day (not joking either). I am a 17 year old female, 5'3", and am now 100 pounds. The only time I don't eat all of the time is when I'm in school, & there I eat dinner & sometimes recess. I am not all that active, and I am afraid to be active because no matter what I do to try and gain weight, I keep losing it. It's not that I want to gain a lot of weight; I just want to be at a reasonable level for my height.  My doctor insists that I am anorexic. She will not believe me that I eat all of the time. I can assure you that I am NOT anorexic or bulimic; I am just trying to be at more of a healthy weight level.    Help please???
20090128144546AAzwdKl	Health;Mental Health	Why am I so sad for no apparent reason at all?	Alright, so just to make sure you all know, I am not usually like this. I don't seek attention and I certainly don't like telling people about these kinds of things, which is probably why I'm asking here before I jump to any conclusions.   It started around October. I just constantly felt sad, and since then the feeling hasn't gone away. I used to think that it had to do with this guy, who ditched me for another [younger, hotter] girl, but I don't know... I don't care about that situation enough for it to trigger something like this, and I'm not the type to give a **** about something so stupid.   Here's another thing. It's actually been so persistent and strong that  I've resulted in doing a shitload of drugs and drinking a lot, because nothing else helps. I don't want to go see a psychiatrist because if I were to tell anyone in my family, they would tell everyone else, and I hate the attention they give me in situations like these. I don't want my entire family to know about how I'm feeling, you know?   Anyway, so if any of you can help me, please do so. Like, I really don't know how, but any suggestions besides, "Go see a psychiatrist" or "Tell a family member" would be appreciated.    Thanks.

20090225133346AAyru2i	Health;General Health Care;Other - General Health Care	Violation of patient privacy?	So I had a doctor’s appointment to get tested for allergies.  I had to remove my upper clothing and wear a gown that opens in the back in order for them to do the test.  I had to wait 20 minutes until they could check to see if I had any reactions.  The thing is, when the doctor left, they left with the door open.  I was told not to move so I felt I couldn’t get up to close the door or else I would ruin the expensive test.  The gown fell down to the sides, exposing my sides and back (I’m a girl and things pop out if you know what I mean).  Other patients and office staff kept walking by and looking in, completely embarrassing me.  I was so embarrassed that as soon as the test was over (negative results) I left asap.  I called to inform my insurance company they shouldn’t be recommending this doctor (the insurance did recommend the doctor to me) and explained what happened.  But…isn’t this a violation of my privacy?  Should I do anything else?

So yesterday after getting my results I asked him if i could use his meter and test strips for the next week to monitor my own sugar levels before my appointment date.  Without changing my diet or eating habits my sugar level today tested 59.        How did it lower so much when i didn't change anything?    And would it be ok for me to continue to monitor my own sugar levels before the test?       I'm still going to do what they suggest with the carb loading so their test comes back properly, but would possibly like to fallow my sugar tell then, and even for awhile after.

It's so nasty. It is like this huge scab and has this thing that looks like it could be filled with puss.  I have a couple of questions about it though.    1.how much lnger do I have to deal with this piece of ****   2. If I have licked my lips( cause they've been way chapped lately) and now I have this wierd tiny red bump on the bottom of my tongue that hurts whenever my teeth touch it, could it be another cold sore?   3. I have also had the stomach flu for the past 4 days and I threw up quite a bit, does it matter if the throw up touched it or will it get infected.    Sorry for the long question.  I appreciate any answers

My 18 year old girlfriend, who as far as I am aware was fine when I met her, has turned Anorexic - seeming out of the blue.      Is this possible ? Can someone just turn Anorexic for no apparent reason or does there, as i originally thought, have to be a reason or at least a trigger for such drastic change in her eating habits ?      She has always been slim but has now decided that slim is not acceptable and instead is going for the, in my opinion unattractive, emaciated look.      I always thought Anorexia was the outcome of a bad experience, for example a life changing event such as the death of a loved one, or the result of a bad childhood or previous abuse but she can not relate to any of those possible theories.      I am really worried about her because it has become clear that these drastic unhealthy changes to her diet are not as I first thought a phase. It is obviously something much more serious.       I want to help her overcome this - but I can't. I don't know how. She seems to be pushing me away and I am at a loss of what to do.

20090225084002AAZiT74	Health;Mental Health	Worrying about stupid stuff?	hey everyone i suffer from OCD/anxiety and i have been worried sick for the past 11 months because while moving i threw out my old 40gb laptop hard drive without thinking..and have read alot about idenity theft and it just scared me sending me into a complete obsession over my personal information being found and someone finding out everything about me, even though eveything was deleted from the drive, i know things can still be recovered ..after 11 months odds are it has been destroyed right? i would have known by now if anyone had found it. Basically i am just wondering if it could even survive being put through the trash process..it was just a small laptop hard drive outside of its case..usually if you just drop them they are toast. i also heard the trash from my town goes to the local power plant to be incincerated so the only chance it could have been found is point a to point b. What do you guys think?      I cant seem to get these thoughts out of my head and this has completely taken over my life..any help would be great i am really suffering here, i just really dont know what else to do..i am on paxil and have considered therapy but i dont know if that will even help me..       I have always had obsessions throughout my life. But not one that has gripped one so violently like this. I am sure people are sick of seeing me ask this, but it is theraputic for me to get reassurance, although i know it is not a solution. I guess i just feel silly seekign therapy for something so ridiculous. It is embarrassing.      I want to try and get over this without going to therapy, i am just not sure how.      Should i seek therapy? I have already checked my credit report and what not, but i always seem to just tell myself it just hasnt happened YET

I got one recently to help tone up my upper back, and I've heard it's a great way to tone up the stomach too!... except I don't feel anything there when I use it. I'm using it for a good half hour, feeling the pull on my back and arms, but not my stomach.      Could I be doing it wrong?      It never came with instructions on HOW to row correctly, presuming there is a correct way. Or maybe it's not that great for the stomach after all...?      Just curious.

20090225132251AAVS3ZD	Health;Mental Health	I think I may have a disorder and I need your opinion please!?	Everybody likes a little attention. I personally love attention, but not in the way of being popular or anything...in fact, it's really quite different. You see, I often think or daydream, usually in school (lol) about like if in gym I was running and I tripped and broke my arm or got some serious injury. I've always just wanted this to happen to me sometime so I would get sympathy from others and get attention. I even have this habit of bitting my knuckle, which I usually do this by accident cause it is a habit but sometimes I will bite really really hard and make bite marks on it or put nail marks in my arm or something and try to get people to notice and they'll be like what did you do!? I am constantly doing this and recently I came upon this syndrome called Munchausen Syndrome which really describes this. Is it possible I may have this syndrome? Cause I really think I do, but even if I am "sick", I dont want to try and stop this cause I still want the attention. What should I do!?!

20090225131341AA9M2Xt	Health;Diet & Fitness	Help with running problem!!!!!?	here's the story, I was in wrestling for a long time until I had to quit about 2-3 months ago due to my job. In wrestling, we did a lot of running and leg exercises and I could run our weekly 3 mile without getting sore. I have not ran since then, but I have pushed carts 5 days a week at my fancy walmart job. haha. Now the new school trimester in highschool has started and I am in weight training. Today our assignment was running 1 mile in 11 minutes, and I thought, wow that's too easy. So I walked a lap around the track and then ran/jogged the last 3 laps and finished in 11 minutes and 45 seconds, and sadly, I was 3rd lol. Now, it's only been a few hours since then and my legs are stiff, and my knees almost kill me to try and squat down.      So, is it normal to get out of shape that quickly? And how long will it take to get back to running like I use to if I ran every other day or so?      Sorry for the life story, it's a habit I have.

20090128102728AAlVBO2	Health;Other - Health	Talking to mom about epilepsy?	When I was little, I used to have repeated episodes of extreme déjà vu, nearly everyday, sometime more than once an day. That stopped when I was about 14, and I know have just occasional déjà vu, like the normal person. However, I have been experience this pulsing like sensation in my ear, and then they will start ringing, and then everything will sound muffled for maybe 2 minutes, and then it goes back to normal. It happens once a day or so, usually 4-6 times a week, for the last six months. It happened before, ever since I was about 14. but not as frequently, and I thought it was just funny little things that happen to everyone. But the increase in frequency was concerning to me, so I had my mom take me to the hearing doctor, as I thought maybe I was loosing my hearing, but I am not. A friend of mine told me this sounds kind of like her brothers epileptic seizures, but I told her I didn't convulse and loose conciseness. She told me not everyone has those types of seizures called 'tonic-clonic' seizures. Her brother has 'simple partial seizures' and she thought maybe I had that too. So I've been doing that too, and it does kind of sound like that, especially since I've been uber stressed since the increase in episodes. Psychic seizures when I was a child, and sensory ones now. I'm not sure how to bring this up with my mom, or my doctor though, with out sounding crazy. Any advice?

20090225082531AAdJKxM	Health;Diseases & Conditions;Diabetes	Worried I have Diabetes Type 1   =S?	For the past few months, I've had a few changes:   -  I've been drinking water non-stop, around (4L a day, i measured it) and my mouth is always dry, thus i never stop, it's like I'm addicted.   -  Because of all the water I go to the bathroom all the time, around 3-5 times an hour.   -  I'm exhausted and I don't think it's just because of school work.  Last year I stayed up later doing schoolwork, and was not half as tired as this year...Last night I slept for 13 hrs and was still exhausted.   -  I have crazy mood swings, which is very unlike me.  One minute I'm so nice, the next insanely rude and for no reason, I don't even know why myself.   - I've had an increase in appetite, however as I eat more, I am not gaining weight, but losing it slowly.   - As I said before,I'm tired and have absolutely no energy, and I don't think it's laziness because I'm normally not like this.      Anyways what do you think?  I saw these were all symptoms of Diabetes Type 1, and I finally got a blood test Tuesday, and will hear back this Friday about what could be the problem. I'm 17 yrs old and really scared about what could be wrong....any suggestion?  Am I being paranoid and over-dramatic?      Thanks in advance =)

20090128105724AA3YFx5	Health;Diet & Fitness	Will I see results quickly if I stick to this routine?	I am going to hawaii in a little over a month and a half. I really want to lose weight because at this point, there is no way I am going to go out in public in a swim suit. I'm 5'1 and about 153 pounds (biggest number I've ever been... it sucks) So, my plan is to go on a diet and eat about 1,800-900 calories a day and then to do the Jillian Michaels 30 day shred DVD ( http://www.collagevideo.com/item.aspx?it...  every morning and every night. It's only about 27 minutes long so that's why I though doing it twice a day would be a bit better. Since my trip to Hawaii is coming up pretty soon, I want to know if I should stick to this or if I should do something completely different because I need pretty speedy results. Any suggestions?

20090128110750AA0xe72	Health;Diet & Fitness	What are some good fat burning pills for weight loss?	About 3 years ago I lost about 40 lbs. At that time I was 16, 220 lbs and 5 feet 10 inches. I learned how to exercise and eat healthy and I've been able to keep that weight off for 3 years now. I am almost 19 and I weigh 180lbs. I've been trying to loose another 10-15 lbs for 3 years now and I have had absolutely no success. The lowest weight I've ever been able to get down to is 177lbs. I am so discouraged because I am so close to my goal weight of 165 lbs, but I can't get there. I've tried changing my exercise routine, and I've become extremely picky about what I eat now. I mostly eat fresh food instead of processed food. I was just wondering if there were any safe and effective fat burners on the market that could help me lose these last few pounds.

20090128111337AAAdnYS	Health;Diet & Fitness	URGENT HELP - how to loose weight!?!?	Hi, I'm 12 years old, about 165cm, and weight about 11 stone. What category will you put me in, fat, obese, high normal??      I don't know why I'm this heavy, because I do like my sports. I do, sadly no exercise on Mondays, Wednesdays, or Thursdays. I rarely do it on Saturdays. However, on Tuesdays I do exercise for about 2 and 30 minutes. On Fridays, I also do exercise, but only about 30 minutes. On Sundays, I do exercise for about 2 hours.      When I mean exercise, I usually do badminton and (winchester) fives. True, these aren't very "good" sports to be losing weight, but they are probably better than nothing.      I usually eat my fruit, but not really 5 a day, maybe about 2 a day.      Is there anyone who knows how I can lose weight? I was watching Gok Wan: Too Fat Too Young last night, and he did say he went on a crazy diet, losing 9 stone in 8 months! True, I don't really need to lose 9 stone, but I feel I need to lose at least 4 stone.      Please Help!

PLEASE HELP!?	-i know i posted this a while ago but my computer wouldnt let me read the replies-      I was in a 4 year relationship with my ex boyfriend until he got arrested 5 years ago. Im 25 & he is 27. He was my first love & when he got locked up i couldn't stop crying. He in a dangerous gang, We have some mutual friends(not the gang ones) and whenever some of my friends go for a night out and he's there with friends i try keep my distance from him but i keep getting the feelings i had for him come back to me. When i leave he follows me out to talk. although i still love him i think i did the right thing. Anyway whenever im dancing he never takes his eyes off me,He gets into my face a lot if i dance with other guys, he grabs my arm if i walk away, he has never once hit me though. My friends are under the impression he knows he screwed up badly and he doesn't want anyone else to have me, that he is obsessed with me and that can be a major problem when i am dancing or with other guys would that be true?. He keeps telling me he wants me back and will never let me go again. If im at a bar or something he will sometimes come over a put his arms around me & try kiss me or whisper in my ear, but i walk away then he will try to make me look him in the eyes and tell him i dont love him, which i cant do.He even now has my name tattooed on the side of his neck. I think im attracted to these kind of men because my father is in jail & he is one of the head men in a Latino Blood Gang. Im starting counseling soon so maybe that will help?!   Please give me some advice if you can, thank you so much      -i know a lot of you are going to attack me but all im looking for is some advice-

20090128151943AAGf0vb	Health;Other - Health	Why am I immune to benzodiazipines?	I want to start by saying that I seriously doubt this had anything to do with tolerance.  I was first prescribes oxazepam/serepax - 30mg, for sleep.  That did nothing, so it was raised to 60, then 90, which finally worked.  A few years later, I was treated with valium/diazepam (3x5mg) and mogadon (3x5mg) which worked, but none less than 3 tablets of each.  I was also trialled on rohypnol - 1 1mg tablet just made me a bit tired for an hour.  It takes 3 pills just to make me feel any effect at all, and it's a crap shoot as to whether it will help you sleep, or make you feel sick - valium seems to be better for sleep.      Everywhere I go, doctors freak out about high dosages, but I don't get it, the medication leaflets imply that I'm only on HALF the reccommended dose for some people!  Someone else I know was flat on his back after taking valium, but right from the start, serepax would only help me sleep if I wanted to, and I seem to be absolutely immune to rohypnol, despite it meaning to be a date rape drug!  Do people get raped with 10 pills or something?  It just seems weird... I am 220lbs btw, if that has anything to do with it...

HI everyone, I am a 13-year old girl and I am paranoid about a lot of things. Yesterday I was eating some food and reached for something in the cabinet, which is located up above the microwave, on my microwave my mother has put a small potted plant on it, so something from the cabinet fell over knocking the plant, so so it fell but sorta tipped over, i stopped it in time, but i noticed the soil/dirt floating around, i naturally, had to breathe, and like most people i breath through my nose, so the dirt went up my nose, i touched the plant and some dirt, wiped it off on my jeans and walked away. Only a little while later i realized that i may die from the naegleria fowleri infection, from breathing in contaminated soil/dust, i ran to my room and blew my nose hard hard hard and did that for the remainder of the night and all today, i had this fear before so for 2 weeks i blow my nose hard-even when there is nothing in it, to clear out stuff, but it hurts and sometimes bleeds, and i am scared i may die from this infection. i inhaled dirt that may have been contaminated as it said in the article. i didn't even clean the particles in my kitchen, my mom cooked and stuff not knowing, today i breathed in my kitchen through my nose again and i am so scared i may die??

20090128152048AA0utam	Health;Alternative Medicine	How can I control my stress/anger?	I've been really stressed lately and I don't want it to get so bad that I start taking it out on other people. I eat properly, get the right amount of physical activity, and get the right amount of rest. I am stressed because my mother seriously hates me (she doesn't want anything to do with me anymore and wishes she had a boy) my dad is tolerable (it's just the hour car rides I can't stand with him because he keeps repeating himself and I hate it when people repeat themselves more than twice) and my uncle is um well... different (he sings/talks to himself and is so concerned about me it drives me crazy). I used to be able to relax by going to my friend's house and being around her horses but that only works for the time I'm there. As soon as I get in the car, I get yelled at for something I didn't do or did wrong and then my stress less carefree life disappears. There is so much pressure with school because I HAVE to stay on the honor roll otherwise my parent's look at it as the end of the world. My doctor recommends I go to a counselor and talk to them about my problems but that wont help because I tell my best friend everything. All they did for my friend Annie when she told them she wasn't fitting in was to "fake it". Great advise... So now I'm back at square one with no cure to my problem. Is there any way I can control my stress and anger?      Thanks ahead of time:)
20090128152044AAp2sM2	Health;Men's Health	Testicle pain, help!?	So i woke up this morning, took a shower, ate some breakfast, and then took a short nap on the couch kind of in the fetal position because it was cold, and then went to school. At school, my testicles started hurting. It hurts when i walk, run, or whatever, or when my testicles move. Any idea what it could be? How do i get rid of the pain without pills if at all possible? How do i prevent this painful experience from now on? It has been about 7 or so hours and it still hurts, but mostly just when i move. No, i havent been kicked in the balls, and i didnt notice any pain until i sat down in my first class. Please help, it hurts.
20090128151524AASfuZl	Health;Mental Health	How do you cope with a sibling with A.D.H.D/ Asperges Syndrome?	if you are/ did live at home with a sibling who has A.D.D/ A.D.H.D or Asperges Syndrome then can you give me any tips for coping until i move out as i am finding it harder and harder to cope. He's angry constantly, won't listen to me or mum (single parent household) and can't see further than himself. He obssesses about things (usually programmes or objects or specific musicians) and then wonders why we aren't interested in him talking about them...      Also my brother will get attention for good and bad behaviour, gets more positive reinforcement and i get forgotten about because i am the older sister who just does it without being asked twice (this has recently led to a rebellious phase from me of not doing what i am told as i don't seem to be treated differently either way as mum is too busy dealing with my brother).      Any suggestions from anyone with experience in ADHD/ ADD/ Asperges?      Thanks      Kat xxx

20090128152255AAdGwAm	Health;Mental Health	Do you think it's possible to change being overly sensitive?	I posted this question a little while ago and didn't put any detail in it so i guess i thought i would rewrite it. I've basically came to the point in my life where i think i should change some things. I know i'm young, i'm only fifteen, but i need to fix this now. I need to learn to grown up. I have the problem with being way to nice and overly sensitive. I don't know whats wrong with me. I feel like i have a personality disorder. I'm so scared of what people think of me that i refuse to go out with friends and family sometimes. I always end up saying something stupid and then get all embarrassed. I fear rejection and other peoples opinions. I also feel so ugly on the outside and think everyone is making fun of me. Girls my age don't want to be my friend. They're really harsh to me sometimes. When anyone says anything at all rude to me i feel like curling up in a ball and cry. I just cry so much when people say hurtful things. I don't know how to hold it in because it feels like my heart is being just like torn into a million pieces. I just don't know how to fix this, but i want to so badly. I don't always want to be this way. I want to be strong, not weak.

Im 22 and my period has always been irregular, sometimes I would bleed for 2 days every 3 months or I would bleed for 1 whole month every 4 months. Well for the past 4 months I have been bleeding, not heavy just normal and it would stop for a day or two and start up again.  So recently I went to the doctor so that I can find a way of regulating it, well he did an unltra sound on my ovaries and told me I have a bunch of tiny cysts on both of them and he put me on birth control (femcon fe). I have been on it for almost a month now and I haven't stopped bleeding (its just been normal bleeding), but on monday I started clotting and bleeding bad, so bad to where I cannot leave my house, I have to switch pads and tampons every 45 min. Im not cramping or anything and it doesn't hurt and I know for sure that I am not pregnant.  I go back to the doctor next week but does anyone know what it could be?? I am really scared.

20090128151703AAE8eI0	Health;Other - Health	Right sided 'stomach' pain in 11 year old child?	I have an 11 year old daughter who has been complaining of stomach pain for approx 10 days now.    The pain started quite suddenly saturday before last with severe nausea (no vomiting) and some diarrhea which lasted through the week. When asked where the pain was she found it quite difficult to point it out 'it hurts everywhere' she was saying.  Her temperature was a stable 98 and I just put it down to one of the many winter stomach bugs.   By the following Sunday the pain had localised to her right side - below the belly button. The pain comes and goes and varies in intensity, something it settles to a dull ache.    I have taken her to see our family doctor who didn't seem that concerned at all. He had a feel of the area and she promptly burst in to tears with the pain - yet he sent us home with 30mg Codeine tablets to ease her pain - I did question this as she is already slightly constipated.   I asked if there was a chance of it being her appendix 'grumbling' and he said it's utter nonsense and appendix do not 'grumble' - you either have full blown appendicitis or you don't.      Anyone had experience of this?
