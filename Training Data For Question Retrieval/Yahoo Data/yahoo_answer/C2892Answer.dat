Manures contribute to the fertility of the soil by adding organic matter and nutrients, such as nitrogen that is trapped by bacteria in the soil. Higher organisms then feed on the fungi and bacteria in a chain of life that comprises the soil food web.    Etymology  The word manure came from Middle English "manuren" meaning "to cultivate land," and initially from French "main-oeuvre" = "hand work" alluding to the work which involved manuring land.      Types :    There are two classes of manures in soil management:                                 Green manures and animal manures. Compost is distinguished from manure in that it is the decomposed remnants of organic materials (which may, nevertheless, include manure).    Most animal manure is feces  excrement (variously called "droppings" or "crap" etc) of plant-eating mammals (herbivores) and poultry  or plant material (often straw) which has been used as bedding for animals and thus is heavily contaminated with their feces and urine.    Green manures are crops grown for the express purpose of plowing them under. In so doing, fertility is increased through the nutrients and organic matter that are returned to the soil. Leguminous crops, such as clover, also "fix" nitrogen through rhizobia bacteria in specialized nodes in the root structure.    Other types of plant matter used as manure or fertilizer include: the contents of the rumens of slaughtered ruminants; spent hops left over from making beer.    Uses of manure :    Manure has been used for centuries as a fertilizer for farming, as it is rich in nitrogen and other nutrients which facilitate the growth of plants. Liquid manure from pig/hog operations is usually knifed (injected) directly into the soil to reduce the unpleasant odors. Manure from hogs and cattle is spread on fields using a Manure spreader. Due to the relatively lower level of proteins in grasses, which herbivores eat, cattle manure has a milder smell than the dung of carnivores  for example, elephant dung is practically odorless. However, due to the quantity of manure applied to fields, odor can be a problem in some agricultural regions. Poultry droppings are harmful to plants when fresh but after a period of composting are valuable fertilizers.    The dried manure of animals has been used as fuel throughout history. Dried manure (usually known as dung) of cow was, and still is, an important fuel source in countries such as India, while camel dung may be used in treeless regions such as deserts. On the Oregon Trail, pioneering families collected large quantities of "buffalo chips" in lieu of scarce firewood. It has been used for many purposes, in cooking fires and to combat the cold desert nights.    Another use of manure is to make paper, this has been done with dung from elephants where it is a small industry in Africa and Asia, and also horses, llamas, and kangaroos. These animals are not ruminants and thus tend to pass plant fibres undigested in their dung.       Precautions :    Manure generates heat as it decomposes, and it is not unheard of for manure to ignite spontaneously should it be stored in a massive pile. Once such a large pile of manure is burning, it will foul the air over a very large area and require considerable effort to extinguish. Large feedlots must therefore take care to ensure that piles of fresh manure (feces) do not get excessively large. There is no serious risk of spontaneous combustion in smaller operations.    There is also the risk of flies landing on exposed feces and then flying away and landing on food and also of flies breeding in manure.|`|AA12211776	There are two classes of manures in soil management: green manures and animal manures.

iI1TX7vnaa	Global warming is at the fore front because politicians found how to use a new platform to get re-elected. The world leadersuse it because they found ways to make money at it. This is a made up problem just like Global Cooling in the 1970's. Wake up people. I agree we need to be more efficient with our resources, and we should fine and jail companies who are dumping into our rivers maliciously. I want to stop the raiforest destruction, but to say that global warming is a serious man made issue and we need to destroy the American economy and bow down to the rest of the world certainly does not float my boat. Follow the money on this one and you will see that it is all for political gain and grant money for those scientists who profit off of the government if global warming stays at the front of the issues. Look deep into the Keoto (sp?) Treaty, first of all they took jets to a non-central resort location. Not very environmentally concious. THen in the parameters of the treaty they have a clause that makes it so you can buy or sell polution credits. This is all about shifting wealth and breaking down the United States. This is painfully obvious, just look at peoples agenda. The earth's mean temperature has risen .6 degrees C in the past 125 years. Greenland's icecaps have gotten colder in the past 10 years. The Scientists who do not gain anything on their posisition will tell you that the earth has a natural progression and this is what we are seeing. The UN report is made up of POLITICIANS not a good spread of scientists. THere are as many or more scientists who believe that man in NOT the reason and it is over hyped, but their voice is not heard in the LIberal Mainstream Media. This issue is 99% political, and an attempt to make the USA a socialist nation, and eventually communisim. WAKE UP AMERICA, IT IS TIME TO BE AMERICANS. FOR THE PEOPLE BY THE PEOPLE.

Incorporacin al agua de materias extra?as, como microorganismos, productos qumicos, residuos industriales y de otros tipos, o aguas residuales. stas materias deterioran la calidad del agua y la hacen intil para los usos pretendidos.    ?Por qu se contaminan los rios??      El agua se contamina por culpa de la actividad humana, ya que el hombre se multiplica y necesita cada vez ms comida, ms agua, vestimenta, transporte, remedios, entretenimientos.

Toda el agua pura procede de la lluvia, a veces antes de llegar al suelo recibe su primera carga contaminante, que se disuelven sustancias, como xidos de azufre y de nitrgeno que la convierten en lluvia cida. Una vez en el suelo, el agua discurre por la superficie e infiltra hacia capas subterrneas. Es el agua de escorrenta, que en las capas y las granjas se carga de pesticidas del exceso de nutrientes y en las ciudades arrastra productos como aceite de agua, metales pesados y nafta. La contaminacin puntual es la que procede de fuentes localizadas es controlable mediante plantas depuradoras.

Thou shalt champion all those that whine and moan because they don't have exactly what they want as "victims," and thou shalt bellow loudly about their so-called "plight".    7.  Thou shalt not defend thy views with logical, cogent arguments; nay, thou shalt engage in bashing, name-calling, and infantile elementary school playground tactics to belittle thy detractors.    6.  Thou shalt accuse anyone who disagreeth with thy views as being bigoted, narrow-minded, less intelligent, less understanding, and less accepting than thee.    5.  Thou shalt abdicate thine own abilites to that of the government and expect the government to take care of all citizens (yes, even the bigoted, narrow-minded, less intelligent, less understanding, less accepting, heathen infidels).    4.  Thou shalt do everything in thy power to punish those who work hard and contribute to society whilst rewarding those who do and contribute nothing.    3.  Thou shalt protect the lives of animals which hath no rights and criminals that hath no conscience, but thou shalt answer "My body, my choice" when questioned about the state-sanctioned murder of innocent unborn children.    2.  Thou shalt blamest conservatives for all evils in the world, be they real or perceived.    And the number one commandment of being a liberal:    1.  Thou shalt tolerate no gods other than thyself.|`|lMRoeJPyaa	Your very right, that is one thing I myself try to tell people also.

Profit levels hit new records over the last few years and its no wonder that the market crashed due to every1 puting their prices up to rediculous heights. I believe personally , unless the world realises that greed and profit go hand in hand, it will never change, the solution is simple, less monopolies, more businesses and higher competition, lower prices and even profit margens. heh but like thats going to happen, this world is greedy!!! taking money from the poor, giving it to the greedy pricks that are rich, and destroying the market as we know it and life as we live it.

AA11264399	No, it's a rational assessment of objective evidence.  There is no doubt that the planet is warming, as demonstrated by:    Rising global average air temperatures (0.13C per decade).  Rising global average ocean temperatures.  Rising global average sea level (3.1mm per year)  Observed decreases in snow and ice extent.  Thawing of permafrost by up to 3C since the 1980s.  Cooling of the stratosphere (i.e. more heat retained at lower altitudes).  Significant increase of precipitation in some areas (e.g. eastern US).

4CMENEKnaa	That isn't the correct way to think about the problem, in my opinion.  Water vapor released into the troposphere from combustion doesn't stay in the troposphere.  It rains back out in a day.  CO2, in contrast, hangs around with a lifetime of many decades.  This difference in atmospheric lifetime is why water vapor is a feedback, not a forcing to climate (meaning increases in water vapor will result from other things causing an increase in temperature, but water vapor itself can't drive a temperature increase in the troposphere).      So focusing on the greenhouse potential of water vapor compared to CO2 is the wrong thing to compare.  Compare atmospheric lifetimes.  The reason fuel cells are better is that they put a gas into the atmosphere that has a large radiative forcing, but very short lifetime, so it doesn't build up.      There is an article on www.realclimate.org that discusses the role of water vapor as a feedback.  Also the IPCC AR4 that pegminer cites is good, although a bit long.|`|AsKWImpQaa	I thought that the IPCC's "Physical Science Basis" might have something (it does have a table comparing radiative forcing for various anthropogenic greenhouse gases) but a cursory glance did not reveal a table like you want.    I'm not sure one exists, but you can find the IR absorption spectra of water vapor and CO2 online, so you  might be able to compare them that way.  You'd have to do some sort of integration over a mean surface emission to find out how they compare.

Siberia and Alaska have experienced record cold and London has received lower temperatures and an unusual amount of snow.  From what I have heard from Dr Roy Spencer; anyone  in the scientific community who doubts AGW and publishes a researched paper has their paper rejected outright(His was rejected by one reviewer which is unheard of considering his stature). I have read the propaganda and found it to be lacking in reason and fair application.  The conclusions are oversimplified and often discredited in the same article by the old " We don't know"  or "We don't understand"  and an awful lot of 'maybes' and 'what ifs' portrayed as a certain "debunking" of Dr Spencer and other critics work.  More scientists seem to be joining the "critics" side especially after they retire and are no longer responsible for acquiring "new equipment."  BTW there are 650 other scientists who debunked the AGW theory in Europe.  The only certain thing is if fear forces action on our energy supply we will have a lower standard of living and turn life into hell for the average joe.  No doubt Al Gore and company will continue to take corporate jets and enjoy the good life while we languish. BTW Can anyone actually believe that mankind can make a lasting contribution to GW given the age of the Earth and being a minimun producer of GHG?    Even our Co2 production is a is a joke in context to all of the variables at play. The difference between nature vs man producing GHG is an order of magnitude in favor of nature (we can't even measure its size but only "Guess").

People simply don't want to believe that we're changing the global climate in a dangerous way because it's a scary concept.  People are often afraid of change, and not only is the Earth's climate itself changing rapidly, but to avoid catastrophic climate change, we're going to have to change the way we do things.  We have to become more energy efficient and use more environmentally friendly technologies.    That's a lot of change that's going to happen in a pretty small amount of time.  Not only that, but we're also going to have to establish either a carbon tax or cap and trade system, and a lot of people think 'tax' is a four-letter word.    So it just boils down to fear, and a natural reaction to fear is denial.  Unfortunately denying a problem doesn't make it go away, it just allows the problem to get worse.|`|zTj6bnIlaa	I think we must have very different ideas on the definition of the word proven.

However, in southern countries, it is visible as during the summer, the highest temperature shows that it increased by 1c every year.

53VgQm9Caa	Yes I am aware of that.    The scientist you are referring to is James Hansen, head of NASA's Goddard Institute for Space Studies. This is my theory as to why every climate change denier on the net tries to literally smear his name in excrement at every possible opportunity.     According to them he is a compulsive liar, a confidence trickster, a satanist, a kitten murderer and even a communist. Attacking him as a person not only distracts people from the embarrassing fact that NASA's Data disagrees with them, but also the fact that Bush tried to have the data censored.    The man who tried to censor Hansen was George W. Bush's personal appointee to the position of NASA press secretary, George Deutsch III. He instructed NASA officials to limit James Hansen's access to the media. He also asked them to censor references to "the Big Bang" in their reports, and other topics "uncomfortable to the Bush administration".

NfcaC4xCaa	According to the USA Endangered Species Act 1973:    An "endangered" species is one that is "in danger of extinction" throughout all or a significant portion of its range.    A "threatened" species is one that is "likely to become endangered" within the foreseeable future.    However according to the IUCN (International Union for Conservation of Nature) categorisations the term "endangered" and "threatened" are interchangable.    They use other categories such as vulenrable, near threatened etc etc|`|H6dXRkydaa	It depends on the context, they can be used to mean one and the same thing. However, threatened can be used to describe a species that is close to becoming classed as endangered. When a species becomes endangered, they are at a serverly high risk of extinction.
pnCOR1UVaa	I don't think the stimulus will do much for the economy in the short run. It is just going to take time for people and businesses to learn to spend within their means.     The only things I see that are guaranteed to have a tax payer pay back are some of his "green" initiatives. If he can make federal buildings more energy efficient then they will save millions if not billions each year. Auto makers are crying that no one will buy their hybrids or fuel efficient cars, we can help them out by upgrading our federal fleet. The fuel efficiency can also help reduce our demand for foreign oil.     Many people only want to look at short term gains. I see many of the things he is has put into the package as long term projects, perhaps they don't belong in a "stimulus" package, but I see the benefit. If we are able to increase clean power and reduce dirty coal we will have long term health benefits. Since many of the families who live near coal plants are low income it is in our best interest to decrease their health risks, since the tax payers will be paying for much of their care.    I see some good, some questionable and some bad. Nothing is perfect and I don't always follow the logic in each of the elements.|`|20f3291b9320a302e9070bf55325531daa	I think it's great.

XHvAhSFGaa	I donated clothes before to a thrift shop and they had me pull around back to unload and right there in front of me I had seen a thrift store employee throwing clothes in the trash!! i asked why? and they responded because we can not do anything with these clothes, no one will buy them. I was really upset because I thought they would at least re-donate to like Africa or something. So you know what I do now-- I drive to a poor area and just drop it off --one time I had drove into a very poor mobile home park and just dropped clothing off at someones step and drove away. I posted a note on it--if you want it keep it, what you can not use pass to your neighbor.|`|tpZwcYLQaa	depending on wer u live, like in canada u can send clothes to like i tihnk its called "Goodwill" and in some plaza's they have "dumpster" look-alike and u can just "dump" ur clothes there|`|Tht2NMIGaa	Call your local sanitation department.

If you're not sure about what to do with them, you could try putting an add in a local paper - 'free to good home xx bags of clothing' - making sure you briefly describe the condition of them.

This can be extremely dangerous, especially if the sting is around the face / mouth / throat, as the swelling can cause obstruction of the airways. People who know they are allergic should always carry an anti-allergic "pen" with them so they immediately have the antidote to the poison when required.|`|XsPqFn1caa	I think this is true although I might need to look it up later,anyway a bees sting is supposed to contain a poison (very weak).
14YGePYoaa	Forests can be managed effectively without endangering rare species of plants and animals and without risking global environmental damage.  Companies that harvest timber should not be allowed to "clear cut" large areas of forest and should be required to plant new trees after they cut old trees down.  Governments should create large parks and reserves where hunting and logging are not allowed.  As a world community, we must be careful not to destroy the resources that people will need in the future.    Many animals from the rainforests are brought to our country illegally.  Parrots and iguanas, for example, are often imported illegally.   We should not buy these animals, since that encourages other people to bring in more animals.|`|yxoXTmlqaa	We shouldn't.

Seems to me the point is moot.|`|IZKBRqp7aa	watch Earthlings. its a documentary about animals in relation to humans. its on youtube in parts.|`|NfcaC4xCaa	Firstly it is impossible to "preserve" our wildlife. It is only possible to "conserve" our wildlife ... and I hope by "our" you mean Earth's.    In response to Evans post, especially in regards to clear cut, this is sometimes required in certain shade intolerant forests as a large enough gap is needed to be created for regeneration to be effective, e.g. Eucalyptus diversicolor (Karri), Eucalytpus delegatensis (Alpine Ash).    However back to your oriringal post. The intrinsic value of wildlife for humans is hard to ascertain as nearly all our thinking is towards economic values. I guess the aesthetic values could be argued to be more intrisinc. I guess it really comes down to ones values, and the ability to accept that the bidoviersity of life in ecosystems is important as all life should be respected and any harm minimised.     However personally I believe that the argument needs to be firstly economically based rathter then intrinsically based because of the materialism of the humans. I guess you could look at indigenous cultures and how they believed in the intrinsic value of the wildlife (however they still used it for resources, hunting, food, etc so is that purely intrinsic value??). Also many of the indigenous cultures believed that the Earth and wildlife were spiritually of value.
1EJN1Giwaa	I'm not concerned, it'll stop us for a while but we already have the technology for powering vehicles with other substances. Wonder what the saudi's will do.|`|5cb5feb035bd6f8ad961e6c52149cc41aa	Not really.   We are running on outdated technology now just because it's cheaper in the short run than upgrading our lifestyles.   Electric cars have been available for over 100 years.    Safer steam engines are now available that can run off wood, trash or pretty much anything that burns.    Trains could all be electric and haul more natural fertilizer to grow crops than using fertilizers derived from petroleum products.    Wind, solar, tidal and even the expensive new nuclear power could run all our devices that now use oil.    Plant products could make plastics.   Oil is an outdated commodity; peak oil will not hurt us too much.|`|zNB3tZXraa	I would think that the environuts would welcome this. However, I do not believe  Kunstler. He is basically repeating, or plagerizing the words of  geologist M. King Hubbert. Hubbert wrote in the 1950's that oil supply would decrease, once half of it had been extracted. Mathematically, this makes sense, but how do we know when one half of the oil has been extracted. He predicted this to happen in 1970, but it hasn't. Also keep in mind, that we now have more advanced methods for finding oil, and getting oil out of the ground. These methods did not exist in 1950.|`|b5b22241b72a751e94c18311e3dd0dddaa	I was concerned before the economy tanked.  No time to care anymore, too busy living hand to mouth.    Any conspiracy theorists wondering if the failed economy was intentional?  Bush was an oil man, afterall.|`|L8zmQS8Jaa	There are many different factors at work in the world:  the potential for tsunamis in many places of the world, a 1918 style flu epidemic, severe economic collapse,(fiat currency,) severe global climate or magnetic shift, peak oil, global water shortage, and the resulting global food shortage.  All this is not to speak of man's propensity for inhumanity towards men or cataclysmic astrological or geological events.  Of these peak oil is probably the most easy to deal with in a severely difficult sort of way.      So what to do?  Pearl Buck wrote a book called "The Wave" in which she spoke of a village where the threat was constantly from the ocean waves or a volcano.  The villagers never knew which way to run when the Earth shook.      Should any tragedy befall our world it is likely to come in at least pairs.  To some extent preparation is impossible except the possibly to be prepared for "anything."  We can do what we can as best as we are able in any way we know how.  But if there is something you can personally do nothing about what options do you have?

A conventional hybrid has an electric motor and an internal combustion motor.... so it is gas and electric.. and the car can actually be run on either source separately..    GM's new volt system will have both an electric power source and a backup internal combustion system.. however it is NOT a hybrid.  The internal combustion system runs a generator that recharges the batteries that run the electric power source|`|0vQsoYIbaa	No, because a fuel cell itself can not propel a car.  The electric motor propels a fuel cell car.|`|1tLmTjBxaa	are u askin hybrid vehicle ?terminology is unlear and maybe hybrid referes to conventional fuel(like petrol) and electricity...and not hydrogen..so maybe its just electric vehicle|`|5cb5feb035bd6f8ad961e6c52149cc41aa	I think that's kinda like calling an average vehicle on the road today a hybrid since they are gas and combustion both.   When the fuel is used to make the energy that runs the vehicle I don't think it is a hybrid.   If your vehicle could be plugged in or run solely on batteries or had regenerative breaking to charge the batteries then maybe it would be hybrid.|`|L8zmQS8Jaa	Along those lines of thinking maybe it could be a tribrid because of the sun beating on the roof.  Or perhaps it could be a quadbrid because gravity is holding it down.  ...    No.  Fuel Cell vehicles are all electric cars that produce the electricity on board unlike a subway car that has the electricity transmitted to it or a battery electric car that has the electricity stored in batteries onboard.  A bicycle that has an electric assist motor is a hybrid because it has two different ways to run the vehicle.
L8zmQS8Jaa	You could call it anything you like.      Conventional use however is to use the term "hybrid" for vehicles that get their operating power from two different usually switchable types of motors.   A velomobile (recumbent bicycle with a air stream body:  aka "bicycle car") that has an electric assist motor might be called a hybrid as the vehicle could be run by pedel power or electric motor (or combining both.)1     A distinction is made between hybrid vehicles and flex-fuel vehicles   Flex fuel vehicles use the same engine with different fuels.    A further clarification might be made between series hybrid vehicles and parallel hybrid vehicles.  When operation in "Assist" mode the bicycle in the example above is a parallel hybrid that is getting it's moving power partially from the pedel and part from the, often hub. electric motor.   The Prius is a parallel hybrid.  An example of a series hybrid would be an all electric vehicle that was towing a generator.  The generator powered the vehicle and charges the batteries.2   (Giving you the benefits of an all electric vehicle with the range of a vehicle that has an internal combustion engine on board.)      If you had a fuel cell vehicle that fed it's power into both charging a bank of batteries and powering the vehicle and the vehicle could run on battery power or the fuel cell you might consider it a hybrid.  But why would you want to do this?  Without the batteries the fuel cells would be an essential component for the vehicle to run.  Thus there would not be 2 sources, only one.      In the end though some of these distinctions are only rhetoric.  To say a fuel cell vehicle is a FCV and not an EV is inaccurate but it sounds nice if you are trying to avoid popular thinking in favor of EVs.  Fuel cells produce electricity and run electric motors which power electricly powered vehicles ie an EV, (perhaps a FCEV?)  They are just not battery electric vehicles BEV or electric vehicles that get their power transmitted to them (TEV?) like a tram, overhead electric busses (trolleybus) or subway cars (through a 3ed rail).|`|RVX5uALYaa	Hey!    Vehicles powered by fuel cells are called Fuel Cell Vehicle's (FCV) and not hybrid electric vehicles.    Fuel cell vehicles, powered by hydrogen, have the potential to revolutionize our transportation system. They are more efficient than conventional internal combustion engine vehicles and produce no harmful tailpipe exhaust - their only emission is water. Fuel cell vehicles and the hydrogen infrastructure to fuel them are in an early stage of development.     Fuel cell vehicles can be fueled with pure hydrogen gas stored directly on the vehicle or extracted from a secondary fuel - such as methanol, ethanol, or natural gas - that carries hydrogen. These secondary fuels must first be converted into hydrogen gas by an onboard device called a reformer. Fuel cell vehicles fueled with pure hydrogen emit no pollutants, only water and heat. Vehicles that use secondary fuels and a reformer produce only small amounts of air pollutants.

A hybrid vehicle is powered by electricity and another fuel, usually gasoline.|`|2gegv4smaa	No.Fuel-cell vehicles will likely be much like hybrid vehicles with fuel cells instead of gasoline or diesel engines.      Hybrid vehicles have both a conventional gas engine (which is quite fuel efficient) and a small electric motor to boost mpg. it usually works by having the electric motor running the car at very low speeds or while idling, then the gas engine comes into use at highr speeds or to charge to electric motor.    Fuels cell cars on the other hand don't need a single drop of gas, they run entirely on hydrogen (derived from water) and some of them use an electric device to seperate the oxygen from the water.    A hybrid electric vehicle (HEV) is a hybrid vehicle which combines a conventional propulsion system with a rechargeable energy storage system (RESS) to achieve better fuel economy than a conventional vehicle. It includes a propulsion system additional to the electric motors, to be not hampered by range from a charging unit like a battery electric vehicle (BEV).    FCVs can be fueled with pure hydrogen gas stored onboard in high-pressure tanks,emit no pollutants,only water and heat.They also can be fueled with hydrogen-rich fuels; such as methanol, natural gas, or even gasoline; but these fuels must first be converted into hydrogen gas by an onboard device called a "reformer."In addition, FCVs can be twice as efficient as similarly sized conventional vehicles and may also incorporate other advanced technologies to increase efficiency.A Fuel cell vehicle or FC vehicle (FCV) is any vehicle that uses a fuel cell to produce its on-board motive power.
