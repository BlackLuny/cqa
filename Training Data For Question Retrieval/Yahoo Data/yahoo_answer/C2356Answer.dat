I know where I am, it's easier to get into medicine if you go to a sixth form, but I'm not certain for everywhere! It also depends highly on your GCSE results! They look for perfection. Good luck with it anyway!|`|bdc81a350221a05348d3b5708b5daa86aa	Unless you have A+ results you wont get into Cambridge University. Scottish education doesn't have A levels, we have standard grades at school and if you get good results you stay on and do Highers which is the level above A levels. To get into Scottish University doing medicine you need 5 standard grades, must be credit english at least grade 2 and 5 Highers in AAAAB grade 2 of which must be, chemistry, biology, maths or physics. It takes 5 years to complete and to go on to graduate you must have First or Second Class Honour degrees. Check out their websites for info. www.gla.ac.uk they claim it is one of the most prestigious courses in the uk.|`|MAdFGBN8aa	There are 2 different types of colleges. The first one is where you do your A Levels. They are generally called 6th form colleges. The other type is a college that is accredited to a university (ie when you get your degree it will come from the university as well as the college) So you will need to go to a 6th form college before you start applying to a college or university that will offer the course you want to do.

pzLDXL6gaa	Depends what you want to do with your degree. If you want certain types of jobs, like an academic in that field, a PhD is a must. If you want to go into a slightly different field or a lower level, it would probably be best to just go straight out to work after the degree, and if you need further study later on you can go back to it (some employers give you time off, or money, to do a Masters for example). There are some areas/jobs where you can make a large amount with just a Bachelor degree, but others where to advance to a high pay rate you'd need further qualifications.<br>  <br>  Harriet

GokA3YGkaa	I'm not sure what would be best, I apologize because I am really sleepy and am about to crash but as a community college student, one valuable information I learned early on is to double check with the equivalency guide of the university you want to go to, to be certain the class(es) from the community college transfer.  I am not sure if the community college you want to go to is in the same state or not.  Most universities have a way to double check credits from other same state colleges.<br>  <br>  I wanted to make sure I let you know that because it saves time and money if you go that route.<br>  <br>  Also, if you wantt to go into a specific major, check out their departmnent requirements.  For instance, Comp engineering at univ of washington doesn't need english 201, but it does need technical writing.  So at the comm college level you wouldn[t need eng 201.<br>  <br>  Call/email the contact for the department you want to apply.  They usually want to help you prepare for transfer.  THey often say FORGET about getting an AA and transferring, jus get the prerequisites out of the way for applying to their department and then transfer.  Call and ask if that would be preferable to the department you want to go to.<br>  <br>  Hope this info is good for you.<br>  <br>  Good luck on your decision, I hope someone else is more awake to help you with that!

FGyBCGZYaa	Let's start with the middle problem, 2y(4) - 26y(2) + 84.  The process is the same for all factoring.  I'm going to use ^ for power.<br>  <br>  Factor out any common factors:<br>  2(y^4 - 13y^2 + 42)<br>  <br>  Rearrange so the powers are in order from highest to lowest.  This is not necessary for this problem, but is necessary for the first one.<br>  <br>  Examine the signs of the terms.  The first and last signs are positive, so the signs in the factors are the same, the middle sign is -, so the signs are -.  We now have:<br>  <br>  (y^2 - ??)(y^2 - ??)<br>  <br>  Now, we're looking for the two numbers we can multiply together and get 42 and that we can add together and get 13.  6x7 = 42 and 6+7=13, so<br>  <br>  2y^4 - 26y^2 + 84 = <br>  2(y^2 - 7)(y^2 - 6)<br>  <br>  If 84 had been negative and y^4 positive, we'd need opposite signs in the factors.  We'd have been looking for two numbers we could multiply to get 42 and subtract to get 13.<br>  <br>  Now you try the other two.
GfUzvROsaa	I am from Kansas and am familiar with both universities.  Either Kansas or Kansas State would be excellent schools, however, as you recognize in your statement about being "worried", selecting a university is about finding the right overall match for you.  A couple of things I can share:<br>  <br>  They are both considered "large" universities in terms of the number of students, so be sure this is the size college you want.  <br>  <br>  Kansas State is located in a more rural area, with the next closest city, Topeka, about 1hour away.  KU is located in Lawrence, which is immediately accessible to the metropolitan area of Kansas City, so there is more to do in the surrounding area.   <br>  <br>  The "reputation" of each has been that KU is a more liberal college and K-State more conservative.....this still tends to be true and is considered one of the biggest differences between the two universities; esp. when it comes to politics.  <br>  <br>  The people in Kansas are friendly no matter where you are, however, check on how the "demographics" of each campus fit with what you want, ie, what percentage of male/female, minorities/majorities, greek/independent, etc.  You can get this information from their admission's offices or on their websites.   <br>  <br>  I have had two of my children attend a very large university, UT, 3 hours away, and a third child for whom it was a miserable failure.  She is now attending a college 1/2 the size of Texas and closer to home.  It is exactly what she needed.  You are asking the right questions to find the best match for you. <br>  <br>  Congratulations and my best!  teresa

2UDbOpxTaa	In the UK, at sixth form (age 16 to 18, after GCSE) you do your A levels. The first year of these is called the AS levels, which count for half the A level. Then the secon year is called A2 which counts for the other half. Typically you will do 4 AS levels, then drop one and do 3 A2s.<br>  After A levels, you can go to university, which is where you get your degree. Most degrees take 3 years (though some take more), and whilst you do this you are an "undergraduate".<br>  To get into Cambridge you need A levels (usually 3 at grade A), although you will apply after you just have your AS levels.<br>  <br>  EDIT: If you are from another country that doesn't do A levels, you dont' necessarily need A levels to get into Cambridge.

So he fell inlove with his own reflection in the water and stared in the waters for hours unend, the waters eventually got rippled and his image got distored, he tried to 'save' his own image and fell in and drowned.<br>  <br>  <br>  The terminology :<br>  <br>  A narcissist is someone who is shallow, cares about looks (his own or others who surround him), loves himself too much and is obsessive about beauty.|`|Ti0q1Btiaa	A narcissist is never wrong, about anything.<br>  It's not that they deny any wrong doing.

JoyIIiZ6aa	I would suggest starting by collecting some data on how perceptions of healthy and beautiful changed over time, then talking about how fashion was a source of inspiration which created a following in times of royalty.  A king or queen set the tone not just for the royal court but for the rest of the country as well, so in a sense they were the first fashion models and courts were the first runways.  With the advancements of technology, drawings, sketches and printing press opened opportunities for fashion reaching wider audiences much faster.  Find out when first actual models were used to present clothing in catalogs and magazines, and then jump into modern day fashion obsessions where models like Twiggy became an overnight sensation sending girls into anorexia all over the world in the industrialized countries.  Support your claim of models being unhealthy in their presentation of weight and height by using height and weight charts for normal average people.  Note, that it is only women who are presented as undernourished waifs, while for men the toned muscular healthy body is the standard. Add a paragraph or two about how airbrushing in photography changed things for models too, allowing for manipulation of pictures to make the already skinny women look even skinnier, and creating some seriously unrealistic body images.<br>  <br>  Here are a few links which might be helpful:<br>  <a href="http://www.bodyimagehealth.org/model.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.bodyimagehealth.org/model.htm...</a><br>  <a href="http://parentingteens.about.com/od/bodyimage/f/media_bodyimage.htm" rel="nofollow">http://parentingteens.about.com/od/bodyi...</a><br>  <a href="http://parentingteens.about.com/od/bodyimage/f/media_bodyimage.htm" rel="nofollow">http://parentingteens.about.com/od/bodyi...</a><br>  <br>  Hope this helps.

S6W4IMfYaa	UNIVERSAL FORMULA - S M I L E<br>  <br>  Be cool and talk with a light heart. Ur care showen to them will make them happy.|`|6DFhlt4daa	Happiness is generic, and is applied to almost every<br>  kind of enjoyment except that of the animal appetites.<br>  <br>  Only saint-like persons, who feel that they are no<br>  longer interested in the external world, think that<br>  happiness is within. For many persons, nothing can make<br>  them happy. Our minds are as different as our finger<br>  prints - no two are alike. Listening to loud music<br>  makes one happy and makes another unhappy. Hence, there<br>  can be no single definition for happiness. It is<br>  probably impossible to objectively define happiness as<br>  humans know and understand it, as internal experiences<br>  are subjective by nature. Because of this, explaining<br>  happiness as experienced by one individual is as<br>  pointless as trying to define the color green such that<br>  a completely color blind person could understand the<br>  experience of seeing green.<br>  <br>  As a state and a subject, it has been pursued and<br>  commented on extensively throughout world history.<br>  <br>  "Call no man happy till he is dead."  - Aeschylus<br>  <br>  "True happiness arises, in the first place, from the<br>  enjoyment of one's self, and in the next, from the<br>  friendship and conversation of a few select<br>  companions." - Joseph Addison<br>  <br>  Happiness is often associated with the presence of<br>  favourable circumstances such as a supportive family<br>  life, a loving marriage, and economic stability. Kali<br>  Yuga, the age of darkness, is the time when these<br>  favourables are difficult to find.<br>  <br>  Unfavorable circumstances - such as abusive<br>  relationships, accidents, loss of employment, and<br>  conflicts - diminish the amount of happiness a person<br>  experiences. In all nations, factors such as hunger,<br>  disease, crime, corruption, and warfare can decrease<br>  happiness. However, according to several ancient and<br>  modern thinkers, happiness is influenced by the<br>  attitude and perspective taken on such circumstances.<br>  <br>  From the observation that fish must become happy by<br>  swimming, and birds must become happy by flying.<br>  Aristotle points to the unique abilities of man as the<br>  route to happiness. Of all the animals only man can sit<br>  and contemplate reality. Of all the animals only man<br>  can develop social relations to the political level.<br>  Thus the contemplative life of a monk or a professor, or<br>  the political life of a military commander or<br>  a politician will be the happiest according to their own<br>  "psyche". <br>  <br>  Our minds are as different as our finger prints - no two <br>  are alike.<br>  <br>  The following is the self-reported positive affect<br>  (i.e. positive emotion) during the day by 909 employed<br>  women in USA:<br>  <br>  Activities and their positive effect index:<br>  <br>  Intimate relations  5.10  <br>  Socializing          4.59  <br>  Relaxing         4.42  <br>  Pray/Worship/Meditate  4.35  <br>  Eating           4.34  <br>  Exercising       4.31  <br>  Watching TV          4.19  <br>  Shopping         3.95  <br>  Preparing food   3.93  <br>  On the phone     3.92  <br>  Napping          3.87  <br>  Taking care of <br>  my children      3.86  <br>  Computer/Email/<br>  Internet         3.81  <br>  Housework        3.73  <br>  Working          3.62  <br>  Commuting        3.45  <br>  <br>  Interaction with partners:<br>  <br>  w/ friends       4.36  <br>  w/ relatives     4.17  <br>  w/ spouse/Significant <br>  other            4.11  <br>  w/ children      4.04  <br>  w/ clients/customers  3.79  <br>  w/ co-workers    3.76  <br>  w/ boss          3.52 <br>  alone            3.41 <br>  <br>  <br>   <br>  Happiness is not entirely psychological in<br>  nature - it has got a biological basis too. The<br>  neurotransmitter dopamine is involved in desire and<br>  seems often related to pleasure. Pleasure can be<br>  induced artificially with drugs. Use of drugs is not<br>  some thing new, it has been used by many including<br>  Sanyasis since millenia.<br>  <br>  Our minds are as different as our finger prints <br>  - no two are identical.|`|kuBdwsbIaa	be jovial and gentlemen to people... but you can not make all the peoples are happy|`|AA12310790	Spend some of your resources - say your time, effort, money, knowledge, etc.- for the benefit of another person, preferably when you know that he needs them more - voluntarily, and without expecting anything in return.

O1Xm6X7Iaa	So if you fail first year (which I'm assuming you will) are you still going to drop out or repeat the year?<br>  <br>  If you repeat the year then you'll have to notify your LEA as it will affect the loan/grant for the next academic year but I doubt you would have to pay anything back. If you fail and drop out completely then you will also have to notify your LEA but I don't think that you would have to pay back a grant, only a loan as per usual. I don't think it's dependant upon your academic record while at uni.<br>  <br>  If you fail the first year (by either failing your resits or not attending your resits) then you'll probably get a letter from the uni listing your options. I would assume that one of these options will be to drop out completely. You will have to notify the uni that you won't be returning. I'm not sure if there's anything to sign, an email notification might suffice.<br>  <br>  Every uni has different procedures but you will have to let them and your LEA know of your decisions. Hope this helps and good luck.|`|hISwD8tcaa	I think the only way the LA can make you pay back your grant is if youve lied on your forms (e.g. saying your parents earn less than they actuall do) no because you havent turned up because some people dong go 2 lectures but scrape through exams and carry on. the lecturers at my uni dont know who turns up anyway as they dont take registers, they only care that essays are handed in, so if your LA wanted to check (which i really doubt they evert would) then your uni wouldnt be able to tell them much anyway!<br>  <br>  As for your second question... yes i think you will have to sign the official paperwork. this is because i think a lot of people who fail may want to re do the year or their exams as they would have not failed on purpose. So when the time comes go and see your student support office or email your personal tutor to check. you can always just write a letter to inform them, and its polite to aswell, and then you have done your bit and they can forward you any papers you need to sign.<br>  <br>  hope that helps x

LwygS5Wvaa	I'm not sure exactly what you are asking. Are you wondering why you need to provide children with consistent routines every day or why the routines and activities you offer need to be common and familiar, i.e. "everyday"?<br>  If the former, it is because children need consistency. If the school day is predictable, then the children know what to expect; this helps them feel in control, lets them plan out their play to a certain extent, and helps them develop self-esteem.<br>  If the latter, it is because such young children will be able to best relate to topics that are familiar. Children under 3 are still working on making sense of the immediate reality, and will likely be most interested in topics that strike close to home: babies, food, washing, sleep, etc.

F32uPjAraa	The Han empire began in 206 B.C. when Liu Bang, prince of Han, defeated the Qin army in the valley of Wei. The defeat was part of a larger rebellion that began after the First Emporer's death. The people were dissatisfied with the tyranny of the Qin leaders and their Legalist form of government. However, while traditional Chinese history portrays the Han as implementing immediate changes in government, evidence shows the Han continued to rule in the tradition of the Qin, and only gradually incorporated Confucian ideals into their Legalist form of government. Economic expansion, changing relationships with the people of the steppes, strengthening of the palace at the expense of the civil service, weakening of the state's hold on the peasantry, and the rise of the families of the rich and the gentry were all factors that led to the adoption of Confucian ideals..<br>  <br>  Under this new form of Legalism and Confucianism, rewards and punishments were still used for common people. However, the administrators were judged based on Confucian principles with the justification for these different sets of standards as they were educated. As a last resort, the ruler could use punishment for both the people and the officials. It was believed that force alone was not a sufficient way to rule and so the emperor needed the help of the Confucianists to guide him morally. Evidence of rulers using their power to punish is found in the records of officials who were beheaded.<br>  <br>  When Liu Bang conquered the Qin, he created his capital at Ch'ang-an. He kept most of the laws and regulations by the Qin and made many of his friends nobility and gave them fiefs. However, the land was still divided up into commanderies and prefectures. Even the fiefs given out were treated like commanderies. Han power was based on direct control of people by the state.<br>  <br>  Like the Qin before them, the main goal of the Han was the unification of China. This goal led to the eventual breakup of the fiefs and the downfall of the imperial nobility. This process was finally complete during Wu Ti's reign (141-87 B.C.) His reign was a period of great military expansion. He expanded the borders into Vietnam and Korea and pushed the Hsiung nu south of the Gobi. Wu Ti transplanted an estimated 2 million people to the northwestern region in order to colonize these areas.<br>  <br>  The expansion also led to trade with the people of inner Asia. Thereafter, the Silk Road was developed. The Silk Road actually consisted of more than one possible route through the mountains that the traders followed. Agriculture grew with the development of better tools. Iron tools were made of better quality, and oxen drawn ploughs were commonly used. Irrigation systems were increased to help develop the areas of North China. Crop rotation was also practiced from 85 B.C. onwards. The state attempted to monopolize the production of iron and salt, which were the two biggest sectors of the economy, but succeeded for less than a century. Silk weaving and copper work were also important activities.|`|cfe693074760514255e63a1a5d0dba6eaa	Here's a thought. Do some research. You obviously have the internet.

During the period there were 24 emperors on the throne. Many were excellent contributing to the prosperity of the country with Emperors Gaozu, Wen, Jing and Wu among them.<br>  <br>  <br>  As many wise emperors took effective measures during their reign, the Han Dynasty was a period of peace and prosperity. It was a World power at that time with interests in literature, arts, culture and technology with the Han Dynasty achieving numerous unparalleled and praiseworthy successes. Some of the achievements at that time still influence the lives of the Chinese people today.

IWSc7xkiaa	I'm all for it if the work is true/false, multiple choice, or very short answer. If they use the key I made, then the odds are nothing can go wrong because they aren't analyzing the answers just checking if it is correct or incorrect. I don't think, however, that I would like a TA to grade my essays or short answer tests that require the students to evaluate and explain.|`|BEkGwc2uaa	Class work yeah, assessments never.

CaqdDzQZaa	10 Things You Can Do For Clean Air <br>   <br>  <br>  1. Modify Your Transportation --- Your car is a significant source of air pollution, so switching to a more gas-efficient vehicle will be a big help.   See How You Can Improve Transportation for several more tips which will improve air quality. <br>  <br>  2. Conserve Energy --- Your home energy consumption translates into air pollution, therefore any energy conservation or efficiency improvements you make will help.  See 21 Ways You Can Save Energy for tips. <br>  <br>  3. Reduce Waste --- Manufacturing of unnecessary or disposable goods often produces air pollution, so reduced purchasing of disposables will help.  In general, follow the solid waste mantra - "Reduce, Reuse, Repair, Recycle" - and this will reduce air pollution as well from transporting, treating, or disposing of unnecessary wastes.  See Waste Reduction Tips. <br>  <br>  4. Eliminate Toxic Chemical Use at Home --- A surprising number of household or home shop chemicals are toxic and volatile.  Many release vapors into the air, inside the home and out.  This can be serious health threat to your family, and contributes to community-wide levels of air pollutants.  See Non-Toxic Household Products. <br>  <br>  5. No Burn Barrels --- Northeast Wisconsin communities need to pass and enforce ordinances prohibiting individuals or businesses from burning trash in their back yards.  This type of uncontrolled burning is extremely polluting, especially when many people are doing it.  When trash is burned incompletely and at relatively low temperatures, a great deal of soot and ash is produced.  Many plastics, coatings, inks, paints, metals and treated woods will produce toxic chemical air pollutants such as dioxin, lead, arsenic, chromium, etc.  <br>  <br>  6. Cut Back or Eliminate Lawn Mowing --- Gasoline-powered lawn mowers and similar yard equipment can produce much higher rates of air pollution than an equivalent horsepower in a car, due to engine inefficiencies and the lack of catalytic converters.  You can help reduce these emissions by converting a large portion, or all, of your lawn to trees, shrubs and easy-care perennials.  (See the Grow Appropriate Plants section, under water conservation tips.)  Then use a non-motorized push-style lawnmower to cut your remaining lawn.  Modern versions of these push mowers are easy to use, and will help you get a little exercise and fresh air, without the fumes. <br>  <br>  7. Plant leafy trees and shrubs --- Deciduous trees and shrubs (the kinds that drop leaves in the fall) are excellent air filters to help reduce smog and cool the air on hot summer days. <br>  <br>  9. Limit Your Family Size --- Every person uses natural resources, which results in air pollution.  Our human population is rapidly rising to levels which make it increasingly difficult to control air pollution while sustaining a healthy environment.  If each couple limited themselves to no more than 2 children, our world’s population could stabilize and support everyone without conflict or suffering.  <br>  <br>  10. Get Involved and Talk to Your Legislators --- Many of our current governmental regulations are not strong enough to address our air pollution problems.   Citizens need to contact their legislators and ask for better policies.|`|mtyhSPi9aa	- car-pooling<br>  - dont smoke ! ban cigarettes !<br>  - filter the gases and fumes released by factories<br>  - produce cars that produce less carbon monoxide<br>  - dont use much aerosol cans < im not sure if this should be under air pollution but ANYWAY<br>  <br>  thats all i got
cHIuBEOBaa	I'm not nervous at all. It's academic dishonesty and if I catch them they receive a grade of 0% and their parent receives an email.  If a teacher ignores it then the teacher is being unfair to the students who do not cheat and who work for their grades. Students, more than anything else, want their teachers to be fair.|`|294db1e52bf0162d7d7ff79b4102975faa	I don't worry about it because i walk around and watch my class when they take a test. But I say to them, "What does it prove?" You look really good because you cheated. I mean you would know that that you cheated to get the grade that you got, so you would know that you didn't really earn it. They would also have to cheat on every test in order to maintain their group level, so is it worth it?|`|ORonhAuvaa	I don't get nervous and I do care. I use exams as a teaching tool.

I personally am a student to this day in law school, and we have an honor code, but it still surprises me how many people violate it.  It is true that the student is throwing their own education away when they cheat, but this is not enough of a guard against the people that society is trying to raise.  I personally, would now look to punish hard against those that are cheating, and of course make it so that they don't feel a need to cheat.  They should be able to come to you, and learn the information.

dycsTrcraa	Taking someones ideas and changing them around and treating them as yours is still plagiarism.  For example if the website said "According to a study done in 2005, 15% of children ages 12-15 tested showed some signs of ADHD" and you wrote "Studies, like the one conducted in 2005, showed that, out of a sample of 12-15 year olds, 15 % showed symptoms of ADHD".... that is still a problem.  Talk with your teacher|`|b536895bf6c779e662d180730661813faa	If you have direct quotes you still need to cite it and that would be fine. However if you cited something and just ripped it either out of or in context, that's considered plagiarism.<br>  <br>  It's kind of lame yeah.<br>  My teacher thought I cheated on my term essay last semester because it was well above and beyond the expected level. Maybe she doesn't believe in your writing capacity. English comes from within, you can't tell if someone is smart in English. Goodluck to you.|`|3Pud0w0waa	Only the teacher can tell you that since we don't see the whole paper here. It might be a problem as simple as forgetting to cite a source correctly or even forgetting to underline or "quote" a source. I would take all my materials used for research and show the teacher the citations that i did to make sure that's not what happened.|`|inFdpMr6aa	no not if u put where u got it from did u put footnotes? i mean footnotes would have helped i was accused for plaugerism once but it was in 5th grade and i didnt know i put where it was from just not footnotes u should be fine|`|YCDS4Am8aa	yes that would be plagarism is in the essay you didnt say "According to www.google.com(example) ADHD affect hundreds oof thousands of people" you have to put the name of the reference before stating the information|`|pdbc4souaa	First, a picayune matter of spelling. "sited" applies to a physical place. "Cited" is the word you were looking for.<br>  <br>  Plagiarism refers to using using other people's work without attribution. From what you describe, I can only say that your case is ambiguous. You have no choice but to meet with your teacher and bring all your notes. <br>  <br>  I would plead that "It was not my intention to plagiarize. I may be guilty of failing to give adequate attributions. Please tell me how I can avoid this type of error in the future."<br>  <br>  What you are asking is similar to me asking you, "Have I lied to anyone in the last week?"

h8kxdNFmaa	Honest to Pete, dyslexia is a gift! <br>  <br>  I've got it, I'm in my mid-30s and I make $25/hour as a graphic designer.<br>  <br>  My biggest nemesis is organization; if I made more money, I'd hire a personal keeper. I'm awful at getting back to phone calls, complex emails, and *** remembering in invoice clients *** for the work I do.  :-) <br>  <br>  What do you do for fun when you're not in school? It's likely THAT is your strength and something you can turn into a career. If you tend to like to cook on the weekends, it's likely that you'd make a kick-*** chef, if you draw and paint in your free time, you may make a great artist. My (admittedly non-dyslexic) spouse was taking apart computers when he was 10 to see how they worked...today he makes $95k as a systems architect. (And a college degree in Computer Science and alot of extra training on systems, too.) If you enjoy doing it, it's likely that you're good at it. You don't normally voluntarily do something for "fun" that you suck at. <br>  <br>  And don't ask me how to turn video gaming into a career, I have no idea. The competition to be a game developer is so extreme and the likelihood of actually making it is so very slim...<br>  <br>  Do you know how many famous and rippingly successful people have dyslexia? Don't you DARE label yourself damaged goods, you have a brain that doesn't see the same old boring world that the rest of the population sees. This gives you a huge advantage...you're in good company! <br>  <br>  Orlando Bloom, Tom Cruise, Danny Glover, Whoopi Goldberg, Jay Leno, Henry Winkler and Robin Williams are all actors who have dyslexia. (And the guy who plays McDreamy on Grey's...what's his name? He has trouble reading the script, so he memorizes each one.)<br>  <br>  Alexander Graham Bell, Thomas Edison, Albert Einstein, Pierre Curie and Michael Faraday are all famous scientists who were dyslexic. Teachers told Thomas Edison he would never amount to anything. Um...yeah, right.<br>  <br>  Ansel Adams, Leonardo da Vinci, Pablo Picasso and Andy Worhol are all famous dyslexic artists. Man, what a bunch of losers, huh? <br>  <br>  General George S Patton was dyslexic, too. <br>  <br>  OK, let's hit sports....Muhammad Ali, Greg Louganis, Jackie Stewart and Nolan Ryan....all dyslexic.<br>  <br>  Like a previous poster said, Winston Churchill was dyslexic, as was Andrew Jackson, Thomas Jefferson, John F Kennedy, Woodrow Wilson and George Washington. <br>  <br>  So are Scott Adams (Dilbert cartoonist) and Jim Davis (Garfield cartoonist).<br>  <br>  What about Henry Ford, William Hewlett (of Hewlett-Packard fame), Ted Turner (Turner Broadcasting Systems) and Charles Schwab (Finance)? All dyslexic.<br>  <br>  And, of course, Walt Disney.<br>  <br>  "...but I have dyslexia!" Darn straight! So quit trapping yourself in the tiny career box that everyone else is trying to stuff you into and look for things you like to do. Pretend you're already independently wealthy. What would you go do for fun once the party broke up and people went home?|`|ZZep1W8kaa	My friend has dyslexia and he was told at school how he would never get a decent job etc. I'm not joking he now earns ￡50,000 a month.

2646a4e9d6d4e936660d70ff922397f3aa	I think it could have been either one - it just depends on his tone of voice when he said it.  To be honest, if one of my students never had an answer in class but then did well on exams, and then I realized that he was good friends with a star student, I would worry that that student was cheating from his friend.  I would then be very careful to figure out if the good grade on the test was because he had employed some sort of cheating method or if he was just saying "I don't know" in class to avoid standing out in class (and perhaps being picked on by other students).  So while I doubt the teacher was really making fun of you, he may have had more on his mind than just a simple joke.|`|ORonhAuvaa	You r teacher is playing with you.|`|t33FrBA6aa	Playful and friendly.<br>  Some teachers want their students to participate in class, as this makes the class more interesting (not having to listen to a lecture).<br>  It also engages everyone so that perspectives can be maximized, while errors can be caught.<br>  Try being more active in class.

W8F9PboZaa	You could wait 'til you're 21 and apply as a mature age student. <br>  <br>  if I were you I would call the University of Western Sydney. If you're in that area (sutherland, south coast) I'd call University of Wollongong. Not the most prestigious uni but they're really willing to listen to people in these situations. One of my friends got a uai of 56 and was really dissapointed; he was 10 points below the uai cut off for the lowest course he could do and wanted to get into. He rang western sydney, they talked to him and gave him some advice and he's doing electronical design or something. It wasn't his first choice but at least he's in.<br>  <br>  Basically you should just aim to get in. No offense, but with that UAI there is no way you're going to get straight into law. Ok maybe there is a way (through acing a tafe couse or redoing your HSC at tafe and getting at least 88 in that) but it will be very hard. If I were you I'd try to get in with an arts degree or something in the arts or economic faculty. Then you can either transfer after a year (you'd have to get high distinctions in every subject with your uai as they count that as well) OR you could do it postgrad. That is complete an arts degree and then apply for post graduate laws based on your marks throughout the degree. <br>  <br>  But honestly ring the uni's. Usyd, UNSW and UTS probably won't be as sympathetic, they have their pick of whoever they want. But try the others, UWS, UOW, Charles Sturt, Newcastle, ANU, Notre Dame. Just talk to them, they're nice people and willing to help you out. If it's what you really want and are dedicated then they're going to want to give you the benefit of the doubt; there's so many people that do law simply because they got the mark

They were built really quickly and cheaply. The houses were cheap, most had between 2-4 rooms - one or two rooms downstairs, and one or two rooms upstairs. Victorian families were big with 4 or 5 children. There was no running water or toilet. A whole street would have to share an outdoor pump and a couple of outside toilets. Most houses in the North of England were "back to backs" (built in double rows) with no windows at the front, no backyards and a sewer down the middle of the street. The houses were built crammed close together, with very narrow streets between them. Most of the houses were crowded with five or more people possibly crammed into a single room. Even the cellars were full.  Most of the new towns were dirty and unhealthy. The household rubbish was thrown out into the streets. Housing conditions like these were a perfect breeding grounds for diseases. More than 31,000 people died during an outbreak of cholera in 1832 and lots more were killed by typhus, smallpox and dysentery.<br>  Pollution <br>  Chimneys, bridges and factory smoke blocked out most of the light in the towns. A layer of dirty smoke often covered the streets like a blanket. This came from the factories that used steam to power their machines. The steam was made by burning coal to heat water. Burning coal produces a lot of dirty, black smoke. <br>  <br>  Improvements <br>  Gradually, improvements for the poor were made. In 1848, Parliament passed laws that allowed city councils to clean up the streets. One of the first cities to become a healthier place was Birmingham. Proper sewers and drains were built. Land owners had to build houses to a set standard. Streets were paved and lighting was put up. <br>  Over time slums were knocked down and new houses built. However, these changes did not take place overnight. When slums were knocked down in 1875 the poor people had little choice but to move to another slum, making that one worse. Few could afford new housing.
VCc77ZCoaa	Everyone claims that the media is too "liberal," often reporting only one-sided arguments that invariably sway the public towards liberalism because they only get one side of the story.  Now, whether you agree that the media is too liberal or not, Noam Chomsky obviously does.  He is saying that a dictator (a political leader who does not want anyone to disagree with him) would be happy to see that the media coverage in the United States is so skewed that it would be easy to sway the public.  He is basically comparing the US to countries like North Korea where the media is so completely controlled by political leaders that they control the information the public gets to see.

The closest you can get would probably an emulator, which, while not online, allows you to use your calculator on the computer.<br>  <br>  Emulators (such as VTI or TiLem) can be downloaded below:<br>  <a href="http://www.ticalc.org/archives/files/fileinfo/84/8442.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.ticalc.org/archives/files/fil...</a><br>  <a href="http://www.ticalc.org/archives/files/fileinfo/372/37211.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.ticalc.org/archives/files/fil...</a><br>  <br>  In order to make the emulators work you'll need a ROM image, which you can obtain with certain transferring software by taking an image of your calculator's ROM. However, note that it is illegal to distribute, sell, or give away ROM images. Thus, the calculator you are trying to emulate must officially be yours.
25mllixyaa	It's alright to be shy sometimes, but there are times when you should be outgoing. Usually the best way to make friends is by making someone laugh. Just start with making one friend, the rest will grow from there.|`|Cl6dMZ6Iaa	Everyone gets shy. The first day is always going to be nerve wracking but just think loads of people around the world are going to go through what ur going. Also to start off a conversation just go hey! or something lol. Then like as time goes by you'll know who u want to be friends with and just sit with them and then just add in conversation whenever u think is right. You'll settle in and yeah. Just call someone a FCKAN M0LE! That always works HAHA.<br>  x

Explain the reasons why you want to go: make new friends, better environment for you to learn (maybe, lol), do better in your courses, think you'll try harder and be more enthusiastic about school since you actually want to go there.|`|gw0UzZg3aa	i would do some more info on the public school<br>  like maybe some things the public school has tht ur private school doesnt and use tht as examples<br>  and keep asking in a polite non-annoying way so the parents see tht she is still very interested without gettin over the top and annoying<br>  good luck!|`|LZgVsIpKaa	Show them and prove to them that you are responsible. <br>  <br>  Do some bigger chores, do the shopping, look after your little brother while your parents go out, whatever!<br>  <br>  Then they will at least THINK you are responsible enough to go to a bigger school and look after yourselves. :)|`|EDMAqIcBaa	why would you want to?<br>  a private school is much better than a public one<br>  maybe you should just be grateful for what you have<br>  its probably not trust its that they want to pay for you to have a better education|`|f0039b6c9615871ed1c0196833907a34aa	tell them you are responsible enough :)|`|J9pbhleBaa	Pray for God's will to be done|`|xOqefUvtaa	Why wont they trust her? <br>  <br>  Compose a list of good points for her parents that say why public school is better. You could say that it's free. Are the classrooms bigger or smaller? Are there more courses to take? Reputation of the teachers good? Does the school help out a lot of communities, etc? What's the drop out rate vs the private / public schools... ummm, and maybe say that schooling in a public environment might be more culturally diverse for her which will add to her experience of persons she may've not met in a private (smaller?) school. <br>  <br>  Think about clubs and extra-curriculars too. Public school more involved in music, arts, sports, theater? Maybe they offer something that the private school doesn't and she is seriously interested in.|`|rkIzOGXYaa	i dunno much of this but have you tried noting down all the plus points about going to a public school and keeping it at the bedside when yr parents are about to sleep? believe me it may seem kiddish but it realy works (at least in my case!)<br>  don forget to write "please!" at the end of yr note, lol.<br>  good luck|`|ZOHBGHMiaa	well get some information about the school like how well the education there and you can get scholarships by colleges and just tell that its time for me to open up and see how the world is out side of the private school|`|QUKc25Fcaa	all u have to do is say u dont have to pay....<br>  cause private schools u have to pay something, public u DONT have to pay a penny.|`|LbwpUA1caa	Tell your friend to be responsible and respectful.

ZTc7rE1Haa	I've heard it all now! The exams were too difficult, so they dumbed them down and now everyone gets about 11 A* grades. Now we hear that the poor darlings find it too difficult to stay awake, so the proposal is to start school at eleven. What about taking the playstations and computers away and making them go to bed at a reasonable hour? If they start school at eleven o'clock then break for an hour's lunch at noon, there won't be much of the day left. If I had my way, the school day would be longer, there would be discipline and lessons in English spelling and grammar.|`|m40Hh4a1aa	DUDE.

Can't see it ever happening though|`|AjqO1aJgaa	(Snorts) Most of the most successful teenagers in the country have already done two hours sport or music before they start school at 9! So I guess it might help our future Olympic athletes - they'll have an extra two hours to train before school.<br>  <br>  The chronically idle? They're a waste of space anyway. It's past time we stopped catering to the lowest denominator, and told some of these kids that if they want to be thick and ignorant they can stay that way instead of using up resources which would be better spent on people who want to learn.|`|b1znvwnJaa	Awwwwh, wish that happend at my school! =(

Ftkr9jqYaa	Based upon this editorial, it appears that Bert Hofman of the World Bank has performed relatively diligent investigation of corruption within the Phillipine government, only to be deprecated by Phillipine politicians.  As indicated, financial markets are severely constricted today, and additional World Bank funds could greatly benefit the Phillipines.  Therefore, at least a cursory effort should be made to expose the malfeasors, and administer sanctions to discourage such misconduct.

QMbaeva9aa	Well, if this is an undergrad degree and you plan on getting a masters in the future, it's not going to matter much where you go as long as the uni is right for you. <br>  <br>  I don't know much about MDIS, but from the name it seems to be a good choice... On the site, it says they award a diploma, not a degree, so you can't use it to get into NTU or NUS or some other Singapore university after you graduate. This might be something to consider.<br>  <br>  I think NTU is more well known for engineering and sciences in general, not sure about mass communication.<br>  <br>  Do some more research about the schools themselves. I believe MDIS is not a typical "university" - no housing? NTU would provide a more traditional university experience.<br>  <br>  Hope that helps.|`|I5omUBnRaa	NTU is a public university, while MDIS is a non-profit organisation providing private education. In Singapore's context, a "safer" choice would be to go for a degree offered by a public university, if you can qualify for entry.
xrTOhysRaa	Well, you know one of those points is (0,0). You also know that one of those points are (7pi/4, 0). You will cut the period in half for the very middle point, so that point will be (7pi/8, 0). Then you will just figure out the other points by finding the midpoint of (0,0) and (7pi/8) and also the midpoint of (7pi/8) and (7pi/4). Don't forget to make the y coordinate 1 or -1 (for the amplitude). <br>  <br>  Your five key points: (0,0) (7pi/16, 1) (7pi/8, 0) (21pi/16, -1) (7pi/4, 0)<br>  <br>  I'm pretty sure that's right, I can't be sure unless I have the equation.

If the teacher is old and stupid they don't notice which makes it even funnier<br>  <br>  Another thing my friends and I do is we begin to say something (like math problem or sentence)<br>  <br>  Ex: "you change the -10 to a (15 second long pause) positive 10<br>  <br>  See u then act after the pause as if nothing happened <br>  <br>  If u want to risk getting in trouble u can even attempt to walk to the bathroom and back during the pause|`|bImlg171aa	Get everyone in the class to sit in the wrong seats....then when the teacher takes roll call, make up a ridiculous name you go by.

Ask him how he's doing, how his family is, keep it light and joke around here and there. <br>  <br>  Another good way to get talking is to ask him a general math question, or an other kind of school-related question.

zgTsCicNaa	The Midwich Cuckoos is a science fiction novel written by English author John Wyndham, published in 1957. It has been filmed twice as Village of the Damned.<br>  <br>  The novel is set largely within the eponymous Midwich, Winshire, a typical small English village. A series of incidents near the village establishes that anybody who passes a certain boundary line while approaching the village falls instantly unconscious; this effect extends completely around a two miles radius of Midwich (thus affecting all of its inhabitants), with the unconsciousness vanishing as soon as a person re-crosses the boundary. Experimentation rules out any chemical or biological effect, while aerial photography reveals a peculiar silver object on the ground in the village itself. Police officers outside the boundary line use a canary in a cage to deduce the size and shape of the line, finding it to be perfectly circular, and, after further investigation, the shape of a hemisphere.<br>  <br>  After a period of one day the effect vanishes, along with the object. The villagers wake, apparently with no ill-effects. Some months later a follow-up study reveals that every woman of child-bearing age is pregnant, with all indications that the pregnancies were initiated on the "Dayout."<br>  <br>  When the children are born they appear normal, except that they all have blonde hair and unusual golden eyes, and their hair strands have one flat edge, rather like the letter "D." They also have very pale, almost silver, skin. There are sixty-one children resulting from the "Dayout" pregnancies: thirty-one boys and thirty girls. It is revealed that there were supposed to be equal numbers of males and females (with a total of sixty-two children), but one woman in the village had already been pregnant at the time of the "Dayout" and so was unable to be inseminated - this resulted in only thirty females. Later, one male and two females die of illnesses.<br>  <br>  These children have none of the genetic characteristics of their parents. As they grow up, it becomes increasingly apparent that they are, at least in some respects, not human. They possess telepathic abilities, including the ability to psychically force their will on others and control their actions and organs and other parts of the body. Also, they share two distinct group minds, one for the boys, and one for the girls. When one boy learns something, all of the other boys learn that, but the girls do not learn what the boys learn. When a girl learns something, all other girls learn that as well. The children, who are now referred to with a capital "C", have accelerated growth, so when they are nine they look sixteen. The Children want to protect themselves as much as possible. One young boy accidentally hit a Child in the hip while driving. The Children then made the boy drive into a wall. A bull who chased the Children got sent by the Children into a pond to drown. The villagers, obviously angry at the Children, form a mob and try to burn down the Midwich Grange, where the Children are taught and live. It was no use, as the Children made the villagers attack themselves.<br>  <br>  The Military Intelligence department learn that the same thing has taken place in four other parts of the world, including an Inuit settlement in the Canadian Arctic, a cattle station in Australia's Northern Territory, and a rural Siberian village. The Inuit instinctively killed the newborn Children, sensing they were not their own. The Australian babies had all died within a few weeks, suggesting that something may have gone wrong with their insemination process. At the border of Mongolia in Russia, it was assumed that the women were having affairs with devils, and all women and Children perished. In Siberia, the village was destroyed by the Soviet government, using long-range artillery, claiming it was an accident.<br>  <br>  The Children are aware of the threat against them, and use their power to prevent any aeroplanes from flying over the village. During an interview with an M. I.(Military Intelligence) officer , the Children explain that to solve the problem they must be destroyed. They explain it is not possible to kill them unless the entire village is bombed, which results in civilian deaths. It is revealed that the Children have put up an ultimatum. The Children want to migrate to a deserted island, where they can live unharmed. They demand aeroplanes from the government. An elderly Midwich citizen (Gordon Zellaby) realizes the Children must be killed as soon as possible. As he has a few weeks to live due to a heart condition, he feels an obligation to do something. So, one evening, he hides a bomb in his projection equipment, while showing the Children a film about Ancient Greece. At an unspecified moment, Zellaby sets off the bomb, killing the Children, and himself.<br>  <br>  The title is a reference to the cuckoo bird, which lays its eggs in the nest of other birds in the hopes that they will raise the cuckoo's offspring as their own.<br>  <br>  (The Children of the Damned was an adaption of this. The six children are born from all around the world—China, the Soviet Union, India, Nigeria, the USA and the UK.)<br>  <br>  ?|`|Y1iYQJvWaa	Children of the Damned <br>  me thinks|`|3OoCiOkAaa	Village of the Damned made in 1960 and then remade in 1995<br>  <br>  <br>  A follow up was made to the village of the damned it was called children of the damned made in 1963.<br>  <br>  I have the DVD's of all of them<br>  <br>  Here is the 1960s version- including the children of the damned:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/Village-Damned-Children-DVD/dp/B000G6BMLY/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&s=dvd&qid=1236516260&sr=8-1" rel="nofollow">http://www.amazon.co.uk/Village-Damned-C...</a><br>  <br>  <br>  Here is the 1990s version:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/Village-Damned-DVD-Christopher-Reeve/dp/B00004WZYJ/ref=sr_1_2?ie=UTF8&s=dvd&qid=1236516260&sr=8-2" rel="nofollow">http://www.amazon.co.uk/Village-Damned-D...</a>|`|N8WDdQ9yaa	is it 'the village of the dammed'? or what adolf hitler intended for us had they (nazis) won the war?|`|28667a2fab4e406f52bfe94a34c859cbaa	yep i agree village of the damned

fsxNN9Xzaa	Well, sometimes colleges check up on their students. When they accepted you, they took into consideration the fact that you're taking on the heavy workload that AP classes give you.<br>  <br>  Really, you should be reporting the drastic changes to colleges anyway. The ones that have yet to accept or reject you are going to be making their decision with the fact that you're taking that AP class in mind.<br>  <br>  Besides, there are little more than 2 months before the AP Exams. Why quit now? 2 months, and that's it. You've already lasted through 6 months. Another 2 couldn't hurt. Especially considering that a week or two typically goes to reviewing for the Exam. Why do all of that work if you don't even take the chance to get college credits?|`|1505a95e660275609c4bb43c388cdf1aaa	It might.  Colleges ask for a transcript at the end of your year to make sure you graduated and didn't slack off.  If they based their decision to admit you off that course in some way, that could make them change their minds, but that's not too likely.

For the grads I know, other parents at my son's private school, it has been worth it in their opinions. And actually, you may be able to get financial aid to lower the cost quite a bit. The net cost of college was often actually more in the past, before this time of generous financial aid.<br>  <br>  Having talent is not enough. There are a zillion talented artists out there. You need a good foundation, education, opportunity, and the ability to self promote. There is a lot of snobism in buying art. Buyers do look at the backgrounds of artist, which is why on gallery websites you will find the artists' resumes including education. People don't trust their taste, or the gallery owner, a good education can give validity to good art. I buy what I like and not for an investment, but many/most buy for investment where pieces over a thousand dollars are concerned. Some even less! <br>  <br>  You could possibly become better at a community college -- it really depends quite a bit on the instructor -- but find out where those student artists are now. <br>  <br>  If you do not receive enough aid to where you think Art College is worth it, look into a good art program at a local university, unless there is a remarkable art teacher at the community college.<br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|DVbQAbjsaa	its definitely worth going to art college. but that does seem very expensive. you need the other interaction of other art students. its a brilliant experience. i went to art school and do not regret it. it's great|`|12VQ4ETcaa	I know two people who went to art school.

coqTBB6baa	You can earn more money with being a dentist and then you can easily become a gp later on if you change your mind.<br>  I guess the answer why anyone wants to be a dentist is: because I can earn lots of money and I do enjoy being in other people's mouth. That is a job that someone has to do not to mention that for those who have real toothache ....well you just save their lives. Believe me I have just got over a root therapy.... :D:D<br>  <br>  The other thing is as far as I know (and it seems to me that others had the same answer) your fieldwork doesnt determine your career. <br>  <br>  Being a dentist pays better i guess... and if you change your mind you can make ends meet easier if you already have a profession ...<br>  <br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|uu22BItnaa	i have answered too many questions like this, wat u do 4 ur work experience doesnt mean that u have to do that 4 ur career, medical schools know that its tough to get WE, instead do some voluntary work 4 a charity like hospice|`|Qeor2wKLaa	Where you do your work experience will have no real influence on your final career.<br>  <br>  I suggest you ask your work experience co ordinator in school for advice on this.|`|9P0ktEbkaa	You said you wanted to save lives, but being a dentist does not really do that.

It's just to give you an idea of what working is like. It has NOTHING to do with your future career! Just make sure you enjoy it whatever you do.<br>  <br>   You won't need to justify WHY you want to be a doctor or dentist, after 7 years of training they'll understand how serious you are!<br>  <br>   There are a few careers sites online that give you an idea of what's expected. For now, concentrate on your science subjects at school, they'll be the ones you'll need to get that type of job.|`|VG2X9Ihkaa	Hey,<br>  <br>  Are you confused about what profession to pick i.e. GP or Dentistry.  Well, if you go for dentistry and they ask you why you want to do it?  The answer is simple:<br>  <br>  For a healthy body, teeth are important.  We use teeth to chow our food and if the teeth are crooked then it will affect a person's health.  (and of course you will make loads and loads of money... lol<br>  <br>  To become a doctor, your MBBS is 5 years and Dentistry is 5 - 6 years.<br>  <br>  It is okay if you choose one and don't like it, you can always change.  Lot of people change there profession.  I changed mine from IT to now Counselling.<br>  <br>  I hope this answer helps you a bit.
AA12299134	Get a good night's sleep the night before.<br>  <br>  Drink some water as this helps you think clearly and remember.<br>  <br>  Have a revision plan for weeks and maybe a couple of months before your actual exam, then you will be organised, and have it spread out over a period of time, rather than having to cram it all in, in the last week.<br>  <br>  Revise with one other person and help eachother.<br>  <br>  Get somebody to test you regularly.<br>  <br>  Work out which things you find harder, and revise them more.  Start the day revising something you find difficult, and then 'reward' yourself with something easier later on in the day.<br>  <br>  Always remember examples of things you studied (ie, experiments if you are a scientist, statistics, events in history) as this illustrates the points you make in exams.<br>  <br>  Think positively about exams.  So many people build up a fear mentality about them but there isn't really the need.  Take away the fear and revision becomes a lot easier:<br>  <br>  *  Examiners' jobs are to AWARD marks rather than trip you up.  They start at 0 and add marks on.<br>  *  Questions are phrased so that you can finish them in an allotted time.<br>  *  Questions are also phrased so as to avoid misunderstanding.<br>  *  Do practice questions so that you get used to the type of things which may be asked, and so that you get your exam 'technique' and timing right.  It will also help you to erradicate what you struggle on and get better.<br>  <br>  Do it!  Getting started is the hardest thing, but once you get going you find that things flow.|`|uu22BItnaa	being realistic about what you have to do, dont just say "ah il read 50 pages on monday" and u end up doing nothing, dont plan, jus do it just revise, dont make it seem as if it is a punishment or else u will think of things which will distract u e.g. TV or ur favourite show or sumink, , and other thing once u have done some revision write down what u did and how u feel about being tested on it, if u comfortable iwth it just write a couple of notes, if not do it again|`|RlHW1G4Uaa	plan exactly what you want to do each day, like "highlight and summarise chapter 3" or "exercise 4E questions 1-10" or something<br>  and then make SURE you do it<br>  <br>  i also make a study timetable leading up to exam time and plan what i'm studying like 2 weeks in advance, nerdy i know but it works|`|AA10047095	i kept rewriting out my notes, then highlighting the most important. i'd do a roiugh copy then i'd rewrite them again in good quality paper neatly, this helped me retain the information.   <br>  <br>  also made up poems to remember big secctions which trigger words could help me with.<br>  <br>  also lots of coffee breaks help, also cakes are awsome study aid.   <br>  <br>  hope this helps.|`|DsszxGT6aa	I stick little notes on places i look at all the time. like the fridge or my bedroom wall.

English will be a walk in the park compared to medicine. <br>  <br>   There are other less daunting routes that involve medical disciplines: Pharmacy, bio-medicinal chemistry, health sciences, etc as well as a whole host of degrees that mix up aspects of medicine, health and human biology.<br>  <br>   Again, taking one of these degrees doesn't committ you to a lifetime in the lab!

bGyR9yUfaa	The tea party caused a crisis. Hutchinson had been urging London to take a hard line with the Sons of Liberty. If he had done what the other royal governors had done and let the ship owners and captains resolve the issue with the colonists, the Dartmouth, Eleanor, the "William" and the Beaver would have left without unloading any tea. Lord North said that if the colonists had stuck with nonimportation for another six months the tea tax would have been repealed. In February, 1775, Britain passed the Conciliatory Resolution which ended taxation for any colony which satisfactorily provided for the imperial defense and the upkeep of imperial officers. The Tea Act was repealed with the Taxation of Colonies Act 1778.<br>  <br>  In Britain, even those politicians considered friends of the colonies were appalled and this act united all parties there against the colonies. The Prime Minister Lord North said, "Whatever may be the consequence, we must risk something; if we do not, all is over". The British government felt this was an action which could not be unpunished and responded by closing the port of Boston and put in place other laws known as the "Coercive Acts".<br>  <br>  In the colonies, Benjamin Franklin stated that the destroyed tea must be repaid, all 90,000 pounds. Robert Murray, a New York merchant went to Lord North with three other merchants and offered to pay for the losses, but the offer was turned down. A number of colonists were inspired to carry out similar acts, such as the burning of the Peggy Stewart. The Boston Tea Party eventually proved to be one of the many reactions which led to the American Revolutionary War. At the very least, the Boston Tea Party and the reaction that followed served to rally support for revolutionaries in the thirteen colonies who were eventually successful in their fight for independence.<br>  <br>  Many colonists, in Boston and elsewhere in the country, pledged to abstain from tea drinking as a protest, turning instead to "liberty tea" (made from raspberry leaves), other herbal infusions, and coffee. This social protest movement away from tea drinking, however, was not long-lived.|`|b1eacc63c481ff40082f035f83d011d1aa	um, added sugar and stirred?|`|Y4RS35M7aa	They cancelled the Tea Tax and the Stamp Tax.|`|x9tYy7ivaa	The Boston Tea Party came first.  Neither the colonists nor the British people were happy.  Ben Franklin then wanted to pay for the destroyed tea himself, he was so upset.  In recent years, the Tea Party was named the Tea Party.  It used to be called the Destruction of the Tea.

FLAtdWrmaa	Go do a search in Y!A for resolved questions on this topic.  You'll find everything you need there.<br>  <br>  Here's what I replied to another questioner, who had asked:  "Why would any woman want to get an abortion?"  He went on to explain that he'd recently read a particular book which outlined the anti-abortion case so persuasively ( he thought) that he couldn't figure out any logic at all for allowing abortions.<br>  <br>  "You're male, aren't you?<br>  <br>  "Why would any woman want to go through pregnancy and childbirth? Never mind child-rearing.<br>  <br>  "Do you believe everything you read? Maybe you ought to broaden your literary explorations. Try reading some books whose premises you don't automatically agree with. Then read some that you automatically disagree with. Try reading such books with an open mind. If you don't or can't manage that, then it's a clear sign that your own beliefs aren't based on a strong enough foundation to withstand such a challenge, that is, to answer the most difficult questions of faith honestly. Your beliefs may need to adapt. That's called growth, and every truly Godly person does it.<br>  <br>  "But then, I'm a born-again cynic, and I don't believe there are very many truly Godly people at all. Too much "religion" has become a power-game (as with the abortion question), and too little maturity is allowed to occur wherever this is so.<br>  <br>  "Just remember one thing, please: if NOT having abortions is a religious choice you are free to make, then HAVING abortions is also a religious choice, which other people should have the (religious) freedom to make.<br>  <br>  "Maybe you believe that the soul is imbued into new life at the moment of conception: you could be right. But others believe that the soul enters the embryo at the moment of implantation in the wall of the mother's womb. And they could be right, instead of you. Others believe that the soul enters the baby at the moment of birth, or at the moment a newborn takes its first independent breath, or somewhere halfway through pregnancy, or, or, or. Can you prove that any and all of these people are wrong? Really?<br>  <br>  "The only thing society has unequivocally agreed on is that once a baby is breathing, then causing its death is murder. Abortion will always be a gray area, morally speaking (gray for SOCIETY, that is, not for individuals who have firm beliefs in the question). In a society that values freedom of conscience, that gray area *must* be respected.<br>  <br>  "Are you able to do that? Because if you're not, you will never have an answer to your question. And your personal faith will always be suspect."|`|onzhurVNaa	For<br>  Mother may be too young or unable to provide the child with a good life. <br>  Rape incidents, can cause too much emotional pain for the mother to carry the bearing of the child. <br>  If child has a disability, mother may be unable to offer the care for the child and may believe it is in the best interest for the child then to allow them to go through life struglling and not having the same abilities as the other children.<br>  <br>  Against<br>  Against civil rights, in humane<br>  Every woman has the choice to put their baby up for adoption to give it a better life once it has been born<br>  In late abortion, the baby has started to develop and therefore can feel pain<br>  <br>  Just a few things  I thought up, hope it helped a bit

AA11770802	Public Law 107 -110, which is more commonly known as "No Child Left Behind" is a law that President Bush put into effect in 2001 that states that all states have to make standards and then test their children to make sure that they are learning those standards. The law also states that each year, more and more children have to pass the tests, until in 2014 when ALL children will be passing. Every year that schools don’t raise the number of students who pass the tests in all of 48 different subgroups, the school is labeled as "failing" and will be greatly penalized.<br>  <br>  For most people the name of the law, and the idea that all children are expected to pass the tests sounds like a wonderful idea. In reality there are good things that are part of the law, but they are either overshadowed by the bad things, or the way the the law is implemented. For example, part of the law is mandatory help for children who are not on grade level. Access to remedial tutoring is mandatory for children who are not making the grade. That is a good point. Sadly, the law doesn’t allow for the funds and time to do this, so many schools are now taking time out of their day to have the teachers teach the tutoring classes, which means that now there is less time for the teachers to teach the core curriculum. Subjects like history, science, social studies and geography which aren't tested have all but disappeared from most schools.<br>  <br>  What’s even more frustrating is that the more a school fails, the more sanctions are placed on it. You will hear some people state that failing schools “get money thrown at them” and it may appear as that to the outside eye, but in reality it is a curse, not a blessing. You see that money comes with ridiculously strong ties. Failing schools are forced to use scripted programs. The extra money they receive is only for these programs and for people to ensure that the program is being followed exactly.<br>  <br>  You might say to yourself like marina does, “Well, if the school is failing, it is because the teachers don’t know how to teach and so giving them a script to follow will ensure that some form of decent education is getting to the children.” I would agree, if that was truly the case, but you see there are many reasons why schools are failing and often it has more to do with problems outside the school than inside.<br>  <br>  Now before you write me off as someone who is just making excuses, I need to state that I do believe that most, if not all, children can learn. The problem is that they are different, and have different needs. As a teacher I need to be able to adapt my curriculum for those needs. For example, I teach in an extremely poor area. Many of my children do not have beds. They don’t even have mattresses or pajamas. So when we read a story about a child putting on his pajamas and going to bed, unless I pre-teach, (go over what a bed and pajamas are befor reading the text), my students won’t understand the story. Yet the scripted program does not allow for this. If I am pre-teaching and one of the “coaches” comes into my classroom, I will be written up for “non-compliance with the core curriculum.”<br>  <br>  I could go on, but YA will cut me off. If you want more information or examples, contact me and/or access my website:<br>  <br>  The bottom of this page explains my opinions in greater detail: <a href="http://www.montessorianswers.com/faq.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.montessorianswers.com/faq.htm...</a><br>  <br>  The top of this page gives links to a myriad of articles on NCLB<br>  <a href="http://www.montessorianswers.com/-education-articles.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.montessorianswers.com/-educat...</a>|`|AA11558459	From Wikipedia:<br>  <br>  "The Act requires states to develop assessments in basic skills to be given to all students in certain grades, if those states are to receive federal funding for schools....standards are set by each individual state..."<br>  <br>  "The Act also requires that the schools distribute the name, home phone number and address of every student enrolled to military recruiters and institutions of higher education, unless the student (or the student's parent) specifically opts out."<br>  <br>  So if you want federal money for your school, you have to get your students to pass tests.  I don't like this, because I think that most of the time, the schools that need the most money, will have the most trouble passing the tests, and that if they got the money, their students would be able to pass tests with higher marks because they would have access to better materials and, hopefully, they would have better teachers with more money in their school.  I never knew about that second part.

And even if another class, like Journalism, fulfills the requirment but you take English, it doesn't mean you can't still take Journalism for an elective credit.

SN7NfjPyaa	Honestly, don't make those decisions right now.<br>  When you get to college, you will only have to take all your classes over again.  <br>  In High School I had 6 different math classes and after a placement test guess what, I once again have to take at least 4 math classes, 4 English classes, and 4 "humanities" before I can really get started on my major.  Or at least I can get started on my major but I still need to take care of those other High School type classes.<br>  <br>  Ive changed my major three times since I have started High School.  One of those times was in College when I figured out High School Chemistry is totally different then College Chemistry.<br>  <br>  <br>  If I could suggest one last thing, instead of worrying about what you want to do with your life, maybe replace it with looking around for random scholarships.

You're still young, you're in a dependent position, and from what you say, your mom has let you down.<br>  <br>  One solution might be to do the record keeping work yourself.  You don't need an external company to track your time, although that is an easier (but costlier) way to do so.<br>  <br>  If you have log books of the time you've spent on your studies, you can enter it all onto sheets of gridded paper (should be available at local stores that stock stationery), one per month.  Take the totals for each subject and add them up on separate subject sheets, along with short descriptions of what you did and the materials/texts that you used.  This constitutes the raw material for writing a transcript.<br>  <br>  Your choices for what to do next could be:<br>  -- take this information to your local school and ask if the guidance counselor can help you to:<br>  ** talk your mom into enrolling you in school (since you'll need her signatures, etc.)<br>  ** arrange placement tests to document your learning<br>  ** arrange the classes you need<br>  <br>  -- continue your homeschooling and do your record keeping yourself<br>  -- read The Teenage Liberation Handbook and Real Lives:  Eleven Teenagers Who Don't Go to School Tell Their Own Stories<br>  <br>  (reading the books would be helpful regardless)<br>  <br>  Whatever you do, it is likely to be hard work and you'll have to be determined and your own advocate.

i5tOQGgFaa	The zoo theme would be a great theme for this age as well as for you...if you haven't had a lot of experience in planning.  There are MANY MANY ideas on the web.  Search zoo and preschool.<br>  <br>  Snack:  <br>  *  Spreading a graham cracker with pb (if no allergies) and letting them put animal crackers on top to make a zoo train.<br>  * animal crackers and juice but first talk about what animals they have the sounds they make, even the movements, you can make simple patterns, you can count how many of each, you can sort, etc.<br>  *  Animal Cinnamon Toast:  Use animal cookie cutters to cut the toast and have the kids spread with butter and sprinkle with cinnamon sugar mixture...they love to mix their own cinnamon and sugar as well.<br>  <br>  Activity:<br>  *  This song is great to teach in sign language.<br>  Zoo Tune <br>  Tune:  My Bonnie Lies Over the Ocean<br>  I came to the zoo to see lions,<br>  Elephants, tigers, and bears.<br>  I came to the zoo to see zebras.<br>  I love all the animals there!<br>  <br>  Lions, tigers,<br>  Elephants, zebras, and bears,<br>  Lions, tigers,<br>  Elephant zebras, and bears.<br>  <br>  *  Animal Hunt:  Hide pictures of zoo animals around the room-at least one for each child.  When you say, “Go.” Have the children search the room for pictures.  When a child finds one, he should pick it up and come back to the circle time area.  Have each child turn his picture over and put it behind him.  Call on each child to pretend to be his animal.  Others should call out what the animal is.<br>  ?Have children tell you as much as they can about that animal and write it on the back of the animal.  As they learn more about it throughout the week add to the list.<br>  <br>  *Animal Walk- Played like Simon Says--the zookeeper may say, "Walk like an elephant." The students walk like they believe that particular animal walks. Use animals such as giraffes, monkeys, lions, tigers, bears, etc.<br>  <br>  * Match zoo babies to mother.  After the initial activity, you can make a peek a boo board, which this age loves so much.  Put the baby or mother on a top flap and the opposite underneath.<br>  <br>  *  Which One Doesn’t Belong?  Say a series of words all but one of which are zoo animals, such as “elephant, monkey, box, lion, seal.”  Then say to the children, “Which one doesn’t belong?”  The children call out the non-animal word, in this case, “box.”  Continue with different series of words.For word recognition:  create pictures with their labels and use for this activity.<br>  <br>  *  Follow the Leader:  Have the children line-up behind you.  Start walking like an elephant.  They should follow you all pretending to be elephants.  Change to another animal and let the children keep copying you.  (Penguin, snake, monkey, gorilla, bat, etc.) This is actually an activity that promotes literacy!  Children have to be able to copy things with their body before they are going to be able to copy/write letters, numbers, and etc.<br>  <br>  Art/craft: Remember that open-ended art is the best bet for this age.<br>  *  Zoo printing- a lot of cookie cutters available in zoo animals.  They can dip in paint and press onto their own individual papers or a large group paper.<br>  *  Zoo collage- pictures of zoo animals (the glossy magazine pictures are the best), the older ones can cut them out themselves...you can have some available for the younger ones.  <br>  * On the same note, each child can be given a piece of paper to be used as a train "car".  Yellow is nice.  They glue on an animal and then glue on black cage strips.  Then you can write with them the name of the animal, print concept, and put them all up on the wall to make a long zoo train.<br>  *  Paint tp tubes either different colors or shades of snake colors (browns, greens).  Each child can do one or more and then they can be attached together with yarn, make a head and you have a long snake.  Use for group counting.  Toddlers will also enjoy pulling it around the room.<br>  <br>  <br>  Much more out there!  **** luck.|`|buUIYQPCaa	These would be fun themes for little ones!  For your healthy snack, you could make ants on a log (peanut butter and raisins on celery sticks), or let the children use animal shaped cookie cutters to cut shapes out of slices of American cheese to put on crackers and eat.  You have to be cautious with peanut butter in case there are allergies in the group.  For a craft, let them draw animal faces on paper plates and glue on yarn or shredded paper hair, then you cut out eyes and mouth to make masks.  Remember, it doesn't matter if it looks like an animal to you!  If the child says it's a monkey, or a tiger, then that's what it is!  Or you could let them draw their version of their favorite animal, then cut it out and glue on craft sticks to make puppets.  Choose a story with animals in it and let them make the animals so they can use their puppets to help you tell the story, or wear their masks to have an animal parade.|`|KQJPWWjeaa	Art:  marble painting Tigers.

You can then glue the zebra on paper and have the children use twigs, leaves, etc.  to make a zebra habitat <br>  Activities: Match the Bow Tie-Copy five penguin designs. Make each penguin have different color shoes. Next make 5 bow ties that are the same color as the shoes. Let the kids match the bow ties with the penguin it belongs to<br>  Feed the Elephant-Make an elephant buy painting and decorating a box. Cut out a mouth hole and let your children throw peanuts (still in the hull) into the elephants mouth to feed the elephant.  Again make sure no one is allergic to peanuts.  You could also cut out foam shaped peanuts to throw.

sNqi1fLPaa	Ok i read the whole thing(whew). And from an objective standpoint I think that you are totally wrong and over reacting. Ok so the teachers may not have handled it the way that you wanted them to. I often find that teenagers think that they have the right to have things go their way and what you fail to realize is that your school has authority over you. YOU are under 18 and must abide by their rules. You had the audacity to walk into school and not go to the principals office and show them your note. Instead you showed it to the security guard and your teachers. Sorry hun, but if my daughter is going to miss school, I have to go to the attendance office, not her teacher. Your librarian clearly told you to go to the attendance office, and you choose not to. And your excuse is that since you were not hassled by security, you thought it was not big deal. You were told something, you didnt do it, and they have every right to suspend you. You are a minor, you have no rights in the school system. Your complaint will not hold up in a court of law, you didnt abide by their rules and they have authority over you. And if you admit to hearing what they told you to do, and choose not to do it, then you will look even more foolish. So suck it up honey and realize that you were WRONG. And stop acting like a spoiled self righteous teenager who thinks they know everything. You cannot always have your own way. Go back to school and get over it.

If you are looking at the experience of college for the social aspects ie: partying you will only end up disappointed as you will be signing up for a HUGE amount of debt to try out a social setting that won't move you any closer to you area of interest for a career!

yGOmMQP7aa	The FAFSA stands for "Free Application for Federal Student Loans" and is the application for federal and state financial aid.  Stafford loans are a federal loan you can get without a cosigner and have a fixed interest rate of 6%.  If your family is considered poor, you can get Subsidized Stafford loans.  This means the government pays the interest accumulated while you are in school.  Unsubsidized loans the government does not pay the interest while you are in school.  <br>  Perkins loans are prob the best federal loan to get because they have the best interest rate and are also subsidized.  If you HAVE to take out loans this the order you want to take them out in... the first is the best.<br>  1. Perkins<br>  2. Subsidized Stafford<br>  3. Unsubsidized Stafford <br>  <br>  Never ever ever resort to private student loans, they have variable interest rates, require a cosigner, and if something were to happen, like you died or became disabled, your cosigner would STILL have to pay back those loans.<br>  <br>  This is a great publication on the different types of loans, the interest rates and the max amounts you can borrow.  Good luck.|`|12VQ4ETcaa	The FAFSA is an application for financial aid.  After you fill it out, the financial aid office at the school where you applied will offer you a financial aid package that might include a Stafford loan and/or a Perkins loan.  I got both, but a year or so ago my former school discontinued the Perkins loan program.<br>  <br>  You might also get grants and fee waivers from the school.  The financial aid package would also include work study, which is the opportunity to apply for and work at a work study job.  You don't have to take work study if you find a better job elsewhere.<br>  <br>  If you apply to and are accepted by more than one school, they will each offer you a different aid package.|`|nIhpbHRDaa	Students and parents who must deal with the high cost of a college education have available to them a wide range of student loans. This article offers details on three general types of student loans. Unlike other student loans, application for a specific Stafford Loan should be preceded by the filing of a Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA). The FAFSA application should be made in the name of the aspiring student.  <br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.worldbestloans.com/student-loans.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.worldbestloans.com/student-lo...</a><br>  <br>  Like some other student loans, application for the Signature Loan permits the use of a co-signer.

I'm going to be taking the Spanish AP exam this spring, and i know that for the speaking you use a tape recorder & then send in the tape to the AP grading people... i think they would do the same for AP French.<br>  <br>  so you take an AP class all year long (an AP class is supposedly a college level class that you can take while youre in high school; there are a whole host of AP classes total, but your school's not going to offer all of them, just a few cuz they need teachers to teach the AP classes) & then in May you take the AP exam for that subject (or you could just take a regular class & take the AP exam anyways if your school doesnt offer AP classes in the subject you want).  your school should have forms for you to sign up for the exam (really easy, you just write down the subjects in which you want to take APs)  & you also have to pay per test.  Our school's making us pay $86.00 per test (yeesh!). i dont know if different schools charge different money per test though.... when you sign up for the exam, you see what day & time (morning or afternoon) it's going to be on & you'll take the exam in school on that day with other students from your school who are taking it.    all exams are 3 hrs long.   <br>  <br>  oh, the grading scale (shows how well you do): it goes 1-5, a five is the best score.  you never actually find out what problems you got right/wrong, etc.  they just send you your final score in an envelope in the beginning of july or so (yeah, it takes a while for them to grade everything)<br>  <br>  taking AP classes/ exams will look good (smart, hardworking, driven, etc.)  when applying to college.  If you do well on the exam (a five or maybe a 4) some colleges will accept that as a college credit (like, you wont have to take that class as a prerequisite in college tho other people that havent taken the AP class/ exam will, saving you time and money).  However, more selective universities wont accept that as a credit since EVERYBODY applying there has pretty much taken a bunch of APs & basically to even get in you would have had to have taken lots of APs  <br>  <br>  hope this helps, good luck!! :)

qRx3ynKdaa	First, ignore the ignoramus who thinks that every one in medieval Europe was Christan (Roman Catholic). She apparently has totally forgotten Jews and Muslims (especially in Spain and eastern Europe) as well as pagans in Norway and Sweden.<br>  <br>  And being ferried to the magic isle of Avalon is hardly a Christian funeral.<br>  <br>  We don’t usually know who was responsible for copying the manuscripts that have survived. In some cases they may have been monks, in other cases secular clergy, that is people who could read and write but were not part of the church hierarchy or any monastic order.<br>  <br>  The church did not officially have anything whatsoever to say about Arthurian tales. But the increasing importance of the story of the grail in Arthurian tales indicates that at least some of the tellers were strong Christians, and perhaps members of the church hierarchy or of a monastic order. The “Prose Lancelot” places that site at which Lancelot was kidnapped as a child at the future site of the abbey of Fontrevault, which is makes to be founded by Lancelot's mother. <br>  <br>  Nuns of the same order ruled at Almesbury, where in some later versions of the tale Guinevere became a nun after Arthur’s disappearance. That might indicate some influence by certain members of that order on the Lancelot tales. However the church itself never officially even mentioned the grail stories. Probably Arthurian tales were thought to be too fantastical to be worthy of official church recognition. True, there were numerous fantastical saint legends, but Arthurian tales were mostly secular literature, with the wonders usually not particularly connected to God or the devil.<br>  <br>  Glastonbury abbey claimed to have found the body of Arthur on its grounds, and claimed to be the Island of Avalon. This was probably, as with most relics, a fraud. They also claimed to have been founded by Joseph of Arimathea, apparently borrowing this character from the grail romances. But the Joseph of the Glastonbury tales came to Glastonbury with two cruets containing the blood of Jesus, not with the grail.<br>  <br>  In the latest versions, the quest of the grail is not just a quest by Perceval and Gawain, but is shared by all the knights of the Round Table. Lancelot was known as Queen Guinevere's lover (first in Chrétien’s “Lancelot' in surviving texts). Seemingly some Christian author thought that the idea of Lancelot repenting of this sin was worthy of a grail story. The late “Quest of the Grail' (which Malory presents more or less complete with abridgements) is stylistically different from the “Prose Lancelot” which leads up to it. Galahad, Lancelot's son, is the hero, Perceval is demoted to a secondary role, and Bohort (Bors) Lancelot's cousin joins Galahad and Perceval as a third best knight.<br>  <br>  However, monks would copy almost anything they thought would sell, and also copied the great “Prose Tristan” and other more secular works. Palamedes was a famous pagan knight in these tales. True, he is finally Christened, but no-one seems to make much of his paganism even when he was a pagan. Tristan himself dies without a priest present, though he takes days to die in the “Prose Tristan”, and there would have been time to summon one. But this issue is ignored in the tale.<br>  <br>  Churches tried to connect themselves with famous kings like Arthur and Charlemagne, as one of the ways to encourage pilgrims to visit their site and to donate gift offerings. But other than the Glastonbury connection, there aren’t any connections made between Arthur and any genuine religious site.<br>  <br>  In short, beyond the grail stories, Christianity had about the same  importance in Arthurian tales as Islam has in the fantastic tales of the “Arabian Nights”. Both, in their separate tales, are assumed to be the true faith, and sometimes an author will go out of his way praise the true faith and make remarks about those who hold other false beliefs. But mostly this is coloration that doesn’t affect the basic stories told.|`|SOSsN6mpaa	Le Morte D'arthur takes place in medieval Europe and everyone in medieval Europe was Christian.

It would be a complete waste of your time and money.  Know that even if you were to find a program that met only one day a week or on weekends, the chances are great that you would have to travel additional days to meet with classmates to work on projects - this is grad school, not high school, where once class is over, you can just run off and do your homework on your own.

Also, the creation of life in a lab reduces life to a process devoid of love, and makes children commodities to be gotten at any cost. <br>  <br>  Additionally, the typical scenario is to harvest several eggs, fertilize them but then implant only a few and freeze the rest or use them for research or other things.

One of the first things to be built was the Docklands Light Railway which seemingly trundled through a wasteland.<br>  <br>  The big social upheaval was the families who had depended on the docks (phased out by containerisation) were displaced by Yuppies of the Thatcher years as the new (and expensive housing went up). <br>  <br>  I worked for a while on a barge moored at Canary Wharf - rows of derelict banana warehouses - come converted into TV studios - low rent spaces that were eventually displaced by the massive Olympia and York, which saw the original folksy masterplan tossed out of the window. developement.
blneMcSZaa	The reason why you aren't motivated to do what you need to do is because you associate too much pain to doing it so you'd rather put it off. Now I'm sure you've noticed from past experiences that you can only put it off for so long. Sooner or later, the pain of NOT doing it will be greater than the pain of just getting it done. That's why so many students end up pulling the dreaded "all nighter". <br>  <br>  So what do you do? Create lots of pain to NOT doing right away by imagining the consequences or just writing down what would happen or what you're missing out on by procrastinating. <br>  <br>  This is one of the most useful skills you can develop. The ability to get yourself to do what you need to do when you need to do it whether you feel like it or not. Master this skill of self-discipline and you'll have greater success and happiness than the majority of people around you.<br>  <br>  Every chance you get to strengthen this ability, take it and use it. Good luck.

fWP8aBpsaa	As far as I know, it is still a legal requirement for all schools in the UK to hold an "assembly" every morning.  <br>  <br>  However, the pressures of the national curriculum and other government schemes mean that there often isn't time for schools to do this.  Although, as I recall, lack of assemblies are noted in Ofsted inspections, a blind eye is more or less turned to schools failing to provide assemblies.  I certainly haven't heard of anyone being prosecuted for not providing one.<br>  <br>  Assemblies aside, I think schools being secular is probably a good thing.  You only need to look at Northern Ireland to see how much "good" "faith schools" have done there.  Yet the government are now actively encouraging people to set up schools for different faiths.<br>  <br>  In my humble opinion, teaching of religion should be something that is done at home, and it smacks of another case of parents abdicating responsibility for their off-spring to the state. <br>  <br>  It is very worrying that we have got to a position were justification for assembly appears to be that children don't know the difference between right and wrong.  Surely they should already know that by the time they start school?|`|AjqO1aJgaa	Uh, Pat, schools in the UK are not secular. RE is a required subject in English state schools. But they teach ABOUT religions and what people believe, not that what they believe is correct.|`|gFRqZzY6aa	In my school (In England) there are assemblies twice a week which involve a hymn,  some form of story and general notices about schools life (e.g. don't forget to bring in your pound for mufti day on Wednesday). Anyone who is not Christian can opt out of the religious part and sit in an adjacent room until that part is over. <br>  <br>  Tuesdays, Wednesdays and Thursdays have other sorts of assemblies and meetings such as Hose or Year Group assemblies, which are all secular. <br>  <br>  In short, there is still religion in school assemblies, although it isn't every day. On the other hand, I don't think that having a religion or not has any bearing on your morals. I am an atheist and yes, I have just as many morals as other people - they just aren't based on a deity that may or may not exist.|`|UAW1U3Uoaa	Utter rubbish, the concept of God is outdated, I would much rather my children spent time learning Science and Maths than ridiculous theories about a divine being creating the Universe. I don't believe in God but have perfectly good moral values and would teach these to my child, I don't need a school filling my childs head with such nonsense. Schools in the US have always been required to be 'secular' however some with in the bible belt do try to circumvent this. It is not and has never been a requirement for schools in the UK to be secular and there are many faith schools and non-affiliated schools still teach religous education.
uDoXxSxKaa	Firstly I am in my first year of Sixth Form.<br>  Sixth Form is college for 16-19 year olds, the ones who came from school recently.<br>  College is for all ages so you'll find people older than you in your classes<br>  I would prefer Sixth form even though I havent experienced College. Its more like school. Infact it is school. Everything is the same even the planners/diarys. In college you have to be more indepenant and hardworking whereas in Sixth form the lecturers push and guide you.<br>  <br>  Going into most subects at Uni doesnt require to to choose specific A-levels unless Science where you will need at least one science.<br>  For Biology - I would say Chemistry, Maths and your other choices<br>  For English - I would say Psychology, Literature and your choices<br>  For Law - English Literature and a challenging subject like Maths<br>  <br>  You should notice that picking the basic subjects (Maths Science English) Allows you to go into any different university path.<br>  Good luck<br>  <br>  Oh and the language thing I think you need a grade C or above at GCSE. Not sure it depends on each college.<br>  Take care<br>  (I am doing English Literature, Law, Business Studies, Economics) And hoping to get into Law or Finance/Banking|`|l9ab36z4aa	I am doing mine next year. Sixth form is when you learn in a school so people there will be between the ages of 11 and 18. College is where there are just people between the ages of 16 and 18. Sixth form is better they usually get better results than colleges.  My fiend did law and he said it was boring at first but it get better. You might need chemistry for forensics. You should do chemistry just in case. I know someone who wanted to to a science related course at uni but was rejected because she didn't do chemistry which fundamental.|`|W6wamWLLaa	Yes, they sound good.<br>  I do A-level law and it is really easy. You only have 2 exams over the two years and they're only an hour each and very easy. I just had a mock and I thought it was just mostly common knowledge.

CtqWRAcFaa	You need to start with a new sample, for a couple of reasons.<br>  <br>  * One reason is that the presence of the iodine solution may (or may not) interfere with the Benedict's test in terms of its functioning properly.<br>  <br>  * The Benedict's test uses color as a graduated indicator; therefore it is likely that the ability to judge the color will be impaired because of the purple color of iodine-plus-starch.<br>  <br>  * Another reason is that the experiment calls for testing the STARCH  -- not "the starch plus some random extra stuff" --  for the presence of sugar.  So testing the mixture of starch plus iodine would be poor experimental design.  Who can say if the addition of other reagents has altered the structure of the starch molecules or not?<br>  <br>  <br>  EXTRA CREDIT:<br>  <br>  * You can easily determine if the presence of iodine disturbs or spoils the Benedict's test.  Divide one single sample of starch-plus-amylase into two samples.  Add iodine to one.  Run a Benedict's on both.<br>  <br>  * If you are using saliva as the source of amylase, you can also test the following  hypothesis (which is one that students sometimes don't think of) -- "Is the source of the sugar in the amylase-treated sample the actual saliva itself?  Does saliva contain sugar rinsed from the mouth?  Is saliva itself a sugar?"  You can test this by running a Benedict's test on plain saliva (mixed with water if you want.) If it turns out that plain saliva gives a positive Benedict's, then the positive result from a starch-plus-saliva test does not demonstrate if amylase acts on starch or not.|`|mtyhSPi9aa	its better to start with a new sample of with only starch and amylase <br>  BECAUSE if you use the old sample , it might have already changed its chemical properties<br>  and by using a new sample , you can compare it with the old sample<br>  so , it would be easier to make an observation

tbGZnkgPaa	Is there anyway you could find a different school? I would advise against completing a major that doesn't help progress your career goals. Remember the whole point of college is to become qualified for the job you want after college! If you want to be an english teacher then you should probably study as much english as possible! <br>  <br>  You adviser is right that you would need an English master's degree anyway so your undergrad degree wouldn't have as much effect. However if I were you I would look into other schools. Maybe consider an online university like Thomas Edison, they offer high quality and accredited B.A.s in english. I only know because my friend did that exact same thing! She went on to get a master's and now teaches for our school district!<br>  <br>  If you do stay around there and you adviser things pysch is the best choice then I would take his advice. He has had experience with this and hopefully wouldn't steer you wrong!<br>  <br>  Good luck and I hope everything works out!|`|A6zAjOcnaa	You should transfer to a school that has the majors that interest you.<br>  <br>  Be aware that English and psychology are both overcrowded fields.  There are many more PhD's awarded than there are jobs.  And many people with doctorates are applying for community college jobs.  So, you might need a PhD to even have a chance of finding a job at a CC.<br>  <br>  Be sure you research what the job market is for academic and nonacademic jobs in your field before you enroll in a graduate program. It would be a good idea to get a graduate degree in an area that is marketable outside academia.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://chronicle.com/jobs/news/2003/06/2003060301c.htm" rel="nofollow">http://chronicle.com/jobs/news/2003/06/2...</a>

2646a4e9d6d4e936660d70ff922397f3aa	First of all, know that she was only doing what any good, caring teacher would do under the circumstances, whether she overheard you or not.  If I were to see a student of mine (or, frankly, any student) crying at school, I would make sure they didn't get ignored.  They could be in pain, or they could be really upset about something significant (as you are), and I don't want to meddle, I also don't want the student to think that no one cares.<br>  <br>  There is a chance the teacher could tell the guidance counselor, depending on how big the school is (it is harder to do this at a large school, but at a small school everyone knows everyone else).  If so, what she said will depend on whether or not she knew why you were crying.  She may just say, "I saw this student crying today; you might want to check up on her to see what is wrong."  Or she may say, "I overheard this student telling her friends that she might be pregnant."  <br>  <br>  You might think of using the guidance counselor to help you formulate a strategy for telling your parents and boyfriend, if you have one.  I know not all counselors are great at that kind of thing, but they are often better at it than most teenaged girls.  The counselor's concerns are likely to be your health and well-being and that of the child, if it turns out you are pregnant (and you may not be - stress can do horrible things to your body, and then worrying that you might be pregnant will stress you out further).  You don't want to be one of those girls you read about in the news who get arrested because they never told anyone they were pregnant and, when they gave birth, dumped the baby in the toilet or a dumpster somewhere.   If it turns out you ARE pregnant, this is a chance to step up and handle things maturely.  You would have some major decisions to make that will affect the rest of your life and those of others even more than those college decisions you might have coming up.  There is nothing wrong with seeking help for making those decisions, just as you would about college.  The problem is that when people (and I'm speaking here of your parents, boyfriend, etc.) hear that a teen girl is pregnant, they tend to become very emotional, and that complicates your ability to make the best possible decisions.<br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|v0596BTeaa	Your teacher may tell your guidance counselor.  If she does, and this other adult speaks to you, then you should tell her what is wrong.  It is also a good idea to take a test and find out if you actually are pregnant.  If you are, it won't just go away!|`|hSy8ZKRXaa	If you're pregnant, wouldn't it be a good idea to talk to your guidance counselor? She/he would help you to cope with the many decisions you'll need to make if you are pregnant, and if you're not,  he/she will help you not get pregnant in the future. Your guidance counselor will be very experienced in these issues and is there to help you.|`|AA10288267	if the teacher was a good teacher, they would go to the guidance counselor.  when you do go, tell the truth,  they are there to help.  I am a teacher and many times i refer my students to the guidance counselors.  we have a student who is pregnant right now and the whole community is very supportive.  talk to them and they will be able to get you help or talk to your parents.|`|gIXucjoaaa	Make sure you talk to a parent about this soon in case she did hear and tells the guidance counselor.  But most likely, she just saw you crying and was wondering if she could help.  Don't worry.  It will all be OK.|`|u935HFEoaa	I hope she does for your sake and the sake of the baby if you are pregnant.  Please go home and tell your parents.  God bless you!

Well at least not in my secondary school. People do stick to their groups, but I don't think its anything like in America. Well not from what I've seen in films :)|`|x5cgNLAQaa	Not really many cheerleaders in England. Girls seem to do their own sport, netball, lacrosse, tennis (and other sports like football, rugby if you want to). In UK a lot of girls find being a cheerleader insulting. <br>  Now skaters, there aren't many of them that class themselves like that. There are a lot of people who skate, but that kind of stereotype doesn't. <br>  The jock stereotype does exist. The sportier bunch usually stick around together. Though the sportier people are not necessarily more popular in UK schools. Your popularity is usually derived on your humour.<br>  The main stereotype I see is appearance. A lot of people seem to dress the same way, try and have the same style of haircuts. Also a loot of teenagers class themselves via what music they listen to, e.g. indie rock, rap being the most noticeable. In speech a lot of teenagers use many of the same phrases in order to associate with others (find comfort in familiarity). <br>  Oh and of course there are still those other groups, e.g. emos, chavs, goths too.....|`|AA12234166	Not a definite as in America, and people (especially the lads) mix a lot but there are 'groups'.<br>  There's chavs, wannabe chavs (several groups of these who hate each other)hippiess, wannabehippiess/emos/goths/seen ect. nerdy people and normal people- you also have the sporty/funny guys.<br>  so quite a fewactuallyy, but most of them just mush into 'idiots' lol.|`|slZwNrCoaa	when i was in school there was the nerds, goths/emos chavs and just popular people and normal people. its not like in American schools though (judging from what ive seen on TV lol)|`|0PHkx64paa	Sure as hell :)<br>  <br>  In my school:<br>  <br>  -It's rare to talk to other cliques but it happens.<br>  -You keep to your own area of the school.<br>  -You don't copy 'the populars', or talk to them, or argue with them.<br>  -We can't say anything, like 'shut-up' to a popular because they rank above you, but you could say it to a nerd because they rank below you.<br>  <br>  That's the mean world of my English High School -It's awful, but you learn to adapt after the first week.|`|gFRqZzY6aa	Not really. We obviously have different groups, but the people in them are just in them because they are friends with each other. We don't refer to anyone as a 'jock' and cheerleading is quite rare - we don't tend to have it at school sports matches. Most people here only know about cliques as such because they have seen films about American High Schools! <br>  <br>  The fact that we are nowhere near as cliquey as American High Schools has been confirmed by a friend of mine who moved here from Texas.|`|GHia9DPlaa	Chavs,Emos,Skanks,Losers (geeks,nerds), eccentric people (they don't have a specific name)<br>  <br>  Don't worry,most only come in small quantities!|`|2ADABqY5aa	Yeah.

We don't class ourselves as anything.<br>  <br>  There are those who do class themselves as a certain groups - but they are generally viewed in contempt from the others. <br>  <br>  In my school, we don't class smart people as "nerds" and to be smart is generally a good thing and openly encouraged. <br>  <br>  Within a year group there is no social standing and you quite entitled to tell anyone to shut up or whatever.<br>  <br>  One thing you do find though is that you are ranked by age. You must show respect to the years above you, and generally the older years look down on the younger ones. The only exception being either family in younger years or the year 7s, the youngest year. In my school at least the oldest years tend to be protective of the youngest. <br>  <br>  Then again, this is just my school and I've already admitted I live in a small town with a Strong local community.

If you go to a school which is dominated by chavs and preps, then most likely yes, unless you convert to their way of life (smoking, drinking, bunking off school, getting pregnant, etc) which I suggest you do NOT do.<br>  However, most schools aren't like that, so I don't think so. I'm in year 11 at the moment, and it's pretty alright. There's an American girl in my year, and she's one of the most popular.|`|pKHRh7DOaa	I hope not but you have to remember people in school will make jokes about everything from time to time..Try not to take it personally you will probably get a few comments about you accent (if you have one) .But just laugh along with it & think people will probably be laughing at something else a few minutes later.So dont take it to seriously just laugh along & not making an issue of it will mean its soon forgotten<br>  <br>  So dont think of it as bully unless its insistent then it would be bullying.<br>  <br>  Good luck hope things go well for you<br>  Take care<br>  Lisa xx|`|zX4dQUo0aa	I doubt it :)<br>  <br>  We had a new girl start in our class last year who was american, everyone thought she was amazingly cool (so did i, i must admit..) and I hang around with her a lot now.

You'll have to wear a school uniform, unless you will be going to one of those lucky posh schools where you can wear what you like :P<br>  You'll have to pick options (lessons) seeing as you are joining in year 10, before you arrive. You'll have someone to help you round the school, probably a Prefect but maybe just someone the teachers have selected.<br>  You have 6 terms. Inbetween each term is a 'half term'. A term is like... a semester? I dunno what you call them. October half term/holiday lasts 1 week, Christmas 2 weeks, Valentines 1 week, Easter 2 weeks, May 1 week, then you get a 6 week holiday in Summer.<br>  The general 'cliques' are: emo, chav/slut/popular, 'gorm'/geek/nerd or normals. Usually, however, most schools are just split down the middle eg. You have normals and sluts/ the bossy ones. <br>  You get different amounts of homework depending on which school you go to. My school generally gives 0, 1, 2 or 3 homeworks a day.<br>  You'll always need to bring your PE Kit else you'll have to wear the schools one. They wash them but it's not very nice not knowing who's worn it before you.<br>  You'll have a different teacher for every subject and a tutor, which is like head of your tutor group/main class. You'll also have a form tutor and head of Upper School.<br>  <br>  If I come up with anything else, I'll edit it in. :)|`|b1znvwnJaa	It's okay, we're all quite close... it's not like those cliques "cheerleaders", "jocks" , "nerds" ... well there are nerds xD but everyone is really nice to each other :)|`|M8rwQNyKaa	Hey i am in year 10 school is good . You have 5 lessons in a day lasting 60 mins some school have double lessons you will have a break  and double lesson  lunch then another lesson then go home. you will have the choice to pick your lesson and will have to either send your work over from amercia or catch up and take new subjects. this is my school you can look at it from the website. <a href="http://www.penair.cornwall.sch.uk" rel="nofollow">http://www.penair.cornwall.sch.uk</a> you will also were a uniform <br>  <br>  hope i helped <br>  <br>  good luck|`|SPvkz1kQaa	Hi! I'm in Year 10 at the moment. I enjoy school but I think you will find it very different. It depends on where you have moved too, but you will have to study all the main subjects (English, maths, science, etc) and you will also have some choice over the extra subjects you study for your GCSEs. I don't think you will have much trouble fitting in, the other members of your year group will probably be interested in where you come from originally! At my school, and at most school, we where a uniform. The year is divided into three terms, each with a half term half way through. The holidays dividing the terms are Christmas, Easter and Summer (that's probably the same). Your year will be spilt into about eight forms (that's how many we have) each with a form tutor, and you will have a head of year. Homework and coursework will be a big part of your lessons in Year 10, but that also depends on the school.<br>  <br>  Good luck! I hope it goes well at your new school.<br>  <br>  Lucy|`|qXvFsnOcaa	Gray and boring. British high schools are dull dull dull.<br>  <br>  On the upside, there is almost no gang culture and pretty much zero gun crime in UK schools. Most neither have nor need security guards or metal detectors and they haven't had a school shooting in years.<br>  <br>  British schools also don't have jocks, or cheerleaders. Which I consider a huge bonus over an American school.<br>  <br>  On the other hand, most British schools are much smaller than US schools. They rarely ever get over maybe 1000 students and most are much smaller. This means that they mostly only have the facilities of a small town school even if they are in a big city. It's almost unknown for them to have swimming pools and their sports facilities are usually pretty poor. Most only have a small gym and a couple of soccer pitches. None of which have bleachers (It's strictly standing only). British schools use PCs instead of MACs, so if you've got an MAC book you're going to need to buy a PC to bring your work home.<br>  <br>  UK schools generally have less homework than US schools, but their  school year is much longer. You don't get a long Spring break, only 5 days, and the Summer vacation is maybe 1/3 of the length of a US summer vacation. Their days are also longer (how much depends on which state you are from).<br>  <br>  Classes are quite different in the UK, you rarely have to do presentations or book reports, there is no study hall or independent study, and in many schools you have to have mandatory classes on religion (Learning about the different world religions, not actually doing anything religious yourself). Many British schools also have prayer at least once a week. You don't have to do it, if you don't want to, but you usually just have to sit there while other people do. It's perfectly normal and legal in the UK, you can ask to be excused if you like.<br>  <br>  UK schools don't usually have a cafeteria, only a canteen. You get hot food but much less choice than in the US. They've banned or restricted a lot of junk food so you may only get good like pizza or fries once a week, if that. They've never heard of stuff like fish sticks, tater tots, or sloppy joes which you may or may not consider a good thing.<br>  <br>  You're also allowed cell phones in UK schools, you can even use them on school grounds without getting in to trouble. Mostly they won't even confiscate them, they will just tell you not to use them in class.<br>  <br>  UK schools are also often split into two sections. You graduate school at 16 in the UK so until then you are in one section of the school, and if you decide to stay on you go into the second section until you are 18. This second section is usually called Sixth form, though some people skip this and go straight to college instead to do things called A-Levels which are basically like the last two years of high school in the US, except that you only study a few subjects.<br>  <br>  There's no summer school in the UK, and you automatically pass each year so only people who are extremely dumb (and I mean illiterate dumb) or who were sick for along time ever get held back. And even then it's rare.<br>  <br>  They don't like showoffs in the UK, so don't try to be flash. Even if you think that things are better in the US don't say so, and don't presume that people think the same way in the UK as in the US. Most people in the UK have strong feelings about the US and even if they don't show it most of the time they can get very angry about some of what has happened over the last few years under Bush. It's best to find out what other people think before you say say too much, just in case.<br>  <br>  UK schools are also about 2 years behind US schools in terms of trends and fashions.|`|0PHkx64paa	It's a good time, when you get to year 10 it's a bit more serious because everyone has matured past all the silly fades and important exams are coming up -but it's still a laugh and I'm sure you'll enjoy it :)<br>  <br>  <br>  Good luck! x|`|Z7wyoEcwaa	wow from america to UK!<br>  any way  i would imagine it would be just the same as your american school.

They're so friendly and there are great opportunities to meet them.
zCHnMeXbaa	In this sentence the word scattered is not a verb since it is used to mean distributed randomly.  If it was used in the place of skipped it would be a verb.|`|QGyasdZMaa	In the context of your sentence, scattered is not the active verb, skipped is,  Scattered is acting as an adjective.|`|grSJgS4laa	Yes, of course it's verbal. It's a past participle. It's not adjectival without a noun next to it.|`|T8DThYKHaa	verb = skipped<br>  It is a verb, but the use of it here may be as some sort of poetry. It is also bad sentence construction|`|LzgOsJHhaa	no

You can also use "or" there.  Nor is not used as often.|`|fecUjSr1aa	Let me see if I can give you a better perspective here ..<br>  <br>  Either - Or and Neither - Nor as you know are used together. However, you use "either-or" if the sentence is positive ..<br>  <br>  ex. either you get the car or the bike ..<br>  <br>  you use "neither-nor" if the sentence is negative <br>  <br>  ex. neither jim nor john passed the exam<br>  <br>  that's what my English teacher taught me ... that helps?|`|dEbDlgb3aa	or goes with either<br>  Mom told us to buy either apples or oranges.<br>  <br>  nor goes with neither<br>  Neither the apples nor oranges look good today.|`|jygcvFAMaa	or is compatible with either.<br>  nor is compatible with neither.<br>  here are examples:<br>  either my mother or my father ate my chocolates.<br>  Neither my dog nor my cat played with my hamster.<br>  <br>  That's all, very easy.<br>  I hope'd i helped :)

O4Shkbjqaa	Dude, you are deep on the mud. Umm. . . John Adams made that statement to explain to people that that particular scene was not a part of the major revolution. Some people definitely thought that is was and this definitely cleared things up. Another example is, he also was stating part of his definition of revolution. Not clearly, but he was telling us what was not in his definition. A final example is, the revolution was in the minds of the people. If it was in the minds of the people, the revolution would have occurred before that, and even if this scene had not occurred the revolution still would have been a part of him and the people. Good luck on your test dude!|`|pyHF4eYJaa	The people in the colonies had decided they would tolerate no more tyranny. They wanted freedom. They wanted to create a nation unlike any which had existed in the world before, with inalienable rights for all people (in theory, at least). As soon as people really started to believe this, the violence and the war were just the necessary consequence of the people's desire to throw off tyranny.<br>  <br>  (Well that's one way to look at it anyway. Another would be to say that the colonists wanted to be the new tyrants but were using an ideology to justify and cover and conceal their theft of the colonies.)<br>  <br>  Subcommander Avocado has spoken.|`|FteB0LOraa	There is no John Adams. He is in the history books, but he does not really exist. He lives with Santa Claus, the Easter Bunny, the Tooth Fairy, all those people you hear about, but really aren't there.

KgKVWv9paa	You don't necessarily need a degree for this.  It doesn't guarantee you the job either but don't let that stop you from going after your associates anyway, its better than nothing.  If you are hired the company may also help you pay for your education while you are taking courses.  Go for it, it will make it easier to learn the things you need to know rather than trying to figure all of it out on your own.  Unless you are lucky in life a GED will only get you so far.|`|6f5395773cce7a0187fdf217ce48b5e9aa	I'd focus on completing the degree first. a HS diploma-only person without experience is going to have a lot of difficulty finding an office assistant job in this economic climate right now.  There are just so many other unemployed candidates who have superior educational credentials and/or experience that will beat you to the job time and again.  Jobs like these are getting 2 to 3x the normal amount of applications.  By the time you finish the program things will be better.

2UDbOpxTaa	Imagine you are in a specific part of that photo. What can you smell, feel, hear, see? Do you feel happy? Why? Do you wish someone or something was with you? Do you want to stay there? Brainstorm your answers to these questions to start with, then take these feelings, sights, etc, and put them into sentences.<br>  <br>  These sentences should have some typical English-class techniques in them like similies, metaphors, alliteration, onomatopoeias, etc.|`|DfK4JSytaa	I will try to help you by giving you tools, explaining what you need to understand about the assignment, so that in the future you can do it yourself.<br>  <br>  Using your senses to describe something is to tell what you see, hear, feel or smell. Examples: 1)The meadow is filled with green grass. 2)The wild flowers, blue, yellow, red, sparkle in the sun.<br>  <br>  Using a metaphor means to compare one thing to another thing that it can't possibly be. Examples: 1)The meadow is a flowing ocean of green. 2) Flowers are sparkling gemstones. <br>   <br>  Using a simile means to compare one thing with another in a poetic fashion. Examples: 1) The meadow is like a carpet of green. 2) The flowers shimmer against the sky like stars. <br>  <br>  I hope this helps.|`|nCrJcilbaa	Do it in steps.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  Get a piece of paper and write down some info about your meadow.  What is the season of the year,  the time of day, and the weather?  Now list your senses.  Leave plenty of space between them so you can put in more information by each one.<br>  <br>  See<br>  Hear<br>  Smell<br>  Taste<br>  Feel<br>  <br>  Now, go back to one of your senses.  Brainstorm some words in your meadow associated with that sense.  Let's say it is sunrise on a morning in early summer.<br>  <br>  I see... a light mist rolling off the ground.  Rabbits eating tender new grass. Red clay dirt between patches of bright green grasses.  Cows at the far end of the meadow beginning their day's grazing..  White daisies with bright yellow centers, brilliant blue bachelor buttons.  Spiderwebs outlined in dew suspended from fenceposts and tall weeds.  The sun rise painting the sky in colors of awakening.<br>  <br>  Hear - Mother cows calling their calves.  Birds singing, The morning breeze rustling across the grass.  dogs barking at the farmhouse beside the meadow.  Roosters crowing.  the distant sound of trucks from a highway a couple miles off <br>  <br>  Feel - warm wind on your face.  the uneven ground beneath your feet.  you might take your shoes off to feel the cold morning dew on your toes.  silky flower petals, prickly thistles, a feather found on the ground.<br>  <br>  Taste - a little harder because we don't normally go around eating stuff at random!  However, you might have brought soemthing along on your walk, so you could find a place to sit down & open your pack.  In it there could be cheese & crackers, an apple, a PB&J.  Whatever, it's your pack bring along what you like.  You could have some berry bushes growing at the edge of the meadow.  In June the wild raspberries would be starting to ripen.  Yummy!  all tart & sweet at the same time.<br>  <br>  Smells - farm smells, cow smells, a skunk passed by & left his musky odor on the breeze.<br>  <br>  Anyway, just keep building using words & phrases for each sense.  Don't worry about making sentences or paragraphs at first.  Also, don't worry about the quality of what you put down or whether it goes together or is even possible.  Maybe your meadow was the scene of an alien landing the night before and you are seeing scorched marks on the ground where their ship's rockets burned the area.  Maybe they experimented on a couple of the cows...  Whatever, it is your meadow and you can make it how you want.  have fun.  Ridiculous is OK.  <br>  <br>  Take a break after you get done brainstorming your ideas.  If you've really stretched your imagination, you'll need to get refreshed.<br>  <br>  Similes & metaphors.  this is taking the ideas and phrases you wrote <br>  and making up new ways to say them.  The smell of the flowers might be faerie perfume.  Roosters crowing might be described as the clarion call of the farmer's alarm clock telling him it is time to get up and start the day.<br>  <br>  Anyway, if you do the brainstorming, your paper will practically write itself.  Take the words and phrases you already  wrote and turn them into sentences with good grammar and punctuation.<br>  <br>  Good luck with your paper.  I hope you ace it!|`|La5D6jnRaa	I just had to do this. I would suggest guide sheet..first think of senses.. what and how does the meadow make you feel (ex: happy, calm) once you got everything in that category move on to the next one which would be metaphors. ex: Make a list of feelings in the meadow and compare it to something in nature.. (ex: the meadow calms me like a hot bath on a sunday morning.) **sorry that kinda sucks**** remember to use like or as.... and keep on going making lists. and then write your piece.

I think you can accomplish anything if you're willing to pay the price.”<br>  Success in MBA Entrance Exam in India is also no cake walk. You need in-depth knowledge, analytical mind, sharp memory and above all, systematic planning and preparation. Needless to say that the candidates cannot and should not attempt preparation for his MBA Entrance Test overnight. Since the competition is amongst the best available talent from all disciplines, meticulous and long term preparation are required to get admitted to the MBA program. Although the syllabi in the admission/entrance test differ from university to university, there are certain common aspects that appear in most of the entrance test, CAT, XAT, MAT, XLRI, SNAP and MBA Entrance Exams conducted by State Universities in one form or the other. These aspects include tests on quantitative aptitude, reasoning, intelligence, comprehension, case analysis, relationships, word power, synonyms, antonyms, general knowledge/awareness, etc. It is therefore, essential that the candidates start preparing well in advance on all the above aspects. If one can get hold of previous year's papers or at least the pattern, this would go a long way in guiding the candidates to prepare properly for the test.

AA10439008	Draw the picture and draw a segment perpendicular to the two chords that passes through the center. Call the part on the side of the center going to the 24 cm chord x, and the other part will be 17 - x since the whole segment is 17. It bisects the two chords into 12 and 5 cm parts.  Then draw two radii, one to A and one to C To make two right triangles. By Pythagorean, you'll get<br>  x^2 + 12^2 = r^2<br>  (17 - x)^2 + 5^2 = r^2<br>  <br>  Since both = r^2 you have x^2 + 144 = (17-x)^2 + 25<br>  <br>  FOIL out the (17-x)(17-x) and solve for x then plug that in to get r<br>  <br>  Hope that helps
ymNM6mmzaa	In my opinion, the whole credit evaluation industry is a scam.<br>  <br>  Sorry, I have no advice.|`|ICuI6BXcaa	This is plain wrong.  A single HNC is worth a year of HE by itself, so about 30 credits.  Seems to me that you got no more than a single A level or Scottish Higher's worth of credit for an HNC. <br>  <br>  Which credit evaluation service did you use?  It is worth considerably more than 8 credits.  Your 4 HNC/HND awards well surpass a US Associates Degree.  I would go so far as to say that a good HND in a technical subject is about equivalent to 3 years of HE in the US.  <br>  <br>  Do not accept this, whatever you do.  This is not right.  I suggest you try WES.|`|vzdmgjvZaa	That is not right at all.  An HNC is worth at least 1 year of Higher Education by itself, an HND/HNC with other course at least 1.5 years,  did they even look at your Unit passes?  It doesn't require four HNC/HND's to equal the first year of an American degree.  For Pete's sake they spend two years in US schools getting credit for what British students did in High School.   So , yes that is pretty grudging.  Kick them into touch and get your degree with the OU instead.  Name and shame who gave you this rubbish credit evaluation.

nQPcbjLKaa	First you do 4 years of high school, or secondary school, and graduate at about the age of 18 typically. Then you can go for a 2 year degree, which is an A.A. or Associates degree. 2 more years gets you a B.A. or B.S. which is a Bachelor of Arts, or Science. From there you can go for 3 years of law school or 4 years of medical school. Or you can go for a Masters degree which is usually 2 more years beyond your Bachelor's, then you can go for a PhD., or Doctorate, which may take any number of years to complete, usually 2-5. Whatever that translates to in Europe, I have no idea, but that's the way it works in the States generally.

riMlVJnXaa	I don't know your teacher so obviously I'm not sure how she will react to you asking her this.<br>  I suggest you wait until the end of your lesson and approach her calmly and ask her if she has 5 minutes to spare. If she does, ask to see her during a lunch break or at the end of thebecausecause you're really struggling with your work and you need help. If she sees that you are serious and aren't trying to be disruptive during the lesson, she may take you seriously. If you arrange to see her during a lunch break/end of school etc. then stick to it and meet her, if you don't meet her then she may think you're just messing around and trying to waste her time.<br>  DON'T be disruptive during the lessons because if you are, she will never want to help you. Don't get distracted by your friends, and focus as much as you can when she is teaching.<br>  Respect her and she will respect you.<br>  If this doesn't help, go to another maths/science teacher and ask them to help you, I'm sure they will be happy to help.<br>  As a very very last resort, get your parents to speak to the teacher or your head of school.<br>  <br>  Good luck with your End Of Grade testing!!|`|AA11403712	It never ceases to amaze me that every student that is failing, people come to the conclusion the student is at fault. You said you asked for help and did not receive the needed support. It is not always up to the student to ask for help. A good teacher will recognize a student that is trying hard but is having difficult times to understand. I would suggest to make an appointment with your school councilor and ask why interventions are not being done in the classroom to help you. Try not to repeat a grade, most statistics show students that are held back have the highest dropout rate. Not all students learn the same way, maybe your teacher needs to find an alternative in his/her teaching to help you to understand better. Good Luck and don't give up.|`|gIXucjoaaa	Try telling one of your parents that you are having this problem.  Some teachers don't like to listen to students but still will listen to a parent.  Try writing down some examples of when she refuses to help you and showing them to a parent or the principal.  If that doesn't work, you could ask another student who seems to be doing well to tutor you.  They usually find it very flattering that someone thought of them as capable of giving help.|`|LuTjBw4Laa	just be honest come to her before or after school and tell her, '' look i know you may not like me too much but i would really appreciate you to help me with my work. i don't understand it and i want to get it. please help me im coming to you for help''. and if she says no to tha then hun get a tutor cuz this women is obiously not worth your time! (:|`|RvddYKqjaa	It never ceases to amaze me that teachers hate all students who are failing. People who work and try hard never say their teachers hate them. I have to wonder if there's a correlation. The way to get your teacher to help you is to talk to her. She has several classes to teach. She can't help you get your grades up while she is working with other kids. You have to make a commitment to ask her when she can see you, and then to ask her for some advice. It may actually be better for you to repeat a grade so you can get a good educational foundation. Getting good grades doesn't just happen. You have to work, and you have to work hard. I know you have it in you to do that, but you have to start taking responsibility for your low grades and stop blaming others. Anyone who wants and needs help can get it, believe me. You can do a whole lot better.|`|W3UYWpxiaa	Ask her after class if there is a time that you can stop by and see her because you aren't understanding a certain concept.  She may tell you to come by either during your lunch, break, homeroom period, ect.  If she tells you that you need to pay attention ask yourself if you really are listening during class.  If you are doing everything you need to be doing in class go your parents/guardians and let them know the situation.  You may also want to get help from another teacher or tutor to try to bring your grades up.  Since it is so close to the end of the year you will have to bring your grades WAY up very quickly, but even then it may not be enough to keep you from repeating your grade.  In the future don't wait until the end of the school year to get help.  Work hard and try to get all of the help you need from the beginning so you don't have to worry about bring your grades so far up --they'll already be there.  Good Luck!

Hotels and restaurants have also been informed that henceforth no food material should be packed in plastic. Local self-government bodies have been given the responsibility to seize all plastic carry bags below 30 microns from shops. Even the use of plastic tumblers have been banned. The authorities concerned are empowered to slap a nominal fine at the initial stage and Rs.5,000 on repeating the offence. Steps to be taken under the provisions included in the Environment Protection Act provide maximum punishment of Rs.1 lakh fine and imprisonment up to five years and cancellation of shop licence for non-compliance. It is very clear that the government means business.<br>  <br>  It may seem as a knee-jerk reaction to the recent state-wide outbreak of viral diseases in the state. Plastic bags were identified as the main breeding ground for the mosquitoes which caused these diseases. However, in the long run, the move will benefit the state in more than one way. Studies have shown that on an average a household uses around three to five plastic carry-bags a day. While life without plastic is unthinkable today, what is required is a pragmatic approach to its reuse. In India, waste recycling is still an idea whose time is yet to come. Something as simple as separating waste at the household level has not taken off, with the result that plastics clutter landfills. They burn along with waste, releasing noxious gases. Plastic bags smother our streams and rivers, they clog the drains, and find their way into the digestive systems of cows and turtles! Plastic is above all derived from a scarce resource, petroleum.

Seorang penulis muzik kontemporari berkata “Pemimpin orkestra simfoni biasanya duduk di hujung sebuah meja memegang sesuatu yang panjang , berkilat dan tipis … dan apabila rahib perempuan yang lain bersedia , dia akan memberi mereka beberapa petanda  dengan ‘barang’ itu untuk bermula , ia kemudiannya diikuti dengan rentak ukuran masa. Dengan rentak-rentak itu , mereka harus patuhi untuk menyanyi dan bermain instrumen dengan betul”.<br>  <br>  <br>  Jean-Baptiste Lully (1632 - 87) menjaga masa dengan menghentak sesuatu yang panjang pada lantai  waktu berlatih.

bGyR9yUfaa	John Hanson (April 14 [O.S. April 3] 1721 – November 22, 1783) was a merchant and public official from Maryland during the era of the American Revolution. After serving in a variety of roles for the Patriot cause in Maryland, in 1779 Hanson was elected as a delegate to the Continental Congress. He signed the Articles of Confederation in 1781 after Maryland finally joined the other states in ratifying them. In November 1781, he became the first President of Congress to be elected under the terms of the Articles of Confederation. For this reason, Hanson was later promoted as having been the first President of the United States, one of several myths about him.

2646a4e9d6d4e936660d70ff922397f3aa	Honestly, I think that a big part of it is how we have presented math in this country.  Many, if not most, students are told from an early age that math is hard, and that it will be impossible for all but the most intelligent students.  Then we portray every mathematician or person using math as the ultimate nerd.  Remember that in the rest of the world billions of students have studied math successfully, and they don't have any more native intelligence than do U.S. students.  Math shouldn't be any more difficult for our students than it is for theirs.  Yet they go on to learn math, and most of our students leave school thinking that math was beyond them and that they shouldn't have had to be subjected to that torture.<br>  <br>  A secondary reason, as others have suggested, is that many math teachers and tutors are the few who DID get math the first time around, and who then teach with an attitude of, "Well, if you don't get it, you are too stupid to waste my time on!"  Generally our history and English teachers don't take that kind of an arrogant stance, and we then manage to learn history and English, even if we started out afraid of those subject matters.  Math students who ask WHY they are learning a particular theorem or proof are, far more often than in history or English or just about any other subject matter, just told to wait, that at some point in the distant future it will all become clear.  Most people need more reason than that to be able to push through the tough moments in a subject matter.|`|HamL63Dtaa	tutors like u r hell|`|8ghkutEfaa	They do not understand math because of being lazy.Some students do not like to think too much.you know to think too much is a little complicated.I think math is a subject that require some hard understanding to learn and when we think  too much our brain hurt.Also math have arithmetic,algebra,calculus and so on so it is <br>  hard for some people that having a lot time without practicing  math.Math is a subject of practicing.If we do this everyday without stopping I can assure that the results going to be betters.|`|W3UYWpxiaa	The students may not understand due to the way you or their teachers are teaching.  Each student is different so they may need their lessons to be modified.  As a tutor, you should try different methods (hands on, visual, ect.) and see which one works best for the student.|`|DWit98Spaa	Well, what does that mean? That is such a vague statement.

However, it is still important to examine those "subdued" characteristics in order to see the truth behind it.  Just my thoughts.

AA10305589	What is the debt for?  They can withohold the transcript if you owe them, and you will need a transcript to be accepted into any other accredited school, so you should contact the debtor and see if they can reduce the amount or offer a plan where you can pay it off over time.|`|XmLJ84YBaa	Ask the school what this debt is from. At many schools you can charge things like books and supplies from the bookstore to your student account with the school. This is separate from your student loans which came either from Uncle Sam or a private lender. I'm sure the school will be able to tell you what the bill is for. If you still believe this is not a legitimate bill ask what their process is to dispute a charge. It may be a difficult process, but if you owe the school they will hold onto your transcript until they get their cash.

juk0m4osaa	Haha, "vagina logic", clever :-p.  Anyway, when someone says you "take yourself too seriously" they may mean that you worry too much about yourself and you're maybe a little bit self-conscious/have a bit of an ego.  It's hard to put into words...but in a nut shell it means uptight/lacking a sense of humor about yourself (lacking the ability to laugh at youself/let loose).<br>  So maybe in that specific situation, not taking youself too seriously would have been laughing at the situation and having an "oh well" type of attitude about it.  (although i would have been pissed too!,i wouldn't worry about it or take any offense, lol, so maybe you're not too serious, this girl just isn't serious enough)|`|fecUjSr1aa	probably she meant that you were losing your sense of humor and that you were still uptight about the car towing incident .. am i right?<br>  <br>  i would be upset too, dude, especially if i had to pay $120 hard-earned money. but perhaps, the car-towing is like "no use crying over split milk" kind of thing .. what's done is done. Its over and you learned a lesson and move on. let it be a thing of past but just keep it in there for "future reference"<br>  <br>  apparently, she appreciates you, as she allows you to be in her place, go out with you, and as you say, "we hit it off" .. you got good chemistry there. what she probably doesn't appreciate is you being a "cry baby" about the car-towing (i'm not calling you a cry-baby but she may be considering you as one), which is why she said "you're taking yourself too seriously"<br>  <br>  lighten up .. women are really hard to understand. that's their nature, as women too find it hard to understand men, because its our nature. but for her nature and your nature to play beautiful music together, some compromises have to be made .. get my drift?<br>  <br>  hope this helps .. life is a school .. we learn lessons from mistakes.

So, when someone says that there is no catch, they mean that there is no hidden condition or terms on what they are offering.|`|juk0m4osaa	"There is no catch" means that there is no hidden flaw or  negative aspect to the situation.

If there is no catch there is no trick or flaw.|`|GywOmWfIaa	One of the definitions of catch is a hidden problem or disadvantage in an apparently ideal situation: there's a catch in it somewhere.

gH0knRlUaa	I agree that you don't want to be doing French + another major European language.<br>  <br>  Something that's becoming really popular amongst language students nowadays is the study of Mandarin. After all, it is the most spoken language in the world. What with China becoming an emerging superpower (likely to become the world's biggest with a few decades) Mandarin would certainly be a wise choice if you wanted a well-paid job in translation. Business types often need a Mandarin speaker.<br>  <br>  If using the same type of logic, languages like Arabic and Russian would also be really beneficial.<br>  <br>  Of course, you don't just have to choose a language because of what you're going to get out of it in later life. Principally it's about enjoyment. If Hungarian is something you can see yourself enjoying for the next years, go for that. You don't want to be stuck doing something undesired because of what someone on YA told you!|`|34vGrrVwaa	I'd love to teach you some French, babby.|`|mwNpqDkFaa	It depends what job you want to go for when you leave. If you want to go into business, look at Japanese and Russian because workers from Japan and Russia often work in England and a lot of business is done between Europe and Japan and Russia. If you fancy joining MI6, learn Arabic or Urdu. They are looking for language specialists in those areas. Learning a language with a different script would stand you head and shoulders above the rest in the job market. As French is a Romance language, you'd pick up Italian and Spanish really easily so learn a language from another group. I did French and German at uni but I find I can understand Italian, Spanish, Dutch and a bit of Afrikaans. I now teach French and German but I wish I'd learnt Russian or Japanese alongside them.|`|7deb425958c53615415ce326bcbf08e0aa	Start by having a look at which language combinations are available. It's no use saying you want to do Hungarian if no uni does French with Hungarian. <br>  <br>  For a translating job go for something unusual, all French companies employ people who speak English and most countries teach English at school so you are going to be competing for jobs with people who speak English and another language of two.<br>  <br>  British Sign Language interpreters are always in demand, but don't often work abroad. The EU and European parliament translate everything into all the EU languages so a minority language like Catalan or Welsh can be useful.

TOPJybbsaa	Are they opposed to your getting the MBA or concentrating in airport management? If the former, it's too bad because they are uninformed. If the latter, you are uninformed. MBA in Airpor management is a misnomer. Schools grant the MBA degree, not MBA in pharmacy, or MBA in finance, or MBA in marketing. The MBA is a general broad degree that prepares students for high level management positions. MBA students study accounting, finance, marketing, statistics, management, economics, strategy, policy, leadership, and similar courses. The MBA is not like an MS that concentrates in one field and prepares students for staff positions. MBA programs offer concentrations in various fields, but this amounts only to 2-3 elective courses in the second year. Students develop an interest in some subjects more than others, so they tend to select a concentration in the subject of their interest. This happens in the second year of the program, so you have plenty of time to decide. Also the school can advise you whether recruiters in your area are looking for certain concentrations or want broadly educated candidates.<br>  <br>  Before you consider which MBA program is for you, consult the Official MBA Guide, a comprehensive free public service with more than 2,000 MBA programs listed worldwide. It allows you to search for programs by location (US, Europe, Far East, etc.), by concentration (finance, marketing, aviation management, health management, accounting, etc.), by type of program (full-time, distance learning, part-time, etc), and by listing your own criteria and preferences to get a list of universities that satisfy your needs. You can use the Guide to contact schools of your choice, examine their data, visit their web site, and send them pre applications. You can see lists of top 40 schools ranked by starting salaries of graduates, GMAT scores, and other criteria. It's the best service available at <a href="http://officialmbaguide.org." rel="nofollow">http://officialmbaguide.org.</a>|`|2646a4e9d6d4e936660d70ff922397f3aa	I wish I could be as positive about this as the other poster, but the past decade has been very difficult for this industry, and many are losing their jobs, not only due to the current economic downturn, but due to all kinds of problems which have been brewing for years.  I think you would do better to get a less specific MBA (I'm assuming you are in India, because only in the lesser schools there do they offer such specific MBAs; in most of the world you get an MBA in finance or marketing, and it can be transferred from one industry to another as the economy dictates).  You could then still work in that industry, if jobs are available by the time you graduate.  Your parents have good reason to worry.|`|nDLTXhugaa	Economy will revive within 2 years time. (It always does, according to the business cycle). Tell your parents because the economy will improve and the travel industry will improve exponentially and require more mangement workers to effieciently run that sector of business. Also they make pretty decent salary. What is more, tell your parents its because you like the job.

W3UYWpxiaa	It was one of the hardest weeks of my life.  I went to a college where I knew no one.  I was a biology major and I didn't want to be.  I really just wanted to transfer to the college my best friend was going to but my parents made me stay stick with it.  I'm so glad they did!  I did end up changing my major to education, which I love!  It is my passion!  I became friends with some amazing people who are always here for me.  <br>  <br>  That first week is hard!  College is a huge adjustment, but hang in there.|`|VR0h4L32aa	socialize the first week and get to know people~!|`|IddUYNR3aa	That won't last long! Smile and be willing to be open to new people. A lot of them are in the same boat as you and looking for new friends.<br>  You'll find some you like and some you don't. One thing about college is that there are lots of people and you'll be sure to find some at mixers, at the library (I always studied there), in a coffee shop.

CtqWRAcFaa	Untitled<br>  <br>  There were three of us in the family, if you didn’t count our dog Mitzi.  Our last name was Goldberg. We were Jews.   Although we weren’t religious, Ma took our customs seriously and celebrated every holiday.   <br>  <br>  I became the man of the house after my father died, just before my little sister Sarah started middle school.  I got a job as a baker's assistant.  I made 25 zloty a day.<br>  <br>  Even though life was hard, we found a way to keep on living and even ways to have fun.  But then everything changed.  September 1st, 1939 was a day I will never forget.   I can still recall my mother’s raspy voice trying to wake my sister up, and I remember finishing up my breakfast before I left for work. <br>  <br>  At around noon, we were attacked by Germans. Fighter planes rocketed back and forth; within minutes, we seemed to have lost already. In panic, I ran home, still wearing an apron and dusty with flour. Relieved that my village was still untouched, we stated packing anyway. We had to give Mitzi to a neighbor, figuring he would slow us down.<br>  <br>  Just two days later, we were confronted by German soldiers. I stared them right in the eyes. One of the soldiers took Sarah from my mother’s hand and dragged her to a truck crammed with other children. I punched him  so hard I dislocated my knuckles. The soldier stared back at me with the eyes of a tiger. Ma tugged my sleeve, signaling me to run. <br>  <br>  We ran as fast as we could, but my mother couldn’t keep up. The soldiers opened fire, and my mother froze. The Germans cuffed her, and dragged her to a different truck, just as crowded as the one that had swallowed Sarah. <br>  <br>  They went straight to the gas.<br>  <br>  A soldier motioned with his rifle for me to go back to the trucks, but I knocked him down and ran into the woods by the side of the road.  They fired at me but I was soon lost in the trees. <br>  <br>   After many days of travel by night and lying low during the day, I came to the border.  German soldiers were patrolling, but I timed their patterns and managed to slip across into Switzerland.<br>  <br>  I made my way to England, where I joined the RAF.  I served as a navigator in the bombing raids against German strongholds in France.  <br>  <br>  Once my plane was damaged by antiaircraft fire and we ditched in the English Channel.  We were picked up a few hours later by the Valiant, an American battleship.  The friendly sailors gave us dry clothes and hot meals.  When the Valiant returned to its British base,  I rejoined my unit.  The British government gave us medals.<br>  <br>  I'm proud I helped to defeat the Nazis, but I never saw my sister or my mother again.
