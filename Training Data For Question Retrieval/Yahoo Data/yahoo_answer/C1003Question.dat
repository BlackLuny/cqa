20090223025641AAYU8dy	Sports;Basketball	KING (I Own Alpha Wolf) - Why Do You Continue Going About?	w/ things you know nothing about. Saying, that Wade is/will always be better than Iverson when that is not the case at all?      Your arguments are:       1.) AI had a "supporting cast" when he went to the NBA Finals and still could not get it done. When everyone knows AI alone carried that wishy washy team all throughout the playoffs and into the Finals and it was Wade himself who had the "supporting cast" not AI.       2.) Wade has a Gold Medal and an NBA Finals MVP, and ring and AI doesn't. Well, that's because AI played on the same team in the Olympics with Stephon Marbury - a megalomaniac who has had troubles getting along w/ Iverson since they were drafted together. NBA Finals = AI played on a bruised rib and fractured fingers and still dropped 40+ on Kobe/Lue and the Lakers were superior to the Sixers that's why they lost they play defense - unlike the Mavs. AI still outscored Wade in the Finals and Shaq Finals MVP emotionally said even though Lakers won the real MVP is the season MVP Allen Iverson.      To elaborate on my facts....      Does, this look like AI has a supporting cast.       PG. ERIC SNOW - Are you kidding me Eric Snow?       SG. ALLEN IVERSON - 31.1 PPG, 2.5 SPG, 4.6 APG (Has had 7 APG) . In the Finals 35.6 PPG.       SF. GEORGE LYNCH - Was practically done    PF. TYRONE HILL - Who?       C. DIKEMBE MUTOMBO - You say he was an All-star this year and All-Defensive team. And that is help for AI. Well Dikembe spent half the year on the lowly Hawks and was not playing, like the old Mutombo he was aging. Then he was traded for Toni Kukoc = old, Nazr Mohammed = sucked, and Theo Ratliff = injured. And because AI had the team on top of the Atlantic even though Deke  was declining he got praise for how good the Sixers looked. In the Finals Shaq exposed his fragility and tore him a new a$$hole.11.7 PPG, 7.8 RPG, 2.5 BPG (in season). In Finals,        6. Aaron McKie - Who said before that Aaron McKie one who never defended and was named 6th Man of the year was enough help for AI. Well, he was named 6th Man of the Year because of the way AI carried the Sixers to the top of the East and all the open looks AI created when he drives. Aaron McKie had a stat line his 6th Man Award year of 11.7 PPG and 4.1 RPG. That is really unimpressive and bench players that year, like  Ron Artest scored 11.9 PPG, Brain Grant scored 15.2 PPG, and their were many more deserving players than McKie.       7. Raja Bell - Not the same and good player he is now    8. Kevin Ollie    9. Jumaine Jones -    10. Kevin Ollie   11. Todd McCulloch   12. Rodney Buford      *This team sucked!!!      The Heat on the other hand:       PG. JASON WILLIAMS - Great passer who can score a bit and toned down his game in Memphis, so he can play an effective championship style.        SG. DWYANE WADE - 27.2 PPG, 6.7 APG, 1.2 SPG. In the Finals 34.7 PPG.       SF. UDONIS HASLEM - A good player/ a hustler       PF. ANTOINE WALKER - Multiple time All-star, 20+ PPG player in Boston who had his moments for Miami.       C. SHAQUILLE O'NEAL - 20/9 that year and although he was not the same Shaq as before or now for that matter back then and struggled in the playoffs. He still averaged a double-double in the Finals and was a presence down low. Making it easier for Wade to dominate.       6. James Posey - An excellent defender & true 6th Man is no McKie       7. Gary Payton - HOF player that hit that big shot to force a game 4 down 2-1 and not 3-0.       8. Alonzo Mourning - HOF player, greatest Heat of all-time helped Miami with hustle and shot blocking tenacity.       9. Shandon Anderson - Good defender   10. Michael Doleac   11. Jason Kapono - Sharpshooter off bench   12. Derek Anderson - Vet leadership and good scorer      * Miami had help.      Get it, got it, good! AI is and will forever be better than Wade. Even today AI is better. If he were not in Detroit and a transition team he would be the same AI he always was better than Wade. Look at him closely still as fast and gifted as ever. Just needs a team that can transition itself and can compete for a title.

20090223025414AAfOzTu	Sports;Wrestling	Why can TNA fans never tell someone why they should "cross the line" without mentioning WWE?	They always have to compare something, "Well TNA does this but WWE doesn't." One thing I can say about WWE is that it stands on it's own. People can state why WWE is good without comparing it to something else.      But I think I do realize why TNA fans do this: there is not much good to say about TNA these days. So the fans have to distract people who ask the question by naming something they see wrong with WWE. Basically the only way to say something good about TNA is to say something bad about WWE

20090223031504AA4EOrZ	Sports;Basketball	Can Kobe Bryant defeat Dwight Howard or Shaq in a 1-on-1 game?	I believe that Kobe can't because he is going up a against CENTERS. He will get out rebounded, block, and most importantly he'll get posted-up.I say this becaus I know HS players that said it is almost imposible to beat a center in 1-1. You could hit 10 straight but onnce you miss and give up the rebound, you are ging to get post up all game long.   Even they believe that KOBE can't BEAT Shaq,Yao Ming,D.Howard,P.Gasol,or A.Bynumn in a 1-on-1 game.   If you say that 1-1 is not a real basketball game then you probably dont play basketball.Everybody considers it as a game, a way to decide who is better.

20090223024616AAR5qzR	Sports;Wrestling	Hmmm..lets have a WWE QUIZ (super duper easy) well kinda but not really kinda a challenge i think?	1.I had a great match with a great WWE wrestler. I was at wrestlemania. I though i won it, only to be called back to the ring. The match went on. I took all my frustration out on my opponent. Sadly he finally pinned me after doing his finisher. His finisher involved a kick to the head. WHO AM I..      2.I was the first WWE superstar to enter number 1 at the 30 man over the Rope at the Royal rumble and win the event.      3. I used to be an announcer for the WWE. One WWE superstar tested me to my limits, and from that point on i decided, that if they wanted to play i'd be ready. I am now a feared man in WWE. (i think he is) WHO AM I      4. I made my return to the WWE and the royal rumble. Everyone was shocked but very happy. I climbed the turnbuckle as soon as i entered, i jumped on kane putting the big man on his back. I then clotheslined nearly everyone in the ring. WHO AM I      5. I have made HISTORY in the Royal Rumble. I ran into the 30man over the top rope ring. Confident as ever, only to be tossed out of the ring after 1 or 2 seconds. Yes i have made history. WHO AM I      6. I tought by beloved brother how to do my finisher. At first he did it wrong but after i showed him he confidentally picked up the weakened opponent over his head and smashed him on the ground. WHO AM I   (soz that one was kinda crap)      7. I was betrayed..WWE title..tragedy WHO AM I      8. During my days of Tag Team..i had many great fights with the Hardy Boys, what was my partners name?      9.Whipped into the turnbuckles by BOTh of my opponents, one would then run and crouch just infront of me, the other one at the opposite turnbuckle, would run towards me and would leap of his partners back and fling his body at me.. What is this move called and who is move famous for it?      10.Which Tag Team partner would often say to his Tag team partner, GET THE TABLES'.      11. Which WWE superstar got absolutely mad when his tag partner said that someone said that they didnt know controversy.       Lucky Last.       12. When Matt and MVP were having their little competitons how did MVP cheat when they were seeing who could throw the footy through the tire the most times?       Well Hope you Do well?

20090223041740AApWVQb	Sports;Tennis	IN GOOD CONSCIENCE: dont we need more sportsmen with moral courage like venus williams?	Hey guys.   First of all, let me clarify this: I don’t have any political affiliation.   As you all might have heard, Venus Williams won the Dubai Tennis Championship.   But Im much more concerned with what she had to say during the post-match press conference.    http://www.google.com/hostednews/ap/arti...       As highly politicized as sports is, political values should NOT be mixed together with sports.   This is not the matter of right and wrong, or whose political view is upright and whose is not.   Sports are supposed to be played in the spirit of sportsmanship and brotherhood.   When politics come into the equation, these values are easily wiped off and that definitely does no good for sports.      My question is:   SHOULD SPORTS BE MIXED WITH POLITICS?      When Israeli athlete Shahar Peer was denied visa entry for the tournament due to alleged racial discrimination, I was deeply disheartened.   Tennis is a sport well known for its highly respectful manner.   This incident has tainted this clean reputation, for sure.   Luckily, Venus Williams came to the rescue with a highly commendable act by saluting Peer after the tournament.   Well it could have had more impact had she spoken up during the course of the tournament.   But just to stand up for the politically prejudiced against takes a lot of courage, and we have to credit Venus for that.      DON’T WE NEED MORE SPORTSMEN LIKE VENUS WHO HAVE THE MORAL COURAGE TO SPEAK UP FOR THE PREJUDICED?   With more athletes like her, sports will become a much better place than what it is today.   And this is likely to encourage more racial and political tolerance to the world, considering the massive effect sports have today.      Please put forth respectful arguments, rather than just answering ‘yes’ or ‘no’.      Regards   lightofwadowice

The paint as well was very nice, it even had a bar code on it with the antishock and warranty card attached to it.. I asked the vendor last time and he told me it was a real one and told me it was like 300$. Today I go to the same shop and another seller told me it was a 2nd grade racket, that it was reaaaaaaaaally close to the real thing, but it's not. I asked him if it was fake and he told me no, it's a 2nd grade racket. I'm like ok...... and proposed me 150$. I want to buy this racket to risk and see if It is playable or not, if I string it with expensive strings if it'll break or somthing, because I dont have 300$ and want to buy it from the other seller at 150$.   Do you think it's a fake one? I mean It looks real and maybe the second seller was wrong, and it turns out to be a real racket....

20090223072552AAOJUFc	Sports;Hockey	What is your opinion of the neutral zone trap?	Was listening to Blackhawks post-game on the radio, on the way home last night. Troy Murray was going off on a rant about the Minnesota Wild and the neutral zone trap. He called it "disgusting hockey". Critics have long said it's bad for the game, slows it down, and frankly makes for boring play. Minnesota (Lemaire) is criticized often for playing the trap. Aside from Lemaire and Minn. the trap was also harshly criticized in the 90's enough to the point that one thing the NHL did to counter it and open up play was rid the two-line pass rule.      I am no fan of this style of play but my opinion is if you want to be a good team you have to be able to counter the "trap". Using last night as an example sure it slowed Hawks from entering the zone but they still got about 45 shots on goal. It is boring in my opinion but if it works then why not use it?      Minnesota is just an example because they employ it often but your answer does not have to be tailored to that team or their game last night. What is your opinion on the use of the trap? Do you find it a necessary evil? Would you want to see it rid from the game? No wrong answers here... just looking for your opinion.

20090223060500AAKpxQs	Sports;Outdoor Recreation;Hunting	What is the best gun/perk setup for COD 5?	MP-40/Bouncing Betties, Flak Jacket, Overkill....and STG for secondary gun.  I don't believe there is any better setup. pretty much once you can get a drum for the MP-40 you are set....then the betties.  It's a great gun for short-medium range which is probly 90% of kills, and then if you do have over kill the STG has a lil' more range....but don't kid yourself people....MP40 with drum...i can kill 4-5 ppl without reloading...it'll save ur bobo. once i get a sniper put on my Grand i might change that secondary gun. doubt it though. the type 100 is also worth considering.

20090223073207AA75VsO	Sports;Running	Can I still be a good runner and run on my own?	I don't want to run for either of my high school teams anymore. I went through a really bad depression, and just lost the motivation to go back to any of those teams. I don't like the nastiness, the competition, or the coaches. . . really, anything about it there. Thinking about going back just makes me anxious, especially since I'd be under pressure to gain my "number one" position back that I "lost" when I was sick.       That's one of the major reasons I don't want to go back to that. I'm still not able to handle that kind of pressure. Running just isn't fun anymore.       I'd rather train and take it slow on my own. I have a whole year and a half to really get in shape for college running if I choose to go back to it then.      My plan would be to train hard every day, documenting my progress, and entering a bunch of local races year round to prepare myself and get my times down.      (Do note that I'm only going to run cross country in college, as the school I'm going to has a small cross country team.)       Question is, can I still be a runner without running for my school's team?

20090223051543AAM6mIf	Sports;Wrestling	Is Public perception of pro wrestling still an issue?	I found this article on the net i would like other peoples opinions      By OLY OLSEN - For SLAM! Wrestling             Cartoon by Donna Jean. CLICK HERE for a larger version of the cartoon.      The inconsistent public perception of pro wrestling is a very serious issue for former pro wrestlers as I recently found out when I was involved in an altercation in which I was forced to physically defend myself.      Upon retiring from pro wrestling, I entered the workforce in the regular world. This can be a dark journey that some wrestlers aren’t able to make. You don’t always get the same respect that you may be accustomed to. In fact, it has been my experience that some people just have to test you.      The altercation happened when a workplace bully could not intimidate me, and out of frustration, he assaulted me. Fortunately, I was able to defend myself effectively. As a result, I was terminated from the company. My firing became a case for arbitration, brought forth by a powerful labor union on my behalf.      The hearing was conducted by Mr. Thomas F. Levak who according to the University of Oregon’s Quarterly Newspaper is not only a veteran attorney and arbitrator but he is a member of the United States Martial Arts Hall of Fame as a result of his over 250 gold medals and trophies including 15 world masters titles.      Mr. Levak opened the hearing bragging about his accomplishments in the martial arts. During the hearing, the opposing attorney brought up the fact that I am a former pro wrestler and proceeded to portray me as a "tough guy" pro wrestler who goes around punching people. He was interrupted by Mr. Levak who said, "it doesn’t matter if Mr. Olsen is a former pro wrestler because not all pro wrestlers are good fighters." He had a smirk on his face when he made that statement and then proceeded to have a few laughs at the expense of pro wrestling. He also described details about pro wrestling that exposed the fact that he was a fan, even though he was mocking it.      One month later when Mr. Levak made the final decision on the case, he did an about face on the pro wrestling issue and ruled against us, largely because I am a former pro wrestler. In his final decision, he wrote, "Mr. Olsen’s professional wrestling knowledge, his demonstrated ability to assume a solid defensive posture, and his overall physical condition, all would have enabled him to easily back away from his attacker without endangering himself." I don’t lose sight of the fact that by making that statement, Mr. Levak is giving pro wrestling a lot of respect and I appreciate that, especially because he showed no respect in the hearing. Nonetheless, a Grand Master in the martial arts having the ludicrous notion that someone in good physical condition, who can assume a solid defensive posture, should not have the right to defend themselves is over shadowed only by Mr. Levak’s inconsistent perception of pro wrestling.      In the hearing, Mr. Levak used pro wrestling to get some laughs, implying that it was a joke. Then he used pro wrestling in the decision to rule against us, when he stated that my professional wrestling knowledge would have helped me, implying that it is serious business. We lost the decision, costing me and the labor union thousands of dollars.      A casual fan having inconsistent perceptions of pro wrestling hurts no one, but Mr. Levak is not a casual fan, he is an attorney and arbitrator making legally binding decisions based on his inconsistent perceptions of pro wrestling. These decisions affect people’s lives.      In my case, it cost me a lot of money. What price will be paid by the next pro wrestler in the same situation? Will pro wrestling be perceived as fake or real? Or will the decision be made by someone like arbitrator Thomas F. Levak who can’t make up his mind what he thinks. Either way, we know who pays the price.

20090223051607AAH2Dy9	Sports;Cricket	Bucknor a cheat or just incompetent?	There have been many posts today detailing Umpire Buckner's impending retirement.   Greatly respected in his prime as one of the top Umpires of the day, he has suffered a lot of criticism in the past few years.   The fiasco of the last World Cup final and the India tour to Australia come immediately to mind.      Does anyone honestly believe that the decisions called in Australia's favour were done maliciously?   Does anyone honestly believe he was bribed?   Or were the mistakes purely fatigue, age and eyesight related?      Remember Bucknor comes from the nation that were last regarded as world champions before Australia knocked them off their perch.   What reason would he have to call in Australia's favour?      Would he really jeopardise a lifetime of respect, to call in any nations favour?

This was 18 months ago and I am wanting to start getting fit. Im 30 years old and broke it playing football(soccer) when i got a nasty tackle. It still hurts occassionally- not much tho and the doc has said it is healed fine although i have a metal plate in my leg they have said to leave in and the tendons and muscles may take a bit longer to build up. I have put on 30lbs since i broke it and weigh 295lbs and am 6'2. I used to play as prop forward for my local rugby team years ago and am wanting to get back into it. Just want to hear from anyone who has suffered like this or knows a similar situation. How dangerous is it? the last thing i want is to break it again and be unable to walk for 6 months or have a permanent limp! If i wear ankle support and shin-pads how bad could it be?

20090223073928AAXHBsH	Sports;Water Sports	How can I coax my husband into going kayaking and doing more watersports?	I recently just took up kayaking and absolutely adore it.  But I miss having my husband there when I go. He says he will sometimes but is very hesitant.  He used to love the water but had a near drowning experience in his teen involving a canoe and no life vest. Would it be something simple as maybe taking him into a lake with no moving current. He goes tubing, but for some reason is really freaked about the kayak. I want to get into camping which he is into, I just don't want to go without my kayak. How can I help him overcome his fear?  Thank you for your help :)

20090223073354AA3zgPb	Sports;Running	A more relaxing and efficient way to run?	I don't want to run for either of my high school teams anymore. I went through a really bad depression, and just lost the motivation to go back to any of those teams. I don't like the nastiness, the competition, or the coaches. . . really, anything about it there. Thinking about going back just makes me anxious, especially since I'd be under pressure to gain my "number one" position back that I "lost" when I was sick.      That's one of the major reasons I don't want to go back to that. I'm still not able to handle that kind of pressure. Running just isn't fun anymore.      I'd rather train and take it slow on my own. I have a whole year and a half to really get in shape for college running if I choose to go back to it then.      My plan would be to train hard every day, documenting my progress, and entering a bunch of local races year round to prepare myself and get my times down.      (Do note that I'm only going to run cross country in college, as the school I'm going to has a small cross country team.)      Question is, can I still be a runner without running for my school's team?

We played a game years ago and it was fun, but I don't remember "exactly" how it was made and I want to play it this summer at our big family Fourth of July party.  I think it was two deck posts with rope handles and each player put their right foot on one post and their left foot on the other and used rope handles to hold on/lift as their team tried to walk quickly without falling...to the finish line.  has anyone ever played this?  How do we make it?  Is it deck posts?
