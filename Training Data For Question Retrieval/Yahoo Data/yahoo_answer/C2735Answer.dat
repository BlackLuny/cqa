cY8DgJv5aa	I think she's a beautiful dog.  I don't know much about boxers, so I don't think my rating would be of much value.  I wish I could see her face a bit more, but from that angle, I'd give her a 10.  She looks very healthy to me.|`|uNRvZWifaa	10 she's gorgeous! I normally tend to like male boxers more but you got a good one lol she's beautiful!|`|280d96ad7b5e9ffad03a34a66cac5db0aa	I tend to dislike adult Boxers, but awww, she's a cute puppy. I'd give her an 8, I'd definitely want to cuddle her.|`|D1beU6MPaa	I used to breed Boxer's and have had many of them in the show ring. So I do know what to look for when judging them. This same question came up not too long ago with a very similar picture of a Boxer. From what I can see, she is just adorable, but to give you a very honest opinion, I would need to see pictures of more angles of her. A front view, the other side view and a back view. I stated this in my answer to the other poster who ask this question, and he sent me more pictures. I gave him a very honest answer. Even though his dog was not show quality, the only thing that really matters is that he and his family love him. That's the real answer. I think Boxer's are just the greatest!|`|gJlxZdL5aa	I think she is beautiful and I love her markings.<br>  <br>  I give her a 10 (thats the best right)

Is there any way you could bring it back to the mother to be nursed for 2 more weeks?  <br>  <br>  If not, you should get a kitten baby bottle from the pet department of Wal Mart or a pet store.  Put the kitten formula into the bottle and feed the kitten like it is a real baby.  Feed it at least 4 times a day with the bottle for the next 2 weeks.  If the kitten still won't eat, take it to a veterinarian, as there could be a blockage in the kidneys or intestine.|`|LFeEoHj3aa	When I first got my kitten, he was 6 weeks old too. I had no clue how young and inexperienced he really was. BUT...ANYWAY...Mine wouldn't poop or pee either for the first day...but then he did, and I was relieved...he will on his on time...HE CAN'T HOLD IN IT FOREVER!!! =) Hope I helped...|`|d6d7a4423b15ef5c76be0e2b39ab81c8aa	She is a bit young to be away from mum yet.  Probably very frightened and missing her tremendously.  Give her time and 'kitten' food (whiskas or something.)  You could try getting her to lick it off your fingers - always a good bonding trick!|`|QaHEGl7Paa	When my kittens were little like that I put a little bit of moist kitten food on a plate and eventually they would eat it. However, if your kitten doesn't eat or go to the bathroom soon I would call your vet for advice.
ld2vmypNaa	Ghost shrimps at Petco are 1.29 here in Calif a piece.<br>  <br>  They NEED calcium and protein they get it from the fish meat and the fish bones. Drop 20 or 30 or so feeder guppies or small goldfish (r minnows they maybe a bit fast for babies at first just drop in the tank and watch them disappear in a few days.<br>  ***They can have Ghost shrimpes,  garden worms which I collect after a good rain and dump them un the pond, also meal worms, snails, crickets, flies, crayfish small frogs, slugs, tadpoles, dragon flies and anything that moves, but only as a treat.<br>  They need leafy greens Romaine, Butter lettuce. (Iceberg and cabbage are bad for them, any other leafy greens will do) for vitamin A that they need at least 4 to 5 times a week.<br>  They love grapes and strawberries and squash , apples, cut up for them in pieces.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/29035692@N03/sets/72157612827773738/" rel="nofollow">http://www.flickr.com/photos/29035692@N0...</a>|`|EDOxXdcoaa	Sure, but I would suggest more than just one. Oh, and just a heads up.. Shrimp can dart out of open tanks and onto the floor if/when startled.<br>  <br>  The price of ghost shrimp will vary from store to store but you can expect to pay between $0.10-$0.25 each in most places.|`|FYISPUt4aa	Feeder fish are the main diet, but shrimps are ok for a small turtle. once the turtle gets bigger you'll need bigger fish for it.
kOEX3MRraa	I'm an eventer and i use Ariat water proof paddock boots. It takes awhile to break them in but once they do break in, they are perfectly comfortable. I can wear them ALL day from 5am to 9pm without having sore feet. They arent thick and bulky and my favorite to ride in because you can feel the stirrup and your feet/ankles arent bound up, they are free to movement but they give the right support. These boots take a ton of abuse from the paddock to the field to the saddle. They will keep your feet dry in mud and water BUT if the mud or water is deeper than the top of your laces, expect to get your socks a little wet because the water will seep through the laces holes. If you want them stylish I would recommend some nice half chaps, paddock boots look best with half chaps (and dont be afraid to mix and match colors, my half chaps are black and my boots are brown), or another choice if you want to look fancier buy some Ariat field boots, these take longer to break in than any boot I've had but they are worth the hours of breaking them in, they keep their shape, they are comfortable (when you get the right size) and they give great support to your ankles and calves. Another pair of boots I LOVE to wear around the barn when i work is my Ariat Pro Baby boots (i dont ride in them because i'm an eventer but If i were a western rider i would). They are a taller version of the Fat Baby. These boots break in REALLY quick are again really comfortable (i wear them all day long). They all take a lot of water and barn abuse (but they aren't waterproof so be prepared, waterproof them if you plan to be tromping through alot deep mud and water. As a guidleline I would go with Ariat boots for work and riding because they are REALLY comfortable and they take anything!!<br>  <br>  my paddock boots ( i wear On Course half chaps only because my Ariat half chaps are too tall for me):<br>  <a href="http://ariat.com/products_detail.aspx?pcid=8&cid=1&scid=9&pid=464" rel="nofollow">http://ariat.com/products_detail.aspx?pc...</a><br>  <br>  my work boots (I have the black and aqua ones):<br>  <a href="http://ariat.com/products_detail.aspx?pcid=9&cid=2&scid=5&pid=419" rel="nofollow">http://ariat.com/products_detail.aspx?pc...</a><br>  <br>  My field boots:<br>  <a href="http://ariat.com/products_detail.aspx?pcid=8&cid=1&scid=12&pid=55" rel="nofollow">http://ariat.com/products_detail.aspx?pc...</a><br>  <br>  You can buy all of these at DoverSaddlery.com, except the Pro Baby boots.<br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|42FueJ0naa	I've had two pairs of Muck Boot Co. boots. I've ridden in them also but I don't really advise it because they're kind of fat. haha But honestly, I don't think you should have a pair of boots that you use for mucking and riding. All the crap/pee will tear up the leather quicker if it's your riding boots. I don't know if the boots I mentioned will be in the UK though but they might have a website.|`|lVymqalqaa	I have been riding  for 4 years now and i am 12 yrs. old. A great classic for riding mucking, ect., are Ariat boots. Ariats are EXTREMELY comfy, they do not need to be broken into, and are stylish. They are a little on the pricy end, but they'll get the job done. If you have any questions about horse riding boots, etc., please tell me.|`|zBLIqCyWaa	if you ride western get Ariat fat babys they rock!!

I got my boots about 2 years ago.  I got them way to big for me so they would fit in the future.  I wear them mucking stalls.  I where them practice riding english and western.  I wear them showing western.  I wear them feeding horses.  I wear them even in the snow.  I wore them when I had to stand up all day for judging at this team judging competition.  You get the point.  You can wear them any where and they are so comfortable!  WAY more comfortable than my old boots.  So I have had these boots for two years and I wear them so much and I am still wearing them to shows today.  We clean all the muck off of them and they still look great!  I got them 2 years ago when they were in style and still almost all the people I know have Ariat Fat Babys.  THESE BOOTS ROCK AND I WOULD SUGGEST THEM TO ANYONE!<br>  <br>  On the other hand, if you just ride english, I would just get paddock boots or something. <br>  <br>  When I got my Ariat Fat babys they costed about $95 on sale at tractor supply.

They wont last long.

They have cute patterns on them. Plus, they're super easy to clean- you just squirt them off. You can't ride in them, but if you had to go someone after working, atleast they'd look cute. (: And if you have to walk through mud, your pant legs will be protected. =D I love mine. I keep my riding boots in my box underneath my saddle so I just go in the tack room and change shoes and put on half chaps.<br>  <br>  Again, I advise you not to work in leather paddock boots.

d6d7a4423b15ef5c76be0e2b39ab81c8aa	Husky is confused.  Gabby smells funny, has been acting strangely and is now paying him less attention.  On top of all that his humans have taken him to the vet and caused him hurt and now his insides feel funny.<br>  <br>  The sooner she allows him to meet the kittens and accept them into the pride the better - BUT as the alfa male he is likely to eat the kittens!  Are they his?  Even if they are, he may eat them anyway.<br>  <br>  Try to keep them apart for a bit longer.  Husky needs some time and space to get his head screwed back on.  They will be okay eventually.  <br>  <br>  Try putting the kitten bedding (smelling of them and Gabby) in places that Husky will find them and watch his reaction.  If he goes for the kill then make sure he stays separated for a while longer - if he goes for rubbing etc then he will probably take to the kittens - but not immediately.  <br>  <br>  Be careful and good luck.|`|H9rAj3fPaa	If your male cat has been fixed, I see no reason why he should still be so aggressive.

2UDbOpxTaa	It's kitten behaviour. Apparently they're re-enacting kneading their mother's nipples for milk. That's why they do it to your lap as well - they like to treat you like their mum as it makes you seem more affectionate and makes them feel secure.|`|Rw7gi86Naa	This behavior is called "milk-treading." When you relax and sit quietly, you're giving your cat the same signal he got from his mother when he was a kitten - that his mother was ready to let him suckle.  A nursing kitten instinctively uses his paws to draw out the milk, gently pushing on his mother's stomach to increase the milk flow.  When older cats behave this way, it's a good sign that they're happy, content, and probably recalling their kitten hood.|`|L4Bnecwoaa	I remember asking this when I was little and my mum told me that it's cos they're trying to make you more comfortable to sit on! lol random, and completely not the real reason, but I think it kinda makes sense.<br>  <br>  One of my cats does it to everything he sits on, whether it's a cushion, a teddy, the sofa or me! and it flippin hurts sometimes! lol|`|iZ2J85Hpaa	It's what cat would do if they lived in the wild.

280d96ad7b5e9ffad03a34a66cac5db0aa	It's good that he sits automatically, why would you want to change that? It shows he is responsive and focused. If he sits without being asked, just thank him and otherwise ignore it. <br>  <br>  The fact that he knows "sit" has nothing to do with teaching him other tricks. You teach him other tricks the same way as with any other dog. For instance, you teach him "down" by slowly bringing the treat down to the floor. He should follow it. You may have to wait a few moments for the rest of his body to actually hit the floor; as soon as it does, you praise and treat. There are tons of other dog tricks, from "bang bang" to "high-five." That's too much to describe here, just Google "dog tricks" (or some variation) and you'll find plenty of helpful websites.<br>  <br>  Also, if your dog is overly food-dependent, so you know, you're supposed to eventually phase out the treat. Make the treat random; sometimes, give him three. Sometimes, give him none. (In the beginning stages of learning a trick, always give at least one treat, though. Once he grasps the concept, vary the reward.) Over time, gradually, you can give him fewer and fewer treats. Always keep it a surprise, though, so occasionally do give him a treat or two to keep him guessing and motivated.<br>  <br>  Oh! And you shouldn't be showing him a treat from the beginning. That teaches him to obey *only* because he knows he's going to get a food reward, so he has no reason to obey in regular situations where you aren't waving a treat in front of his nose.|`|uNRvZWifaa	slowly progress don't do it for to long he'll get bored with it. Start by teaching him to lay since he has sit down pat. Tell him "lay" in a firm but not mean voice and take his paws and lay him down then give him the treat and tell him GOOD BOY make a big deal out of it. he'll catch on and do it on his own after a while. some dogs take longer to train then others like my boxer stubborn as heck but my mutt learned to sit lay shake and jump in a day lol GOOD LUCK|`|rjXAPafhaa	Start giving him praise as his reward instead of always a treat.

Based on his nose and legginess, I don't think it's rottweiler contributing to his makeup; my first thought was a Dobermann pinscher (using Deutsch spelling) mix.<br>  <br>  Here's a good example of a rottweiler puppy: <a href="http://www.germanrottweiler.org/5month.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://www.germanrottweiler.org/5month.j...</a><br>  <br>  Here is a Dobermann puppy: <a href="http://cdn-www.dailypuppy.com/media/dogs/anonymous/magnum_doberman10.jpg_w450.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://cdn-www.dailypuppy.com/media/dogs...</a><br>  <br>  And here is a Dobermann mix dog:  <a href="http://www.pupcity.com/images/adpics/07319223847793_1.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://www.pupcity.com/images/adpics/073...</a><br>  <br>  But that white on the legs and the ear carriage - those ears look like typical pit bull-type ears to me, or perhaps some kind of greyhound influence - but you'd see more greyhound in his structure than just the ears and probably a snipey nose.  <br>  <br>  So I'm going to guess that the dog has a lot of Dobermann influence, some pit bull-type, and something else I can't put my finger on.  He sure is a cute, though!  And no, do not touch his ears.  He is perfect the way God made him.  And definitely past the age of cropping.

oDVx7nSxaa	No, Pepto is no longer safe to give cats since it's been reformulated.  You need to figure out *why* they have diarrhea, and treat them for that.  Rice will work for dogs, but not for cats.  Are they indoor/outdoor?  If they go outside, they could have eaten something they shouldn't have.  They could have worms, or coccidia.  It may be their food not agreeing with them.  There are so many possibilities, and really there is nothing you can give them to eat that will stop it, as whatever is causing it in the first place will still be there.  Cats don't get "24 hour stomach viruses" like people do.|`|K0uTjeWiaa	No pepto bismol Not ok<br>    You do not give cats rice. they are carnivores<br>   Get some acidoupholous from a health food store and sprinkle about 1/8 a teaspoon into the food each day|`|4IZHdhJQaa	Giving cats any type of grain isn't going too help, they don't have an enzyme in their stomach too process grain so it more then likely made it worse.<br>  Don't give him the Pep-to!<br>  Might be a good idea to get them vet checked just too make sure there's nothing going on with their stomach's.<br>  <br>  Good Luck, i hope they get better|`|hm8QR95Kaa	Pepto is bad for pets. maybe call the vet if you have a good one they will give you sajestions.

024lJBZ4aa	For obedience:  You will enter Novice A, since you've never titled a dog before.  <br>  <br>  The elements for the Novice routine in UKC is: <br>  Heel on Leash (The Judge calls the heeling pattern, there will be a couple of sits, fast, slow, about turns..same for the off leash heel)<br>  Figure 8 on Leash<br>  Stand for Exam<br>  Heel off Leash<br>  Recall over the High Jump<br>  Honor down (your dog does a long down in the ring, while the "working" dog is doing it's heel on leash & figure 8.<br>  Long sit (your dog will be in a line with other dogs doing a sit stay for 1 minute)<br>  Qualifying score is 170 and above (highest score is 200) you must perform at least 50% of each exercise.<br>  <br>  For Rally obedience:  You will enter Novice A.<br>  You will perform the exercises that are on the signs.  For novice, there will probably be about 11-15 stations.  <br>  <br>  For Agility:  Again, you will enter Novice A<br>  your dog will have to perform in a safe manner the jumps, A-Frame, dog walk, see-saw.<br>  <br>  You do not want to be unprepared when you enter the ring, be it obedience, agility or rally.  People train for a good year or more before they enter the obedience ring, plus they go to matches to make sure their dog can perform the exercise in a show setting without be scored and where you can make corrections.<br>  <br>  edit:<br>  <br>  For the Recall over High:  you leave your dog on a sit stay or wait (whatever you use), you walk to the opposite side of the jump and call your dog over.  Your dog should take the jump and sit directly in front of you.  The Judge will then tell you to finish your dog.  You then give the command for your dog to "finish" which means it goes back into heel position.  BTW, the jump has a steward standing at each end of the jump.<br>  <br>  For the Honor Down, you will leave your dog where the judge tells you, she'll then tell you to "down your dog", then "Leave your dog".  You down your dog and walk away to the other end of the ring.  The Working Dog will do it's Heel on Leash & Figure 7 pattern.  The judge can choose to have the Working Dog pass behind your dog.  The judge will then tell you to return to your dog.  The dog has to stay in the down position until the Judge says "Exercise Finished".  You then leash your dog and leave the ring.<br>  <br>  For the Long Sit exercise.  You will enter the ring with other handlers and their dogs in Number Order.  It will be set up in a line.  You take the leash off the dog and your armband, you place both behind the dog with the number showing.  Your dog should be set up in heel position.  The Judge will say:<br>  "This is the Long Sit exercise, are you ready?  Everyone will say "ready".  Judge will then say "Sit your dog", you'll tell your dog to sit.  Judge will say "Leave your dog".  You will then step away from your dog and stand across the ring.  It will be timed for 1 minute.  If your dog:  lays down, stands up, walks away, you will be disqualified.|`|PM23RDycaa	Obedience -Obedience events test the training of dogs as they perform a series of exercises at the command of their handler. There are several levels of competition, ranging from basic commands such as "sit," "come" and "heel" to scent discrimination and directed retrieves over jumps. The classes are further divided by the experience of the handler as well. All dogs start their competition with a perfect score of 200, and points are deducted according to the performance of dog and handler. Obedience events offer an opportunity for the handler and dog to form a special bond of trust unequaled in other events. <a href="http://www.ukcdogs.com/WebSite.nsf/WebPages/DogObedience" rel="nofollow">http://www.ukcdogs.com/WebSite.nsf/WebPa...</a><br>  <br>  Agility - Obstacle course <a href="http://www.ukcdogs.com/WebSite.nsf/WebPages/DogAgility" rel="nofollow">http://www.ukcdogs.com/WebSite.nsf/WebPa...</a><br>  <br>  Rally is new for the UKC so it hasn't got its on section on the site just yet.<br>  Rally Obedience - Rally Obedience is an uninterrupted performance by the dog and handler without direction from the judge. The arrangement of the exercises found in Rally Obedience are randomly chosen and unlike the rigid set of exercises found in traditional obedience, the team is evaluated on a more natural approach to the performance.

When I got started in conformation, I went to several shows first to learn some tips, talk to other handlers, and watch the handlers work their dogs. I would suggest you do the same before entering anything. Classes would help too, but I definitely understand that their is just not enough time sometimes. I have included the sites for many of the clubs - they will tell you all you want to know about what goes on in these different sports. There are different levels. In rally you start with Novice until you earn your novice titles. When you get up into the higher levels it will be off leash. In agility there are many different types of runs (standard, snooker, jumpers, tunnels, etc.). In beginning agility standard there shouldn't be any weave poles. There are lots of different things to learn about each, I think it's great that you want to get into these fun sports!

H06PtiIAaa	yea feeding things seperate is key, as everything eats different things.<br>  <br>  corals are mostly photosynthic but some like the sun corals and LPS will like pytoplankyon and zooplankton mixes. kent makes good products.<br>  <br>  The fishes depending on the species will eat different things, some more algae based and some more meat based.<br>  <br>  inverts are generally good without specific feeding.|`|h4wNRqf9aa	i generally feed everything seperate, that way i can tell what's actually eating and how much<br>  <br>  i also never feed my mobile inverts (shrimps crabs etc) there is plenty of either leftover food or feces for them to feast on. they don;t need much food at ALL to continue living healthily.<br>  <br>  corals are too braod to cover all at once...<br>  sps generally need sparse feedings of very fine foods<br>  LPS usually eats bigger foods even less often<br>  i've never fed my soft corals, ever...<br>  clams, gorgonians, and sponges i bottle feed (as well as SPS)... take a 2L bottle and cut the very bottom off of it.. place it over the thing you're feeding and let it bathe in phytoplankton for a while.. you can just move it to the next place while trying to keep most of the green in the bottle, that way you're not adding a but load to the tank, but honestly it's pretty hard, if not impossible, to overfeed a sponge or clam
w4DIPHf1aa	Nothin wrong with that tank at all...<br>  <br>  <br>  just don't drop anything in it...if you don't have grabers your getting your face wet going in...lol<br>  <br>  <br>  Enjoy that beast.|`|h4wNRqf9aa	AGA is a reliable brand, i like them alot<br>  <br>  <br>  was there any specific question about the set up or just is "am i on the right track" type of thing?|`|qeOlkRM0aa	i had one without the built in overflow. its a good starter tank. :-)<br>  Enjoy.

tPGxPDvBaa	You can try giving bottled/purified water instead of tap but there really isn't any way with long beards. Between their saliva & food & water, they become easily stained.  Show dogs have their beards wrapped up & chalked to appear white.|`|FVD1tpLeaa	you probably won't be able to keep them pristine white, as they'll be wet a lot, due to either drooling or drinking.  What you can do to keep them clean though is a good shampoo.  Spa Lavish makes a Blueberry Facial shampoo.  It's great for lessening staining, and it's tearless and safe to use on the face.|`|TTI1M4fVaa	Peroxide helps wonders on cleaning any area that has something on it. We use it if the dogs get a little blood on them during a surgery or when we are putting in a catheter. Just squirt some on their beard and use a paper towl to wipe it clean.|`|3O6CTb3saa	Have u tried Dawn dish washing soap?  I use that on my dogs beards and just make sure to rinse it out good.  The last resort is to take some peroxide and wipe it through. Then rinse well.  Hope that helps.
b6400b04a0e3413ba30570ad0aa8cd2baa	Well you could check your guinea pig(or whichever one you didn't think was pregnant) and see if she has milk. If so then she may be the mom. As for why the babies always alone maybe both the females know something's wrong with it. A lot of times when an animal gives birth and somethings wrong with the babies they just stop taking care of it or kill it. I guess it proves the saying that only the strong survive. It's really sad but it the mom's instinct to not allow a sickly baby to live so it can't breed any more sickly babies and ruin the species. I hope everything works out for this little baby. Good Luck|`|WQno7VwGaa	well if its not the real mother than dont force it, put it with the real mommy
Rw7gi86Naa	First realize that you cannot make a cat sleep when you do, but you can change their behavior. Many times in the morning they will meow like crazy because you get up and feed him, (hoping that will make him shut up) and go back to bed. They meow, then you get up and feed them, pet them or play--whatever you think they want. This is why they meow again later, because they know they will get a reaction from you. This is called conditioning.  So, you need to stop reacting; just ignore it.<br>  <br>  More info:<br>  Felines are nocturnal, (naturally more active at night or early morning hours).  They sleep a lot, (16 hours) mostly during the day.  When dusk or dawn sets in, their instinct tells them to hunt.  It is also the most productive time of the day to catch prey.<br>  <br>  When you compare the cats sleeping habits and human sleeping habits, it’s actually no wonder when some felines are perfectly happy to wake us up at 3 am and ask for food or for entertainment.  We probably don't appreciate it as much and it can become quite a strain when those early wake-ups happen regularly.<br>  <br>  - Schedule a vigorous play session, (at least 15 minutes) before you go to sleep, then feed the cat. Several play sessions throughout the day will help also. A cat that is all worn out from playing, and has a full belly will be less likely to bother you when you're asleep. Also provide toys that your cat can amuse himself with alone. Make sure to rotate toys so he doesn’t get bored.<br>  - Don't be tempted to get up and play with your cat in the middle of the night when it demands it.  If you do, he will make a habit of it and won't understand when you suddenly refuse. Remember, consistence in your behavior will be more effective in changing their behavior.<br>  - Don't feed him as soon as you get up. Do your morning routine, such as make coffee, pet him and then feed him. This way he won’t think you got up only to feed him.<br>  - If ignoring doesn't work, invest in an automatic feeder that opens at the requested early time, the cat will help himself and won't bother you as much, or, if you're feeding dry food, fill up the bowl just before you go to bed, so that there is still plenty left for the morning.<br>  - Keep your bedroom door shut, so that your cat can't physically wake you up.<br>  - If he starts meowing and scratches the door, try to ignore it and don't react, after a while your cat will figure out that meowing and pestering you doesn't help and it will retire.<br>  - Be aware that any reaction of you, positive or negative, will actually encourage your cat to go on with the attention seeking behavior.<br>  - Be strict!|`|d6d7a4423b15ef5c76be0e2b39ab81c8aa	DO NOT respond to the waking up!  It is attention seeking and she will keep it up if she gets a response from you.  It will become a permanent habit (take it from one who never gets a good night's sleep!)  My cat also plucks my rug (not carpet, not furniture etc, the rug and only the rug) as she knows this will elicit a response from me (normally a yell and a slipper.)<br>  The other behaviour is interesting - perhaps she is broody or expecting?|`|db2025b820a04c944fcf1ff93dc0966aaa	Ah bless, my cat does not wake me up but she does like to sleep right next to my face, she also likes to collect small fury toys, she runs round with them in her mouth making funny noises and then hides them in the corner of rooms, i guess she is just playing mum! I have not caught her trying to feed them yet though!|`|afec6d005fb7698534de7994ff84613caa	I have a cat who did that, he meowed and was so whiny.  He did outgrow it.  I don't know a cat who does the latter, mine never have, but it sounds so cute! :))|`|msCr4kHHaa	well i had a cat that would do that what i would do before i would go to bed i would play wiht the cat for a good hour and when it became tired i would either put him on my bed or my pillow and he would stay asleep because he was so tired.|`|mFa5ZDtcaa	She wants attention. She will learn to lie down and sleep instead of prowling.|`|f1JS4QDyaa	totally normal. She will grow put of waking you up.  My cats liked to hoard hair ties too. :)
IgjfBRxwaa	What kind of food do you feed them?<br>  <br>  Two of our cats got a UTI with Calcium Oxalate crystals (which is what makes the UTI hurt so badly).<br>  <br>  UTI's can time and time again be linked to dry food. The FDA doesn't really regulate what goes into animal foods, and as a result a lot of plasticides and other harmful things end up in there as fillers.<br>  <br>  Once we started our cats on a canned fish (the oil in fish is really good for them, omega three will help fur and skin problems and the fish itself is healthier because it provides a better source of protein and gets them off the food that created the crystals to begin with) and tomato sauce (the tomato sauce changes the pH and helps to dissolve the crystals). Make sure that they have plenty of water and try to keep them off of meat until the UTI goes away. Meat has been linked in both rats and humans (I don't see any tests on dogs or cats were done) to worsen UTI's.

03ec65bf77c70de35e61bf195676e487aa	I love animals, too.  They accept you for what you are.  They don't care if you're rich or poor, beautiful or ugly, whatever you are is fine with them.  And all you have to be is be decent to them.  I got my first cat when I was 6 years old.  I found it in the street and carried it home from school and told my mother it followed me.  I've had dogs and cats ever since and I'm 75 years old.<br>  It's nice to have friends but you must be careful of what you say because they can be very judgmental.  Not your pet friends.|`|rQlzfHqraa	You are so right. I say one can always trust an animal as a lion acts like a lion and a lamb is always a lamb. One can never know what a human is, a lamb or acting like a lion.|`|fBMSIlSIaa	Its perfectly normal. Ya know? Animals are always there to cuddle and listen to you. Some people can be so annoying and selfish and everything above. I love animals better too, its not weird in any way at all.

I think everybody feels the same way.Because I know I do! Animals are my life. Nobody should be able to make fun of you! That's just retarded. It's none of their business what you like or not, and they shouldn't be able to make fun of you for being proud,and yourself. Animals are amazing creatures, and we should be thankful everyday, that they share this world with us! I would love to be an animal! They are amazing. Of course, animals are better then people. I don't even know what our population has become! Animals are so much better, and those abused animals deserve a million chances, it's not even their fault. It's the dumb humans fault! I love animals! And don't let those people bring you down!!
pH1Qz6lAaa	Hi, Cockatoos are great birds, but since you don't want another one try an Eclectus Parrot, Macaws, preferrably Mini Macaws. I suggest you look into and Eclectus parrot, or a Hahn's Macaw. Eclectus Parrots are very nice birds, the males are green, and the females are red. They are one of the only birds you can tell male apart from female. They are pretty expensive. Running between 800-1400 U.S. dollars. <br>  <br>  Hahns Macaws are nice birds also. They run from 600-850 U.S. Dollars usually. They can be loud at times, but are easier to take care of than large macaws. The Hahns Macaw is a mainly green birds with white around the eyes. Here are photos of each bird<br>  <br>  Hahns Macaw:<a href="http://www.avesint.com/images/hm7-16-07.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://www.avesint.com/images/hm7-16-07....</a><br>  <br>  <br>  Eclectus Parrot:<a href="http://www.viewpoints.com/images/review/2007/221/18/1186701776-8592_full.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://www.viewpoints.com/images/review/...</a><br>  <br>  Female Eclectus on left, Male on right.|`|Czh1fbQgaa	Cockatoos are beautiful, but not for the faint of heart! They are some of the most demanding... and LOUD birds! They can also outlive people, so you will be with it for the rest of your life most likely. I like goffins cockatoos best as they are sweet, not as demanding, and slightly smaller (but still pretty big). Some other birds are<br>  <br>  African greys- lots of people like them b/c they are the smartest birds out there, but I haven't met one that didn't try to take my finger off.<br>  <br>  Amazons- absolutely georgeous and really smart.<br>  <br>  Macaws! I LOVE blue-and-gold macaws. They like to cuddle and are so beautiful. The red ones are more high strung, so are the militaries.<br>  <br>  Go to birdchannel.com and there is a breed search and you can look at all kinds of breed profiles.|`|1tOr2qLAaa	I have a Goffins Cockatoo, they are very high energy birds, mine is a funny little bird, but he screams his head of the minute I leave the room. He does talk quite a bit.  I wouldn't recommend a Goffins as your first big bird. I have a African Grey that is just great, other than the fact he won't talk. He is sweet, not demanding, and not noisy. He just wants to sit on my shoulder. Just remember the bigger the bird, the more noise, the larger the cage, the more expense, more toys.  Do your research  and really check out the bird you think you might want.  Good Luck and I hope you find the right friend.|`|NQGpw0x4aa	I have two cockatoos and an african gray. don't get me wrong, i love them all. but every bird is different. none will have the same personality, even if they are the same species or have the same genes (my cockatoos have the same parents and are polar opposites). be prepared to have you bird outlive you. many birds are "one person" animals. So if you have a boyfriend/husband/child/or even friends around regularly, your bird may not respond in a positive manner to them. and may get jealous of the attention they get. i'd suggest going to an exotic pet store that hand raises their birds and ask questions and get advice. they'd be happy to help. also, when you get your bird, get a hatchling, not an adult. that way it hasn't picked up any bad habits from other handlers or customers.|`|SuO5jPpuaa	You might want to look at an African Gray. They are not as big as a cockatoo, but they are very intelligent. They mimic sounds and can mimic a person's voice too.<br>  I have owned a cockatoo,a blue and gold macaw,a scarlet macaw, a green wing macaw,an African Gray, and lots of the small birds. The African gray is my favorite.|`|jW3apvpVaa	i highly recommend an amazon parrot for you! They come in large sizes, but also have smaller variations if you might reconsider getting a smaller bird. <br>   <br>  Pros:<br>  -less loud than other large parrots.<br>  Don't get me wrong ALL parrots are loud, even parakeets, but in my opinion the cockatoos are the loudest and most frequent screamers.<br>  <br>  -highly intelligent<br>  Again, all parrots are very smart but with amazons you can see them trying to please you and make you happy. (To me, cockatoos have this quality also) They are also very easy to make talk.<br>  <br>  -affectionate<br>  Right under the cockatoo/macaws, these are some of the most co-dependant birds i have ever seen and if you don't have 3 or more hours to spend with it dont even think about buying one. (with cockatoos, macaws, and other birds larger than amazons need even more time spent with them.)<br>  <br>  -Tend to be out-going<br>  They are more likely to enjoy new situations like going to the store, or riding in the car.<br>  <br>  -colorful<br>  Although most are primarily green, amazons can come in a variety of colors. (like the blue front, yellow naped, double yellow headed, ect)<br>  <br>  Cons.<br>  -can be VERY co-dependant and are very likely to scream/feather pluck if not given alot of time. (this goes are all parrots. The smaller the bird the more independent they get, the larger they get the more they need your love. This does not count for Pacific Parrotlets who are small but very large parrot-like.)<br>  <br>  <br>  If Amazons don't interest you i also think you should look into Eclectus parrots. Don't let the name fool you, they are not some extremely rare bird. Eclectus are just less well known than others. (pronounced Eack-leck-tus)<br>  <br>  Let us know if you decide! And email me for any questions.<br>  :)|`|Y8dL7M66aa	you should get a parite bird they keep you company they tlak they are pretty and colorful so that is what i would pick<br>  <br>  ps. im on my brothers yahoo answer thing and im a girl
3uYEO9oaaa	if you want it to talk its better and easier to tame if there is only one  but if ur not spending a lot of time with it you should buy two as they are very social animals and like company also if you do get two ur better with male and female or two males dont put two females together if your only getting one i found males easier to tame and more social than females only downside is that they can be very messy as there not toilet trained <br>  <br>  training takes patience first couple of weeks they will probably want nothing to do with you and run away but if you keep at it they make great pets|`|AA11436163	They're fun to have around.  They love attention.  If you spend at least 3-4 hours a day with one then you should buy two.  When I say spend time with it, that means in the same room, not constantly with it.  Some are easier to train than others.  We have one that is friendly as can be and another one that doesn't like people.  They can learn to talk.  Ours have said a few words, but we were not able to understand them.  But we haven't really spent a lot of time trying to train them.  Go to<br>   youtube and watch some videos about them.  There are a lot on there that have an amazing vocabulary.<br>  <br>  <br>  The males can learn to say more words than the females.|`|YGhpOsXDaa	Well they're a popular house bird and well behaved. Not all of them can talk, it's just down to luck. As for teaching to one to speak, it's just a case of being in a quiet room and repeating the word and hoping that the bird remembers it and repeats it.|`|fmIDB4ZFaa	If you lived near Cleveland Ohio I would give you 2 of them for FREE!!!<br>  <br>  They can actually be a delightful pet.<br>  <br>  Be warned though, they are messy!!!  You will be cleaning and vacuuming like EVery day!<br>  <br>  My Mom had one and it could talk it was so cute.  I think they only talk when there is just one though.<br>  <br>  Mine do not talk, they are totally in to each other and don't socialize with me at all.<br>  <br>  I have a Cockatiel who is the apple of my eye.  She is very sociable.|`|a4eca20886ed5136a1b67933a28ef01baa	Parakeets need at least two hours everyday out of their cage socializing with you.<br>  Sound level low to moderate.<br>  They are smart and can learn tricks, to whistle, and some can learn to talk.<br>  They come in a variety of colors.<br>  A cage would run anywhere from $50- as big as you can afford, look on ebay<br>  Min. cage dimensions: 18x18x20 (larger preferred)<br>  Bar spacing: up to 1/2"<br>  The bird will range from $30-$50 different colors are more expensive. They live from 10-15 years.<br>  Good pellet diet, Millet spray, Mineral block, Water bottle for mist baths, different perches, and Toys will be around $60-$90. Expect to spend around $150-$200<br>  <br>  A play gym would also be good to get you can put it on top of your birds cage and they can play with it for hours. They run anywhere from $20-$50<br>  <br>  Look for a hand-fed one that way they are already tamed and they trust people other wise if you get one from a pet store you will have to tame it yourself.<br>  <br>  You will want to get one so that it bonds to you and not another bird.  A lot of people get two and are not satified with the lack of attention that they recieve.  I have two Cockatiels they are brothers and I got them at the same time but both of them adore me.  They both can't wait to come out of the cage and they both call for me when I walk by their cage.  Though they do get jealous when they are both on the same shoulder so they have to be on either side. lol <br>  <br>  <br>  All birds are hard work. Make sure that you are prepared to take the time to devote to these birds. With my two Cockatiels a have to do a thorough clean once a week meaning scrubbing everything down, change the paper every other day, change the water 1-2 times a day, and change the food once a day. To have happy content Cockatiels you have to take them out all of the time. Mine spend at least 4-5 hours a day outside of their cage and I have a huge cage. Make sure that you do TONS of research. Make sure that the plants in yours house aren't toxic. Did you know air fresheners and Teflon can kill them? Do your research and make sure that you are fully prepared to take on any birds.
a4eca20886ed5136a1b67933a28ef01baa	Unless you will always take her to the groomer you might like shampoo, nail trimmers, and ear wash.  You will also want a brush and tooth brush and toothpaste.  Some dog treats would be nice mine love to have one when they get up in the morning.  Also Preventative flea and tick and heartworm will also be needed  What brand of dog food did you get your new pup?  I hope that it isn't Purina, Eukanuba, Pedigree or any other commercial brand foods.  If it is I would do research on the matter since 87% of all dog and cat death are due to bad commercial food.  Also Cancer is the number one killer of pet dogs and cats because of the bad food.  I would buy Blue Buffalo adult dog food from Pet smart instead.  It has no fillers and no soy type of things that make dogs have allergies.

Sounds like you got it covered. <br>  <br>  I've never met a lab that didn't like tennis balls, and they've got the best durability/price ratio of any toy. So I would pick up some of those - the REAL tennis balls made for tennis, not the crappy hollow ones "made for dogs" (they last 5 minutes). Labs are made to, y'know, retrieve, lol. <br>  <br>  They're also good at destroying toys. That's what Kongs are for. A lab will leave a stuffed toy in shreds and piles of stuffing, all over your floor, within the day. That's a conservative estimate.<br>  <br>  Add: looks like Jen beat me to the punch. :)|`|OxFsslN8aa	A bed and a ton more chew toys - puppies chew a lot.|`|msAh2tItaa	well first i would let the shelter know about the living conditions of the foster home when you go to pick her up then get a dog tye out depending on if your yard is fenced or not as well as a dog house for outside just in case it rains or something while you are out. while you are at the vet get her tested for heart worms if she wasn't tested at the shelter and have her put on a preventative as well as getting flea medication. well that's all i can think of at the moment good luck and thanks for adopting from a shelter|`|XLsnuAqmaa	jen is right.  labs love tennis balls!|`|6SeWCfUfaa	Yay for rescuing the dog from the "rescue."  <br>  <br>  (Don't get me wrong, I love the idea of rescues but rescuing sometimes turns into hording which is the right intentions without the resources too pull it off properly.  It's sad, but it happens.)<br>  <br>  Anyway ... Sounds like you have most all of what you need to get started.  EXCEPT - she's a lab mix, she needs tennis balls.  A dogs gotta have a BALL!!  It's cheaper to buy them in tubes from places like wal-mart than to get them at PetSmart.  You might also want to put off getting her anything fancy for the bottom of the crate until you're sure she's well past chewing.  Goodwill is your best friend for that.  You can buy old towels, sheet, comforters for next to nothing and so when the dog destroys it, it's no big deal.<br>  <br>  And quite frankly, the collapsible wire crates are the best ones.  Even if they are a few dollars more expensive.  Put a few of your goodwill blankets or sheets in the bottom and cover it with a goodwill comforter and it's a cozy, cozy house for your dog that can be broken down and taken with you places if you need to.  Airline crates are good for just that, flying on a plane.  So stick with the good ones.|`|M6cP2eJyaa	Really you seem like you have everything. You might what to buy some treats for training purposes. Maybe a dog bed so she has somewhere to sleep when not in the kennel. I really suggest getting a kennel. It is a safe place for a dog and they really like them. My dog loves his. It is a security place for them. As for prices on dog kennels walmart has good prices. You may also look on craigslist they have a lot on there for cheep most of the time. It sounds like the dog is going to have a good place to live. Good job on rescuing a dog they make the best dogs I think. That is how we got ours.

D1beU6MPaa	Hi honey,<br>  I know all to well what you are feeling. On Jan. 30 I lost my fifteen-year-old Cocker Spaniel. He was fine one day, and the next day we had to have him put to sleep. I also have a Pyrenees that has lymphoma, and does not have much longer. It is so heartbreaking to lose them, and I wish there was something anybody could say that would make you feel better. But this is your baby, and no matter what words of comfort someone may give you, it does not lessen the pain of losing something you love so much. But do know that no matter how much it hurts, it is something we all face when we have pets that we love so much. Big Hugs to you.|`|Pi8KfmOxaa	im really sorry ive been in your situation and its heartbreaking, but you have to try to enjoy the time you have left so take each day as it comes.|`|AE7W7Jspaa	I understand your heartbreak we lost our senior bc at the age of 15 in Dec.  It is something that we must all deal with in our own way.  Go ahead and grieve you are losing a very important part of your life.  I had a portriat done of our guy.  Keep the special memories close to you.  I wrote a memorial for our guy|`|9kTejB0uaa	There are no easy answers to this question.  You may find your girl rallies, and you have some more precious time with her.  But at the end of the day, as I've just answered in another question, quality of life is your main consideration at this time.  Put your emotions to one side, and just enjoy the time you have left and then allow her to go, with dignity.<br>  <br>  It's going to hurt and there's no way past that, but you will come through it, and once the raw hurt lessens, you will remember the good times.  And perhaps eventually you will get another little life to love.<br>  <br>  Hope so.|`|4ZzLtY9Saa	I lost my dog after 14 years last April I had him since I was 8 I was completely heartbroken.  I didn't know he was going to be put down so it was a shock for me.  I felt so guilty I didn't go to the vet to watch him get put to sleep my mum did it for me.  I couldn't bring myself to do it.  I cried for 5 hours solid after it and every night for 6 months.  I decided to get him cremated and I still have his ashes I just feel closer to him that way.<br>  <br>  All I can suggest is take lots of photo's and video's to remember her by, give her lots of kisses and cuddles and make sure she isn't in pain just take each day as it comes and don't blame yourself it isn't your fault she is very lucky to have you xx|`|28834ea3162329035a24ce080e7020edaa	There is nothing you can do, and nothing I can say to make it better.

Since most people here are long time dog lovers and dog owners we have all felt what you are feeling. We know it hurts. I can tell you that little by little it will hurt less and because you know the end is coming you can make the most of the time the two of you have left. If you work take a couple of days off to spend with your dog also tell your boss about the situation so he or she knows that when the day comes and your dog passes on that you will be a mess and might need that day or a couple off work.<br>  <br>  Some people find solace in adopting another dog and saving its life, but that might not be right for you.<br>  <br>  Once again I am sorry for your pain and impending loss.|`|RALliiZTaa	I'm very sorry for you and your dog. the only thing you can do is make her comfortable as possible with the remaining time you have left with her. I know this may sound heartless but at some point you will have to move on when she goes. you will always have good memories of her and keep remembering her when she goes, maybe her favorite will remind you of her and how wonderful she was. don't try to keep her alive and let her suffer. she will be in a better place and one day you will see her again when you leave this Earth too.<br>  <br>  I hope you'll make the best time with her for what time you have left with her, I hope this helps|`|vZUHSNn6aa	I know how you feel, i've lost two dogs in the space of seven months. The the first my black lab who was 10 was very sick and i had no choice but to put him to sleep, and my gorgeous little pug who died during surgery he was 6. Its hard at first its a death in the family as far as im concerned, walking into the house and they dont greet you etc. But you do get over it eventually. Im lucky i have another two dogs but i miss my oldest ones. You've had a good 12 years with her just remember the good times. Make everyday you have left with her special, take lots of pictures. I don't know what else to say really, everyone heals differently, give it time there will be lots of tears. Im sorry about your dog xx|`|7Nzvjkbsaa	Awwww....I'm so sorry to hear of your situation.  I know it can be very tough, but the only advice I have to give is just to make her as comfortable as possible, give her whatever she wants, and be aware that you will have to be strong enough to know when it is "her time".  As difficult as it is to think about it, it is more loving to let her go than to make her suffer needlessly.  Enjoy the time you have left with her and remember the good memories you made together.<br>  <br>  Wishing you all the best...|`|zdO16ELnaa	Hi<br>  <br>  I'm sorry to hear about your dog!<br>  I love my dog and I hate thinking about losing her!<br>  I say be happy that you had your dog for 12 years<br>  Always think about all the things you did together and laugh about it!<br>  Your dog will always know it had the best owner ever!<br>  You love her and she loves you<br>  These 4 words helped me when i lost somebody:<br>  1.Let Go<br>  2.Love<br>  3.Remember<br>  <br>  I hope this help and I know that your dog will be looking down on you every day for the rest of your life!<br>  <br>  Also when your thinking of her give her a big kiss and an air hug<br>  <br>  :)|`|tLxUQo15aa	a very much loved dog of mine had to be put to sleep in november, she was loved and i had to decide for the best.

If there isn't any pain, then give him/her the same attention you've always given... maybe even a bit more :)<br>  <br>  Enjoy the time you have left, there really isn't anything else you can do.|`|h6M6v58jaa	Two years ago my dog past away, it was so hard to have to go through such a thing. She was a sweet dog, I miss her so much.I had her for 14 years.<br>  And because she was inside with me, I had her cremated and they put her in a urn, on top of the lid is her picture and I put her collar around the urn. She is in front of my fireplace, where she always liked to lay.<br>  I was able to bring her home. Outside I made a little flower garden with a slate rock with her name on it. Time does help. And you won't ever forget. I still haven't been able to get another dog, because she was such  a wonderful dog.Just enjoy her while you have her, and she knows that your doing your best.|`|sq2EnZK4aa	hey i know what you feel,i lost my puppy just 2 days ago.i was depressed and heart broken like you but my mom said if you believe in heaven and hell that my puppy,Angel went to a better place and if i accept Jesus Christ as my Savior and Lord and be saved i would see Angel again.also think about  it as being a good thing.not a sad thing.think about this way,she out of her misery of being sick and now she can look down on you.she may be gone from this world but she is not gone from your heart.just pray that God will be with you and take good care of her until you see her again.may God be with you.i'll be praying for you.|`|1Z4XGmWbaa	I am sorry to hear about your dog.

Make sure to take allot of pictures of her before she dies.. And whoever get it to fart in a jar..... That i just so insinsitive!!!! He sounds ignorant dont let him get to you.

First I thought it was something naughty. lol|`|mggll8dRaa	Just don't be wearing "An Itsy-Bitsy Teenie-Weenie Yellow, Polka-Dot Bikini"......!!|`|BWez86Ldaa	It seems like this is a truly wild animal and I doubt that it would be legal for you to own one without a permit of some sort. That being said, usually they only give permits like this out to experienced people who are caring for wild animals with intentions to free them back into the wild. Gophers aren't meant to be kept in captivity with their extreme need to dig and make tunnels. That being said, caring for one would be a once in a lifetime ordeal and I was unable to find information concerning this. I imagine that you would need a fenced in back yard (with the wood going so many feet into the ground), and provide the correct food, water, and so on.|`|OqveEUqkaa	Yes it is. Very carefully.
5M57TTfpaa	wood shavings(or whatever bedding you decide on), pellets(i use rabbit chow), a salt lick(esp if they are licking your fingers and the cage and stuff), some toys?<br>  <br>  both my rabbits and their babies like the toys that hang from the top or side of the cage(mostly bird toys), that have a bell at the bottom, and maybe some wood on it to chew at. also you could use tp rolls for entertainment, cat toys(those balls with the bells inside), and just other things you think they might like to throw around.<br>  <br>  diet.. young rabbits need to eat unlimited food, until about 6 months, which then it should be cut back to keep your rabbit from gettin fat. i have a pretty good link at home, i can upload it later tonight. it explains how much food to feed per lbs your bunny weighs..<br>  <br>  something i forgot, hay. i would get timothy hay(alfalfa is hard to break your rabbit off of when you need to, its pretty fatty, thats why they love it so much), usually they always have an unlimited amount of hay.<br>  ps, dont feed that baby any veggies til they are aobut 6 months old.|`|3NoDjKLoaa	salt lick.. bunnies eat the green pellets.. they say alfalfa is really good for bunnies too.. they have treats you can buy them that are made from that. thats all you will really need.|`|yPQbBzsQaa	U could get ur Rabbit some chewing toys to look after its teeth that's excellent
26PPwzrWaa	How much are you feeding? <br>  If you are feeding too much, loose stool will undoubtedly result. If your dog likes the food, try lowering the amount you feed until stools are solid. Reduce amount by 1/4 to 1/2 of a cup every couple days.<br>  I wouldnt be feeding any more than a cup of the food. <br>  But start at the recommended amount. Then when loose stool starts, follow the above directions and lower the amount. <br>  <br>  Some find when you lower the amount to the point stools are solid, that the amount of food the dog gets is not enough to keep weight up. At that point you may want to look into regular wellness or innova. If you can find Taste of the wild, you may want to try those varieties. They are less rich than most grain free foods, they only get to 32%, while as you can see, wellness core is 50%. The lowest for TOTW is 25% and thats grain free. <br>  <br>  And get/run off the hills SD. That stuff is crap.|`|mRevWUxlaa	Well, the canned food has a high concentrate of water, so that is good because the diarrhea causes dehydration. I would go back to the Science Diet or try him on Nutro. That's what Ive used and had no problems. The breeder recommended it and it's great! If you don't like that, ask your vet because they do know the best foods and have knowledge of what foods can cause side effects and which foods have higher protein levels and little problems.|`|KxjUim7yaa	It is possible that he is reacting to the chicken. Another possibility is to add a little canned pumpkin to his food and see if that helps.|`|kRO55DHyaa	I tried a high protein diet once for my dogs-it was too much for their systems-every one of them experienced what you describe.  I am a firm believer that dogs need carbohydrates and fiber in their diets.  Chances are that the Core just wasn't providing the fiber needed to bulk up stools, and the food was exiting as liquid (it changes to liquid in the stomach, and then re-forms in the intestines as water is removed from it) because there wasn't enough fiber to bulk it up.  <br>  <br>  You may be safe on the Core by adding a few tbsp. of Metamucil to the food every day, but who wants to do that?  I would go to Wellness Super5Mix if you want to stay with the brand.  Something good for dogs with sensitive stomachs is California Natural.  If your dog usually has an OK digestive system, I would choose Innova.<br>  <br>  I wouldn't worry about what that food analysis website recommends-the person who posts on that site refuses to offer a name or credentials...why would you trust someone like that anyway?  A lot of the stuff on that site is good information, but you need to use your own experiences and common sense when choosing-if grain free causes these kinds of problems in your dog,  it's obviously not made for him.  <br>  <br>  Good luck, I hope he is feeling better soon.<br>  <br>  Kate:  The difference is that we (or at least I) am not purporting to be an expert in dog food.  I'm offering advice based on my own education and my own, personal experiences.  As I said earlier, I wouldn't base all of my decision on a website whose editor refuses to identify himself/herself or even to offer any credentials.  I agree with many of the analysis on the site, don't get me wrong, but I don't put a lot of stock into the editor's "expertise".  I'm not an expert, and I never said I was, I don't see many people here on YA claiming any "special" knowledge, either.  I let the asker know that MY opinion is that dogs need carbs and fiber provided by what I consider to be "good" grains-like rice, barley, millet, etc.  I know that my dogs (especially my setter and my poodle) can absolutely not tolerate high protein foods...some dogs just can't.|`|GSf09ALBaa	I had the same problem with Wellness, Solid Gold and Taste of the Wild.  I can't afford Innova or Canidae so right now I am doing Diamond Chicken and Rice.  I am having some loose stools but not like before.<br>  <br>  Diamond is like a level 3, but it is certainly better than the garbage dog foods and it is reasonably priced.|`|ba8dd4c6a9b532bef579aff3e8706fe7aa	Every dog is different.  A food that may be great for one dog can be terrible for another.
X6PDtlq4aa	A two-nippled cat? That's bizarre. I would start giving them wet food as soon as their ears have grown out of their head. You know how babies' ears are like little triangles at first? Well when they're fully developed that seems to be a good time to start them on food. I wish I could say I know when that is- I haven't had kittens in so long. I would say a wait another week. Once they start running around they're ready for wet food.|`|CFFuFof1aa	About 6 weeks.|`|UKpNiRf6aa	Usually when kittens are between four and six weeks of age, the queen's milk production slows down just as the babies' energy needs increase.  The mother begins weaning the kittens from nursing, and they start sampling solid food.  They'll be able to do without their mother's milk by the time they're eight weeks old.|`|xMnN99T8aa	The mother will cut them off. Let nature take its course.|`|JbPGX2Adaa	i think ten weeks is the time they can get independent from the mother
0m6BgESXaa	It's a matter of opinion.  They're two different breeds.<br>  <br>  The Doberman, while extremely bonded to their human, is also considerably more independent than the German Shepherd Dog.<br>  <br>  Both breeds will live and die for you, but in sport situations such as agility, the Doberman has a tendency to go "Ok, the first half was fun, but now I'm done, k thx" where as the GSD will go "I'm going!  I'm going!  w00t!  Whacha got for me next!  I am paying SO MUCH ATTENTION TO YOU!!!!!"<br>  <br>  German Shepherds are "What's next coach!??" And the Doberman is "Make it worth my while!"<br>  <br>  They're both wonderful family pets, loyal, and neither is really stronger than the other.  It depends on what you want out of a dog.|`|3buQDaRDaa	German Shepard|`|UuQAPHJtaa	mm..they are both good, I have a German Shepard named Clyde..and he is sweet, and I had a Doberman named Noble...he was the best dog ever.<br>  Go with the Doberman|`|ZQs5AxrBaa	<a href="http://animal.discovery.com/videos/dogs-101-doberman.html" rel="nofollow">http://animal.discovery.com/videos/dogs-...</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://animal.discovery.com/videos/dogs-101-german-shepherd.html" rel="nofollow">http://animal.discovery.com/videos/dogs-...</a><br>  <br>  Watch the videos on Discovery. <br>  <br>  They helped me a lot.<br>  <br>  Over all I would say German Shepherd|`|tEWOUrVpaa	50/50 across the board. Just be prepared to do A LOT of exercising.|`|GsSRY7quaa	I've had both. both are good watch dogs. you must train them to be good house pets. loyalty will come with the training.|`|PRG25iDIaa	Have had both, and love both. but for the last 30 years only Shepherds. They are loyal, easily trained, and love family. Shepherd are a little more maintanence however (Shedding). The worlds worse. <br>  <br>  The Dobie is a little more headstrong, but both are wonderful animals.<br>  <br>  Strength - probably the same, the shepherd weighs more; but for activities such as agility, running ets, it should be a close match, and both will still be ready to go, when you are completely worn out.|`|jQpTKq3waa	I've owned both, and I currently own 2 Dobermans.  They are as active as I am, I never had problems in training as both earned their CGC (which is a good idea to get regardless of what breed you settle on).  They are mostly couch potatoes until called on to do their job.  If the kids go outside (8yr son and 2 yr daughter) the dogs will constantly patrol the fence line always watchful.  They love to have a job to do.  Their mere presence is enough deterrent to keep people away.  They are like any other dog when welcome guests visit, but become dogs I've never seen before when someone broke into my home.  Their grooming requirements are minimal, better then wash and go hair.<br>  <br>  German Shepherds are great dogs to, It's all a matter of personal preference and the time you need to devote to exercising, training and grooming your dogs.  German Shepherds coats are thick and need attention.  This may be the dog for you if you live in the cooler climates.  Both dogs have their good points and are totally different.  One was bred for protecting your livestock in the fields and the other for personal protection.  <br>  <br>  With any dog, it's important to research the breed and breeder. It's the up-most importance to make certain you receive a well socialized pet, that is a mark of a good breeder. Both my dobermans I purchased from a great breeder and I couldn't have asked for better family members. Both puppies came to me well socialized and easy to handle.  The point is that they are easily trainable and eager to learn, according to my breeder this is typical of the dogs she sells.<br>  <br>  <br>  Good luck at choosing you next family pet.|`|D4ZSXih7aa	loyal are both but the doberman is a bit more.. <br>  German shepherd is  more social than the doberman and stronger as it can get bigger and heavier|`|KLo5IMcHaa	i have a german shepherd she is the best loyal dog i know! i would say german shepherd!
3a72ae0c30ef90de390ceb62b46fb44aaa	plastic cages are no good because the hamster can chew through them.  the items you showed do seem pretty decent for the size cage.  just know that with anything wooden, your little guy will chew on.  just to be prepared.  i think they'll look really neat in the cage/habitat though.<br>  <br>  i would not recommend cedar or pine chips for the floor of the cage as the fumes from these are harmful to the hamsters respiratory tract.<br>  <br>  this page has a list of good bedding choices: <a href="http://www.hamsterific.com/BeddingGuide.cfm" rel="nofollow">http://www.hamsterific.com/BeddingGuide....</a>|`|qGy9fR7xaa	Hiya, i think that's all a brilliant idea, and all of those things look great, and i'm sure your hammy will love them! When i saw the 3rd and 4th ones, i was thinking "hmm, it looks like it may take up a lot of space in the cage..." but then i read the size of your cage, and yeah, i think it'll be great. I didn't realize you could put sand in your hamsters cage... i thought it would get into their eyes...<br>  Just use the usual sawdust/bedding that they sell, i know some people say it's no good (i think they're on about the sawdust..) but i've used it in the past and they love it, and it's not caused any harm.<br>  Good luck with your hamster, and everything - i think it's a great idea, and i'm gonna make sure i introduce more Natural/wooden things in my hamster's cage :)|`|tOFmJXCuaa	Those toys should be fine. As for bedding, I recommend a mixture of pine, and the natural newspaper litter, it is crumpled recycled newspaper. These are both biodegradable, and my dad will actually use the stuff to mulch the yard in the summer, and boy does that stuff make grass grow!! Also hamsters love the stuff.|`|SXlEN1DIaa	Yes you can do that .it sounds like it will have a nice home. and you should ask the salesman at the pet store if you can use wood chips.|`|QvFcqgnPaa	Yo could put sand in the age because they live in the desert so make it look like a desert|`|BWez86Ldaa	Hi there! It's cool to see some natural hides and toys! Very nifty! These things will be alright to use in a hamster enclosure. What kind of cage do you have? O.o Just keep in mind that Cedar and Pine are no-nos, and that's about it. If I were you, I'd use sand, it's a *lot* easier to deal with as far as cleaning goes, and it will look good with the other natural-type things you're putting into the cage! :) Anything without cedar or pine would be alright wood chips to use. Good luck with your natural setting!
Z9zzNYNCaa	NO THEY *DON'T*!<br>  & Yes,you'd be an idiot to buy any such gimmick.|`|FnrAw2SQaa	Iam not for sure but one does the dog doesnt like the noise that it makes so it runns off!|`|CvLwS9p5aa	dunno, but the cat garden deterrents really piss me off. i want to SHOUT and SHOUT. so probably not|`|HmLC2rYJaa	They haven't worked in my experience. I tried one on my own dogs and, even after adjusting the sensitivity, the dogs ignored it. Talk to your neighbor about the incessant barking. Some people are just oblivious and they may not realize how annoying it is. Also, try to find out what is making the dogs bark. A wandering cat? Squirrels at the bird feeder? Kids teasing them? Maybe you can remove the source. I found out it was my neighbor's cat sitting in a window overlooking my dogs' yard. After I talked to the neighbor and she kept that room off limits to the cat, the barking stopped. The cat seemed to know she was teasing the dogs and would walk back and forth in the window just taunting them. <G><br>  Pat
00f9873d58a871ae31ecf33313f803caaa	I'm betting that Bailey is still "puppy crazy", isn't she?  By that I mean that she never sits still.    Most chihuahuas are pretty hyper.  Especially when they're pups.  I have a tiny long haired chihuahua.  She didn't slow down and put on a little weight until after she turned five.  If Baiely's had her shots and the vet says she doesn't have worms, give her some time.  She'll slow down and gain some weight|`|ItFYVwlDaa	She will probably gain a little as she gets older, but probably won't weigh over 5 lbs.|`|rsTLGYaZaa	SHe will probably gain weitght when she gets older but if it is a teacup chihuahua then it will be just like that.  Don't worry just keep feeding her.  She probably is one.  If you have a picture of her please send it to me my email is animallover51095@yahoo.com and i will tell you if she is a teacup chihuahua.

You need to talk to your vet.  I hope that your dog is seeing a specialist?  If not, your vet can refer you to one.|`|ffc39a952453bb382cf4c6fd2af384eeaa	I really honestly think that this question should be posed to a veterinarian or someone who is educated to give you sound medical advice for your dog...not put to Yahoo answers.  You do find good answers on here many times, I've turned to it myself for advice, but for matters this important, you don't know if it's sound advice.  Please, ask your vet this question!!|`|k60CZZ0baa	I like the look of a chow chow. They are so cute.
LvK6rg1caa	She is adorable... :) she doesnt look mixed, my dog has bigger ears than yours i think they just grow into them.<br>  <br>  look at some pics of my pit the last one is with me, and it was taken about a week ago..maybe you can compare<br>  <br>  <br>  <a href="http://i8.photobucket.com/albums/a22/LushuzDulce/Sinamin/0201092034.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://i8.photobucket.com/albums/a22/Lus...</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://i8.photobucket.com/albums/a22/LushuzDulce/Sinamin/DSCF1015.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://i8.photobucket.com/albums/a22/Lus...</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://i8.photobucket.com/albums/a22/LushuzDulce/Sinamin/DSCF1048.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://i8.photobucket.com/albums/a22/Lus...</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://i8.photobucket.com/albums/a22/LushuzDulce/Sinamin/DSCF1087.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://i8.photobucket.com/albums/a22/Lus...</a>|`|mfXDUkRYaa	Pit bulls do have floppy ears though? And maybe she'll grow into them.<br>  <br>  Just because a dog comes from a pedigree family doesn't mean they'll have every characteristic spot on to "breed standard" (something devised by humans).<br>  <br>  And also, just because a dog's name is on a certificate doesn't mean it will always be the sire (or even dam) - some people do all sorts of things to sell dogs!|`|KvUJZa1Paa	Because Pitts are not recognized by the American Kennel Club, most vets feel they are Pitt mixes. even though you seen the linage papers did you get any pedigree papers for your dog<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  Go back to that breeder and tell her you want to papers to this dog or you are going to sue them. If you paid for something and got something else you are entitled for it to be made right|`|6SeWCfUfaa	Your vet did you a favor even if the dog is a purebred.  With all the breed legislation, calling that dog a mix might actually come in handy for you someday.<br>  <br>  If she has papers, she's purebred.  Purebred does not always mean "quality" bred.|`|3n5I4FRcaa	Pitbulls usually have floppy ears like the one in this pic:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.sathy.fi/images/apbt-1.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://www.sathy.fi/images/apbt-1.jpg</a><br>  <br>  <br>  Dogs with upright ears have been cropped, like the dog in this pic:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/12710233@N05/1332273978/" rel="nofollow">http://www.flickr.com/photos/12710233@N0...</a><br>  <br>  <br>  With that type of crop a large amount of the ear tissue is removed. I feel that it is unnecessary and inhumane. A pic of your dog would help. There are other conformational features that would help in telling if your dog is a purebred or not.|`|zrSroauJaa	You can buy a dna test to see. Or her ears could have never been cropped. And sometimes your vet can make a mistake. Our vet thou ght my mutt was a purebred. And then there is the possibility that the papers could be fake. Most likely it is one of the first 2 though|`|hBWlC1C0aa	Wow thats crazy. Maybe you should find people who just breed pit bulls and take it there. But they are supposed to have big ears thats why a lot of them get clipped off. But they should'nt be like Blood Hounds huge ears either. Good luck if it turns out he isnt full blooded act a fool lol|`|szffa3tcaa	Well, just because the breeders said she was a pure breed, doesn't make it true, they love to rip people off. and unless your going to breed your own batch of dogs, or make her a show dog, what does it matter?a dog ia dog. It will love you regardless, and you will love it.|`|50ZS5azEaa	the breeder lied and you got ripped off probably or the vet has no idea what he/she's talking about. but i think you got ripped off because wat you described doesn't sound like pit-bull characteristics.|`|29Av3GOaaa	her eyes look like lab maybe, ive had lab pitbull puppies, theyre great dogs, and sooooo adorable tooo! very trainable and patient:) hope this helps have fun with her!!!|`|HgMFrllLaa	IMHO you've been had :)|`|FnrAw2SQaa	A picture would be helpful.<br>  if you have the papers then she full breed but if you dont then you just got ripped out of your money!|`|AA10029366	Two possible explanations:<br>  <br>  1. Your vet doesn't recognize purebreds well (not uncommon)<br>  <br>  2. Your breeder lied (also not uncommon with unethical breeders, unfortunately)<br>  <br>  Nobody here can tell you whether your puppy is purebred, especially without pics.
DWBV84NTaa	You normally see crows year round throughout most of North America, even when its northern and Winter is cold. I live in North Eastern Canada, and there are tons of Crows. They're hardy and very very smart, and able to adapt well to freezing temperatures. However, they do tend to migrate to some of the warmer states during the winter, and southern Canada, and tend not to be found in the extreme northern regions of Canada during the winter.<br>  <br>  During the summer, you can find them almost virtually everywhere across North America. There's a range map on the link posted below. <br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.birds.cornell.edu/AllAboutBirds/BirdGuide/American_Crow_dtl.html#map" rel="nofollow">http://www.birds.cornell.edu/AllAboutBir...</a><br>  <br>  This page has lot of helpful info on Crows, and I hope it helps you out! Good luck!|`|7sXNwFynaa	not sure really|`|MstjbpVJaa	Crows are a very intelligent bird,if food is hard to get in one place they will move to where it is warmer and in more supply.<br>  <br>  Remember Crows are also Scavengers and if there is nothing to scavenge in an area they must move to pastures new to survive and that is why they are becoming more frequent visitors to the towns.<br>  <br>  At this time of year they may be calling to attract a mate or marking out their territory.
bepZupAfaa	it would depend on the poison itself. some poisons don't show up in blood work because they dissipate quickly in the blood stream or digestive systems. so it would really depend on the poison .<br>  <br>  hope this helps
Amkmles0aa	if she will not have sex when a boy can comes by|`|AA10922449	The vet can shave her belly and look for a scar.|`|yCR6qg0baa	Usually shelter vets leave a green tattoo where the cat was spayed. Her stomach muscles will be loose & weak for a while afterward. She won't go into heat. There will be a scar, but you may not be able to see it if all the hair has grown back.|`|WMrNa3Doaa	They will usually have a small scar on their stomach.  You might not be able to see it through the fur though.<br>  <br>  You could always take it to the vet and ask them. They would be able to tell you for sure.|`|ozWi3TJlaa	She will have a scar on her lower belly area, and she won't go into heat.|`|AA11589437	Only the vet can say, perhaps with an ultrasound.|`|XTlJROHdaa	It is very difficult to tell if a female cat has been spayed or not.  Do not rely on the whole "she won't go into heat" method of telling.  Some unspayed female cats do not show outward signs when they are in heat, so that is not a reliable way to tell if they are spayed or not.  I would take her to the vet and ask them.  Usually, they can tell by shaving the belly and looking for a scar.  They could also do an ultrasound to check for the presence of the female organs.  It is better to be safe than sorry--never just assume that any cat has been spayed.|`|WBjThHKdaa	She will have a scar on her stomach. Also they act totally freaky when they go into heat, if you haven't noticed any crazy meowing or constant rubbing on everything, than she's probably fixed.|`|kixQWODVaa	she might have a small scar on her stomach or she will go into heat if not the only way to tell is when the vet opens her up.
YFTZM86maa	Any store like walmart or walgreens.  Eye and skin wash should be saline solution, nothing special. Hydrocortisone Cream I think is a no-no unless it's meant to use on yourself! Insect sting wipes, again, not for use on the pig. Green Soap Towelettes, skip these.  The saline is good enough.  Triple Antibiotic Ointment, not for on the pig, only for you.  PVP Iodine Antiseptic wipes, not unless you are doing surgery...if you are bitten, wash with soap and water.  Pet care card can be gotten from a vet or pet store.  Pet emergency card can be an index card.<br>  I think this list is misleading and dangerous.  I would not use all those items meant to treat humans on a guinea pig without vet approval.  <br>  Also, a paste of corn starch can be used instead of expensive stypic powder!  Mix to a thick paste and apply and hold pressure for a few minutes.  I would add a few napkins or paper towel, a zip bag or small bottle, like from 35 mm film to put ticks or other small critters in to get identified, and if you are traveling with your pig, a bottle of water and a small fleece blanket.|`|tc5A0vKDaa	TRy this site.  everyone here will be able to tell you EXACTLY what you need, where to get it and how much!<br>  <br>  <a href="http://cavygalore.proboards.com/index.cgi" rel="nofollow">http://cavygalore.proboards.com/index.cg...</a>  <-- Tell them MISTRESS MAE sent you.<br>  <br>  CavyGalore is an EXCELLET guinea pig site.

And the things you say that they might sale at the pet store, well still ask a person who is a vet or works there, they know bout this better.|`|BWez86Ldaa	Good lord, I'm wondering what you anticipate happening! :P Anyway, there's nothing more I would add to this list. I suggest asking your vet about what kind of eye and skin wash would be appropriate for your pig, if any. I would assume that those things would be for you, I'm not sure exactly why, but that's another thing you can talk to your vet about!
EJpiaCMQaa	He is probably afraid of his bath and doesn't feel comfortable using it.  You can keep the bath in there and wait and see if he does get comfortable using it.  Another option you have, which really does work, is to wet some lettuce leaves and put them in a dish, and let the budgie bathe that way.  My budgies love to bathe in the lettuce leaves and won't touch the bird bath.|`|12VQ4ETcaa	Birds won't bathe unless they are in the mood and feel safe.  When they want a bath, you won't be able to stop them!  They'll just climb in their water dish or start splashing themselves.<br>  <br>  One of the ways you'll know your bird wants a bath is if he starts dancing around when you are washing your hands or running water.  Some birds prefer to bathe in a bowl, some prefer the sink, and some prefer a spray bottle.  He might not want to do it at all until the weather gets better.
W20KslFzaa	Yeah, he'll calm down as he gets older and goes out more.  The vet isn't a fun place and is full of all sorts of crazy smells and bad experiances for a puppy. Just like bringing a baby to the doc's office, he/she's gonna cry.<br>  Don't worry, it's normal and it will calm down.  He may never like the vet, but he'll be fine going out.  Best thing to do is try to expose him to the world often when he's young.  Other people, other dogs, cats, everything.  This will help him to be less aggressive as he gets older, because he'll be used to more things.|`|b3HR6KqTaa	It should. Be sure to socialize LOTS. Take him for walks, have neighbors pet him, take him to the pet store (when he is old enough!) etc. Getting him used to different, busy environments should help. Even if we aren't trying life at home can be pretty routine so mixing it up helps a bunch.<br>  <br>  Also, ignore bad behavior and really praise him when he is doing good. They catch on pretty quick =) <br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|2G6b5y8Taa	yes the puppy was just out of its environment but its not good that the only time the dog has been way from the house is to get shots it make think its bad to be out the house it needs to be socialized and out of the house or it may get aggressive|`|HZgjUguWaa	yes the behavior will calm down . But a lot of the behavior was probably from the ride not all dogs travel well.|`|d3baaec2db2c56bde7d391e4da1b0616aa	You may wish to socialize him with the outside world a little bit more. Take him to pet stores and parks that allow dogs. If you can find one, take him to puppy play dates. He may of been a little over-stimulated that day.<br>  <br>  He will out grow it in time.|`|FnrAw2SQaa	YES! he needs to be out more and needs to fill ok outside other wise when he gets bigger he"ll be worst and hard to handled|`|pLv0Ejt9aa	It is very important that you socialize your puppy very well for him to become a confident adult dog. Dogs that are not socialized well become insecure and often develop fear aggression. As soon as he had his injections you must take him everywhere you can. Let friendly people touch him, let he meet other friendly dogs, take him to sport matches, walk with him next to busy roads. Take him for training. More on dog training on my site.
L22hVXTIaa	My dogs are real clowns.  Just before their dinner, they will start a chase game, but they run so fast, with their little bums tucked that I'm always afraid they're going to run into furniture.  They go at break neck speed and then do burns off the side of the couch.  And, two of them know that a little ball is my female's favorite toy, so they go get it and taught her with it wherever she is.  They know that she'll take off after them - and they're right.  It's fun to watch!|`|10ef8c48e3ba55a59f16e3badd0a5b52aa	OMG YES<br>  my puppy argues back with me if i tell her off for sitting on the settee<br>  and it sounds/growels like she is saying OH|`|62606e92b3ab21e8b1abda7881267fceaa	Yes my Yorkie pup makes me laugh every day Especially when he tries to fetch something bigger than himself.|`|la9zji2Uaa	I have a cat and she makes me laugh everyday.

They have more all over bodily problems, just as people do.|`|5rfnEQnGaa	You need to go back to the vet, If she is on non-steroidal anti-infamatories, they may not be suiting her. She may need blood tests to see what is happening. She is an old dog so do not delay. Your vet should have warned you of any contra-indications of drugs, but if not, please ask. <br>  Good luck.
AA10766729	That's actually an excellent cage; it offers plenty of air flow, and is easy to clean.  <br>  <br>  One piece of advice: do NOT buy cedar chips; use pine ONLY.  <br>  <br>  You should also buy a play ball; they run about $8 dollars or so, but hamsters LOVE them....it also gives you a safe place to put your little friend while you're cleaning the cage.<br>  You might also want to buy an "igloo", hut, or little home; hamsters like to sleep balled up inside of a little "cave" (I have an igloo for mine: <br>  <a href="http://www.petsmart.com/product/index.jsp?productId=2753270" rel="nofollow">http://www.petsmart.com/product/index.js...</a> -- about $5).<br>  <br>  Also, be SURE to wash everything you buy with hot water & antibacterial soap and rinse/dry it well before use.  It'll help prevent illness.<br>  <br>  Finally, I'd recommend changing out the crappy cheap wheel the cage will come with, with this one: <a href="http://www.petsmart.com/product/index.jsp?productId=2753369" rel="nofollow">http://www.petsmart.com/product/index.js...</a><br>  It's wonderfully quiet...something you'll truly appreciate when you're trying to sleep & little miss thang is running like crazy in the middle of the night!<br>  <br>  As for hamster costs, I don't know where you are, but in California, we paid $15 for our last hamster (about a year ago).  This was for a Siberian; I don't know if the price varies by breed.  The best thing to do would be to call the store you plan to visit and ask.|`|tw6qP6S0aa	The cage you're looking at getting seems a little small for a hamster, and hamster's also like more tubes, to run around in, and I better wheel I would suggest<br>  <a href="http://www.petsmart.com/product/index.jsp?productId=2754670" rel="nofollow">http://www.petsmart.com/product/index.js...</a><br>  <br>  it's what I got when I owned two hamsters and a mouse, and I also suggest a male hamster, they usually are nicer, and perhaps a dwarf.|`|5M57TTfpaa	i have had a prob with 4 hamsters in a row from petsmart. they all died of wettail. just be careful, if it gets it, take it back and get your money back anto 3d go somewhere else. <br>  <br>  depending on your hamster, i have seen prices range from about 10 to 20 dollars.|`|AA11556697	prob around 20 bucks for the Hampster, you also want to make sure you get tubes for him to run around in, makes them feel more comfortable...|`|mOayTJDmaa	I saw some around $8-$12
EJpiaCMQaa	First, I'd suggest getting your cockatiel's wings clipped so she doesn't keep hitting the window.  She can become seriously injured or even killed from that type of accident.  Plus, it will be easier to tame her if she isn't flying all over the place.  The petshop or a vet can trim the wings if you don't want to or know how to do it.  Also, keep your dog away from your cockatiel.  I know of too many cockatiels, and other pet birds, that have been injured or killed by dogs.  That may be a reason why she is flying in the first place.  She is scared of the dog and takes off flying.  In brief, get a wing trimming and keep the dog away.|`|lZiBRhGyaa	get its wings clipped so it can't fly , or at least too far. <br>  <br>  keep it away from your dog, if you want to play with it shut the door! my cat killed 2 of my friends cockatiel's and my dog killed 1, its horrible. put curtains over your window or something so it doesn't get hurt or killed.  be slow too so it doesn'tt fly as much
v6siQIVjaa	budgie parakeet|`|v6coHbIeaa	Quaker Parrot.|`|llUVXlLKaa	A PARROT|`|AA11477952	I have had many pets. Raccoons, snakes, parakeets, dogs, cats, tarantulas, ferrets, you name it, I've probably had it as a pet. But the one pet that I have had for a few years now, and the best pet ever, next to a ferret, would have to be my Blue and Gold Macaw. I love being a parrot owner. The parrot, whether it be a African Grey or Cockatoo or Macaw, is the best pet ever. Why? Because it is the only pet I have ever had that talks to me, and always says, I love you! And, I love seeing people's smiling faces. Most only get to see this animal in a Zoo. But don't get me wrong, it is by far, the most time consuming pet. And I have never had an animal bite hurt as much as a parrot bite. But in the end, with time and dedication, it is most worth while. Also, a lifetime commitment. They live upwards of 80 to 100 years!

UpU5eep9aa	She's playing and she's learning at the same time, she is practicing hunting and self defence and as her substitue mother you are the one to help her.  Make sure she has plenty of toys to play with, both small mouse shaped ones and larger ones that she can get into a good grip and kick at with her back feet while biting as well.  As she grows up she will stop this and only bite if she feels threatened or is hurt. Enjoy her, she won't be a kitten for long|`|kNYDHZqAaa	This is definitely normal for kittens... and even for cats, to be honest! When they bite and hold on for a few seconds, it's the kitty equivalent of a kiss. But if she's getting too nippy with you and trying to bite your arms regularly, try to direct her to a toy instead of letting her bite you - otherwise she could develop some bad habits! A dangling toy would be good to use for this situation.|`|P9S5wlLyaa	She's just playing. They're love bites. Unless you're being cruel to her, she isn't biting to be mean. She just doesn't realize that biting hurts you. Kittens playfight with each other, and she's probably wanting to do the same with you.|`|DtkLsetkaa	They do it both for play fighting and for affection, my one cat will give me little nips when I am petting her to show me gratitude :)  As long as she isn't breaking skin, its love ;)|`|Rw7gi86Naa	Young kittens between the ages of 3 weeks old and 8 months old will be teething off and on, and will have very strong needs to bite.  Just like baby children, kittens are born without teeth, start getting their first baby teeth at about 3-4 weeks old, then they will lose their baby teeth and have their adult teeth come in up until the age of about 8 months old.  So the trick here is not to keep them from biting; but rather, to provide them appropriate items to bite.  We use heavy-duty plastic drinking straws with our kittens, (being careful to cut off any bitten ends and discard the entire straw before it becomes dangerous, as with any toy), and train them from the start that toys and straws are purr-rectly fine to bite, but human body parts are off-limits!  If a kitten learns this from the start, there is hardly ever an inappropriate biting behavior as an adult.  Some cats start biting out of frustration after they have been declawed.  Some cats start biting out of misplaced aggression, which usually can be countered by providing the cat a feline playmate, and/or providing them more cat toys, cat furniture, and making their environment more stimulating for them.  Any time the kitten bites you make a loud “yowling” sound. If you’ve ever witnessed a cat get hurt, you will probably know what this sounds like. After you yowl, walk away and ignore the kitten. Never yell at or hit a cat. At all times, it is critical that you be thinking and acting on the firm belief that "toys and straws are for biting; human hands are for giving and receiving love.” <br>  <br>  <br>  Don't assume automatically that cats that bite are vicious creatures.  You must distinct between play-biting and real aggressive biting.  Kittens for example like to play, and sometimes pretty rough.  They use their claws and teeth to wrestle with each other.  This is how they learn to hunt and catch prey, so that’s normal.  They usually go unharmed because their fur protects them from serious wounds.  However, human skin is a different story, but kittens don't know that.<br>  <br>  When you stroke your kitten it can take it as an invitation to play and clasps your hand and bites.  That might hurt a little but is generally nothing to worry about.  Some cats make a sport out of leg biting.  They jump up on you and dig in.  Research has show that it’s a sort of unsatisfied hunting and prey instinct and lack of activity.  <br>  <br>  - Teach your kitten from an early age that hands are for feeding and stroking and NOT a toy!  <br>  - Avoid playing with your bare hands <br>  - Use a fluffy toy or a feather on a string instead <br>  - In case it grabs your hand, draw it away slowly and do NOT punish your cat, it will understand it as an attack and make matters worse.<br>  - Anytime your cat scratches or bites you, make a loud yowling sound to show that you have been hurt, (even if you really aren’t hurt). Your cat will understand. <br>  - If your cat is a "leg biter" try to spend more time playing with it and redirect its attack to a toy.  Leave toys lying around so that he can also amuse itself, particular when you keep your cat indoors. Cats need a wide variety of toys to keep them interested, so don’t expect a couple toy mice to help.
ubBrB6YUaa	Rabbits get a condition called, "Snuffles". This is when they sneeze lots of times in a row - even around humans. Your rabbit will need to go on a course on anti-biotics. It is the respitritory sytem of the rabbit that is weak. The rabbit may have runny eyes and nose with discharge. The main infectious agents that may be involved are :<br>  <br>  Pasteurella <br>  Staphylococcus <br>  and Bordatella <br>  Rabbits have retained an instinctive behaviour to hide the fact that they are ill - so once you notice any signs at all the disease is usually very advanced. As soon as you notice any signs of illness isolate the affected rabbit from any others that you might have. An affected rabbit can deteriorate very quickly, so take it to your veterinarian so that an accurate diagnosis can be made and treatment started as soon as possible.<br>  <br>  Sometimes these infections are triggered by stress of some sort of stress, so examine the environment and your feeding practices to identify if there are any problems. <br>  "Snuffles" is a general term for respiratory diseases in rabbits which may cause discharges from the eyes, discharges from the nose, sneezing, noisy breathing, coughing and difficulty breathing. <br>  <br>  Some of these signs are very similar to those that humans develop with common infections such as colds and flu and this is one of the reasons why owners sometimes do not seek veterinary attention early in the course of these diseases....because they presume that it is a mild disease and the rabbit will get over it very quickly.<br>  <br>  Take your rabbit to the vets. Hope this helps|`|CuMYdQV6aa	In Hungary a sneeze tells people that you've just told a lie.

When I first got her and noticed it, I took her to the vet, and was told it looked like nothing, but they gave me some antibiotics just in case, didn't help, and didn't seem to get any worse.  She lived a long life, (8 years). <br>  <br>  As long as their nose/eye/mouth is clear (no crust or mucus) it's most likely not a cold, it could be allergies to anything, or if you use a litter pan when he/she's indoors, the dust in the litter will make them sneeze sometimes, so I use a pellet litter.

EJpiaCMQaa	You don't need to let zebra finches out to exercise.  They will get plenty of exercise flying about their cages.  Make sure to get a big enough cage so they can fly around easily and be happy and healthy.  It's best to buy the largest cage you can.  Zebra finches are usually quite shy and like to fly, play with their toys, and go "beep beep".  They love to jump in their water bowl and bathe.  They are easy to care for and very hardy birds.  They are also easy to breed.  Just like other pet birds, take them in for a yearly exam to keep them healthy.  Males always have the bright orange cheek patches while females are a duller color.<br>  <br>  Here are some web sites on zebra finches for you to explore:<br>  <a href="http://exoticpets.about.com/cs/finches/a/zebrafinches.htm" rel="nofollow">http://exoticpets.about.com/cs/finches/a...</a><br>  <a href="http://zebrafinch.info" rel="nofollow">http://zebrafinch.info</a>|`|e76nQKKZaa	All they need is their cage, they find entertainment in the toys in their cage.

bFzu835Aaa	It means taking the fur in your hands and literally hand forming and helping separate the dogs fur into the cords you normally see them with. Generally the coat will kind of naturally start once they're about a year old, but you need to control how it goes from there so you don't end up with a dog that's one huge mat.<br>  <br>  Depending on how you want them you can leave them larger, or smaller. It is VERY time consuming however. You need to be prepared to work with the coat sometimes hours a day to keep it growing right when you're first starting. For the first 1-3 years it's diligent attention, everyday. Even a day or 2 of being lazy can cause a problem (trust me it's easier to just keep up with it, then try and fix it after). Most people can't cope with that kind of dedication just for the dogs coat. <br>  <br>   After the cords are started well though, it gets much easier. You still need to separate them (they tend to knot together) but it's easier and doesn't have to be so intense. In the beginning you will have dog hair everywhere, it's inevitable since you can't brush them and they just have so much of it. <br>  <br>  Have you looked at the Komondor Club of America to see if anyone in the club is close to you? Or check out the Komondor list on Yahoo Groups. They can be very helpful in helping find someone at least semi-close to you to help with the intense grooming job.|`|3n5I4FRcaa	If you want a more low maintenance coat, you could bring your dog to a groomer and have him clipped.

OxFsslN8aa	I am reading a book called "The other end of the leash" and this is a brief part - "Dogs spend long periods of time checking out poop, sniffing it, and sometimes eating it.  It makes no sense that your dog would offer you such a wonderful present if she were mad at you (like for leaving).  Some people think that their dog is defecating on the rug to spite them, so they yell at the dog, perhaps rubbing her nose in it or, worse, physiclaly hurting her.  Dogs who are treated this way cower in terror (not guilt) when their owner returns home but are much more likely to defecate on the rug out of nervousness or fear in the house, because who knows what that maniac will do next time he comes home"<br>  <br>  I don't know why your dog is pooping but I hope you can figure it out.|`|FnrAw2SQaa	he has annexity!<br>  Need to constult a trainer!|`|pLv0Ejt9aa	You have to house train him all over again.

A dog's personality can completely change after getting fixed. Is he doing #1 or #2, or both? I know not everyone will agree with everything I'm about to say, but I successfully potty trained my little 10 pounder at 4 months old (within a month of getting him) and never had any problems after that. Unless you either catch him in the act, or within 15 seconds, do not scold him (with one exception); he won't know why you're scolding him! I don't mean this to be offensive to you personally, but is he possibly doing #2 because you're not reading his communication with you when he has to go outside? <br>  <br>  If you catch him in the act or within 15 seconds of doing a #1, spank his butt 1 time (don't beat him, lightly spank him), pick him up (if he is small enough to pick up) and don't yell, but firmly say "NO!", and immediately take him outside. If he does a #1 that you don't see until sometime after he did it, take him to the spot and (lightly) put his nose in it, and forcefully say "did you do that?", wait a few seconds and do it again, and immediately take him outside. Do not spank him if you didn't see him do it! Anyone that wants to call me inhumane can kiss my a**, I love my dog with all my heart, it works! <br>  <br>  When you take him outside for potty, put him on a leash if you don't do that already. Take 2 treats with you, a treat for #1, and a treat for #2. When he goes, immediately give him a treat, and tell him what a good boy he is. <br>  <br>  VERY IMPORTANT!!! Clean, clean, clean, and clean! Get some stain remover with enzymes, even if you don't have carpet. Spray every area where he has gone in the past, and/or where he usually goes. Where dogs go potty is based on scents, usually where he, or other dogs have went potty before; it marks their territory. Even if you clean it up and can't smell it anymore, he can. Dogs have a sense of smell over 1,000 times better than humans. The enzymes in the cleaner remove the scents that tell him where he went potty before.<br>  <br>  Trainers are very "by the book" when it comes to potty training. They will tell you every exact thing to do, probably different that I just explained, and they will get the job done, it will just take longer.
4c047641be778d779abfa8ec0d667d8caa	I think you are doing everything right!  However, if your shepherd is still having issues then I think you are correct in assuming there maybe a deficiency.   <br>  Your dog may not be able to properly assimilate what he is getting.  I would try a variety of oils to help him get the most out of what you are giving.<br>  Also, what fish base are you using?  In food energetics Salmon is a "hot" energy and may not be what is best for your pet.  Herring might be a better choice as it is a "cold" food and will not add to the heat of dry, itchy skin.<br>  Have you checked with a holistic vet?

The purpose of skin and hair is to prevent things from leaving (such as water or heat) or entering (such as viruses and bacteria) the body.<br>  <br>  Your dog?s coat is made up almost entirely of protein. If his doesn?t have enough protein quantity and quality, hair may fall out or become dry, weak and brittle.<br>  <br>   suggest a good groom with bath, brush & blow dry to help get rid off excess dead hair & skin cells. Make sure he's on good quality food, plus supplementing with omega-3 fatty acids will help moisturize his skin & coat. If he's more itchy than normal, see your vet. And if his skin/coat quality is unusually poor (you can compare with his sibling), that may be symptomatic of another issue, such as hypothyroidism.

Some people put on oven mitts and even a protective mask and then pet the cat!<br>  <br>  Just try a little every day.  On Day One, try to get him out from his hiding spot.  One way you can do this is to purchase a semi-enclosed cat bed, which gives kitty a comfortable place to hide.  Do not bug your cat while he is in there.  In fact, don't pay attention to him while he is in there.  Then, he will use that place as his new hiding spot. Try to slowly have him get used to you.  You can put food near you or even in your hand (but please be careful if you do this).  He will eventually slowly being to trust you. <br>  <br>  My neighbor adopted a shy, stray cat on death row at a shelter. He was terrified at first, the poor kitty hid for days.  Now he is the friendliest cat I know.  Literally, the first time I ever say him I said "Hi Bob!" and he came right over to me, purring away. <br>  <br>  I would advise you to try this.  Giving the cat up is a risky venture for the cat.  There is no way you can guarantee that he will be well cared for.|`|K0uTjeWiaa	No ad on craiglist. There have been bunchers and abuses picking up cats there<br>   Just give it time. Give him free reign of the house and maybe try hand feeding some chicken and talking. He'll come around|`|Lrr1gSFcaa	He doesn't know how to act. Try giving him alot of love and affection. If you don't have other animals there is no reason not to let him out of the room.|`|db2025b820a04c944fcf1ff93dc0966aaa	if you let him out but leave food outside for him he willprobably gradually start to trust you and may start coming in of his own accord, it is very hard to tame a wild cat they will always be independant|`|0lWfBdejaa	stray cat some times try to get away from human contact even if they did at frist try to warm up to you the best thing for the cat would probably be to get him a home on a farm|`|nY2hZrUMaa	dont keep him locked in the room<br>  let him be free to go outdside<br>  give him lots of affection and treats<br>  slowly gain his trust|`|lYgoEOJ7aa	He's still getting used to his surroundings!  Give him time to warm up to you.  He's been outdoors most of his life- so being in a room is probably weird for him... he'll come around - just give him attention, dont chase him around though - <br>  <br>  Do you have any other animals in the house that may have scared him?|`|rfm4W1Bkaa	I would try and give him more affection. If he eventually doesn't get better then take him to the pound or a farm sounds like a good idea. maybe a horse stable would welcome him.
WWhYCAbSaa	"ADD: I remember when we used to go to the dog park people with larger dogs thought they owned the place"<br>  <br>  The dog parks in our area are segregated.  <br>  <br>  "<br>  These are our first dogs on our own so we are learning"<br>  <br>  I thought you said your first dog was a Shih Tzu when you were a kid.<br>  <br>  I have small dogs now, had bigger ones in the past, and never felt any hostililty.<br>  <br>  Edit: I haven't seen any hostility on here against small dogs or their owners.   I've just seen ignorant comments about Pit Bulls.|`|zeXMAsF7aa	I don't hate the people that have them as long as they don't put them in shirts and stuff. They are dogs not dolls if they want to play dress up then get a doll or teddy bear. I don't like most little dogs they look like ugly little rats and they are worthless. thats my 2 cents|`|AA10029366	I think small dog (especially toy breed) owners get stereotyped because there are so many of them who seem to follow the rule that, if a dog is small, it doesn't need training.<br>  <br>  I don't know if they think it's because the dog is too cute to discipline, too endearing to require anything of, or too harmless to bother controlling, but it seems to be a common theme.<br>  <br>  When a Chihuahua snarls and lunges at another dog walking by, the owner thinks it's hilarious.<br>  <br>  I very much appreciate and respect that you are training your dogs...but I think the stereotype comes from a very real place.|`|cY8DgJv5aa	I've never once encountered any hatred in reference to the size of dog that I have.  I've had both large and small dogs and again, I've never had anyone say anything rude, hateful nor offensive to me.  Even if they attempted to, its not something I'd take to heart.  Everyone is entitled to their own opinions.  If people don't like small dogs, then that's their business.  It doesn't affect me.|`|t9Fxx75uaa	We live in a macho society and right now the bully breeds, rotties, dobies and other such dogs are the "in" thing.  Also dogs like chihuahuas have a reputation for being yappy (even though they may not be) then we have the cross breed maltipoos, shipoos, chipoos etc that many people (breed snobs) seem to have a problem with because they are mixed breeds.  I have a small dog because I have back and neck problems and when I walk my son's husky (whom I adore), I can't move for 2 days afterward.  Also, I travel alot and a small dog travels better in the car or plane.  I also like my dog on my lap and in bed with us and a big dog is a problem with that (no room).<br>  I say, everyone to themselves and do not judge other's choices for dogs, for they have their reasons for picking the dogs that they like.  No need for you to be sort of apologetic as you seem to be because you have a small dog.  Vive la difference and live and let live.|`|cIqpL3tGaa	Yeah, small dogs arent real.<br>  <br>  I laugh when I see a big huge man walking down the street with this small dog.|`|mOayTJDmaa	I've only been bit by small dogs.|`|d5781f30069ecf14d7c481d2dc40aec7aa	I am with Loki ... It seems like with small dogs so many owners don't bother actually training them. If your large breed has major behavioral issues it MUST be dealt with while many small dogs have LARGE issues that get ignored because they are small animals. Beyond that ... I personally prefer larger breeds ... just because that is what I was raised with and my husband and I are both big (and fairly clumsy) people, small PEOPLE get accidentally injured around us ... a small dog wouldn't stand a chance! ;)|`|DpT9qJ6Naa	I have both--giant breed-Mastiff and a toy breed -Toy Fox Terriers.<br>  What I don't like about toy and small breeds is that some owners think it's "cute" when their little dog acts out, barks at  or bites people.  That is just bad doggie manners for any dog! <br>  <br>  ALL dogs should be trained and well behaved. PERIOD.<br>  <br>  Is all about responsible pet ownership.|`|gbR74o7vaa	There is a lot of issues against small dogs. I don't really get it. I have a german shepard husky mix and a miniature daschund. Both are females and I love them to death. People are always talking about the fact that they are small and are scared of everything. I tell people to adopt a smaller dog and maybe they'll understand. Trixey (my daschund) is the sweetest thing on earth and luvs to run and around and play. If you look at her you'd think she couldn't hurt a fly but so far she's taken on our neighbor's pit bull about 4 times and our other neighbor's doberman. (you'd laugh ur butt off it u saw her or any of our other daschunds chase them off). <br>  <br>  In some ways it's good to have a smaller dog. They are cheaper to feed and it doesn't take as much effort to take care of them so you can enjoy them more. They are good for apartments too.|`|6rCjXItVaa	This is funny...I'm actually a small dog ower [2x].  Everyone always wants to pet them and I've never directly recieved comments about my dogs size from strangers.<br>  <br>  Now, on the other hand, my dad classifies them as rats since they only own large dogs.  I just laugh and love them all!<br>  <br>  <a href="http://i227.photobucket.com/albums/dd86/radianze/IMG_2119.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://i227.photobucket.com/albums/dd86/...</a>|`|rRmVEOh3aa	Who really cares if people don't like you because you have a tiny dog? It's there problem and they need to get over it. If you like your dog, it won't matter what the other people think.|`|8TLCxEJzaa	really there is no war going on. i hav a chihuahau there the smallest of all dogs. pplz dont hate me for having a small dog they seem to want my chihuahua.
W02kTOqmaa	It is a very dominant behavior. If you stare at a very dominant dog, then you do run the risk of getting nipped at, especially if you get right in their face and do it. Something that shouldn't be done with strange dogs, lol.<br>  <br>  Very submissive dogs will look away, and if you are right up in their face, they can pull away, as well.<br>  <br>  It's not always set that they will either bite or pull away. Our old husky would just lay there and stare right back, and it became a staring contest. I always won, of course, you can never let a dog have the dominant upper hand, but sometimes we would sit there 5 minutes staring at eachother. And some dogs just look away.|`|6sjphNcPaa	never seen that. It might depend on the breed. Pit bulls are scary and unpredictable.<br>  <br>  My golden is a sweetheart and would only lick your face.|`|YUQgyPT3aa	Not completely true<br>  <br>  <br>  Eye contact is acceptable, staring for a period of time is different. Ceasar will NOT hold a stare with me...he will with my husband, but never snaps.<br>  <br>  I run the household...lol|`|SLeX0gGaaa	You should try it.|`|s4OtfZ7Gaa	if it is a dominate/aggressive dog, yes you have the opportunity to get attacked. if they are submissive, or see you as their leader they will look away. this is the way it works in dog packs also. if a dominant dog stares down a dog who is lower on the totem pole the other dog will look away. if both are dominant and they stare each other down it could cause a dog fight. that is why you should never introduce dogs face to face the first time you allow them to meet.|`|c4PcSxzWaa	Staring any dog in the eyes is a question of dominance.<br>  Most dogs should look away to acknowledge you as the Alpha. Some will some wont. I have a Rotty that will look away if I look him in the eye he is acknowledging my dominance. However puppies don't understand yet, so they dint care, they will probably try to bite your nose.|`|0m6BgESXaa	It depends on the dog.<br>  <br>  If the dog hasn't been trained with a watch command, it can be threatening.  Submissive dogs will avert their eyes and try to avoid more contact.  Dominant dogs are apt to retaliate and try and take control of the situation.<br>  <br>  You shouldn't be doing this with any dog other than yours, or a dog you know extremely well|`|sIIzW59Qaa	Yes never look into dogs eyes it's like challenging the dog to a fight unless you've known the dog along time and are both really close then that changes .|`|KuUx34hCaa	this is showing dominance & is a Challenge & a dominant dog will fight|`|3DlwawEqaa	ive heard something like that before but im not positive that its true|`|Os6VjLH0aa	Yes, it is, direct eye contact is a challenge in dog language.|`|6u07c7Hraa	YES do not try enless you trust the dog!|`|k7wPar5vaa	yes, animals often have stare downs before a fight it is a threat. You need to well establish yourself as the alpha for them to not take eye contact as a threat. It could be a symbol of trust if you are well bonded.|`|ERrxkSmRaa	Yes, They Get Scared And Think You Will Hurt/Betray Them, I would Not Do It|`|wp3vYFB9aa	ive heard its true..|`|342b3711423c978836fa192cef3238d8aa	All of my dogs are trained to make eye contact - it's an essential part of training.  And they enjoy it.  They don't feel threatened, they don't pull away and they're certainly not inclined to bite.  However, you'd be really stupid to stare at a dog you don't know because you don't have a relationship with that dog and the dog would definitely consider it a threat.  Dogs and humans do not use the same body language naturally, it comes with training.|`|2O58btqxaa	yes thats true dont try it they may bite
9GMePSopaa	Hamsters are definitely the easiest to care for :)<br>  <br>  However, I'd go for a mouse!<br>  They're wayy cuter :D<br>  I find that they're much more friendly and entertaining also.<br>  <br>  I guess it's all down to your personal preference. You should just pop into your local pet shop and have a look at each animal and ask a worker on advice and information, you'll soon see which is your favourite :)|`|VmLZFN4Taa	Same thing happened to me with the fish.<br>  <br>  2 rats, they need home made or bought food, water bottle, reasonably sized cage, a vet, and love.<br>  <br>  edit<br>  <br>  Heat hurts all rodents really bad..A fan or something would help greatly|`|juyA6HUJaa	I wanted a hamster at first but if you think about it its not the best choice, hamsters cages get smelly, they can bite, they sleep in the day and get up at night (making a lot of wheel noise if they are in your bedroom and are really quite annoying)... guinea pigs however are lovely, they don't really smell, they dont bite, you dont loose them running away and they live a lot longer, I'd say a guinea pig... however they do need very big cages and are kept in pairs + so usually cost more money.|`|v1tHjJ3haa	I would recommens either a fabcy rat or dumbo rat or mice they're pretty easy to take care of and they're a joy :D|`|v8sJy3BYaa	I would agree hamsters are easiest to take care of. Guinea pigs take alot of work (I have 3). I also know that you can be very amazed by mices intelligence :)|`|tfgAayNgaa	Hamsters are not easy to care for! Sure you can feed them and let them exercise, but You HAVE TO STOP THEM FROM EATING EACH OTHER!!!  I would suggest one hamster, but if you want two, make sure the father is not one of the two, or the mother! I had four and then they all suddenly fattened up. They ate the smallest of them! It was pretty gross so I say get something besides cannibals! ;]<br>  <br>  They also smell really bad because they constantly exercise so all that sweat coats their coat and you can't shower them, they bite.<br>  <br>  They poop so much!!!! It's horrible! and they wake you up at night!!!<br>  <br>  You can't really play with Hamsters. I say get a guinea pig, They look cuter and are bigger so you won't accidentally step on them if they get loose. Again, No HAMSTERS!!!|`|aiIS83Onaa	if the main idea is something simple, mice or hamsters are better.<br>  I like guinea pigs much, much better though. they don't smell, and they don't really wet themselves, they don't bite, kick, or chew through/climb walls, and they are pretty smart compared to, like, rabbits and hamsters. they are more social and sort of equivalent to a small lap dog with shortened legs ^^ of course, often you buy them from petstores or somewhere where they are already adults and have never been socialized with people, and then it's very hard to get them used to you.|`|tV5noo9Raa	I have a Hamster. All you have to do is feed him, water him, and clean out his cage.

MKdR8MIUaa	Hi, My name is Tucker and I'm an Australian Shepherd.  My full name is Watermark's Never Tuckers Out - to reflect my energy level.  But I respond to several different nicknames a well.  A dog can learn a new name very quickly.  Think about it - a lot of times no one knows the name of a stray dog.  You can either just start using the new name in all kinds of good situations. Or you can use the old and new together for a while - like "Precious Polly", then use just "Polly".  Remember to pick something short and easy to say.  And something that doesn't sound like anything else you say often. (That's more confusing than a change.)<br>  The first website has a list of dog names.  (The second two are my website and blog.)  I wish you and your new dog - whatever you name her -  well.|`|13xTQ5lsaa	Name her what you want - it doesn't have to rhyme.  Dogs get used to a completely different name in a few days - just talk to her a lot saying her new name.  A name change won't add any stress to the dog (they don't care what they're named - just that they have one and belong to someone who loves them!)  Congrats on the adoption!|`|KxjUim7yaa	First all I could think of was Nauseous. But then i thought of another, Vicious. Sorry I suck at picking names.|`|4qUVll5Yaa	Dr. Precious?<br>  Mr. Precious?<br>  Mrs. Prescious?<br>  Miss Precious?<br>  Just trying to help!|`|HgMFrllLaa	I'd change the name to either :<br>  USS Ronald Reagan or<br>  Maria.<br>  They both rhyme well with precious if you tried hard enough.|`|rjXAPafhaa	You may just have to pick something that ends in the "cious" sound.  Personally, I like facetious.|`|AA12128656	how about cookie? three out of my 7 think that's their other name...|`|bIaywrBCaa	It is hard to think of a name rhyming with Precious. A dog can get used to a new name very quickly. How about Bellalicious, use it for awhile the shorten it to Bella.Or Dellalicious and shorten it to Della. Sorry can't be much help. Dogs get used to new names because sometimes dogs are dumped at the pound or on a country road and no one knows their first name so they just start using a new one and the dog will learn it quickly thru repetition.

Your son is almost guaranteed to be jumped on and/or chased, as puppies are rambunctious dorks. Labs are especially hyperactive. They're great dogs, sure, but they're monstrous little puppies. ..most puppies are monstrous.<br>  <br>  Your best bet would be to adopt a calm, reserved, cheerful dog who has proven itself excellent around kids. For instance, just the other week I was watching an episode of something-or-other on Animal Planet about dogs. One of the dogs was adopted into a family with a young autistic child -- and the two were perfect for each other. Find your perfect match!|`|AA10400143	I agree with moof.

They don't shed as much however require an occasional hair cut.<br>  <br>     It is most likely best to get a puppy so the dog can get used to your son. Just keep and eye on it because it will take a little getting used too. If your still not sure try out the Dog Selector.

bFzu835Aaa	Birds shouldn't "look pregnant" for 2 weeks! Usually the day before you might notice the area around her bottom looking a little larger. They don't hold eggs very long, and you can only see anything right before they're ready to lay. For a bird to be noticeably large for that long, normally signals something else wrong with the bird. <br>  <br>  Besides that obvious point, birds, if not ready or prepared properly (physically and mentally) to have a clutch of eggs, it's not uncommon for them to eat or destroy an egg leaving little to no trace behind....|`|vbEkYH2haa	Budgies don't get pregnant and they don't get fat when producing an egg. Eggs only take a few days to develop and the only visible sign one is close to being layed is their droppings get very large and their vent swells. <br>  <br>  i would say your budgie has a fatty deposit on her belly. They can come and go over time, but they get worse with age. I would recommend not breeding with her, and possibly putting her on a diet to help loose some of the fat.|`|RT8LZy7gaa	Sometimes the eggs are fragile and will break when they're layed.  The bird will eat the shells for the calcium. So there would probably be no evidence.  Hopefully she's not eggbound, if she doesn't seem to be straining thats probably not the issue.|`|bfc067ab537555ada57edd464a8dfb97aa	If she hasn't been near a male its unlikely she ever was.. <br>  are you giving her enough calcium fortified grit?<br>  She might have just been constipated.|`|OyNJTWaiaa	Hallowsweets is right. Another point to make is to feed eggshells they must be cooked to destroy bacteria that is very common in eggshells and then powdered up to a fine powder. Feeding eggshells that look like egg shells still can make a bird eat eggs.

BL2NfTafaa	The main benefits of spaying in female dogs : <br>  1. Eliminates the possibility of uterine or ovarian cancer and also greatly reduces the incidence of breast cancer, especially if your dog is neutered before her first heat. <br>  2. No chance of neighborhood male dogs fronting up at your doorstep when she does come into heat <br>  3. No mess - female dogs will spot blood during their heat - this could last up to 3 weeks. <br>  4. No false pregnancies or infection of the uterus (pyometra) which can be life threatening. <br>  5. Reduced incidence of mammary, ovarian and uterine tumors<br>  <br>  Have your male fixed too.<br>  <br>  The main benefits of neutering in male dogs : <br>  1. Eliminates prostate problems - the prostate gland enlarges as a dog ages when it's under the influence of testosterone. This can result in constipation and makes it very uncomfortable for the dog. The prostate gland can also get infected which would inevitably  mean the dog has to be neutered anyway to treat it. <br>  2. It reduces aggression in male dogs - not always true but usually if an aggressive entire male dog is presented at a veterinary clinic, the first thing the vet will recommend is neutering. <br>  3. It reduces wandering behavior and does seem to also reduce sexual drive (humping is less likely) <br>  4. Neutered dogs are less driven to urine mark everything in sight. <br>  5. There are already too many unwanted dogs in pounds and shelters, don't assume that just because you have a male dog that you're not adding to the problem - it takes 2 to tango - you are just as at fault if your male dog isn't neutered and sets about making the neighborhood females pregnant.<br>  <br>  P.S. Neutering can be used for males or females in the dictionary!<br>  Neutering, from the Latin neuter (of neither sex[1]), is the removal of an animal's reproductive organ, either all of it or a considerably large part.<br>  (1)^ University of Notre Dame online Latin dictionary|`|3Rrlii0Laa	You will not have an unexpected litter of puppies which you will probably have to give up to a shelter.<br>  <br>  No mess when they are in heat.<br>  <br>  There are numerous health benefits (Talk to your Vet)<br>  <br>  They live longer.|`|cIqpL3tGaa	benefit, she doesnt get knocked up.|`|np6W9hnsaa	I would get both dogs altered. <br>  Being spayed, females are clear from breast cancer and accidental pregnancies. You also don't worry about heat cycles since she won't have them. Personally, I'd feel a lot more relaxed. <br>  <br>  For the male, humping is common and their impulse to hump is a lot less to zero. Males can get prostate cancer. <br>  <br>  I would advise getting both altered. And before the male comes into the house, you should have the female spayed.|`|JiCKFTuIaa	Biggest benefit,,, they will never again go into heat on the opening day of pheasant season, and ruin the hunt for everyone else.<br>  <br>  PS<br>  Both "spay" and "castrate" = neuter|`|ZT0K3q2Aaa	Spayed by the way.Spaying your female is best to prevent more unwanted dogs coming into this world.|`|YUQgyPT3aa	It would be Spayed...not neutered.<br>  <br>  No unwanted pups....no nasty heat cycles...|`|cY8DgJv5aa	Yes, any dog you ever get should be spayed/neutered (unless you are a  breeder).<br>  <br>  For every heat cycle that she's gone through, her chances have increased of getting cancer.  Being spayed will greatly reduce her risks of developing cancer later in life.  Also, there's no way to guarantee that she NEVER gets outside.  It would only take one time for some male dog to come around (and they are attracted by the smell she omits) and she'd get pregnant.<br>  <br>  As for the male dog, a neutered male won't have as many aggression issues as an intact male.  That's the big one when it comes to males.|`|d5781f30069ecf14d7c481d2dc40aec7aa	No benefits to neutering a female ... spaying however has may benefits (just teasing you a tiny bit)<br>  <br>  Not only do you not have to deal with the mess of heat cycles with a spayed dog you eliminate the dangers of pregnancy and also eliminate the risk of uterine infections and many cancers.<br>  <br>  Benefits to also neutering your dog's male companion include a possible reduction in aggression, reduction or elimination of marking behavior and elimination of risk for some cancers.<br>  <br>  Neuter and Spay is the way!|`|IX9znFLAaa	The benefits would be when she is fertile the few times a year, you won't have male dogs coming around your house.  It certainly isn't necessary to have both done.  In my experiences, it is much easier to have the male done.  It is cheaper and requires him to be at the vet for just a short while.  It also will make the male dog a bit more docile when becomes three or so.|`|XDE8F7Bdaa	It's not necessary to desex both dogs.

As long as there is not some blatant abuse to be reported, ignorance is not illegal and cannot be controlled.  The only thing you can do is try to remove your dog from the situation and protect him.  I would tell the guy not to pet or tease or respond to my dog in any way because it is interferring with my personal training of my dog.  I would never allow anyone, regardless of proximity, to tease or torture my dog, especially to the extent that he would incite him to be aggressive.  You do not have to tolerate that, but it may take some effort in your special situation to get your point across or be successful in your efforts.

If that's true, then I most certainly am NOT happy. What he did was a terrible thing, and I personally think that he should have been put in jail for much longer than he was. In fact, I think he should have stayed there until he died. <br>  <br>  The money he was forced to pay for the dog's care isn't even going to come close to what they need to care for them their entire lives. <br>  <br>  Honestly, he should be ashamed of himself. What he did to those poor animals was pure torture, and I think he should be left to suffer the same fate. <br>  <br>  If it weren't for places like Bad Rap and Best Friends, these dogs would most likely be dead. But they're doing great. The first of the 22 Vick dogs at Best Friends is ready for adoption, and the rest are soon to follow.|`|b4b38acbe2582b7a823dd09b00982594aa	No. Why would I be?

DpT9qJ6Naa	A Mokie is a designer dog--a cross between a Yorkie and a Maltese.<br>  <br>  If you buy a puppy with lots of behavior or health issues--was it really a good deal?  Most of these dogs are bred by puppy mills and by BYB looking to make a buck.<br>  <br>  Why not go to your local animal shelter or rescue group and adopt a dog?  Most AKC breed clubs have rescue organizations and you can adopt a dog from one of them.<br>  <br>  Do a bit more research on the breeds that interest you--go visit some breeders.  Make sure that the dog you get is the right dog for you and your life style.  Don't buy something just because it's a "good Buy". :(( what breed you a|`|jlIiv0jTaa	Yes they are good deals but make sure the person selling them is actually a breeder because my sister recently got a calvalier king charles and it wasnt from a breeder and she had quite a few problems with her AND we also got her off e-pupz which is a web site for only breeders and not for just hobbies|`|UgE2nTnGaa	It depends on a lot of things.

A dog is much more than just a commodity, and shopping around for the lowest price is just setting yourself up for failure and heartache.  Instead, people should spend time looking for a responsible and reputable breeder.  At home breeders that do health tests and breed not to make money, but for a genuine love of the breed and to improve the bloodlines of the breed itself.|`|iXijnCxOaa	Don't fall for the "Morkie" crap either... its a mutt composed of Maltese and Yorkie (usually with both parents being of such low quality that its not worth breeding them as purebreds).<br>  <br>  Find a breed - research it.  Contact the parent club for the breed.<br>  <br>  Or..<br>  <br>  go on Petfinder and get a rescued dog.|`|AA11244754	A "morkie" is just a fancy name for a mutt that is a cross between a maltese and a yorkie to get more money out of people that want to feel good about overpaying for a mutt who don't have anything better to do with their money than blow it and instead of getting a dog online, you need to actually go in person to see the puppies and make sure that they are healthy, because anybody can find a pic of a cute little dog and put it up on a website claiming that they have the dog for sale so people that don't know any better, are silly and clueless enough to send these scammers money for a non-existant dog and they are stuck being out the money.  Be smart and go to your local shelter or find a rescue online in your area and see the dog yourself before making up your mind.|`|EUsIDbHsaa	Well, I got two of my three dogs off of kijiji.  It is simply online classified ads, but you have to be very careful with scams.  It is difficult to find yorkshires for 200.00 and it could be a scam.  When we bought our English bulldog we ran into a lot of scams.  You think your getting a good deal, but they get money and you never get the pup. Never give anyone your personal info, especially if they are wanting to ship the dog, but are asking to recieve payment first.  But a Morkie is a cross between a maltese and a yorkie.  I have two different "designer breeds" or in other words, mutts. :)  I have a chorkie, her mom was chihuahua and yorkie mix and her dad was full yorkie, shes an AMAZING dog and absolutely adorable!  And I have a chatese, which is maltese and chihuahua.  They are both absolutely adorable dogs and have the best of both breeds.  Mix breed dogs are just that, mixes.  They are great and there is nothing wrong with them.  Just get what you want.  Go and visit the home where the pupies are at and make sure they are living in good conditions!

AA11946812	Humping in dogs is a dominance thing.  Your dog is trying to tell you that SHE is in charge.

Its trying to tell you "hey, im the alpha, you command to me" <br>  <br>  a way to solve this is put your dog on her back, and hold your hands around her neck, and say "NO" sternly.

Try offering different types of food.|`|OjYhh4Oxaa	at that age they should be eating 50 - 100 small to medium sized crickets per day.<br>  you should buy in bulk from flukerfarm.com , you will save alot of $ rather than a pet store.<br>  and also, what are you hand feeding him? <br>  good things for him to eat besides crickets everyday are collard green, ROMAINE lettuce, cilantro, carrots, kale,apples,bannana, parsely and other dark leafy greens.<br>  dont give him anythin acidic like lemons/limes/ oranges.<br>  <br>  for best substrate you wanna try slate, unadhesive tile flooring or newspaper.<br>  <br>  how big is the cage, what kinds of lights are you using etc...<br>  if you put alot of details its so much easier to help you. <br>  <br>  goodluck and hope the beardies okay. put up some more info & ill see if i can give more advice.|`|IgXbO6Yhaa	Firstly, if the lizard is in with other lizards he should be removed and placed in a quarantine enclosure for observation and treatment.<br>  While it is true that lizards do not need to eat every day it is very unusual for them not to eat.<br>  Vomiting can be quite common and if he's vomited just once then I would not worry. If, as you say, it looks as if he's vomited a couple of times at least, this could indicate some kind of poisoning but is difficult to confirm. You will need to observe him closely watching for disturbances and stress factors. What bothers me more than anything is the fact that if he's not eaten anything - then it stands to reason that there should be nothing in the stomach to vomit. Are you sure it's not diarrhoea? If theres any chance of this being diarrhoea then a fecal examination will be required and needs to be done by a vet - if possible a vet with reptile experience. There really is just one very firm rule with lizards - if you even suspect an illness - get the animal to the vet, do not try to administer any form of medication yourself.<br>  <br>  Hope that helps?
wZTooDziaa	I've bathed many puppies and the best thing is to make the bath time fun.  When you are scrubbing him down, try singing to him and praising him.  Avoid yelling or getting stressed because they can since your feelings.  When you are finished, make sure you praise them and give them a treat.  After awhile, they will enjoy their baths.  Hope this helps.|`|aO1uVDvPaa	i would suggest having a small bowl filled with water placed on the ground and try to get your puppy used to being in water and then slowly getting larger bowls and when you think he is ready, go try the bath, i hope i helped|`|oKz6CEjdaa	put his dog toys in pool and also give him treats|`|280d96ad7b5e9ffad03a34a66cac5db0aa	First of all, you're going to give him horribly itchy, dry, flaky skin if you continue to bathe him so often. Few dogs require bathing that is anywhere near frequent.<br>  <br>  Start with something simple. Bring him in the bathroom; if he's unfazed, give him plenty of tasty treats. <br>  Once you know for a fact that he's comfortable at that point, take a step closer to the bathtub. Treat, treat, treat. <br>  Step closer. Treat. <br>  Step closer. <br>  Et cetera, et cetera. <br>  Have him touch the bathtub, treat. <br>  Have him eat treats from its ledge. <br>  Put him in the [dry] tub, and give him tons of treats. <br>  Have him eat them from the floor, the ledge, the faucet, wherever. <br>  Turn on the water at a very tiny lukewarm trickle and give him treats. <br>  Lure him closer to the trickling water via a trail of treats. <br>  Let him lick some water from your hands or from the faucet. Treat, treat, treat. <br>  Increase the water flow ever so slightly. <br>  Then more, and more. <br>  Dab some on his chest. <br>  Dab some on his back. <br>  Pour a tiny amount. <br>  Pour a slightly larger amount. <br>  Rub some into his fur. <br>  Leave the shampoo near him while he eats to form a positive assocation (shampoo = food = good things). <br>  Let him smell it, give him treats. <br>  Let him smell it while he's in the tub, treat. <br>  Put a tiny bit on your hand.<br>  Put a tiny bit in his fur. <br>  Give him a water, sudsy massage.<br>  Use some more water.<br>  <br>  You've apparently managed to traumatize him. Now, you have to desensitize him to the problem. You're going to have to go **SLOWLY.** There's no rush! Each step is just that, a step. Do not advance to the next step until he is 110% comfortable with the current step, or you know he won't be able to handle the next step. If he freaks out, take a step back, or several steps back. This is NOT going to be solved in a day. Work with him every single day in plenty of short, fun sessions - note the word "fun." It may take awhile.<br>  <br>  Don't skimp on the treats. That won't help in any way. Make sure you're using something he really loves, like chicken, cheese, hot dog, whatever he goes crazy for. Cut it up into very tiny pieces. Treat him well for *every single success.* Really give him a jackpot of treats if he does well. For every step completed, give him ten or fifteen of the little treats. Praise him! Hug him! Make the tub a fun place. Feed him in it! Play with him in it!<br>  <br>  About using plenty of treats, someone I know recently explained "why" in a way that made a lot of sense to me. She said something to the effect of, "If someone wanted me to take parachuting lessons and would pay me $50 to do so, I'd say no way. Forget it. If they would pay me $50,000, I'd be on the line with the parachuting school before they were finished offering." You're asking him to do something that he obviously finds quite scary (like parachuting). You can't expect him to go along with it for a dinky treat every once in awhile. Give him the $50,000!|`|jlIiv0jTaa	its because hes still very young and you shouldnt bath him untill hes 12 weeks old because i have just got a cavalier king charles and she is scared of water to but before i got her i got a golden retreiver 2 years ago and he didnt  do all this he just sat there in the bath and quietly whimperd and if it still doesnt like it by 12 weeks just get in the bath with it and cuddle it loads and it should calm down.:) :) :) :) :) :)
w4DIPHf1aa	the reason you raise the heat to treat ich is that they can only be killed in one of there 3 cycles of life.<br>  <br>  <br>  83 degreees treat for 10 days<br>  <br>  78 degrees treat for 16 days<br>  <br>  72 degrees you have to treat for about 30 days......<br>  <br>  <br>  if you have liquid ich cure, just use half the dose every 3 days.<br>  <br>  it's not the strength of the meds but the duration that matters..<br>  <br>  i like liquid quick cure.<br>  <br>  and put the cartidge back in the filter minus the carbon thats in it.<br>  <br>  <br>  good luck|`|mOayTJDmaa	Get a heater.  They aren't that expensive.  It helps to have the tank at least 80.  Ich can't live in the higher temps.|`|2kjGc7xvaa	It will take a week+ for the ich to reach the stage in it's life cycle that it can be killed. When ich is on the fish it is in a sac that can not be penetrated. These fall off and further develop in the gravel (again can not be killed at this point either). They than "hatch" from their sack and the parasite freely swims in the water until it finds a home i.e. your fish. The only time ich can be killed is when it is in it's free swimming stage. With that said this cycle can be quit long especially in cooler water. Without a heater you are looking at 1-2 weeks.|`|TjLCnxkKaa	If you are going to the expense of treating the fish why not splash out the few bucks for a heater. Turn the temperature up to 80-82 for about two weeks to speed up the free swimming part of the parasites life cycle. You can only kill it at this stage.<br>  <br>  At the lower temperature this stage will take much longer and longer treatment times mean more water changes and more stress on the fish.<br>  <br>  Have a read here <a href="http://freshaquarium.about.com/cs/disease/p/ich.htm" rel="nofollow">http://freshaquarium.about.com/cs/diseas...</a><br>  <br>  good luck|`|AA10344737	You really need to get a heater.  The ich can survive in these temps.  Not to mention, lower temps are just bad for some tropical fish anyway.  <br>  <br>  You might also want to try adding a smidgen of sea salt into your water.  This helps battle diseases.

Bear in mind that degus and chinchillas needs lots of hay which can cause allergies.<br>  <br>  Edit: and just so you know, there is no guarantee that you wont be allergic to a poodle, some people are. Please ensure the animal you want doesnt cause allergies before you buy, even if it is supposedly hypoallergenic because no mammal or bird is truly hypoallergenic.|`|mgdkr6hvaa	well i have a frog, but they don't do much and you have to feed them bugs.<br>  Turtles are cool, or chameleons, i had a chameleon and he was awesome but he also ate bugs.|`|zhzJoZ26aa	I think a perfect pet for you and you're family would be a cat. There is hypoallergenic cat's but they can be a bit more expensive. They're also very quiet (unless they're hungry), affectionate, but you will have to get a screen door or keep your door closed, I know my cats and my cats, cudds at least likes the outside from being a kitten he's ran out many times (remember looking for him at like 10 at night XD?) I probably wouldn't recommend a dog for an apartment (if you recall Bud, he needed to live in a big area) they need a lot of exercise, and can bother the people downstairs. The only thing is about the cat is that I'm worried Brandon might be a little too rough, but he was good with Buddy so there shouldn't be a problem. If you want a pet that will repel me, get a ferret. They're quite, CAN be nice and not bite you. A short hair bunny may also be a good idea, cute, fun and quiet. Maybe you're best option is to go into nature and ask someone who works there what would be best for you, and you're family. Because you need something that is 1) not too loud 2)clean, and hypoallergenic|`|eKiDXLDtaa	Frog, Turtle, Gecko, Rat, Hamster.|`|knFrwCxcaa	Rats?|`|sTljKncgaa	a rabbit cute and cuddly. easy to litter train.
oF3O8jGSaa	it looks fine to me but gerbils like to dig so they say that a glass cage is better becuz then the bedding cant get out. but the cage looks very well built. when i got gerbils they loved the cage i got they could go under it  and dig and sleep in the bottom. so i would say sure just make sure its pet proof if you have pets.|`|1dqYorceaa	I would recommend a plastic cage with a ventalation bar at the top.<br>  If you buy this cage you might find your gerbils will keep you up all night by chewing on the bars. And you may find the gerbils will chew on the plastic levels and wheel. And your gerbil may fall on one of the levels, and brake a bone.<br>  I was going to buy the gerbilairium but i thought it was to expencive.<br>  So i got a plastic cage from pets at home for around ￡20-￡25 and its worked very well. Bearing in mind you will have to bu a suction water bottle you can also get from pets at home. It will attach to the inside of the cage. Its only about ￡3<br>  I hope this helps|`|wZHxtRJiaa	that looks goo. you don't have to use a glass tank. i have to gerbils and i don't use a glass tank anyways i had a cage that the bars went to the plastic and they connected well my gerbil liked to chew and starteed chewing what plastic that was sticking out and evuntually made a hole i was in school and came home to a empty cage. i found the gerbil. just make sure they can't chew threw it|`|rNJVcq4Daa	its ok but the crittertrail ones are better.

However, gerbils love to run around and that cage doesn't really have a lot of room for running so you might have to take them out to play often. Also, someone mentioned this which is very true. They like to dig so expect to clean bedding off the floor. When i had a cage like that, bedding was everywhere!<br>  <br>  -Brooke

They are social creatures, they literally require your companionship. I think you should have addressed the issue of your pets more thoroughly before this happened. If your discussion did make it clear that she could sleep upstairs, then your fiance has no ground to stand on. He's a liar. You wanna marry a liar? (Okay, that sounded harsh.) But anyway. She's your dog. It should be a 50/50 relationship. Why does your fiance get to call all the shots? You are both mature adults. Think about it, if you can't even agree on a matter as simple as where a dog will sleep, how are you to going to agree on anything concerning your kid? (..That sounded harsh, too.) Okay, anyway, I guess you can either stand your ground (which you have every right to do), or you can choose.

oNHtVHzsaa	yeah i think it's great. hamsters get bored, and this gives them a new way to explore their surroundings and get some exercise. also, they cant bite or get lost because the ball is protecting them. usually when they stop moving around and start to sit there, they are tired and want to go back in their cage. good luck and hope this helped.|`|rchaTSI9aa	Hamster balls are great. Hammies love to run all around the house in these things. They shouldn't cause stress to the hamster, I mean, you're just giving it freedom, which all hamsters love. So yeah, it's a safe way for the hamster to explore and have fun, as well as it's fun for us to watch them run around with a smile on their face.|`|HW8ybM2Paa	$ the boys theyre ginormus~ girls theyre ginormus as well~ ohh you mean hamster excersise balls! ohhhh ok theyre great u just need to duct tape the opening because my hamster escaped 3 times in it and went behind the fridge , it came out but its a hassle|`|oF3O8jGSaa	hammster balls are great! when i had my hamsters they loved to go inside there ball but get a big one for it though.|`|juyA6HUJaa	actually hamster balls are bad for the hamster... yes they do get to run around but they dont know where they're going... why do you think they crash into objects/walls/doors, it's not for fun its because they use their whiskers etc to sence where they're going... in a colourful piece of plastic they have no idea and may aswell be on a wheel in the cage.
Idunjsxjaa	I have a male unneutered lionhead rabbit.  It did not take long at all although he did get a little confused after a month.  I made sure to put the litter box in the corner he was using to go to the bathroom.  But, as I said, after a month he was using another corner!  I did some reading and figured out the litter box I was using was too small.  I bought a bigger litter box and filled one end with the litter and the other with Timothy Hay and now all is well!   With having two rabbits using one litter box you may want to consider this!|`|hEVeqm1Raa	It took my boy un-neutered about 4 weeks.  I just moved his litter box to whereever he went and put the soiled bedding in it and eventually, he just picked a corner.  I read somewhere that it's really hard to train them before they are 4 months old.  Good luck!|`|knFrwCxcaa	mine toke a week both girls not spayed  1 year i just put a litter tray in their cage and they go in that so much easier now
XagPxe7Faa	I would invest in some NutriCal, just to be safe, and research hypoglaucemia (low blood sugar) and the signs of it's onset.  Yorkies are prone to it--particularly when they are young and out of their normal routine, as your little one will be while adjusting to her new home.<br>  Make sure that you have the appropriate toys to promote losing her baby teeth when the time comes.  Toy breeds are known for retaining their baby teeth, which have to be removed surgically later.  Anything you can do to help him in losing them may save you the hassle later.<br>  <br>  It sounds like you have really done your research and that you are preparing well.  Congrats and good luck!|`|UfisV9bEaa	a clock, it ticks and simulates the heat beat of the mother i would also have a warm hot water bottle, both use at night wrapped up in a piece of cloth/bedding from the nest so the pup has some familiar smells.|`|H3J6bN0Yaa	Definately encourage her into the yard to toilet. Housetraining needs to start straight away. I would recommend that you take her places with you, but carry her if there are other dogs around. Make sure she meets other friendly dogs that are fully vaccinated as soon as possible. Critical socialisation period is between 3-12 weeks old. That is why there is always a dispute between behaviourists and vets! Vets treat puppies who have been infected with parvo or similar because owners didn't carefully socialise, and behaviourists deal with undersocialised dogs that create problems in a pet home and are frequently put to sleep with nervous aggression. A compromise is to carry your dog to various places up until her vaccinations are up to date and mix her with vaccinated dogs so that she doesn't get any illnesses from unvaccinated dogs. There is such a slim chance she will catch anything if you are sensible. Better to have a well balanced dog who you socialised as much as possible up until 12 weeks than one you wrapped in cotton wool for too long that then lives 15 years like a nervous wreck and frightened of everything.<br>  Some bedding from the home she is currently in will help her settle better on the first few nights alone. A sample of the food she is used to should be requested from the breeder so you can gradually wean onto what you want to feed so that you don't upset her tummy. <br>  Treats made by James wellbeloved are hypoallergenic and suitable for most dogs. Small pieces of chicken can be given as a high value reward and won't upset her tummy. <br>  Try not to bath her too often but start getting her used to it when she is young so she accepts it and doesn't fear the whole bathing experience as she gets older.|`|IX9znFLAaa	It sounds like you have all the necessities.  Of course she can go in the back yard before she has her boosters.  Dogs need to be able to freely move around.  Especially puppies, that's how they learn, by running around, chasing small insects, and sniffing around.  I'm not a big treat person myself, dogs don't need them, they would rather have your attention and love.  However, when you start training it is a good idea to have treats until they associate the clicker (clicker method works best) with a behavior well done.  The treats can be anything but raw hides (small pieces can cause choking).  They should be breakable as puppies only need a little bit at a time.  <br>  Just like with a new baby, routine will help her adjust.  It doesn't have to be precise, but allowing the dog to eventually know what is next will give her comfort.  Puppies bond fairly quickly, but it helps if the first few days are devoted to her.  Most stores allow small dogs so take her with you!<br>  <br>  congrats on the addition!|`|np6W9hnsaa	For supplies, I would buy a small harness for when they're puppies they pull and since she's a small dog to begin with her neck if fragile. But she only has to wear the harness on walks.<br>  <br>  Old mother Hubbard are really good treats, but you could use plain/regular cheerios. <br>  I'm not sure about when you can give her a bath, you could ask the breeder and/or vet. <br>  I would supervise her in the backyard and make sure she doesn't eat anything. <br>  She'll probably cry for the first few nights, but you're going to have to ignore that. Don't let her start any bad habits, correct everything early on while you still have the chance. <br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|IddUYNR3aa	Boy, you've been on a shopping spree and are well equipped with things. All you need is a little advice.<br>  <br>  When to bathe a dog? When they are dirty and need it. There is no set schedule. I've had dogs that needed a bath every 6 weeks and a Newfoundland that almost never needed a bath. She was just clean and had no odor.<br>  <br>  If your puppy gets dirty, wash with warm water and a little dog shampoo and be sure she is really dry before she goes outside or gets chilled. You can use your hairdryer on warm. It's good to get her used to it.<br>  <br>  If she's a good eater, you can use her regular kibble as training treats. Otherwise, small bits of cooked chicken are good. Yes, she can go out in your yard if there aren't stray dogs around. <br>  Otherwise, paper train her (not my favorite way to go) until she is about 12 weeks old and has had at least two vaccinations. <br>  <br>  Keep people away who have been to dog parks or to shelters. They could have parasite eggs or viruses on their shoes or clothes.<br>  <br>  Do not feed rawhide treats under any circumstances.<br>  <br>  Treat her like a dog, not a baby. Yorkies are smart.|`|RIOX3ZPBaa	it is good to take her into the backyard asap. so she knows where her toilet will be in the future.<br>  But you cannot have her meeting other pups or dogs until she has had all her vaccinations.<br>  get ready for short nights and getting up 3-4 times at night to bring her out for a pee or poo. I would do this as soon as she arrives. after a while she knows that it's time to pee now and will get used to it.<br>  make sure to play and cuddle a lot with her so she feels comfortable.<br>  Don't yell at her when she has done a pee inside and you see it a bit later.<br>  =When you see that she is just about to do it, or does it: pick her up while saying NO in a firm voice and bring her outside to her designated toilet area. if she does it there you need need need to praise her, so she knows that she d done the right thing.<br>  Bathing I would do after about 10-12 weeks<br>  The best to teach a dog tricks like ( sit, come, stay, high five etc) is when they are still very young.<br>  my dogs started learning it from week 11. you can give her little liver treats for the training. train 10-15 minutes a day. and make it fun for her !!!<br>  Good luck ! it's all worth their love !|`|VpeQ6xDnaa	I have a 3 month old yorkie that i've had for about a month now. It was hard the first 2 weeks as far as potty training goes. CRATE train the dog. It's worked wonders for me. Yorkie's are very territorial. Keep the dog on a feeding schedule, so you can have apotty schedule. Introduce her to children so she's not agressive towards them. Give tons and tons of attention. Becareful with any flights of stairs. Tons and tons of exercise. They're precious puppies so good luck and congrats with the puppy.
m16gf9mzaa	Here are some hints that may help.  Never play with a cat or kitten with your bare hands. They will wrestle and mock-fight with their siblings, their mother, or any cat that becomes a buddy to them, it is part of how they gain strength and learn to protect themselves when they are out in the wild. The other cats have nice thick fur that offers protection from those sharp little claws and teeth - the kitten does not realize that its human friends do not have the same protection. There are plenty of interactive toys that you can use to play with the kitten - including some really wacky looking glove thingies that have extended fingers. I have also used an animal-shaped oven mitt to wrassle with my cats, plus there is always the perennial favorite game "mouse under the bed covers" (um... the risk to this one is that having the kitten associate the bed with playtime might encourage him to wake you up in the middle of the night to play more often than he would already, but I do it with my cats because it is so darn cute).<br>  <br>  Sometimes a petting or brushing session suddenly turns into a biting session, or your kitten somehow gets his teeth into you in spite of your precautions while playing. When that happens, try to control your instincts to pull away immediately - that is what a prey animal would do, and it excites the feline more. Instead, you want to push in towards kitten's mouth or body - gently, mind you. So if he's got your finger in his teeth, you will calmly, gently push your finger further into his mouth. The same principle applies to getting out of the kitten's grasp when the claws have sunk into your skin - push in towards kitty's body rather than pulling away.   The goal here is not to punish by sticking your finger down his throat or to hurt in any way, but to surprise the kitten with an action that will cause him to release you. Also, if you can, try to imitate a feline growl - it is one of the ways his mother would have used to correct his behavior when it was not acceptable to her. If you cannot (I know I can't get it right) a firm, calm "No!" will do the trick. Then you back off for a time, and use the social pressure of ignoring the kitten for a while to give the kitten time to calm down and to realize how unacceptable his behavior was.<br>  <br>  It seems like maybe your responses to the kitten's behaviors, even though they are not pleasant responses, may be rewarding his aggressive behavior.  In other words, you getting upset gives him attention, and that attention makes him want to keep doing the biting.  So the best thing you can do is to not show emotion over this - be very calm when it starts to happen, and ignore him after it.  <br>  <br>  But you will also have to make sure to satisfy his need for rough and tumble play, and for attention, in the safer ways mentioned above - using toys.  You may have to play with him with those toys a lot in order to satisfy that need.  Also, it might help to give treats whenever he is playing with the toys, to reinforce and reward that desirable kind of play.|`|VMY7No0eaa	Hold his muzzle closed and tell him NO FIRMLY<br>  you will have to be the alfa cat... make a loud screeching noise when he bites... this is what another cat in the litter/ mom would do.<br>  I will e-mail you...your going to bring the wrath of people out by something you said.|`|XPB6Ogj0aa	This is the cat's basic nature, he is a hunter.  When he starts to attack you, freeze.  Do not move your hand or arm.  This is like the prey being dead.  In a loud hurt voice say Ouch or something.  When he looks at you, look hurt and then take your hand away and ignore him.  Withhold any affection or contact for a while.  He loves you and after a few times of the cold shoulder he will learn that this attacking will get him attention that he doesn't like and usually they stop.|`|5kjYFb9Taa	Do Not Slap cats!

Cats are one of the most amazing and wonderful pets to own but they can wreak havoc if you let them. You need to learn some techniques to keep the cats from their bad behavior. <br>  Male cats tend to be the most trouble some of the species because they are the ones that are prone to spray. Spraying is one of the most terrible of all cat behaviors. This is a process of literally peeing on anything and everything. They spew urine out behind them in order to mark what they feel is their territory. The best way to treat this behavior is before it starts. The younger that you get your cat neutered the less likely he is to spray as he gets older. People are getting their cats fixed as early as 12 weeks. <br>  If you are worried about getting your cat fixed this young talk to your vet and do some good research online. This is the age that the SPCA is getting this done on the cats that have take in. This is the best way to nip bad cat behavior in the bud, especially spraying. <br>  Of course the most common cat problem of all is scratching. If your cat is scratching the furniture and you, any you have tried just about everything else you should give nail caps a try. These are little tiny caps that go over the end of the nails. They glue on like Press on Nails and they do not hurt your cat in any way. They do not even interfere with the claws ability withdraw into the paw.

It is because they are young (mine is almost 6 months now) and they are bored. They usually grow out of it between 1 and 2 years old. Mine does this only when I am trying to sleep though, which is very frustrating since he wakes me up and I used to be scared to sleep if I'm not completely covered with a thick blanket, lol.<br>  <br>  One of the best solutions I have found is that when he does this, slowly grab him around the neck/shoulders with one hand (even if he is still latched on to your other arm) and hold his mouth shut GENTLY with the other (I usually do this with the hand he was trying to bite), but firmly enough so he can't get away, and say NO! very loudly, and shake him VERY SLIGHTLY. Hold it like that for maybe 15 - 20 seconds (he WILL squirm a little, make sure you hold him firmly, but not hard enough to hurt him) and then let him go. Push him away a little to encourage a sort of "time out." Now, whenever I see him flatten his ears and look like he is about to pounce, I say NO! just like when I hold him down, and he looks all disappointed and slinks away, without biting me.<br>  <br>  Also, a few other hints:<br>  - With spraying, you should try to get him on the nose or really close, because they don't seem to mind getting wet on their body (at least mine doesn't) It helps if in your spray bottle full of water, you add 2 - 3 drops of vinegar and mix well and then use that mixture to spray the cat, the smell of vinegar slightly annoys them (and doesn't harm them at all) and makes them associate their bad behavior with unpleasant smells, thereby discouraging it in the future.<br>  <br>  - Not many people know this, but cats need toys as well, just like dogs. Make sure you have some plushie toy that is at least as big as the cat itself and around its own thickness (it can be a little narrower though, try and match it to your arm that he likes so much) Whenever he does this, after disciplining him the first few times and having him respond to your NO!, everytime you see this behavior, try and get him to "attack" this toy. I read this helps and is supposed to encourage his instinctual hunting behavior on one particular toy and not your arm (my cat doesn't care much for his stuffed animal though so...not sure if this works)<br>  <br>  Hope this helps!|`|CadIYXdXaa	It looks like he sees himself as more dominant than you, and plays much too rough.<br>  <br>  I would continue with some of the things you were doing, the firm no and pulling your hand away, also stop playing etc with him for awhile afterwards (ignore him) he should start to get the idea that you won't tolerate that action. <br>  <br>  Also you may want to look online for tips on teaching your cat that you are more dominant.<br>  <br>  One thing that sometimes works is after he bites you to grab (nicely) him by the scruff of the neck where the mother would and lift him up a bit (not enough to put strain on him if he's a larger cat) and give him a good stare in the eyes and say NO firmly, then continue to stare him down until he starts to squirm, then let him go.<br>  -It's not mean and doesn't hurt him in any way, but it should teach him who the boss is.|`|lYgoEOJ7aa	You slapped your cat?  Do you want him to be afraid of your hands?  I understand that its aggravating but you should NEVER resort to physical violence with an animal or yell at it - even if it was just a slight slap.  <br>  <br>  When he wraps around your arm - he's playing.  Thats how ALL cats play.  You need to learn the difference.  <br>  <br>  What you should do is - if he bites you, ignore him!  walk away!  He'll eventually learn that he doesnt get attention when he bites. Thats it.<br>  <br>  Do you have a scratching post for him?|`|yENAjUVzaa	Well, try carrying a spray bottle of water with you around the house. When he bites you spray it in their face. I no it may sound mean and rude to you but it is just water and the cat realizes that he/she doesn't want to get wet anymore so it will stop biting.....it worked with my cat and he hasn't bitten me since he was 1 years old.......he is 7yrs old now. Also call your vet if it gets to seriouse. You may need to have him spend a little time there so he can settle down.....just call. <br>  <br>          Hope this helps......if it doesn't (which i doubt ), I'm srry.
Lrr1gSFcaa	She will die without help from a vet. If her eyes are sunk back, she's dehydrated. Get her to vet immediately.|`|UNFxjNHkaa	Well, what has your vet said?|`|P7rosHBNaa	Your cat may be allergic to the brand of cat food, or it could be a virus. Take your cat to the vet, because they can get a more specific answer to why your cat is ill.|`|hm8QR95Kaa	Im so sorry hun but call your vet or the animal hospitel this sounds serious. Be sure to incurage whater and food. But at least call them and see what they say.Sounds bad|`|bl8co4hUaa	Vet. Now. If she's so lethargic and doing that poorly, she needs *immediate* and urgent assistance.<br>  <br>  It sounds like some type of poison.|`|rU7ZjIHKaa	I'm sorry about your cat. We don't know whats wrong either. Please take her to the vet.|`|db2025b820a04c944fcf1ff93dc0966aaa	can you see anything in her mouth? is she dribling? my cat came into contact with rat poison i first noticed that he was very drousy and foaming at the mouth and was off his food, when i looked in his mouth his tongue was bright red and looked very sore! it took a while for him to get better but after a week or so on a special diet he was fine! Has your cat been vaccinated? could be cat flu either way call your local vet even if its just for advice they should tell you what to look for! Hope she is ok!|`|ikBEORfqaa	go get mommy or daddy and have them drive you and your cat to the vets immediately. these things can progress very quickly without intervention so hurry.
EJpiaCMQaa	Yes, it sounds like she is pregnant.  Her and the male are displaying breeding behavior by feeding each other.  You should expect an egg from her soon.  The other female guarding the nest box shouldn't be interfering with the couple's breeding.  I would suggest separating her from the other two birds so you don't have any problems.
LAXxaxAZaa	The other female will most likely help. If you take her away before the other female gives birth, that will only stress out the mother (which could cause her to eat her young).<br>  <br>  Wait 4-5 days to touch the babies IF the mother is extremely tame. If she's shy or nervous, wait a little over a week. Rub your hands in the shavings before you touch them to get their scent on you.<br>  <br>  Try to keep it as quiet as possible around the cage during the first couple of weeks. Loud noises, irritating noises, and vibrations can cause the mother to stress and eat her young.<br>  <br>  Make sure they have enough food and water. If she feels she doesn't, she might think she can't take care of them, and eat them.<br>  <br>  And then there are the causes that you can't help... birth defects, insufficient milk, etc.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  EDIT -- Mice WILL eat their young if you touch them too soon. It happened to me once with a mouse I had that wasn't tame at all.|`|FYISPUt4aa	I have been breeding mice for a few years to feed my 3 snakes. A female mouse can just eat her own babies at any time. It doesn't matter what you do to try to help prevent it, it still may happen. I have 2 females and a male in one cage and one had babies over a week ago. she ate all but 4, which now have some hair. the other just gave birth 2 days ago and they all got ate. I think it's just because there are already a few older babies in the cage. sometimes they all live when this happens. it depends on a lot of things. Hope this helps.<br>  <br>  the post above is wrong! Hamsters will kill their babies if you touch them. Mice do not care! they will be fine if you touch them. I've bred mice, hamsters, rats and gerbils over the last 10+ years.|`|U6IWoRSRaa	Basically stress, or bad mothering skills and not being able to take care of them yet, scared and such.I'm not sure, but i'm pretty sure. You have to look it up :P im so sorry i'm not that much of a help though lol :P but hmmm, that's what i'm guessing, because that's the case for most animals!|`|knFrwCxcaa	1. if you got your sent of them<br>  2. if theres no food<br>  <br>  but don't worry its natural they will probs survive mice aren't that bad at that sort of thing|`|WCvciOQCaa	I've never heard of mice doing that to their young, but I do know that rats will each other if there is no food.|`|9604dad549d1d9ec19f7dbd9698567fdaa	The mother will eat the babies if humans touch the babies when they are newborn.  Something to do with the human smell on the newborn.  I read it online when I was reading about my hamster and they r the same family.  Also, when the mother is stressed, meaning, she is hungry, or thirsty.  I think u should separate the other female mice, because its not her babies, u never now, and u said u dont want to take the chance.Good Luck.|`|TSc8OE4vaa	-Not enough food for the mother and all babies<br>  -An unhealthy baby<br>  -Mother feels threatened
61229a5edd65b7a3460d98d36aeb272aaa	I also have Guinea hens and free range chickens and goats. The Guineas stay outside all year and roost in the trees on my property. The free range chickens have their own coop but some have started roosting in the barn at night and it causes quite a problem. The chickens always roost as high as they can and wind up pooping on the goats. I feed COB (corn oats and barley mix) to the goats (supplement with hay in the winter). The chickens can eat the cob but they need a layer food to help with egg production. If you want them all together how would you stop the goats from eating the chicken's food?|`|u1HahCoqaa	Wait, so you want a feed for birds and mammals? Ha.<br>  <br>  You might be able to keep the birds together and feed them the same food, but the goats will need different. Although if you put the bird feed too high for the goats, but the birds can fly up, and feed the goats grain-like meal at certain times (Rather than having it free-choice) then the goats wouldnt let the birds get it, I would assume. The birds should leave hay alone.
8owlj2xHaa	For a reef tank you need RODI water, not just RO water. The fact that you did a water change and your nitrates went up tells me your water is of bad quality,,,,, it has nitrates in it. So your RO membrane or your sources is bad. <br>  Stop feeding so much . Most Salt water fish can be fed just two times a week, not 14.  You do not mention a protein skimmer. An absolute must for a reef tank. Yes there are other methods, but for a beginner it is the easiest.  Do not add chemicals to the tank to solve your symptom. The symptom being algae, the problem being bad water quality. Cut way down on your feedings, check your water source out or get a new one, get a good protein skimmer.<br>  <br>  My 7 year old hipp an yellow tangs have never eaten more than 3 times a week let alone twice a day. Same for my 6 year old potters angel.  keep guessing<br>  <br>  That is way to much food!  Cut your feedings down to twice a week until you get the nitrates under control  <br>  Do not add any chemicals that you are not testing  for. You can not add Calcium everyday blindly it lowers alkalinity .  which means lower PH levels.  You do not need to add strontium or Iodine. Strontium is only really needed by SPS corals and even they get enough from water changes. Same for Iodine. <br>  You are having an Ich issue due to poor water quality! <br>  What kind of protein skimmer??? ??? <br>  You need to do large water changes with good RODI water soon.  Corals cannot take nitrate levels over  20ppm.|`|h4wNRqf9aa	what kind of pellet and frozen food are you feeding? how big is the cube?<br>  <br>  <br>  what's all in the tank anyway?<br>  fish?<br>  amount of rock and sand?<br>  <br>  <br>  feeding times and ammounts vary by type of fish<br>  <br>  large damsels, eels, lions, etc could all be fed 1-2 times a week and be fine<br>  <br>  things like tangs, angels, anthias etc, need to be fed more than once a DAY<br>  <br>  <br>  tangs and angels are natural grazers who eat throughout the day.. it's like asking an apatasaurus to only eat for an hour a day<br>  <br>  yay for you, you're two fish get by on 3 a week out of the countless millions in existance.. i bet you have a butt load of rock loaded with all kinds of micro fauna too huh?<br>  <br>  not saying much when they eat when you're not feeding them<br>  <br>  i should only feed my mandarin in his 20 gallon FO tank 3 times a week too?<br>  <br>  just how snotty do you want to make this?

The fighting's only going to get worse until you get teach dog their own crate.|`|nmercOm7aa	Keep them in separate crates.|`|24CFl7sjaa	They should be crated separately!<br>  They should also be fed separately, trained separately and walked separately at least until they are used to being exercised.<br>  If not they will not be able to BE separated without causing psychological trauma.<br>  <br>  If they are same sex they will fight more as they mature until the dominant dog has established his position. The submissive dog will not be able to fulfil his potential unless you separate them now and treat them as individuals.
wLgGD63raa	As with most turtles musk turtle's lifespans are pretty long. There have been records of specimens living for 50+ years in captivity. As long as you care for him properly I'm sure he will live a long and happy life.|`|mOayTJDmaa	50 years.|`|JnyPoQLIaa	Like most turtles they can live for a very long time, I remember hearing that musk turtles in particular can live anywhere from 20 to 40 years in the wild.  In captivity it is not unheard of for musk turtles to reach an age of 50 years or more.  I know that turtles can live for many many years because a red eared slider that i had owned passed away from natural causes at the age of 57 or 58.  the old guy was much older than i was and he had quite the personality.  but enough about me, so good luck and best wishes for you and your turtle.<br>  P.S.<br>  If he is just a baby turtle then he will need more attention as far as turtles go.  but one thing about these turtles is that they do not get very big, a maximum length of 13cm.  they will also form bonds with their owners over the course of many years|`|2YIxnXXyaa	If it's properly cared for ten it could live on average for about 30-50+ years old.|`|09fdLaeIaa	at least for 80
nmercOm7aa	If you keep it clean and is doesn't get chewed, it can last a while. I use white vinegar and water to clean it. If it does get chewed, you can replace some of it (like the edges) as needed. I have has to put poster holders on the edge to prevent chewing.|`|SinN2bsAaa	As long as you don't have guinea pigs who chew like crazy, they can last for a long time.<br>  <br>  I have had a few chewy pigs in the past, and mine has still lasted for almost 5 years now. They mainly just chew the top edge.<br>  <br>  We had a cage that we used for almost 8 years. It help up the whole time.

2z69twcpaa	i have a had a look around and can not find anything on feeding them, now olives are a fruit but they have no protein in them, chances are that a tortoise found in the Mediterranean in the wild probably would come across them and possibly eat them, but as i said i can't find anything on feeding them to a tortoise if they came in a jar then check the nutritional advice label to see if they are high in protein, if the protein content is high i would say don't risk it, but not coming across this sort of question i think it will be down to personal choice if you want to feed them or not, personally i always go on if in doubt i don't feed it to my tortoises but as i said it will be personal choice on this one, sorry it is not much help, best of luck anyway|`|FvAl3UgQaa	I really wouldn't advise it, as the production and preserving process will have involved the olives being "cured" in some fashion (often brine) and that will introduce salt into the olives, which would not be good for your tortoise. <br>  <br>  Another possible curing chemical used is Lye, which sounds even worse! <br>  <br>  If it were to encounter olives in the wild (which I doubt, as I think of olives as Mediterranean, although I guess they could grow in Africa?) then they would be "pure" and not full of extra chemicals. <br>  <br>  If yours state that they're uncured (possible, but unlikely) then maybe a few, but not in any significant quantity.
kvHqnR5Haa	There should be a chart on the bag that tells you how much to feed based on the age and weight of your dog.|`|AA12128656	whoa! a 8 month old dog does NOT need to eat 3x!!! twice is fine...<br>  <br>  go by what it says on the bag, and adjust from there depending on his activity levels and metabolism.|`|280d96ad7b5e9ffad03a34a66cac5db0aa	Nutro is far from an adequate choice. Nutro Natural Choice foods contain synthetic vitamin K, don't they? Here, browse this topic to find some insight on this chemical:<br>  <a href="http://mastiffonlinecommunity.net/viewtopic.php?t=9576" rel="nofollow">http://mastiffonlinecommunity.net/viewto...</a><br>  They also contain ridiculous grain fragment fillers like rice bran. These are the bits of grain leftover after all the most nutritional parts have been used.<br>  <br>  Deep-chested breeds like German Shepherds are prone to something called gastric dilatation-volvulus, or bloat. Please be aware of how to take certain precautions against bloat. (And, the mere fact that your dog isn't a full GS means nothing. He's still susceptible.) Arm yourself with info with this article:<br>  <a href="http://www.globalspan.net/bloat.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.globalspan.net/bloat.htm</a><br>  <br>  Three times a day is perfect, and four hours apart is okay. I don't know how much you should be feeding him. Considering Nutro's poor quality, the kibble is probably air-puffed, so he'll need to eat more of it to get the same amount of nutrients and to fill his stomach as he would with a more dense, high-quality food. There are always feeding recommendations on the bag of food, so check for that. It should say how much to feed him based on his age and weight. You can simply pay close attention to his body; he should have a clearly tucked waistline, and you should be able to easily feel the ribs. (They should be padded, kind of like feeling someone's knuckles through a thin glove.) If he starts to pack on weight, just feed him less, simple as that.|`|AA12322387	You need to feed whatever the bag/can of food recommends for your dog.  As far as the number of times, that's up to you.  I feed my terrier once a day-in the evening.  I've found that if he eats in the morning, he isn't hungry at night.  I make sure that he gets the correct portion in that one meal.|`|J3gslQMCaa	You are feeding him plenty! Keep up the good work
z2bVBZ7Zaa	my cat also was very small when she had her litter, the day that she gave birth she was searching the whole day finding a place to give birth in, she wanted a dark secluded area, whenever we tried to look at her she would just feel self conscious and not want to go into labor, so we thought that if we gave her some space then she would be ok, and turns out that she was! but you should keep a phone at ready and some handy dandy....... gloves! we sort kinda peeked every once and a while too. just make her feel comfortable and if anything is going wrong, then make sure to call the vet and let her talk you into how your going to help her.|`|msCr4kHHaa	well i had a cat and she had kittens for the first time and we watched her to see if she had any problems and if she did we would put on a pair of doctor gloves and help with pulling the baby's out what you might want to do if you see her pant a lot and get more anxious in looking for a places to give birth then you will now thats she ready to give birth watch her and keep a clean pair of gloves on handy.
Xv33QsESaa	Very interesting observation!  I was raised on a horse farm, but the question never came to mind.  Through my experience, I would say the benefits do not justify the risk and expense involved.  Here are a few justifications...<br>  <br>  For the most part, horses are not free roaming "pets" and as such there social mixing is most often controlled effectively through segregation.  <br>  <br>  Smaller domesticated animals are often "fixed" to avoid unwanted pregnancies.  Most horses, cattle, sheep and other larger animals are kept on properties with facilities dedicated to their purpose.  Animals are often segregated by sex rather than sterilized.  It's more economical, it's reversible and overall just a more simple solution.<br>  <br>  You mentioned that stallions are often gelded (castrated).  This is true.  Gelding a stallion is much less invasive and as such the risk is much lower to the animal.  Gelding also lends to allow for tempermental and physiological attributes to which neither a mare or stallion offer.  When gelded before sexual maturity, male horses tend to exibit less aggressive "male" behavior without the cylical tempermental nature of a mare as whe progresses through estrus.|`|rCeD6nffaa	there is no reason.. It is just wasting money if you ask me. Maybe a female dog can get pregnant by roaming the neighbor hood for a boyfriend or just the dog next door. But i'm sure you've never hear'd of  a mare roaming around the neighbor hood. So ya thats pretty much why. And the if theres a stud around you had better keep them apart.<br>  lol..... - that was actually not a stupid question at all! No matter what some of these knuckle heads say!!|`|XXPgh3FTaa	its called a sterile mare... but it might cost more... not sure...|`|u1HahCoqaa	Because it is a much more expensive and dangerous procedure to put a horse under and cut it open than it is to do the same to a dog or cat. Even if they survive surgery, I have heard of several that have broken a leg or something trying to get up upon regaining conscience ( although that goes for every equine surgery) And, seeing that most stallions are gelded, and the ones that are not are, usually, kept in strict control, for obvious reasons (The stallion could be severely injured breeding a mare, the mares owner could sue, the mare could be injured..) . But most are gelded. There are not wild stallions roaming the neighborhood like cats and dogs.  So why should horse owners risk death of their mare in an expensive surgery that isn't even necessary?|`|jyGTlpzTaa	Because the vast majority of male horses are gelded, there really is no need to fix females...its not like dogs and cats, where there are entire males all over the place, stallions tend to be very spirited and difficult to control, so responsible breeders will only leave a horse a stallion if he is a fantastic example of a breed or type or has a special ability. Spaying female horses would be a huge expense and its not necessary.
0m6BgESXaa	Your puppy keeps doing this because you've conditioned him to :-p  You even said it yourself...he screams until you let him out.  So you've taught him that if he screams long enough, you'll let him out of his kennel.<br>  <br>  When you walk in the house you really just need to let him scream.  Stand in front of the kennel and just wait for him to settle down and be quiet.  He'll be so confused by you not immediately meeting his demands, he'll shut up, even if for a split second.<br>  <br>  The moment he is quiet, bend down to let him out.  If he returns to screaming and carrying on, stand back up until he's quiet again.  Continue to do this until he is completely silent.<br>  <br>  Do not let the dog out of his kennel when he's making a ruckus.  He needs to learn that only quiet calm greeting will get him let out.<br>  <br>  You also need to start making his kennel a positive place to be.<br>  <br>  Stuffing a kong full of kibble and peanut butter and freezing it the night before can help.  Buy two or three of them, stuff one with kibble and peanut butter, another with kibble and cheese, and a third one with kibble and some liver paste.  Freeze all of them, and each day give him ONE to work on throughout the day.  When you come home and you see he's finished it clean it out and start over.<br>  <br>  He is perfectly capable of entertaining himself, he just doesn't want to.<br>  <br>  This may take a few days, a few weeks, or a few months, but you need to be consistent.|`|BjBETNdvaa	here this always works get a newspaper and shake it|`|cIqpL3tGaa	Smack him gently in the head and scream, KNOCK IT OFF|`|RehgySLCaa	You could have tried buying him plenty of chew toys to keep him from chewing your furniture.

wLgGD63raa	Not to sound rude, but this is something you should have looked into before deciding to get one.<br>  <br>  Your red eared slider will need a heat lamp in order to bask. The basking temperature should be between 85-90. Water temperature should be 78° - 80° F for hatchling red ear sliders while adults prefer it at 72° - 76°.<br>  <br>  You will also need UV lighting providing UVA and UVB for proper calcium metabolism and skeletal development of the red ear slider. This may be achieved by using a mercury vapor bulb or a fluorescent bulb with at least 5% - 10% output of UVB. <br>  <br>  Water temperature may be heated with a submersible water heater at 3 - 5 watts per gallon.<br>  <br>  In other words, yes it will need a heat lamp and much more. Here are a couple care sheets on RES.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.austinsturtlepage.com/Care/caresheet-red_ear_slider.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.austinsturtlepage.com/Care/ca...</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.tortoisetrust.org/articles/res.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.tortoisetrust.org/articles/re...</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://exoticpets.about.com/cs/reptilesturtles/a/reslidercare.htm" rel="nofollow">http://exoticpets.about.com/cs/reptilest...</a><br>  <br>  RES take a lot of money and time for proper care. I would suggest you read up on the animal before you decide to get it to make sure you can give it proper husbandry.|`|hQQuqyYcaa	They really need a place to get up out of the water and bask under a heat lamp. It's best that you don't leave out the heat lamp in the set up.|`|EDOxXdcoaa	Reptiles are coldblooded animals and they have to seek out areas to bask  in order to raise and maintain their core body temperature. If they can't do that, their metabolism drops. A lowered metabolism means decreased appetite, general lethargy and decreased resistance to infection/disease. <br>  <br>  In addition to a heat lamp, turtles also need full spectrum UVB lighting. Without it, they will succumb to metabolic bone disease.|`|11RFLpViaa	yes, they can live without it, but they need it to be healthy. They need a place in thier tank to bask. When I first got mine, he came with all the equipment already. I didn't know about the heat lamp. He just had a regular bulb in one of those lamps that clips onto side of tank. Had him for a couple of months before I actually got him the right kind of bulb. If he gets natural sunlight, that can replace the heat lamp. Maybe put tank in front of a window with good light.|`|IfXJk1qoaa	You do need a source of heat, but you don't need to buy an expensive heat bulb; I've been using a normal incandescent bulb for years.<br>   <br>  In addition to a heat source, your turtle will need a source of UVB.  I recommend getting a Repti-Glo 5.0 Compact bulb ($20).

If you want to help them get some probiotics like acidoupholous and sprinkle a little in the food each day. Also, no reason nor should you feed dry foods<br>   <br>   <br>  Nutrition since there are so many bad things out there is very important to your cat’s health<br>  Contrary to what you may have heard; dry foods are not a great thing to feed a cat. <br>  Please read the label on what you are feeding? What are the ingredients? Do you know what they mean? Is the first ingrediant a muscle meat like chicken or meal or other things?<br>  <a href="http://www.catinfo.org/#Learn_How_To_Read_a_Pet_Food_Ingredient_Label" rel="nofollow">http://www.catinfo.org/#Learn_How_To_Rea...</a><br>  <a href="http://iml.jou.ufl.edu/projects/Spring04/Perhach/PetFood/InterpretingLabels.htm" rel="nofollow">http://iml.jou.ufl.edu/projects/Spring04...</a><br>  Dry foods are the number 1 cause of diabetes in cats as well as being a huge contributing factor to kidney disease, obesity, crystals, u.t.i’s and a host of other problems. Food allergies are very common when feeding dry foods. Rashes, scabs behind the tail and on the chin are all symptoms<br>  The problems associated with Dry food is that they are loaded with grains and carbohydrates which many cats (carnivores) cannot process.  Also, Most of the moisture a cat needs is suppose to be in the food but in<br>  Dry, 95% of it is zapped out of dry foods in the processing. Another thing, most use horrible ingredients and don't use a muscle meat as the primary ingredient and use vegetable based protein versus animal. Not good for an animal that has to eat meat to survive.<br>  <a href="http://www.catinfo.org/#My_Cat_is_Doing_Just_Fine_on_Dry_Food" rel="nofollow">http://www.catinfo.org/#My_Cat_is_Doing_...</a><br>  You want to pick a canned food w/o gravy (gravy=carbs) that uses a muscle meat as the first ingredient and doesn't have corn at least in the first 3 ingredients if at all.   <br>   THE  BEST CAT FOODS CONTAIN NO GRAINS NO BYPOODUCTS NO MEAL<br>  Cats are meat eaters not cereal or rice eaters<br>   Fancy feast is a middle grade food with 9lives, friskies  whiskas lower grade canned and wellness and merrick upper grade human quality foods. I would rather feed a middle grade canned food then the top of the line dry food.<br>   Also, dry food is not proven to be better for teeth.

In vet school, the only classes offered on nutrition usually last a few weeks, and are taught by representatives from the pet food companies. Vet students may also receive free food for their own dogs and cats at home.

At least then you know that it's mostly water. Still, I strongly recommend that you stick to water.<br>  <br>  Please note, no matter what these morons say, DO NOT give your kitty milk, unless it's cat milk that you got from a pet store. Cow's milk can seriously harm a cat.|`|flKkoiwbaa	It's not a good idea.  Many sports drinks contain stuff that isn't good for cats:<br>  <br>  sugar - can cause diarrhea in kitties<br>  <br>  artificial sweeteners - can be toxic to animals <br>  <br>  electrolytes (potassium, sodium, etc)  - the small amounts present are just fine for an adult who weighs 150 lbs or so, but in an 8 lb cat, it could be enough to throw their natural electrolyte balance out of whack.  This could cause vomiting, seizures or even death in cases where large amounts are ingested.<br>  <br>  In general, it's better to not give your kitties ANY "people food".  Sure, they might enjoy an occasional taste of your salmon or chicken, but in general, cat food is the best option.|`|Qq9dRq6Oaa	The answer to your question would be a definate NO, the best thing to give cats to drink is water.

Chocolate has theobromine in the cocoa - this is what causes the trouble, it affects the heart. However they have to have eaten the toxic dose to be affected by it.<br>  <br>  I advise you to ring your vet to tell them how big your dog is and exactly how much of what type of chocolate he's eaten. Here is a useful chart that can help you work out if he's had the toxic dose - but it cannot replace a vets advice. The only treatment for toxic overdose of chocolate is to make the dog vomit it back up within half an hour of eating it, so it can't get into the system. If it's too late for that and he HAS had the toxic dose, they can only monitor the heart and treat as necessary.<br>  <a href="http://ngm.nationalgeographic.com/2007/10/pets/chocolate-chart-interactive.html" rel="nofollow">http://ngm.nationalgeographic.com/2007/1...</a><br>  <br>  Chalice|`|PizXrl2oaa	it should be okay.. it may throw up or have diarrhea.

Keep all food like that up and away from the dog at all times so this doesn't happen again.  <br>  <br>  a tip we learned from my vet give your dog a tablespoon of hydrogen peroxide to make it throw up if it eats something poisonous.

8cikAYp3aa	simple fix..  If you absolutely hate the writing there is practically nothing that removes sharpie..It truely is permanent. Soooooooo get out your sicsors and cut off the last few inches where the lettering is.  A few inches shorter wont make a bit of difference in the way the wraps fit Its easy enough to reset a bit of velcro if need be, if you dont sew you can always have it done at a dry cleaner|`|5i8lDbXfaa	I wouldn't be too concerned about the writing, I know things like that kinda bug me too.  One person suggested marking over them, that's a good idea. Maybe find a horse stencil and color it in over the writing.  Sharpie is really hard to get out.  Nail Polish remover should work, hair spray sometimes works too.  Give that a try and then wash and rinse them really well before using them on your horse.|`|xzJi0bcSaa	Why would you want to alter them? It sounds like you got a decent set other than the writing and if you cant see it when its on the horse, does it matter? If you are really unhappy, ask about the return policy, otherwise, Id just deal with it. I personally dont mind used tack as long as its in good shape, most of my tack is used because the new stuff is so expensive! You could always alter the writing or dye the wraps if you are that concerned. (I dont really care if I get thumbs down for this).|`|WhKj0yCYaa	maybe you could just put a piece of masking tape or duck tape over it and write your name on it. Other wise you could try rubbing alcohal just put it on a sponge or something and scrub, or theirs this magical thing called goo gone you can get at like any store it is a miracle, I use it on a lot of things that has stuff on it. It would probably work! Hope I helped let me know if my things worked!|`|xSOAwIXsaa	Try nail polish remover.... it works on most things|`|nY2hZrUMaa	u cnt get the sharpie off but mabye u can modify it? u no to yr initals or your horses?<br>  r somethin like that:]
EJpiaCMQaa	First, wash everything with soap and water.  Rinse everything well.<br>  Then clean with bleach (1 part bleach, 4 parts water is recommended by vets).  Rinse well.<br>  Let everything dry completely.<br>  Throw out the non-washable items, like cuttlebones or mineral blocks.<br>  <br>  I'm sorry to hear about your bird.  Ashes was so cute.  I hope you get the budgie you want and that he is healthy and happy.|`|RvddYKqjaa	Just disinfect all of it. It can all be used again and again. Soak the wooden things in a bleach solution, and let it all dry well in the sun. Make sure the bleach smell is gone before you put another bird in. There is no guarantee, even with a new cage, that a bird won't die. They are rather delicate with temperature changes. The longest we ever had the same bird was 13 years.|`|saXxWTkZaa	Go to the pet shop or vets and ask them for a good cage disinfectant that's safe for birds. They will know what products are the safest. Also ask your vet for a list of recommended foods or go on a budgie fanciers web site and ask advice there. I'd get rid of everything but the cage to be on the safe side although its quite possible that your old budgie died from something non transmittable.|`|p2pE0Fpwaa	I would recommend a new cage due to the illness of your other bird. There are so many hiding places for germs, why take a chance.|`|WCNsmyZBaa	ASHES WAS GORGEOUS!<br>  <br>  R.I.P ;[<br>  <br>  I used the same cage that my old hammy died in with my new hammy so maybe itll be okay ..<br>  <br>  Good luch with Kellog ;3<br>  <br>  Cute names xD
TSc8OE4vaa	No, it is perfectly acceptable to state that they must replace anything they break and pay for any vet bills which are their fault.  In fact it is better to put that in the contract, it is normal and won't scare anyone away.|`|hD25pT1Laa	I agree with pointmissed's post, but I would add that you NEED some liability insurance. If your horse injures someone you are legally responsible.|`|nuc5DBD8aa	No, it's fair to say if they break anything, it's gotta be replaced.|`|BREi7qw7aa	sounds fair to me!|`|FtEkredUaa	No!! Make sure you put that down, they are there to take care of your horse for the 1 or 2 days a week so they should also respect your tack. If anyone loans there horse or pony out on my yard they always make sure that they state if any of the rugs or tack gets stolen or broken whilst they are responsible for the tack at the time they must replace or fix them. Don't worry about frightening anyone away because in the end of the day its your pony and you want whats best for your horse! Anyone should respect you and your horse and if they dont like the contract then they obv wouldnt be the right person to loan your horse. You need a trustworthy person. No1 will mind about replacing your tack as it will be under your loan agreement. :)|`|rbLdJ6Iiaa	you should definitely say that. and i'm looking for a horse TO lease, so here's what i am looking for:<br>  <br>  -you will pay for the feed, board, and regular vet bills.<br>  -if a small injury happens to the horse, I will pay for it, but if a hugely serious medical problem comes along, YOU will pay for it (the reason i'm leasing is because i can't affort that kind of unexpected stuff!)<br>  -if you are willing to allow the horse to go to the person's preferred barn (you are welcome to inspect/approve it) but if you don't want to do that then that's probably okay.<br>  <br>  these are just the things I would prefer out of a leaser. so good luck! and no i don't think your request is unreasonable.|`|hyRj4eIjaa	no thats fair|`|3O6CTb3saa	Hi just some ideas have you thot about who u will lease your horse to?  Are they trustworthy people and love horses so your horse will not be abused whatsoever.  I would make a contract that states if there is anything that happens to the horse or your saddle that they have to cover the cost of either one or both or replace.  I do not feel that is way off.  These things are yours and they cost you money to get and you love your horse so just be careful and have a contract.  People who don't have some type of contract with things like that usually end up getting the bad end of things.  Good Luck!|`|AA11758371	I leased many horses and always had my own tack - bridle, saddle , pads etc.  I didn't like having to reset the stirrup lengths every time I rode.  So, it may not be as hard as you think.  But, I understand your concern about the fit. I always had the owner "fit" my bridle to their horse so they felt comfortable about how my tack fit their horse.  If they are going to lease your pony and have no tack, then they need to lease your tack too.  The amount of $$ you get will defray any repair costs, and by having to lease it they will take better care of it. <br>  <br>  Are your saddles insured?  You may want to consider putting them on your homeowners - especially if someone else will be using them, and potentially not putting them in a safe place.
3FOmoaUZaa	No... they have beak type mouths- like a chicken, but not a beak|`|7MuFMepgaa	Nope!

That beak has a sharp ridge and can cause damage to anything it bites.|`|2YIxnXXyaa	They don't have teeth on their jaws like most animals do<br>  But inside they have sharp teethlike things that grind their food down<br>  It's kind of like a chicken's gizzard, except a little different..you know?<br>  But their sharp jaws have little ridges on them to help rip their food apart, like fish and worms etc.|`|XDE8F7Bdaa	yes they have, but you can't see it.  there teeth is inside their mouth when the food pass in their mouth deeply, they are start to chew the foods.
IhXQquAhaa	Retrievers are very smart dogs...Very smart so they learn very quickly.  Give this dog lots and lots of love while you are training and do not at any time hit or yell for bad doggie behavior, he/she will not understand what it is they did wrong because going potty to them is natural and they go anywhere they want instinctively, you have to show them where you want them to go and just be patient because it can take a while.  It took my Chihuahua 2 weeks before she knew what to do.  I suggest giving her treats for going in her designated spot and putting her in her crate only letting her out to potty.  It seems mean, but if it is big enough and she can have her food and water with her, the dog should be just fine but no longer than 4 days.|`|Q2OP7SOtaa	Depends on her age.. <br>  <br>  If she is under say 3 years could take you a couple of weeks but when she returns home she could revert to type and start having accidents again. try training her in her own house that may be less stressful for her also.<br>  <br>  If she is older than 5/6 you may struggle to completely potty train and would have to keep her outside if you were out for a while.|`|3V1qNw6Eaa	it won't take long mines used to going outside though but they get bigger so if you train her for inside the house it'll still be a mess because it'll get all over i recommend teaching it to go outside and the obedience training will be easy they listen very well<br>  good luck ;)|`|4i1syGARaa	I'm not sure but If you just get on to them about it all the time it shouldn't take that long I dont think|`|MMQ7SdvDaa	A year old should be potty trained. I've had several young puppies, beginning at 12 weeks. and generally relatively early a dog will figure out bathroom means going outside. Every dog I've had made the correlation pretty quick. <br>  <br>  While crate training, make sure you open the crate and take them out right away.. No checking email or anything until the dog is outside doing its duty.|`|a88b0f44a1d7abe4bce01e6a248dbc64aa	it depends, i would recommend you train the dog at his/her own house.

l7ydlrl6aa	depends on how big the tank is ... i was thinking about doing this with my 55 gallon tank but its a lotta money and a lotta work... if i remember correctly it was something like $500 bucks just for the live rock... another few hundred for a different type of filter and then another hundred or so in chemicals... definitely very expensive compared to fresh water... i think the cheapest way to go is to sell your tank and get a bio cube... but im no expert... hope this helps|`|bZWk8uBuaa	be prepared saltwater tanks are a lot of work|`|iSp1ur26aa	Saltwater tanks are much more expensive as they require strict up keep. The fish generally are prettier but they are also generally more delicate. If you have the time and to maintain the tank you will probably enjoy a saltwater tank, however if you do not plan on spending time and money on your fish I would recommend sticking to freshwater.

They don't get very big though. I like Malinois's too, they look kind of like a german shepherd. They are being integrated into police K9 units because they're less likely to bite than a german shepherd.|`|RMzrxOMTaa	I agree with peter, i have rhodesian ridgebacks are excellent and would love that sort of place

I had a budgie for nearly 5 years and he got sick and died in October. At first, it hadn't really sank in, I cried a little, but a few days later I realized what I had lost and couldn't stop crying. I still get a little lump in my throat when I see his picture from time to time. Some people might think it's pathetic to cry over a bird, or a rabbit, or any animal, but I don't care. He was my pet and part of my family. It was hard to see him go.
xjL6yODyaa	He really got a Portuguese water dog? That is so funny because my aunt has two of them and she is the biggest pro-Obama advocate, and when she heard he was looking for a dog w/o dander, she went all crazy saying he needed a Portuguese water dog.<br>  I think they are fun dogs. Pretty hyper and they always put stuff in their mouths (my aunts dogs always chew on rocks...), but other than that I love them. =]<br>  And not to mention they are really cute.|`|kvHqnR5Haa	I don't personally know them so it is hard for me to say if it is the right dog for them.  But I can say that I am so ecstatic that they decided to adopt!  Look at the great FREE advertising that went out all over this country about how good it is to adopt!  It will be great for the shelters and rescues! Good for them!|`|4c109a39857af35260b52915ff70d5e9aa	i don't know where he thinks he's going to find a portugese water dog at any kind of rescue, i mean, that breed hasn't been in this country for very long and the only people i know that have them have gotten them specifically from a breeder.|`|c90696a851f3ee0c6b1f63f7f595eca4aa	I don't care what breed he gets, but I would have been disappointed for him to get a designer breed. I love that he's getting a rescue dog, too.|`|bO2rzfISaa	I agree about the rescue. My last three dogs have been rescued.|`|kWwgWSSgaa	The right dog is the one that matches what the breed needs from a home & what the family want from a breed. If the Portuguese Water Dog ticks all the boxes, then yes it's fine.<br>  <br>  If as suggested they adopt a dog, then it's good that there's one less dog in a rescue.|`|FVD1tpLeaa	I think it's a great idea.  PWDs are found in shelters and rescues, as are all kinds of Purebred dogs.  People don't bother checking shelters because they just assume that all the dogs are unsuitable mutts, and thats not the case.  Many kinds of dogs are given up for all kinds of reasons.  It's good to see them go through a rescue, because it's sets a good example, and there won't be some sort of race for people to breed crazy numbers of dogs to try to be the breeder that they buy through.|`|6SeWCfUfaa	I'm sorta upset about that.  I don't want to to see the PWD's suffer from popularity because of his choice.  They're great dogs, and thus far they've stayed pretty much in the hands of responsible breeders, but ... this could change that because people are stupid.|`|AA10029366	I don't think it's up to me to decide what dog best suits a family I don't even know.<br>  <br>  But, good for them.

GVaf1pejaa	She's almost certainly in heat.  Eek! if she's an outdoor cat you better get her spayed quick or else you're going to have some kittens on your hands!|`|x6XlNYH7aa	This is normal behaviour for a cat her age. She is wanting to mate. You need to take her to be spayed asap.|`|NVBMC34naa	She is just starting to get in heat...either get her a mate or spay her, cause she will get much worse...<br>  <br>  edit: "in heat" means she will want to go out and seek a tomcat to mate.  <br>  <br>  When I say get worse, it is because if she were an indoor cat, she would become very annoying and distressed if not allowed out. <br>  <br>  But as an outdoor cat she will probably just go out and mate when the time is right, she should not get very anoying.<br>  <br>  if you'd like to have kittens, just do nothing. but you will need absolutely to spay her sooner or later, for she will get a litter of kittens every 4 months or so.
xszQM7DNaa	To me it sounds like she's pregnant<br>  1. take her to the vet for a check up.<br>  2.don't let her go outside so much.<br>  3.maybe 2 kittens is enough|`|h8Mqno3daa	if she is pregnant, then give her space cos when a cat is pregnant she would be overly protective of her offsprings . so just stand back|`|F2JEvYX7aa	You should take her to the vet to get her checked out.|`|w1lh1INHaa	How many kittens should you keep?  As the average cost per year for a cat including food, litter, and vet bills is $1,000 per cat, keep the number for every spare $1,000 you have.<br>  <br>  As for adopting out the other kittens, good luck.  Most no-kill shelters are refusing animals because they are overcrowded.  A regular shelter will most likely put them down.  Fewer people are adopting kittens because they can't afford them.  Even if you adopt them out, you are going to have to make sure they have all their shots, are dewormed, the whole nine yards, and that will run you at least $150 per kitten.<br>  <br>  Do the responsible thing.  Get your cat spayed, right now!  A cat that young is not equipped to successfully deliver a litter of kittens.  In the past month I have seen so many questions, "My cat died giving birth" and "My cat is refusing to take care of her kittens."  <br>  <br>  Get her spayed.  It will be less expensive and traumatic in the long run.|`|AA11611859	Well, evidently you were too irresponsible to get her spayed and then  let her wander free outdoors in the first place I find it hard to believe you would be responsible enough to properly take care of kittens.  They cost a lot of money, and if you don't get them spayed/neutered, they will only make more and more kittens, and that is seriously irresponsible.  If you didn't get your cat spayed because of the cost, then you certainly can't afford kittens.|`|inST4SlAaa	she is in heat and wants to go out and get some action lol  if you keep her in she wont get pregnant but her meowing will drive you nuts.  its your decision.  of course having her fixed would stop it but not everone can afford it especially in these times|`|z2bVBZ7Zaa	if her stomach is bulgy and her nipples are more pink and visible than usual, than chances are, she's pregnant, she might also act a little nicer than usual. But you should still get her checked out by a vet.|`|Mq6B3VSjaa	It sounds more like she's in heat.  Call the vet, make an appointment to get her spayed right now, whether she is pregnant or not.  And keep her inside until she is spayed.
GSf09ALBaa	Very possibly a big ball of juicy fruit in his stomach or intestinal track.  Time for xrays.|`|bRxWkpfBaa	Gum doesn't digest, it's possible that the gum has gotten stuck and is causing a blockage, you should have x-rays done at the vet.
4XUC1iKMaa	hi,<br>  that cage is perfect. one of my budgies is in that exact cage. if you have any further questions email me at lizzie10157@yahoo.com.|`|Po4Lljjwaa	Nope!  I had a budgie and my cage looked about the same size.  No cage is going to be big enough for it to fly around anyway, so as long as it has enough room for everything else (perches, food bowls, toys, etc...) you should be good to go.  Have fun and good luck!  I had mine for 11 years (and I think that's on the shorter side of their normal life span) so you'll probably have it around for quite a while.|`|qqgXDogYaa	its okay for one budgie. even then its a little cramped.  parakeets love playing and moving freely in their cage. This one will restrict it.  so I hope you can at least spend some time like 30min to an hour each day at home and let it out of the cage so it can really spread its wings and move around. I have one that size and trust me my bird gets bored. so I got another budgie and the cage got really cramped so I got a bigger cage.  go to Petco or Pets Smart or you rlocal pets store.|`|pH1Qz6lAaa	Hi, that is a very nice cage for a parakeet, or budgie. I have a Sun Conure in a 150 dollar 32x 21x 35 cage that is on a stand. It is a very nice cage for a budgie. If you want to buy that cage here is the link:<a href="http://www.mybirdcage.com/hq_flight_cage.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.mybirdcage.com/hq_flight_cage...</a><br>  <br>  The cage above can fit 2 budgies.|`|saXxWTkZaa	That size is fine as long as you are going to be letting it out regularly. I had budgies years ago and the cages were much smaller then but they were allowed free flight for about 3 hours a day.|`|wrxd8M84aa	Nope. Just right. <br>  <br>  Make sure to let him out often. =)|`|MloahqFVaa	That size cage should be perfectly fine for a budgie, keeping in mind that this is if you are going to let it out inside and spend time with it. My cockatiels (larger than a budgie) both live in cages of about that size, but I let them out every second day to stretch their wings and spend some time with the family. Make sure you have plenty of toys to keep your budgie amused, so he/she doesn't get too noisy (attention-seeking).|`|OP0WnHYZaa	looks ok but the bigger you get the better , more space to stretch its wings

tJoxT0EXaa	I bought a bunny two days ago at Feeder's Supply.  They had three different size cages.  I bought the largest for 60, but they had a small one for $34 bucks. So, yup, you can get one for 30 and some change.  If you're going to spend 30, an extra four bucks shouldn't matter.  Google Feeder's Supply. I think they're website is feederssupply.com, but I'm not sure. As long as you get a smaller breed of rabbit, that cage would work just fine.  But it IS an indoor cage, you couldn't get an outdoor cage for 30. Have fun with your new bunny.|`|jyGTlpzTaa	There's no way you will get a well constructed and large cage for $30, which is what a rabbit needs. You could try your local gumtree and craigslist, however you are asking a lot!|`|z2bVBZ7Zaa	you can NOT get a rabbit cage for $30 and I know why you want a rabbit, so you can eat it, right? I'm a muslim too. that's what my parents want to do, eat it. but tell me the truth, y would you want to eat a pet? and if your not going to eat it, good.|`|RjlBrP98aa	I'm afraid you can't get a rabbit cage the appropriate size for that low an amount. However, you can build an NIC condo for about that price and it doesn't take any construction skills considering I built one and don't know a thing about construction either! I know you said no ideas like that, but I wanted to mention it anyway because maybe you didn't know how easy it really is. :)<br>  <br>  It's very easy, you just snap the panels together and zip tie them and poof, instant rabbit cage. :) <br>  <br>  A box of the panels will cost about 15 - 20 $, the zip ties maybe 5$, and then a rug or scrap carpet to go on the bottom would be maybe 5 or 10$ and a clip or two for 1$. So you could possibly make one yourself for under 30$ depending on where you buy! Much better than spending 100$+ on a proper size rabbit cage from a store. <br>  <br>  Good luck! :)
9MtL3L6Caa	I know...but I just can't helping meowing back at my 3 whenever they meow at me, or at the door to be let out. I think it's a cat owner thing.|`|5WYOehFraa	Just chalk it up to crazy kids and their fads.
iVVen0Lgaa	I would avoid any puppy finder sites at all costs.  The best place to find a breeder like you describe (which is a great description, btw) is through the parent club for the breed.  The Boston Terrier Club of America was founded by the people who started the breed and has been in existence ever since.  Most of this club's members live, breathe, and die for Boston Terriers and the well being of the breed.  That doesn't mean that there are no bad ones there, but the vast majority are wonderful.  The club has a breeder referral service.  The breeder referral person will have a list of all BTCA members in your area and may know whether someone there has a litter.  Even if she doesn't know what litters are available, she can refer you to nearby breeders who will be glad to talk with you and help you find a puppy.<br>  <br>  Go to this website and look under "About Bostons".  The link for the breeder referral will be on the left side of the screen.  Best of luck in your search.  You are definitely starting it correctly.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://bostonterrierclubofamerica.org/" rel="nofollow">http://bostonterrierclubofamerica.org/</a>|`|tFKQYT6Naa	this is the website that i got my purebred pomeranian...the breeders on this website are great !!!!!<br>  these are all of the boston terrier breeders in PA<br>  <a href="http://www.puppyfind.com/for_sale/?breed_id=25&order_by=rand&back=%2Fbrowse%2F%3Fstr%3Db%26page%3D2&sid=66034167a94cadbd2f7966636b3579b1&country=248&state=PA" rel="nofollow">http://www.puppyfind.com/for_sale/?breed...</a><br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  and if you dont like those here are some from NY<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.puppyfind.com/for_sale/?breed_id=25&order_by=rand&back=%2Fbrowse%2F%3Fstr%3Db%26page%3D2&sid=66034167a94cadbd2f7966636b3579b1&country=248&state=NY" rel="nofollow">http://www.puppyfind.com/for_sale/?breed...</a><br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  hope i helped and good luck !
TjLCnxkKaa	That would be a fantastic set up. In the wild they live in paddy fields which can be lake sized. People often confuse shallow with small. <br>  <br>  Plant it with lots of live plants and use a gentle filter and a heater set between 75-82F. Preferably cycle the tank before you add him and you will have one of the worlds happiest bettas.<br>  <br>   20-25%water changes every two weeks (if you have a filter), or just replacing evaporation, but if you just have the betta in there you could get away with doing it less often.<br>  <br>  Good luck|`|dYOpKvOCaa	Hey!<br>  Totally go for a betta! They are SO beatufil! I have 2 of my own. 20 gallons is tons of water. That betta will be real lucky (I only give mine about a gallon each). I would suggest a filter and air pump. If you have a filter it will be WAY easier to keep the tank clean and your betta happy. A air pump would also be a good idea, espically if the tank has a lid wtih no vents. He will do fine. He will swim around a be happy. I gurentee it. Just fill the tank with live or silk plants, gravel at the bottem and maybe a small rock, aquarim wood and maybe a little hiding place like a cave or something. :)  He wil be the happest fish alive!|`|N4Ab2pnzaa	yeah he should be fine, i don't think you really need  a filter, but you should, it will help him live a longer life, and you should probably do 15%-25% water changes a week. You should also get a heater, they like warm waters than cold.<br>  <br>  Have you also considered tank mates for bettas?|`|09fdLaeIaa	it'll have a lot of room<br>  i have 2 bettas myself<br>  used to have 6 <br>  4 of them died|`|FNM8q2odaa	he might get bored so put some stuff in there but other than that i think he'll love it. if i could afford a tank that big that's what i would do|`|a2cjwMKcaa	No problem keeping a betta in a 20gal tank. It would not need heavy filtering, but you want something to circulate the water and process the ammonia. But a smaller filter, air powered sponge or undergravel would be fine. The betta would probably survive without one, but you would have to clean and change the water more often.<br>  <br>  I would still suggest weekly cleans, but probably just a glass wipe, gravel vac and 10% water change just to keep things in top shape. It could probably go longer, but the tank will start looking a bit neglected with algae around the place.<br>  <br>  There is no such thing as an understocked tank ;-)<br>  <br>  Ian|`|h4wNRqf9aa	minor filtration if that... biweekly water changes would even work<br>  <br>  <br>  good choice
V4hZg8lMaa	Well cockatiels aren't very colorful...I suggest a parakeet (budgie) if you are new at owning birds...if you are experienced...then I suggest a smaller parrot or a larger parakeet. they are colorful and can learn to speak in phrases, they can learn tricks and are very entertaining. Budgies dont need too much attention while smaller parrots need a lot of time and attention. Either way...look them up online or get some books and read up on them...find out which better suits your life style.|`|BWtUpBXNaa	Cockatiels are fun. My girlfriend has a parrot and its fun. She also has parakeets which are pretty cool. It depends what you are looking for.|`|sPiwb8Hraa	Cockatiels are of medium intelligence. I have six of them you can see them in my 360 blog if you want. For your requirements, consider a larger bird such as a parrot, grey, or macaw and check into adoption because they are cheaper and abandoned everywhere right now. You can get one for very cheap and save a life at the same time. Good luck.|`|2Ku4DuvCaa	If you would like to get a cockatiel, I highly recommend finding a reputable breeder to do so. That way you can be sure that the bird was always treated well and is healthy- and it will also give you a number of healthy happy birds to choose from. That gives you the opportunity to have one pick YOU. Trust me, it's awesome when a bird picks their owner. It's a bond you'll always cherish.<br>  <br>  Cute, original, fun, talented, and colourful? A cockatiel certainly fits that bill! There are so many colour mutations with cockatiels that it's hard to find two that look exactly the same. They're known to be smart, cuddly, and playful birds. I can attest to this as I've trained many and own one. <br>  <br>  Other parrots you can look at are various species of conrures, Senegals, and quaker parakeets. <br>  <br>  Keep in mind that a parrot is not an easy pet, and they do require a commitment from you. They live for a long time, and they have very specific caging, social, dietary and veterinary needs. Do your own research on each parrot that interests you and make sure you can provide for them BEFORE bringing one home.<br>  <br>  I also recommend that you get any parrot that you decide on from a reputable breeder. Again, you can be assured that they're healthy and well treated, and another up side to getting one from a breeder is that they more often than not cost a LOT less than buying one from a pet store. <br>  <br>  Best of luck to you!|`|Qa847j3Paa	Definitely a cockatiel i have one and she is a total sweet heart now some types aren't very colorful but they are fun and can talk if you teach them if you don't want a cockatiel get a lovebird there is a type called peach face which are very colorful and they are very loving and if cared for right can live for a long time i had one for 7 years.|`|MRUo3dgGaa	cockatiels are great birds however there is alot more to owning a bird than people realize. tiels generaly like alot of attention while males may be very vocal they can be little feathered sharks. I have 2 teils and love them both they have lifespans up to 60 years average is around 30. make sure you get your bird a good size cage and many perches toys and mirrors. they can easily be hand tamed spend the extra cash and get a fresh hand tamed hand fed weaned youngster that way it gets to bond with you from the start.|`|QFOxtFSfaa	Oh my gosh you should;<br>  i have two;<br>   Romeo and Juliet<br>  they ARE fun and very loving;<br>  if u keep them indoors;<br>  i would recommend not clipping their wings because they need a lot<br>  of exercise;  if u want to put them outside all of the time (like take them on the porch then you can buy a dog fence and Clip there wings so they wont fly away;they love the mirror and like to jump on ur head if they are inside and u are in the bathroom by the mirror; (its so cute;) they are adventurous too;<br>  you can buy a medium sized cage or a big one; (i would choose the big one)and they love fruit and veggies;<br>  they love to sing to;<br>  you can teach males to repet and mimic sounds; but females are harder;<br>  i hope you find this helping;<br>  any help? messege me (LOL)|`|UOmJbxkOaa	You should get a cockateil because i got one and i LOVE IT!!!
280d96ad7b5e9ffad03a34a66cac5db0aa	No, you don't have to get "a bigger one." Tanks are completely inadequate for rats, regardless of size. Rats have highly sensitive respiratory systems, and tanks provide horrific ventilation. See the problem? The ammonia fumes from their urine will quickly damage their fragile respiratory systems. Plus, rats just love to climb. They're little monkeys. But, as I'm sure you've noticed, tanks are made of glass. Rats can't climb smooth glass walls. Finally, it's hard to hang cage staples like hammocks in a tank.<br>  <br>  So, best tip: get him a friend. Why: <a href="http://www.nfrs.org/company.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.nfrs.org/company.html</a><br>  How to introduce them: <a href="http://ratguide.com/care/behavior/introducing_rats.php" rel="nofollow">http://ratguide.com/care/behavior/introd...</a><br>  <br>  I'd love to ooze more advice, but could you be a little more specific about what kind of "tips" you need? Diet recommendations? Bedding of preference? Signs of respiratory infection? Fun games? How to make a hammock? Foods and other items that you must not give?|`|2BV9EgZ5aa	Well yeah tanks are bad for rats he should have a wire cage and definantly get at least one more, a same sex or one that has been fixed, (rats are very social) Try harlan lab blocks they are the best kind of food to get or regular rat food with some cherios or healthy cereal for snacks.    Once he gets a wire cage get some hamocks, or old baby blakets you tie to the corners, rats love to climb.  Any only boxes he can hide in and you HAVE to let him out every day or he wont be tame. The more you handle him the better pet he will be.   Alot of baby toys are good for rats but ALL bird toys are good as some baby toys can be toxic if eaten. Also if you are sure hes a male (not hard to tell im sure) when you get another rat a male rat they might fight at first, so introduce them in the bathroom or on the couch or somewhere neither has been (peed) before.  Feel free to email me with any questions. i wish you lived close to me I have an old cage Im giving away (Colorado FYI!)|`|GksOStrsaa	Awwww... Please don't use a tank... Rats are very active and curious so find plenty of things to put in their cage. Also, change the scenery every once in a while. I really good idea is to cut shoe boxes into little huts. Cheap and they work!! You can't keep them for long though because they get peed on. The cage needs to be cleaned at least once a week. You should get your rat a friend.

RnydKwARaa	I took an advanced dog grooming course, yes i did get bitten once, by a min poodle, little beggar drew blood and many others tried to take chucks out of me but you soon learn who is going to be stroppy and muzzle them, it is very tiring physically, on your feet all day, bending and twisting, however, seeing the owners faces when they come to pick their pooch up is well worth the aggro, if you do a good job people will return to you and your business should thrive.<br>  <br>  Good luck<br>  x|`|jyGTlpzTaa	It is definitely a job you do for love, not money. It is very poorly paid and you will end up with aching shoulders, arms and necks from getting in difficult positions to cut and groom awkward parts of the coat. You also have to be very firm with the dogs otherwise they take the P*ss. Also, you prob will get bitten at some point, but in my limited experience its the little yappers like yorkies you will have problems with, not big dogs like german shepherds, they are usually much less likely to bite!
RMWeFoRAaa	It is obvious the other people who have answered you have not had similar cat issues.  I feel your pain.  I have a cat that regularly uses my leather couch to poop on when he gets mad....then he started wetting on it as well!    He has also wet on my bed when another animal has visited the house.  I myself haven't been to the doctor for an annual physical in over 8 years but spent an unreal amount of  money on his vet bill.  Even a Colonoscopy!!!!   When nothing was found wrong with him I requested we try a round of Prozac.  I had read that it might help with behavior problems and since medical issues had been ruled out.....seemed he had a scew loose.....!  He was on this drug for 6 months and has been off for a year and a half.  While we have an occasional issue(once in 6-8 months or so)  he seems to have pretty much resolved his "emotional" problems.   I wish you luck with this.  Only you can make the decision on working on the problem or giving up.  If you do give the cat away....PLEASE make sure the people know of all the issues.  Otherwise your cat may end up on the street.  Not everyone is as willing or patient with animals destroying their homes as others.|`|qWzzus8haa	There are problems numerous reasons why your cat is doing that. If you have changed his litter brand recently, that could be a problem. Some litters are too perfumy or dusty for cats and they do not like to use it. If you have changed his litter box recently, perhaps he does not like the new one. If you have changed the location of the box, perhaps he does not like it, perhaps it is in a noisy area or it is not private enough. If you have other cats in the house and one litter box, this could also be a factor. The cat should not be out down because of this, try putting a litter box in your bed room. It may be a little unpleasant, but it is an alternative to him leaving presents on your bed. Try putting multiple cat litters in different areas.|`|x6XlNYH7aa	This is a difficult one to solve - I know from experience. <br>  By putting his scent in places that smell of you he is saying you belong to him. <br>  You can buy a product called Feliway that can be sprayed in areas he chooses that can sometimes work. Otherwise you are looking at shutting him out of all those areas even if just temporarily to break the habit.<br>  You don't say about his other toilet habits. If he is refusing to use a litter tray at all you need to solve that problem too. I have a cat that will use a litter tray only with no litter in it (and I am okay with that rather than her going elsewhere).<br>  If you reach a point that you cannot cope please take him to a shelter - don't put him down.|`|UOmJbxkOaa	I had a cat that did that except peed all over but we had to bring her to somewhere else so dont put her down|`|nY2hZrUMaa	dnt put him down for pooping!<br>  just make sure you keep all the doors shut in the rooms you dont want him to cr@p in<br>  good luck|`|VMY7No0eaa	I would put him in a room where he can be free but not poo on a bed or chouch.  <br>  This is a tough one... obviously he learned this and still thinks it is something he can do.<br>  they do have pads that vibrate when the cat jumps on it... <br>  foster and smith .com I think they have them.|`|UNFxjNHkaa	what do you mean should you put him down?  <br>  He's 5 years old and perfectly healthy.<br>  Just having a litter box issue.|`|iIGOi2Idaa	Yeeaaahh, you sound like a real cat lover.

9I8ZuixXaa	The Whippet is a dog of unusual and generally contradictory traits: he is a couch potato at home and a whiz on the track or agility course.<br>  <br>  Bred by working class families in England’s mining districts to hunt rabbits for the stewpot and provide entertainment at weekend races, the elegant Whippet is the youngest of the sighthound breeds. Thought to be the result of crossing small Greyhounds with smooth and rough-coated terriers, the miners’ dogs were coarser in appearance than today’s svelte dog. When the breed drew the attention of British fanciers, Italian Greyhounds were added to the gene pool to produce the clean, graceful lines of the modern Whippet.<br>  <br>  After a brief career as a “snap dog” used to catch and kill rabbits in an enclosed space, the Whippet’s speed and Britain’s growing disgust with animal baiting contests led fanciers to concentrate on sprint racing, a sport still popular among owners.<br>  <br>  The Whippet traveled to the US with English mill operators in the mid-1800s, and the Massachusetts mill towns of Lawrence and Lowell became the center of Whippet racing in this country.<br>  <br>  The American Kennel Club registered its first Whippet in 1888, and in 2000, the breed was 63rd in individual registrations with 1914 dogs and 73rd in litter registrations with 457 litters. Both numbers were up slightly from 1999 when 1869 dogs and 417 litters were logged in.<br>  <br>  <br>  --------------------------------------...<br>  <br>  Form, function, and appearance<br>  The Whippet is a sighthound, a subset of the hound group that traces its history back to the days of the Pharaohs in Egypt and the nomadic tribes of the Middle East. Greyhounds, Pharaoh Hounds, Ibizan Hounds, Borzoi, Salukis, Afghan Hounds and others share this common background and were of unparalleled value to their owners in the early centuries of civilization. Sighthounds hunt by scanning for movement, not tracking by scent, and so have keen eyesight to catch even the slightest disturbance in their surroundings. Once the game is sighted, all else pales into insignificance as the dog concentrates on the chase.<br>  <br>  Sighthound structure is the key to both speed and stamina. Although the dog is slender in appearance, it must have well-laid-back shoulder blades, space between the withers to aid in shock absorption, well-sprung ribs for lung-power that allows endurance, and a well-muscled body for propulsion. The well-built Whippet may well be the fastest animal of its size; it can reach 35 miles per hour and cover 16 yards per second at full speed.<br>  <br>  The AKC breed standard uses these phrases in describing the breed: “... the appearance of elegance and fitness”; “... covers a maximum of distance with a minimum of lost motion”; “power and balance without coarseness”; and “Symmetry of outline, muscular development and powerful gait are the main considerations.” The Whippet puts it all together in a package ranging from 18-22 inches at the withers and 25-35 pounds on the scale. As with many breeds, bitches are smaller than dogs.<br>  <br>  The clean lines that give the breed its lovely profile are critical to its speed. The arched loin and the well-muscled rear contribute to the powerful drive that propels the dog forward into its ground-eating double-suspension gallop, a leaping gait that finds the dog completely off the ground at two points in the gallop sequence. A well-formed, muscular front end then pushes the dog into the second half of the gait cycle. <br>  <br>  The Whippet head is long and lean with large, dark eyes and small, fine ears that tip over at the tip. Erect ears are undesirable. The arched neck is long and muscular, the tail is long and tapering. The coat is smooth and very short, and a variety of colors and patterns are acceptable. Whippets can be solid black or white or can be patched or brindled in red, fawn, blue, or cream.<br>  <br>  <br>  --------------------------------------...<br>  <br>  The Whippet as pet<br>  Elegance isn’t the only trait that endears the Whippet to its owners, for this is an affectionate, mild-mannered dog that is generally good with other dogs and cats, is quiet in the house, and needs little daily care. This gentle dog may bark at strangers but is normally friendly with visitors, and should be watched around small household pets such as rats, ferrets, or guinea pigs. The Whippet’s favorite indoor pastime is curling up next to a person on a couch or in a bed.<br>  <br>  If the Whippet has a drawback, it is the need for vigilance to prevent escape. A loose Whippet is a long-gone Whippet, for the breed loves to run and will indulge itself when given the opportunity. However, a fenced-in back yard, plenty of play sessions, and frequent walks on a leash should provide enough exercise for this athletic dog.<br>  <br>  Whippets also do well in obedience training, agility, lure coursing, flyball, Frisbee?, and racing.<br>  <br>  A relatively long-lived breed, the Whippet often reaches 15 years of age. Generally hea|`|FQmZLqMdaa	Good choice. Very beautiful gentle creatures.  They are attention seekers who love to lie on your bed or sofa & snuggle up on you & sleep.  They don't need much exercise & are fantastic. They make excellent guard dogs although they are docile they bark & sound really ferocious. <br>  <br>  I have two.  Bella came from Babbington Kennels in Nottinghamshire, England & was 4 years old.  She had broken ribs, been starved, over raced & recently had puppies.  She was so terrified in the kennels they thought she was going to die from stress/anxiety.  Luckily for me I went to the kennels & asked to view another mutt but then I saw the massive big brown pleading eyes on stalks.  The kennelmaid said she would be a difficult dog to care for.  Didn't put me off.  Told kennels I'd be back in 2 hours with teh photo's of our garden & the payment & went home to consult a friend who had kept the little darlings for years.<br>  He tried to talk me out of it!  2 hours later I was the owner of a terrified girl who walked out the kennel gate with her tail between her legs but after being with me for 2 hours she was a different dog.  No house training required.  All she needed was a decent warm bed, food & lots of love.  4 years on she is now 20kgs (overweight but I broke my foot & then she was seriously ill) but I could not have chosen a sweeter more devoted animal in all the world.   She hates the postman (he's terrified of dogs) tried to run away from her he took 6 seconds to get out the gate she had scaled the fence & was waiting at the gate in 3, now they stare at each other.If someone attacked me she would attack back no question she would do very little damage but that is how she is.<br>  <br>  I adopted a Pedigree Whippet puppy called Echo last October from a disabled lady whose husband had left her alone with 3 young kids & a dog she couldn't walk.  I own her but she is Bella's child.  I cannot separate them, nor would I want too.  She is very beautiful & skinny was 4kgs when she arrived but is almost 6kgs now.<br>  <br>  They are fun dogs to own.  People ask if you feed them but a Whippet will eat & eat & eat, if left alone in a house full of food (no wrappings) they would clear the lot.  Once they are trained to re-call they disappear for a couple of minutes then mow you down in excitement when they come back.  We walk for 5 minutes most days & then they get let off to race around the field just around the corner from our house for as long as they want.<br>  <br>  The only downsides I have found to the Whippet is they hate small children (1-3 years), they chase & eat cats (Bella has 6 kills to date), Echo is still practising (not got to the chasing bit yet).  Bella also hates car travel.  She gets in the car ok then starts whimpering by the time you have got around the corner you have full blown whale song (think it's part of her abuse).  Echo on the other hand is completely the opposite.  She lies on the big bed in the boot of the estate car & sleeps occasionally growling at Bells because she wakes her up.<br>  <br>  If you want to take one is be very wary of ex-raced ones because very often they are not house trained & once they reach 4 years of age it is lmost impossible to train them.<br>  <br>  I would try a Shelter, then look on the internet in the Uk we have a Pre-loved website where you can list any animal you want to rehome for whatever fee you require.  There is also a website called Gumtree (that is where Echo came from ￡50).  A shelter/rescue Whippet is usually spayed/neutered prior to adoption or a condition of adoption, for me breeding has never been an option.  Bella was spayed 3 years ago & Echo is being done next month.<br>  <br>  Hope I helped a little & that you get your little guy or guys soon (one is never enough).  I originally wanted an Italian Greyhound but they are ￡2,500 upwards so when I win the lottery perhaps.  I will never get rid of my girls no matter what my situation.|`|6SeWCfUfaa	Whippets are cool.  They need a good run everyday to stretch out those legs, but as far as house dogs go, I think they're some of the best.  They like to kick back in a squishy place, snooze and will usually amuse themselves with a toy or something.  They're not as 'needy' as some of the other breeds.  They do shed, but not a lot and are super easy to groom.  Which you won't have to do often because they're pretty cat like when it comes to staying clean.  They can be tough to potty train because they're picky about the weather and surfaces they want to be on ... wet grass, good luck getting whippet out on that to pee.  They're very trainable, but most have a lot of prey drive.  Which means, if something is moving, they're going to want to chase it.  So, you need to make sure you're in a secure area if they are off leash.<br>  <br>  I think they're awesome dogs in a lot of ways.|`|oG4zM4m1aa	wippets are best known for racing.<br>  they're very skinny..<br>  their bones are brittle. <br>  they're beautiful!! GREAT with kids.<br>  very quiet.|`|bPdqwkpPaa	Whippets don't come into shelters very often and when they do, they are usually pulled by Whippet rescue.  I'll BRB with a rescue link for you. <br>  <br>  Whippets are sighthounds with a touch of terrier.  They are dogs that are triggered by motion and will stop at nothing to get what's moving.  Usually, that includes all varities of small animals, including small dogs, cats, squirrels, mice, moles, etc.  The "stop at nothing" is literal.  They will run through 8 lanes of freeway to get a rabbit on the other side - usually with tragic results.  It's a common cause of death in sighthounds; not being properly secured and running.  <br>  <br>  The terrier side makes them more highly strung than some other sighthounds and often much more active. <br>  <br>  A whippet should have at least a 6ft fence in it's yard and a person who understand the quirks of sighthounds.  They MUST be on a leash whenever they aren't in an enclosed area and preferably with a martingale collar.  They are problem children meaning they will climb fences, trees, tables, or whatever they can to get out.  They will also counter-surf regularly, often cannot be trusted to run with smaller animals, and are very sensitive to loud noises, punishment, and correction.<br>  <br>  Added:  Actually, they are not good with many kids.  A well-trained kid, yes, but one who is irresponsible or loud will be a poor match.    They are not small greyhounds that laze all day every day.  They are quite active dogs.  They do love their furniture and love being lazy, but they need to get out an move and will bounce off the walls if not exercised enough. <br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.americanwhippetclub.net/awcpages/whipfaq.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.americanwhippetclub.net/awcpa...</a>|`|hRikwc00aa	I own one whippet, and she's one of the best dogs I've ever had.<br>  <br>  They are quiet and don't need lots of exercise, though they love a good run. Complete couch potatoes in the house, they love nothing more than laying on a lap and being spoiled. They do shed but are easy to groom. They are very sweet and affectionate, though young whippets (as all young dogs) do get into mischief! They are a joy to watch and own, and are very intelligent a trainable. They excel at dog sports like agility and flyball. Make sure your whippet gets lots of socialization, though, as they can be timid without it. As long as they are socialized, they are friendly and outgoing with strangers.<br>  <br>  They do have a very strong prey drive, so unless you want to spend a very long time perfecting the recall, your whippet needs to be on-leash or in an enclosed area. Whippets not raised with cats from puppies cannot always be trusted with them.<br>  <br>  However, if you live in the US, it may be hard trying to find one in a shelter, as they are not very popular (I don't see why!).

znGpjsGjaa	Please do not buy a rabbit from a pet store. Try and find a breeder near you. You will get a healthier and happier rabbits that way. It will cost about the same (many even less) than the pet store rabbits.<br>  <br>  The best way to find a breeder near you is to go on the ARBA (American Rabbit Breeders Assoc) website and look for a show near you. Shows are held every weekend and all over the US. There will be many (almost all of the breeds recognized) at the show. Many breeders bring rabbits with them to sell. By buying from a breeder you will get a healthy, pedigreed pet with the backing of a reputable breeder behind it.

They will also know the available rabbits and what they are like so you can get one to suit your needs. Adoption fees vary and they are listed on their sites or you can call them to ask. Some of the places are as low as 25$ up to 80$ as far as I saw. They also come spayed/neutered already and litterbox trained! Most are much nicer from these groups as well because they are handled every day, but at pet stores they are not handled and it will take much longer for them to be affectionate towards you. <br>  <br>  Good luck! :)

280d96ad7b5e9ffad03a34a66cac5db0aa	First of all, I'd recommend reading this: <a href="http://www.rottweiler.net/forums/general-info/57934-why-rottweiler-not-everyone.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.rottweiler.net/forums/general...</a><br>  <br>  Now, no. You should not get a puppy, simple as that. Young puppies must not be left at home for longer than two hours. Eight hours is literally begging to come home to a puppy and crate covered in urine and feces. At a young age, you can *begin* crate training, but puppies can't be left in them for long periods of time. And that's that. They're balls of energy, and you can't expect one to remain in a crate for eight hours a day, plus however long it'll be crated overnight. They literally can't control their bowels and bladder long enough, either. A good rule of thumb is that dogs can "hold it" for one hour per one month of life. Thus, you won't be able to leave your puppy all alone at home while you're at work until he's a *minimum* of eight months old. And that might be pushing it.<br>  <br>  If you're looking to adopt an older puppy.. then by all means.<br>  <br>  Anyway, here's how to introduce a dog to a crate: <a href="http://www.hsus.org/pets/pet_care/our_pets_for_life_program/dog_behavior_tip_sheets/crate_training.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.hsus.org/pets/pet_care/our_pe...</a>|`|0IMf5SATaa	Only people who don't care about leaving a social animal (and a baby one at that) alone for the majority of the day. <br>  <br>  In general, if you have to ask yourself if you have time for a dog, let alone one that is going to be very young, demanding, intelligent (and so get bored) and is a breed that needs a lot of time spent on it because of their tendancies towards aggressiveness in the wrong circumstances, the answer is no you don't.|`|ccpBuUewaa	i'm not entirely sure<br>  but i think it'll be the best if there is <br>  someone at least to take care for your puppy.<br>  <br>  because if a puppy grows up without any care&no one around, <br>  he might be, i don't know, acting nervous around many ppl.<br>  that's how it was to my dog. he grew up that way.<br>  he was given to us for care. now he's perfectly fine, energetic.=]|`|GU0yA5raaa	I used to do the same thing and had a rottweiler and it was fine but I would let it stay outside (make sure there is shade) until the dog was potty trained|`|GSf09ALBaa	I am not going to pass judgment on you but a puppy needs to have regular potty breaks and no way can hold it for 8 hours.  If you really want to do right by this puppy, enroll her in a puppy day care.  Just like having a small kid and working.  <br>  <br>  If you cannot do that, do not get a puppy.  Get an older dog that is already housebroken and can be left alone during the day.|`|w4X6Y7tIaa	No.I have a rottie and I live in a household where someone is always home.Rotties are not the kind of dog that can be crated they are the kind of dog that need to be trained,watched and need attention 24/7.If you leave it alone all day he can turn mean/restless and you don't want that in a 100 lb. dog.
2IhKJjY1aa	What I do when I syphon I put my finger at the end of the hose in the tank.  One so I can regulate the flow and two to make sure the fish stay away.  If you do want to remove them make sure you have prepared water at room temp.  Prepared I mean with clorinator in it.  Get a large fish bowl and pour the water in it then take the fish out.  I do this every few months when I have to do a big water change.|`|W48xQOJOaa	my suggestion: get to cups fill both with warm water take out the fish and put one in each cup then do it<br>  (make sure the cups have space)|`|kOiMO1ceaa	No, you shouldn't take the fish out every time, since you have to do it about once every week. I'm sure it'll be alright since the suction on the siphon shouldn't be enough to suck up the shrimp with them giving a fight. The first month for the platies are very important since it's practically life or death in there, with them getting used to the water and such. So you should try not to remove the platies as much as possible.<br>  <br>  Hope this helps. :)|`|wZOO4Icwaa	just be careful when siphoning

3LXbUg1raa	On average, most female adult horses will have at least 36 teeth: 12 incisors, 12 premolars, and 12 molars.  In addition, sometimes, but rarely, a female horse may also have canine teeth.  A horse can have up to 4 canine teeth, though if present in a mare, usually only 1 or 2 canines are present.  Some horses may also get wolf teeth.  A horse can have up to 4 wolf teeth, though normally, only 1-2 wolf teeth are present.  <br>  <br>  So in answer to your question, a mare typically has 36 teeth but may have up to 44 teeth in more rare cases.|`|UIM8X38Oaa	36 to 40 <br>   36 for sure<br>   0 to 4 wolf teeth are possible<br>   rarely canine but possible
280d96ad7b5e9ffad03a34a66cac5db0aa	One of my cats loves the dishwashing detergent. The moment he wears my mom doing the dishes, he hurries over and perches on the counter above the dishwasher so that he can smell the soap. If the bottle is on the counter, he rubs his head on it.<br>  <br>  The same cat tends to be paranoid. Sometimes, in the middle of the night, it's like he thinks we all sneaked away and left him. He roams around until he finds someone, giving this deep, long, loud, soulful, pitiful meow. (He rarely meows otherwise.) As soon as he spots someone (or someone spots he), he bounds over and rubs himself all over them like they were the last cuddly human on Earth.<br>  <br>  The other cat tends to be a bully. Say he's sitting on the table. He'll look at the dog, meow, and stand at the very edge of the table. For all the world, it looks like he's beckoning the dog over. So, the dog goes over to say hi. ..and the cat smacks him in the muzzle.. meows angrily.. rubs his face on the dog's muzzle.. and licks him. Say hello to bipolar cat.<br>  <br>  And my dog is just a goofball, everything about him is a little off.|`|AA10255776	One of my cats loves to drag socks around the house.  She'll pull them out of a basket or open drawer and walk around making muffled meows-in fact she has a special sock-carrying meow!  Then she piles them up outside our bedroom.  She mostly does it at night or while we're at work.<br>  <br>  My male cat drools when he's happy rather than purring (like, A LOT of drool it's hilarious!) He also climbs up on me in bed, grabs my bangs (fringe for you Brits) and yanks on them to wake me up to pet him, then he'll fall asleep with them in his mouth.<br>  <br>  My little dog loves to dig holes in her hole-digging spot in our backyard, and while she's digging she'll either spin around and bark at the dirt she's flinging up or she barks into the hole.  She loves to chase planes & helicoptors when they fly over (probably not unusual).

ZYzhBhgJaa	I agree with Jandismommie, go look & see what catches your eye. The puffer are pretty interesting, but you would need to do some research, some larger puffers, like the figure 8 or green spotted puffers require brackish water, but the dwarf puffers are freshwater. I've never owned a puffer, but I love watching them at the LFS, they are so cute, and have such cute personalities. They wiggle when they swim up to the glass, and will swim right up to the glass when you look in. I would study up on them if you decide on this, they should not be kept with other fish, and are a little harder to keep, but everyone I've talked to that has had them loves them. <br>  Another option are the angelfish, they are interesting, and you could put them in a tank with other types of fish, like a rainbow shark or some gouramis.<br>  If you want something colorful, check out the wide range of African cichlids. Some electric blues or electric yellows are really pretty, they are considered the most colorfish you can get without going saltwater. They are aggressive though, and you should study up on them before buying. I have tiger barbs, which I love, they are a schooling fish, and also swim up to the glass when you look in the tank. Just remember if you go with any of the fish I mentioned, they are all aggressive or semi-aggressive, and would require lots of hiding places. Good luck, happy fish shopping!|`|h4wNRqf9aa	BGK get FAR too big for a 20 gallon... guppies are alright but still rather blase for most people's taste (thumbs down was not from me)<br>  <br>  <br>  for a 20 gallon a pair of killifish or rams, or even a few dwarf puffers would make for a gret little tank|`|MFgT6fg2aa	My favorite is the guppie!

So many things can happen to little dogs.  He could have been run over they sometimes do not even have marks on them when that happens.  Some people are terrible and poison dogs too.  Poison in dogs is usually antifreeze.  Is there any place he could have licked some off the ground outside your house?  For some reason dogs love the sweet taste of it.  I lost one of my favorite mini=schnauzers because of poison.  I had a mean neighbor throw out hamburger laced with antifreeze.  I was devastated so i know how u feel.  But it's hard to say i had my dog autopsied i worked at a vet clinic and they helped me with it.  Usually if it's a big dog that kills a little one there will be teeth marks or slobbers on the fur of the one they killed.  I am so sorry i know this probably won't help cause it's hard to lose a dog u love so much.  Take care!|`|X43htXqEaa	Did you go to the vet afterwards?

Its an herbal sleep aid. I discovered this by accident when they broke open my bottle and were going nuts rolling around on it.

KEYgd73saa	As the first answer pointed out, it doesn't sound like Ich.  Fungus is extremely likely, particularly because it's a GSP, and you probably have it in freshwater.  Green Spotted Puffers need brackish conditions (as juveniles, almost full saltwater as adults) to stay healthy, and when deprived of an appropriate salinity (specific gravity of 1.008ish), become immunocompromised, leading to infections from pathogens that should be easily fought off.  Simply acclimating the fish to the proper salinity will actually kill the fungus (the fungus won't tolerate so much salt), and prevent it from coming back in the future, as the fish will be healthier with the salt.  However, if you just need a quick fix, do NOT use Pimafix.  It is an awful excuse for a medication, as it's nothing more than dilute tree oils with no proven effect and almost no regulation on quality.  Instead, start with something like Quick Cure or Rid Ich-- anything with formalin and malachite green, or copper (Aquarisol, Organicure, Coppersafe, etc.), or even the generic Fungus Clear or Fungus Eliminator (both of which are also good at treating bacterial infections, and preventing secondary infections).<br>  <br>  Puffers are scaleless fish, which makes them extremely sensitive to medication, which is why nearly all medications suggest you use a HALF dose when treating them.  Your fish started dying because you overdosed them and they were already weak from being kept in freshwater, rather than the more appropriate brackish tank.|`|W02kTOqmaa	You want to try to avoid chemicals as much as possible, but for treatment, they are usually necessary.<br>  <br>  First, a "slimy" body isnt signs of ick. It sounds like a fungus, to me. Ick is white little spots all over the body, concentrating and starting on the fins and gills. Slime sounds like a fungus. A good treatment for fungus is Pimafix. You can find it in PetSmart. Make sure you follow all directions, and remove the carbon from your filter, as carbon just neutralizes medication.<br>  <br>  If it was ick, then raise the temperature in your tank to about 80 degrees, and put aquarium salt in, as well. That is a good way to rid the tank of ick. Again, just follow the directions on the bottle of aquarium salt
ytGdMcQsaa	I think its ok to buy in both places but if you are going to buy online even one fish, get ready to spend like 30 bucks for shipping. You should only buy online when you buy alot of fish so the shipping will sound reasonable instead of spending 10 bucks on fish and 30 for shipping.|`|kOiMO1ceaa	I would say that buying them in-store is better. Since if you buy them online, you don't see where the fish comes from, and you can't see if there are any dead fish or sick fish in the tank where it comes from. But from buying it in-store, you can see how the fish is before you buy it, and if there are any sicknesses/death in the tank. Just don't buy any fish that is in a tank with sick/dead fish.<br>  <br>  Good luck. :)|`|CBo23fuOaa	in pet store becuase sometimes online it dose not work|`|bZWk8uBuaa	no pet store online ones could have disses|`|FkGh0LuWaa	I will only buy my fish at a pet store so I know exactly what I am getting.|`|ZYzhBhgJaa	If you buy online, expect to be charged at least $25 for shipping. Also, if you buy from the pet store, you can inspect the fish & the tank before purchasing to make sure that the tank looks disease free & your fish is healthy. It's not a guarantee, but it's better than buying blind. Some fish store offer a guarantee, I know petsmart guarantees their fish for 2 weeks, no questions asked. A lot of internet sites guarantee their fish too, but I don't know how that would work. Who would want to bother with shipping back a dead fish, not to mention, you'd still be out the initial shipping fee.
ORe8qdtTaa	So has spanking stopped it?  No so it dont work then does it?<br>  <br>  Can you not figure it out - shut your bedroom door, train your dog using a reward based method and every time it goes on your bed - smack yourself round the head for not ensuring the dog has been out to toilet and you've shut the door!<br>  <br>  Never hit your dog its cruel teaches it nothing and will make it scared of you.|`|bO2rzfISaa	You should NEVER hit a dog. Confine it in a crate or with baby gates so it can't pee on the bed. That's an incredibly annoying problem that I couldn't figure out. <br>  <br>  If your idea of training a dog is hitting, just don't have one.|`|AA10029366	Yes...and your should probably stop letting your dog *on* the bed, if this is a consistent problem.<br>  <br>  Just a thought.|`|tFKQYT6Naa	my puppy used to do the same thingg.... you shouldnt spank her because when you do that that usually makes the dog mad and then he/she keeps doing it cuz they know it gets you mad... also he/she might be doing it because it is a sense on dominece and its their way of showing you their territory...some ways you can help this problem is getting some wee wee pads or takin he/she out frequently to use the bathroom and when he or she does you reward them and give them lots of praise when they use the bathroom in the right place... hope i hepled!!<br>  good luck|`|145RUNQHaa	Keep your dog out of your bedroom for a few days it's possible your dog is urinating on your bed in a territorial manner and wanting to claim your bed as his own so you need to let your dog know that's your space and don't let him in there.|`|9EKecl3Daa	You need to take your dog to the vet, it could be a UTI.|`|HQFiqm2Haa	you should try a reward system. positive reinforcement is going to have more of an effect than negative. when your dog goes outside, give him a treat and make a big deal about being a good dog. i know it's hard, but try to keep from seeming angry when he goes on the bed. then he'll see that he's a good boy when he goes outside and it has no effect when he goes on your bed. they usually choose the treat and praise.|`|JpvX0ZY2aa	dont EVER EVER EVER EVER hit a dog.  they dont learn anything except being afraid.  get some potty pads and a doggy door.  hope this helps!
m16gf9mzaa	That is not unheard of.  Domestic cats can and will form social groups similar to a loose pride of lions if there are sufficient resources (i.e. plentiful food).  Female cats often work together to raise their litters in common.  The auntie cat is probably trying to help, and just does not realize she has no milk.  You need to separate the momma cat and her kittens from the other cat.  That is just all there is to it.  Whether you do that by shutting the momma and her kittens in one room all to themselves with food, water and a litter box, or shutting the other cat in a room by herself with the necessities, is up to you.|`|inST4SlAaa	i would try to keep them separated with separate food, etc.<br>  <br>  try to give the one a small stuffed animal to "take care"<br>  <br>  i think she is using her maternal instincs even though she is not one who had the babies|`|6be65543422b4937c27d1761a2ed50a0aa	When I was raising kittens, this would happen sometimes.  I fixed an extra large box for everyone and when the "other" mother would take a kitten, I'd get BOTH of them and put them in the box!  My cats didn't mind being in the same box and "sharing the mothering", so that worked for me.  <br>  <br>  If your mama cat doesn't get upset at the other "mama", try this.  If they squabble, then you'll just have to put the "pseudo" mom in a different room until the kittens are weaned, so the "real" mom can feed all of them in peace......<br>  <br>  Hope this helps........Good luck.|`|BQEjpIibaa	you should probably separate them. put the mother and kitten in the bathroom and let the other one rome around the house. the mother needs to be alone with her kitten. she may reject it if the other one keeps taking it. just keep an eye on them both<br>  <br>  good luck|`|5kjYFb9Taa	hmmm hun thats somewhat unusual. Ive never heard of that.<br>  I do know that shes doing that as if the kitten is her own....<br>  <br>  Keep them separated, or give the "fake mother" to a new home...Thats the besrt advice I can give you.|`|Ey5ew3G6aa	maybe the other cat is pregnant or wants to be a mom..<br>  try that|`|z2bVBZ7Zaa	maybe your other cat is sort of motherly? or maybe she's also pregnant and has those hormones, what i would is keep the mother and kittens in a secluded room for a while away from the other cat. That's kind of funny though.|`|HU3GwSdGaa	She just got a good mothering instinct ! be best to keep her away from the kittens for time being in case the natural mother rejects them!..
NS4BJupmaa	well got to warehouses.getloaded.com for the warehouse and a petstore for the reptile
40IUKsC2aa	if your garage is well heated no cold drafts and its safe from other animals then yes.but you will have to keep your hamster in a cage not roaming in the garage.<br>  but i will just say keep it in your house they really don't stink so i don't see whats the problem.|`|FYISPUt4aa	Hamsters have to be kept warm like a human. I would say at least 60 degrees or warmer. Put lots of tissue or paper towels in the cage so it can make a warm nest. Do NOT keep it in a garage with no heat in the winter!! it's like keeping it in a freezer!! it would die.|`|WQno7VwGaa	DO NOT PUT THEM IN THE GARAGE! they have fumes from cars that are harmful and if you close the door and garage door your hamster can die!|`|jyGTlpzTaa	Not if you live in a temperate or cool climate, they will try to hibernate and likely die in the process.
WQno7VwGaa	there arent many, and dont listen to the other people, its ok not wanting to have to always care for ur pet, but getting an imphibian is a lot of work, but if u realy wanted on i would sujest some sort of frog, we caught tad poles at a local park and we put them in  a container half water have rocks and put them out side, we kept the top covered so they wouldnt die of the suns heat, and we fed them frozen lettuce and fish food, we had a lot until it rained alot and flooded the container and they all died, so choose wisely|`|u1HahCoqaa	The others are right. If you do not even know about the creatures you want, or might want, and do not want to spend money on them.....you really shouldnt be getting them. Stick to stuffed animals and pet rocks. All animals need specialized care of some sort- frogs and toads are no different! Besides, did you ever think of what amphibians eat? If you are too cheap to get a heater, or filter, how are you going to afford their nutritional needs?|`|jyGTlpzTaa	If you arent willing to spend any money on your pets you shouldnt have them, sorry.|`|pH1Qz6lAaa	I agree with the first posters, if you want to buy a pet you must be able to spend the time and money on it.
bRxWkpfBaa	If he's started peeing inside when he used to be house trained, you should take him to the vet, he could have a UTI. it could also be behavioral. New person in the house, new pet, moving, stuff like that can cause stress and lead to behavioral issues.|`|GSf09ALBaa	Before you assume this is a 'backwards' housebreaking issue, have an urinalysis done.  He could very well have a bladder/kidney infection.|`|UOmJbxkOaa	Well to house brake him you could probably watch for when he gets really ansy then put im outside or just serch it on google
F2JEvYX7aa	You can see if a Animal shelter will take them.|`|ct8MWxJOaa	petsmart will take them off your hands. they will put it up for adoption at the store.|`|hmjEwKBjaa	You can do a few things... You can give them to a rescue (just google gerbil rescue in your area) or find them another home (friends or classroom?) or give them to a breeder. Just make sure the babies are going to a good home!
LMdFD6FJaa	According to "Keeping Chickens" by Jeremy Hobson and Celia Lewis - <br>  <br>  "Chicks need to learn where the source of heat is straight away.  If rearing is carried out in a big shed, this is best achieved by making a circular surround of cardboard or hardboard and keeping the chicks within this.  The heat lamp is then usually suspended from the ceiling at a height above the floor that ensures the temperature is around 90 degrees F.  Each week, the lamp's height is progressively increased until, by the third week, the temperature at floor level is down to 70 degrees F.  You can usually tell if you have got the temperature right by watching the chicks closely:  If they are huddled under the heater, they are too cold; if they are seen pressing against the surround, they are too hot and the ring should either be enlarged or the heat lamp raised.  After a few days, the cardboard surround can be increased to give the birds more space, eventually being removed altogether.  Once the chicks have reached the age of three weeks, the heat source can be turned off in the day during spells of warm weather.  If only small numbers of chicks are being reared, and the weather is hot, you could take the birds to a small wire pen on the grass outside for a few hours.  however, make sure that the pen is cat-proof, situate it in the shade, and take the chicks inside immediately should it start to rain."<br>  <br>  Hope this helps!<br>  <br>  You can also see what I used for a "brooder" at:  <a href="http://inezbouley.livejournal.com/" rel="nofollow">http://inezbouley.livejournal.com/</a><br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|4qT0TfMZaa	Yes, plus make sure it's secure from nasty little critters like weasels and stoats and foxes and mink - all of which love little yellow chicks!|`|rQlzfHqraa	Sure. Hang the lamp a bit higher then their head when they are standing. If they are warm they will move away from it and if cool they will move under the lamp.
kA0m4ZsCaa	I would just leave a food bowl in his/her cage or whatever so it can eat whenever it pleases. That's what I did when I had a turtle along time ago.|`|Wn3LGHTvaa	It depends mostly on the turtle's age. You can feed a baby twice a day at first and then slow down gradually. By the time a turtle is an adult, you can feed once per week (summer) to once per month (winter).<br>  <br>  Thanks for reminding me. My snapper is due for a meal; it's been a couple of weeks.|`|8cikAYp3aa	juveniles  eat daily, and will eat constantly if allowed to.  Adults  every other.. every third depending on what species you get.  this also changes  by how you keep them.  The aquatics that are outside I feed daily the entire time they are "awake",  and feedings stop when they go down in the mud for winter.  My box turtles eat daily but they can't be allowed to hibernate due to shell damage.|`|AA11966456	I have a juvenile red eared slider (not quite a year old) and I feed it twice a day. You have to be careful with most aquatic turtles because if there is food in the water then they will eat it, no matter how hungry they are so it is easy to over feed them. You kinda just have to imagine how much food they can handle and that's what you give them. Juveniles do need more food than adults. Also, if you are getting an aquatic turtle, then you need to think about getting at least a UV lamp because they require sunlight to develop. You might also think about getting a water heater. Some people don't use them but depending on the water temp. the turtle may not eat if the water is too cool. If your house is usually on the cool side then I would recommend you get one. Some places sell a set up that includes the tank, a heat lamp and UV lamp, a filter, and a dock for the turtle to be able to get out of water. I bought one of these and it saved me a bunch of money, although I did have to buy a few things separately.|`|Q7PkaNSOaa	It depends on what kind of turtle you get.  I recommend a red eared slider.  They can grow large or stay small, depending on the tank size you get.  I have a red eared slider and I love her to death. They require playtime outside of the tank, but you only have to feed them once every other day or so.  Make sure you put enough water in the tank so your turtle has enough room to swim around. And make sure there's something for it to stand on (like a floating log or rock) and that you have a heat lamp to act as sunlight.|`|aGx4gzDfaa	I have a russian tortise and she eats 3 times a day. breakfast, lunch and dinner.  But it will be much different if the turtle you are getting eats live food. (and don't just leave food in the cage, it will constantly eat and get sick)|`|K7T2ZUaUaa	my baby snapper eats once every 3 days lol id say once
TSc8OE4vaa	Yes.  I am in PA and horses who are healthy, sound, sane, and broke are going for less than $500.  Horses who are healthy, sound, and sane but unbroken are free.|`|SuO5jPpuaa	Yes. I live in North Carolina and I know a lot of people who had to give up their horses because of the draught, Hay was hard to find and they were getting it shipped in from other states.
c90696a851f3ee0c6b1f63f7f595eca4aa	I personally don't like it. My large dog has really thick nails, so it simply does not work for him. My other large dog has average thickness of nails, which also doesn't work for him, and he's afraid of the noise and vibration on his nail. I bought a professional quality nail clipper and it works wonders.|`|tPGxPDvBaa	It depends on your dog & size of dog. If you have  small dog, it will work but larger dogs, it won't & the battery runs out quickly.  You would do better to spend a few extra bucks & get a dremel which can be used for other chores unlike a Pedipaws. Before buying I would advise taking dog to groomer for nails & ask them to do both &  which one your dog does better for.  Most times I cut the nails first then grind to take out the sharp edges & get nails a lil shorter since most dogs have long nails.|`|q2uZxyevaa	WAIT!! i got the pedi paws for my dogs and they hated it! they both growled and barked at it and it is not quiet at all|`|1c74cc7ee9876780e94d288d920e0d0aaa	For little dogs and cats it might be ok but for bigger dogs, no way!  My dogs did not mind the sound or vibration of it however, but they are used to their paws being handled.  For me I still use the regular clippers and use the pedipaw for smoothing out any rough edges.|`|GNmzjDHHaa	If it's as good as it appears to be it would be a godsend|`|82cb8f9319b4af25b84a0e62e4814ffbaa	LOL....as soon as I turned mine own to clip my Shelties nails, the fight was on. So, back to the store the pedipaw went.|`|VBT3Itffaa	It's really hard to do my my cairn terrier. (small dog) they make it look so easy! maybe i am doing it wrong.|`|bb60640c96610ff5b7eb5df5251f191caa	From what I've heard they don't have much power behind them so it takes forever to get nails done, and the batteries die pretty quickly as well. <br>  <br>  A dremel has more power behind and can be found for around the same price or lower. The only drawback to the dremel is it won't have the guard so you have to careful not to get long paw hair stuck in it. That problem is easily solved by putting a pair of old nylons over the dogs foot. Nails stick out for dremmeling, hair is protected inside. <br>  <br>  Remember which ever way you to chose to go it won't be worth it without the proper desensitization and training to get the dog used to it.|`|wSCgGAbmaa	I used it on my dog who would fight me and whine and cry when I tried to clip his nails and let me tell you it is great!  it takes a bit longer but after a few testing moments he let me do what needed to be done and I got all four paws trimmed.  If you follow the instructions to get him/her used to the sound and the feel of the vibration then they should be fine.  I just let my dog lay on the couch where he normally is comfy and gave him a treat and went right to town since he already knows the sound of the hair clippers I use to trim his feet feathers... it really is great and my friend who has a high strung young lab uses hers too and says its great and my other friend who is a vet tech uses one on her 5 dogs and she loves hers too.  it saves me the trip to the groomer and buying a toy every time he has to go there LOL.  I would get one, if it doesn't work you can take it back but I love mine!!  Oh and it does smell like its heating up too which is just because you are sanding his nails away, just be sure not to work on the same area for longer than 3 seconds at a time.|`|3O6CTb3saa	I have one and it's not good.  If u are doing little tiny toenails like a Chi it's okay but if u are doing a bigger dogs it's going to take u forever and u are better off just using a good brand of toenail trimmers.  It takes a long time with the pedipaw to get the toenail down to where it belongs and the dog gets tired of waiting.|`|qwD45UBJaa	I've heard it doesn't have enough power. I bought the Dremel Minimite (cordless) for my corgi, and it works great. It has enough power that maybe 5-10 seconds per nail is enough. You can find it at your local hardware store or on Amazon. The only drawback is, unlike the Pedipaw, it does not have a "catcher" for what is sanded down. But, it's really not too messy at all.|`|pT0SFrlFaa	we had a hard time with nail clippers so we took our dog to the vet to have it done they told us we have to do it another day and give her a tranquilizer. so we tried that and they brought her out after a couple minutes and told us that we will have to put her under to trim them. so for a long time we put a muzzle on her and had 2 ppl pin her down. and then we tried the pedi paws and now one person can do it without any problems and when the batteries died we had to use the clippers and we had no problems.|`|S9ZNGhqyaa	I find it a lot easier for my dogs.  I have two dogs, but only one lets me use the clipper.  The other one doesn't like the sound of it.

Some human foods are toxic to cats, even in small amounts, such as onions or chocolate. <br>  2. Most human food is either too highly spiced, or too fat-laced to be good for cats. Even though the food may smell appealing, tummy aches or vomiting might be the end result. <br>  3. A cat regularly fed human food will either lose his taste for his own food, or be too full to eat it. Either way, he will lose the essential nutrients, including taurine, so necessary for cats to survive and thrive. <br>  4. Allowing cats to eat "at the table" is creating your own home-grown monster.

izueNNhuaa	If she just likes you as in she's friendly and requests some attention, then that is perfectly normal. If she's really mean to everyone but respects you completely, is happy in your presence and keeps requesting attention and hugs, maybe you have a smell that she likes, or a voice that attracts her, or you just have a great, but unexplainable connection to this cat.

Just finds a spot and curls up and sleeps.  (I know she sleeps because her fur will be all over the bed and there is a warm spot.)  It doesn't sound like there is a problem to me.  : )

I'll tell you what I've been reco'ing for years to my customers in my "shop"......Iams Smart Puppy for the 1st 2 years.Augment with a chewable puppy vit.At 2 years slowly switch to Nutro Max Senior....good for all life stages. Now I get on a monthly basis good $$ offers to push a particular brand but frankly I just don't have faith in their product.In fact I sell 0 food products.To make sure I was on right path I ran a casual(lazy) 2 year study on a few top tier canine foods(dry).I looked at Iams,Wellness,Blue Buff.,Solid Gold.Ivanco etc.I ran tests for elimination,nutri. ultilization and nutri. content.Oh,I have access to a lab.Now some of the so called "experts" will disagree with me but all I have to say is "prove me wrong".You can't.Here's what I found Michael,Corn is not a killer and if fine ground is a superior source of carbs for explosive energy and growth. Desugared beet pulp acts like a magic magnet in that during elimination it pulls out heavy metals and other toxins like mercury,cadium etc that pet can pick up in dirt,water or just playing.None of the higher $$ products outperformed what I use and recomend.Now if your pets thrive and survive on the $$$ products than by all means keep trucking. Oh, I found more canines are allergic to salmon,wild turkey,duck etc than are corn.At least that's what I've found in my "shop". Come on experts,lets hear your facts concerning my findings.Michael, a good book on training is anything by a long dead old English woman,Barbara Woodhouse.Lots of AKC trainers and handlers have used her system for years,as have I.Good luck and give your girl a hug and pat for me.|`|3O6CTb3saa	Have u tried Science Diet foods they have several even ones for tender tummies.  Have u had his stools checked?  Because loose stools could be several things.  Parvo, worms; intestinal problems, or the actual food.  Kaopectate works great to help with diarrhea and an upset  stomach for dogs too.  You give 5 cc or 1 tsp.  3-4 times a day.

Don't be concerned about the cat "smacking" the dog. It very well may have been play, which is harmless. If it wasn't play, it was discipline, and the puppy was being taught a lesson in animal manners.<br>  <br>  <br>  ETA - My cat regularly "hits" my dog for behaving obnoxiously.

FeLV is also found in tears, nasal secretions and urine from infected cats, but this is much less likely to be a source of infection to another cat than saliva. Blood is another source of infection so all blood should be screened.<br>  Two to four weeks after infection the cat may be off-colour and run a temperature. This may be so slight as to be unnoticeable. After he recovers from this there are no further signs for a period of time - ranging from a few weeks to five years. When (and if ) signs do eventually develop, one third of the affected cats will develop tumours - either in the chest (thymus gland), bowel, lymph nodes, kidney, liver, spleen or bone marrow (true leukaemia). The remaining two-thirds develop a variety of other problems - anaemia, infertility, abortion and various infections due to the destruction of the cats natural immunity by the virus. These include Feline Infectious Peritonitis (FIP),Toxoplasmosis, Feline Infectious Anaemia and various chronic infections, such as gingivitis, skin infections and flu. Since all these conditions can cause a variety of symptoms and all the symptoms could be caused by other diseases, feline leukaemia can only be diagnosed by a blood test.<br>  <br>  the virus is actually very difficult to pass on to other adult cats. Simple precautions like separate feeding dishes and cleaning the litter tray out as soon as it has been used are sensible.<br>  If the infected cat is one of a multi-cat household, the others may either carry the virus or have Virus Neutralising antibodies, which means they are immune (this is very likely if they are all adults) or if they have no intimate contact with the infected cat, they may have neither. Remember, the highest risk of infection is to the kitten under 4 months.<br>  <br>  Difficult not to complicate it! hope it helps xx|`|GVaf1pejaa	Feline leukemia is caused by a coronavirus, specifically feline leukemia virus (FeLV). Its a pretty complicated disease but some of the symptoms include anemia, anorexia, depression, weight loss, and nervous systems problems.  Vomiting and diarrhea are also seen sometimes. Lymphoma is pretty commonly associated with the disease as well.  Remember, in cats, leukemia is a contagious disease--not so in humans.  Vaccination can prevent this disease as well...

zqVDJxUIaa	Bettas build their bubble nest naturally, you can't force them to.<br>  <br>  You'll need a tank, a 50w submersible heater (anything larger may cook them!), a sponge filter (turned off during the actual spawning process), and lots of plants. You may use either live or plastic plants, but live plants work better. They keep the water cleaner while the filter is turned off, as well as culturing infusoria to serve as the first food for the fry. I use Java moss and find it works the best for hiding, and the density is perfect. For a bubble-nest site, a Styrofoam cup cut in half (resembling an airplane hangar) works well. You need a tightly sealing lid for the top of the tank, as Betta fry need the air and water temperatures to be the same in order to properly develop the labyrinth organ (common to the family Anabantidae). Set the heater to 80 degrees F - no more, no less. Start this process about a week before the proposed spawn date in order to balance and stabilize the temperature. The pH and water hardness are not really critical to bettas, just the temperature. Have a container (such as a glass lantern chimney) to put the female in, so that the male can see her but can't get at her. Place this near the spawn site, but not touching the Styrofoam nest site. <br>  When the male gets used to the tank (allow at least a week), then you can expect him to start recognizing the female, and he will build a bubble nest, and then you can release the female.<br>  In response to the first comment, DON"T PUT HOUSEHOLD CHEMICALS IN YOUR TANK! Whoever wrote that must have never graduated from kindergarten.<br>  Good Luck!|`|dB3Gu0Ypaa	put your female's tank bye his tank and you probably know the best|`|dE5fs9yzaa	he's had a long trip and you want him to immediately want to breed?

Than you can find out from the owners where the animal is to be buried and you get that all ready too.  This way the funeral can proceed directly to the grave after the viewing (I can't believe I'm typing this :0) ).  Than you have someone set up food and drinks for the after funeral gathering.

This versatile hunting breed comes in three colors – yellow, black and chocolate – and because of his aptitude to please his master they excel as guide dogs for the blind, as part of search-and-rescue teams or in narcotics detection with law enforcement.<br>  <br>  A Look Back<br>  Labrador Retrievers, originally from Newfoundland, were initially used in work alongside fisherman, helping to pull in nets and catch fish that escaped from fishing lines. After being crossed with Setters, Spaniels and other Retrievers, the Labrador Retriever honed its skills as a true retriever. From this point in the breed’s history, "Labs," as they are affectionately called, were bred primarily to perform as an efficient retriever of game, with a stable temperament suitable for a variety of activities beyond hunting.<br>  <br>  Right Breed for You?<br>  An ideal sporting and family dog, the Labrador Retriever thrives as part of an active family or as a trusted hunting companion. A double-coated breed which sheds seasonally, regular grooming keeps his coat at its water-resistant best. Because of his even temperament and trainability millions of Americans own a Labrador Retriever as a pet. <br>  <br>  General Appearance<br>  The Labrador Retriever is a strongly built, medium-sized, short-coupled, dog possessing a sound, athletic, well-balanced conformation that enables it to function as a retrieving gun dog; the substance and soundness to hunt waterfowl or upland game for long hours under difficult conditions; the character and quality to win in the show ring; and the temperament to be a family companion. Physical features and mental characteristics should denote a dog bred to perform as an efficient Retriever of game with a stable temperament suitable for a variety of pursuits beyond the hunting environment.<br>  <br>  The most distinguishing characteristics of the Labrador Retriever are its short, dense, weather resistant coat; an "otter" tail; a clean-cut head with broad back skull and moderate stop; powerful jaws; and its "kind," friendly eyes, expressing character, intelligence and good temperament.<br>  <br>  Above all, a Labrador Retriever must be well balanced, enabling it to move in the show ring or work in the field with little or no effort. The typical Labrador possesses style and quality without over refinement, and substance without lumber or cloddiness. The Labrador is bred primarily as a working gun dog; structure and soundness are of great importance.<br>  <br>  Size, Proportion and Substance<br>  Size--The height at the withers for a dog is 22? to 24? inches; for a ***** is 21? to 23? inches. Any variance greater than ? inch above or below these heights is a disqualification. Approximate weight of dogs and bitches in working condition: dogs 65 to 80 pounds; bitches 55 to 70 pounds.<br>  <br>  The minimum height ranges set forth in the paragraph above shall not apply to dogs or bitches under twelve months of age.<br>  <br>  Proportion--Short-coupled; length from the point of the shoulder to the point of the rump is equal to or slightly longer than the distance from the withers to the ground. Distance from the elbow to the ground should be equal to one half of the height at the withers. The brisket should extend to the elbows, but not perceptibly deeper. The body must be of sufficient length to permit a straight, free and efficient stride; but the dog should never appear low and long or tall and leggy in outline. Substance--Substance and bone proportionate to the overall dog. Light, "weedy" individuals are definitely incorrect; equally objectionable are cloddy lumbering specimens. Labrador Retrievers shall be shown in working condition well-muscled and without excess fat.<br>  <br>  Head<br>  Skull--The skull should be wide; well developed but without exaggeration. The skull and foreface should be on parallel planes and of approximately equal length. There should be a moderate stop--the brow slightly pronounced so that the skull is not absolutely in a straight line with the nose. The brow ridges aid in defining the stop. The head should be clean-cut and free from fleshy cheeks; the bony structure of the skull chiseled beneath the eye with no prominence in the cheek. The skull may show some median line; the occipital bone is not conspicuous in mature dogs. Lips should not be squared off or pendulous, but fall away in a curve toward the throat. A wedge-shape head, or a head long and narrow in muzzle and back skull is incorrect as are massive, cheeky heads. The jaws are powerful and free from snippiness-- the muzzle neither long and narrow nor short and stubby. Nose-- The nose should be wide and the nostrils well-developed. The nose should be black on black or yellow dogs, and brown on chocolates. Nose color fading to a lighter shade is not a fault. A thoroughly pink nose or one l|`|I4vPxh3jaa	1.

Labs are really high strung and need a lot of attention and training since they are meant to be working dogs - hunters/retrievers.  Labs are sweet too but again I need to stress that they need A LOT of attention and room to run or a regular exercise regimen.  My neighbor had "rescued" a chocolate lab from the humane society and left him tied up outside all the time and he kept getting loose until one day he ran away and was never seen again.  Labs are not a dog that can entertain themselves.  They suffer from separation anxiety, boredom, they dig huge holes, they chew on things when left with only themselves for company.  If you have the time and you have the room and you have the energy for a lab I would recommend finding a rescue shelter and see if they have one that they have been working with - saves you some time and saves a life.  Some good names that I have heard are cocoa, jazzie, tobi, tank, it really depends on the dog you get.  Good luck and be sure to think long and hard before getting a dog that active.  Dogs are forever family members and cannot be forgotten when you get too busy.|`|yQSu7v22aa	Yes they definitely do shed!!!  Labs are generally well known for having great temperaments and are great family dogs but as with any dog they require training.  My last dog was a lab and they require a lot of exercise, a four hour hike up the hills never used to tire him.

4045eeb32c4ef2d7acd08239fb1eff37aa	It's already serious.  If your animal is in pain you have to look at in the terms of "would I want to feel like this without treatment."  If money is the issue you may want to contact the SPCA or a local vet and explain your circumstances.  They may even have a payment plan for you.  SPCA will probably take the animal if you can't afford treatment.  Too bad, and I'm sorry to hear about this.  I know I would be stressed if something happened to my little guys.  Just make the call, and please don't leave your little one in distress...rats especially do very poorly under stressful times as they will have trouble "calming down."|`|6HhO1Evfaa	Even though taking them to the vet might be expensive, calling the vet does not cost much if anything.

I would really suggest it, but trust me, I know that 500 sounds and is a lot. Rats have a high pain tolerance, so she may keep moving around and eating and such.... that GOOD! Her leg will eventually heal, and it will probably be crooked or she will always have a limp... that's just how it works. <br>  <br>  My only other thought is, are you sure it's broken? Will she let you handle it (be gentle!) if she will, and this happened in the last twelve hours, wrap 1 ice cube in a towel and apply it gently to her leg for a minute every 15 minutes to keep the swelling down... don't just hold it on longer, it will chill her...<br>  <br>  Her leg could possibly be dislocated (I can't know unless I see) in which case she won't ever use it again properly unless you take her to the vet to get it popped back into place.<br>  <br>  Sorry, thats the best I can do! <br>  <br>  BTW... Make sure your friends know that they really really hurt your ratter and lock her up from now on.

Your best and safest bet is to have the vet do fecal tests on the kittens (he may not have to test them all) to see what parasites they have and to give the right medicine in the correct dosage to get rid of them.  The mom will need to be checked and treated as well.  It's never a good idea to try homemade vetting especially when young kittens are involved.

I also recommend calling people who own English mastiff owners in your area to see if they know of anyone who needs to find a new home for their mastiff.<br>  <br>  Good luck!<br>  <br>  Haley|`|hRikwc00aa	You should not breed any dogs unless they achieve a champion title in the show ring (or a similar working title) and complete all genetic health tests. There are so many unwanted dogs - 3 to 4 million euthanized in shelters each year in the US - that you should not be breeding unless your dog (and the female) are excellent examples of the breed.<br>  <br>  Your dog doesn't need a companion - he'll do fine by himself. But if YOU want another mastiff, look for a rescue or reputable breeder in your area. Unless your dog is show-quality and you plan to go into conformation with him, get both dogs fixed to prevent unwanted puppies.|`|FdcWPp48aa	Sounds like you would have the perfect situation to adopt from a breed rescue.  There are many out there looking for homes.  Of course it will be spayed when you adopt, but we really don't need any more dogs in the world.  So open your heart and your home to a rescue mastiff looking for a loving home.|`|a4NCKYyZaa	Check out CraigsList.  There are always people trying to re-home their big dogs.  Honestly, the shelter or rescue may not work for you.  Adult dogs don't always get along...and breaking up 2 mastiffs is not easy.  There is nothing wrong with finding a puppy, don't let people make you feel guilty.  I have 4 mastiffs and 2 kids and I couldn't imagine bringing an adult dog into my home, especially if they are intact.  It's asking for problems.  Maybe if you could bring her home and see how she behaves with your male it would work, but what if there are alpha issues that arise later?  Not every dog is meant to be with other dogs!  Also, mastiffs can have some serious health issues, if you go to a shelter be aware that you do not know their lineage (very, very important for health and temperament) or their issues.  This can be dangerous if you have kids.  Also, being a Champion means NOTHING (and I do have a champion) the top winning ***** of all time, Iron Hills Ivana, has DJD (many say this isn't genetic (especially those with Ivana in their own lines), but OFA says it is.  Who are you going to listen to?).  The judge has no idea of the health of each dog.  They only judge what they can see.  Do your research and make the choice that is right for you!  Good Luck!|`|16XpYCBmaa	Maybe look in a dog shelter to see if any are in there and they can always use a good home. Or maybe find a good breeder somewhere.|`|PU3ynPsdaa	yeah,i would like an easy couple of grand if somene wants to part with a british bulldog female.

EQvAbyvcaa	All horses need and deserve a balanced trim on their hooves.  The breed is irrelevant.  A knowledgeable farrier will trim each foot individually and correctly for that horse and it has nothing to do with standards, and angles and old archaic sentiments about how to to special things to different types of horses )(ie gaited vs trotting, etc.) which is now known to be archaic nonsense.   Relax, if you have enlisted the assistance of of good farrier, he will be able to do the right thing for your horses.|`|5i8lDbXfaa	Are your horses barefoot or shod?<br>  <br>  My farrier just gives my horse a natural barefoot trim, really a barefoot horse should go by the natural angle.  A set angle degree may or may not work on all horses.  Get references from other boarders, see how they like the farrier.  A good farrier will understand your concerns for your horses gait, so just be kind an honest with him.|`|QpElKY8Kaa	My Certified Master Farrier breeds and shows Paso Finos.  Unless they are 'shod up' for shows and Paso's are not, they are handled like any other horse.

3bf821ff353c216ffc93ff7a91b60828aa	Fish tb can be transmitted to humans if you have an open sore.  It's not the same tb humans get, but can cause a nasty skin rash, and if left untreated and it gets into your blood stream can cause septic shock.  <br>  <br>  Are far as the others you mentioned, no they're not zoonotic.  I've never researched thoroughly, but have wondered about other stuff like rarer nematodes and trematodes and such.  But, I suppose even if it was possible, it's fairly rare since not much out there about that happening.  Only cases I've ever read about was fish tb, which is rare as well.  Just use common sense, don't put your arms/hands in the tank if you have open sores, and wash your hands afterwards with soap and water.<br>  <br>  Dropsy is a condition, not a disease.  Humans do get dropsy, we do swell up/bloat as well.  As far as that being passed on from fish, I don't see that.  Dropsy has numerous causes from kidney failure, internal bacteria/parasite infections, poor water quality, etc. etc.  Not something transmitted to people.<br>  <br>  EDIT:  Just pulled up this article looking for something else, apparantly they're saying some MRSA staph infections can be transmitted that way as well.  The problem I have with that one though, how do they figure out exactly where it came from, since that is everywhere=your house, outside, the stores, your nose, etc.  <br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.aquarticles.com/articles/management/Lawler_Tank_Safety.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.aquarticles.com/articles/mana...</a><br>  <br>  <br>  .|`|yIDHT8wcaa	i would'nt say so but you may get the fish parasites if you stupidy drink or bath in the infected aquarium water but other than that i would say no you will be fine just don't lick your hand after its been in the aquarium lol don't worry you'll be fine|`|zqVDJxUIaa	No, aquarium parasites cannot survive out of the water.<br>  There is no need to worry if you touch an ich protozoan, they will die shortly after the come in contact with the air.|`|bDPVRtCNaa	I know that I read something about this in one of my aquarium books. <br>  <br>  ~The following quote is taken from "My Aquarium" written by Ulrich Schliewen.<br>  <br>  "Note: Be sure to wear rubber gloves because dropsy can cause relatively harmless but very persistent skin diseases in people.

5TCewPYRaa	If it is a nice looking nylon halter--not faded or tattered in anyway...and you will need a lead line with a chain on it---<br>  <br>  If you can get a leather halter and lead, I would definitely go with that, but I showed in little 4-H shows when I was younger with a nice nylon halter and lead...and I neve got docked..it depends on the judge<br>  <br>  For showmanship, as long as you can complete the pattern near flawlessly and you are holding the lead in the proper places, they probably wont even care about your halter type...<br>  <br>  For halter, as long as it fits nicely and compliments the horse's head, you will be a-okay with it!<br>  <br>  Good luck, if you decide to get more competitive with halter and showmanship definitely get leather, but for a fun local show--don't bother unless you really want to!<br>  <br>  Have fun!<br>  BB|`|bI7wMCJXaa	Even if you're allowed to use a nylon halter - which you aren't, check the USEF rules - the other people using nice leather halters will score above you every time. When doing halter and showmanship you are standing there with your horse doing your absolute best to make the judge think you take pride in yours and your horse's appearance and you aren't wasting the judge's time. Nothing says sloppy like a nylon halter or dirty clothes, etc.<br>  <br>  Just so you know different breed classes have specific requirements for what type of halter you can use so you should probably read up on the rules.|`|ejj2N3uaaa	In halter, they're really supposed to judge your horse's conformation/movement, not appearance (in terms of presentation). However, a nice halter can help promote a good horse.<br>  <br>  In showmanship, showing in nylon may get points deducted from your score. However, since it's a small local show, you may see plenty of people doing it. If that's typical for this show, don't worry about it, but if it's a bigger show or if you know people usually show in leather, I'd at least find a cheap leather halter (even if it's not with silver) to use. But no one will stop you from showing in nylon.|`|8Rn2pX4jaa	I would get a nice leather halter and lead.  It doesn't have to be fancy with lots of silver and you can find them quite affordably on Ebay or online websites.  It is worth the investment and the judge will take you more seriously than if you show up with a nylon halter and lead.  I hate to say that judges are that shallow, but if you are tied with another person who has appropriate attire, they are going to get the edge.<br>  <br>  Oh... but if you are showing english you can use your english bridle.<br>  <br>  Good Luck!|`|uVBrBGh1aa	growing up when i showed halter classes,  i showed saddlebred and arabians,  they both are supposed to use special show halters, but we usually showed them in their full bridles.  (double bit / fancy show get-up bridle)  i dont know if that would work for you or not but we had winners in our barns using bridles not halters.  but in no way would i walk in the show ring with a nylon halter on my horse i dont care how small the show is.|`|boYZRfMdaa	It really depends on the circuit.  If you are showing in a breed association's circuit such as AQHA or APHA then no you can not use a regular halter.  I do believe that it is in the guidelines as well, but judges will take off because those classes are judged on appearance.  Because of this, if you are showing in an open circuit with no rule specifically telling you to use leather, than you should be fine.  If you are up against competition that are using nice halters and you believe that your horse is up to that horses level then definetely use a leather halter.  Obviously, if you know your horse has no chance against the only horse with a leather halter and its not due to the halter, than it would be wiser to not spend money on one.  It is a better idea to get one.  If you follow this link you can get nice show quality leather halters for around $50!! I have one and love it.  It might not be top notch, but it works and the judges can't tell. <br>  <br>  These halters range from $60 - $80! And sometimes they have big sales!

3giaPYe8aa	I have a friend who has a ton of experience with many breeds of dogs.  She has a Cattle Dog and says it's the best dog she has ever had, but this breed is NOT for someone to have as just a pet.  It NEEDS to work or it will literally go insane.  I suggest you stick with a Lab.|`|JiCKFTuIaa	I have/had both for many years, and they are as different as night and day, so you still have a lot of research ahead of you.<br>  Since you have already had Labs you know what to expect. If you get a Heeler you are in for quite a surprise because they in no way act the same as a lab.<br>  My heeler came from working lines, and to him people were just another kind of cow that needed to be herded into the back of the cattle truck.

If you are looking for a cheap dog, i suggest you go to a rescue or spca and look for a small breed dog. No dogs are cheap, they all come with responsibilities and a long bill on shots, food, toys, cleaning, and any unexpected suprises such as injuries and special meds.

It may make you feel better but your dog is going to grieve longer.<br>  <br>  I am so sorry you lost a wonderful friend.  And I am concerned about your dog.  If she does not eat within a few days run her to the vet.  Get her checked out and see what your vet says.<br>  <br>  Blessed be.|`|YXywKp6Caa	Get another dog. I've gone through this.

Either way worked out alright for us.|`|araQhbkpaa	we went through this with my horse...<br>  i know not the same animal but we just acted like normal and did not change the schudle.

EJpiaCMQaa	If your bird has a respiratory infection, it is possible it can spread to the other bird.  This doesn't mean the other bird will automatically become infected, too.  It all depends on the source of the illness.  Many pet birds with a respiratory illness aren't contagious.  I've had budgies with respiratory illnesses, and no other budgies or finches caught the respiratory disease of the ill budgie.  Respiratory infections are bacterial, not viral, and are less likely to spread.  If your other canary is in good health, there's a good chance it won't become ill.  <br>  <br>  Pox virus, which is common in canaries and finches, is more contagious.  This virus can attack the upper respiratory system.  A vaccine is available for avian pox virus.<br>  <br>  Read this link for more information:<br>  <a href="http://www.santaclarapethospital.com/722698.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.santaclarapethospital.com/722...</a><br>  <br>  When you have the appointment with your vet, you can discuss this topic in further detail with your vet.|`|bdw142rSaa	yes. they can spread the virus by sneezing, food and water cups etc.
Yerwit5Aaa	Aww, thats cho cute. Ive always wanted a hamster or a mouse or a tinny lil furry creature like that. Instead ive got two dogs and a cat. =) <br>  <br>  Anyway, I dunno what a hamster might consider fun. Maybe you could try making a maze out out of cardboard or something..so she could find her way out. Ive heard mice like doing that. <br>  <br>  My cat actually 'fetches' a ball made of crumpled paper. See if your hamster might enjoy chasing things. then you could get a tiny ball or something. <br>  <br>  Good luck.
yczfFQXmaa	Some cats will do this when they're trying to tell you something.  Perhaps you've been gone more often or are not paying her enough attention?  She may also not like the type of litter she's getting or the location of the litter box.  If you can't find some pattern as to why this is happening, I'd talk to the vet.  Sometimes litter box issues are medical, but if the poo looks normal, I'm guessing it's your cat rebelling and the solution is to figure out why.|`|4TX26viFaa	The sewer odors from the drain can waft up enough to let the cat know there's sewage down there, which encourages them.  <br>  <br>  Try leaving 1/2" of water in the tub, or use a plug in the drain to stop the odors.|`|Yg2iIneKaa	she feels cooler in the tub.

So the cat uses the tub where it's cool to do the do.|`|Rw7gi86Naa	There are so many possible reasons for a cat to stop using the litter box that it's hard to cover them all. The first reason you need to rule out is a bladder/urinary tract infection, or constipation. You will need to take kitty to the vet to get checked out. Has the litter box been cleaned properly? Have you moved it to a different location? Have you recently changed anything such as brand of litter, litter box or food? Have you used any new disinfectants in the box? Has someone new come into your house that s/he didn't seem to like? Any new pets? Even new carpets or furniture can cause this. <br>  <br>  Here are some suggestions to your litter box problems:<br>  - Provide a box for each cat <br>  - Provide constant access to a box <br>  - Go back to previously used brand of litter and/or <br>  - Discontinue new disinfectant <br>  - Move box to where it was previously used <br>  - Eliminate new or frightening noise near litter box <br>  - Move food and water away from litter box <br>  - If cat is only going in one spot, put the litter box at the exact location and gradually move it back to where you want it at the rate of one foot per day <br>  - If there are several places, try putting dishes of cat food in those areas to discourage further elimination there <br>  - Experiment with different textures of litter, (cats prefer sandy litter) <br>  - Use a covered litter box for cats that stand in box but eliminate outside of it <br>  - Keep in mind that some cats are rather picky, and prefer to have two separate boxes, (one to pee in and one to poop in).<br>  <br>  Problems arise when your cat doesn't like or develops an aversion to the litter box that you have provided. There is absolutely no reason to expect every cat to like the same material, or even for one cat to prefer the same material over an entire life span. If your cat is having litter box problems then you will need to figure out how to make the litter box appealing to the cat. Here are a few options: <br>  1) Pain or illness can cause a cat to stop using the litter box. Cats are very adept at hiding illness, so if your cat is having litter box problems then the first thing you need to do is take the cat to a vet for a medical exam. <br>  2) If you aren't scooping the waste out of the litter every day then you need to start and start now. <br>  3) Perfumes or other odors can drive your cat away from the litter box. Scented litters are unacceptable to many cats, and the leftover scent from a cleaning product could also be a problem. Get rid of the perfumes, and scrub those cleaners away before giving the box back to the cat. Remember that cats have an acute sense of smell. <br>  4) Your cat may feel vulnerable when in the litter box. Is it in a noisy location, (such as next to the washing machine). Is it secure from little marauders like dogs and children, or even other cats? If the box is not semi-private, move it to a better location.<br>  5) Remember those preferences that we talked about earlier. You may need to offer several different types of litter before finding the right one. Strange but true, some cats will not use the same box for urine and feces, in which case you'll have to provide two boxes. The type of box could also be a problem. If the box has a cover, try removing it. <br>  6) Anxiety can lead to litter box lapses. Did some event scare your cat? This could be anything from a new couch to a new cat or even a new person in the house. If you suspect anxiety, confine the cat to a safe and secure place, (maybe a bed room) until the anxiety has passed. Cats seem to hang on to their emotions, so the anxiety could last much longer than the actual event. No need to rush, leave that safe haven available to the cat for as long as possible. <br>  7) If you have multiple cats, chances are you'll need multiple boxes, maybe even with different materials in them. <br>  There is one more important distinction that you'll need to make. Is the cat refusing to use the litter box, or is the cat spraying? Spraying is a territorial behavior and has nothing to do with disliking the box. For more information on litter box problems or spraying, consult with a trained behaviorist.<br>  <br>  Correcting the Problem <br>  The key to solving elimination problems is to make the litter box more attractive, and the area where the cat is soiling instead, unattractive. Sometimes, just cleaning the litter box more frequently or changing its location will correct the problem. Other times, you may need to experiment with different combinations of location and kitty litter to find a solution. You may even want to offer your cat the choice of several different boxes, each with different kinds of litter, to see which he or she prefers. At the same time, you must break the cat's habit of soiling in the new location. Be sure to clean the soiled area thoroughly with a pet odor remover to get rid of any urine scent -- or your cat may be attracted back to the same spot. It's important to keep the cat away from the area. Try covering the spot with carpet runner, prickly side up, or|`|uoLrp5mnaa	I don't know, our cat does the same thing, but she stopped after we started keeping the bathroom doors shut.

They are just as entertaining.|`|igxpy62Raa	I would personally go with pet rats. Many people may cringe at the thought of a rat for a pet, but they actually amazing pets that will even bond to you from day one. Interactive and affectionate, rats are considered by most enthusiasts as one of the best species of small pet. They are highly social creatures, so housing them in pairs or small groups is required.<br>  <br>  A ten-gallon tank will fit up to 1 syrian (teddy bear, black bear, etc, these names are false) hamster, 4 dwarf hamsters, 6 pet mice, 3 gerbils, or 2 rats.<br>  <br>  Good luck with whatever you choose!|`|FMcu6BNpaa	I think you should get a syrian (teddy bear, golden, fancy, ect.). They can ONLY live alone! Don't put two together they will fight until one of them dies. They are really sweet. They don't bite as often as dwarf hamsters do. But there bites can draw blood, but they rarely bite unless VERY terribly frightened. I prefer them because hamsters are so cute and Syrians are super sweet.|`|VOIs9Kxqaa	I personally love dwarf hamsters. they're so friendly and tame, and you can have a group in a single cage. they're adorable and cute, and come in a large variety of colours (the campbell's anyways). I use to bred them and they were so tame and friendly it was amazing. they also get around better in the "tube" cages since they don't get stuck. Most people don't like them, but then again, most people buy infriendly petstore ones.

Also, it looks like her nail needs a trim.|`|P2yRAWiJaa	It looks like either a skin allergy or mange.<br>  <br>  See if you can go to a different vet and ask for a skin scrape.|`|Mf2f7uU9aa	could be a food allergy, do you keep switching her food?|`|jwIdq5qkaa	My chi gets those same marks on her ears if she goes outside and stays to long. Usually she will come back in sneezing. I think its just an allergy but if it didn't go a way, I would go to another vet and ask for a skin scrape. My dogs usually last a while since she loves being outside but they don't bother her so I don't let it bother me to much. If it gets worse though I'd be concerned.<br>  *Edit* I just reread the ? and saw she's had these sores for over 1 month I would get a second opinion from a vet. To be sure nothing was wrong. See if you could get a skin scrape it may just be an allergy she is around a lot but better safe than sorry.
fU06Qre9aa	Scruffing her is a good start, but I wouldn't tap her nose.  It can lead her to believe that hands are going to tap at her face, and it may lead to more defensive biting.  Assuming your ferret isn't deaf, a firm "NO" might be better.  When you scruff her, make her lay on her side and gently drag her a short distance on the floor.  This is what the mother ferret would do, and may help her understand that you don't like what she's doing.<br>  <br>  Trying to figure out why she bites may also help.  For example, if she's biting you when you're holding her, she probably wants to get down.  In that case, you wouldn't want to let her down right away when she bites, so that she doesn't associate biting to getting her way.  If she's biting you out of fear, giving her treats like Ferretone out of your hand may help her associate your hands with positive things.  Since you just got her and she was at the pet store before (so probably not handled much before), she probably just doesn't realize that human skin isn't as tough as ferret skin, so the scruff, "NO", and gentle drag method will probably work.<br>  <br>  If you don't already have it, I highly suggest getting "Ferrets for Dummies".  It's a great resource.  Also, the Ferret Mailing List has lots of ferret knowledgeable folks and some great discussion.  You can subscribe at <a href="http://ferretmailinglist.org/index.html." rel="nofollow">http://ferretmailinglist.org/index.html.</a>|`|05805cd7f8ba800b6b1e4c9525a624bcaa	I got these from <a href="http://www.ferretcentral.org" rel="nofollow">http://www.ferretcentral.org</a><br>  <br>  "    *  If the ferret is biting too hard in play, try using a signal he already understands: a high-pitched "Yip!" (or "Hey!" or whatever), like the noise one kit makes when another is playing too roughly. On the other hand, if the ferret seems to interpret that as a sign of weakness, switch to a deep, commanding voice and act as stern as you can.<br>      * Stopping the game by gently pinning the ferret down until he gets bored can work well, too.<br>      * Confining the misbehaving ferret to a cage and ignoring him for a few minutes can be very effective, especially if there's another ferret wandering around conspicuously having fun.<br>      * You can cover your hands with Bitter Apple, either the spray or the paste, so nipping tastes bad.<br>      * Some people have had good luck with either pushing a finger into the ferret's mouth (sideways, behind the back teeth) or holding the mouth open from behind (being careful not to choke the ferret) immediately after a bite. Most ferrets find either of these uncomfortable, and it associates the unpleasant feeling with the taste of finger.<br>      * If you need the ferret to let go, try covering both his nostrils with your fingers. If he still hangs on, don't keep them there long, though.<br>      * If the ferret isn't one of those who absolutely hate to be scruffed, that can help. You might also shake the ferret gently by the scruff, or drag him along the floor while you hiss. Both these mimic the way mother ferrets reprimand their kits. Obviously, don't be so rough that you hurt him. You can also cover his face with your hand, which he probably won't like.

PM23RDycaa	They won't be because the breed clubs who dictate the standard will never go for it. Its not just the health of the pups but the female dog as well. From the ethical breeder standpoint it is ill advised to breed a female under 4lbs. There is no reason for a second, third or in some cases 4th size class for any of these breeds. Every breed that has been downsized was downsized with a purpose in mind.<br>  <br>  Toy poodle - entertainment in the circus AND flea control for the nobility. Those hugs powdered wigs were a flea magnet. Lapdogs came about in most of Europe to attract the fleas away from their owners.<br>  <br>  Mini Dachshund - bred to go after vermin small than a badger which is what the standard size was bred to go after. <br>  <br>  The "teacup" size would not be beneficial to the breed or without its hazards. Too many females and litter would be lost for it to be worth trying.<br>  <br>  There is also the fact that many teacups reach full size of what the standard calls for anyways, so why bother?|`|tPGxPDvBaa	No they won't The breeds they are supposed to be in are already small/toy breeds. A toy is the only small size.|`|XagPxe7Faa	It's not likely at all.  Breed standards and what is accepted is not decided on by the AKC.  The standards are adopted from what is set by the parent breed clubs for each breed.  The parent clubs strive to preserve and promote the standard and they adamately work to eliminate the "teacup" hype.  They will not make exceptions for the breed in regards to issues that are detrimental to the health of the dogs.  So chances of it ever being accepted by the AKC are nil.|`|aCqSF87Raa	I don't think "teacup" would ever be accepted simply because the term is ridiculous and has a bad reputation. <br>  <br>  However it IS possible that in the future the AKC may accept miniature versions of other breeds. They've done it before - Schnauzers, Poodles, the Bull Terrier.... <br>  <br>  However it would take centuries of carefully breeding specially selected stock: genetic testing, excellent behavior, careful bloodline selection, and so forth. They would probably require the size difference to be minimal - not drastic - and would require examinations done to prove that making the breed smaller won't affect the breed as a whole.<br>  <br>  That being said i doubt they would accept "Miniature Chihuahuas" because the dogs are small enough and it's simply unhealthy to continue decreasing their size.  However i wouldn't be surprised to see "Miniature Golden Retrievers" or the like many many years from now....|`|bPdqwkpPaa	It won't happen because no reputable breed club endorses the name.  New divisions within a breed are created with the recommendation of the breed club.  Every small dog breed club demonizes the 'teacup' label, so it's doubtful that it would ever be recognized. <br>  <br>  To me, it's not much different than a "puggle".  It's a term that's only used by puppy mills and backyard breeders as a marketing term, not as any type of advancement for the breed. <br>  <br>  Yes, it's also a health concern.  Similar to the reasons that white boxers are not allowed.  <br>  <br>  Many small breeds have NO larger sized counterparts.  A Yorkie must be under 7 lbs.  A Chihuahua?  6lbs. How much smaller do we need?  How much more detail do we need?|`|jxRiH2e9aa	There is no such thing as "tea cup" dogs. Teacups are get an advertising scam, trying to get people to buy the runts of the litter. Runts are the runts because they are small, the bottom pack, the last ones to eat from mom. This means that they are more prone to health problems, and are more frail in general.<br>  <br>  Not to mention, when you try to make dogs "smaller" things tend to go badly. Health problems, organ failure, it's really quite terrible.<br>  <br>  So, of course, the AKC does not accept them.|`|qgeI6Chxaa	Since teacups are still purebred, they are allowed to be registered with the AKC. Dogs that don't fit the breed standard are often still registrable. <br>  <br>  The AKC will almost certainly not, however, recognize teacups as an acceptable variant of their breed, or as a different breed entirely. The biggest reason for this is that breed clubs all oppose breeding teacup versions of their breed. Since no reputable breeder will produce them, there is no one lobbying the AKC to allow them.|`|iIGOi2Idaa	Well I hope not, any Kennel Club would have really gone to the dogs if they decided to recognise runts as a breed! It would be like deciding 'cross breeds' are a legitimate breed. I mean, what the hell would the standards be? The only thing crazier would be to start calling dogs new breeds if they had specific health problems - which is basically what teacups are!<br>  <br>  Chalice|`|45ac5d768301b8709c6f83d194c24b6daa	No..."Teacup" breeds actually have a shorter lifespan due to their size. Teacup dogs have more health problems as they were never intended to be "teacup" size.|`|mNBhYBAfaa	teacup dogs aren't a breed, they are a fashion accessory and i think its crap. total crap.|`|KuUx34hCaa	call & ask the A.K.C.|`|8584e0329fb17c662606d5a6a8650ee2aa	I doubt it.  Most of the dogs bred as "teacups" are already toy breed dogs and their standards call for specific sizes for these dogs.  The poodle was bred down from a working dog to be a companion toy dog.  There is no reason to breed a small companion dog any smaller.  There is also the consideration that these extra small dogs come with big health problems so there is no good reason to sanction the breeding of them.<br>  <br>  Frankly if people want something smaller than a 4 lb. chihuahua, they should just get a hamster.<br>  <br>  EDIT -  As a golden retriever owner, I hope to never see a "miniature" golden.  The goldens are the way they are is because they were selectively bred to work for people, originally as a gun dog and later for other jobs.  There are lots of wonderful small companion breeds with lovely temperaments, (my sister has  Cavalier King Charles Spaniels for example) there is no good reason to attempt such a breeding program.  To do so would require crossing goldens with other smaller breeds (that's how toy poodles came about many many generations ago) and I think that would fundamentally change the breed and not for the better.|`|t2M1kXY4aa	There are lots of reasons why AKC will never accept "teacups", but the one that comes to my mind first is almost obvious, if you think about it.<br>  <br>  Showing in conformation costs quite a bit of money.  The so-called "breeders" of the so-called "teacups" aren't interested in SPENDING money on their dogs.  To the contrary.  They only want to MAKE money.<br>  <br>  The "teacups" don't have recognized "breed clubs" or an established "breed standard".  The "teacup breeders" don't meet AKC's standards for ethical breeding.<br>  <br>  Even if AKC could overlook all the health problems caused by intentionally poor breeding (and it won't),  the organization will never accept these dogs as breeds because they are in no way an improvement on the already-existing breeds from which they are derived.

GSf09ALBaa	Oh, you just made my week!!!  Adopting an older dog!  Get out of here!<br>  That is so wonderful.  Okay, enough of that.  He looks like he is full of himself.  It says he is a little chunky so I would start out with walks before getting into too much else.  Get some of that weight off and he will feel better.  A 10 year old dog of this type is not an old dog by no means.  I would consider him to be in his 40's if he were human.  Terriers are fun, tenacious dogs.  You will seriously enjoy him.<br>  <br>  And don't worry about the picking him up.  I have several rescues that don't like it.  No big deal.<br>  <br>  As far as your younger cousins, please don't have them over until your guy gets settled in.  Then you can slowly introduce them to him.  The kids need to be calm and quiet.  No jumping around, screaming.  This will put any dog in a state of anxiety which can cause them to become afraid.  <br>  <br>  Go on and get your dog and have a great time!|`|q9BItD25aa	He looks exactly like my dog Cotton who I adopted last September from the shelter in Tampa Florida. My dog is 2 yrs. old and being part terrier she loves to chase squirrels and small lizards. She is very active and can't be left alone as she has seperation anxiety. Your dog, being 10 will probably be pretty mellow. My dog refused to be picked up too. Good luck with the dog.|`|9Dxzvr4Paa	I also recently adopted a terrier mix from the pound so i hope i can help.<br>  <br>  My dog is pretty active but he is alot younger than yours. My guess it your dog will still be active and able to run but he might get tired sooner. So yes he should be able to run and play<br>  <br>  For your next question whether he likes to be picked up i think depends on the dog. Since he is from the pound. when you first get him he will be shy and not want to be picked up. A little while after that he should warm up to you and let you pick him up. Just spend a lot of time with him petting him and stuff like that :-) My dog also doesn't like new people right when he meets them.<br>  <br>  Other info: Terriers shed alot. Also my dog can be stubborn sometimes like he will run away from me and not want to bothered.( I dont know if that if normal for terriers or jsut my dog.) Sometimes he gets really scared of random things too but that might just be because I think he was abused beofre we got him.<br>  <br>  Overall i love my terrier and i think you will too and by the way the one you chose is adorable!!<br>  <br>  good luck and hope this helps!|`|hUHwf0hmaa	He's adorable.  Your little friend will probably be quite active - little dogs generally keep their springiness quite a long time.  I have a 10 year old Australian cattle dog, and he's still very active, runs faster than you've probably ever seen a dog run, and is one fiery pistol, even at 10+.  <br>  <br>  I also have a little rat terrier mix who's about 3.  We rescued him about 4 weeks ago.  He's the bomb, we love him.  He's very playful, funny personality, very active.  He has devised a game to play with our older dog.  We call it "Run Jack Run."  He (Jack) runs up and bumps Andy (our older dog) in the rear, and then runs like the wind.  Andy gives chase.  The more we egg them on (by shouting "Run, Jack, RUUUUUUUUN!!!!") the faster they go.  Usually, Jack disappears at some point, leaving Andy and us blinking and looking for him.  He then bursts out from behind a bush, or from inside the screen house we have at the back of our property, having hidden in there, and then the game resumes.<br>  <br>  Terrier mixes are funny, active, very sweet, and lots of fun.  My little guy doesn't really like to be picked up either.  he tolerates it but he doesn't love it.  Just keep him away from little bitty kids, and all should be well.|`|mfXDUkRYaa	Aww, he looks sweet. Good on you for adopting an older dog.<br>  <br>  Little terriers like that can live for aaaaages so I would reckon, as he is healthy, that he'd be pretty active, though probably not as active as when he was younger - which you might find fortunate! Terriers are typically very 'on the go' dogs but (as well as there always being exceptions) can be easily trained.<br>  <br>  Lots of dogs don't like being picked up.|`|2eJcaeOPaa	1.10yr olds can be active i have a staffy x collie who's nine i swear she still thinks she's a puppy<br>  it totally depends on the dog though. ask the shelter if he plays at all<br>  2.i would listen to what the shelter has to say in regards of him not being good with children after all they should know the dog and it is there profession<br>  3.

A 10yr dog willing be slowing down now but still needs to be active.  It is possible since he is kinda short legged & long back that he might have a slight back problem or arthritis   which would make him snippy from pain.  Terriers don't always like small kids with the quick movements & high voices, they use to hunting small fast prey & will strike out.  There is too much info on terriers to get specific esp. since he is a mix & can have any personality/traits.

YhH0PNupaa	Do you have an incubator, or is the hen broody?Sorry a little confused. <br>  If on day 12, you had veins and an air cell, you had a fertile egg. So they have been mating.

Good luck!|`|rQlzfHqraa	I think that once you see movement, a heart beating or veins you should let it continue incubating the full term.|`|227b14cb2ec949a2ecdd4ba7068ff421aa	Did you, or the chicken,  turn the eggs the first 18 days? If eggs are not turned, the embryo will die about Day 11.  If it doesn't hatch after 21 days it's dead. Good Luck!

3aqtw1dfaa	Actually, Siamese cats tend to get darker as they age. If she was really young when you got her, as she gets older it would be normal to have her "change colors" however, it isn't "normal" for a Siamese to only get darker in specific areas, but maybe because she is not pure-breed then maybe the combination of breeds caused the spots when her Siamese changed colors.|`|yczfFQXmaa	That happens as they get older.  It's the same as with children.  Often children's hair will darken or change color as they get older.  Cats can do the same thing.  It seems like their markings become pretty much set at about a year (also when they're pretty much done growing).  You may also notice graying when the cat gets old.  This happens to them the same as to people, except it seems to happen mostly around the face and I've never heard of one going totally gray.|`|iYzmnIsJaa	It's a genetic thing that is true for Siamese cats and Siamese mix cats.  You can look up articles on the internet.  Siamese cats are born white(it's nice and warm inside of mommy,) and as they are exposed to cooler temperatures they get darker, especially around the more exposed parts of their bodies ---  ears, tail area, face....Colorpointed areas.....Genetics related to their hair....As they get older they usually get darker because they've spent a longer time period getting exposure to colder climates.<br>  <br>  Read the section Description/Appearance<br>  <br>  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Siamese_(cat)" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Siamese_(ca...</a><br>  <br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.associatedcontent.com/article/1356210/siamese_cats_and_temperaturesensitive.html?cat=53" rel="nofollow">http://www.associatedcontent.com/article...</a>|`|AA11537248	Because it's a "Mood Cat".<br>  When it's relaxed, it's green.

84558de0349fa374ed3605ac33e8e36daa	I'm surprised he poops in his crate. Usually dogs don't go to the bathroom where they sleep. So he must have had to go really badly. Make sure he pees and poops before you leave for work. Then he should be alright. I just got a new puppy as well and he only poops in the monring and in the evening. How often do you feed your dog? <br>  But don't get frustrated. As he gets older he will be able to hold it longer. It sounds like he is already doing godd, by going straight to the pad when you take him out of the crate. Just keep on it. He will learn eventually. Be patient! <br>  Good luck!! :o)
26PPwzrWaa	Alabama: Yes the American Pit Bull terrier is a breed. It is accepted in the UKC. Canada banned pit bulls so they are not allowed there and the AKC wants nothing to do with their underserving rep so the revoked them too. <br>  <br>  In the UKC I believe you can register an amstaff as a pit bull terrier but the pit bull terrier can not be registered as an amstaff. Although it could be the complete opposite of what I just typed. I can not find my source for that since I am on a different computer. Although I know one of the breed clubs allows the other breed to be registered as that breed while the other one does not. I just cant remember which one does and which on doesnt.|`|VkFDAQ46aa	people mainly do that because the AKC doesnt recognize the American pitbull terrier. they will recognize the american staffys however. so alot of owners will register them as a staffy with the AKC and as an american pitbull terrier with others such as the UKC and the ADBA. there is a slight difference in the two, hard to explain on this post however.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  Added: as to the  remarks made by alabama cutie below to the american pitbull terrier not being a official breed, that is absolutely ridiculous and you should check your sources. The american pitbull terrier is in fact a combination of different breeds ( english bull dog and the old english terrier which is now extinct. however alot of dogs who are "officially purebred"  and recognized these also come from a mixture of different breeds as well.|`|a4eca20886ed5136a1b67933a28ef01baa	American Pitbull Terriers are not an official breed they are not pure blooded they are a mix of different breeds.  Meaning you could have two American Pitbull Terriers and one dog has Bulldog in him while the other also has Mastiff in him.  There are no breed standards.  While American Staffordshire Terriers are a registrable breed with regulations and standards.  They all have the same breeds mixed in.  <br>  <br>  Here is what I am meaning here are two pitbulls-<br>  <br>  <a href="http://bulldogbreeds.com/breeders/pics/bailey4_pitbulls.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://bulldogbreeds.com/breeders/pics/b...</a><br>  <br>  AND<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.pitbull-pictures.org/pictures-images-photos/pitbulls-pictures-06.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://www.pitbull-pictures.org/pictures...</a>|`|P2yRAWiJaa	Technically the same, but two different breeds.

zYDoACexaa	I agree with Mr. B.  When I was married, my male dog deferred to my husband as alpha and constantly challenged me.  I had to work with him consistently to acknowledge me as his superior - especially when my husband was around.  Neutering also made him less aggressive (not saying that your dog is being aggressive) and he tended to challenge me less.  After the divorce, he stayed with me and deferred to me as the alpha dog without issue.  Definitely just need to work the alpha training.  Hope all goes well - and kudos for getting a rescue dog - so many dogs and so few good homes...|`|4444d48004267fc3c148eb176ef253d8aa	Why?  It's because your dog sees you as the pack leader, and her as second in command, and subordinate to you.<br>  <br>  At home your wife needs to practice some alpha exercises in your presence, but without you intervening.  Things like neck pinning and general obedience training will help, and your wife should take over feeding.  In regards to feeding, she should break up his meals into small bits at a time.  <br>  i.e.- At dinner time, instead of giving him his whole amount, she should give just 1/3 of it.  When he's eaten that, she should pick up the bowl and give a little more, and continue like that until finished.  She should also teach him to sit and stay while waiting for his food.<br>    <br>  Pick up a book on training and get her to teach him she is an alpha all the time, not just in your absence.|`|a839d39c81c2c929fe1d46e2ceb69bafaa	because he is confused as to who is the alpha and when both together he takes the roll as alpha.  My dog used to do the same until my husband adn I agreed on befor the walk or outing who would do the commands and who wouldn't. seemed to work great for us. But also we did a lot of one on one time. I use hand gestures while hubby uses verble, (Dooby our dogs name lol) will listen to my husband when outting, now he listens to both cus of the less confussion. if I were to hand gesture sit (snap fingers point down)before my husband spoke it he'd listen to me , htat and we have a 19 month old too so who ever is pushign the stroller the other is comanding the dog, works out but took a lot of time to get there. <br>  <br>  spread apart in the house and practices calling your dog to eachother and hope that helps?|`|S7x5TBx3aa	why what??|`|be58a957ec05b08ab61416f8ea457867aa	My guess would be that at some point your wife called the dog and he was busy sniffing and didn't respond so you called him or made him come (I see this all the time in training classes). He learned that when you are present he doesn't need to listen to her because she doesn't enforce commands, you do. This is simple to repair - your wife should practice the recall a lot when you are around but you should not get involved. When she calls him she needs to make sure that he comes to her. He will soon realize that he needs to listen to both of you regardless of who is around.|`|p7swtBYzaa	Who knows - are you angling for some sort of "wow, you're the alpha in the family" answer?<br>  Hey, if it makes you feel better -
H66RHumIaa	We like having a pet(s) because they keep you company. Pets are loyal. For example, I got this from a website...<br>  <br>   <br>  Do people like dogs? This question is easy to answer by looking at statistics that show dog owners behaviors. <br>  <br>  * There are 74 million owned dogs in the US. * The average is 1.8 dogs per household totaling over 41 million households. * 50 percent of dog owners buy Christmas gifts for their dogs. * 70 percent of dog owners call themselves mommy, daddy or parent to their dogs. * When household budgets are cut women are least likely to; give up manicures and reduce the quality of their dog's food to save money. <br>  <br>  Those of us who are among the 41 million dog owners do not find these statistics unusual. But have you ever thought seriously about what dogs actually do for people? Owing a pet can affect the quality of life at every stage of human development. <br>  <br>  Infant/Toddlers <br>  <br>  With the proper supervision pets enrich the environment of infants. By doing so children show; improved cognitive development, increased stimulation to their immune system (resulting in less dermatitis and allergies), and they learn compassion and responsibility toward animals. <br>  <br>  Pre-adolescent/Adolescents <br>  <br>  Adolescents show; increased self esteem, positive communication skills, and responsibility and compassion toward animals. Studies show improved social interactions and higher scores on empathy and pro-social scales. <br>  <br>  Adults/Middle-aged <br>  <br>  They offer companionship for single adults. For young adults they provide practice for parenting skills and they fill the empty nest loneliness by substituting for children in childless households. <br>  <br>  Seniors <br>  <br>  Aging seniors receive much needed companionship. They show greater independence while sustaining a purposeful life. Pets promote social interaction encouraging a more active life. <br>  <br>  Disabled/Disadvantaged <br>  <br>  Trained service dogs provide independence. They increase self esteem and provide a venue for social interaction improving social skills. For many they offer psychological stability. <br>  <br>  In addition there are many beneficial health effects that are related to having a close relationship with a pet: <br>  <br>  * Lower blood pressure * Lower cholesterol levels * Increase illness survival rate * Fewer doctor visits * Improved ability to cope with stress/illness/tragedy * Assistance in fighting depression * Minimizing tension between family members * Help prevent heart disease <br>  <br>  As you can see, this is why people like dogs...<br>  <br>  People like animals for different reasons. Some of us like them because we feel we can afford to be friendly to them and be their master. Our innate feeling of superiority makes us want to feel benevolent towards the animals, who are considered dumb and lovable.<br>  <br>  Then there are some of us who love animals because we look for some kind of unconditional affection and loyalty from someone. We do not usually find that kind of loyalty among our human friends. All of us usually have some motive or the other for everything we do in our lives, and so we turn to the animals.<br>  <br>  There are those who love animals simply because they are what they are. They have an innocence about them that is immediately appealing. The innocence is what draws us to them. They are beautiful creatures, without the corruption that the ability to think and discriminate brings to our minds. They love us irrespective of who we are, what we do, and how we act. That kind of acceptance is something we all yearn for, and that is what draws us to animals.|`|e87cd8e8c653d0f68402573b2d9f3ef1aa	Companionship I suppose.

Conditioner doesn't help mats only brushing, combing, splitting them apart or cutting them out do. Any tangles or mats must be removed before giving a bath anyway - not only does it make them more difficult to remove but your dog hair in the mats isn't being cleaned either. Take dog to pro groomer for the best job.|`|Ms8b2kISaa	A lot of people on here are going to say no, but there really isn't a problem. Dog shampoo is supposed to be gentler and more pH balanced for a dog's skin and coat, but in all my years as a grooming assistant, we've used honey and almond shampoo from Sally Beauty Supply, and the matching protein conditioner. They're obviously made for humans, but they work wonderfully on the dogs and cats, and we've never had a complaint. Just make sure the conditioner you use is a fairly "normal" one, not a special formula for frizzies, thickening, etc., as these may leave residue in her coat that will make it sticky and lead to more tangles! Good luck!|`|OxFsslN8aa	I would suggest cutting out the existing mats first and then washing.

Check with the veterinarian if you're not sure what to use.  <br>  <br>  In my experience, it's best just to remove the mats.  If the mats aren't very dense, you might be able to just make a few cuts part way through the mat and then ease it apart with your fingers.

Another RES would be great, a map turtle would work as well as any type of slider. Musk turtles would work well too.  The turtle you do not want in the tank with your RES is a snapper.

8i90ov0Gaa	No turtle can be mature and lay eggs at 11 months of age...ever. It is digging in the bottom to look for food. Turtles have amazing appetites and even if heavily fed, will still look for food. Don't worry about it, or if it bothers you, just remove the gravel. I don't keep anything on the bottom for my aquatic turtles.<br>  <br>  How are checking the temperature? If you're using one of those cheap stick-on thermometers stuck to the back of the cage, get rid of it. A 100 watt bulb puts off a lot of heat, usually too much for a snake in a small aquarium when combined with a heat pad. Buy yourself a temp gun so you can get an accurate reading. Every reptile keeper should own one. The humidity is probably a little high, but not much, so I'd reduce the sprayings. <a href="http://tempgun.com" rel="nofollow">http://tempgun.com</a>|`|QrjjiOgTaa	turtles will lay eggs even if they are unfertilized, kinda like a bird will. just let her do her thing, it feels natural to her.<br>  <br>  i would put it on aspen or cage carpet, sometimes eco earth will get cold when moist. only mist her once a day or every other day (a basement has more humidity in it than any other room in the house). is the snake eating? if it is eating then you probably have it at the right temp. these snakes are finicky to begin with.|`|3o6qACycaa	What are the temps at the cool side or the snake tank|`|2YIxnXXyaa	Some just burrow.

He is the sweetest doggie ever. Poms are active little furballs and are very alert! They are also highly trainable and you can teach them lots of silly tricks. But anyways.....<br>  <br>  <br>  The good: Cute, small, very loyal<br>  <br>  The bad: Can bark ALOT if not trained, most Poms aren't good with children (mine is, but he is one of the few), they are very high maintanence! Require lots of grooming (if you can't do it yourself, be prepared to spend $30-60 a month to go to a professional groomer), can be snappy if they get too spoiled.<br>  <br>  <br>  All and all, I think they are fabulous dogs as long as you do your research!!!

The dog was only about 3 at the time but the volunteers originally thought she was closer to 7 years old because of the condition of her teeth and coat.  She also had a prolapsed vulva (vulva coming outside of her vagina) and was in a lot of pain from being shoved into a small crate for her whole life being forced to breed over and over again.  <br>  <br>  Even in pain, the dog (Tori) was full of smiles and kisses.  She needed almost half of her teeth removed because they were rotten from her poor diet.  <br>  <br>  She has been through so much in her 12 years and is still a very happy dog!  <br>  <br>  I happen to know 2 of the people who adopted pomeranian puppies from this raid and they had a difficult time house breaking them because of tiny bladders.<br>  <br>  On the other hand my momhad Tori trained in about 2 weeks after she was healthy enough to come home.

O0SD7e3aaa	First off when it wants to snuggle when it comes up on you pet it so it feels welcome and play with it. I guarantee you that it just wants to be with someone who know it'll be safe with and love. Does it eat the food you bought it? When i got my first cat she did the same thing. They just don't know you they have to get well adjusted make sure it knows you love it and never would hurt it, don't ever like yell at it or anything because then it'll get afraid and not wanna be near you. I suggest keeping it an indoor cat (if you don't already) because then there will be more problems along the line with the cat. It's still a kitten so go play with the toys with it to show him/her that you love them(:<br>  <br>  hope it works. My cat was the same way when we got her, we rescued her and actually she was about 2 weeks old she was abandoned and ever since then shes been awesome! make sure it gets its shots and stuff too. My cat cuddles with me and purrs all the time shes the happiest cat ever, and yours will be too if you cuddle and pet it. Most cats love to be pet behind the ears and like right in the middle of their nose. Hope it works(: good luck with your new kitty<3|`|AA10253126	Take the kitten to the vet and have it checked out; tell the vet about the incessant crying. If you just got it two days ago I can almost guarantee it has worms. Practically all kittens do. Also it should be checked for ear mites and fleas. Yes, some kittens do meow a lot but this sounds abnormal to me; I have four cats now and have had cats around for fifty years so know a little about them. I also wonder from  your somewhat cold hearted  question if you are right for a kitten. "This thing" ???? Maybe a different home for the kitten would benefit both you and the little baby.|`|TuheGzLkaa	It will stop when it's ready. It obviously wants attention and giving attention to it is what it really needs. Having a new kitten can be hard. They're in a new environment. It's a shock. Your kitten may always cry the way it does now. Some cats are just more talkative.<br>  <br>  7 weeks is also very young, i'm not sure what you're feeding it but it might not be completely weened yet. So you might want to use some formula or milk. Kittens can digest milk whereas older cats cant because of certain stomach enzymes die.<br>  <br>  Give it love. It should adjust.|`|jSAylFLTaa	It wants love. Pet the kitten or try to play with him, maybe give him some milk, spend time with it. Its a living thing, dont be cruel to it, you are taking care of it and it has no mother. If you are so annoyed by it now, maybe you shouldnt have taken the kitten in the first place!|`|fHJcGAyTaa	Its a bit too young to be taken off its mother so maybe its looking for its mum to nurse. just be patient and give it lots of love, make it feel secure.  it will get used to you soon and see you as its mum and so stop.  Its only because its so young.  Mine did this too.  i kept it in a box beside my bed but it wouldnt stop meowing until i put it in bed with me each night.  it turned out fine but i was always worried that I would squash her.|`|pyBHdJ90aa	Relax, you just have a noisy kitten.  In a couple of days it will calm down.  In the meantime, give it a warm place to curl up.  Feed it some lovely food.  Give it oodles of love.  Get used to the mewing, that's what cats do!|`|AA10928214	maybe it has a tummy ache.

I didnt give my kittens away until they were 10 weeks old.<br>  <br>  He probably just wants love!  He's a kitten - all kittens want love.  Just give him plenty of attention and play with him a lot so he gets sleepy and maybe he'll take a nap once in awhile!|`|NAkQdoYlaa	Yeah, it could be missing it's mum, but my cat is one now and he likes to meow alot.

5PG9H1ozaa	Dear Licrlip,Sorry to hear of pets ailment but other than surgery there is nothing left. No DVM journals have any info that is positive on treatment. If there were some magic drops or herbs wouldn't the medical field jump on it for human?And the success rate for canine surgery is slightly over 50%. Considering the cost and pain to pet I advise to forego proceedure and let pet slowly adapt to declining eyesite.This process is painless and it seems other senses will sharpen to compensate.I have seen older canines,12 years and up,in my "shop" navigate fine around home and familiar areas.So Licrlip, don't fall for the home remedy "experts" or new wave herbalists as some of these items and cures can be toxic. Enjoy you pet and take more walks.Good luck and give pet a pat and hug for me.|`|AA10029366	Once the eye is gone (completely blind), you really only have a couple of options:<br>  <br>  1. Enucleation<br>  Removing the eye is the simplest, cleanest choice. It is not necessarily cheap, but you can set up payment terms through a company like Care Credit.<br>  <br>  2. Gentamicin Injection<br>  This procedure deadens the eye and seals it. The dog will still have the eyeball (unlike with enucleation), but it will essentially be a "decoration". I recently had the procedure done on a dog for a *reduced* price of $400.<br>  <br>  There is several weeks of after-care involved.<br>  <br>  3. Treatment with Latanoprost to keep the swelling down.<br>  I don't know that this would be the ideal treatment, as the eye will still be able to swell and change shape. Consider also that Latanoprost (Xalatan, Travatan) is an extremely expensive medication....close to $100 for a 2.5 ml bottle.<br>  <br>  Timolol is another drug used to control ocular pressure...it's cheaper, but the canine opthalmologists I've spoken to don't consider it as effective.<br>  <br>  Glaucoma puts pressure on the dog's skull, and can be extremely painful.

I love the combination, I'm not 100% certain how the tetras would get along with the shark, but the tetras you have are larger & fast swimmers, so they should be able to hold their own. The long fin rosy barbs are really pretty. Good luck! I'm not nagging, but I'm glad you know to school them, I am convinced that the reason my barbs do not go after the long flowy fins of the rosy barbs is a combination of them being in a shoal, and both being barbs. The LFS guy told me to get rosy barbs that are a little bigger than the tigers, especially since the tigers were the fist habitants & could be territorial, and I have had no problems.

Works for my horse.|`|AA12023527	try doing groundwork<br>  try a trainer with you in the ring (or really anyone with lots of experience to help you)<br>  try maybe getting off your horse for a couple of rides and let someone else ride him (to see if this problem is with everyone and not just you)<br>  try maybe seeing if his tack fits improperly, vet check, etc.<br>  try again lots of ground work if he does not listen to you on the ground DO NOT EVEN EXPECT him to listen to you on his back<br>  i know you said hes a gem on the ground, but maybe try lunging or something, is it the same as riding in the ring?<br>  do not ride him if you are afraid, he can sense you being afraid and that will make your ride 10x more "naughty" than normal<br>  maybe try having an instructor or someone at your barn watch you and see if theyre is maybe something you are doinbg (im not degrading how well you are at riding, just noting that maybe there is something you are doing when you ride him that he doesnt like, ex. one of the horses at my barn HATES having being ridden with a tight rein, if you give him his head he is an amaizing horse, if you dont he usually rears, bucks, etc.) <br>  maybe he's found you are freightened of him when he does this and has found a way to get out of work<br>  if thats the case work on boosting your confidence, ride other horses at your barn, start bombproof pony all the way up to a challenging horse, you'll find that usually this makes you more confident & when your satisfied try riding your horse again.. if you are scared though might i again suggest that you let someone else ride him and see how he does, preferably a trainer, etc. if he doesnt act up, he doesnt respect you and needs to learn to listen, he probably learn, sorry im being repetitive, :), that you are the BOSS, and what you'll need to do is just start slow and work up with him, maybe start at walk, make sure he listens to EVERY cue you give to him, if he doesnt listen dont move on to trotting & canter that will only make it worse, start from the bottom and make sure he listens, hope this helped!|`|1uR2zPnEaa	he is acting like this because he knows you will stop asking him if he acts up and rears and behaves bad.. if you don't do something about it now his attitude on the ground will also be ruined.<br>  <br>  <br>  you either need to take action when he misbehaves by letting him know it's unacceptable.. my horses was just like this.. i like to ride with a lose rein and he must have thought i was a noobie since i don't know how to hold a rein he tried bucking me off.. i flew right off not even expecting him to buck!! i got right back on.. and he tried again but i stayed on because i was expecting it and i turned him in tight circles and said no harshly and held him on a close contact he never bucked since !!<br>  <br>  so if you are too afraid of him and don't think you can fix this.. get a trainer to work with both of you.. having another person help you through this is a BIG confindence booster!!<br>  <br>  if you don't want to work this out.. get a better behaved lesson type horse thats obedient no matter what<br>  <br>  and you dont need his respect!! he should NOT be trying to take advantage of you thats bad bad behavior! and you must let him know he cannot get away with it...|`|AA12144656	I understand how you feel.  I've only been riding for about 4 years and it has been such a huge learning experience!  There are so many things that are important.  One of the things that will give you confidence is to work with your horse on the ground first.  Your horse knows if you don't know what you're doing, and it sounds like it is time for you to learn how to get to know your horse and for him to get to know you.<br>  One of the things that really helped me was to get some DVD's and Clinton Anderson really helped me here.  You can go to his site.  I bought the round penning one first, and it helped me be more confident, and also to ride your horse in a enclosed safe place, so that you feel safe too.  I didn't take my horse out of the round pen until I felt safe.<br>  Hope this helps some--|`|EQvAbyvcaa	This horse is not safe for you to ride.  Sounds like he is not broke to ride, maybe pushy and dominant.  He may seem nice on the ground but he needs lots of basic groundwork that will help you reach the transition into work undersaddle.  He knows you are insecure and he really takes advantage of that and it makes the whole thing more dangerous for you.  Nothing is worth getting hurt.  Get some help to learn how to manage him.  He just needs to be respectful and gain some confidence and he will be a great partner for you.  you just have to be able to maintain the improvements after you are back on your own with him again.  Horses learn quickly and they know what you know and especially what you dont' know.  You have to control his mind before you can control his feet.    Ground work is the key.  Move him Lt. Rt. Forward Back , release his hind and fore quarters, teach him to stay out of your space unless you ask him in.  Teach him to flex left and right and to go head down and relax.  These are just beginning exercises, but will get you on the road to having some control over your horse.  Never be angry.  Always smile.  Never yell or scream or hit your horse.  Take lots of deep breaths and rest when you need to .    Never give up.|`|BREi7qw7aa	if your fine with ground work, start teaching him how to lunge. I wouldnt ride him until he is completly respondant to every thing you ask him to.|`|Rc6HBfBzaa	i think you might have to hit him  with your whip on the neck and shout no!|`|AA12212950	I had a similar problem with my first horse who by chance was also a 7 year old gelding. Is your horse by any chance chestnut?<br>  <br>  Anyway, the most important thing is to try not to back off. As soon as you do they learn that they can use the behaviour to avoid doing something. Obviously for your own safety you will have to let them win occasionally. Best advice is to find somewhere you are comfortable riding and which is relatively safe so that if you do fall off you are less likely to be hurt. For example an indoor school is a much better option than out on a busy road. Also if you are worried don't ride on your own. If you have a friend who is an experienced rider it might be best to have them with you when you ride.<br>  <br>  Ground work is also really good as you can ask them to do something they don't want to without the risk of being thrown off. If I was having difficulty with a particular move when riding I would jump off and try it on the ground until he was listening to the command then jump on and try it. Long reigning is really useful for this as the commands are pretty similar to when you ride. Be careful though as the first couple of times I did this he spent more time on his back legs than on all four.<br>  <br>  Unfortunately you will sometimes have to give him a good smack. My horse used to lean himself against the walls of the school whenever I asked him to halt. The only way I managed to stop myself being squished was to give him a good dig in the ribs or a smack on the shoulder.<br>  <br>  Re the rearing, my horse tends to try this when I ask him to halt or reign back. The best way to stop a rear is to keep them moving forward. I would ask for a halt and if I felt him starting to rear ask him to go forward then ask to halt again and keep doing it till he got it. Once he did I made a big fuss of him.<br>  <br>  Please stick with it. Any horse will test you out when you first get them. Its worth it in the end.|`|CsC2xqM9aa	You have to think of yourself as the top of the pecking order. Think of yourself as the stallion or alpha mare and he is at the bottom of the pecking order. If you want him to do something he is going to do it dont take any nonsense. eg if u where above him in the pecking order (and u where a horse) and u told him to for example go away and he didnt you would kick or bite. So its the same deal. Your telling him to go somewhere and he doesnt give him a kick and a growl. If it doesnt help get out your whip. (i no it sounds mean but sometimes the only way to tell him of is by doing this.))<br>  <br>  Hope it helps :\<br>  <br>  I no its confusing lol|`|FcR8G8hPaa	Training metaphors like "lacks respect" and "needs to know who's boss" often do more harm than good, especially when they make it seem as if the horse is responsible for one or more behavior problems.<br>  <br>  What you are seeing is not a horse who is "taking advantage" but a horse who is confused about the right response to a request, perhaps because the request is unclear, perhaps because it does not match his training, perhaps because you or someone else has reinforced the unwanted behavior, or perhaps because he is afraid to attempt the request because of current or past pain, harsh correction or punishment.<br>  <br>  First, it's good that you recognize what you know and that you may struggle with this. Don't be frustrated, but do recognize that you (and also perhaps a horse trainer) have to take ownership of the unwanted behaviors and fix them.<br>  <br>  I'm going to give you a few examples that I have acfually dealt with.<br>  <br>  In one case, a horse trainer would not work with a horse due to being afraid that the horse was so rebellious and so challenging that the horse would attempt to fling him into the wall or the ground. I found out that the horse had been so isolated from normal activities that he had become hyperreactive to tiny sounds, even at long distances - and he would spook and try to rear and bolt. He also had somehow been trained by his prior rider to stop when squeezed with legs. The horse's personality was fearful, so when treated as a rebellious horse when he stopped on a squeeze oif legs, he became terrified and wanted to run. I took this horse in hand and identified the cause of his initial fear and spent four weeks teaching him stillness on lead line, a relax cue, and confronting him in safe situations with scary sounds and using the relax cue to train him to put his head down and be still when afraid. The horse is now safely rideable and we are working on eliminating the "squeeze to stop" problem.<br>  <br>  I am working now with a horse who just completed training with an aggressive trainer and learned all kinds of fright about basic cues like loping off. The horse has been accidentally trained to respond to using two hands on the reins, to lifting the reins in one hand, to leaning forward, to being asked to leg yield all as if they are intensely scary lope off cues. It has taken nearly a month to get rid of most of this fear and inadvertently wrong training.<br>  <br>  I'm telling you about these examples so you know that there are many potential causes for what you see.<br>  <br>  Checking the foundation is important. You need a foundation of crisp, firm and clear obedience on the lead line. He must follow and stop and back up lightly and freely. He needs to stand and not move on command. These are the foundations of in the saddle obedience. If these are not all present, then they need to be worked up to that point.<br>  <br>  Lunge work needs to horse to easily and lightly obey up and down transitions and stops with no bolting or kicking out. Any poor behavior or lack of speed control needs to be deleted with a down transition. You can force this with repeated yanks on the lunge line and must not stop until the horse obeys.<br>  <br>  Now under saddle, when the horse "takes over" and runs off, he is quite simply terrified or in pain about something and he can't hear your aids when he is in that state. Many horses react this way to several possible things, like too much tension on the mouth (you need ounces of contact not pounds), mouth pain from excessive use of reins, holding a stop with both reins for too long, etc. When I was taking lessons, I had a horse who would just finally have had enough of the pain from my holding the reins out of fear of her speed, and at about 45 mins in every lesson, would run off and not listen to anything I tried to say about stopping. I learned my lesson and forced myself to come off her mouth and ride in a loose rein. She became much easier to ride and the unwanted behavior disappeared.<br>  <br>  Bucking and rearing also indicate too stong rein pressure. Look for other causes, but try riding him on a loose rein. If you are worried he won't respond to leg and voice "whoa" cues, work on that first. Ride loose rein and whoa with voice, legs and finally a gently alternating rein pressure until the horse stops. Do not use the reins except when voice and opening legs fails. This will teach the horse to stop. Do this at the walk until it all works. Then you can try higher gaits and more complex nmanuevers.<br>  <br>  I hope this helps. Be patient, be thorough, take responsibiliuty and help your horse. Best wishes...|`|OXA9s57Uaa	I just purchased an arabian mare about 3 months ago. Abused and never trusted people. If you have a round pen they work GREAT. You may have to back track and free lunge him to gain his respect. Lunge him around in a few circles then turn him with your hand in front of him. The area behind their girth to their tail is the pressure to move them forward and the area in front of the girth to the nose is the pressure to change directions. Really use your body language. Turn him alot and make sure he is listening to you. Here's a website because i probably suck at explaining this. <br>  <a href="http://www.naturalhorsesupply.com/roundpen1.shtml" rel="nofollow">http://www.naturalhorsesupply.com/roundp...</a><br>  i have actually done all this for only about a week now and she is already trusting me and allowing me to get on her. It's such a huge change. Also look into the John Lyons methods.|`|PjDNSdFwaa	my cob done this on hacks, but she was only 14.2hh, i didnt have a crop on me the first time so i was very sturn and used the end of my reins on her neck, also dont smack their bum, smack their shoulder, if they rear smack them on their head. DO NOT JUMP OF AND GET SCARED i made this mistake and it took me ages to retrain her, she would rear  so i would turn her tight and the they cant rear, if you have the reins tight when you think she is going to buck it is awkwered so they would rather not, but only give them a smack or tap with the whip when she is being naughty and praise her for being good otherwise she will become mervous, hope this helps :L|`|ner3pemNaa	Hahahaha the girl who has the arabian is my roomie what a coincidence. Her horse is a serial killer and tries to kill everyone. Shes right though now you can actually do things with her now ever since she used these new methods. Hey Lauren, my horse woahed without showing me his butt today hes being very respectful. lol. Ill say the Gambler method....its different then her horses paylays. If you horse is a fatty and loves to eat (mine is a 6 year old Gelding friesian cross and loves his food) Give him treats for no reason and tell him good boy everytime he does good. He holds his head a little higher and gets happy when I say that.....so I put a martingale on him to put his head back down and cracked the whip and keep making him run....but hes still happy I know he is so long as he had that one treat lol.|`|b2C2z1Isaa	My horse did exactly that when i first got her. I'd agree with everyone else and say lunging. I did that in the beginning and it worked a little. Also, if you ride your horse more and more than it should start to act more obediant. When my horse would turn a way that i didnt want her to go, i turn her in a circle and she forgets which way she was going and then she just goes where i tell her to.  It might help if you give your horse a little treat if its is good when you ride it like after you are finished. I like to give my horse a peice of a carrot when she behaves.   Hope i helped =)|`|kOEX3MRraa	Respect starts on the ground. When he you tell him to stand still, does he continue moving forward and walks all over you, or hes always pushing you around and in your bubble, slap him on the chest. Dont beat him, but if hes walking all over you, give him a strong slap on the chest or shoulder (NEVER his head) and then strongly tell him, "get out of my bubble!" or "Get off of me!" or just "No!" When you are leading him and hes doing the same thing (in your space), yank on the lead rope, right under his chin, yank backwards, in 3 strong jerks towards his neck and tell him strongly, "Get off of me!" "Back off!" etc, then stop and just stand there for a minute, then when he quiets down, start walking again. Repeat if he acts the same. Tell him hes good if he listens. It all starts on the ground with horses. In the saddle, its different. Alot of riders dont show their horse whos boss because they fear falling off, getting hurt, etc but if your horse totally blows you off, what are you accomplishing? When you're riding, make sure to keep his attention, ask your trainer to show you how to bend your horse at the poll and get him to relax and stretch down. When he freaks out on you like spinning, a horse will sometimes shut down mentally and just freak out, thats when you get him moving on a small circle, just keep him trotting and focusing on bending and relaxing. keep things quiet, dont get frustrated. The only thing to remember when a horse, spins, bucks, rears is to sit up, put all your weight in your ankles, and keep him moving no matter what, even if you need to tap him with a crop or spurs, you keep him moving. If he bucks, keep his head up and sit up straight, keeping your weight in the saddle but KEEP HIS HEAD UP IS THE MOST IMPORTANT, if he gets his head down, he can keep bucking. If he rears, lean forward (not to scare you but if a horse rears, he could all backwards, especially with the extra weight on his back, so LEAN FORWARD towards his head. If hes spinning and throwing his head, Sit up and sit deep in the saddle, pull back on the reins until he backs up and kick him if you have to, only pull and kick him until he backs up, then release and let him stand there quiet for minute, then tell him good boy once he quiets down. The key to a horse freaking out is getting his attention focused on something else and you cant fear them. Something that always helps me when things get alittle tense all i think in my head is "I dont fear you, Fear me! Fear me! Fear me!" Yell it if you have to. It shuts your fear down and gives you confidence. You wont get anywhere with horses if you fear them. When your horse scares you, the worst you can do is quit, then he'll know he can get away with it and just do it again to get out of work. Another thing that you can do, and this works VERY well with my horse is do the opposite hes doing, if hes tense and HOT, trying to fight everything I do, I give him a loose rein and just relax, I bring him back into a nice calm walk and slowly build from there. An idea trainers always drilled into my head was, "Giving up is NOT an option when fear is trying to stop you." You won't get anywhere getting off and giving up. It is ok to get off if it gets dangerous though, but put him on the lunge line or have a trainer get on right away to work with him. I've sat on horses while they've tried to wipe me off on walls and jump over the arena siding, just to get me off. I stayed on and those horses respected me once I showed them whats wrong. I wouldnt worry about getting hurt, chances are you wont but DONT beat on your horse and take everything out on him, there could be various reasons hes acting like that, he could be confused or just pissed off and hes naturally reacting, take it like a champ but not like an abuser. Its gonna be alot of work to retrain him and change his mind, but with the right method, hes gonna turn out fine. If you need help you can always ask a trainer and maybe get a trainer and enroll him into a training program so the trainer can work with him and his problems because I'm guessing this being your first horse you're still unsure what to do in a situation like this and until you know by second nature exactly what to do in situations like this, i would work with a trainer and once you get to know how things work you can start taking it on yourself. But remember: Fear No Horse!!!!!<br>  It will help you in a lot of difficult situations, it has helped me. And always make sure your horse gets daily turnout or lunged  before riding, this could just be pent up energy.<br>  <br>  good luck!!|`|oxdme6xRaa	Did u have him vetted b4 u bought him as any physiological problems will become present when u ride him? If he is fine in the stable and a problem to ride then at 7 u will have ur work cut out to re school him if no one did it before? U need some advice from someone that can help u. I am not trying to demoralise ur horse knowledge but am concerned that u maybe over horsed at the moment. and please don't put yourself in a situation that u don't feel u can deal with as it maybe detrimental to both of u and i hope no one gets hurt.

Unless it's a horse, then I'm pretty sure in most states it has to be buried a special way. My St. Bernard died last year and we buried him in my back yard.

7rCVptKBaa	Best idea is to ask it's vet.  Because every dog and dog breed is different.  It also depends greatly on your dogs health.  Most likely he will tell you to use a pace that is comfortable for your dog-not fast.  And if the dog looks like it is getting tired-stop.  I would start short amounts of time - and build up them up slowly.  Just like with a human, starting to exercise.  Keep the dog hydrated.  With room temperature water.  And don't let it drink too much too fast.|`|y9tmCAxWaa	bout 10-12mins|`|pT0SFrlFaa	not much but you need to be right there standing with her just in case. but walking on a treadmill doesn't fix the urge to wander because in a pack thats what they do they walk together as a pack and not just for food they did it for the fun of it. to the other person walking on a treadmill has the same impact as walking on the ground. yes play makes up for some exerise but they need daily walks too.|`|AA11914046	ha-ha that's what my yorkie needs. i think you should just do it for 5 Min's cuz they get tierd really Fast and easy|`|s1Vioxrpaa	just at your noral speed and probly about 10 min
iiNAJfGCaa	Most horses, who are started correctly and by experienced trainers, don't begin jumping until they are five years old so yes, that is very possible! Of course it depends on the horse's natural athletic capability, but age should not play a factor unless they are under five or over eighteen - twenty.|`|bI7wMCJXaa	I took a 7 year old OTTB and trained him to second level Dressage, but that's only because he had good gaits to start with and has the work ethic. You can take a horse of just about any age that is sound and train them to be something else. <br>  <br>  Check out the horse and their conformation and soundness. If they are built right and sound for showing there shouldn't be any problems.|`|XbQGyiT7aa	that's actually the perfect age to start a horse, especially for such a demanding discipline. all the growth plates are done growing and bones are fused. but you also have to look at his conformation. i have a friend whose horse will never be able to comfortably break 2'3 because he's so heavy on the forehand. you also have to look at temperament. obviously, you're not gonna be going international, but having a horse that's brave with a good personality is a plus. and one that's interested and likes jumping. but if he's good and sound, then i would start him. he's young, so i assume he has a lot of pep in his step :) good luck!|`|iz03uvV4aa	SURE!!!! I of course advise coaching and professional guidence but<br>  I personally own a 7 yr old Swiss Warmblood Mare who Iam currently starting late and she is showing a TON of potential through a shoot.  By the time she is 11 or 12 (prime age) she could be going consistently and very well - my goal is 3'9-4'0!  Depends on the horse and it's will for the sport! Some dont have it, and some do. It's as easy as that.  Go for it!  Your horse might suprise you! :)<br>  <br>  Good Luck and Have Fun!|`|7xOhg2F7aa	Yep!

Most of the top name show jumping horses that you see on tv are around 14-18. But if the horse is capable of it then go for it!|`|WjDyaVx9aa	there is a horse i ride and we were thinking about show jumping him.. he is around 16-18 and he just started jumping about 3 months ago. If your horse is around 6 years old than YES it is very possible to teach them how to show jump. He may be a little spooky or he may refuse a little, but yes you can most definitely start show jumping him!!<br>  <br>  Good luck with jumping!!!

If they have it in writing from a vet, then if other renters complain they will be able to say it's a boxer/aussie mix.  <br>  I would also recommend that you train this dog to pass the CGC and possibly be temperament tested so that you can back up the fact that this is a good dog if ever challenged.<br>  <br>  And never ever admit she may be pit mix....it's just political suicide these days in many locations.  :)  good luck with her.|`|6SeWCfUfaa	Your vet called that an Aussie mix?  Get a new vet.<br>  <br>  The apartments can refuse your dog based on it's look or make you give proof that it's not a pit or pit mix.  And if they press the point, they'll win.  They are the ones carrying a lot of liability if they allow you to keep that dog.|`|0IMf5SATaa	Here is a picture of a merle pit, looks quite a bit like the one you have...thought you might want to see.<br>  <a href="http://pics.hoobly.com/full/PV4GHCK2KSPZ5IVV32.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://pics.hoobly.com/full/PV4GHCK2KSPZ...</a><br>  <br>  Also more <br>  <a href="http://www.mprgroup.net/pictures/cosmos/cosmos/4.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://www.mprgroup.net/pictures/cosmos/...</a><br>  <a href="http://images01.olx.com/ui/1/88/93/2558593_1.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://images01.olx.com/ui/1/88/93/25585...</a>|`|7rCVptKBaa	Make the vet WRITE a statement that the breed is an Aussie Mix.  If anyone asks - show it.  But make sure the dog has a sweet even temperment.|`|JoU7WTadaa	You should bring a copy of the dog's papers or a statement from the vet stating that she is an Australian Shepherd mix to your landlord/lady. Then they can't argue :)<br>  <br>  She does look like a pit, but I'm pretty sure the vet knows a little more about what he's talking about than anyone who may have a different opinion.<br>  <br>  <br>  Toodles :)|`|9SX6673eaa	I think I'd get a new vet. That is no way an Aussie! Aussie's have long hair and no tails. They don't have that boxy face either. That's a pit. It may be mixed with something else but trying to pass that one off as an Aussie isn't going to work, I don't think.<br>  <br>  For the benefit of your landlord, I'd tell him (or her) what the vet said.

Wo0AWgYVaa	I am a proud mom of a 8 mths Newfie.  I am going to write as much as I could to help you.<br>  <br>  It will take you up to one or even more year to have a mature well trained dog.  Newfie is a stubborn breed, because they belong to the working breed, which need a brain to think on their own,,,the down side is when he wants to get stubborn, it's a handful.  :)  Try moving a 95 lbs puppy when he refuses to come inside!!!  They also mature slow so you will still have a big puppy even at the age of one year when other dogs already showing sign of being an adult.<br>  <br>  I am a bit worried when you said you can't take him to obedience school because of financial restraint.  Newfie is not an aggressive breed, this dog does not have a mean bone in its body...but it's spirited and especially for male, once it reaches around 6 mths and getting into the teenager stage....it's really a handful.  I did GREAT deal to train and socialize my Newfie puppy since he came home at 11 weeks.  He went to doggy daycare three to four times a week for four months straight to get socialized.  Two levels of obedience classes..plus every weekend going to different places to get exposure , from elevator ride to mall to traffic to people in wheelchair..then at four mths age, my puppy started his fear stage and was a bit afraid of children..so I took him to participate in the Santa Claus Parade and got him comfortable with children..even with all these being done, at six months age, one day he decided it's a good idea to challenge mommy during play, so he decided to jump and nip me.  I am not ashamed to say it, once he started this jumping and nipping, it took me closed to 30 mins and I still CAN'T control the dog.  Basically every step I took, he jumped and nipped me.  I actually need to call my partner to rescue me.  Very fortunately I have a great trainer, she helped me to understand this is not aggressive behaviour, only an improper play behaviour.  She taught me techniques that within two days, I got rid of his improper behaviour WITHOUT any physical discipline.  NEVER NEVER physical discipline a newfie.<br>  <br>  So if you can't take him to school, please do as much reading as possible.  Please save money too or get pet insurance.  Thank god I did, my puppy is coming from good genetic line.  But as most giant breeds, the tummy could be on the sensitive side.  So far with vaccine bills, I have spent closed to $1500 on vet bills.  And it's not big stuff, just like diarrhea here, pick up Giardia or worm there, got a cut during play, etc..<br>  <br>  Another thing is please don't neuter your Newfie too early, wait till he is at least 1 1/2 year old.  The vet won't tell you.  When you neuter a giant breed too early, you take away the testosterone which is VERY important to proper muscle and skeletal growth.  So the dog ends up growing taller and does not have the right conformation.  So in long run, the dog will get bone problems and will get injured very easy.  I experience myself.  I know a person who neutered his newfie really early....when I compare my dog to his, my one has perfect conformation...his one, the head looks like a border collie, the body is as skinny as a poodle (I am not exaggerated)<br>  <br>  Newfie also does better on more meat based kibble.  They don't do too well on food that is high on the starch side.  Currently I am feeding my one with Orijen, it does really good to him.  His coat is shiny and has not have gastrointestinal problem for a long time.  Fish liver oil and good human food is good for them too.  Seaweed is also good for the pigments.<br>  <br>  I LOVE Newfie.  I want to help as much as possible.  This is my email, chris75works@yahoo.com.  I went thru the pain  raising him and I have a good network of other Newfie owners.  Please contact me if you run into more questions.<br>  <br>  Oh, forgot to mention...you can teach basic sit, down, heel, stay, come etc.  A lot of books will cover it, but don't forget about leadership training...such as you eat first, then the dog, you go out first, then the dog.  You want to get the dog realize who is the boss NOW instead of waiting when he is 95lbs...|`|T8OFsBUUaa	Teach the automatic sit. So, when he comes to you, have him sit before you give him any attention. Make him sit for anything he wants. if that's all he can do, then at least he will be well mannered. He will be in the habit of approaching people, then sitting nicely to get attention.|`|EWXzNyk8aa	-sit is a great start!<br>  -leash training and heeling.<br>  -add sitting when you stop to the heeling.<br>  -come is the most important!<br>  -down<br>  *FUN*<br>  -paw (shaking hand/paw)<br>  -shake (as in shake the water off)<br>  -rollover<br>  -play dead/sleep<br>  <br>  If you save enough money you can start agility with him too (after he is a year old). Lots of fun for both you and your dog, and it is a great confidence builder and bonding time.|`|RgYuXggfaa	Manners!  I have a St. Bernard puppy.  I have been drilling manners into him.  Sit for everything.  Come, stay, leash training.  Sit is very important.  After we got those down we started working on dancing.  Very smart dogs and need good stimulation.|`|SXlEN1DIaa	Sit, down, roll over,and heel
f71bc553ce48de0d47d00ce15fd871aaaa	the above answers are correct, to tell the sexes apart the male has along spine in the front of the dorsal fin, but your bigger problem is tank size you need to make sure your tank is big enough and have enough live rock to supply enough pods to feed two mandarins|`|h4wNRqf9aa	yeah two (especially two males) will fight<br>  <br>  remember that scooter blennies are still mandarins, so you shouldn't, for example, keep a scooter with a psychedelic or blue mandarin|`|JvTF7UrMaa	Living with other fish does not cause a problem.Indeed,mandarins are totally ignored by other fish in the aquarium,apart from large predators,of course.The only thing to be avoided at all is placing two males together,because the death of one of the two adversaries.One male and several females form the ideal population.<br>  <br>  so over all i would say yeah but only if you check with the pet store owner you are getting a female or you have a female and you are getting a male they will live together in perfect harmony
FQyeGsIyaa	How long has it been since your kitten ate?  If it's longer than 24 hours, you probably should take her to the vet.  There could be a problem and complications from  her not eating.<br>  <br>  My cat is a picky eater.  I feed her both wet and dry to make it more complicated for me!<br>  <br>  For the dry, the rescue group who helped us with her started her on Proplan.  I kept with that and started trying better quality grain free foods like Wellness Core, Merrick BG and Innova Evo.  The only one she'll eat is the Evo.  The Wellness she literally spit back into my hand!  I've gotten samples of Blue Buffalo, Avoderm and so many others from my local pet store.  She won't eat them either, so I'm sticking with Evo. <br>  <br>  For the wet, she's just as bad <g>.  She started with a chunky wet food with extra water added because when we found her she was hiding under our shed.  To this day, she likes her wet food with a teaspoon of water added to it and won't eat pate style food. It's been trial and error to find something she'll eat.  I keep a list of what she's had and rejected, it's very long.<br>  <br>  So keep trying, hopefully you'll hit on something your cat likes.<br>  <br>  You could try Gerber's chicken baby food. I've heard most cats will go for it even when they reject most everything else.|`|eaGZinlgaa	yeah could be the little guy has worms so get him /her  checked out by a vet...as sometimes cats /dogs go off food and they are not them selves !!  good luck|`|AA10815622	no need to take her to the vet unless she is losing weight. Right now you are at a battle of wills with her. She will eat it when she is hungry. Just be persistent.|`|o7j65xEYaa	Try different foods. Maybe Fancy Feast, or dry food.<br>  My cat LOVES fancy feast, and my other cat likes dry food.<br>  <br>  Go to your local pet store and maybe ask a manager.<br>  (:|`|pxzcyu55aa	find some kind of food it seems interested in. peanut butter, milk,...etc. and mix it with cat food or whatever.

TTI1M4fVaa	do you see anywhere she could have possibly cut her paw? almost like a small slash in a tire. Did you check in between her toes? Do they look raw and no longer bumpy? Is she limping or favoring one of her paws? <br>  If you said yes to any of these I would make sure she walks in the grass for a while and I would just take her to the vet to have her checked out. They will give you an antibiotic that will be used on her paws to help heal the area and cause it to not become infected.|`|1CqTmAVXaa	It could be 2 things,probably the dog stepped on some glass or has a tick stuck in the paws which normally leaves open wounds. I would honestly suggest to try to clean the paws with some alcohol and cover it with a gause that way you can find out if it's the paws,and then take him/her to the vet.|`|K87tb8e8aa	If its not a cut then maybe she got her period? Go for a check up and the vet!|`|mNBhYBAfaa	go see your vet, he/she will be th only one that can tell you for sure after looking at her|`|v2jxHGg5aa	If you live somewhere with ice or snow, it could be that possibly the ice crystals cut into its paws.

It is better to be safe than sorry. There may be something severe with your pet.<br>  <br>  I hope this helps!|`|7rCVptKBaa	Don't let your dog walk where there is salt, or chemicals.  When it comes in, clean her paws with a wet paper towel.  You can spray the paws with hydrocortisone spray from the petstore or hydra pearls.   I would let a vet see it, to make sure that it isn't something more causing it:  parasites, allergies, etc.
mNBhYBAfaa	how i did it was let her outside ofter. when she wakes from a nap, after food/drink, when she starts to sniff around too much. Praise her a lot when she goes outside and if you have to, wait. she wont get it at first but again, everything takes time. Try and associate a word with it also, i used "go pee". every time my dogs go outside i say "good boy/girl go pee, go pee". don't scald her when she goes inside the house either. that does no good. she wont know what you are mad at her about unless u catch her in the act and sometimes its not easy to do so. ignore bad behavior and praise good. they will learn. it took me 2month to train 2 puppies to go outside. now they know to come get me and take me to the door when they have to go. good luck!<br>  <br>  reward her when another dog is around, with food. unless she barks. then correct, and remove from the situation.|`|TcJVVurzaa	Take her to a doggy day care|`|FVD1tpLeaa	This is something that your parents should take care of.  Trying to socialize an older dog is a difficult task for anyone, let alone a 13 year old.  They need to get in touch with a trainer.
w9aR8ymGaa	most of them are basically crap UNLESS the breeders can show you the genetic testing they had done on BOTH parents, show you that BOTH parents are CHAMPIONS and also allow you to meet BOTH parents.  <br>  <br>  Unless a breeder can provide you with those things, they are a crap breeder.  Many BYBs have their own websites showing you their "lowriders" or other bull crap name...but you must remember that when they breed for "blue" or ANYTHING else that is not breed standard, they are CRAP breeders who breed unhealthy dogs, inbreed the dogs, etc.<br>  <br>  Check out the thousands of pit bulls in shelters that need you right now.<br>  <br>  WWW.petfinder.com|`|pc7ZjexJaa	Razors edge, gottie, watch dog, gator etc...<br>  <br>  Is BYB crap<br>  <br>  The only pit bull "bloodlines" are the 3 different breeds<br>  Amstaff<br>  Apbt<br>  Staffy<br>  But they're not bloodlines. They're 3 different breeds labeled as pit bulls|`|bPdqwkpPaa	When I start hearing people talking about Pit Bulls and their bloodlines, all I can think of are backyard breeders.  <br>  Not saying this is you, but so many bad pit bull breeders bred crappy dogs because 15 generations back so and so was in it's pedigree.  That's pretty much worthless. <br>  <br>  Rather than focus on the name of a bloodline, you should be focusing on the accomplishments within the actual bloodline.  For an APBT, I'd want to see tons of UKC titles in at least 50% of the line.  <a href="http://www.rokireds.com/brody.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.rokireds.com/brody.html</a> is a great example.  Look at all the titles on this dog.  Look at all the CH's in the line.  If I wanted a APBT with a great "bloodline", this is the type of stud I'd be looking at.|`|5BbxCohFaa	i say out law all of them who cares just get them out of the hands of the people in america....they are bread to fight and thats all they will do...people say there nice and it wont bite but 2 days later it kills someone kill them all!!!!

ylk1YSoCaa	15-16 years they live a good life if you take care of them they do anyway groom them feed and water them and train them they live a good life|`|peXKq1B6aa	It depends. These days Yorkies are overbred by BYBs and puppy mills which usually have hereditary issues. But on average I would say 13-15 years as long as you take good care of the dog.

If its outside someone passing by may have teased it or scared it in any way or attacked it. Its best they are inside if that is the case. If it is an indoor rabbit same thing could have happened with family members literally attacking it scaring it. Rabbits are very social animals they need interaction with other animals or humans a lot. It has to be on the Rabbit′s terms though...you cant force it to cuddle with you.  You might just have to coax it with food towards you and gradually get it to eat from your hand and then pet it. Food is a friendship starter. If all else fails...it may just be a solitary individual rabbit which happens sometimes.|`|hoOygDw1aa	Let's imagine for a second that you're a bunny. You're teeny and tiny and you're in a brand new place. All the sudden a huge, tall being comes looming over you, hand stretched out and moving toward you...what is your first instinct?<br>  <br>  RUN!<br>  <br>  Even though you're trying to be kind to your rabbit, he doesn't know what to think of it! Instead of going after him, is the pen big enough that you can get inside and sit down with him for awhile? Just sit there, don't look at him, but quietly talk or sing. Rabbits are naturally curious creatures and it will only be a matter of time before he comes over and sniffs you.<br>  <br>  Do this for several days and once he's comfortable, you can then try reach out to pet him on the head or handing him a treat.<br>  <br>  The most important thing to remember is to get down on HIS level and to take things very slow. Patience and time heals all!

It's the perfect height plus it's a slippery surface so it's difficult for the cat to get traction and get away from you.<br>  <br>  One of my cats, Percy the Persian, starts foaming at the mouth the minute he sees the bottle of Clavamox.  Then he sits there squinting like "Maybe if I can't see her - she can't see me?"  He hates it so much that recently when one of my ferrets had to take it for a tooth infection Percy spent a lot of time hiding under the bed LOL  Funny thing is, the ferret LOVED it and happily lapped it out of the syringe LOL|`|UNFxjNHkaa	They'll probably give you a dropper with the medication and you'll squirt it into her mouth from the dropper|`|eaGZinlgaa	i have syringes for all our pets but try a little piece of ham or fish or cheese (pets have different taste) dont be aggressive or get down hearted ..Remember give plenty of cuddles   &love and imagine if it was a human we don't always like medicine....Good Luck|`|kXdXJKEMaa	mix it with her milkor water and when she drinks it all up give her a treat|`|bfNDLbVqaa	mix it with his milk
Um8osMNuaa	Using the pee pads just teaches your dog that it's OK to pee inside, it's better to not use them, just take her outside at regular intervals, as soon as she wakes up and after eating, and praise her when she pees, if she does it inside don't get mad, just take her straight outside. <br>  lf you take her out for regular walks she'll soon get used to being on a leash, use treats to encourage her to walk.|`|wjwsFPMuaa	That's easy...train her to potty outside...eliminating the puppy pads altogether. I hate puppy pads...they're messy...the dog doesn't always hit its target and they are quite inconvenient. If you spray a sour spray around the wee pad...she will avoid it altogether..seeking out a different spot to potty..like the floor. Not to mention they teach a dog that it is GOOD to potty inside. So if you take her to a family member's house she may decide their handmade 1,500 rug is a potty area because it smells right. And I've heard the argument that the owner will take puppy pads with them. That's silly. Do you really want to cart a purse full of puppy pads around with you everywhere you take your dog? Or would you rather just take her outside and let her do her business? No fuss...no muss.<br>  <br>  As for the leash..You either stand there until she walks...or YOU start walking and she follows you. In essence...you make her walk with you.|`|7sPupfAEaa	Yeah, take your dog outside to pee and poop, unless you want her to go on the pad and stick up the house for the rest of her life.<br>  I dont know why she doesnt walk on the leash. How old is your dog?<br>  Start gradually. Let her drag the leash around the house so she can get used to it. Praise her. When you take her outside, be calm and just walk her. If she starts acting crazy take her back inside and try again.|`|t78DA6Dpaa	Teaching your dog to pee on a wee pad is pointless. Just confuses the dog into thinking its okay to relieve itself in the house. Best thing to do is take the dog out frequently for potty breaks. Generally after he/she eats, wakes up from a nap, or every two hours as needed.|`|6SeWCfUfaa	The way to make sure she never rips up a wee pad again is to stop using them.  Teach her to go outdoors. <br>  <br>  Puppy pads are worthless.  Most dogs turn them into toys.  Using them in the house sends the dog mixed signals about where to go to the bathroom.  You should train your dog to go outside.|`|lTsDwY9Paa	If you spray sour spray around the pad she won't use it. Try getting the kind with adhesive on the back so you can stick it to the floor or you can get normal pads and use clear packing tape to tape it down.|`|oSAnBPPDaa	my puppy use to do that ALL THE TIME and it drove me crazy.  i just had to choose one house training method and i decided to take him outside for all his bathroom business.  if you really really want her to learn to pee/poop inside, someone once told me to try to get a container (large enough for my dog to stand on top) and fill the container with sod. i never tried it cause he did really well peeing outside, but it might work?<br>  <br>  as for walking with the leash, maybe you could practice walking with her (with the leash on) inside the house and give her a little treat when she's doing it. when she's doing really well with that, move it to the outside.  make sure you don't give her a treat EVERY time though, or else she might not walk unless she gets a treat every time.<br>  <br>  good luck! hope that helps!|`|3rDJubWxaa	dont use them. i made the mistake of trying to housetrain my dog on one.. didnt work and plus she just got confused. and about her walking on the leash. this is what worked for me. i would put my dog on the leash and we'd go out. then i'd just wait for her to move. i didnt drag her or anything, i just waited. finally she got the point that we werent going back in until she went to the bathroom lol so she'd get up and go. took just a few tries and she got tired of waiting on me to either take the leash off, or just drag her lol hope i helped a little bit|`|KuUx34hCaa	why is she not going out side to pee & get rid of it most store have it in the pets dept.|`|bRxWkpfBaa	don't use a weewee pad, use old fashioned house training
RjlBrP98aa	Iceberg lettuce is bad for rabbits. It can give them gas, which rabbits have no way to release gas and can quickly die from it.<br>  <br>  They should always have fresh hay available and fresh water. They need pellets and fresh veggies as well. Fruits in moderation as treats only.<br>  <br>  There are wonderful lists here:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://rabbit.org/faq/sections/diet.html" rel="nofollow">http://rabbit.org/faq/sections/diet.html</a><br>  <a href="http://rabbit.org/care/veggies.html" rel="nofollow">http://rabbit.org/care/veggies.html</a><br>  <a href="http://rabbit.org/care/fruits.html" rel="nofollow">http://rabbit.org/care/fruits.html</a><br>  <br>  Baby rabbits need alfalfa hay and alfalfa based pellets.

usvomZbfaa	I would most deffenetly say Leopard geckos because they are great for begginers that havent have a reptile before.Plus they dont need much attentionbesides feeding and putting water in there cages.besides bearded dragons are very hard to take care of  and can waste alot of money on them for there needs such as lighting and they can be messy. where as leopard gecko always poop in one spot of there cage. and there pretty neat to watch at night and awesome when they go hunting|`|i5AsfCuJaa	I prefer leopard gecko's because they're easier to take care of and if you ever want to get more it's easier to breed them and to house multiple gecko's together

Becuz they have alot of different color morphs and no two really look alike. They're not aggressive at all and they dont have a bad bite or sharp claws.<br>  <br>  They're ALOT cheaper. I have one in a 10 gallon tank with a paper towels on the floor which makes clean up really easy. I got a kit at Petsmart with the heat pad, water dish, spray bottle, and thermometers for just $25, and a $5 cave thingy. They don't need a lamp. Just stick the heat pad under one side of the tank and that's all.<br>  <br>  All in all, including what i paid for the gecko everything was only about $75. For a bearded dragon it's around $300 plus your power bill is gonna go up from the lamps and all that.|`|K7T2ZUaUaa	leo gecko because there easy to care for and only need a ten gallon tank bearded dragon will need an 80 eventualy wich will cost around 70 have fun with wichever one you choose;)|`|SXlEN1DIaa	I would get a bearded dragon.
280d96ad7b5e9ffad03a34a66cac5db0aa	I doubt it's a genetic problem; if this mouse were to consistently produce litters of all males, then maybe. But I think this was just a fluke of sorts. It's perfectly possible for a litter to be all one sex, it's just less common.|`|ct8MWxJOaa	Thats Weird...
AA11887983	If a guinea pig has not had a litter by the time she is 7 months old, her pelvis will be fused, and she will not be able to have the babies.  C-sections will be needed, but she will most likely not survive the surgery.  So, no, don't breed her.|`|jyGTlpzTaa	NO!!!! You cannot breed a guinea pig if she has not had one litter by the age of nine months. Her hip bones fuse which make pregnancy potentially lethal for her.<br>  <br>  It doesnt sound as though you have anywhere the amount of experience needed to breed guinea pigs.

AA11901352	Even in this size reef tank you should not have two angelfish in the tank at the same time nor should you house 5 butterfly fish not to mention they will eat corals in the same tank.   Although a group of yellow tangs coupled with the other tangs would be nice you should be sure you have a tonne of algae already growing or this isn't going to work.  You are also wanting to add the unicorn fish, another veggie eater mostly algaes.  You will need a bunch in this tank.<br>  <br>  Your tank is more like 1870 gallon minus water displacement from 1870 pounds of live rock you need and with only 2 inches of sand.  <br>  <br>  you do realize this tank will weigh more than 17,898 pounds right?<br>  <br>  I would watch the butterflys and angels.

zuYpulgKaa	I have had gliders for over 11 years now.  ALL of them can be messy.  Intact males do have a stronger scent to them and do mark more than neutered males or females.<br>  <br>  So if you are wanting to know which stink less, it would be either females or neutered males.|`|q0rLBQo2aa	"Which sugar gliders are messier?"  Live ones.<br>  Okay, a serious answer: I wouldn't say "messier" but "smellier." They both mark territory with scent glands (on the chest among other places) but males are more frequent and fragrant markers. <br>  The smell isn't nasty like a skunk, or sharp like a mouse, but it's overpoweringly "fruity." <br>  My son asked me to pick up a shipment of eight sugar gliders on my way to his house, and by the end of the four-hour drive I was sure I'd never want one as a pet. One of them, with better air circulation, is tolerable, but even their cuteness doesn't make it worth putting up with. <br>  I much prefer his ring-tailed lemurs, and he has a hand-raised Bennet's wallaby that's adorable. I can't afford stuff like that, so my only mammals are hedgehogs -- better than sugar gliders IMHO.
4IZHdhJQaa	I can only speak from my experience with my puggle, i adopted her also because she was  born with no claws on her front left foot and was surrendered by a byb, but this doesn't stop her from being very playful, she loves too dig like a beagle,loves long walks on the beach, she does like the water but never goes swimming, im not sure she can swim, i know my pure pug cant.<br>  Shes very intelligent,loves being part of the family, was easy too train but in saying that she can also be very stubborn lol and she loves too curl up for a cuddle, but only when it pleases her.<br>  Like i said, i can only speak from experience and tell you how my dog is, but 1 thing im sure of, is it will love too dig, so make sure you have a very secure yard.Maybe you should ask if you can spend some time with the dog before you make your final decision.<br>  <br>  <br>  Good Luck|`|aP4bkYOCaa	I know anecdotal advice is probably not what you're looking for, but all of the Pug x Beagle mixes I've ever met have been stupidly hyperactive. My neighbor has one that is extraordinarily difficult to deal with and none too bright, not to mention that he's absolutely terrified of water.<br>  <br>  But all dogs are different and that mix in the shelter might love water and be a mellow couch potato- you'll never know. You could probably ask the shelter for any history, or whether or not they know how athletic he is.<br>  <br>  Beagles are scent hounds and always have their noses to the ground. They won't fetch as readily as, say, a lab or a golden. Pugs aren't so athletic, so who knows what this cross will be good at. :)<br>  <br>  However, I'm sure that if you were to adopt him, that he'd soon become a great buddy and part of your family, regardless of his fetching or swimming abilities!<br>  <br>  Best of luck to you, and thanks for opening your home to a shelter dog!|`|GSf09ALBaa	There is no way to know that until you get to know the dog.  I would suggest talking to the shelter people.  Often the employees and/or volunteers can tell you about the dog.  Whether they can help you with the swimming or fetching, I don't know.
hQ6ZqHjzaa	Pets at Home do sell them I've seen them in store, you can check the website. Or maybe you could could buy her some other kind atoy to sleep in. My guinea pigs love to sleep eat and play in cardboard boxes stuffed with hay. These tend to go down way, make a couple of opening in a cardboard box for her and stuff it with hay and she can make her own doors and stuff by chewing it, don;t worry if she eats any cardboard its harmless. You can also get like these giant cardboard tubes that guinea pigs like, but my boys always liked to wee in them which used to make them go manky. Or you could get her something more permanent like an igloo/pigloo, they usually like these especially if you put lots of bedding in there for them to snuggle into. Pets at Home also do like a tube made of hay which you can try, There are tons of other things you cna use, guinea pigs are relatively easy to please lol|`|DdQH0RF3aa	pet smart and petco they are the best int he world!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!...|`|YFTZM86maa	I know Petco and Petsmart have them, but not sure about internet sales to UK, sorry :(|`|BySzZAddaa	i no it sells everything.|`|BY0cV4kRaa	I saw them in Pets at home|`|40EotGSlaa	Pets at home<br>  <a href="http://www.petsathome.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.petsathome.com/</a>|`|WMIAv1N4aa	I tried looking online at Pets at home but couldn't find it , but it is worth calling them,<br>  <br>  Good luck
ZT0K3q2Aaa	This is serious. To be honest, i am all for pit bulls, but i dont think you should risk having this pitbull. Your papillon is lucky to be alive, and what if it happens again, do you think your papillon would survive? It takes just one shake from your pit,and it will all be over for your little dog. Take the dog to a no kill shelter, so your dog has a chance to possibly be adopted. Or see if there is a friend of yours, or family member that is willing to take the pit, that doesnt have any other small dogs in  the household. To be honest,  if you decide to get rid of the pit, its future is very uncertain, especially with the fact that it has almost killed your smaller dog. So with that being said, no one may want it. Another option is you should consult with a professional,Someone that is familiar with aggressive dog cases, and powerful breeds, and knows how to handle that kind of thing.|`|AA11457471	I really don't think you have another alternative. Rehoming an animal aggressive dog that size is really not a good idea.<br>  The longer the dog stays the more attached you will get & the better the chances your other dog will be seriously injured or even killed.<br>  I feel bad for all of you!|`|p7swtBYzaa	I hate to say this, but pits were originally trained to fight other dogs - not to hurt humans - the real danger is that they often do not tolerate other dogs.<br>  <br>  I'm not saying take the pit back to the pound by any means, but you cannot leave them alone, you need to monitor at all times if you want that little dog to survive.   Just the way it is.|`|ej9ijnS7aa	Way to many people watching the dog whisper shows.  Pets do not need to be DOMINATED they need to be loved if they are your pets.  <br>  <br>  Take the dog back to the pound or better yet have it put to sleep instead of it ending up in a home with a small child that it decides to fight for a toy with and grabs it's tender neck.  This dog shows aggression and in a pitbull that is very hard to love out of it.|`|AoSeHXeQaa	Definitely dont leave them alone together.<br>  <br>  I have three big dogs and two small ones (plus two small fosters).<br>  <br>  I keep the big and little dogs apart, unless I am right there with them.<br>  I think its just too easy for a big dog to use a little too much force and hurt a small dog, even if he is playing.<br>  <br>  That would be my suggestion.|`|0ee4bfdaab9564dc9d539b29997544ecaa	This is why I will never get a Pit or Pit mix. You just never know with these dogs... I would re-home it, fast.<br>  <br>  I'm expecting the thumbs down from all you Pit lovers. But I will never take the chance with one of these dogs.|`|J5hsCONRaa	Firstly - You may well do more damage than the dog, by pulling him off the little one. This can lead to rips and tears that would not have happened if you hadnt pulled.<br>  Secondly - What was the fight about? What was going on at the time? It's the only way anyone could have an inkling into what help you could seek really.|`|uQHHVI8Zaa	maybe now if you cant leave them alone, one of the dogs, probably pit bull?, has to go in a completley different room then ur other dog.<br>  <br>  if u dont wanna take him back to the pound, that's the only way u could separate them if u HAVE to leave them home alone.|`|lek4YlNjaa	first of all when your dogs fight NEVER PANIC that just makes them fight harder. Be calm and grab the pitbull and take him off, don't scream like crazy thast will just make things worse, this stuff happens with dogs just get some professional help and dont return the pitbull|`|VkFDAQ46aa	what was the fight over? food?  toy? anything like that? you need to be a little more specific. it could be possible that he is food aggressive. if so you will have to break him from that.|`|AFNN6wBeaa	Sorry but I wouldn't risk it happening again the pit bull has to go|`|GaLw1qMwaa	you will have to keep them seperated or find the pit a new home. <br>  its a dominance thing.|`|23ei93jxaa	It sounds like it could be a "pecking order" fight.  The dogs are just establishing who's boss.  Also, could your papillon be egging on the pit?  If so, you need to address the papillon rahter than the pit.  I have a pit and she gets alone wonderfully with my 3 boston terriers.  However, she does sometimes fight with the one.  But, I noticed that the boston terrier that she fights with is always nipping her in the face, especially when I go outside.  My boston terrier is trying to be dominant and my pit thinks that she is an annoying rat and can only tolerate it for so long.  Just keep an eye on them and you will surely figure out who is bothering who and then take it from there.  Good Luck!|`|wUg7iYU1aa	So if you didn't even see the fight you have no clue who is to blame, could have been the Papillon who started it, it's not always a Pit Bull or the larger dog who is at fault. First off to whoever said Pit Bulls were originally bred to fight, obviously has no clue what they are talking about. They were bred for farm work. Also one fight does not mean it will automatically happen again. There is no reason as of now to return this dog, you adopted him and atleast you can do is to contact a professional trainer for the both of your dogs. If the Pit Bull was dog aggressive your Papillon would be dead already, it wouldn't get along with it for 2 weeks and then decide to kill it, it would happen the first time the Pit seen your smaller dog.|`|RehgySLCaa	Well you didn't even take this in consideration when you adopted him? I've have dealt with dogs fighting other dogs, you'll just have to lay the smack down on that pitt bull until he learns there is no fighting in your house|`|4444d48004267fc3c148eb176ef253d8aa	This problem is only going to escalate.  The pit is trying to establish dominance and pack order.  By keeping him you are putting the little one at great risk.<br>  <br>  However, if you insist on keeping him the problem could be rectified.  You have to put the smack down in an educated way, and immediately.<br>  Please read the Koehler Method of Dog Training, or Cesar Milan.<br>  <br>  If I can keep my dog from killing my cats, then it can be done.  But your dog needs to learn you are the boss and the other dog is higher in order than him.  Thankfully he is at a good age to learn.  But it is YOU that has to learn how to handle an aggressive breed first and foremost.  Teaching the dog is second to you learning appropriate methods.<br>  <br>  And for God's sake have him neutered asap if he isn't already!<br>  <br>  p.s.- Make sure you apply this to both dogs.  The little one may be starting the fights.  None the less the pit needs to learn he isn't allowed to finish them.|`|d5781f30069ecf14d7c481d2dc40aec7aa	you "Think" they were fighting over a stick ... so you didn't actually see the start of the fight?<br>  First off I would say see about re-homing to a single pet household. Even if the dogs get past it you are not going to and that isn't fair to your pit.<br>  second how is your pap with other dogs? I can't tell you the number of times I have seen small dogs attack larger dogs. They attack and are out for blood, they are just too stupid to realize that they have picked a fight they can't win. Even the best behaved larger dog will only tolerate being snapped at and bitten for so long before s/he defends his/herself.

There are too many abandoned dogs and puppies in the world today as it is because people make decisions without thinking them through completely.

Please discuss this with your parents first. They will probably appreciate the mature decision you made to talk it over before just doing it.|`|9I8ZuixXaa	Selecting a Breed<br>   When it comes to choosing a dog, there are lots of things to think about: puppy or adult dog? Male or female? Purebred or mixed breed? And once you've answered all of those questions, you still need to decide what breed of dog you want. Every breed has its own set of distinctive traits, so it's a great idea to do some research on different breeds before making your final decision.<br>  <br>  The following are some of the basic traits to consider when deciding what breed is right for you:<br>  <br>  Size<br>  From the Chihuahua and Yorkie all the way up to the Saint Bernard and Great Dane, dogs come in a variety of shapes and sizes. A dog's size can be a part of his appeal (Westies can be at home just about anywhere, no matter how tight the quarters are.) or a deterrent (It's much easier to accidentally step on a Westie than a Rottweiler!). You should choose a breed whose size fits with your lifestyle.<br>  <br>  Temperament<br>  While a dog of any breed could be happy to snuggle up in your lap, some breeds are more likely to enjoy spending time like this. On the other hand, certain breeds will be more inclined than others to join you for a run in the park. Before getting a dog, decide what personality traits are important to you and look for a breed that meets your standard.<br>  <br>  Trainability<br>  How important is it to you that your dog can do tricks? How much time are you willing to spend training your new pup? Some dogs are more easily trained than others. There are great dogs out there that, try as they might, will never be able to roll over on command. And there are other dogs that can learn several tricks in one day, but they may not have certain other traits that are desirable to you. You'll have to decide which is more important.<br>  <br>  Grooming<br>  Are you looking forward to spending hours every week brushing and caring for your dog's coat, or do you feel tired just thinking about that? Are you prepared to get out the vacuum as often as necessary to rid your carpet of tons of dog hairs, or would you rather not have to think about that? The answers to these questions will help you determine what breed is right for you. Maintaining a dog's coat can be a huge time commitment or none at all, depending on the breed. It's up to you to decide what kind of coat appeals to you and how much time you're willing to spend taking care of it.<br>  <br>  While researching the standard traits of a breed can be helpful in making your decision of what breed to purchase, it's important to remember that every individual dog is different. Every dog will have its own quirks, some positive and some negative. Before making your final decision, find a puppy or dog that you love on a personal level—not only because of his breed. And make sure you won't be too quick to give him away if he isn't a perfect match to the breed standard.|`|ccpBuUewaa	it really depends.<br>  to know which kind of dog is best, right for you, <br>  you need to make sure <br>  what kind of size and stuff.<br>  <br>  well:are you the best kind of owner for the dog?<br>  how about that?|`|E3VXv1n6aa	um try this site...|`|XIH2oKtJaa	a well socialised, well exercised, healthy dog.
AA11901352	What is your water quality like?  Ammonia, nitrites and nitrates?  Check the water first since not all fish are affected the same way at the same time.<br>  <br>  Secondly, check your temperature.  While your fancy's like a bit warmer water around 76-78 the common's like the water cooler around 65  they both should have no problems really with either.  Your commet will become lethargic in warmer water.<br>  <br>  Also with these fish you need to stick to a strict weekly 25% water change with gravel cleaning.  No exceptions.<br>  <br>  Your commet my just not like the food.  Try adding some fresh veggies to his diet.  Goldfish by nature are plant eaters but will eat just about anything.  Try some lettuce, spinach, peas, carrots brine shrimp.  these are great as an addition to their diets as well.<br>  <br>  Lettuce clips are great additions to goldie tanks since it allows the fish to eat when they wish.<br>  <br>  Also, you can try dropping the water level in the tank 1/2 - 1 inch and allow the filter to dump water into the tank.  This will add extra dissolved oxygen back into the water.|`|MFZr5yhAaa	What size of tank?<br>  How is the water testing?<br>  <br>  I'm guessing they are in a small tank or bowl. Goldfish need a lot of space, for one goldfish you need at least 25gallons and then 10g for everyone after that. And that's for the fancy, with a common's I would go even bigger. I would suggest a min. of a 55g tank for those 3. Goldfish produce a TON of waste, get huge themselves, and can live for 25+ years. I'm sure your ammonia is thru the roof. So, the water quailty is probably what is creating the problem with your goldfish.|`|nNGrfHdTaa	I really advise you taking It to the vets,<br>  i know It soundss silly taking a fish to the Vet But honestly This could be serious,<br>  Please Get it checked Out. xx

If not, ask the grocery store manager to stock it for you - lots of people use it, shouldn't be a problem keeping it.<br>  It would be either in the canned veggie aisle or the pie filling section - but do NOT get the sweetened pumpkin for pie filling - you need plain pumpkin.<br>  You can always get a pumpkin, or hard squash for that matter, steam it (oven or microwave) and mash it yourself. <br>  <br>  Sweet potato can obviously be just baked and added - I much prefer pumpkin, more fiber, less sugar content - unless your dog is underweight to begin with.   String beans are also a good source of fiber.|`|KxjUim7yaa	It isn't in the dog store. It is in the people store. I use pumpkin almost every day for my dogs. They love the Sam's Yams from petco that is a dried sweet potato You can dry your own too. Your dog can eat almost any vegetable for some fiber. Carrots are good. If there is a real constipation problem, you can try soaking the food with warm water or chicken broth. You can add bran too, but NOT the one with raisins.|`|KuUx34hCaa	I would change for to Natural Choice as it is the best food on the market to date it has NO Chemical Fillers or By-Product in it I have used it for over 20yr.& recommend it  Be careful of pumpkin pie mix I would think the spices would not be good check with your Vet first|`|P2yRAWiJaa	To find the canned pumpkin you'll need to look in the pie filling section.

It is very important to not get Pumpkin Pie Mix, but Pureed Pumpkin.  Make sure the label says just pumpkin and that there is no sugar added or you're going to get a whole lot more poop problems.|`|OUv0jnbSaa	Plain, baked sweet potato works just as well (I think better actually).

Gb8cl8n2aa	retriever generally have this problem..she may be suffering from acidity..check it with your vet..and stretching is not related to puking..they do that when they wanna play..but still have her check with the vet..|`|bNcL4RfZaa	Take her to the vet just to get it checked out.  But dogs actually like being sick (strange I know but thats what my dog's vet told me, although my dog did actually need antibiotics).|`|iVQULHqYaa	I am a bit stumped by this, because she is only being sick once a week. Is she passing a lot of wind and does she do sloppy poos? If this is the case, I think that she, like numerous dogs cannot digest grain and that this is why she vomits. <br>  There is grain in a lot of dog food and if there is grain in the food which you feed your dog, you must change to grain free food.<br>  <br>  I have learnt by my mistakes. My present dog had dreadful problems because of the food which I gave her, I experimented with dog food, I tried raw diets, cooked diets and over the years I tried various dog foods. She did not like the raw diets and the dog food that I gave her resulted in diarrhoea. As an experienced dog owner I introduced any changes gradually. Nevertheless my dog still had problems. She was eight years old before I resolved her problem. <br>  Eventually, because of my researches on the Internet I found that the experts have discovered that GRAIN in our dog’s diet causes many problems. I now know that grain creates acidity in the blood. This causes skin problems, digestive issues, allergies, sickness, diarrhoea, anal gland problems etc., <br>  <br>  if your dog has skin problems or any of the above problems PLEASE CHANGE THE DIET. Avoid Grain, rice, beef derivatives and dairy food <br>  <br>  I now give my dog a dried food which uses beet for fibre and fish. It’s called Fish4Dogs and I buy it on the Internet. Look on the Internet and investigate yourself. Gluten free dog food is not enough to help our dogs, it MUST BE GRAIN FREE.<br>  <br>  A rapid change of diet will upset your dog; any change of diet must be done gradually. Do please change to a grain free diet. I have had sixteen dogs throughout the years and they have had various problems. Perhaps if I had known about the dangers of GRAIN they would have had fewer problems. <br>  <br>  Rubbish Tony's BY Dogs do not vomit  unless they have a problem.|`|84558de0349fa374ed3605ac33e8e36daa	That doesn't sound good. Call the vet.<br>  When my dog was sick last, the vet told me to hold food for 24 hours and water for 12 hours. (i know that they say you should drink a lot when you throw up but that's just for humans. The vet strictly told me to keep water from her, to calm her stomach!!) If she doesn't get better, definitely take her to the vet. But if she is doing this every week I would take her to the vet asap. <br>  Hope she'll be alright! Good luck! :o)|`|OxFsslN8aa	Is she eating grass?  Dogs will eat grass and then vomit.  My Goldens used to go crazy for grass once the snow started to melt.  <br>  <br>  If it is only once a week and all other times she keeps her food down plus she is drinking water then I wouldn't be too concerned.  If she starts to do it more often & weight loss occurs, I would have xrays & blood work done.|`|0le6RYndaa	A lot of dogs will eat grass which will cause them to throw up.  If there isn't grass in her vomit then you should maybe call a vet and get their opinion.  I don't see it being anything too serious because she continues to eat and drink.|`|KxjUim7yaa	Do you feed twice a day. Sometimes they barf when it is empty. Sometimes that is a sign of food sensitivity. Get a complete physical from your vet to make sure there are no health problems.|`|HgMFrllLaa	Most "normal" and "healthy" dogs make themselves puke at least once a week. Hope this wasn't too "stupid" for you.<br>  Late Entry : thanks for shitpoints, glad you've at least read the answer though.<br>  Last Entry : my answer is correct, but it's little pricks like this that had chased away many good and knowlegeable dog people. I mean the trigger happy "thumb down" morons.<br>  Thats all.|`|9203e742d7f8e1326e119aa1ca8803e2aa	If its only about once a week its probably an environmental cause rather than a health problem. Is there a pattern at all? Have you started taking her somewhere she normally doesn't go or where she hasn't been for a while? It could be that she's been eating something without you noticing. If she's started losing her winter coat that could be the cause if she's licking a lot.<br>  <br>  As to the water, one answer said that their vet had told them not to let the dog have water for 2 hours. That's not entirely wrong but a but extreme. It's the same as humans: if we vomit and then drink lots of water (we're supposed to have 2 litres each time we vomit but I'm not sure of dogs) our stomachs can't handle it so you have to reduce the amount to one mouthful every 10 mins. The same is true for dogs but not the exact quantities. Just make sure she doesn't drink too much too fast.<br>  <br>  Anyway, I hope she gets better soon and everything sorts itself out!|`|ywu9gf90aa	There's quite a few reasons, some of them minor, some of them not so minor!  I would always recommend taking a vomiting dog to the vet, even if the vomiting is infrequent - especially as she's six and this is a new behaviour.  The stretching, if this is a new behaviour too and could therefore be linked, may mean that there is a little blockage, like a piece of food or bone stuck somewhere and she's trying to dislodge it.  Or it could be more serious, like something in her gut that's stuck - which could rapidly become a serious condition called Bloat/gastric torsion which can be fatal - take her to the vet IMMEDIATELY if you see her tummy swelling as it means the tummy has flipped over and twisted.  DON'T PANIC though - this is only if her tummy is swelling so if not, it's all fine for now.<br>  <br>  Is the vomiting after exercise?  You should not feed a dog (or let it drink a large amount of water) for about 1 1/2 hours before exercise, and an hour after.  This is especially so in dogs with deep chests like collies or lab/trievers.  This is to stop the torsion I mentioned before as the tummy is more likely to flip if it's full of food and the dog is running around.  On a lighter note, it's kinda common sense - you wouldn't want to go for a run after you'd just eaten a big meal either as you'd probably throw up too!?! The hour after is just to let the system settle down again and make digestion easier - it also gives the dog some relaxation time and the chance to sleep if necessary after a long walk without being uncomfortably full.<br>  <br>  Have you changed your routine lately?  Could it be stress related?  If she's vomiting on the day you leave her alone the longest, or you have certain friends visiting who she feels threatened by, it could be bringing on vomiting.  It's a long shot, especially as she's 6, but if you've changed your routine, it's worth a think about how it might be linked.<br>  <br>  Have you changed her diet in the last 3 months?  Sometimes there are things called storage mites which live in all dried food at some level and some dogs can react in different ways to them. The level in one food may be completely different to another, but an allergy or reaction to them can take time to build up.<br>  <br>  I would say that the most likely cause is that she's got some kind of tummy bug, or that it's something stuck somewhere but you definitely need to go to your vet to ask his/her opinion.  They can look in the throat and feel the abdomen to determine any blockage, they could even take an x-ray if they think it's necessary just to rule out anything too serious. <br>  <br>  It's probably nothing much, but 3 weeks is a long time for something to go on for, so it's definitely worth the price of a consultation fee just to be sure, especially as she's so obviously loved.<br>  <br>  Good luck.

If you do have a male and female they may pair up and breed once they get to about 6 inch's for the female and 8 -9 inch's for the male. I takes about a year to a year and a half for they to reach sexual maturity. But most likely you got 2 males and they will kill each other off, it always happens. It could take years and it could take days but given a long enough time line in the same tank they will kill each other.|`|MccqAZSNaa	Most common age that Oscar Fish become sexually mature is anywhere from 16 to 18 months.

M9KUiTOAaa	Well I can tell you that a canary is not a good choice for you...a canary has a beautiful singing voice and is very pretty, but cannot hang out on your shoulder, it is not a bird that you can tame or handle. Plus a female does not sing. <br>  If you are wanting a bird that will sit on your finger or shoulder you need to check into a parakeet or a lovebird which I don't know a lot about except that a parakeet can be trained to step up and sit on your finger. And I don't really know anything about lovebirds.|`|RNG1cT8saa	lovebirds, very social and playful|`|0TTZERJmaa	NOT LOVEBIRDS you have to buy them in pairs and they are really hard to tame. I'd say parakeet i have a cockatiel and it is really affectionate. THE BEST PET I'V EVER HAD!!! also i think the males are better they sing more and i find they are less timid and easy to tame.|`|OUv0jnbSaa	You sound like you haven't had much experience with birds, and that's okay, but I would suggest getting a Male Parakeet. They are less noisy than lovebirds and learn to talk more readily, lovebirds are sweet if tame but go through a more distinct sexual maturity where they can become (like all parrots) quite testy. A canary isn't going to want to spend time with you but will sound beautiful. A male parakeet, as long as you spend the time, will warm up to you relatively quickly and have a boisterous personality. Choosing a male is simple...the cere  (fleshy bit around the nostrils) will be blue-ish in color in a male and pink/brown in a female. Make sure you purchase a BIG cage as room and lots of toys are needed to keep these little guys happy and content when their human  isn't around to play (especially if you're only getting one). Good luck!

Email me at bunnyhelp@hotmail.com and I will send you basic info and answer any questions you might have.<br>  <br>  I am a rabbit owner, House rabbit Society Volunteer, took a class on rabbit care and run an email for rabbit care questions.|`|RjlBrP98aa	Everything you need to know is here:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://rabbit.org/care/index.html" rel="nofollow">http://rabbit.org/care/index.html</a><br>  <a href="http://www.rabbit.org" rel="nofollow">http://www.rabbit.org</a><br>  <br>  You'll need a suitable cage, a food dish, water bottle or dish, hay, quality rabbit pellets (not the kind with seeds and other stuff in it), fresh veggies, a litter box or two, bedding for the litterbox (I suggest Carefresh or Yesterday's News), toys (could include carbooard boxes, toilet paper rolls - just the carboard parts, untreated wood or wicker for them to chew, etc.), brush, nail clippers for rabbit or other small pets, and white vinegar to clean up urine from accidents or the litterbox itself. <br>  <br>  I strongly suggest you find a rabbit rescue group in your area from www.rabbit.org or www.petfinder.com. These rabbits come spayed/neutered and litterbox trained. They are also handled regularly so they are much more likely to be friendly and like to be handled. Rabbits from pet stores are often unhealthy and not handled so not as social. <br>  <br>  Good luck with your rabbit! :)
bPdqwkpPaa	I don't know if I buy this as a real question.  New member, inflammatory question, no avatar or profile, no other questions or answers. . .<br>  <br>  But, just in case, you need to pick up the entire bunch and bring them to the vet.  <br>  <br>  Once the pups are old enough, the mom, and all pups, should be fixed.  The world doesn't need more pet quality rottweilers bred by backyard breeders.  Too many just like this killed in shelters each year.|`|0b09e77e84e77844850e09ff87b52905aa	Call your vet today.  Sometimes mother animals can sense illness or sickness in an newborn offspring.  They will sometimes neglect that offspring because they sense it will die no matter what they do, or that it will require so much time and attention the healthier newborns will suffer and die.  She's hedging her bets and picking her battles.  If you don't act quickly this little guy will die.  Nature promotes the strong.  The weak-without intervention-die.|`|TTI1M4fVaa	You need to take him to a vet ASAP!! Sounds like he might have undeveloped lungs or an infection which is why the mother is paying no mind to him. Mothers can sense when one of the puppies are sick and will not care of them because the healthier ones are more important. I would also talk to the vet and have them show you the proper way to feed the puppy yourself so he is eating.|`|AA10815622	well that one she is not taking care needs to be seen by a vet. Momma dogs can sense things and she kows those other two will survive so she is focused but the other doesn't have to suffer.
hUHwf0hmaa	Akitas are very strong, but I wouldn't pit even two of them against a bear.  Bears are crazy strong and used to fighting for their survival, while Akitas are domesticated animals.<br>  <br>  They are very possessive and territorial when it comes to their own families, and don't usually care for strangers too much.  I would be careful with an Akita around small children, as they have strong prey drive and can see little kids as a tasty snack.|`|GSf09ALBaa	I don't doubt the video.  Akitas are strong dogs.  They are also very protective and are one family dogs.  In otherwords, the dog will in most cases, protect you and your family.|`|5FVyVS9vaa	There are not to many animals that can take down an angry bear. Akitas are very protective, but I think they might lose in a bear fight.|`|9ea79964f4ddad1359a8089c6729bb4caa	Akitas are strong.....but bears are stronger. Bears weigh hundreds of pounds more than even 2 Akitas combined and could probably swat them away like flies. <br>  In Pakistan, where Bear Baiting is still done, unfortunately, they will pull the bears teeth and pull out their claws to give the dog a chance.....bears are just too big and powerful for even several dogs to take down. There's a reason bears are at the top of the food chain.
FtBqmFDEaa	If you buy the latest edition of Practical Poultry magazine there will be adverts from breeders in your area. Otherwise check out the local free paper, people often advertise surplus stock.|`|b8f0567cc965cfac3a2b7aa6564ba025aa	Put  advertisements on local bulletin boards or run a add in the local paper should get results.|`|qTfju2ggaa	Sorry, don't know anywhere specifically in Leeds, you could try a local farm shop. I got our chooks from Hinchliffes farm shop in Huddersfield.<br>  They are good healthy birds which each lay 6 days out of 7 and had been immunised when we bought them. Alternatively have a look on th'internet for a local Fur and Feathers market, there is a monthly one in Holmfirth.<br>  If you get hens at this time of year they may not lay much as the laying drops off when the nights are long. Once the daylight returns in spring you'll start to get more eggs.<br>  Hope this helps.|`|9z7k8HCXaa	Contact a local farmer, generally they get rid of chickens after 13 months because the shell quality of the egg drops. They are normally sold for slaughter, a quick google search for local Farms should see you right! Going rate is about 50p a bird.|`|f9op7sEHaa	If you live in Illinois you can go to farm and fleet. Or you can go to your local farm store. Order them online too. When you get them put them under a red lamp.|`|ZdlRGYZXaa	You can purchase chicks online and they send them in the mail . Its so cool to get a box of peo peos .<br>  attached is a link.|`|7cqJDhOfaa	Check online. I'm not sure if you have Tractor Supply Co. there (probably not) but find your local farm shop/supplier and call or ask when they will have their chicks in for spring. OR you could buy fertilized eggs online.
FQmZLqMdaa	Nice idea but could you cope with the responsibility of having two dogs.<br>  They will keep each other entertained & playfight all day but you would still have to take them for a walk.  They would probably run around the park like loonies & wear themselves out but could you really cope.|`|TTI1M4fVaa	I have a min pin and a few weeks ago we got a 6 wk old puppy. Our min pin has A LOT of energy and will bounce off the walls ALL DAY and every day lol. To make a long story short, her energy level has dropped over half of what it use to be and she's more socialized with people on allowing them to pet her instead of jumping around from excitement. I think its a great idea to give him a playmate that way he has someone else to spend time with when your feeling tired or want to relax.|`|y9tmCAxWaa	I think............you should get another dog cause it will have a friend and every person or animal needs a friend don't u think...Yeah i know,..........Well yeah u should get a new dog....|`|RgYuXggfaa	If you have the money, time, ability, room, and love go for it|`|5FVyVS9vaa	Yeah, but be careful. Make sure they don't fight each other for your attention.|`|h09gCzJgaa	that's what most ppl think when they introduce another dog into their home, to get a companion for their first dog, but in reality, now both dogs demand the attention of their owner.  They don't play when the owners are gone from home, they just sleep, sniff, and bark all day.  whether you own one dog, or ten dogs, they will still anticipate your return and want you to play.  and becareful when introducing another dog, when one dog has any behavioral problems or is destructive, the other one may catch on.  I suggest you take the time to walk your dog before you go to work and after you come back - it's healthy for both of you. You can even bike with your dog to get rid of that built up energy.
aCqSF87Raa	Easy - they don't get to go out until they are calm. I would work on things step by step over a period of a week or so:<br>  <br>  Step One: Work on their excitement over the leash. <br>  <br>  Instead of taking it out only when you go for walks, leave the leash lying around. Pick it up often and put it back down. Carry it around. Incorporate it into daily activities so they don't do the "I SEE THE LEASH! WALK! WALK!" thing.<br>  <br>  Step Two: Put it on Them<br>  <br>  Once they don't fuss at the sight of the leash, put it on them. Then walk them around the house for 5-10 minutes, and take it off. Repeat several times.<br>  <br>  Step Three: Take them Out<br>  <br>  When they don't go nuts over the leash, it's time to head to the door. Use one you don't normally use so they don't automatically think of it as their "walk" door. This is where the waiting game starts - you are not allowed to bring them out until they are calm!<br>  <br>  It may take some time but just stand there. When they're calm, open the door. If they charge out or fuss again, close the door. Repeat until you can open the door without them going nuts.<br>  <br>  Step Four: Walking<br>  <br>  Bring them on out once they can do so calmly. I would walk with one dog on either side. Keep the leash short. This may help prevent that crazy biting! If they fuss again, stop and wait until they're calm. Then move on.<br>  <br>  You may have to repeat the training often, and you could try using treats to entice them into behaving - but it works better if their reward is actually going on the walk. Steps One through Three can be done randomly throughout the day without actually leaving the home - the actual walk can be done at your regular walking times.<br>  <br>  How long/often are their walks? They may need longer or more frequent walks if they're always that hyperactive.|`|2c844fcf526bc2b90f16b7c425e11aa7aa	Walk them seperately until you can train them to behave.<br>  It may be that you will never be able to walk them together.<br>  <br>  Another thing you could try is have one person walk one of the dogs on one side of the street and you walk the other one on the opposite side.  They will still act up until they realise that they will not be able to get across the street to the other dog. <br>  <br>  After a number walks this way they will probably settle down. Then two of you can take them...again keeping them apart.. to the park.    <br>  If they are behaving, close the gap slightly between the dogs without ever letting them carry on at eachother.  You will find out where their comfort zone is as you close the gap between them. You should stay  just outside this zone and gradually get a little closer...it will be a slow process though.|`|hhWDHmfyaa	Victoria on her show, 'Its me or the dog,: gets this one a lot.<br>  <br>  It requires a lot of time and practice.  Use a soft voice to keep making the pups sit.  Once they calm down, start on the walk again.  Each time they go bonkers, make them sit, and wait until they calm down before proceeding again.<br>  <br>  Watch a couple of the shows.  She does this a lot.|`|mfXDUkRYaa	How often do they go out for a walk and how long for?<br>  <br>  Perhaps you should walk them separately for the time being and focus on them individually.|`|YkseyT7zaa	Without going into the entire series check out the dog whisper.<br>  basically the dogs are controlling you and not you controlling the dogs.<br>  Just watch one episode and you will understand

w1lh1INHaa	Around mid-February (depending on where you live) the eggs of "drain flies" are stimulated into hatching.  They also gravitate to potted indoor plants.<br>  <br>  These teeny little flies -- which look like fruit flies -- can lay their egg on everything and anything, and when they start hatching they gravitate to drains for food, moisture, and to reproduce.<br>  <br>  They are hard to get rid of as they are just as happy to drop their eggs in your carpet, on the shower wall...oh, and a raised toilet seat is a favorite spot to deposit egss...the plants, and the best offense is a defense, and that is trying to keep drains meticulously clean of debris, soap scum, and closed up when not in use, and the toilet lid (not just seat) closed after every use.<br>  <br>  Kitten and flies -- purely coincidence.|`|UNFxjNHkaa	do you see any on her fur/skin?

I was young and didn't realize how important my responsibilities were toward my babies.  I wasn't as ... ahem... diligent in my litter box cleaning as I could have been.  Often when I cleaned it out, I saw little black flies hanging around, and yes, yuck.  The flies went away when the litter box was clean.  Not to say that you have been doing the same thing as I had, but that's just my own experience to shamefully share.  Needless to say, after that little experience and a lot more maturity, I've been much more attentive and a good mommy and have not seen the little buggers since!|`|iIGOi2Idaa	Um, they are probably fleas.

This is what you're supposed to do when you acquire a new animal. The vet can best advise you; plus you need to start the kitten off on a proper flea and worming and vaccination regime.<br>  <br>  Chalice|`|rCNRcF5waa	Think about what you just said.<br>  Does that make sense in any way?<br>  Cat's don't cause flies. Chances are they are coming from someplace else. We had stupid flies in our house all the time in late summer. Even though it was too cold for us to keep the windows open. We found out later the came in through the vents, trying to find a warmer place.
8cikAYp3aa	I got a 26 year old Tb at work that thinks feed time is battle of the bucket time.  He had a tub and threw it and his grain around the stall.  they tried a trough for him.. he swept the grain out with his nose.. A shallow top hat bucket.. Its now missing its rim from being flung.  He cant be fed off the ground due to him choking before and I got tired of feeding the damn pigeons his food. (btw they THRIVE on equine Senior)..they did try the feed bag thing.  It led to a sinus infection because he actually Inhaled some of the grain, it rotted in his sinus..yeah gross..<br>  <br>  So.   he now eats in one of two ways.  I convinced the boss to get a corner feeder, Installed it and added 3 large bricks to it.  He has to work a bit for his grain and it takes him longer to eat ( a good side effect according to the vet)  Or He eats from a bucket ring bolted to a pole with the bottom at chest height.  the ring bolt lets him fling to his hearts content but the bucket just swings and 95% of the grain stays in.( fortex Rubber buckets are great)..|`|AA11570905	The feeder that Mandy R suggests CAN be knocked off the fence UNLESS you screw it to the fence on the back side.  I use those same feeders and they work great but I don't have them screwed to the wall and the horses sometimes knock them askew.  The corner feeder sounds like a good idea.  They also make rubber feeders that fit inside a tire that you can place on the ground.  The horse can't turn them over.|`|5i8lDbXfaa	Use either a really secured hook on feeder:<br>  <a href="http://www.horse.com/Premium-Horse-Feeder-BRB10.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.horse.com/Premium-Horse-Feede...</a><br>  <br>  Or get the mat feeder.  It's like the rubber ground feeders with a mat that surrounds it.  The horse stands on the mat to reach the feed, but then can't move it because he is standing on it.

Although she was even worse, she would dump her grain where she peed and would sort through it.  We put in a corner feeder, and that helped, but she would still knock all of the grain out.  <br>  <br>  So we got a feed bag.  I was skeptical that it would work and that she would eat out of it, but she loves it!  You put the grain in the bag, and slip it on her head.

RoPLmd2daa	Some horses just play with the bit all of the time. Since he hadn't worn one in a while, maybe it just felt weird to him and he wasn't used to it. Or maybe he was bored and that was the coolest thing to do at the time. Also, if another horse had used those bits, maybe they tasted funny.|`|28834ea3162329035a24ce080e7020edaa	Hes probably just bored, you could get him a roller bit.|`|UIM8X38Oaa	1 he could have wolf teeth<br>  2 the bit could be adjusted to loose<br>  3 the bit could be adjusted to tight<br>  4 he might not be familiar with the kind of bit you are using on him<br>  5 He could be inexperienced with a bit and a bit green<br>  6  I would suggest a caveson<br>  <br>  Hope this helps,<br>  Jenny|`|AA11570905	That is similar to how horses act when they have never or rarely had a bit in their mouth. Do you know for sure that he is broke to ride?  Perhaps he was broke and ridden bitless before.|`|4253fb6106243c0983e2542e5a7a5adaaa	If a horse is unused to the bit he's holding, he'll try to make it comfortable in his mouth.  My young horses did this the whole time about the first session or two with the bit, then they calmed.  The youngest one seemed to do this same thing to her bit a lot last year.  I know what you mean, it's like they can't spit it out, but they aren't comfortable standing, holding it.  My filly was wearing a Sweet Iron bit - I switched her to a Stainless Steel bit with copper inlays and she was immediately quiet.  I think the sweetness of the Sweet Iron distracted her - perhas she kept trying to suck on it or something because it was so sweet.  Anyways, a change of bit helped her.<br>  <br>  If the horse has the bit for say 15 minutes to a half hour and doesn't slow down the activity of his mouth, he's probably not very comfortable with the bit.  Consider what the bit is made of, how it feels in his mouth and try something different and see what the result is.  If he's quiet in that bit, it means he is more comfortable in it.<br>  <br>  Horses, can't lie - they are honest and they'll tell you anything you wish to know if you're able and willing to "hear" what they're telling you.<br>  <br>  A horse that does other than hold the bit quietly in his mouth awaiting your cue to do something is exhibiting bit resistance.  he's trying to tell you either the bit is uncomfortable or how it's being handled while in his mouth is uncomfortable to him.  Either way, the fact is, a horse that's not quietly holding the bit is not focused on what you're trying to communicate to him.|`|SHKhqBPtaa	It depends on the type of bit he is used to.  I had this problem with my new paint Friday.  I was using what we call a quarter horse bit.  He did not like it, he was used to the training bit, so I just swapped bits.  If trying different bits doesn't work, but a cheap nylon headstall on with a bit in it, leave him in a round pen for about an hour or two at a time every day.  Just make sure you watch him while he is in there, or lead him with it.  Give him a little time and he will get used to it.

MKuDawP7aa	Witnessing your precious dog or cat having a seizure can be a most frightening experience. During seizures pets often lose control, fall over, chomp their teeth, salivate or drool, whine, paddle with their feet, and begin to urinate or deficate on themselves. Their eyes become large (dilated) and unresponsive. A pet caregiver feels panicked and helpless while watching it all happen.<br>  <br>  Hopefully, you and your pet have never, and will never, have to experience this shocking event. But, if you have, or if you experience it in the future, this article will help you to understand what causes seizures, what you can do while your pet is having a seizure, and the various treatment options available.<br>  <br>  What causes seizures? Epilepsy is one cause. Certain dog breeds are more susceptible to epilepsy. These include: cocker spaniels; poodles; collies; german shepherds; irish setters; golden retrievers; dachshunds, labrador retrievers, saint bernards, miniature schnauzers, siberian huskies, and wire-haired terriers. Veterinarians are not sure what causes this “hereditary” epilepsy.<br>  <br>  In cats hereditary epilepsy is unusual. Vets can normally find the cause of seizures. These include chemical toxins (which includes chemical preservatives used in many pet foods), brain tumors, feline leukemia, feline infections, peritonitis, feline AIDS, head trauma, and problems with the liver and kidneys.<br>  <br>  In dogs there are many causes of seizures besides hereditary epilepsy. Allergies to food and the chemicals, preservatives, and artificial flavors put into the foods can cause seizures. Other causes include liver and kidney disease, tumors, poisonings, and low blood sugars.<br>  <br>  What can you do while your pet is having a seizure? Try to stay calm. This is hard to do, but using a calm, reassuring quiet voice will comfort your dog or cat. Move any furniture or other objects on which your pet could hurt itself. If you’re unable to move the object, place pillows or wrap blankets between the pet and the object. Slide something soft under your pet’s head, but be sure to keep your hands and face away from his head so that you don’t risk a possible bite. You can gently stroke his hip or side, but position yourself opposite the side of the feet and toenails as the muscle spasms make the feet curl into claws that can gouge or rake your skin. Dim the lights, and keep the environment as quiet as possible by turning off the TV and loud music.<br>  <br>  If possible take notes about the seizure so that you can give details to your vet. Jot down the time of day it occurred, the length of each seizure, and the time in between each seizure if they are recurrent. Your vet will also want to know whether your pet urinated or deficated, if the seizure hit suddenly or progressed from mere body twitching, whether your pet regained consciousness, and how long it took before your pet appeared normal again. In addition, you’ll need to figure out whether there were any possible triggering events. These include loud noises such as fireworks, unusual items that were eaten, and excessive playing or exercise.<br>  <br>  After the seizure, pets usually appear lost or drugged. This drugged state can last a few minutes to several hours depending on the severity of the seizure. Your pet may respond to you, but do so in a very slow manner. Since seizures are exhausting for your pet, he will probably want to sleep afterwards. It is best to allow him to sleep, but check in on him occasionally without disturbing his rest.<br>  <br>  If this is your pet’s first seizure, call your vet as soon as possible. Some vets will want to see if another seizure occurs, while others will perform a variet of blood tests to check for anemia, liver & heart functions, calcium, glucose, & electrolyte levels. Your vet may even run a screen for possible toxins, take x-rays, or perform an electroencephalogram.<br>  <br>  The test results may not indicate the specific reason for the seizure. In this case, your vet may wait to see if another seizure occurs or he/she may suggest medications. If the diagnosis is epilepsy, pets have an excellent chance to live a normal life as long as proper medical care and follow-up are provided.<br>  <br>  If you discover the cause of the seizure, you may be able to eliminate future seizures by eliminating the seizure’s source. For instance, if the seizure is due to chemcial toxins, make sure your pet remains as free of toxins as possible. Provide human grade food and treats that do not contain chemical preservatives, fillers, or byproducts. Clean your house with chemical-free products. Also, use more natural flea, tick, & heartworm prevention products as some of these products may lower your pet’s seizure threshold and make seizures more difficult to control. Avoid products containing organophosphate insecticides. For safer heartworm prevention, use products containing interceptor and filaribits.<br>  <br>  What can you do if your pet’s seizure condition cannot be cured and you realize you and your pet may ha|`|iZ2J85Hpaa	Yes, cats can suffer epileptic fits. And from what you described doeasn't sound good. I would take her straight to the vet, so the vetr can diagnose her, if she has epilepsy, as if you just leave her, she could suffer a more major one and die. Please take her straight to the vet..x|`|w2bHPA7raa	cats can have fits but i dont know if this is one.<br>  it could quite possible be that she was dreaming about chasing a bird around the garden lol, my cats judder in their sleep when they are dreaming. mine has just been kicking the air lol x|`|CTB9mUMGaa	My friend's cat has epilepsy and she has been living a long, healthy life, so I wouldn't worry too much about it, but I would still suggest bringing her to the vet.|`|wuwUHukwaa	Maybe she had a nightmare ;-)|`|zeTGmB3faa	Of course, something like a short circuit in the brain. Take her to the vet and have her checked.
w1lh1INHaa	Good looking kitties, and they certainly do NOT look overweight -- they look great, in fact.  Your gray cat is definitely not overweight, and your vet would have mentioned it if he was.<br>  <br>  Bear in mind that feeding guidelines on packaging is simply that, a guideline.  No two cats' metabolisms or activity level are the same.<br>  <br>  Free feeding, or frequent small meals, is actually better for a cat.  They have an incredibly short digestive tract, and more frequent, small meals are closer to what they would choose if they were wild.  In the wild, cats will eat 4-6 small meals per day, as it is better for their metabolism and digestion.  This short digestive tract is designed for wet protein, not dry "grains," so nutrients in dry food is not absorbed as completely or efficiently.  Dogs and cats have different digestive tracts and metabolisms; a dog can go days without eating and not suffer, a cat can't go 48 hours without developing serious issues.<br>  <br>  The reason your cats are wanting more, is because dry food really doesn't offer the level of protein a cat requires or desires to feel nutritionally fed.  Cats that only eat dry food perpetually feel hungry, and tend to become overweight because they do eat more trying to get the nutrients they need into their systems.  <br>  <br>  Your cats really should have no more than 50% dry (although 20-25% is best for overall health), and dry food can be left out for free feeding.  Otherwise, cats should have two good meals of a good-quality wet food morning and evening, with the dry making up the middling meals.  Don't forget, dry food is sprayed with aromatic fats that can spoil quickly, and it is this "aroma" that is also attracting the cats to eat more dry than they should.  Dry food is often called "kitty crack" because it becomes addictive.<br>  <br>  Add some wet food to the diet as "official" meals (it will save you tons in vet bills down the road) , and leave some dry out for free feeding.<br>  <br>  Good looking kitties, for sure.  Good luck.|`|AA11457471	You're right- can't tell with the black one. <br>  The gray looks pretty good.<br>  <br>  It is a good idea to feed cats on a schedule. Mine get 2 meals a day.<br>  This has really paid off as I've added kittens (& fed them kitten food) & especially when my cats have been on prescription food.<br>  I used to feed freely till I noticed one was getting very fat & one was too thin.<br>  <br>  To do this you'll need to separate their bowls & supervise. Give them 10 minutes or so or until they wander away then take the food away. <br>  They'll miss a few meals at first but they'll catch on.<br>  It took mine about 2 weeks till they stayed at their own bowls, etc.<br>  My pushier guys get fed in bathrooms, etc.<br>  <br>  People can't believe how little I feed my cats. <br>  The most each cat gets per feeding is 1/4c. or 1/2 of a small can but I actually have several older &/or less active cats that get 1/8c. or 1/3 of a can & they look great!<br>  I keep a container of live cat (wheat) grass available for them, too. That way they can munch on healthy stuff whenever they choose.I get it at the produce store but I think many health food stores carry it, too.<br>  <br>  Best wishes! <br>  Feel free to email me if I can be of more help.|`|RN1wGlWWaa	They are slightly heavy at this point in time.  Shows more on Diamond then it does on Abbie.<br>  <br>  I would not free feed either of them, and you might just cut back a little and split the food into 3 meals rather then 2 meals - that way they think they are eating more.|`|zeTGmB3faa	Neither look really overweight but could be headed in that direction. They certainly don't need 2 cups of food a day. Reduce the food to 1 cup or less and split a 6oz can of cat food. Even if they beg, this is all they need. At 2 cups, those two will get huge.|`|FQyeGsIyaa	Felidae is a decent food, I wouldn't put it in the kitty crack category, although there are better.  Your cats look like they're at least 10 lbs (have you weighed them?).  The bag recommendation is 1/2 - 3/4 cup per day for a 10-15lb cat so while you might be feeding them a bit more than they need, it may not not be as far off as you believe.<br>  <br>  You'll find a variety of feeding recommendations here.  Some people believe in wet food only or that raw food is best.  I free feed Innova Evo which is high in protein and doesn't have any grains so it's among the best of the dry foods.  I measure out less than the daily recommendation and give my cat about an ounce of wet in the morning and again at night.  This works for me - the cat has food while I'm out and gets the benefit of some wet in her diet too.<br>  <br>  If you do put your cats on a diet, please do it gradually - do not cut their daily feed in half.  My cat put on weight after knee surgery and the vet advised us to cut back a small amount because quick weight loss can cause severe liver disease.  Do a reduction more in line with going from 1 cup to 4/5 of a cup.  I went from 1/3 cup to 1/4 cup portions, a small increment but it was enough for the cat to lose weight.
Rw7gi86Naa	Are you an only child?|`|10eguzBCaa	yes there do|`|UNFxjNHkaa	you like one better than the other?  Thats a bit mean, isnt it?<br>  <br>  Gosh, I hope you never have children<br>  <br>  Okay, then just make sure you're showing both of them equal attention.  Because they def. do get jealous.|`|inST4SlAaa	i think you feel guilty.  i have always had cats and i always had a favorite that i gave more attention but i still gave love and attention to the others.  as long as you love them both and give them both attention is dont think one would be jealous of the other.|`|FoEWvYEsaa	cats get sooooooo jealous of each other.....i have 3 cats and they are always giving the death stare when i pet another...or pushing them out of the way completely|`|XA5jXtkfaa	do women get jealous. that should answer your question|`|1deMPLgpaa	cats do get jealous but if its the way its always been then maybe the one cat doesn't mind and is more independent.  Does he seem depressed?|`|KVpCANeNaa	Im sure he would since he gets left out, try petting them both the same maybe you will like the other one more in the end :)
bPdqwkpPaa	Could be a seizure, a tumor, poisoning, or a dozen different things.  <br>  <br>  I would not wait another hour.  I would call a vet and explain what's going on and follow their advice.<br>  <br>  <br>  Added:  Poms are prone to epilepsy, especially in poor bloodlines.  Was this dog purchased from a responsible breeder?  Meaning someone who shows her dogs and is an APC member?  If that's the diagnosis, you need to let her know that her dogs are showing epilepsy so that she can figure out if it's a genetic complication in one of her dogs.|`|csDhZDvraa	Sounds like he could have eaten something that is affecting his neuro system, a plant or something. A vet check is really something you would want to do for him right now. He could also have had a mini-siezure.Call your local E-vet and get their advice on the situation, he may need a vet immediately.|`|cETQuE9waa	I would have him examined by a vet.  <br>  It could have been a seizure or hypoglycemia or maybe even the caulk is bothering your dog who knows.|`|TTI1M4fVaa	I agree with the others i would not wait another hour to take him to the vet. You need to take him now to get checked out.. This can be caused from numerous things and can have a really serious consequences if not treated. The vets will do numerous tests on your dog to try and diagnose the problem such as x-rays, CBC/Chem (blood work), and maybe even keep your dog for a few hours to monitor. I would just make sure to take him into the vet now!
0IXut8ymaa	i don't think you can teach them that, they arent very advanced... they are rodents sorry|`|rRCTP9Mlaa	lol do wat i always do...like babies, if u want to teach them from right or wrong, u need to spank them... in this case, scare ur hamster everytime it does it so it can learn that everytime it pees there, u will be there to scare it, that way it'll no not to pee there or else u'll show up, lol one or two weeks top....|`|3eI0vYHgaa	Try a diaper! haha! I don't think you can!|`|ak9DrBSwaa	It's easy!<br>  <br>  All you have to do is convience your hamsters human to stop calling what he considers his toilet his bed. He could care less that it said "hamster bed" on it when you purchased it, instead of "potty".<br>  <br>  Unless you mean he's actually sleeping in the same place he goes potty. If this is the case, there's likely an underlying issue, since hamsters are pretty clean animals. Often its the cage being too small.

ZddQ0XHmaa	You should first wash your dog with a de-greasing dishsoap (no fragrance) because that is the first thing they will do at the vet. Then get to an ER asap. This stuff can kill =o( Have the box handy with you when you go. They will probably call ASPCA poison control once you are there.|`|PM23RDycaa	Do not treat your dog with out talking to a vet first. Make sure you have washed the drops off the dog COMPLETELY. Call and talk to your vet.|`|AA11887983	It depends on the type of reaction.  If you have not washed the stuff off yet, do it using dawn dish soap.  <br>  <br>  The only type of reaction that benadryl will help with is if the dog has a small irritated area on the dog's back, where it was applied.  Other side effects may need treatment with a vet. <br>  <br>  You can give 1 adult strength (25mg) capsule to the dog every 8 hours.  I would suggest that you confirm this with your veterinarian.|`|7rCVptKBaa	Call your vet asap.  Especially with a 20 lb puppy.  Allergic reactions can be serious to that stuff.  It is a chemical.  Also, it should say the age and weight to use it on.  Make sure you didn't use the wrong stuff or too much for the puppy.  But call the vet now.  Benadryl is used for allergies-however, the vet tell you by the weight.  And it is a puppy.  IF the puppy is vomiting, acting lethargic, not eating, or has diarrhea-bring it to the nearest 24 hour vet or Animal hospital.  You can call them first-but if it has symptoms most likely they will tell you to get the puppy in.|`|1tOr2qLAaa	I have a  11lb Peke and I was told to give her 1/2 tablet, that was for allergies. The best is to call a vet to be sure about the amt. For the future, don't buy anything that is med. or flea or anything like that from a store as in Petco etc.  Too many reactions occur from that stuff, always buy from your vet, it may cost a little more. But the safety and no vet bill is worth the extra cost. I think you can go to any vet and buy flea meds  I am not sure about heartworm, because you should have your dog tested before you give heartworm medicine. So you would have to see the vet first.  Good luck.|`|8584e0329fb17c662606d5a6a8650ee2aa	This is a job for your vet.  The toxic reaction from the Seargents stuff may not be an allergic reaction and benadryl may or may not help.  And even if it does, you need a vet to tell you the proper dosage.  Don't self-medicate your pup any more - call the vet.|`|2ef97aeb1a649982da219c1f98d30f3aaa	Thats why you should go to your vet.  That stuff in the store is bad.  As for the Benadryl, use the childrens benadryl, it goes by the weight.  You should also contact your vet too before giving it to him.  Gold Bond Powder will also cool the itch.|`|sW8eg01saa	my dog had an reaction a few weeks ago and the vet said to give her 5 mL  of liquid benadryl with no Tylenol at all, but i have a 11 pound dog so you might want to call your vet first so you can get the right amount|`|bRxWkpfBaa	1.6ml (you will need a syringe, it's dosed at 1mg per lb)
