I am fairly certain it is something with the Passlock, but I don't know how to confirm it. If it is this problem, do I have to take it to a GM dealer to fix or can any mechanic do?

I took the truck in to see why it wouldn't shift out of first gear (AUTOMATIC) he sad that the balancer has a sensor inside called a knock senser that sends a signal to the ECM (computer) and that will cause the tranny to not shift. (among other things). He said it was a way the computer protects the engine from a major mechanical breakdown. Any input on this. Is he right. and the harmonic balancer is in fact broken so I tend to believe him. He said he'll show me the sensor when the balancer is removed. How buch for a 4.3 ltr 89 GMC balancer?

Things we've already thought of:   Make sure you stop at stop signs for about 3-4 seconds, always stop before the white line, break smoothly, when backing up ALWAYS turn your head as well as look in mirrors, make sure the tester has his belt on, when doing a three point turn use your signal when you change directions each time, when backing into a space, try and start from two spaces away to have enough room to back in.      Anything else you guys can think of? Thanks!

20061129184506AAmTeWQ	Cars & Transportation;Maintenance & Repairs	Bruit bizzare venant de la roue arrière droite?	Ma voiture est une Mazda MX3.  Ce bruit étrange est apparue alors que je roulais.  Le bruit en question est un genre de frottement.  Un bruit qui pourrait même laisser croire que je risque de perdre ma roue, mais je ne crois pas que ce soit le cas.  dans la conduite et le freinage; aucune différence.  à noter que juste avant l'appartition du bruit en question, j'ai cru entendre un petite bruit aigu.  Comme un ressort qui se brise, ou un truc du genre.  Je vais aller au garage bien sur, c'est assez inquiètant.  mais j'aimerais quand meme avoir qques avis.  les bruits sont assez difficle a expliquer...mais bon, j'espère que certains ont compris :)
