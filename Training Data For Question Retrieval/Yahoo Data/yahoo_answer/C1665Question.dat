20090128214916AAvMWCP	Travel;Air Travel	What's your best "person got kicked off an airplane" story?	Hopefully it's not one about YOU getting kicked off (what happens to people who get kicked off anyway, do they go to jail or just get banned from the airline forever?)...mine is in November of 2008, this big guy was in line to board the plane and had a suitcase with him. The airline checker said, "Sir, your bag is too big, you'll have to check it" and the guy started yelling VERY LOUDLY: "Oh! So my bag is too big? People I want you to look at this bag and then look at THIS bag" and he held up his bag and the bag of an airline employee who was also boarding. Then he proceeded to rant and rave about this and that and said he's sick of it, etc. He was obviously nuts! He got onto the plane and got into his seat and then kept yelling out loud, talking to himself...then these 2 men came on board, waited til everyone was seated, and told him the captain asked him to leave! He started yelling again and I was terrified that a huge fight was going to ensue, but he ended up walking off peacefully and everyone clapped! I was too scared to clap....my parents told me they were on a flight overseas and this guy got wasted, started looking up women's skirts, and finally the passengers restrained him and ending up sitting on him until they landed and the police took him!    Someone on that plane ride also told me a story that a woman refused to turn off/put away her laptop, and when the plane landed she was literally carried off....we had better listen to those airline stewards and stewardesses, even though some of them have major attitude and appear to be on HUGE power trips (although I think if I had to fly with a ton of mostly crazy people in a small space, I'd be authoritative too, just to protect myself!)  Best answer = 10 points.
