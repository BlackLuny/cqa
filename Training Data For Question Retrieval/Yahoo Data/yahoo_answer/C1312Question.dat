Je pense que nos cerveaux cartésiens tentent de se rassurer en imaginant un début et une fin à toute chose en se basant sur des lois soi disant universelles. Et si cette théorie est vraie et que tout est parti d’un concentré de matière, alors qu’y avait-il autour avant ?   L’univers n’a-t-il simplement pas toujours été là, au-delà de ce que nous considérons comme le temps ?

It was one of the smaller redish ones that dont fly. When he squished it with a shoe, it died, but something started to come out of its "butt". I thought maybe it was feces.. but it kept coming out.. it ended up being about 6 times as long as the bug itself. It finally came all the way out of the dead roach, and started moving around like a snake. I mean curling itself up and "slithering" around... until after about 2 or 3 minutes it also died. What could this have possibly been? Do bugs get tapeworms? It was the strangest thing I have ever seen, and it really freaked me out!!    It looked like a tiny snake... it was full of movement, reaching up in the air and everything...

By counting the total number of edges in G, prove that Y has at least as many vertices as X.

20070510185843AAdMtDy	Science & Mathematics;Mathematics	Help With Math problem?	You have 4 boats (Boat 8, Boat 4, Boat 2, and Boat 1) on one side of a river. The boat name (number) indicates the number of minutes it takes that boat to cross the river. You may place a smaller numbered boat inside a larger numbered boat, but ONLY ONE BOAT inside on any trip. For example, Boat 1 could be placed inside Boat 2, Boat 4, or Boat 8. Boat 4 could not be placed in Boat 2, but it could go inside Boat 8. You are in the boats when any trip is made. If you were to put Boat 1 inside Boat 8 and cross the river, then left Boat 8 on the other side and returned in Boat 1, you would use 9 minutes.

20070730082431AAA67bf	Science & Mathematics;Mathematics	Triple Integral Help?	Find the triple integral e^[(x^2 + y^2 + z^2)^3] dV  over T if T is the solid bounded by  x^2 + y^2 + z^2 = 1 and the upper cone    z = sqrt(x^2 + y^2) .      I have used spherical coordinates. Solving  z = sqrt(x^2 + y^2) and x^2 + y^2 + z^2 = 1 together, i have obtained z = 1/sqrt(2). Here, rho takes values between 1/sqrt(2)*sin(phi) and 1. Traditional phi angle takes values between 0 and Pi/4, since    tan(phi) = r/z. There is no restriction for theta, so it takes values from 0 to 2 Pi. Hence,   With the above integration limits, the integrand is    e^[(rho)^3]((rho)^2) sin(phi)d(rho) d(phi) d(theta). Am i right? I'm doubtful for the lower limit of rho.   Also can you write(without evalution) the integral in terms of cylindirical coordinates? Thanks!
20070731084223AAmSje5	Science & Mathematics;Mathematics	Improper Integral in 3-Space?	Discuss the convergence of the integral    1/[x^2 + y^2 + z^2 + 1]^2 dxdydz in the whole space.   Since the space is unbounded, the integral is an improper integral so we can consider a sphere with radius N and take the limit as N goes to infinity. I have used spherical coordinates. Theta is between 0 and 2Pi, Phi is between 0 and Pi, and rho is between 0 and N and the integrand becomes    (rho^2)sin(Phi)/[1 + (rho^2)] d(rho) d(phi) d(theta) .    Here again we use substitution : rho = tan x and the integrand becomes    ((sin x)^2)d(x). But i can't figure out how to go on then? Is this integral convergent?
