Does anybody out there celebrate for getting fired from a job that they really hated even though this particular job paid allot of money and that I probably wont find another job that pays as much as this job?

I have no ties to this city other than my family and friends. My plans have always been to travel and I have been putting things in place for a working holiday for a year this coming September. It has always been my dream.    I have recently been offered a job that will pay very well ($45,000 yr)and a car is included. I had my heart set on leaving, but I do not know if I should decline this offer. The job has nothing to do with design and I would have to take courses to learn which would be paid for. The job is very dry in my eyes, but the money is huge from making $16.50. And the hard part is, the guy that is offering is a family friend. I do not just want to use him for 6 months and take off leaving him high and dry. But I don't want to look back on my life and say "I should have travelled."

I would like to become a distributor, my potential mentor is awesome, and his, and in turn mine is a president of the company...   Sounds good and all, and I have a lot of faith in the system, but I need to hear from a distributor or ex distributor how it works. I don't want to pay the money upfront, and not make it back. Or worse, pay the money upfront, and money for leads, and the good stuff that would make it better for me.......... and not make it all back.

20090227024802AA3HyP2	Business & Finance;Credit	What kind of Credit Card would be best for me? (Canada)?	I have bad credit so I can't get a credit card anywhere! And unlike the USA, we don't have those cool credit cards that charge to the bank account instead of credit. So I guess my last option is a pre-paid. I just need something I can have around incase I need to make an online purchase. I feel like i'm the only person in the world that can't buy anything online!      Anyhow, I tried Capital One but their fine print looks a little sketchy. Is there a good prepaid card out there that would be right for me, without really expensive fees? Also the amount of credit on the card doesn't matter. Even $100 would be fine.

Getting a job is out of the question because I have so much work I hardly have time to sleep as it is (and I need to work hard because my marks aren't great).

I've spoken to the student advice centre and they said I could apply to the access for learning fund, but I don't think I'd be eligible as I have a ￡3000 ISA (although I can't access it for a year).

The online application isn't specific as to what stores/locations you want to work at. Apparently they determine that later on based on the city.      I received an email invitation to attend a hiring fair on Monday, February 23. I went, and spent 4.5 hours sitting in a conference room among about 20 other people, waiting for an interview with one of 3 managers (I think they were corporate people) that were doing the interviews. They do hiring fairs every Monday, apparently. I was called for my interview, finally. Then the issue was that I am a former Circuit City employee. One of my district managers for Circuit City now works for RadioShack - so I was pushed off to have my interview with him, for that reason. I was asked again to come in on Monday March 2nd. I went in, talked with him, and everything went fine. He told me I'd get a call in 2-3 days as to how to further the process and to fill out paperwork and such. But no call as of yet. Maybe I'm just being a little impatient, but I'm wondering if anyone else has gone through this process?  I'm planning on calling if I don't hear anything by later on today, but I was just wondering.  They seem to hire rather often - in fact, in the city that I'm...RadioShack posts Full-Time and Part-Time openings every day or two on various large job boards.

Hey guys just need a little advise from you pros out there. I think (or hope) that I have the keyword research area down but I need some advice to see if i am doing this right.       I was strolling through sitepoint.com and was looking for a good niche to dive into and came across the niche "acai berry" to I did a quick look on the amount of hits this exact keyword recieved and its around like a 18,000 or so but the competition is in the millions so i looked down the list and found another longtail keyword which was 'acai berry juice' and it recieved like 989 hits per day and only has like 266,000 pages of competition. I decided to launch my attack that this level. The only issue that I have with this is that the number of daily hits for any sub keyword for 'acai berry juice' tappers off quickly. I mean the only other sub keyword that has a good amount of daily hits is 'acai berry juice benefits' that gets around 155 hits per day and only about 961 pages of competition so I figure I'd hit a gold mine but the only problem is that everything below that sub keywords only get hits in the single digits or teens.      Did I dig to deep into this niche to wrap my site around? Should I have moved a little more broad to a term like 'acai berry' ?       Thanks for any advice on the whole keyword research you can shed my light on.      I'm not concerned about this site being competed against as i only launched this site as a test so see if i could get some traffic to this site regardless of making $$$$      PM if you would like...I hope I am doing this right...          hxxp://bestacaiberryjuice.blogspot.com...

20090305064859AAsMoRu	Business & Finance;Other - Business & Finance	Who owns, profits and/or are shareholders in the Bank of England?	I've been trying to find this out but its very hard. The BoE states it is a a public sector institution, wholly-owned by the government, but accountable to Parliament.      However, the bank does have the ability to create money, and further more it does make a profit. So where does that profit go?      I checked the BoE financial statements for 2008 which gave some clues:    http://www.bankofengland.co.uk/publicati...       INDICATION OF SHAREHOLDERS:   - "The Bank provides several services to its shareholder, HM Treasury, and to other Government departments and bodies"      - "Profit for the year attributable to the shareholder: ￡161 million"      - "The Bank’s holdings in any particular institution may change from time to time as part of realignments of holdings among the shareholders and participants."      INDICATION NOT ALL PROFITS GO BACK INTO PUBLIC HANDS:   - "The overall effect is that the Bank and HM Treasury will normally share Banking Department’s post-tax profits equally."      - "The Bank of England Act 1946, as amended by the Bank of England Act 1998, requires the Bank to pay HM Treasury, in lieu   of dividend on the Bank’s capital, on 5 April and 5 October, a sum equal to 25% of the Banking Department’s post-tax   profit for the previous financial year or such other sum as the Bank and HM Treasury may agree."      From what I can read only 25% of the BoE profits go back into public hands. Where do the rest of the profits from printing money go?

20090305075150AAwwpIk	Business & Finance;Credit	Need advice for dealing with Collect Corp...being harassed about a credit card?	Had a credit Card with Chase (I'm in NJ). The card was 'charged off' last week and written off as 'bad debt'. They referred my account to Collect Corp. Chase told me to negotiate with them and if we can't come to a settlement they will take the account back and refer it to another collection agency and this will go back and forth until it's paid. We called Collect Corp. yesterday to try to negotiate and they told us they did not have our account. Then later that night they called us demanding payment of $15000 immediately and that we were to take money from family if we didn't have it. My husband told them we didn't have it and we'd call them back. Later that night they called and talked to me...they told me to get a lawyer, that I was stealing, that I was a terrible person and should be ashamed for the awful things I have done and that they would be calling my employer to garnish wages. The debt is not even in my  name for starters and I am a stay at home mom. They lied to me repeatedly saying my husband agreed to things he didn't and then he said he would "harass the  hell out of  me until I come to grips and make right for the awful things I've done". My husband was laid off last year and we just haven't been able to afford credit card payments...we can barely feed our kids and he's telling me I'm awful for not paying my credit card on time.   I want to pay this debt. I have a small amount from my tax refund I'd like to pay them off with. They will not negotiate. All they do is yell at me and harass me.   Has anyone worked with them? Does anyone have advice?? We did have another card that we settled quite easily. This just seems wrong to me.   Thank you all very much in advance!!
20090305063802AAM4Vvc	Business & Finance;Personal Finance	Mortgage payments only paying on interest?	Hello.      Someone I know is dealing with a problem, we will call her Jenny for privacy reasons.   Jenny's interest rate is so high that her monthly payment is, no joke, 100% interest.    She have tried! to refinance but because of self employment they will not accept her income, only her husbands as income. They are making their payments just fine, once in a while a bit late within a grace period.      But over the last year doing taxes, as surprising as it sounds, not a single penny was paid onto the principle amount. It was all 100% interest.      I have never heard of this happening to anyone, and tried researching the problem on the internet and found nothing...      Can anyone share some insight on this?   I do not know how much the home is worth, I know their mortgage is more than the value of the home currently. I also know that after 8years, they still owe pretty much the entire thing due to this interest issue.      But from comments made I gather their payments are between 800-1200 a month but I am unsure of all the personal details.       Jenny also recently spoke to their bank, and the banker would not talk to her. The banker made a comment after looking into the issue "you have no mortgage" he looked horrified as he said it, and refused to give Jenny any more info. We haven't a clue what is happening.

I have lived in more than one Apt with different people and I can tell you we have never recieved a letter like this because we waited until the last 30 days.

I own stock in a pink sheets company and the stock value, unfortunately is down to $.02. I have heard through the grapevine, that the CEO who owns 170 Million shares of the total 200 milllion shares, is considering merging with a larger private company who would like to be listed publically. The problem is, that we believe he is going to announce a merger and he will supposedly have sold his stock holding to the company for approximately $2 million, while not giving the existing public shareholders any cash, they just get to keep their stock at what it currently trades at which is only $.02!       1. I would like to know if this is legal?       2. Doesnt the CEO have to have this merger company offer the existing public shareholders the same price per share to sell?       3. Isnt the CEO required to have a shareholder meeting to discuss a corporate structural change before it happens?       4. And finally, Isnt the CEO's fiduciary responsiblity, (who is also one of only two Board members), to us as the shareholders and wouldnt he be required to conduct a shareholder vote?....even though he as the single largest shareholder would certainly pass the merger vote, but doesnt his legal responsiblity require him to notice all shareholders of a vote before this merger can just HAPPEN, and then he tells us in a press release?       THANK YOU FOR ANY HELP IN ANSWERING THIS, AS WE ARE ALL SMALL SHAREHOLDERS AND WORRIED THAT THIS CEO IS DOING THINGS ILLEGALLY AND IT WILL MAKE OUR STOCK WORTHLESS.

I have been on a debt payment plan for 6 months, but withdrew after I found out I could be paying less interest than with the credit counseling agency. I also thought the $50 monthly fee was a waste of money that could be going towards the debt. I contacted one of my credit card companies, Discover, and they offered me an internal payment plan that was more than the minimum payment, lower interest than with the counseling agency, and I agreed and am using that. With Chase, I called and they offered either a monthly payment program, and he also told me they would settle for 60% of the debt, so the $2700 I owe would be $1600, and I could make 4 monthly payment and be done with it. Should I do this? What are the pros and cons? I can make the 4 payments financially. I'm not worried about my credit report, I have no need for financing, I've changed my spending habits and have used cash only for 8 months now. I just want to put this debt behind me. Tips? Thanks!

20090305070531AAczRrp	Business & Finance;Personal Finance	I need some help.....?	Ok, here are my two options. I am pregnant, I have a job with benefits. I have 3yr old son. I will not be able to continue work after the baby is born b/c 1) we can't afford child care for two and 2) we can't afford the health insurance for two.       I can either continue to work until I have the baby, and apply for medicaid for the kids then. with this option, it will be alot harder to get medicaid, b/c the income limit is a lot lower. this is the safest route, though. But I will probably not be eligible for medicaid for kids.      OR      I can quit my job during my pregnancy, apply for mini COBRA to continue insurance until I find out if I'm eligible for medicaid, which I should be, but if not, i can be added to my husband insurance (with no lapse in coverage, it would cover my pregnancy) This way, if I'm eligible for medicaid, I will be guarateed coverage up until six wks after labor, adn my baby will be covered for the first year. If i'm not, no harm no fowl. I will be covered under my husbands insurance, and we will just have to look at other options for health care. The risk is that in between time. (appying for medicaid and getting approved) I'm not really sure how COBRA works, I'm not even sure how to apply for it. All I know is if you have a lapse in coverage, they can consider your pregnancy as pre existing (from one group ins to another, with medicaid it doesn't matter)       I'm not trying to scam the government, I just feel that if I can qualify, why not?! I cannot imagine leaving my 6wk old baby with a stranger while I work all day. Only seeing my newborn for 2hrs a day. It's just not happening.       My plan is to return to work after about a year. So I will only need this assistance from medicaid for the kids for that one year.      should I take the risk and quit early, which guaratees the coverage I need, or work until labor?

I know that big 4 accounting firms have direct bill pay for Becker if you have a job lined up or work for them, but I want to study for the CPA early, during grad school.  So if I pay for it now (with my money), do big 4 firms reimburse for the costs when I eventually get a job? Also, I assume the answer for this will be the same for the cost of taking the CPA exam correct?

20090305074949AAi8pIz	Business & Finance;Taxes;United States	I have a big tax issue with the states CA & AZ, please help?	Every year of my life, I've always gotten something back from taxes from both Fed & State. One year, I had been transferred to AZ from CA with my company. That year's taxes were done by my mom. Both states claim I owe in excess of $1000 for this year. Nothing else significant changed in this year other then I had lived in both CA & AZ. I did talk to a rep for the State of CA and she mentioned that we may have filled out the incorrect forms??       The year's since this, I have continued to receive money back every single year. It doesn't make sense that I owed $2000 one year, right?      So far, I haven't been able to get much help. I don't have the paperwork from that year, so I don't know how to "re-do" it. What can I do and who can I talk to?

20090305075431AAZGyeM	Business & Finance;Renting & Real Estate	What qualifies as a Home Owners title insurance claim in Baltimore City?	I purchased an investment property in Baltimore City, Maryland. The person I purchased the home from was a person that performs rehabs.  When I purchased the house I was told that the home had been through a complete rehab.  I have since found out that the seller performed electrical, plumbing, and structural work to the home without following the permit process.  Baltimore City has revealed to me that the home has condemnation/building code violations notices that are active.  The city has advised me that the seller was made aware of the violations and that as part of the rehab process he should have pulled permits and had the work being performed inspected and approved by city building inspectors.  It has since been brought to my attention that he did not do it because he wasn't performing work in accordance to code standards.  I have been told that as part of the title search process Baltimore City requires lien certificates to be pulled.  I was told that the settlement company should have pulled this lien certificate and revealed the open violations to me prior to settlement. This wasn't done, so does this qualify as a title insurance violation claim, because I purchased Owners title insurance.  What are title search requirements for Maryland?

Larry Kudlow and Rick Santelli especially are getting on my nerves with their constant whining and complaining. They complain about everything that the Obama administration does and blame them everytime the market drops.      When the crisis started back in September, they supported the Bush administrations effort to bailout of the banks with government loans and Fed intervention. Now they complain that the government is too involved.      They complain that the government is spending too much money and with their next breath, they complain that that the government has yet to purchase the toxic assets off the banks books at face value (estimated $1-$2 trillion cost).      They seem to add nothing to any debate about the problems except to yell over the top of anyone that is trying to make a point.
