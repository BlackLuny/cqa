Good schools in Northeast district, great schools in Alamo Heights.|`|nF9DZ0sOaa	A bit on the slower side than most major cities.  San Antonio loves its parties, though (Fiesta is a good example.)  Still, it is a city, the 7th largest in the nation.  There's a lot to do and see, not only in San Antonio but in the immediate area.

hPdEZ4Ypaa	Not knowing your exact circumstances, I'll suggest a few places on the ship to 'hook up': Pool area, Piano Bar, Outdoor Promenade, Lobby Bar, If you're looking for someplace to be kind of alone, the sports deck at night works pretty good, most ppl are in the big theatre watching all that chorus line crap. Also the video game room is usually deserted in the evenings. There are many outdoor spaces up on top that are practally deserted in the evenings, for instance, the mini golf area, the funnel deck, the area near the water slide.|`|c22cd3bc80b769e97ac9ae2bc60d368eaa	Heck, me & my buddy both scored before we left the dock!  It was that way the whole cruise!  Even at de-embarkation!|`|X6rFPI2laa	It really depends on what you mean by "hook up", but assuming you mean to meet someone of the opposite sex . . .   single women seeking older men with money can do well at the casino in the late evening; under-30's can do well at the nightclub/disco; etc.  A lot depends on what ship you are on, and the general atmosphere of the ship.  Some people hang out at the pool and sit on the edge with their feet in the water, and that seems to be pretty good, too.

I buy $10.00 worth of international time and at $0.09 cents a minute to most places in MX.

Then we set times to call each other so she's at the phone when I call her or vice-versa.<br>  Clear, fast, free connections....can't beat it.....|`|fkHBVn7taa	it depends, if you are calling from a cell phone you can just call customer service and turn on the international calling feature- -- should not cost extra but you still will be charged by the minute for the time.  <br>  <br>  if you are calling at home you most likely don't need a phone card. depends if you have long distance or not  but it would be cheaper if you had a phone card.|`|3On6bCgfaa	Make sure you do not call with out a phone card because it can cost a lot. I recommend purchasing a phone card. I go to JBphonecards.com they have many cards to call Mexico. They have a rank list with the best phone cards to call each country. It is base off Time, Quality, and Ease of Use.|`|yyf5N7Ogaa	Depends on your long distance calling plan. Try calling 011 52 plus the number, and see what happens.

f8aa8e21997cfa7908574dfa12f124cdaa	My friend, my advice, take train. From Philly, you can take SEPTA Regional Rail R7 from the 30th Street Station to Trenton.<br>  <br>  Once at Trenton, transfer to NJ Transit's Northeast Corridor Line. Take the northbound train from Trenton to Penn Station New York.<br>  <br>  The one way fare from Philly to NYC is $20.50 ($8 on SEPTA, $12.50 on NJ Transit). Purchase you ticket before boarding at both 30th Street and Trenton.<br>  <br>  Good luck|`|2EVoNHHbaa	The cheapest way by train is to do the following:<br>  <br>  --From 30th Street Philadelphia, take the SEPTA R7 to Trenton<br>  <br>  --At Trenton, change to the New Jersey Transit train to New York City, getting off at Newark if you prefer.<br>  <br>  This way, although taking longer than Amtrak, is a lot cheaper.|`|znJAF69Zaa	bus is cheaper but it is longer. Train is better
eawNH4kkaa	Wow! I don't know where you've been reading your info from, but it is incorrect.  The locals there are great.  Probably the worst thing you'll have to worry about are the vendors on the beach trying to get you to buy their stuff (crafts, souvineers, drugs, food, etc), but if you tell them no thanks, they are cool.<br>  <br>  As far as what to do with the kiddies, ask the locals.  They can give you ideas, and some will even be glad to arrange tours for you.  Just know this is the way some of the Jamaicans make their money, so hook em up with some cash for their time and suggestions.

2wyDALHgaa	Why ask this question of Canadians.  These stereotypes are not made by us.  They are based on the observations, right or wrong, of others.|`|4INE794zaa	Stereotypes are just something the ignorant always fall back on. I would like to assume most Canadians don't think all Scotsman wear kilts all the time, but I am sure there are a few out there that do.

Vz5vjAWRaa	Best bet is to cool the casinos and ask, some casino open pools earlier then others.|`|NS9yqfT6aa	If you want to get on a guestlist, you will need to reserve a table, but on the hottest nights they may overbook.  Tables run anywhere from $50-300 and also require you buy a bottle, usually a two bottle minimum per group of three, least expensive bottles can run from $250-450.<br>  If you just want to get into the club, get there early and get in line, the hottest nights usually have about an hour to two hour wait, but you'll eventually get in, as the night goes on, the line gets longer.  If you go during the week, waits will be much less and prices for tables/bottles will also go down.<br>  If you stay at the hotel where you'll be clubbing, often they will discount admission in the clubs or allow front of line.<br>  Last resort, if you throw the doorman $100-200, you should be able to get front of line as well.<br>  Some pools open as early as March, your best bet is to call the hotel and ask, they'll tell you.  For sure, the hours will be minimal (like 12-4 during the week).<br>  <br>  Hope this helps, Good Luck and have fun!!|`|HYoUVfBYaa	you can try <a href="http://cheapvegasclubs.com/" rel="nofollow">http://cheapvegasclubs.com/</a> they got me in everywhere.

jHEs8KhAaa	The sun is very different in Cuba than what you are used to.  Cuba is close to the equator which means the sun rays are going to be stronger.  I would recommend you go to a tanning salon and get a "base" tan before you just show up to Cuba and start tanning because if you burn easily you will bake in Cuba.  How tan you get will depend on if you put on sunscreen or sun tan lotion.  My advice.... go to a tanning salon by your house.  Tell them you are going to Cuba and want a base tan.  They will take it from there and help you.  Then they also have all kinds of sun tan/screen products that you can buy that will help you out when you are there.|`|CW8tJeUJaa	March is not the hottest time, but you would still burn if you are not used to this heat,Use the highest factor for the first few days keep out of the sun between 12 and 3pm or cover up. be careful on the beach as you will feel the breeze and you will not think you are getting the sun, this is where most people burn, like some one said try to get a base tan first ,but do not rely on this being the answer as you will still burn,common sense and you should be fine.|`|HziXc5Ovaa	You need to start slowly. Make sure your SPF is high the first couple of days as your skin gets used to the sun. Take your breaks and try not to be in the sun during the highest peak hours. Keep yourself hydrated (and I don't mean with alcohol...you'll make yourself sick in the sun).<br>  Start with a 30 SPF, then work to a 15, then 8 if you wish...but stay at 15 and reapply often. Basically, the difference in the numbers is the frequency of applications. DON'T SKIMP ON THE APPLICATIONS. Always reapply after being in the water and sweating. <br>  Be careful because the sun is very hot...and you'll burn easily when in the water too. <br>  Most sunscreens are good....there are spray lotions for hard to reach areas too. Coppertone, Banana Boat, Bain de Soleil are good products, to name a few.<br>  <br>  Take aloe vera with you to apply on your skin everyday...also I recommend pure emu oil. It works great for any kind of burns or skin sensitivities.<br>  <br>  You can get tanned but if you're only going for 7 days, you'll basically just be getting a base tan and might be still a little on the 'red' side of the tan. You'd need another 7 days to get a really deep tan...especially if you burn easily. It's necessary to start slow and carefully.<br>  <br>  Just be smart and don't force a tan. You will probably hurt yourself.<br>  <br>  Have lots of fun and enjoy the beach!|`|vl6OtBfWaa	The chemicals used in sunscreen are far more dangerous than the sun .  The sun is bio and natural.  Sunscreen is a horrible chemical concotion that will soon be proven to be as dangerous or more so than sun exposure.<br>  <br>  Limit your time in the sun and make sure you dont burn.  When you are red you will burn.<br>  <br>  Use common sense not horrible chemicals.|`|L1HVLylMaa	As somebody says here, stay home and get the tan there

RzBNps1Laa	Red Box is not a karaoke bar per se, where people go onstage and take turns with the mic while the whole "bar" is watching and drinking beer.<br>  <br>  They have individual rooms where people can sing and have fun privately with their friends and family (wholesome fun, of course).  The room size varies, and they give out rooms depending on the number of people in a group.<br>  <br>  They have specific schedules, and schedules have different rates.  They let people in by batches (e.g. 3pm-7pm batch, then 7pm - 12 midnight batch).  If you and you're friends choose to go in the afternoon, it would be cheaper than if you were to go in the evening (i.e. happy hour).  They charge per person.  The last time my friends and I were there (January 2009), we chose to avail of the 3pm-7pm schedule, and we paid around 200-250 pesos (I forgot, sorry).  So it'll cost you $5, more or less (if you choose the 3pm-7pm time frame).  You'll get 2 drinks each, and you can choose among the local beers (for people aged 18 and up), iced tea, or dalandan juice.  Food is separately ordered, and costs around 100-200 per dish.  I think for one of the batches/time frame, instead of 2 drinks, there's an eat all you can promo (this is around lunch time, i think).  It'll be better if you check the place yourself.<br>  <br>  Inside the rooms, there are usually 2 screens (one for the sing along and one for choosing the songs so you can reserve songs even if someone else is singing), the box that controls the karaoke, the remote that controls the box, and 2 mics.  <br>  <br>  Red Box is pretty okay.  Even families go there. :)<br>  <br>  Hope this helps.|`|AVCSn5EHaa	i know one thing.<br>  <br>  ITS EXPENSIVE!

But you can get to Union station (Toronto). The earliest bus from Square One leaves at 6:30am and should take you into Toronto in about half an hour.<br>  <br>  See here for the schedule: <a href="http://www.gotransit.com/publicroot/en/schedule/pubsched.aspx?table=21&direction=0&day=6&page=1&new=" rel="nofollow">http://www.gotransit.com/publicroot/en/s...</a><br>  <br>  You'll need to pay an extra fare ($2.75) to transfer onto the TTC. The subway is up an running just after 6am. So, once you get to Union station, take the subway up to either Finch station or Downsview station (closer to York U). The subway trip should take you about 30 minutes or so.<br>  <br>  Here's a map of the subway: <a href="http://www3.ttc.ca/Subway/interactivemap.jsp" rel="nofollow">http://www3.ttc.ca/Subway/interactivemap...</a><br>  <br>  From either Finch or Downsview station, take the #106 York University bus going northbound.

OKDydyJFaa	am currently residing in Vancouver, and like you, I immigrated to canada a couple years ago. You will find that the cost of living in Vancouver is very high, but there are still tons of job opportunities. BC's economy currently stands the strongest in Canada, and it is very unlikely that you would be unemployed for a long time. Homes are probably the peak in terms of cost of living: the average detached home in Vancouver is valued at 600,000 dollars. You can rent a 2 or 3 bed condo in Downtown for about 2000-2300 a month. Vancouver also currently has the most expensive housing market in Canada. In terms of weather, Vancouver is the warmest city in Canada and its winter shouldnt be a problem for you. The temperature is usually between 30F - 50F (0C - 5C) during the winter, so no colder than New York City, Philadelphia or Boston, and 30F being the coldest. It rarely snows, maybe only 3 times a year. However, it does rain A LOT here, and i would reccomend getting some rainjackets and umbrellas. The summer here is awesome, sun until 10pm and 80-100F (25 - 35C) weather. Public transport is incredibly efficient, probably one of the best systems in North America. Buses come by about every 15 minutes, depending where you live, and the skytrain system connects the downtown to the rest of the city. The seabus crosses from downtown to North/West Vancouver in 15 minutes, and you are even allowed to bring bikes aboard. This city is very eco-friendly and the transport is so good, my advice would be to wait on buying a car. So choose VANCOUVER! you'll really find the city beautiful, and u have stuff like skiing 20 minutes from dowtown (Grouse mountain), good night life, and an extremely safe environment. The people are a lot friendlier too, since the weather is warmer I guess. o and dont go to eastern canada... winter is UNBEARABLE, so stick with western canada. Hope that helps|`|tHEBPDenaa	I live in Canada and I;m actually moving to England next week for a year to work... I know several people who live here in Canada, but grew up in England and they think I'm crazy for leaving Canada to go to England. Haha. So from what I've heard, Canada is a better place to live. There are hundreds of nice places to live in Canada so it;s hard to list specific cities or towns. The scenery is amazing everywhere however southern Ontario is the busiest and most developed area... That means there are most jobs in this area, but also less nature due to the infrastructure, highways, etc. However if you drive about an hour or so out of the city, you can find lots of nice national parks and hiking trails.<br>  <br>  I live in Toronto and it is a very nice city but I think you sound like you would like it better living out west in Vancouver (British Columbia) or the province Alberta. Alberta is where all the oil is so it's growing really fast and has tons of jobs! If I were you I would look into Vancouver, Edmonton and their surrounding areas. However, I think Vancouver is fairly expensive. It's rated in the top 3 or top 5 cities to live in the world, so I guess that makes sense. <br>  <br>  If you google images of Vancouver, British Columbia, or Alberta, I think you'll find that the scenery is amazing!<br>  <br>  And yeah, I agree with the other person who said not to live in Hamilton... it's where all the big factories are and it's gross. <br>  <br>  If you want good scenery and job opportunities look into British Columbia and Alberta! Good luck with your choice!|`|rDtl7aGdaa	40 per cent of professional and skilled immigrants leave Canada within 5 years<br>  <br>  Canadian HR Reporter<br>  March 27, 2009<br>  <br>  By Shannon Klie<br>  <br>  While Canada does a good job attracting skilled and educated immigrants from around the world, government and businesses need to do a better job of keeping them once they get here, says a professor of economics at the University of Western Ontario in London, Ont.<br>  <br>  "We spend a fair amount of time and discussion on attracting immigrants, but we don't spend that much time on talking about retaining them. It's almost as if there's the notion that if they can get here, it's such a great place, they'll stay," said Chris Robinson.<br>  <br>  Immigration isn't a permanent phenomenon and Canada needs to approach it as a firm would approach retaining an employee, he said. "We don't want to take it as a given that just because somebody's come here that they're going to stay."<br>  <br>  One-third of young male immigrants leave Canada within 20 years of arriving and more than 60 per cent of those who leave do so in the first year, according to Return and Onward Migration among Working Age Men, a recent Statistics Canada report co-authored by Robinson.<br>  <br>  The report, a study of male immigrants aged 25 to 45 at the time they arrived in Canada, found that over the past two decades business professionals and skilled workers, the most desirable immigrants, are the most likely to leave, with 40 per cent of them leaving the country within 5 years of arrival.<br>  <br>  Because there are no exit interviews when an immigrant leaves Canada, the study made inferences about why they left based on landing records, census data and income tax filings. Immigrants who arrived during poor economic climates (in 1980 and 1990) were more likely to leave than those who arrived during boom times (1986 and 1996). Therefore, it's likely immigrants are leaving for better opportunities elsewhere, said Robinson.<br>  <br>  The best way to keep these immigrants is to ensure they get jobs that match their skills and experiences, said the director of operations at the Toronto Region Immigrant Employment Council.<br>  <br>  "We know that good employment is the number one indicator of successful integration for immigrants," said Elizabeth McIsaac. "A key element in all this is having employers involved in the development of programs that are intended to bring immigrants into the labour market."<br>  <br>  One such program is Toronto's Career Bridge, a non-profit internship program that matches qualified immigrants with appropriate jobs. Since the program started three years ago, 270 immigrants have found full-time work in their fields, but there are still 1,500 skilled immigrants, more than half with university degrees, on the waiting list. So far only 115 of the city's 2,760 businesses with more than 100 employees have signed up for the program.<br>  <br>  HR professionals need to begin looking at international credentials and education as an asset, said McIsaac. There are tools available to help HR understand international credentials and agencies that can connect employers with immigrants, so employers have no excuse not to consider immigrants for job openings, she said.<br>  <br>  "Once you begin to have more experience working with immigrant communities, it becomes a lot easier and you can do it a lot better," she said.<br>  <br>  If Canadian employers aren't willing to take advantage of these immigrants, the Statistics Canada report proves they'll go elsewhere to find jobs, said Robinson.<br>  <br>  "If a better opportunity comes up somewhere else and it happens to come up across an international border, then they're quite likely to move," he said.<br>  <br>  Over the next 10 years, immigration will represent all of the growth in Canada's workforce because there simply won't be enough young Canadians to replace retiring baby boomers. However, Canada isn't the only country facing a looming labour shortage and other countries that haven't typically gone after immigrants, such as Japan and India, are now doing so, said McIsaac.<br>  <br>  "We are in a global economy and we are competing for a high level of talent in other countries," she said. "We have to do a better job of receiving that talent."|`|YMTGEz4vaa	Well since you love nature, definitely try Calgary, Alberta. Or if you want to move to British Columbia, then over there try Vancouver or Kelowna.<br>  <br>  All those three cities are perfect for what you're looking for, especially considering the field you want to work in.<br>  <br>  Good luck and I hope you choose Canada! It's a beautiful country-and I'm not just saying that because I live here! :-)|`|LNdvERqDaa	england is better financially ...but i think Canada is much nicer in terms of landscape and scenery.

Year 2008 was the first time in the last 18 years when they actually demonstrated military equipment, such as tanks, airplanes, etc. in the history of modern day Russia. <br>  Here is the link to see last year's parade broadcast: <a href="http://www.vesti.ru/videos?vid=131428" rel="nofollow">http://www.vesti.ru/videos?vid=131428</a>  <br>  Whether you are a Russian citizen or a foreigner you need to have an Invitation/Ticket to get into the Red Square to watch the parade.  Too many people want to see it and not enough space for all.  So many Russian citizens prefer to watch direct broadcast on TV.  However, you can go to a military parade in a different city and won't need any Invitation.<br>  Good luck!|`|5dBp23y1aa	Why not?Just buy ticket on Parade,thats all.|`|lO83ZvrZaa	Yes. Have fun, its really cool. Just nestle in with the crowd and don't speak English. They'll never notice.|`|1ce25e71aa4dd2eb1e82121617a06b87aa	It's put on for you!<br>  <br>  Why not?|`|4yg7zZZ2aa	Yes. Of course. Just make sure to have a ticket. <br>  <br>  Michelle : I don't even know you. You think because you are American I would hate you on that reason alone? No, what I dislike are lies and inductive fallacies.
zBWefnYHaa	Outside the city centers the roads will be tarmac or concrete, near the city centers sometimes brick, but only in the centers itself cobblestone, as cobblestone is expensive to buy and to place and selling the stones is covering the cost of resurfacing in tarmac, which is cheaper to maintain too.<br>  You will not want to drive in the city centers, as parking is almost impossible to find and very expensive, traffic is often blocked or driving even completely forbidden, but those areas are small.<br>  <br>  The smaller roads between villages may still have a cobblestone surface, sometimes under a thin layer of tarmac, but as tourist you are unlikely to spend much time on those, and they are very rare to begin with.<br>  <br>  The modern cobblestone road surfacing you will find in most of the European cities is not hard to walk on, only the older traditional  areas still have the more bumpy kind. Although the years or even centuries of use will have smoothed the worst bumps.<br>  Walk on sensible shoes, not high heel ones and no stiletto heels of whatever height, and you will not have problems, although, with the name James I guess you will not wear stiletto heels anyhow.|`|kfMcRr1Vaa	you will be fine as long as you wear sensible shoes and they are not that bumpy anyway|`|jZaIN9oiaa	Walking around should be fine as long as you are not wearing shoes with a stilleto heel. I wore stacked heels on coblestone streets in Greece and was able to walk quickly without having any problems. However, tennis shoes are by far the best shoes to wear if you will be doing a lot of walking aorund. As for driving I'm sorry but I do not know.

If you have  liquids though, they'll need to be removed and put in a clear ziploc bag they will give you. The liquid containers can't have more than 3.4oz (100ml). Have a fun trip!
vTra7n5baa	No, you would be in the transit zone (or "No Man's Land") and simply have to go through security to get your flight.  The USA is one of the few countries in which you have to go through customs for ALL kinds of travel.  There won't be that many stores, unless Narita is still being remodeled, and most may not accept US Dollars.  Just use your credit card in case this hasn't changed yet.

You can bring a little travel bag and just touch yourself up in the bathrooms..

PMRp2ZRlaa	I don't know much about ivory, but for the water buffalo horns, you can do a lot of things. They used to make tools to make fishing net (kind like a big needle). Knife handles as mentioned above. Also different kinds of ornaments since the horn is similar to a hard plastic. I remember some ornaments such as flower vase , whales, spoons, and all kinds. And all this ornaments lasts for a life time.|`|AA10254694	They still make ornamentals from horn.<br>  They probably sell the Elephant to China.|`|8d490a9699435968438c6cd3406219d5aa	Buffalo horn is not ivory. So has no restriction placed on it. It is often used to make ornaments and such things like knife handles. Not sure what happens to ivory, but having lived in Thailand over 14 years now, I'll bet it is not discarded.|`|AA11691241	They hollow them out and make ornate drinking straws for Big Gulp Slurpees.

vTra7n5baa	That depends on your flight pattern and where you're coming from.  If you're coming from North America, stopping in Japan, Korea or Taiwan (very underrated) would all be possible and unique experiences.  There are many flights from Taipei to HKG that are cheap.  If you're a citizen of a western country you don't need tourist visas to these places.<br>  <br>  If you're coming from Europe, Thailand, Malaysia or Singapore would be great.  They are more tropical and international than Northeast Asia.  Lots of flights go to HKG from there as well.  You wouldn't need a visa to these places either as a Western tourist.<br>  <br>  I would have said China, but the hassle of a visa may not be worth it if you're just doing a stop over.|`|c353de654d51fd85a622ff807bf097f0aa	It all depends on your sense of adventure and what sorts of environments you prefer. In Japan and South Korea in the major cities you will feel like you are in a major U.S. city and you will enjoy the same ammenities, shopping as well as newer more advanced technology and things you may have never seen before. China is modernizing itself but again that is more visible in the bigger cities. And while I found many people to be friendly in these three particular countries I must say unequivocally there are many pickpockets in China and people may stare at you constantly, so if that bothers you rule out China. If you are thinking to go to interior China research it thoroughly and go with a reputable tour group, not alone because you will get robbed.Just remember one thing, no matter where you go always smile, be polite and respectful especially if you can't speak the language.|`|49afe7fb4216adf3acff6d2f20b3c7ddaa	Well in my opinion, I think every country has its uniqueness. But since you are going to Hong Kong which is practically China, maybe Thailand or Singapore would be nice. Japan and Korea is somewhat similar to Hong Kong as being very crowded, bright lights everywhere and etc. If you want to experience the opposite of Hong Kong city life, then I would suggest Thailand and Sinapore. Although I've never been there.|`|iekMDUqVaa	They are all great countries to visit.<br>  but if you are one of those worried about budgets.<br>  Go research. You know, like plan where you mght want to visit once you are there.<br>  I would pick top two and do some research to find one place interesting in both countries for the research.<br>  hope i helped. have a fun trip. :)|`|VdfNcqgeaa	that depends on your color of skin, if you re a white, go to Korea, they will treat you carefully, and feel like a super star. but if you re not a white, Never go to Korea,  because they don't treat you as they do white,|`|qxdUzCCDaa	Korea (without a doubt!) <br>  and while you go to Hong Kong you have to go to:<br>  -Disney land (even if your grown up it is still fun)<br>  -Ocean Park<br>  -The street shops have amazing stuff!<br>  <br>  Have Fun! :)|`|Yb6dvevIaa	SOUTH KOREA =)<br>  Reason:<br>  Best Stuff<br>  Best Food (Yum..)<br>  Shopping<br>  Friendliest People<br>  Good Environment<br>  Just Awesome...|`|LLvrGJQsaa	If it was up to me, I'd pick to go to Japan.<br>  just because they have all the cool technology and cute toys <br>  and all that other school stuff. :]|`|cRoxosPfaa	korea and japan:)<br>  <br>  there are many beutiful places in japan and korea:)|`|hM5dEjn3aa	Korea, because you posted this in "Travel --> Korea" section.|`|TsB7ofdTaa	Japan <br>  see the colorful streets lol [=|`|WWVz3Jqvaa	KOREA X100,000,000 (south)|`|4IPwAr2naa	im korean & Korea is a GREAT place(:<br>  <br>  & theres a ton of friendly people.|`|GXoQbjbLaa	S.

B3FBgxjEaa	At the summit, Uhuru Point, the night time temperatures can range between 0 and -15 degrees Fahrenheit (-18 to -26 degrees Celsius). Due to Mount Kilimanjaro's great height, the mountain creates its own weather. It is extremely variable and impossible to predict. Therefore, regardless of when you climb, you should always be prepared for wet days and cold nights. <br>  <br>  Here is a 6 Day Weather Forecast for Mount Kilimanjaro at 5895 m altitude, <br>  issued (local time): 7 pm 21 Feb 2009<br>  <a href="http://www.snow-forecast.com/resorts/Kilimanjaro/6day/top" rel="nofollow">http://www.snow-forecast.com/resorts/Kil...</a><br>  <br>  Some more information<br>  <a href="http://www.ultimatekilimanjaro.com/mountain.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.ultimatekilimanjaro.com/mount...</a>
XChOmeqjaa	Sailed on Brillance of the Sea Nov. 2005 from Barcelona to Miami.  Wonderful weather but the captain did announce he had shifted course to avoid storms.  We loved our balcony (aft) and used it to the max  As for activities, some days at the beginning of cruise will have port stops, then usually 4 or 5 days of sea.  Lots of time to read, play cards, spa and make new friends.  We are booked this year on Carnival Dream 16 day transatlantic leaving Italy Oct. 27.  We have another aft cabin, so are hoping for good seas, but for us all days aboard are good days.  As for one way air, check out airline consolidators on yahoo or google.  Found a great rate to Rome for this fall.|`|94b8KImYaa	The transatlantic cruise will be either spring or autumn, so while you leave from either the US or Europe, in the beginning the weather will be normally warm enough for a balcony cabin. In the middle of the trip, it could get chilly and even stormy - yet to predict this is really difficult. Also the closer you get to land again, temperatures will rise. <br>  I have done crossings with wonderful sunny, warm weather all the way, and other where we got into a heavy storm, it was cold and rainy. <br>  <br>  There is entertainment going on during sea days, from cooking classes to lectures to games. <br>  <br>  I am not sure I understand about the flight. Are you saying, you would purchase a round trip to Barcelona and 2 cruises, the one which will take you to Barcelona from the US and the cruise back from Barcelona to the US in the fall? <br>  So you would do 2 transatlantic cruises in order to safe the money on the flight ticket ?|`|093c633e155de952249b95398f169e87aa	for all my cruise information and bookings i use www.vacationstogo.com i find their website very good to find information and great prices, especially last minute deals. also i find their experienced staff very helpful when i call them. on their website they list every cruise leaving every port to every destination in the world
keGOvavbaa	If you are a US citizen, you will not need a passport to cross the US-Mexico border by car until June 1, 2009, according to the link below.  Until then, your birth certificate and driver's license will be sufficient.|`|eY8MNX6baa	every us citizen or non citizen needs a passport on land borders. a birth certificate won't do, u need to get a passport. call the mexican consulate for more info..|`|818a6c4a96262d3d9669cd5c91b5efaeaa	You may use your birth certificate and photo I.D. only if you are an American citizen.  If you are a legal permanent resident...you must carry your green card and passport from your home country.  If you are a Mexican citizen , you need your Mexican passport to enter and green card to return to the U.S.  If your mother  is a Mexican citizen, but you are an American citizen, you should consider getting your Mexican citizenship...you  can do this thru the nearest Mexican consulate in the U.S.
Q3RqWHFsaa	Are you really non-native or native Japanese teacher? It seems your Japanese skill is somehow strangely anyway.<br>  <br>  Girl 1: Ano otokono-ko(because it is cute BOY, you'd use otokono-ko, not otokono-HITO) kawaikunai?<br>  That boy over there looks so cute, doesn't he?<br>  <br>  Girl 2: Hontoo kawaii<br>  Yeah definitely.<br>  <br>  Girl1: Demo ano otokono-ko wa gay dato omou.<br>  But I think he must be gay.<br>  <br>  Girl2: Uso deshoo? (Sore maji?)<br>  You are kidding?<br>  <br>  I think those sentences are not proper to sort of video project for official Japanese learning. Students must have much more things to learn.|`|Q2Hd6v6Faa	Girl 1: Demo, ano otokono hito wa tabun douseiaishya to omoimasu.<br>  But I think that boy might be homosexual. (tabun = maybe, douseiaishya = homosexual)<br>  <br>  Girl 2: taihen desunee!<br>  thats terrible! <br>  *(the literal translation is 'thats terrible!' but in the context, it is very similar to saying, 'bummer / bugger / thats bad luck' etc. there is no specific word for 'bummer')<br>  <br>  as a suggestion, you could then get the girls to turn around and say, 'he's even cuter, lets say hi!'<br>  <br>  translated:<br>  <br>  sono otokono hito wa totemo kawaii! (totemo = very)<br>  <br>  konnichiwa o hanashi ni ikimashyou! (hanashimasu = to talk / speak, ikimasu = to go, the mashyou ending = let's ... (go and say hello) )<br>  <br>  also, just another thing to note, 'kawaii' is cute, but in context it is more like, 'aww, isn't that a cute dog' rather than 'that boy is cute'. to say that a boy is goodlooking / handsome / cool, 'kakkoi' is a better word. that is what all the high school japanese girls use to say that a guy is cute.|`|15QLqt0haa	I think Schmexi 's suggestion gives you lot of clue.<br>  But just addition, <br>  "OTOKONO HITO" should be changed to "OTOKONO KO" .  "otokono hito" is for male adults and "otokono ko" is young boys or teenagers.<br>  <br>  As Schmexi mentioned "otokono suki to omoimasu" should be changed to "tabun ano otokono ko wa douseiaisya DATO omoimasu"<br>  And "kakkoii" might be better rather than "kawaii" as she suggested.<br>  <br>  Lastly, I checked my dictionary what "bummer" is in Japanese. it says  IYANA YATU / GAKKARI / CHIKUSYO / KUSOTTARE .<br>  Does it ring a bell?? =)

AmntnHCtaa	we don't get a sea breeze, we get a lake breeze. also, the lake causes snow, wind, rain, etc. which is called "lake effect". so the closer you get to the lake (ex. chicago, versus other towns) there will be greater chances of weird weather due to lake effect.|`|bmP4NdKuaa	hello - no we are not that close to any oceans we are in the middle of the nation - the midwest - yes we have a lake but it's not an ocean.<br>  <br>  we do get the occasional aftermath of a hurricane storm if that counts for anything -|`|3da28f1bbe5dc0fba1bd4efce35cfe4daa	Cocktail containing vodka with cranberry juice and grapefruit juice? <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  I'm sure you can get those in Chicago.  :)|`|TskZHzZyaa	No, but it gets a lake breeze.

zBWefnYHaa	In summer we traditionally ate more salads and more often potato, meat and one or two vegetable meals.<br>  In Winter more stews that require a longer cooking time, often with cabbage or onions,<br>  Curly cale, in Dutch Boerenkool, is a winter dish, as is Hutspot, (cooked together and mashed together Potato, carrots and onions,) Zuurkoolstampot, (boiled potatoes and sauerkraut mashed together,) Hachee, (Onions and beef cooked together for hours, served with boiled potatoes, not as mash this time.)<br>  Or Erwtensoep, (green split pea soup, again a good one requires 4 to 24 hours of preparation, served with rye bread with bacon when you eat it in a restaurant, at home it would be followed by thin pancakes.)<br>  With several of the mashed dinners smoked sausage would be the traditional meat, and it is again mostly a winter part of dinner.<br>  <br>  In our family no change in deserts for different seasons, but in winter my mother would often spend a little more time preparing sweets, as the mains would be on the fire for a longer time. <br>  And in summer she and my father would go to the allotment straight after dinner, to enjoy a couple of hours of sunlight outside.<br>  When we were still kids to young to stay home alone we would go with them, or we would even go straight out of school and eat dinner there, and those would always be simple to cook dinners with fresh from the garden vegetables, 30 minutes between picking the veg and eating it was common.<br>  In summer we also ate fresh summer fruit, with or without yoghurt or vla (custard pudding as an almost liquid,) in fall it would be fresh berries we picked ourselfs, like black berries, or those cooked to thick juices and jellies.<br>  <br>  Nowadays the differences between summer and winter food are smaller, with both parents working there is not as much time to prepare the traditional winter dishes and now fresh vegetables and fruits are almost as cheap in winter as in summer.<br>  And with central heating the houses are as warm in winter as they are in summer so the meals which give the extra enegy are also not as needed. <br>  <br>  In winter the drink for us children used to be homemade hot chocolate. The kind where you would stir cocoa powder, suiker and a little coffee cream together and then add hot milk, (almost boiling.)<br>  Sweet aniseed milk was also a winter drink, boil milk and add a sugar with aniseed lump, I guess the aniseed in there was oil, but as I never liked it I am not sure.<br>  In summer we would drink our milk cold, straight from the fridge, without additions. Or we would drink cordeals (sp?) the sweet drinks where you add 5 times as much water to get a lemonade (or other fruity mix.)

IGcS9K62aa	It depends on a number of variables. Exactly how you shipped it. Two day? Overnight? Standard?<br>  <br>  It also depends on how long it takes whomever you purchased it from to ship it. You should be provided with a tracking number--you can use that on the UPS website to track the progress of your package from shipping destination to your front door!! To be on the safe side allow at least 2-3 weeks.

94b8KImYaa	Most Uniforms on ships are polyester - or a high percentage of it is. This is for the Laundry to not spend hours in pressing. <br>  So I am assuming the men's Uniform for the Spa is the same. <br>  I do not like this kind of material either, however, got used to it. Plus there is so much A/C on the ship, that it is not that hot. <br>  Of course, not in the massage rooms....<br>  <br>  The uniform is not Steiner specific. It is cruise line specific. So if you are thinking of having your own Uniform made in a different material, you need to first know how the Uniform looks like, of the ship you would be going.

Are you going to fine them if they don't?<br>  <br>  If you want to see more youths displaying public courtesy behaviour, it has to start at home. Children growing up not knowing how to share, adopting a me, myself & I attitude that is not corrected by their parents & worst still, parents who accepts these behaviours as acceptable are the main cause of it all.<br>  <br>  And when these parents & children grow up as elderly, that's how they will be treated in the buses and trains.|`|GTAKIE9kaa	yes, in fact youth give up seat to the elderly, but from my obervation, please we have so many foreign people living here (they basically dun care) but we should also bear in mind that there are so many old man out there who have a "steel teeth' hokkein meant stubborn and refuse the seat offer to them (At least i had two similar occasion happen to me) So while we deeply encourage youth to give up seat to elderly we should also educate the old people out there not to be so stubborn and take the seat that is offer to them|`|lVjM2oPraa	Depends on the maturity of the youths.

36a3ynpJaa	No, Dominicans love American blacks and you should have a great time esp with the girls.  They discriminate against the Haitians who are much darker and very poor.  Black tourism is becoming very popular in the DR esp in Sosua for single guys.  The only people the Dominicans don't care for much are the Germans since they are notoriously cheap and disrespectful.  You may face some racism in some foreign owned hotels but not from the Dominicans.  <br>  <br>  One thing that is looked down on is anything gangsta culture, but you don't see much of that in the tourist crowd.  Dominicans are very concerned about dress and are more conservative than most cultures.   Most Dominican men wear long pants even on their days off even when it's 90 degrees out and sneakers are pretty much only worn only by kids.  If someone showed up in a do-rag and basketball gear, they would not be very welcome.<br>  <br>  The comment about "perejil" refers to a massacre that happened in the 30s under the dictator Trujillo.  He sent troops out to near the Haitian border and anyone would couldn't pronounce the word properly was hacked to death with a machete.  Haitians couldn't say the word.  Over 10,000 Haitians were killed during the purge.|`|Qt3Zqfviaa	I know you are smarter then that.<br>  <br>  Dominicans come in all colour, so does african americans. I am sure you will not face racism from the black dominicans.|`|59J4q4Uzaa	The first answer is right, Dominicans come in all colors, we're very very mixed and we have a little bit of every race, but anyway, dark/mixed skin is the most common. Look, I'm Dominican, I lived there until the age of 15 and I was made fun of by classmates because I have dark/mixed skin color. I can't believe how everyone there used to say that I was ugly, and now people here in the US tell me all the time that I'm beautiful.<br>  Now I look back and realize how ridiculous it was. I believe it was more of a kid thing, but still not cool.<br>  <br>  I know there is discrimination in my country, there are places (malls, clubs) that would ask you to leave (or won't let you in) because of the way you're dressing or because of your skin color (this happens in some clubs only). Dressing ghetto is very much looked down and critiziced... it's stereotyping, I know, but really, it doesn't look cool there. Just don't do it.<br>  <br>  Those malls and clubs I told you about are highly criticized though. We're not racist, but of course you will find some morons who are.<br>  <br>  This will be on your favor: foreigners are charged more for admission to the aquarium and some museums, but sometimes the cashiers have in their minds that foreigners are always super white, blonde and with blue eyes, and if you have dark skin they assume that you're Dominican and charge you regular price :)<br>  <br>  <br>  Enjoy the DR!!! it is a beautiful place. People are nice and you will feel very welcomed.<br>  <br>  Those who said that we discriminate against haitians are totally wrong!<br>  <br>  Jose: loco, la botate.   <br>  Mr. asker, don't pay attention to Jose, the "Perejil" thing is like a Dominican inside "joke" but it isn't as funny anymore when told to foreigners.|`|ejelObdJaa	i dont think  so; we are all very nice to everyone if u are really nice to us... if u are goin to stay at a hotel then id say its a no because there are gonna be a lot of people that has ur skin color OR people are a lot lighter than u.<br>  <br>  btw dominican arent white... we are a tan color but there are obviously some exceptions and there are some really white and some really dark.. so in my opinion the skin color is not a problem<br>  <br>  <br>  have fun :]|`|IstwJtBraa	Don't worry about a thing.

People can discriminate against you in your own country so don't worry.  Just come and enjoy yourself.|`|FEAua3dxaa	No way!  There are many Dominicans who are dark skinned, as well as medium to white.  When Haitians in the D.R. are discriminated against, it's not because of color, it's for other reasons and that's a different story (there are very fair skinned Haitians, anyway).  There's no discrimination about color but just as in travelling to any country anybody, natives don't want to see people act in an ignorant way.  Do you know David Ortiz from the Boston Red Sox?  If not, look up a pic of him.  He's really dark, which comes to show that we come in all colors.  The fact that you're black American is okay, too.  Just act and treat people in a respectful manner and be kind and humble.<br>  <br>  Have fun!|`|FGia9WI7aa	Just practice your "R's" in case they make you say Perejil, or you might get yourself deported to Haiti.

f8accf9d2c8b11a0f3db34e06a24eb13aa	Well, travelling to Kenya with an 18 month old is do-able but not as simple as if you were travelling to a European country.You just need to be well prepared and know what to expect. Firstly, where will you be staying? In a hotel, hostel, home? What will yor main means of transport be - a car, public transport? What will you be doing in the 10 weeks? Will you be out sight seeing or stationed in one place. <br>  <br>  Your answers to the above will determine the type of preparation that you need to ensure you will be ok with your toddler. <br>  <br>  My contact details are on my website - <a href="http://www.my-kenya-guide.com/about-me-maggie-nguyo.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.my-kenya-guide.com/about-me-m...</a><br>  <br>   Call me and I will give you free advice.
CoRLwVhjaa	If she has a direct flight from LA to Melbourne it won't be a 19 hour flight - it will only be 15 hours (which is know is still quite long enough). I generally watch one or 2 of the movies and read a magazine and a book for a bit, then snooze. The plane flights are generally reasonably tedious, hence she should go prepared with things to read etc on the plane. You can generally see the planes in-flight movies on their web site - if there is 1 or 2 she wants to watch that might help ease her mind.<br>  <br>  To look for suitable sites just search the internet for "surviving long haul flights" or something similar.|`|040cc8e7ac5883494aa29a6e8ed08c64aa	I don't know about a website, but I recently made the trip from LA to Sydney... a 14 1/2 hour doozy.  Honestly, the best thing to do is sleep.  The time difference is killer, so get some sleep to be more awake during the trip.  A sominex or benadryl type medicine (1/2 dose does it just fine for me, at least) knocked me out fine.  It wasn't worth being awake, honestly.  Not much leg room and the guy in front of me wouldn't sit his seat up at all... anyway, back on topic...<br>  <br>  Take a book or two, a snack in case the service isn't that great, a camera, and some battery-operated entertainment, like a cd player or portable dvd player.  And something to make her sleep, because she'll be thankful for it when she wakes refreshed and only a few hours from Melbourne.<br>  <br>  You're right, though.  Once she gets in Oz and meets some people, and even the people she meets on the plane, she'll be right at home and at ease.  Hope that helps!
8eebad9df2544440d10c81a8c5e92189aa	Congratulations for keeping college in sight as you pursue your dream job.<br>  <br>  One advantage I can offer you, above others, is to be fluent in more than one language.  I see your native language is English, which is great because it is widely spoken, albeit at different tonal and quality levels, in the airline industry.<br>  <br>  However, to gain the advantage you seek you must learn a second, and perhaps third and fourth language fluently.  Objectively, you should meet the Level 4 rating for fluency.  This was conveyed to me at a job fair I attended a few years back; I think it was United or Delta that said folks who can reach that level of proficiency (or are already there) are easily top candidates for interviews, but won't automatically be hired (you still must pass that part of the process).<br>  <br>  I'm retired military and I took the Defense Language Aptitude Battery Test for Korean and scored low; but I have friends who scored at Level 3 and 4 and because of it, they were rewarded with extra pay.<br>  <br>  Learning Russian and German would be beneficial and if you could add Japanese or another Asian language, that would definitely give you an enormous advantage during the hiring process.<br>  <br>  As an alternative and to give being a F.A. a test drive, you could join the Air Force and specifically apply for a F.A. job only - don't accept anything else and walk out of the recruiter's office if he/she badgers you into considering something else.  Be firm and stand your ground.  That's what I did in order to get the job I wanted, I started to walk and the recruiter then gave me the job I wanted in the Air Force.<br>  <br>  Also, in the Air Force, you can go to college on Uncle Sam's dime, after you finish F.A. training, and if you can swing it, you may be able to attend language courses at Monterey, CA at the Defense Language Institute, where you can learn many languages and, hopefully, can become fluent in one or more of them.<br>  <br>  I'm merely suggesting you chat with the recruiter and you could ask him/her for references so you can speak with an Air Force flight attendent.  Keep in mind: you are not obligated in any way to join the military when you are seeking information.  Unless you sign a bonafide contract and take the oath, you are not in the military, so there is nothing to fear if you talk with him/her.   And if you feel you are being pressured by him/her to join, please contact me and I'll have a word with them - and their supervisor(s).<br>  <br>  So, in a nutshell, yes, learn those languages to the Level 4 (or better) of fluency and continue to earn your degree.  The degree is an insurance policy for you in case the F.A. career fails you; you can always fall back on your degree and manage the F.A.s if you so desire.<br>  <br>  Good Luck!!

One of the highlights is a huge tank with a transparent tunnel running through it so you can see the sharks, rays, and fish all around you.  It's like scuba diving without getting wet.<br>  <br>  Lahaina is a good place for sightseeing.  It has Hawaii's largest banyan tree -- which takes up a whole city block --, and a lot of historic buildings and ships, art galleries, and souvenir shops.  Bubba Gump Shrimp Company is a fun place to eat there, especially if you've seen Forrest Gump.  The waiters askk trivia questions about the movie and give out prizes.<br>  <br>  You can drive to the top of Haleakala (a 10,000 foot extinct volcano) to watch the sun rise.  If you're more adventurous, you can ride a bicycle down the mountain.<br>  <br>  You can see all the sights on the road to Hana.  It's a very scenic drive with lots of stops along the way where you can see beautiful waterfalls and tropical trees and plants.  You can even tour a lava cave.<br>  <br>  A luau is a fun way to get a feel for the culture and traditional food of Hawaii.  The pork cooked in a pit is so tender it falls right off the bone and practically melts in your mouth.

V58rYfEsaa	I think there is less parenting these days compared to 10-20yrs ago where the father was the sole worker/provider and mum stayed home to raise the kids and look after the home,,,where as in the more recent years its become the norm for BOTH mum and dad to go out to work to pay the mortgage and indulge in all the extra luxuries and the "must haves" to keep up with the Jones's (so to speak) and the kids are mostly left to their own devices which now day is proving to be a real concern as we look at the repercussions it has had on the youth of today and their behaviour towards the rest of society.<br>  Quite sad really.   I would much rather see it the way it was 10-20- yrs ago.

iwhNUjrqaa	Southwest is AMAZING. Its cheap, the flight attendants are really nice, and it has leather seats in coach =]. We always fly Southwest when given a chance, because one of its hubs is in the city we live. On www.southwest.com, you can get supergood deals. My recommendation is if you have flexible dates, travel on Tuesdays and Wednesdays because they have fares from $49.<br>  When choosing a flight, if under the "stops" section it just has a number, that means you stop in a city and don't get off the plane. If it says nonstop, thats  obvious. And if it has a three letter code, you change planes in that particular city. Direct Flights are good, nonstops great.

WUnEENDQaa	There is tons of stuff to do at Disney! My favorites are Epcot and Magic Kingdom. (i'm 14 also)<br>   At Epcot, you have all the countries. Italy, Morocco, France, America, China, Canada, Japan, Germany, Norway, and England. Some of the countries have short 15 minute shows about that country. Also, the big Epcot ball has a ride inside (not much of a roller coaster) that shows the past, present, and future of technology. Also they have a huge Coke store with cokes from around the world! <br>  At Magic Kingdom...well there's EVERYTHING to there! That is where the castle is, and there is tons of shops and stores to get souveniers from. On Main Street, they have the best Toll House cookies!! All the rides there aren't roller coasters, like the Winnie the Pooh ride, the Peter Pan ride, Dumbo, etc. Sadly, they got rid of the Electrical Parade at night, but there is still alot of other fun things to do!|`|5TN6AcDBaa	Well, if you don't stay at just Disney World, you could go to some other theme parks, like Bush Gardens in Tampa, and Sea World in Orlando.

AA10024451	The Disney Dining Plan comes in several different options. <br>  <br>  The basic plan includes (for each person on your reservation) 1 "snack", 1 "table service meal", and 1 "quick/counter service meal" for each night of your trip reservation. The "table service" meal means exactly that: you get to eat in any restaurant included on the plan in which you sit at your table, order your meal, and the waiter/waitress brings it to you. Currently for those meals, adults are only permitted the entree, desert, and a non-alcoholic beverage. The children (under 10) are allowed an appetizer with their meal. The "quick/counter service meal" simply means any of the available restaurants in which you walk up to the counter/register, look at the board above and order your food, then you're given your ticket and wait until the cast members behind the counter fill up a tray with your food, which you then pick up yourself and find a place to eat. A "snack" is anything from an ice cream bar at one of the sidewalk vendors to a bottled water to a piece of fruit. (The Disney Dining Plan has a checkerboard square icon that is purple and white. If you see that icon next to an item in say the candy shop or bakery, it means that item is permissible for redemption as a "snack".)<br>  <br>  With these plans, you can use any of them in any order you like. They will be charged to your account according to the resort card/key you are given when you check in to your resort. You can contact the front desk at any time and ask for the status of your dining plan credits. For example, even though the plan says you get 1 of each option for each day of your stay, if you want to use two table service options on one day and then two counter service options on another day, you can. <br>  <br>  There's also the Deluxe Dining Plan which I believes allows for 3 meals in a day. And there's the Dining Plan that includes alcoholic beverages. <br>  <br>  I believe I gave you the basic run-down of how the plan works. You can also refer to more detailed instructions at these links:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://allears.net/pl/packages.htm" rel="nofollow">http://allears.net/pl/packages.htm</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.intercot.com/infocentral/dining/diningplan/default.asp" rel="nofollow">http://www.intercot.com/infocentral/dini...</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://disneyworld.disney.go.com/vacation-packages/" rel="nofollow">http://disneyworld.disney.go.com/vacatio...</a>     (just click on each one that has the different dining plans)|`|JYtqx9dSaa	We went last year and got the deluxe dining plan and it is 3 meals and 2 snacks per person per day (ages 3 and up). Basically a snack is anything $4 and under ( snacks, or drinks) You get 3 meals a day and they can be any combination you want such as quick service (food court type meal) Or a table service. It was great for us because I didnt have to worry about what we were spending. It was a LOT of food and when we checked out we had about 30 meals and 45 snacks left between the 8 of us. We spent all our snacks and took them home with us. You can use 3 meals and 2 snacks every day or you can use 2 meals one day and bank the others which is good if you want to eat somewhere that requires 2 meals such as Cinderella's castle. I think it was a good deal just go online and look at the places that accept the plan. Almost all of the places will take it except for Rainforest cafe and the Downtown Disney area only has 1 place that will take it. We are going to go with the same plan this December when we go back.|`|41fFm6oOaa	If you like to eat A LOT it's a good deal. You pay for your meals upfront and can choose from many restaurants in the  theme parks, at Disney hotels and Downtown Disney. We did this years ago so the details are a little sketchy but I remember getting two snacks a day, lunch which included dessert, and dinner which included a full size appetizer, entree and dessert. You don't have to leave a tip since it's all included in your upfront cost. Way more food than the average person would normally consume in a day but if you're on vacation and you want to splurge it's a good deal.
VyJC1MNiaa	Their trend and style and the name of those type of girls is known as "ulzzang". They use various types of makeup and attachers and circle lenses to make their pupil/eyes appear bigger.

It's way too unreal and it makes them seem a little desperate. =S<br>  <br>  Girls their age should focus on studying... lol<br>  <br>  Also, i don't find them "attractive".

I don't know why people are obsessed with looking like anime characters. I draw manga (though I stylize it to be a little realistic and I use real proportions and knowledge of anatomy) and watch a bit of anime, and one day my friend told me I looked like an anime character and I was FREAKED OUT xD (cause I have a cute face and big eyes and I was wearing my hair in pigtails xD)<br>  <br>  So yeah..... those are contacts, and I agree, they're pretty creepy.<br>  <br>  Natural beauty is the way to go!

While you are there you need to buy a case or two of Old Style Beer to take back to New York. I live in Pittsburgh and go to Chicago at least twice a year to take in a Cubs or White Sox game when they are playing the Pittsburgh Pirates. The toll roads will cost you at least $50 or $60 from Pennsylvania to Illinois on Interstate 80. Arlington Park is cool if you are into horse racing. You could go via Interstate 70 but it takes longer but you will avoid the toll roads. Dont stay in Chicago. Stay near the METRA transit stations because it is cheaper than paying to park in Chicago. METRA has discount tickets in the summer on the weekends that take you directly into downtown Chicago. Then when you are downtown, they have free trollies that take you to the tourist spots in the summer.|`|fD7L1XMGaa	100$

If you pay ahead of time on one of these websites they will still ask for you credit card for incidentals.  The credit cards those places give the hotel are only for room and tax and the hotel cannot charge anything else to them.  Hope this helps explain why!!|`|py25T599aa	expedia.com never had a problem and have used them numerous times|`|ICjBorriaa	most hotel chains have a website, try one of those, or try <br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.wotif.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.wotif.com</a><br>  <br>  that might work<br>  <br>  or try <br>  <br>  hotels san diego in a search|`|a7bfe052a2f29eb67432ef60384d97a7aa	There's  few last minute websites [ often with discounts ] :<br>  <br>  Cheaperthanhotels :  Allows you to book and pay the deposit only online and the balance on check in , so for 1 night that's peanuts , say a round $10-15 approx.<br>  <br>  Try here , they appear to have a round 150 hotels hooked up : <a href="http://www.cheaperthanhotels.com/United-States/San-Diego/" rel="nofollow">http://www.cheaperthanhotels.com/United-...</a><br>  <br>  You receive your confirmation voucher online.

TOTUO3cuaa	Whatever you do, do NOT wear a beret!  Buy one as a souvenir if you want, but don't wear it until you go elsewhere.  I learned this listening to a BBC Radio 4 program by Steve Queenan (an American) <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/radio/aod/radio4_aod.shtml?radio4/vivelafrance" rel="nofollow">http://www.bbc.co.uk/radio/aod/radio4_ao...</a><br>  <br>  Have a look at French news photos to see what the locals are wearing.  Generally, they wear smart casual, low-key colors. Younger people can get away with really colorful stuff.|`|DEev3JdHaa	here's a hint...if you're planning to go to the high end stores (like Louis Vuitton) then dress up! i went in with pants and walking shoes (basically dressed casually) and the lady barely could stand helping me (kept looking me up and down and literally scowling at my outfit). unbelievable the snobbish attitude! <br>  <br>  i don't even like LV - was buying a wallet for a friend!|`|AA10935744	wear design cloths..that will make you fit in the best...or  you could wear close from stores like H&M, Forever 21, Black and White, Banana Republic, or other stores that are european based. and if you have a lot of money to spend just bring a couple pair of cloths you allready owen and buy cloths there.|`|afbab52ed0180d2887c29993b4dbdb8eaa	hehe what ever you want... lol just no sweats outside|`|54Rqpua6aa	I guess it depends what time of the year you go.<br>  I went to Paris last March, it rained a lot so make sure you bring an umbrella, lots of sweaters, I'd go with black, most neutral color. Nothing too flashy, jeans would be okay, preferably dark jeans and don't wear too many sweats. Have fun :)|`|AA11937736	Since, at any one given moment in April there will be 100,000 or more other tourists wandering around Paris, you will find that the French really have better things to do than stop going about their business  to mock you for being a foreign tourist. <br>  <br>  No one will really care if you look like an American (or Bulgarian or Uzbeki or whatever) so dress for your own comfort and convenience and don't worry about it.<br>  <br>  If you really want to avoid looking too much like an American than don't wear loud colors and avoid clothing with  "cute" sayings on them. <br>  <br>  Pack things that are black, navy blue, and grey. White blouses are good but white pants are not.<br>  <br>  It rains a lot in April so make sure you have a good rain coat. Even more important is a good pair of waterproof walking shoes. <br>  <br>  You will walk a lot in Paris and much of the time on very hard surfaces. Many side streets are rather uneven. Walking around in wet, flimsy shows which have been chosen for style rather than practicality will make you miserable.|`|xvr5nK9aaa	If you look like an american and can't speak french, your probably (no matter what) will look like a "stupid" american.<br>  <br>  By the way, if your going there, make sure you know how to say "I don't speak french" in french, one of my teachers told me an american went to Italy and was killing by a Italian because he didn't know what the american was saying and so he thought he was a burglar or something...

KTtz7Mstaa	NAU is a very nice school. My sister goes to school there and I live in Tucson so I have been up to Flagstaff quite a few times. <br>  <br>  Flagstaff isn't a big city, it's a college town so it definitely has laid back feel. The downtown isn't really much of a downtown but more of a few blocks of cute shops and restaurants. In the warmer months, you can drive up to Sedona and swim in the creek and of course during the winter, there's skiing and snowboarding. If you are craving a big city atmosphere for a weekend, Phoenix is only a two hour drive away. <br>  <br>  The dorms are very nice compared to some of the other ones I've seen but they are still dorms so there's not much too them. The Aspen dorms were just built in 2008 so they are probably very nice but I'm not sure if they are open to Freshman, you'll have to double check. <br>  <br>  As for the trying to find halls with out drinking and partying, there's going to be all different types of people in every single dorm. If you want to focus on your studies then all you have to do is find other people who want to do the same. And if your dorms do get too loud, there are plenty of other quiet places on campus to study. <br>  <br>  The best thing to do is to visit NAU before you decide. If you just go for a weekend and hang out there, you can see if you feel comfortable there.
5656d5ab22b21df010a9c35d05e22c81aa	A direct flight from Stockholm to Seoul is approx. 9 Hrs 0 Min|`|lVjM2oPraa	It depends on what airline he's taking, since there's no direct flight . If he's taking the fastest flight on KLM/Air France, it'll take at least 16 hours plus stopover, so his flight probably took off from Stockholm at 11pm Seoul time or earlier. Check with the airline or airport for precise details.
FaX8awk1aa	it is your non-typical state capital.  It is still a "western" town that has grown big.  It is a good place to live with much to do except in the middle of the winter.  crime rate is low and there are some jobs to be found.

AA11349530	I think we probably have a language difference going on here ... in the UK a "public school" is a very posh sort of private school, for instance Eton (where Princes Harry and William went) ... whereas I believe in the US a "public school" means what we in the UK would call a state school, that is a school that anyone can go to<br>  <br>  so working on that assumption here are the schools in the London Borough of Hammersmith & Fulham<br>  <a href="http://www.lbhf.gov.uk/Directory/Education_and_Learning/Schools_and_Colleges/General_Information_and_support/locations_and_contacts/46195_Schools_in_Hammersmith_and_Fulham_contact_and_location_details.asp" rel="nofollow">http://www.lbhf.gov.uk/Directory/Educati...</a><br>  and here's the schools in the London Borough of Kensington & Chelsea<br>  <a href="http://www.rbkc.gov.uk/schools/general/list_of_schools.asp" rel="nofollow">http://www.rbkc.gov.uk/schools/general/l...</a>

Soon people will be saying we dont have gladwrap and our school lunches get wrapped up in newspaper, just like the old days.|`|f610fce787e6299e681ff222a3173ed5aa	Uh, Tom, who is telling you all this crap?  Do you think we're a 3rd world country or something?  Auckland was in the top 10 best cities to live in in the world in last years quality of life survey.  So was Wellington.  The rest were mostly Swiss & Canadian cities.  Gee I wonder if people in Vancouver have their kid ride a moose to school?  And I guess in Zurich the kids go on sleds as they still don't have cars there.  And what do you mean horses?  Haven't you seen the movie Whalerider?  Our kids get to school on whales dude.<br>  <br>  Auckland is like Los Angeles in terms of car usage, the streets are gridlocked with them during peak hours as no one likes using public transport.|`|W0ltl4ulaa	ROFLMAO...............Bahahahahaha  in auckland......on horses..........to school................. Bahahahahaha|`|mGsGeAG6aa	This question made me LOL. Children get to school in many different ways. If they live in the area they can walk, but still a lot get dropped off by car, SUV, motorbike, whatever, especailly if it's raining. Some children, especially of high school age because they may live further away from their school may travel using public transport like bus, train etc. As for using horses in Auckland, I highly doubt it. This sometimes happens in some isolate rural parts of the country but I've never heard of it happening in recent times in Auckland.<br>  <br>  You may have heard of 'walking buses' or something like that. Parents and children pick each other up along a route to and from school. These are used in some schools and were introduced to promote exercise. Bearing this in mind the children aren't hiking ridiculous distances.|`|deEs2ta8aa	Say WHAT?! How embarrassing that people think that of us! <br>  <br>  No, we do NOT ride horses to school... or anywhere. You will find that Auckland is just like anywhere else. There are even PRIVATE schools where the kids are driven to school in Range Rovers and Mercedes. But usually it's either taking the bus or walking or being driven in a normal car. Nobody rides horses, sheep, moa, or any kind of animal anywhere. It is a city. <br>  <br>  In fact it's sister city is Los Angeles, so that might tell you something.<br>  <br>  Come on, we make movies in this country remember? We have technology...|`|qU1G6FmHaa	There are some schools in the country where students may take their horses to school.<br>  Note. I said in the country, that is, the rural areas.<br>  It doesn't happen in Auckland, and probably hasn't happened for about 100 years. It shows just how out of date your information is.|`|kvRhnn7daa	Omigod, do all Americans think we're so primative and think we all wear grass skirts?<br>  <br>  No, people generally don't ride horses lol!<br>  <br>  I'm not from Auckland, I'm from Hamilton (which is about an hours drive away) but I know they do use cars and all that. It's just the biggest city in New Zealand so the roads, finding parking and traffic is just awful.<br>  <br>  Please shoot the person who told you people can't use cars in Auckland. You guys should be embarrassed about your lack of knowledge :P|`|xBZ5yzPbaa	Of course! In cars? How silly. Why would you go in a car when I can walk a perfectly good 18kms over busy motorways every morning and evening? If there is a lot of traffic on the roads I do take a horse and go over the roofs of the cars so I can get ahead. Sometimes I ride my Kiwi bird to school and ride whales out to Rangitoto! Still, I could be back in South Africa were I ride Zebras or back in Australia were I ride Kangaroos!|`|Wt3t6rUPaa	I think your question has been answered. I hope you do get to move here soon...you will love it!  It is a fantastic place to live.  It is a really really gorgeous place with great people and heaps of cool stuff to see and do.  <br>  We all know Americans are a bit ignorant about the rest of the world..and alot of other things for that matter.....but its not your fault!  <br>  You will love it here and you will be welcomed with open arms.....<br>  just do some research before you come, bro.|`|aj1R6CRMaa	OMG HAHAH no!!!!!

siHN027laa	Yes, I've been to MX over a 100 times, both business and pleasure.<br>  There are some cities and areas in MX I'd prefer not to travel in or linger in but they are certainly outweighed by all the other places that are beautiful.<br>  'The prople are freindly, they are family oriented, have a great culture and wonderful, exciting history.<br>  The mountains, deserts and beaches are breath taking.<br>  We've driven down to Manzanillo, Puerto Vallarta, Mazatlan many times. We've driven all over Baja, mostly South Baja but also in Ensenada, Rosarita, TJ, Otay, Tecate, Mexicali.<br>  There are very pretty senoritas and senoras in MX, also!!!|`|1hciyvKdaa	I have only been to cities next to the US border, and its very impoverished and very sad to visit. The quality of the peoples lives are very low, and its very sad to see all the tiny children begging, it made it no fun and you wind up giving all your money to the poor kids who are hungry. I will not ever go again. I do not support a Gov that does not care about its citizens. I have seen lovely photos of the beaches and temples Id love to visit, but their laws are very scary too and if you get in a car crash, as a tourist you are held in jail on ransom of your family back home. My friend was in jail for 4 weeks, and his dad had to go get him for being drunk in public. Too scary for me. Im glad everyone who has gone was safe.|`|yyf5N7Ogaa	I agree Mexico is a beautiful country and a great place to visit. Next time come and see some of the cities in the interior of the country.

cSBZQfaIaa	But where are you staying? Luxembourg is very small i know.. but has more than one city... If you`re staying in Luxembourg city as i presume you are then i`d advise hotel Parc Belle-Vue <br>  5 Avenue Marie-Therese, Luxembourg City 2132, Luxembourg <br>  Stayed 4 nights at Parc Bellevue. I have no complains: clean room, perfect functioning bathrooms & wc, big window, silence. Price includes an excellent breakfast, which is offered at the restaurant located in the courtyard. No minibars in the rooms, but there are distributors always functioning. The reception is actually located at 20 meters distance from the hotel itself (the hotel is paired with Hotel Plaza and share the services with it).  I want to underline the great friendly and supporting staff working at the hotel: as I was sick for 2 days during my stay they made everything possible to help me though no room service is usually offered.  The hotel is located at 10 minutes walking distance from the centre of the city.<br>  Hope it helps you;) and have a great time..
EmIm5EWdaa	You and your daughter will be fine, i am English and live in Nha Trang which is the maine tourist beach resort. You will be very safe here and treated with respect,  your only problem will be petty crime,its a massive problem here, never ever leave anything unattended, on the beach or in a cafe, not even if you sleep on a bus, in fact deffinitly on the bus be extra carefull, it has become popular for a boy [in cahoots with the driver] to travel in the boot going through suitcases while you travel.|`|ul9qxw4Uaa	well yeah Long An is okay and for HO Chi Minh you just have to watch out for bike and at Ho Chi Minh I suggest you go by a taxi is better.|`|093c633e155de952249b95398f169e87aa	i have travelled to vietnam on several occasions for vacation, i usually stay between 1-2 months, travelling in both north and south vietnam. i leave for saigon again on march 12, this time ill stay only a month. ill arrive in HCM city then go to vung tau, then ill go to dalat in the mountains, then nha trang beach, then mui ne beach, and back to saigon. that trip is a good round trip to do and its very safe to do, there is good luxury bus transport that does all those places and Plenty of good budget hotels to stay, which i recommend to use, ranging from USD  $5 - $20 a night. if you have time, i recommend that you go to danang and hoi an which are two of my favourite places, situated about the middle of vietnam. you can take the overnight sleeper bus from nha trang to there for a very small cost. i think vietnam is as safe a place to travel as any of the 47 countries that ive been to in my travels. i suggest you buy a lonely planet book which will give you so much use full information with maps, accommodation prices, transport options, tourist places, do`s and don't`s etc. enjoy vietnam, a great place for your holiday, and great people, have fun|`|ZclWoZ3jaa	It is generally safe. Of course standards precautions like not to venture into dark and deserted places need to be observed. When you walk in the street in Ho Chi Minh, just be extra careful, there are thousands of motorcycles and even bigger vehicles who expect the others to give way to them. When when the traffic light turns red, look first before crossing the road as adherence to traffic rules is very poor in Vietnam.|`|56ys0K40aa	Its safe if you're prepared and have a translator (the friend has it covered) South Vietnam's pretty safe, I have relatives down in Saigon (ho chi minh) if you're looking for directions i recommend you ask for saigon too; thats what everyone still refers it to.  If you're visiting then theres always nha trang, mui ne, vung tau, and suoi tien (an amusement park, the first 3 are beaches)|`|uX2mb40Aaa	I am, Vietnamese and I've been there last summer. Except I was staying in Da Nang, not Ho Chi Minh.<br>  Vietnam is safe, it's not like when you're sleeping, someone will bust in and hold a gun against you.<br>  Just lock your doors every night (like everyone else) and there will be nothing to fear and the only thing that will be bugging you is the heat and the constant beeping of the motorcycles.<br>  <br>  Have a memorable trip!<br>  I know i did!|`|DPcIMbSUaa	actually, you gonna find a lots of interesting things in Vietnam<br>   and you gonna have a very <br>   but the onlyt thing i want to say is WATCH OUT THE ROBBERS  on the road! <br>    beware your wallet and ur stuff! that s it|`|AA10063012	I have been to that delightful country many times durning and after the war. I have never had a problem in Viet Nam, (forget the time I was there in 68,69,70). Sai Gon as all still call it is a bit crazy with to much traffic and noise but up country in the highlands, Da Lat, or Hue, Da Nang and of course Ha Noi, Hai Phong, Ha Long, etc, I enjoy. My wife is Vietnamese but I often travel on my own there by car and motor bike and use normal precaution and all is well. For women, I think it is very safe, again, normal precautions and use your head. My Vietnamese is ok, but not great and I have never had problems with language. I eat pho on the side of the road and buy my gas in coke bottles for my motorbike in the mountains. If you get a chance to go to Da Lat, I like it there. Also beaches at Vung Tau. China Beach south of Da Nang and walking along the river in Da Nang at night and talking to people. Lock your room doors at night and do not go out of the city after dark. There is much to see. Have an open mind, eyes and heart and you shall be rewarded, both you and your daughter. Drink bottled water and peel your own fruit, normal precautions. I also suggest carrying photocopys of your passport and visa, not the real ones. I take many $1.00 US bills with me for tips, and they must be like new. Do not  over tip but be fair. Resepect and consideration goes a long way. A fanny-pack says you are a tourist and invite attention.And, there is no "south" Viet Nam any longer It is Viet Nam. There is the north, central and the south, but all one country now. I am a wounded veteran but still love south east asia. I think you will also. Enjoy!

It is a 10 minute walk across centenary square and up Broad Street to the Sea Life centre. <br>  The carpark is free, otherwise the nearest is at the Nia or you can try the multi-storey in Cambridge street which is 5 minutes from the ICC and over the bridge to the Sea life centre.|`|L4z1FI5Kaa	If you follow signs for the NIA, (off Broad Street) there is a multi-storey down there which leads to the NIA which we have used.

Oh and one thing at the markets, it gets very stressful when 20 people all crowd around you at once yelling and trying to sell you something ,all day. This drove me mad.

TskZHzZyaa	California is on Pacific Time.  So it depends on where you are.  <br>  <br>  If you're east of Indiana you are on Eastern Time, so CA is three hours behind you.  So at 12:00 in EST it is 9:00 in California.  Major Cities: Bostin, NYC, Philadelphia, Atlanta, Indianapolis, Detroit, Louisville, Miami<br>  <br>  If you're between roughly Kansas and Chicago you're on Central Standard Time, and CA is two hours behind.  Major Cities: Milwaukee, Mpls, Chicago, Dallas, Houston, Omaha, New Orleans.<br>  <br>  Mountain Standard Time is primarily the Rocky Mountain States, between Nevada and Colorado, and it is one hour behind CA.  Major Cities: Denver, Boise, El Paso, Albaquerque, Salt Lake City.

The U.S. and the UN make promises that they will keep Israel secure if they give it up but we all know that will never be the case.<br>  <br>  It is only important to Syria because Israel now controls it.

It will be a cold day in hell before Syria gets any land and if I had my way I'd try him like we tried Saddam because he is doing what Saddam did. If Assad has a statue in Damascus like Saddam did it truly needs to come down. He wants Golan so he can use it for military purposes like he did the last time.<br>  <br>  Syria invented the PLO when they lost their war with Israel to fight war by proxy.  Syria wants Jordan, Israel and Lebanon to restore their Greater Syrian Empire similar to what Saddam tried to do with Kuwait and Mesopotamia.<br>  <br>  PLO was kicked from Jordan in the bloody black September Jordan battle (yes the same group responsible for murdering the Jewish athletes in Munich 1972) and the PLO used Jordanian soldiers head as soccer practice, tried to assassinate King Hussein and operated as a state within a state for a hostile takeover from within (trojan war.) Jordan now has peace treaty with Israel and claimed the Palestinians as their own because they did after all get 80% of the British Mandate. Queen Noor testified he stopped wanting to fight Israel.<br>  <br>  After the PLO was kicked from Jordan they made way to Lebanon.

Fatah is over there and people are looking upon them as angels only because compared to Hamas they seem more moderate. Fatah is just as brutal andcorrupt and is ethnically cleansing Jews and Christians out of Judea and Samaria.  Bethlehem is 80% Muslim now and these people demand to own the place to include the Jewish capital of Jerusalem but actually they are all just Syrians and their capitol is in Damascus.<br>  <br>  No Golan for them so they can continue their war.

The Syrians used the high ground to shoot into the dining hall at Kibbutz Gadot, killing innocent people while eating their lunch.  (I've been there and seen the pictures of those killed.)  The land is of no economic importance to the Syrians.  In fact, if returned, the land would soon revert back to desert in a very short time.

But most of the rainfall feeds into the Jordan and for the Israeli National Water Carrier to divert 80% of the these waters from the Jordan to the Negev for irrigation it is necessary to control the Heights. It was seized as "war booty" in 1967 and never returned; this has been repeatedly deemed an illegal occupation by the UN. In 1981 the Knesset formally annexed it,an act that no country on earth recognizes,including the U.S. It is still Syria's best province and it is still legally Syrian and all efforts to recover it by peaceful negotiation have failed.|`|lXxz4Qpkaa	The izzies claim they need it for "security" but in fact they just want it for the water table and because it's very beautiful.

They simply cannot afford to bring in as many as they did when the economy was good. Wait and the deals will be back. Another option is to look for a timeshare to rent at a Disney resort.

Il0QA1Hcaa	I work at a grocery store and you would be surprised of how many phones we find. Have you been to any stores recently, if so call the stores to see if they found the phone. The other place that I always find my phone when I loose it is in the car. It falls out of my pocket and under the driver seat or between the seats. If you know you lost it in the house check the trash, I am not trying to be funny but as you are cleaning up it falls in the trash can without you knowing. You can also check the fridge, freezer, or dresser drawer. I hope you find it good luck|`|IM7nzdjbaa	Check all your pockets!|`|YMHckA8yaa	In jacket pockets<br>  on side tables <br>  in jeans<br>  shelves<br>  hm...<br>  thats all i can think of lol<br>  good luck finding it x
hGEZ0b4Zaa	No you can not bring a hair dryer on a Royal Caribbean cruise.<br>  <br>  Are you talking about a hair straightener or a iron for clothes?<br>  <br>  Is it is a iron for clothes than you can not bring it on. They provide laundry service so you don't have to worry about that.<br>  <br>  If you are talking about a straightener, than yes you can.|`|q1GnMRxxaa	yes on the hair dryer and no on the flat iron, but the cruise ship supplies hair dryers so you really don't need to bring one. Also as far as the flat iron goes, they do have irons and laundry rooms(do it yourself) on cruise ships too, or you can have your stuff pressed for a small fee.|`|hPdEZ4Ypaa	They do not permit irons, but I think you can use one in the launderette. Don't bother with a hair dryer. They're provided in the staterooms.|`|AA10144812	I'm pretty sure you can. I think they have blow dryers on rccl ships, but on certain ones.

3af30c08175e2bc96bcd85540e09d175aa	Alcatraz is accessed from the pier in San Francisco so you would be able to go there no matter how you intend on getting to LA.<br>  <br>  Between SF and LA, there are loads of scenic places along Highway 1. There is Santa Cruz, Monterey/ Pacific Grove/ Carmel/ Pebble Beach, San Simeon and Hearst Castle, Santa Barbara, Big Sur, and more. 1 is quite possibly the most scenic drive in California. You can make a day of it and just drive past everything, or you can take a few days and do some exploring.<br>  <br>  Other than that, I suppose you could take 101, which will still hit San Simeon and Santa Barbara, and pass by some more low key attractions like garlic in Gilroy and the Steinbeck Library in Salinas. The fastest route is going to be 5, but there is pretty much nothing to see other than Casa de Fruta, a glorified fruit market near Hollister.|`|AA12339318	The only things to see would be like, Half Moon Bay and Maverick's beach where the world championship surfing tournament is held, and Santa Cruse with it's spectacular surfing spots plus it fun beach boardwalk and municipal pier and restaurants, Monterey and IT'S fisherman's wharf, Cannery Row and world class aquarium, Pacific Grove, 17 Mile Drive, Big Sur, Hearst's Castle, Santa Barbara and the rest of the California Coast with whale watching opportunities along the way.<br>  <br>  No, not much to do or see.<br>  <br>  Interestingly, while San Francisco is one of the most beautiful cities in the world, with this, and everything mentioned, in my opinion, the Alcatraz tour is one of the most boring things to do.  That is, unless for some reason, you LIKE old abandoned prisons.|`|i1AsTUG0aa	Highway 1...This route offers so many sights and attractions. It passes through several small California beach towns, and some beach cities. These include Malibu, Ventura, Santa Barbara, Lompoc, Santa Maria, Pismo Beach, San Luis Obispo, Morro Bay, Cambria, then for a few hours it is just the ocean to your left and the rolling hills and cliffs to your right, then Carmel, Monterey, Seaside, and Santa Cruz. This will be the most scenic and exciting, yet slowest, route.<br>  <br>  Highway 101...This route passes through all the valleys parrallel from the ocean. On this route you will drive along the busiest freeway in Los Angeles, maybe even CA, I-405. This way you will pass through Bel-Air, San Fernando Valley, Thousand Oaks, Ventura, Santa Barbara, Solvang - a very popular tourist attraction- , San Luis Obispo, Paso Robles, a very long stretch of agriculture, Salinas, San Juan Batista, Gilroy. This will be a fairly quick route but with few tourist attractions other than Solvang, PismoBeach, Salinas, and Gilroy.<br>  <br>  Interstate 5...definitely the fastest way. It passes through downtown Los Angeles, and then about an hour of mountains, and 6 hours of pure agriculture (orchards, fields, etc.). Casa De Fruta is actually about a 30 minute drive off of I-5 on highway 152. Then after the Valley's Agriculture you go through Altamont Pass, which is usually swamped with extremely heavy traffic from about 4-9am and 3-7pm. This route has almost no tourist attractions except for a few "vista points" that offer great views of the Valley.|`|vXYQcixvaa	Yes Alcatraz is cool! You could also stop in San Jose at the Winchester Mystery House....then theres the Madonna Inn in San Luis Obispo. Thats a landmark hotel....<br>  <br>  :)

I would personally stay in the Hilton if I were you.  There are many high end shops, the location is great, you can get the type of service you need, restaurants are right there and it is right on the River.  Get a room on the 26 and above floor and you will have a breath taking view of the river and city.|`|2vwpoP0Yaa	Monteleone is nice, also check out the Andrew Jackson Hotel and some of the bed and breakfasts in the back of the Quarter.

mx32BnQAaa	there are so many places you can go,it depends of your interests,historical sites are amost everywhere in Greece,and eery islands has its own beauty,Kefalonia is an awesomeplace to go with beautiful beaches attractive villages and towns <br>  On a family holiday in Greece with teenage children Ttry the northeast coast of Corfu. You get the relative quietness while your teenagers can enjoy the night life. For a family beach vacation in Greece with small children Paxos, south of Corfu, is an excellent choice. It is a small island of olive groves and pinewoods with a handful of little ports and villages to enjoy and explore.<br>  <br>  You can also contemplate a family beach vacation in Greece by planning a trip to Mykonos. The only problem is that there are too many beaches which makes choosing the best difficult. On the south side of the island alone are Ornos and Psarou beaches preferred by families, Agrari for idyllic relaxation and Psarou is great for windsurfing, water-skiing and diving.<br>  <br>  In Santorini most beaches are covered in black, ash-like sand except for the most famous one, which is red. The main town, Fira, is found at the peak of the island and provides breathtaking views across the land and sheer cliffs that plunge into the azure water. From the ancient ruins at Akrotiri to Orthodox, Catholic and Byzantine churches, to fish-sellers on the streets of Fira, Santorini has a homely feel to it.

The best thing is once you get here you will never get lost, and there is simple transport, one bus that does a circle route, and taxis.<br>    You may think...oh too small, but trust me its amazing it has something for everyone.<br>  <br>  We have breathtaking beaches and there are sailboat trips with BBQ who make day-trip excursions.  We have famous restaurants and tavernas that have been written about, as well as the style who have "Mama's cooking".  There are cultural and music festivals throughout the Summer anywhere from free Rock concerts in our outdoor arena, to local wine and cheese tasting, art displays and local theatre.  We have clubs, live music bars etc for the teens and moped hire etc  and I'm sure the younger kids will be happy with the beaches and the many beach toys and novelties that are on sail at the tourist stores.  And if at any time you feel in need of more, you can take a day trip to Rhodes which is the next island over and less than 1hr away, which has great shopping, a water fun park, and a beautiful medieval old town with markets.<br>  <br>  <br>  You can fly direct to Rhodes from all over Europe and the US and then take a quick ferry to Symi, <br>  <br>  checkout<br>  <br>  www.symivisitor.com<br>  www.symigreece.com<br>  www.symi.gr<br>  <br>  :o)|`|7cL3ofPraa	All of Greece is beautiful<br>  But one place you have to go to is Crete<br>  Beautiful island, friendly people, beaches, history|`|TzjkajKFaa	Crete is the best for a family, take a look to this site<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.sitiacrete.org" rel="nofollow">http://www.sitiacrete.org</a><br>  <br>  bye|`|p3ZQffuLaa	Every one is going to tell you to go to Crete or Rhodes but these are so touristic, its like being in a hot England! <br>  Try somewhere like Lesvos.

If you book a flight with easyjet now it will be really cheap. I prefer booking after christmas or Easter holidays. There are flights available from Gatwick directly to Heraklion which is the capital. All four cities in Crete are beautiful but i prefer Heraklion and Chania. Heraklion is the only city where you can combine clubing, good food, shopping etc but i will advise you to stay outside the city. You can stay in Gouves which is a very beautiful place and basically not so wild as other places. here are buses from everywhere to everywhere in Crete. You can also stay in Chersonissos or Malia. That's what most travel agents will tell you but be careful..! If you want to have a nice, quiet and relaxing time don't go there. It is full of tourists from EVERYWHERE and their only purpose is clubing and drinking. It's a clubzone basically. You can stay in another place and visit those places if you like of course and have a look for yourself. You can stay in Gouves as i said or Stalida (other name Stalis). They both are close to the clubzones i told you (stalida is practically 10 minutes tops on foot from Chersonissos) and not far from Heraklion. Gouves is 15 minute drive and Malia nearly 30 minutes. Stalida and Chersonissos are located in between the aforementioned. Now, July and august are the hottest periods but also the best. If you go to Knossos or Festos (the two ancient cities) don't go there in August. You will get dehydrated and won't enjoy it due to the heat. If you want to know anything more about Crete just email me. I will be happy to help you. There are MANY places in Crete and imagine that i am 22 and still trying to go everywhere. I am travelling with my family around Crete since i was 15 because i cannot find a better place to go but it depends on what you actually want

One reason we like it here on Kauai is because it isn't overrun with tourists trying to get to all the "secret" spots. If you're coming here, just enjoy the island as it is and don't go traipsing all over where you aren't welcome. If there's a sign that says "Kapu" (forbidden), OBEY IT! Don't go there! Read the signs, follow the rules, and you'll have a good time. Too many people are killed here every year because they think the rules don't apply to them (after all, they paid a pretty penny to visit so they want to do EVERYTHING, right?). Trust me -- I see headlines in the local paper every week about some tourist that was washed off a cliff or fell down the side of a waterfall because they were walking around where they shouldn't have been.

The memorial attracts approximately two million people annually.<br>   <br>  <br>  <br>  History<br>  Main article: Construction of Mount Rushmore<br>   <br>  The carving of Mount Rushmore involved the use of dynamite, followed by the process of "honeycombing". About two million tons of rock were blasted off the mountainside.Originally known to the Lakota Sioux as Six Grandfathers, the mountain was renamed after Charles E. Rushmore, a prominent New York lawyer, during an expedition in 1885.[5] At first, the project of carving Rushmore was undertaken to increase tourism in the Black Hills region of South Dakota. After long negotiations involving a Congressional delegation and President Calvin Coolidge, the project received Congressional approval. The carving started in 1927, and ended in 1941 with some injuries and no fatalities.[4]<br>  <br>  As Six Grandfathers, the mountain was part of the route that Lakota leader Black Elk took in a spiritual journey that culminated at Harney Peak. Following a series of military campaigns from 1876 to 1877, the United States asserted control over the area, a claim that is still disputed based on the 1868 Treaty of Fort Laramie (see Controversy below). Among white American settlers, the peak was known variously as Cougar Mountain, Sugarloaf Mountain, Slaughterhouse Mountain, and Keystone Cliffs. It was named Mount Rushmore during a prospecting expedition by Rushmore, David Swanzey (whose wife Carrie was the sister of author Laura Ingalls Wilder), and Bill Challis.[6]<br>  <br>  Historian Doane Robinson conceived the idea for Mount Rushmore in 1923 to promote tourism in South Dakota. In 1924, Robinson persuaded sculptor Gutzon Borglum to travel to the Black Hills region to ensure that the carving could be accomplished. Borglum had been involved in sculpting the Confederate Memorial Carving, a massive bas-relief memorial to Confederate leaders on Stone Mountain in Georgia, but was in disagreement with the officials there.[7] The original plan was to perform the carvings in granite pillars known as the Needles. However, Borglum realized that the eroded Needles were too thin to support sculpting. He chose Mount Rushmore, a grander location, partly because it faced southeast and enjoyed maximum exposure to the sun. Borglum said upon seeing Mount Rushmore, "America will march along that skyline."[8] Congress authorized the Mount Rushmore National Memorial Commission on March 3, 1925.[8] President Coolidge insisted that along with Washington, two Republicans and one Democrat be portrayed.[9]<br>  <br>  Between October 4, 1927, and October 31, 1941, Gutzon Borglum and 400 workers sculpted the colossal 60-foot (18 m) carvings of U.S. presidents George Washington, Thomas Jefferson, Theodore Roosevelt, and Abraham Lincoln to represent the first 150 years of American history. These presidents were selected by Borglum because of their role in preserving the Republic and expanding its territory.[8][10] The image of Thomas Jefferson was originally intended to appear in the area at Washington's right, but after the work there was begun, the rock was found to be unsuitable, so the work on the Jefferson figure was dynamited, and a new figure was sculpted to Washington's left.[8]<br>  <br>  In 1933, the National Park Service took Mount Rushmore under its jurisdiction. Engineer Julian Spotts helped with the project by improving its infrastructure. For example, he had the tram upgraded so that it could reach the top of Mount Rushmore for the ease of workers. By July 4, 1934, Washington's face had been completed and was dedicated. The face of Thomas Jefferson was dedicated in 1936, and the face of Abraham Lincoln was dedicated on September 17, 1937. In 1937, a bill was introduced in Congress to add the head of civil-rights leader Susan B. Anthony, but a rider was passed on an appropriations bill requiring that federal funds be used to finish only those heads that had already been started at that time.[11] In 1939, the face of Theodore Roosevelt was dedicated.<br>  <br>   <br>  A model at the site depicting Mount Rushmore's intended final design. Insufficient funding forced the carving to end in October 1941.The Sculptor's Studio—a display of unique plaster models and tools related to the sculpting—was built in 1939 under the direction of Borglum.

2wyDALHgaa	Sure, if you want to get caught.  They may or may not ask for your DL but is it really worth the effort?  If you get boned in your own country you get a ticket.  If you get boned over here you'll get more then that so that you don't skip out without paying it.  They will consider you driving both without a valid DL and without valid insurance since the expired DL would void your insurance too.  They may hold you or even impound your car.  Go ahead, roll the dice and try it.....or just renew your DL.  If you can't renew it because of offenses or because of outstanding tickets then the cops up here (or the border agents) will still see them when the check the system.  Canadian law enforcement has direct access to the US databases.<br>  <br>  EDIT:   Well if you are not driving then nobody will care.  As to whether or not they will allow someone to use it as ID if they check...I'd doubt it.  Everything I've read says that you need valid ID.

Since few countries outside of the U.S. have state leadership seminars, eligible international students must be between the ages of 15 and 17.

Lebanon is a Mediterranean country so the sun is really strong their its kind of like Flordia, i suggest u start using a high SPF the first couple of times to prevent your skin from burning then u can go lower to get a better tan, but dont go too low, there are strong links between skin cancer and exposure to UV rays. try not to get exposed from 11-3 where the sun is really intense ,  u dont wanna bake in the sun its not worth it . tanned skin is very over rated especially for girls fair skin is pretty and is "in" these days|`|b05ydMvjaa	If U are in beirut or any sea level city it is nasty and humid while if U Travel up the mountains or the bekaa valley it is warm about 85F but no humidity or a bit of it that very hard to even feel.
AA10662056	Juku is one name of cram school. The large ones are called "yobiko" in Japan. Did you know that?<br>  <br>  Some teachers in yobiko are earning a lot of money like $1M for one year. If someone is really good at teaching, it's possible to earn that much.<br>  <br>  But is your fiance a Japanese? There is no reason for juku or yobiko to hire a teacher who is not Japanese. Because those schools teach kids how to pass entrance exams and foreigners did not take entrance exams for Japanese colleges.|`|xPeIvywdaa	cram school teachers are llike tutors, except for a lot more students, so think tutoring one person and then multiply that by a class, so yes they do make a good amount more than teachers here, dont know the exact though sorry<br>  <br>  and i  do not believe they have to keep going to school as long as they are eligible for teaching a cramming course<br>  <br>  good luck with your fiance|`|Q3RqWHFsaa	Public institutional school teacher's salary is very bad but they will take enough pension after retirement in late future in Japan. Private school's payment is up to teacher's skill and result.Overall, juku teacher is not good job except being more free from other restriction such as non-teaching and unprofessional things in the school.<br>  <br>  Teachers always are doing a lot of work including non-teaching office work and unprofessional routine work all together with his own professional teaching in school.. Juku teacher is much more free from those tedious annoyance.<br>  <br>  The first time Juku teachers would earn around Yen250,000 for monthly salary which is better than first timer public institutional school teachers at least. Only one thing difficulty is for Juku teachers working time is day and night and weekend and holidays at random too.

AA11441260	no, it doesn't give one a bit of feeling like in China. Although you may see a lot of chinese, there're also a lot of pinoys there.And the chinese looking people there speak straight tagalog.<br>  The best time I  would say is during the week before the chinese new year. One can watch a dragon dance performance on an hourly basis.All stalls have their sort of sales promotions.<br>  By now, all you can do is walk around, shop at the local DVD (pirated too ) outlets all in chinese. No english or pinoy movies. Lots of beautiful chinese songs too.<br>  You can try eating in some fancy chinese restaurants so that the attendants are in their cheong sam or chinese costumes.<br>  During the last 2 days of the month, there is this stall corner of Mapua ST and Ongpin ST that sells buy one take one fresh frozen or ice cold sugarcane extracts or juices. Delicious and nutritious too.<br>  Also popular there is fresh vegetarian lumpia.<br>  Enter chinese groceries, you may just browse, ask around, and maybe buy something interesting that is not available outside chinatown.<br>  About the goldsmith shops, it's just the same in the malls.And the purity I cannot guarantee if you are not knowledgeable in this.<br>  I don't seem to see chinese cultural shows or outlet there, some chinese schools have them in their presentations from time to time. But I heard some have bars attended by girls from China.<br>  If you haven't tried riding horse drawn carts or kalesa, that's one place where there are still some, but it's not as numerous as before.<br>  The hardwares there are cheap as compared to those in the malls and many repairmen or technicians buy their hard to find stuff there.Right before Recto Avenue,along Mapua Street,(formerly Misericordia ) there is this Funeraria Paz which is patronized mainly by local chinese and their "frontage" really depicts that some chinese died. See to ease your imagination what it really looks like.<br>  Along Ongpin St., near Nueva, when school time is off, you can see lots of cute chinese kids in their  uniform heading for home or else where.\<br>  Lots of things to see really, but lots are more common elsewhere nowadays.<br>  Enjoy your trip.|`|1J9f4HWraa	Day time is the best time to visit on that place, restaurants for authentic chinese foods with incomparable taste are the land marks in chinatown, Manila.|`|i1bj5UDBaa	I'd say go there using the public transport as they have narrow streets and finding a parking space is difficult.I always go around there by foot starting from the gates fronting the Sta. Cruz Church then walk through the street until I reached Binondo Church. You can find jewelry shops, Chinese drug stores, Chines bakeshops, Chinese restaurants and Chinese delis so I'd say you will somehow get a taste of China.

There are some here, but not alot.  Yes I do think it's good to be multiracial, my only complaint is some races bringing moral views to the workplace that are unreasonable & unrealistic (ie: judging white people who are single mothers, who are single at age 30, etc).<br>  <br>  I have 6 neighbours, 2 of them are Maori, one is English & the rest are white NZers.  1 NZer is cool, the other 2 are gossips, the English one is a lazy **** who won't do her share of the gardening (we share a yard so after 2 years now it's driving me nuts), the Maori's are the better neighbours as they're quiet & mind their own business.<br>  <br>  And Hail you might be interested to know that the Maori neighbours are employed, but half the Pakeha ones are unemployed!

XLQ9wCUaaa	OMG yes I went in high school, there was like 30-40 of us and about 7-8 chaperones. It was really, amazingly, mindblowingly fun! <br>  <br>  Keeping in mind that mine was a high school EF trip, but I'm not sure of the name of the one I did; it was England, France, Liechtenstein, Switzerland, Austria and Germany. We really had a great time, all kids, and it was really high energy. However a lot of this depends on who is putting it on - I was fortunate to have a wicked English teacher who picked and chose where we went and nixed the boring stuff. We saw everything though, ate lots of different food, went to a play, went up the Eiffel Tower, saw Versailles, St. Paul's Cathedral, stayed in the Alps, it was really great! :)<br>  <br>  As for the living arrangements, European hotels aren't like American ones. The rooms are much smaller and the beds are all singles. They will put three or four of you in a room usually (although they didn't for me b/c my mom came along as a chaperone & I roomed with her & got a slightly bigger room). Make sure if you bring anything electronic that needs charging to get the converter. Bring facecloths if you need them cause European hotels often don't have them. Bring comfy shoes cause you walk a lot and the weather can change. Uhh walkmans or ipods are a good idea too, but nothing too valuable because you want to enjoy your trip & not worry about your stuff getting swiped. Take lots of pictures and label tham asap so you remember where they were! Oh and watch out for pickpockets on the subways of Paris (especially) if you guys are heading there - a group of them tried to target us thinking we were tourists but not realizing we were all together. Pretty much be careful. <br>  <br>  But yeah, if you guys have a cool chaperone (assuming you're a student like I was) who has been to Europe before you'll have a frickin great time. Even if not though, it's really fun to go in a group and have a lot of the details taken care of. <br>  <br>  I'm jealous though - I'd love to go on another EF trip! They charge like twice as much for the European summer study-trips at my university (and airfare isn't included). EF is pretty good bang for the buck. <br>  <br>  Good luck with your trip! :)|`|p7Toql00aa	I'm gonna go on an Athens EF Tour this march, i think they r ok!|`|OGqMkCD6aa	Yep, I went last year on a EF College break trip and had a blast. Its great because they take care of everything for you from round trip airfare, hotels, transportation, and tours at a good price plus i got a discount with my friends with the code Vincig7397 ...After the tour was done we decided to stay more and the flight home was still included in the package deal. I highly recommend booking a tour with them.

AA11937736	Well, I'm sure it come as no surprise to you that the tour company is ripping you off. <br>  <br>  However, instead of the train take the Eurolines bus from Paris to London.

Ask your question on that site and I'm sure someone will be able to help you.|`|KS2OHXCRaa	Wow, this EuroRail price is crazy, and actually your tour agency is telling the truth. <br>  <br>  Eurostar trains at the lowest price costs about 77euro return trip (of which during the reservation process the cost will be split into half for each of the two journeys making the ticket seems like just 33-34euro each way, but you will not get that kind of "low" price if you're buying just a single ticket), whereas single trip is just about 10-15euro cheaper than the return trip if you find one at the lowest price. Otherwise it could even be higher than that. Especially if you leave it to the last minute to buy. You should try to get them in advance in order to have the best buy ticket.<br>  <br>  You can buy the ticket either from Voyages SNCF (<a href="http://www.voyages-sncf.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.voyages-sncf.com/</a> ) or Eurostar (<a href="http://www.eurostar.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.eurostar.com</a> ). If you're using Eurostar site, be aware that if you choose the UK-based site (therefore in English) you'll be charged in GBP, whereas if you choose French-based site (therefore information in French) you'll be paying for the ticket in Euro. You can get the ticket about 3 months in advance.<br>  <br>  Rilifane has advised you on the cheapest way to travel, which is by using Eurolines buses. You should note that the price is correlated to travel time. Travelling by Eurostar train takes about 2 1/2 hours, whereas the bus will take about 7 1/2 to 8 hours (including channel crossing).

If you've never given her a reason to NOT trust you then she shouldn't be laying on the guilt anyway and should be happy for you. If you have given her a reason to think you'll be naughty then as I said, you're not going to be able to make her okay with this, but then again, she shouldn't be with you if she thinks she can't trust you. If you're a good boy, and have been a good boyfriend, then stress that to her. Remind her you've never given her a reason not to trust you, and that you don't plan on starting now, that you love her, and that you wish she could be happy and excited for you.|`|3oanK9hkaa	uuuh Take lots of pictures, call her every night (make sure you have an international calling plan), and DON'T cheat on her!

9u1KmWAHaa	OMG I used to life in Chicago all of my life until I moved. <br>  <br>  Go to the beach! Lake Michigan is so beautiful, especially in the summer. I would recommend going to the one near the Shedd Aquarium, so you can visit the aquarium. The Shedd is the largest aquarium in the world (I believe) and it has daily Dolphin Shows which are pretty amazing so I would definately recommend going there. <br>  <br>  Also, for a good place to eat you should definately go to the Hancock Tower buffet on the 95th floor. The view is ABSOLUTELY AMAZING! (unless, of course, youre scared of heights) you can see almost all of Chicago. The buffet doesnt even cost that much (I think $15 per person) but you definately need to make reservations. Also I have to warn you going to the 95th floor by elevator makes you ears hurt. If you have a lot of $$ you could go to some place fancy to eat like Alinea or Charlie Trotters. <br>  <br>  If you have time go shopping! especially at the Water Tower place, they have a lot of good stores, or just along Michigan Ave. if youre a shopping person. By the way, there is this really famous Popcorn store called "Garretts" that sells incredible popcorn, but only if you are willing to wait in lines that stretch down the street to get them. :P<br>  <br>  I also would suggest just hanging out in Millenium Park, sometimes they have free open air concerts in the evenings that's really cool. <br>  <br>  If you arrive in time maybe you can catch the Taste of Chicago or Lollapalooza if you love music. (Although I personally have never been to Lollapalooza) <br>  <br>  Another really cool thing about Chicago is that you can get a ride in a horse drawn cart downtown. I have no idea how much that costs though, Ive never been on one. <br>  <br>  The point is, you can have so much fun in Chicago, and hopefully you can get to experience it to the fullest in a week!!!!!1|`|ntcETBTQaa	Well.. I live on the southside of chicago and im 21...<br>  But i was once your age.<br>  <br>  but heres lots to do out here<br>  <br>  You can go to the museum of science and industry and the field museum<br>  <br>  We also have a shed aquarium !<br>  <br>  Theres millenium Park and Navy Pier for Movies Imax and shopping!<br>  <br>  If you plan on doing nightlife!<br>  <br>  Get a fake id and go to clubs<br>  <br>  buzz or ruby u will get into....|`|TskZHzZyaa	Zezza has good answers but I don't recall the Signature Room (the 95th floor of the Hancock) having a buffet unless they've changed things.  Course he said he USED to live in Chicago, in which case I can tell you it is not a buffet.  And it is not cheap and if you don't dress up you'll feel out of place, but it is a great restaurant everyone should try if given the chance, great views and outstanding food!  <br>  <br>  Cheap eats on the far west side of downtown is Mr. Beef - a hole in the wall but the best italian beef sandwiches you will ever eat.  And not too expensive.  It also has the rarity of free parking.  Consider a walk across the expressway to Greektown along Halsted Avenue.  Or drive down to Cermak (or take the red line and walk over to Wentworth Avenue) to Chinatown, that is a very cool place where you can eat REAL Chinese food and hear and see real Chinese language.<br>  <br>  One Chicago show everyone should see once is the Blue Man Group.  They are having a special - two tickets for $99.  Very cool and fun show.  The CTA Redline can get you to the Briar Street Theatre pretty easily.<br>  <br>  Hang out at Millennium Park and bring your swimsuit, or watch the local kids get squirted by the high tech faces at Crown Fountain.  The sculpture and spaces at MP are unparalleled in the world.  <br>  <br>  If you like history go to the Museum of Science and Industry and walk around the lagoons to the south.  These are remnants of the 1893 Columbian Worlds Fair.  And read Devil in the White City for a fascinating history of the fair - it is a book you won't be able to put down.<br>  <br>  If you like architecture do a tour of the Robie House near the University of Chicago, a well known Frank Lloyd Wright house.<br>  <br>  Locals hang out at Navy Pier, a great way to enjoy the lake and live music.  There is also a ferris wheel, swing ride, carousel, putt putt golf, and several specialty shops and restaurants.  Consider a meal at the Bubba Gump shrimp Company based on the movie Forrest Gump.<br>  <br>  Check out the city web site for summer festivals.  Taste of Chicago is packed full of locals and is a good way to sample foods from many restaurants.  They often feature free concerts - a few years ago they had Steve Winwood.  That occurs for the two weeks up to July 4. Sometime in August the city hosts Lollapalooza.<br>  <br>  Finally some other good cheap eats - Gino's East and Ed Debevic's right across the street from each other at Ontario and (I think) Wells.  The former is legendary deep dish pizza - it used to be Planet Hollywood and you'll see some of the remnants of that place.  ed Debevics is a 50's style diner that comes with entertainment from the wait staff.<br>  <br>  You will have a great week with plenty to do.  We welcome you!|`|iR7By5xzaa	First of all you need to buy a case of Old Style. Not Old Style Lite. Then proceed to drink it all.

It's fun, but don't spend a whole day there :]<br>  <br>  If you're a fan of Pres. Obama, there's his neighborhood of Hyde Park on the south side, you can go to his favorite restaurant called Dixie Kitchen, it's got amazing food for a pretty good price, it's more southern-style food there. And of course, if you asked for directions people would tell you how to get near his house (the street is blocked off by secret service but you can still get near it!). That's a pretty fun trip.<br>  <br>  There's all kinds of stores, especially near/on Michigan Ave, so if you like shopping, go there. Also on Michigan Ave. there's the John Hancock building, which has a great observitory at the top, you awesome view of the city from there.<br>  <br>  Go to a baseball game. Either Sox or Cubs (Sox are better in my opinion :] ) you'll have a great time, and even though I'm not a fan of them, if you go to Wrigley and see the Cubs, Wrigleyville has a bunch of great restaurants and stores. Near Wrigley is one of my favorite stores called Strange Cargo, it custom prints t-shirts and sells all kinds of cool stuff from like vintage bags and jackets to converse, etc. It's awesome.<br>  <br>  Also, there's a drive-in restaurant that's world-famous on the north side called Superdawg. It's just about the coolest place in the city in my opinion. They sell chicago style superdawgs (do NOT order a hot dog, they won't serve you if you call it that), burgers, amazing malts/shakes, basically everything a drive-in hot dog joint normally has.    <br>  <br>  Those are a few things I like to do, but if you just ask anyone they will tell you some great restaurants, night clubs, and other places..people are pretty friendly here, so just ask anyone! Have fun!!!!|`|inFKnA7oaa	You can take some tours via boat and see the architecture of the city... :) thats a little different than museums.

3UB7mSNwaa	If your first flight is delayed 30 minutes you have a 50 percent chance of missing your connection.  If it is delayed anything more than 30 minutes your odds of missing your connection dramatically increase.  If you like drama take the 1hr and 8 min connection, if you want to relax on your trip pay the extra 100.00 for the 2hr 48 min connection.  the 5hr is too long and not necessary.  Even though the airlines handles all the luggage transfers and you will not have to go through security you are pushing your luck with the one hour connection.  So much can go wrong at airports with weather and equipment malfunctions and if you miss your international flight you probably will be stuck overnight.  There has been many a time that i have had a one hour connection because there was no other choice and I had to run through the airport with my carry on bags jumping over suitcases and obstacles to get to the next gate.  You can get something to eat and use the restrooms with the 2 1/2 hr layover and get ready for the next flight.<br>  <br>  have a nice trip

d6b1Dke1aa	We actually cruised to Bermuda two years ago, and it was a beautiful country.. <br>  <br>  My husband took off on me and went golfing.. so if you're into that.. they've got a great golf course.  (I think it was called Port Royal??)  <br>  <br>  We docked in the Royal Navy Yard, so I spend a little time wandering around that area.  There are a few little shops to check out.. and there's a ferry that will take you into Downtown Hamilton from there.  I think it was pretty cheap, if I remember correctly.  It was a pretty ferry ride - past all the colorful houses, and sailboats in the harbor. <br>  I went into town and did some souvenir shopping...<br>  <br>  We were actually there for two days - in port overnight- so the next day, we took a bus tour around the island.  We got to see where Catherine Zeda Jones and Michael Douglas lived, and Ross Perot.  We spent a little bit of time at the zoo/aquarium - which was very nice.<br>  <br>  I know the cruise ship was really stressing that you should NOT rent a motor scooter.  I remember seeing lots of sharp corners, and blind spots.. and roundabouts?  I believe they drive on the left side of the road there, and there are lots of accidents.   We didn't need a scooter, and didn't use a taxi.  We were able to see the island and get around easily.<br>  <br>  Hope you have a great time!!! I'm jealous :-)|`|hGEZ0b4Zaa	Best beaches in Bermuda are: HORSESHOE BAY and ELBOW BEACH<br>  <br>  Beaches in Bermuda are famous for their pink sand and vibrant colors. <br>  <br>  Crystal Cave is a must see attraction in Bermuda. You can walk through the clear water and you can see millions of crystals. Its hard to explain but look it up on google.<br>  <br>  Go to the Town of St. George. It has a lot of little shops and restaurants to go to. While you are there, you get to experience the different cultures in Burmuda. Its really fun!<br>  <br>  Get a cab driver and ask him to drive you around to the best part of Burmuda. Thats what I did and I had an amazing time!<br>  <br>  Hope you have fun =)

If you go to hong Kong the best you can hope for is six months multiple entry for 30 days each entry.  <br>  <br>  Frank, you need to simma-down.|`|a6JZjRG1aa	apply for a new visa... <br>  they will put a red stamp on your "One Entry" and stick a new one which says "Multi Entry"...<br>  your loss will be a new fee...<br>  if there any other way? -- no, there is no...<br>  this is how it's done in China...|`|Lmw6dtQvaa	First off it is getting very annoying that SO MANY PEOPLE ASK A QUESTION AND DO NOT TELL WHAT PART OF CHINA THEY ARE IN.<br>  <br>  This would help so much. But since you have neglected this I can only give you what I know.<br>  <br>  First you may just have to get a new VISA all together. This is a place in Hong Kong. I got my Visa here.

Visa extension is administrated by the Foreigner Entry and Exit Administrative Center, which is under the Public Security Bureau and available in most major cities in China.<br>  <br>  If you wish to obtain an annually multiple entry visa, you may have to reapply in the Chinese embassy or consulate in your home country. Their is a document requirement for the multiple entry. Basically, you need to prove you will be required to enter and exit frequently for a legitiment reason during next year. For instance, an invitation letter from a business partner in China stating the necessity of your visit to China on a regular basis will be sufficient. You can visit the site <a href="http://www.amlinkint.com/English/travel-to-china/china-travel-tips-8.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.amlinkint.com/English/travel-...</a> for more information on Chinese Visa.|`|kbhgYHaqaa	You can find an agent to "extend" your F visa without leaving China mainland. But the new F with multiple entries will be calculated from the application date. And of course, your present 180-day one-entry F visa will be cancelled, since you cannot have two valid China visas at the same time. <br>  <br>  The new F has NO limitation of each stay. The multiple entries are for your use within the 6 months. <br>  <br>  BTW, what's your nationality? It is very important.
ac7e0f50f58632b431b5cf5de0564ffbaa	There are literally hundreds of things to do here in LA. Here is my list of “must sees”. Visit as many as you have time for.:<br>  <br>  Disneyland: The Happiest Place on Earth. Half a billion visitors can’t be wrong. #1 Destination. <br>  Universal Studios: A theme park that grew out of a studio tour. #2 Destination.<br>  Even if you don’t visit Disneyland or Universal Studios Tour, Downtown Disney District and Universal City Walk are very fun places to visit for shopping and eating. And they’re free to visit. <br>  <br>  Hollywood: Enjoy the Walk of Fame, Entertainment Museum, Chinese Theatre and more. You can see a lot for free. The Hollywood & Highland complex is AMAZING. It has lots of shops and restaurants, and the Kodak Theater (home of the Academy Awards). I also like the El Capitan theater, right across the street, where Disney shows their movies. And the Hollywood Bowl is a GREAT place to listen to concerts outdoors. <br>  <br>  Rodeo Drive, 90210: Packed with exclusive shops, full of gawkers. They all came to enjoy the excess. Free, unless you intend to buy something.<br>  <br>  Venice Beach: Los Angeles kitsch and over-the-top culture at its best. Here you'll find Muscle Beach, street performers and tacky shops galore. Fun, VERY interesting, but I avoid it after dark, when it gets a little TOO interesting for my taste. <br>  <br>  Santa Monica Beach and Pier: Great beach scene and a classic seaside amusement park, complete with antique carousel that has been in a lot of TV and movies. (The Sting and "Three's Company" come immediately to mind). After visiting the pier, you can ride a bike south a couple miles to Venice Beach.<br>  <br>  Santa Monica Third Street Promenade - Downtown Santa Monica's shopping promenade is often the scene of movie star-sightings. Just north of Santa Monica Pier.<br>  <br>  Sunset Boulevard: Perhaps one of the world's most famous streets, it began as a route between the stars' posh neighborhoods and the Hollywood studios. It runs from downtown to the ocean, passing through the "Sunset Strip" on its way. It makes for a fun drive. When you get to the ocean, stop at Gladstone's for Fish.<br>  <br>  Farmers Market and The Grove - A new shopping complex right next to a Los Angeles landmark, The Grove and Farmers Market coexist. Enjoy a movie or shopping, and then take the trolley to the Farmers Market for lunch or dinner. It is right next to CBS, so walk across the lot to see if they are taping "The Price is Right". You might even get in.<br>  <br>  TAAB: The Americana at Brand- The newly opened TAAB, developed by the same group that gave us The Grove, breathes new life into Glendale, and gives all those hip people in Eagle Rock and the eastern half of LA a great place to go. <br>  <br>  Griffith Park - Home of the Los Angeles Zoo, Griffith Park Observatory, Travel Town, the Greek Theatre, and Gene Autry Museum of Western Heritage.<br>  <br>  Getty Museum - The Getty's architecture is so beautiful that it keeps me fascinated. No matter whether you like their art or architecture better (or maybe you'll just enjoy the view), the Getty is sure to please. Free.<br>  <br>  Attend a TV taping - You can get free tickets at audiencesunlimited.com, tvtix.com, or see the booth at Universal City walk. It's very interesting to see a show being taped. The most popular, by far, is the Tonight show with Jay Leno. Check the NBC web site for all the details there.<br>  <br>  Places to eat:<br>  In-N-Out Burger: Multiple locations, best burger in LA, ask anyone.<br>  Pink’s Hot Dogs: 709 N. La Brea, just north of Melrose. You might even see a celebrity. Maybe.<br>  Tommy’s Chili Burgers: Look for the shack, an LA tradition. The original location is at Beverly & Rampart, a couple miles west of downtown.<br>  Canter’s Deli: 419 N. Fairfax, between Beverly & Melrose. Near CBS, you might spot a celebrity.<br>  Phillippe’s: 1001 N. Alameda. Great roast beef sandwiches. Near Union Station and Olvera Street. Watch the mustard, it’s hot.<br>  The Pantry: Corner of Figueroa and 9th, downtown. Huge portions, they never close, GREAT steak and eggs.<br>  <br>  Places to Stay:<br>  Since LA is so spread out, there is no single place that is close to EVERYTHING. Most people who come here tend to stay in Hollywood, Santa Monica, or Anaheim.<br>  In Hollywood, I recommend the Renaissance Hotel at Hollywood and Highland, the Best Western Sunset Plaza, or the Holiday Inn Walk of Fame. <br>  In Santa Monica, the Holiday Inn Santa Monica is close to the pier and reasonably priced.<br>  In Anaheim, I recommend the Howard Johnson (HoJo) Anaheim, and the Candy Cane Inn. <br>  <br>  Places to Shop:<br>  Third Street Promenade, Santa Monica<br>  The Grove, Los Angeles<br>  Americana @ Brand, Glendale<br>  Beverly Center, Los Angeles<br>  Citadel Outlets, Commerce<br>  Brea Mall, Brea<br>  The Block at Orange, Orange<br>  South Coast Plaza, Costa Mesa<br>  Fashion Island, Newport Beach<br>  Santee Alley, Los Angeles|`|RvoHIPL9aa	go to the American Girl Place (: it just opened a few years ago.|`|SLEWs28Waa	umm if u dont like roller costers.. dont go to six flags.. theres not much else to do there.. disney land is alot of variety and is really cool.. if youve got younger kids its your best bet...Universal studios you could live with out but citywalk is cool which is like the outdoor shopping part. just know all 3 of these parks are in 3 very different locations of LA and disneyland is actually about an hour drive from LA, magic mountain is in the valley so its like 30 min away, Universal is pretty central.. dont get too caught up on the amusement parks.. LA has alot to offer.. also if your going during the summer Magic mountain has a water park called Huricane Harbor..<br>  Have Fun!
tPPZ0QDmaa	You'll have zero problems finding herb.  After you clear customs / immigration in the airport, it'll be offered to you.  I never buy it in the airport just because there's too many people just standing around.  The less eyes on me the better.  <br>  <br>  If you're taking a taxi to Ochi, the taxi driver will more than likely have it on him.  If not, just ask.  You can also ask the staff at your hotel.  Security guards, bartenders, and gardeners will gladly get it for you.<br>  <br>  Now about price.  An ounce will run you anywhere from $40 - $60.  Never pay the first price quoted you.  Knock the price lower than you want to pay and work from there.  Be fair though!  They're trying to make a living as well.  You'll encounter many varieties there.  About half of what you see there will have seeds.  But like anywhere else, check out the product first.  Look the bag over good--they won't weigh it up, so make sure its a fair deal for yourself.  <br>  <br>  You'll be able to smoke pretty much anywhere.  If you're in doubt, don't smoke.

Q2Hd6v6Faa	1 - ichi<br>  2 - ni<br>  3 - san<br>  4 - yon / shi<br>  5 - go<br>  6 - roku (i've never heard of it being 'lok' but seeing as the japanese don't have an 'L' in their alphabet, i doubt this is correct)<br>  7 - nana / shichi<br>  8 - hachi<br>  9 - kyu<br>  10 - jyu<br>  <br>  the reason for the multiple readings of the number 4, is that the number 4 for the japanese is similar to the number 13 for others. 4 is their typically unlucky number. the reading 'shi' also means death, and hence the second reading of 'yon'. <br>  <br>  for different situations and counters for objects, the different readings for 4 and 7 are used. typically, 'yon' and 'shichi' are the most often correct for 4 and 7, although, unless you are specifically told which reading goes with what, either reading will convey the same message. 'yon' and 'shichi' are the more polite ways of saying 4 and 7, rather than 'shi' and 'nana'.<br>  <br>  hope this helped.|`|Q3RqWHFsaa	Japanese has some rule for counting like numerals and nouns.<br>  <br>  numeral /  noun /  each peace to say /each sheet to say / each bottle to say<br>  1 hitotsu      ichi           i-kko             ichi-mai       i-ppon<br>  2 futatsu       ni            ni-ko              ni-mai         ni-hon<br>  3 mittsu       san          san-ko           san-mai      san-bon<br>  4 yottsu  (shi or) yon   yon-ko            yon-mai      yon-hon<br>  5 itsutsu      go            go-ko             go-mai         go-hon<br>  6 muttsu      roku        ro-kko             roku-mai     ro-ppon<br>  7 nanatsu (sichi or)nana   nana-ko     nana-mai     nana-hon<br>  8 yattsu       hachi       hachi-ko(or ha-kko)    hachi-mai  hachi-hon<br>  9 kokonotsu kyuu        kyuu-ko          kyuu-mai     kyuu-hon<br>  10 toh-oo     Jyuu         jyu-kko           jyuu-mai      jyu-ppon<br>  <br>  Those above suffix if necessary may change on subject by subject what is counted.

XPqRthwraa	I am from London and have lived in America now for 5 years. London is very expensive. The weather is always cold or rainy. On the other hand, every american I know loves London.  The economy is just as bad there at the moment as it is here so jobs would not be that easy to find. Yes we all speak funny with that british accent but you guys seem to love that.  The pubs are great, I miss the english pubs and fish and chips LOL. The fashion is good. The english follow fashion but because the dollar is weak it is quite costly to live there much more so then living in the USA or Canada I would imagine. Public transport is great. Everyone travels by bus or tube unlike here where absolutely everyone drives. Anyone good luck if you decide to go, I'm sure you would have a grat time.|`|FKR45WLPaa	My niece is in Oxford there.

Since I assume you are going at night and you are over 21 (or at least 18), there are dance clubs (The Ruby, cheesy but fun) movies at Grauman's or the El Capitan and a few places to eat. Even just walking up and down Hollywood Blvd. can be fun but of course, be careful. I wouldn't recommend Venice because it is literally on the other side of town and the drive at any time of the day is a pain in the butt. It only takes one car to mess everything up and you're stuck in traffic for hours. Stay local in Hollywood and you will find plenty to do.
Oz2NNuJkaa	No-one lives in Antarctica permanently or even for a long period of time. Most people do a "summer only" that's about November to April, with a lesser number staying over the Antarctic winter (when any chance of transport in or out is virtually impossible), some stay for two winters and three summers, this is the longest time any one stays there. Some people have had an "enforced" winter This is when ice conditions mean the ship that should have come to get them couldn't get through and had to go home without them until next year. The result is a wait from April until October / November or later when the ship can get through again. This means three summers and three winters in a row!<br>  The only "settlements" are scientific bases. These vary in size, but typically have 50 people there in the summer and 15-20 in the winter (Antarctica is never really talked about as having spring or autumn/fall), summer lasts from October/November to March/April, the rest of the year is considered to be winter.

We went with a large group, and we had so much fun!  For starters, we had 2 large vans reserved for us at the airport.  My tip here - have your entire party go on the shuttle together to the rental car place, that way you won't get separated.  (It's pretty far away.)  We stayed at the Mirage, which was very comfortable, and the rooms were gorgeous!  If you look at a map and stick to the hotels right by the Mirage, like Treasure Island and Bellagio, you'll be staying in a very nice part of town that is lovely to walk in front of at night.  You can watch the Sirens show in front of Treasure Island for free, as well as the Lava eruptions in front of the Mirage, and just walking around this area at night is lovely.  I don't suggest walking down to New York New York with your daughter, as there are lots of shady sorts on the street handing out cards for "escorts", and it's a bit seedy.  The double decker busses are a nice option, and only cost $3.00.  New York New York has some fun areas that are in the casino but away from the gambling that look like funky New York streets, plus there's the very fast exciting roller coaster!  (It's hard on us old folks, it really shakes you up, but your daughter will love it!)    <br>  <br>  I have a favorite site that keeps track of the Travelocity promo codes and weekly specials, and I noticed that they are running a special for Las Vegas right now, so you might check to see if it works for you:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://scotgould.com/travelocity-weekly-deals/" rel="nofollow">http://scotgould.com/travelocity-weekly-...</a><br>  <a href="http://scotgould.com/travel-velocity-promo-codes-and-coupons/" rel="nofollow">http://scotgould.com/travel-velocity-pro...</a><br>  <br>  And here's my most exciting suggestion - if any of you likes Nascar and fast cars, you can ride in a race car with a professional drive and go 140 miles per hour 4 times around the real Nascar track with the Richard Petty Experience - all 20 of us did!!!  And we all loved it!!!  Here's the link:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.1800bepetty.com/experience/Experience.aspx" rel="nofollow">http://www.1800bepetty.com/experience/Ex...</a><br>  <br>  And also, we went on a very nice drive to Red Rock, and took the loop scenic drive the Bureau of Land Management (BLM) operates, it was gorgeous!!!<br>  <br>  For tickets to shows, you might call the hotel you book at and ask to speak to the concierge, and ask for their sugestions for your group.  The concierge would be the best bet for getting you discount tickets! Same thing for shopping, the hotels have lovely shopping areas, and the statues show at Ceasars is a lot of fun, and free.  <br>  <br>  Have a fabulous and safe trip!|`|A6F6Zk6daa	AIRFARE --- For your airline tickets, try Southwest Airlines. I think they have tickets to Vegas for just under $ 100 a person now, I may be wrong though. <br>  <br>  HOTELS -- Vegas is hurting BAD. I just booked our rooms at the MGM tonight, 5 nights (including a Friday night) for $ 327. That would be unheard of years ago. I've seen the Bellagio as low as $ 150 a night, which is dirt cheap. <br>  <br>  Stay away from the cheap hotels, because that's exactly what they are. You will get what you pay for. These would include Circus Circus, Imperial Palace, Sahara, Tropicana, and ESPECIALLY the Stratosphere. <br>  <br>  I'd go with MGM, Caesars, the Flamingo is reasonable, Luxor or New York New York. If you don't mind a lot of kids, Excalibur is good too. <br>  <br>  or.....<br>  <br>  If you want a really, really nice hotel to stay off the strip, check out South Point (www.southpointcasino.com) -- they are a good 10 minutes south of Mandalay Bay on Las Vegas Blvd, but it's a great place to stay, we've stayed there the last three years. I'd stay there again, but my wife is nagging us to stay at MGM this time. You will have to rent a car if you're going to stay there, but it's worth it. They have NICE rooms for around $55 a night and the rooms are very nice.<br>  <br>  SHOWS -- any Cirque show is good. I think we're going to try to get tickets for "O" at the Bellagio. If you are a Beatles fan, you MUST see "Love" at the Mirage. It's phenominal. Pricy, but phenominal. You've never seen anything like it.<br>  <br>  SHOPPING -- try the forum shops in Caesars or the Fashion Show Mall across from Treasure Island.<br>  <br>  PROMO CODES -- retailmenot.com   that's where I got our MGM room so cheap at. It's best to grab the code from there and then book on the hotel's website direct, you have more leniant cancellation policies and don't have to pay everything up front like you would on hotels.com or Tripres.<br>  <br>  OTHER THINGS TO DO -- if you have a rental car, check out the Hoover Dam or Red Rock. <br>  <br>  Hope this helps!
JOoqy9doaa	i have no idea if the border will be closed, but i have a hard time believing the border is just "impassable" through the night hours. the passports will be fine. Just get on I-5 and head south. if your coming down monday-friday, during the early morning hours, traffic will be horrible from 20 miles north of Seattle all the way into the city. But, i suggest you just stick it out on i-5 instead of trying to find other roads... it may not be fun but youll make it (plus i doubt youll be driving in during the wee morning hours anyhow). going back, the traffic should be fine. if you have any other inquiry, check www.wsdot.wa.gov!|`|4WEBY6Qkaa	it's super easy. all you have to is show the security guard your id card. plus it's never closed, unless there is a terrorism alert level 4 and up.|`|pgFD4n1Caa	Super easy!

fFnsJ7maaa	Well, you are going from small town to small town. Woodward is outside State College, PA, and in the middle of nowhere. (BEAUTIFUL scenery though, rolling hills, Amish farms.)  The nearest real airport is State College, abbreviated SCE. Better deals are from Harrisburg. You are going to have to rent a car or be picked up, taxi isn't really an option. (If you are going to the sports camp, call them for travel advice. I believe they bus from State College and somewhere in New Jersey.)    Trumbull is near White Plains airport and the NYC airports as well as Bradley in Hartford. You have many many options. You will probably have to change planes to get to State College.|`|zgvpytABaa	well, there is not an airport in Trumbull.  Where were you planning on departing from?

B3FBgxjEaa	Star of David comprises two of the three letters in the name David. In its Hebrew spelling, it contains only three characters, two of which are "D" (or "Dalet", in Hebrew). In ancient times, this letter was written in a form much like a triangle, similar to the Greek letter Delta, with which it shares a sound and the same (4th) position in their respective alphabets, as it does with English. The symbol may have been a simple family crest formed by flipping and juxtaposing the two most prominent letters in the name.<br>  <br>  England has a large Muslim population, the british flag has a cross in it, SO ??<br>  <br>  There are 33 countries in the world with a cross in flag all have a Muslim population.<br>  <br>  Dead sea, this is the what you do there. <br>  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aeq-BBBVzrU&feature=related" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aeq-BBBVz...</a><br>  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxBwHxLqgAU&feature=related" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxBwHxLqg...</a><br>  <br>  <br>  The wall "rolled up pieces of paper".<br>  People put notes into the Western Wall every single day. The idea is not that we are praying to the Wall (that would be like talking to a wall!), but rather it is known that the Divine Presence rests on the Western Wall more than other places. (see - Exodus 2:2 and Song of Songs 2:4) <br>  <br>  Furthermore, the Talmud teaches that all prayers ascend to heaven through Jerusalem. So writing a prayer on a piece of paper and sticking it in the Wall is like having a continual prayer linked to the prime source. <br>  <br>  Significance of the wailing wall<br>  The Western Wall in the midst of the Old City in Jerusalem is the section of the Western supporting wall of the Temple Mount which has remained intact since the destruction of the Second Jerusalem Temple (70 C.E.). It became the most sacred spot in Jewish religious and national consciousness and tradition by virtue of its proximity to the Western Wall of the Holy of Holies in the Temple, from which, according to numerous sources, the Divine Presence never departed. It became a center of mourning over the destruction of the Temple and Israel's exile, on the one hand, and of religious - in 20th century also national - communion with the memory of Israel's former glory and the hope for its restoration, on the other. Because of the former association, it became known in European languages as the "Wailing Wall".|`|0fW76gB8aa	- The Israeli flag has the Star of David because Israel is a Jewish state.

People black, white and other racial groups are free to do what they like just like anyone else, and are in no form of danger. <br>  In terms of interracial couples, that's not a problem at all, In cape town and in other parts of SA you will find interracial couples who have children that are biracial. <br>  To be honest, its strange for me to be talking about interracial couples as its really not an issue.<br>  South Africa celebrates its richness in diversity, and looking back at our History (Apartheid) and looking where we are now, is really amazing. Many people come visit from all over the world. Cape Town was named the most visited city in Africa, even beating Egypt.<br>  I assure you, that you and your family have nothing to worry about and that you will have an amazing time here. After all, it was because of reasons such as this that the people of South Africa took a stand against Apartheid and fought for their freedom.

Let us take this Talith from its bag and unroll it before the eyes of Israel and the eyes of all nations. So I ordered a blue and white flag with the Shield of David painted upon it.

ac7e0f50f58632b431b5cf5de0564ffbaa	You want "underground"? How about the subway.    It's interesting that you would consider ANYTHING in Hollywood as being "run of the mill". If that were true, there wouldn't be millions of people gawking there. It's rather easy to become jaded in this town.    How about this: Take the Amtrak or Metrolink from the OC into Union Station. Go across the street to Phillippe's for a roast beef sandwich, or go to one of the Mexican restaurants on Olvera Street. They're a bit touristy, but good enough that locals go there regularly. Also, get a churro from the churro guy on the right side of the street, by the glass blower. These are HOT, freshly made.    Then take the Red Line north to Hollywood & Highland. You can easily spend the whol day just at Hollywood & Highland, if you like. But you might want to take a walk down Hollywood Blvd (go east). If you want to look smart, point out all the art deco architecture on the old buildings (a personal favorite of mine). They just don't put detail like that into buildings any more. There are tons of interesting, non-tourist, out-of-of the-way shops, eateries, and clubs. Let me know if Basque has been repaired (HUGE fire there last year).     If you have time or want to do it another day, it's fun to take the Red Line to City Walk. That's another place you can spend the day.    If you EVER start to get tired of the same old places, try looking (and listening) to the people that come here to visit. We take all this stuff for granted, but for the first-time visitors from Podunk, Iowa, this is like Mars. Help a tourist out and give them the benefit of your local expertise. Have fun eavesdropping in on people by sitting a a table next to a group of tourists. It's really interesting to see what they think of the place.    Anyway, have fun!|`|01828ba3a2ceab3b3b6ed1d24349e9d6aa	The Roxy  The Whiskey  The House of Blues  The Key Club  The Coconut Teazer    They are here  www.laweekly.com|`|Ww0xfq5Aaa	....thinking of stuff guys like to do   hike up Griffith Park of Runyon Canyon  if something is going on...Hollywood Bowl  Guitar Center on Sunset  Santa Monica is a 10 min drive from Hollywood, spend some time @ the pier.

OYYYNCyCaa	generally kanacka's are from the top end of queensland|`|uAyYRXnvaa	In the History books.|`|Fnp2MIycaa	The term 'Kanaka' is now recognised as derogative.<br>  <br>  Between 1863 and 1891, a total of 46,387 South Pacific Islanders were brought to work in Queensland where the sugar industry was undergoing a massive expansion. In 1871 there had been 9581 acres of land under cane; by 1898 that figure was 111,012 acres.<br>  <br>  The islanders were 'contracted' for a period of three years. Forworking ten hours a day they were paid the meagre wage of 6 pounds per year; equal to 4 pence per day. At least the lucky ones were, some were paid nothing at all. <br>  <br>  A total of 7068 Islanders were repatriated between 1904 and 1908 and another 194 suffered the same fate between1909 and 1914. After the 1906 Royal Commission exemptions were granted to some. As a result 1,500 were officially allowed to stay in Australia and a further 1,000 remained illegally. Today their descendants number around 20,000 and form a substantial part of the population in the coastal sugar towns of Queensland and northern New South Wales.|`|A5XV6WSZaa	Kanaka is an offensive term for native people from the pacific islands. Originally meaning only those natives of Hawaii, it did for some time refer to enslaved  Australian aboriginals. I believe refering to a Koorie or any of the other clans as a "kanaka" would not be taken particularly well.  Bit like using the "n" word...you just don"t|`|5WP9rLTlaa	You won't. those people got integrated into the aboriginal population of the area where they were found. The aboriginals did not keep records of peoples ancestry so the Kanackas ceased to exist. Those that didn't join an aboriginal tribe where able to get back to their native regions. Also there weren't that many kanackas to begin with, why bother buying them from slavers when you could use the natives for free?
d6b1Dke1aa	It depends on if you want to just SEE the Atlantic Ocean, or if you want a warm vacation.<br>  <br>  It's around 8-9 hours to Ocean City, Maryland.. You could get a cheap hotel this time of year and hit the Boardwalk... <br>  <br>  Or, trek it down to Florida and hit any of the beaches there.  I am partial to St. Augustine, or Daytona.  Daytona Bike Week is next week, if that appeals to you..
AA12086491	Anywhere from Maine to Florida, what are you wanting to see in particular?  I recommend Maryland, but you will probably have to take a train and then rent a car in Baltimore. Otherwise go to Delaware, they have good beaches there.

Gj4o5222aa	I'm not sure I'd want to make that trip in March - it's still winter.  A lot of the lodges along the Alaska Highway have closed this winter.  One thing you should definitely not leave home without is a copy of The Milepost.

40HICcNOaa	Paris to Madrid is a very very long train ride (≈ 11-13 hours), but I'm positive it's very beautiful.  To Barcelona is only about 8 and a half, or 14 if you do it on an overnight train, but may not cut through the Pyrenees in the same way as a more Central train would.  It depends somewhat on where you want to end up in Spain.  If you're in Madrid, you can pretty well get anywhere else -- including Seville (and even down to Morocco!), while if you're in Barcelona (an absolutely incredibly city in itself), you're much farther away from the rest of Spain.   Catalan culture is definitely worth soaking up, though.  Enjoy!

htBHCNDtaa	I'd say yes, I went there a few months ago (with my mother though) but it didn't seem more dangerous than any other city in Australia. Keep in mind traveling alone can always have it risks, so don't stay out too late in areas you don't know.<br>  <br>  Also, Perth has a nice Chinatown with lots of great restaurants :)|`|k6M48eUMaa	Yep, for sure. There isn't alot of crime at all in Australia, and I think the country is quite safe in general.|`|90tPT5nlaa	Yes, all of Australia is very safe. Hope you have a great time.|`|oyfCfz81aa	It really depends what you are doing....<br>  <br>  If you stick to touristy places, or busy areas, then Perth is a very safe place.<br>  <br>  Common sense rules apply - like anywhere in the world.  If you hang around pubs in the early hours of the morning by yourself, then your asking for trouble!  Stay away from congregation of drunken groups. <br>  <br>  As a general rule, being in the city until midnight on a weekend, and 10pm on a weeknight, you''ll be fine.  <br>  <br>  If you are travelling around WA, then you'll find most areas very safe.<br>  <br>  Hope this helps!<br>  <br>  Marty|`|MI3r3jWeaa	Yep, I'd say so. In any city in Australia your pretty safe, Just don't stay out late at night by yourself. There always is a risk though|`|JoVrAhAVaa	if your question is are asians welcome here ,That's up to you as we don't have a problem , singles girls always take a risk where ever they are at home or away just don't be stupid that's all|`|TXIhaoFEaa	I would say that Perth would be pretty safe, being a female in the area, I have never had any problems here.

g8LLIeXKaa	Please look on your school's (college, university, etc) website. They often have a link and info to public transportation. This way you know that it is accurate.    Don't worry about the wrong category, you had "B4" in your title and Yahoo! Answer assumed you were talking about one of our M.T.A. buses which operates between Sheepshead Bay and Bay Ridge.    Until you get your car, see if any classmates has a car and don't mind carpooling with you.    Once you get your wheels, alternate with them each week so you don't put too much wear and tear on your car and also put crap into the air.    Good luck with your studies.

r4xRkqzdaa	THERE ARE NO SHUTTLES OR TRAINs in ohare.  you just have to walk... and in my expirience it's a pretty long walk.  if you are going international, an hour may not be enough time to go thru customs, but if you are going US to US flight you'll be fine.<br>  <br>  go to a place where you can see a bunch of TV's and double check the gate that your plan is taking off from- it is not always the same as what it should be- look at the signs that hang from the ceiling and that should direct you to were you need to go.  print out a map from the airport online or take it from the magazine in the seat back pocket of your last flight<br>  <br>  in ohare, there always is a strong chance either plane will be delayed, overbooked or at a different gate than what your boarding pass will say|`|ULbkPIGdaa	From the link below the travel time of 1 hour shouldn't be that hard to get from 3 to 5. If there is snow there probably is a chance of flights being delayed depending on how severe.|`|TS5z0SPwaa	You should be able to make it with time to spare. Terminal 5 is the international terminal at O'Hare. There are signs hanging from the ceilings that will direct you to the shuttle train. I have flown into & out of O'Hare 2 - 3 times each month for the last 3 years for work & personal travel. Depending on how much it snows if any you might be delayed. They are usually good about clearing the runways. You have to try a Chicago style hot dog while you are there. The Vienna Beef hot dogs are so much better than the Nathan's you get on the east coast. <br>  Jess, Have you ever flown into or out of O'Hare there is a shuttle train. <br>  <a href="http://www.flychicago.com/ohare/concessionsohare/pdf/OHareMainMapFINAL.pdf" rel="nofollow">http://www.flychicago.com/ohare/concessi...</a>
rbanG8FRaa	Terminal 5 is the international terminal which is separate from the rest of OHare. It may be reached from the rest of the airport by using the ATS (airport transportation system, free). <br>  When you deplane, head toward the entrance of the airport and exit the secured area. Follow the signs that say Terminal 5, ATS and get on the it will direct you to the waiting area for the tram. It runs frequently.  Once in Terminal 5 you will need to go through security again. People are helpful so if your not sure just stop and ask someone if you are heading in the right direction. The signs in OHare are pretty good so you shouldn't have much of a problem finding your way.<br>  An hour is enough time as long as nothing is delayed.|`|AA11526235	Delays are common at O'hare, so don't panic if your flight arrives late.  If you booked the whole trip at one sitting, they might even hold the plane a few minutes.  Catching the shuttle could be tricky, but you can get directions and most of the time, they'll get you where you want to go just fine.  Personally, I never took the shuttle because I found it easier to walk.|`|xUOPWPTnaa	First, I would highly recommend you check out this previously asked question, <a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?qid=20081120174439AAVC4X0">http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?...</a> ; as it should help you with most of your question. Second, you really need to hope for fast feet and short security lines, not to mention an on-time arriving flight, because an 1 hour and 5min is not much time. If your arriving flight is on-time, the tram/shuttle doesn't take long (less than 5 min), and you rarely have to wait more than a few minutes for it. Security is another big variable, as you will go through it again in Terminal 5. I personally have not been in that particular security checkpoint, but <a href="http://www.tsa.gov/travelers/waittime.shtm" rel="nofollow">http://www.tsa.gov/travelers/waittime.sh...</a> is a good gauge, although the site seems to be under construction right now. Finally, delays in chicago? Doesn't take snow to do that. Sure less than perfect weather doesn't help anything, but as long as it is nothing too major its nothing the airport isn't used to. If I knew what day you are leaving I would be able to give you a better answer as far as the weather. Hope this helps. Best of luck.|`|b6492af9f829700729dbaa961190869aaa	There is a tram running between terminals at O'Hare aproximately every 5 to 7 minutes.  You will have to leave the secure side of terminal 3 and board the tram to get to terminal 5 (international).  You will see it when you exit terminal 3.  It seems difficult, but it's actually quite simple.  Ask a TSA person if you need help.  I have worked in terminal 3 and the employees are quite friendly.

8K5Aiqq5aa	you mean bargain? well, typical prices are marked up a lot compared to the original prices that a local will get. in other words, you are screwed if you are a tourist. how much you can actually get discounted depends on how much time and energy you are willing to spend.<br>  <br>  Best way to do it would be, let's say you want to buy a souvenoir and the price is $100USD. ask for the price first, and then pretend to be in total shock and amazed. offer the price of $10. the vendor will act in disbelief and say no way. keep on repeating it and then 'threaten' the vendor by acting as if you are about the leave the store. most likely when you do this enough times, you'll be able to knock the price down by at least 50% or more.

High moutain such as Mt. Fuji  is always much more colder than normal seashore. You'd have to consider what kind of cloths are better or not by commonsense. It is very hot and humid for walking around in Summer even after sunset in Japan except Hokkaido. Spring and Autumn are both better than two other seasons.<br>  <br>  Adjustable attire is always better than fixed and limited preparation for going to unusual places. If you are petit size, you may try to buy some local cloths on the streeet in Japan. If your size are sort of larger side, it is impossible to get those easily though.<br>  <br>  Most of the sightseeing places even inside of the building are OK to take pictures without electronic flash. Strobe light even with cellphone is prohibited inside of most temples. You may ask priests or anybody near you if you can take strobed pictures at there one to one. <br>  <br>  Asking Itself is not to be disrespetful. Gardens are generally free to take pictures but usually most of  all famous gardens may require you admission. In Japan, you can take picture at outside freely in public such as station, port, airport, street, park. Japan seems it is spy-friendly country too.

Most of those places are far from anything of interest to visitors and there's no way you would wind up in them even by accident.<br>  <br>  Most of Brooklyn is fine, the main part of Harlem is fine, and there's no problem going to Yankee Stadium or the Bronx Zoo.|`|QX2xnrhWaa	@ zoe: you're talking about the Western part of Brooklyn - and you're right about it.  But East Brooklyn is a different story.  To answer the asker's question, I'd avoid the East New York and Brownsville areas of Brooklyn.|`|VFlzyzv0aa	Bronx?  Not much.  Just use your head and don't be stupid.  It's not very  hard to not get in trouble.

Q3RqWHFsaa	I don't think that your one year exchange student program let you take any direct or automatic effect to go into college in Japan. You will take a tremendous progress to know Japanese well but need still a lot of things to pass the entry to college there usually.<br>  <br>  Some Japanese colleges, however, might admit some limited students on the strength of recommendations from their close-friendly high schools. It seems that the possibility about what you want will be quite slim but still remain. <br>  <br>  The best possibility would be that your stationed high school is subsidized with one of Japanese colleges and there is some recommendation system about admission from the high school to the college if student taken good workout for study there.  <br>  <br>  In that case, it would be more flexible to step up to the college much more than something else totally different you need to compete with other Japanese candidates from zero. You may survive as far as you have enough budget to pay tuition and daily living for college life in Japan. <br>  <br>  So  I think the most important matter is not when but which school if you want to go to Japanese college through Japanese high school.
