b3a93efc8d41cab988d722a13d6d8547aa	i dont even know where you could find the information, like brand and season, but i would try the video production company if you know what that is.  plus, clothing has seasons.  ever notice how it gets to the store one day, and a few weeks later its on sale, then clearance.  once that happens, its gone.  you might be able to try ebay or second hand stores.

A stupid young woman on a mobile phone ran into the back of me whilst I was waiting to turn right.  She wrote my car off and I still don't have one.|`|efe84b7f6da67ab7f16953aec019b750aa	Yes.  They say that everyone will at least have one in their life.  Mine was minor...I hope that was it.:-)|`|CBNC40sDaa	Yes,  three times.  Each time, it was someone else who ran into me.|`|68MfVJwGaa	yea but i wasnt drivin, my bro was... though nthin happened to us thank God|`|Hs011wnraa	Yeah, I was only little :(|`|2rTeHIVyaa	no|`|crFPLMbsaa	yes 1  but i wasn't at fault.    i was re-building an old car and i was almost finished.  i rubbed back and straightened all the body, put nice wheels on it, painted it with a blue/purple metallic pearl that changes colour depending on the angle of the sun and angle of view.  it looked better than a brand new car!    all i needed to do next was put in the new engine which was a rotary.    then one day i was driving on my way home and a few streets away from my house a lady ignored her red light and t-boned me on a main road and hammered my car.   she totalled my car and glass also flew into my face and she didn't even care. she was driving some cheap bomb of a car.  she also had the nerve to lie about the whole thing to the police and insurance company.    she also had a witness and i didn't, which sucked for me.    she had a baby in a baby seat as well, you'd think if your baby is in the car you would be more careful when driving.    after around 7 months the truth came out as she slipped up and changed her story, while her witness was telling the other story.. so it was apparent that i was the one telling the truth. (which i was)    they also had other facts taken from the scene of the accident.    her insurance wanted to take my car for scrap and pay me a really small amount of money but i refused. i demanded they return it to the exact condition it was in before their customer crashed into me.    it was hard  my car was off the road for over a year because of it  and it is almost back to how it was.    in the end i still believe i lost  i lost my car for more than a year, being a full time student that was very hard.  i had to import parts from another state  and now my car isn't the exact same colour that it was before.. so that means inside the door and engine bay it is a slightly different colour.    so im now with a car that isn't the exact same colour all over + im without my front indicators and chromed bumper and other chrome strips i used to have. i also have a couple of broken things in my engine bay that we couldn't find replacement parts for.    that's a fair few thousand dollars work to fix all that  and it all could have been avoided if the lady stopped at her red light and didn't lie about the whole situation.      so that is my story  sorry it was so long|`|26ac3d63a2f34ca5401f7ec4b6d5fd7daa	I'm on L's and I had a car accident on the 13/12/08.    yes it was my fault.    No i didn't get hrut but my mum was badly hurt and my cousin was unconscious.    I felt really bad, heartbroken shocked and I felt like the worst in the world. I cant describe how abd I felt. I was in so much shock coz I'm a good driver. i;m the alst person you would think would ahve an accident.    Yes my car was totalled.|`|UM2sQa3Naa	No but my accident had a car once O.o|`|apFR4Z4Oaa	yes|`|ZvRetOZAaa	Nearly.|`|eZKmubDBaa	YES... they are ALL DEAD...

The Guy was deeply injured    2) I was saying goodbye to a friend at the end of a night and than i drove while i was waving and than i hit a guy in front of me .. Ya .. it was bad !! But i took him to the Hospital and now he is Ok ..|`|FQP3VGeVaa	I myself haven't because I am only 13.  But I've been in a car when it crashed.|`|1m53f57paa	Yes. My last accident was in 1988. The sun was in my eyes and I ended up running a stop sign. I almost made it through the intersection. However a car was coming and it "T-boned" my rear bumper, bending it out behind my vehicle. No one was hurt but their car was not driveable after the accident. The lady driver was yelling and screaming and calling me every name in the book! Luckily her boyfriend was very calm. He called the police. I got a ticket for running the stop sign and the police told me I could leave. I felt bad that their car was so damaged. That's the last I heard about it.|`|qKayh9rvaa	Yes  I have. Thankfully it wasn't my fault.|`|vfdeZg1Uaa	yes I have x

I really dont like DC all that much, and Moon Knight and the Punisher are my favorite characters. I also really love shonen jump. Deathnote, Naruto, and Bleach are some of the greatest series of all time. If you have never read deathnote, you really need to. it is the best.|`|v0rItkjkaa	looks like I am the only one who likes DC, but then again, Marvel is a LOT more original when it comes to origin stories|`|K1GYtYryaa	Marvel is my favorite.  Recent they have had some great storylines.  I like DC too but with all their crisis recently its been really hard to follow.  It would not be cool for them to merge.  Check out Amalgam Comics.  It has a bunch of one shots  where DC and Marvel Characters merged
tLI94qWNaa	I REMEMBER THIS SHOW:D  I always wondered what happened to this show.  I use to love it, and her mom was like a singer and they lived in a RV and supernatural things would always happen.  I loved this show, that is so sad that they stopped.  I agree with you, I wish they would bring this back, it left so many things unanswered.  Wow, thanks for bringing back these great memories.

EcTTRWDlaa	The two best ones, but both have implemented rather strict limits on how many you can download at a time due to bandwith overloads.     -MiniTokyo - http://www.minitokyo.net/  -Anime Paper - http://www.animepaper.net/    *AnimePaper is taking flak for accepting "donations" & not giving the money to the artists.  So individuals have "ripped" the site & taken all its content & offering it for free with no limits.  http://aprip.net/    If you're old enough & willing to browse through the infamous 4chan, then check out their Anime Wallpapers section (relatively clean sub-forum for 4chan).  It's relatively unorganized, but you can make requests & it offers some great HQ wallpapers.      ------------------  And for those who answer Animewallpapers.com  http://www.animewallpapers.com/  That site is rather old & not releasing the latest & HQ works.|`|WzJLmXTiaa	google immages best answer please and i will give you star|`|TQYof9Whaa	http://www.animepaper.net/|`|aGP3AUDVaa	Depends on what anime that you like!

Goal Weight-70lbs, his lyrics arne't even done (i think because it doesn't seem like its done considering he's like "what else) so therefore you can't say he's talented (not saying you aren't) because his song isn't done.  Just thought to tell ya that! :P   But i'm not sure what else you should add 'caz im not a songwritter who writes metal..  It doesn't seem metal tho. It sounds more rap song. I think what you need to do for it to be metal is to like write it in poetry form. Talk about something that you have feelings on. Then when you sing it you scream/and have havey metal.

c6Rb8f3Gaa	Wow, these questions of yours are such an exercise lately :)    Are you the Venus person, Kat?    The difference is that synastry represents the way you interact as two separate beings, while a composite chart represents your union as a separate and autonomous entity. It is about your relationship, not you two as individuals. So, a composite Venus would stand for its romantic substance, the Moon for the emotional one, etc.     Venus in the 2nd is really good...that's a natural house for Venus. I think the conjunction with Pluto will either bring very good results or very bad ones...perhaps it would help if you found out which houses they rule. From my experience with the relative transit (Pluto to my Venus), though, I could say it probably indicates some effort and pain at first, but it is undoubtedly worth all of it :) Although not everyone experiences those things in the same way....but since you're a Scorpio, I guess you're used to intensity, anyway.    Composite aspects cannot be used as an antidote for harsh synastry aspects, IMO. You have no control over your composite chart. In case you're asking if it could make up for the bad aspects, though, I guess it could hold some sort of hope that despite any problematic interaction, you could stand the test of time. But once again, this is entirely up to the couple.      edit: You're welcome :) In order to answer your question about that square, though, I'll have to know who is the Sun and who is Venus. Although, at a first glance, I have to admit I can't see how a Sun-Venus aspect would relate to sexual problems...Romantic interaction issues, yes (even though squares are not always bad, because the feeling of tension can sometimes cause excitement, if it's not too much) But this aspect itself cannot justify sexual misunderstandings.    Well, there could be something I haven't thought of, but I still believe that Venus-Sun contacts are not a key to sexual interaction. This is more of a Mars (and possibly Pluto) issue.. Of course they could contribute to a better feeling of the whole experience, because our charts always work as a whole, not as individual planets. But still, I don't think this aspect can create such a problem all by itself. You'll need something more in order to trigger such problems.     As for that square, the only disadvantage I see is that there could be times when one's love gestures are not recognized and therefore appreciated by the other and as a result this could cause frustration to both of you, deriving from a seeming lack of fairness between you. It is possible that one or both could feel they give too much to the other, but get nothing in return. It is very important that you get to know each other's way(s) of showing affection and that you both realize love is meant to be unconditional, so there is no reason to feel you have to give something in return when loved is offered to you.     Good luck!
ebD1plKNaa	A very nice website (visually speaking).  But it is all extremely speculative and has no real facts to back up their hypothesis.  I don't know if the earth will have a catastrophic incident in 2012 or not.  I haven't been there yet.  But I do know that one day, whenever that is, I will die.  When that happens, I'm prepared.  I don't have an emergency space shuttle ready to lift me off to another place where I can survive, I just know Jesus and He promised me that if I trust in Him, that I will live forever in Heaven with Him, even after my body dies.  I don't understand how that will work, I just accept it.  Because of that, the IHC website doesn't cause me anymore worry than I had yesterday.|`|11CJtcG1aa	Very interesting. My friends are all reading the 2012 book. Half think it's garbage, close to another half think humans will blow themselves up before then, and only one guy believes it is possible the Mayan calendar theories are correct.    This site is difficult to take seriously. It looks like so many spoof sites I have seen. It may be serious, it may be a joke. I don't know.    BUT, the "lottery" thing is hard to swallow. They talk of "subterranean cities" that can save us all, but if the earth explodes, those do us little good.  And if these cities were needed, they'd have to already start building yesterday, and they seem to still be securing all the funding.|`|6pk6HnuSaa	I have plenty, thanks ?

B7WIZdglaa	I think I already answered this... but if you dont want to play the "game" back w/him, then tell him its all or nothing. If you dont mind playing.. then u act like he does. Call or text him randomly and NOT often. Tell him something is going on this upcoming weekend and that you should go, and then just don't call him. Do what he does to you.|`|y6wikiJDaa	Act like the time you spent apart was nothing. You didn't even notice how long it's been because you've been too busy with your own active life. Aquarius people think independence is sexy. They like to know you have a life of your own. Be as friendly as you want, but don't show the slightest hint of neediness. Aquarius and Sagittarius are the signs that require the most freedom in relationships. If you need a more devoted partner, try a Leo or Scorpio. Actually, any sign would be more doting than an Aquarius.|`|q8NheXZqaa	Aquarius men,when they leave you, do usually so forever because they're pretty cold-hearted, even though they appear friendly. If you call him back, don't have any expectations. Act friendly and you'll at least be able to see what game he's playing.|`|G3lkvGfDaa	Sounds like Uranus or Ouranboros when he came to mate with Gaia and then leave.  Aquarius are known to be independent.  They are people that need space.  That's why they're an air sign.  Perhaps he needed some time to himself.
87yovKYlaa	remembering a time when he was happier|`|jBKiD5ugaa	my birthday :)|`|Btt44Vtwaa	well the video was made to show that this guy has a band, n friends n stuff, n he'z remembering those old days..    there ws a interview wer bryan adams said that He is not depicting the year 1969, but he was referrring to the sexual position of 69.|`|RWEyZZXWaa	Getting people to buy his crappy Canadian brand of rock n' roll is the underlying theme of all Bryan Adams songs.|`|ByWBKf6daa	It's my all time favorite, it's wonderful. The song appears as if Bryan Adams is singing about his younger days, buying a guitar or six string, starting a band which didn't quite work out and then meeting his first love (standing on your mama's porch, oh the way you held my hand I knew that 'twas now or never). It's definitely not about the year 1969 since Adams was only 10 yrs old or so at that time. When asked about the song Adams revealed that it was about sex, it was about the sex posture '69 and hence the title summer of '69. If you listen carefully, you'll find that the song alludes to sex in many ways like : "Man we're killing time, we're young and reckless and needed to unwind", "Back in the summer of '69, me and my baby in a '69"    In spite of that, Summer of 69 is the most played song at school parties, may be because it doesnt catch the eye. UmmSmart of Bryan|`|0PFQipk4aa	he's singing about how he learned to simultaneously please and be pleased.    Dirty mind going....I think its just reminiscing on youth|`|7f2GSDmqaa	Dont know...thats a great song though

0HGqGJYTaa	All sources point to "no", if you go off of sun signs alone. But, I'm a Libra also seeing a Capricorn. It hasn't been pretty the entire ride, but we've been together 3 years now.....and still going. I'm happy with him and the feeling is mutual. I would suggest that you get a copy of you chart as well as his. Try astro.com, it's free.    My honey has some planets in fire and air. I have planets in earth and water. In fact, my Rising is in Capricorn and my moon is in Aquarius. His moon is in Libra. We get along emotionally great.    My suggestions:  I don't think Caps are boring like sources say...we both like going out. In fact, he suggests going out more than I do, because he thinks it's good for us.    You have to be patient with him. They really move slow, like all the earth signs do. When he plans something, don't expect it to be tomorrow as it would with an Aries. It will happen, just not at the speed of light.    Do expect serious talks, but as far as emotions are concerned, don't expect them to be like us. When I fall in love, I will make it know in every way possible. The problem we had in the beginning is that he knew that I loved him, but I didn't know he loved me, even though he did. So, speak up..tell him what you want/need. They aren't mind readers.    They can go a day without contacting you, but he'll be back. Sometimes they secretly test you, so take note of that. I'm no fool and I feel like my intelligence is insulted when he asks the same question over to see if my answer will change as if i forgot that he asked the first time! Lol. Lastly, trust is a key issue. Never give him a reason to doubt you.|`|JUEXlYSTaa	what year?    find out and input your information here  http://astro-software.com/cgi-bin/astro/...  it will tell you the main aspects between the two of you

9ee25102a7763535588f4a899e88f4dcaa	My thanks for Poor, poor classless idiot for saving me my usual copy and paste job.<br>  <br>  I'm sorry (well, no, I'm not!) that you think that to put people straight on their mistakes is some kind of crime. I suppose if we were all as perfect as you, there'd be no problem, would there?<br>  <br>  Anyway, no matter how much you bleat and whine, Bella's Lullaby will NEVER be classical music. Nor will it ever be more than third-rate manufactured instrumental pop poop (there, at least I used another word for you to ridicule). And neither will I stop correcting people who keep making this silly mistake.<br>  <br>  Have a lovely day.|`|rNqF4gIVaa	Yes, the top dead center position for a Chevy 454 is....<br>  <br>  oh, wait a minute...this is not the auto repair forum... its "classical music" - oh, that would mean that my answer would be, er, irrelevant.<br>  <br>  Oh, not to worry nobody cares if you post irrelevant questions... so why would anyone care about irrelevant answers.|`|qThmcR1Aaa	I'd just like to comment on the ridiculous rant in the first "answer." So, let me get this straight: It's wrong to point out the Y!A search function and to tell the poster that the question is off-topic? If so, who's the idiot?
rNqF4gIVaa	O.k.... only Alessandro Scarlatti was an opera composer (of the three) of note, although his son Domenico wrote six operas when he was in his twenties. Domenico is famous for his piano (harpsichord) sonatas of which he wrote over 500. Handels operas are also pretty obscure with opossible exception of Xerxes.<br>  So my selection would be - <br>  <br>  Handel: Concerto No.13 in F, "The Cuckoo and the Nightingale" <br>  & "Watermusik."<br>  <br>  Domenico Scarlatti: Piano Sonatas K.9, K.380, K.450.<br>  <br>  Alessandro Scarlatti: None, pretty much all of his music was for voice... either cantatas or opera.|`|FeygqXuWaa	Sorry, I just have to point out that Handel wrote all sorts of operas, and at least a few of them, including Rodelinda and Julius Caesar, are still performed today.<br>  <br>  But anyways, I'm a fan of his "Harmonious Blacksmith" Air & Variations for keyboard.  He wrote a bunch of other cool Air & Variations, too.<br>  <br>  Pretty much anything by Domenico Scarlatti is pretty cool, but I'm a particular fan of K 122 (I think that's it... D Major, anyways).

32sYRZb7aa	Sweeet, I love school rumble! If you're up for all different types of romantic comedies, try these:<br>  <br>  1. Ouran High School Host Club - HILLARIOUS while still having serious moments, and at times can be extremely random like school rumble ^.^ Yes, there is a dub, and yes you can find it online. Key it into google and I'm positives you'll find some sites. I loved every second of this anime<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6TOl4X2aZ-Y&feature=related" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6TOl4X2aZ...</a><br>  <br>  2. Fruits Basket - At times can be so silly that it's almost pointless, while at other times it's so serious that you'll wonder if it was ever silly or if it was just your imagination. This anime is unforgettable. Watch it all the way through and I can guarantee you'll like it. Yes they have a dub and yes it's online. Try veoh.com, imeem.com, and even youtube.com. Imeem definately has it.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qtyj2o5CNyY" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qtyj2o5CN...</a><br>  <br>  3. Lovely Complex - I would recommend this anime to anyone. It sends a really good message and shows how to COMPLETELY clueless and unlikely people can go together perfectly. It also has funny arguments and fights (not violent ones) between the characters like in school rumble. One of my favorites ^.^ Unfortunately, this doesn't have a dub (yet) but I still think you could give it a try.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FH2LAgETAKU&feature=related" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FH2LAgETA...</a><br>  <br>  4. Kare Kano - More of an older anime but I still think it's worth a shot. The characters are easy to relate to and the focus is more simple - on two characters. It's funny, yet touching - without being overly depressing. This has a dub too and you can watch it on veoh.com<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xp5oj-riTHU" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xp5oj-riT...</a><br>  <br>  5. Kodocha - I have NEVER found anything that matched the pointlessness of School Rumble (not that School Rumble doesn't have a point. It does). NEVER. Until - I watched Kodocha. You will question for a while if it even has a point. So just hold on - because it does. And it seriously rocks, especially if you make it to the second season! The first season is dubbed and can be found on veoh.com, anilinkz.com, youtube.com (I think), and imeem.com. If you can't find it, once again key it in on Google. The second season is not dubbed.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJmKp5e9Z80" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJmKp5e9Z...</a><br>  <br>  6. Skip Beat! - I immediately starting loving this anime. It is so funny, yet sad, and a love interest starts to develop. I would definately recommend this one, especially if you're into tough characters. If you liked Harima, this girl has him matched! It doesn't have a dub, but is definately worth watching.<br>  <br>  7. Bokura Ga Ita - This is more on the drama side. I'd recommend not watching that if that's not what you're into. But it also has funny moments and is overall a comedy. If you're into drama too, go for it! Bokura Ga Ita does not have a dub. (Did I mention it was romance?)<br>  <br>  8. The Wallflower - LOL!!!!!! This anime is random, creepy, hillarious, unique, and unlike any other. Read about the storyline first, it's interesting! As for matching Harima, the main character of this anime has him beat!!! (Although some people might disagree...) Oh if you were wondering, this is DEFINATELY a romantic comedy. Good luck! It has a dub but I'm against it. I'm usually pretty easy on dubs but I think they killed this one... You can see the dub on youtube.<br>  <br>  9. Peach Girl - Very suspensful and It does have drama. Its a mixture of a romantic comedy and drama. You can see the dub on youtube, though I'm not sure if they have all the videos up yet... I got so frusterated with the misunderstandings between all the characters of School Rumble. I was EXTREMELY frusterated with the misunderstandings in this anime! Give it a shot if you feel like it.<br>  <br>  10. Kamikaze Kaito Jeanne - This is kind of an older anime. It can be misleading, and you might be asking at the beginning, WHY the heck was this one recommended?? But really, watch it through and it is amazing (in my opinion). When I started loving the characters I couldn't stop watching it. This one doesn't have a dub either but can be watched on tons of sites such as veoh.com <br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZpURbBDIrrc" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZpURbBDIr...</a><br>  <br>  I've got tons more but I'll stop here! Let me know if you want to know more. You can look up the rating and desciptions of these anime on animenewsnetwork.com.|`|k6fFOQ2vaa	kodocha<br>  ouran high school host club -both are romance comedy<br>  <br>  fruits basket<br>  Special A -romance|`|0aYGc43Vaa	ok dont kill me for saying this but chibi vampire is really good i started to read last year  im just waiting for the next vol to come out in ireland hope this helps :D:D|`|lOR8QDBpaa	Love Hina|`|LnYr2dLfaa	Negima.

0vm66wlcaa	Dio is an overall better frontman and vocalist.<br>  I do prefer Black Sabbath's era with Ozzy, but I prefer Dio over Ozzy Osbourne.<br>  Both awesome metal vocalists|`|AA10716061	I thought Ozzy was better for Black Sabbath but Dio is a much better singer.|`|sLVGdCOTaa	Paranoid, Ironman, War pigs, c'mon-Dio can't touch those classics, Ozzy was the metal sound of the early 70's. That being said RJD is also an innovator of early heavy metal but his career will never be remembered like the Ozzman.|`|a79b8a93426576f5d2c9cb6a23ba338faa	Dio might have been the better singer, but Ozzy was a God.  There is a reason why Ozzy was worshiped like he was.  He was an amazing frontman, and he had a charisma that a lot of people could relate to.|`|16t0eV0Uaa	Dio man, Ozzy is a sell out, and he is nowhere near the vocalist Dio is, if Dio fronted Black sabbath, they would of been a better band.|`|rXlyHk1Raa	I like Ozzy better, but Dio is a way better singer|`|AA10848630	Dio totally kicks ***.

12QJ9QMRaa	Iron Maiden<br>  <br>  *Gee Nightlife.. you stealing my thunder there????  =P<br>  <br>  Anyways... Nightlife listed 3 of the reasons I prefer Maiden (though I do like Priest too)<br>  <br>  1) I agree with my esteemed colleague, Mr Commando that Bruce is a better frontman than Halford.  Rob technically has a better voice ( supposedly a full 4 octave range, which just ain't right)<br>  But, Bruce is more energetic on stage, and utulizes what he has far more frequently than Halford.  Rob CAN sing explosively, but honestly, usually doesn't.   Bruce is ALWAYS at 11 on the amp.<br>  <br>  2) Totally agree with the guitars.  Few duos come close to the entertwining harmonies that Adrain and Dave pull off CONSTANTLY.<br>  <br>  3) Nicko is a better Drummer<br>  <br>  4) Steve Harris is one of the most amazing Bass Players in music today, not just Metal.  And his songwriting is always very intelligent.  Also, they are far more diverse in their writing.<br>  <br>  5)  Maiden has been far more consistent.  Except for the 2 albums with Blaze, there isn't a bad one in the bunch, and even those albums have their champions.<br>  <br>  6) Pretty much no band puts on a bigger spectacle in concert.  There is a reason they sell out 50,000 + seat stadiums worldwide STILL, 34 years after getting started.<br>  <br>  ***Nightlife... BTW bro...  shouldn't that be "Anti-Suffix"?  I'm not saying, yo.... I'm just sayin.   =P|`|gbm71puSaa	Its hard to pick because I love them both. But for over number of songs I like from one of them it has to be Priest. I think they are both different enough from each other in musical style that I don't really have to compare them.<br>   Bruce Dickenson sounds alot better then Rob Halford does nowadays though.|`|rXlyHk1Raa	I like Judas Priest better|`|a79b8a93426576f5d2c9cb6a23ba338faa	Tough Call.  Very tough call.  Priest.<br>  <br>  Why?  Two words, Rob Halford.|`|AA10848630	I would have to say Iron Maiden rules in riffs and raw power, but Priest is pretty good, too.  Actually, Judas Priest is probably, in my opinion, one of the most underrated bands of all time (you never see people wearing Judas Priest t-shirts or singing their songs for that matter).  But Bruce Dickinson could totally kick Rob Halford's gay *** any day. ;)<br>  And I'm sure Rob would enjoy it.|`|AgQForcYaa	METAL!<br>  <br>  I have a tiny bit of bias in my answer, as Judas Priest is the FIRST heavy metal band I got into. But I will admit that Iron Maiden is pretty bitchin', too.|`|qAfnWKQCaa	Iron bloody Maiden!|`|pAg6yHmPaa	Maiden ftmfw|`|vgcY5jHuaa	They're both really awsome bands, but I prefer Iron Maiden.|`|fQuPOe3Haa	Judas priest|`|7PO2ugfGaa	I like both for different reasons.|`|cTYhnumDaa	Love both, prefer Judas Priest|`|MJwA647Waa	Iron Maiden<br>  <br>  I find Judas Priest's voice really annoying =]<br>  Iron maiden has great gutiar, and is just better.|`|oqtb0Xm1aa	Maiden|`|RDppZhVYaa	iron maiden!!!!!!!!!|`|QBB7fbYuaa	they both pretty bitchin but i'm gonna hafta say iron maiden been hooked on it since i was 5 :D|`|0vm66wlcaa	Iron Maiden<br>  <br>  But here's what I say:<br>  - Bruce Dickinson is way more energetic than Rob Halford, but both are great metal vocalists.<br>  - Iron Maiden's guitarists are better, I think, and they harmonize a lot more than Judas Priest.<br>  - Iron Maiden has better lyrics. That doesn't matter to me all that much, but I feel it's worth mentioning.<br>  <br>  I'm sure Killer Peaches will come here and write an essay on how much better Iron Maiden is.<br>  <br>  edit: haha yeah Killer Peaches<br>  <br>  edit 2: prefixes suck. That's why I'm anti-prefixes<br>  <br>  edit 2.5: "esteemed" - why thank you|`|AA10716061	Iron Maiden<br>  <br>  I never really thought Rob Halford has that great of a voice.

Dasslerfaithful has indeed laid out a well thought out and plausible explanation as to who would win in a bout between one Kool-Aid Man and one Quaker Oats Guy (for reasons of expediency, I, too, will assume that Layla did not mean "Quacker" Oats guy, unless there is some new water fowl-like being who has some association to oats).  But let me add my two-cents, as it were:<br>  <br>  One of the Quakers (also known as the Religious Society of Friends) central beliefs is "The Peace Testimony" and it is probably the best known testimony of Friends. Basically, Quakers believe that violence is wrong.  This belief has persisted to this day, and many anti-war activists, conscientious objectors, and advocates of non-violence are Quakers. The Quakers are so peaceful, that in 1947 Quakerism was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize, which was accepted by the American Friends Service Committee and British Peace & Social Witness on behalf of all Friends. <br>  <br>  So, I would would have to think that if it did come to fisticuffs between the Kool Aid Man and The Quaker Oats Guy, the later would probably choose not to fight.<br>  <br>  Therefore, I believe the Kool Aid Man would mop the floor with the Quaker Oats Guy's behind.|`|k4aXr7Nyaa	Wait, wait, wait, wait.... I think we need some clarification here before we move on. I can only assume that when you say the Quacker Oats man, you are referring to the old Quacker on the label.<br>  But maybe you're talking about Wilford Brimley, esteemed spokesperson for Quacker Oats in the 1980s and 1990s. If that is indeed who you are talking about, then Wilford Brimley would destroy the Kool-Aid Guy. Have you seen him in The Firm? He's menacing.<br>  <br>  Now, you also don't specify what kind of a contest this would be. I think everyone is assuming you are asking who would win in a fight. But maybe you're talking about a game of darts. Or checkers. Or Connect Four. <br>  <br>  We really need to know more about your intentions before a proper answer can be given.|`|uFXxdD0uaa	Kool-Aid man, he would crash through the wall and send the rubble every where, and kids can drink him and he lives! He is truly invincible. And when he was going through the wall he would say, "OH YEAH" but if he was against Chuck Norris, he would have no chance.|`|219302b9dac1cd0dc210f34deb53f627aa	The Quaker Oats Quaker (without a doubt).<br>  <br>  Whole lotta quakin' goin' on !!!|`|7I6sMylNaa	Kool-Aid Man! The Quaker guy is too old and stiff...|`|AlocuXIFaa	I think the Quacker Oats guy would surprise you!|`|IXfwUxCkaa	koolaid|`|j6poSs16aa	Kool-Aid Man all the way!!!|`|49GfjLhqaa	kool aid :]|`|k9RNH7Weaa	First, technicalities. I'm pretty sure it's Quaker Oats, you know like the religious group.<br>  <br>  Now to the answer. I say it's up in the air, and here's why:<br>  <br>  Clearly the Kool-Aid man will be able to put more power behind a punch. But, at the same time, he has short arms, probably not even long enough to reach out past his big glass pitcher of a body.<br>  <br>  While we're on the body, he is made of glass. Very fragile. I assume it's not tempered or laminated, it's definitely not double paned. Just regular old glass. Maybe it's blown glass, even. Blown glass may have imperfections in it, that would make it even weaker.<br>  <br>  Man, the Kool-Aid man really looks like a terrible choice in this fight.<br>  <br>  Kool-Aid, KA as I like to call him, because of his size has got to be pretty slow. Slow and strong, that's how it works. He's also filled with a liquid, that makes him terrible unstable. Go fill up a 55 gallon drum 3/4 full of water and try to keep it steady. Let's face it, it's not happening. He doesn't even have an inner ear to help him stay balanced.<br>  <br>  KA also wears tights. I'm not judging, but most men that wear tights aren't really the fighting type. Sure you have your superhero contingency that wear tights, but clearly he's no superhero due to the reasons already stated above. KA just doesn't have it in him to fight.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  On the other hand we have Quaker Oats guy, I'll call him Phil, he just looks like a Phil to me.<br>  <br>  Phil has a normal sized body, although old, he still seems to be in fairly good shape. His arms I assume reach beyond the front of his body which gives him an immediate reach advantage over KA. Phil also appears to be a big man, probably 6'6" maybe better with the hat. Much of his power is derived from the hat, that would be KA's only chance for a real victory. His hat is like Samson's hair, without it his power is useless.<br>  <br>  Back to his advantages over, KA. Phil, although old, has presumably been eating his delicious oatmeal cereal religiously for many many years. This not only means that he probably defecates at the same time every day, but it also puts him at a lower risk for cancer, and helps promote a healthy heart, regular blood pressure, and helps keep his weight in check. The man is a machine. He's probably healthy as an ox. Unlike KA who is nearly completely sugar, Phil is a great example for children everywhere. He shouts, "Eat my cereal, and live to be old like me."<br>  <br>  Phil also probably had to fight a lot in his younger days. I bet he was picked on a lot for the silly hat, the hat that contains all of his strength. Undoubtedly he had to stand up to those hat bullies on more than one occasion. Let's face it, Phil is a scrapper.<br>  <br>  <br>  When you analyze these pro's and con's it's clear that KA has no chance against Phil. I say that it goes 3 rounds, just long enough for KA to get tired. Then, Phil will make his move and spill the blood red sugary contents of KA all over the ground.<br>  <br>  "The winner, from the red corner wearing the black clogs and silly hat, by TKO, Quaker "Phil" Oats!!!"

Woah.<br>  Sorry... haha... I would recommend Limewire.  Contrary to popular belief, it is completely safe if you use it wisely.  Make sure you keep your firewall up while using it (it will make it go slower, but barely).  Also, make sure you choose "Audio" when looking for mp3s, and don't EVER download any .exe files.  Also, if you roll over the file, make sure the track length and stuff come up, to further prove its legitimacy.  Oh, and the file sizes typically range between 2,000-7,000 MB.  Anything substantially higher and lower than that is likely a fake.<br>  Finally, if you search Title: man in the box  Artist: alice in chains, make sure you don't download files like:<br>  man box alice chains<br>  or<br>  man box alice chains sexxy<br>  or<br>  man box alice chains high quality<br>  ...<br>  You get the point.  Find a file like<br>  Man in the Box- Alice in Chains.  Usually proper capitalization and spelling is another indication of legitimacy, though sometimes good files have grammatical errors.  Go with your gut.<br>  And, yes, P2P is illegal, but the chances of you getting caught is slim to none.|`|HA3CUl0Jaa	Music is art. You are legitimately stealing from these artist by doing this. Don't buy the album from iTunes, don't download it from Limewire or wherever else you might go, just go to your local music store and buy the hard copy.

GS20sIkMaa	Lily (my one and only) by Smashing Pumpkins|`|Ix5I1C2Laa	Hmm this song is from like 10 years ago so hope you dont mind...I suggest "What Can I Do" by the Corrs....i think the lyrics hit the spot

RBW9ZX1iaa	Well you have a pretty good horn and because it might be old does not mean it is obsolete 'trapt_is...' for example I have an old mark 6 and it is probably one of the best saxophones you can buy. A Metal duckoff does get a good tone. I have a metal berg larson and I love it. Bari and meyer are known for their quality and make good jazz mouthpieces. But what matters more than brand is what are the properties. If you want a bright tone then you want a mouthpiece with a small chamber and a high floor. That will give you an edgy bright sound. Most mouthpieces will have a description of these factors. I prefer to have a really short facing with a softer reed because of the improved responsiveness. But mouthpieces are very personal and no two are the same (companies like yamaha are making it more consistent and less personal but still the accuracy is not great enough that two of the same model will have the same sound) so go to a local music store and try out some mouthpieces. <br>  Btw good luck finding one you like (it might take you the rest of your life)|`|U9tFQCpqaa	i play with  a buesher sax and i use a yamaha 4c mouthpiece.it has fallen out of my hand a few times and hasn't broken yet.i like it a lot and it is cheap to.|`|jwrcHFglaa	A metal duckoff mouthpiece will brighten up that horn.  I would try to find a music store that will let you try some different facings and then grab that jewel that makes your horn sing.|`|f3fcad727455bb0e2f6dc5686f5dc763aa	To get a bright sound on alto try beechler, claude lakey or a metal dukoff|`|xi9amEG2aa	Well, I'm not sure about saxes...but I do know that I had a flute from 5th grade (I'm now 2 1/2 years out of high school) and last year, I had bought a professional flute off of e-bay, really cheap for what it is.  (gold plated keys and mouth piece, open holed keys and the B flat foot joint)  It was a much better quality than the one I got in elementary school...and even my mom noticed that my new flute had a much better tone/sound and she doesn't know anything about instruments.  <br>  <br>  If your sax is older, try looking for a better one on e-bay.  You can find them pretty cheap and brand new.  I'm not saying you have to go out and buy one, but it's just a thought.  The flute I got could have easily been over $1000, but I got it for just over $200, maybe like 210?  I don't remember.  I have never heard of the name (Symphony) but it's still a good flute.  <br>  <br>  Not sure if I helped, but just thought I'd throw that suggestion out there.<br>  <br>  Good luck!!

jQotNGFQaa	I've been defending Chris from day 1, I kept saying that Rihanna got what she deserved, and even lmao about him biting her... but I just don't know if I could anymore. I feel so bad for her. That photo is just heartbreaking..it made a teardrop fall from my eye. I don't see how chris could have the heart to beat a girl so badly. She doesn't even look like herself, I really hope that picture is just a fake.|`|c573f7ac6e5d1bec7e5fc59b2cf6d1adaa	I'm so upset with Chris Brown after seeing the pictures. It's so disappointing especially since he know his mom went through the same thing. I hope he gets some serious help.  Rihanna doesn't need to go back to Chris Brown. She may love him but that doesn't mean that she needs to be in that kind of relationship. She shouldn't have to worry about whether she's going to get her *** beat if she upset him.|`|2hcA3VP9aa	she gave him an STD, now im not saying that she deserved it but there is something more to this story that will be revealed with in the next few weeks coming|`|AA10369550	OMG. Worse than I thought.|`|4HIKZsH2aa	my god thats real!? thats horrible! chris brown should be locked up for good!!|`|a8qFkmSzaa	Dang That's Terrible. Gosh Theres No Excuse For that. Im Not Supporting Him Anymore. (unless theres a darn good reason for hurting her) he needs to get set straight!! you never ever beat a woman!!|`|blwDnJy4aa	Oh my gosh, that poor child! She needs a home cooked Carib meal (my mom makes the best) and some warm blankets. No one deserves that kind of treatment. Look at her! My gosh, Chris! Look what you did!<br>  <br>  I literally gasped at the picture.|`|WyxxDgSeaa	I'm sorry to see the damage done to Rihanna and sorry too, that some other women will stay with men who beat them. This is not the face of "love" but of abuse. Reports say that this is not the first time he's hit her...it looks like it's the worst though. I hope she walks away from him. Next time he may kill her.|`|r5h7TmWJaa	Some of those pictures are fakes. Take this, for example<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sj-AbYvJge8" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sj-AbYvJg...</a><br>  <br>  But yes, I do feel bad for her.|`|YOGPspsgaa	This is the first time I'm seeing this... and I gotta say I feel really bad. I really like Rihanna and seeing her like this is beyond awful..<br>  <br>  Chris Brown should be locked up. I never expected it to be this bad.|`|oOzNMiKtaa	Ok I admit the picture is messed up, BUT, you need to think about Rihanna's feelings too. I know she wouldn't want people to see her like this. I mean it's embarrassing enough that it was on the news, but come on, a gossip site? That is getting ridiculous. If you don't like Chris Brown because of what "he did" to her, then that's YOUR opinion, so don't try and force it on others. How do you even KNOW he did it? Were you there? I'm pretty sure she somehow provoked him and it turned out worse then what they both thought would. I'm not saying this to take up for him because "I'm a fan", but my God, people make mistakes. It's not right for a man to hit a woman, but a woman shouldn't hit a man either. And from what I've read, she hit on him before and he did nothing.
VLsSuWD4aa	True. This match looks pretty damn perfect.|`|84726b724d7d1fd7da09652c50425c38aa	Sounds like a good match. <br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|YzCTq13caa	Hell yeah. Looks d@mn near perfect. Although their moons signs are opposing.
VLsSuWD4aa	Scorpio...three words...Passion, Desire and Death|`|TbSam3FCaa	I'd say leo.<br>  I'm a leo and I don't fall in love easily, <br>  but when i care about someone i see no one else.<br>  i couldn't imagine going forward without them, but <br>  when i'm FINALLY over it, I'm done. <br>  leo's love hard. i even saw in a zodiac profile one time<br>  "we love hard, but it hurts."<br>  so true. we try really hard to be our best, and expect <br>  people to give us the same in return. we have an idealistic,<br>  unrealistic idea of love. but we love deeply when we love you|`|vV1hPhfWaa	It's all relative, don't generalize|`|AA11417199	Scorpio and Sagittarius -very passionate although differences in our approaches.|`|vLAGnmGEaa	Libra|`|w2cBiawraa	yeah definitly scorpio|`|Fb2xM1kJaa	Pisces.

I know because I am one and that is all there is to it.|`|LyDd0m7Waa	I agree with iloveit<br>  My best friend is a Leo, and when she falls for someone, she truly puts her whole heart into the relationship. When the person is right, Leos are loyal, sincere and dedicated. My second choice are Scorpios, one of my ex was a Scorpio and I can say that he was fully dedicated to our love. He was passionate with true emotions. <br>  <br>  ?|`|AA12215623	Cancer,I have fallen so so hard for this Scorpio man.. I was/am in love with him. For  so long I couldn't get him out of my mind, I still think of him everyday. I gave him my whole heart, I put myself way out there and have never ever ever done for any other man. I don't know if I will again at least anytime soon. I would've stepped over broken glass to get him whatever he needed (speaking figuratively) I payed attention when he spoke and could remember damn near everything he ever said/did to me. I still love him but do think us being apart is best for us. But I tell you a Cancer doesn't let go and when we do it takes so long. We are fiercely loyal, loving people. We hold our loved ones in the highest regard. We are the sweetest kind, and will entertain and make him/her happy. Don't get me wrong though, we you start taking us for granted and we will see it and cut you off. We put up with **** for awhile but it won't go on too long.We love like no other, so that's why I say it'll be awhile before I meet someone I care for in the same sense as I did him. Virgo, My Virgo friend was very good for her  ex boyfriend, he was homeless she found him a place to stay. She helped him get on his feet, she put him before herself and well he took it all for granted. Aquarius (notice  they are the independent type, but when they fall they fall hard.) My best friend is an Aquarius and was in love with A Libra boy, she did everything a woman should for her man. She was faithful, funny, sweet. She's independent, very kind, loyal and took care of his needs and had his back when things were rough for him. One thing I can say is all these guys have already realized or will at some point the good thing they had and want it.. some already have.|`|jTkzSyzbaa	Scorpio.|`|edJtHlDiaa	scorpio

XMnmda0Jaa	I would really like for your theory to be true because Jillian seemed to be a nice girl.  I was actually hoping that the final two was going to be Melissa and Jillian.  However several leading sources have claimed that Jillian does not come back and that he proposes to Melissa, just like most people have predicted.  However he later dumps Melissa in an after the final rose episode.<br>  <br>  SPOILERS: <br>  <br>  --------------------------------------...<br>  <br>  Melissa has gotten a pretty good edit and the producers probably wanted people to believe that Melissa is going to be the one. This is probably also why they gave a hint by showing a quick preview of a brunette woman being proposed to that many viewers assume to be Melissa.<br>  <br>  Although I dislike Molly and I don't want her to win, several leading sources have leaked important information regarding the final rose ceremony and the after episode. So here's the scope: Jason does indeed propose to Melissa. However after proposing and getting engaged, he later changes his mind and breaks up with Melissa at the after the final rose episode. This is part of the "potentially dramatic and emotionally difficult" scene that Chris Hanson was talking about. This also probably explains why Hanson said they had to keep the taping of the show as intimate as possible since Melissa was going to get dumped on national television and Jason was going to get the ring back from her. The situation regarding Melissa's mysterious private family may be also a reason that Jason will cite as a reason for calling off the engagement with Melissa.<br>  <br>  According to these sources, Jason gets back with Molly. One source even claim that Jason and the producers knew that Molly was the final one all along but they had him propose to the other woman and then dump her for the sake of drama. I don't know if that is true - whether he did honestly thought Melissa was the one but later changes his mind or whether he knew it was Molly but went along with the producers' scheme. <br>  <br>  Like most people, I strongly dislike Molly, but she does have several advantages over Melissa: For example, Jason got to meet Molly's family but he did not get the opportunity to meet Melissa's family. Jason mentioned in the 7th episode that he thinks he can fall in love with Melissa without meeting her family but that "it can only go so far." That is probably a clue. So Melissa's family or something about Melissa's past may a reason Jason states as why he dumps Melissa. Second, Molly and Jason both share an interest in golf. So they have at least something in common. Third, Jason did invite Molly to spend the night with him in his tent which suggests that he did have some feelings for Molly early on in the show. Fourth, Jason said during the radio interview that Molly was the best kisser. And lastly, Molly said in an interview during their walk in Seatle that she did not know why Jason was "wasting his time with the other girls" when he knows that it is her. She also says how she liked kissing Jason and claims that she will be "kissing him" for the rest of her life. <br>  <br>  So if these sources are true, it will be indeed dramatic when he cancels his engagement to Melissa and goes back to the other woman. It's quite possible that the producers knew that Jason was going to call off his engagement and choose someone else so they made Melissa have a good edit and led the audience into liking Melissa, leading them to think that she was the final one. This might help her to be the next bachelorette since she has generated a good fan base and some sympathy. <br>  <br>  Even though Melissa is a likeable character and seems like there's some chemistry between Jason and Melissa, it is still likely that she gets dump. A lot of people were claiming and expecting that Jason was going to be final guy on the bachelorette season, but Papas did the unexpected and accepted the proposal from Jesse instead. Although this was not what the audience wanted or expected, Jason did get a good edit and generated a strong fan base, which helped make him the next bachelor. <br>  <br>  As I said before, I never did like Molly, so I found it hard to believe he would go back to pick Molly over the sweet Melissa. But this is probably why the final episode is going to be so "potentially dramatic and emotionally difficult" as Chris Hanson mentions. This also help explain the clip of Jason crying. <br>  <br>  Although I would rather your theory be true because Jillian seems to be way better than the ***** Molly, these are the information that supposedly got leaked out.|`|LhRgL489aa	yes, I like your theory quite a bit. the show is stupid, but what you suggest would liven it up|`|UriE3wN6aa	i think he will pick mellisa but hopefully im wrong and he picks molly lol|`|wFy80O73aa	pretty interesting :) never thought about that twist ...But I believe I hear deanna saying that SHE made a mistake, and now he has a chance with her once again. I don't think he will call Jilian back, I never felt they had chemistry . I think he will pick Melissa, but from the little preview of the reunion I think there has to be some kind of twist, remember what Cris said, and he looked kind of serious, too. I know they make the little things sound like that in the previews, but who knows, I think something unexpected will happen...<br>  <br>  <br>  wow....wasn't expecting the other theory from Truth_seeker.<br>  sounds interesting, but I don't want to believe Jason would agree to a game like that, knowing he's gonna pick Molly but pick melissa instead, then do what you mentioned to her, just for the ratings and drama :(( that would be sad...and yes I liked melissa since day 1... so I hope it 's not true

JvynDBPNaa	I think they will make another reality show <br>  "Making the Band: Finding New Danity Kane Members"<br>  <br>  Even if they dont get more members and just continue as a trio, they will still not make it(in my opnion)|`|QfQJtuuYaa	I don't think they will :[<br>  But i hope they do!|`|aZszxvEWaa	I don't honestly think they will get back together although I would like to see them back together. I think that neither of the group members are really worried about getting back in the band because they have already been on MTV and other shows for years now, so they pretty much already have their fame. I don't think that anyone of them would have a problem getting their own record deal. As much as I liked Aubrey when I first starting watching the show, I do think that she has a lot to do with it. I also think that Puffy should realize that when you put 5 females together, regardless if it's making a band or if they have all been best friends for years, they are going to make their own clicks. They are not all going to get along all the time and sooner or later people are going to start paring of into their own little groups. I don't think it should really matter as long as they gave the fans what they wanted and they performed good together like Danity Kane did!

YIcBd569aa	what I luv lost said is correct. but he quoted the wrong episode that proves it. no christian sheppard who is jacks father is NOT jacob. the episode you want to rewatch is the one where locke, hurley and ben go to jacobs cabin but only locke goes inside. once inside he sees claire and christian sheppard (jack and claires dad). locke asks christian if he is jacob and christian sheppard clearly say NO. I am not jacob I am here on behalf of jacob. and in the tunnel locke see christian sheppard again. and christian says hello john remember me. you first met me in the cabin. he also tells him to say hello to my son (meaning jack). so the answer is NO. christian sheppard (jacks dad) is NOT jacob.|`|HEs6bzOtaa	No he is not, if you have seen every episode in season 3 you might remember<br>  <br>  Hope this helps<br>  <br>  Anyway anyone here a kyle xy fan because if you are<br>  Please go to www.savekylexy.com and press save kyle xy<br>  If you can sign a petition it might not get cancelled <br>  Please help|`|31CDyuggaa	no christian shephard (jack's dad) is not jacob.  it hasn't been explained exactly how he can be on the island but jacob only speaks through people.  do you remember the episode where locke first meets jacob in season 3?  ben takes locke to the cabin and he is having a conversation with jacob that locke cannot hear until jacob says, "help me," and locke freaks out and runs out.  if you recall, there is an empty rocking chair that ben seems to be talking to and that's jacob so he can't be jack's dad.  i hope this answers your question!

Candace performed really well at the challenge, scoring a pt. for Timbira, got physical and showed her stuff.<br>  <br>  Then she made ONE comment about Benjamin needing to go, and when it got back to him, of course he changed his plan. Sheesh. All because of his ego! IMO, they lost a good player, but since when does that ever stop these guys/girls at TC? They never learn..;-)<br>  <br>  I think she had a bit of a feeling, but no for the most part, they duped her as everyone else stuck with Benjamin's vote.<br>  <br>  You can re-watch her final words, recap and/or full episode here if you'd like:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.upn.com/video/?showname=prime..." rel="nofollow">http://www.upn.com/video/?showname=prime...</a>|`|nlpZr9akaa	Candice was voted off.

She becomes completely enamored with his grace and skill. When troubles with her classmates arise, Mizuki decides to chase Sano and enrolls in Osaka High, the all boys' school that Izumi attends in Japan.

As she settles in, an accident reveals her identity to Hokuto Umeda, the school doctor, and Izumi Sano.

L4pDQM4Laa	well i dont know about printing but onemanga is a very reliable free online manga website so if you want to read it/print it the site has all the bitter virgin chapters up to date.<br>  heres the link:<br>  <a href="http://www.onemanga.com/Bitter_Virgin/" rel="nofollow">http://www.onemanga.com/Bitter_Virgin/</a>|`|QK4r41Hqaa	onemanga, and mangafox.com both have all of it.<br>  <br>  You're lucky that you waited to read it till it was over, waiting for the new chapters was HORRIBLE! O_O<br>  it took months for them to come out scannalated, and each ended with a clif hanger, near the end!<br>  <br>  I sugest onemanga more then mangafox, because mangafox tends to scew up my computer- they have a lot of adds and other flash stuff on their site. So it runs slowly.<br>  <br>  oh, to print it... eh, you would be better off buying them (have they been released????)<br>  printing all those pages would cost SO much money,  think of all the ink you would have to use!!!! D:<br>  <br>  But, just save the pictures off onemanga/mangafox into a folder, then start printing....<br>  <br>  To download them, <a href="http://www.mangaworld.org/" rel="nofollow">http://www.mangaworld.org/</a><br>  That's the site that scanned and translated them: you can download the entire chaper.<br>  That would be faster then just saving the images.<br>  <br>  and it would be difficutl to read if you tried to print more then 1 page at a time on 1 printed page.<br>  The image would be very, very small. But if you down-sized both of them... then yea, you could.<br>  Not sure you could read the words though...|`|k32sOHLgaa	It costs more to print a manga from the internet than to actually buy the real thing. So my advice to you is: if you really like manga support the community by buying it.

I think that hes a great rapper and a has a good flow. Hes a pretty real rapper if you've honestly listened to all his stuff mixtapes and etc. The Game is the only rapper thats still representing the West Coast like others did, but still I like The Game as a rapper in whole. He has a great flow, and has real lyrics.|`|f6522a133ad73f5b55bf2bbba116748daa	MOST DEFINITELY!!!!  He is one of the sickest lyricist out. PERIOD!! Even after 50 Cent tried to take him down, he still came back without all the Dre beats and high priced featured artist.  That song on his latest CD with Nas is outta control.  I will always support THE GAME.|`|OpBFc27iaa	hah, game is dope.<br>  <br>  <br>  i think its that whole West thing that draws him to me, but hes a decent rapper, for being mainstream.|`|QYHIVl1Naa	crip n*gga blood n*gga ese asians dominicans puerto ricans white boys jamaicans lating king disciples vice lord patient|`|AA10784709	I think after the game left g-unit he became a lot better he went back to what hip hop was good for.

xD8T4dY3aa	"Have you ever danced with the devil in the pale moon light?" - just sounds so gothic, prophetic and dark.<br>  'Why so serious" - is just a throw away line. Lacks the punch of "Have you ever danced with the devil in the pale moon light?" as a sinister and foreboding prelude to death.|`|okFXfimeaa	definitely why so serious coz it really shows the craziiness of the joker and its so easy to quote where as i dont think there will ever be a time when saying to someone 'have you ever danced with the devil by the blue moon night?' isnt just plain creepy!!|`|RDppZhVYaa	have you ever danced with devil by the pale moon light. cuz when ur hella drunk it just the most apropriate saying wooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo...

Xx6hLJbKaa	I love Ugly Betty. It's my favorite show ever!!!<br>  <br>  1.) I really do like Wilhelmina and Connor together, but I guess most of that comes from the fact that this is out of element for Willy, making the story interesting. She really never has had a steady guy for more than a few episodes.<br>  <br>  2.) I LOVE Molly and want her and Daniel to stay together bad, but I hear rumors that the writers plan to kill her off, which tonights episode hinted at : (   So I don't think they will last into next season.<br>  <br>  3.) I like them together as well. It gives Ignacio more of a storyline, and there's a nice mother figure in the Suarez house now.<br>  <br>  4.) I'm curious about what it will be. I think she should name him Bradford.<br>  <br>  5.) I don't think so. The writers rarely bring people back on this show. I wish they would bring Sophia back for a little while. It would make for an interesting story.<br>  <br>  6.) I think she will in the final seasons of the show, which hopefully isn't anytime soon!!<br>  <br>  7.) I agree with you. Betty and Daniel just don't belong together. Friends that's it!!! I've always been a Betty/Henry supporter.<br>  <br>  CANT WAIT FOR NEXT WEEK'S EPISODE!!!|`|VpncKq4naa	1-I do like W&C together. They're a cool power couple.<br>  2-I think Molly and Daniel are sweet together. Him being with Molly shows that he's grown since the first season.<br>  3-Ignasio and his nurse dating is too predictable for me. I knew it was going to happen so I don't really have any interest.<br>  4-I am excited to see what Wilhelmina will name the baby boy. It will probably be something a little odd but still cute. I would like to see some kind of a maternal instinct come out of her.<br>  5-I doubt D.J. will come back. That story line is pretty much closed.<br>  6-I think eventually Hilda will fall in love but there's too much going on with her right now to focus on finding someone.<br>  7-I would hate it if Betty and Daniel feel in love. That would be too weird!!!!!!

sdP1qmCKaa	there are several scales you can use - it depends a bit on context - but these will work :<br>  <br>  over 7b9 chords, a half step-whole step diminished scale fits, so for example :<br>  E7b9 : E F G G# A# B C# D<br>  <br>  over 7+9 chords, the same scale fits, but you can also use the diminished/whole tone scale (7th mode of the melodic minor) - for example :<br>  A7 +9 : A Bb C Db Eb F G<br>  note that this is a Bb melodic minor scale, starting on the A<br>  <br>  half diminished chords, yes, the locrian mode fits, but that b9 in the locrian may sound like a clash, so an alternative is a natural minor b5 scale (6th mode of melodic minor) - for example :<br>  D half dim : D E F G Ab Bb C<br>  note that this is F melodic minor, starting on the D<br>  <br>  as an aside, this means that a half diminished chord can use the same scale as a 7+9 chord a tone higher, so G half diminished = A7+9, D half diminished = E7+9, and so on<br>  <br>  hope that helps|`|c3BGCFdFaa	Consider the chords of a major key (let's take C for example): start on C (on keyboard) and make a chord by playing every second white note, using four fingers: C maj7. Then go to the next note in the scale and do the same: Dm7. Continue through the whole scale: Em7, Fmaj7, G7, Am7, Bm7b9, ending back on Cmaj7.  The only half-diminished chord (m7b5) is the B, which is a semitone below the key note (C). You would play a C major scale over the Bm7b5 because that chord fits naturally into the key of C major.  If you transpose to other keys, any time you come across a minor seven flat five (half-diminished) chord, simply use the major scale of the note that's a semitone (half-step) higher than the root note of the chord.|`|XYTUAzzgaa	i think your looking for a diminished scale (tone, semi-tone,tone,semi-tone,tone etc etc) i'm not sure if it's a mode your looking for as much as the scale itself...mode is a reference of where on a given scale you start isn't it?<br>  <br>  it's been many years since i went to music school...maybe just use the process of elimination...it's the first thing i do when making a solo on guitar...i eliminate everything that just will not work, everything else is fair game.

k32sOHLgaa	It is true that if you played Diamond and Pearl you can play the Japanese version of Platinum without any big problems. Not only that but you can find English guides to the Japanese game in www.gamefaqs.com <br>  The only problem in playing it in Japanese will be that if you don't know the Japanese alphabet (Hiragana and katakana) you won't be able to know which Pokemon the opponent chooses before he let it out. But that in itself could be a nice Challenge to make the game more interesting!|`|iE8P8kXmaa	Sure! If you've played both Diamond and Pearl back and front you shouldn't encounter any problems.<br>  <br>  If you ever need help, you can watch instructional videos made by Marriland (he's fantastic), and I'm sure there's a guide out there on the internet to help you if Marriland isn't sufficient to your needs :)|`|XQMm3Ahraa	not too difficult the only hard parts are that <br>  1: it's in japanese<br>  2: it has a different plot<br>  3: wouldn't you enjoy it more in english and if you preorder it you get a really cool giriatina action figure<br>  <br>  anyway the choice is yours so do what you wat

They also have a "touch" screen, so you can poke it with your finger and get it to do stuff.<br>  <br>  They first came out in about 2005, but the processors were slow and they weren't very popular.

You can tell by all their gestures and jokes they make about her, but they don't want to offend her seeing as she's real big in America. It's hilarious how Tom doesn't like her..haha..we know he would sleep with anything that has a pulse. <br>  <br>  Im glad they aren't going to make a duet..Miley would ruin the song..<br>  <br>  P.S. they even played Rockband together (and Miley forgot Bill's name and called him BEN!): <a href="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3173/2844231200_03f0acf85c_b.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3173/2844...</a><br>  <a href="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/3278/2840801384_a21b2ed585_o.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://farm3.static.flickr.com/3278/2840...</a>|`|kAIXDVu1aa	They Don't like MILEY AT ALL they HATE her Tom even said it but i don't emember where but they DON'T LIKE HER !!!|`|w1HbcbZuaa	wtf when did the magazine come out oh hell noooooo i want to boycott th but its to hard not to listen to them eww and miley shes like preppy and bill like diffrent gross next thing you know shes gonna be dating on of the memvers from th like that one 20 year old dude how can they even sing with her im not gonna hear them sing together|`|DMuD4pNCaa	im kinda annoyed that the only mags theyre appearing in are the girly ones with mily and the jonas brothers, but at least theyre getting publicity in american magazines.<br>  its a start, but hopefully soon they'll be appearing in mags like alternative press and rollling stone, maybe even =].|`|JReroESmaa	you need to chill girl ...|`|J5jI6VDvaa	wow you seem a little jealous that Miley even MET Tokio Hotel...|`|3AVHxNNTaa	agree. so does your essay. i didn't read it, but you seem to be venting over an entertainment news show. rofl!

QK4r41Hqaa	Um... well not everything has bad shots of girls. <br>  Card-captor sakura was child safe... but not for boys, I think XD<br>  <br>  I'm not sure of any other then that.<br>  <br>  I've let mine (he was 11 at that time, I think younger would have been fine even) xxxHolic and he loved it.... Nothing too bad wiht the girls.<br>  <br>  If he's fine with anime, and is younger, then Hayao Miyazaki's movies are allways a great idea.<br>  <br>  ( I'm not so sure those in the first post area good idea, if you're worried about bad pictures of girls...<br>  <br>  Speical A was finem, but it's a shoujo manga.<br>  Bleach... are you kidding? Orehime, Matsumato, Nell, ect. It was like boobie overload! Matsumato and Nell REALLY let it hang out.<br>  <br>  Naruto: uhhhh.... Sexy no jutsu.... O_O<br>  Tsunade.....<br>  <br>  Inuyasha would probably be okay, but I've not read the manga. and it's been a while since I saw the anime.<br>  <br>  Reading it before he does is a really good idea though.|`|25G5MzQeaa	xxxHolic is not suitable for child. They don't really have sexual appearance in that comic but it has some scary and magical stuff that might scared little kids.<br>  <br>  Cardcaptor Sakura is ok. I wonder if it suits boys......<br>  Doraemon is good. Very safe, and funny.....<br>  If your little brother prefer adventurous one, he can be reading tsubasa reservoir chronicle. Though, sometimes it got really confusing... But fairly safe from bad pictures of girl. However, some part involve wars. <br>  <br>  Well, that's all what i think. thanks a lot=)|`|k6fFOQ2vaa	on the back of most mangas they have rateings like A for all, T for teens for 13 and up, and T+ for older teens<br>  <br>  if there isn't any at least look through it. if it has bad picture of words it's best not to let him read it.

Some have bad pictures, but some are centered around children. Tokyopop gives all of their mangas ratings by age level. I'd start out with Kingdom Hearts mangas since they are action and Disney.|`|AA11195219	Always read the manga before he does. Maybe research what it has in it.

WJjfrf0Caa	He's talking to the fathers of the daughters during this line.<br>  <br>  He is simply stating the fact that girls learn how they are supposed to be treated from their fathers. if a father is good to his daughter, then she will expect to be treated well by other men when she is older. if a father is bad to his daughter, then she will expect to be treated like a punching bag and have no self respect.<br>  <br>  so figuratively, you could say that a father should be good to his daughter because the father is like a god to his daughter and is able to create a solid foundation (weight) that she can view the world from.|`|VSfiigz3aa	what it REALLY MEANS.. is that he is the father looking out for his daughter.  Fathers need to be good for their daughters.|`|cTo5zrF7aa	hmm....i think that he' s just trying to say that in every guy's life there's always gonna be that one special girl that influences him and impacts his life and his decisions in a big way.<br>  by saying "the weight of the world"<br>  i think that he is saying that this girl has become the main factor in his life influencing everything that he does.|`|pIDd2y8Xaa	it means that fathers are the prototypes for their daughters future lovers. subconsciously, they idealize the man in their life the way that they do for their father, so he's basically saying that she thinks the world of you so don't f*** it up lol|`|kfdkiLzAaa	i think it means that every man looking out for a girl is the most important person in that girls life.|`|bkx93l8Daa	i think it means that "you are the blessing and the curse" of her world|`|U7OkwYD9aa	I think it means that the man is the one that the woman always look up to for everything when they are in times of trouble and the man is what keeps her grounded.|`|5EHnbBX4aa	I Think it means that a girl really depends on a guy and that the girl is innocent and the guys are supposed to like support them and look after them.|`|9tyx5BkPaa	I loove that song!|`|b2j5AE1oaa	i'm not sure but what i think it means is watching out for one another..

He's responsible for locking the other characters out of their illegal homes, and is one of the reasons Roger and Mimi break up.<br>  <br>  A driving factor would be him marrying an uptown rich woman who's father wants to demolish the housing building and rezone the entire block to make high-rise condos.<br>  <br>  He redeems himself by helping Mimi out toward the end of the film and offering to pay for her rehab.|`|FyJZoTPvaa	Maybe Benny becasue hes making them move if they didnt stop Maureen|`|illxtuYSaa	I would have to say AIDS becasue that kinda kept Roger and MImi apart

6kBAj12gaa	that is a good question it very well could happen i just hope he doesnt turn into a Haywood Jr because on yesterdays (02/19/2009) episode Ryan did threaten Zack that he is going to take away everything that Zack loved since Zack supposedly took greenlee away even though it was really Kendall...that is what Hayward did to Tad twice now and now trying to get at JR by trying to get Little A.<br>  <br>  I just wonder if Ryan does go after Kendal (however I dont think kendal would soak up to him but again this is soap opera land) i think they will get close but she will reveal the truth about her driving the night Greenlee was run off the cliff and by that time Ryan will have already done everything he could to Zack....<br>  <br>  Now that I think about it Kendal is being a hypocrite and wanting everyone to be honest with her but she isnt being honest to everyone about who drove the car...|`|AA10343852	I don't think they will. I think they will become alot closer, but I think Kendall will stick it out with Zach, who is the love of her life, they make a perfect couple. Granted right now Zach is in the dog house, he and Kendall have been through way worst. Kendall had sex with Aidan for God's sake and they stuck it out. I don't think a kiss is going to come between them. I think the Kendall and Ryan thing went away years ago. I do believe they still love each other as friends, but that's about it.|`|fab4d863aae6c11ee1163077586edcdaaa	Mai Oui!  That seems to be what they're setting us up for ... the greatest Fairy Tale Romance reunion of all time!<br>  <br>  Question is ... how long will it take for Ryan and Kendall to get sick of stroking each others' egos?  I don't believe their individual heads can even fit through the door!|`|AA10819275	I hope so, I loved them as a couple before.<br>  I don't like Zach anymore, put him with Reese & send them both away.|`|oVRA1ze2aa	no they won't go there no more.I think he's gonna either reach out too Reese or Natalia|`|UY3zl9dFaa	I really hope not! They tried to re-create the Ryan/Greenlee magic and it failed. Ryan and Kendall- why bother? I like her and Zach together. Ryan needs to own up to his role in Greenlee's "death" (which, of course, he never will!)|`|AA12336927	EW, just EW  I can't stand Ryan and I LOVED how Zak told him whats up today. RYAN is the one that caused all this. I just want him to leave the show|`|AA12319351	I sure hope not, let them just be friends helping each other through the "death" of Greenlee. Kendall belongs with Zack and nobody else. Sure things are rough right now, but they have overcome tougher obstacles than a stupid kiss from some bimbo. Ryan needs to take emma and move to a far off planet and give all a break from his high and mighty, " I can do no wrong, everything is someone elses fault" attitude. If he hadn't jumped to conclusions that were wrong his precious Greens would still be alive, and we would have to endure another re-cast, and then another return of Budig.  At least the writers were smart enough to kill her off this time ( I hope).|`|DcVoq5Tuaa	Please NO! leave Kendall with Zach. They will work out their problems and be stonger than ever.|`|97158e12e6c17080ec04a0a2b2456b2aaa	been there, done that, but you know soaps they just love rekendalling old flames.|`|NGNeT3rYaa	I hope not, I hated them together the last time!

069d241743d397f7bc4dca280e447738aa	Pluto in the 7th house may indicate a person who tends to attract people who dominate or are dominated by them. The partners may be of a spiritual, holistic type or those interested in the occult. The partner may work in feilds involving detective work, politics or medicine. Often times the romantic or social relationships are very intense with an all-or-nothing approach. One or both partners may have deep transformative effects on each other and if well-aspected this may lead to deep level changes in both partners, for the better. <br>  <br>  Negatively aspected, this person may find themselves coming into contact with those who are domineering and possessive. They may be jealous types who try to reform the individual with this placement or the native has these traits himself. Relationships may be subject to power plays and clashes of wills or the patner may die early and suddenly.<br>  <br>  Pluto in the 11th house indicates a person who has a very strong desire to achieve their goals in life. They are very self-willed in this field. They often are humanitarian with a desire to reform  the world in some way. Others have a more spiritual leaning and prefer to associate themselves with such groups.  The friends are most likely to be involved in politics, detective work, the occult or medicine and generally have a profound effect upon the person with this placement. There is a capacity for strong leadership and these people have excellent insight into the motives of their friends.<br>  <br>  Negatively aspected, this person may experience financial loss through friends due to manipulation or extravagance, abruptly terminated friendships, loss in love, problems with taxes and joint finances.|`|Ow3O7h4caa	Pluto in the 7th brings intensity in a relationship. It's a position that can bring into one's life a partner who functions as a source of renewal and strength both for onesel and others. If poorly placed, Pluto is very detrimental to relationship longevity and can bring about great deceit.<br>  On another level, Pluto can often bring unusual problems that need to be dealt with. The partnership carries with it the seeds of its own destruction and if nurtured, those seeds will sprout and destroy the relatinship.<br>  <br>  In the 11th house, Pluto can indicate the disappearance of friends who, many years later, resurface in one's life. It also indicates the ability to be an intense transformative agent in group circumstances. This planet/house position can reveal a person who is able to bring new life and direction into the collective goals of anygroup or organization. Pluto often acts as a devil's advocate in social situations, stirring up what may be negative and hidden, thereby bringing to the surface new creative possibilities for all concerned.<br>  Here also, on another level, Pluto can indicate underworld friends or friendship with those in trouble. Children may travel back and forth between separated parents. (THE 11TH IS THE 5TH (children) FROM THE 7TH (marriage)
d2dkgYRaaa	Hm. Well, I think it's similar to walking down a road. <br>  <br>  You can see ahead of you of what's going on, and if you don't like it, you can always take another route. However, environmental factors are taken into consideration as well. Is it the most direct route? Is the weather keeping you on your route? <br>  <br>  I think astrology is similar to this. You can see what's going on in a chart, or see what COULD happen in a chart. if the person doesn't like what they see, they can always do something to change that, right?|`|oX7M4FoIaa	If you never knew about a birthchart, and you could still make your own decisions...then you'd still have free-will. Free-will is separate from your birthchart...we have the ability to choose.Our fates are not pre-determined.|`|jFq8YmORaa	Are you talking about yourself or someone else?|`|uel6NBOVaa	The way I see it is that life is about challenges. There's no such thing as limitations. You place those on yourself. Anti-hero made some very interesting points, and you can argue all of that...but when I talk about free will, I'm talking more about conscious choices. <br>  <br>  I think that people put way too much importance on each aspect of the birth chart. Okay, honestly, if I never knew anything about astrology, I would be at the same place I am today. Why? Because I can live my life and learn from my mistakes. Knowing that you have a square in your chart may make you more aware of your problem, but it doesn't make it reappear or disappear. However, if you take it for what it is, you can change it. <br>  <br>  The purpose of negative aspects in the birth chart is to overcome them. I truly believe that. It's to work with the strengths you are given, and overcome the weaknesses. Everyone sees things differently, and this is how I choose to see it. If having Sun square Moon, for example, inclines me to missing out on opportunities due to an inherent laziness and struggle to achieve my desires without the necessary actions behind them...Well, now I know the struggle. So what do I do to change it? I push myself. I may feel inclined to react a certain way, but if I know the problem, I can make the right choices. <br>  <br>  If Libra is inclined to be indecisive, you can tell yourself to stop thinking too much and just feel. If my Mars aspects make my temper vicious and give me an extreme need to control and dominate my environment, I can struggle within myself to suppress the negative side of this. <br>  <br>  So yes, free will is everything. We can change, we can make choices, we can do whatever we want. The birth chart gives us guidelines, but those guidelines are incomplete and often balanced out with other influences. In the end, I do believe that you are the deciding factor. Knowing astrology just makes it more clear on what you may need to work on.|`|CEEQDSCFaa	yes good question, but its an oxymoron dont you think?<br>  if free will is from our birthchart then it still follows rules, then its not free, coz its actions are still based on an influence<br>  <br>  ok lets say your chart gives you a strong free will, free will meaning also the power to supress free will, which would not be the case if you have a strong influence of it<br>  <br>  so can you change the influence of your birthchart? free will is kind of a rebel in a sense, and if it can rebel against itself it could be now a different entity than your birthchart with its own rights and decisions to make, your with me<br>  <br>  probably something more than what we can comprehend right now, what is free will anyway? free will is still restricted bound by laws acting according to the environment around it, is free will synonymous with flexibility? free will is not really free otherwise we can just jump off buildings for the hell of it.<br>  <br>  or is free will our ability to adapt to change and conquer adversities regarding our choices, so we take it anyway calculated the risks of success, so having a strong free will than others could just simply be being better than the other person, and our confidence follows<br>  <br>  i dont think i even came close to answering your question, but there are things like physical genes and spiritual genes <br>  if we learned anything from astrology, its that certain things affect specific things in our life and with all the parts we are whole, so theres still many things to learn we have no idea about.. things higher than astrology

A lot of them have some sort of 'God' delusion going on : "I know everything" / "I am the only person with good taste in music" / "My interlect is far superiour to all of yours" that sort of cr@p. <br>  <br>  There are also the 'fan club' type, who believe certain other people to be 'God', who virtually lie drooling at that person's feet and will do anything they ask, or anything to make themselves look good to that person. Of course, when the 'fan club' happen to be adults, they just make themselves look stupid...<br>  <br>  <br>  MQ : <br>  'Every Breath You Take' ~ The Police<br>  'Stan' ~ Eminem<br>  'Grimly Fiendish' ~ The Damned<br>  'Aqualung' ~ Jethro Tull|`|M7E1uIsKaa	Gross<br>  <br>  Somebodys watching me - Rockwell<br>  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aD21JDMp86c" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aD21JDMp8...</a>|`|J7oQV0zPaa	I want to have your babies!!!<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  ROFL<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  MA.  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ab_IE_eXyTQ" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ab_IE_eXy...</a>|`|RKMWeMk9aa	I bet they're 40 year old virgins, who love Star Trek, and Battlestar Galatica and still live with their mom.<br>  <br>  MQ: Stone Temple Pilots- Creep<br>  <br>  Lmao my bad The Xylons rule!|`|JqqRFFsyaa	They go great with mustard and fries.<br>  <br>  MA: Don't get on me about this, but Vermillion by Slipknot sounds REALLY stalkerish.|`|vK9Vv9gjaa	I think they are lonely virgins trying to get laid, who got bored with there cat cause it wont do the things they want it to do.<br>  <br>  MQ: aqualung|`|YwtXSUAdaa	It's pretty weird but from a spectators view it's quite entertaining.|`|RtG5Iarbaa	Oh they're sexy. ;]<br>  <br>  <br>  MQ: Creep.

Some become desensitized and then cold blooded themselves.<br>  <br>  My point is we all have issues with something or another. I think here and there one time or another we all experience our "Bipolar" moments or moments of depression. <br>  <br>  But there are a lot of mentally ill individuals out there and its gotten worse with time. You have to constantly be aware of whats going on around you. You have to watch for the signs of disturbing and abnormal behavior. The Internet sickos aren't just here on the net they are shopping at your local Walmart, at your local grocery store, at your malls and some even work at your local post office.<br>  <br>  You just always have to be on guard. There are thousands of mentally ill and disturbed people. I often get paranoid myself just thinking about it.

YBYJjSQwaa	No, McCartney wrote it for Lennon's son Julian back when they were still the Beatles.|`|QbfiRykHaa	Paul McCartney wrote the song himself as far as I've ever known, in June of 1968 on the way to Cynthia Lennon's home, to visit while her and her son Julian during the time when John and Cynthia were in the process of divorcing over his affair with Yoko.<br>  Originally he sang "Hey Jules" in reference to Julian Lennon.<br>  The same Julian who was pretty much ignored by his father after he and Yoko got together and had Sean.<br>  John Lennon always thought Paul had written it for him for some reason.|`|U0LPJ2Puaa	No.  "Hey Jude" is a song by the English rock band The Beatles that was recorded in 1968. Originally titled "Hey Jules", the ballad was written by Paul McCartney—and credited to Lennon/McCartney—to comfort John Lennon's son Julian during his parents' divorce. .<br>  <br>  Cynthia Lennon said "I was truly surprised when, one afternoon, Paul arrived on his own. I was touched by his obvious concern for our welfare.... On the journey down he composed 'Hey Jude' in the car. I will never forget Paul's gesture of care and concern in coming to see us."[3]

(:|`|AnU0YjOYaa	Drama, but the hottest girls are in band!!!!!<br>  <br>  Oh man am I a schmexxii beast and you all are jealous....|`|aL0OCQG3aa	Hmm Id say choir, lots of fattys and stalkers in drama|`|93IZFDCNaa	Choir|`|THvfGib9aa	they all died last thursday.|`|ozCn1feYaa	math club!! :D|`|bPGnc5osaa	rightttt hurr:)|`|fSQ2Ttgqaa	neither, their in my bed.
vgcY5jHuaa	They all were amazing, but Dimbag was the best.<br>  <br>  Sorta like Eddie Van Halen. His band members are good, but he outshines them.|`|Z5mmaFK0aa	I agree to some extent. But overall Dime laid down the whole foundation for that band. He was the innovator of most if not all Composition. Then again Pantera was a team the others were just as important. It was all of them that made Pantera the Metal powerhouse that they were. <br>  <br>  I would say that my favorite thing about Phil was the profound power of his vocals. There is no doubt that he got his aggression across through his vocals. He was one of the first real true SCREAMERS him along with Mike Patton. Then came Max Cavalera but overall Phil and Patton started the Major Intense Screams.<br>  <br>  Rex was a solid bass player. SOLID. Vins drumming speaks for itself he is bad @ss. Technical as well to boot|`|dc49d60c4d19a92e193ce2f41c92cfedaa	I love all 4 of them|`|M7E1uIsKaa	I love them all! :)  Mostly Dimebag. But Phil is one of my favorite vocalists ever and Rex one of my favorite Bassists!  You're right, the others need to get more love.. they wouldnt have been the same band without all of them together!<br>  <br>  Guns n Roses - Slash with talent, but Axl put up a big fight for the spotlight.|`|h1yGVkkfaa	I heart em all,It weird because i like HELLYEAH vinnie's in that.<br>  Rex and Phil are in down,Down and hellyeah are awsome for those reasons.<br>  <br>  Edit: I wish that phil quit the needles WAY earlier,He's sounds more beastly then before.<br>  Edit 2.5:Dammit shred why do you have ot be ALWAYS right lol,Everything shred said is true.|`|YwtXSUAdaa	Well, I agree with you completely, but Dimebag was the best musician of them all and he was the coolest. Phil was a grade a douche bag.<br>  <br>  Can't think of any right now I'm tangled in a battle with the Yahoo Corporation.|`|Ew7hXGFtaa	I definitely agree with you! Although I do think Dimebag was the most talented at what he did in the band, all of the others where still amazing, in my opinion.|`|un2xSpRRaa	The Jimi Hendrix Experience<br>  <br>  <br>  Nobody says they're Jimi Hendrix Experience songs. They say they're Jimi Hendrix songs.|`|74949bbcd18d4caa76c3f5b6e04e85a0aa	I think that all the guys r great! Without that combination of guys i don't think Pantera would have been one of the best metal bands!! There can't b one without the other.|`|AgQForcYaa	The Doors. <br>  <br>  Damn you, Jim Morrison, with your big, awesome drug-induced ego...
bLr5Wbmraa	damn... this track is BANGIN! thanks for introducin me to this guy, ill definately check him and group out.|`|pwXcD7PIaa	I love that These Walls Don't Lie track it was partly written for this kid from Australia who died while painting graffiti. I prefer Loop Troop because I have his White Man's Burden CD and IDK why but I've only played it once or twice.<br>  <br>  He is a strange looking cat and his roots lie 50/50 between Reggae and Hip Hop. Loop Troop have performed at the formerly annual Wiesbaden, Germany Hall of Fame Graffiti event.<br>  <a href="http://wallstreetmeeting.de/news/support-wiesbaden-germany/" rel="nofollow">http://wallstreetmeeting.de/news/support...</a>|`|41mwqPuPaa	Thx man he's sick. Ill put him in my list of artists I need to listen more from.|`|RWd8L91xaa	Wow He Kinda Nice......I Liked Primetime|`|q4XUy0Duaa	I always liked Promoe and Loop Troop, and I'm pretty sure they're originally from Brooklyn, but then moved out to Sweden and blew up out there.  My favorite track from them is A Modern Day City Symphony:<br>  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snvjiAtcNNM" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snvjiAtcN...</a><br>  <br>  The tracks they did with the Arsonists are dope too!<br>  <br>  vvv @ Drab 1 - Nice link!
bLr5Wbmraa	never really liked them, heard a couple songs and didnt like em so i didnt bother to check out their albums. But that was years ago so if you can recommend me their best album ill give it a listen|`|xxgx0IVAaa	Black Magic.<br>  The song Grind is the s*it.<br>  I liked Bad Dreams too but you have to admit Black Magic was pretty good.|`|4amKLnNaaa	I have the bad dreams album  and it was good. These guys are a little overrated, yet still not the best group.   But check out bad dreams   its decent
rNqF4gIVaa	You only have to listen to his music to answer this question - it is unique and beautiful.|`|CrAwmz65aa	Mozart made a few innovations:<br>  <br>  <<<<<number one>>>>><br>  <br>  In the D major sonata, K 311, he wrote the themes in reverse order in the recapitulation.  This puts the first theme at both the beginning and the end, making a nice pair of bookends.  Many Twentieth Century composers followed that practice.  <br>  <br>  <<<<<number two>>>>><br>  <br>  In the C major sonata, K 545, he wrote the first theme in the recapitulation in the subdominant key in place of the usual tonic key.  Schubert did the same thing in his earlier symphonies and in his Trout Quintet.<br>  <br>  Especially innovations which influenced Beethoven:<br>  <br>  <<<<number one>>>>><br>  <br>  If the first movement of a composition in sonata form was in a minor key, Mozart often wrote the last movement in the parallel major. An example is the e minor violin sonata, K 304.  Beethoven did likewise in the g minor piano sonata, op. 49 no. 1 and in his Fifth Symphony.<br>  <br>  <<<<<number two>>>>><br>  <br>  In the F major sonata, K 280, Mozart wrote all the movements in sonata form, not just the first movement.  Beethoven did the same thing in "The Tempest" Sonata.<br>  Mendelssohn did the same thing in the Scotch Symphony.<br>  <br>  <<<<number three>>>>><br>  <br>  The Mozart c minor sonata, K 457, is believed to have inspired Beethoven's "Little Pathetique" Sonata, op. 10 no. 1, and his "Pathetique" Sonata, op. 13, both in the same key.<br>  <br>  <<<<number four>>>>><br>  <br>  In the A major sonata, K 331, Mozart wrote a theme and variations in place of the usual sonata movement.  Beethoven did the same thing in his Ab major sonata, op. 26.  <br>  <br>  <<<<number five>>>>><br>  <br>  In the Bb major sonata, K 570, Mozart wrote two themes in the first movement which were similar to each other.  Beethoven did the same thing in the Appassionata sonata.<br>  <br>  <<<<number six>>>>><br>  <br>  In many of his sonatas, (C major sonata, K 279, a minor sonata, K 310, C major sonata, K 330), Mozart wrote more than two themes in the first movement.  Beethoven followed suit in his symphonies.<br>  <br>  <<<<<number seven>>>>><br>  <br>  It seems that both composers regarded the subdominant as a way of saying goodby. Both composers emphasize the subdominant in the coda. <br>  <br>  In the C major sonata, K 279, second movement, Mozart emphasizes the subdominant chord with a secondary dominant in ms. 70-71. He does the same thing in the F major sonata, third movement, ms. 178-180. In the second movement of the C major sonata, K 545, we see a rarity in ms. 65-66: a secondary subdominant.<br>  <br>  In the second movement of the G major sonata, op. 49 no. 2, Beethoven emphasizes the subdominant with a secondary dominant in ms. 108-109.<br>  <br>  <<<<<number eight>>>>><br>  <br>  Take a look at the slow movement of the Mozart Sonata Facile, K 545. and that of the Beethoven "Pathetique" Sonata, op. 13. In both movements, all of the cadences are feminine cadences (dissonance on the strong beat, resolution on the weak beat) until the end of the last statement of the main theme. At this point, we hear the first masculine cadence (dissonance on the weak beat, resolution on the strong beat). This is ms. 63-64 in Mozart and ms. 65-66 in Beethoven. In both movements, the composer apologizes by giving us masculine cadences galore in the coda.<br>  <br>  <<<<<number nine>>>>><br>  <br>  In the d minor piano concerto, Mozart injects an extra solo theme at the beginning of the solo exposition.  Beethoven does likewise in his violin concerto.<br>  <br>  <<<<<number ten>>>>><br>  <br>  Mozart could almost beat the Romantic composers at their own game.  Listen to the slow movement from his A major piano concerto, K488, and that from his Symphonie Concertante for violin and viola, K 364, and you will see what I mean.<br>  <br>  Beethoven has also been noted for the schmaltzy slow movement in his Ninth Symphony.|`|obGQ2Bqfaa	O marks for the cut & paste from wiki answer<br>  <br>  Nowt amazing about Mozart, wrote some OK opera but the rest is trite.|`|QJ9d33jeaa	He was a revolutionary in his time. He changed the way people look at classical music|`|4jjv7XIuaa	nothing
RBW9ZX1iaa	Well the difference between jazz and improvising in rock and other forms of music is the freedom to go outside the expectations and rules when your playing jazz. As far as following the chord changes goes, you can choose to follow them as closely or loosely as you choose(as long as you resolve it... otherwise it becomes chaos). In traditional jazz, musicians followed the chords very closely and used them as a guide to know what notes are going to sound good. But in more Contemporary jazz musicians tend to look at the scales rather than chords to know what notes are going to cause tension, and how to resolve them. A pentatonic scale is a scale made up of the first third fourth fifth and sixth notes of a scale. They can sound really good when soloing but the usage is entirely up to the discretion of the musician. If you want to learn how to improvise then there are plenty of educational books based upon that subject. If your not looking to spend the money then you could simply pick a song, learn the chord changes and melody and then just fool around with it. The more you try the better you will get.|`|c8aAM8vvaa	Don't stick your self in scales firstly bad idea, just stick to notes of the chords then then improvise around them and then stick notes in from the scale if you want, i started with chordal notes it works 100% and you cant go wrong
NGNeT3rYaa	Those and Erica, she has a soft spot for him, Opal, Gillian took over her body once so she would want in for sure.|`|UY3zl9dFaa	I think he's going to be more into revenge than love for a while (I hope Kendall doesn't decide to "comfort" him in his grief). Maybe the women of Pine Valley are safe for a little while.|`|b2f5cc892d9a2ff6d43172b4bb022096aa	The "Ryan Harem"  too funny!  Look out, because I think he's on his way to taking back Kendall in the long run here,,,,,  of course she has to hide from him that she was the one driving the car,,,,,,|`|U1847aMfaa	don't forget wives # 5 and #6  you can use a couple of strays off the streets that we don't see very much of, may be just hear about|`|oVRA1ze2aa	LOL  Ryan is a spray tan user..He uses his wives til they lose there<br>  minds.<br>  LADIES is Pine Valley stay away from him..Please|`|DcVoq5Tuaa	He was a con man when he first came to PV and he's still conning each and every one of them.|`|20ee7f2aadb248558085cabc8d4743ccaa	funny. Yes, Ryan has definately had his share of Pine valley women. Maybe he needs to go to a town close by and find someone. He is running out of choices in P.V. I just hope  he doesn't hook up with Kendall again. I love Zach. :)<br>  M|`|XnYkROf3aa	ryan thinks reese is responsible for greenlees death so i don't think he will go for her, but i think hes gonna go for kendall. because they were once an idem and he told zach he would take everything away from him.|`|AA11451041	Ryan is a HUGE player!!  I wish they would kill him off and keep Greenlee.|`|AA10343852	Lol. I do go with you on the whole everyone's up for grabs because Ryan has been the heart throb for so long. However I think he blames Zach and Reese for Greenlee's "death", so I don't think that he'll be going for her. I do however think he will either make a play for Kendall or go back after Anne. Did you see his face when Anne hugged Aiden? So it's a good toss up. On the spoilers it says that the writers are going to make Ryan a man of action. So that could mean that he gets crazy and kills Zach off and ends up in prison for a while, or he might actually make up his mind on what he's going to do. He may just stay single for a while.

mT23vvbMaa	Try using Pandora (its free and easy to use) and set up a OAR radio station. Pandora will play OAR along with other bands with a similar sound, I believe you can even set up a radio station based on a song you like and Pandora will play other songs with a similar sound, beat, and tempo. I use Pandora and it has lead me to a lot of bands I would have otherwise not known about and from it I have a new favorite band and broader perspective of the music I enjoy.|`|ftVXoyOUaa	REIGN<br>  <a href="http://www.myspace.com/abandnamedreign" rel="nofollow">http://www.myspace.com/abandnamedreign</a>|`|Hzz6Z1aCaa	Other bands like O.A.R are the Fray, Coldplay, and Snow Patrol.

He didn't want to date me because he was already in a relationship.      well, it turned out the girl dumped him and then we started dating.     I am a Capricorn also.<br>  <br>  You can do like I did in the beginning and give him his space.  If you are dating keep going out but try not to be hung up as it will scare him off.    That is all I can say about a Scorpio man, just give him time.<br>  <br>  It isn't necessary to end the relationship as you said you try.  You are best friends after all and being that close, it would hurt you both to end things between you.     Take 1 day at a time.  He really cares.............<br>  you don't want to lose him.    Enjoy your time together ok?<br>  <br>  <br>               Best Wishes.|`|d2uGruHiaa	Don't end the relationship you guys have. He loves you, and Scorpios when they are admitting to you about their love, they rarely lie, but I honestly think he's not ready to be in a relationship just yet. He doesn't want to ruin what he has with you. He's probably testing you first to make sure you don't hurt him. He wants to be able to trust you with all his heart, because Scorpios do take a while to open up. Even though you guys are best friends, it's a huge transition to overtake. Things will change. You both will change. Just be prepared. Don't do anything you'll regret. If he loves you, he'll want to get to know you even better. Just give it some time.

Z5mmaFK0aa	Both bands are awesome. My kind of stuff for sure.<br>  <br>  Anata is more my taste I really dig them. More great finds man you really know how to dig these bands up. I know there are a lot of technical death bands out there it really seems to be growing.<br>  <br>  The thing is with a lot of these Technical death bands is they need to chill with the Constant Tremolo Picking Riffs. They are heavily in Black Metal too. <br>  <br>  Like I have a couple in my own songs but the thing I do a little different form most of these bands is I like to Incorporate GROOVE in my songs. I love Groove I mean there is plenty of room to be Technical but u gotta deliver some Groove from time to time.|`|12QJ9QMRaa	hmmmmm......<br>  <br>  Musicaly I prefered the first one.<br>  <br>  Too much blastbeats, but he broke them up and varied their use nicely.<br>  <br>  Second one was kinda stock.  And the little lead guitar noodle ddidn't do much fo rme.<br>  <br>  Would like both more if they didn't hate me, but hey.. what can ya do?<br>  Even so, that is my honest musical eval.  Anata has soem decent skill.|`|r5CttpsFaa	Honestly, neither one really blew me away. I've listened to enough DM that something really has to be interesting to keep my attention for long. Neither one was bad, and if my buddy put either one on his car I wouldn't complain, but i got bored pretty quickly with both. If I had to pick one, I think I preferred the first one, although I've never been a huge fan of tech.<br>  <br>  edit: actually, on a second listen i'm kind of digging Anata, although the vocals leave a lot to be desired<br>  <br>  second edit: eeeehhh...they keep squandering their good ideas|`|AgQForcYaa	Intelligible death metal lyrics! Good God! <br>  <br>  I like 'em!
56bNLJykaa	Certainly the Scorsese, De Niro, along with Schrader team really hit home with this one,along with the help of a great Hermann score, Jodie Foster and Harvey Keitel. Well.. the message of Taxi Driver is really to show the "lonely" man with twisted values from the war and his attempts to correct (through his views) an isolated society.
P0Fjh59Eaa	I'm so pissed i missed this past week! my local station hasn't be showing OLTL since last Thursday and OMG i'm pissed! lol <br>  <br>  i hate it when i'm out of the loop. oh well, i asked a question on it so hopefully you lovely ppl will fill me in.|`|UY3zl9dFaa	Better yet the look on HER face! John won't be pushed around by her, but she's certainly pushing him even further away. Why isn't she catching on that once Marty came back it was over? Time to move on, girl!|`|AA12336927	I think Blair just found her match. She is used to men asking how high when she said jump, I NOW think John may be good for her.<br>   BUT GOD, WHAT IS UP WITH HIS HAIR!?!<br>   I did better on the first cut I gave my boys in transition from the mullet<br>  ROFL|`|97158e12e6c17080ec04a0a2b2456b2aaa	YES!!!!!!! omg i thought i was the only one who caught that, he gave her a look like, " who do you think you are, i dont have to go anywhere with you" gosh, i think shes really starting to annoy him. John is not the type of man who lets a woman push him around, and Blair is a pushy woman.|`|b2f5cc892d9a2ff6d43172b4bb022096aa	Yes !  LOL  Since Marty can do no wrong, and Blair is obviously against her, that is also counting against Blair,  then try and order John around,,,  uh  ,,I don't think so ,,,you better think again Blair!|`|NGNeT3rYaa	Oh yes, she has met her match! He isn't the type of man to be led around by the nose, she looked shocked!

I think there are tons of better shows out there and I don't really understand why it gets so much attention and hype; but it's not bad either.|`|YWjhqlxbaa	It's a crap show. I rarely watch it and when I do, I turn away from the TV to try to sleep. <br>  <br>  It sucks when networks like CBS, NBC or ABC cancel the good shows and leave crappy shows on like "Two and a Half Men."|`|y7A24Kfoaa	There's a Morman father, a man-sl*t uncle, and a kid on his way to a premature heart attack.|`|loqsl5xXaa	awesome!!! freakin love the show i don't miss an epi.|`|2gwenmsjaa	I LOVE that show.

Gray Man- because i love the story and characters<br>  <br>  all are ongoing still..well d gray man is on hiatus|`|WS1rqp0Gaa	I like both anime and manga.I think both of them are great!And the first manga comes to mind is Soul Eater.I've beeb waiting for a new chapter to come out and it's sooo slow!!|`|d0b19b6e53bf5f04f7ade24285468c28aa	manga|`|wO2WY54kaa	I prefer Anime.  But i would recommend Manga.  The first manga that comes into my mind is Fearies Landing.|`|4b04c75387288f794c445a45826af7b1aa	I prefer manga, though I still like anime :3 I like Manga just that bit more because it's the original and is more in depth and has funny little extras. And it's weird saying this... but sometimes I just have no patience for anime, because you have to watch it at a certain pace and there's fillers and some scenes drag on, but manga you can read as fast as you want or as leisurely as you want so you can appreciate the art and stuff. It's portable too :D Another big reason is because yaoi comes mostly in the form of manga... lol! ^______^ If only manga didn't cost so much waaah ... at least downloading is free muahahaha >:P<br>  <br>  A random Manga... umm Keroro Gunsou! I love that manga! Mostly because it's diffferent from most shounen mangas, none of that typical I'm gonna be the best/fightscenefightscene stuff lol, just lots of unique episodes and humour. You should read it it's so awesome, the friends I've recommended it to all love it! About alien frogs yahh, it's amazing and unpredictable and cute lol xD|`|bZsF1n0zaa	Right now I prefer Manga:<br>  <br>  <br>  I'm only watching 1 anime and readong 2 manga:<br>  <br>  Anime: One Piece<br>  <br>  Manga: One Piece & Fairy Tail<br>  <br>  <br>  Both are really great, although I prefer One Piece 100x more than any other anime.manga that i've ever watched.

My friends say it's awesome! And I watch the anime version of it too.<br>  <br>  ;p|`|csPdmhUlaa	I like anime better than manga.

UnMramoWaa	Holy sh!t I finally watched this movie last night (its been sitting on my lappy for about a month). <br>  The only character I enjoyed in that movie was Ben Kingley, he is awesome in the movie Sexy Beast as well.  I kept thinking the main guy was the one off Heroes, and the music was really quite mainstream for '94, nothing from Outkast, The Roots or even Scarface, which were big to me back then.<br>  It was amateur, and apart from ben and famke, the characters were boring and one dimensional.  <br>  After watching that I watched Poetic Justice and it was hilarious as always, totally overshadowed The Wackness.|`|eZCCSMykaa	lmfao josh a gangstaaa now hahahhaa|`|l72FO4eMaa	How many nuts did you bust typing this out?|`|oJfBZ8wOaa	LOL you maded it sound like it was a good movie then i read then last part.<br>  LMFAO|`|os6FaEBlaa	One of the worst movies you ever seen?

q4XUy0Duaa	LMAO @ definition of ratio...<br>  <br>  1000:1<br>  <br>  Just look at the record sales.  For every underground artist who sells a thousand records, there's a mainstream artist who sells millions. Probably because the media forces a lot of people/children to listen to mainstream artists.|`|haxPqmIgaa	1000000000:1. cuz altota ppl just listen 2 the radio and r 2 layz or influenced by the mainstream to actually gat there facts str8 and kno how good undaground is. some ppl dont know how good it is bc they tricked bi mainstrm thinkin itz real hip hop (or there just 12yr olds)<br>  <br>  BUT I KNOW DA TRUTH!!! HAHA|`|dEYKu0r2aa	^^^^^<br>  More Like<br>  10,000:1|`|41mwqPuPaa	487.145 to 1|`|FxmDmTG1aa	I think it might be the same about but there might be a little more in the underground ya digg??|`|ioNTTqKfaa	50-50<br>  <br>  There are a lot of people who listen to underground hip hop. Take into account that there are generally 15-20 mainstream rappers at a given time, while there are tens of thousands of underground rappers. Plus, there are only a few mainstream rappers per year who go platinum. Underground rappers dont' sell as much because there are a lot more of them for the fanbase to choose from. If you added up the album sales from ALL the underground rappers, I bet it would be at least equal to the sales from the mainstream rappers.

M2CPvadfaa	I don't think I would ever want to be rich, you realize who your friends are. People might use you for money, and money/material things do not buy happiness. Money also doesn't measure a persons success in life, what measures success is what kind of person you are. Money is just one of those things that the media makes us crave. I would prefer to be poor and have lots of friends and family around me than to be rich and have "fake" people around me that just tell me what I want to hear. Although, I would personally think that being a middle class citizen would be perfect because I think the most of us has had money problems in the past and it's not very fun.<br>  As for the fixing part, I believe that knowledge is power. Most of my friends think of me when they need something to be fixed and I have no problem helping them out either. I'm like the jack-of-all-trades<br>  <br>  M&J|`|DUg1IkTIaa	I am looking for a handy-man.  I don't care to be "rich", because I just want to be happy and healthy.

Nytn8HB8aa	I prefer to sleep with somebody else. It's very comforting to have that presence next to you, and I especially like being held possessively. It makes me feel protected and loved. <br>  <br>  :/<br>  <br>  I hope you sleep well, regardless!|`|hUXAA4Zcaa	It's kind of crazy- when you are single sleeping alone seems so easy, and so much more comfortable.  Of course, once you are in a relationship with someone you feel like you need someone in your bed to sleep.  I know I used to love sleeping alone, and now, I hate having the bed to myself.  Like tonight...  :(|`|43ZfkGHmaa	someone else there too is always comforting to me. Idk i think its just like a subconcious thing where you feel more protected. but other times sleeping alone is sometimes better just cause the other person isnt stealing all the blankets or kicking you in there sleep (:<br>  <br>  my doggy is always a good foot warmer though (:|`|rYQrwD5Raa	I am alone, always alone.

I'm now happily married, and both of us hate to sleep alone, even when necessary.  We've both slept at the hospital in chairs, simply to be together (even when we should have gone home) and yes, we even sleep together when we 'hate' each other, simply because we still love each other enough and want to be together even when our 'minds' tell us something totally different.  This is BOTH of us, though, and not one or the other.  We are together forever and beyond, and would hope to be 'two soul mates in one being' when we get to Heaven, because we really do like each other, and are 'best friends' as well as being spouses, partners, playmates and lovers.|`|PogMq7Pcaa	it depends. how many pillows owuld i b sleeping with if i was alone? cuz usually its like someones there anyway i have so many pillows. unless they're a bedhog and dont like to snuggle then i REFUSE to sleep with them.|`|hNa5oHxQaa	Aww would you like to sleep in my bed.<br>  I'll be sleeping alone tonight too.<br>  But I'm cool with being alone if you don't want to.|`|grifjdr0aa	with my puppy.|`|s4iVl04raa	Ugh, I have such a hard time sleeping alone.

X1uOh8ylaa	Hey, I hope this helps. It was taken from an interview that Noah Wylie gave in regards to his return to ER:<br>  <br>  As a result of [Carter’s] once near-fatal stabbing, which led to my subsequent drug addiction, I come back from Africa requiring additional medical treatment for my one remaining kidney. I’m embarrassed to get treatment at County General, so I go up to Northwestern to get my dialysis up there, and that’s where Dr. Benton spies my name on a patient list and comes to pay me a visit," Wyle told TV Guide.<br>  <br>  I have a gut feeling that this may not end well, perhaps the entire gang will be coming back for his funeral. I don't even want to imagine what that would be like, I cried for days after Mark Greene (Anthony Edwards) died....|`|Y012fxz3aa	That was the last we've all seen Carter until tonight! I was so pumped!<br>  He's asked for a job at County again, also!<br>  <br>  My mom and i were shocked in the last few minutes you saw. We don't know what's going on either, no one does. Our theories are cancer, dialysis treatments, or maybe AIDS. He has been working in Africa, supposedly.<br>  <br>  Hope this has helped! The preview for next week said he "has a secret". We should find out! :D|`|L4xSeRNzaa	I think he is hooked up to a dialysis machine for kidney failure. we don't know yet though.|`|ETcBRko3aa	It is Kidney Dialysis.  Chemo is usually done during the day and there are nurses hanging around checking vitals, etc.<br>  <br>  He is dying from kidney failure...but what caused it?????<br>  <br>  It could be AIDS since he was in Africa working in AIDS clinics.  AIDS does cause renal (kidney) failure....|`|i6mydMOyaa	The Kem person was visiting her parents in Paris during this episode <br>  <br>  I don't know if he had cancer...it looked like a kidney dialysis machine to me...but I could be totally wrong. <br>  <br>  I guess we will find out in episodes to come! He will be working at the hospital again!

e7qTRzfkaa	First off. Good job singing it takes courage to put you video on youtube. What can make you voice at its purest go to a local voice lesson coach, that really seriously helps a lot. But you were a trained opera. The belting wasnt there good singer but it didnt really work out well. But it was a very good job.|`|e2HW9iQ5aa	I agree. Your voice sounds good, but a little uneven. "belting" in places is a good term. But, what really bothered me was the breathing. Those loud, quick suckings of air after a while got very distracting to me and I was focusing more on your breathing in than singing out. There's really no reason to take quick gulps of air like that 2 seconds apart. You should be taking 1 big breath for every 3-4 gulps. And, I think as someone already pointed out, that might be the root of the "belting"/unevenness to your singing.|`|8fMUnAY6aa	thats horrible that your voice teacher cant tell when you are belting. Belting to me is singing while yelling. That sounds so strange to say its yelling but it is.  you are definitely belting during 1:33 and then later on in the song a few times and like the whole last part of the song. You sound good! Break a leg on Broadway!|`|AA10832514	You are very talented and very cute!  Downright adorable, I think!  Anyhow, I'm not a professional, but I did manage a small recording studio for awhile.  I hear you getting a little pitchy on your high notes, especially when you're going from high to low.  You're belting when you manage to start with a lungfull of air. which makes sense of course.  Your high notes are flat. <br>  <br>  I say this with all good faith and humour.  I hope you will take it with a grain of salt and thank you for allowing me to critique your work.  All the best.|`|ourVACyUaa	Maybe a little bit, but you should sing it out! Your voice is absolutely amazing too!|`|uPDAmpdFaa	Not being a woman. I'm not as familiar with how the female voice works as I am the male. With that said, you appeared to go back and forth between a mixed voice and head voice. As if you're unsure of how to achieve what you want to achieve vocally. In the beginning there were a few blips here and there, after one of your transitions, that you might have been belting. They were so brief, I don't think it should be considered anything more than an issue with transitioning. Toward the end of the video you are clearly starting to yell while rocking back and forth. That's really bad technique that can cause vocal fatigue and possibly damage in the form of nodules.<br>  <br>  I recommend you stop trying to belt for now. You have not learned how to do it yet and your current technique and habits could damage your voice. While I am thinking about it. Try not to move around your body so much and try not to lean your head back when hitting higher notes. You'll sing better if you're not doing that.|`|VHka0aHFaa	you need to work on your breathing while you sing
MlraNN6Maa	Yes. I LOVE cherry flavored chapstick. Not because of that silly Katy Perry song, because after many years of trial and error with different types of lip balms (carmex, blistex etc), cherry chapstick is the only one that has truly given me the most out of my money. Non sticky, makes your lips look and feel great, nice scent. :)|`|SUG8wXmUaa	Yes i do, I only use certain kinds though. Carmex, soft lips, and Chapstick brand chap sticks have an ingredient in them that dries out your lips so that you will have to use it more often, meaning you will have to buy more. It's a marketing technique.|`|HiBkW0iOaa	I use cherry chapstick.

nk10LCvXaa	its a great season, but there are some disappointments. I can't stand hurley anymore. he used to be a cool funny guy. but now he's just a crazy lunatic. and i'm also tired of watching locke being manipulated by  ben linus and now widmore. its pathetic. <br>  i think the show is starting to become too complicated and confusing.<br>  but the show is still my fav show. its great.|`|JxUFDutxaa	I'm really enjoying the season so far..<br>  Great acting all around..and cool storyline|`|dMBSE8ilaa	It's awesome! I loved last night's episode! So many throwbacks to the pilot. And yet they still put up more questions that will be hopefully answered later. I can't wait until next week's episode.<br>  <br>  I also liked the time jumps because we got to see different time periods of the island, but I think they stopped now because of Locke turning the wheel.|`|DUg1IkTIaa	I thinks it better than ever.  They are now giving more info about the science behind the island and it's mechanics.  Also there is more info about the "spirits of the island" (the dead ones that appear).|`|LBovv7Sxaa	this is my favorite season. (they seem to get better as they go)<br>  it's all going forward with the story.<br>  i'm so excited to see how things shape up, since there are about 29 episodes left in the entire series.|`|hL57d1MNaa	It's really good, and it can only get better! Next week looks good - It's called "The Life and Death of Jeremy Benthem", Jeremy Benthem being Locke's other name. Looks really good.<br>  <br>  Man, I love that show.|`|zovrJ0yXaa	its ok but its been a bit of a disappointment after the last season. season 4 was the best so far in my eyes, and this season hasnt quite lived up to it. its been a bit slow, and the whole story of getting the oceanic six back to the island isnt as good as the one getting them off it. plus, the whole time hopping thing on the island is a bit of a mess, and theres no real focus there. its been a series of missed opportunities, as so far, i still dont know anything i didnt already know about rousseau, the dharma intiative, the others etc. there have been one or two revelations but they havnt rocked me the way some of the ones in seasons 3 and 4 did. its still a great show and i look forward to every episode as always, its just not as satisfying a season as i was hoping for. also, give locke more to do. i cant believe theres been so many episodes and we still dont know what he was up to off the island. c'mon, hes the best character, give the guy sumthing meaningful to do. he hasnt had a single cool locke moment all season, and thats a crime|`|HEs6bzOtaa	I love lost, every season i think is amazing<br>  This season i would say as good as every other season. Can't wait for next week's episode<br>  <br>  Anyway anyone here a kyle xy fan because if you are<br>  Please go to www.savekylexy.com and press save kyle xy<br>  If you can sign a petition it might not get cancelled <br>  Please help|`|b8a3a3de3ff9b2402cfe47da112e1149aa	well at first i was disapointed about the whole time traveling thing and i thought it was getting too weird. but the past two episodes (especially the most recent one) have been really good and I'm especially looking foward to next weeks episode. <br>  here are some theories i have:<br>  concerning what happened to aaron: i think ben had someone take him so that kate would be willing to go back on the island. or claire came to kate again (like in her dream) and said don't you dare take him back to the island so kate listened to her and either gave aaron to her or to claires mom<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  about them all getting on the plane: i did notice that sayid was wearing handcuffs and he had the jacket over them (just like kate did when they first went to the island in the oceanic flight) so i think that eloise or ben had something to do with that cus eloise said they needed to make it as close to the original crash as possible. i also think that's why hurley had a guitar case. or he had a case because he saw charlie again and charlie somehow convinced him to go on the plane and bring his guitar case. <br>  <br>  i had one theory about ben: sayid is the one that beat him. he knew that if he went to talk to sayid that sayid would beat him and ben called the cops before he visited sayid so they would get there right as sayid was beating him. i think the cop that was with sayid was one of bens people. or sayid was arresting for killing all those ppl when he was an assasin for ben and when he was "rescueing" hurley. and if sayid didnt beat ben then it was desmond. in season 4 ben told widmore that he would kill penny because widmore had his daughter, alex, killed. i think that ben tried to kill penny ( when he called jack we saw that he was on a dock with a bunch of boats) and desmond beat him up before he could kill her.|`|5SmX1oLlaa	lost is one of my all time favorite shows. im not sure how this season is shaping up. i really liked the first two seasons more i miss the unseen forces on the show, the mist monster they huge thing knocking down trees. i know we want to know more about the people but i want more weird stuff to happen not just them getting back to the island. does this make sense. dont want them to stray to far from what we loved about the show in the first place.|`|c5GpMlrlaa	Jumping in late just to keep the train going.<br>  <br>  Tonight's episode was amazing, especially considering it was mostly flashback...the character development, surprises and action were all intact.<br>  <br>  I really felt bad for John...and the way he got down off the table after he heard Jack was taking the flights was so great...then Ben straggles him...they never fail to surprise you at least once.<br>  <br>  Oh and throwing a theory in: Christian (who told john about Hawking) gave ben the same advice. Ben thought Christian was working with him alone, helping HIM get back to the island to lead-which explains his departure. Upon hearing the Christian was making the same promises to John he decided that he wasn't going let Christian/(Jacob?) play favorites anymore.|`|ZXojGNL4aa	I think this season is extremely good. I think the first season was the best season but this is the second best season. There's just so many twists and turns it gets so exciting. The one thing I don't really like in this season is on the island it gets very confusing. But I like this season a lot and lost is my favorite show.|`|VvKJUCYgaa	It's pretty epic!<br>  Very suspensful and a whole lot of amazing, yet shocking twists. <br>  I'm so happy that Jin is alive!<br>  And the flashes through time are so cool! How Jin met Danielle when her and her people were stranded on the island and the story of how the smoke monster had killed everyone except for her.<br>  But where is little Aaron?<br>  Oooh! Can't wait for next week!|`|6u2mcDJQaa	Hmmm I was quite let down in season 5... was expecting each and every episode to be mindblowing... but for a few initial episodes... rest of the episodes lack that thrilling factor!!!<br>  <br>  I guess i have very high expectations.... considering the fact that there are soo many mysteries... i wonder how they are gonna answer all of them!!!|`|EMM6wlm2aa	I love it and I can't wait for wednesday. i love how the answers are coming fast and furious now. just want to know whats up with the 4 toed statue|`|gZLXSbWHaa	I like it so far.

29def525b4de3e4f1e95aaabfaa25f77aa	I've always thought of Holly Robinson Peete as a very cultured and diverse woman. She speaks fluent French, does a lot of advocacy on behalf of autism (which her son suffers from) and she also does a lot of charity work for Parkinson's disease, which afflicted her father.

Uv6fADcaaa	I think Prince has influenced the R&B crowd drastically, as much as Michael Jackson has???? It's a fairly close call.<br>  <br>  However, I think MJ recieves far more recognition because he is constantly in the media, due to his... eccentric tendencies. When most people hear Michael Jackson's name, the first thought isn't always related to music... with Prince it usually is.<br>  <br>  You don't really hear from Prince unless it is related to his work... He isn't nearly as much of a household name as MJ, but I still believe he has had an influence on today's music, even if the recognition isn't accredited to him as it should be...|`|EdBCksSwaa	I think that if you consider the artists that you listed you can come up with an answer.These people are probably not capable of understanding anything outside of the pop garbage that they try and project.A perfect example of pop garbage is the terrible music that wacko Jacko makes.Now consider that Chris Brown and Beyonce also make pop garbage and its easy to see what there influenced by.I am not a big fan of Prince but the guy is an amazing song writer and one heck of a guitar player.Chris Brown,Beyonce,Micheal Jackson----Its garbage----studio manufactured money making garbage.|`|F0ImwHlUaa	Mike Jackson Just want to get in bed with little kids|`|AjPbtm7oaa	They're all idiots & Prince didn't sing stupid songs like "Ben"
12QJ9QMRaa	Pro.<br>  <br>  With a caveat.<br>  <br>  Unlike some of their pro fans I don't just blindly love everything they have ever produced, or think they are the best at every instrument ever.<br>  <br>  I am actually very objective when I look at their music, and base my opinons on breaking down their songs, and seeing what I do like, vs what I don't like.<br>  <br>  But unlike the Antis, I also refuse to expect them to be stcuk forever in 1985, or to sound like pissed 25 year olds, when they are 45.  I also have no problem with a band experimenting with different sounds and styles, but If I don't lie something, I won't buy it (like ReLoad).<br>  <br>  I also refuse to get caught up in the revisionist history and bandwagon (Im cool so I am gonna bash Metallica) attitude so prevalent today.<br>  <br>  Mustaine's influence and importance to the band is way overestimated.<br>  <br>  But they are a fantastic band, that is consitently one of the best live, and their last album gets top marks form me.<br>  <br>  If someone else dislikes them, that is fine, I just dislike it when people force their view on me.<br>  <br>  **Hey Leah..what is wrong wiht James personality?  I've met the guy several times and he is cool as heck in my book.  (My GF thinks so too)<br>  <br>  **Mustaine is a great Rhythm guitarist.  But I have listened to the Demo tapes for Metallica when he was trying to play Lead, and he was very sloppy and not so great at that.<br>  <br>  So, from that Standpoint, Kirk was the better guitarist.  Simply put, he is a better lead than Dave, and played those and future leads jsut fine for Metallica.<br>  <br>  Dave on the other hand is on par with James for being a great Rhythm guy.  Honestly, aside form Daves ego, there shoudl be no comparo.  One is a Lead, the other is a Rhtythm guy. Period.|`|pNUtnoC8aa	Pro<br>  True hardcore Metallica fans love every word to come out of James's mouth on every album.

E2VUH8Q0aa	when I get the chance...<br>  <br>  <br>  seriously, no, I don't hate Geminis. They annoy me, but it's hardly a hate thing....|`|l3b0hjdWaa	Just because someone doesn't like you doesn't mean they're hating on you.<br>  If someone claims not to like Geminis, it's based off of their own personal experience which is different for each individual that has a problem with them. They just need to realize that not all millions of Geminis (that they don't even know) are like that.|`|84726b724d7d1fd7da09652c50425c38aa	I quite like Geminis.|`|1PdUecpYaa	i love geminis. my two bestfriends are geminis and i love them... they're just misunderstood.they're not two faced, they're adaptable... they're not selfish at all. they've always been there for me. one of my gemini best friend is married and pregnant... and she's been faithful to her aquarius husband... they're very much in love and i doubt she'll ever cheat on him.<br>  <br>  you know who you are.. you don't need other people's opinion on you... forget what other people say, you're bloody awesome!!|`|BlZ6vJOAaa	I don't "hate on". but i just never have any friends who are gemini. The only thing i dislike is all the talking with the guys. i find it hard to make a connection with someone who is all over the place like that.|`|drzN1kkuaa	my moms a gemini!<br>  <br>  hahah, well anyways i dont get the point in leos dating virgos or whatever<br>  i hate questions that are like im dating a capicorn! help!<br>  <br>  <br>  honestly, i think people are just people who act the way they act.|`|Xf8Z6rJfaa	No i don't.|`|7p3TCz3qaa	Your not hated,people just love to point out the negative side of your sign,it makes them feel better about themselves.There are two sides to every sign, only most people prefer to only acknowledge the positives in themselves but they don't give others the same break.Those are Gemini traits but that's only part of the story ,they are also charming,fun loving,loyal,hard working,great communicators,they have much more that's positive about them than negative.So stop listening to what others say about Geminis in general.You are You,a unique individual,if people can't see you for who YOU are then they're the ones with problems.You know yourself and that's what matters!|`|FVFg8Fjtaa	Look, I'm a Gemini. I can't care less if people like or dislike gemini. I tell you - every zodiac sign has good and bad traits - not only gemini. Those who said " Geminis are blah blah blah... and that's why I can't stand them" are as superficial as geminis are supposed to be. Also, these traits are - admit it - generalizing.<br>   I have some of the traits of gemini - moody, impatient, dual - natured. Am I social butterfly? Far from it. I prefer to spend my time alone, doing whatever I feel like, than talking with other people. I rarely chat online cos I think it's a waste of time. I'm only chatty if I'm around  people I like and am familiar with. <br>   I'm very faithful to my boyfriend and my friend who's supposed to be  faithful according to her sign has been cheating her boyfriend again and again. So, chill and from your own description about yourself, I'm sure most people will like you.|`|d2dkgYRaaa	Nah, i love Geminis. some of my best friends are Geminis. Then again, I'm friends with most everyone too...damn, I'm a social Aquarius! ^_^|`|p0D4dxEqaa	i know two geminis and both of them are two faced, moody, selfish and jealous.|`|S0GSFVswaa	Why would people hate on us were freaking awesome!!<br>  <br>  Does anyone need me to explain that more intellectually? <br>  I can(:|`|ehdFib8iaa	no|`|IT7ka3Ybaa	not really. they're pretty cool|`|FIdA3FiCaa	geminis are most certianly not 'two faced'; where ever your getting this 'gemini hating' information, you shouldnt listen to it.  they are actually very real, kind people are are really intelligent.  i'm a taurus- im really practical and dont take bullshit... geminis dont either.  one of my best friends is a gemini and my roommate is a gemini and i love them both to death!|`|I2WKO33Maa	I am also a Gemini and I don't agree with their thoughts on us, many people have different attitudes, no one can have a single attitude for his entire life, we all have good and bad sides, maybe the thing that pushes them to think that we are two-faced person is because of the fact that Gemini represents a two person..<br>  <br>  <a href="http://FreeTryAcai.com/blog" rel="nofollow">http://FreeTryAcai.com/blog</a><br>  <a href="http://superslim99.wordpress.com/" rel="nofollow">http://superslim99.wordpress.com/</a>|`|O21k4xn1aa	Hell no, I love 'em as a matter of fact.  We really are on the same wavelength and understand each other without even trying.  Some of the coolest (and sexiest) people I've met are Geminis. Not all of them are two faced, but they sure do love to talk!|`|ZGvpWQ1Aaa	i'm a GEMINI!!! WOOO GO US!!! oh, and all of that junk they say is SO not true. I mean, come on, girl, you know Geminis aren't two faced! we rock the world.. :)|`|Vi0S0xbuaa	im a Taurus and have a Gemini best friend and a gemini crush.<br>  <br>  they just take awhile to warm up but they are really cool.|`|Q5hVEyfoaa	Girl we are thinking alike I just asked the same question as well.

8bb58fa4a42dc6a54ae5600a0d408c42aa	OK, so to avoid the standard answers ie Lord of the Rings, Indy, Star Wars. A few really great suggestions are...<br>  <br>  I just saw "The Reader" and I thought Kate Winslet was great. The story was touching and was a unique experience.<br>  <br>  "The Sting" and "Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid" are two of my favorites with two amazing actors in Newman and Redford.<br>  <br>  "One Flew Over the Cuckoos Nest" is Nicholson at his best.

Great acting, beautiful sets, and scenes that made me cry!<br>  <br>  <br>  Schindler's List - It is a good example of peoples intolerance for others, whether it be the color of your skin, your religion, your political preference, etc....and the lengths people will go to eliminate anyone or anything they don't like.

y5FfKGAsaa	I agree with your reasons.. but I think the fame has got into her head. When she first started on Making the Band, she was just a normal, fun girl who was close friends with Aundrea. I liked her then. But as time went by, she began getting caught up into the media, which has separated her friendships with the group & making her think way over her head.<br>  <br>  She is a little too much, but she plays into the group of Danity Kane. Without her, they aren't complete. They have to finish what they started, and I hope they can get back together & patch things up.|`|kWOAxzmkaa	i defenitly agree wit you 100% ive never liked her since the show i could see right through here... she's all about herself.. && she looks OLD lol|`|wFy80O73aa	First, I don't really care about her and the group, but why would you even get  mad or worried about someone else's image and what she does. Just let her be who she wants to be, if that's what she decided to do with her life that's her choice. If she was the reason for the group to break up means she had the biggest role in the group, if they didn't  care they would just pick someone else and continue what they're doing. And who's diddyyy, so what if she was disrespectful to him, he probably needed that anyways ...lol|`|56dfvnwmaa	I agree with everything except part of number 3. she actually got nice thick and voluptuous. my only problem with her is that she has overdone the make up. I'm all for seeing girls wearing make up but she overdid the make up and the beach blond hair just is not working at all.<br>  <br>  but I really am not that surprised though. I could pretty much tell that she was a freak since the 1st season of making the band 3.
QbfiRykHaa	The companies that buy advertising time during the show stop buying commercials, and the show becomes unprofitable. When the show is unprofitable, the network cancels the show and it goes away.<br>  <br>  The networks have a bunch of shows that they've got on the back-burner, they run a pilot that went over well with test audiences and replace the cancelled show with the "mid-season replacement", sometimes they shuffle around better performing programming to offset the higher rated competition for that time slot.<br>  <br>  Take a look at Brilliant But Cancelled.|`|jh8poywzaa	i may be wrong, but i think it goes through a screening of other bad rating t.v. shows until the highest rate gets voted and then is back on until it gets another bad rating|`|E4v6gOiNaa	first they loose money then people start loosing jobs and then it gets cancled

Grab the Italian Job or any of the Bourne trilogy if you want some action flick.|`|yqe0I5zpaa	No, Pitt and Jolie are great for the roles.

I didn't think that the plot was all that impressive. And while Brad and Angelina have great chemistry, the movie was just sort of sub-par.|`|pzY0ARqDaa	Honestly, i didn't like it, but it is just my opinion, if it sounds good to you, rent it! :-)|`|AA11702277	i actually didn't expect it to be as good as it was<br>  <br>  it had humorous parts, and good action parts<br>  i'd say rent it!
QooHtEC6aa	I think since there's so many questions out there for us to answer people are more attracted to those that seem interesting or are easy to answer. Also, I think being recognized plays a roll in how many people answer you. I myself have trouble getting my questions answered too but that doesn't stop me. Don't get discouraged. Y!A is still a fun and interesting way to discover new things. One last thing, depending on what section you place a question it might be easier to get responses. Most people in P&S aren't serious about the questions/answers, which is fine, but other sections will most likely be more respondive. Good luck.|`|mns5yLmRaa	It has to appeal to someone - putting serious questions in a "fun" section like P&S isn't right.

You're not the only one.|`|tFGMfDthaa	I don't believe in answering a question to get 2 points. If I thing I have something to say which will help someone or an answer for the question being asked, I will answer it.|`|g3z3RNqRaa	well try making the name more appealing, like if you have just the Q with no details they don't want to answer, make it sound interesting so that people will look at it at least. try posting with your answers or something. maybe not alot of people have enough experience with what you are asking about for you to get alot of answers|`|AA12004569	I don't answer questions that are way too long, that I think are dumb, or that I have no real answer to. Examples: Suppose some tween with middle school drama gets on and posts a novel about some dweeb guy she likes. Will I answer? Most likely not, seeing as that falls both into the 'too long' and the 'dumb' categories. Or suppose some lady gets on and starts asking questions about cancer. What do I know about cancer? Absolutely nothing. So will I answer? Most likely not.|`|7y7t04Vsaa	Sometimes I try to answer and do my best and when I look back there is five thumbs down on it so I don't try as much anymore.

vuCo9wZZaa	Yep, I know exactly what you are talking about.  I believe it's the 5th episode from this past season "Something Has to Change" and it's the episode right after vegas when Lauren sees Audrina and JB there and it is completely awkward between them and then when they get back in town they have their heart to heart about giving their friendship more attention.|`|ttZuCasbaa	Umm I thinkt hats when then they were fighting about Justin Bobby? It was about like 5 or so episodes ago I think.|`|ku1atlfmaa	i think the episode was called, "You Did This" or the one before that.
PeuFnqQwaa	If it does not sound completely right, then usually a different voicing of the chord is a probability. Try inverting the chord that does not sound correct. If you are playing a 3 note chord, move the highest note in the chord to the opposite side of the root. The three notes of the chord are still the same except you are now playing the highest note one octave lower. This is likely the problem you are experiencing, though its hard to tell cause I don't know what song you are playing. If you have trouble figuring out how to invert the chord. Google piano chord inversions...or even go to  youtube.com  and search piano chord inversions. Hope this helps.<br>  <br>  I know just noticed that its How to save A Life that you are trying to play. Another thing I would recommend is to buy Guitar Pro 5 Software. You can download Guitar pro files for songs and it will show you the Guitar, Bass, Piano etc. The software has a picture of the keyboard and plays the note along with the song so you can see exactly how its played. The guitar pro file for the song you want is available here<br>  <a href="http://www.tabcrawler.com/search.php?show=viewfile&letter=t&artist=the%20fray&tabname=how%20to%20save%20a%20life%20%20tab&tabtype=guitar%20pro&id=80243" rel="nofollow">http://www.tabcrawler.com/search.php?sho...</a><br>  <br>  The software is only $49.

ZRhWkSIiaa	Eloise Hawking is a mysterious character who appears to have accurate knowledge of the future and the workings of time. She does not have total foreknowledge of events, however, as she could not see whether Ben and the Oceanic Six would make it back to the Island; mentioning that if they didn't then "God help us all". She appears to have common interests with Ben, working to help him rediscover the island. She is the mother of Daniel Faraday, who has also studied the workings of time. She was described as a "temporal policeman" by Damon Lindelof. <br>  <br>  Eloise worked at the store where Desmond went to buy an engagement ring for Penny during his first time shift after he turned the failsafe key.<br>  <br>  When she showed him a ring and he told her he would take it, she seemed upset and responded by telling Desmond he would not. After Desmond refused to give the ring back she explained to Desmond that she knows his name, that he will break Penny's heart and he will not marry her, instead entering the sailing race to prove Penny's father wrong, and that he will go to the Island and press the button for three years until forced to turn the failsafe key. She said that if he "doesn't do those things," that "every single one of us is dead." <br>  <br>  As Desmond refused to give the ring back she decided to take a walk with him. While on their walk she drew Desmond's attention to a man wearing a suit and red sneakers, saying it was a "bold fashion choice." As she and Desmond sat on a bench she tried to explain to Desmond that he must not ask Penny to marry him. She said that it was his "path" to go to the Island. At this point in the episode, it could be noticed that Eloise was wearing a pin, an ouroboros; a circular serpent with its tail in its mouth, representing life as a cycle. But this particular one wasn't eating its tail. Then all of a sudden a large crash was heard behind them as the scaffolding from a construction job falls to the ground. As she and Desmond turn around, a pair of legs with red shoes were shown sticking out from under the pile of rubble. As Desmond realized this is the man she pointed out earlier, she admitted to knowing that he would die. When confronted by Desmond as to why she did not warn the man she informed him that he would have been hit by a taxi the next day, and if she had warned him about that he would have broken his neck in the shower. As Desmond stared blankly at her, she explained that the universe has a way of "course correcting" (a phrase Desmond later recites to Charlie), and that death cannot be avoided. Her last words to Desmond were that pressing the button is the only great thing he will ever do in his life. ("Flashes Before Your Eyes")<br>  <br>  She also appeared in a photo on the desk of Brother Campbell. ("Catch-22") <br>  <br>  Three years after the rescue of the Oceanic Six, Eloise worked closely with Benjamin Linus in an attempt to reunite the Oceanic Six and to bring them back to the Island. She worked in a lab, attempting to plot out the next location of an "event" using a giant swinging pendulum (possibly a Foucault pendulum), a chalkboard, and a computer (an Apple III, a model made from 1980 to 1984). After determining the point, she met with Ben, informing him that he had only seventy hours to return to the Island, a goal that Ben insisted he could not meet. Eloise warned him that he had no choice, and that "God help us all" should he fail. ("The Lie")|`|dMBSE8ilaa	She is the woman who Desmond saw in the episode "Flashes Before Your Eyes" is season 3. She seemed psychic and she wouldn't sell Desmond the ring that he wanted for Penny. She also told him to go to the island, that it was his destiny, or something like that. If you want to know more watch more of season 5 before someone spoils it for you!|`|xbwLbzHqaa	Ms. Hawking. She was first seen in the season 3 episode "Flashes Before Your Eyes". The episode centered around what had happened to Desmond after he turned the fail safe key when the hatch went into "system failure".  When Desmond time traveled back to 1996 (pre-island time) after turning the fail safe key, he went to a jewelry store to buy an engagement ring for Penny. Ms. Hawking was working there and when Desmond said he would take the ring she refused to sell it to him because him not buying it in the first place led to his original fate of breaking up with Penny, participating in the sailing race around the world and ending up on the island and ultimately turning to fail safe key. You'll learn much more about her later on in the season. I can't wait until you watch the episodes "This Place is Death" and "316" you'll get more answers on exactly who she is.|`|LBovv7Sxaa	her name is Ms Hawking.<br>  <br>  she was first seen in season 3's episode "Flashes Before Your Eyes" when Desmond first time travelled after turing the Hatch's fail safe key.<br>  Ms Hawking told Desmond that the universe has a way of course correcting itself. and that you can't change the future.<br>  <br>  <br>  don't read the last two answers.<br>  they're GD morons who spoil a LOT!<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  NOOO!!<br>  <br>  SPOILER!!<br>  <br>  NOOO!!<br>  <br>  SPOILER!!<br>  <br>  NOOO!!<br>  <br>  SPOILER!!<br>  NOOO!!<br>  <br>  SPOILER!!<br>  NOOO!!<br>  <br>  SPOILER!!<br>  NOOO!!<br>  <br>  SPOILER!!<br>  <br>  NOOO!!<br>  <br>  SPOILER!!<br>  NOOO!!<br>  <br>  SPOILER!!<br>  <br>  NOOO!!<br>  <br>  SPOILER!|`|AVCSn5EHaa	Daniel Faraday's mother!

xEbotkSMaa	The only reason why I watched this movie is because I heard good reviews, it doesn't have a plot is like short stories in a 2 hour film I think. Directed by many well known directors.

8yE2sYGeaa	Only by half a day|`|7YVon6dsaa	It depends on the time of day. If the mailman won't come to pick it up until the next day it could be better to drop off the movies at the post office. If you find out when the mail carrier comes you could be sure to have it in there on time. However, if the post office is convenient, I bet it would be worth it to drop it off there. Try doing an experiment. Drop it off one day, time the arrival, and then the next time use your mailbox, see if it makes much difference.|`|IGYa2yF6aa	It's possible, but not likely. Your postal carrier has to turn in any collected mail at the end of his/her shift which is usually by mid-afternoon. The all the day's sorted mail from that same post office goes together to the distribution facility that night. Netflix has a remarkably efficient system that gets movies back and forth in a matter of a day or two.|`|TDBnUpvUaa	I'm sure it depends where you live, so you will have to test.  I have found that if I leave them in the mailbox (and my mail is picked up around 4 pm), Netflix gets them the next day.  If I miss the mail, I take them to the main post office which has an 8 pm pickup, and Netflix gets them the next day.  But I live about 15 miles away from a Netflix distribution center, so my location is particularly good.  I can get two movies a week on my one-at-a-time plan.|`|lvIPNDbgaa	Not really, unless you are mailing on Sunday or a holiday. If you are mailing express or something it might matter, but both mail picked up from the mailbox and that put into the "drop here" slot have to go through the same processing.

FeZR63f8aa	It really depends on how popular the band is that's performing.<br>  Lots of the concerts I go to are pretty cheap, at small venues, and have multiple bands, so they aren't mainstream stuff.<br>  At those places, you can find band members roaming around before and after they play, or sitting down chilling somewhere, or working at their own merchandise table.  Sometimes if they aren't too busy you can get a picture with them too.  Like: 1997, Aiden, Greeley Estates, A Skylit Drive, Madina Lake, My American Heart, Farewell To Freeway...<br>  <br>  If it's a big show, like The Killers or Panic at the Disco, you probably won't get any signatures or pictures unless you stalk them to their tour bus, or backstage, or something like that.  The other case would be if there are signing sessions before the show, like Plain White T's.<br>  <br>  I've gotten wiL Francis, Jake Davison, Angel Ibarra, Nick Wiggins, some guys from A Skylit Drive, Alex Torres, Ryan Zimmerman, Telle, Nathan Leone, and a lot of other guys to sign stuff.  (The aforementioned smaller shows.)<br>  The key is to bring something like a notepad, a purse, a piece of clothing (you can buy a shirt or hoodie there if you want), or something like that to get signed.  Have a camera available.  BRING A PERMANENT MARKER just in case, usually they have one, but sometimes they do not.<br>  <br>  Another key thing is to look at pictures of the band members and learn their names.  Being able to identify them anywhere is going to help.  Ryan Zimmerman from Greeley Estates (one of my favorites, tied with wiL) was working at his own merch table and I recognized him, and no one else knew who he was!  I asked for his autograph on a hoodie I bought and later got a picture taken with him.  When you acknowledge them, it may trigger other people getting signatures and pictures too. ;P<br>  <br>  wiL just hopped off the stage after Aiden was done and sat on the edge, chilling and smoking, available for autographs and hugs, just talking to fans.<br>  Guys from A Skylit Drive went to the pool tables and sat on them while people brought up posters they bought for them to pass around and sign.<br>  At places like Warped Tour, there are signing sessions, so I got people like Alex and Telle to sign a notebook.  Guys from Madina Lake come out after the show is done and standing around for pictures and autographs.<br>  Check merch tables!  They are there sometimes!<br>  <br>  I usually bring a small notebook to write the sets in anyway, and I have a camera phone, so I either put that stuff in my pocket or have my sister carry it in her purse (one that has a long strap that goes over your shoulder and zips).  Buying clothes there to get signed might be better than bringing them, and you just either wear the shirt/hoodie or hold on to it.  Sometimes that will fit in a bag.  Make sure if you bring a small bag/purse to have it sealable and practical as to not have stuff break and fall out.<br>  <br>  Sorry about rambling, and good luck meeting some awesome people! xD|`|WHcBV7rLaa	What i do, is usually there will be posters of the band around the venue, and I just take one down off the wall, its super easy and free and no one really cares when you do it, and then then I'll meet the band after and have them sign that.<br>  <br>  And no, you don't always have to have VIP passes to meet them, you can often just wait by the tour bus after, there will be other fans too, and they sometimes come out to talk to fans.|`|oy2KSYpMaa	i assume youre referring to soundwave, they have a signing table.<br>  and the secret is to take a sharpie or two and try to get some maps from the security guards or the first aid attendants, and get the bands to sign them. thats what i did last year.<br>  <br>  or the other option is to take the album inserts from the bands youre going to meet and get the band to sign that. thats what i did when i met cobra starship and panic at the disco.<br>  <br>  the good thing about the maps and the cd inserts is that they fit in pockets really well, and you dont need to take a bag. because bags are a pain in the *** at a concert, especially a festival like soundwave or the big day out.<br>  <br>  try to take as few things as possible, like limit it to youre camera, phone and a small wallet.<br>  <br>  ive been to enough concerts to know that the less you take, the better day you have because you dont have to worry about whos got what because you keep everything on yourself.<br>  <br>  also, try to wear pants that have lots of pockets [like cargo shorts or something] because that way your side pockets dont get jammed full of stuff. velcro or button0up pockets are the best because things generally wont fall out. though you may lose a sharpie.<br>  <br>  good luck.|`|Yi2BtffWaa	Depending where your at, say if its at a big arena huge venue. you have no chance<br>  <br>  maybe a city hall or a small venue like that, go round the back where they have the stage setup vans<br>  <br>  in the festival way go to side cage where there buses are and just scream to get there attention!|`|qSlaOUVqaa	Most of the time, you would have to get VIP/backstage passes to get to the performers.|`|QDhK8IOlaa	yeah, just hang out by the van/bus, or if its a small venue, then you could just wait by the stage

VxKT3l7yaa	Three men check in to a motel. The clerk at the front desk charges them $30 for a single room to share. The men pay $10 each. They men take their room key and head to the room. Then the clerk realizes that he made a mistake and that the room is actually $25. The clerk sends a bellhop to the three men's room to return the $5. The bellhop doesn't know how to split the $5 between three people, so he keeps $2 and gives the remaining $3 to the men.<br>  <br>  So the three men originally paid $30 for the room. Then they each received $1 back which means that they paid $9 each. 9 x 3 = 27. The bellhop kept $2, which makes $29.

8yE2sYGeaa	It is 17 on your own. Some will ask for ID.<br>  <br>  No ID, no ticket|`|AA11400829	They check your ID, if you don't have an ID, you're not getting in. The age limit is 17, someone with you has to be 17 in order to buy the tickets. I used to work at a theater, I've seen people get denied because they didn't have an ID, even though they looked old enough.|`|81sucrAEaa	18|`|nUvdU3b4aa	17<br>  i've gotten into ones before i was 17, since you look the age, they don't usually seem to care to check<br>  i would guess they technically couldn't let you see it if they checked your ID|`|sJNoTGQVaa	if you don't have an ID then you're not going into the movie. Simple as that. And to my understanding, its 17<br>  <br>  and person above me, good job copying and pasting. moron|`|Bx7F9jscaa	You have to be 17 and have ID|`|Swo8Xk1Baa	its 18, and you have to show youre id. if you cnt prove there not gonna let you in. once your a legal adult, you WILL have an id. its not like a i want it or not thing.<br>  <br>  but then again now that i think about it it could be 17. depends what state you live in really. i agree with the person above who said theatre hop. do it all the time. or dont theatre hop, (depends what you think of theatre hop) and just buy tickets to a move thats like pg-13 or something and just go to another one. i saww the uninvited the other day. my friend once went to see walle with her little sister and ended up levaing the kid in there and going to see some other pg-13 rted movie. the funny thing is that the kid neer noticed. lol, goes to show, leave a kid with a bucket of pop corn and everybodys happy. LOL!|`|Zuj07b5saa	you have to be 17 if u want to see it and u have to have an ID to see one at a theatre, but u could always buy a ticket for a pg 13 movie and sneak in, thats really easy to do..not that i would no :D and if u want to see it at home...well that doesnt really matter, i am 13 and i have seen tons of rated R movies.|`|qsjGiaW2aa	17. If you dont have an id that says ur older than that then ur screwed. Your gonna be able to in a year so dont worry. If u have a friend whos 17 or older, let him or her buy u the ticket.|`|JAdNkzENaa	supposed to be 18 but when i was 15 i would lie and say i was 18 and i got in. just do the math first cuz they will ask you what year you were born|`|2tzn6Ad9aa	17 for R rated or else a person 21 years or older has to be with you...and they check your ID, but if you don't have one I guess your screwed? lol i dont know|`|5cJrnaQaaa	where i live it's 18, but no one actually cares here you can get in if you're like 14.|`|JtXuvZLzaa	you have to be 17. I think they assume youd have an ID by then even if its not a drivers license.|`|eMccVmBkaa	then watch it online!!! lolz!|`|ZrzjwbHzaa	An R-rated motion picture, in the view of the Rating Board, contains some adult material. An R-rated motion picture may include adult themes, adult activity, hard language, intense or persistent violence, sexually-oriented nudity, drug abuse or other elements, so that parents are counseled to take this rating very seriously. Children under 17 are not allowed to attend R-rated motion pictures unaccompanied by a parent or adult guardian. Parents are strongly urged to find out more about R-rated motion pictures in determining their suitability for their children. Generally, it is not appropriate for parents to bring their young children with them to R-rated motion pictures.|`|a0EEIpYjaa	Yes, you have to be 18.<br>  They need to verify how<br>  old you are by ID - so like<br>  your health card will do. or<br>  even your birth certificate.<br>  <br>  Best thing to do if you don't<br>  have one is see the movie<br>  with someone who is 18, they<br>  are legally classified as an<br>  adult and you are allowed to see<br>  it with them.|`|ctnqGrVlaa	you have to be 17 years old. I f you have someone 17 or older that can get the tickets for you you can get in, but make sure your not standing next to the person who is buying you the tickets because the cashier may ID you still.|`|lJcbQ00Haa	You have to be 17, but I've only been carded once, by a very old woman...I was 22 at the time. Go to the youngest person at the register, someone who won't care. If they ask to see your ID, either leave or buy a ticket to a PG-13 film and go to your R-rated film.|`|DPI7rcyNaa	Just buy tickets for something g rated and theater hop! me and my friends watched 4 movies in one day.|`|jJI73El2aa	17 years to see it without adult<br>  most make you pull out id...if u dont haf one, they wont sell u ticket

aS0nijbhaa	To DON: You're wrong there. "Du Hasst" means "You hate", but "Du Hast", with one 's', means "You Have".<br>  <br>  As for the meaning of the video, I'm not sure myself. It seems to me like something to do with the Mafia or something similar. He leaves his girl in the car, probably not knowing if he will come back out of the building alive. That also would describe him hiding the gun when everyone takes off their masks, as he didn't realize they would be friendly.<br>  <br>  I haven't seen the video in a while, but if I remember right, doesn't the car explode at the end? I'm not sure what that could mean.|`|PSW19XMhaa	Du hast means "you hate"  so in the song he basically says "you you hate you hate me to say(or maybe stay?) and i did not obey....."<br>  <br>  I'm stoned i don't even know if i answered this properly|`|vlIXsFmhaa	Explane?

JJLjo2QRaa	well, since one tree hill is my absolute favorite show i think i can help!<br>  <br>  at the end of season two, a mysterious note is left for Dan, saying "this is for all you've done." with a bottle of alcohol.  he then drinks the drink, and falls to the floor (the drink has been poisoned) and then the mystery person lights the dealership on fire. Dan is stuck inside on the ground. THEN Haley comes home from her tour, wanting Nathan back.  But he doesn't know what to say to her. then Deb gets a call saying that Dan has been in an accident and they are needed at the dealership.  So Nathan, Haley and Deb all rush to the dealership. It's a really great episode, but the first episode of season 3 is even better! so keep watching :)<br>  hope this could help you lol|`|FBMZ388oaa	I could tell you, but you can just watch it online:  <a href="http://www.thewb.com/shows/one-tree-hill" rel="nofollow">http://www.thewb.com/shows/one-tree-hill</a><br>  <br>  Episode Recap for 2.22 "The Tide that left and never came back"-http://www.onetreehillblog.com/200...<br>  <br>  Episode Recap for 2.23 "The leavers dance"-http://www.onetreehillblog.com/20...

It deals with a sensitive issue in a way that is somewhat more tasteful (by that I mean nothing is shown) than other films have done in the past. The film probably would have done a lot better with critics if the story is was based on wasn't proven to have been fiction after the author have previously called it a biography.

Yes they are redoing the entire anime series (5 April 2009 I believe) for the 20th anniversary, the Jap voice cast is going to do the script again except for the actors who have died since doing dbz (like Tien). <br>  <br>  On a side note, its not really out of character for Vegeta, at this point in the manga/anime Vegeta was making his transition. In other words, he goes from enemy to begrudging ally on Namek, then to willing ally on Earth (androids) and at this point in his life he had started a family though he didn't seem too interested in his family at this point. After Goku's death he had a major turn around and even admits when he was Majin that he loves his family and dies willingly for them. After Buu is defeated he can admit that Goku is stronger, and he involves himself with the z-warriors, thinking of them as friends. The final transition is his involvement with his son, and his acceptance of his much weaker brother - Tarble etc.
25G5MzQeaa	symbols/things - you could use a apple, just like the cover right? <br>  "Stephenie Meyer has stated that the apple on the cover represents the forbidden fruit from the book of Genesis. It symbolizes Bella and Edward's love, which is forbidden, similar to the fruit of the Tree of Knowledge of Good and Evil, as is implied by the quote from Genesis 2:17 that is quoted at the beginning of the book.

P8gGMlbIaa	There are only 3 that I know of. The two mentioned already and the one you have seen.<br>  <br>  I've only seen Seto no Hanayome and 1 of the Mermaid Forest by Rumiko Takahashi. I think there's more to it called Mermaid's Scar and Mermaid's Gaze.<br>  <br>  Rumiko's Mermaid stories are more of a horror story, not hentai. We are talking the creator of Urusei Yatsura, Ranma 1/2 and Inu Yasha here.<br>  <br>  Seto might be more of what you want. As Jermey there says.<br>  <br>  There is a series titled Kenkō Zenrakei Suieibu Umishō. It's not about a mermaid and no real mermaid shows up in it. However the main character Kaname Okiura is swimming team's manager even though he can't swim, he's afraid of swimming because when he was little he thought a mermaid was trying to pull him under. The truth is even more twisted.

4QNdV64Xaa	try yu yu hakusho. i watch it all the time|`|i1IE4Yztaa	It depends on what you're looking for, of course, but:<br>  <br>  Fruits Basket--shoujo manga about a teenage girl who becomes involved with a family that has long lived with a curse: 12 of them are possessed by the 12 animals of the Chinese zodiac.  If one is hugged by a member of the opposite sex, he or she will turn into an animal.  It sounds cutesy, but it get very dramatic and complex as it goes along.  I highly recommend the manga.  The anime is sweet but only covers a small portion of it.<br>  <br>  Death Note--shounen about Light Yagami, a bored high school genius, acquires the Death Note, which enables him to kill a person merely by writing their name in the Note.  The Note comes equipped with a Shinigami (death god) visible only to him.  Light begins a mission to rid the world of evil and become its new god.  Soon, he is immersed in a cat and mouse game with a brilliant detective known as L who is determined to uncover the identity of Japan's new serial killer.  The anime is a little better than the manga, though its very faithful.  I just found the manga a little dry.  The Japanese live-action movies are also very good.  <br>  <br>  Monster--shounen manga, the BEST manga I have ever read and one of my favorite works of fiction in general.  Unlike the above 2, it's not supernatural, and involves a disgraced doctor's quest to find and kill a sociopathic murderer whom he saved as a child.  That's just the beginning, the plot is very complex and engrossing.  Unlike many anime, it takes place in Germany, and the artwork is not at all stereotypical of manga.  The anime is pretty much entirely faithful to the manga and very well-made, though I prefer the manga overall. <br>  <br>  Sorry for the long post.  :)|`|clPvtugSaa	Manga:<br>  Maybe <a href="http://www.mangafox.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.mangafox.com</a> can be your choice.

If you want to find some good mangas to read you can try these sites: onemanga.com, mangafox.com, mangatraders.com. I usually find all good mangas on these sites. But the ones that I personally like are:<br>  <br>  (manga)<br>  voice of love<br>  100% perfect girl<br>  absolute boyfriend<br>  the devil within<br>  hana kimi<br>  hot gimmick<br>  fushigi yuugi<br>  inuyasha (its okie to me)<br>  punch!<br>  sensual phrase<br>  the gentlemen's alliance<br>  chocolat<br>  happy hustle high<br>  yurara<br>  make love and peace<br>  honey x honey drops<br>  viewfinder<br>  tenshi ja nai<br>  and etc...<br>  <br>  (anime)<br>  prince of tennis <br>  inuyasha (its okie)<br>  bleach (its okie)<br>  naruto (its okie)<br>  DN Angel<br>  kaleido star<br>  azumangadaiyo<br>  sprited away (movie)<br>  fruit basket<br>  and etc...<br>  <br>  all of the mangas i listed are mostly smut/romance/mature but they are all good.

Kidneys may be failing?|`|ETcBRko3aa	He was hooked up to dialysis so his kidneys are failing.<br>  <br>  <br>  He could have AIDS because renal failure does happen with AIDS and Carter has been in Africa working in AIDS clinics.|`|4imsjgE2aa	We don't know yet.  What a terrible teaser!|`|ZxBiSsLDaa	Based on what I saw on TV last night and pictures I compared it to online it definitely looks like dialysis. The cause of it is still a mystery! I also think that he's not with Kem anymore... he was very sketchy answering questions about her and also asked about Abby and made a sarcastic remark when Sam or Neela (I can't remember who) said that she was doing well. In addition, if Carter is sick you would think Kem would come with him to Chicago to get his dialysis.|`|Y012fxz3aa	On the preview it said that Carter is back with a secret. All should be revealed. it was definitely a dialysis machine. I'm thinking HIV / AIDS.<br>  That or some other illness? I hope he doesn't die...<br>  He was always one of my favorites, him and Mark.|`|L4xSeRNzaa	i think something leading to kidney failure because it looked like a dialysis machine he was hooked up to.

X1uOh8ylaa	Here's what I was able to find, its taken from an interview that he gave TV Guide in regards to his return to ER:<br>  <br>  As a result of [Carter’s] once near-fatal stabbing, which led to my subsequent drug addiction, I come back from Africa requiring additional medical treatment for my one remaining kidney. I’m embarrassed to get treatment at County General, so I go up to Northwestern to get my dialysis up there, and that’s where Dr. Benton spies my name on a patient list and comes to pay me a visit," Wyle told TV Guide.<br>  <br>  Hmmm, I have a bad feeling on how the series will end.

If you want to watch live TV on your computer, you'll need a tuner card.  If you just want to watch TV on the computer, try the websites for the networks, like abc.com, and sites like hulu.com and fancast.com.|`|jltUA60qaa	o my live tv will be much harder. abc and some networks do this so maybe go to the website of the network you want to watch and see if this works, but if not you going to have to watch it online after it has be aired like the rest of us.

It's dialysis. Maybe he contracted HIV while working in Africa? Would that harm the kidneys?
5ieWhvYCaa	The Hokage has more. The reason orichimaru won't go after the rinnegan is because he is trapped in itachi's sword for eternity. He used a full body chidori. No there is no such thing as jujitsu, there is only genjitsu, ninjitsu, and taijitsu|`|25G5MzQeaa	Who has more power Feudal lord or hokage<br>  Hokage is the highest ranking, follow by 'Kage' (for example, kazekage = gaara), after Kage is Sainin, and after Sainin is Anbu and after Anbu is Jounin, Chounin, Genin, Academy Students. In naruto (not the shippuden), naruto and friends is Genin. Kakashi is Jounin. Konohamaru is Academy Students. Jiraiya, Orochimaru, and Tsunade (later hokage) is Sainin. <br>  <br>  Why wont orochimaru go after the rinnegan<br>  Maybe he doesn't know there is this blood limit existence. Rinnegan is very very rare and not every people knows that. <br>  <br>  What is the name of the jutsu where sasuke use chidori but points it at these dummies and there are sliced<br>  Er... Chidori Katana? Katana chidori? I forgot..... <br>  <br>  Is there a such thing as kinjutsu<br>  No. There is only Ninjutsu, Taijutsu and Genjutsu. <br>  Ninjutsu is the usual ninja jutsu. Naruto is a ninjutsu user. <br>  Taijutsu is just like usual fighting, close range fighting using your body parts. Just like takwondo, judo, boxing but in a ninja way. Rock Lee (Fuzzy Eye Brow) is a pure Taijutsu user, and Neji also uses it sometimes.<br>  Genjutsu is basically jutsu that creates illusion. The user makes the opponents feel or see something unusual, scary, or they might also making them suffer mentally. Kurenai is a genjutsu user, also itachi, he creates many sorts of illusion with his eyes. <br>  <br>  Hope this helped. =) thanks|`|VLRkJOOuaa	Orochimaru has died. And his original plan in life was to know every jutsu known to mankind (or ninjas, rather).<br>  <br>   The powers of the rinnegan is unknown, though it's power seems immeasurable and incalculable. The sharingan, however, is fully known of its capabilities. Orochimaru wanted it specifically due to the fact that it allows the user to acquire any jutsu perfectly with little effort (as long as it isn't a kekkei genkai).<br>  <br>  This site may help with your jutsu problem:<br>  <a href="http://www.narutobase.net/Naruto-Jutsus/cat/sasuke/55.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.narutobase.net/Naruto-Jutsus/...</a><br>  <br>  Yes. Kinjutsu is the forbidden techniques that ninjas have banned; thus, unable to practice in the ninja arts (unless, of course, illegally).<br>  <br>  [[edit]]<br>  The Hokage has more power. The Feudal Lord isn't mentioned much.|`|9KsDS6z6aa	Hokage; there are many feudal lords who serve as advisors to the Kage of their country. Hokage has two feudal lords.<br>  <br>  Many people believed that the Rinnegan doesn't exist, so Orochimaru went after the Sharingan, which is actually known to exist.<br>  <br>  Umm, not exactly sure. Have an episode?<br>  <br>  Not that I know of, and I'm on the current manga. There's three types of jutsus; genjutsu (mind tricks), taijutsu (hand-to-hand combat), and ninjutsu (ninja abilities).|`|SoV53OK2aa	Hokage<br>  <br>  ...he's stupid and deranged.

13457dacb9bf0df7c0fab812fb1590c6aa	After a lot of maths(2 minutes and not done by me),I can tell you that Shippuuden will catch up with Manga probably in 2 years,but because of the new episodes that aren't in Manga, like the ones that are now(Shipp 97) maybe in 2,5 years(if they will add two new ideas that aren't in Manga).<br>  <br>  So, for short probably 2011 to 2012.<br>  <br>  Hope it helped!|`|ZZR9OTzVaa	I doubt it will ever catch up.  It takes a lot longer to produce an anime than it does manga.  The anime will always be far behind the manga.|`|6PSnZDhDaa	the anime is 90 chapters behind... which means atleast 60-70+ episodes till they catch up to where the manga is today.... usually the fillers last about 20 episodes atleast... so am guessing atleast 2 or 3 more months till they get on with the story...|`|KSC02NcLaa	End of Next Year, Maybe Spring 2011.

This just goes to show that all these competition shows are rigged and planned out.

yqe0I5zpaa	Personally, i thought the 2000 Academy Awards were the best of the last 9 years, i mean the nominees this year are great, as were the last couple of years but 2000 was a great year for movies and it was Billy Crystal hosting the Oscars, he is the best host they have ever had. Best Picture noms were great, American Beauty won and the other nominees were The Cider House Rules, The Sixth Sense, The Green Mile and The Insider, all of these movies are pretty well-known for any movie-goer. Also Denzel, Sean Penn, Russel Crowe, Kevin Spacey (won* Best Actor) Micheal Clarke Duncan, Micheal Caine (won* Best Supporting Actor) Haley Joel Osmant, Tom Cruise, Jude Law, Hilary Swank (won* Best Actress) Julliane Moore, Meryl Streep, Angelina Jolie (won* Best Supporting Actress) Toni Collete and Catherine Keener are all iconic actors who were nominated all in the same year. Also Sam Mendes (American Beauty, Jarhead, Road To Perdition, Revolutionary Road, won Best Director for American Beauty) Spike Jonez (BoyZ In The Hood, Miracle At Saint Anna, She Hate Me) Micheal Mann (Heat, etc.) all also all great directors who were nominated in the catergory. It was also the year that South Park, Bigger, Longer and Uncut was nominated for an Oscar. Also The Matrix got all the Best Visual Effects awards etc. It was a great year for the Oscars. Honestly, i'm hoping this year can be as great as the 2000 Awards. Although, i must admit, seeing Martin Scorsese FINALLY, FINALLY, FINALLY win Best Director (an Award, he should have won 3 or 4 times before) was pretty great. I was so joyful seeing DiCaprio, Nicholson and Walhberg hugging him, they know, they were directed by the legend and to see him FINALLY, FINALLY win was pretty powerful.|`|8yE2sYGeaa	The one where Return of the King swept the awards|`|AwBVoWOaaa	The 2007 ceremony, in which THE DEPARTED took the Best Picture prize.<br>  <br>  Only because Martin Scorsese finally got his Oscar. <br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbbzaS8rcak" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbbzaS8rc...</a>|`|7zoRxC49aa	i dont watch dem lol<br>  <br>  answer mine xD

uRSUeFQ9aa	Firstly I wouldn't say this is a stellium because the planets are not close enough together.  Besides, most astrologers contend that a stellium consists of 4 or more planets in one sign or house.  <br>  <br>  Pluto rules scorpio, and in your chart it trines jupiter and sextiles neptune.  Likely, this means you shouldn't have to worry too much about your finances.  Pluto trining jupiter with pluto ruling the 2nd house of finances should mean being financially well-off.  Your only damper.........saturn is itself in the 2nd house.  So, it tends to restrict this "wealth" aspect.  You may find that you come into money later in life from hard work and dedication (say, around age 31 or possibly later).  You must learn responsibilities with money in order to see the fruits of the jupiter/pluto connection.  <br>  <br>  Having uranus and mars (conjunct) in the 2nd as well might mean you are a big time splurger who couldn't save a penny if your life depended on it.  If this is true, then again, saturn is calling, telling you to be more cautious and to plan ahead more (not to mention saturn is squaring jupiter at that).<br>  <br>  As for your career, find a vocation where you can take charge and be a leader.  Your individuality could lead to authorative positions in the workplace.

di43MlSFaa	It sounds like Coldplay, possibly Radiohead somewhat, but I can't find anything. There's another group called Kutless that is a hard rock Christian band, but I don't think it's them either.  Red did a song called Breathe into me, but it doesn't match up.<br>  <br>  I listened to the clip repeatedly. The lyric sounds like...saved your life you saved.....(something..???). <br>  Tried looking up those lyrics and came up with everything but...<br>  I visited the site of the person who made the clip. He does editing etc. The clip itself is put together from Afro Samurai Resurrection, but the music is not. The clip editor states he's mostly into some R&B but mostly hard rock. <br>  <br>  There's a hard rock group, Masterplan, which after listening to several of their pieces on youtube might possibly be the group, just having difficulty putting the words from the clip to the songs.<br>  Oasis also seems to sound familiar....This is frustrating to say the least....lol...<br>  <br>  I'm intrigued, and will keep searching this out but if you do find out what the song is, I hope you will post it here in your question!<br>  <br>  Here's a thought....I don't know much about video/pc games, but might it be possible the music is a musical theme of some sort to a game...???...<br>  As you can see, I'm very intrigued by this question...and still searching....<br>  <br>  LOL....The fellow who made this video clip should get an award for best puzzle creator. <br>  I've been listening and listening to the clip again. Keep going back and listening to the group Kutless, sounds very much like them.....Perhaps Muse...???....Or perhaps an edit of two or three songs, put together to make one piece....<br>  I am stumped....|`|0lQtTE9Daa	shredding the rust?|`|ty6xmeHeaa	I think it's called Naked Aggression - Stay Away<br>  <br>  I have been looking for an hour and a half and came up with nothing.

Z13CWyNGaa	I got to agree with what sr13 suggest about having a second vocalist handle the "once again" parts, in fact while I was reading thats how it sounded in my head. I don't what kind of genre youre going for, but if it were metal, sing the she did this parts and scream/grunt the once agains. It could be a good song I like it.|`|khZYlwY6aa	sounds like a good song. but i dont suggest putting it on here. people might steal it.|`|14sTdBPaaa	pretty good song, different from what i've read...|`|PQDNq1cUaa	IT IS AWESOME|`|ea1ed505e3c0a89111a6fcd5e18dd1a8aa	It sounds OK. The verses are better than the chorus as the once again is a little repetitive. If you keep it that way then I suggest you have one person sing the first line and hold the note as another speaks once again over the top. This way it will sound as though an inner voice is sounding fed up rather than you not being able to think of words that rhyme.

M7E1uIsKaa	Dark Side of the Moon was the first one I thought of.<br>  <br>  also:<br>  Rush - Moving Pictures<br>  GnR - Appetite for Destruction<br>  Pantera - Vulgar Display of Power|`|000db28fb52ab31dee59ac037328db75aa	Kraftwerk′s "Trans Europe Express" (1977)<br>  <br>  Up to that time, it was without a doubt Kraftwerk′s most impressive LP, being rounded with a consistency of purpose and littered with memorable tunes. TEE avoided the impression of "Autobahn" and its predecessors, wich could be considered as LPs with a central piece of music surrounded by rather superfluous extra tracks. Nor was it weighed down by the sometimes almost unwarranted avant-garde noises of "Radio-Activity". The LP has a complete cohesion, the vocal lines are clear and decisive, the melodies simple and catchy.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gDKiPtBbBQY" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gDKiPtBbB...</a>|`|bO9p8Kxdaa	My favorite classical album is the StarWars soundtrack from the original (1st) movie.

I love the quote Wayne Coyne said that the instrument he would want to be more than any other is "The production studio".|`|5uvTte8Zaa	Killers=Iron Maiden 1981<br>  Ride The Lighting=Metallica  1984<br>  Boston=Boston 1976?|`|UFE7BJHBaa	"Rubber Soul" -beatles<br>  "CCR Live In Europe" - ccr<br>  " A Quick One While He's Away '' - the who<br>  "Crimson & Clover '' - tommy james & the shondells<br>  "Get Your Ya-Ya's out'' - rolling stones|`|Ih1YIe65aa	who killed harry houdini?- i'm from barcelona<br>  ok computer- radiohead<br>  (i would say anything robert schneider or nigel godrich get their hands on)<br>  talkie walkie- AIR<br>  black foliage: animation music- the olivia tremor control<br>  dusk at cubist castle- the olivia tremor control<br>  discovery- daft punk<br>  no flashlight- mount eerie (good as a lo-fi production album)<br>  hissing fauna, are you the destroyer?- of montreal<br>  hunky dory- david bowie<br>  kid a- radiohead<br>  ()- sigur ros<br>  ga ga ga ga ga- spoon<br>  come on feel the illinoise- sufjan stevens<br>  yankee hotel foxtrot- wilco<br>  beast moans- swan lake|`|T52vXXBJaa	Dark Side of the Moon was immediately the first album that came to mind, but apparently this has already been covered.

VLsSuWD4aa	It is so crazy. Now everyone will look at Taurus in a negative way :[. Anyways Chris Brown has a Leo rising, his Mars is in Cancer so I have no Idea where he had the anger to hurt her. Rihanna is a Pisces with an Aries moon, I also do not know why she didnt just slap him across the face. Im a Taurus with Mars in Aries he can try me and I'll show him not to ever put his hands on a woman.|`|gSUU3Tk3aa	He is a little boy that can't handle the real world. He tells an apology like it's okay. If I was Rihanna, I would stand up for black women being abused and slapped the f**k out of that b**ch ! I wanna see the pictures but I'm on PSP internet which is crap like Chris! Chris Brown slapping a fellow Pisces?  Oh hell no ! Ima slap the f**k out of that kid!!!|`|BlZ6vJOAaa	I'm a Taurus sun and Moon. i'm not really aggressive. I've only ever hit my little brother and sis. but not hurt them too bad.<br>  i dunno, Maybe he's a Scorpio venus lol.|`|ewOD5x0taa	I really don't think astrology has anything to do with it.|`|H7zl1XeFaa	dead horse<br>  <br>  <a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;_ylt=Aox5DS7jhYM_IA5EEMKzSkzty6IX;_ylv=3?qid=20090215200121AADz6Yg&show=7#profile-info-F9bzd5mwaa">http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;...</a>|`|nxHjSKTTaa	You know I dated very briefly a Taurus he was easily angered and agitated. However he was also on HGH (humane growth hormone) he had is surgically implanted.  I always wondered if his anger issues where from that (HGH) or his sign. <br>  However, I also worked for a Taurus at the same time and he was very mild mannered, the total opposite of the guy I was just telling you about. So I don't know. <br>  It's awful what happen to this poor girl. He's ruined.|`|ythN9BQgaa	I didn't expect Chris Brown to do it... Not because he seems like an innocent little singer... but because on Tyra he specifically said that his mother got beaten up when he was younger, and he wouldn't EVER want to put a woman through that. Ha!<br>  <br>  But yes, I would expect a Taurus with Taurus moon to lose their temper. They can get violent when angry. I wonder what she did to get him so mad! I have had a lot of Taurus friends, and they all got violent when they lost their temper! No surprise here

GdBUmFFCaa	-When a person wets the bed is because a problem is behind it.

I would be fine with it. I mean its something you can't help. So what, their bladder is just not done developing yet. And people who laugh or make fun of them, are rude and aren't really their friend.|`|g3z3RNqRaa	i wouldn't really care, i would be a little weirded out that they told me but i wouldn't be mean about it|`|7y7t04Vsaa	I would think they are very weird because I am 32 years old!

If you were really a friend you wouldn't laugh.|`|mBXu5G5saa	i would be embarrassed for them and stay away too|`|UgZq1pXjaa	OMG!! I can not believe some of your answers.  You are supposed to be a friend to this person and you would laugh and make fun just because they wet the bed.  I was a bed wetter past the age of 15 and wore disposable diapers to bed every night until I was dry.  I had 5 great friends that knew I wet the bed and was in diapers nightly and they did not care one bit.  They did not laugh or make fun of me, they were TRUE FRIENDS.  <br>  Most of you who said you would laugh and make fun of are not true friends and one of these days, when the time comes and you need help from someone who are you going to call.  Yep the person that wore diapers to bed because they had a problem and you turned on them.  See what kind of help you would get from them, probably not a lot.  A true friend would not care, would invite them over to sleepovers and be a TRUE FRIEND.|`|ITSYwRTgaa	its for kids or really drunk people|`|wKjFn7Nsaa	ewww|`|WW5Xp6ofaa	No my best friend and cousin back in the day, they both wet the bed till like 4th grade.

VLRkJOOuaa	Well, the anime has already created a lot of events on their own, and haven't followed the manga since the first episode, so I wouldn't find it astounding if they really are making another season.<br>  <br>  Personally, I like the manga more, but I don't exactly hate the anime. I thought the artwork in the anime (and manga) was amazing. And they definitely captured the characters' personalities well in the anime.<br>  <br>  <br>  I think you're getting confused with the fact that they're airing an OVA pretty soon though. There's a definite difference between another whole season and just an OVA. I'm looking forward to it, actually.

Vulgar Display of Power and Far Beyond Driven were groundbreaking albums.  I remember when Vulgar and Driven came out, and every Metalhead I knew immediately bought both of them.  No band sounded like Pantera at that time -- Phils vocals and Dime's guitar playing were unique.  <br>  <br>  Far Beyond Driven came out in 1994, right in the middle of the Grunge period; and it was like a breath of fresh Metal air to us at that time.  We were all listening to Metallica and Megadeth at that time.  I was a junior in High School in 1994, and nothing sounded like Driven at that time.<br>  <br>  I hear Pantera's style in many modern Metal bands, which goes to show how much influence they had on Metal in general.

No matter what any of those losers say it doesn't matter it's just proving that they only wish they could play half as good as Dime. Even if someone doesn't like a certain band or artist I don't see how anyone could say something so disrespectful about someone who has passed away <br>  <br>  By the way-Dimebag is THE GREATEST guitarist who has or will ever walk the earth|`|UnsZKr4saa	Ehh...I don't really care about what people say on Youtube anymore.  There's absolutely no censorship there.  It's now pretty much a breeding ground for people to rant about whatever they want.<br>  <br>  He's probably just trolling, anyway.
ab2a840460fbbeb0af2b8c4445d4667baa	ashley is pretty but dumb as a stump|`|fab4d863aae6c11ee1163077586edcdaaa	Yep ... but she'll excuse him like she always does.<br>  <br>  First, she might act a little mad.  She MIGHT swallow her pride long enough to tell Jack that he was right ... or she might not.  She'll go off to sulk for a while.  IF Moneybags doesn't get to her first and convince her that it's all for the Greater Good.<br>  <br>  In another year or so, it'll all be forgotten ... that's Ash for you!|`|O0b9Kiosaa	I hope so too, but she has her head so far up his butt, she'll look past his deception.  I wish there was way for the writers to write in that it was Brad's sperm that Ashley took instead of Victor's.  Soon he will manipulate Abby and crush her world.|`|jCHcjJ9Baa	She will eventually find out.  They will break up and he and Nikki will get back together.|`|df7eb800ff0d3d2aec218aae79b6f9cfaa	Victor always seems to use Ashley.|`|IEZoHcysaa	She'll find out.|`|uUzbqGh5aa	With this never ending fued between Victor and her family, she'll get tired of his underhandedness and give him a good piece of her mind and mouth.|`|tEqcmCv3aa	Of course she will, but she will justify it. I fully expect Victor to use Ashley to get back at Jack, and then dump her and go running back to Nikki. Ashley falls for it everytime. Victor just steam rolls right over her to get his way.
v1hCymAEaa	I like them all but I like Bleach better. It's storyline seems to interest me more and although it is a long anime/manga it is still worth watching/reading. I also really like all the characters in Bleach with the exception of two, but in One Piece there are a lot of characters I dont like, along a few in Death Note. Plus I see the characters in Bleach easier to relate to.<br>  <br>  :-P|`|o6K4Dr5Daa	Death note...|`|SLBb7uWgaa	ha ha..My first choice it would be naruto of course, but since it wasn't there, I prefer Death note. <br>  You can't predict what will happen next. Even though there's not much action, but still interesting. It measures your intellectual ability.<br>  Thanks for asking...|`|2ogFk4Amaa	So very tough! They are all different, I would say One Piece.|`|X3dtdrLkaa	Hello :P<br>  <br>  Me LOVE bleach :D<br>  <br>  i liked death note too.. but not as much as i liked it before L died ,, it was much better with him around :P<br>  <br>  Bleach and a MILLION TIMES BLEACH :P<br>  <br>  <br>  Bye :P|`|KXispLytaa	No contest: Death Note.|`|25G5MzQeaa	Death note.

xYTagSIyaa	The note <br>   I wish you would have believed me.  JL<br>  <br>  It was a note to teach Jack faith.  John had enough faith to be chosen by Jacob.  To die to get the others back to the island.  To go home to bring the others back when he didn't want to go back.  <br>  <br>  John arranged with the powers that be for Jack to have to give him one of his fathers items as an act of faith.<br>  <br>  John arranged the note to be read as a signal that it was time for the plane to crash.<br>  <br>  As soon as Jack read the note they were waking up back on the island.<br>  <br>  It is all a ploy to get Jack to have some faith.  I believe Jack's father tried to get Jack to have faith in the shows beginning as well.  Since Jacks father is playing the role of Jacob, he lead John to try and work all this to get Jack to have faith.|`|4imsjgE2aa	That was it.  Just addressed to Jack and signed J.L.<br>  <br>  Pretty simple, to the point note.<br>  <br>  I just skipped through the episode and at 39.20, the note did say "I wish you believe'd in me".|`|VvKJUCYgaa	The answer has already been said <br>  *points to answer above mine*<br>  There's not much to elaborate on ... Just that thinking back I understand what Locke is trying to say, because of the button and everything that happened that Jack thought that Locke was a crazy old man and how they parted in the fourth season and stuff. And that Locke was right and wished that Jack had believed in him.|`|31CDyuggaa	nope that was all it said.  i think it means that jack should have listened to john when he said not to leave the island b/c it only put everyone else in danger and caused john's death (altho i don't think he's actually dead, like once he gets back to the island that he'll be alive again somehow...)  so yeah, it was kind of like a "see what you did?" kinda thing.  hope this answers your question!|`|LBovv7Sxaa	Jack<br>  <br>  I wish you would have believed me.<br>  <br>  JL<br>  <br>  <br>  he wants Jack to feel like it was his fault.<br>  or i dunno.<br>  we'll have to wait until next week.<br>  but it seemed like the island wouldn't let them return until he read the letter.|`|q59m8G9uaa	Jack,<br>  <br>  I wish you had believed me.<br>  <br>  JL<br>  <br>  I think it was just to show how Jack i going to be in for one hell of a shock when he sees what's been happening on the island.<br>  <br>  I hope this helps  :-)

gQEtEtLQaa	I agree - Castiel has been gone for a-g-e-s!!!! Way too long in my opinion!!  He'll definitely be back at some stage though - he's become a really important character in Season 4.  The next episode - 'Death Takes A Holiday' isn't due to air until 5 March though and I can't find a cast list for it so I don't even know if our beloved Cas will be in that episode!!  <br>  <br>  But he's got to come back because (a) he's really heavily involved with Dean's mission which I guess Dean has been a bit distracted from with all that tension between him and Sam so Castiel needs to  get him back on track and (b) as you said, we need to see his character develop a bit further because there's still a lot of mystery attached to Castiel. Oh and (c) he's gorgeous ; )<br>  <br>  EDIT:<br>  <br>  ******SPOILER*******<br>  I've just found out that Castiel WILL be in the next episode - 'Death Takes A Holiday' and apparently so will Anna........|`|u2EUom6daa	yeah i would like to see a bit more of Castiel i think he is a good addition to the supernatural guys but i don't like how he told Dean that if he doesn't stop Sam then they would have to...<br>  i thought Castiel would of been in the show more, but we haven't seen him in a while.|`|loqsl5xXaa	would be nice.. i love the show so as long as they dont cancel it or do something totally stupid with it.. i dont care what happens, lol..|`|VNum3TKyaa	Yes I would love to see him again come back Castiel we miss you.... Will somebody please give the man a chap stick I guess the air is really dry up there in heaven.|`|1hS27eJuaa	He will be back next month. The show it self has been gone far to long I need a supernatural fix, damn breaks.|`|lxrQyQ5raa	Yes, he will be back. They won't just drop a plot that they are trying to follow. I wouldn't worry about that.  It will all come together.  Notice Ruby hasn't been on a few episodes either.  I think they are just throwing in extras on more of what Dean went through in hell and what Sam was up to while Dean was in hell.  They have to follow through with that to so they have to mix it up and make sure they are filling in the blanks.  But it will all eventually come together.  It always does.|`|zovrJ0yXaa	i'd like to see him back soon. but i think they just need to do a couple of monster of the week stories to pad out the season. and to be honest, ive really enjoyed the last couple of episodes. the stripper episode especially was well written and brings that conflict between the brothers to the fore|`|wsCBo2Zkaa	I like Casteil but i don't think i'm as far as you are with the new eps yet!!!

I follow rules and orders very strictly and i see people who have been punished physically by their parents, and usually they're not as adept to following the rules thoroughly without strict demands. In this case words are stronger than actions and set your personality and the way you handle things straight.

Oh..I got spanked too..not beat..spanked..I have never thought it was ok to hit another person other than to discipline my own children..I was a respectable child and I am a respectable adult.

I was born into a family that thought that it was most important to follow the traditional, carrying on of the family name. I suffered, for not being a son. I have talked to both my parents, as an adult and they have both confirmed my "fault","blame". I reached {when it was happening} out to proper authorities, school that I attened, and such..... no protection resulted from my"tattle-telling" and I suffered worse. At sixteen I had cancerous cell growth from contracting HPV.... sexually at a younger age from unknown source. Rumored that HPV takes four years or so before getting to the point of pre-cambrian cancerous cells. I was told that I couldn't have children after my lazer surgury so when I was pregnat at nineteen, it was a beautiful experiance. My mom kicked me out, on the street. I dropped out of high school not long before or after. <br>              So, I was homeless, jobless, pregnant, under educated, young. The father of the child was a friend of mine. At the time it could have been one out of three people. One being a diabetic, so low sperm count an less of a chance. High school friend an I had been intimate twice so that was low chance also. The third was married an had a child already. He would call my mother's home and him an I would meet every weekend or every other weekend. Highly likely the father. <br>         Nobody took credit for our creation, our special child. So, I was alone. I turned to the system an was gave very little money like just little under $200.00 an 13 foodstamps. I believe it was like $179.00. Oh and I recieved medical but I was told I was high-risk and so was told to go to the hospital when I went into labor. Meaning no prenatal care. I was scared, I was also told by two hospitals UCDMC and in Pynren medical care center that my unborn child would be born with health problems. How was I going to take care of my child, was the question asked by the ultrasound personel.<br>          May 1990 a beautiful baby was born. He was born at UCDMC with no complications, healthy and physically healthy. A year later, ten days after I recieved my GED, my second son was born. Labor was induced because I was in my tenth month, my first child was born with no pain, no injections an less than half an hour. I didn't want my second child, I didn't want the responsibility. I felt forced to take on that resposibility an well. The price for spreading my legs was dearly a price I had to pay. <br>            I favored one over the other an was told that I would get over that. As they grew older and with my mom living nearby, my mother tried to control our situation. Saying that I couldn't make it without her.<br>         Her favorate saying while I was growing up was, "I gave you life, I can take it away just like that if you don't do what I say". I had actual hate for that woman. She had whined to police officers saying that she was a grandmother and she deserved rights to see her grandchildren, when I tried to stop the control she had over us. Police look her side, not knowing the entire situation. At one point, she even told the police that I was a stranger, not her daughter, that was trying to take her grandchildren away. <br>           My children at age three were asking about sex an questions that were not their words but sounding more like my mothers influnce she had on them. I became abusive. My mother had achived her goal, saying as I was a teenager that I would never be an appropiate mother because I was a whore.<br>          I would "punish" my children by unnessary spankings. If they didn't do as what was expected. If the didn't like it and talked back I would slap their face an tell them to knock their crap off. Ironic, my first child was "punished" more than the second. Though the second wasn't forgotten, he recieved his punishment also. I realized the pattren and moved with my children to a farther location from my mother. My mom and Aunt told me that I was not allowed to move and that if I did that I would be dead in three months. <br>           The community I moved into was nearly an all black neightborhood. My parents were scared to go there and visits were seldom. It was beautiful. I started to put my children in school an move on toward a better lifestyle. I was told by the school that I couldn't enroll my children unless..... my parents name and adress were included in the enrollment forms. That they had to be listed as emergancy pick-up people for my children in case something happened to me. Giving my mother the okay for her to show up at the school and pick them up as she seen fit.<br>            My mother would contact us often, everyday if I didn't call I was questioned about why.... everytime. I had to tell her what days I did what and my appointments an such. When I didn't, she would say she tried to call and where was I. <br>           She wanted to control our life. The more interferance from her in our life, the more abusive I would become. I tried breaking my pattren, tried breaking away from her. Her control sick mind, put me into a depression. Then, when Elizabeth moved in.... nearby. Just some unknown lady. I was being reported for trying to kill myself multiple times. I didn't like Elizabeth, an refused to let her in my apartment and would be accused of trying to commit suicide. Police would show up and I was cooking dinner, I would say... hey my cooking isn't that bad. Jokingly with them so that it lightened the situation. I would be tooken into the mental center for evaluation and well, if your a poor person.... mental center is like scary the first few times. I should have been put into a jail cell for false report, oh but wait I didn't report a false accusation. <br>              My children would spend unknown amounts of time at my mothers in her care. My mother has been long gone for the past almost ten years. I had moved toward the foothills, closer to where I was born. Closer to my father. Now my father has already decided that I was dead many years ago. I guess we get along better that way. I have the feeling that I meant nothing to him, growing up though we did allot of boyish things before my half-brother was born. After he was born I was ..... well ..... actually fucked by my father an told allot of damaging bullshit. I was twelve years old.... by that time being fucked didn't mean much though, just unexpected behavior. It didn't mean much because other people had stole my virginity before I knew what virginity was.... I was seven when that had happened.<br>            Anyway..... I had stuck to spankings an started using exercise as a punishment/discipline. Oh, I didn't say give me fifty an hit the ground now. My kids were "video game cream puffs". We now lived in a small town that has hills that are well extreemly steep. I would walk my kids butts off.... we didn't have a car in Sacramento or in the town we lived in. The kids use to complain about that small hill near Target, on Broadway in the downtown area.... I would too, but keping in mind of the hills I use to enjoy as a child. I would tell my children it could be worse, back then. <br>         Well, my first son is now going to be nineteen, has a place of his own with his girlfriend. We talk often an I try not to butt in. They have been where they are, near his court appointed father, near the ocean, since little after Christmas. I haven't had the chance to visit yet. <br>         My second son is a cadet for a local fire department. Yes, he has saved a persons life. He was sixteen at the time. I am proud of his actions. He isn't perfect but pretty damn close to it.<br>         My husband and I are raising our third child. She will be starting Kindergarden soon. I am so excited because she has never had a babysitter and I get a break from.... well we all get a break. I am sure she is tired of dealing with mom. School isn't a babysitter, teachers are an education source. Their sources are limited so, so is their educational materials and systematic values. <br>          Stress, under pressure can equal up to punishment.. People are held responsible for their own actions. As it stands at present, I rarely spank our daughter and when applying a discipline I tend to think more often before I act upon a situation. Not because I am lazy an effortless but because I look at the entire situation and analize the root of why she is now in trouble. I seem to question my fault or my blame before judging her. <br>          She is now going through a growing spirt.... spilling milk often... twice today. Once during a playtime/snack. I didn't scold just cleaned it up and thought about it. My husband yelled at her during dinner when she had spilt milk a second time. He yelled saying that is all you get you don't need to spill your milk.... blah blah blah...... So our daughter walked away from the table upset. Trying to open the frige, my husband became upset and started yelling at her to Stop,! stop! an so I questioned what was happening. He angerly explained that she was trying to open the frige.... she explained she wanted juice. He explained that she spilt it.... I told him maybe the spill was an accident and then I asked my husband if it was okay if she could have some juice. He said yeah that he would have to make it.... of course our daughter wants to help. So before Dad can react I said hey that is a great idea co-operation, together.... <br>          When I go to explain the groth spirt I have to prove what I am saying or this first time father isn't going to listen to me..... we have marriage problems but who doesn't. <br>  ~~~~ Thank you for allowing me to share~~~~|`|SS5py9jIaa	It's been a very very long time since I spanked children. My 21 year old (eldest) got left footed and all out of shape on his mother so I stepped in, reminded him that he is now a man and that he needs to show the respect due to my wife or I will sort him out the old fashioned way, just as I would any other smart azz. (He's big but I still got a 40 pound advantage) He must have seen in my face that I meant what I said. I think if you always say what you mean and do what you say, children understand you better. It's when you have built up a relationship where you bluff to get your way, that children put you to the test.<br>  <br>  Now my daughter is a different problem. Raise an eyebrow at her and she brings on the crocodile tears and tries to manipulate me... lol. I just laugh.<br>  <br>  Dont get me wrong cause we got our problems, but you gotta work out what form of pursuasion works for each kid. They're all individuals.<br>  <br>  On the question of violent responses, young children learn quickly from a little spank and I think it is appropriate. As kids get older the become more defiant and spanking is pretty useless in those circumstances. The best trick I ever did was when my middle son would not give up bighting... he would leave huge welts on people.. so one day I bit him.... and he was cured forever. <br>  <br>  Aside from the two years in prison he has been a model child. (jk)|`|AA11577856	I know you said for parents, but it's not a bad thing to get a kids view, also. Hitting can be vage. Hitting any child with a fist, blunt, or sharp object is( in my opion) abuse which is against the law. Abuse is wrong<br>  However I am not against spanking a child or threating to use a belt, that is how my parents raised me. They never over did it for say leaving the light on, that's just a lecture but the basic lying hitting your best friend/neighbor(only child) called for an open hand across the butt.<br>  And my parents would always count to 5 If I still did listen it was a spanking  they still count and it works it's just different consequnces like taking away computer or iPod or tv or phone usages<br>  <br>  <br>  Well I hope I was helpfull from a different view =)

G8jYlPqSaa	Hi there.<br>  <br>  Well, I feel that the "night" falling everywhere is where dark times are ahead for many countries -maybe due to the economic crisis and the many wars going on. <br>  <br>  Rockets at the fun  fairs can be given how lightly we take on the subject of nuclear weapons. Im sure Satan loves a bomb scare is the way political leaders around the world love to scare their people with terrorist threats all the time.<br>   <br>  <br>  If you need more points check out this link, its comments may help you out,thats how I refined some of my meanings: <a href="http://www.songmeanings.net/songs/view/3530822107858758140/" rel="nofollow">http://www.songmeanings.net/songs/view/3...</a><br>  <br>  Hope your project goes well!!<br>  <br>  Just curious-Is this for your music class or something?

BOYCOTT CHRIS & pray for RiRi|`|EblQojpEaa	Ya Im pretty sure its her. TMZ is shady but I dont think they would post it if it wasn't for real. Her face is messed up. Exactly as first described.<br>  <br>  I can't believe that a girl like her(beautiful/famous) can still get her behind beat by a man. I mean really.... Makes you think about domestic abuse in your own life, friends/family. That you might not know about.<br>  <br>  I think it's messed up in a way that they posted that photo cause god knows that girl probably just wants privacy and for people to forget about it, it has to be embarrassing on some level even if you have nothing to be embarrassed about. <br>  On the other hand, I think it's important that the photo has been shown, not to dispute who is guilty for what and why, but for the young girls of today to see that Domestic Abuse is real and this is what it looks like, it makes no exceptions to your status, it could happen to anyone and I hope the media starts giving advice to girls in these types of situations.<br>  <br>  What I think about the two of them, He is so wrong for this on so many levels. I think he should be criminally punished, I dont think under any circumstances men should hit women or vise versa. The whole thing is a shame.|`|LANeKStMaa	si btw it meanz yes i do KNOW that was really her they even made it look like her cuz it is her.<br>  so so so so so so so so so so so so so so SAD i hope chris brown dies! rihanna is pretty but she needz to decrese her forehead its huge well not as huge as Selena Gomez|`|do8pdlluaa	Yes it's real :(|`|1620f8acd8e6a1bab16fb6d4bd625f7baa	Yes, it's her.<br>  She looks horrible.<br>  Chris brown needs someone to beat the crap out of him..

Wi0LBsVbaa	A "proper" quartet abides by the rules set forth for the symphony, in terms of form. (Sonata-allegro, contrasting movements, etc..)<br>  Beethoven was already bending these rules in his last quartets. By now the use of 4 strings seems the only requirement.<br>  In any case the "rules" were made by the ears. As long as you have make your ears happy, you are doing good. <br>  Quartets are easier to write than trios, which are easier than duos, due to the harmonic options.<br>  To answer more specifically, I would need to know if you are attempting a "formal quartet" and what type of harmonic organization you use.<br>  I always recommend studying Beethoven's last quartets, but as Sibelius said he used them as his starting point, from which he built on, I am in reasonably good company.<br>  Feel free to e-mail me on the formal rules of classic form, if you want them, many on this site have skills on this as well.<br>  Nothing will teach you more than studying the works of the composers you like. Rules are made after the fact, by people trying to find the patterns behind such works.<br>  All great success to you.

Lets just hope that all the people who have been saying wicked things about her NEVER have to go through what jade and her family are going through, because I'm sure that THEY would not have the support that the brave and courageous jade is getting as they will probably have no one around them because they are wicked in nature and people pick up on that and they would probably die lonely and alone, God bless to you and yours jade. And yes those wicked questions should be monitored.|`|yldVFIcXaa	Respect for who? She's a racist PR stunt all in one. Sure I feel sorry for her for having cancer, but she's milking it.

Leave the girl alone, I'm not a fan and never was but cut her some slack! she has little or no education, put herself in the spotlight, left herself open to ridicule not knowing any better and has paid the price for the things she has said. Let her have some dignity and peace in her last few weeks or months. The fact that we're talking about her and her condition proves that what she's trying to do is working. We are listening.|`|52pZj3WFaa	I do not care what she has done in the past.....<br>  Well, some of us do. <br>  <br>  And to answer your question - there is an issue of freedom of expression and whilst you may find negative comments about Goody in bad taste, some on here may find the fawning and crocodile tears equally in bad taste.|`|723QHuicaa	I agree - she is a young woman with 2 small kids who is dying.

N6gcTRDsaa	I don't understand this 'natural' argument. Jessica Alba has had her time in the spotlight, and if we're honest about it, she does not look as hot as she did a few years ago. This is my opinion of course.<br>  <br>  And back to the 'natural' argument. Megan Fox's only cosmetic surgery was the removal of a bump on her nose. That's it! Her boobs are the same, as is everything else. And also making her lips bigger, but that's about it.<br>  <br>  Let's be fair about it, all 3 women are very attractive but Megan Fox is shinning the brightest right now. I don't understand the affiliation with stars and how some fans will continue to regard a certain star as the hottest. We are not their husbands or wives and you know what - better looking stars enter the fray all the time. <br>  <br>  It's Megan's turn.|`|NqcnAnC1aa	Jessica Alba is the prettiest because she's more of a natural beauty.|`|I7sS4w0maa	Megan Fox WAS pretty in Transformers but NOW she looks like a strung out Crack Addict<br>  <br>  Jessica Alba doesn't look good with Dark Hair<br>  <br>  So Angelina Jolie

However, the school fires her after some parents complain that her remarks about condoms encourage children to have premarital sex.<br>  <br>  The new sex-ed teacher is a reverend who addresses the children at an assembly, encouraging them to remain abstinent until marriage. At the assembly, Meg meets Doug, whom she begins dating. In order to remain abstinent, however, they start having ear sex. Lois catches them in the act, much to her horror.<br>  <br>  As a result, she sneaks into a school assembly and tells the children that safe sex is okay and that they should decide when they're ready. Doug is excited about now being able to see Meg naked, but after he does, he ends his relationship with her, leaving her distraught.|`|XAhx60Y4aa	season 5 -   "Prick Up Your Ears"

AA11787634	I read somewhere, TMZ I think, that she had a boyfriend and Us Weekly says she just moved out. I think Hef is kicking her to the curb so that he can focus on "the twins" that have been in the last couple episodes. She says it's her decision but since she is the last and there's no more reality show, you be the judge. Just like the godfather, none of them dare say anything bad about Hef. At the end of last season, he said there was going to be 2 more seasons of the show but I guess that was before the twins. I really liked the 3 of them. I am a woman but found them funny and entertaining except for Kendra who is kind of an airhead. But these twins that are his new girlfriends are mean, self-absorbed, vapid, etc. so I think Hef will get bored with them quickly. They don't have the personalities of Holly and Bridget. I just hope all 3 saved their "allowances" because now they have to make it on their own except for Kendra who is apparently marrying a football player or something.|`|5c079cb1c9fa7ffe7d3cdc8fa57061a6aa	she just moved out<br>  <br>  she was the last one to move out
M1ymLE9Paa	You got it.  Trevor was the last death for the hospital crisis.  They magazine's and commercials always play it up that something "big" is happening and then they show all of our favorite characters when they ask "who won't survive".  It's almost always just a bunch of hype and the people who end up dying are usually people we don't care that much about (although there are exceptions, like Emily, Alan, Georgie, etc).  But this time around, all the fan faves are fine.|`|SqNPj54Kaa	Yeah...and then it was Trevor??!  What bothered me even more was the way they ended it; Anthony going nuts I could see, but Trevor getting so nuts just didn't seem to fit his character.  I agree, the whole hospital story was not as good as it should have been; maybe so much "hype" left us expecting more.|`|b2f5cc892d9a2ff6d43172b4bb022096aa	Ah, heck, I think it was the writers' excuse to replace the nurses station that most of us love, and they wanted to create enough drama around that to keep us distracted .......|`|AA12315431	Yep, only Trevor.

I dont know if any of this is truw, but it is what I heard|`|hYP6akCYaa	heard on the radio that rihanna wants him back any way the rumor is that rihanna gave chris genital herpies so he beat the crap outta her<br>  <br>  =(( feel so bad 4 rihanna|`|EWR01atlaa	Well when rihanna was walking down the street or something she had a hat on her and looked like a guy.

However, on their way home from the pre-show, the limo was stopped and an "unidentified" woman got out of the limo and said that Chris Brown assaulted her. They won't release a name, because every victim is entitled to anonymity, but everyone knows that the woman was Rhianna. Rhianna was seen in transport to the ER with her face covered, and a female member of her staff was photographed crying. Rhianna did not attend the Grammy's the following night for her performance, nor did Chris Brown. You decide weather they're over or not.|`|uWo77zxPaa	Chris Brown and Rihanna was suppose to be at a awards show. And then when they fought they could not get on stage because of what happend.People say that he beat her because Rihanna gave him STD (sexually transmitted disease)-A STD can be like herpes and stuff like that. But he beat her. She had 2 black eyes, a bite on her leg, a bite on her arm, nose was bleeding, and her lip was bleeding. After when Chris beat her. He fleed from the primecese. And then the next day. He turned himself in.It's been all over the news.Also people say that when she went back to Barbados she had no bruises. Also people say that Rihanna called the police and told what happend. And one more thing peole say that one of Rihanna's songs was about him. People say it was "Rehab". But don't officially know yet.|`|LejyqXaAaa	real story<br>  Rihanna and Chris were driving home both pissed and they stopped for something and Rihanna scared through the car keys out the window than Chris went to look for them when he couldn't find them he went back to the car and tried to choke her  and she lost consciousness. Chris fled the scene and a bystander called 911<br>  so yeah I think they're over <br>  I can't believe chris would do that!!!|`|epAtqgvhaa	OMG THEY JUST POSTED THE PHOTOS THAT POLICE TOOK AFTER RIHANNA WAS BEATEN UP, SHE LOOKS DEAD OMG IM GONNA CRY<br>  <br>  WRITINGDIVAS.COM|`|blxw0pgDaa	It was a cover up because Rihanna now wants to date me.|`|FGRtmHF4aa	Who gives a flying fiddler's fiddly sticks.|`|XcMtyKvaaa	we dont really know but she did give him a STD.<br>  And beat her up for that.|`|bS0yfvy4aa	its over i'm tellin you now that if anyone did dat to me i'd break up wit dem but dats just me|`|vfL4VMVqaa	think- if your boyfriend attacked you for no proven reason, then would you be together? i didnt think so!

It takes a lot of practice, natural talent, and then you have to find a way to get your stuff out there.<br>  <br>  If you're really set on becoming a singer, practice all the time. Get into as many singing programs as you can, and sing at home. Take lessons if you feel it's a good idea, and be prepared for constructive criticism.<br>  <br>  You've got my support, and there's never any problem with aiming high. ^_^|`|SuMwWNfyaa	no criticism?<br>  <br>  what do you think this is?<br>  <br>  Compliments.com<br>  <br>  yeah.<br>  <br>  <br>  no.|`|AA11098291	stop dreaming and study!
mD7eAAoNaa	Leo, they can be very generous.<br>  Cancer as well, they have a big heart because they are empathetic and compassionate towards those who are less fortunate than them.|`|jTkzSyzbaa	i think  Pisces. if their cat gave birth the kittens, they would love the weakest, not as cute as the other ones. They would help their enemies too. And it's true.|`|CEEQDSCFaa	Pisces<br>  <br>  too big i think, the only sign that really gives without expecting anything in return|`|LNx2Xwy9aa	Pisces!|`|gSUU3Tk3aa	Pisces ! We are friendly and shy.|`|KQjhOdsIaa	wow|`|eT6SsCaraa	Well.. I honestly think Pisces have the biggest heart... <br>  <br>  I would give anything, do anything for the ones I love. No matter how much it hurt, or how hard it was, I would. Nothing means more to me than the happiness of others. And even if they hurt me, I would forgive them and I would help them. I could never hold a grudge, take revenge, or even get angry or hate for that matter.<br>  <br>  Because of this.. when I was younger I used to get taken advantage of, used, and walked all over. I was bullied and hurt.. but even when I was, I could never hold anything against my wrong doers. I would just be sad.. and I would move on, looking for someone who truly cared for me. I am still that way today.|`|d2uGruHiaa	Honestly? No one. People all have a bad side to them, and once-in-a-while, they'll unleash it and hurt you the most. Go ahead and give me a thumbs down for this pointless answer. I'm just pointing out the obvious.|`|GA9thdj2aa	Even though we're emotionally detached, and trust me we hate it but it's how we feel we have to be I think that Aquarius has the biggest heart.|`|O36UwsH9aa	Pisces and im a (sag )trust me iv been with a lot female Pisces (Gf) They do share feeling more than any other sign i been with...|`|oX7M4FoIaa	This question is subjective.

yqe0I5zpaa	Kevin Smith would be the better filmmaker because the movies that he actually made like the Clerks movies, Mallrats, Jay & Silent Bob Strike Back, Zack & Miri Make A Porno, Chasing Amy vs. Judd Apatow's The 40 Year Old Virgin and Knocked Up is an unfair challenge, wait until Apatow actually makes a few more movies, Funny People looks promising. The movies that Judd Apatow produces (Superbad, Pineapple Express, Walk Hard, Step Brothers) are way funnier than Kevin Smith movies, but Judd has only directed two movies and Kevin has actually made 7 or 8 decent flicks. As a filmmaker Smith is better, but as a producer of comedy, Apatow would be considred today's king of comedy.|`|lPvfWzHZaa	Kevin Smith kicks butt|`|d62c067621221ba2fcf278583e7f2288aa	Smith seems as if he creates and develops characters better than Apatow|`|YWjhqlxbaa	Jersey Girl bloweddd.<br>  <br>  <br>  But Kevin Smith rules :]|`|pAAkNAQvaa	kevin smith is an amateur.|`|959a3c98f0a19cd92eb84c2070eb348caa	Smith|`|W78n57I9aa	kevin smith.. duh

w1FkzmP1aa	Pendulum Trap:<br>  <br>  Seth is trapped on a table with a pendulum swinging closer to him. After 30 seconds, it will cut his body, after 60, he gets cut in half. The way to save himself is to use his hands to push two switches, which will activate machines that will crush his hands. They are like vices.<br>  <br>  Water Box Trap:<br>  <br>  Strahm is placed in a chair with a glass box on his head. 2 tubes fed water into the box. There is no tape/video, so he has to find his own way out.<br>  <br>  Note for the next 4 traps: When the door from the previous room is closed, the timer starts for the next trap.<br>  <br>  Neck Tie Trap: (Players must get out of the room before 15 minutes passes, or they die from a Nail Bomb.)<br>  <br>  Brit, Luba, Ashley, Mallick, and Charles wake up, each wearing a collar. Each collar is connected to a locker via a pulley system. There are blades in the locker, and when the time comes out, the people still in their collar, get pulled back and decapitated. They have to pull themselves forward (which pulls the others back), and break a glass box to get a key.<br>  <br>  Glass Jar Trap: (The Nail Bomb returns.)<br>  <br>  The remaining players must break some glass jars to find 3 keys. Each key opens the door to a bomb shelter. Anyone left inside the room after the time ends, gets blown up.<br>  <br>  Bathtub Trap: (If the players don't escape, they get electrocuted.)<br>  <br>  The survivors must connect 5 cords to a bathtub, however the cords are not long enough. They must find a way to connect the cords to the bathtub, which would supply the room with enough power to open the door.<br>  <br>  Handsaw Trap: (If not done in time, the players are locked inside forever.)<br>  <br>  The remaining people must insert their hands into a machine that holds 5 circular saws. They must lose a total of 10 pints of blood, which would open the door for their escape.<br>  <br>  Glass Box Trap:<br>  <br>  Strahm must place himself inside a box full of glass. He is told that if he does, he survives, if he doesn't, the room will be his tomb.<br>  <br>  SPOILERS:<br>  <br>  Pendulum: It turns out to be inescapable, Seth gets bisected.<br>  <br>  Water Box: Strahm gets fully submerged, but stabs himself in his neck (his air pipe) with an empty pen, and uses it to breathe.<br>  <br>  Neck Tie: Charles gets his key quickly, then Luba, and then Brit. Mallick pulls his cord hard, knocking Ashley off her feet. Mallick gets his key, but Ashley doesn't, and gets decapitated. Charles, Luba, Brit, and Mallick survive.<br>  <br>  Glass Jar: Charles knocks Mallick down, giving him a better chance of getting one of the 3 keys, then breaks all the jars. Brit and Luba each grab one of the right keys, after each finding a dud. Brit gets in a shelter, when Mallick reaches for the third key. Charles steps on his hand, but Luba hits Charles. Luba and Mallick each get inside a shelter, and Charles was left to die in the explosion.<br>  <br>  Bathtub: Luba tries to kill Mallick and use his body to open the door. Brit, however, never trusted Luba and stabs her in the neck, killing her. Then they place her in the tub, and attach the cords to her, electrocuting her corpse, and opening the door.<br>  <br>  Hand Saw: Brit and Mallick find out that the purpose of their games was to work as a team. The keys from the Neck Tie each fit every lock. The shelters could fit 2 people in each one. Each person could hold a cord, getting a small shock each, instead of a major one. And each person would only have to give up 2 pints of blood. However, they each give up the required amount, 5 each. They are found by a detective. Brit tells him that they have won their game. However, Mallick passed out, so it is unknown if he survived the blood loss, and it looks as if Brit survives.<br>  <br>  Glass Box: Strahm threw Hoffman into the box. Then, as the walls started closing in, the box sunk into the ground. Hoffman ended up being safe, and Strahm, while trying to escape, got crushed by the walls.
6fsBkK7saa	The Black Parade is the latest studio album, but they released a live recorded one (The Black Parade Is Dead!) after that. They're making the next one now, it'll come out this year. :] :] :] Yayy, I can't wait!! On the next album there won't be concepts, costumes, dramatic stuff like that, they'll just.. rock out :], and make it sound reallyy energetic. That's what they said. They mentioned a song they're making, the working title is 'New Hair, Same Sh**'. Their newest song is Desolation Row, it's a cover of a Bob Dylan's song, it's the official song for a movie called Watchmen so it's on the soundtrack. :] There's also a video, here's a link: <br>  <a href="http://vids.myspace.com/index.cfm?fuseaction=vids.individual&VideoID=51474710" rel="nofollow">http://vids.myspace.com/index.cfm?fuseac...</a><br>  Oh and here's another link you might like..

mGvpcZrFaa	Nancy is a 14 year old girl who just wants to have fun while at a concert with her friends. While there she has an asthma attack and an eighteen-year old guy named Collin helps her. He takes her outside and tells her to relax. From that day on she starts talking to him everyday after school. One night, she invites him to her house when her mother is not home, and he rapes her. After that night, when she begins to look for Collin, it turns out that he does not study in the college he told her. She begins feeling very sick later on, and easily exhausted. Then one day, when her mother takes her to the doctor, she has blood samples taken. She then learns that she has HIV and doesn't know what to do; she just wants to die and feels that she doesn't have anything on earth for her. She decides she wants to find Collin and have him go to jail for raping her. She describes his appearance to the police. Her closest friends help her out, along with her boyfriend Lew. While at school lots of kids don't know that she has HIV, her friends support her the whole way. Nancy and her parents become closer even though her parents are divorced. Later she dies and wishes for her diary to be published so that other young teenagers like her can know the real truth.

BHpELpEqaa	Bella wanted Edward to let her become a vampire and not try and save her. she wants to become a vampire a lot but Edward refuses to let that happen but Bella's not going to give up. <br>  <br>  and then when you saw Victoria at the end at the prom. Victoria is angry with Edward because of killing James so she is seeking revenge and since there is going to be a second movie they are leaving it hanging for people wanting to know more until the next movie...:D|`|52pZj3WFaa	They get together and she gets what she wants...<br>  <br>  ....but there is New Moon which means, of course, that she loses what she wants. Will she get it back? Read the books. They a welcome distraction.|`|ad7ae5e8f17688d3566fad454e8fc09baa	It'll probably be explained in New Moon?

What bit didn't you understand? I found the ending quite simple and easy to understand... Anyway, After the fight, Edward and Bella go to the dance, and Bella drops hints to Edward that she wants to become a vampire, but Edward won't allow it. So she waits. Victoria wants revenge because the Cullens killed James, so that's the ending, as it's seen with Victoria wearing a smug smile and it looks as though she's been crying. Does that help? x|`|1N73V2Ygaa	What was happening was that Bella wants Edward to turn her into a vampire, but he doesn't want to.<br>  Victoria, the redhead, was upset that Edward killed James, her boyfriend. So she is seeking revenge.<br>  Hope that helped!|`|ebWUWk04aa	Yeah because it carries on and u might not off seen all the film if u watched it on the internet after twilight there is new moon then,eclipse then breaking dawn the next one in the cinema cones out at the end of november|`|HrdGdiE0aa	Read the books there a ton better.<br>  She basically went to a dance and <br>  is still together with edward? <br>  The movie leaves alot out anyway.|`|ZKVGoP9Iaa	when twilight stops lol|`|sNPjBNEqaa	she wants to become a vampire, but Edward doesn't want her to, he pretends he's going to change her, and then he doesn't.<br>  simple :)<br>  Victoria (redhead) wants to kill Bella because Edward killed her mate.|`|c0UhndO6aa	When you see Victoria at their prom , its because she's mad at Edward for taking away her partner , which was James . If you read the books , you eventually find out what happens with Victoria , Edward , and Bella . But I'm not going to ruin it for you . Go buy the books if you want to know .<br>  I hope I helped .<br>  Best Answer Please ?

mfJ7LDgxaa	I would say staying on pitch is the most important thing. When someone sings flat or sharp, it doesn't sound good. <br>  <br>  Also being able to hold the note and sustain it without cracking or being to breathy. <br>  <br>  I think there are a lot of details that go into making a "great" singer. But I would say those are the basics.|`|AQFwSLgiaa	Good singing is when you have a natural voice.<br>  I'm a mezzo-soprano and I can sing alto and soprano, so I have no idea what that girl is talking about. You can widen your range. It takes time but you can.<br>  <br>  Bad singing is when you dont have a natural voice. And there is no way to change the way you sound, but only to widen and extend your range.|`|5BbxCohFaa	if it sounds good then it is most likely good but maybe not great...but if it sounds bad it is most likely bad...idk if you could study that scientifically|`|uPDAmpdFaa	Good singing is when somebody knows how to use their particular vocal type. Bad singing is when somebody doesn't know how to use their particular vocal type. Each voice has it's own sound and own way of doing things. When somebody doesn't know how to use their voice or tries to use techniques that their voice can't use that is bad.<br>  <br>  An Alto trying to sing Soprano is bad. A Baritone trying to sing tenor is bad.<br>  A Tenor singing Tenor is good. A Mezzo-Soprano singing Mezzo-Soprano is good.
AA11868787	I saw the pictures and I was horrified!<br>  Not that I condone abuse of kind, but it seemed at first that it was not that bad.

eYMsOOe9aa	A lot of the time they Artist/Band will do it them self and make a clean album (blink-182 did) They may also mute it at that part with the swear and something put a beep in, garage band is a good example of a program that would allow you to do that.|`|L44YeJ6haa	If the song is edited by the person playing it..Such as I have done on college and community radio station. They sometimes put a bleep over the explicit lyric.<br>  <br>  In some instances, on community radio, the person doing the show is providing the music and not the station. hey are responsible for the content and must take one of several actions. They could lay a bleep or a blank spot through an editor beforehand or they just use the station control board to either cut the over the air accesss for that word or lower the slider or pot to make dead air for that instant. <br>  <br>  There are also  a set of FCC "safe Harbor" overnight hours from 10pm to 6am where the rules are somewhat more relaxed. This becomes a station by station decision as to how to proceed overnight and to what limit. There are still some limitations and one has to be tread lightly.|`|qhcc86lUaa	Well, First off they don't bleep out curse words they silence them so you cant hear them, Second off they have to shorten songs to a time limit that is suitable for the radio.  in the black eyed peas case,  either your radio has bad reception or they felt like putting a word other than phunk.  I don't even think phunk is a real word so im really not gonna touch the rest.|`|AA10214276	That song doesn't say "all of the boys and all of the girls are begging to F.U.C.K me." Wtf. Why don't you google the lyrics.|`|uKSsXz2iaa	They replace "phunk" but they don't replace "all of the boys and all of the girls are begging to F.U.C.K me." Makes a lot of sense.

vYAgIMLdaa	I saw the movie when it came out and again 2 nights ago on satellite. USA is the only western industrialized country without health care. Canada has it (don't let the uneducated anti folks lie to you about it) and while we sometimes wait (most I've waited is two weeks for surgery) we don't go bankrupt in the process. USA is unfortunately changing from a help your neighbour land to a spoiled every man for himself society. Truly sad.|`|q6uyloYdaa	I liked that movie a lot, and I don't like Michael Moore. I had a Swedish friend who lived in the U.S. who ran into some serious health problems. He got health care here but it was wildly expensive and they just treated his symptoms instead of trying to find out what was actually wrong. He then went back to Sweden (where they have universal healthcare) and he got better medicine for cheaper and his doctors actually identified the problem.<br>  I thought this was pretty disturbing; he got charged up the *** in the U.S., yet the problem was not solved and the doctors had no intention of doing so.<br>  I think people need to stop being afraid of socialized healthcare. After all, we do have other socialized programs like fire departments and whatnot (I think he actually talks about this in the movie). I'd be perfectly willing to pay higher taxes so everyone can get health care; what we're not paying in extra taxes we're paying in insurance anyway.|`|Shi5z6iJaa	i've seen it and as progressive as i am i take everything Moore says with a grain of salt. that being said the US, current economic crisis aside, is one of the wealthiest nations and for it to be like ranked 26th or 27th in health care is a disgrace

cLW7vFUGaa	Whoa! What an interesting question! xD<br>  <br>  I personally spelled it "woah" for the longest time, until I got tired of it being underlined in red on Microsoft Word whenever I typed it. Even the Yahoo!Answers spellchecker is complaining about it right now. I began to see "whoa" used a lot more frequently, and decided to finally conform, heh-heh. I guess it really IS supposed to be "whoa," because if you search for both phrases on Google, "whoa" gets 13 million results while "woah" only has 5 million. Also, Wikipedia has a page on "Whoa," and when Wikipedia says it, it must be true. ^^<br>  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Whoa" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Whoa</a><br>  As can be seen there, all songs with that title spell it the same way.<br>  Even the Urban Dictionary agrees, defining "woah" as a variant or mispelling of "whoa."<br>  <a href="http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=woah" rel="nofollow">http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.ph...</a><br>  <br>  From a linguistic standpoint, too, I suppose "whoa" really does make more sense. Most people pronounce it with the "wh" sort of blend sound, and I don't see a need for an "h" at the end when the "oa" gives the right "long o" sound that most people say.|`|wO2WY54kaa	It's Whoa!|`|0cMVKUnAaa	Never though about it.<br>  It's both.<br>  Whatever I'm in the mood for.

yoGWCH3gaa	Do NOT get a Jupiter. They are not worth the money you will spend on one. <br>  <br>  It all depends on what sort of music you are wanting to play. If you want the saxophone for playing Jazz or, perhaps, some form of Rock then my best suggestion would be a Keilwerth. I play on a Keilwerth and it is the most beautiful deep/dark tone. Very nice. If you are wanting to use the instrument for classical music then you should definitely check out the Selmer you mentioned. I'm not familiar with that exact model, but Selmer makes very good quality saxophones with a brighter sound that is used primarily in classical music. <br>  <br>  Best of luck in the decision and enjoy playing!|`|OewyLONdaa	Too expensive....get a good one at wholesale price.<br>  <br>  www.tootn.com<br>  5% off coupon code: MUSIC1|`|y2woLnrPaa	You can rent one, and you make payments each month.  Then, eventually you pay it off.  I suggest Jupiter.

Are you talking about over y/a? - not much  With a spouse or friend? - not much unless it gets violent  With an authority figure - you could be fired/arrested/etc.|`|K2tWJE1Vaa	alotta Knots on your head if it is with a Cop...|`|sJs0nuTSaa	Depends on your age, if weapons are involved, if the police are called, if someone gets hurt, or if you get caught.  It's probably better to leave it alone and walk away.  Good Luck.|`|sZhTwzh4aa	what, in real life? are you over or under 18? over 18=assault and you get yo' as* in JAIL, boi. under 18= call/email home from your school, they will be like, um. you child was fighting. suspended (in-school, i think) 3 days.     if you're on the hockey team, they encourage you to beat the sh*t out of other players...as long as they aren't on your team.|`|LV8uUmehaa	You get your pinky removed.|`|8s8c3Ptuaa	Why you ain't gone Win any way|`|blzFIxcUaa	Life sentence.|`|f7l9byFGaa	It all depends on your age.  If you are under 18 and it happens in school you can get suspended or expelled.  Also if you did any damage to the other kid his parents can sue for medical bills.  If you are over 18 then you can get arrested.|`|6rvzeOsqaa	it depend on how old you are, how bad the "fight" was, if any injury happened, if any weapons were used, etc.      if you are an adult, you can go to jail for fighting if the other person files charges. it's called assault.|`|f9No4eRBaa	Generally speaking, it all depends what kind of fight it is, if the other party got hurt and where it happened.    Laws very all over the place and if you were in Canada here are a few things to consider and it may be similar in other jurisdictions:  1. If the fight was consensual and in a public place where people were around, you could be charged with a Criminal office (probably similar to a misdemeanor in the US) for Causing a disturbance by fighting. The police would have to prove someone was disturbed. ie: if you were in a cafe' or local fair, people would be disturbed. If you went to a rural area where nobody was around other than your friends to watch the fight, nobody is disturbed.  Again, if consensual and in a non public area and neither was seriousl injured . .. not much the police can do. If one was injured and refused to co-operate with the police (if the police were called and got involved), there is nothing the police can do. If by chance someone in the fight was killed (ie: fall down, hit their head on a rock and die), you could be looking at a serious offence.    2. If the fight was non-consensual ie: one guy just up and starts a fight with someone else and pounds on him, could be looking at assault and battery charges (and going to jail).    3. If you were minding your own business and someone either jumps you or someone else and you fight to protect yourself or the other person, you will be ok . . .but a test the police/colurts would look at was "using as much force as necessary". You can't pull out a knife or gun and kill someone to protect yourself if a similar threat level was not raised against you.
MQNVHdu9aa	It does have nudity. They have a topless bar scene where they show a bunch of ugly fake boobs.    Lindsay does a stripper act but she is not naked. The panties she is wearing shows her butt. There is also a sex scene where Lohan is Topless but they show her from behind and from the sides.    It is a horrible movie and the strippers are nasty looking.|`|Nctd8Xyaaa	The movie is garbage. Lindsay's acting is worst than garbage and the camera work and the gore looks from the 1970s technology. Story is non-existent and you get lost 10 minutes into the movie.   The nudity as someone already said is just a couple of fake boobs and they only show Lohan from behind whenever she is topless.|`|1ZfFSH6maa	i dont think so, but one character IS a stripper, so they show a very sexy stripper scene (she doesnt show private parts in that scene though) and theres an intense sex scene    (idk if it matters but overall i didnt think the movie was any good, it was very hard to follow)|`|KWl605JTaa	THAT MOVIE SUCKS|`|1e6eca30bdd2eb772df216bfd70b9ca4aa	Yes it does, but i dont think any of it is by Lindsay Lohan.

My favorite songs are "Lonely People" and "Use Your Love"|`|kuxVB76maa	Haterzz Everwhere was one the sickest songs.|`|MtsfAnXVaa	Never even heard of him, i like it tho, sorta reminds me of the guy from outkast.|`|BGMy4fw4aa	hes pretty good. his songs are played on mtv jamz a lot|`|4sd4eeBdaa	Yeah hes from the South isnt he?<br>  <br>  I like the first song i heard it a few weeks ago i might listen to the others later when i have time .
dprURFLxaa	Seinfeld...as Seinfeld and also as Barry the Bee...the fact that "Seinfeld" (the show) had no heart as you say is one of the reasons it was damn good.<br>  <br>  BTW...this shouldn't even be a question...there's no comparison.|`|NSKimt1Qaa	I agree with a lot of your assessment of the two shows.  I really did like Cheers when it was on, but more when Shelley Long was on the show.  Although, I liked Kirstie Alley, I just thought Sam and Diane should have ended up together.  I didn't like how they ended that romance and Rebecca and Sam just didn't seem like the right match.  Other than that, I really liked Cliffy and Norm on that show.  Maybe their characters were "caricaturish" but they were still great!<br>  My answer will have to be Cheers, even though Seinfeld was an enormously popular TV show.  I like a show with heart!<br>  For the record, Kramer was my favorite character on Seinfeld just because he was funny and crazy!|`|y9CgveCGaa	Seinfeld.  The characters are more closely liked to life for me.|`|4RYlmSLEaa	Seinfeld...Kramer is so crazy and George is too|`|L0IGkNGraa	I would have to say Seinfeld as well! I guess it's not so much for the comedic value, but because all of the characters always seemed to get along and live as if they were family and not like they were strangers to each other. <br>  <br>  On top of that, the characters (all Elaine, George, Kramer, Jerry and even Newman) never cease to entertain! The way in which the characters are portrayed is side-splitting hilarious, and I always seem to see myself laughing at Jerry's stand-up comedy at the start and end of each episode. <br>  <br>  In fact, I love Seinfeld so much, I bought Jerry's "I'm telling you for the last time"... I really love it!<br>  <br>  Seinfeld hands down for me.|`|HEs6bzOtaa	Seinfeld owns cheers<br>  <br>  Anyway anyone here a kyle xy fan because if you are<br>  Please go to www.savekylexy.com and press save kyle xy<br>  If you can sign a petition it might not get cancelled <br>  Please help|`|nkydcXf8aa	SEINFELD ALL THE WAY!!!<br>  <br>  =]|`|kz9O7QKwaa	I LOVED Cheers when Diane Chambers was on it. I can't stand Rebecca Howe-she just wasn't funny. The early Cheers were almost as consistantly funny as Seinfeld.

Ow3O7h4caa	Progression is a method used to progress your natal planets and angles for the purpose of looking for good opportunities while avoiding the hurdles or easing any pain that awaits a person.<br>  <br>  Progressed chart are useful especially if, lets say, you are willing to change job, relocate in another city, or doing an important purchase etc..etc.. You want to see when is the best time to act and a progress chart can indicate the good and the obstacles and the finale outcome.<br>  Same for , let's say, you are planning to do something 5 years down the line, a progressed chart can show if the planets are in your favour. Any good aspects to your natal chart will give opportunties and help from the outside. Bad aspects are hurdles, or obstalce that may present itself.<br>  <br>  Note that the Ascendant, MC, Sun and Moon are the important factor in progressions. You can advance any planets with the formula 1 deg= 1 year which are the most used progressions.<br>  If you advance your Sun 30 deg ahead, it represents 30 yrs old and any aspect formed then, are noted. That is how progressions work. Then, the Transits will activate these aspects. This is to give you an idea of how you can project ahead in the future and choose good aspects to your advantage.|`|SdpWsTlQaa	I live by mine its never let me down but you should have a professional explain it to you.|`|aZXnW6AUaa	live by the mind

6qDhXpWfaa	Mm, well they both have their faults, but if I had to choose, I'd be Osaki Nana. <br>  <br>  Cause Hachi is just so damn annoying. She's manipulative, flirty, selfish, and depends too much on people. Then again Osaki Nana is scarily possessive. <br>  <br>  But Hachi is very caring and does what she thinks is best. Osaki Nana is better though cause I admire her strength and motivation. It's hard to have a dream you want as much as she does.|`|wO2WY54kaa	Nana Osaki.  but Her life in the Manga is so depressing but in the anime, SHE ROCKS!  *RenXNana!!!|`|VLRkJOOuaa	I like Nana Osaki more, though I understand Hachi.<br>  <br>  <br>  I think I relate to Nana Osaki a lot more, and she seems to have a personality just like mine.

What does this tell them?  Its okay to try drugs and, if you get caught, you can get away with it as long as you are famous but you will go to jail if you are nobody.<br>  <br>  You cant have one rule for one and another for everyone else. If charges are pressed then it will be interesting to see the outcome.

Answer:  Hailing taxis.    Ha Ha    I did read not too long ago that many years ago roofs were made of straw and dogs and cats would lay on that straw.  When it would rain heavily, the straw would get slippery and then the dogs and cats would slide off the roof and people would see dogs and cats go by their windows as they slipped off the roof.  So that is where "raining cats and dogs" came from -- a heavy rain caused them to slide off the roof.  I just thought that was interesting.|`|TZiySTOGaa	i'd make one from steel... otherwise the cats and dogs are just gonne rip through the fabric of the umbrella... definately make one of steel.... mind you that might prove a bit messy... hhhmmmm on second thought best not go out when its raining cats and dogs!|`|rzrki3OZaa	Nope, get the shotgun.|`|vbsNdIluaa	Yeah.|`|0LUBf2Juaa	I have an elephant umbrella so yes.|`|5F1UErrhaa	No way - those claws can wreak havoc on the furniture, an umbrella won't hold against them!|`|xrsAGqb7aa	no not unless its made of steal... they would fall rite thuogh it|`|AA10877476	your feet will definitely get wet and if there's wind, too, then the umbrella will protect only your head, perhaps. because you'll be totally wet elsewhere. plus umbrellas can also break if the wind is powerful.|`|5l5eCRdOaa	Not if large breeds begin to fall.

uYCqZjcGaa	I believe that Strikers had been so consistant all season and had such an awesome style to their dancing. With Fly K. I feel like they've been saved too many times. Theres a reason America keeps voting them to the bottom! I feel like the judges were WAY too tough on Strikers; even the best groups mess up sometimes, they deserved to be there 100%|`|2tn8EALqaa	all these answers suck!<br>  <br>  Simple answer is that they messed up. You can't mess up when it's crunch time. Every competitor knows this.|`|aihogb26aa	Strikers is 10 times better than Fly Khicks. America keeps voting them into the bottom 2 and the judges have saved them 4 times. It's totally ridiculous. Beat Freaks make Fly Khicks look like a generic bunch of video girls. I am very disappointed, but am confident that they won't make it through one more week!|`|Mx07dTipaa	well for last nights performance, they didn't do as well as their other performances, but i don't think they deserved to go home. they were so good the whole season and stayed "consistent" (as lil mama always says). i mean look at their britney performance when they had to dance as if they had a mirror, it was amazing  as for all their other performances. to be honest, Fly Kicks should have gone home 2 weeks ago. they're alright, but no where as good as Quest Crew and Beat Freaks. i just hope America gets it right because i dont what another situation like the group Status Quo from season one when they beat kaba modern. if Fly kicks goes into the top 2, im not watching ABDC ever again.|`|js58iOmAaa	for this particular performance, yes....all around, no<br>  <br>  Fly khicks had an unusually ok performance tonight and strikers just blew it...not a fan of either tho, i like quest|`|y5FfKGAsaa	They didn't completely deserve to go home. Yes, they could have been cleaner, but they still are a good group with a lot of potential.<br>  ~|`|S7nms8Gcaa	i fine they were sloppy|`|ib8YGGrdaa	NO! Strikers All-Stars has been killing it all season. As much as I respect the other crews, Strikers deserved to win the whole thing. It's true that it was not their best performance, but I believed their history and personality should have carried them through to have a chance to recover in the top three.<br>  I wish them all the best!|`|0N3NctE9aa	I think taht the Strikers All Stars should have stayed too.Come on,Fly Kicks what the hell is that!They've been saved way too many times,and the people just keep voting them in the bottom,so wahts the whole point of saving them?<br>  If G.O.P. Dance Crew had a chance to stay i bet you they wouldve been way better than Fly Khicks<br>  But Quest Crew and Beat Freaks are going to be the final two<br>  But Strikers All Stars is the best and they were very clean and consistnet<br>  I WILL NEVER SEE ABDC AGAIN IF THEY CHOOSE FLY KHICKS OVER QUEST CREW OR BEAT FREAKS

AA11246851	Love  never hurts, only people do. I can say i'm  in love and feel so great and then the subject of my affection comes and sends it all to heck, love felt good, people came and screwed it. They say you can only hurt the one you love, but that is not quite so, because if you love me and then you try and hurt me, i couldn't care less, i don't even know you. However you will feel hurt because you do love me. You get where i'm at? Love does not hurt. Take the love of parent vs. child. No hurt here, however there are maniacs, sick and sorry, who will hurt that own child. Love has nothing to do with it. Just try not to take that hurt from no one. You deserve better because it's you. And that's why people keep coming back. They don't appreciate themselves enough to get strong and leave. And love again for the true meaning of it.|`|OpduZC3Eaa	It could be any number of reasons...    Desperation...    Lack of intelligence...    They are masochistic and love pain...

If this was the 90s, his career would've been over, because no one gave a $hit about digital sales, and actually, digital sales weren't even tracked. Shut up. If the internet hadn't been invented, alot of rappers wouldn't have a career.

If that guy had, he would have cost the movie several days of down time while they looked for a replacement and Christian Bale, who caused this whole damn scene, would have been FINISHED, not to mention McG, who is kissing his @ss and defending him.    As crew members, we sometimes bumble into shots.  It happens.  It's undesirable, but it is not the big deal Bale made of it.  After seeing this tirade, I can honestly tell you that I would happily turn down a fifteen thousand-dollar job just to keep from walking onto a set with this jack@ss.    EDIT: Nebula - excuse me, but I have a great understanding of what it takes to make a movie, and that's how I know that incidents like this only serve to make the misery worse.  For days on end.  I personally think this guy should have his SAG CARD FVCKING FED TO HIM.|`|Oh3yVRQzaa	Have you seen any of Christian Bale's movies other than Batman?  He is a great actor despite his issues.     It was unnecessary and rude of course and I'm sure he realized it afterward - and obviously the kissed and made up or the movie wouldn't be on track - as Bale threatened.     Everyone has had a bad day and has acted inappropriately at one point or another - what's important is how the person deals with it afterwards.     Christian Bale obviously has some issues with managing his anger - there are a lot of people who do (myself included) and though I might not add as many useless adjectives into my tirades - I still get angry sometimes - not always (and it's important to realize that this was one day out of 365) If I do say something out line I always apologize afterwards - did the person recording this get that part? no - obviously not.     I think you need to understand the whole circumstances - and passing judgement on a person's chracter after this incident (and the incident with his mother and sister) is unfair.     This is the Director of Photography who was screwing up - not some sandwich server on the set. He should know his job. You don't walk on a set in the middle of filming - every minute of filming that goes by costs thousands of dollars and one screw up can be costly.     Apparently this was one of the most intense scenes - and Bale is a method actor and it takes a lot to immerse yourself in the scene and the feelings and emotions of the character you're portraying - a long full day of work doesn't necesary help to minimize the stress.   I would be fuming too - but I would definitely have apologized after my rant.|`|c059nXPfaa	I think this is being blown way out of proportion. The people making the biggest deal out of it are the people who don't understand what it takes to make a movie, and to give a really great performance.  I feel he was justified in reacting like that, given that the guy he's talking to seemed to FAIL at doing his job.|`|CXAHUeeAaa	No matter how big a star you think you are or how great a position you have -- you cannot treat people like garbage.  If he intended to humiliate the worker or to make the worker look bad--sorry you are the one that looked like as ***.  Grow up!|`|56f496b7c161569bc559dbae6545c044aa	Probably a little over the top - but if the guy was repeatedly walking around during the take then he probably deserved a bollocking|`|iufAPDeWaa	Wow... he has an anger problem. I would have walked off. He talked too much over nothing. Coudn't have been that big of a deal. Didn't he hit a lady in his family or something last year? Dude has issues...  And he's so handsome too.. what a waste! lol.    LOL @ twilight freak :)

Talk about someone aiming for innuendo. The last time I witnessed 12 inches of snowfall in Oklahoma was 2 days after the beginning of spring, March 23, 1984 was absolutely bizarre. The next day it was nearly 80 degrees and melted practically all of it. It was almost a flood right after a freak blizzard.|`|MgOzpSs6aa	HECK TO THE YEAH! lol.

4Ct2FpjOaa	Well, in a BRAVO interview from 2007 Bill, Tom, and Gustav answered to the question whether they believed in God. Bill answered 'Not really' and Tom agreed with Bill. Gustav does and only goes to church on holiday with his family.<br>  <br>  So the Kaulitz twins don't have any views, not too sure on Georg. Gustav believes. Bill and Tom DO wear crosses, but for more than anything it is for fashion purposes.<br>  <br>  I promise you this is all the truth.|`|tlLoQUsuaa	i think [i'm fairly sure i read it somewhere] that they're all christian.<br>  pretty darn sure.<br>  <br>  edit. ha the kid below me can't even talk right. :P<br>  <br>  edit 2. they're not super hardcore religious, but believe in God obviously. and bill wears crosses around his neck all the time. :]|`|c7GGP3Qlaa	I don't know either.I posted a few questions like this a while back and I got pretty much the same answers.I hope one day they do believe in God.I'm praying for them.|`|hNLAJ6jFaa	im not sure if they even practice but good question<br>  oh dear.i hope they arent hard core Christian|`|Inn0Knhsaa	i only really know for bill and tom they were born christians but they do'nt really practice it, bill mainly wears the cross as jewerly ( i think).  They are all from madeburg which is predominatley protestant, so i'ld assume they are but idk for sure|`|NzVB9cFCaa	Aww. I'm kinda sad that none them are 'really' into God and stuff. But I am glad that my guy, Gustav, is somewhat.<br>  :D|`|1UOIoOzKaa	Hmm, I heard Bill and Tom didn't believe in God.<br>  And that Gustav was Protestant, but I don't know about Georg|`|dRWDV6Rlaa	well i heard that they were atheist<br>  but i wasnt sure if that was true<br>  and like some answers say that yes they do believe in God somewhat, buttheyre not like super religious you know and besides, they can believe in whatever they want theyll be Tokio Hotel<33333

My daughter Rick Rolled me a week or so ago.  I had never heard of it before that.  I have to admit I thought it was hilarious.  The video she sent me was so dorky.  Eighties hair was so big.

8yE2sYGeaa	It might be partially true, but not fully true, especially the part about the lawsuit in and of itself|`|jthpq6Egaa	Well, it may or not be inspired by a true story.  Tony Gilroy heard a story while he was developing the script (at the time he was spending a lot of time in law offices and their employees).  According to him:<br>  <br>  "I heard a story about a firm involved in a huge corporate litigation that had gone on for almost a decade. The case had been essentially settled, and the firm had prevailed. The settlement was over a billion dollars. Things were so far down the line that the firm had begun clearing out the document rooms that had housed all the filings and paperwork. Two days before the final signing, at four o' clock in the morning, a third year associate found a document that had never been placed in discovery. It was a very bad document, which would've meant a complete reversal of the case. The document never saw the light of day, and that associate had the fastest partner promotion in the history of the firm."<br>  <br>  Is the story he heard true?  Who knows but to me it just sounds like "legal urban legend."
G1lSbvAQaa	hmm, I guess whatever people notice is fine for me.  Like I don't try to uplay anything but I'm open to receiving compliments ;) lol|`|2haW6GJbaa	my style................byotch's hate !!|`|cd2etz5Raa	This is going to sound VERY contradicting, but I like it when people notice that I'm humble. I like using my talents and qualities for good and the benefit of others, but I don't want to be recognized or credited for them, and I hate the idea of showing them off or bragging about them. So when someone tells me that I'm humble, I feel really good.|`|NB5Dr7Nzaa	People always notice or comment on my lips and smile, that and my eyes.  Once people get to know me further (and I will "brag" on this fact) they find out and appreciate my loyalty.

So, now I just don't bother and left it at that :/  Oh, and I don't htink you can recover them., they'll just have to add themselves again manually, I think. If they want to, that is. lol.|`|0uMLrKAbaa	find them agaiin!

I dislike lots of people for no good reason at all!|`|QPPcUyyyaa	Yes.  Freud said that these emotions can sometimes stem from our own insecurities.  For example, if you fear that you are fickle (or any negative adjective), then you are likely to be annoyed by people who you perceive to also be fickle.|`|sZhTwzh4aa	YES.     like, they've got this f*cking aura, and it's like, NRG. get out of my presence you self-righteous douche!    even though they might not even be a douche at all. you wouldn't know, having never spoken to them in your life.|`|cHiv6eTWaa	Yes I hate people who think they are always right and I work  with one of those type of bit***s every day she drives me crazy.|`|SaUIJeKDaa	Yeah..all the time...and those i just hate because of this no reason as to why thing gets it bad from me.|`|6HXUbN5zaa	actually i have found out that most people tick me off!|`|nGxrvQavaa	There are soooo many people that tick me off no specific reason.

I HAVE A WHOLE LIST TOO|`|ZBSlbzYtaa	yep but its probably me being affected by what others think of them|`|zLANxHKfaa	hahaha absolutely! i try not to but once in a while you come across the person that right away you can just feel that you wont like that person and you look for anything to credit that opinion, just waiting for that one comment to set you over the edge of acceptance|`|G15dXNlKaa	Yea, human instinct is a strange thing. I have also found myself liking rotten people for no apparent reason. It just goes to show that some of our feelings aren't really based on what makes sense but are practically random.|`|7dGpL4mSaa	I always have a reason. ;)|`|RwYIhCg8aa	I know what it is that ticks me off... first, it's THEM.  Second, and even more so... I'M TICKED WITH MYSELF for allowing myself to be exposed to that ignorant type of person again on my own free will!      Sometimes, I make it like a punishment for myself, and go around them when I've been mad, kinda like a time out!|`|huto12P3aa	Yea there is, but generally i dont like to dislike people for no reason|`|QYDYX9B7aa	Yes, that initially happens but when I talk with that person and get to know them, usually I am 100% convinced the opposite of what I may have first thought.|`|JbRTKDFmaa	Yes, all the time. It's like they rub me the wrong way without really even doing anything.|`|Vhq3GURQaa	Sure, I've had that. There is a theory it is because we see something in them that we don't like about ourselves. Is it true? Who knows.|`|FKhY6EVAaa	lol all the time|`|lk3W1VJHaa	Yups.|`|2vw48Whtaa	Yes.    Some people I meet, and hate immediately.

Like sometimes I can just look at someone and know right away that they're gonna annoy me. Idk why.|`|g0VUoRY9aa	I've totally been there. It drives me nuts! Like I try to like them, but something about them just makes me not like them...    I get that alot at work... Customers, or associates. But those associates dont usually last... My work, the grumpy people leave pretty soon!|`|sJs0nuTSaa	Yes, especially some co-workers.  Sooner or later, something will happen and I find that I was right.

So my suggestions are:    Blood rush    Reaching Night    Darkest bloom    Come up with some thing original and some thing you all will like and think about the fans what you would wanna hear them screaming to you just before you walk on stage.|`|fkYQN5Xuaa	well murder dolls is taken....stillborn is a cool name for band|`|2OHjXfBKaa	well im a rainbow-y person lol but i will try for the joy of two points:    death by default    bleeding in    blood apple    vampires run on fridays...?

CQ2XnlAtaa	Not over.<br>  But it did impact.|`|4w9gmvumaa	No way.  He is done.  And I'm glad.  First the endorsements.  But in the domain of public opinion, he cannot make a comeback.  There is no explaining this away.  Not even with his half-azzed apology.  But that is not enough of a punishment for him.  I would really like to see him  behind bars for the next decade.  And I want to see RiRi free from the nighmare that she has been living (that we didnt even know she was enduring).  Even the hard-core hip hoppers on the fift cent website who were  bashing her all week were silenced by the picture.  I am so thankful for the thief who stole them because they are shedding light on an issue that is usually kept behind doors, or viewed as a private matter as it pervades our society.  I want to see him do hard time to teach every abuser a lesson.  You dont batter another human, especially on less physically strong than you.|`|qOKFuXfLaa	well, it's not boosting his career<br>  may that monkey rot in prison <br>  i hope he drops the soap<br>  <br>  thoughts & prayers are with RiRi|`|e8lAALzgaa	I don't think his career will ever be what it once was. He'll probably come out with another album and it'll flop and we won't here to much from him after that.<br>  <br>  I mean he beat up one of the biggest pop stars in the world and now that the pics are out of Rihanna's injuries it makes it much more real, what he did.|`|9VaWal2Daa	Have no idea who Chris Brown is, or what he did......so I read thru the answers. <br>  <br>  Oh. <br>  <br>  Okay.<br>  <br>  No, his career is not over.   In fact,  in the thug world........this probably somehow sickly translates into bigger sales. <br>  <br>  He's da man, and all that crap. <br>  <br>  and as they say, any publicity at all, helps......it's all about getting your name out there, right? <br>  <br>  well, now his name is out there. <br>  <br>  so I would say, no, this will NOT hurt his career.  Some sick b*stards will actually run out and BUY his albums now.......because he taught his *beeayatch  a lesson!   Yeah!<br>  <br>  Personally, a beater should be prosecuted to the FULLEST extent of the law.  I hope Rihinna pressed charges and he does serious jail time.  How could you beat on something that LUSCIOUS???<br>  <br>  What is WRONG with people??????????|`|5iOHJHUzaa	He will have to try really hard and there will still be people who will never forget/forgive. He didn't JUST hit or push her which would have been bad enough, he bruised her. What was he thinking?!|`|6sb24oLGaa	It's so pointless. Okay he hit Rhianna. So what... if you look next door I bet they're husbands hit they're wife, you wouldn't care. So, if Chris hits Rhianna, than why should we care maybe it's a reasonable matter? If you REALLY think about it. It's the same thought. I do NOT think his career is over|`|IeH4C24Daa	his career is definitely not over, he'll bounce back it all depends on his fans really. and with all these lunatic girls fantasizing over him, he wont be down too much longer lol. <br>  he just wont have any endorsement deals commercials or anything he ruined that for himself.|`|HR4vMwcDaa	his action made a huge impact on his career right now, but if he works hard enough and maturely cleans this mess up, then it might take a while, he could build his career back up again. but i wont happen overnight. he will need to work at it.|`|b3dbc99139f2374f30ad1ee8aae5245faa	I think that it depends on how Rihanna handles it. If she goes public and tells the whole story than I think it will hurt his career but if she stays quiet about it I think it will eventually fizzle out.|`|44dcc209645e25a90756133f2c64c1e5aa	OF COURSE NOTTTT. hey, he's Chris Brown-if he can jump off walls he can definitely make a come back. it may take some time but I know he will.|`|pAAkNAQvaa	who?

Maybe they did it before his parents sent him here.  (You'd think you could tell as tight as his pants are)
QbQwTSHbaa	ok best way right here>>> soo u have to be really romantic and tell her all the right, cute, sweet things but u have to mean it. dont say ne thing u dont mean. we can be gullible and easily hurt. we also hate liars. be honest and open. share ur deepest thoughts and feelings. we like to please but love to be pleased. plan a really special romantic evening with like candles, soft music, massage with sum scented oil, take ur time and just indulge us with pleasure. trust me ne pisces would like fall head over heals if u did that. just be very sensual. compliment us. makes us feel special and like we r the most important ppl in the world. appreciate everything we do. listen to what we have to say. be a gentlemen. but also being funny definately helps. lol. take us away from reality. all that good stuff... and more.|`|iCXt7FfEaa	be sincere and persevere. pisces women appreciate a man of actions more than a man of words.|`|UgRSeCa3aa	Be charming and charm her friends. Show what a good heart you have. The most important things are these. You can even be obnoxious. The first person was right though, words are words. Actions are the way to a pisces heart. That's why they are usually attracted to like, Aries. Don't be a *****...... but having some problems to talk to them about doesn't hurt you either. Hope it helps

But, it's a very good album. <br>  <br>  City of Evil is all singing, but the beat is pretty fast. <br>  <br>  The self titled is probably their calmest one yet.<br>  <br>  Diamonds in the Rough, which is the CD that comes with Live in the LBC (live DVD), has some screaming songs on it.<br>  <br>  Hope this helps.<br>  <br>  I personaly like the self titled the best, but I don't like screaming that much. if you're into that then you should like Sounding the Seventh Trumpet.|`|r2pbe2PQaa	waking the fallen is way better than city of evil.. waking the fallen still had the decent vocals and the guitar was awesome.  city of evil was so whiney and terrible..<br>  <br>  but there is also sounding the seventh trumpet which has a decent song or two.|`|TsTIpV21aa	you kind of wasted ur money but buy the SOUNDING OF THE SEVENTH TRUMPET album here is a preview if you want to know what it sounds like<br>  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fQyxENKNGMI" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fQyxENKNG...</a>|`|M7E1uIsKaa	waking the fallen is the best<br>  Then Sounding the Seventh trumpet<br>  Then City of Evil, Avenged Sevenfold, and Diamonds in the Rough|`|gbm71puSaa	City of Evil, but the vocals are bad|`|SIfh7iZWaa	City of Evil was half way mediocre<br>  <br>  i dont care what their "NEW" fans might say<br>  <br>  <br>  waking the fallen & Sounding the Seventh Trumpet<br>  were their BEST albums<br>  <br>  <br>  for example:<br>  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zCfpJjh7MJw" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zCfpJjh7M...</a>|`|K1Nnzq3Jaa	Waking The Fallen and City of Evil are really good but I prefer COE more.<br>  <br>  I hate people who whine and complain about COE just because "screaming" was dropped.

ee7b4508c5f4d59cc119fd0c3e945b93aa	Because there are 3 kinds of Reality Show viewers:<br>  <br>  1.  People who do not like Reality  TV, therefore they never watch.<br>  2/  People who enjoy the Reality TV shows but view them as just a source of light entertainment.<br>  3.  People who enjoy the Reality TV shows, strongly identify with the characters and scenarios, and "model" themselves after the contestants every week " (almost to the point one would think we can duplicate people.)|`|S6jMQBiiaa	people love to watch train wrecks plain and simple|`|4wTbdsJgaa	We build up stars to be basically, as the greeks had, god's of glory.  They are untouchable, and incapable of mistake.  However, the reality shows show just how real these people are, and make us think that when we see them, they are just like all of us.

Fsr2Rofzaa	it is annoying.  I have always thought it looks like he is dragging her b/c he walks to damn fast.  I used to like Dr Phil, can't stand him anymore.  I honestly don't think he gives good real world advise.  I remember 1 episode where his wife said she never once yelled at her kids, not one time.  Sorry, but they lost me there.  Sometimes kids need a good yelling at, and a swat on the butt.  Look at how kids are acting today........this is what happens when "time out" is suppose to be the end all discipline|`|AA12316366	who knows? to me, dr phil is a royal pain in the  butt|`|xYTagSIyaa	He said that he did not think it was proper with his wife in the audience to just walk off the show without her.  <br>  This represents to his public that he loves and respects his wife, and in his mind, it seemed the proper thing to do.|`|NBI2r47baa	It's what the previous poster said about respecting his wife and stuff. I saw the show when he explained it. I used to like him, but I think he's become too Hollywood and will do anything to get his name and TV show out there. He gives some good advice, but I think he should remain more professional, not celebrity-ish.|`|f1diiqKFaa	I never understood why she was there EVERY TIME. Doesn't she have something better to do? I am not trying to be mean, but in the real world, who takes their spouse to work everyday/time if any at all? I did like Dr. Phil when he first started and he was truly helping families, but something changed and it seems he makes a big joke over peoples problems now. Just my opinion....|`|EPPb5pRBaa	For people to think they have a perfect marriage.

wem5CpcPaa	I just watched it last night - thought it was sad.  I have learned something though.  My fiance died very suddenly two years ago.  He came into the room I was in, apologized for some things he had done the summer before.  A client called, I talked with her for 10 minutes, went into our bedroom and he was dead on the floor from a heart attack.  My point in telling you this is that I think the real heart of the movie is the end - where she is over the intense grief and a better person for knowing him.  That scene where she throws a kiss over the ocean says a lot to those of us who have had to go through losing a partner.  <br>     I know that if I wouldn't have had that experience, I wouldn't have appreciated the healing process she went through.  <br>     Unfortunately, death is a part of life - a crappy part.  But in every couple, someone has to go first - and the person left behind has to choose if they are going to honor that person (and all that person gave them and helped them to be) by moving forward in life.  <br>      Also, if he hadn't of died, the relationship with her daughter might not have improved.

AA11246851	Well...assuming you love each other, then you are sort of each other's present, a special gift of love to love. So try and unwrap this special present the way you would with a special package, so special and precious you don't even want to tear off the paper...but if it happens...oh well, so be it...;) :P|`|28498a903efb7372e241c2b455610196aa	Undressing each other|`|wMunBQ9Oaa	Undressing each other.|`|2haW6GJbaa	getting down to business, the first one sounds cheesy !|`|aCCUQQu4aa	nothing says romance like ripping each other's clothes off...isn't that everyone's fantasy|`|ReHd1IlYaa	first one!|`|mggll8dRaa	I let "Honey" do a seductive Strip-Tease.....!!|`|yT3ZNEROaa	Both depends on how much time you have.

Make sure that you get the red one, because red equals passion.|`|9vV1yAItaa	1st one definitely but romantically speaking this should be done a little slowly with kissing and caressing.
FEbT1numaa	I love twilight .. but I think the movies maybe too big for her? I don't think she would fit in to it very well. But who knows, I spose it could suprise us.|`|zetxxZWUaa	I loved the book and hated the movie. And one thing i know for sure is Hudgens isn't ever going to be in the Twilight films, i know that for a fact. I'm in the film business and i would have heard from the director about this and it's not true (thank God)|`|7EdDelD7aa	the twilight series is very good i watched the movie then started reading the books i will be finished with the third book 2night as a matter of fact|`|mGN7wQ2Taa	first of all i like HSM i think its a fun movie and its their songs are really catchy, but i dont think that she should be put in the movie. im already bitter sweet about dakota fanning being in the movie. what i like about the twilight movie, is that its not filled with well known celebrities. i feel that having new actors in a movie gives it a different vibe instead of the Hollywood vibe.    also i dont think that the character of leah is a necessity for the movie. if they are going to put leah in the movie they should do it in the third one but i still dont think its a must. the story is more about bella edward and unfortunately jacob black. he he.. adding more characters to the film will just clutter the story !|`|iQAGeVjsaa	I hope not it will destroy her disney street cred|`|Sj1WsLeEaa	omigosh!  they cant mix a really good film into a goodish but childish one!  vanessa is very very annoying!  i think its a bad thing|`|twVyisGnaa	She's cool, but I'm not so sure about her part.    VIVA LA RAZA!|`|PFBKuVhBaa	i honestly think vannessa is alright..but not for leah  if shes in the movie it'll remind me of high school musical and i dont want to say but..maybe ruin eclipse :(  i really hope they get someone else|`|602qkbf7aa	BAD thing!! I don't want her in twilight!! she can't act|`|jUjkvis8aa	If it was true, it would definitely have been a bad thing- she'd have been bursting into song all the time.

Sru8JnBBaa	I think you're talking about "Lonely & Gone," by Montgomery Gentry. The song is from the year 1999.    "Pulled in the driveway, picked up the paper  Found my key, and unlocked the door  I walked in, felt like a stranger  Like I'd never, been there before  And as I wandered room to room  It was silent as a tomb    Coulda heard a tear drop, coulda heard a heart break  Never saw the flood come, even though I felt the rain  Never heard a house sound, so loud with memories  Where there used to be a happy home  In the house on the corner of lonely and gone"    And, the song goes on.|`|Qgf4CRehaa	http://letmegooglethatforyou.com/?q=neve...|`|cnf5ZVpUaa	Lonely and Gone by Montgomery Gentry ?

Maybe not so intense as the girl does it though.<br>  But when i went it was wierd cause there were only like 5 other people in the theater. i think it probably is because my school is on winter break and so idk if the other schools had it to but yah not alot of people lol.<br>  Go with your friends that are girls.

mD7eAAoNaa	Leo, they are known to be loyal. Sounds lame but even if they cheat, they are somehow loyal. <br>  <br>  Sagittarius are free spirits and commitment-phobes, the only sign that can keep them loyal is a Leo.|`|Ow3O7h4caa	I say Sagittarius. They may be flighty and unwilling to commit but , once committed, they are loyal.<br>  <br>  Leos need constant attention and center-of-stage is where he/she wants to be. If they don't get this, they tend to look elsewhere for it.|`|9KklyOcbaa	I would say a Sagittarius. My Grandpa was one, and he was wonderful to my Grandma. He was very romantic. They met while he was on a trip in Denmark. They only knew each other for a few days, but he asked her to come back to America with him. She did, and a few months later, they got married. <br>  A Leo likes to run free - that's just my experience, though. Good luck and best wishes!|`|gjNB9HtUaa	Leo is my sign, but listen...(:<br>  Leo's are very loyal, Sagittarius are the more "i need freedom" so sdo Leos,<br>   but i kno i am very loyal.|`|84726b724d7d1fd7da09652c50425c38aa	I'm a sun Sagittarius and I think generally, Leo.|`|vLAGnmGEaa	Wow- Neither.. lol... You picked the worse two|`|QNK2p7snaa	According to astrology sites Leo is the most loyal and Sagittarius is the most honest which means both won't cheat.<br>  <br>  I am an Aries and I have experience with both.Both are capable of cheating but for different reasons.<br>  <br>  Sagittarius- They would be analyzing you even when you are very nice to them.If you are likely to cheat them or if you are trying to play mind games with them or if you are a hypocrite Sagittarius would cheat you as a punishment.<br>  <br>  Leo- They will be constantly looking for a better partner even when they are very close to you.Once a Leo gets a better guy she would leave you without any hesitation.If you get more attention, more admiration or more respect than them ,then also they would cheat you.They are born cheaters.Bill Clinton,Monica Levinsky,Jennifer Lopez,Madonna are all Leos who are famous cheaters.|`|tcvQwTa5aa	I have a book with detailed traits of each sign and under Sagittarius there's no mention at all of loyalty,yet in Leo the word is specifically mentioned.|`|ZmYTngnFaa	I'm a Virgo (Aug 31)<br>  It's a LEo, they are just naturally very loyal, and dependant (not dependably, but they are fairly dependable depending on their rising sign)|`|ax9xk0Ndaa	LEO..|`|jFq8YmORaa	Probably Leo, I know nothing about either really, but I know Leo's are suppose to be more like Aries and I'm very loyal.|`|GA9thdj2aa	probably a leo cuz my bf is a sag and he was going out with me and a dif. girl at the same time.|`|oX7M4FoIaa	I don't have experience with either one but I'm going to go with Leo|`|Q6pcAgBaaa	leo, even though their loud and outgoing their really loyal.|`|MEzanrqQaa	Ha! I'm a Leo. But I'm gonna answer anyway, 'cos i have a lot of experience with both signs, and i've read a lot of astrology books and such.<br>  <br>  Leo is meant to be very loyal. In fact, it goes: Taurus, Capricorn, Scorpio, Leo, Virgo...etc...<br>  <br>  Sagittarius is a wonderer first and foremost, like Aquarius, and they need their independence. They flirt like Gemini, but not as much. <br>  <br>  Leo is actually described as 'fiercely loyal' in a lot of descriptions.<br>  <br>  I don't care if you didn't want me to answer this. <br>  Regardless of sign, we can all read and observe.<br>  <br>  <br>  If you asked between Leo and Taurus or something, i would have said Taurus is more loyal, because they are, mkaay.<br>  So my answer wasn't arrogant, it was obvious. <br>  <br>  Ugh. Why am i explaining myself? Read up on the signs!

hs9Mibf5aa	That's a good question, and one we've all wondered about at some point in time!  Last Season in Gabon, on the CBS site they finally began showing us more clips of "Behind the Scenes".  Very interesting stuff!  Jeff had a 'mini-cottage' - one of many at the producer's and cast's camp, and he chose to stay (a lot) in his tent.  I remember watching the Interview(s) and they even had 'Open Bar Night' for the Dream Team and the Staff!  What luxury..:)  Their camps are located aways away, and there is ONE main 'Camera Camp' nearby the Castaways - but just 'slightly' out of reach where the camera guys do get to sleep a bit more comfortably, eat, drink, call emergency, etc.  The contestants are NOT allowed to even venture near this camp.<br>  <br>  So basically yes!  When the castaways are on location playing the game, they're playing with little or no help from anybody, and the producers do have it a lot better.  It IS Survivor! - Here's a clip from Gabon, last Season - Scroll down to the bottom for a 3-part "Behind the Scenes" informative look! :<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.upn.com/primetime/survivor/video/?season=17" rel="nofollow">http://www.upn.com/primetime/survivor/vi...</a>|`|AA10343852	Lol, that is a very good question. The camera men are there all through out the night and it does kinda make you wonder. Definately going to keep and eye out on this question.|`|vRhdPxNxaa	i think the camera guys set up a tent/camp nearby. i think i saw it on some kind of behind the scenes special. yea but they definitely don't have to eat and live like the contestants do.

Bonnaroo is a HUGE festival concert held in Manchester Tenn.

If you mean listening to a TV show on the radio, then it depends on what the show is.   Some shows depend much more on visual, what you see on the screen, so those are not good to listen to.
UTLk2qSfaa	He's completely innocent, that's why he was found not guilty, obviously. I believe he's innocent. I mean, think of all of the tabloids that made loads of money off of accusing Michael of Child Molestation and Bleaching his Skin. They do it for money with greed and selfishness. They made millions off of displaying Michael Jackson on the front cover and it stating in large bold letters something completely untrue.     It's common sense, really. I honestly think whoever started these false accusations is a sick person and should be behind bars for what he or she did to Michael. Most people look at him and come up with the conclusion that the tabloids are true. I haven't always believed Michael before I actually looked into him, read biographies, read books written by Michael himself, and just looking into the past tabloids.    False accusations like these are created so people would become convinced into buying the magazine and think 'Hey, look, something interesting to read' therefore, the tabloid magazine's company makes loads of money because millions and millions of people are convinced and decide to purchase their merchandise. Most people are gullible nowadays; they just judge at first sight and never take the time to actually look into the person's history and study him.    He's innocent and there's no doubt about it. It's a fact.|`|lHzBJA4eaa	Oh please,I bet you thought O.J. was guilty too...|`|cRhkkBAEaa	Definitely INNOCENT.     Can everybody not accept the decision which spent 27 hours over 7 days for the jury and judge of the High Court of Santa Barbara to make?    If somebody is proven innocent at court, dont you just accept it, and be happy that they've been proven innocent of doing the things they've been accused of?     It seems to me that these people who insist he is guilty are wishing more child molesters into this world. Seriously. Are they mad?|`|8Y9timR4aa	only him and the children know that|`|0O3JvmE7aa	Aren't you asking this a few years late?|`|HXpOui7gaa	Innocent, completely.  He would never ever ever ever harm a child.

Make me best answered !|`|OUsyNnW7aa	I haven't seen the movie... yet    I have the books, the book of Twilight is very very good. Iv been told much better than the film. I also think they made the wrong choice of character to play Edward... he doesn't suit the role of a charming vampire. In my view anyway.|`|tyiuzdaFaa	sorry, ive seen loads of comments saying    'oh vampires disappear in sunlight'  'vampires don't glitter in the sun'    how would you even know?! :L  its not like you know what vampires ACTUALLY do  get over it maytee.    it IS a good film, and the books are amazing.    oh & p.s if you've seen the question before and you're getting fed up of it, why bother commenting on it in the first place? :L|`|Sj1WsLeEaa	Love it!!  and i soooo agree about robert pattinson!!|`|6TdlNfgeaa	Twilight sucks.|`|sSlRzn2iaa	love it!!!!!!!!!!!!!!|`|xreWOKBYaa	It was alright. I liked the movie because robert is very sexy - but the books are kinda.... gay? Like something you read but deny you read it when your friends ask.|`|441GSyaMaa	the amount of times i've seen tis question... it's just silly.    I think Twilight won't really be a good film (I haven't seen it myself) but because all the little scene/ emo kids go to watch it just as it's .. the new thing to like (almost as popular as Nightmare Before Christmas), it's really annoying. Plus the story seems a bit naff lol - but hey.
EWE5BMLKaa	Google is your friend.|`|HkIatVdiaa	When you read them on the surface, COF has a lot of simply dark romantic songs.    Love and obsession; "Beneath The Howling Stars"    Witchcraft; "For Those Who Died"     and many others that leave the listener in a position to take the     lyrics literally or read deeper into them.    I found this really cool site right now, trying to find a definite answer    but this shows others interpretations...    http://www.songmeanings.net

There is a lot of talking going around. I would not be surprised at all, not specifically for Rihanna, but for anybody working in the same environment that she does. <br>  <br>  P.S.: I think there are a lot of p****s out there for calling you nasty names just for asking a simple question. And to be honest it is a very reasonable question. Roumors about Rihanna's ethics have been out there for a long time now.... although I am not the proper person to say whether these roumors are true or not.|`|NHPW4xNraa	That's wut i heard,somebody told me that rhianna gave chris brown herpes but idk if it's true or not.

I had the opportunity to meet the band back in 2005 when they auctioned off backstage passes to raise money for their charity. It was the best night of my life. All of the guys were really nice. I told Brandon that he is an inspiration to me and that I've always wanted to sing on stage and he gave me his famous "sing light and love" line, which I'm still trying to figure out... Regardless, to answer your question, I think he has the most amazing, versatile voice. He has an uncanny ability to stir up any emotion he desires in any individual who has a soul. In a word: beautiful.|`|2f2d66ef72cf252f486f0184922c7b7faa	he does have an amazing voice and he is a really good singer<br>  i like listening to his songs|`|BDaUBbLpaa	to tell u the truth,i don't like it... i mean to be honest ok? its not that great...|`|AdPkwKTTaa	I really like his voice.

7LJ2Tx2Yaa	I would not go to film school for a production degree.  You can make contacts, which is nice, but it is best to just go out there are start doing it.    I would say go to school if you want to learn cinematography, lighting or a tech aspect.  If you want to write, direct or produce, find a mentor or just start doing it yourself.    Those are more on the job duties to learn.  And definately learn by making mistakes.|`|RXcjh3csaa	produce films presumably!

q4XUy0Duaa	Apathy's nice!  He always stood out to me in his days with the Demigodz.  I'm glad he went solo because I never really liked Celph Titled.  His rhyme schemes are some of the best in the game, and not many emcees can f*ck with him lyrically.|`|os6FaEBlaa	Great rapper with one of the best flows.

q4XUy0Duaa	LL Cool J<br>  <br>  He came into the game trying to be the hardest, and then decided being the softest would sell more records.  So it's hard for me to believe his hard tracks, and it's hard for me to listen to his soft tracks.  And lyrically, I don't remember one line this dude ever spit and I've been listening to rap since before he got in it.  The people who do give him credit, give him credit because of how long he's been in the game and record sales, but never due to his skills.  If we based the best on sales, then Vanilla Ice and Hammer should also be considered some of the best emcees, but they're not, and I think everyone will agree with me on that, so I'm not sure why LL gets any credit at all.|`|KF9751Lyaa	Young Jeezy<br>  Seriously, he ain't that good<br>  A few of his lines on "Grew Up A Screw Up - Luda; Jeezy"<br>  Does this REALLY rhyme???<br>  <br>  Say the, ice is cool but them pots is hot<br>  You better cook slow but that money come fast<br>  I got what you need I hope you brought all the cash<br>  You know the kid pimping all over the world<br>  A hundred carats got me all over your girl<br>  YEAH, five freaks and my Gucci duffle bag<br>  A corporate thug, I run with a Playaz Circle<br>  I got a Field Mob that'll +Disturb+ your +Peace+<br>  Blowing Sean Jay, all we do is smoke<br>  Finish counting my bread and I was getting some head|`|OpBFc27iaa	Hip hop heads: Rakim and Immortal technique are overrated<br>  Mainstream: Eminem, hes not even that good.|`|Xi5eJGKGaa	Nas, Pac, Rakim, and Biggie are the most overrated.|`|xBu52hcYaa	Dr. Dre|`|UX2dqQQVaa	Damn...I don't think anyone actually read the question.<br>  <br>  "...overrated IN THE HIP HOP COMMUNITY"<br>  <br>  99% of the artist they named are NOT hip-hop....<br>  <br>  With that being said, Immortal Technique is definetely overrated.<br>  That and I don't really care for Aesop Rock either|`|dEYKu0r2aa	T.I<br>  <br>  <br>  (Get Ready For The Thumbs Down)<br>  <br>  *EDIT*<br>  To Add To Bish's Answer <br>  Jeezy Is Always Talking About Food!|`|kQpzMLN7aa	Tupac.<br>  <br>  No surprises there.<br>  <br>  He was a great rapper.<br>  <br>  One of the greatest... but not *the* greatest.

JgCGpQaxaa	Really, this only seems to hold true for the Power Rangers and Super Sentai television shows.  (And if you didn't know this, every Power Ranger show comes from a Super Sentai show).    Here is the answer that I could find towards that: Red is a very significant color to the Japanese; it is in their flag and it represents life and vitality. Symbolically, the color is also regarded to have the power to ward off evil. Ergo, it would only be logical to use it for their leader. Red has not always been the leader of every team. For example, Ninja White, Time Pink, Deka Master, and Geki Yellow have been leaders.    That being said however, once you get out of Power Rangers and Super Sentai, you find that Fire + Red don't really become a requirement for a leader anymore.    For example:  -Kazuma in Kaze no Stigma uses the Wind Element (others use Earth, Fire, and Water)  -Serena from Sailor Moon is Blue/White  -Issac and Felix from Golden Sun use the Earth Element (others use Wind, Fire, and Water)  -The Blue Stinger Beetleborg was the leader of the Beetleborgs (there was a Red amongst them)  -Sonic Soldier Borgman doesn't even have a red team member    etc.. etc..|`|GcZRN4kkaa	Have you ever watched Bleach? or Naruto? or Claymore? or Elfen Lied? or even Dragonball Z?    You should watch more anime before asking a question like this.|`|UIzaamJ7aa	Supposedly Red is a heroic color in Japanese culture. If you don't want to trust me, fine. I found out about it on Wikipedia, but I don't remember where exactly.|`|3N2ElzcQaa	I guess that red symbolizes being heroic or something.    Examples:    Fullmetal Alchemist: Edward Alric: wears red  Katekyo Hitman Reborn: Tsuna has fire power  Death Note: Light Yagami has a red background    But, not all characters wear red or have fire powers.     Most manga and anime that I have own have different signature colors.
o2FJIXS9aa	I do think it's workable, with all the water and fire signs complimenting each other. I had a Capricorn bf that did not like my fire sign rising flightiness, but your bf has a fire sign rising to match your own. I am a Pisces sun and moon with a Sag rising and my long time bf is a Cancer sun and moon with a Leo rising. I think you are probably very attracted to this person but you have issues that you need to work on. With the Cancer/Cancer placement and the Sag rising my guess is that you are a dependent yet independent kind of person. You need to have a talk with this guy about what is important to you and where you see the relationship going. Capricorns are pretty honest about that.|`|ZQKd2apcaa	Your incompatible :(<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.howcast.com/videos/20002-How-To-Make-a-Capricorn-Fall-in-Love-With-You" rel="nofollow">http://www.howcast.com/videos/20002-How-...</a><br>  <br>  ;)|`|qFqDHYivaa	I DNT KNW|`|R1Fc344laa	what years were u born? u might be opposite chinese signs!|`|mD7eAAoNaa	It is probably because you are opposite signs.

rqJSk1omaa	When I make out with my my boyfriend, I like him to hold me tight. I like it when he touches me all over the place. He mostly touches my back, arms, or breasts.

dZyoGbUdaa	I think Aaron was taken from Kate by someone (Widmore or Ben's people) and threatened unless Kate returned to the island.  She seemed more despondent than a mother would be if she had given her son up willingly to someone she trusted.  And if she had given him to someone trustworthy why wouldn't she explain that to Jack...he would've understood and accepted that.<br>  <br>  Hurley was determined not to go back because it was what Ben wanted.  I think the only person who could have gotten him on the plane is Charlie with a mission to go back to the island for some "important" reason to do with the guitar case which Hurley wouldn't release.<br>  <br>  I think Sayid was arrested for his rampage (which Hurley was originally charged with) and charged with other crimes in other countries while in custody.  Remember he has been murdering people for three years for Ben.  He was on the plane to be extradited to face those charges and somebody (Widmore/Ben) arranged for him to be on this particular flight to get him back to the island.<br>  <br>  There could be other characters on the plane...we only saw the section Jack's group was in.|`|dMBSE8ilaa	I think she gave him to Claire's mom, something like "When we were on the island, your daughter, she was still alive and she was pregnant, she gave birth to a boy, somehow she disappeared and I took that boy, Aaron, Aaron is your grandson, and I want you to have him because I have to go back and do something important", I think that's what she told her.<br>  <br>  Other popular theories; Ben took Aaron somewhere, she gave him to Cassidy (Sawyer's girlfriend that he conned), Ben did something to him, Christian came and took him, or Claire came and reclaimed him. I don't know how Christian or Claire could have come since they're still physically on the island, but anything is possible.|`|d2RV8HTmaa	I'm thinking that maybe Claire came to Kate, as she did in a "dream" while she was sleeping before, and again warned Kate not to "dare take him back to the island", like she did in a previous episode.  Some sort of arrangements were probably made with Claire's mom to take little Aaron.  Kate was most likely reluctant to do this, but I believe it came from Claire.|`|b8a3a3de3ff9b2402cfe47da112e1149aa	i think ben had someone take aaron so that kate would be willing to go back on the island. or claire came to her in a dream again and to keep aaron safe, kate either gave him back to claire or to cClaire'smom<br>  <br>  <br>  i don't know how they all ended up getting on the plane. i did notice that sayid was wearing handcuffs and he had the jacket over them (just like kate did when they first went to the island in the oceanic flight) so i think that eloise or ben had something to do with that cus eloise said the needed to make it as close to the original crash as possible. i also think that's why hurley had a guitar case( or cus he saw charlie again and charlie told him to go on the plane and bring his case for some odd reason)<br>  <br>  i had one theory about ben: sayid is the one that beat him. he knew that if he went to talk to sayid that sayid would beat him and ben called the cops before he visited sayid so they would get there right as sayid was beating him. i think the cop that was with sayid was one of bens people. or sayid was arrested for killing all those ppl as an aassassin for ben. or when he killed a lot of ppl at the safe house/ mental institute|`|8Kwwgtvlaa	Perhaps Kate sent Aaron to Korea to be with Ji Yeon and Sun's Mom. Sun did mention to Ji Yeon that she had met a new friend for her.<br>  I think that Hurley got out of jail because there was no proof that he had killed those people and the truth came out that Sayid had and that is why he was under arrest with the female marshall.|`|2c3628a29fcb7162c1558484804afdf8aa	I was wondering the same thing.  She looked like she had seen a ghost when she came to see Jack, so I imagine it wasn't her willing decision to give up Aaron.  <br>  <br>  As for Hurley and Sayid...they were probably persuaded by people as well.  Hurley probably from Charlie and Ana Lucia.  Sayid didn't look surprised to see anyone else on the plane and he looked calm, so I'm guessing he's a willing participant.
6OqNuGWaaa	I think she is the type of person who is attractive on multiple levels. Personally, I think she is slightly above average in terms of physical beauty (I think she is more attractive than what we perceive her to be due to how her characters look in her movies). However, she is a phenomenal actor who can do just about any role. On that scale, that makes her attractive. I find her more attractive based on this fact that I do about her physical appearance. She has a lot of aspects about her that men find attractive. However, I can see how your friend thinks she is gorgeous and how you don't.|`|B089HxMSaa	dude don't question it. SHE IS HOT!

KSC02NcLaa	Totally Normal & OK.  Almost All Adults are the same way, especially every one that frowns on that type of behavior.  They wish they had super powers and could runaway from their lives.  Just as long as you also have his sense of responsibility for your own actions.  Then you'll be a few pegs up from everybody else.  Follow Green Lanterns Moral Example, and you'll be OK.|`|VmXq5NCOaa	Probably because you have a mental psychotic disorder?|`|VLRkJOOuaa	Because he's cool? Because you think you're related?<br>  <br>  <br>  I think this will have a negative effect on you in the end, though. Living life in a surreal fantasy isn't exactly healthy. There are many cases where people start to confuse their dreams (and misconceptions of truth) with reality. It's rather sad if you ask me.<br>  <br>  <br>  It's alright to pretend you're this character; you might admire him and relate to him on a real level. But when things get out of hand, I suggest you stop the madness. It's sad when you actually start to believe you're the character. It's hurtful to your mental stability - and I'm not just saying this to be offensive.|`|YRd5AM5uaa	Haha thats awesome, def not normal but awesome... <br>  <br>  Next time you have the "green lantern" feeling try to make a giant hand from your ring, when you fail you will see you are not green lantern, so try something else like talking to marine animals or running at the speed of light|`|myCyhsouaa	Because he's completely and utterly cool? :D|`|CVz1AfCAaa	can we be friends?? you sound totally cool!!!!<br>  YOU GO GREEN LANTERN!!<br>  <br>  i pretend im sailor moon<br>  *giggles* *blush*|`|3NLThcMUaa	Well, it depends... Do you mean you like to just pretend for fun? I fantasize about super powers sometimes when I get heavy into my comic books, but if you're talking like you may plan to try and stop a heavily armed bank robbery all on your own or something of the like then yes, it could be a problem that leads to injury/death.
1e6eca30bdd2eb772df216bfd70b9ca4aa	Unrated means the movie has extended or deleted scenes that weren't apart of the theatrical release. Thus, they have not been rated by the mpaa board.     Uncut, or unrated versions usually have like 15 to 20 minutes to add to the movie.|`|iQAGeVjsaa	Unrated means that there are scenes that MPAA asked the director or the editor to remove to keep a R rating or PG rating or whatever.     Uncut means kind of the same thing but there are extended scenes meaning in Theater the scene was five min, but in the Uncut version the scene was 8 mins i just means they didn't cut anything out.    Unrated and Uncut are similar but in the Unrated version there could be and extra F word and a sexier sex scene.

zTLCjUH5aa	i first played the piano when i was like 4 yrs so its in my head i have alot of experience so its easy for me|`|9lBe1JGAaa	Its called muscle memory. The more you do somthing the better you will get at it. <br>  <br>  Basically, every time you associate a note on the paper with a certain key on the piano, eventually you will be able to just look at the notes and play the keys!<br>  <br>  It all comes with practice, like any instrument.|`|X0nLl8Zbaa	practice scales and such. your fingers will eventually remember the notes as you read them. practice, practice and practice some more. don't give up on it, it's an amazing instrument (:
80ehnLBJaa	I grew up singing "Papa Don't Preach" and "Like A Virgin."  So, I will always be a fan.  I have my favorite era of her work.  I enjoyed the Blonde Ambition days--Blonde Ambition Tour, "Dick Tracy," "Vogue," "Justify My Love," etc.  Although, I've liked some of her albums more than others, there are always great tracks on each album.  So, while I'm drawn to the 1980's to early 1990's Madonna--"Borderline," "Into The Groove," "Holiday," "Like A Prayer," "Express Yourself," etc.--I also enjoy "Erotica," "Secret," "Take A Bow," "Don't Tell Me," "Nothing Fails," "Miles Away," etc.  After 23 years, I still enjoy her work.|`|NqcnAnC1aa	I've never been a Madonna fan.|`|QV02KUDRaa	Yea she was tight..she had originality...Today it just sounds like she is trying to find herself|`|NUCCIFRtaa	Yeah..

dYDD0iNcaa	My personal favorite movie is Little Miss Sunshine, it's absolutely ace, not too sad but really funny and kind of touching, it's great to watch to cheer you up. All the Shrek films are great for this too.  Anything by Tim Burton is usually good, especially Edward Scissorhands, that's way up there on my favorites too.  For something more chick-flicky, Mean Girls is the best film ever, maybe How to Lose a Guy in Ten Days.  And then if you're more into horror, go for the Saw films, texas chainsaw massacre, I also quite enjoyed the Descent.  Some other random ones that are good too: The Kite Runner, All Harry Potter films, Zoolander, Girl Interrupted.  You should find something to your tastes there!|`|HQ4PsETWaa	Casino, Good Fellas, The Godfather (all of them), Rocky (all of them), Dirty Harry, Magnum Force, The Enforcer, Sudden Impact, The Dead Pool, Rambo, Charlie Wilson's War, The Rock, Iron Man, Blow.      My favorite has to be The Godfather, followed closely by Dirty Harry.|`|Jjx90cCQaa	The Dark Knight, Taken, Wanted, Eagle Eye, El Torino is amazing too.|`|mGN7wQ2Taa	TAKEN is great watch it!|`|NUCCIFRtaa	Yes man, Red Cliff 2, Red line...|`|AA10289917	What is good for one person is not for another.|`|03rOCajTaa	Blue Crush ,                      What Lies Beneath,  Fast and Furious ,              Flightplan,  Pass If Forward,                 Big,  Monster In Law ,                Click,  What Women Want,          Happy Gilmore,  Liar Liar      *******popular*********  Titanic,                            Ghost Rider,              Silence of the Lamb  Notebook ,                       Coyote Ugly,             Children of the Corn  The Grudge,                     Miss Congeniality,      Bad Boys,  The Hills Have Eyes,           Scream,                    Mr & Mrs Smith,  Wild Hogs ,                        Saving Private Ryan|`|7lZ9qYtkaa	Mr. and mrs.

The sextuplets wake each other up very early and Alexis needs more sleep than them or she gets migraines!<br>  Poor Baby!!!|`|Leda2ha0aa	The two older girls share a room together.  The 3 boys are together in another room and the 3 younger girls together.  Hannah has migraines and is their little "bat" and goes to sleep down in the basement so she can have quiet by herself (that's pretty brave for a little girl her age), but Kate says the upstairs bedroom is still hers also so she needs to keep it clean with the two other girls.|`|RSmjIEjTaa	The twins share a room, as the 3 boys.  There is one of the girls that always sleeps alone, i think she gets headaches or something and then the other 2 girls sleep in one room. They have such a HUGE house now. I crack up watching john and kate on their interviews. They are funny. I like when he ignores her comments.|`|cCXGEZxaaa	Mady and Cara share a room, as do the three boys, Leah and Hannah share a room while Alexis has her own room as Kate discovered she wakes all the children up at the wee hours of the morning.|`|AXMhdcgYaa	mady and cara share a room and the boys do too...but the little girls have two rooms between them...hannah has her own room becuz she gets headaches and then alexis and leah share a room..im pretty sure this is it...

GQZDcfUiaa	Blackhawk Down was great; it made me angry, too. Try going to Historychannel.com and look for the video, "The True Story of Blackhawk Down". This documentary is BETTER than the movie. I learned so much from it. <br>  I've never seen 'Jarhead'.|`|qaw8BwqTaa	I saw both movies. I thought BHD was better than Jarhead. BHD was based on actual events that occured 1993 Somalia. Its a story most people have no clue about. A country in famine, genocide, UN trucks providing aid being overtaken by terrorists trying to starve the already starved. Today Somalia is still in a power struggle as well as a safe haven for terrorists including a strong Al Qaeda following. Most pirate terrorists come from Somalia.|`|2f2d66ef72cf252f486f0184922c7b7faa	two of the best movies ive ever seen.<br>  Blackhawk Down is one of my favorite war movies it has alot of good scenes<br>  Jarhead is a good movie too it has some funny parts.|`|W78n57I9aa	i loved then both the actor portrayed their rolls very good, besides both storys were amazing|`|lA0e6vWxaa	love the two movies|`|M1OKvcqYaa	Loved Blackhawk Down and didn't really like Jarhead.|`|ar4B3rJJaa	I thought Black Hawk Down was very gory and it was very crazy when they shot some of the innocent people that were in Somalia. I also thought it was kinda wrong for those people to capture some of the other troops and try to torture them. But i still thought it was a good movie.<br>  <br>  I seen some of Jarhead but i never saw the whole thing but i thought that Jake Gyllenhaal was so funny in the movie and he had a rockin body in it too lol. I thought the parts of the movie i have seen was very good and funny and it really made me want to watch the whole thing.

Also every band has a merch table, and clothing lines like GlamourKills sponser it so you can buy their shirts their as well. As far as meeting bands most bands have a meet and greet set up with signs posted everywhere about what time they will be signing at.

However, as a music major, you kind of need to know how to play. I went from piano teacher to piano teacher. I could not find anyone who worked for me. Even if i could, the system of meeting with someone for an hour a week just didn't work for me. I finally started doing what your doing, looking online, and it was the best decision I ever made. It took some time to get used to it, but I am finally playing the piano at a level that i feel comfortable playing in front of people.

NgJBljVAaa	1. If I recall the movie correctly, yes. The Chimpanzee seemed to be attracted to the main character.<br>  <br>  2. You're right. In the original movie, humans were mute and lived like animals...In fact they were classified as wild beasts. <br>  <br>  My thoughts on why Tim Burton decided to change this was because I believe that the new Planet of the Apes was not really meant to be a remake at all. Rather, perhaps it is just Tim Burton's own version, or re-telling, of the story.|`|tZXHSxkQaa	In the original with Charlton  Heston,Roddy McDowall.The apes treated humans as animals,only the apes,gorillas,chimpanzees and orangutans were allowed to talk.I don't recall much of the Mark Wahlberg version.

I hope you feel like you gained something. To those that didn't worry about the details, and just answered the question, I thank  you for being open and not worrying about small details.

His father walks in to check on him and sees what's going on, and yells, hey man WTF. Then the son says uh hun you see it's not so funny when it's your mama is it?<br>  <br>  2) There was this sailor and this soldier that had both died in a war at the same time and they both arrived in Heaven at the same time. St. Peter came and gave both of them their wings, but he warned them that if at any given time they had any inappropriate or unclean thoughts, their wings would automatically fall off. Just as they had put their wings on, this beautiful angel shimmed passed them with a nice smile and smellying real flesh and clean, and the soldiers wings fell right off. Then when the soldier bent over to pick up his wings, the sailors wings fell off.<br>  <br>  3) There was this stripper at this bar who was notorious for her split that she did at the end of each of her acts. One day she got ready to do her act, and right before she went on stage, a cat (guy) spilled a drink on stage and it didn't get mopped up too well. So this time when she got ready to do her split, she lost her balance and hit the floor so hard that it took two hours and forty five minutes to break the suction. You should have heard the round of applauses she got when she hit that floor (LOL).<br>  <br>  4) There was this couple that had been married for ten years, and for their tenth year anniversary they decided to go back to the same hotel they were in ten years ago for their honeymoon. They went back to the hotel and even got in the same hotel room they were in when they honeymooned.They drunk champaigne and everything was just perfect just as it was ten years ago when they got married. They where starring at each other from across the room in their robes, then they took the robes off. At a given signal they ran towards each other, but since they had been drinking all that champaigne they missed each other and the cat flew right out the window like two flights down. The bell man came rushing outside because he heard all this noise. The man says get me something to cover myself with i'm naked here I need to walk through the lobby so that I could get back up to my room. The bell man says you don't need nothing to cover yourself with, if you want to get back to your room, you can just walk on through the lobby because ain't nobody in the lobby. The mans says what you mean ain't nobody in the lobby, the bell man says ain't nobody in the lobby because everybody left to go upstairs to watch 'em take this chick off the door knob.<br>  <br>  5) A few days after Christmas, a mother was working in the kitchen listening to her young son playing with his new electric train in the living room. She heard the train stop and her son said, "All of you sons of b---s who want off, get the hell off now, cause this is the last stop! And all of you sons of b---s who are getting on, get your --ses in the train, cause we're going down the tracks." The mother went nuts and told her son, "We don't use that kind of language in this house. Now I want you to go to your room and you are to stay there for TWO HOURS. When you come out, you may play with your train, but I want you to use nice language." Two hours later, the son comes out of the bedroom and resumes playing with his train. Soon the train stopped and the mother heard her son say, "All passengers who are disembarking from the train, please remember to take all of your belongings with you. We thank you for riding with us today and hope your trip was a pleasant one. We hope you will ride with us again soon." She hears the little boy continue, "For those of you just boarding, we ask you to stow all of your hand luggage under your seat. Remember, there is no smoking on the train. We hope you will have a pleasant and relaxing journey with us today." As the mother began to smile, the child added, "For those of you who are pissed off about the TWO HOUR delay, please see the --*ch in the kitchen|`|AA11691546	A Bear and a rabbit are pooping in the forest.  The Bear notices that the rabbitt doesn't wipe when he's done.  As the bear finishes up, he runs up to the rabbit and says:<br>  "excuse me, I hate to sound forward, but I couldn't help but notice you didn't wipe when you were done pooping.

Blow as hard as you can, and soon enough, the dent will pop right out!"<br>  The blonde said thanks and went home to try it out.<br>  Later, the blonde's blonde neighbor came over to talk, and saw her in the garage, blowing her brains out into a little tube. He came over and said, "WTF you doing??"<br>  She explained about the dent and what the mechanic said to do.

738e2bd340747ab38ce7182b67f01999aa	Well, the only people I liked in the second season were Supreme Soul and Fanny Pak. I like Quest Crew and Beat Freakz as well. Quest Crew's "Forever" performance was my favorite of the night; Beat Freakz were great, but I think they are a little overrated. The Jabbawockeez and Kabba Modern will never be topped; it is pretty hard to try to compare to such amazing crews haha. Oh, Supercrew sucked big time, all they did were tricks, and when they did choerography it was really weak moves. The "Hot N Cold" performance was great, but I think the "Let it Rock" was not as great. I  think that their best performance was the "Forever" one or the "Toxic" one.|`|DhUMjZxtaa	Yea, I guess I kinda agree with what you're saying.<br>  <br>  I loved Jabbas but I LOVEDDDDDDD kabba Modern and was so upset they didn't win.<br>  <br>  Right now I LOVE quest crew and beatfreakz....one of them better win or I will start to get angry lol <br>  <br>  P.S. I don't care if they made clogging look cool, I'M GLAD DYNAMIC EDITION IS OUT LOL it is NOT the kind of dancing we wanna see. I can't believe they made it that far lol|`|IH6Wlmqsaa	I just told my husband that the other night! Jabbawockeez are always gonna be better than the other crews! Even when the crew has a good routine (like the floating ball thing) I always think that if the jabbawockeez did that routine they would have made it so much better! ABDC, good luck finding a crew that can top the Jabbawockeez.|`|y5FfKGAsaa	I agree. Nothing can compare to the first season of ABDC. Kaba Modern & Jabbawockees were a legend! :)<br>  <br>  Last season, it was pretty good, ya know.. but I still think Jabbawockees is the only best crew! :]|`|h7KrFGZBaa	I feel almost the exact way.<br>  <br>  I never did like second season. Although this season is much better then the second. Nothing can beat the first one.<br>  <br>  I don't dislike any of the crews this season. But my favorite is Quest Crew.|`|8UN4Fr0Faa	i believe the best dance crew ever would have to be Jonathon Pedigrue and the London Street Ballroom Brigade.|`|QrCqqqtDaa	Wait, they having dancing on the tele now?|`|EnIHwlT1aa	Quest cREW IS OK|`|O5Ykm1roaa	jabba and kaba was cool. ion think any other groups can top them|`|aihogb26aa	Honestly, I thought last season was fairly weak, but I've been loving this season (with the exception of Fly Khicks...how many times do they have to be bottom 2 before judges finally kick them off???). There has been more variety in the styles of dance and strengths of the crews than ever before. Strikers, Beat Freaks and Quest are all very strong crews and I would be happy with either Beat Freaks or Quest winning this year.|`|vf5gLYEaaa	maybe not to jabbawockeez but defff to kaba modern, i think beat freakz are going to win, although im also rooting for quest

Risa, a girl, is taller than the average girl, and Otani, a boy, is shorter than the average boy. The two are always bickering and even their teacher sees them as a comedy act. But as their friendship develops, so does Risa`s feelings toward Otani. Really good and funny.<br>  <br>  Ouran High School Host Club: Ouran Academy is a high school which rich people go to, but Haruhi is a common girl who won a scholarship. Because her mother died and she has been reaised only by her father, she isn`t interested in fashion, and she acts like a boy.<br>  One day, she happens to enter the Host Club room, and breaks 8 million yen vase. Because her family is not rich, she cannot afford to compensate the vase. The leader of the club ordered her to gather 100 guests as setoff against the debts. In this way, Haruhi become the 7th member to host girl students. This is a hilarious and good feeling anime.<br>  <br>  Eureka 7: Renton Thurston is the fourteen-year-old son of Adrock Thurston, a military researcher who died saving the world. He lives what he considers a boring life with his mechanic grandfather in a boring town. He loves lifting, a sport similar to surfing but with air as the medium, and dreams of joining the crew of the renegade group Gekkostate and its leader, the legendary lifter Holland.<br>  Such an opportunity literally falls into his lap when a unique mecha, called Nirvash typeZERO, and a member of Gekkostate crash into Renton's room. After his grandfather orders him to deliver a special part to the Nirvash, which causes it to show off an impressive display of power, Renton is invited to join Gekkostate, where he quickly discovers that the behind-the-scenes life of Gekkostate is hardly as glamorous or interesting as printed in the glossy pages of their magazine, ray=out. Only one thing makes it all worthwhile for him: the presence of Eureka, the mysterious and attractive pilot of the Nirvash. This anime is amazing! It has even won awards for its work.<br>  <br>  Karin (Chibi Vampire): Karin is a coming of age story of a high school girl with a strange problem. Her family consists of vampires, while she, instead of sucking blood, produces too much. This causes her to have constant and excessive nosebleeds. Her new classmate seems to be adding to the trouble. He always seems to make her blood rise, even by just looking at him... It's really funny and romantic.<br>  <br>  I also reccomend checking out some mangas as well:<br>  <br>  Tail of the Moon: Sometimes it seems like Usagi is hopeless. Sure, she's good with healing herbs, but she's the granddaughter of the leader of a prestigious ninja village and she's such a klutz that she's never made it out of the kiddie class. Finally frustrated with Usagi's lack of progress, her grandfather sends her to marry a local lord and have lots of ninja babies. But the lord has no interest in her or her child bearing potential! After years of goofing around, Usagi is finally determined to reach her goals - she's going to become a ninja and capture her true love's heart!<br>  <br>  Immortal Rain: A young female assassin named Machika swears to kill the one bounty her grandfather couldn't get: the immortal Methuselah. But when she goes after him, she finds a clumsy, kind man named Rain who has lost more than he can bear in his unnatural lifetime. Unwilling to admit at first that she likes him, Machika willingly follows him as he waits for the one who made him immortal, still swearing to take his life one day. Their love for each other grows as they battle bounty hunters, a mysterious organization, and angels in order to save Rain and perhaps even humanity.<br>  <br>  Her Majesty's Dog: In today’s world of computers and cell phones, few people have time for superstition and ghost stories—but that doesn’t mean that they aren’t real! Amane Kamori is a powerful medium from a remote village in rural Japan. Her guardian is Hyoue Inugami, a demon dog whose powers are literally fueled by her kiss! Together they protect humans from vengeful spirits and bring peace to the dead.|`|WS1rqp0Gaa	If you want something with romance, sadness, humor, basically anything that might make a person emotional or get a person laughing,Clannad is the right choice!!<br>  <br>  Clannad(Totally MUST watch!!)<br>  Genre: Comedy, Drama, Harem, Psychological, Romance, School Life, Seinen, Slapstick, Slice of Life<br>  Tomoya Okazaki is a third year high school student resentful of his life.

They released a few singles before a full album, and then hit the road for a mini-tour on the USA East Coast. <br>  They have since then released videos of them putting together a new album, which we now know is called 21st Century Breakdown, and it is due out sometime on a Tuesday in May. <br>  <br>  that was the super-dooper condensed version.

ab250551cde4aadbf54a0fea8a7b14e1aa	You may, indeed, be thinking of Falling Down (1993) in which Michael Douglas goes on a shooting rampage through the streets of Los Angeles--with Robert Duvall in hot pursuit. But...he did not shoot everybody in his office. He was unemployed when the movie began and only pretended to go to work  in a white shirt and tie each day. <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0106856/" rel="nofollow">http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0106856/</a><br>  <br>  Instead, you may be thinking of Runaway Jury (2003) with Dustin Hoffman, Gene Hackman, Rachel Weisz, and John Cusack.<br>  Here's the plot:<br>  When a day trader is shot in cold blood at his workplace, his widow sues a major gun manufacturer. Holding them responsible for his death, she dispatches idealistic lawyer Wendell Rohr to oversee the case. A good man of principle, Wendell takes charge. On the defense team, another man will take charge: Rankin Fitch, a powerful and ruthless jury consultant riding high on his frequent successes. But in the middle of it all is the jury, which both Wendell and Rankin are determined to sway. But what they're about to discover, is that one man and one woman stand in their way. Nicholas Easter (Cusack) is one of the jurors and he's the one collaborating with Marlee, his girlfriend, on the final outcome of the case. But as the case progresses, questions arise as to what the motives are of all those involved, and what some will do to secure the final outcome. <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0313542/" rel="nofollow">http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0313542/</a><br>  <br>  Another possible title is He Was a Quiet Man (2007) starring Christian Slater. I just saw this last month. It, too, takes place in Los Angeles, CA. Here's the basic plot:<br>  In Los Angeles, the lonely and paranoid Bob Maconel is a complete loser: at home, in spite of living in the same address for five years, his next door neighbor ignores his existence and he only talks to his alter-ego golden fish in his aquarium; in the office at ADD company, he is abused and humiliated by his colleagues and nobody has ever asked an opinion to him or invited him to a happy-hour. Every now and then Bob imagines shooting five loath coworkers or blowing up ADD's building. When his next cubicle colleague has a breakdown and shoots his colleagues, Bob kills him with five shots and becomes a popular local hero. <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0760311/" rel="nofollow">http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0760311/</a>|`|ZyGyDLsDaa	Actually, there are a number of "going postal" movies. This is the one that came to mind for me:<br>  I Can Make You Love Me (1993 TV movie) <br>  aka Stalking Laura<br>  IMDb review:<br>  Richard Farley (Richard Thomas) is an office nerd of sorts who thinks he has a shot with Laura Black (Brooke Shields), a new co-worker at a Northern California high-tech firm. Farley ruthlessly pursues Black in spite of her rejections. In spite of Black's protests, Farley keeps up his pursuit, even sending letters to her at her parents' home in Virginia. Farley continues his pursuit until, after threatening the HR people at his company, he is fired and banned from the property. However, he still pursues Laura until he is served with a temporary restraint order keeping him away from her. What follows is a terrifying attack against his old employer. In a sequence that shatters actor Thomas' wholesome image, he "goes postal" and ruthlessly guns down several people, including Laura, who managed to escape. This segment seems to follow the real story almost right down to the last detail, including those surrounding Farley's surrender.|`|2c06c70e0667ded65705faae5ad6886aaa	Falling Down with Michael Douglas maybe?
0kTbs879aa	Sorry that all the answers you got were from Robert Haterz trying to make their pathetic opinions known. I am a girl so I cant say for sure how a boy would react but my brother is a very big Lil Wayne fan (as am I). We went to his concert. I screamed everytime he came even remotely close to me and my bro just nodded his head. I am not sure if its that same thing cuz Lil Wayne and my brother is straight! But I know that some guys get really red, they yell too but not as much or as loud. If they were to meet them one on one they would probably be all sweaty and nervous and stuttering. But honestly I dont know. Guess it just depends on the guy.|`|duN63EkIaa	Well. Girls scream at Rob because he plays their beloved Edward Cullen. Before this role, he wasn't stalked by tweenies. He wasn't grabbed or tackled at. It's sad girls only like him because of a make believe character in their minds. It's sad actually. Because he seems like a really down to earth guy. It's effing creepy.|`|5c079cb1c9fa7ffe7d3cdc8fa57061a6aa	its a girl like megan fox i guess they'd go ga ga just staring at her<br>  <br>  eventually they'll have the courage to ask for an autograph and pic but it might be too late when she walks away<br>  <br>  its confusing for rob since he was never this famous and well known <br>  so its hard for him to get used to it<br>  <br>  its not like he has a blockbuster movie all the time<br>  so by new moon he'd still be overwhelmed<br>  <br>  eclipse and future movies he'd be used to it|`|jgpYS0oEaa	My bf and his stepdad goes to movie premieres to get autographs and sell them online.

Might get more attention that way.|`|fpuHVNYgaa	They scream because he's an overated teenage heart throb!|`|RD3OFTQraa	yes they are pathetics,  They should behave mature and Robert can be set in one of them, but they prove to be a little girls|`|6sb24oLGaa	It's weird when LITTLE and Kids scream at male celebrity's.

dMBSE8ilaa	They have to spread out the seasons of those shows, someone did poor planning and didn't stretch them out well enough, so now CW viewers have to suffer through 4-5 weeks of withdrawals of some shows! usually a network only does 2-3 week hiatus' but CW decided to do 4-5 week hiatuses. <br>  <br>  Anyways since there's only 22-23-24 episodes of the shows on CW, they have to take hiatuses so the seasons of the shows can end in May, or else the summer season would be much longer.|`|oVRA1ze2aa	poor planning there a bunch of Morons.Because they've pulled  The Game and Everybody hates Chris .There racist and cancelling all the decent african american shows.To capitalize on the stupidity of Americans with watered down shows like Gossip Girl ,90210, etc. They really have  dumbed down society with these Hills like tv shows.|`|loqsl5xXaa	im missing my shows too :( i hate when all my shows go off till the new season starts makes me very sad, lol..

Next time, ask your Twilight Qs In the "Movies" or "Books & Authors" section instead. Why?  1. You will get more answers about It there than asking It here In the Comics and Animation section.  2. Twilight questions pollute C&A (even though they have NOTHING to do with anime) and everyone gets fed up with them.|`|vqg6wpCLaa	...why are you in the Comics and Animation section?

And, move this question out of Comics & Animation.    Sure, the category that pops up is Comcs & Animation, but what does have it have to do with comics or animation? Are there comic books for it? Are there animation for it?    Last I checked, Twilight is books and a movie. Go to that section.|`|Kgrq92Veaa	Please, my dear, sweet, twiligiht fan, MOVE THIS QUESTION OUT OF COMICS AND ANIMATION!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!...

P0Fjh59Eaa	She's there...but the show is focusing on other stories right now. mainly the story line w/Sami and her baby being switched by Nicole with a different one.    Alison Sweeney (Sami Brady) was pregnant in real life, and so they wrote it into the story line. they taped a bunch of her story line in advance so that when she had her baby and left the show they had material to play since it's one of the priority stories right now. so while they are playing out the whole Sami/Nicole baby switching thing, other characters are on the back burner. i'm sure they will pick up Chelsea's story (which right now is about her and Max re-hooking up) after the drama from the baby switch is over and Alison comes back to shoot new episodes.|`|a8s9RVNVaa	Chelsea is stilla round she just hasn't been on the show in a few episode's.

9IfItE9uaa	***Girls night out***  Two women friends had gone out for a Girls Night Out, and had been decidedly over-enthusiastic on the cocktails. Incredibly drunk and walking home they suddenly realized they both needed to pee. They were very near a graveyard and one of them suggested they do their business behind a headstone or something. The first woman had nothing to wipe with so she took off her panties, used them and threw them away. Her friend however was wearing an expensive underwear set and didn't want to ruin hers, but was lucky enough to salvage a large ribbon from a wreath that was on a grave and proceeded to wipe herself with it. After finishing, they made their way home.    The next day the first woman's husband phones the other husband and said, "These d*** girls nights out have got to stop. My wife came home last night without her panties." "That's nothing," said the other. "Mine came back with a sympathy card stuck between the cheeks of her butt that said, 'From all of us at the Fire Station, Well never forget you!|`|cqzZjRVwaa	I'm not the funniest of people in the world so I just put up a link with jokes instead :)|`|7n4rtfp6aa	a man caught a golden fish and asked it to make him 10 0000 times more clever than any man on the planet.

We are not Psychic!    @@@@@@    OK, I am semi-good with WWII history and actually have seen a bunch of documentaries and read a couple of books about  Colonel Claus von Stauffenberg who tried to assassinate Hitler and failed because someone moved the bomb briefcase behind the wooden leg of a table which saved Hitler's life.    http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Claus_von_S...      The movie is based on his attempt to kill Hitler. Tom Cruise plays Colonel Von Stauffenberg.      http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Valkyrie_(f...

PZ3myuoUaa	The Edge Pro is a floating tremolo right?  I'm not sure what you're asking when you ask how it affects your tuning. If you mean to ask what precision tuning is, it's basically smaller knobs that adjust the tension of the strings in inaudible frequencies.  Also, it is pretty easy to change strings on a tremolo system, despite what others say.

PeuFnqQwaa	Not knowing the extent of your playing ability and knowledge of music theory make this one a bit hard to give you a really good answer. What genre of music are you into. If you are writing a slow and sombre song, you would likely want to write in a minor scale to create the right mood. If you are writing Country, I would suggest basic major chords. You should reall make it simple, there are tons of Hit songs that have no more than 5 or 6 chords. You could write a simple 3 chord song and give it some variety by changing the order that you change chords. To keep it simple, Pick 3 chords  and come up with a pattern for the verses, another one a bit different for the chorus (try and keep this catchy, as you will need this hook to capture the listeners attention). You could also use a third pattern for a bridge. Keep your song structure simple like the basic  Verse, Chorus, Verse, Chorus, Verse, Chorus. If you want you can add a bridge. You may want to add an intro and outro. If you are playing rock and want some simple chords to play just use basic root 5 chords (power chords) You could also add the octave of the root note to each of these chords to fill out the sound a bit more. Another option is to use Barre Chords (if you can play them... I am not sure of you ability). Try and come up with a catchy rhythem as you play your chords. You could also use other easy to play songs as inspiration and could even use the same chord progression as one of them. Just DO NOT copy the melody (that would be plagerism. You cannot copyright a chord progression, but you can copyright a melody. You could alsomplay around with your chord voicings to add a slightly different flavour and eliminate some repiticousness.  For example. Play some different variations of a C chord. They are all C's but each voicing can give you a completely different sound and feel. Hope this helps you....Thats about all I can tell ya without more info on your ability. REMEBER, Keep it simple. It has to be catchy...NOT Complex.|`|4wQffufZaa	well what i do is just mess around with some notes<br>  and once i like what im playing ill tab it out<br>  until i have the whole song|`|yciJslC4aa	You actually answered your own question believe it or not. EXPERIMENT!! Usually I like to find a basic chord structure. In other words I just start messing around with chords. See which ones sound good together. From there you can start coming up with lead parts by putting notes together from the scales of the chords you use. For example if you use a C major chord, play notes within the C major scale. Don't take this as "the bible" of songwriting in fact it's far from it (which is why I am nowhere near famous). But maybe that can point you in some direction that will trigger something. There are no rules to music so just mess around until you get something you like. Happy Composing!!|`|DnBGhVbSaa	I like to start with a song I already know in mind, and then its easy to take it away from there. Thinking of a tune you already know, like a line of a song or something will help you start thinking and playing from your own head- and then you'll end up changing it so much yourself, that the song is unrecognizable.

rRCTvT7Saa	Well, my mom mainly listens to stuff on the pop side of music and I barely listen to ANY music she listens to.  As for my dad--him and I share quite a few artists we listen to such as Badfinger, Scorpions, Cinderella, Led Zeppelin and AC/DC.  I also actually turned my dad into a fan of Alan Jackson and Brad Paisley (two of my favorite country artists) a while back.<br>  <br>  For the most part, however, I don't listen to much of the same music.  I seem to be more open-minded when it comes to music compared to my parents.  For instance, I'll listen to any one of these genres:  rock, country, blues, jazz, bluegrass, western swing and surf rock.  Neither of my parents listen to more than two of those genres and, when they do, it's usually different artists.|`|YJAS7kbHaa	Well I grew up laughing at my dad's music along with my sisters and my mom while listening to my mom's terrible taste (you know those usual pop artists that are always on the top 40s). Now I'm 13 and I enjoy a variety of music since I learned what REAL music really is, I listen to a lot of unknown indie bands and unusual bands like the Dresden Dolls or screamo like Mindless Self Indulgence which both of my parents rather despise. I have recently realized what great stuff is in my dad's collection, The Beatles, Billy Idol, and Elton John. Although I'm very picky about my music since I've had a lot of years on various instruments I'm very open to different types, I just recently discovered a group I enjoy that's not my style at all, which is the flobots. (I recommend anyone reading this check out their other songs besides handlebars because they are actually quite good)|`|16t0eV0Uaa	My mom: CCR, Neil Diamond, David Bowie, U2, The Beatles.<br>  <br>  My Dad: The moody Blues, Jethro Tull, Emerson lake and palmer.<br>  <br>  I would say I listen to a lot of what they listen too, except Emerson lake and palmer, no thank you!|`|kHv0CuaMaa	No, my dad is a music hater, and my mom likes American Idol singers. <br>  It's weird because I love 50's jazz and 60-70's rock.

My dad still listens to that stuff that made in the 50s and previous, and sometimes maybe a little modern country. My mom is a 70s fan. They BOTH listen to those horrible stories on the radio. I am a punk-rock fan. I have five siblings, and none of them are country fans. My sister is a rap ran, my other sister is a heavy metal fan, my oldest brother is a...I don't even know what the crap he listens to. My third sister listens to anything on one channel that plays everything, and my youngest brother is a metal fan. It's so weird. None of us can stand our parents music...|`|QhJ8YiLhaa	I listen to a lot of metal... Satyricon, Megadeth, Anaal Nathrakh, Behemoth, Strapping Young Lad, ect, ect... And then I have the weird stuff like Steve Steven's solo albums, Wang Chung, some classical, lots of different music mixed in there... But my mother was always into stuff like Brian Adams, Cheap Trick, ect, which are artists that I absolutely love. So I've always had an appreciation for different music. I got my mom into Anaal Nathrakh, so I think I'm rubbing off on her :P<br>  <br>  I guess we share and enjoy music from each other in my family!|`|5g0zCTqMaa	Well my Dad's music taste isn't really all that much u know the classics Elvis, and The Beatles. <br>  And my mom is appalled by today's music, all of it not just rap, which I find ridiculous because the music our time in today's world is so diverse, eccentric, and experimental and the choices are so vast so I don't know what her deal is but any who haha yea she likes the Bee Gee's, who do have a few good songs like how deep is your love and stayin alive, and Journey who of course have some classic songs those of which are needless to list.<br>  So in conclusion the answer is no we have no where near the same music taste and I like to believe that mine is the better of the two my favorite bands are Red Hot Chili Peppers, and Incubus.|`|oy2KSYpMaa	a bit of both actually. i love my cold chisel, ac/dc, the screaming jets, baby animals, hoodoo gurus, paul kelly and hunters and collectors. but my mum actually quite likes some of the music i listen to like sugarcult, all time low, hellogoodbye and escape the fate.<br>  <br>  i quite often catch her singing along to a bit of cobra starship.|`|1UKr652Uaa	I definitely got a lot of my musical taste from my dear ol' dad. He loves rock and roll, and some of my favorite artists are also some of his: AC/DC, Rush, Aerosmith, etc. But my tastes are a bit wider than his. I've gone on to like bands like Metallica, Rage Against the Machine, and System of a Down, all of whom he doesn't much care for- though I have gotten him a little into Metallica's new album.|`|xxSGhywoaa	No, my mother is still stuck in the seventies.  Neil Young and Hall and Oats those bands, I listen to Progressive Rock, King Crimson, Genesis, Emerson Lake and Palmer.|`|a1Ngi39Xaa	No - for the most part.  They were country fans so I naturally became a metal head.  I do like Johnny Cash and Randy Travis though.<br>  <br>  However, I thought that hell had truly frozen over because Mom was watching some Country Awards Show and The Eagles were doing a performance.  She mentioned it to me later and told me how good they were and they were the best band that performed on the show.  I was a huge Eagles fan when I was young.  So it was kinda cool!   Btw, she will turn 80 years old this year!!|`|pNUtnoC8aa	Yeah my dad and I like a lot of the same stuff.<br>  My dad playes<br>  Johnny Cash<br>  Simon and Garfunkel<br>  Fleetwood Mac<br>  Metallica<br>  And Bob Sager to name  a few<br>  <br>  It all kind of stuck to me I guess/|`|twVyisGnaa	From my dad, I got interested in Spanish Rock.  I myself got intersted in English Rock, too.  Now I like both regular and Spanish Rock.<br>  <br>  VIVA LA RAZA!|`|N62uLMf3aa	yes! We listen to pretty much the same thing, except my mom doesn't like NEW WAVE.|`|WU4MHq3aaa	yep.... Clash , Led Zeppelin, Bowie, The Who<br>  <br>  I am an Acca Dacca fan of my own right however

d34a87da4539642d3cb666b40172bf47aa	As the previous answer states... Spiderman was not one of the original Avengers. He's actually be more of a tie-in for X-Men. But, it's also because there's going to be a Spiderman 4. And, it's entirely possible he could make a cameo... but unlikely. There's way too many Marvel comic movies already in the works...<br>  <br>  Avengers...<br>  Hulk 2...<br>  Iron Man 2...<br>  Thor...<br>  Possibly Capt America...<br>  Possibly Ant-man...<br>  Possibly SHIELD...<br>  Spiderman 4...<br>  Origin Wolverine...<br>  Origin Magneto...<br>  Possibly Daredevil 2...|`|qCOqFnquaa	Because Spiderman isn't one of the original Avengers.

b2261d1342601255ca19eb8cac0fdf39aa	My favorite songs would probably be Longview, Welcome to Paradise or 409 in Your Coffee Maker (I have it on E.P. Vinyl format) though I am also a fan of Walking Contradiction, Basket Case, The One I Want and their cover of Knowledge was good and I have always had a special place in my heart for Good Riddance.<br>  My Favorite album would either be Dookie or Insomniac though I like all their old stuff and I don't really care what people think...I also enjoyed  Warning their new stuff never really caught me, I guess I am too old or it was just to commercial for me. <br>  Green Day became a commercial band but they for the most part had a really good sound and were catchy as hell and plus who the heck didn't know how to play brainstew on guitar back in the 90s!|`|OGdDXeP8aa	Basket Case off of Dookie remains my favorite,  It brings back great memories from college.  It was the beginning of quote "alternative" music - it was so new, so refreshing!  I vividly recall Basket Case being played at the pubs and everyone singing along word for word! Good times, I'm going to listen to them now!|`|HGnWKRzyaa	I like Good Riddance and the album it comes off of.<br>  <br>   And I am not an emo screamer who hopped on the bandwagon. I actually started listening to them when I was 8. <br>  <br>   MQ: American Idiot. Not their best, but my favorite. I liked Jesus of Suburbia...|`|kNiWIilfaa	I'm not a big fan but a fan.<br>  <br>  Basket Case<br>  Welcome to paradise<br>  When i come around<br>  Longview|`|AgQForcYaa	"Ha Ha You're Dead" is a pretty good, tongue-in-cheek song. =) <br>  <br>  But for personal reasons, "Good Riddance (Time of Your Life)"|`|eGiLYNlzaa	I loved anything previous to their latest record...It's just so...not Green Day. It's sad to see one of my favorite bands becoming just like everyone else...|`|RALpRu54aa	I used to like them, until I had all their songs and was tired of listening to them. I like 'Reject', 'Redundant','Best Thing In Town'|`|a1Ngi39Xaa	Welcome to Paradise or She<br>  <br>  MQ:  Dookie|`|a79b8a93426576f5d2c9cb6a23ba338faa	In this order:<br>  <br>  "She"<br>  "Welcome To Paradise"<br>  "Chump" <br>  "Pulling Teeth"<br>  <br>  MQ: Dookie (I remember when this album came out.)
AA11868787	I saw the pictures and I was horrified!<br>  Not that I condone abuse of kind, but it seemed at first that it was not that bad. Many celebs have not come out against Chris Brown aggressively enough. Now they will sing a different tune. Today is Rihanna's Birthday! Unfortunately she is caught up in this mess, but she needs to come out (after some healing time and counseling) against abuse of young women at the hands of their boyfriends.|`|4w9gmvumaa	I'm hoping that the justice system work this time.  It failed Nicole Brown Simpson.<br>  <br>  I'm sure she's humiliated, but not more humiliated than she has been from being abused by him.  It is time for society to see the true face of domestic violence. It happens every day.  It is real.  And it's time for a very public discourse about this issue.|`|B3N388wBaa	Me and my mom saw it, and she looks terrible! Can't believe that happened...|`|iAuvoQeHaa	OMG, that is awful - really nasty. You can see all the swelling and the contusions on each side of her face, just as they described. This has to have a horrible effect on her. I'm so glad that she has familiy and support around her at the moment.<br>  <br>  I do hope that he gets a proper sentence, as anyone who does this sort of thing should, but I really think he's also going to pay for this in terms of career. It's so messy because both of them are so high profile, but it goes to show that domestic violence doesn't discriminate between how wealthy or poor, or how well set up you are.<br>  <br>  It's going to take a lot for Rihanna to come out in public again and move on with her life and career after this. I'm wishing her luck.|`|lrqZHi9Jaa	Ive avoided TMZ since they made really stupid remarks about the koala video.  As an australian, and a victorian as well, very, very tasteless and uncalled for.  Over 200 dead, nothing to joke about.  I am sorry for Rihanna though, hear she looks awful.|`|GB858dS0aa	that is terrible.|`|G0jvv4Jsaa	Yep!  It is starting to surface on legit sites now.  There is one of her on this site as well.  See link below:|`|CLJL39Abaa	OMG! yea i did i saw it a few minutes ago! she looks terrible!<br>  She should press charges on Chris Brown. So he can go to jail and hopefully get butt raped! he deserves it!
1UKr652Uaa	That would be "Wake Up" from Rage's self-titled debut album. The song- as well as many other of their songs- has a lot in common politically and philosophically with the Matrix.|`|AlXuUeH4aa	why

iqWfufpUaa	He fused R & B with acid rock guitar and influenced so many musicians since the 1960's with his unique style of playing.<br>  <br>  I wish I had a time machine and could have gone back and seen him play live - he was phenomenal!|`|8nKyRiahaa	He showed us how a guitar can wail, he's an inspiration with what his teeth can do, and he led the way on how to fly without getting on the plane.|`|yciJslC4aa	Ha awesome choice. Even though Hendrix was a great guitar player, people recognize him more as an innovator for Rock and all kinds of  music. At the time, he kind of invented a style of his own and many later guitar players fed off that. He opened the door for guys like stevie ray vaughn. eddie van halen, and really any other great guitar player you can think of in the blues/rock/metal category. If you look up some of the big names in guitar playing today, a lot of them will still list Hendrix and his music as one of there biggest influences. Me personally I'm not all that big of a Hendrix fan, but I respect the guy because he opened doors to music we may not have seen otherwise. By living, and sadly enough even by dying at such a young age, he grasped the attention of the world and pointed in a direction that allowed people like stevie ray vaughn to succeed as a musician. As far as music goes, Hendrix has had a huge positive impact almost worldwide. Hopefully that'll trigger some ideas for you. Best of luck!!|`|VBdXray0aa	He was a druggie and ODed at a young age.

0565260f0cb80c4e8acca65bc2938706aa	I think he is assessing the stuffs on what he wants - he is deciding and thinking what you are to him - he is shocked and he needs that time to assess stuffs. You should just stick around to assure him in a slow gentle way that you are eady for a serious relationship which taureans are always after. they are just shocked a bit with the gesture, but for sure they like that idea of a good relationship with someone. im a taurean.|`|Po6dgusAaa	A.

I know a lot of Libra's and we usually are only affectionate to very few chosen people we feel comfortable around.

Once we trust ya, we are the best,most affectionate friends in the world.|`|HE558QgXaa	I'm a libra and I feel kind of uncomfortable when everyone is socializing around me. If other libras are like me then they feel left out and afraid of rejection. I also get lost in thought a lot. If they seem distant, be nice and give them time to feel comfortable around you. But don't be clingy. They may get uncomfortable and avoid you.

21808938a2c954ea0389683f10267c69aa	What celebrity "pushes" Wicca?<br>  <br>  Celebrities, like everyone else, are free to express their religion.  If Tom Cruise wants to tell us how great Scientology is, that's his choice.  We can choose to turn him off and not watch him on YouTube.<br>  <br>  Forcing religion on people is another matter, and its equally obnoxious regardless which religion is being forced.  But I'm not aware of any celebrity "forcing" religion on us, new age or otherwise.|`|Uy58ixnvaa	What do you mean by New Age? Wicca is actually way older than Christianity. <br>  <br>  And most celebs want to be seen as liberal as possible, so they immerse themselves in "interesting" topics.|`|EyAAFfaMaa	Freedom of both speech and religion. While I don't personally believe in those religions, I haven't really seen celebrities go out and advertise them. I understand that some people openly practice those religions, and what makes them different from normal people who do so? I don't think they are "pushing" those religions, just practicing them. I mean, why isn't that okay? "Pushing" would be like all the Disney kids who talk about God and Christianity and prayer all the time. I'm a Christian, but thats just an example. Is it okay for Christianity to be "pushed", and not other religions. I think people can believe whatever they want to. Personally, if a person is in an influential position, and they want to promote or "push" something, why not? People promote things all the time, it just reaches more people if a celebrity does it.|`|celVUtGeaa	First off Wicca isn''t 'newage' it's a very old religion that has been forced into hiding because of rediculous relgious propaganda and scientology isn't a religion.<br>  <br>  and secondly you don't actually have to listen to em ya know<br>  <br>  besides is it right for schools to push relgions like christianity and hinduism of influencable little kids, when i was in first school they taught us that if you were white you had to be christian and if you were indian you had to be hindu and i didn't go to a relgious school before you ask.|`|GIRE9F45aa	Ehh, I feel like it is their right to speak freely about whatever they believe in, but I don't think people should consider them authorities on anything spiritual and put too much stock in their opinions.<br>  <br>  In Scientology's case, the celebrities are actually being used to further a dangerous cult.  The celebs that are in it aren't aware of all the bad stuff that goes on in it!|`|W11nQzVPaa	Simply put there are no celeb "pushing" Wicca. A Wiccan does not push their religion. We do not recruit nor try to coerce anyone. That is for Mormons! <br>  Sharon
