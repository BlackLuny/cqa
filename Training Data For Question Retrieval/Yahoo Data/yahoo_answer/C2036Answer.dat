f2e275c6c286bc66bf166e78674e9d45aa	Based off of what I hear from most of my friends -who for some dumb reason still have Alltel,- they don't like it, Lots of dropped calls is the main problem and lack of customer service help. I have T-mobile and recommend their service to Anyone and everyone. Good Luck!|`|Yegl5Y88aa	Where I stay Alltel is good about reception and not having dropped calls.

It is really free I have used it before and really easy to use. Its www.phonezoo.com you can get wallpapers and games. You can even send ringtones that other people have made and decided to share on your phone. Another great place to go if your browsing from your phone is www.3gforfree.com I have used both of these and as long as you access www.3gforfree.com from your phone its free. That one you just download the ringtones from a list. It has a great selection so I'm sure that song is there. Good luck!<br>  <br>  §Jodee§
fwnqB0dTaa	Probably not.    A Canadian phone would need to be dual band, or tri-band, to work in the UK and there is nothing in the specs of this to indicate it is either of those.|`|ZtECjEPyaa	of course. just make sure that you have INTERNATIONAL on your phone so that you can talk outside the country.

qWicVoU9aa	There are no truly free sites as cell phone records are NOT public records. To get the information requires that records searches be performed by a legitimate agency and they DO charge for this. You will find all kinds of sites that claim to be "free" but all you will get for free is the city and state. I have tried my personal cell phone number in many of these sites and they do not give correct info even at that. They usually come back and tell me that it is a landline number, which I know it is not

CXilkEVAaa	its is hard to fix it  but how much u want for it ?
2N7I3ylyaa	It depends what you like watching. Sports and action movies always look better with a decent plasma tv. I suggest a panasonic plasma tv - they are available in as small as 37" screen size.<br>  <br>  If you have a PS3 or Xbox etc, then an LCD will probably be a better choice. Plasmas during the early portion of their lives are susceptible to screen burn (first 200 hours or so). LCD is also more readily available in 1080p which the PS3 can take advantage of. I would suggest one of the new Sony LCDs in this case.<br>  <br>  Overall, I can tell you I chose Plasma 37" panasonic. I have a PS3, but the TV's early days I did get some screen retention. However, if you look after the TV, all you need to do with screen retention is to put the TV on analogue static for a while to cure the retention.|`|BwbLmMd2aa	Depends on size and resolution too. Plasmas generally give better picture but are a little more fragile. On the other end LCD's give more durability in picture, but have not as good color representation. <br>  <br>  Resolution can be a big deal if it is important. Frankly I don't think most people can tell the difference between 720p and 1080p (even CNET rated their best TV as a 720p Pioneer). <br>  <br>  I am a BIG fan of the Panasonic Plasma's, that being said. The model numbers include TH-42px75U|`|k7fEW9Zpaa	depends on size upto 37-40" lcd over 40" plasma. Plasma is better on fast moving action ie sport|`|upAf4ysEaa	LCD destroys Plasma in quality and is generally cheaper. I got a 1080p LCD (Sony Bravia 40 inch) which is basically one of the best you can get. And I got it new at Sears for only $1350.|`|F5fIBGCraa	Some good answers.  All I can add is that LCD sets (including DLP) larger than 42" use a bulb for its brightness.  The average life of those bulbs seems to be around a year.  If you watch TV more, it will burn out sooner.  Some bulbs can last upwards of 2 years, between usage and a fluke of durability.  But no matter whether they last a long time or die out soon, they DO start to lose brightness in just a few months.  Movies which have dark scenes in them become more difficult to see, even though the bulb is still pretty good.  <br>  And it costs between $150 - $300 to replace the bulb when it dies.  Remember, I said each year.<br>  <br>  Two years ago, plasmas were impressive, but they hadn't been out long enough to believe the hype.  Supposedly they're good for 60,000 hours.  Even at 12 hours a day, 7 days a week, that's still good for over 13 years.  (No bulbs, either)  But nobody's had a plasma fo 13 years to verify if it's true.  Still, reliability becomes more assured as time goes on.  But they're still expensive.<br>  <br>  Hard to decide?  You bet.  But LCD's are the cheapest, even with bulb replacements, and prices are still coming down.  So buy an LCD for now, and upgrade in 2 -3 years when you've got more money.<br>  <br>  The one thing I CAN save you headache is to not bother with the 1080p sets.  For TV and DVDs, it's meaningless.  Even Blu-Ray DVDs.  1080i is perfectly good enough.  1080p is only meaningful for the gamers.
BwbLmMd2aa	this problem can happen with a really old battery. Getting a new one shouldn't be too hard or expensive, especially on Amazon or eBay. <br>  <br>  if that doesn't fix the problem, it sounds like you have a loose pot. I wouldn't immediately diagnose that problem though, until you have tried the battery thing as that may not be as simple to fix.<br>  <br>  If it does end up being that then you have few options. You can try to get HTC to fix it but they may not since it is a fairly old phone.
cB9UuAOWaa	well obviously it would take 10p away from ur credit cause u just sent a text which costs 10p? it would only be free if u have free texts...anyway, do what the person above said and if that dont work i would advise that you contact o2 about the problem|`|0SFGnjq2aa	most phones these days give you a balance once you have sent a message or made a call.  A delivery report is just an acknowledgement that the message was sent.  What tariff are you on with o2? Im on the Unlimited tariff whereby if i top up 15 per month I get unlimited texts and calls to o2 numbers, but if your mainly a texter then try the Text Anytime tariff, weherby you get 300 texts for 10, 500 texts for 15 and unlimited for 30, but the unlimited works out about 12000 texts to any networks.    If you need any further help then please let me know|`|wUsNhp2oaa	o2's network is not capable of delivery reports for text messages.    you are confusing your balance with a delevery report, they are 2 different things. a delivery report just informs you that the other person has received your text and at what time etc.    what you are experiencing is just o2 informing you you have used some off your credit.|`|gqWr2uLPaa	all the hidden extras eh! with basic phones you:  Go to messages, delivery options,  Delivery reports  and turn it off.  dependant on the phone but all phones have the option to turn this off, what model if urs?
fdd5c5b5d35c694b40560fd4c8109e54aa	WRONG!!! Don't get that slide      a] Since they're dark, for a fact this phone is glossy... It's going to be a fingerprint magnet... Constant cleaning or rubbing with tissue...    b] Scratches on gloss phones look ugly... since if there is light... they stick out like a sore thumb...    c] White phones don't get dirty unless you play in dirt...    d] Scratches on white phones you can't see unless you actually observe them.    Samsung A720 has flash... which comes in handy~ : The more the merrier|`|ZtECjEPyaa	i think the first one is better because slider phones are in right now and it looks really cool. plus, black is better than white because if it scratches up or if it gets dirty, you won't be able to see the mess easier than on a white phone. also, i think the the first phone will have better texting then the second because the buttons look more precise for texting. if i were you, i would definitely go for the black phone (the first one).

0AUTZt5Aaa	Hmm...some people cough Courtney cough don't know what they are talking about    The only models that play PS2 games are:    20GB-Discontinued, all PS2 games $500  60GB-Discontinued, all PS2 games $600, later $550  Old 80GB-Discontinued, 80% of PS2 games $500    The following DO NOT:    40GB-Discontinued $400  New 80GB-in stores $400  160GB-in stores $500    All PS3's play PSone games.    An easy way to tell if a PS3 will play PS2 games    4USB ports=YES  2USB ports=NO    The reason is that the cost of putting the PS2 chip   and the PS2 graphics card in the PS3 was VERY expensive,   and as the PS2 only has about a year left (before it is   discontinued), Sony saw no reason to lose even more   money than they already are losing on the PS3, and   hence there is no backwards compatibility on PS3's today.|`|aROiy2Gnaa	only if it has backwards compadibility ask ur sales man and he will tell u|`|TFvWvdVIaa	Yes you can because the ps2 plays ps1 games also my friends did|`|mPaqhgUuaa	This question has been asked hundred of times...well...no, the 80GB PS3s nowadays does not have backward compatibility, which means you can't play PS2 games. The only PS3 with backward compatibility is the old 20GB, 40GB and 60GB, however, they're not being produced anymore. You're best shot will be getting a second-hand one.|`|408bbc7c158b10118dab47eafbcb0852aa	yes.|`|pOi0wewIaa	If your buying an 80GB with 4 USB Ports then it can play PS2 games then if it has 2 USB Ports then no it can't.

6GL3dDtUaa	Unfortunately there are a number of things that could be wrong.  It could be a slow connection which is the most likely scenario.  You can reset your router by turning off the computer to which it is connected.  Then depending on your router it will either have a reset button (probably very small and in an indiscreet place) or you will have to unplug it.  Either way, hold the button or leave it unplugged for about 20 seconds or so, then boot it and the computer back up and try playing again.    This is probably the extreme option, however, as other players' connections online can also affect your connection speed.  Try exiting the room your playing in and enter another before resetting your router.  It could be as easy as that.  Hope that helps!

RpCwfcRzaa	There's an issue with the 360 where downloaded content is linked to the gamertag and also to the console you downloaded it to. People started noticing this when they sent their 360s in for repair and if MS sent them a replacement one, all of their content was gone and the only way to access it was to be connected to Live all the time. If you can't connect to Live all the time (and I'm assuming you can't since you downloaded at your friend's house), you need to download the license transfer MS put out to fix the issue. The problem is that if you don't have Live, there isn't a way to do this since you need to connect your console to Live in order to complete the transfer. What you will need to do is go here http://www.xbox.com/en-US/support/system... and follow the transfer steps. Then take your whole 360 over to your friend's house and connect to Live to complete the transfer. This is all assuming you can't connect to Live at your house. If you do have Live at home, just go to that link and follow the steps to transfer the license over.|`|gcGZ07Toaa	Get a PS3 the ps3 version is wayyyy better

You don't need a nunchuck and to play you hold the wii remote sideways and occasionally pointing it at the screen for some puzzles.    Pixls are these things that mario finds kinda like his partners in paper mario 64 and paper mario and the 1000 year door.

The losing faction was banished from Earth and forced to settle with Helghan. Over time the humans noticed they were changing, the planets harsh enviroment and atmosphere was changing them. They started losing all of their hair, turning extremely pale, becoming bigger, stronger, and faster than humans. They could no longer be considered humans anymore..They're Helghast now. A man named Visari became Emperor of the Helghan nation and made the Helghast hungry for revenge on the humans. The Helghast invade the Earth colony of Vekta and the second Helghan/Vektan war starts.  and the humans win so in k2 your going to helghan|`|m2qDvFW0aa	Wikipedia.org is pretty useful

Xxviy63Paa	You need a lot more than just a converter cable. If such a cable even exists, it would simply give you a blank screen, or a screeen full of snow. S-video and VGA are both analog signals, but they are still completely different in terms of the way the video is encoded.     You could get a signal conversion box, these convert different analog signals between each other, and some even add digital. Most are made in Asia and cost between $50 and $100. I don't know how well they work, it's probably far from perfect.    There is also a ps2 vga cable, believe it or not, but you can only use it under ps2 linux. An original ps2 linux disc is hard to find, and the ps2 vga cable is even rarer.    The best choice might be to use a capture card. A simple TV tuner card with an s-video or composite a/v input would probably work. Just run the ps2 signal into the capture card, and have your capture software relay it to your screen instead of capturing it. An added bonus would be making gameplay videos, if your pc is powerful enough to do it on the fly.
AFzb8sXCaa	>I want to find out how to connect it so i can record shows on my vcr side.    You can't. Unless you have one of the rare TVs that has a video output, there is no way to use the TV's tuner to record programs.     If the VCR doesn't  have a tuner built into it, you will have to use an external tuner to record programs. For example, you could use one of the coupon type converters as a tuner for digital over the air broadcasts.|`|EmgiGg17aa	first you need wire and a screwdriver.|`|Ns6I7MmBaa	To play the VCR you would need composite (or maybe S-Video) from the VCR to TV.  If the DVD player part does up converting, you might be able to use DVI or HDMI or DVI to HDMI cable to play DVD's.    Most combo VCR/DVD units do not have any built-in TV tuner.  And most TV's do not have any video output. So to record VCR you will need a set top box (cable, satellite, or digital over the air STB) that has composite (or S-Video) output to feed into your VCR (unless you have a PC with tuner card and composite video output).    You would also need audio cables for anything other than HDMI to HDMI output from the DVD player part.|`|EsUzVCkPaa	If your tv is digital it should have some better quality inputs, First you want to send your cable into the VCR first, then back out to the TV/BOX so you can record.  That is a connection right there, but for better quality you could also go and connect either S-video cable, component(The three color  RCA cables), possibly HDMI, but I doubt the DVD/VCR has HDMI, this takes care of the video, then all u need is two RCA cables to connect the Left/Right sound.
zbx922PYaa	The Fender Bullet should be a fantastic practice amp. It sounds like you have a different problem. I would be that there is a grounding fault. I can't remember if that is a 2 or three prong plug. If a 2, then try flipping the plug in the socket.     If you are using an extension cord, plug it into the wall. Try different wall sockets, just in case there is a ground fault in the wall.    Of course, make sure that the balance of gain controls is set correctly, that could amplify a buzz. If the buzz goes away when you hold your strings, then there could be a ground problem in your guitar. Take your guitar to a shop (or a friends house) and try a different amp and see if the buzz is there too.    It could also be a grounding fault in the amp itself, which would mean taking it to a repair shop.    I would bank the $300 for a larger amp down the road when you start to gig with a band.|`|FaS3CT5waa	rubber baby buggy bumpers
Xxviy63Paa	Only one way. Find a friend who has a ps3 or at least an internet connection that works with PSN. Then take out the hard drive and bring it, or the entire ps3 if they don't have one, to your friends house and put your hard drive in. You will now be able to log in to PSN under your account and download DLC.    That's the only way, as long as your ps3 remains incompatible with your internet connection. Since that's difficult, you might look into why it's incompatible. It usually is because of a firewalled router. Ask whoever has admin permissions on the router to give your ps3 a static LAN address, and declare it a DMZ also. Another thing, if you live in a city, would be to just go into internet settings, switch to wireless, and scan. Usually you will find someone's router that you can hitchhike on. It's rude, and they will likely kick you off before you can finish the download in one try, but it would get it done.|`|HekFanRvaa	there is no such thing as "internet doesn't work on PS3" unless it is a dial-up internet.

If you play on expert or sometimes hard (this does not happen on medium or easy, so if you are a "n00b", this may not pertain to you), there will be a set of notes with purple underneath the note.  for these notes, it doesn't matter if you miss or don't strum, as long as you hit the fret button "at the corresponding time" of the note, no strumming is involved.  But remember, only for certain parts of certain songs.  Go to practice, hot for teacher, expert guitar, beginning.  there is a bunch of purple.    Or you can do a hammer-on/pull-off.  These are notes with white on top of them.  For these, you strum the note before them, and then all of the white notes following the note you strummed do not have to be strummed, but you have to hit them at the corresponding time still.  These are on beginner levels, but very rarely.  An example would be the beginning of "never too late" expert guitar, if you go into practice mode you can see it.      I hope I helped.

j5Apt8hWaa	What you want to shoot "close up" photography is a macro lens like the 60 mm or 105 mm (1:1 to 1:2 image to subject ratio).    If you mean by "close up", shooting a subject at a distance and filling the cameras frame, you need a long lens like a 70-300 mm (least expensive at this time)    There are some lenses like the 18-200 mm lenses that will give you a good range for shooting both wide angle shots as well as telephoto shots like shooting wildlife or sports    mm is the length of the lens ... the more millimeters, the longer the lens and the further you can reach out to get good shots.|`|n71t0xoCaa	As others have said the numbers tell you the minumin and maximum focal lenght of the lens of you are using a dSLR with an APSc sensor you have to multiply these numbers by 1.5 or 1.6 depending on the caemra if you are using a 4/3 sensor I think the multiplier os 2.  the higher the number the greater the magnification of the lens to bring things far away to where they look closer.

The higher the mm number the further you can be away and bring them in closer optically.  Also with the higher mm keep an eye on the maximum aperature... for fashion etc.. you will want the 2.8

That's why there are so many people who can play it.  What makes it easy, is you can actually look and see "steps".  When you need to move up a half step or whole step in a chord its very easy to do.  Other instruments such as horns, woodwinds its not as easy.  This is why if you ever see a teen band, you won't see a teen who can play horns/woodwinds.  It takes a lot years of training to play those Instruments unless your a phenom.  Can you name a famous teen saxophonist?  Probably not.  There are a lot of famous ADULT saxophonists.  How many famous teens have you seen playing guitar?  Plenty! You can pick it up and teach yourself with a good book or DVD.  Basic chords are very easy to learn.  You can play many songs with the basic chords. I learned the basics in a month and I am an old fart.  The younger you start, the easier it is for your brain to pick it up.  From the basics you can continue to progress.  You can learn strumming or individual note picking. You can go far as you want.  Don't invest in an expensive guitar unless you know for sure you are going to stick with it.|`|	depends, it can be.|`|	im learning to play the bass guitar and it not that hard. but yea.|`|	Like all musical instruments, yes it can be hard at first and as you progress.|`|	Only if you're bad at it.|`|	noppee|`|	on the first try I would say yes

a955299a310a71175625cded5cea1a76aa	Blackjack 2 with Garmin GPS maps. and a dashboard mount that usually costs less than $40.    Works Wonders|`|kVeu3nfwaa	A GPS needs power, that means it will either need to have it's own battery or connect to the car battery. Generally it's easier for the GPS to have it's own battery rather than having to connect into the car electronics. If nothing else most off the shelf products will use their own batteries because the manufacturers don't want the liability of people re-wiring their cars. Hooking up to the car battery is easy enough if you know what you are doing.      Secondly a GPS alone won't solve your problem. A GPS system knows where it is but on it's own it has no way of getting that information back to your home computer. You need some sort of data connection between the GPS and your computer (or the internet).  Generally that means a cellular modem which in turn means a monthly subscription.      Once you accept that anything you find will have a battery and a monthly subscription then googling for GPS trackers should find you a lot of options.

Hope this helped!

KhGkc2QGaa	go to google and do a search. you'll get tons of sites.    file2hd.com is a good site if you want to rip songs off of a myspace|`|XNkPciEoaa	frostwire.com|`|KdGncKCQaa	mininova.org, it works amazingly|`|LQ04emc3aa	www.mp3rocket.com|`|Q0dzzgomaa	I would suggest that instead of downloading from Rhapsody, Napster or Limewire, you use the Free Youtube to Mp3 Converter from www.dvdvideosoft.com for the following reasons:    1) Sharing  - With limewire, they want you to share the songs you download and the songs you have. Now you can turn this option off, but who wants to sit there for hours sifting through thousands of options for the sake of a couple of songs? With the software I recommended, you don't have to share sh*t (Excuse the language)    2) Preview before you play  - With limewire, you have to start downloading the song before you can preview it. Now this might not sound like a problem to most, but for people with super fast internet connections that can download songs at the speed of light, you won't have the time to preview it before it plays because it would be on your computer before your mouse could get anywhere near that play button. Now suppose it's a virus and not the song you wanted? You see, Youtube of course lets you play the video (they don't expect you to download, so playing the video is the only thing you can do), which not only allows you to check and see whether or not it's the right song, but you can check its quality as well.     3) Virus Risks  - See, Limewire downloads from other people's computers meaning that they could've downloaded that song from anywhere. So it could potentially be a virus. But ask yourself: when was the last time you heard about Youtube having a virus? Youtube performs maintanence nearly everyday, so even if they were to get a virus, they would detect it before it could do any serious damage to the site itself.  Plus, this is Google, the masters of coding/programming. Hell, they probably made their own anti virus software to scan the videos before they're actually uploaded. You have to realize: Google is a huge company. They wouldn't let some bad computer code cooked up by an amateur hacker destroy something they paid over $1 billion for.     4) Settings  - When you download Limewire for the first time, you don't automatically start downloading music. You have to first configure what seems like thousands of unnecessary settings. These range from turning it on and off as your torrent client, to the quality, to what types of files you would like to share (why is that even there?), to settings that talk about proxies (you're probably thinking "What the hell are proxies?"). Basically, it's too much of a hassle for those of us who simply want to download a couple of songs. Well, with the software I suggested, you only do four things:  - Install  - Select the folder  - Select the quality  - Download your songs    5) Wider Variety of Music  - True enough, Limewire, Napster and those other sharing sites have a pretty large collection of songs, but when it comes down to it, Youtube is the biggest. Admit it, every song that you couldn't find on Limewire or iTunes, you could easily find on Youtube. Not only new generation songs, but songs from commercials and old/new TV Shows, 80's hits, classic rock, Def Jam Poetry, exclusive remixes, underground rap, extremely rare tracks that you thought you would never find. You're in luck especially if you listen to Hip Hop or Rock simply because of the huge amount of remixes that can be found on Youtube. Most of which can't be found on Limewire, and certainly won't be found on iTunes. But you're thinking "I don't know how to download from Youtube!" Well, now you can.       Now, for my last point (I'm almost done, stay with me), I would like to emphasize what I stated about sharing. Now even though Limewire claims to share only the folder you told it to, you have to understand the immense amount of skilled hackers there are. You see how people who have never even heard of Limewire get their computers hacked every day, and Limewire damn near provides the tools with all of this "folder sharing" business. Plus, Limewire shares your IP Address (just like torrents), which is basically the key to your internet connection. Basically, this program kicks Limewire's ***, but in case you need further proof, let's weigh the advantages and disadvantages:    Free Youtube to Mp3 Converter:    Pros:  1) Shares absolutely nothing, not even the IP Address. You're not required to share with anyone else.    2) You don't have to configure 1000's of settings as soon as you start the software (as you do with limewire). You just pick the folder you want to save it to, and then start downloading    3) No viruses.    4) Preview before you play    Cons:  n/a      Limewire:  Pros:  - You can download free music    Cons:  - Everything else    Now as I said before, this software is completely free, and can be downloaded from www.dvdvideosoft.com

Ja7ytPJUaa	If you have verizon wireless, they have a program you can use that's teamed up with rhapsody.  Just add your music to that program, it's a lot like itunes.  You need a usb cord though.  My friend has a voyager and i think my cord worked with her phone.  Connect your phone to the cord and open up your music menu.  There should be a sync option on your phone.  I do it all the time.    You can also use Windows Media Player and sync stuff.  Add music from it to the sync list, and chose your device.  Hit sync.    Hope I helped.

KFjEkOlPaa	A used Yamaha DTXtreme 1 or 2 could be found on ebay or locally. Those are awesome sets.     $600 can get you a few Alesis brand drum sets, those are solid too. It really doesn't matter which of the major brands you buy as long as there are replacement parts available such as the triggers or the mesh heads.     Also a big thing for me is the bass pedal. Some cheaper sets have just a stomp pad or whatver you step on. I'm a big fan of those vertically mounted pads where you mount your own bass pedal too. It improves the feel of the set and brings it closer to an acoustic feel. ALso, it's much easier to transition to an acoustic set.
33QOl2Ahaa	Get some friends on the game. Register people to your roster with their friend codes. You can then visit other people's towns.   Also, try bug catching. It makes profit just like the fish.   The first week or so with the game might start out slow, but I've had it for about 3 weeks now and I love it.   If you go to other people's towns via WiFi connection, you can get different fruits. :) Then you go back to your town and plant them.

Mario Kart has a channel that you can go online and enter tournaments without the disk.|`|ncCWnApDaa	You can't the wii's internal memory isn't big enough, those channels represent VC and wiiware games as well as wii channels like the check mii out channel, everybody votes and the Nintendo channel, as well as the browser.|`|ozM1rX7Iaa	That is impossible.

You can either upload an mp3 file (use limewire)  or just give them any video on youtube.   and you can find any video on youtube,    or    follow these steps and you can have any of their millions of ringtones sent      -step 1-  after you sign up, make sure you login      -step 2-  go to the Ventones home page and click on the free Mosquito Ringtone  link. That one will also take you to the "free ringtone preview page" and it will show   the Send to Phone button. Don't click on the Send To Phone button though!    -step 3-  Next open the Ventones site in a new browser window but leave the first   one open as well. Search for the ringtone that you want   (from their free ringtone page ) and click on it.   That will take you to their "free ringtone preview page"   which will NOT have a send to phone button    -step 4-  now go back to the first Ventones window (the one with the mosquito ringtone)  and  click on the send to phone button.    It will send you the ringtone you opened in the 2nd ventones window.   Sounds complex but it works every time for me|`|qYzlSqSPaa	http://www.createringtones.net    its definately the best site for ringtone creations. I've been recommending it for over 3 years.

JPbot4NGaa	There actually isn't much you can do!    The iPod Touch uses the WiFi connection to find where you are. It tracks the internet address and searches the internet databases for where you internet connection is. But, databases are often missing info or they are out of date.
e4hMIUGCaa	Just like a pc,if you want to conect a pc to the internet you need some parameter configuration set on the pc.Your phone is also need to be set with some parameters,like APN,homepage,ipaddress,proxy,username,pa... etc.These parameters is called WAP Profile.These parameter is provided by your cellular provider and it differ from one to another provider.So,all you have to do is to CONTACT your CS cellular provider,and ask for the parameters.Most provider provide an automatic wap setting sent to its subscriber phone via sms.Ask if your provider can do this,it will be the easiest way to configure.

Q0dzzgomaa	I would suggest that instead of downloading from Rhapsody, Napster or Limewire, you use the Free Youtube to Mp3 Converter from www.dvdvideosoft.com for the following reasons:    1) Sharing  - With limewire, they want you to share the songs you download and the songs you have. Now you can turn this option off, but who wants to sit there for hours sifting through thousands of options for the sake of a couple of songs? With the software I recommended, you don't have to share sh*t (Excuse the language)    2) Preview before you play  - With limewire, you have to start downloading the song before you can preview it. Now this might not sound like a problem to most, but for people with super fast internet connections that can download songs at the speed of light, you won't have the time to preview it before it plays because it would be on your computer before your mouse could get anywhere near that play button. Now suppose it's a virus and not the song you wanted? You see, Youtube of course lets you play the video (they don't expect you to download, so playing the video is the only thing you can do), which not only allows you to check and see whether or not it's the right song, but you can check its quality as well.     3) Virus Risks  - See, Limewire downloads from other people's computers meaning that they could've downloaded that song from anywhere. So it could potentially be a virus. But ask yourself: when was the last time you heard about Youtube having a virus? Youtube performs maintanence nearly everyday, so even if they were to get a virus, they would detect it before it could do any serious damage to the site itself.  Plus, this is Google, the masters of coding/programming. Hell, they probably made their own anti virus software to scan the videos before they're actually uploaded. You have to realize: Google is a huge company. They wouldn't let some bad computer code cooked up by an amateur hacker destroy something they paid over $1 billion for.     4) Settings  - When you download Limewire for the first time, you don't automatically start downloading music. You have to first configure what seems like thousands of unnecessary settings. These range from turning it on and off as your torrent client, to the quality, to what types of files you would like to share (why is that even there?), to settings that talk about proxies (you're probably thinking "What the hell are proxies?"). Basically, it's too much of a hassle for those of us who simply want to download a couple of songs. Well, with the software I suggested, you only do four things:  - Install  - Select the folder  - Select the quality  - Download your songs    5) Wider Variety of Music  - True enough, Limewire, Napster and those other sharing sites have a pretty large collection of songs, but when it comes down to it, Youtube is the biggest. Admit it, every song that you couldn't find on Limewire or iTunes, you could easily find on Youtube. Not only new generation songs, but songs from commercials and old/new TV Shows, 80's hits, classic rock, Def Jam Poetry, exclusive remixes, underground rap, extremely rare tracks that you thought you would never find. You're in luck especially if you listen to Hip Hop or Rock simply because of the huge amount of remixes that can be found on Youtube. Most of which can't be found on Limewire, and certainly won't be found on iTunes. But you're thinking "I don't know how to download from Youtube!" Well, now you can.       Now, for my last point (I'm almost done, stay with me), I would like to emphasize what I stated about sharing. Now even though Limewire claims to share only the folder you told it to, you have to understand the immense amount of skilled hackers there are. You see how people who have never even heard of Limewire get their computers hacked every day, and Limewire damn near provides the tools with all of this "folder sharing" business. Plus, Limewire shares your IP Address (just like torrents), which is basically the key to your internet connection. Basically, this program kicks Limewire's ***, but in case you need further proof, let's weigh the advantages and disadvantages:    Free Youtube to Mp3 Converter:    Pros:  1) Shares absolutely nothing, not even the IP Address. You're not required to share with anyone else.    2) You don't have to configure 1000's of settings as soon as you start the software (as you do with limewire). You just pick the folder you want to save it to, and then start downloading    3) No viruses.    4) Preview before you play    Cons:  n/a      Limewire:  Pros:  - You can download free music    Cons:  - Everything else    Now as I said before, this software is completely free, and can be downloaded from www.dvdvideosoft.com|`|uH5eYdLqaa	Free music download sites are usually illegal, there are plenty of sites that offer music very cheaply, I use http://www.mp3obsession.com and have had no problems with payments, downloading tracks etc|`|stqRSCfwaa	mp3raid            |`|c8Nah2iCaa	http://www.mp3-center.org/    http://www.yourmp3.net/    also isohunt.com

e8e0e4cc6750f11d7eebfe0f3af8eb0daa	Do you have an antenna connected to it?  Converter boxes need to be connected to an antenna to receive the air signals broadcast by your local stations.|`|GeSuElxUaa	Maybe the problem is that your house is too far from the broadcasting antennas. You can go to the website show below in the "source" and enter your exact address in the fields. You don't need to provide your name, email or phone number. Answer all the questions in this first page and click on submit.    After some few seconds you will get a list of channels that are available on your area. Select "Show Digital Stations only".    The second column on the list shows what kind of antenna you will need (UHF or VHF), the color indicates the side of the antenna:    Yellow - small multi-directional  Green - medium multi-directional  Bright-green - large multi-directional or small directional with pre-amplifier.    If most of your digital channels are between yellow and green colors, then I would recommend an indoor VHF/UHF antenna. If you are farther than 30 miles from the broadcasting antennas, you will need an outdoor antenna.    I hope this information helps,

Inside the controller, there should be a reset button. My ps3 froze up when I tried to update it one time. Just go to the underside of the controller and near the handle there should be a narrow shaft. Use a straightened paper clip to reach the button at the bottom, which would reset the whole system. But be warned, I think information CAN be lost. I don't remember that happening with my system, though.|`|g4UAzGuMaa	call sony|`|GhdOUsdyaa	its 1 year parts and labor. meaning if you send it in within the one year they will fix it for you free, i've never seen anything about 3 years.    my ps stop reading discs like a year ago and i filled out a claim online they sent me a box and i sent them my ps3 n got it back in 3 days. so if it's within 1 year the turn around time to get your ps3 back is great.     but i understand if your ps3 is out of warranty you get a limited warranty you have to pay for the labor it's like $56 bucks. maybe that's part of the 3yr your talking about? im not sure.    you should call them they can answer your questions and put in a claim for your ps3 at the same time.

BXyMOS2Daa	It's pretty much the same thing. The piano usually has more keys than the keyboard, and it can't do that "play a whole chord with one finger" thing that keyboards do. And obviously you can't change the sound to "strings" or "vibraphone" or "space alien".    Mostly you'll have to get used to the different feel that playing a real piano has, and learn to adjust the "volume" by how you press the keys.

6489dd6288438d0ac1d6bd81b79f0d8daa	These three cameras are very similar. I wouldn't choose the SD790 IS because it has no viewfinder. A camera with no viewfinder means you are 100% reliant on the LCD to compose your images, which is not a good idea. But, if you think you can live without one, then don't discount it.<br>  <br>  I'm just going to say...go with the new 8MP, SD1100 IS (also known as the Ixus 80 IS in other parts of the world). It has good reviews and if you like a body colour other than silver, then it's the one to get. Plus it's fairly cheap to buy.<br>  <br>  If you think you need 10MP and you want the longer zoom (5x versus 3 x), then the SD890 IS would be ok. But, it does have a slightly slower lens at  both ends.<br>  <br>  Whichever camera you select...remember to attach the wrist strap and ALWAYS use it. It's insurance against falls. And, keep it in a small case to protect it when not in use.<br>  <br>  good luck...with your choice. I'm sure you will be very happy with whichever model you choose, because they really are very nice cameras.

rk5OUyanaa	first you have to get the zune software, which you can simply download onto your computer from zune.com. after you download it its gonna ask you all these questions, which you just answer. then when the zune window opens (itll be whitish pink with swirlies) at the top it will say like music and stuff. you click on the music and drag it to the zune in the bottom left corner. then at the top if you click on zune (i think thats wat it says, its the second from the left tho) and itll tell you just synced music.     first you have to save the music to a zune file or your computer. you can get it from zune pass or another music website where they dont charge you, thats what i do.     it should also have the information in the instructions when you buy the zune...    good luck!|`|S3ADhAIlaa	You just install the zune software (they should give you a disk but if not then just download it). If you already have all your music in windows media it will just import them to the program (similar to how i-tunes does it). Then just plug in your zune, register it and the software should do the rest.|`|NenwAGklaa	U have to have the Zune software installed on your computer to get started.|`|L6wK75j1aa	for mine i dont have zune but i have some thing close i guess. all you do is plug it into the computer and it will do the rest and if it doesnt on one of your  windows media playist pages it should say sync and if that doesnt work then idc hope it works and hope it helped

Also, you have to try and make your sims graduated... but it's all up to you what you do with them really, just like in the first one.|`|f48gha45aa	There are actually goals in the Sims...<br>  If there weren't University wouldn't give you that much more to do, because live... and go to college for a period of time. lol.<br>  You need the Sims 2 first. University is an expansion of the Sims 2 game. It is not a stand alone game.|`|Tws5gVQVaa	Yeah unfortunately. The Sims 2 is the base game, the expansions are just adding extra's to it.|`|krAOUctaaa	Yes,<br>  Sims university is an add on.|`|gvO8kNp2aa	Yes, university is an add on|`|52MmZxS9aa	Anything that isn't The Sims 2 Game is usually an expansion pack which would require the game to be played.|`|bwcg5e8gaa	Yep.<br>  <br>  You need to install the Sims 2 original first.<br>  <br>  Sims2 university is an expansion.<br>  <br>  And btw,i love it. :D
f48gha45aa	I didn't even know their was a University for PS2.<br>  As far as I know, those games for the PS2 aren't expansions, but play alone games. Like, you can play pets, but you don't need the Sims 2.|`|ac53eed0ec00a2d980be53069b559e62aa	there is NO Sims 2: University games for the PS2.

UrA1ZPuRaa	This happened to me too. A friend told me to contact itunes about it. So I went to itunes, went to the itunes store, and clicked on support on the right side. I then went to contact us. Under email, it says Itunes Store Support. Then I clicked on Check Purchase History. You type in your password and then all of a sudden, your money should appear.

Go to that link and click on Check Your Purchase History  (it is the first link in blue)  That should give your money back.  If that dosent work, just click on your account name and it should pop up.|`|rC0kCufGaa	this is happening to me as well. I believe it is the iTunes store, not your ipod or your itunes, so i guess we'll just have to wait it out|`|SsbLZ10saa	I am having the same problem! Except I had about $50!! I hope iTunes can fix it!

qGfAlDd2aa	Generally, yes.  If you use a 2 way splitter, the signal going to each output is 1/2 the input.  Likewise, a 4 way splitter would send 1/4 of the input power to each output.<br>  <br>  For an analog signal, the picture would get noisy.  Digital obviously won't show noise, but if the signal level gets too low, you will get macroblocking (the big squares in the picture), freezes, etc.  If the signal level gets really low, the receiver will go to black and say "no signal".<br>  <br>  For a strong signal, multiple splits may not be a huge problem.  If you must split the signal many times, an amplifier could be added before the input to the splitter.<br>  <br>  I hope this helps.  Please return and select a Best Answer from all of those submitted.|`|a91fdc98672c951bb2b3dbcd91d1b581aa	Yes to some degree the bigger TV you'll notice it more come next Feb you will not be able to do this anymore well you can but you will need a digital receiver at every cable site.  Signal is all going digital so no more plug the cable in the back of the Tv anymore.<br>  |`|Ky0l7ZNJaa	good answer RT but also keep in mind, if u have internet through cable or phone through cable (and sometimes hd/dvr, depending if the cable house amp can do return aswell) the cable house amp will not return signal for the modems and will not work.

Wait for the updated 3250 if you can.

Especially Gary, he doesn't have a clue what he's talking about    The only models that play PS2 games are:    20GB-Discontinued, all PS2 games $500  60GB-Discontinued, all PS2 games $600, later $550  Old 80GB-Discontinued, 80% of PS2 games $500    The following DO NOT:    40GB-Discontinued $400  New 80GB-in stores $400  160GB-in stores $500    All PS3's play PSone games.    An easy way to tell if a PS3 will play PS2 games    4USB ports=YES  2USB ports=NO    The reason is that the cost of putting the PS2 chip  and the PS2 graphics card in the PS3 was VERY expensive,  and as the PS2 only has about a year left (before it is  discontinued), Sony saw no reason to lose even more  money than they already are losing on the PS3, and  hence there is no backwards compatibility on PS3's today.|`|Og4Ab2dSaa	the ones they sell today don't.  i got the 80 on christmas

kDj1NSiVaa	The phone will store your first 30 messages on the sim card. These messages will have a little "data chip" icon next to the messages.    The next 500 messages will be stored on your phone's memory.     As your inbox and sent message folders fill up, the phone will send you a message when you are about 75% full. When deleting messages, be sure to also delete messages from the sent messages folder, as people usually forget this, but it contains approximately half your messages!    Once you have deleted all your messages, your phone will once again begin storing them first in your sim card, and then in your phone.    Have fun texting!|`|ZtECjEPyaa	does it really matter? check in the manual.|`|zRhvDILfaa	The phone has room for 500 messages. The SIM card can hold about 30|`|2aVjyi0aaa	Yes 500 by phone and 30 by sim.   The difference is that you can't 'lock' the msgs in the sim (for unintentional deletion)...but you can move the inbox msg from sim to phone and vice versa.
oJtuvifjaa	I have this phone and I am pretty sur you cannot delete those default pictures(at least they aren't dumb smiley faces like other phones) The only way I know of to have just vibrate for text is turning the volume down, but I am assuming you don't want the volume down...I don't think you can change it o it just vibrates for texts and rings for calls if that's what you want.
fwnqB0dTaa	I had some of those problems until my phone updated itself to the latest firmware.    The camera speeded up a lot when it installed.    As for the number problem, that just needs some getting used to, I have fairly large fingers so often put the wrong numbers in when I started using mine, but now (after about 3 months) I'm error free.    I would advise keeping it.    Also, you need to check the contract you signed, mine stated I could only return it for actual problems, not just because I didn't like it.
w4I9oj2Maa	TV A because of the 6.5 ms response time...it's better than the 8 ms response...    Also, the Candelas are very close, and the > contrast ratio is high enough to not really need the DYNAMIC contrast enhancement turned on...
AA10788612	You should. But the only way to see 1080i is if your old TV has an HDMI input. That's the only way a Blu-ray player will give you max res. If you use any other connection, your not likley to see any major noticeable diff.
3oHgyKyJaa	Don't listen to that guy, I too have a 2nd gen iPod touch and I am awaiting the jailbreak. The dev team has jailbroken the 2g.

And yes there will probably be a way to get paid applications for free, there always is.|`|8yTxkqHUaa	Right now it is not expected to come out.  But no jailbreak is safe anyway.

You just go to <a href="http://www.YourFreeiPhone.com/index.php?ref=5463277" rel="nofollow">http://www.YourFreeiPhone.com/index.php?...</a> sign up, and choose a referal account over a points account. Then they want you to sign up for an offer(this is the FREE part). You sign up with blockbuster, and you pay $10. This is how you get it back. You have to wait 7 days to get credit for signing up with blockbuster, then you just call them and tell them you dont want your account and they refund every penny back. Now all you got to do is tell your friends and family to do what you did, because you need 8 to 10 referals (depending on the size of the iPhone) and they will ship it to you for free. When you sign up, give me your referal number and i will sign up under your name and that will be 1 less referal you need to worry about.|`|Ktt1FX6zaa	Dont put it down to luck.

AA10022099	http://www.tracfone.com it is awesome it is a prepaid phone with no age limits no montly bills no hidden fees/costs and no contracts and with all the calling features such as free voicemail free caller id free call waiting and free nationwide long distance. all for as little as $10 a month calculated minimum usage because you have to buy a minute card every 60 or every 365 days depending on if you bought the year service card because the cheapest minute card is 20 dollars and you would have to add one every 60 days it would be around $10 a month which isnt bad. Hope this Helps!!!!!! Tracfone Wireless is awesome good luck choosing your phone!!    P.S. and a phone kit is only about $20 bucks @ your local walmart walgreens and family dollar stores etc. this includes up to 20 minutes and 60 days of wireless service included  And I will tell you when Tracfone Says they have "Nationwide coverage" they absolutely mean it I use it all the time and I would rather have nationwide coverage across the U.S. than have free mobile web on fridays with boost mobile but it all depends on the user preference or even if you want to make the monthly cost go down get a year service card for $100 and it works out to be $8.33 a month which is even cheaper than the $10 I mentioned earlier.    Hope this helps!! :)|`|AA11305832	I would have to go with either Cingular Go Phones or Virgin Mobile. But the only camera phone Cingular has that's prepaid is the RAZR. Virgin has 3 camera phones, and all of their phones can be put on prepaid service. I have a tracfone nokia 1100 now and its literally the most low tech phone on the market. Tracfones are good if you use the phone only for emergencies, because their phones are the next closest things to calculators and their rates are relatively expensive(about $1 per minute, as opposed to Virgin's Minute to Minute Plan of 25 cents per minute for the first ten minutes of the day, 10 cents for the rest of the day.) It all depends on how much you use the phone. If you use it a lot, go with a Cingular or Virgin Mobile. If you dont use it that much, then Tracfones are for you.|`|4de820a22e9d8b78e11fe1cd65f622fbaa	i want to say cingular.  but it all depends what services are provide in WI
AA12169898	OK, First make sure the headset is fully charged. Then turn the headset on. then close the boom mic, hold the multi function button(the one with the pic of the handset) till the light is solid, then open up the mic. it should stay solid blue...while the earpiece is still blue go to the bluetooth settings on your phone and and "search for devices" or look for hands free... once your phone finds the device it will ask for the passkey... all bluetooth headsets default to 0000 .... one the phone & the headset pair. you should be good to go.

pC2jGRKraa	Depends what cameras they are. Most modern film cameras are worthless, and though 35mm SLRs are worth a bit and are very useful to have and learn with. AF 35mm SLR lenses will fetch good money too since they are compatible with dSLRs, and MF lenses (e.g. Canon FD) can also be sold.    In terms of film cameras, Leica is probably where the money's at, and there are collectors out there.    Bottom line is I doubt 35mm film will die out any time soon, but most people don't need P+S film cameras, since digital is smaller, and cheaper.|`|AqKALUItaa	Check the "Used" sections at Adorama and B&H to see if the current prices make it worth it to you to sell.|`|pZGLhV2Waa	If you are not going to use them and can get a good price for them why not. Use the money to put into some nice lenses for your digital cameras.|`|UDbyuCX1aa	SLR Film cameras are already hard to sell. Professional Nikon and Canon seem to do alright, but at a fraction of their original price. If you are trying to sell consumer grade 35mm SLR, then you basically get a few dollars over the value of the lens you are trying to sell it with. That's how I ended up with my Rebel 2000 - it came with a lens I wanted and I use it as a backup or in situations I don't want to risk with my digital SLR such as white water rafting, backpacking, soccer games in the rain. Craigslist is full of people who bought a $200 35mm SLR for a film class last year and are now trying to unload it.     On the other hand, its not like the value will go up and it's just taking space in your house now and so this goes for everything you have that you don't use- move it along now if you don't want it.|`|1abaa60b0511b1e2c248dd1b30e73037aa	USE CRAIGSLIST

lEYrs02Raa	I think you've confused yourself.  Read a little more on the description of the A590 IS.  Although the A590 can use MMC, it can also use SD and/or SDHC.   In effect, all three cards can be used with no problem. So you're fine.|`|tWoN22rRaa	Multimediacard was the predecessor to Secure Digital. Physically they are nearly identically, save for the extra pin (for the optional encryption) and a lock tab that prevents data from being written or deleted.    MMC is essentially obsolete now. When a camera says it supports it what it really means is that it uses SD, which itself is still backwards compatible in case you happen to have some old MMC cards lying around.|`|4NxXKJBjaa	SD cards add support for trusted computing to have the ability to lock content (mostly music) to the card.

9CKrP9Keaa	A locked phone limits you to the provider the phone is locked to. If your phone says T-Mobile, it's locked and you cannot use it with ATT. If you get the phone unlocked, then you can use it with either T-Mo or ATT.
piDDZ6Ywaa	I'm trying to understand your question fully! Okay, did you get the disk with your phone? I mean, you should have a disk with your phone when you bought it for the software to transfer music and pictures to and from the phone and computer. I've got this link for you for your software. I had to sign up for my phone software download to download the software, it won't take long to register, here's the link for it.     https://www.forum.nokia.com/Sign_Up.xhtm...    And here's the link to download the software PC suite for your phone model (this link is software for your phone model)  http://www.nokia.co.uk/A4222024    So you can just download the PC suite straight away, just stroll down. But sign up first!     And, if it works, plug the wire into your USB port, and then plug the USB port to your phone. Then either open PC suite and transfer music and pictures, etc from there. If you have a memory installation card on your phone, l just go on Start > My computer > removable disc    And then put whatever i want on my memory card from there.    Hope this helped by the way, if not, then.. Let me know? :D    xxxxxx

SBLHtsOaaa	I don't have one, but two of my friends do.  The touch screen causes the battery to die quicker than usual, but that's not a big problem. Easy fix.  One of my friends dropped it in the toilet (don't even ask, lol) and it killed the outside screen. The screen was nothing but black. But it still made sound, and vibrated, so you could know when you had a call (or text). The inside screen still worked fine, as with all the buttons.    Personally, I have the Venus. I think its discontinued now, but I really like it. It doesn't have a full keyboard though.. so if you're looking for that, the Venus won't help.

jYbksRPyaa	att because it has a 3g network and has lots of cool phones.  the good thing about att is that it has phones with sim cards and you can ask them to unlock in 3 months and when you contract is over you can sell your phone.  The bad thing about verizon is it is cdma and it doesnt carry sim cards.  if you break your att phone then you buy one ebay and just switch the sim card. but if you have verizon you have to call them to activate your phone and a lots of other stuff.  plus att has rollover so all your unused minutes goes to the next month. plus att has MORE CELL TOWERS THAN VERIZON. Besides who cares that verizon bought over alltel.  so join att and you will be happier. remember att "your world connected". and if anybody says att has one bar for service then they are wrong because att bought over cingular which means that they have all 5 bars.|`|6ec9c15e78a0d1c4abf71bfebcde7755aa	Definitely Verizon. They have way better service than AT&T. They just bought out Alltell also, which means Verizon will be getting all of Alltells cell towers, which means even better service to come! Everywhere i go i have found the lowest I've had was 1 bar of service, and my neighbor has 1 bar, if that, everywhere he goes. AT&T has the largest percentage of dropped calls and areas of no service also. Go with Verizon if your debating between AT&T and Verizon.

G6yyceAxaa	a pay monthly plan is basically a plan without a contract, with a contract you often get a phone at no cost, but you have to promise to use the service for a certain amount of time, and if you break the promise, you pay a fee (early termination fees) a monthly plan, you can buy the phone (phones cost about 300.00 for a good model new) and use the service without a contract, and if you decide to terminate the service, no harm no foul.    make sure you go to the companies website and check your coverage before you get the service, not all companies work in all areas, and also read the fine print.  for instance, people are not aware that Alltel has been bought out by verizon, and soon will not have the pick 5 plan, so if you get an alltel phone in a few months you will have to sign up for a verizon call plan.|`|QRw8AhX7aa	The phone is free - you pay a set amount each month for calls & texts usually between 15.00 to 50.00 depending on how much usage you want.|`|SGoR53YJaa	its just like having a prepaid phone but you have better rates and you don't have to worry about having a contract.  if you don't want it one month just don't pay and you won't have to worry about a cancellation fee.|`|ouIZdXdaaa	the phone is free what you are paying for is the tariff so the number of texts and mintues you get a month...  you pay monthly and get your set texts and minutes, if you go over them you have to pay more depending on how much you go over.|`|1oHtKLcmaa	What it means is that you have a contract with a mobile phone company. You pay them a certain amount of money each month for call time and texts. They give you a free phone as part of the deal.|`|ZjiEQ3CGaa	it means the phone is free but you pay for a monthly plan for minutes and you chosse which plan you want different plans are different prices it depends how many minutes you get and services like web and im|`|SNplQjfjaa	you get the phone free, you have to pay for your airtime and texts, I get 600 mins and 500 texts for 21 from O2.|`|zL8dqzW1aa	It means you pay a set amount each month and a certain limit of minutes and txt's will be included, if you go over you pay for every minute/txt you go over. If the phone's free then it means you don't pay any extra for the actual handset.    It's a really simple plan but your stuck with it for a certain amount of time so make sure it's what you want. If you do get it and decide to cancel, you'll have to pay what you owe.     I prefer it to Pay as you Go because it's helpful in emergencies (no "I've ran out of credit!").
AA10368751	VGA is analogue HDMI is all digital.  With HDMI, all your color setting and pixel representation is all digital and you don't even have to mess with the settings.  With VGA, you might see slight visual distortion across the monitor since the pixel is representing an analogue signal.  Some monitors (expensive) ones do lot of filtering to get the VGA signal as clean as digital but you still can't beat the digital signal.|`|AA11665518	yes hdmi is digital and vga is analog digital is better
1c56d6640f8046a9cd43f450d0c344a0aa	Sounds like you have your TV hooked up with either an analog connection and are applying a "movie mode" DSP(perhaps pro logic) effect to the stereo input to achieve some 5.1-like effect. This will center most all voices in the center channel, it will take some of the sound effects and music and keep those in the right and left speakers. However, very little will go to the surround speakers.    For the CD you may be applying a 5CH stereo type option that replicates the front right and left into the surround right and left and mixes the right and left for the center.     If you want to test your system use a DVD internal to the system(assuming you have a Bose receiver as well) and test with this. If you hear surround effects with this then its simply a limitation of the way your system is connected.|`|Wet77WBXaa	try calling customer service.|`|rl11rrqVaa	Idea!  =  IT IS TOO OLD!

I got my wii for Christmas and just a few weeks ago, it wouldn't turn on. I tried Everything and it wouldn't work! Ok this is what I did, First I unplugged everything on it. Then I plugged everything back in. If that does not work, Put it in another plug near by. It worked for me! Hope it gets fixed!
AA10368751	The cellphones from ebay are split between small shops that are selling the plans along with phone or just individual like me who's just trying to get rid of my phone.  If you are buying from a small shop with the plans then you will have to choose your phone and sign a contract with them.  If you are buying from an individual, make sure the phone is compatible types.  For example, GSM phone are all compatible granted that the phone is "unlocked".  Unlocked phone can take any GSM SIM card off your current GSM phone and it will work by switching the SIM to the new phone.  If the GSM phone doesn't state it's unlocked then you will not be able to use it because the locked phones will require an unlock key.  However, this is only the case if you are trying to use a GSM phone from different provider.  If you currently have a Sprint GSM phone then any Sprint GSM phone will work.  Like wise Cingular GSM phone will work with any Cingular GSM phone.  The lock and unlocked are only concerned if you are trying to use phone from different provider.  i.e. Sprint phone will not work when locked with a Cingular code but Sprint phone will work when used with an unlocked Cingular phone.    If you have a CDMA phone then you will also need to get the CDMA phone from the same provider.  There is no lock or unlock with CDMA except that you will have to call the provider and give them your new ESN number in the back of the battery.  I'm pretty sure CDMA phones are all provider dependent and it cannot be changed to a different provider since ESN are what the provider uses to track the phone unlike GSM phones which uses the GSM chip to track the phone.  I've seen however, foreign country CDMA phone can be ported since those phones will not conflict within US.  Meaning foreign CDMA phone's ESN were never registered with any US based service provider hence you could use foreign ones but it'll be a lot of head ache for the provider to get those work in their system.|`|YWRAfF1Caa	Here's a better option     http://pinurl.com/r4    They are verified members of Fair Trade Authority and the Better Business Bureau . Many Powersellers on ebay get stuff to sell from here .|`|IEVoEQFIaa	As far as I know , you must already have service.  The phones on ebay are not activated, you purchase to upgrade your existing phone.  There for the phone you purchase must be compatible with your service provider.

AA12343006	Well I don't know if you're into the interchangeable face plates the sidekick 08 is capable of having. I've read that the battery can last up to barely a day if you're a heavy user.    The LX on the other hand has a better battery and it has those mood lights (the lights that light up at four corners of phone, and I'm not talking about the trackball). The LX also has flash and the 08 doesn't.    Get whatever you feel better with. Or you can always wait for the new one to come. Which I'm sure it's going to be some time this year. I read a rumor about a new one at tmonews.com

Do you mean a three way call? If that is what you mean then alot of cellphone companies will include 3-way calling into your plan so there is no additional cost for that... Just make sure that when you end the call that your phone doesn't think that someone is still on the line otherwise you might rack up some minutes.. But other than that you should be fine.

Then attach your new phone to the PC and restore the messages from the PC to your new phone.    It really is a lot of effort though.  If you only have a few messages to transfer you could always text them to someone else from your old phone, swap the SIM card in to the new one and get them to send them back to you!|`|7ddb9e3468a6a8fd4e97f1c6f7dba301aa	6330i? i only know of 6310i, 6340, 6360 and 6370. did u mean 6230i? anyway,d best way to go is the PC Suite way. synchronize ur old phone with ur new phones PC Suite (which is d hardest part cos it may not support ur phone). by synching, u transfer contacts, messages and calendar to ur PC. then synch. ur n80 with d PC Suite and all d info will go into d n80...goodluck.

e7663cf7226c2b25f5a64eeea04103cfaa	You're going to have to do some research on that one.  Decide exactly what you want a plan, and go to their websites and compare.  Also, as far as customer service thing, that is local.  Go into each one of their stores and see how they treat you whenenver you go in, see how helpful they are, etc.    I have AT&T because Verizon wasn't really big around where I live until just now, but I have loved AT&T since I've been with them.  They have great phones, just as good as Verizon, and you can bet on if one of them doesn't have a phone at that moment, they will get it eventually.  Occasionally with AT&T I have a hard time getting calls to go through, but you can't expect every service to be 100% perfect 100% of the time, so just know that.    Also, look at other things as well.  Do you go out of town a lot?  Would local cover your calls completely?  My dad and I travel a lot because of family, so we ended up with National plan which really isn't that bad.  Do you plan on sending MMS (picture texting) as well as SMS (normal texting)?  Because if you do, you will probably need some data too.  Plus, you may need data if you plan on having a smart phone where you can check your email or facebook from time to time.  It can get expensive if it doesn't come with your plan already.      Good luck!    ---  edit: and look at who you call the most and what plans they have.  My boyfriend also has AT&T, as well as my mom and my dad, and a couple of my friends, so I rarely use up any minutes because I have free mobile to mobile|`|yIHlvPFfaa	okay go at&t because verizon sucks  i have verizon and my texts dont send and everything is all messed up but i dont know what the prices are but i do know im switching to at&t for a better service|`|29WFvvNPaa	GET VERISON.

Also you may want to consider really how much you really text.  if you send about 5,000 a month and they have a plan that has 7,000 for 5.00 and unlimited for 10.00 you would be wasting money getting the unlimited. sorta like going to an all you can eat, and only having a salad.|`|e71MWgJJaa	att alot cheaper nice phones also.|`|08a542503113638ff89e9695a92c2c8baa	Neither.

Verizon is known to offer the best coverage nationwide. Better yet, you can buy an inexpensive Pre-Paid and for only 15.00 per month you have unlimited texting with no additional cost. This is based on your saying you won't be using your phone for calls, however the Text package is only 10.00 per month and Verizon Pre-Paid cards start at 15.00 so you would actually have 5.00 left per month for calls OR the 5.00 will actually Roll Over if you add another 15.00 Pre-Paid card on or before the 30 day plan. I have seen Verizon Pre-Paid phones for as little as 20.00, Wal-Mart often has them for around 29.99, sometimes with free start-up time. Here's how it works. Buy your Verizon Pre-paid Phone and one 15.00 card. Add the card to your phone by going to Menu, then, My Account, then press 3 to add the PIN code for the card. Then either call Verizon for free and add the text package for 10.00 or using your phone choose either 7 or 8 in the My Account option and add the text yourself. Verizon will deduct only 10.00 and show you your balance. Remember just add another 15.00 card before the 30 days to roll over that 5.00!  Hope this helps.|`|ZJiaNTmJaa	Both have unlimited texting, it depends really on what your friends have. If most of your friends have AT&T, then go to AT&T and you can pay less for unlimited mobile-to-mobile text. Vice-versa with Verizon. Now for phones.. Verizon has the Alias, enV2, enV, and I think even more (those all have QWERTY keyboards). If you want a touchscreen then you should probably go for the Dare. Or, if you want both, then go for either the Glyde or the Voyager. There's also a lot more that you can choose from. Now AT&T- AT&T just released 4 quick-messaging phones in late 2008: AT&T Quickfire (made by UTStarcom), Pantech Matrix, Samsung Propel, and Pantech Slate. I have the Matrix, and I would advise you steer clear of it. The slider feels loose after about a month, and there's many software gimmicks. Like you can't lock a message if you want to save it. Quickfire- My little brother has the Quickfire. It has a QWERTY keyboard, and a touch screen. I like it, he likes it, but when I try to use it, the touch screen won't respond to me. When he uses it it's just fine, though, maybe I'm just not used to the way you have to press it. Sometimes it can get laggy too, just a warning. Propel- I like the Propel, I wish I would have gotten that one, but at first glance don't let it fool you, the keys are small. I guess it takes some time to get used to those. Looks like a nice phone, though. Not sure on features there. Same with the Pantech Slate. If you want a thin QWERTY phone this is for you- it's the thinnest QWERTY phone in the world. I avoided this one because I wasn't fond of the navigation array, but it too looks pretty nice.

jYbksRPyaa	att because it has a 3g network and has lots of cool phones.  the good thing about att is that it has phones with sim cards and you can ask them to unlock in 3 months and when you contract is over you can sell your phone.  The bad thing about verizon is it is cdma and it doesnt carry sim cards. if you break your att phone then you buy one ebay and just switch the sim card. but if you have verizon you have to call them to activate your phone and a lots of other stuff. plus att has rollover so all your unused minutes goes to the next month. plus att has MORE CELL TOWERS THAN VERIZON. Besides who cares that verizon bought over alltel. so join att and you will be happier. remember att "your world connected". and if anybody says att has one bar for service then they are wrong because att bought over cingular which means that they have all 5 bars.|`|Ps9N7CcDaa	Hey KC, my name is BJ DeHut and I am a representative for Sprint.  First off, in many tests (check out Gizmodo for their 3G data test), Sprint has proven it has the best 3G service in the US.  Though, much of this is dependent on location, so I recommend you check out what your coverage will be like before you make a switch.  Check this map out: http://coverage.sprintpcs.com/IMPACT.jsp...  Overall, you would save a lot of money with Sprint comparatively to other plans, plus youll have the opportunity to wait for the Palm pre which promises to be one of the best smartphones ever created.

Hope i helped. =]|`|AA11762928	Ok first off, if you do a little research Sprint also has MUCH worse customer service and lousy cell service. (Which is why they are losing customers faster than they are signing them up!)    The guy talking about AT&T, they are just as bad as sprint with the network issues and poor customer service.  All networks have 3G speed so you don't need AT&T just for 3G.  And about the AT&T has more towers thing, they have more towers but in poor locations.  They need more towers just so you can get a signal.  Verizon was one of the first to set up towers and for this reason got prime spots that offer optimal service.    I would try to call Verizon and bargain.  If you say you are considering canceling and ask for the retention department they can usually work out a nice deal (i.e. lower rates) to keep you happy.

O5l1Url3aa	You can connect it to your computer with usb cord. If your phone didn't come with one, just pop your micro sd card into your computer to get your music on the phone.
xmr7W8ndaa	I have great respect for Lucas creating the THX specification for movie theaters.    But if you study amps, speakers and televisions - you will find lots of good gear that  rivals or goes beyond the TXH specs - but they just dont pay the thousands of dollars to get the gear tested so they can put "THX" on the box.    So as long as you are buying a well respected Sony, Pioneer, Panasonic or Sharp/Samsung - you dont need to spend the extra money for THX certification. In my opinion.
ygObe8lRaa	My wife uses wii fit quite a bit, and has pretty much everything unlocked.  She hasn't seen pilates in the game at all.

They have cheap international call rates compared to its peers too. Try it if you like.

rfwbZ2AXaa	I have had problems with my iPod before as well.   I searched all over google.com for ways to fix it.  There are sites that help with rebooting the ipod and such, that may be something you have to do.

I have had to reset my ipod tons!! But its ok, I just keep on trying.    Good luck  Beth|`|hDVJjpyHaa	That happened to me as well, it might be because the Battery died, take to a shop or buy yourself a new Battery, that was my problem.
