xzxjraEzaa	16 tons ought to do it as long as your structure can withstand monstrous forces as the links approach a straight line.    Figuring 1" of stroke left to go, gives a total 47" frame pin to ram pin.     Given this, we can visualize a triangle with a 24" hypotenuse and one leg 23.5".  Solving this right triangle for the other leg tells us there will be 4.87" of travel left to run that last inch of stroke.    Thinking back a handful of decades to statics classes, I would say we're looking at the vectors of something like 47" and 4.87" and figure on a mechanical advantage of 9.65:1 when the ram has 1" of travel left.    Dividing 300,000 lbs by 9.65 gives 31,085 lbs of lateral force necessary to provide 150 tons, so you can round it up to 16 tons.    Bear in mind, the force will escalate astronomically, theoretically to infinity, as the arms approach full 48" extension.  That's why presses are made so massive.  With that much stored potential energy as a massive spring, they can and do self-destruct with deadly force!|`|RgSCstkAaa	It sounds a terrible design to me, and if you really want to obtain 150 tons of force on your press, I would arrange the hydraulic ram to be directly in line.|`|aJ0AL6RFaa	best opinion  burn u model

UkjnSyAvaa	The moon does change orientation with respect to the horizon by quite a bit. Your latitude has a lot to do with that. In the northern hemisphere, a dawn crescent moon will always be lit on the "left" side. The points may be almost horizontal like a C, especially if you are far north, or they may be pointing almost straight up, like a smile. This is due to the constantly changing angle of the ecliptic. If you study the movement of the ecliptic with respect to times of day and time of year, you can predict which angle it will be.    The dusk crescent would be the opposite direction, but the points will always be up and to the left while the curve will be down and to the right.

This quantum foam is made of particles and micro-black holes popping in and out of existence, apparently in contravention of the second law of thermodynamics, they appear out of nothing with energy, then disappear again just as quickly.     The key to this is the uncertainty principle. The disturbance is permitted to borrow a tiny amount of energy and exist for a very short length of time, and then it must return the energy and disappear again. But, the more energy it borrows, the less time it is allowed to exist.

mo5fTs64aa	It's easy enough to prove though.    For any a,b in Q (the set of rationals),   (a+1) is in Q and clearly  (a+1)+b*sqrt(2)>a+b*sqrt(2)  Thus there is no least upper bound.|`|IUmAflSqaa	Wikipedia says: "If an ordered set S has the property that every nonempty subset of S having an upper bound also has a least upper bound, then S is said to have the least-upper-bound property."    So if we want to prove that such a set S does NOT have the least upper bound property, we want to show that there exists a nonempty subset of S that has an upper bound but that does NOT have a least upper bound.  So our hand is kind of forced--we need to show the existence of such a set, and the easiest way to do this is to provide an example.    So a typical argument that Q does not have the least upper bound property is to take the set U = {x in Q: x     1. show that U does not contain an upper bound, i.e. show for all rationals y     2. show 2 is not in Q;    3. show that for any rational y > 2, there is a rational y > z > 2.    1. implies that any upper bound for U must be  2, 2. implies that any upper bound for U must be > 2, and 3. implies that no upper bound is a least upper bound.    So let's mimic this proof.  The first problem is we cannot take the set V = {x in F: x     So maybe let's find an irrational number a such that a is not in F, and then show that V = {x in F: x     1. V does not contain an upper bound for itself: indeed, if y is in V, then a-y > 0.  We know that the limit as n goes to infinity of 1/n is 0, so there is some natural number n so that a-y > 1/n.  Then a > y+1/n > y, and y+1/n is in V: y and 1/n are in F, and F is closed under addition.    2. For any y in F so that y > a, there is z in F so that y > z > a.  The proof here is very similar: y-a > 0, find n large enough so that y-a > 1/n, and let z = y-1/n > a.    So now we just have to produce a real number a so that a is not in F.  How can we do this?    1. Cardinality argument: R is uncountable, F is countable (it's at most [in fact, exactly] as big as QxQ, which is countbale), so there is a point in R not in F.    2. Use reals we know something about:  is not algebraic; all of the elements of F are algebraic (c+d2 satisfies the rational polynomial f(x) = x^2-2cx+c^2-2d^2 and is hence algebraic).  So  is not in F.    3. Actually construct a real which is not in F: Consider a = 3.  Is a in F?  If so, then a = c+d2 for some rationals c, d.  Thus a satisfies:    x^2-2cx+c^2-2d^2    a also satisfies:    x^2-3    So a satisfies their difference:    -2cx+c^2-2d^2+3    Well, a is irrational (by the same sort of proof that shows 2 is irrational).  If c  0, then a satisfies a linear polynomial with rational coefficients and hence must be rational.  So c = 0.  Thus the above polynomial is the constant -2d^2+3.  But this must equal 0, as we know a root of this constant polynomial exists (namely, a).  Thus:    3 = 2d^2  3/2 = d^2  d = (3/2)    The same sort of argument about the irrationality of 2 and 3 shows that (3/2) is irrational.  So this is impossible, 3 is not in F.

Hw5xFK0qaa	For a solution to conduct it needs to have a significant amount of ions dissolved.  Pure water has very few ions - only those from the auto-ionisation of water itself - which are insufficient in number for any meaningful amount of conduction.|`|AA10008098	Consider that a battery is a source of electrical pressure (voltage) and there is no current unless there is an external circuit (perhaps a copper wire).  The voltage pushes electrons into the wire which pushes electrons all along the wire pushing the exact same number of electrons through any load and back to the opposite pole of the battery.    If you use a 'glass' wire there will be no current because the glass is a good electrical insulator having too few electrons to be pushed along to sustain a current.  Pure water (H2O) has too few free electrons to sustain a current.  A copper wire exhibits a collective cloud of free electrons that are easily stripped from one copper atom and passed on to the next when under electrical pressure.  Water must contain an electrolyte that supplies + and - charged particles that can carry an electrical current under electrical pressure.  Of course if the electrical pressure is high enough and the gap small enough current may arc through the water.
TL1Jkqunaa	Their edges are exposed and so melt faster from top and sides, this also means they have a higher surface to volume ratio that increases as melting continues.  Also at the edges the warming ground lets melting occur underneath the ice, and readily move upwards.  This helps to thin the edge from beneath. .    In the center, the dome part of the glacier warming occurs only on the top.  Since heat tends to move upward it does not penetrate the ice well.
SvmZlLdaaa	In civilised countries, yes. It's true that captive conditions in the past were often cruel, the animals being kept in cramped cages and so on, and indeed this is sometimes still the case in some countries. However, in countries like the UK and US, zoos are carefully regulated - the animals are kept in conditions as close as possible to their natural habitat, with plenty of space, good diets and immediate medical care if they need it. Everything possible is done to ensure that they don't get bored - environmental enrichment is found in all good zoos. The animals will have scenery in their enclosure, things to play with if they're a playful species, and problems to solve in order to get their food, rather than it just being dropped in front of them.    In today's world, zoos are nothing short of essential. Their main function is conservation. Without captive breeding, many endangered species would now be extinct - for example, the golden lion tamarin, red wolf and Przewalski's horse. I am not for a moment suggesting that we should stop trying to protect animals' natural habitats, but if endangered species were to become extinct in the wild (which sadly seems quite likely in the near future), zoos will have preserved them for future generations, with enough genetic diversity that the possibility for reintroduction to the wild exists. In my opinion it would be unforgivable to allow tigers, pandas and so on to become extinct because they were wiped out in the wild due to hunting, habitat loss, etc., and people did not want to see them in captivity. Would you like to have explain to your children or grandchildren that they will never see a tiger except in pictures, because you disagreed with zoos? I certainly wouldn't.    Zoos are also vital for education, enabling people to see beautiful wild animals that they would never otherwise get to see, and teaching them about the threats to their species, which hopefully encourages them to respect and protect animals. The money they bring in is used to pay for the animals' food and care and to fund breeding programmes, as well as the employees' wages. Some also goes towards funding the protection of animals in the wild, and their habitats.    It's also important to remember that animals are not taken from the wild for zoos - that stopped several hundred years ago. Animals in zoos are captive-bred - they were born in captivity, as were their parents, grandparents, great-grandparents and so on. They have known nothing else, and have no idea such a thing as the wild exists, so there is no way they can miss it. They are certainly not unhappy - if they were, zoos would not achieve the breeding success they do (unhappy or unhealthy animals do not breed). One might even argue that they are better off in captivity, since they do not have to contend with the constant dangers of the wild - disease, injury, predation, starvation, etc.|`|PSiNv7gUaa	In most zoos, yes.  The American Association of Zoos and Aquariums (AZA) accredits zoos who passed regular and rigorous inspections, and have very high standards for accreditation.  Most zoos these days require you to have experience working/volunteering at an accredited zoo to consider hiring you.    There are, however, many smaller zoos and private zoos where the animals are NOT kept in the best conditions.  These zoos are ineligible for accreditation, and I personally refuse to pay money to visit these establishments.  The sad part is, they can to an extent get away with it, as state and county laws concerning animal welfare sometimes only require the bare minimum for animal care.|`|wNK5Bzv1aa	Yes, that is the purpose of zoos  - to preserve species for observation and some endangered species.  Of course, there are always exceptions around the world, especially if they are not properly funded.|`|2lQ8DJAcaa	Before we consider the reasons that are usually given for the survival of zoos, we should see that there is a moral presumption against keeping wild animals in captivity. What this involves, after all, is taking animals out of their native habitats, transporting them great distances and keeping them in alien environments in which their liberty is severely restricted. It is surely true that in being taken from the wild and confined in zoos, animals are deprived of a great many goods. For the most part they are prevented from gathering their own food, developing their own social orders and generally behaving in ways that are natural to them. These activities all require significantly more liberty than most animals are permitted in zoos. If we are justified in keeping animals in zoos, it must be because there are some important benefits that can be obtained only by doing so.    This conclusion is not the property of some particular moral theory; it follows from most reasonable moral theories. Either we have duties to animals or we do not. If we do have duties to animals, surely they include respecting those interests which are most important to them, so long as this does not conflict with other, more stringent duties that we may have. Since an interest in not being taken from the wild and kept confined is very important for most animals, it follows that if everything else is equal, we should respect this interest.    The means of confinement mark a difference between humans and animals. They are there at our pleasure, to be used for our purposes. Morality and perhaps our very survival require that we learn to live as one species among many rather than as one species over many. To do this, we must forget what we learn at zoos. Because what zoos teach us is false and dangerous, both humans and animals will be better off when they are abolished.|`|ku2tP4eEaa	Yes.  There is an organization that monitors and oversees zoos, the American Association of Zoos and Aquariums, AZA.  http://www.aza.org/    Zoos do not like bad news.  So they sure do not want people to see animals that appear to be not taken care of.  They do an excellent job of caring for all animals.  I have been to the St Louis Zoo recently.  It was clean and all the animals looked good.    I am a wildlife biologist.  I am not happy about some of the species kept in zoos.  Of course I'd rather see all animals free.  But that's not what zoos are about.  I'd hate to think of children growing up and not getting to see real animals.    Edit:  I see an answer that is extremist and really uncalled for.  Animal Rights folks are often border line paranoid, depressed or malcontents.  They are much like religious fanatics.  Wanting to spread their gospel and force feed you their "religion".

E0U2yII3aa	The sun was born when a massive star of more than 20x its size exploded in a powerful supernova. The shock from the supernova caused the sun's parent molecular cloud to compressed and therefore the sun was born. When the sun finally dies throwing off  all that mass through a planetary nebula and then creating a white dwarf, all the available fuel inside it's core had been now converted into elements that can never be "re-used". In fact, if you add mass like a lot of hydrogen and helium into that white dwarf, it will go into a cataclysmic explosion. If the mass is not enough to reach 1.4x the sun's current mass, the white dwarf will go into a nova. When you put enough mass for it to somehow reach around or even beyond 1.4 solar masses, the result is a Type Ia supernova that will obliterate the white dwarf altogether. After, the sun throws around half its mass in the form of a planetary nebula, that's it. the sun is doomed.

It needs hydrogen to burn, but a hydrogen particle meets up with another hydrogen particle, and forms a helium particle. Eventually the sun will run out of hydrogen particles and burn out, and it will also "swallow up" the first 4 planets. These include Mercury, Venus, Earth and Mars. But no, it cannot re-heat because it would have no hydrogen to burn. And astronomers figure that it was the big bang that created the universe. A hot, dense mass of energy was all compacted and blew up causing all the stars, asteroids, and all matter in space. The only thing the big bang did not create was planets.

Please go there and check out the various articles and  pics of stars (suns). When a star dies, its huge volume of gas   escapes into space where it drifts around until the gravity of some  other object attracts it to that object. When "enough" gases clump  together into a ball, the weight of all that gas sets off the fusion  process which is the birth of a new star. Cautionary note: It does  take a HUGE amount of gas to make this happen, so the rebirth   of this new star might take a very long time. Note that our Sun   has a diameter of roughly 865,000 Miles and the diameter of the  Earth is only roughly 8,000 Miles. So, as I said, it takes a HUGE  ball of gas to kick off the fusion process.

Hw5xFK0qaa	For a function f(x), the Taylor series about some value a is:    f(a) + [f'(a) * (x - a) / 1!] + [f''(a) * (x - a)2 / 2!] + [f'''(a) * (x - a)3 / 3!] + ...    and the Maclaurin series is the Taylor series when a = 0.    f(0) + [f'(0) * x / 1!] + [f''(0) * x2 / 2!] + [f'''(0) * x3 / 3!] + ...    Since each term includes the value of the next derivative evaluated at a, the difficulty in finding a Taylor or Maclaurin series arises in finding a general formula for d^ny/dx^n.  In the case of y = e^x, however, this is trivial:    y = e^x    dy/dx = e^x    d2y/dx2 = e^x    and in general d^ny/dx^n = e^x    At x = 0, y = e^0 = 1 and d^ny/dx^n = e^0 = 1    So, the Maclaurin series is:    f(0) + [f'(0) * x / 1!] + [f''(0) * x2 / 2!] + [f'''(0) * x3 / 3!] + ...    = 1 + [1 * x / 1!] + [1 * x2 / 2!] + [1 * x3 / 3!] + ...    = 1 + x + (x2 / 2!) + (x3 / 3!) + ...    The radius of convergence, r, is given by:    r = lim(n  ) |c_n / c_n+1|    where c_n is the coefficient of the term in x^n.  In this case, c_n = 1 / n!    So, r = lim(n  ) |(1 / n!)  [1 / (n + 1)!]|    = lim(n  ) |(1 / n!) * [(n + 1)! / 1]|    = lim(n  ) |(n + 1)! / n!|    = lim(n  ) |(n + 1) * n! / n!|    = lim(n  ) |n + 1|     +    So, the radius of convergence is infinite and thus the Maclaurin series converges to e^x for all x.

Now chew some boiled rice well for ten minutes and put it in another test tube.Pour few drops of iodine solution. You will notice no change in color.

Hw5xFK0qaa	234 ??????????? 234 ????????? 0  ?????Th ??  ??????Pa ?? + ?? e  ??90 ????????????? 91 ????????? -1    The decay of thorium-234 is an example of -decay, which is a nuclear decay process in which a neutron decays into a proton and an electron.  The electron is ejected from the nucleus with high energy, emerging as a -particle whilst the proton remains in the nucleus, explaining the change from a thorium nucleus to a protactinium nucleus.  The decay process of -decay can be written as:    1 ?????????? 1 ???????? 0  ??n ??  ????p ? + ?? e  0 ?????????? 1 ??????? -1    --------------------------------------    Theoretically, you would expect to find a substantial amount of protactinium-234 in a sample of thorium-234, as every atom of thorium-234 that undergoes decay produces an atom of protactinium-234.  If you begin with a sample containing X atoms of thorium-234 and no protactinium-234:    after one half-life, sample should be X / 2 atoms thorium-234 and x / 2 atoms protactinium-234  after two half-lives, sample should be X / 4 atoms thorium-234 and 3x / 4 atoms protactinium-234  after three half-lives, sample should be X / 8 atoms thorium-234 and 7x / 8 atoms protactinium-234    However, in reality this is not the case, as protactinium-234 is itself radioactive and undergoing decay.  In fact, protactinium-234 has a less stable nucleus than does thorium-234 (as shown by its shorter half-life) and thus the protactinium-234 is decaying faster than it is being produced by the decay of thorium-234.  Consequently, the amount of protactinium-234 present in a sample of thorium-234 will always be comparatively small, but the relatively stable decay product from protactinium-234's decay (namely, uranium-234) will be present in significant amounts and easily detectable.

KJHw0oI3aa	The coefficients in an equation give you  proportions by molecules, moles, or millimoles.  In case of gases, Avogadro's hypothesis states that "Equal volumes of gases at the same temperature and pressure contain the same number of molecules."  What that means is that the volumes of gases are proportional to moles or millimoles of gases.  To make the long story short, you do not need to change units of volume to moles in order to solve the problem, and you do not have to convert to any particular units of volume.  Use whatever units you are given, and just be consistent.  Think of the coefficients in the equation as units of volume.  Here you want to determine which gas is the limiting reactant, and how many milliliters of the one present in excess would be left unreacted.  First copy the equation and list what quantities are given.    2 H2 + O2 --> 2 H2O  4 mL  32 mL    Then assume that hydrogen is the limiting reactant and use dimensional analysis to find the needed volume of oxygen to react completely with 4 mL of hydrogen.    [(4 mL H2)/(1)][(1 mL O2)/(2 mL H2)] = 2 mL O2 is needed to react with 4 mL of H2    Since 32 mL of oxygen is given, only 2 mL will be used up leaving 30 mL of oxygen unreacted.|`|kae4Hw4naa	32 mls of oxygen? and 4mls of Hydrogen?    30 mls of Oxygen.

KHjYq2bHaa	I have just checked your data, the Earth's orbit is actually 1.5 x10^11m    If using p = mv, then all you need is to find the average velocity of the Earth. We are using approximate values here and making a lot of assumptions. Lets say that the Earth's orbit is circular. The circumference of Earth orbit (just for convenience) is 2 * pi * radius = 9.42 x 10^11 m. It takes a year to make 1 orbit or 31 557 600s.    The average speed would then be 29 850 m/s    Then multiplying them together to get momentum:  6 x 10^24 x 29 850 = 1.791 x10^29 kg.m/s|`|g3uOp780aa	I'll try to help. If you know the radius of the earth, you can calculate it's circumference. c=2pi*r. This assumes a circular orbit, but that's ok.     You know the time taken to orbit the sun is 365.25 earth days, convert this to seconds. You now have a distance and a time, from which you can calculate velocity v=s/t.     The mass of the sun is given in the question, I assume you have the power to which it's raised although you haven't given it, you can now use p=mv to yield an answer.

AA11130104	The first answer if correct.  Particulates will increase solar radiation absorption, increasing heat and increasing melt.

YOqbGO2Maa	Relative to where?  There are no absolute locations in space.  There is no natural zero point to start measuring positions from.    The International Celestial Reference System is centered at the barycenter of the solar system.  So using the ICRS, the solar system does not orbit around the galaxy.  (In the ICRS, the galaxy orbits around the solar system, but studies of galaxy dynamics don't use the ICRS.)    Even after we adopt the ICRS, there is the meaning of "same point in space".  Does the Earth have to come back within 1 mm? 1 meter? 1 nanometer?.    I have explored this question using high-precision ephemeris software, and the answer is that the Earth center sometimes comes back within a few kilometers of ICRS coordinates that it was at a year before.  But it ranges between 5 km and 400,000 km of the year-ago orbit.

On an extremely large scale, the Universe is like a web of galactical clusters and superclusters, all of which are moving away from each other (i.e. expanding).    But like I said, when you're asking about the Earth's position in space, you have to specify relative to what.

Most of the threads will have play.To avoid the error due to thread play the reference marking also should be made in the same direction.Now draw the cross slide from inner to outer and make a marking smaller than what is required for you .Make a mark and measure the pcd. Calculate how much you have to move the slide further.You can make use of the marking on graduation handle to the distance what is to be moved carefully.If by mistake moved more than what is required you have to go back to the center and repeat the process Don't go back slightly to get your place of marking.

WxWLC9yDaa	It could be a bad wire somewhere. With the crazy weather it could be a rodent or something got in there and disturbed the wiring. It could be the light fixture or if the light is attached to the fan it could be the actual light kit going bad. The boys only do not like the flickering.     They are not crying or anything when they go into the room or show any reservations about it either so most likely there is nothing haunting there.      I would replace the light fixture and see if that takes care of the problem. If not then contact the electrician again. Or climb up in the attic and look for yourself.     There is the chance that your boys are so full of energy that they cause this to happen. When it happens it causes more energy with there nerves and being scared, when mom enters they relax causing the energy to go down and therefor explaining why you do not see it.  But more then likely it is the light itself causing it.|`|v7dbd6Lbaa	When I was a little girl I used to see "sparkly" things in my room. I told my mom but she never believed me, now she does.

They can take reading such as EMF's and do some EVP work. They will be able to help you determine if you do indeed have a spirit, and also how to get rid of one if need be or teach you how to coexist with the spirit, depending on your preference. What state are you located in? I run one of these groups that does investigations free of charge.    Not all spirits are negative. In fact some a very pleasant and enjoyable to be around. Some give you a very peaceful feeling or are just being playful.     Your situation could be faulty wiring or something paranormal...the best way to find out would be to have an investigation done. I've been on investigations with high EMFs causing crazy things, faulty wiring, and then a few real hauntings...every case is different.|`|8xzYJt1aaa	its probably an electric problem. if its not then its... not normal i can tell you that. probably trying to connect with your children or just trying to bother them. if i were actually in the room i could probably tell you if there is a Presence or something, but i would recommend trying to get your children out of that room. it could be a spirit. and you never know if its a good spirit that's just bored and wants to mess around, or of its a bad spirit that's giving some type of warning. if u want to deal with it u could sleep with ur kids one night. but if u dont want to get tangled up in what might be a bad situation u should really just get your children out of that room.   if i were you i would   1. call an electrician.   2.change the light bulb.   3. its not a technical problem, get your kids out of there.   oh and DO NOT try to Communicate with it if u think it is a Ghost or whatever. u could get in a mess.   being me i would just move out.|`|xfZGqztAaa	Its certainly odd. Paranormal activity related to this sort of thing is often labelled as Poltergeist activity, but your two lads seem too young to attract one of these spirits.  Does anything else occur in the room?  Objects moving, cold spots, strange smells or noises for instance.    Take out the bulb that's in the light, and replace it with another one, then try the bulb in another light to see if it does the same thing.    Hope the problem sorts itself out for you, I know kids can get real scared about these things.|`|an1b4pXxaa	Is it only doing it occasionally like every 5 or more minutes? We have a couple of lights in our house that do that, I think it is a combination of those new fangled globes and imperfect wiring, I've seen it quite often mentioned on other forums too.    I think you should lay with your sons in the dark when it is their bedtime and see if you can work out what it is. Whatever it is probably isn't noticeable when the door is open and a little light from the other rooms is coming in. I can't see any reason to think that is paranormal without exploring every other possibility first.|`|8d5f0adc83a9aec3f83894da97ca8d80aa	Is the lightbulb screwed in tight? I've had light flicker that way.... also, lights tend to flicker just before they're going out. Try replacing the bulb maybe to see if that helps?    EDIT:     okay... after reading one of the replies I have to add... spirits can't hurt you. Period. IF there IS one in their room, toying with them, that's no reason to abandon the house and run. I really think it's a bad idea to spread fear around like that, make people afraid for no reason.     the way *I* see it... you said it yourself, you feel comfortable in the dark in this house when you haven't in others. Trust that feeling. What you could do is go into their room, when they're sleeping and see if it makes you uncomfortable. But I don't feel anything in your house. Your house feels empty to me. When I think of the boys room, I feel creepy shadows in the corners and a flickering light bulb would sure scare them if they're seeing monsters in the corners. IOW, I think almost every child is afraid of the dark at some point, but that's all I see there, just shadows. I dn't feel any *thing* lurking in them.     What you could do... tell the boys when they're scared to call on archangel Michael. Nothing bad gets past Michael and he's very gentle. you could ask Michael to watch over the house, to clear of it anything that shouldn't be there and escort it to where it belongs. The point of my suggesting this being to give the boys something that makes them feel safe and Michael is very powerful. It actually worked for my son. My son has medium tendencies as well, and any spirit that comes to me, tends to go to him as well, and it was spooking him. So I taught him to call on michael when he was afraid, and he stopped having a problem.|`|AA12123428	Get an electrician in to look for dodgy connections, bad wiring, etc.  Incidentally, did they rewire your lights or just your sockets or consumer board?|`|YIy9yu4qaa	Its electrical or they are fibbing. The reason I think they might be fibbing is you have obviously taught them that blinking lights are caused by ghosts. So no, instead of a monster in the closet, you have a monster in the lightbulb.  If it is electrical then hang around long enough and you will see it. Just because the house was rewired, doesn't mean there wasn't any mistakes made, or lose connections.   If you don't want them to be scared, stop filling their heads with non-sense, like that a blinking light is caused by monsters. When has a real ghost ever caused a light to blink? Outside of popular FICTION tv shows like A Haunting, and Ghost Hunters they don't do that.    edit: As it happens, I am a parent. They would not be afraid of a flickering light if the idea didn't come from somewhere. I am reading between the lines. You believe in ghosts, and believe the light bulb could possibly be a ghost, or you would have posted this question in electrical, or engineering or somewhere more appropriate. Its only logical that they are picking up on your beliefs, whether you directly tell them or not.|`|AA10631668	All children lie,yours included.They don't want to go to bed and have made up a story.  The question here is why you choose to believe them.It would be easy enough to find out what's going on.Leave a recording device in the room(there's probably one in your phone).Stand by their door and look under it.Go outside and look in their window.There's no reason for you not to have seen the lights flicker(or not).I can't imagine anyone not investigating before looking for a paranormal answer.|`|24H5tznkaa	It could be an energetic thing, one of your kids energy might be causing the flicker. It could just be a temporary thing.    That is just a guess. I like that you said you can walk around your house in the dark. Some places really are that nice. :)     On the other hand, it could be just a coincidence that the light is flickering only when you aren't around. Seven years sounds like a perfect time for wiring to start acting up.     If you're going to have someone come out and look at it, make sure your son (the one who is scared) is there when it happens...so he can watch the guy investigate it. It should soothe his fears.    *edit*    I would also like to *ditto* what "I'm Just Me" said. Archangel Michael helped my 10 year old brother out too. As long as you have no problem with your kids believing in Angels, it is great to educate them about them.|`|jkXYlKJzaa	electric|`|gPrSklCQaa	check the wires again...if that didnt helps..sleep there with them and analyze the room but u have to b strong..if still nothin install cameraz|`|f5mwd3yHaa	ITS A GHOST! who u gonna call?

However, this spirit may feel something about you that it does not feel comfortable with (not saying your a bad person, just that maybe it senses your authority and fears you) I wouldn't get an exorcist, but try to make peace with the spirit.    Your kids could be triggering the spirit off as well, if it is indeed a spirit, maybe angering it somehow. Maybe, if it is a woman spirit, it was not able to bare a child and therefore jealous.    The obvious answer is the wiring but as you said the house was rewired then, it's not that.
pRF5LLloaa	The speed of light is 186,282 Miles PER SECOND. That multiples out to be  6,754,615,200 Miles Per Hour (MPH)    The speed of wind is no more than about 300 MPH -- and that is during a hurricane.  Normal, everyday wind speeds are no more than about 30 MPH, usually much less like 10 MPH.    It takes about 200 milliseconds (200 one-thousands, or 2 tenths, of a second) for you touch touch a hot stove, realize that it is hot, and jerk your hand away.  In a normal person, that means that "thought" travels about 6 feet in 0.2 seconds.    Multiplying that out, nerve impulses (thought) travels at about 20.5 MPH.    SO:  LIGHT = 6,754,615,200 MPH  WIND =  About 10 MPH  THOUGHT = 20.5 MPH    So, now,  which one wins?    Hint: NOTHING can beat the speed of light.|`|esdjKGeBaa	Light is faster than wind.

To this end, calculate f ' and g' :    f ' (x) = 3x^2  g ' (x) = 4 cos(4x)    Now we look at     Limit as x approaches 0 of 3x^2 / (4cos(4x)), which can be evaluated directly with no fear of getting a 0 / 0.

These lipids combine with special proteins called apoproteins - apolipoproteins - to form lipoproteins and this process solubilises lipids in plasma. Therefore, the lipoproteins provide a transport system for lipids. Apoproteins are important not only in maintaining the structural integrity of lipoproteins and thereby facilitating the solubilisation of lipids, but they also play an important role in lipoprotein receptor recognition and regulation of certain enzymes in lipoprotein metabolism.|`|dd04b768d2f9c6ce58baff2757965093aa	apolipoproteins function in the regulation of lipoprotein metabolism through their involvement in the transport and redistribution of lipids among various cells and tissues, through their role as cofactors for enzymes of lipid metabolism, or through their maintenance of the structure of the lipoprotein particles. The primary structures of most of the apolipoproteins are now known, and various functional domains of these proteins are being mapped using selective chemical modification, synthetic peptides, and monoclonal antibodies. Furthermore, the establishment of structure-function relationships has been greatly advanced by the identification of genetically determined variants of specific apolipoproteins that are associated with a disorder of lipoprotein metabolism. Future studies will rely heavily on the use of recombinant DNA technology and site-specific mutagenesis to elucidate further the correlations between structure and function and the role of specific apolipoproteins in lipoprotein metabolism.

CYtMRC4eaa	Triglycerides are formed by the dehydration synthesis reaction of 3 fatty acids with a molecule of glycerol.|`|M3maZgdyaa	Hope this helps.    What are triglycerides?    Triglycerides are the chemical form in which most fat exists in food as well as in the body. They're also present in blood plasma and, in association with cholesterol, form the plasma lipids.     Triglycerides in plasma are derived from fats eaten in foods or made in the body from other energy sources like carbohydrates. Calories ingested in a meal and not used immediately by tissues are converted to triglycerides and transported to fat cells to be stored. Hormones regulate the release of triglycerides from fat tissue so they meet the body's needs for energy between meals.    How is an excess of triglycerides harmful?    Excess triglycerides in plasma is called hypertriglyceridemia. It's linked to the occurrence of coronary artery disease in some people. Elevated triglycerides may be a consequence of other disease, such as untreated diabetes mellitus. Like cholesterol, increases in triglyceride levels can be detected by plasma measurements. These measurements should be made after an overnight food and alcohol fast.    http://www.americanheart.org/presenter.j...

Then the westbound one is travelling at (y+3) mph. Putting this together,     y + (y+3) = 27  2y = 27 - 3  y = 12    So the eastbound cyclist travels at 12mph, the westbound one at 15mph. Double check:    Eastbound 4h x 12m/h = 48 miles  Westbound 4h x 15m/h = 60 miles  48 + 60 = 108    --------------------    Quicker method, putting it all in one line    total distance = 4 x (Eastbound speed + Westbound speed)  108 = 4 x (y + (y+3))    and solving    108 = 8y + 12  96 = 8y  y = 12|`|2HH1PSnVaa	Question.

Science doesn't prove anything, so you shouldn't open yourself up by using that word.    Light has two wave-like properties:    1) Interference (two light sources will interfere with each other creating light and dark spots)  2) Diffraction (it bends around a corner or fans out from a hole)    Young's experiment demonstrates both of these phenomena, which light has in common with waves but not with particles.  --------------  On the other hand, the other side will argue that light has one property in common with particles and not waves.  It comes in chunks of discrete size, as first noticed by Einstein when he explained the photo-electric effect.  ---------------  At the end of the day, doing a debate like this is supposed to get you to think and realize that light is neither a particle nor a wave in the classical sense.  As it turns out, the same goes for electrons and even bigger "particles".  You need a completely new kind of mechanics (quantum mechanics) to describe them properly.  ----------------  By the way, refraction is a poor argument.

SjwwN74waa	Similarities:  Right whales and sperm whales both spend the majority of their time in cold, polar water.  Both have been extensively hunted by man.  Both belong to the same order, Cetacea, which includes dolphins, porpoises, and whales.    Differences:  Sperm whales have real teeth and eat large prey relative to their body size while right whales have keratin plates that they use to filter very small prey such as zoo plankton.    Sperm whales do not go into equatorial waters ever, while right whales go into warmer waters to breed.    Right whales simply skim the water and filter out their prey while sperm whales actively hunt their prey and can use intense sound blasts to stun their prey and then eat it.  Right whales come close to shore during breeding season and were easily hunted, whereas sperm whales required boats to go out into deeper waters and was quite difficult until motorized harpoons came about.  Sperm whales have a wax present in their head cavities called Spermaceti|`|VFx4YHFEaa	The Sperm Whale (Physeter macrocephalus or Physeter catodon) is the largest of all toothed whales and largest living toothed animal. The whale was named after the milky-white waxy substance, spermaceti, found in its head and originally mistaken for sperm or semen. Historically the Sperm Whale has also been known as the common cachalot; "cachalot" is derived from an archaic French word for "tooth". A sperm Whale is the title "character" in Herman Melville's novel Moby-Dick.    Right whales are the species of large baleen whales belonging to the genus Eubalaena. Three right whale species are recognized in this genus. They are closely related genetically to the larger, arctic Bowhead Whale, which is currently placed in its own genus, Balaena. Over the last two centuries the taxonomy of these species has been in flux, with the right whales often being considered to be in the same genus, Balaena as the Bowhead. Because of the genetic similarity, all four of these species are included in the taxonomic family family Balaenidae, and sometimes all members of this family are referred to as right whales. The Pygmy Right Whale (Capera marginata), a much smaller whale of the Southern Hemisphere, was also included in the Balaenidae family, but has recently been found to be so different as to justify its own family Neobalaenidae.    Right whales can grow up to 18 m (59 ft) long and weigh up to 100 tons. Their rotund bodies are mostly black, with distinctive callosities (roughened patches of skin) on their heads. They are called "right whales" because whalers thought the whales were the "right" ones to hunt, as they float when killed and often swim within sight of the shore. Populations were vastly reduced by intensive harvesting during the active years of the whaling industry. Today, instead of hunting them, people often watch these acrobatic whales for pleasure.    The four Balaenidae species live in distinct locations. Approximate population figures:

The history of the Alps started some 500 million years ago. In the then existing Tethyan Sea, the materials the Alps are made of, such as marble, limestone and granite, developed during many millions of years. The actual mountain-building started a 100 million years ago when the African tectonic plate started to move towards and causing pressure on the more stable tectonic plates of Europe and Asia. Under the influence of this gigantic pressure the bottom of the sea rose to form new mountains. On a smaller scale glacial periods and glaciers caused the shaping of the mountains by their eroding influence.     The growth process is still going on.

In this type of plate boundary, no vulcanism is seen. Other young fold mountains due to similar collisions are the Austro-Indian plate subducting under the Eurasian Plate and Arabian miniplate subducting under the Eurasian Plate.|`|E0U2yII3aa	"The Alps form a part of a Tertiary orogenic belt of mountain chains, called the Alpide belt, that stretches through southern Europe and Asia from the Atlantic all the way to the Himalayas. This belt of mountain chains was formed during the Alpine orogeny. A gap in these mountain chains in central Europe separates the Alps from the Carpathians off to the east. Orogeny took place continuously and tectonic subsidence is to blame for the gaps in between."    From what I read in the Wikipedia, Alps was formed between the collision of the African landmass and the equally massive Eurasian landmass. These two are both massive and one will not go below the other. The stress will continue to build-up and the mountains may continue to rise unless erosion brings them to a lower height. In the case of volcanic activity, you'll see them with seafloor expanding and when a relatively light plate, like those of the ocean floor, collides with a typically massive craton in subduction zones.

After one year, Betsy will make    .15b dollars from B-rated bonds  .07c dollars from CDs    We need these amounts to sum to 6000:    .15b + .07c = 6000.    Thus you are solving the system    b + c = 50,000  .15b + .07c = 6000    Solve the first of these two equations for b:    b = 50000 - c.    Now substitute 50000 - c for b in the second equation:    .15(50000 - c) + .07c = 6000    Simplify:    7500 - .15c + .07c = 6000, or    -.08c = -1500, or    c = 18750.  Since c was the amount invested in CDs, Betsy must've invested $18750 in them.    Now use the fact that b + c = 50000 and c = 18750 to find b:    b + 18750 = 50000, or  b = 31250.    So she invested 31250 in bonds.    Let's check:    31250 * .15 = 4687.5  18750 * .07 = 1312.5  4687.5 + 1312.5 = 6000.

18OzhFisaa	Carbon dioxide is increasing the greenhouse effect which is increasing global temperatures. This is causing the melt of alpine & continental glaciers and the ice caps. This is leading to increased sea levels. If too much freshwater from ice melt is released into the Atlantic, it has the potential to switch off the thermohaline current (gulf stream) which will have drastic consequences - cooling of Europe which has the potential to lead to an ice age.  the greenhouse effect is also leading to the melt of the permafrost in Siberia which is releasing methane (dead plants and animals are contained in the ice-methane released). Methane is 23 times as bad as CO2 for contributing to the greenhouse effect.  -positive feedback - more warming!|`|AA11130104	If you talk to a biologist, which I am not, but have done, they will tell you that the optimal level for plant growth is an atmospheric CO2 level between 700 - 1000 ppm.

JQqvohOXaa	Beers law states that the molar absorbtivity times the cell path length times the concentration of the solution equals the absorbance.  The equation is:  A = ebc.  where e = molar absorbtivity, b =  cell path length in cm, and c = concentration in moles/liter.  A is measured from the spectrum, usually an ultraviolet/visible spectrum, and has no units.  b is usually given by the cell manufacturer, and concentration is determined by an analytical technique.      A Beers Law plot requires you to plot A versus c for several concentrations.  The line will be linear.  The slope of the line will give the molar absorptivity (actually eb) since the cell path length is know, and is usually 1.00 cm.  Remember, slope is rise/run    I hope this answers your question.
X0e6p9Ilaa	Which variable constitutes the independent and which the dependent variable depends upon how  you do the experiment.  The variable that you determine the values of is the independent variable.    In the case of a Beer's Law lab, you will prepare the various solutions at specific concentrations.      Beer's Law:  A = ebc .... where A=absorbance, e=molar absorptivity, b=path length and c=concentration in moles per liter.  For a typical experiment e and b are constants.    Since you are in control of the concentration values, then concentration will be the independent variable and be plotted on the x-axis.  The variable on the x-axis is uniformly assumed to be independent variable.  Obviously the absorbance (A) will be the dependent varibable and be plotted on the y-axis.    ======== Follow up ========    Careful.  CB needs to use the correct terminology.  The terms are "transmittance" and "absorbance".  ("Adsorbance" is something else entirely.) Plotting the transmittance (or percent transmittance) vs concentration will not produce a straight line.   Only a plot of absorbance vs concentration is linear.  And even at that there are sometimes deviations from Beer's Law that produce little curves at the end of the linear portion of the graph.|`|JEmuZTiuaa	Independent variable is the concentration. (It is the thing you decide upon)  The dependent variable is the transmittance (or absorbance). (It is the thing that 'depends' on what concentration you decide to use.)    Edit....

However a considerable amount of smaller-sized paper drawings and descriptions are available from various NASA-operated sites, in PDF form.  Inside KSC is a great site.

Part of this process requires oxygen to fully break down the glucose-so when you need more energy metabolised, you'll need more oxygen too. If you don't get enough oxygen, your muscles will not be able to fully break down available glucose, they'll become fatigued and produce lactic acid instead- giving you a sore feeling.       Just how much oxygen your muscles will use depends on two processes: getting blood to the muscles and extracting oxygen from the blood into the muscle tissue. Your working muscles can take oxygen out of the blood three times as well as your resting muscles. Your body has several ways to increase the flow of oxygen-rich blood to working muscle:        * increased local blood flow to the working muscle      * diversion of blood flow from nonessential organs to the working muscle      * increased flow of blood from the heart (cardiac output)      * increased rate and depth of breathing      * increased unloading of oxygen from hemoglobin in working muscle     These mechanisms can increase the blood flow to your working muscle by almost five times. That means that the amount of oxygen available to the working muscle can be increased by almost 15 times!|`|LFv29tvLaa	The blood.  There are two types of circulatory systems in the body; Systemic circulation, pulmonary circulation.  In the pulmonary circulation, the blood travels from the heart to the lungs where oxygen diffuses into the blood combining with haemoglobin forming oxyhaemoglobin and the carbon dioxide diffuses out. From there, the oxygenated blood returns to the heart and is then pumped out of the heart into the systemic circulation. The blood travels from the heart to the rest of the body where the oxygen diffuses out of the capillaries, which are surrounded by body tissue, in this case, the muscles.
xopIi2Vfaa	muscles get their strength from the overlap of actin and myosin filaments. Strength increases most the more filaments you have in parallel, but it also will increase the greater the overlap between filaments is. Which means the strength of your muscle will also depend how much it is stretched or if you can contract (shorten) it.   Also check out working range of a muscle.
h5CB9M2caa	The effects of training would increase the efficiency of the lungs. During future exercise you would not have to breath as fast because the volume of air that you inspired would have increased.    In other words your minute volume increases and your breath rate decreases. This is because the number of blood capillaries surrounding the alveoli increases. This results in a better blood supply so more oxygen will diffuse into the bloodstream    A quick outline of a training program is 30 minutes of aerobic exercise (such as jogging) 3-5 times a week (depending on your current fitness level)    EDIT: In response to snicker's comment below - it is beneficial to increase the amount of oxygen in the human body during exercise. An untrained individual with a poor blood supply to the lungs will not be able to aerobically respire for as long as a trained individual. The increased supply of oxygen will help prevent excess build up of lactic acid produced by anaerobic respiration and will also help to remove any oxygen debt after exercise|`|jJAENrvUaa	um.. have more like.. you know air sacs?  alveoli?  or whatever they're called.  and more capillaries...  all i know is to up the surface area.|`|vHbiUhOCaa	As the first person mentioned, more alveoli would do that, but you can't produce more of them yourself.

X0e6p9Ilaa	Electrons are negatively charged and like charges repel.  Electrons of opposite spin can occupy an orbital and function as a single pair of electrons.  Each pair of electrons can then repel other pairs of electrons.  This is true whether the pairs of electrons are involved in bonding or are lone pairs.  The whole concept by VSEPR theory is the repuslsion of pairs of electrons.  The geometry of the molecule (or polyatomic ion) depends on the electrons pairs getting as far apart as possible.    For two electron pairs that is 180 degrees, producing a linear arrangement.  For three electron pairs, that is 120 degrees, producing a trigonal planar electron pair geometry.  For four electron pairs, that is a tetrahedral electron pair geometry where the angle is 109.5 degrees.    Bonding pairs are located between two nuclei and are attracted to each of the nuclei and are therefore centered between the nuclei.  But a lone pair is attracted to only one nucleus and the orbital which is occupied by the one pair tends to "spread out" or become "delocalized", and "wraps" around the molecule.  This forces the bonding pairs closer together because of the repulsion which results in smaller bond angles.    In NH3, with one lone pair, and 3 bonding pairs, the bond angle goes from the usual tetrahedral angle of 109.5 to 107 degrees.  In the case of water, which has two bonding pairs and two lone pairs, the bond angle is reduced to 105 degrees.|`|90d92a076012fbb35f3a5fa11ad4e4b6aa	In the VSEPR model, lone pairs of electrons around a central atom have the strongest repelling force when compared to single, double, and triple bonds and thus reduce the expected bond angle of the electron pair geometry the most. Here is why:   When you have a shared pair(s), two nuclei of two atoms are attracting this pair of electrons. A lone pair is attracted by only one nucleus. Therefore, shared pair (which are 'pulled' by 2 nuclei.) are further away from the central atom nuclei than lone pairs. Because lone pairs are held closer to the nuclei, their repulsion area (area where their charge is felt by other particles) is closer to the bonding pairs. This causes the bonding pairs to move further away from this repulsion area of the lone pair electrons and thus the bonding angle is reduced.

It is looking for the set of three that does so.    3. Wants you to plot out these points and see if you can make a recognizable graph (either a curve or a straightline) Your math book should have picuters in it of what a funtion looks like.    4. The verticle line test is simply testing with a verticle line to see (straight up and down) wether that line crosses once or more than once. Once its a function. More than once not a function.    5. Slope is amount up over amount over (y/x) add the two together (y+6)/(x+x). Tada!  6. same as five  7. same as fie    8. Y intercept is just when x=0 so make x zero solve function y intercept! Slope is the same. Enjoy    9. I'm not sure about 9. I'm sure the rule is in the book somewhere as this question is a little random.

The "reactants" are the substances that existed before the reaction began.  The problem mentions "heating solid potassium chlorate in the presence of manganese dioxide catalyst".  It may appear that both "potassium chlorate" and "manganese dioxide" are reactants, because they were both present before the reaction began.  However, you must recall that a "catalyst" does not get used up in the reaction.  It is a chemical tool used to make the reaction go faster, in the same way that a hammer is used to insert a nail into the wall.  The nail becomes part of the wall, but the hammer can be reused for other jobs.  Therefore, only "potassium chlorate" is the one and only reactant.  "Products" are substances that were created or produced as a result of the chemical change.  The problem states that the reaction "produces potassium chloride and oxygen gas".  The products of this reaction are, therefore, "potassim chloride" and "oxygen gas".  We can also include the states or phases of each substance.  Potassium chlorate is given as "solid", oxygen is given as "gas".  There is no direct information about potassium chloride.  However, since potassium chlorate, the original reactant was solid, and since no water is present anywhere, we can assume that potassium chloride would also be a solid.  You may argue that perhaps it could be a liquid due to the heating that goes on during the reaction.  However, bear in mind, that potassium chloride is an ionic compound similar to our table salt.  Ionic compounds require very high temperatures to melt.  We can safely assume that in this case potassium chloride would be a solid.    Having identified the reactants and the products, we can put them in a form of a word equation as follows:    solid potassium chlorate --> solid potassium chloride + oxygen gas    Note that the reactants are placed on the left side of the equation, while the products are placed on the right.    Next, replace each name with a correct formula for the substance, and then balance the equation correctly.  (Remember that oxygen element is diatomic.)    2 KClO3(s) --> 2KCl(s) + 3 O2(g)
SAgCy83Oaa	You start off this "question" alleging that it ISN'T homework; then you present a passel of what are obviously homework questions; and THEN at the bottom you admit it is homework, and CLAIM that you tried.  But it's obvious that you are trying to get us to do your work for you.  If you truly TRIED and still are looking for this sort of outside help, then you obviously haven't gone to your teacher and explained that you haven't learned the material.    You need to remember that the slope of a line is the "rise over run" which is the difference in "Y" values divided by the difference in the "X" values of the order pairs.  So, in your first problem, the slope is 5 - (-7) divided by 2 -5  or  12/-3  which equals -4.    If you had wanted us to believe that you had "tried" you wouldn't have posted ALL the questions, and would have shown what steps you performed to try to work the problem.  So, don't tell US not to complain that you should do your own homework.

1d7ba071150759756c6284bca18876c3aa	BS alert*    The earth has been slowing down very slowly since the moon was formed. Tides plastically deform the mantel and move oceans of water, creating drag and converting earth rotational energy into heat and lunar orbital energy. As a result, the earth slows and the moon's orbital radius increases. In several billion years, the earth may become tide-locked, always facing the moon. The lunar month/earth day will be about 40 days or so by then. Because the moon is smaller, this has already happened to it (one side faces earth). I say "may", because the earth may not exist long enough for that to happen. The sun may swell, engulf, and vaporize it first. It's about the same time-scale.    Incidentally, resistance to plastic deformation is considered a form of internal friction (sorry, Bekki). It's due to crystals and such sliding past each other.     Bekki, I never claimed that plastic shear strain transports angular momentum all the way to the moon directly, but that doesn't mean "Friction has nothing to do with it". Indeed, it plays an intrinsic role. Tidal force differentials deform the earth, making it prolate. If the earth were perfectly inviscid and elastic, the principle axis would always point in the direction of the moon (or oscillate about it, in general). Since it is not, the axis lags behind the earth-moon direction. This causes gravity to impart a torque on the moon, and a countertorque on the earth, raising the orbit of the former, and slowing the rotation of the latter. Meanwhile, the plastic work heats the earth by an amount equal to the lost kinetic + gravitational energy of earth-moon system. You cannot conserve both angular momentum and energy as the moon's orbit rises unless you include such heat. Now don't make me get out the heavy artillary; I know how to put Greek letters in this box if I have to. See:  L=I     *A BS alert is issued when the majority of other respondents are giving answers which are wrong or, worse yet, not even wrong.|`|92f97d29e3d55f3219cc25dfabd347c7aa	Angular momentum is conserved.  So for the earth to slow down, something has to carry away angular momentum (as the moon does, very slowly via the tidal interactions) or bring it (like getting hit with something).  Friction has nothing to do with it.    R--internal friction can't carry away angular momentum.    OK fair enough.|`|gapWTVmDaa	yes, but not in your lifetime :)|`|kfuA1RBoaa	No|`|KfBWOvf3aa	with current situation now, that scenario is very much unlikely to happen. however, it can happen if there is giant asteroid or comet hits our Earth so hard, therefore changing direction its of rotation|`|1ibHGaAhaa	Everything is possible although that is very unlikely to happen.|`|1MEPLdJJaa	the planet such as the Earth has been slowing down every day. it will stop rotation gradually. the reason is because the air makes a friction with the Earth.There's no doubt about the slowing down! Can you explain a little more about the 'air mak[ing] friction with the Earth' please? AFAIK, the slowing down has to do with exchange of angular momemtum between the Moon (in its orbit) and the Earth (rotating about its axis). If there were no Moon, perhaps the Sun would play a role in slowing down the Earth? Then there's the angular momentum of the liquid core; although it's much closer to the centre of the Earth than the atmosphere, it's also far, far more massive

Are you talking about boys and girls, Men and Women? Or do you mean plants, bacteria, viruses, worms, shells, fishes, insects, birds,  mammals, etc. Any of those? Life has many forms.    Now, the possibility for life is good given the endless choices for location. Within our Solar System (Our Sun and its planets) there   is only one candidate (the Earth) which seems to have all the necessary ingredients (correct distance from its star, heavy nickle  and iron core to produce enough gravity to retain gases, abundant water, hard surface crust, and good mix of atmospheric gases with  a protective outer layer of ozone.    Our Sun is a star. Our Solar System is located within the Milky Way Galaxy. Besides our star (the sun) there are 200 Billion other stars in the Milky Way Galaxy. Each one of those stars could have its own solar system of orbiting planets with various moons just like ours.    Outside of the Milky Way Galaxy there are thousands and thousands of other galaxies and each one of them also contains simply billions of stars. And, of course, each one of those stars could have a solar system consisting of orbiting planets and moons just like ours.    So there are endless possible sites for life to develop somewhere out there. The closest star to us (not our Sun) is a distance of 4 1/2 Light Years away, and the fartherest stars we know about are at least 13 Billion Light Years away. That means that the distance between here and some star which might have a workable climate and atmosphere for human life is a long, long, long way away. Travel to some such spot is out of the question at this time, but science is still moving forward and who knows what will be developed in the future...    Do not look for life such as humans on another planet with EMail, IPods, Sony Walkmen, and Chanel 9 Television. That is very unlikely. You might find that the life on another suitable planet consists of intelligent fish or smart bugs...

Or even new a cheap one is less than 10 bucks at walmart. That takes care of axles and gives you a platform to build the rest on.  Pulleys and gears makes me think of a crane. If there is a fishing pole in the garage theres gears on the reel. A fishing pole on your skateboard looks kind of like a crane on a rolling platform.   If you connect the end of the fishing line to the pole itself, and hang a pulley from the loop of fishing line and lift the box from the pulley, you will have met the pulley requirement.  As for a lever, maybe you can introduce one to help move the sakteboard across the floor...?

You have got to learn how to do them yourself or you will never pass the class.      First:  You have to know the meaning of "FOIL", and do that for each problem.  F=first, O=outside, I=inside, L=last    Multiply the first term in each factor together (2 terms).  Add to that, the following:  Multiply the 2 outiside terms of each factor together.   Add to that, the following:  Multiply the 2 inside terms of each factor together.   Add to that, the following:  Multiply the 2 last terms of each factor together.      Once you add all like terms, simplify if possible.  If not, post your answer by highest exponent first, then in desending order.

aHN5fDwQaa	The answer that you are looking for is:    sine = opposite/hypotenuse    If you draw a picture of the situation you will see that the height of the kite can be represented by the side of the triangle opposite the angle. The hypotenuse is the length of string.  So sin(38) = Height/Length of string  or  sin(38)*Length of string = Height    0.61566*70 = 43.096 meters      Unfortunately, that is not the correct answer and, in fact, may be a poor approximation. The kite string does not form a straight line between the ground and the kite. Thus, the hypotenuse of the triangle is less than 70 meters.     Depending on how much bow there is in the string, the hypotenuse could be much less than 70 meters. To say it another way, the string may make a 38 degree angle with the ground, but if you sight the kite, you may find it at, say, a 45 degree angle above the ground. Unless you know another piece of information, the problem can't be solved.|`|AxlFcjZoaa	if you imagine  a right angled Triangle  with hypo as string  and vertical side as height above ground of kite .the prob is simple.  vertical side=70*sin38 meter.put value of sin38 and get  the answer.|`|1e8f9a70b81ba191472efb5cd4e71038aa	sin 38 = h / 70  h = 70 sin 38  h = 43.1 m is the vertical height

QvF8dR7Taa	first you should study anatomy,so you know how an arm made by nature works,if you dont know find some one who does,then you need a way to motivate the arm,such as small electrical motors and a cable system,but if you wanna make a realy good one heres how,dirst there are some flexable plastics that will shrink when a voltage is applyed to it,it will contract along the length of the structure molecular length,if you build a duplicat frame work lust like the natural bone structure,then you have a sort of chassies to build on,next you find a way to make sealed working joints thar move in the same manner as a regular arm and hand does,after the joints are made to reproduce the movements the apply the nessary cable system,remember it dosent have to be metalick cables,maby a nylon that dosent stretch or simular flexable synthetic material.then apply the plastic to the attachment places that normaly muscles are attached to,and remember the more plastic strands you bundel to gether will increase the amount of power it will have during contraction,after you have all those things done place weres or some other electrical conducting material to all the electro sensitive contracting plastic.you have to send the current through the length of each muscle fiber to activate it,after you have all things in place then either hook the electrical feeds to a computer or a switching mechanisem,simular to those virtural vidio machine game controlers,or make a band the goes around a real arm that has electrode detectors to sense the nerve impulses of the real arm,if you have every thing wired up corectly,when you move your are it will send electrical impulses to activate the arm to duplicate your arms movement...there are such contracting plastics that are some what limp and bend and like a jelly but when electrical charge is induced they shrink and stiffen quite a bit.that will provide the mechanical power for the movements you want,i would build one myself but it cost too much and i dont have enough money available,the same thing can be done with a leg or foot or the whole limb,but you might have to include a tiquid type cooling system to cool the pizoelectrical muscles

vkz6DscGaa	Most comets are made of frozen ice and dust particles.  Comets spend the majority of their time far from the Sun.  Because of their long, highly elliptical orbits (cigar shaped, almost) the long period comets will eventually approach the Sun, increasing in velocity rapidly as they do.  The ice and dust begin to melt forming a "cloud" around the nucleus of the comet.  This cloud is pushed away from the direction of the Sun by two forces, the solar wind - particles of charged gas streaming out from the Sun, and light pressure - the force generated from packets of energy known as quanta or photons that is a property of light energy.    This actually generates two tails: an ion tail of comet gases caused by the solar wind and a slightly curved dust tail generated by the photons striking the comet's suspended dust particles.    Other comets are "one-shots" so to speak.  These comets don't actually orbit our sun but are deflected by its gravity well to make a close pass through our solar system.  The effect is still the same.|`|097ec7f356872967e38438f8b2bde431aa	its hotter closer to the sun so the ice from the comet melts|`|4DM0yk48aa	The outer portions of the comet (mostly water and frozen gases) start to vaporize as it gets heated by the sun.  This vapor trail then streams out away from the sun due to the solar wind (particles streaming out from the sun) as the comet approaches.    Trivia point: the comet's tail always faces away from the sun, even as the comet is going away from the sun.  Therefore, either the "tail" is a misnomer, or the comet backs away from the sun. ;o)|`|44d472ebef2f7cbc54d3e55e0a6eaae6aa	A comet is effectively a ball of ice travelling at something like 12000 miles a second. As it gets closer to the sun it simply melts and breaks up the closer it gets...    In a nutshell that's what happens, I saw a program about them on the weekend on Discovery, I wouldn't have had a clue myself with it!!    Hope it helps    Ichi|`|hdLA5VS6aa	Comets are mostly ice, right? So out in space it is really cold so it stays frozen. When the comet start coming back to the sun because of the sun's gravitational pull, the ice on the comet starts to melt and it leaves a trail of gas or liquid water.
X0e6p9Ilaa	You are describing the reaction of HCl gas with water, in which HCl molecules are dissociated into hydrogen ions (hydronium ions) and chloride ions.  And by the way, it would be nice to use the correct symbols.  Hydrogen is H, not h.    HCl(g) + H2O(l) -->  H3O+ + Cl-    Since chlorine is more electronegative than hydrogen the bonding pair of electrons in HCl is drawn closer to the Cl.  As the HCl comes in contact with H2O, the H moves to the even more electronegative oxygen atom forming H3O+ and leaving the Cl with the bonding pair of electrons resulting in a Cl- ion.    The bond between the H from the HCl and the O in H2O is provided one of the lone pairs of electrons on the oxygen atom.    =========== Follow up ============    Keep in mind that in water there are four pairs of electrons on oxygen, two of which are bonding pairs, and two are lone pairs.  It is one of these lone pairs that forms the bond to the proton that is the H+ ion.  This used to be called a coordinate covalent bond (or a dative bond) in which the pair of bonding electrons comes from a single atom.|`|IjUqYbIxaa	I believe you need to understand the structure of H2O to answer your question. The oxygen molecule in water has 6 valence electrons and two of those electrons are being bonded to the two hydrogens in its structure (H-O-H). So water has 4 valence electrons remaining and they come in the form of lone pairs, since there are 4 electrons left, water has 2 pairs of lone electrons.     For the water to go from H2O to H3O+, one of those lone electron pairs on water grabs the H atom in the HCl, causing its bond with the chlorine atom to be broken.     Chemistry is all about stability and achieving that "inert gas configuration" which is having a full valence shell of electrons (8). And since chlorine already has 7, by losing its bond to hydrogen, it gains one more electron to achieve the inert gas configuration.    I hope this clarifies your confusion. Please feel free to message me if you have any more questions / are still confused.
IjUqYbIxaa	Well it sounds to me you want to find a way to differentiate the structures of these two compounds. A logical and very helpful method in differentiating these compounds would be using spectroscopy, which is the interaction of radiation with matter. Specifically, HNMR spectroscopy (or proton NMR spectroscopy) would be a very helpful method. Proton NMR can help you determine the exact structure of a molecule, as it tells how many hydrogen atoms are on adjacent carbon atoms. It would be a little complicated and tedious to analyze the result, but I feel it would solve your question here.|`|19sa1ITfaa	thats kinda weird question lol|`|nobhvIUtaa	You're question is too general.  Anyhow, I'll try my best to answer it.  Based on what I learned from my organic chemistry class, why don't you try a an ozonolysis cleavage reaction.    Ozonolysis cleavage reaction usually yields two products: an aldehyde and a ketone.  Ozonolysis cleavageof but-1-ene would yield different products from ozonolysis of but-2-ene.  Still don't get it? Draw out one of the molecules n split them in half where the C-C double bond is. Then allow each fragment of the old double bonds to bond to O atoms.    I hope this helps
36ckvIakaa	I think the problems are not correctly stated; since it talks about "variation", I believe problem one can be described mathematically as:    a) dy = x + 1/x^2, which leads to y = 0.5*x^2 - 1/x + c, and then you get only one degree of freedom for two points to fit...    OR (depending on interpretation)    b) dy = ax + b/x^2, which leads to y = a*0.5*x^2 - b/x + c, and then you get three degrees of freedom but only two points to fit.    However, and in view of problem 3, I think all you're asked to do - not much to do with variations really - is:    y = a*x + b/x^2    for x = 1 you are given that    3 = a + b,    for x = 0.5 you are given that    5 = a*0.5 + b/0.25,    substracting twice the second equation from the first one you get:    -7 = b - 8*b => 7 = 7*b => b = 1;    if you look now at the first equation you get    a = 2,    so, when x = 1.5 you get    y = 2 * 1.5 + 1/2.25 = 3 + 4/9 = 31/9.    I'm not 100% positive this is what you're asked for; I hope it helps though...

IlndnVyBaa	in order to do that you use the formula C=Q/deltaT x M    the things you need are how much you need to increase the temperature. The specific heat capacity of the substance. And the mass.    the equation basically is like this    specific heat capacity= energy required (in joules)/ temp diff x mass (grams)    specific heat capacity of water is 4.18 joules to heat 1 gram 1 degree celsius|`|JQqvohOXaa	The energy will be heat energy.  The equation that relates heat to mass is:  q = mc(final T - initial T)  where q is heat in units of calories or joules, c is the heat capacity with units of J/g.degree, or cal/g.degree, and m is mass in g.  The units can be varied, using kJ or kcal, and g or kg.  The degree is either celsius or kelvin.  The heat capacity is a quantity that is characteristic of each substance.  Thus, each substance will react differently to a given amount of heat input or removal.  Look up the heat capacity in a handbook if it is known, otherwise, it must be determined experimentally.  The mass is measured and the temperature response is also measured.  Once q is known, then the amount of heat added to/removed from a substance can be used to find the change in temperature of a substance.    Hope this helps.

But the admissions ppl like you to be "well rounded" as well as having a B+ or better transcript. I'd suggest you major in anything that really interest you, and do a minor in the arts. Could be history, english, literature, music, etc. Also, get involved in campus extra curricular stuff.

efRDPZayaa	Hey, I was not a valedictorian when I was in high school. In fact high school meant nothing, really. If you have the heart, you can do it. As for money, there are plenty of financial aid you can apply, so I guess you dont need to worry much about it.     To get into medical school, you really need to have a high GPA like > 3.8, high MCAT score, plus bunch of voluntary services, extra curriculum activities. If I were to give you a good advice, I would suggest you to go for a general biology major in a not-so-top-notched school. I went to one of those good colleges, and I suffered painfully trying to raise my GPA, so I guess this was the best advice anyone can give you.     Hopefully that helps.

If it was simple to explain how they work than Iran and all the other rogue states would have the atomic bomb already.    It was prolly following roswell that the US military got the information from the visitors to make a atomic bomb. This is not earth technology - its from the stars.|`|vSkqJ813aa	During the years of the Cold war between the Western (USA and its allies) and the Soviet (now Russia and her then satellite countries) super powers; nuclear weapons created a balance of terror that prevented a catastrophic global war. Nuclear weapon designs evolved rapidly during this 'stand-off and, of course, their specifications remained closely guarded secrets.    The first modern nuclear weapon was exploded on July 16, 1945, at a location 35 miles (56 km) southeast of Socorro, New Mexico, on what is now the White Sands Missile Range, which is headquartered near Alamogordo. This test, known as 'Trinity' was of an implosion-design plutonium bomb. The Fat Man bomb, using the same conceptual design, was dropped on Nagasaki, Japan, on August 9th 1945. The Trinity detonation was equivalent to the explosion of around 20 kilotons of TNT (Wikipedia).    The design of this weapon is now largely, declassified and so I shall briefly discuss how it worked.     The core or 'pit' of the Fat Man weapon consisted of two  hemispheres of a plutonium alloy (96 % Pu239, 1 % Pu240 and 3% Gallium) with a mass of about 6.2 kg. Inside of the core was a, still, secret initiator consisting of the metals beryllium and polonium. The initiator provided a 'blizzard' of neutrons to trigger the fission chain reaction within the 'pit' as the detonation proceeded. Surrounding the 'pit' was a boron 'plastic' neutron shield, which prevented stray neutrons from creating a premature detonation or 'fizzle'. Outside of the neutron shield was a 'tamper' of about 50 kg of natural uranium (U 238) in two hemispheres. The 'tamper' was intended to hold the 'pit' together for long enough for a fission chain reaction to build up!  Surrounding the 'tamper' were a series of lenses of fast ( 60 % RDX, 39 % TNT and 1% wax) and slow (Baratol) explosives. These explosives were triggered by 30 detonators, which were all fired at the same instant by an electronic timing circuit.     As the bomb was detonated, the fast and slow explosives produced a very smooth inward, spherical, shock front, which compressed the 'tamper' (inertial confinement) and crushed the plutonium 'pit' to about one-half of its volume. The crushing process had to take less than 40 milliseconds to prevent spontaneous fission in the Pu240 from prematurely detonating the pit. The initiator then released its blizzard of neutrons into the 'pit' and the fission chain reaction built up. As a neutron strikes a Pu239 nucleus, it fissions it into two smaller nuclei with the release of about 200 Mev of energy. Pu239 has an area probability of fission measured as 742 barns (1 barn = 10^-28 m squared). Furthermore, the fission reaction releases two neutrons, which 'fuel' the fission chain reaction. It was the tamper or inertial confinement that held the pit together for long enough for the chain reaction to become a catastrophic explosion - finally releasing about 21 Kilo tonnes of TNT explosive power. It is estimated that this first nuclear detonation, fissioned about 1 kg of plutonium and converted about 1 gram of matter into energy.      Wikipedia comments that, '... "Fat Man" was detonated at an altitude of about 1,800 feet (550 m) over the city, and was dropped from a B-29 bomber Bockscar, piloted by Major Charles Sweeney of the 393d Bombardment Squadron, Heavy. The bomb had a yield of about 21 kilotons of TNT, or 8.781013 joules = 88 TJ (terajoules). Because of Nagasaki's hilly terrain, the damage was somewhat less extensive than that in relatively flat Hiroshima. An estimated 39,000 people were killed outright by the bombing at Nagasaki, and about 25,000 were injured. Thousands more would die later from related blast and burn injuries, and hundreds more from radiation illnesses from exposure to the bomb's initial radiations. The aerial bombing raid on Nagasaki had the third highest fatality rate in World War II after the nuclear strike on Hiroshima and the March 9/10 1945 fire bombing raid on Tokyo.  ...'     Robert J. Oppenheimer, the leader of the bomb project,  later would be persuaded to quote for a 1965 for a television broadcast:   We knew the world would not be the same. A few people laughed, a few people cried. Most people were silent. I remembered the line from the Hindu scripture, the Bhagavad-Gita; Vishnu is trying to persuade the Prince that he should do his duty, and to impress him, takes on his multi-armed form and says, 'Now I am become Death, the destroyer of worlds.' I suppose we all thought that, one way or another.'    Let us hope that these weapons are never used again!!!|`|M9JcanLKaa	Other answers have explained the principles of the chain reaction where one nucleus releases 3 neutrons, which potentially split three further nuclei and then 9 and so on until the radioactive material is consumed. It is the fragmentation of the nucleus that releases vast amount of energy as heat. This incinerates anything that will burn in its path and creates a massive pressure wave pushing gas at unimaginable temperatures out from the "ground zero".    However, to make sure the neutrons hit another nucleus you need to have a large enough mass of the Uranium, otherwise too many neutrons escape before they trigger another nucleus to split. The mass required is the "critical mass". Nuclear weapons have the radioactive material in separate pieces kept apart and brought together only when the detonation is triggered.|`|Z6ZM9p1waa	they blow it up before it gets to the ground... they dont want just a hole in the ground, they want range.    the explosion will kill people within a long distance, then the radiation goes even farther.      the blast isnt small...|`|AA11169105	They tend to airburst as this gives an overpressure over a wide area.

It can be exploded very close to the ground or higher up in the air.|`|1305765249b53f290c467decdedb9e3aaa	Nuclear bombs have barometric sensors in them measuring air pressure once they get to a acceleration and height or depth a neutron is sent into the uranium starting a nuclear fission chain reaction; the neutron hits a atom which releases 3 neutrons and energy which hits 3 atoms releasing 9 neutrons which hits 9 atoms releasing 27 neutrons etc really quickly the strong nuclear force( which holds protons and neutrons in the nucleus of the atom) gets released and the huge amounts of energy get's released. the resulting blast kills people instantly if they are in close proximity the gamma rays will travel further causing huge problems in biological systems such as humans causing leukemia sterility and wipes out bone marrow stem cells causing a lack of immune function (in some cases)  It isn't gas that kill people it is high energy electromagnetic radiation which also causes all electric technology to stop working.  Well that is a very incomplete description, but I hope it helps you to see what kind of threats nuclear bombs pose to everyone on earth.

A number in scientific and/or exponential notation is made up of two factors.  The first factor is a number with a decimal point.  The second factor is the number 10 raised to some power (exponent).  To be in the "scientific" notation, the first factor must have only one non-zero digit in front of the decimal point.  To move the existing decimal point behind the first non-zero digit "6", it must be moved 8 places to the right.  It is equivalent to multiplying the first factor by 100,000,000.  The first factor becomes 6.137, one hundered million times larger than it was before.  To avoid changing the value of the entire number, we must make the second factor smaller by dividing it by one hundred million.

Specifically, it is "a measure of the amount of renewable resources in the environment in units of the number of organisms these resources can support" (Roughgarden 1979, p. 305) and is specified as K in the biological literature.    Carrying capacity is a function of characteristics of both the area and the organism. A larger or richer area will, ceteris paribus, have a higher carrying capacity. Similarly, a given area will be able to support a larger population of a species with relatively low energetic requirements (e.g., lizards) than one at the same trophic level with high energetic requirements (e.g., birds of the same individual body mass as the lizards). The carrying capacity of an area with constant size and richness would be expected to change only as fast as organisms evolve different resource requirements. Though the concept is clear, carrying capacity is usually difficult to estimate.    For human beings, the matter is complicated by two factors: substantial individual differences in types and quantities of resources consumed and rapid cultural (including technological) evolution of the types and quantities of resources supplying each unit of consumption. Thus, carrying capacity varies markedly with culture and level of economic development.    We therefore distinguish between biophysical carrying capacity, the maximal population size that could be sustained biophysically under given technological capabilities, and social carrying capacities, the maxima that could be sustained under various social systems (and, especially, the associated patterns of resource consumption). At any level of technological development, social carrying capacities are necessarily less than biophysical carrying capacity, because the latter implies a human factory-farm lifestyle that would be not only universally undesirable but also unattainable because of inefficiencies inherent in social resource distribution systems (Hardin 1986). Human ingenuity has enabled dramatic increases in both biophysical and social carrying capacities for H. sapiens, and potential exists for further increases.    4. The half-life of a quantity whose value decreases with time is the interval required for the quantity to decay to half of its initial value. The concept originated in describing how long it takes atoms to undergo radioactive decay, but also applies in a wide variety of other situations.    The term "half-life" dates to 1907. The original term was "half-life period", but that was shortened to "half-life" starting in the early 1950s.    Half-lives are very often used to describe quantities undergoing exponential decayfor example radioactive decaywhere the half-life is constant over the whole life of the decay. However, a half-life can also be defined for non-exponential decay processes, although in these cases the half-life varies throughout the decay process.    5. 3.10 + 4*10 = $ 43.10    6.Value of house after 5 years     100,000 (1+8/100)^5 = 100,000* (27/25)^5  = 100,000 * 27/25 * 27/25 * 27/25 * 27/25 *27/25 = 36,73,320 approx.|`|4wqYb923aa	1.  An earthquake of magnitude 7 has energy equivalent of       32,000,000 tons of TNT while an eqarthquake of magnitude 5 has       energy equivalent of 32,000 TNT.  Therefore,      32,000,000/32,000 = 1000.        Hence, a Magnitude 7 earthquake has 1000 times energy as that of       Magnitude 5 earthquake.    2.  1 ton of TNT is equivalent to 4.184 x 10^9 Joules       A 7.5 magnitude has energy equivalent of 160 million tons of TNT       7.9 - 7.5 = 0.4       10^0.4^(3/2) = 3.98       Hence 3.98 x 160 million tons TNT = 636.97 million tons TNT       Therefore,       636,970,000 Tons TNT x 4.184 x 10^9 Joules/1Ton TNT =       = 2.665 x10^18 Joules   answer    3.  'Carrying capacity' is defined as the maximum population a given        ecosystem (or planet) can support indefinitely without harming the        ecosystem so that future generations will have to reduce their        population. The carrying capacity of a planet is dependent upon        several factors: the economic activity of that population and how it        affects the environment, the amount of resources available on the        planet and how easily the environment can be damaged.       This means that Earth's carrying capacity can vary. For example,        if everyone on Earth lived a typical American lifestyle with the        same consumption that implies, then Earth would be able to        support a lot less people than if everyone lived at a different        lifestyle which involved less consumption.

KfBWOvf3aa	an object with lower specific heat capacity means you need less heat to increase the object's temperature. just a little bit of heat can increase the temperature quite high. therefore, the opposite is also true: little loss of heat can decrease the temperature quite substantially. therefore, water with a lower specific heat will more likely to freeze.|`|AA10058555	more likely too|`|1MEPLdJJaa	Due to the thermal buffering of their environment, aquatic invertebrates are less likely than their terrestrial counterparts to face temperatures substantially below 0C. Aquatic invertebrates may not be able to avoid internal freezing by supercooling (remaining unfrozen at temperatures below the freezing point of their body fluids), however, because when their body temperatures reach the freezing point of body fluids, these organisms will likely be in contact with external ice, which may induce formation of internal ice (i.e., inoculative freezing). In this study, a variety of winter-collected, aquatic invertebrates (a clam, Sphaerium sp.; an isopod, Lirceus fontinalis; a mayfly, Stenomena femoratum; a belostomatid, Belostoma flumineum; 2 dytiscids, Ilybius oblitus and Agabus disintegratus) and, for comparison, a terrestrial beetle (Hippodamia convergens) were studied with respect to their low temperature tolerance. No species appeared to lower its freezing point appreciably by accumulating colligatively active solutes in body fluids, and all aquatic species supercooled moderately (-5 to -7C), but significantly less than the terrestrial beetle (-16C), before freezing when chilled in a dry environment. However, when chilled in contact with external ice, all animals froze at their melting points or just below (as low as -2C for the beetles), showing that they are susceptible to inoculative freezing. All aquatic species readily survived exposures to sub-zero temperatures when supercooled, but succumbed to the same conditions when inoculated by external ice. Survival of low temperatures by temperate zone aquatic invertebrates appears to depend upon thermal buffering provided by the aquatic environment, slow progress of ice formation in bodies of water at high sub-zero temperatures, avoidance of contact with external ice, and tolerance of high sub-zero temperatures when freezing does not occur in the animals themselves.|`|8xBS8w4Baa	AS water had a lower specific heat capacity SO IT WILL FREEZE QUICKLY.|`|CEkJIFGZaa	OK, the answer is simple, and takes lesser detail, and more concept.    The specific heat capacity is how many joules of heat would it take for a certain substance to gain or lose temperature. Its like how much bites would it take a certain material to be chewed to a specific consistence. Well, u get the point. So, its only a measure of how much would it take to lose or gain a degree...    When u name a season, like winters u say, u see, it doesnt really make alot of differece. Yes, the time taken for the lakes to freeze would reuce, since the lesser number of joules required would be delivered in a shorter time, but then when the heat exchange would last over the days and night, the lakes would freeze anyway, even if more heat capacity would mean more time. So they'd take lesser joule packets, and so lesser time to freeze.    So we cant exactly say that the lakes would be more or less likely to freeze since the specific heat capacity doesnt make a difference when we have an excess of time.    Also make note that if we talk strictly in terms of freezing or melting, the specific heat capacity is not involved. It is involved in temperature change, where                              E = m x c x (temperature change)    But in freezing, there is no temperature change. Its purely the energy being lost and the molecules closing in, so the concept of latent heat of fusion is involved. The formula that relates heat with freezing is                                             E = m x Lf    where no c is involved. But thats a separate long story...

X0e6p9Ilaa	If you assume that brine is a solution of sodium chloride, then there are Na+ ions, Cl- ions and of course from the water you have a minute amount of H+ ions and OH- ions.    The cathode is always the electrode where reduction occurs.  Reduction is the gain of electrons.  The anode is always the electrode where oxidation occurs.      Remember it by "A red cat ate an ox."   Red cat = reduction at cathode.  An ox = oxidation at anode.  Also, OILRIG.  Oxidation is loss, reduction is gain.  Therefore, the loss of electrons occurs at the anode, and the gain of electrons occurs at the cathode.    Assuming you are electrolyzing the brine, then hydrogen will be produced at one electrode, the one connected to the negative pole of the voltage source. Since the reduction of hydrogen occurs at this electrode, then it is cathode.     2H2O + 2e-  -->  H2 + 2OH- ...  Reduction.  Reduction occurs at the cathode.  Or, you could say H+ instead of water.    At the electrode connected to the positive pole of the voltage source you will have the oxidation of chloride ion to chlorine.  This will be the anode, were oxidation occurs.    2Cl-  -->  Cl2 + 2e-  ..... Oxidation.  Oxidation occurs at the anode.    The ions that remain in solution are sodium ions and hydroxide ions, Which will form NaOH when the water slowly evaporates at room temperature.  Recovering NaOH is tricky, since heating solid NaOH drives off more water to make Na2O.    The universal indicator should be blue to purple at the electrode where H2 is being produced, since there will be an abundance of OH- ions there.  It should be green around the electode where chlorine is being produced.    By the way.  How did  you deal with the chlorine gas that was given off.

5qkjA7awaa	I have a couple of answers, the first is a true case example.    Way back in the 1980's we had a brand new Electrical Engineer. She was, coincidentally, a "she". Well, when she first arrived, fresh from college, we had a few things that needed cleaning up in the lab and she got the most tedious job ever .... sorting out a "junk bin" full of thousands of resistors and other electrical circuit components back into their bins by value, size and current capacity. It was a very tedious job and I felt it was somewhat disrespectful but, hey, it needed to be done and she did it with dedication and determination. She went on to become a very respected and valued Engineer.    I think the best answer for this kind of question in an interview is to tell the interviewer that you'll do "whatever it takes" because you're part of the team and want the team to succeed. I, myself, have had to do everything from empty the waste baskets to wiping down lab benches. Your co-workers come to respect the colleague that is willing to pitch in and do "whatever it takes". You are above no one, even the janitor.    Once you get hired, here are my tips for success, 1) Ask you boss to give you the toughest job he's got. Take the problem that has been puzzling everyone. Be prepared to struggle, but, in the end, you will find the answers and you will learn and know more than the average engineer. 2) Stay broad in your usefulness. Tackle a wide variety of problems and do not become too specialized. In lean times, it's the "Jack of all trades" that will be most valued. 3) Network. Collaborate as much as possible with work groups from other companies and subcontractors and joint projects. Getting your reputation to grow outside your company is  a very positive way to learn new methods and to increase your value to the company.    Anyway, I hope this helps.

We have  cos 18 = sin 72 = 2 sin 36 cos 36 = 4 sin 18 cos 18 cos 36  4 sin 18(1 - 2 sin^2 18) = 1  8 sin^3 18 -4 sin 18 + 1 = 0  Let x = sin 18  8x^3 -4x + 1 = 0  (2x-1)(4x^2 + 2x -1) = 0.  We know 2x =1 is impossible,  so 4x^2 + 2x -1 = 0, which gives us  x = sin 18 = (-1 + 5)/4    Stage 2. Compute cos 36  cos 36 = 1 - 2 sin^2 18 =   1 - 2*(-1 + 5)^2/16,  and, simplifying, we get  cos 36 = (1 + 5)/4    Stage 3. Compute sin 36  sin 36 = (1 - cos^2 36) = (1 - (1+5)^2/16),  and this simplifies to  sin 36 = (10 - 25))/4,  as desired.

There are several explanations: cannulae are sterilized during manufacture, so using sterile ones is routine medical procedure. Secondly, there is a chance that the prisoner could receive a stay of execution after the cannulae have been inserted, as happened in the case of James Autry in October 1983 (he was eventually executed on March 14, 1984).

aHN5fDwQaa	A negative exponent indicates that the value goes in the denominator, so 4^-3 = 1/(4^3)    In most cases, an inequality can be treated like an equality when solving a problem. The exception comes when you must multiply or divide each side by a negative number. In that case, you must reverse the inequality.    For example,  9 - x > 3  -x > -6  (subtract 9 from each side)  x     Note that the inequality is reversed in the last step.    Let's solve the same problem a different way:  9 - x > 3  9 > 3 + x (Add x to each side)  6 > x (Subtract 3 from each side)    In this case, it was not necessary to reverse the inequality    Compare the results from the two solutions  x   6 > x (second solution)    Do you see that these two solutions are the same?  If you do not reverse the inequality when multiplying (or dividing) by a negative number then the solutions don't work out to give the same result.

F211fxNFaa	An air gap in the core of a transformer helps to prevent magnetic core saturation.    As the core of a transformer reaches maximum magnetization (we say the core is saturated), no more energy can be passed across it and the energy in the secondary is distorted. With an air gap in the core it is much more difficult for the core to saturate as the flux in air (across the gap) does not saturate nearly as easily does the flux in the iron core of the transformer.    I hope this is helpful.

The denominator is easy to factor.    (x^4+5x^2+4) = (x^2+1)(x^2+4)    The roots of that are all imaginary, so factoring the numerator isn't going to cancel anything useful since (x^2+1) and (x^2+4) are definitely not among its factors. The result has to use partial fractions.    (x^3-2x^2+x+1)/[(x^2+1)(x^2+4)] = (ax+b)/(x^2+1) + (cx+d)/(x^2+4)  x^3-2x^2+x+1 = (ax+b)(x^2+4) + (cx+d)(x^2+1)  x^3-2x^2+x+1 = (a+c)x^3 + (b+d)x^2 + (4a+c)x + (4b+d)  a+c = 1  b+d = -2  4a+c = 1  4b+d = 1  a = 0  b = 1  c = 1  d = -3    So that reduces the rational expression to:    (x^3-2x^2+x+1)/[(x^2+1)(x^2+4)] = (ax+b)/(x^2+1) + (cx+d)/(x^2+4)  (x^3-2x^2+x+1)/[(x^2+1)(x^2+4)] = 1/(x^2+1) + (x-3)/(x^2+4)  (x^3-2x^2+x+1)/[(x^2+1)(x^2+4)] = 1/(x^2+1) + x/(x^2+4) - 3/(x^2+4)    The integral is arctan(x) + ln(x^2+4)/2 - 3/2 arctan(x/2) + C.

There are doctors that are specialized in different areas for internal medicine, and sometimes if they are not sure which part of the body is affected, your doctor will send you to one that specializes in all of the areas.    4) Cardiologist -- sometimes with poor blood circulation, it could be from problems that are experienced within the heart or vessels.

EHrbDq0naa	Spinach has recently lost it's status where iron is concerned. It has been discovered that back when it was first touted as the "iron man" of vegetables, the researchers in the lab made a decimal point error in recording the percentage of iron, and particularly in the percentage of *digestible* iron, that it contains, meaning the amount that our bodies can actually absorb and use.  If I can find my source for that article, I'll come back and post it here.    However, for your project, the ability to digest the iron shouldn't be a factor. Broccoli may be higher in iron than spinach. Unexpected, huh?  But does it have sufficient iron content for your project?     There may be other plants, some we don't consider edible, that are richer in iron.  I'll be back if I find more info. I hope you post anything you find out, too.  This interests me.    Add: In the last few minutes, I have learned that Romain and Curly Kale have a high percentage of iron, higher, in fact, than sirloin steak! I've never had either one in my garden so I don't know how fast they grow. You probably find out easily, though.    Red lentils and figs have even more but probably not as fast growing.

Therefore it is a linear equation.|`|IrjESEyvaa	ax+b=0 is a liner equation.    conventionally, we always write an equation into the form y=ax+c.  first we make y the subject of the formula. in this case, the equation is actually ax+b=0y.     a linear equation is called so because if you draw the equation into a graph, it would be a straight line. for example, y=2x+3, y=x and x=1 where x=1 would just be a line cutting the x axis at 1. so for your equation,     ax+b=0  ax= -b  x= -b/a    so it is a linear equation and there is only one variable, x, since y will always be 0. hope that helps.
ICx6McGJaa	There is always a very close interaction between organisms and their environment, such that one is affected by the other.              Organisms for their various needs like food, shelter, protection, choice of mating partners etc. must sense and respond to their environments. For example-  1- Human beings primarily identify their food by vision and smell. They know danger by the sense of touch, vision, smell etc.  The list goes on............

Hw5xFK0qaa	Let the number of horses he bought be H, the number of goats be G, and the number of sheep be S.    We know he bought 100 animals, so H + G + S = 100 .......... (1)    We know he spent 100 crowns, so 7H / 2 + 4G / 3 + S / 2 = 100 .......... (2)    We also know that H, G, and S are integers, and each is greater than or equal to 7.    From (2), we can also see that G must be a multiple of 3, as otherwise the LHS will not be an integer.    (2) - (1): 5H / 2 + G / 3 - S / 2 = 0    S = 5H + 2G / 3    Using this in (2):  7H / 2 + 4G / 3 + 5H / 2 + G / 3 = 100    6H + 5G / 3 = 100    G = (300 - 18H) / 5    Now, H  7 and we require G  9  as 9 is the smallest multiple of 3 that exceeds 7:    G = (300 - 18H) / 5  9  300 - 18H  45  300 - 45  18H  H  255 / 18 = 14.1666...    So, we need only test integer values of H satisfiying 7  H  14    But... the requirement for (300 - 18H) / 5 = G to be an integer further restricts H to being a multiple of 5.

Examples 1: if you are going 55mph and staying at the speed, your velocity is 55 mph, but your acceleration is zero because your velocity is not changing.    2: if you are going 55 mph and then slow down to 30 mph then you acceleration is a negative number because your velocity has decreased over a certain time.

YYLybWHSaa	These are early versions of arborescent or woody trees. Plants like this have bifacial vascular cambium that put on annual girth growth. They grew large stems/trunks with secondary xylem that supported a  branching stem system & fern-like leaves. The trunk had branching with alternate helical arrangements. These trees were able to grow apical branches and adventitious shoots in response to the changing environment. Unplanned branching patterns on stems and roots. This allowed the plant to grow where  the light was. The helical arrangement of branches allowed light to reach lower branches with less self shading.

The tangent at (c2 / 4, c2 / 4) - which is x + y = c2 / 2 - also shows the intercepts sum to c2 and not to c.

i0ypGmlQaa	No, of course it isn't. Mathematicians argue constantly over whether specific logical assumptions are appropriate, necessary, or reasonable.    The axiom of choice, for example, is hotly debated by some. In general, mathematicians are wise enough to acknowledge that there is no "right" system of logic (logicians in fact study all systems of logic in their own right). Rather than debate it, we simply acknowledge what kinds of logical system we use or do not use, and prove theorems within that system.    There are also systems of logic that are extremely different than the typical systems. For example, in "fuzzy logic" some statements are true, some statements are false, but some are literally between true and false. That doesn't mean "I ate a cookie and a pie" when I only ate one. That statement would still be false.    Instead, the entire notion of "true or false" is translated to true=1, false=0, and statements are assigned the value 1, 0, OR anything between.    And this logical system is sometimes better!    Bob is tall, true or false???    Well, if Bob is 7'2" (2.2 meters), then heck yes, he is tall. TRUE  If Bob is 4'11" (1.5 meters) then no way, he is not tall. FALSE    What if Bob is 5'10" (1.8 meters)? Is that statement true or false?? Regular logic doesn't give us a very good way to answer that, but fuzzy logic handles it just fine. The statement is 0.5 on the truth scale.

zf8BnU6Yaa	Well, you might be able to make a living as an architect, it requires knowledge of structural elements and materials used in buildings.  It is a little limited in that outside of home design, most of the work is in industrial and commercial buildings and a lot of that is fairly standardized.  In any case, you will have to live on whatever salary or commissions you can make.  What you want to learn has a bearing on how successful you will be, but we don't always have the choices to do what we really love, unless we are willing to live the live style that it provides, which may not be that great.  A few dreamers are able to live well on their dreams but the rest of us realize that you end up making compromises in order to live fairly well.  Talk with an architect and get a feel for where you would be going if you pursue that career.  A professor can help but a working architect is the best source of information and maybe you can see a working office.  Remember, engineers work with architects so there is a tie there.  Mostly structural engineering is tied closely to architects as the latter profession wants to build things that look impossible and rely upon engineering to make them real.|`|8f1645b57626d40f1d90691f3e9c2772aa	Unless you have some other form of income (sugar momma?)

c1a600e6083d6130287db4610398bcd3aa	The drag coefficient is a number which aerodynamicists use to model all of the complex dependencies of drag on shape, inclination, and some flow conditions. The drag coefficient Cd is equal to the drag D divided by the quantity: density r times reference area A times one half of the velocity V squared.     Cd = D / (.5 * r * V^2 * A)     The drag has to be measured in a wind tunnel.  This has been done for a flat plate which would approximate your dish quite closely.  The orientation of the plate is at right angles to the flow, which I understand you to mean.  Ths value obtained for Cd at subsonic speeds is 1.28.|`|tBO56G4laa	F = .5*rho*A*U^2*Cd    You will need to measure the force on the dish from that wind to calculate the Cd.

YYLybWHSaa	Apples (Malus domestica) can have a maximum of two seeds per pocket in the ovary but the seeds only grow if the flowers were pollinated. The more seeds are pollinated the larger the apple will grow as a result. It requires a minimum of 6-7 of the total possible seeds in the ovary to be pollinated for a fruit of good size to grow at all. The number of pockets is five in almost all apples so 10 seeds are the most seeds a common variety will have.  This means the seed count was dependent on the flower attracting the pollinator. So unless you believe there is a link between the attractiveness of the flower to its pollination partners and the color of the fruit that grows from the flowers I see no connection between the number of fertilized seeds and the color of the fruit that grows after this event. A fruit is the flesh and seed resulting from a fertilized and ripened flower ovary.     You need to point out that pigments in fleshy fruit attract animals (birds or mammals) to disperse seeds after the seeds mature. Pigments in the flowers are there to attract insects as pollination partners. These are separate events under different evolutionary selection pressures so probably not directly linked.   Look at this cartoon about how genes are turned on and off in a plants parts  http://www.four-h.purdue.edu/apple_genom...    I am not saying you shouldn't count the seeds by fruit color. But you should point out that the flower color, shape, & smell, which attract insects to pollinate, are directly related to the number of seeds, not the color of the apples.    So you point out the next  research question you would ask as a scientist is: are the flowers that produce green apples different from the flowers that produce red apples? Is it  possible red apples come from flowers with more of a pink tinge and that green apples come from plainer less colored or even white blossoms?     Apple blossoms have five white petals that are tinted pink but can be just white.  http://beautifulgardens.shootgardening.c...  http://beautifulgardens.shootgardening.c...|`|x7HeOqAxaa	You might start like this:    1) talk about the idea that it's possible that different apples might have different amount of seeds.    2) talk about the consequences of having more or less seeds( e.g. agriculture, food and eating etc.)    3) Get about 3 apples of each type of apples.    4) count the seeds in every apple and make a record of the frequencies. You can do it with a table which is very-well presented and easy to follow.    5) develop your conclusion based on your results.    this will make a good project.

ltDnlSqJaa	I do not believe farmer's should be allowed to use pesticides to increase crop yields. If more producers would implement Plant Health Care (PHC) and Integrated Pest Management (IPM) practices then yields would be higher and the soils that they rely on for production would be healthier and able to support greater yields.  Pesticides are a single tool in the arsenal against pests, be they weeds, insects or disease. They should NOT be the first tool of choice but rather, they should be used selectively when the threshold of a particular pest has surpassed preset limits.  Thresholds are the limit at which further tolerance of the existing population of a pest in not acceptable. An economic threshold may be considered the point at which profit margin or revenue generation is at risk or where the expense of stringent control methods is less than the expense of repairing the damage that the pest will cause.  The first line of defense against any pest is prevention. Prevention tactics should be incorporated into any site where an IPM/PHC program should be applied. These tactics include, but are not limited to the following:  Ensuring optimal soil conditions, site design, plant selection and diversity, plant care, and sanitization i.e. cleaning up debris that could harbour various pests at the end of harvesting.  There are many resources on the internet that provide valuable information on IPM and PHC. Local agencies for agriculture are also valuable sources for info and assistance when trying to create a cost effective IPM/PHC program that will enhance yields and yet maintain environmental health and stability.

Suppose x_n -> L as n -> infinity.    Then x_{n+1} -> L  as well.    Then L = 2 - 1/L so that    L^2 = 2L  - 1    L^2 -2L + 1 =0    (L-1)^2=0    L=1    Thus the limit, assuming one exists, must be 1.    The existence of such a limiting value can be handled seperately.

Flux pens are also available.    Hope you find this answer useful.

Amkmles0aa	ok i do not know what you are saying what is a ohms|`|CEkJIFGZaa	Cuple of equations involved,     (a) the resisters in parallel give a total effective resistence which is given by the formula:    Effective resistence (E.R) = (1/R1) + (1/R2) + (1/R3) ...    R1, R2 and R3 being the resistors connected in parallels.  and the E.R. is always smaller than the smallest resistence in parallels.    So    E.R. in parallel = 1/40 + 1/60 + 1/120                          =0.05 ohms.    hence this is the resistance in parallels, and can be considered as one resistor. So the resistors in the series add up to the resistence value of    Total Resistance = 15 + 25 + 0.05                             = 40.05 ohms    As we know and as the ohms law states, V = I R, (v is the voltage, I is the current, R is resistence)    V = IR  I  = V/R    =  120/40.05    = 2.996 Amps    b) the current remains constant in the circuit except in parallel circuitry, and as it is in series and not parallel, the 15 ohm resistor has 2.996 Amps.    c) We calculate the voltage appearing acroos the parallel circuit by ohms law again.  We know from before that the current in the circuit is 2.996 amps and the resistance across the parallel is 0.05. Lets calculate:    V = I R    = 2.996 x 0.05    = 0.1498 Volts    d)The voltage and the potential drop are the same thing, and hence that too is 0.1498 ohms    e) we know the voltage across the resistor, as calculated in (c) and (d). it is 0.1498 Volts. and hence, by ohms law    V = I R  I  = V / R    = 0.1498/120   = 0.001248 amps.    Thats that... Know your ohms law, and physics in electricity is baby food...|`|iS7YKrRwaa	First, you must find the equivalent resistance in the circuit.    For resistors in series,:   Equivalent Resistance = R1 + R2 + R3 +...    In parallel:  1/(equivalent resistance) = 1/R1 + 1/R2 + 1/R3 +...    In the problem:  1/(equivalent resistance) = 1/40 + 1/60 + 1/120 = 1/20  The parallel section of the circuit has a resistance of 20 ohms.    Now the resistors may be added together as a series circuit to get the equivalent resistance for the whole circuit.  15 + 25 + 20 = 60 ohms    a) Now that you have the equivalent resistance for the circuit, you can find the total current.  Current = Voltage/Resistance, so I = 120/60 = 2 Amps    b) In series circuits, the current is the same through all resistors, so the current through the 15 ohm resistor is also   2 Amps    c) Potential drop is just another term for voltage.  In series, Total Voltage = V1 + V2 + V3 + ...  Because we are looking at the parallel circuit as a whole, we can consider it to be replaced with a single equivalent resistor, that we solved for previously (20 ohms).  Since current is the same everywhere in a series circuit, we know that I= 2 Amps  From that, we can use V = IR to find the voltage.  V = 2 * 20 = 40 Volts    d) Since potential drop is voltage, we just solved for this,   V = 40 Volts    e) Once again, we can use I = V/R  The voltage is the same through a parallel circuit, so it is still 40 volts, and we already know the resistance is 120 ohms.  I = 40/120 = 1/3 Amps which is approximately .33 Amps

SvmZlLdaaa	One word: ignorance. Children grow up hearing stories about 'the big bad wolf', and many enter adulthood still believing that wolves are bloodthirsty villains that will gobble up your grandma, something many films perpetuate. If you have heard this all your life, you may well never think to question it, but the truth is that there is no record of a healthy wolf ever attacking or killing a human. All reports of 'wolf attacks', when investigated, have proved to be attacks by feral dogs, wolf-dog hybrids, or rabid wolves.    Farmers are of course going to dislike and want to destroy any animal that preys on their livestock, as wolves sometimes do. Again, though, this threat is greatly exaggerated. Wolves are afraid of people, and would rather avoid them than risk entering human-inhabited areas to kill livestock. Wolves would much rather hunt their natural prey than domestic animals, but in many areas that prey has been driven off to make way for farms. Wolves are predators - they have no choice but to hunt and kill to feed themselves - and if cattle or sheep is all that's available, that is what they'll kill and eat. They can hardly be blamed for simply trying to survive, or so you might think. Farmers tend to disagree, and rather than fencing their livestock properly, or paying for shepherds or guard dogs, prefer to demand that all wolves in the area be killed.    There are those who enjoy trophy hunting animals for 'sport', and gain some sort of thrill from killing a large predator like a wolf - it appears to make them feel tough, despite their being in no danger and the animal having no chance. Those who prefer to kill animals like moose and elk, of which wolves are natural predators, seem to think that fewer wolves will mean more animals for humans to hunt, and call for their destruction for this reason. This sort of thinking shows a shocking lack of understanding of how ecosystems work - there is a balance between predator and prey in nature. Wolves weed out the weak and sick, leaving only strong, healthy animals to breed, important for the health of the species as a whole. This is in marked contrast to the way humans hunt - they tend to kill the strong, dominant males with large racks of antlers, removing the prime breeding males and leaving only weak ones to breed, weakening the species. In areas where wolves have been exterminated, the populations of prey animals explode. The unnatural numbers of these animals damage their environment by overgrazing, which eventually leads to lack of enough food and mass starvation. Here in the UK, we must cull our deer to prevent this happening - a much better, more natural solution would be to reintroduce wolves, as was done in Yellowstone Park in the US, but good luck trying to convince the government of this, since much of the public are still uneducated about and needlessly afraid of wolves.    Wolves have also been used at times in history as a religious symbol for the Devil, the savage, carnivorous opposite to the gentle 'lamb of God'.    Wolves have been persecuted for centuries due to irrational fear and hatred - they were once the most widespread mammal in the world aside from ourselves, but their range has been drastically reduced by a combination of hunting and habitat loss. Sadly, many other species have also been demonised and are routinely hated and killed for no good reason - snakes, rats, hyenas, bats and spiders are examples. Attitudes like these need changing urgently - in today's world, in which so many species are teetering on the brink of extinction, it's vital that people learn to respect and protect animals, and understand that all species are important to the health of ecosystems as a whole.|`|dc49d60c4d19a92e193ce2f41c92cfedaa	I love wolves and they are very beautiful but I wouldn't go out and try petting a lightning bolt any more than I would try petting a wolf|`|dcd11iUwaa	for generations we've been told to loathe and fear wolves.

They are not dogs, they are carnivors, and there have been plenty of injuries and death by both wolves and hybrids since their behavior is so unpredictable.

So, evolution dictates that those who fear and hide from predators will more likely survive and therefore reproduce and, through generations of this it has been embedded into our DNA to fear wolves, even though with technology they are not much of a threat anymore. Also, some ranchers don't like them because they are not very good at their job and who better to blame than an animal that can't defend itself.|`|E70A7aqcaa	I can afford to be loving to wolves too, since I'm smart enough to stay within some protective barrier, and keep my pets fenced in, and have no livestock to worry about, but when any one of those situations is compromised, THEN I start worrying.  We have coyotes where I live, and I love to hear them at night howling and yipping.  They're beautiful sounding, and a bit eerie too, just like a wolf, but once I'm away from my  home and lights, I take a different view of them.  The coyote, just like the wolf, is a predatory animal, and, regardless of who's "fault" it is that we "hate" or "fear" them, it's a great stroke of dumb when we fail to recognize their killing capacity.  It's pure wisdom to have respect, which includes fear, of those two animals when you're away from any protective area, and I can guarantee you that if I'm away from my house, since I live deep in the woods, I damn sure carry a rifle and pistol, not only for the coyote and wolf, but also for the wild pigs in this area.

You can't really fault the animals for that, but you can't expect people to love them for it either.  Wolf attacks are relatively low as not that many people venture off into wolf territory that often (espically unprepaired, and there is typically easier prey than humans to be had in those areas as well.  Though honestly wolves share that issue with all hunting carnivors.    As for people that actively hate wolves, most of those are likely farmers/ranchers that have problems with packs attacking/killing their livestock.  That's their livelyhood that is being attacked, of course they want to eliminate any threats to that.
Ne5I7Ranaa	First, convert milligrams to kilograms by dividing by 10^6. So, 4.6 mg/cm^3 = 4.6x10^-6 kg/cm^3. Next we need to convert cm^3 to m^3. There are 100 centimeters in a meter, so a cubic meter is 10^6 (100*100*100) times larger than a cubic centimeter. So, we multiply by 10^6, and find that 4.6 mg/cm^3 is actually equal to 4.6 kg/m^3.

You do the rest.    for points (0,2) and (1,4), you will need to find the slope first.  Here's how to do that.     Label your first point (x1, y1) and your second point (x2, y2).      To find the slope, use the following formula:  (y1 - y2)/(x1 - x2)    Just plug in the correct numbers and you will then have your slope, which will might be a fraction, but it could be a whole number.    Then, step 2.  Use the following formula to begin to solve:        y - y1 = m(x-x1)      Choose either point this time.  The y will remain a y, as will the x:  do not put any numbers in there.  However, where you see y1, you will plug in the y value that is given in the point you chose to use.  Where you see x1, you will plug in the x value in the point you chose to use.  Just one point, not both - one or the other.  On the right, the m is equal to the slope you just figured out above, either a fraction or whole number which can be positive or negative.    Now, you will solve the equation for y, meaning:  multiply the value of m on the right by the terms in within the parenthesis.  You should get something like this, except you will have numbers where they should go.  y -   =  x +    (the y and the x will remain that way)    Then, add or subtract the number on the left ( recall y -   ) from both sides so that you will have only y on the left.  Now your equation should look like this:  y = mx + b  where m is the slope and b is the number you just got.  This is the slope/intercept form of the equation of a line.       4.  points:  (0,2) & (1,4)    Slope:  (y1 - y2)/(x1 - x2) = (2 - 4)/(0 - 1) = -2/-1 = 2  this is the slope, or m    Now, use either point to find the equation of the line using the point/slope form.      y - y1 = m(x - x1)  y - 2 = 2(x - 0)  y - 2 = 2x - 0  y - 2 + 2 = 2x - 0 + 2  y = 2x + 2  this is your final answer and the equation of the line.      BUT.  You can use the OTHER point, the one you did not use here, to check your answer and make sure you've done this correctly.    y - 4 = 2(x - 1)  y - 4 = 2x - 2  y - 4 + 4 = 2x - 2 + 4  y = 2x +2  SAME ANSWER!  YAY!  So, my original answer is correct - now I know because I checked by using the other point to solve)    OK?  You do the rest.

But no the water cannot burn.|`|3ZPYB7nxaa	Water itself is a product of most combustion. Combustion is a process in which organic material breaks down and combines with Oxygen gas. Water already contains Oxygen, but since it is a compound, its atoms can be rearranged.     One way to decompose water is to add something especially reactive. Fluorine gas is one way to decompose water:    2F2 + 2H2O -> 4HF + O2    Sodium is another element which can decompose water:    2Na + 2H2O -> 2NaOH + H2    Industrially, water is decomposed using electricity. An electric current can decompose water into its two elements, Hydrogen and Oxygen gas:    2H2O -> 2H2 + O2    However, combustion is usually associated with fire, or at least a great amount of heat. Water can be burned in this respect by blowing superheated steam over charcoal at around 1500 degrees:    H2O + C -> CO + H2    The products are hydrogen and carbon monoxide gas. This mixture is called water gas and is used as a source of natural gas in steel mills.|`|1ibHGaAhaa	Like I said many of times before, anything is possible!

AA11432707	I had a med school classmate in her 40's.  You can go to med school whenever you want.  However, chances are overwhelming that you won't go if you've already trained for something else.    The idea that you can work while in med school is absurd.  Medical school is a full time job and a half.  The clinical years require you to be on call much of the time.    Once you're an accountant, you'll be so used to the income that you won't quit for medical school.    If money is what is important to you, then go for accounting.  Better yet, study accounting AND take all the med school pre-requisites. That leaves you the option of going to medical school when you finish undergrad, but also prepares you for another career if you choose not to go on to med school.|`|CM1dfztQaa	It's never too late. I,m currently looking into a med school in Arizona and was worried that I would be the oldest person in any class.

Never give up on your dreams!|`|6E9sQbIcaa	ONE THING NOBODY IS TO OLD TO STUDY!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!|`|OvRiTQKeaa	You can still study and support your family and go to medical school.    Simply get qualified to work in the medical field as an LPN (one year of studies) or an RN (two years of studies) and work in your chosen field of study while you do your pre-med and med classes. You can work in the field of your choice, making good money, and you may be able to get your employer to pay for some of your college at the same time.    It is likely that not many of your accounting class credits would transfer to the medical classes - except for some of the math classes.    You would be wasting a lot of time, and energy unnecessarily.     I have a friend who did just that. He got his LPN at 20, his RN at 23, and his BSN at 25. He will be able to make a great living while he studies his pre-med classes - and beyond. He has two children and a wife, a house, two cars, etc. He is one happy guy - all due to good planning, keeping on-track with his education,  and keeping his goal in sight.    Follow your heart, not your wallet. You will find you can take care of your family and do what you love at the same time. If you don't, you will end up being resentful toward your work, or family - or both.|`|29ZL58Xjaa	Both of these programs a very intensive in your studies. You need to decide which one you would perfer to do more. Both of them require quite intensive training.    Accountant -- you need a general business degree, and then possibly one in financial, and then you will need to get your licence or degree designation.    MD-- you would need to get your pre med which takes approximately 1-2 years to get, and then you would need to do your md training which takes extensive amounts of time for theory and clinical.    So that is why I am saying that you should carefully choose which one you would want to do.  Both of them are excellent ways to support your family, but both of them as you can see, are very labor intensive, and you should determine which one you're most interested in.  If you want to go into a career pushing numbers, and dealing with different financial aspects, then go into accounting, but if you're interested more in people, and all of that sort of thing, go into medicine.|`|TQZlAOXkaa	yes you can study even 10 years l8r but keep in touch with related subjects! that is important.|`|YtMu47bEaa	Why not study Biology?

Cc2Yb9DKaa	One major factor of air pressure involve the uneven heating and cooling of the Earth.  One side receives sunlight that heats up the air, ground and water, while the other side experiences darkness, allowing the air, ground and water to cool.  As air cools, it contracts and becomes heavy, while warm air expands and rises.  This creates the wind, as air pressures try to equalize.    Another factor involves the tilt of the Earths axis and the uneven heating near to equator compared to the poles.  As air over the equator expands, it pushes upward toward the poles.  This forces cooler air to drop toward the equator where it warms up and repeats the process, leading to weather on the Earth.    Yet, another factor involves the rotation of the Earth and the pull exerted on the air that surrounds the planet.  As the Earth spins, it pulls the air, causing it to drive winds that prevail from West to East, on average.  You may have noticed that weather usually drops from the north or rises from the south, and generally travels from the west coast to the east coast.
UFteXlqwaa	Dreams of Water is correct, ice cream is the key word! Ice cream comes from north Italy where milk products were cooled down to an iced cream by adding salt from the Mediterranean to the ice brought from the Alps mountains.    The thing is: in order to go from gas to liquid, or liquid to ice, water needs to give away energy in form of heat. The opposite it also true; in order to go from solid to liquid, or liquid to gas, water needs to take heat energy. That is the reason we perspire; the evaporation cools our skin.    Salt is added to the road in winter to melt the snow. But before that, it cools down the snow, then that lost of heat is dissipated and the salt mixes with the water to make salty water that is denser and don't freeze that easily.    The same is happening in the process of making ice the old Italian fashion. Only that the process cools down the milky product that is ready to eat before the outside container turns into salty water.    Incidentally, it is the opposite reaction, the warming of the condensing water that is the reason thunderstorms happen. If the air is unstable, i.e. colder than usual aloft, the condensing air keeps rising, never reaching an even temperature with the surrounding before it reaches the tropopause; the top of the troposphere.|`|cvp0SEBNaa	lowers the freezing temp of the ice to make it melt  Lowers the freezing temp so you can make icecream

78b3d834e72deac7083fdd58233b5cbfaa	I think you are going to run into issues with this. The reason that you get so many conflicting reports and different answers on this topic has much more to do with economics than what's in the ground.    Basically, when an oil field is produced, it has to be profitable. Well, as demand growns and supply drops, price increases and fields that were unprofitable become profitable. For example, the Albertan oil sands and Utah/Colorado oil shales are now being investigated for production, and 10 years ago that was unimaginable.    There are vast reserves of organic material that have petroleum potential. The problem is, all the easy fields are gone, and it gets harder and more expensive. Basically, anyone's 'peak oil' estimate is not much more than that, a guess. It's impossible to know how the market will react in the future and how many unprofitable fields will be opened in the future. Take any estimate with a grain of salt.    Below are some American Association of Petroleum Geologists (AAPG, I'm a member!) links to these issues. If you look at their site more, you may find more info you need. Good luck!
52a97cdeeab8c1905fcdec8b39dbfbecaa	there aren't many enzymes in food, mainly in fruits, the enzymes in friuts are very similar to ptylin found in the mouth that help break down sugar, they do not need to be ingested before they activate, a proof of this is the apple test, buy an apple, take a bite and  leave it without covering it for a few minutes, you'll notice that the bitten part starts turning yellowish brown because the enzymes in the apple are already breaking it down.     In summary, they do not need to be ingested before activation, and the major characteristic of an enzyme is that they do not change after they react with (breakdown) food, so they are in the same form before and after they finish breaking down the food. i hope i helped ^___^

DiJVlpjIaa	Apparent power (KVA rating) is different from Real Power (KWatts rating).    Real Power is the power actually converted to another form of energy e.g. mechanical, heat, etc.    Apparent power is the Real Power plus the energy stored in the form of magnetic field within inductors and electric field within capacitors.    The relation between them is the Power Factor (PF) :    PF = Power consumed / Power apparent     or equivalently PF = cos Q where Q is the phase angle  between voltage and current.    The reason because KVA rating is used instead of KW is that KW is meaningless if you want to protect your transformer, since you can have a big current without Real Power when you have a low Power Factor load e.g. when you have a pure inductance as a load (PF=0).     So the KVA rating tell you the maximun current you can get from the transformer regarless of the Real Power you are getting from it. The Real Power could be very low, however you could be excending the maximun current of your transformer if you have a low PF load.    Maximun current =   KVA rating / Secondary voltage|`|oXPDFw4daa	The power rating of a transformer is based on thermal considerations.  Specifically, a transformer is rated on the basis of the power than can pass through a transformer without exceeding a specified temperature rise.  The temperature rise limitation is generally a function of the type of insulation used in making the transformer.    Temperature rises in a transformer as a consequence of heat - and heat is generated through resistive losses - i^2 R.  While it is theoretically possible to specify the throughput rating of a transformer in terms of current, that's not very convenient since the magnitude of current has to be different in the primary and secondary windings.  It's more convenient to normalize throughput to a single value that applies on both windings - and that can be done by multiplying current by voltage to arrive at VA (or more commmonly, kVA or MVA, depending on the actual size of the transformer).

The area under the curve is a rectangle that's 15,000 - 10,000 = 5,000 units long.  The total area under any probability curve has to be 1, so the height has to be 1 / 5,000.    The probability of employee reimbursements exceeding $12,000 is going to be the area of the rectangle where x > 12,000.  So it has a width of 15,000 - 12,000 = 3,000 and a height of 1/5000.

63s8L3yXaa	although the principal described above is correct - 'light' exists as red, green, blue - the combination of all 3 makes white light (ie all are relected off 'white' objects)    if you look at the diagram here:    http://science.hq.nasa.gov/kids/imagers/...    (for the light not pigment)    you can see that an object appears yellow if it reflects red and green light (the addition of red and green equals yellow)    therefore the wavelength of light absorbed would be blue, thus allowing only red and green to be reflected (making yellow)    also see:    http://www.glenbrook.k12.il.us/gbssci/Ph...|`|5dndoudoaa	If the colour you see is yellow, then the plant absorbs all other colours in the visible spectrum. So therefore the dandelion absorbs red, orange, green, blue, indigo and violet, but not yellow.|`|YYLybWHSaa	Light exists as a continuous range of wavelengths emitted by the sun. Visible light is only a small portion of the entire solar spectrum. When all the wavelengths of the visible sunlight spectrum strike your eye at the same time, white is perceived. If some portion is absorbed (subtracted) then we see color from the other wavelengths not filtered out.  http://www.glenbrook.k12.il.us/GBSSCI/PH...    Pigments in the flower petals each absorb a portion of the light. Collectively the various pigments in the flower petals absorb everything except the wavelengths we see as dandelion yellow. Those yellow wavelengths are reflected to our eyes. The flower has absorbed  about 400 - 550nm reflected the next 550 - 600nm then absorbed  about 600 - 700. So next time think of the flower as filtering the blue to green and the orange through red wavelengths to leave a yellow gap for us to see.  http://eosweb.larc.nasa.gov/EDDOCS/Wavel...

AA11513203	I would also go with 'Finding Darwin's God' by Kenneth Miller.    Miller is a devout Catholic, and brilliant cell biologist, and the book centers on how he reconciles his faith in God (and from this faith, a conception of special purpose for humanity) with the irrefutable evidence of human evolution and common ancestry with other organisms.    Here's a nice example (typing from my copy):    "When examined closely, the notion that we must find historical inevitability in a process in order to square with it the intent of a Creator makes absolutely no sense. Yes, the explosive diversification of tlife on this planet was an unpredictable and historically contingent process.  So, for that matter, were the rise of Western civilization, the collapse of the Roman Empire, and the winning number in last night's lottery.   We do not regard the indeterminate nature of any of these events in *human* history as antithetical to the existence of a Creator, so why should we regard similarly indeterminate events in *natural* history any differently?  There is no reason at all.   If we can look at the contingent events in the families that produced our individual lives as being consistent with a Creator, then certainly we can do the same for the chain of circumstances that produced our species."

4DM0yk48aa	If I understand your question correctly, you are trying to figure out how to solve an equation that has two variables.    In order to do this, you need at least two equations that relate those variables. (For the purposes of our example, let's take x + y = 2 and 3x - 6y = -3.)  You then take one of the equations and rearrange it so that it gives a value for one of the variables as a function of the other.  (For example, x + y = 2 would be rearranged to give y = 2 - x.)    You then take that equation and substitute the value in the appropriate place on the other equation.  Continuing the example:    3x - 6y = -3  3x - 6(2-x) = -3  3x - 12 + 6x = -3  9x - 12 = -3  9x = 9  x = 1    You then substitute this back into your equation for the value of y:    y = 2 - x  y = 2 - 1  y = 1    Therefore, the solution for our example is x = 1 and y = 1.|`|AA10875218	I like to see an example of what you mean.
pRF5LLloaa	Black Holes are not "holes".  Black Holes are EXTREMELY dense collections of matter.  That means that they have a huge amount of matter in a very small space.  For example, a black hole might have the same MASS as our Sun, but be the same SIZE as our moon.    Gravity is based on mass, not size -- the greater the MASS of the object, the greater its gravitational forces.    So Black Hole do not have a great gravitational force than any other object of the same mass.  BUT they are more massive that other objects their same size, and so have a greater gravitational force than other objects of the same size.    By the way, there are no "atoms of light", there are PHOTONS of light, but not "atoms".  Atoms have mass; photons do not.  Matter has atoms; light has photons.|`|5kHOqJ2daa	yes it has somethin' t do with curve in space time fabric.....the thing is u know that in a space time fabric, a planet or any object makes a curve due to its mass and anything can fall into that curve except objects heavier than it ......similarly a black hole...caused by collapse of a star into itself, makes it infinitely heavy and make a huge curve which causes a huge curve and its  gravitational force is thus strong...... :)|`|92f97d29e3d55f3219cc25dfabd347c7aa	You are absolutely correct that the effect of gravitation OUTSIDE the black hole is unchanged when the star collapses.  Either way, you have the same 1/r^2 force (or if you are using GR, you have the same Shwarzchild metric).  You can have a companion star orbiting the black hole, and it doesn't know the difference between the black hole and any other star of that mass.    What changes is the force inside and right up close.  For a spherical mass, the gravitational field (we can illustrate the point classically without GR) doesn't go up like 1/r^2 as you approach the center of the planet.  It goes up as like that as you approach the surface, and then it falls linearly (if the mass is of uniform density, somewhat slower if it is heavier inside) between the surface and the center.  The smaller you can compact the mass, the higher a gravitational field you get at the surface.  So for every mass, there is a characteristic radius such that if you can collapse all the mass within that radius, gravity will be strong enough that nothing inside that radius can escape.

Our body being the wonderful organism that it is, through the pressure sensors in the heart, senses the depleted volume and adjusts by increasing the pressure via the vessels to restore normal flow to the brain.

ePkiOzPSaa	Never had to do medical math before... but it seems like a pretty simple problem.    The volume of demerol given will be 1ml for every 100mg.  You are given 80mg, so you do     1ml/xml = 100mg/80mg     Multiplying out gives you     80mg*1ml = 100mg*xml    Dividing the 100 out from both sides will give you     xml = (80mg*ml)/100mg    The simple math from there gives you that     x = 0.8ml Demerol.    The volume of Visatril is basically the same, but easier.  You have 50mg/ml.  You know that you need 50mg, so you do    50mg/xml = 50mg/1ml    Multiplying out gives     50mg*xml = 50mg*1ml    Divide both sides by 50mg and you get     x = 1ml Visatril    The part about the 10 ml multi dose vial seems to be extra information added to confuse you (common practice in word problems, they want YOU to be able to take in the information and pick what's important).    So anyways, .8ml of Demerol and 1ml Visatril.  If you need the total volume of both together, that's obviously 1.8ml.
6ead7e745899491ccfd40dbc9c7d5ef6aa	Yeah, I don't really know for sure, but I heard that many people don't believe it because in the video of man landing on the moon, the flag that was placed there is waving in the background and since there is no wind or air in space, it would be impossible for that video to be real...|`|524f656a521cc9375efb6821b1b2063daa	The original idea (that the Moon landing was faked) came from a small group of people (with a very strong leader) who firmly believed that the Earth is flat, and the centre of a relatively small universe where all the other objects (including the Sun and the Moon) are tiny.    This belief had started somewhere in the UK (not more than a couple of centuries ago) and was based on some very weird interpretation of the Bible (phrases like "the four corners of Earth")    If that were the case, then it is impossible to orbit Earth and to actually walk on the Moon (it is way too small anyways).    The original document (the one showing the "proofs" like the waving flag) was produced by the US leader of this group. He really and truly believed that going to the Moon was impossible.  Therefore, the whole thing (according to him) MUST be a hoax.    All of the "proofs" have been disproved since.    When the guy died, the "Moon Landing Hoax" died with him.      For a while.    Now there are people in the US who are intent in destroying confidence in science and in the social and political fabric of America. Even President Carter said this in a TV address during his presidency (it is not something I just made up).    They -- the hoaxers -- are doing it for for that purpose: destroy8ing confidence.  They don't care that the "proofs" they offer are false.  They only care about the result (destroying confidence).  Hence the heavy attack on all the "government cover-ups" which include the Moon Landing, UFOs, Planet X or Nibiru, Area 51 and all kinds of other junk.    One important point is that the people behind these hoaxes actually know that their "proofs" are lies.  They don't care.  They just want to have the result.    Why?  There can be many reasons.  Most of them have to do with trying to keep the government from controlling their lives (nasty stuff like forcing them to follow the same laws as the rest of us, like having only one wife).    Some of them have created fake religions that can be easily debunked by science.  Therefore, it is important to make sure that their "disciples" don't believe science.    If, as a bonus, they can get a large number of people to also disbelieve science, then that gives them a bigger basin to recruit even more disciples.    In that respect, the internet and YouTube was a real "blessing".|`|YdGsp59kaa	Simply put:  the fervent desire to believe it was.    Hoax believers will put forth all kinds of nonsense "evidence" that purports to support their beliefs.  But they don't really understand the evidence, haven't really studied it, and can't defend it when real experts come calling.  The evidence they provide has nothing to do with why the decided to believe in a hoax.  The belief came first, and then they put a pseudo-intellectual veneer over it.    What it really comes down to, in most cases, is that hoax believers distrust and dislike authority -- especially government.  They believe that if they show malfeasance on the part of some arm of government, their paranoid world view will seem less crackpot.    EDIT:  I see we've accumulated two references to "Cosmic" Dave Cosnette's site.  A great portion of that site is simply copied from a book called "Dark Moon."  He has the authors' permission to use the matieral, but he won't defend it (because it's not his material) and the authors won't defend it either.    I'm currently debating "Cosmic" Dave.  His attitude is that he ought to be able to say whatever he wants, and that he just puts up stuff that's "interesting."  Dave really has no clue what he's talking about, and habitually evades, ducks, and dodges when people try to hold him accountable for the truthfulness of his claims.    In other words, his site is simply an example of the pseudo-intellectual veneer pasted over his deep-seated belief that world governments are covering up crucial information.|`|0ZnX6Qjyaa	paranoid people, there will always be conspiracies about everything|`|ivg0lRUraa	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apollo_moon...|`|110fda6e94f73c2bbaae8136ca9a20ddaa	I blame this entirely on our school system-- nothing is actually being taught there!

The main source of our electricity till date is a turbine which in turn can be powered by hydraullic pressure as in hydro power dams or steam pressure as in thermal and nuclear power plants where the heat energy is used to boil water.  This dynamo has a coil which rotates due to mechanical torque and produces a sinusoidal alternating current.    Direct current is available only from batteries or the Alternating is converted to DC using regualtors|`|6296beaabcf8f4682bfa047d500f8e9aaa	Alternating current loses less energy (to resistance) when transported through wires.  This is very important over long distances.    Generally P=I^2R  This means that when transmitting a fixed power on a given wire, if the current is doubled, the power loss will be four times greater.  Since the power transmitted is equal to the product of the current and the voltage, the same amount of power can be transmitted with a lower current by increasing the voltage. Therefore it is advantageous when transmitting large amounts of power to distribute the power with high voltages (often hundreds of kilovolts).  Using AC allows you to use higher voltages for a given power requirement.    Also, AC is much easier and cheaper to step up or down (change the voltage from kilovolts in powerlines to the hundred or two hundred in the home.)|`|MtFlPUyvaa	The advantage is that voltage of alternating currents can be easily altered by transformers.

YZAMZFKeaa	Tertiary carbocations are more stable (and form more readily) than secondary carbocations; primary carbocations are highly unstable because, while ionized higher-order carbons are stabilized by hyperconjugation, unsubstituted (primary) carbons are not. An exception to this occurs when there is a carbon-carbon double bond next to the ionized carbon. Such cations as allyl cation CH2=CH-CH2+ and benzyl cation C6H5-CH2+ are more stable than most other carbocations. Molecules which can form allyl or benzyl carbocations are especially reactive. So, except for cases such as these, the more substituted the center, the more stable a carbocation at that center will be.    Another factor is that alkyl groups are electron-donating, meaning that they release electrons into a reaction center and as such stabilize electron deficient centers such as carbocations...    Hope this helps!!!|`|157c840c4459e57440637f3fe001106caa	It is because of hyperconjugation with the neighbouring alkyl groups in the same way as it happens in alkenes. also, alkyl groups are a little electron repelling(+I effect), so they tend to decrease the positive charge on the carbocation, thus stabilising it.
YIimBqZPaa	Melatonin is the main hormone involved in controlling your circadian cycle, increasing during periods of darkness. It's produced by the pineal gland, which recieves light/dark information from the eyes via the suprachiasmic nucleus. It affects the central nervous system and causes drowsiness, among other functions. I think it's been marketed as some sort of sleeping aid for sufferers of jet lag.    But the initiation of sleep itself is caused by the decreased activity of the thalamus, which is kind of like a hub or nexus for all your higher brain functions. Once its firing rate decreases, it in turn decreases the background excitability of your brain...so you have to concentrate harder and harder to stay awake. Once your cerebral activity decreases past a certain threshold, you fall asleep.

I7clFYTZaa	Well it's difficult to answer with the information you provide. If you are doing a subjective sculpture, using subtractive technique (starting with a block and removing everything that doesn't look like the subject) I recommend Bass Wood. It's very stable (commonly used for picture framing) uniform and easy to work. Beech would be a very poor choice for this. It has a ropey grain and will be difficult to work as will hard woods like Walnut, Maple, Rosewood, and Ebony (few woods are harder than Ebony which is considered one of the "Iron Wood" species. I would also stay away from Poplar. It is very common now days because it grows fast. As a result of the rapid growth there is a lot of stress in the timber so it is not stable. If you are making an abstract sculpture that does not require a lot of shaping use whatever wood strikes your fancy. Use a lot of different woods. However, it can be difficult to find quality timbers to work with. The big lumber stores rarely stock anything except cheap lumber used by the construction trade. I have my sources but I don't know where you are. Ask around of the local cabinet makers. You also might want to get yourself a copy of Bruce Hoadly's "Understanding Wood".It's an excellent book and will tell you anything you might want to know about wood.

z7BiMSWmaa	Step 1: Photosystems  The light-dependent portion of photosynthesis is carried out by two consecutive photosystems (photosystem I and photosystem II) in the thylakoid membrane of the chloroplasts. The photosystems are driven by the excited chlorophyll molecules.    To begin photosynthesis, the chlorophyll molecule in photosystem II is excited by sunlight and the energy produced helps to break down a water molecule (H2O) into ?O2 (with electrons removed) and 2H+. The removed electrons are excited by the light energy. When the electrons prepare to come to their rest state, they go through an oxidative phosphorylation process and produces an ATP molecule.     As the electrons are coming to a resting state, they are excited again in photosystem I and raised to a even higher energy state. The excited electrons are then used to produce NADP+ + H+. The highly energetic NADPH molecule is then fed into the Calvin Cycle to conduct carbon fixation.    Step 2: Calvin Cycle  The second stage of photosynthesis, which takes place in the stroma of the chloroplast, can occur without the presence of sunlight. In this stage, known as the Calvin Cycle, carbon molecules from CO2 are fixed into glucose (C6H12O2). The reactions of the Calvin Cycle is as follows:          1. A five-carbon sugar molecule called ribulose bisphosphate, or RuBP, is the acceptor that binds CO2 dissolved in the stroma. This process, called CO2 fixation, is catalyzed by the enzyme RuBP carboxylase, forming an unstable six-carbon molecule. This molecule quickly breaks down to give two molecules of the three-carbon 3-phosphoglycerate (3PG), also called phosphoglyceric acid (PGA).     2. The two 3PG molecules are converted into glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate (G3P, a.k.a. phosphoglyceraldehyde, PGAL) molecules, a three-carbon sugar phosphate, by adding a high-energy phosphate group from ATP, then breaking the phosphate bond and adding hydrogen from NADPH + H+.     3. Three turns of the cycle, using three molecules of CO2, produces six molecules of G3P. However, only one of the six molecules exits the cycle as an output, while the remaining five enter a complex process that regenerates more RuBP to continue the cycle. Two molecules of G3P, produced by a total of six turns of the cycle, combine to form one molecule of glucose.     Diagrams in links.

ACEI (enalapril) helps to reduce proteinuria, retard the progression of renal failure (by decreasing hydrostatic pressure across glomerular capillaries). Use of cyclosporine is controversial.

Good luck|`|AA10579309	Diabetic kidney disease and alport syndrome have a common feature in that they attack the glomeruli of the kidneys.  Glomeruli are the little structures where water and substances from your blood are filtered into your urine.    The blood supply of a glomerulus consists of an arteriole (small artery) going in, and one coming out.  Your body regulates how much fluid goes into your urine by constricting or dilating these two blood vessels.    What ACE inhibitors do, is that they block the formation of angiotensin II.  Angiotensin II normally constricts the blood vessel coming out of the glomerulus, which makes the kidneys have to do more work by processing all of the fluid that passes into your renal tubules.  ACE inhibitors stop this effect, and basically reduce the workload on the kidney.|`|29ZL58Xjaa	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alport_synd...  http://emedicine.medscape.com/article/23...  http://www.alportsyndrome.org/  http://home.utah.edu/~cla6202/ASHP.htm  http://www.kidney.ca/page.asp?intNodeID=...  http://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/condition=alports...  http://www.kidney.org/ATOZ/atozItem.cfm?...  http://www.drugs.com/pro/enalapril.html  http://chealth.canoe.ca/drug_info_detail...  http://www.pharmgkb.org/do/serve?objId=P...

157c840c4459e57440637f3fe001106caa	First of all, cassettes are not magnetic tapes. i don't know about credit cards.  secondly, they are not mass magnetic. it is just like they use electromagnetism to store information but the summation is non-magnetic.  its just like a current carrying wire carries no charge.  and yeah in presence of strong magnetic fields, any magnetic tape or ATM card's information may be destroyed or atleast disrupted.  cassettes are not magnetic and if credit cards are fine after your treatment, they must be non-magnetic too.|`|524f656a521cc9375efb6821b1b2063daa	Either you were lucky, or your magnet was not very powerful.    A very good way of erasing cassettes in a secure way is to put them in a rapidly changing magnetic field.  Not only are they erased, but the magnetic domains in the ferromagnetic medium (covering the plastic support and held by wax or varnish-type compound) are realigned in a manner that has nothing to do with the previous information.    Credit cards are the same.    However, since we are now surrounded my (weaker) magnetic fields from all kinds of equipment, the manufacturers of tapes and strips have made a medium that resists being scrambled by the weaker fields (they use a combination of larger magnetic domains and redundancy of information), so that even if there is partial scrambling, the "scrambled information" still carries some of the information (hopefully, enough to rebuild the data).    Also, many cards now duplicate the information in a different manner on the card itself, (e.g., smart tags and chips) so that a modern scanner can look for the info in three different ways.    ---    I am assuming that you are talking about cassettes that we (old-timers) use for music: they DO contain a tape (covered by some ferro-magnetic dust) that stores the information magnetically.  And the credit cards with the magnetic strips (still extensively used in North America -- the rest of the planet have moved to smart chips a long time ago).|`|AA11436381	I think in the tapes (maybe some kind of cellophane) when the info is recorded to the tape the recording device aligns particle's or something.

TZCzjpGmaa	Due to snow's excellent insulating properties, inhabited igloos are surprisingly comfortable and warm inside. In some cases a single block of ice is inserted to allow light into the igloo.  When used to refer to a snowhouse an igloo is a shelter constructed from blocks of snow, generally in the form of a dome. Although igloos are usually associated with all Inuit, they were predominantly constructed by people of Canada's Central Arctic and Greenland's Thule area. Other Inuit people tended to use snow to insulate their houses which consisted of whalebone and hides. Snow was used because the air pockets trapped in it make it an insulator. On the outside, temperatures may be as low as -45 C (-49.0 F), but on the inside the temperature may range from -7 C (19 F) to 16 C (61 F) when warmed by body heat alone.|`|J6TmcHgDaa	The most important thing is that they block the wind.

n0pUrcotaa	If astrophotography is a primary goal, I suggest taking a different direction.    The most important part of a system for imaging is the mount.  You want an equatorial mount that will be as stable as possible while supporting the optical tube with the added weight of a camera.      Generally, when a mount is sold as a package with an optical tube, it's going to be OK for visual use but marginal for imaging.  Visually, if you've got a little vibration from a breeze, you can just wait until it stops or slows to the point where you can enjoy the view.  With a camera, the photo will be ruined.    The conventional wisdom is when choosing a mount for imaging, look for one rated to support twice the weight of the equipment you intend to use.  Deep Sky Imaging with a lesser mount won't be impossible, but it's apt to be frustrating.    At the more affordable end of the spectrum, I'd look at the Orion Atlas or Sirius mounts.    For the optical tube, I'd go with something along the lines of a 6" or 8" newtonian with a short F ratio that was designed for imaging.  Orion has some options.      Newtonians offer the most bang for the buck.    The reason I suggest a short f ratio (F8 or less) is a shorter focal length will be more forgiving of minor tracking errors than a longer one.    A GPS attachment on a mount will make aligning it at the start of the night a little easier but would have no impact on the quality of images you'd take.  All it does is tell the computer inside the mount where it's located.    Here's a link to some of my deep sky images:    http://www.picturetrail.com/sfx/album/vi... >|`|f1beDbKIaa	I like to dabble in what i call "shoe string" astrophography.  This is astrophotography with bits of string and anything else hanging around the house.  It's not very Sirius.    Some of my accomplishments are:    1. In 1997, i put a web cam on a tripod, and leaned against the eyepiece of a 22x60 spotting scope.  The whole thing was pointed out of my window (the web cam had to be within 6 feet of my 386 desktop computer).  I got 120 shots of comet Hale Bopp, despite the heavy light pollution of downtown Philadelphia.  I didn't know that you really needed to subtract out a dark frame. But i was able to construct a dark frame from the images.  And subtracting this from the images revealed two 7th magnitude stars (as well as the comet).  Not bad for downtown Philly.    2. I hand held a digital point an shoot camera to the eyepiece of a 10 inch Dob.  Over the course of a half hour, i took about 120 pictures.  I'm manhandling both the Dob and the camera, and trying to push the shutter button.  Most of the pictures were garbage.  But two or three were very sharp and clear. I have Jupiter, Saturn and Venus pictures like this.    3. When we had a transit of Venus, i didn't have a solar filter.  So i taped a couple sheets of white paper to a notebook and used eyepiece projection with the 22x60.  I had someone hold the notebook steady while i took a dozen shots of the image projected onto the paper.  A couple turned out very nice.  I repeated this for a transit of Mercury.    4. I've got a Rube-Goldberg device that clamps to an eyepiece and holds a light camera near it.  It bounces around alot if you touch it, and you have to touch it to take an image. The workaround is to use the 10 second delay on the camera to allow it to settle after pushing to shutter button. My new point and shoot digital camera has exposure control, and can do 8 second exposures.  But the sky moves too much in that time for my dob, right?  But Polaris doesn't.  And Polaris is a double star.  I used my 120x eyepiece with my 2x barlow, zoomed the camera to max and shot a dozen pictures.  About half of them show 9th magnitude Polaris B, and the best show it clear enough to see diffraction spikes from my secondary spider, and even a little movement.    But real astrophotography is expensive.  You need a really stable mount.  You need a tracking drive that tracks smoothly.  You need really good focus, like an automatic focuser.  You need a tracking drive that can take corrections from a tracking camera.  Some of the best shots i've seen use narrow band filters.  I figure a minimum setup is something like $9000.  So you either need to adjust your expectations to fit your budget, or increase your budget.  The only cheap part of the deal is the telescope itself.  Most telescope optics are good.  And i've seen excellent results from an 85 mm APO refractor.  The deal is that small scopes are lighter and a cheaper mount can be used.    There are support groups for astrophotographers.  I mean, it's an addiction, needing a 12 step program and everything.  Many clubs offer such services.|`|Tiph3lQcaa	Parkus -    Please read my response to your earlier question. This scope is more appropriate than the ETX125, but if you do not know where the Veil Nebula is or how it moves across the summer sky, you may have difficulty keeping the image centered for 45 minutes. In fact, you may have trouble keeping it in the eyepiece for 5 minutes.    The system is only as accurate as the observer. If you think the computer is going to do all of this for you, you are in for a rude awakening, followed by a trip to the equipment auction.     Serious astrophotography (which is what you are considering with 45 minute exposure times) requires a thorough understanding of the night sky, a really solid telescope, an observer that is very comfortable with its use, and long hours spent in less than ideal conditions.    Best of Luck. I mean that sincerely.
spBnMPzFaa	Do not discount what other engineers know, we know about other engineers.  A civil engineer would provide the best answer.    waves have amplitude and frequency.  Earthquakes have p-waves and s-waves.  wind also causes building to sway which would be a wave.  The height of a building will have a different effect from a wave.  Impact loads also cause waves to vibrate through structure.  only structural civil engineers would analyze these waves.

Evolutionary changes are NTt caused by the environment, they are caused by random chance, and thus cannot be predicted.    For example, we consider the famous Camouflaged Moth example (which has since been shown to be false).  The Moth supposedly changed color according to the color of the trees around it.   This then assume that the color of the tree somehow modified the genetic code of the moth!  Totally impossible!      [In fact, this example was later admitted to be "faked".  the photographer, in his greed to "make his point", actually posed the photograph using a properly colored moth against the required tree.  it was later shown that the moths colors were already a genetic possibility. That color scheme already existed, but was not common in that moth variety.  There was no genetic mutation in the moth, and this example was NOT evolution.]    Predicting the evolutionary outcomes is NOT possible, because we cannot predict if or when the necessary genetic mutations might or might not occur.|`|CuOMzfRdaa	I reckon the african greys and ectalectus (incredicbiley smart birds) will grow to be extremely smart because everyday they are being taught another language put in new enviroments and put an most other smart animals (humans) one particular african grey has been taught 1000 different words, also i think they will evolve hands because there wings are always being clipped and then they will evolve a hip joint allowing them to run and then they would have no need for feathers so their feathers would evolve into hair.|`|ucxfU7pTaa	london17 1800s 10 % moths were black 50 years later 90% were black so much coal was burned it turned tree black where the moths hid from pred.same species|`|F5GyrdQfaa	Too simplistic. You have to ask about these adaptations in reaction to environmental stimuli. Also, you must remember that coloration, limb length, etc is not exactly a matter of external circumstances. Look at all the humans today, and tell me which one 'evolves' into the future. Also, individuals of many differing traits can generally inhabit a single gene pool, and it is only with change to external circumstance that a particular "look" becomes more successful than others.     With this in mind, I think ALL wild creatures on earth are going to get smaller, due to shrinking habitats. I also think future scientists are going to be surprised to know that not all birds are descended from pidgeons...which are doing exceptionally well in our mostly predator-free cities.
ICx6McGJaa	The evolution of the horse involves the gradual development of the modern horse from the fox-sized, forest-dwelling Hyracotherium.     The early ancestors of the modern horse walked on several spread-out toes, an accommodation to life spent walking on the soft, moist grounds of primeval forests. As grass species began to appear and flourish, the equids' diets shifted from foliage to grasses, leading to larger and more durable teeth. At the same time, as the steppes began to appear, the horse's predecessors needed to be capable of greater speeds in order to outrun predators. This was attained through the lengthening of limbs and the lifting of some toes from the ground in such a way that the weight of the body was gradually placed on one of the longest toes, the third.|`|wU7IHRvdaa	I've heard that rattlesnakes are evolving to not rattle.

Since they observed the same universe as we do, they saw the same things.    Like the Greek and Babylonians did, they compiled information from other, previous cultures, so that they had information that they would not have found by themselves.    Our astronomical terms come from the Greek mythology (Latinized because scientists wrote in Latin -- regardless of their mother tongue -- during the Renaissance).    The astronomy that we "use" today is modern.  We rely on observations and discovery we make today.  It is only the vocabulary that comes from one ancient civilization, rather than another.|`|QKO4f5q0aa	It was precise for the time.    It was based on naked-eye observations, and so was limited in comparison to modern astronomy.   The Vedic astronomers had different constellations than we do (Western / modern astronomy relies primarily on Greco-Roman constellations)     There are clues that Vedic astronomers as early as 8th or 9th century BCE thought that the solar system was heliocentric.  They had calculated the Sun's size to be 108 times that of the Earth and Moon (which is pretty close).    As far as being 'accurate', they defined their solar years the same way we do, based on solstices and equinoxes.  Their year was subject to a correction every 5 years, and additionally the priests could 'correct' the calendar as it went along.  The purpose of Vedic Astronomy was to chart the position of the Moon and the naked-eye planets in order to plan religious rituals.      There is no evidence that I've seen that they understood the larger structure of the universe.

However as a common technique for evaluating whether or not an infinite series converges is to apply the Ratio Test    Given a sequence (a(n) , n = (0/-inf) to (0/inf)) (obviously not 0 to 0)  Then the sequence will converge if    lim (n--> inf) ( | a(n+1)/a(n) | )     if this limit is greater than 1 the series diverges and if equal to 1, the test has failed and nothing can be said about its convergence or divergence.  In that instance, there are a few other techniques that can be used to ascertain the behaviour of the sequence, however the  Ratio test is always a good start    Hope this helps,    David

d014f113fb3eecfed19b0fbba5d885d9aa	There are many books and references that could be used here -     First of all look up the Central Limit Theme - this states that over time, things tend to appear normally distributed or "the Standard Normal Distribution."    A fun example would be to take any coin.  Flip it one hundred times and record the out come.  The wait a day and do it again.  Do this five days (or times) and record the results.  To show more variation, you could use a pair of dice.  Role them 100 times for five to seven times and record on a histogram what you find.    Applying this to quality assurance:  once you understand that the only way that a value would fall out of the standard normal distribution (this usually starts at plus/minus 3 sigmas {standard deviations} is for something to have changed.    So in the coin or dice trials, you change something about how you are throwing or rolling the dice or how they are landing.    So in any office or manufacturing setting, if we are monitoring the process or results of something (called a process), and the measure moves outside the plus/minus 3 standard deviations (called control limits in statistical process control) then we know that something has probably (at a 98.6% likelihood) changed.  This gives us the opportunity to stop the process and identify what changed.      If it is a good change, then make it part of the process for future results.  If it is a bad change, then fix the process.    In one of many cases that I am aware of: a machine operator what using this method to monitor a large lath operation.  At the end of his shift, he cleaned up and when home.  There were no other operators working on that machine over night.  The next morning as the operator started the machine up again, the readings/measures were out-side of the control limits (the plus/minus 3 standard deviations).      He shut down the machine and called his supervisor who called the engineers who called the quality department.  During the following meetings as everyone was looking over the machine to see if they could find the cause.  One of the forklift operators when by the machine and asked what was going on.  After he was told about the parts not being exactly where the had been the day before, the forklift operator admitted that he had "lightly" bumped the machine while moving a large pallet the night before.    The engineers and quality people looked at the machine for alignment and found that the "light" bump had in fact changed the alignment of the machine.  Corrections where made without any bad parts being shipped from the plant due to this issue.      I have personally use the basic standard normal distribution to help solve problems and prevent problems from occurring many times over the past 20 years.    This can actually be a lot of fun as you use statistics to help solve problems that other people spend a lot more time to attempt to identify where issues are occurring.    You can contact the American Society for Quality to find many books and references or to talk with people about this and other related concepts.
ossCVxPqaa	This is frequently seen in organic chemistry. The empirical formula is the atoms in the chemical formula reduced to their lowest whole numbers. The molecular formula tells you what the compound is.  You are given some information about the % composition of an organic compound, or some reaction of the compound that enables you to determine that the ratio of C:H:O is 1:2:1 . From this you write an empirical formula CH2O. The question then asks you to name the compound, or to give its molecular formula. Now you can be very happy because CH2O is methanal or in old terminology, formaldehyde. Is this the correct answer to the question?    What about a compound with the same ratio but C2H4O2 which is better written, CH3COOH which is ethanoic acid or acetic acid? The ratio of C:H:O is still 1:2:1when reduced to the lowest numbers.    From the empirical formula you are unable to name the compound. You need further information: What is the molecular formula if the molar mass is 30g/mol, or 60g/mol? Now you can determine the molecular formula, 30g/mol = CH2O = 12 + 2+ 16 = 30, or 60g/mol , which is CH3COOH = 24+4+32 = 60g/mol.|`|evYWKtSJaa	Empirical is just the simplest version of the formula and the molecular has everything  this is sort of a example  2CO2 which would be two CO2 but empirical would be CO4 because you just simplify and get the four  Hope that helps

Draw a diagram.  Now add three lines connecting the three centers of the circles.  The interior of this triangle made up of four parts: one sector from each of the three circles, surrounding the empty area that we want to find.      You're given the circle areas, so use A =  r^2 to find the radii of each of the circles.  One you have these, you can find the lengths of the 3 sides of the triangle.  Now that you have the triangle lengths, use the Law of Cosines to get one of the angles of the triangle, then Law of Sines to find the other two angles.    We can find the empty area by taking the area of the triangle, then subtracting the area of the three circular sectors.  You can find the area of the triangle using the three side lengths.

KJHw0oI3aa	I assume that you are talking about the mixture of brown gas nitrogen dioxide and colorless gas dinitrogen tetroxide.  The equation representing the reversible reaction is the following:    2 NO2  N2O4    According to Le Chatelier's principle, when the system at equilibrium is subjected to a stress, the system reacts by shifting in such a way as to relieve the effects of the stress.  The pressure of the gas depends on the number of molecules present in the containter.  According to the above equation, when 2 molecules of NO2 change to one molecule of N2O4, less molecules are formed and the pressure decreases.  When the pressure is applied to this system at equilibrium, it tends to relieve the pressure by shifting to the right.  As a result, when new equilibrium is established, there will be fewer molecules of NO2, and more molecules of N2O4, or less molecules than before decreasing the pressure.  Since NO2 is brown, and N2O4 is colorless, the mixture will now be of lighter in color, since it now contains fewer brown molecules than before.    If the number of molecules of gases were the same on both sides of the equation, increasing (or decreasing) the pressure would have no effect on the system.

xopIi2Vfaa	When an apple is cut (or bruised), oxygen is introduced into the injured plant tissue. When oxygen is present in cells, polyphenol oxidase (PPO) enzymes in the chloroplasts rapidly oxidize phenolic compounds naturally present in the apple tissues to o-quinones, colorless precursors to brown-colored secondary products. O-quinones then produce the well documented brown color by reacting to form compounds with amino acids or proteins, or they self-assemble to make polymers.|`|bQ36mdBdaa	Apples contain iron.

IjUqYbIxaa	CaCl2 (s) is an ionic solid.  CO2 (s) is a molecular solid.  Ni (s) is an atomic solid.  I2 is a molecular solid.|`|KJHw0oI3aa	CaCl2 is an ionic solid.  You can usually recognize an ionic solid by the presence of a metal (calcium in this case).  Ionic solids are made up of positive and negative particles called ions.    CO2 is a molecular solid.  Molecular solids are made up of molecules, groups of atoms sharing electrons with each other.  It is easy to recognize a molecular solid because they are usually made up of nonmetals alone.    Ni is a metallic solid.  It is made up of nickel atoms that are metallically bonded.  Since the smallest unit of nickel is one atom, you could call it an atomic solid.    I2 is a molecular solid made up of diatomic molecules of iodine.  Again, iodine is a nonmetal, and its atoms share electrons with other iodine atoms.

5tCxbKg8aa	I think that we study VLSI layouts because we can not fabricate the spreading semiconductor devices without making this design. Some semiconductor devices as you see from the VLSI layouts is constructed from more than a transistor for example. A good design will lead to a good final product. 
ljen1oasaa	The reason for stick diagram encoding is to capture the mask topology of a circuit without actually doing the mask layout. Others can weigh in on this, but I've only actually seen stick diagrams used in classroom texts. (Pucknell & Eshraghian) etc. So I believe that they are more of a teaching aid and too oversimplified to be used in an industry setting. Anyway, in almost 20 years of design and fabrication I've never seen one used to actually do layout estimation, as most layout tools will automatically create a layout from the circuit description and design rules.

Wires are used to bear mechanical loads and to carry electricity and telecommunications signals. Standard sizes are determined by various wire gauges.

IIGvtAT2aa	"infinity" x "zero" ... as a limit is an indeterminate limit . This means that there are infinitely many possibilities for the answer.      Example:    lim (1/(x+1)) *  (5x+2) as x  the first factor goes to zero  while the second factor goes to infinity    lim (5x+2)/(x+1)   = lim 5/1 = 5 using L'Hopital's rule.      now  lim (1/(2x^2 + 1))  (6x^2 + 5)  = lim (6x^2 + 5)/ (2x^2 + 1)  = lim (12x)/(4x)  = 3    thus depending on the nature of both the numerator and the denominator ...   or in other words, on the nature of the expressions going to zero and infinity, then the answer can be anything. (even zero or infinity).|`|VLT2VgP9aa	You really can't use infinity in regular arithmetic that way.  At least, not in the real numbers.  In non-standard analysis, there are alternate number systems, such as the hyperreal numbers, where both infinite and infinitesimal values exist.  However, even then you have to be careful with how you operate with them.    For the purposes of probability theory, an infinitesimal probability is the same thing a zero probability.  This is why we consider the probability on intervals rather than countable sets when dealing with continuous random variables.

AA10927246	The maximum volume of a box with the minimum surface is when it is a perfect cube.    10 cm x 10 cm x 10 cm = 1000 cm^3    Answer:  10 cm on each side    If you want to prove this using calculus, you would do it as follows:    Let x be the height of the box.  The s be the length of each side of the square base.    x * s * s = 1000    s2 = 1000/x  s = (1000/x)    The four sides will be x * s = x(1000/x)  The top and bottom will be s * s = 1000/x    A function for the surface area will be:  f(x) = 4x(1000/x) + 2(1000/x)    f(x) = 41000 * x/x + 2000/x  f(x) = 4010 * x + 2000/x  f(x) = 4010 * x^? + 2000 * x^(-1)    Take the derivative:  f'(x) = 4010 * ?x(-?) + -2000 * x^(-2)  f'(x) = 2010 / x - 2000 / x2    Set this to zero:  0 = 2010 / x - 2000 / x2  2000/x2 = 2010 / x    Cross multiply:  (2010)x2 = 2000*x    10 x2 = 100x    Square both sides:  10x^4 = 10000x  x^4 = 1000x  x^4 - 1000x = 0  x(x^3 - 1000) = 0    This means we have two potential solutions:  x = 0 or x = 10    Obviously x = 0 isn't a solution because you could never contain 1000 cm^3 in a box with height 0.    Answer:  x = 10 cm|`|Ne5I7Ranaa	Since it's square based, we know that its length and width are x, and its depth is y. This gives us a surface area of 2x^2+4xy. Since we know the volume equals 1000, we can say 1000=(x^2)*y, and solve for y to find that y = 1000/(x^2). Substituting this back into our equation for surface area, we find that the surface area equals 2x^2+4000/x. So, we take the derivative of this, and end up with 4x-4000/(x^2).    Since we are looking for the minimum surface area, we set 4x-4000/(x^2) equal to 0. Solve for x to get x=10. (This also means that y is 10, and our box is in fact a cube).
