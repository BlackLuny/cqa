What i want to know is, how can i tell if hes a boy or shes a girl or it  both (thats why i called it Turnip - quite an assexual name don't you think?), and if its both what triggers them to lay eggs and have babies cos every day i wake up expecting to find a colony of baby snails just waiting to be let loose in the garden of my next door neighbours who are horrible old gits and deserve to be driven out by snails for being horrible to live by.    Forget that last bit thats my head doing overtime, i just want to know if they are (they being the snails, not the old gits next door) - girls and boys or a bit of both, how i can tell, and whether i should expect that colony anytime soon.   Help?

20090225081438AAXVQ6m	Pets;Cats	A few questions for "Cat People"?	**Sorry this is a little long**      Ok- I'm not the biggest fan of cats- I've had a few bad experiences with cats/kittens (I've been bitten a lot, scratched, jumped on etc.) and frankly they scare the hell out of me. So my boyfriend and his roomate recently adopted one- her name is Tila, and shes 1 year old. She's very sweet and affectionate, but the problem is I can't sleep with her in the same room. She jumps on the bed and paces around my head and face and walks over my body and it scares me to death, despite the fact that she's purring like a motor boat and I know I should have no reason to fear her. It's been causing me to wake up whenever she decides to come in- and stay up for the rest of the day. So instead of getting up at 8ish, I've now been "forced" to get up at 4 or 5.       So my questions are:       1) am I honestly being a big baby? My boyfriend is not taking this seriously at all, he calls me a cry baby, tells me that my fear of cats is stupid and that even if she did hurt me it wouldnt be a big deal. He also refused to keep her outside of his room because she spends most of the night clawing and meowing at his door to get in. He says I'm selfish for wanting to leave her alone in the rest of the house.       2) Is there something effective I can do to keep her away from my head while sleeping? I wouldn't mind so much if she could curl up and go to sleep, but it's the pacing and walking all over me that I hate. My boyfriend pushes her (gently) away from me but she always comes back.          And also I had a few health questions-      I noticed Tila has a few semi-bald patches over her eyes, and one on her back. She seems to shed a lot, but since I've never had a cat I don't know if this is normal.       Also, one time she curled up and started stretching, but it turned more into shaking and her eyes rolled back a little and I really thought she was having a stroke. My boyfriend started petting her and she stopped shaking and then seemed fine. Is that normal?      When do cats become full grown? She's seems really small for a year old.      Thank you in advance. I know nothing about cats and my boyfriend and his roomate are, well, a little immature :-)

20090225082026AAgpHxf	Pets;Birds	Are my cockatiels mating?	I understand that when cockatiels mate then the male should mount the female then he shakes his tail feathers in order to get in the right position for copulation, however my in my pair the female mounts the male and undergoes this action. Are they still mating or is this a pair of really odd birds? Afterwards the female generally preens herself while the male goes on about business. The female has the bars on her tail feathers but this is only on 2 of the feathers with the rest being speckled on the underside. The males are white with faint yellow spots on them. I can only presume that I have them sexed correctly?

I would like to know how big a male and how big a female will get.    What age to buy them at and how big they should be at this age and others.   Whether it is better to get a male or female.    What sort of natures do they have.    How long do they live on average.    How big the enclosure should be and what it should be made of.    What I should be used for the floor.    What to feed them and how often.    Anything that should be in their enclosure.    How much water to give it. Do they bite much or hard?    This will be my first reptile-like pet.    I already have two dogs, three rabbits, four gerbils and two fish.    Is an iguana a good first reptile pet?    Is there another one that would be more suited to me?    I don't want a reptile that is a carnivore, just a herbivore.    Thanks, any good answers truly appreciated.

He does drink lots of water and has flakes of skin in his coat when I brush him.  He has had bad breath for years.  Aside from that, he doesn't exhibit any other symptoms of chronic renal failure that's suggested on websites (he's not lethargic, doesn't have a loss of appetite..he does puke sometimes, but so does my other cat, I attribute it to them being cats).  I don't think he has CRF, but I do think whatever he has should be addressed.        I currently feed him sensitive stomach cat food because of the puking.  Last time I took him to the vet's office it was recommended that I switch him to a low-protein food, but I've done some reading on this and have found sites that say this isn't always the solution.      What can I do to make his body happier?  Is there cat food out there specially formulated for hydration, or proteins that are easier to digest?  No guesses please, looking for experienced answers.  ty

Back in February, I rescued a beautiful young red-nose female from an    idiot associate of mine that got her from....well, heaven knows. Her her was heartbroken when Mom got tired of of the dog. It took almost 10 months for the ASPCA to find her a home. The family that got her are THRILLED.      Long story short, this idiot allowed someone to give her daughter abother pup for a birthday gift. He is a three month old, chocolate/white pitbull. I can see the writing on the wall, and I have already made up my mind that when the idiot grows "tired of it" this time that I want this little boy. If she doesn't get him neutered, I definitely will before he comes to my home.       Now, my  pit is almost 5 (rescued as a baby), and has always been the only dog in the house. What are everyones / anyones thoughts on having two neutered males in the same home. My dog has met this pup a couple of times. Will continued socialization between the two of them help? Or should I just plan on trying to re-home him.       FYI: My dog is WELL taken care of, with regular vet checks, shots, excercise, and love.  This addition to my home would be no different.

I asked if that dog got loose again and Torie(my sister's friend) said really rudely YEAH GO GET HIM!! So I told her "its not my dog so im not getting him" (but I ended up going anyway) after I said that she's like YOU WANT TO BE A VET SO GO GET THE DAMN DOG!!! Then after I returned the dog. I was going into my house and Torie was like Oh and by the way Your NOT getting your puppy soon, your mom said that your not getting it until your 14th B-day. (which is a complete lie because my parents and I agreed that I am getting my puppy in 5 months.) Well I told her " I know when im getting my dog and you don't so shut up!!" Oh and before every time I brought up the subject of my puppy and what kind im getting she's like "NO YOUR NOT GETTING A COCKER SPANIEL YOUR GETTING A BORDER COLLIE OR A JACK RUSSELL!!" I tell her a million times that Im only allowed to get a small dog so I can't get a border collie and I don't want a really really hyper dog like a jack russell and everytime I talk about like the dog breeds I want ( for example a dachshund) she says EWWW YOU CHOOSE ALL THE UGLY ONES!! Well sorry for going on and on. But my question is how can I get her to stop choosing the dog breeds for me? And no matter how much I argue with her she still wins. Please help!! Thanks

20081116155858AARpqiv	Pets;Dogs	Is This Animal Cruelty ?	Hi,    I just volunteered for the SPCA and they have very nice staffs. At our shelter we have an officer inspecter. I've know this petstore that sells dogs, budgies, hamsters (i think), bunnies and a lovebird.       You see, it says " No Photographs " and I understand that, but I broke the rules for a purpose. The shih tzu puppy was stuck in a metal cage no bigger for it to take 3 steps and back, and the cage is probably only maybe 4 inches taller than the puppy itself. They don't have any toys or towels/blankets, and walk and sleep on the metal bars beneath them...Oh, and they have a rabbit water bottle to drink out of..that is attached to the cage. Then they have around 5 bunnies in one average home bunny cage and they're wee tiny bunnies, for sale... $85 bucks. I'm not as concerned about the bunnies as I am for dogs though. Their budgies are crammed in a hamster like cage, only taller. The cage length's is bigger that it's width...      Now, their lovebird is stuck in a small budgie cage...they also have aquatics, which to mee seems fine. When I asked the man who worked there how much the dogs were...he said he didn't know and for me to ask the lady in the flowered shirt. When i asked her she was like " The shih tzu is 1200, and the Lhasa Apso Mix is 950 "       (canadian dollars)       Redicolous? Of course.    So is this considered as animal cruelty?       I have the pictures on my dad's cell phone..since it was they only way to get some shots. The thing is, we just moved so he lost his cord for transfering files. We're searching for it now, but I am so very concerned. Should I report it as animal cruelty?       I already talked to the inspecter and she said she would like to see any proof first. So here I am with the pictures.       However, I would love to hear your opinion on this. Would you categorize this as animal cruelty ?       Thank you !

A little about this kitten:   Male kitten, 8 weeks old, Grey Tiger Stripe,  Very courageous and fearless lil guy!!  Full of energy but he's a lover too!  We have other animals and he just absolutely loves chasing their tails around!      We're looking for a name for him that isn't a "people name" and isn't something cutesy like "tiger" or "stripe"....  Any thoughts or idea's for a creative name?      Thanks in advance for your help!    Ohh and here's his picture if that might help!!    http://i37.photobucket.com/albums/e75/re... 
20081021160022AAEMplQ	Pets;Dogs	One of my dogs keeps attacking the other one.?	I have two dogs who are both the same breed. One is young, a little over a year, and the other is around six or seven.

20081029003638AAB9qVG	Pets;Cats	How to punish an 8 week old kitten?	Before you cat freaks come on and scold for how horrible it is to punish a kitten, read on.      She's 8 weeks old, we just got her. We have toys and a box for her to play with when we aren't playing with her. (which we do frequently).      Our room that we all chill in together (me, my husband, and our two bunnies) has not been kitten proofed, as we are still new home owners and have not got everything organized.      We have a corner of wires that I threw a towel over so she could not chew or play with them, but she insists on going in that corner anyways. Or, another situation, there is an area behind the rabbit cages that is blocked off because we don't want the animals back there. But, being a cat, she jumps over. She jumps on the cages where I'm afraid she'll hurt herself if her legs fall through.      I don't want to spray her, and get electrical cords wet, so what is a way to teach a kitten "NO"? I've been simply picking her up, stating "No" in a scolding voice (not yelling) and setting her by her toys. She thinks it's a game.      Love her to death, she's very intelligent and already litter trained, but she is getting unruly.      So, how can I teach her acceptable behavior? (such as not eating our fingers)
20081017054504AAc9lhP	Pets;Other - Pets	What should I name my bunny?	I am struck for a name. I want to name it something to do with her evil eyes. She has a brown line over each eye that looks like menacing eyebrows, and she has the amazing ability to scare the crap out of my dog when he chases her simply by throwing her ears back and giving him an evil stare. He runs crying. Here is a picture of her. She also has what looks like a beauty mark on one cheek.       http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v239/s...       And here is of the dog that wusses out at her evil eye.    http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v239/s...       No names like "evil eye" or "gaze" or something simple like that. I was thinking Medusa, but she was more known for the snake hair. Someone suggested Groucho marx, but he's not a menacing guy. Are there goddess's or gods known for  their evil eyes?

20080929191844AAV0fM2	Pets;Fish	Can the fins and color of a betta fish improve?	I bought a betta fish today at the pet store not knowing anything about them. I have been doing some research online and it seems the poor little guy isn't in optimal condition. He's small, pretty dull color with hints of red, his fins are skinny and a little tattered looking with 1 hole the size of a pin prick. Other than that, he doesn't look sick or have anything growing on him.      Will the betta's fins regenerate and get more colorful if I keep it healthy from now on?       Also, he is currently in a glass vase about 6" diameter. What's the best way to get him into a tank?

20081101030426AAYUQAV	Pets;Dogs	I day trade and the stress, though I try to hide it causes my dog to urinate uncontrolable at different times!?	Because of the reaction to my stress, what can I do to stop my one year old dog from urinating and sometimes more in our home.  She does not do any thing like that when the market is smooth or the direction of the market is going my way so I know this is the problem.      An example: (The market was and has been especially stressful for quite some time now) however I was being extra sweet with her last evening, put her on the sofa with me (which is rare with my wife or me although our dog loves to be there), she was setting perfectly still and when I picked her up she had fully urinated all over where she was setting.  We didn't punish her, just set her out on the balcony.  We live up high so we cannot take her down to the park quick enough when something like that happens.  As for taking her for her walks, normally we take her out around 7:30 to 8:30 in the morning and 5:00 to 6:30 in the evening, each outing is anywhere from 30 minutes but more likely an hour to an hour and a half.  We also travel a lot sometimes up to a month, leave her in the same kennel she was born in, (the people are extremely nice to her), each time when we return she seems to have enjoyed the stay, she does very well for about a week then she starts this sort of thing all over again. Of course I cannot stop my day-trading so how can we solve this problem?      Thanks,      David  
20081105175021AAAuEzw	Pets;Dogs	My 15 week old puppy still pee's everywhere! Can someone give me some ideas?	So we got our border collie puppy at 8 weeks old. We had him pretty much potty trained by 12 weeks (always stood by the door) when he had to go poop or pee, now at 15 weeks its like everything that we taught him about peeing in the house is thrown out the door. He still stands by the door and barks to go poop but feels he can pee wherever he wants. I take him out everytime he gets up from a nap, after he eats and pretty much every hour and sometimes he will go outside and sometimes he wont.    Yesterday I was getting dressed and he sat on the bed and instantly peed and then today he jumped on the couch and instantly peed. At first I thought is was for attention but I give him a lot of attention and I'm not sure what I'm doing wrong. At this point its so frustrating because I have talked to people that say he should be trained by now. We never used the pee pads just always brought him outside when he went in the house, which we still do. It just seems like he almost got it and now took five steps back. I have the pee spray which i spray every time he pees in the house but nothing is working. I love the little guy but is this going to stop soon? Any new ideas on what I can do? Please help!   Thanks.

My daschund was just paralyzed a little over a month ago from either jumping up and down or something like that. I had Just bought him a girlfriend so I could breed them, I made him a home made wheelchair it works perfect, but my vet is not good with communicating with me about how long he will be like this. It does not bother me carring him around all the tim just the fact that he is incontinent! He can not wear diapers he drags them off, now he has torn his back legs up from dragging them. Yesterday I seen that he has a big blood blister on his back foot from the dragging or something, My grand maw had the idea to put a baby onesie on him to help keep his legs safe, I also put neosporen and gauze and wrapped them up with tape. I didn't know what else would go wrong until my little female became "in heat" for the first time! Now my dasch is hopping around for her and whining all day long! Does anyone know anything about this situation at all? If you have ANYTHING it would be greatly appreciated!! that you so much

20090227125219AAwOoIU	Pets;Dogs	Lung cancer in dogs and what to watch for?	This is very difficult to ask so only sincere answers please.   One of my Flat Coats has been sick for a while and I was already nervous about the outcome of the cyst I had removed from him, especially after another appeared causing me to bring him back to the vet.   An x-ray was done of his chest and it turned out that he has lung cancer.   I asked the vet what would be the signs to look for to know when the end was getting close as his breathing is already quite deep.   I don`t want him to suffer and he is not displaying any signs of pain and still is quite spry still at times.   The vet said that I will know, and left in tears as he has known him all his life.   This all made me fall apart as well as he is such a special dog.   I watched him last night laying down and it almost seemed as though he could not fall asleep. His eye`s kept opening and i was wondering if he could not fall asleep because he was in pain, I just don`t know.   Cancer is quite predominate in Flat Coats and I have experienced my share of cancers in the breed.   So besides the labored breathing can anyone in the know tell me what I should be paying attention to as I have never lost a dog to lung cancer, and I want my boy to go with all the dignity he deserves.   God Bless

Sometimes a significant dent, but just a dent. I still find a flea on him occasionally.       So, I bought my cat Capstar and Program because people just rave about both on 1-800-Pet-Meds.       So, since it comes in tablet form, how do you give it to your cat? Do you crush and put it in food? Do you put it in the mouth and try to get the cat to swallow?      Any tips would be appreciated.      Also. does Capstar conflict with Advantage? I gave him Advantage about two weeks ago.

This does not make sense to me and i would like to know the logic behind it. Puppies are carnivores so puppy formula is made for a meat eating animal which squirrels are not. Therefore how would there stomachs be ale to digest this? I would like answers from people who have actually gone through some rehab classes or maybe a vet. Can you explain to me what was told to you on why and how this would be a good healthy thing to do. It would seem to me that you would want to give an animal that eats vegetation milk from another animal that eats vegetation not one that eats meat. There digestive systems are not the same.

20090227124946AAG1P95	Pets;Dogs	Question about my dog....?	So lastnight my dog out of nowhere starting limping on her left front leg.  She was playing like her usual self and seemed fine, she layed down afterwards, and when she got up she was limping.  I've seen her do it in the past, and after she walks or sleeps for a little while, it goes away.  But she went to bed lastnight and woke up still limping and it seems worse today, she doesn't seem to be in any pain though, she still tries to play (I wont let her though), and just seems like her usual self except with a limp.  Does anyone know what could be wrong with her?  Do you think she's in pain and just not showing it?  Is there anything that I can give her or do for her to help with the pain?  I will take her to the vet if needed, but I wanted to get some educated opinions first about what's wrong with her.  Thanks.      By the way, she's a 7 year old chocolate labrador retriever, she still plays and acts like she's 1 and has never showed any symptoms of arthritis so I really think she's pulled/torn something, any help deeply appreciated!

So I have a community tank with 4 tiger barbs, 2 pictus cats, an african dwarf frog and one painted glass fish (didn't know it was injected dye till after i bought him, i had 3 originally on their own but two died). Anyways, I know the glass fish should be in groups, but mine seems to thrive on his own and chases the tiger barbs around, i was wondering if this was common or if my glass fish is just a badass :)

20090306161357AAR4pEz	Pets;Cats	We think our cat is pregnant what should we do?	I think my 2 year old cat may be pregnant... Lately I have noticed that her belly is becoming very large and firm and she has been eating more than usual. When I mean her belly is becomming large I mean that she has a sort of barrel shape forming in her belly.  Her nipples have noticibly grown larger she is ALWAYS cleaning herself lately which I am not sure is a sign of pregnancy though?  I had placed my hand over the bottom of her belly and had felt a slight kick like movement a few times.        If my cat is pregnant I am worried because we are moving to a new apartment in the next week and I am unsure how she will do with the move and having kittens? She has never been pregnant before... We also have a schedule spay for her for next week...  Any suggestions? and does it sound like she may be pregnant?  Thanks so much!!

20090307011449AAhbcGS	Pets;Other - Pets	My bunny was just spayed. Now she has rash above incision because of licking. Should we use E collar?	The rash is not on the incision site, but we are worried that she might work her way to the incision site and do some damage to the sutures. She just had the procedure done on Tuesday, and has had a really rough time. She stopped eating, then had diarrhea, and is finally getting back to normal. I am worried that if we use the E collar she will not be able to eat or drink normally, and with her GI tract being so unstable, I'm not sure this is the best idea. But, on the other hand I don't want her to get an infection or for the rash to get worse. Any idea? Can we cover her stomach area somehow so she doesn't have to have an E collar? Is the rash something that needs to be checked out by the vet?
20090307012804AAw34lE	Pets;Dogs	My Dog is acting "WEIRD" .... Advice PLEASE !!!!?	One of my dogs Shiloh our beagle has been acting strange lately. Weve had her for 5 years and she has always been a well behaved do except for the barking and chasing people alongside the fence outside. Now she has begun chewing and ripping up clothing,shoes,paper towels .... Mostly at night. There have been NO Changes in the home whatsoever. Her last vet check about 3 months ago showed her to be in great health. We havent changed her food,routine or anything. Also last week she peed on my bedroom floor for no reason ... She is completly housebroken and in my opinion she seemed to do it on spite for some unknown reason. She has begun acting "Weird" for about 2 weeks. Any Ideas as to what could be going on ?? I love her Soo much and Im concerned. Thank you

20090307043437AAdGZAM	Pets;Cats	Cat clawing the couch?	I have a problem with my 1 yr old male cat. Everytime I pull into the drive way I see him go staight to the couch which I can see from the car and start clawing it. He'll stop for a minute or so until I get back inside and then go and do it again, harder and faster. No amounts of growling  at him works as it usually does when he's naughty. I have to phisically move him away. Why does he do this? Is this him being angry at me while I'm away or is he showing how 'tought' he can be? Please help, my couch is coping a beating!!

20090227124117AA6KUFO	Pets;Reptiles	So I found a baby lizard.. Help please.?	Im not really sure if its a baby or not, could just be small. But anyway. I was outside and my cat Angel was playing with something under a white towel.. So I went to see what she was playing with and it was a tiny lizard, he looked dead but I wasn't sure. I felt really bad for him so I nudged him with a stick to see if he would move, he did move one arm. So I wasn't sure if it was him really moving or just moved by me somehow.. So I nudged him again, just very lightly and he crawled under the towel again. I feel really bad for him and want to help him. Should I bring him in the house and built a little thing for him to be in? Or should I leave him outside and give him some water and try to find some small bugs for him to eat? He looks really exhausted.     http://i204.photobucket.com/albums/bb116...     http://i204.photobucket.com/albums/bb116...     http://i204.photobucket.com/albums/bb116...     http://i204.photobucket.com/albums/bb116...    His eyes are still open.. You can see hes really tired or in pain T__T   What should I do? Dont just tell me to leave him alone and let him die because I wont. If I can find a way to make him feel better even just a tiny bit then thats what I want to do. I already cut this plastic bin thing and im going to put that over him so no one steps on him and put a little cap of water under there with him for now..

20090227125024AA9LDwN	Pets;Fish	Betta Fish Swim Bladder Problem?	I have a Betta fish who appears to have a swim bladder problem, but I have ruled out most of the causes. At first I treated it as if he were constipated, and stopped feeding him for a few days then gave him a pea, and then all was well. His bowl got REALLY gross though so I changed his water and after about an hour he was floating again and on his side. After repeating this a few times, I changed his water before feeding him, sure enough it happened again. Is it possible the water changes are causing this? Our water is supplied by a well but it is filtered.

20090306163513AAOpIkT	Pets;Cats	Kittens whiskers breaking?	We've noticed our kittens whiskers are breaking. The vet nurse said he'd never heard of it and to mention it to the vet when he goes in for his 3rd vacc, desexing and micro-chipping later this month.   I considered malnutrition however, the vet confirmed his diet was good on his last check up.      I think it's from our older cat (1 & a 1/2yr old female). They wrestle heaps and i think this is breaking his whiskers.   Has this happened to your kitten?      If so, should we separate them until his whiskers return or will they strengthen in time?      :) THANKS :)

20090306155944AAXzC4o	Pets;Cats	My cat licks her furr off?	my 7 year old cat, Buffy, has a habit whenever she's not doing anything to lick and "bite" her furr off.....both her inside legs are bald from it and half her belly is very bald and pink. she is a black and white moggy and is currently on a diet to lose some weight which she is finding hard because her previous owners spoiled her so much! we adopted her from the RSPCA 2 years ago and they told us that she regularly did this since her sister cat Molly (who got run over by a car and died) "bullied" her but Molly has been dead for at least 4 years now so i don't think it's that. what do you think is making her do this and how can i prevent it? the vets are closely monitoring her habit and tell us to try and stop her from licking so much.
20090306161414AAJEhO5	Pets;Cats	My kitten is still giving me problems?	My problem still persist. It's been around one month and he is around 9 weeks old already. My kitten now pees inside the litter tray with no problem but he doesn't poop in it. He either poops on rug, bed or on the floor and that's really driving us crazy. Just minutes ago, he pooped on my parents' bed and they were very angry about it. I always instruct them to shut all the doors and not to allow the kitten to access but they always forget because our previous cat absolutely had no problem with doing her business. Infact she would whine when she couldn't find her tray for doing business.      Please tell me what more can I do. I am going oversea for a week in 3 weeks time and I don't wish to hear complains from my family while I'm away which would dampen my mood.   I have 2 litter trays for him, one for pee and the other for poo. He did use the pooping one in my presence yesterday and I kept praising him for doing so.   His litter trays are kept clean. I scoop out his poop immediately everytime.    I have tried different brands and type of litter. He uses it. Even when we confine him, he would poop on a rug if there is. Only when we took the rug out then he would use it correctly.   There was one time he wanted to poop on a rug in my presence. I quickly carried him to his litter tray but he decided not to poop anymore. It seems like a behaviour problem to me that he purposely want to poop outside his litter tray.      I'm feeling so desperate now. You guys understand? Please advise me. I want to go oversea with a peace of mind.

I noticed a foul odor a few weeks after moving into my new loft, turned out my cat (who I've had for 3 years) was peeing on my couch! this is odd behavior for her, because normally she would never EVER pee on furniture, so this took me by surprise. I spent a whole weekend cleaning the couch, using an enzyme remover that eliminated the urine & the smell, then finished up with a carpet shampooer until it smelled fresh and new. she quit going there for 2 weeks and even started sleeping on the couch which she wasn't doing before, then just today, she peed on it again in the same spot. What's going on?
