The Republic of Ireland in particular is vehemently pro-Palestinian, as they are more able than most to identify with occupation and the murder of their citizens by occupying forces.    Edit:   Lupine, are you equating Muslims with "rats"?    As a non-religious individual, I find that abhorrent.|`|VryeGYNTaa	hamas provoked Israel . He send thousands of rockets and mortars into Israel. He should have been prepared for the consequence. Obviously Israel is going to be pissed. what country won't?!|`|uSfStmSdaa	1. Hamas was founded in 1988.  That's 20 years after Israel attacked and occupied the remainder of Palestine.    2. If there are so many religious fanatics in Gaza, remember, Israel as the occupying power is responsible the educational system along with health and wellbeing of the citizens under occupation.  There must be something funny about the Israeli education - trying to teach people with bullets and tanks?    3. Palestinians have tried various peaceful means of attaining justice and freedom, the 1987 Intifada was a largely peaceful rebellion that Israel crushed by breaking the bones of protesters.  Also negotiations, during which Israel has only increased its oppression and occupation.  Not to forget, either, that at the start of the recent Intifada Israel killed at least a dozen or so protesters in the occupied territories (note: these weren't people going into Israel to attack Israelis, they were protesting Israeli occupation in their own land) before the Palestinians started any armed rebellion.  Israel killed at least 100 Palestinians in the occupied territories before Palestinians started crossing into Israel and attacking.    4. 75% of the people of Gaza are refugees from what's now considered Israel, forced out in 1948, 1949 and later.  Forced out at gunpoint, threatened by massacre - such threats made real by actual massacres perpetrated by Israeli/Zionist forces deliberately targetting civilians.  For example killing innocent people by boarding them up in their homes then placing explosives around those homes and blowing them up with the people inside.  Sderot was built on the lands of a village ethnically cleansed by Israel and confiscated from Palestinians, its legal owners probably live in Gaza today.    5. Israel broke the recent truce first.  And the even more recent one.  And several truces that it didn't agree to but that Hamas did.    It's pretty clear who has the overwhelming responsibility for the violence, it's the same party that started it, committed the overwhelming amount of it and has nuclear weapons.  I hope the EU guy isn't representative.|`|5oSnj1eTaa	Allow me to have a different opinion my friend.  It is the Jews that are going to sit on the Hague War Crime Tribunal.  Not the Palestinians.  The same happened when the Nazi Germans did similar things during the 2nd World War in Nuremberg.  A death toll of 1200 people in 2 1/2 weeks using highly illegal bombs in urban areas is more than a war crime. It's murder.  The Eu stands firmly against the Jews this time my dear.

So no objective reporting to be expected from them in this matter.

f3f09dd5dab69f7e644b37c4cf98a3abaa	Henn. County Government Center.  OR if you are out in the burbs - any of the service centers could help you out.   Like at Ridgedale, Brookdale etc.
vfqaiqvfaa	Definitely stay away from the theme parks!  It's fun to do, but you're right about your 2 year old not appreciating it yet.  I live in Orlando and if I ever have kids I'm waiting to take them until I know they'll remember it!  Anyway, just to give you a heads up...between the middle of March and April, it's Spring Break which means alot more people at the beaches BUT, I think if you head to the west coast of Florida and avoid Daytona and the other hot spots for Spring Breakers, you should be ok.  My favorite place on the west coast is probably Sanibel Island.  The water there is much more calm than on the east coast of Florida and it doesn't seem as overrun with crazy people lol  From Tampa it's probably a 2 hour drive (not sure if renting a car was in your budget or already planned) but it is beautiful.  I know you didn't want to do the theme parks but how about going to The Florida Aquarium?  Even though your son is only 2, he'd probably get alot of enjoyment seeing the fish and other sea creatures.  It's in Tampa, but it looks like a good time.  Anyway...hope this helps you out at least a little with some ideas!  Good Luck =)|`|oKLXUQisaa	umm just goo.lol. forget that one trick.

IstwJtBraa	Well Lucky for you Breezes is located between Sosua and Cabarete.  Nitelife is in Sosua if you are looking for beautiful women by the hundreds.  Cabarete is a young sports minded crowd.  Surf, Kite surf and windsurf during the day and party all nite on the beach that is lined with clubs and restaurants.    You can rent a car at the ariport which I assume is Puerto Plata International Airport and is only a 15-20 minute drive to the resort.  Check National Car Rental and Eurocar online and make a reservation there.  You don't need a 4 wheel drive but a 2 wheel drive Suv is needed since the roads are crap and cars don't hold up but 4 wheel is NOT NEEDED.    This hotel is the farthest away from OTHER hotels in the whole area so it is a one man band as far as that goes.|`|wM9Vt4iyaa	First I don't think you can visit other resorts. usually  they have a disco there and they have nightly entertainment.book your ala ca-rte restaurants asap and they may have a dress code for the restaurants, so bring a pair of pants. you'll have a meeting to go to maybe the next morning after you arrive. they will give you info to excursions you can go on.|`|4be1f3ad8f299c875b8ca052826c953faa	Breezes is actually located between Sosua and Cabarete - it's kind of off on its own.  I believe there is a disco at the resort but not sure how good it is.  If you want to go to a nightclub you'll have to take a taxi to either Sosua or Cabarete - there are plenty of nightclubs in both.  As far as other resorts close by - no none within walking distance.  If you would have stayed right in Sosua or Cabarete there are plenty.  Also - the Playa Dorada complex in Puerto Plata has about 13 or14 resorts in it as well as separate nightclubs, a pizza hut, shopping plaza etc.  You might want to check that place out although it's quite a distance from where you are staying.
tV7ZYIeEaa	With a 2 and 4 y/o you can eliminate both Universal parks and just stick with Disney parks. Universal rides are not aimed for little children they do have areas for them but wont enjoy it for a full day.    Fl Aquarium is great they would love that but thats in Tampa you would need to travel more and traveling with small kids isent that fun so I think you should just stick to Sea World where you can spend a day.    The outlet mall closest to Disney is called Premium Outlets  http://www.premiumoutlets.com/outlets/ou...    If you need to get around the best way is to rent a car if not you would be riding the taxi all around. We have public transportation called the Lynx but IMO tourist should not be riding them they waste precious vacation time.  http://www.mearstransportation.com/TaxiF...|`|rPbyDmjYaa	I agree with Josh.  First of all....skip Universal until they are older.  Islands of Adventure is mainly roller coasters. Universal really does not have much for kids either.  2 & 4 year olds will not really enjoy the parks.  I would say stay away from Epcot ( I find it very boring), Animal Kingdom is easily done in a day and they have great shows.  Definitely see Lion King and Finding Nemo.  Plus the rides are  a lot tamer.  If you go to Animal Kingdom go on the safari first thing in the morning. The animals are usually out then and I saw a ton on Saturday (but avoid the back row because that is where the ride is the bumpiest)    Magic Kingdom is a must.  Hollywood studios can be avoided with kids that age.   I do suggest Sea world, more fun for the kids and its in Orlando so its not a long drive to Tampa and Miami  is about a 4-6 hour drive from Orlando (depending on traffic).  Sea World even has a special section for the kids to play in.    There are the Prime Outlets on I-drive  http://www.primeoutlets.com/  and then there are the premium outlets.  http://www.premiumoutlets.com/outlets/ou...    Not sure about the hotels that are decorated with Disney cartoons, but I know any of the resorts are very disney.  Definitely do a Character breakfast, there are a ton you can choose from.     Rent a car, its easier to get around then public transportation.  In Disney use their transportation, but outside of the park  you need a car.|`|f3f09dd5dab69f7e644b37c4cf98a3abaa	With small children - it will take more than 4 days.  They are really too little to get much out of the trip - If you are going to eliminate a park - they are probably too little to get too much out of Epcot.    Disney hotels are in various parts of a very large section and all provide bus transportation to the various parks.  some also have boat rides to specific parks.    Lower cost are the All-Star Resorts.  I like the Port Orleans Riverside my self.    1 of the Universal parks is more big thrill rides the other is not.    (did I say that your kids are too little for this 9 day intensive adventure)    If you stay in Orlando (and I would stay at a disney park for the days you are going to disney.)  You will need to rent a car to get around outside of Disney.  There is not very good public transportation.  Miami is a drive - so plan an overnight road trip rather than a day trip   THere are packages you can buy that will bus you to Tampa Bush Gardens if you want another jungle thing.  Animal Kingdom at WDW has lots of animals on their Safari.    Seaworld would be fun - and plan a couple of days to just relax at a beach or park.    Try:www.allears.com or http://www.orlandosentinel.com/travel/ for information.|`|8dd8e579fd621e4b4affcc8b80072b8caa	I have done this when my kids were small. It is crazy. They build the parks so that you can not get around easily. This was done on purpose so that you have to spend more days to see it. The one in California you can see in one day but Florida it takes much longer.    If your kids are very small then I would just see the Main Disney World Park. That is where the rides are for small ones. I like some parts of Epcot but that is another whole day just to expereince part of it.    There is a tran that takes you to Disney World but then it is a long long walk just to get to the gate. They really spread everything out and it will be exhausting with little ones. So take your time instead of trying to rush around and see it all. They dont let you take food in too and that is a hastle because kids get hungry all the time. It is real expensive too. Food is expensive and drinks.    Stay away from Miami with kids. It has lots of crime and it is hard to get around. Nothing for kids and a big hastle. Better off heading to the zoo and aquarium in Tampa/Ft Lauderdale. Not far from Orlando. Miami is real far (I have done it).    Never stayed in Disney hotels and they are expensive. I suggest one of the condos near it with transport to the parks. Some are timeshares they rent out. But there is real deals on condos if you search and you will have a complete kitchen for the kids.    Not sure on public transport except to the park. I rented a car as it was so much easier with my own wheels for the kids.    I not sure I can tel you which parks to eliminate. Universal has kiddie rides as does the Main gate of Disney world. But many rides will not be good for that young age. And remember it will be exhausting and they will zonk out or cry alot. They get real overwhelmed. They are really too young to enjoy this place. My kids were 9 and 11 and it was still so hard. And they hardly remembered a thing after we got home except for the bad things that happened.    One thing. If you go to the Gulf beaches do not take the kids in the water at all. We dealt with stingrays, huge crabs, and jellyfish all of which can cause fear and pain. The crab hooked my husbands foot and the stingray incidents are common and cause hospital visits. We were lucky as my son only split his chin on the edge of the pool.    If you go, tone the trip down for the kids. See what you want and maybe do a few rides for them. They will not remember much as they are quite small.|`|24948e8cfccfac676ed650d70e787147aa	Well the lines can get extremely long for an attraction, so that takes up time..It is extremely hot outside, i live in Florida.... and when you wait in lines its hot! But nice sunny weather.   In orlando go to SeaWorld, to look at aquatic fish, Discovery Cove to swim with fish, and Aquatica is a waterpark!  Disney World, has alot cute little rides for tiny ones, Epcot is all the Countries, MGM is kinda like hollywood, Animal Kingdom, has animals  I would recommend; Walt Disney World, and Sea World.  Universal Studios doesnt have alot of kiddy rides, nor does Islands of Adventure.... there are a few parts but Disney is your way to go!!    Oh and for a hotel i recommend the Contemporary Resort, you can take a monorail to the Walt Disney World theme park!

XXm2yCHiaa	Oh my god, help us!!!  we are all dying from lack of chewing gum.  We all have no more nails from the withdrawal pains and many trees have been fallen by people seeking alternatives to chewing gum.    FYI, consumption of chewing gum is not illegal, but sale of chewing gum is illegal.  So you can chew gum in front of a policeman and they would not do anything.      For those who want to have chewing gum, they normally buy it from JB in Malaysia and bring it in.  If the quantity is small, you normally have no problems bringing it in.

Except for chewing gum of therapeutic value, the "importing" of chewing gum into Singapore is absolutely banned.'    'The set of Regulations also does not make any provisions for personal use quantities to be brought into Singapore. Therefore, bringing chewing gum into Singapore, even small quantities for whatever purpose, is technically prohibited.'    'No black market for chewing gum in Singapore ever emerged, though some Singaporeans occasionally still manage to smuggle some chewing gum from Johor Bahru for their own consumption.'    I don't think you'd get thrown into jail, but you may get a fine.    It's only gum. People can live without it. *shrug*    P.S. Check with your lady friends if they like gum stuck to their heels now or hair when they were kids. :P|`|Ioc0owmfaa	Not to like my country just because of chewing gum???

And Why we are blaming Israel for those Attacks?    When a dog bites your butt, do you blame him or his owner?

rRyKu6Jeaa	The only place I've been in Croatia is Dubrovnik, which I absolutely adore. It remains one of my favourite places I've ever been, and I've been to most of Europe. It has an Old Town which is quaint, with cobblestone streets and cafes and churches, and is encircled by the medieval walls which give amazing views over the Old Town and over the Adriatic Sea. It also has a great beach, relatively cheap and nice B&B's, and delicious seafood since it's right on the water.   I would recommend this to anyone -- it's one of the most beautiful places I've ever been.|`|ZR25pTOYaa	?|`|LKwYiNeVaa	Web-Pages are not in English but always you can use:    http://translate.google.com/translate_t ...

c43c4f873b96d5b8ae08c90457ffed18aa	Everything here is in the French Quarter:    Boiled seafood: Acme Oyster House.    King cakes at any bakery, and probably Rouses Grocery Store. (The person who gets the baby doll stuffed inside the cake has the honor of bringing the king cake to the next party.)    Muffalettes have got to come from Central Grocery Store on Decatur Street or Johnny's Po Boys on corner of St. Louis Street at Decatur to be authentic.  Central Grocery store has been there forever, and has those huge vats of olive salad that is awesome on your sandwich.    Johnnie's has a good cheap breakfast, too, and a shrimp po-boy to die for. ("Dressed" po-boy means it comes with lettuce, tomato, and mayo.) They close at 4 in the afternoon, so lunch is advised.    Po Boys and muffalettes are two different sandwiches, by the way.    If the Gazebo Cafe is the one on Decatur Street, the food was pretty good, and you have the advantage of a live band playing across the street most days.     I don't know what a 2 power pass is, but rent yourself a stroller for the kid and do the night walking tour. They used to have some little red wagons for rent that the kids loved being pulled in.     As for the tours, I'm sending you a link that may have info you need.    I think tourist infomation office is also on Decatur street; your hotel will know.    One beware, however: Do not go into the cemetary alone, not even in the day time. The cemetaries are walled in and it's very easy to get mugged there. Pop for a buggy ride.     Have fun!|`|7wQGpG9Zaa	I would eat anything at Mother's Restaurant, and would not bother going any where else.|`|1IsKyXdgaa	1. try gambinos in metarie for the king cake. central grocery for the muffelatta. and for the crawfish you wont get fresh crawfish till may or june.    2.no?....    3.yeah, pretty much.    4. &5. are just tourist traps from people trying to take your money find a local who actually knows what their talking about.

M9ocOeIMaa	First, you should see these:  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oEH2gh-zs...  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wzcuBbztn...    What do they know about Romania?    1. Tourists:  Most of them: Dracula and Transylvania.   Few of them: The Merry Cemetery in Sapanta, the unique Maramures architecture, the unique style of the Bucovina medieval monasteries, the medieval looks of Transylvania, the Danube Delta, the Iron Gates on the Danube, gold and silver in Apuseni, muddy volcanoes and soooo on...     2. Nature freaks:  Romania is 33% mountains (lovely Carpathians), 33% hills, 33% plain lands... 3 in 1 like the coffee. Also the Danube Delta and of course the Black Sea.     3. Architects:  The Brancovenesc style and the Maramures style. Check the normal Romanian churches (Brancovenesc style) and the Northern Transylvanian churches & gates (Maramures). Also the Bucovina monasteries    4. Politicians:  December 1989 - a very violent fall of communism: national revolution + shooting the communist leader and his wife on Christmas day... we might not be vampires, but we surely are cruel :)) ... or pissed... f***ing communists...    5. Linguists  How the... hell did those people manage to stay Latin when surrounded by all those Slavonic countries?? They share the same religion with them, but not the same language origins!! Wait!!! Are you telling me that Romania is the only Latin Orthodox country??  But they didn't manage to stay 100% Latin... they still have Slavonic mixed in their language... It's like Italian people saying "Da"    6. Famous Romanians  I'll just write some famous names...   Literature: Emil Cioran, Mircea Eliade (apparently Coppola loves this guy :))), Tristan Tzara (the founder of dadaism, which comes from the Romanian "da-da", meaning "yes-yes"), Eugene Ionesco  Art: Constantin Brancusi (sculptor), George Enescu (musician, check for "Ciocarlia"), Gheorghe Zamfir (musician, check the Kill Bill Soundtrack), Johnny Weismuller (actor, the famous Tarzan), Bela Lugosi (Romanian actor of Hungarian ethnicity, the famous Dracula), Alexandra Maria Lara (actress), Marcel Iures (actor), Michael Cretu (singer, band Enigma)  Sports: Nadia Comaneci, Gheorghe Hagi, Ghita Muresan (the huge guy from "My Giant"), Helmuth Duckadam  Science: Nicolae Paulescu (the inventor of insulin), Henri Coanda (the inventor of the jet plane), Stefan Odobleja (the father of cybernetics)    Let's not forget Dracula :))  Half-Romanian: Harvey Keitel :D    Also... before the WWII, Bucharest was famous for being "the little Paris"    Typical objects: ceramic crockery and the specially curved pan flute called "nai"|`|BgfBpkA3aa	the legend of dracula, Transylvania is an area of the country.  they also had a "notable" dictator|`|YjFDfp5Paa	What travel guides say about Romania:    " why should you go to Romania? The straight answer is because it is one of the most beautiful countries of Southeast Europe." (The Blue Guide)    "Few regions offer a more dazzling display of cultural and artistic treasures than Romania." (Smithsonian Journeys)    "Considered by many the most beautiful country in Eastern-Europe, Romania still claims regions that seem bastions of a medieval past long since lost elsewhere."  (Fodor's Eastern and Central Europe)    "Romania has majestic castles, medieval towns, great hiking and wildlife"  (The Lonely Planet)    "No journey to Eastern Europe would be complete without paying a visit to Romania Outstanding landscapes, a huge diversity of wildlife" (The Rough Guide)    Romania offers a rich tapestry of tourist attractions and vacation experiences unique in Central-Eastern Europe: medieval towns in Transylvania, the world-famous Painted Monasteries in Bucovina, traditional villages in Maramures, the magnificent architecture of Bucharest, the romantic Danube Delta, fairy-tale castles, the Black Sea resorts, the majestic Carpathian Mountains, spas and much more.

But I agree, the city might have shot themselves in the feet with the bike rally rules.  I never thought it was so bad...my spring vacation here always coincided with it.   I think we can't blame the city for the amusement parks failing though since they both had private ownership.  The city can't help it if the budget doesn't allow for subsidizing these types of ventures.   I think the Hard Rock was way to expensive for what it offered.

cxNLOPHNaa	As a rule... No. We are not constantly spotting celebrities at every turn. Those of us that live here, can go years without ever running into one. I was born and raised here, in LA. I have seen many. But this is mostly due to me having been in the music business for many years. Outside of the business, I have run into a few. But it's certainly far from a frequent occurrence.    Los Angeles is a huge area. While we obviously have far more celebrities among us than, for example, a city in Iowa would. This doesn't mean we're constantly sitting next to them, in traffic, or running into them at the market. All it really means is that we have higher odds of seeing one on any given day than somebody in another state.|`|U9bQgfY9aa	Only one in 8 years living here.

Sorry to burst your bubble.|`|xqtKODvbaa	well it all depends where you live and work    I for example do both in the Toluca Lake and Studio City area in the San Fernando Valley. Since these are the 'studio' communities you see celebs everywhere. For example, every single time I shop at Gelson's on Riverside and Laurel Canyon, I see celebrities all the time. I remember one time there was this guy driving an old beat up broken down Toyota, you know those ugly cars from the 70's, anyways he was looking for a parking spot at Gelson's, and guess who it was? Liam Niesen!! Schindler's List ring a bell?  If you go to Bob's Big Boy in Toluca Lake you're bound to see a celeb. I also remember one time I was standing in line at the City National bank on the corner of Ventura and Laurel Canyon, and Ed O'Neil was standing right behind me, Al Bundy!  Across the street from that bank you have 2 huge shopping centers, and at Louise's Trattoria you always see a mess of celebs, yes even the lesser known ones.  Let's see, I believe Denzel Washington, Andy Garcia, and Markie Post live in Toluca Lake, among others, and of course you have dozens of others, like Bob Hope's house is on the corner of Forman and Moorpark. Many celebs attend mass at St. Charles church on Moorpark and Lankershim. You also have many of the CEO's, writers, producers, directors, and other VIP's who live in the area.

3RyvKIvPaa	Cockney D is full of ****.  He hates Manchester because he claims its full of gun crime. What he fails to realise is that I have lived in Manchester my whole and I have never experienced any of said crime.     Cockney D is so obsessed with his hatred of Manchester that he has even gone so far as opening another account, under the name of 'AnthonyHWilson'.   It isn't just yahoo answers he haunts either, he also goes on and on using youtube:  http://uk.youtube.com/user/AnthonyHWilso...    My favourite bit about Cockney D/ AnthonyHWilson, is that he has no valid reason for his constant ranting.   I've asked him time and time again- if he hates Manchester so much, why not just forget the place? Why does he feel the need to keep going on and on about it?   He cannot answer my question. Infact, when I asked him on youtube, he deleted it and blocked me from contacting him! If that isn't the sign of someone who can't back up their own argument, I don't know what is.     To be honest I do think that he is jealous of the best city in the UK!  Who wouldn't be? I mean, we DO have the best accent, the best football team, the best bands (The Smiths, Joy Division, Happy Mondays etc) and the best television show (Shameless) on earth.     And finally, my FAVOURITE bit of this whole thing. There is a debate as to whether Cockney D (aka AnthonyHWilson) is infact a Cockney at all. Rumour has it, boys and girls, that this hypocritical twat is actually a scouser!!     Turrahhhh|`|WMUB91imaa	So true!  hes done my head in.  GO ANSWER QUESTIONS BOUT YOUR OWN **** TOWN THANKS VERY MUCH!    i agree with everything you say. Because Manchester is awesome. despite the weather.   I agree with rushholmes....  :)    I bet you live in longsight, wythenshawe or langworthy road, thats why you hate it so much. stop being such a negative old fart and go back down south where you came from|`|LCCd5GGcaa	I see my role as being highly intelligent myself to educate those less fortunate with low intellect and poor academic standards.  That is why I spend my time talking to guncunians - Manchester has the lowest 5% of GCSE results in the whole UK so there is much work for me to do!|`|5G9WGH0Baa	The facts (something Cockney D never employs himself) speak for themselves:-    The 6% 'best answer' rate means the only people agreeing with him are the fake profiles he lurks under;    The only 'proof' that Manchester is the European Capital of Gun Crime is a link to 'Urban Dictionary: the slang dictionary you wrote', a website that looks like Wikipedia for illiterates - oddly enough, all the posts there have the same obsession with 'Gunchester' and its 'pedos';    The only 'proof' that Manchester is the Britain's worst city is an out of date Channel 4 property porn series - next he'll be using an episode of 10 Years Younger in an attempt to claim Mancunians have a shallow gene pool;    The constant references to 'Gunchester', a term that last had any relevance when the likes of Right Said Fred, The Shamen and Jimmy Nail had hit singles - never mind that the UK has less gun-crime and gun-related deaths than any other major Western country;    As far as educating us, well, the only lesson we've learned so far is how to lose friends and irritate people!|`|aiKLvwGTaa	Cockney D-    Strange that you comment on Manchester's education system.    My brother and my sister both went to Oxford.    My best friend went to Cambridge.    My ex got into Cambridge (but chose Edinburgh- don't ask me why!)      What do they have in common? They're all Mancunian. They were all educated by Manchester's education system.

AA10956234	I think you know me 7ala, and some people here know me, and anyway I'm a peaceful person, and I always try to say my opinion with respect to others and without hurting anyone, <br>  <br>  As an Egyptian, and as an old member in this category, I don't like someone to make jokes abt my country and Egyptians, also I don't like someone to tell me that Egypt is a dirty country, even if its a fact, bcoz it's not nice or respectful to say that, <br>  <br>  That's my opinion, and if someone, anyone, who really care abt my country and want to tell me something, or say his opinion WITHOUT WITHOUT WITHOUT offending way or twisting words, then for sure i will respect it and feel he is really caring abt my country, <br>  <br>  But there are a type of people who give an answer that shows they care abt Egypt, and in fact they don't care, they just want to look in ur eyes and say shame on you u r Egyptians, ...etc<br>  <br>  7ala, tell me why i always like to see ur answers and ur opinions abt Egypt and Egyptians even if it shows our problems sometimes, or our bad side, bcoz i know u r honest and i can feel that, but not everyone is like u, <br>  <br>  So at the end it's not as u said :<br>  >> in brief we don't like non Egyptians talking about Egypt probs , i guess we like to keep it our own ones ..<<<br>  <br>  No, bcoz i never felt offended from ur opinions abt Egypt, or from lily's opinion for example, or from crazy girl opinion, <br>  u see, it depends who is saying it and does he/she has any bad feeling?<br>  <br>  Peace and love to all|`|5YPh5RXPaa	Admitting one's problems and facing them is the best step towards solving them. <br>  So there is no doubt about it that we have to know about our shortcomings and be told about them if we are not aware of them. <br>  But to answer your Q, I guess that the mentioned answerer meant to say that some foreigners who visit Egypt only mention its drawbacks in an insulting sarcastic way that is offensive to us, without attempting to say anything positive. <br>  I am sure that those who want to mention our problems can do so in a nice decent way without hurting their addressee.|`|9VevsfLxaa	Yes, I agree with you.<br>  And one of our biggest problems is those soccer fans who are always shouting and yelling and paying attention to soccer only and ignoring anything else in the world.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  BEEEP BEEP DARAWEEEESH.<br>  PLEASE SUPPORT ISMAILY TODAY IN THE MATCH AGAINST AHLY.

But then as soon as someone who is not black says that word, the whole room becomes dead silent and then there almost always is a huge problem and fight because of it.<br>  <br>  So is it only ok for people to say bad things about their own nationality, race, religion, etc, etc but not others?<br>  I would say no. How is it better for me to say bad stuff about my own country, but if someone repeats exactly what I say, it's wrong? They're both the same thing.<br>  And obviously, if others feel bad about your country, then that should just give you motivation to try to improve your country.<br>  <br>  I'm not Egyptian, so that person's answer couldn't have offended me. Of course I would feel bad if someone started saying bad stuff about my nationality or religion, but if they were saying the truth, why should I make a big deal out of it? It's the truth and the truth is always accessible and sometimes, the truth isn't always so pretty, it's pretty ugly. I would tell the person, "Yes, that's true, but that isn't the only thing that makes up my country, there are good things as well."<br>  <br>  Now, if the person were talking about the truth but portraying it in a really negative light, that would make me angry. If someone said "There's a lot of problems with the Middle East", obviously, I'd agree. But if someone came up and began saying a whole bunch of racial slurs to me b/c they aren't happy with what's going on in the Mid-East, then that would be a problem.|`|0pM85b5Baa	I don't find it a problem if one mentioned his opinion that he doesn't like non-Egyptians talking about Egyptian problems. Some other people may find it not bad. That's Egypt, we have different opinions and different ways to love Egypt. In all cases we love Egypt. <br>  Usually the problem occurs when someone is always asking or discussing negative things, we have something like radar by which we can feel whether that person is normal, jealous or full of hate towards Egypt. <br>  <br>  In case you feel you ask normally, don't worry we'll know that. If you revise your questions and answer and see that you may be one of the above mentioned kinds, also don't worry we can handle that.<br>  We get use to most kinds users and members in Y/A Egypt section. <br>  <br>  I mean you don't have to explain your point of view by words, but make it clear in your questions and answer on time.
6a7c2f7356f1dbadf90f001beb576671aa	Putin pretty much blew a historical chance to help modernize Russia during the boom years of 2002-2008.  Instead of properly investing the oil and gas proceeds, reforming the business sector, upgrading infrastructure, etc. he let the rich 1% party like there was no tomorrow.  So now you have Porsches stuck in traffic with nowhere to go, cash and gold reserves about to run out, ruble getting more worthless every day, and to top it off, declining oil production.  The past six years have been mostly wasted so some well connected people could get rich.|`|MoidAgwuaa	I studied Russia a few years ago and things were not good. There are a lot of people who are very poor. I saw a documentary about a woman who was a microbiologist but she was still so poor she couldn't leave the country. I think there are some people who have a ton of money, and a lot of people who don't. I know they're doing what they can to try and work with what natural resources they have (oil and natural gas). I've heard that the mafia is very active there.|`|ABZfW82eaa	Crisis has concerned all. At us in Russia too not all is good. Unemployment has a little grown. But in 1998 when Russia declared a default was much worse.|`|293I2MzJaa	It depends on what you used to.  Many russians believe they live in one of the best country in the world, but im sure if american got to live there, he wouldn't be as comfortable and happy.  It is all about mentality, life stile, ext.  Russia is NOT the country for everyone, just like USA could be.  As for economy - where is it good right now??|`|z4Yrn96Paa	The global economis crisis has hit Russia and this year the government budget is in the red with a large deficit.  However the thing which holds back Russia is corruption at every level from top to bottom.  President Dmitry Medvedev has said that tackling corruption is one of his top priorities and he tries to be very vocal about ending such.  But its very deeply seated and will take some time to overcome.    Life in the 4-5 largest cities is good, however in smaller cities there is large unemployment and infrastructure problems to tackle.

dpKntiZoaa	A good starting point for studying in NL is the NUFFIC site.  It has sections with advice for foreign students, what it is like, how to arrange it, and importantly for you - a section where you can search the available courses (in English I assume?) on offer    Here is the link to the search option http://www.nuffic.nl/international-stude... Just typing 'photography' I found three, of which two look suitable (but of course you can read more) Bachelor Fine Art Course at ArtEZ Institute of the Arts (Enschede), and MA Photographic Studies at Leiden University. I am not familiar with Enschede, but Leiden Uni is very well considered, and Leiden is a fantastic place to live as a student.    As a former student advisor for a international course (yes a business one!) then I can fully recommend NL as a place to study. The education level is very good, and the environment (depending on where you are studying) is really good for a student    So I hope you find something you like    Good luck

FvmrSeqRaa	If you really want to save, you can find tickets from as low as $150. <br>  <br>  First off, this is what I recommend.<br>  <br>  1. Make your dates flexible (if possible)<br>  2. Fly on Wednesday's and Thursday's, they are the cheapest days to fly in and out.<br>  3. Trying searching and playing around with nearby airports. (For example, depart Columbus, Cleveland, Detroit, to Knoxville, Chatanooga, Nashville). <br>  4. Try out different websites.<br>  <br>  I prefer either, bookit.com, hotwire.com, and travelocity.com.<br>  <br>  It's the departure from Canton that is raising your price, really try to find nearby cities with airports. <br>  <br>  Good luck and have a safe journey.<br>  <br>  P.S. The world has become a far to expensive place... :)|`|0UYJkSuZaa	First of all you need to find out what airports you are going to be flying from and to. Second, I have never found expedia or orbits to be cheaper than anything else. Go on the yahoo home page and click on travel. Search there, or go to AOL's home page and click travel. Make sure you have the date's set correctly. With this much notice, you should be able to get one like $100 cheaper. Also once you know what airports you are going to use. check Southwests website. They have some one way flights for $99.

The migration started in the late 19th century, but accelerated after the 1948 Arab-Israeli War.<br>  <br>  856,000 Jews left their homes in Arab countries from 1948 until the early 1970s; 260,000 reached Israel in 1948-1951, 600,000 by 1972. The Jews of Egypt and Libya were expelled while those of Iraq, Yemen, Syria, Lebanon and North Africa left due to physical and political insecurity. Most were forced to abandon their property. By 2002 these Jews and their descendants constituted about 40% of Israel's population. The World Organization of Jews from Arab Countries (WOJAC) estimates that Jewish property abandoned in Arab countries would be valued today at more than $300 billion and Jewish-owned real-estate left behind in Arab lands at 100,000 square kilometers (four times the size of the State of Israel).|`|bMJ0AYI1aa	yes, i think that's a fair analogy, but don't be one-sided about it.<br>  <br>  there were hindu and sikh refugees from pakistan that went to india.<br>  <br>  there were muslim refugees from india that went to pakistan.<br>  <br>  <br>  similarly,<br>  there were jewish refugees from the arab countries that went to israel,<br>  and there were arab refugees from israel. unfortunately, they were not welcome in any arab land, so unlike the 3 previous cases, they had no place to go. because they were mistreated by their own people.|`|i7oHTo9haa	Well I"ll be the first to admit that I'm not aware of historical Hindu and Sikh issues over in Pakistan but if it is anything like the Muslims have done with Jewish people in predominately Muslim areas my sympathies to the Sikhs and Hindus!  Muslims are just moving all over the place destroying societies did you know they're up to 60+ countries now? It's incredible what people let them get away with because of all the violence they do.<br>  <br>  Did you know there were Jewish refugees why everyone talk about Palestinian refugees?  Palestinian refugees became like that willingly when Israel was re-established.  They are just hostile Syrians that came to fight there never was such a thing has Palestinian nation.  They were Syrians that gave up their nationality to become a refugee and squat on Israel land. Even Arabs admit to this.  <br>  <br>  "The Palestinian people does not exist. The creation of a Palestinian state is only a means for continuing our struggle against the state of Israel" -- PLO Executive Committee member Zuhayr Muhsin, March 31, 1977, interview with the Dutch newspaper Trouw.<br>  <br>  "The Israelis can sue the Arabs now, and demand billions or even trillions in compensation for the damage caused them in 1948-1967. You Arabs admitted that the [Palestinian] cause began after 1967. So the Israelis can ask: "Why did you fight us before that?" They will demand Arab compensation for the so-called embargo on Israel and for the economic damage caused to the Israelis. If the Israelis sue you, they will win. They will say: We suffered an injustice. We are like an innocent lamb surrounded by wolves.

All the Arabs that lived on the land prior to Israel formation that were not hostile are now Israeli citizens, 20% population of Israel now. Since when people decide someone else should give up their land because another group is hostile and demands it?  We don't do that.<br>  <br>  Jewish refugees were close to 1million from Arab lands.  Jewish people lived all over the middle East, including Israel and never left it.  When the Middle East was involved in modern nation building and everyone got their home country, the Muslims just didn't want Israel to have their own place.  They wanted to keep them as dhimmi under Muslim rule.  Did you know the Muslim states had concentration camps too?  The foreign Nazi and Vichy troops didn't know who was the Arab and who was the Jew, the Arabs themselves gave up who was the Jew. They were so mean to Jewish people!!<br>  <br>  Jewish people had to leave the Muslim dominated lands and they left property FIVE times the size of Israel and empty homes with all their belongings in them.

As your travel complete before the deadline, you don't need passports.   The 17 year olds are best to carry signed letters of permission from their parents with full contact details, allowing them to travel to Canada with the 18 year olds.

0rtjiY4Taa	I research these trips all the time, and i can tell you that mexico is the way to go if you want to go somewhere inexpensive and have great weather!    Airfare= I recomend kayak.com They check all the major discount websites and tell you which one has the best price. I'm not sure where you'd be flying out of, but for example a roundtrip from san francisco to cancun, would run well under $300 on that website. You can also check there top 25 that will give you the hot deals for many places in the world.    Stay= I recomend (vrbo.com), vacation rentals by owners. This is a website in which condo owners post there places online to make money through out the year. You can find places to stay all over the world on here for cheap. They post pictures too with ameneties, and things to do in the area. The owners goal is that you have a great time there so often times they will let you contact them for info on places to go and do while you stay. You can check a calendar of open dates for the places that you're interested in on the site. You can find places available for under $100 a night garaunteed. Dont be afraid to haggle either. If your price is acceptable, they'd rather let you stay there, than let the room be vacant for that week.      Inclusive is great but i dont think it is totally necessary in a place like mexico if you do it up right. Alcohol is relatively cheap at the stores out there. You can go to the store, and pay a couple bucks for a big bottle and whatever else you need. Stuff tends to be a lot cheaper in mexico. Just make sure to stock up at the store.    Money= pretty much anywhere you go, they will accept the american dollar.     Transportation= shuttles should get you from the airport to your designated area. While in town, i recomend a taxi if its not walking distance. Ask a taxi driver how much to your destination and feel free to haggle. I once took a taxi from tijuana to rosarito off $5, with 5 friends crammed in the car.    Cheated?= keep in mind that many services dont have set prices in mexico. alot of it works with the haggling system. Knowing this is the first step to not getting cheated. If something doesnt seem worth it to you, than walk away. You'll see that they'll usually come up with a better price for you. you're the boss!    good luck|`|hSOYndoxaa	My boyfriend and I and two other couples booked a trip to go to Puerto Vallarta in May 2009. We booked through an AAA travel agent. They are free and can find awesome deals if one of your friends has AAA. We are staying for 10 nights at the Dreams resort & Spa All inclusive its about $1200 per person. This was probably one of the most expensive resorts that we looked at with our travel agent. There were a ton in your price range for Puerto Vallarta. Melia Resort in Puerto Vallarta was about $750 per person includes flight and all inclusive hotel. We chose to stay at Dreams because we are all going with significant others and the resort is more romantic but for a girls trip who needs romantic? Both resorts are close to town. Night life, shopping, activities. They had numerous other packages for different all inclusive resorts also. So definitely check with an AAA travel agent if you or one of your friends is a member. Their online site does not do much help. Go to a local office and get info. Hopefully your trip works out for you this time!!

cjCjnwxEaa	Malaysia better|`|hyHvG1Olaa	The cost of traveling to Southeast Asia can be expensive or inexpensive dependent upon your tastes.  Many international hotel chains have local accommodations such as Best Western, Holiday Inn, Radisson, Hilton, etc and you will pay a little less than the states or Europe but plan on $60 - $120 a night.  If you stay in local establishment the best options are student hostels if you can locate them.  Hong Kong is quite expensive as is Bali but Thailand and the Philippines can be quite inexpensive.  When I visit my wife's family in the Philippines I usually plan on between $2-4K a month dependent upon what my plans are for that particular trip.  My recommendation is to get a student travel card (http://www.istc.org/sisp/index.htm) as it can save a bunch in fees and travel expenses and also book your hotels in advance.  There are several sites and this is only one of the many http://www.statravel.com/.  Good luck and enjoy your trip.|`|ZnFPPU5yaa	Go Malaysia it's more cheaper believe me.|`|6b85f9916ea2b733bde0d13260bd6479aa	$50 to $125 a night should be in the ball park. but your expenses can go through the roof easily.  Hong Kong will probably go the farthest to breaking your budget.  Great hotels and restaurants there that are mighty tempting.  Thailand and the rest are easy.  Always good hotels in these places and you can get away with a lot less money if you want or need to.  Many $25 hotels in Thailand and Bali are quite nice with good amenities.  Pools etc. and I have found over the years that traveling first class has a tendency to isolate you from all human contact.  Other than hotel staff and most of those are not quite human.  Traveling on a lower budget allows you to meet more people and have more social contact.  For this reason, I usually pick hotels with swimming pools.  Its a great place to meet people and break the ice.  You will find that it gets easier and easier to meet people the longer that you are on the road.  You are going to have so much fun!|`|Pnqearnnaa	Hotels will cost on the average about $80. Everything else is quite cheap.

xc6GcEJ6aa	Well because Americans usually believe they are better than anyone else from any other country. Just because we have the most advanced systems and way of living, and because we are the most developed country after many countries in Europe. Americans are quick to be judgemental simply because they don't want to accept that maybe they are not the BEST, and many don't take the time to think about others and what they do for the country as well. Some decide to stay ignorant just so the can say anything prejudice. America can be very messed up, quite frankly.|`|86b8c5f570fd6c000c06a0fa8cd05b2faa	Well for one, not all mexicans have brown skin, indian featues and can't speak english. English is now being taught in many public schools and there's millions of mexicans that are racially white with college educations that legally move to the US. Guillermo Del Toro too white to be mexican? Even Cameron Diaz can probably claim mexican citizenship anytime if she ever wants to and she's pretty damn white to me.    Ex-president Fox is half Irish and half Basque like myself. Doesn't look all that mestizo to me. There's been mexican presidents of indian ethnic groups though (Example: Benito Juarez or Porfirio Diaz).    Americans for one are just too damn lazy to become billingual which is sad because it shuts doors of culture to them. I'm damn glad I'm billingual, one of the best things you could ever do for your children.    Mexican illegal immigrants aren't these evil bastards taking away jobs, they are doing jobs Americans are too spoiled to do. What kind of American teenager would work in horrible conditions picking potatoes for 12 hours for 5 dollars an hour if they are lucky? Illegals doing these jobs is socially acceptable slavery because since they fear getting deported, they endure the horrible living conditions. Most of them live all hunched into little apartments or shacks. Ever shared a bed with 12 strangers (and not for kinky things)?    Americans are ignorant about the world. This Fox News guy called Glen Beck was whining the other day that Mexico is this dump or something, what a turd. I work in a public hospital and while it isn't a 5 star palace and we're missing a lot of things most people would take for granted (like functional lightbulbs), but it's a nice place to work and I like it for the most part. In fact I love my job but that's another question. So far whatever is happening in the US hasn't affected me personally in a negative way. I have guaranteed work for one and my relatives also have steady jobs.    And yes, we get cable tv, oh noes!! I personally think cable here is better than the US. We get far better channels for one. Plus it's far cheaper. I do wish they had Hogan's Heroes though.    Americans should travel more and see their own country isn't the greenest grass in the world either. 8 Mile isn't a fantasy movie.

dpKntiZoaa	Ok, I have done this trip more times than I can count, and used to live in Amstelveen (border of Amsterdam) so can give you first-hand advice.    Firstly - good choice about the Dover-Calais crossing.  The Harwich-Hoek van Holland one is expensive and very long now since they got rid of the fastcraft (due to petrol costs).  So we also use the Dover-Calais crossing    You are also right not to want to take your car into Amsterdam. Unless you have a hotel in Amsterdam with a private and secure car park (and they will charge you an arm and a leg for that) then it would be a costly nightmare to leave your car in amsterdam.    Amstelveen is indeed a good option as it has tram 5 and quicktram (tram which turns into a metro) 51 with a direct route to the centre, so this is certainly an option. There are some hotels in the south of Amstelveen, but these are generally business ones (plus it's a long journey by public transport) so I would advise you to look for something around the RAI area (which is actually Amsterdam and not Amstelveen)      Here are the hotels in and around the RAI. http://www.booking.com/landmark/nl/rai-a... I am not sure of prices though (never used them of course) although business guests used the Novotel and were happy enough.    The majority (although check this) have ample parking in-house and this is usually free, so will save you a bundle as well, plus it is a safe area, both for the car and for you to travel back to in the evening.  Plus it is also on the route of a nightbus as well.    Hopefully this will get you going at least. There is another person on here that also knows Amstelveen well, so maybe he has some idea's in addition.|`|SI02JOQ4aa	There are far fewer cars on the continent, and the roads are of better quality - so don't be nervous.    Your idea is an excellent one, and why not stop at Amstelveen and use public transport for the last 5km into the city.
QUxw60itaa	I would not recommend coming to SA but still your choice.<br>  <br>  1) Depending on qualifications. I would say bachelors degree around R15000 to R20000 depending on experience and can go up to R30000 to R40000 (or more). No qualification, expect to get anything from R2000 to R10000 and no chance of going up in business especially if your white. If your black, we have BEE (Black Economic Empowerment) so you'll do great.<br>  <br>  2) Well I'm from Pretoria don't really know the prices in Durban but it really depends on your taste and where you want to live. In a place like Johannesburg you'll easily pay about R4000 to R6000 p/m just for rent of a 1/2 bedroom place (I'm guessing, correct me if I'm wrong). Some other places like Pretoria is a bit cheaper, something like R1000 to R6000 p/m (depending on where in Pretoria). I'm guessing Durban prices are the same as Pretoria. As a rule just check out jobs in Johannesburg and know that that will be the maximum you'll be paid in SA for that specific job.<br>  <br>  3) Rent say R4000 p/m. Food for 1 say R500 p/m. Elec+Water for 1 say R100/R200 p/m. This is the most basic that it could get. Medical for 1 cheapest about R600 p/m. Car payment anything from R2000-R5000 p/m depending on what car is used.<br>  <br>  4) Easier if your not white but your chances will drastically increase (no matter what color you are) if you have some sort of higher qualification like a bachelor/honours/masters degree. Qualifications would get you much further here. Best website I'll say www.pnet.co.za. Their service are excellent and would call you back in less that 2 hours. Other recruiting companies are abacus, I think their website is www.abacus.co.za or .com. I don't know if they can help you from overseas but its worth a try.<br>  <br>  You are right, it is dependent on certain situations. Just know that if you move to South Africa that you'll never be rich. You can never become rich in country where R10 gives 1US$ or R13 gives 1Euro or R15 gives 1British Pound. If you want to return back you'll most propably won't have the finances by that time. Alot of SA people would want to leave this country due to crime, corruption or whatever other reason but can't due to the exchange rates mentioned above. We can't event if we wanted to.<br>  <br>  Please think carefully about this. If you want more info just email me at lcbotha@ymail.com

Get NEW toys that your baby has never played with before, in addition to a few favorites, that way the baby will be busy exploring a new toy and less likely to get cranky. Ration the toys-don't give them all at once. <br>  <br>  Don't wean your baby off of the bottle/pacifier before the trip-they can be useful tools in calming a baby.<br>  <br>  Make sure to walk around as much as possible, and let the baby walk too (hold his/her hands to prevent a fall)<br>  <br>  Good luck!
O3WYA3WGaa	There's Pioneer Place like 4 blocks from you.  Just walk up Morrison to 4th and you can't miss it. It's a pretty nice mall.    You can also ride the MAX across the river to the east side of town to the Lloyd Center Mall.  It's only a few stops once you cross the river, not sure how many, but just jump on the Blue Line MAX toward Gresham, and then the announcement will say "Arriving at Lloyd Center" and you get off.    There's a small outlet center in Troutdale called Columbia Gorge Outlet Mall, but you might want to check to see if there is anything there that's worth it to you before taking the bus all the way there. http://www.premiumoutlets.com/outlets/ou...    The only big outlet mall I know of is all the way in Woodburn, and it's not accessible by public transportation.    Another place to shop would be the Saturday Market. Local merchants set up their shops there every weekend beginning in March. http://www.portlandsaturdaymarket.com/    A Must-go-to restaurant would be the Portland City Grill.  It's like the equivalent of eating at the Space Needle. It's in the giant pink glass high rise I think on SW 5th & W. Burnside. http://portlandcitygrill.com/    If you like beer, The Rock Bottom Brewery & Restaurant makes great beer. My husband and I met there and go back every year for our anniversary. Their food is great too and mid-priced.  It's on 2nd & SW Morrison on the same side of the street as your hotel.    A couple really good resources....

Its the NW part of downtown you can catch the street car over or walk. they have a lot of nice upscale shops that you can browse through and a lot of art galleries.
g05wGcPhaa	I would actually consider it Central Florida since it's near the Orlando area.    North Florida = Ocala & Daytona Beach and anything north of that    Central Florida = Orlando & Tampa area    South Florida = Sarasota & Port St. Lucie and anything south of that.    The reason why I consider it Central Florida is because the University of Central Florida (UCF) is there so I always claimed it as Central Florida. Most people would say it's Central Florida too.
WnbaA1S0aa	Cairns and Port Douglas! It's where the rainforest meets the reef. Thousands of tourists go there every year because it is such a versatile place and everything is so close.

ZnFPPU5yaa	Singapore if you start getting bored just drive to Malaysia from Singapore-Johor causeway ;]|`|gts7VpU6aa	Singapore is neat and tidy, clean. Hong Kong is b u s y, it's crazy, full of human beings. Each has its own attraction. It's different. The people, the way of life, the night life, the food, everything.    And, yes, after a week in either HK or Singapore, it would be rather boring, unless you have a looooong  shopping list, or you love the night life like mad, booze and more booze.|`|V38kMY3Kaa	One of the best ways to drink in Hong Kong is to have a walk around all the bars first and have a look which ones are doing special offers and what time they run Happy Hour. Most bars have a Happy Hour, which is a cost effective way to drink. Also keep in mind the races on a Wednesday night at Happy Valley race course, you only pay $10 for entry and pay around $100 for a jug of beer. Also Wednesday nights is ladies night, during which many bars in Wan Chai give free drinks to the ladies.     Ned Kelly's Last Stand A really good bar to go for pre-partying. Located on Ashley road parallel to the famous Nathan road on Kowloon side, it's an Australian themed jazz bar with great food and good live music almost every night starting at 21-22, which is about when the happy hour ends. The place is laid out with long tables where total strangers can sit together, it's quite big with the frequent visitors to Hong Kong such as travelling businessmen and the art-community.     Sticky Fingers The awesomest place around? Who knows, but its a nice place to get some women and listen to a great house-band play live rock music on stage. The drinks are pretty good too.     Knutsford Terrace is a popular drinking and dining spot in Kowloon but there are many other places in and around Tsim Sha Tsui. Some of them can get pretty expensive though - up to 50HK$ for a drink in some places.   Joe Bananas A wonderful place located on Lockhart road, where the drinks are friendly and the women are cheap (or was it the other way around?).     Skitz Sports Bar A bar with a good selection of drinks with 2 pool tables, darts and large selection of sports on big screens.     Armani Bar A more upscale bar with great house music in a trendy indoor setting as well as an outdoor section.   Red Bar A mostly outdoor bar at the top of the IFC building (in Central) that usually hosts big events such as on New Years Eve and more.         Blues by the Bay Located on the Avenue of the Stars one would tend to have a drink there while watching the Symphonie of Lights. But the drinks and cocktails in this bar can not be recommended, since the quantities are very small compared to what you would expect for the price.
7a09f0a1575a6fb3adae34957ca25a7caa	Yes, Singapore and Hong Kong are similar due to majority Chinese. Singapore is a mixbag and more like a mini-new york compared to Hong Kong as a mega chinatown. Hong Kong is more vibrant and lively than Singapore. Singapore is more multi-cultural and multi-racial than Hong Kong. Both are some sort of westernised and both are small in size and lack of open-spaces, although Hong Kong is bigger than Singapore as a whole. I think if for Singapore, its true as only need 2-4 days, as for Hong Kong almost for 3-5 days. Yes, both are only cities but Hong Kong have more natural part than Singapore, which have more highrise and condos than anything else, which is worst than NYC. As for nightlife, yes, Singapore is more International acclaim than Hong Kong with big names like MOS and the Clinic Bar etc, as well its own Zouk, with overseas branches in KL and Shanghai, its more to come by. But Hong Kong's is more relax and muxh more chaotic than Singapore, I should say.|`|4c38113c8d557a298cd8900a1ee5fc25aa	Since you have no idea what you are talking about except from biased source. Suggest you stick to Thailand. You can travel to bangkok for city life. Phuket for sun and sea. Chiangmai for its tribal highlands. Singapore and Hong Kong are just cities. Both get boring within a few days.
JQa86WoVaa	Constitutional democratic republic.    and that is.....    A constitutional republic is a state where the head of state and other officials are elected as representatives of the people, and must govern according to existing constitutional law that limits the government's power over citizens. In a constitutional republic, executive, legislative, and judicial powers are separated into distinct branches and the will of the majority of the population is tempered by protections for individual rights so that no individual or group has absolute power. The fact that a constitution exists that limits the government's power makes the state constitutional. That the head(s) of state and other officials are chosen by election, rather than inheriting their positions, and that their decisions are subject to judicial review makes a state republican; should the judicial review be maximized.|`|818a6c4a96262d3d9669cd5c91b5efaeaa	Just enter " Guatemala, government" in the SEARCH bar and you will get many articles in this.

YjFDfp5Paa	6 provinces (faritany); Antananarivo, Antsiranana, Fianarantsoa, Mahajanga, Toamasina, Toliara     There are any number of ways to get around Madagascar, from air to zebu cart (a common form of transport in the back blocks); from pousse-pousse or rickshaw in the flatter towns to taxis-brousses (bush taxis) in the bush. Decrepit buses and sort-of-new minibuses are an alternative to the taxis-brousses between Tana and nearby towns, and they leave from the chaotic taxi-brousse stations. Taxis-brousses are the most popular and cheapest way to get around, and the term is generic to cover any form of public transport that is not a bus or minibus. They are often slow and break down, are overcrowded and sometimes dangerous, but are also usually great fun.    Because of the vast distances and the poor state of the roads, you may want to make some parts of your trip on 'Air Mad' as the national carrier is fondly known. It has an excellent network to over 60 cities and towns, and despite its nickname is a reliable carrier. It also regularly offers discounts of up to 20-30% on internal flights if you have used it to fly into the country.

gfGsXVc3aa	I have never had an issue with Paradise Pier always great things. I have stayed in a theme park room and a standard room, they are very accommodating and if you have an issue they will solve it.  If there is one issue that I could find with them I would say that the elevators are slow, but if you are going up to your room I would take the glass elevator that is in the lobby it is right where the other elevators are and nobody uses them, at least not when we are there. We are big coffee drinkers and they have a coffee maker in the room if you ask you can get more coffee to make or cream, sugar and such. Also down in there lobby across from there gift shop they have a little I guess you could call it like a express snack stand, they have a toaster and microwave that if you are a guest you can use, we always bring are own breakfast food so we take our oatmeal, and bagel and use it in the morning. We also love that all the rooms have a Fridge, we used it for milk and juice and it was so convenient. The beds are all sealy posturepedic and they are so comfortable, we always ask for more pillows although they do have extra blankets and pillows in the closet, and we have them in less then ten minutes. In the lobby the also have hotel info and we have gone to them and said we needed reservation for a restaurant like ESPN or Rainforest Cafe and they call for us and they always seem to get us a reservation. If you are planning to arrive earlier then check in or stay later then check out, they will hold your luggage for you and they take such great care of it, we always stay later then check out and they will hold your luggage till midnight for you because you are still a guest to them. I also love the water pressure and the shower I always have hot water even when someone else is using the shower next to us. Also remember that because you are staying at a Disney Resort Hotel that during the weekdays you get a free newspaper on your door it is great.     Also you said it is your first time so make sure to go to City Hall in Disneyland and get a free "First Visit" button, it will make a great souvenir.     Hope this helps and enjoy ! ~Jena|`|ac7e0f50f58632b431b5cf5de0564ffbaa	I don't know if anyone can say anything BAD about the Paradise Pier Hotel at the Disneyland Resort. Sure, it's not the Grand Californian, but it is what it is. Good location, and the cheapest of the Disney properties. But they still treat you nice, the Disney way. It's nice to go there with my AP discount. Pool isn't anything spectacular, but still nice. It just suffers in Comparison to the Grand Californian across the street.

pgAnh6f7aa	Yes,it began as soon as the Jewish Commission showed up in 1919 making no secret of their long-term goal: the expulsion of the people and their replacement by wealthy Europeans - mostly Russian  and mostly atheists - who would then transform the pastoral beauty of the Holy Land into a landscape of urban sprawl dominated culturally by right-wing fanaticism and virulent racism. The violence escalated with the formation in 1928 of the Jewish Agency and again in 1948 with the conversion of that body into the current zionist regime and the escalation continues without end. There will be nothing but bloodshed in Palestine for so long as the zionists are there. To solve any problem it is a fundamental principle that you return to the starting point. The Palestinians - Christian and Muslim - have been there for at least a thousand years,possibly far longer. We all know when the trouble started. Many Americans worked in Palestine during the Ottoman era but lived on in the region to see  what happened from 1919 to 1949. It wasn't pretty to see a quiet and gentle nation despoiled,ravaged and humiliated by a bunch of fat cats from London and New York by way of Russia.|`|Ic8FLXm5aa	Violence began because of the British Occupiers. Reading history of the 1931 arab riots confirms this. I hope.|`|lXxz4Qpkaa	Yes. I don't see how that could be more obvious.|`|9QBlKlFmaa	That is a common misconception, being propagated by Arab terrorists.    Arab Jews and the Arab non-Jews (Muslims and Christians) were co-existing for around 1400 years.  But this was characterized by Arab persecution of the Jews.  (I have no doubt that some Arab will report me now.)    This must be seen in its historical context, as well as the current situation.    In Tripolitania in 1785, Ali Burzi Pasha murdered hundreds of Jews.  In Algiers, Jews were massacred in 1805, 1815 and 1830; and in Marrakesh more than 300 Jews were murdered between 1864 and 1880.  Decrees ordering the destruction of synagogues were enacted in Egypt and Syria (1014, 1293, and 1301) and Yemen (1676).    Despite the Quran's alleged prohibition, Jews were forced to convert to Islam or face death in Yemen (1165 and 1678), Morocco (1275, 1465 and 1790-92), and Baghdad (1333 and 1344).    Massacre means the killing of defenseless human beings.  The unprovoked Arab attack on the peaceful Jews of Hebron one night in 1929 and their indiscriminate killing was a massacre.  When, in February 1948, Arab workers at the Haifa Refineries attacked their Jewish co-workers on their way to work, and murdered more than 40 Jews in cold blood - that was a massacre.  In both cases, the massacre had been planned and the acts of murder were premeditated.  The loathsome murder of Kefar Etzion settlers by Arab Legion troops, after the defenders had surrendered and were unarmed was another such example.    And today, the Islamist terrorists in Gaza continue to attack Israel, even after they agreed to a ceasefire after they were defeated by Israel.    Israel should fight back.  That is as obvious as the nose on your face.        .|`|uSfStmSdaa	Most of the recent violence did.    No place in the world is 100% peaceful, and that applies to Palestine too.  The British, French and Ottomans fought over Palestine and probably would have even if there was no zionism.      However, since the crusades it had not been such a place of religious/ethnic violence until the zionists started their project of ethnic cleansing and acts of genocide.  Absolutely the zionists started it.|`|KijGRGXuaa	yes ,you are true  the only way to end this violence is by solving the original reasons.|`|mE4SbWIuaa	I will agree only with the idea that Zionists have been a thorn in the side of the Islamists for decades.  This is because of all the movements to break free of the dictatorial authority of Imperialist Arabs, the Zionists are the only ones the Arabs haven't been able to crush and bring into tow with all their terrorism and warmongering.    What you appear to be saying though is that when and if the Jews give up their right to self-determination, dissolve Israel, and submit the authority of Islam as 2nd class citizens (dhimmi) again, then they can have peace.     I think that's extremely arrogant and a blatant lie.|`|wVsjgj35aa	It is incontestable. There were no shortage of visitors to Palestine between 1865 and 1948 and it is described as peaceful and bucolic until the arrival of the Jewish Commision - representing the World Zionist Organization - in 1919. The violence began almost immediately,unsurpizing given their stated intention of literally taking over Palestine and ousting the original inhabitants. Which process continues today in the WEst Bank and Gaza,as bloody as it has always been. If the problem started with the zionist's arrival then it is common sense it will only end with their departure.|`|FcH2ZEkqaa	It most certainly did. Many Zionists themselves say that Jews have been living in Palestine continuously along with the Arabs for 1000's years, but the fighting only started after the Zionists arrived. Cheers!|`|6KaMW1Vzaa	Not really. Zionism was alive and well under the Ottoman Empire. After the first World War, the British and French tried to keep a lid on things with only a fraction of the troops the Turks had used. The Nabi Musa riots of 1920 marked the beginning of a long stretch of Arab attacks on Jewish inhabitants of the area. That also marked the earliest beginnings of people who identified themselves as Palestinians, so if anything, the other side of the coin holds more truth.|`|b8yhcxmRaa	Amen to what you said.  For hundreds of years Christians, Muslim, and Jews lived in peace and harmony all around the Middle East. It ended when Zionism moved in.  Since then, neither Israel or the Arabs, and all three religions lived in peace in that area (and around the world).  Zionism made the Jews hated around the world, and they fail to acknowledge this fact and keep on backing Israel and Zionism.|`|Ac3UkTXYaa	Yes to both.There was a time when Jews ,Christians and Jews lived side by side in the Middle East, in peace.|`|b8ae5eef3b2d61ecb71b1965967306bcaa	In the last thousand years, there has never been any period in history wherein Jews or Christians lived in peace under Moslem rule. The myth of the so-called "Golden Age" in The Iberian Peninsula is a sad falsehood. Christians and Jews were tortured and subjected to horrendous treatment under Moslem rulers. As violent as the crusades were, they caused far less bloodshed than the Mohammedans in that general time period. From a historical point of view, true violence in the mid-east has always been at the highest levels after the advent of Islam and when Islamic despots ruled the mid-east. The non-Moslem Arabs have a comparatively peaceful history (compared to Moslems). The influx of European Jews and Christians was a cause of some peace arriving at the area as they built roads and hospitals for the Arabs; this peaceful period (1880's to 1920's) ended when Moslem massacres caused the deaths of thousands of Christians and Jews.|`|YSK2PbAEaa	Certainly not!    Islam regards any non-Muslim as a "dhimmi."  This refers to Christians and Jews.    The dhimmi condition can only be understood in the context of jihad because it originates from this ideology. Muslim, as well as non-Muslim scholars, from the 7th century through the present, have acknowledged that all the lands from Portugal to Central Asia that constituted the Muslim Empires were conquered by Muslim armies. These vast territories were neither populated by Arabs - except in specific regions bordering the deserts  nor by Muslims.     Around the Mediterranean, the population was Christian and Jewish. Along with other religious groups, Jews and Christians also lived in Iraq, Persia, and Arabia.     Beginning in the eighth and ninth centuries, Muslim theologians and jurists endeavored to give to the jihad  a war of conquest - a religious and legal structure. In the early fourteenth century, churches and synagogues were closed in Cairo and a legal opinion on this matter was requested from Ibn Taymiya, a renowned Hanbali jurist. He confirmed the legality of the closure by referring to the conditions of Egypt's conquest in the seventh century by the Muslims, that is, eight centuries earlier.     A recent report by a senior Palestinian Authority journalist in the PA daily Al-Ayyam documented the decision by masses of Arabs in 1948 to leave their homes in the hopes that they would return once Israel was defeated. "The Arabs who became refugees in 1948 were not expelled by Israel but left on their own to facilitate the destruction of Israel," the senior PA journalist wrote, according to Palestinian Media Watch, which monitors the Arabic language PA media. "This plan to leave Israel was initiated by the Arab states fighting Israel, who promised the people they would be able to return to their homes in a few days once Israel was defeated."    So, you see that the assumptions of the question are not accurate.  And all the answerers who answered in the affirmative either are  hiding the truth or haven't got a clue.      .

And you are right, no security for civilians as long as Hamass uses civilians and civilian "installations".|`|FcH2ZEkqaa	If I was being interrogated by the Shin Bet, I would also say anything they wanted me to say.

(too big to get thru a tunnel)    I saw a video of an anti-aircraft cannon in a mosque already and plenty video of them shooting from schools, commandeering UN ambulances, etc.  They booby trap and shoot from any civilian place they can.  Then they take bloody pictures and cry bloody murder that their civilians have been killed in the crossfire.  Basically using the civilian population for photo-ops to garner public sympathy for them and against Israel.  That's how Hamas operates.    Edit:  As far as torture goes Hamas is notorious for it.  They gouge out eyes, break bones, shoot kneecaps.  Remember in Iraq they kidnapped and tortured their own. They shoved screwdrivers and drilled into eyesockets.  They have a violent society over there those Arabs do. I've even seen beheading videos, brutal.  I support Israel in doing what they need to do to combat that violent society.

9Pdb92Xwaa	Not the United States.    Now mind you nothing is wrong with the United States so don't take it personal,but I have seen how Puerto Rico and the United States Virgin Islands have **struggled** for years just to gain back some of their autonomy from the United States congress and I don't think I'd want to have to go protesting everyday just to have a say in my government like they've had to do.... NOR would I want to have to worry that my house will be used for Navy practice like Viaques island.    Now if this were actually proposed...  I think past proposals of looking into political union with Canada might be better....    The West Indian Fathers of Independence in the region all have considered political union with Canada. I think the Caribbean and Canada have far more synergy in terms of political structure and so on.    For example Canada is the same--- political structure pretty much as what was the (British) West Indies Federation.  So for example you have "Premiers" which are in charge of their own provinces.  E.g. you have a "Premier" of Alberta... A "Premier" of Ottawa etc...  So instead of having for example a "Prime Minister" of Barbados, or a "Prime Minister" of Saint Lucia etc. During the West Indies Federation we had a "Premier" of Barbados and a "Premier" of Saint Lucia which were themselves provinces of the West Indies Federation.    In Canada they maintain their own parliaments too in each of their provinces in addition to the national or federal parliament.  And I think this would be a deal maker or breaker for Caribbean countries.  No Caribbean island would want to give up their current Parliaments and autonomy... Canadian Provinces also have **far** more autonomy in their Federal Government than the U.S. states do with the U.S. federal system.    For example Quebec's pet-peeve is they want to retain their own French culture.  That is their deal breaker... They also want to maintain their own immigration policy that is separate of the rest of Canada... As such, I believe the Caribbean islands if they said to the Canadian Federal Government that they want to keep much of their own culture and retain like some say in their immigration policy I believe the Canadian government would probably let them do so.  Meaning Canada and the Caribbean would probably be more likely to come up with a power-sharing deal instead of a take over deal which the United States is more likely to want.  And to come back to the French language a few Caribbean islands (Saint Lucia and the Commonwealth of Dominica quickly come to mind) they too have French speaking minorities which might find they are able to relate to Province Quebec in political tie-up with that system.      Another thing too, the United States has 300 million people! The English speaking Caribbean (including the British Territories) only have something like 7-8 million people... The English speaking Caribbean would be inundated by sheer size of the United States...    Canada on the other hand has like 30 million people which is still kinda big but that only means there's roughly 2-3 Canadians for every Caribbean person.  vs. almost 40 Americans for every single Caribbean person today!    In the case of Canada with the Caribbean their combined population would be roughly ~40 million which would mean that both regions together would still have less people than Colombia (44 million ), the United Kingdom ( 60 million), France ( 65 million ), Germany ( 82 million ), Mexico ( 106 million ), Japan (127 million), Brazil ( 190 million ), etc.  But it is not overly large where both side could not adapt over a decade or so.    The tax structure in much of the Caribbean is the same as in Canada's also in terms of VAT etc. so those systems would lend well to one another esp. since provinces in Canada are free to set their own VAT rate and Caribbean governments might be able to do the same...    Canada also has nationalised health care too like many of the former British colonies in the Caribbean do. This could be interesting for both regions.  For one thing Caribbean nationals needing more unique or specialised medical treatment would be able to go to Canada to have it done.  And in return Canadian nationals living in the Caribbean during the winter would be able to have their Federal Canadian health insurance cover them in the islands and so on.    The Canadian Federal Government also has a built-in option for un-happy Provinces of Canada to leave the Federation if they choose.  Something that doesn't usually seem like an easy option for parts of the United States.  When the southern states in the United States wanted to secede from the union the north waged civil war on the south to keep the whole country united. Currently the Caribbean is the most peaceful region on earth I don't think it would be wise to upset that.    A group in Guyana had planned to put forward the idea of Guyana joining the United States. ( Their website http://www.guyanausa.org/ ) They said that one of their big draws- for that idea is since Guyana is close to the equator and thus experiences faster rotational spin of the Earth they could be a new hub for the United States' space research industry. NASA...    Personally though the only- G8 country that doesn't have their own  space launch pad already is Canada... Europe already has one in South America(in French Guiana).  And frankly if Guyana was doing space research too along side French Guiana which is close by that would mean they could share or cooperate in space research for the Europeans too IMHO...    I donno, I just think if the Caribbean joined the United States those egos in Congress would strip all of the rights away and make the Caribbean answer to Washington for ever more.  I think Canada would be more understanding esp. since tha|`|fv2GAAdPaa	No i would not want that because i like individuality s highly favored stated.

df20f780e29b5cda4abf6f0d9f61d5baaa	Some advice:    1. Check out www.couchsurfer.com  - you will find plenty of people all over the country who will befriend you.  Many will let you stay at their place free, but even those who do not will be helpful to you. Plenty of single women just like you or young couples.    2. Get some audio books - mp3, CD, whatever your medium of choice is.  Get books related to your travel - Life on the Mississippi or the story of Lewis and Clark (Undaunted Courage) or the journals of John Wesley Powell or On the Road or de Tocqueville or something about the Oregon Trail.      3. Camp a little.  State campgrounds are good.     4. The great national parks in the west are awesome.  Arches, Grand Canyon, Bryce, Zion, Yosemite, Glacier, Yellowstone.  Plan to spend more time in these and hike some of the back country trails.  See some sequoias and redwoods.  When you drive from LA to Seattle, do some of your driving along the coastal highway, but don't miss Yosemite.      5. Go slower, see fewer thing but get to know a few areas deeper.  Really, I would recommend you cut your itinerary by a lot and spend more time in  a few places.      6. Try to stay at a farm or two.  Do chores.  Know real people.     7. Take a good camera with the ability to take wide-angle pictures.  Take a tripod and really work on becoming a good photographer.  Make an album of your trip when you get home, or keep a blog of your trip as you go will all of your pictures.     8. Have some purpose or goal, maybe some question related to your college major that you are trying to answer or research.  Do some geneology or just google to find people who have the same last name (if it is unusual) or the same first and last name as you, or your parents, and go interview them as your project, especially people who are quite old.  Take pictures and make an album and show them to each other.  They will be thrilled.     9. Depending on how adventuresome you are, you might consider doing the trip by bicycle.  Of course you couldn't do the whole thing in one summer, but you could design an awesome 1000 mile trip to do in 75 days. You could bike all summer and never leave Utah and have a wonderful trip.   Or hike the Pacific crest trail.    10.  Join AAA.  Have a cellphone.  Know how to change a tire.|`|epBvBNUgaa	No ur not crazy...  1st & formost, stay focused on ur main goal..have lots of $$$ for gas & minor repairs(flat tires, ect)..get a good map w/directions..stay away from cheap motels..recommend motel 6/microte/motel 8 just to name a few inexpensive ones...get a friend to go with if possible..don't drive more than 10/12 hrs per day..take short rest stops to stretch ur legs/potty..

Some people may not be able to drive as long periods as others so make sure everyone is comfortable with the arrangements.   Secondly make it fun. Have lots of stops along the way and check out things you are curious about not just planned destinations.   My friend drove across country a couple times to move from nj to cali and he made a list of places in the midwest he always wanted to see and he hit them all up.

If you chose to do it online and didn't click on that option, but rather standard mail, then they usually arrive with 48 hours of the show. However, since you just bought them, then they may not make it in time. Call ticketmaster to find out for sure.

See site below for all passport application information.  You will need to apply within a day or two.  Pay the etra fee for expediting and the express mail fees too.  it takes about 3 weeks standard processing and 2 weeks expedited..and since the time is close, it would be better to pay for expediting.  See 2nd site below and read under "Entry Requirements" to see that you do not need a visa for a visit of up to 90 days.

Port Douglas is a bit more upmarket so it would be more expensive. On a modest budget you would be best off staying in Cairns. Most reef trip companies have free shuttle buses that will pick you up from the city or sometimes you can even catch a boat up to port. Have a look at the below link for a list of resorts in Cairns. Staying in Cairns is probably the better option anyway, there's a lot more to see and do! It's very central to a range of places including the rainforest, beaches, family restaurants and nature walks. At every resort or hotel there's tons of brochures for you to pick a snorkeling trip best suited to you and your family.

Booking early with advance full or down payment may help too.  Or you could go on line at places for deals--Priceline, etc.

db4364cbdfee80cd73b4e6424bc57dfdaa	If your intention is sexual tourism, please don't come to Brazil.  We don't want that  type of  tourist  here.    Recently an American group  was arrested, they came to Brazil and they hired prostitutes and they filmed the women. All were arrested by violent attack to the shame, for you not  have an unpleasant surprise if it comes to Brazil  come with the intention of to know beautiful places and to amuse healthily.|`|FpT7x2VVaa	I suggest you get your dad to hire a safe, local (in your hometown) hooker for you and lock you up with her for a week. That should get it out of your system, and you can then in future appreciate women as equal partners.  And you will also realize that bare breasts in public (many places in this world) and tiny bikinis on the beach are not necessarily an invitation. As a stranger, it will take you a long time anywhere on earth to get to know people.    it's like many people here on this board trying to figure out how to get roaring drunk as fast as possible. where have the parents of these poor folks missed??|`|AA12264271	Your question is ... weird, to say the least! If I understood you rightly, I must let you know that women in Brazil are as respect-worthy as anywhere else. People who come here merely 'for sexual encounters' are frowned upon, and subject to local ire. Don't have yourself fooled by the fame of the past: Things have changed quite a bit here.|`|de2523155edd3e47290a1798e3f1282eaa	I agree, we are respect-worthy and we don't want this kind of tourist here.

I find it rather disrespectful that brazilian women are thought of like that. You will of course find prostitutes here like everywhere else so its alot cheaper to get a hooker where you are instead of paying to go to another country in search of that. If you are willing to pay to get to know the city and its people then thats a different story. Rio de Janeiro is an exciting city, theres always something to do.

I don't agree that WJZZ didn't have enough listeners. I know of at least two businesses in my neighborhood alone that played it continuously. Someone please tell me why we need another R & B station in Atlanta. I had a relative visiting over the weekend and he even said that he wished he had WJZZ in his home town. The station appealed to a wide variety of listeners. I'm 40 and listened to it 75% of the time in my car and it was almost always on in my home. My kids who listen to R & B most of the time, loved hearing it on the way to school each morning. They could both hum along to Boney James, Steely Dan, and Anita Baker! This morning there's some garbage on the "new" station that I didn't even want them to hear. So sad. I'll be writing RadioOne to express my disapproval.

AA11016555	I can tell you what I'm doing as a Canadian tourist going to Japan in November... Actually, it's really not that different from what a regular tourist might do anyways. We just planned the trip to take advantage of the autumn colours, since both myself and my girlfriend are nature and nature-photo fans.     We're going to be taking a two-day jaunt from Tokyo to Nikko, which is a sort of mountain resort town with what look like some very beautiful and photogenic locales, including the Kanmangafuchi Abyss, Jakko Waterfall, Lake Chuzenji, Kegon Waterfall, various temples and shrines, and the Edo Wonderland Nikko theme park/historic village. The day after we get back to Tokyo, we're going to head to Mount Takao (after going to the Studio Ghibli Museum, since I'm an anime nerd too) to hike around there. If we had the time and money, I'd love to actually stay out in the Tokyo suburbs for a little bit and enjoy the more rustic hill country. Later on in the trip we're going to overnight in Kyoto, which will involve tours of Nara and Kyoto, as well as our own side-trip to the Arashiyama Monkey Park.    Otherwise, we're doing what is probably the standard tourist fare: Ueno Park, Asakusa, Odaiba, Tokyo Disneysea, Akihabara, a Yakatabune dinner cruise, an Oiran show, a tea ceremony, hopefully Harajuku on a Sunday and a final swing down to see the Great Buddha of Kamakura before catching our flight back.     I don't know how long you're going to be in Tokyo, but one of the things about Japan's rail system is that whole other parts of the country are only a day-trip away by regular rail or bullet train. You could easily leave Tokyo in the morning to go to somewhere like Nikko or Kamakura and come back in the evening.|`|T7vuRDCVaa	Picking up chicks is an international all season sport my friend!|`|qjZN1Znuaa	ANy thing fashion shows, resturants, and ultamite shopping palces like louis vuitton gap and top stuff.. if youre into that stuff art musem
Pr3QIlweaa	You can buy them at most grocery stores (at least in my area).  But why would you?    Have you ever read the rules and restrictions on those things?  Seriously?!  :-)    I went to buy one (well...actually...eight!) this past Christmas, and the store clerk alerted me to all the fees and whatnot.  She told me to go to a Money Mart (http://www.moneymart.ca/find_stores.asp ), and buy one of the Mastercard gift cards.  I did do, and there are almost no rules or restrictions.  (I believe the activation fee for a $100 gift card is $5.95.)    Both Visa and Mastercard have activation fees (when you buy them) and both charge about the same.  But that's it for the Mastercard.  The Visa one, on the other hand, has fees for checking your balance on the card, or calling to talk to a person for assistance.  There's even a fee to cancel the card...if you can believe it.    So, based on my very limited experience, I would suggest the Mastercard gift card.  But you can easily decide for yourself, by reading the rules and regulations on the back of both cards, and comparing.    While it's great to be able to give either a Visa or Mastercard gift card that can be used just about anywhere, most places accept both Visa and Mastercard, so there doesn't seem to be too much benefit; one more than the other, in that regard.|`|jgWLQU3Gaa	In the US, they are sold in the following stores (click link below).

IjbFXj2xaa	Transportation in Ecuador is done primarily via bus and car, both intercity, and inter-provincial.  Unlike the United States, owning a car can be thought of as a luxury for many, considering the high costs associated with importation.  besides cars and buses, taxis are also a very popular choice for many; a ride across town usually costs only between 3 and 5 dollars.    The Quecha indians are native to Ecuador, primarily concentrated in the high sierra regions around the capital city of Quito.  They continue to be a powerful political and social presence in Ecuador, and the Quecha language is the other official language of Ecuador (besides Spanish, of course.)    Between those three instruments, i'd pick the charango for your homework, however a visitor to Ecuador is probably more likely to encounter the Siku, which is a type of pan flute.    Statues of the Virgin Mary are nearly ubiquitous en Ecuador.  Many barrios will have small simple corner shrines where it's not uncommon to find fresh cut roses placed neatly around.  It is also not uncommon to find simple shrines in the house that encompass a small statue of the Virgin Mary.

Korea once was colonized by Japanese militaristic imperial and many Korean were sent to Japan semi-conpulsorily to take so hard physical labor with very lower wage.  Under the annexation into Japan, Korean  were forced to learn Japanese as national language in school and worship Japanese Emperor those days.     It was really anti-humanitarian misdemeanour because those days, many Western countries did same thing on to undevelopped third world as Africa, Asia and/or South America. Only the difference thing for Korean is that Japan is also Asian and neibour country of them.    During WW, Korea was just a part of Japan. Korean keep remember the shame.  They came to be  very prideful people much more than before because Japan gave them education as same as Japanese.     Most of Korean learnt at first how they were so misery they lost their own nationality through Japanese Imperialistic education ironically.    In 1945, Japan surrendered unconditional ito the Allied Nation n the war and Korea was then liberated. Many Japanese who were in Korea as cononial privileged classes were deported back to Japan. They were lost everything as same as Japanese who were in main land of China.    On the contrary, korean who were in Japan being under depressed slavery condition turned themselves to be sort of winner without any effort as same as Korean in Korea those days all in sudden. Some of them went back to Korea but many of them stayed in Japan to make a illegal profitable business in the circumstances as neo-privileged class in the loser country. They came to be kind of mafia status for the occupation army era in Japan. Japanese police had no control on Korean those chaos days.    After Korean war ceased, Korean government tried their citizenal unity more  tightly then, politically, they educated their citizen how Japan had bee cruel and cold-blooded as brainwashing so persistently. The passionate prideful citizen often became to be brainwashed easily.    For Japanese, the past was past which was true and they recongnized it was bad but they have also bad experience to remember is different angle to Korea.    1) North Korea's abduction of many Japanese to let them spy and/or Japanese teacher for their profit. It is one of worst notorious behaviors   performed by one country after WW in the world.     2) Dispute on territory about the small island in the Sea of Japan. Korean government doesn't want to carry this into the international court but has been occupating against the official protest from Japanese government. The attitude avoiding any negotiation seems too childish for many Japanese.    3) Korean's culture such as narrative tone, accent or words and their passionate character(very short temper, violent and arrogant), also the smell(garlic) are also some points of reason why Japanese don't like but these are their own culture and Japanse must understand those better.    Anyway, Japan never ruined South Korea.  Actually North Korea almost became to ruin South Korea before.    I think Korean and Japanse must understand each other more friendly and seriously. There are too many misunderstanding and ignorance with malice in both of them.|`|OTnSwNwZaa	If what you're saying is true, then it's for the same reason that whites hate Blacks: superiority complex.    Japanese accept koreans much, much quicker than Blacks though.|`|vS80xcoHaa	I don't know. I noticed it too.|`|dbAWPWzraa	Talking about Korean people in Japan, as angry black man posted, situation of white and black in US is kind of similar, I think. I don't always agree to him, but sometimes he make a good point.    But Korean and Japanese look very similar, so discrimination is transparent (difficult to see) in this society. Japanese people can pretend there is no discrimination and say " we are homogenous nation".    Please note Japanese people are not all that racists.  Korean movies, tv dramas, songs are very, very popular in Japan.    On the web, you can find many, many rasists! They are extreme, and common people are not like that. They are not the majority.  Don' t trust in what they say. They sit in front of PC, jobless, nothing to do maybe.    Two nations which are close in map, it is common they sometimes hate and like each other, don't they?  How about Canada and US?    (Black people are not so hated in Japan as angry black man says.)|`|d2f1c9545ed4c110bb4a655ee098e488aa	Hatred of Koreans is not so strong. Some Japanese become disgusted however, when they see things like anti-Japanese protests in Korea on the news or they hear that Koreans don't like Japanese. I think anti-Chinese feelings are stronger in Japan than anti-Korean, because Korea exports popular culture to Japan, particularly dramas and music, so some people think Koreans men are sexy. These are often elderly Japanese women, though.     When they say they dislike Chinese/Koreans, most of the time their only reason is, "Chinese/Koreans don't like us, so we don't like them." Most of these people are also unaware of (and don't care to know) the reasons why some people in China/Korea dislike them. It sounds really immature, but when you take a step back, you can see this in other nations.  For example: How many Americans hate the French (and vice versa) without knowing how it started or why such a trend began? How many do you suppose are interested in learning the history? Much the same type of attitude, isn't it?  It's not the same sort of feelings as people who say "I love Italy, but I hate Italians" (of which there are many). Those claims are made after many bad experiences with Italian people (not that I am saying it's nice or right, but bad experiences can at least be used to explain the hatred). There is often not travel experience involved with people who make claims about Korea/China. Actually, the Japanese I have met who have been to either of these countries tend to have quite positive views.    As someone else stated, the "hatred" is not so strong in Japan. Many Japanese do not really think much about Korea, so they don't really have strong opinions of like OR dislike; it's just another country to most people.|`|hEA7LwC4aa	Probably many Japanese reply as "because they hate us", I suppose. And it is probably true that at least Korean media dislike Japan. Nobody can love persons who hate them.    Personally, I'm tired to hear pride of Korean persons that is too strong. Sometimes, it seems like chauvinism.  For example: Some Korean historian said Daifang Commandery, ancient Chinese colony, had not existed. Some Korean said Confucius was not Chinese but Korean. Of course, they say Japanese culture originated from Korea. They may be thinking everything originated from Korea.    However, some Japanese also are chauvinist. I regard these chauvinists of every country as crazy persons.|`|sHpTGIHYaa	Maybe because the Japanese so often get mistaken for Koreans that it becomes annoying.|`|fYFNTbHbaa	they always hated each other for various reasons.  such as this http://www.occidentalism.org/?p=46|`|iLwwFfTdaa	Anti-Japan of South Korea .     However, Japanese who like Korea is more than the Japanese who hates Korea according to the investigation of Japanese Government.|`|NlejhFRRaa	Why white people look down on other race?|`|VX0coxeDaa	Mr. Rabbit is right, most Japanese do not really think much about Korea, Arab, America whatever. They are just another countries  Most Japanese only mind their own business.   In my opinion, Japanese are strongly individualistic in a way,   Most Japanese could care less about the others, I think that's because we are not a religious nation.|`|P3rWcBaZaa	Oh, please stop generalizing... I'm Japanese and I have Korean friends. I do not hate them! If I dislike any Koreans that's not just because they're Korean but becase who they are.  I just don't get it... How did you arrive at that question?
P1ccKKHyaa	I love both of these cities. They definitely have a busy city vibe.    San Franciso has golden gate park, alcatraz, fishermens wharf, the transamerica pyramid, golden gate bridge, chinatown, japantown, and more.

nEgJAtK7aa	It will be a good place for you. Any of the places that accept college/high school students will be ok. They will be crammed with spring breakers and you will have a good time. Just be careful. I know someone last year that was drugged the first night and robbed at Senor Frogs. They even took his shoes. Do not carry a lot of money on you and make sure you never carry your passport lock it up in your room. You will have a good time|`|hSOYndoxaa	Check out the reviews:  http://cancun-hotels.tripadvisor.com/Hot...
q0rGhf0vaa	Oh my! It depends where you are going. But if you are going to Shanghai or Hong Kong you can get cheap, fake versions of major designer clothes. On our last trip we went looking for purses and sunglasses. We got Mont Blanc glasses, watches, and bags, Channel glasses and watches, a Prada jacket and TONS of other stuff.     Be very careful though -- when you ask the price, you might get an answer back like $500 yen --- generally you should counter back with maybe $100 yen.  Remember, these are NOT the real products, so only pay what you would pay for a regular old purse back in america. For example, a Prada purse might cost you $1000 in america. But if it didn't say Prada on it, maybe you would pay only about $20. So, do the math. Thats about 150 yen.     Clothes can be difficult to buy --- the sizes are quite different, so you probably shouldn't try to buy for anyone else. If you are an average sized 13/14 year-old you will probably find some beautiful clothes that fit you well.    DONT buy DVDs or video games. Also, you should stay away from electronics. You can buy cheap fake iPhones and stuff, but i wouldn't do it if I were you. Plus, these would be things that customs officers could take away from you once you come back, so I'd stay away from that kind of thing.    Also keep in mind that the quality of 'fake' stuff can be very different. Most of the streetside shops sell stuff of pretty low quality. The higher quality fakes (and some things that aren't fakes, but have probably fallen off the back of a factory truck, if you know what I mean) are usually in back-room types of stores. This would be pretty dangerous for a 13 year-old to go into, but you might be able to ask your guide for some advice for 'good quality knock-offs' --- he will definitely know what you mean, and could probably take you to a safer, better quality place. Once you are there, examine the quality, the stictching, the zippers, the placement of the brandname. In these backroom places, you would generally pay a little more, because the quality IS better than the streetside stands.    Aside from that, there are lots of options for t-shirts, boardshorts, hoodies, stuff like that.    Typical 'souvenirs' are tea, silk and pearls. But once again you want to be careful with it. Make sure you ask your guide questions about how you can figure out if something is real, or of good quality.     Above all, enjoy your trip and have fun. China's a wonderful place, and the people are generally very nice. Be respectful of their culture, their traditions, their way of life and their government, and you will have the most amazing experience of your life.|`|1LlhqADoaa	depends on what you need.  There are All kinds of goods as any other country.  If you want  something specialty. you can buy  local goods|`|3EN5uttwaa	just buy whatever you fancy.  just remember to bargain.  about the customs issue, check on the customs authorities website of your country.  your teachers will brief you about that on the pre-departure briefing.  ask them if they did not tell you.      some things that you can consider buying:  - chinese stuff  - chinese tea (good as gifts to parents, aunts and so on)  - forget about food stuff, you might not get used to it.|`|UB4APTseaa	Clothes and accessories! Chinese clothes are awesome :) Also you can buy lots of girlie stuff like cute plush toys, pencilcases, hair accessories, etc. Have fun there!
77qHoaIUaa	I live in Hawaii and I go to the north shore a lot [particularly haleiwa]. Boards vary from 15+ dollars per hour, it all depends on the quality/length/type/place. Lessons can also vary by the hour, so it all depends on where you go. I would probably bring $100, although you may not spend it all, you don't want to be short on cash. If that sounds a lot to you, just remember, you are surfing in one of the most beautiful places in the world.     p.s. I would check out Waimea bay. It's a beautiful beach with a huge rock to jump off of [very fun]. Also, if you are going in the summer, there is a great chance that you will see a bunch of dolphins.|`|mzn6JQ8Iaa	in Haleiwa they rent sponge rubber boards, softer when you fall and very bouyant.|`|8dd8e579fd621e4b4affcc8b80072b8caa	First you have to rent the board about $20 per day or by the hour.    Instructor can be $30-$40 an hour. Make sure you get the professionals and the amatuers are not good. Ask for references and check out their business.    Costs can vary depending on which beach.|`|N0E6WlDuaa	Right now, you would not learn to surf on the north shore as a beginner.  Try honolulu . . . Maybe north shore in the summer, but it can be often flat.  Learn to surf in honolulu, more specifically, waikiki.

Other hotels that claims to be five star doesnt match the five star standards.     Westerners live in Airport residential areas, Abelempke and East lagon areas.

JoC6dlASaa	Hi Liz,  Can I ask why do you want to me to Australia? It wil help with the answers.  I am an American who has been living in Australia for the past two years and yes, it is a difficult country to get into, it will be difficult to move overseas ( it is a big big move and decision ). I agree that it would be less expensive and easier to get your vet tech degree in Wisconsin and then just transfer it here. But please give us some insight as to why you want to move here and I can provide more detail.|`|5WP9rLTlaa	Do your training over there if you want to become a vet tech!  over here it is a really expensive course of study and studying in America means you woud only have to do bridging courses here. Cost of living is dependant on where you live and I've never heard of it being more expensive for non citizens, only that it can be more difficult for non native born residents to do things like get a job or accomadation.|`|pcHp7Dgkaa	It's really difficult to answer questions like yours without coming across as negative and unwelcoming but there's no point in softening our answers to the point of misleading you.     Australian immigration is firmly restricted to people with qualifications and experience in occupations in which workers are needed here. The government publishes lists of required occupations and if you're not qualified for a job on the lists, it is impossible to get a work visa, no matter what you do.  Here is the basic list and you'll see that Veterinary Technician isn't on there.http://www.immi.gov.au/allforms/pdf/1121... (this is called the SOL). Veterinarian is on there and so are a number of other jobs for technicians, but not the one you want to do.    Thousands of American students come here every year to study at our excellent universities and many of them qualify for permanent residency and stay on after they finish their courses but that basic requirement of needing to work in a required occupation is still there. If you can find something on the SOL that you feel you would be happy doing, that is your best chance of being able to stay here. For many jobs, you would need to find an employer to sponsor you but that's much easier if you do your studies here.    Now, for the costs.    TAFE Diploma courses for international students are around AUD$15,000 to $25,000 for most courses leading to a SOL occupation.  University degree courses over 3 or 4 years are around AUD$20,000 up to $45,000 or so per year depending on the course of study.    The AUD is currently worth around USD$1.50 so you should multiply the above prices by .666 to arrive at an approximate USD figure.    Of course, on top of tuition fees, you'll also need accommodation and living expenses and our immigration people will expect you to show that you have at least AUD$12,000 per year for those and you may be able to get a student loan from the US to cover everything. International students ae allowed to work for up to 20 hours per week during the semester and unlimited hours during official vacations.|`|yoM5iFDpaa	It is expensive to study in Australia if you arent a citizen because they charge the fee up front instead of paying off. Where abouts in Australia were you wanting to reside because I can give you the TAFE (Tertiary and Further Education) number and they would be able to give you an idea of prices to study here. Rent in Sydney areas is approx $200 per week (australian dollars) for a 1 bedroom but could be a bit cheaper depending on the suburb.|`|90tPT5nlaa	I'm afraid she's right, it is very difficult to get permanent residency in Australia, you need a skill in short supply in Australia. I'm pretty sure vet tech is not one of the skills on the list, but veterinary surgeon would be. You could get a student visa though, but once your course was completed I doubt you would be eligible to stay (unless perhaps you got married). It doesn't mean you're not welcome, we just have strict visa laws.|`|Fnp2MIycaa	I remember reading your previous question.  Did you actually look at the link the answerer gave you?  It is for the Australian Department of Immigration website.  You will be able to find out all about Visa requirements etc just by navigating around the site.  Here is the web address again -  http://www.immi.gov.au/students/    No it is not easy to move here but don't let that stop you trying.  Go for it, you can only do your best and try. Good luck.|`|OvJpK2Zsaa	sorry you thought i was bombarding you but i was only stating facts, australian immigration is restricted to skilled and experienced workers who's occupation is on the skilled occupation list  Veterinary Technician is not on the list  http://www.immi.gov.au/allforms/pdf/1121...    or by studying for at least 2 years and obtaining australian qualifications ,to do this you will be classed as an international student and tuition fee's can be 10,000 a year in some cases    these are the only visa's a student studying in australia can apply to become a resident after graduating in australia  http://www.immi.gov.au/skilled/general-s...    i don't know what visa your mum is talking about,i cant find a temporary 3 year visa    anyway look at the site and maybe try the visa wizard to help you  http://www.immi.gov.au/visawizard/
VzJQUCPIaa	Might check out Adventure Island on Beach Blvd. While spring break is probably too early for the water park to open, they still have go-karts, mini golf, laser tag and the arcade. The planetarium at MOSH usually has a laser light show on Friday and Saturday nights, if you're into that sort of thing. If you're golf fans, there's World Gold Village and the Hall of Fame (plus the IMAX theater there.)    Regarding casino cruises, AFAIK the only one operating out of Jacksonville right now usually has both a evening cruise on Saturday and an afternoon on Sunday (it sails out of Mayport, so it's a fairly short drive from Amelia.) However, they usually only have 1-2 tables of poker at most (and only if there are enough players who request a game before sailing) and it's a cash game, not a tournament (because they have a strict limit timewise of when they can play), with buy-ins around $300 or so typically. An alternative might be one of the dog track poker rooms (one off US1 between JAX and St. Augustine and the other just across the river in Orange Park off I-295). They have low-stakes limit HE every day and NL tournaments periodically (I believe their weekly Sunday afternoon one is something like a $50 buy-in.)
TdrpIkl4aa	How about Tenerife Playa de las Americas, i went there when i was 19 (now 22) and i really enjoyed it. There is a very laid back atmosphere there compared to Ibiza and places like that. The night life is good, there is a water park which also has a very good dolphin show and many other daytime activities. One day a week there is a market. There are many boat trips on offer, i went on a glass bottom dolphin spotting boat trip which i enjoyed. You should research it on the internet this will tell you more.   i am going back to Ibiza this year i just love the amazing nightlife.    hope this helps.
FMmncxToaa	I work for an airline, and standby tickets are very expensive. Your best bet is to do your research now,shop around for deals, because late August is a high demand period for vacationers. If you wait for the last minute, you will end up paying an arm and a leg. You want to have a stress free vacation, so now would be the best time to do your research.Good luck!|`|6egxGam6aa	In theory, you *could* do this, but since you're traveling with your family, I think it would be better to plan a bit in advance (primarily accommodations for the three of you).    Why not take a map and get your daughter to close her eyes and pick a spot at random? That way, you'll be able to book airfare and a hotel in advance. The element of surprise will still be there if you choose not to plan out where you're going to eat, what you're going to do, etc. Just play it by ear, as they say. :]    Have a great trip, no matter how you go about doing it!
AA12353784	I've been living in Sydney for the last 2 months and believe me don't come here for work! If you are arriving in Sydney, enjoy the sites, stay in hostels and head off! The best places for work at the moment are Darwin and Perth.   If you work in construction, don't automatically think Oz is going to be better..  Sorry for painting a negative picture but work for people particulary on a working visa is difficult to get.|`|OvJpK2Zsaa	working holiday makers usually do casual jobs like bar work,restaurants, fruit picking etc as they travel around the country    this site should help you out    http://www.immi.gov.au/visitors/working-...|`|23vKOyBraa	No. But there are places called "Temp Agencies" in every city that specialise in finding people (not just working holiday makers) short term jobs. But, with the current economic climate, and thousands loosing full time jobs, it is hard to find the type of work you want.    By all means come here, enjoy, but make sure you have enough money just in case you can't get work.
e2ce7648e805da82fa05dfe521fd930faa	I would agree that moving to South Carolina is a better option than Florida.  I also think Florida is overrated.  But that being said, Hilton Head is not the cheapest place to live.  Real Estate and the cost of living is a bit higher there for some reason.    Daytona would be less expensive.  But in SC, you should check out Bluffton (near HHI) and even Beaufort (the county seat).  Both of them would be great alternatives and still close to Hilton Head.  Good luck to you :)|`|e053d35694c9b45844ae2fafd8dc3ad4aa	South Carolina. Florida is overrated and more dangerous.
e494ab4084c7eee796fa8044a9d3484faa	Thank you "h" again, for referring dog-owners in Dubai to me.    First of all, owning a dog in Dubai is like anywhere in the world, yet you have to note for differences in the following:  - Dogs are not permitted in public parks or beaches  - Dogs tend to be considered as filthy to most Muslims.    Bear in mind that you have the whole desert to enjoy with your dog.    Both "h" and "hand_borst" have surpassed me in informing you about essential matters that I was aiming to mention:  - Like anywhere, you need the permission of the landlord to bring in a pet  - You have to make sure that your dog can withstand temperatures (Extremes of >> Winter:8'C - Summer:45'C), otherwise, like me, I have a dog home that has built in A/C and is switched on 24/7 half of the year (when the weather's hot). I can refer you to customized dog house companies, and how you can prepare your home for a dog in the hot weather.  - www.dkc.ae are the most experienced in Dubai, they know how to deal with "everything" for global transport of dogs and cats. They will help you with all the required papers too. On the other hand, we have other companies such as Pet Zone that also offer transport and paper services.    * Moving on, from your side, you are obliged to add the "municipality tag" on your dog's collar when your dog is not at home. If not placed, you may face fines. This municipality tag complements your dog's built in microchip to identify the dog and the owner; it will also help you if the dog was lost. Municipality tags can be found at all public and private veterinaries.    Please get in touch with DKC (www.dkc.ae) they will simplify all the hassle. As I remember when dealing with them, my Golden was a little puppy, and it cost around 2,000-3,000AED for all the required preparations for a round-trip to Geneva, Switzerland.    If you ever want me to clarify, or have any other question, please feel free to get in contact with me through additional questions and/or email (provided in my profile).    Best of luck with your lab!|`|AA10523012	Yes, dogs are allowed in the UAE in general, but please take two things into consederation:  1. you need the permission of the landlord and  2. the weather    Most dog owners, especially when owning bigger dogs, are living in a villa and not an appartment. A Labrador breed needs long walks, it will get HOT in the summer time and you will have to find a place to walk the dog. "Fanano" hopefully will help you out on this.

vfqaiqvfaa	So you're just wanting to visit for a short amount of time, not permanently, and you still want to work while you're gone..?  That would be something that you, your manager, and the manager of another location would have to discuss.  Does Starbucks allow store to store transfers?  Also, you'd need to find out if the other location in South Florida even has any positions available.  I doubt right now very many people are going to be willing to cut their hours if the help is unnecessary.  I can see why you would like to continue working while you're gone but it may be more work for management to make it happen....can you not accrue vacation time that you might be able to use to visit your family?  Sorry I'm not much help, but good luck and hopefully it works out =)
R2iCzRjsaa	for a first trip, do the tourist things, take the tours available.  Don't think that you are going to do something no one else has ever done or you'll probably not enjoy your trip much.    Bangkok is good for a few days, I think, of heavy duty touring.  Start with the Grand Palace complex and use the other tickets you get when you go there (long pants required, or they will rent you a wrap).    It really depends on the length of your trip.  Pattaya is fun to see, seaside, nicer weather.  I like staying in resorts at AoNang Beach, Krabi, going on day trips to the islands from there, including a day trip to Phuket.    I don't know why ANYONE would want to go to Hat Yai,  and Pattani has had social unrest.  Esan is difficult for a tourist to enjoy without friends and a car to show you around I think, (but I love it).  Chiang Mai is OK for a couple of days only if you are on a short vacation.    Thailand is too big and diverse to see in one trip, even a month.  It's best to enjoy a few areas, and then come back again to see more.  One can be overwhelmed with temples, also.  Limit yourself to the number of temples you tour, or they'll all begin to look alike. Average a couple a day, is my suggestion.  Have fun,  the people are wonderful, it's safer than anywhere else I've been, but at the same time, do be a bit careful of your belongings, don't bring a lot of jewelry or flash large amounts of money.|`|qUiQF8x3aa	You will have to be more specific in what you want to do.

bzfXbM4raa	Laos is a very laid back country, with generally very nice, and trusting people.  I think it's well worth the visit.  After a busy Thailand, Cambodia, and Vietnam, you'll find the pace in Laos to be very relaxed.  A good time to recharge those batteries.    The capital Vientiane has some nice French restaurants, and of course Lao restaurants, and great street food.  There's a few "disco" clubs there.  It's alot of "tame" than say Thailand.  There's Buddha park, that features many old statues.    Vang Vieng seems to be the backpackers paradise.  One particular activity there is to take a rubber tube, and go down this shallow river, stopping at nearby "river bars", have a few drinks, get back on the tube, stop by another bar, rope jump into the river, get back on the tube, stop by another bar, etc, etc, etc.    I'd be happy to e mail you a few photos of my trip there last year if you want.|`|iLwwFfTdaa	 year ago , I took the train from Bangkok toVientiane.

There are two official languages, French & English.  There are 10 provinces and 3 territories.  There are six time zones (Pacific, Mountain, Central, Eastern, Atlantic, and Newfoundland).  The population of Canada is roughly around 33 million.  90% of Canadians live within 200km of the U.S. border.  80% of Canadians live in cities.  Toronto is the largest city in Canada, and the fifth largest city in North America (behind Mexico City, New York, Los Angeles, and Chicago), and the only Canadian city in the top 20.  Population density of Canada is about 3 people per square kilometre (as opposed to the US's 31 people per square kilometre).    How's that?  ;-)    P.S.

9QBlKlFmaa	It's been sixty years that Palestinians have lived in Gaza and the West Bank, that's a long time in which they could have done what Israel did in the same time, built cities, government, infrastructure, their own hospitals and factories.    When Israel won the war, in 1948, they got a sandbox for their troubles, one about the size of New Jersey.    In sixty years they worked their behinds off, building and making themselves a home to be proud of.    All the Palestinians have done is lived in squalor and reproduced little warriors to be martyred.  They could have taken a different path, but they chose this one.  Their Arab brothers, swimming in oil money could have invested, or built or contributed, but all they do is send arms.  Doesn't that tell you something? Egypt left the wall up across the Sinai that the Israelis built twenty one years ago, Hamas had to take it down, but then the Egyptians put it back, they don't want the rebels fomenting discontent in their country either.    Israeli children live with bombs and suicide bombers too, and in constant fear of getting on a bus, or going for a pizza and dying.  In the Gulf War the Scuds came every night to bomb, and Israel wasn't even fighting anyone.    It was Islamic men who flew planes into two office buildings and the Pentagon on 9/11 and then it was Islamic men who danced in the streets of their slums to celebrate the dead Americans.    And now that the Gazans have broken the ceasefire and resumed shelling Israel, they leave Israel no choice but to resume bombing, to eliminate Arab terror once again.        .|`|i7oHTo9haa	Well, for one thing, nobody can tell a sovereign nation that they cannot defend themselves.  To "allow" Israel to continue bombing is not the correct terminology.  It is not international territory therefore it is not international decision.  Israel has the right to defend herself. Just be firm about that and don't back down.    Try watching Netanyahu video.  He said no country would ever wait 8 years like Israel did.  He said no country would wait 8 months. He said no country would wait 8 weeks.  He said no country would wait 8 days.  Israel has exhibited extraordinary restraint. Then watch Hamas video *in their own voices* to see what they are all about. They are Islamofascists run by Syria and Iran.    Netanyahu King David Hotel  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XqECWfh4i...    Hamas In Their Own Voices  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i08L09V0_...    Also, more facts are that 77.69% of the Palestinian men and women voted in Hamas who's purpose is to destroy Israel, Europe and the Americas    84% of the Palestinians support violence on innocent civilians (Yeshiva Massacre, 9/11) and danced in their streets after both events.    94% of Palestinian children have been victims of domestic violence in their own homes by their own family members.    They have a very violent society and Hamas is their spokesperson...  There are very few innocents in Gaza when one looks at their mindset and the numbers. Until the time that their violent society is addressed Israel is perfectly correct to maintain them in Gaza and control the damage that they cause on Israel and to prevent it from overflowing into the rest of society. Israel is actually doing the rest of the world a service to contain them there.    Israel offered them Gaza in a land for peace deal and left greenhouses for them to grow food.  They could have had jobs from those greenhouses but they dismantled them right when they got to Gaza Strip and now rely on humanitarian aid.  Israel built Tel Aviv out of a sand dune from scratch.  The Palestinians with all the foreign aid they have received have squandered it and had they not caused war could have been in their own skyscraper in Gaza by now.  All the Palestinians have to do is put down their arms and we could have peace right now, is that so hard?!  Apparently yes, because they are such a violent society!    Edit:  Just read previous answers to mine, the first one is worthless, sorry dude.  Israel is controlling the waters with int'l help, the egyptians vowed to control the tunnel that was left open (for humanitarian fuel) and nobody wants to control Gaza not even the Egyptians. The second one is spot on though.    Cool Facts about Israel  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I5tDDkvXS...|`|6KaMW1Vzaa	As a formal proof, it isn't hard. They returned fire. What appears to be civilian areas off-limits to bombing is in the CAP (circular area of probability, for the bombs or artillery rounds used) of valid targets, which means that it's legal and proper under the Geneva accords.  Whether it's the wisest course is yet to be determined, but that's a different question.|`|Ic8FLXm5aa	The IAF has realized that bombing the tunnels is useless in the long term because they will be smuggling in arms in different ways (i.e. by ship). The only pros are a substantial decrease in rocket fire for a temporary time. The long time pros are nil, I suppose. They will not continue to bomb tunnels anymore. Truly, they want to control all of Gaza, like they do in the west bank. Notice how there were no terror attacks from the west bank. This is partly from occupation and partly from humiliating Arabs militarily in that area. Gaza was not controlled militarily so it "resisted". People seem to believe everyone's rhetoric these days.|`|eyJqrqn7aa	Rockets from Hamas is reason enough.    They are rebuilding tunnels and storing more rockets already.  Do you think they are just collecters or do they hope to use them again.  Israel should pound them to dust if they start shooting again.|`|54fdf2affdc8dc366315eec2cecd5920aa	If Hamas continues to bomb Israel, then Israel will be justified in bombing Hamas again.    Also, if Israel knows where there is a large cache of Hamas weapons, or a Hamas weapons factory, or a place from which Hamas is shooting at Israel, Israel would be justified in destroying those.  Hamas has not shown any inclination to peace, so Israel is justified in this much.|`|fukzl8oaaa	The last thing the Israelies want is to  control Gazza..... And if they did, without terrorist reactions, they would make it a rich and beautiful area.  The day Hamas  stops the rocket attacks the bombing will halt.

TcgUVcYwaa	Avoid the roads in France, they are all toll roads. Travel via Dover-Calais, then to Dunkerque, through the Benelux countries (Brussels, Aachen) and from Cologne on down the Rhine valley to Karlsruhe, mainly using A61/E31 in Germany.     Calais-Garmisch is about 9 1/2 hours using this route, about the same time and distance as going via France. I think Cologne or the area around Worms would be a good stopping point for the night. Depends how long you have to drive to get to Dover. Plan about 2 days for the drive.    Note that the stretch of the Rhine valley from about Bonn down to Mainz is considered to be very romantic, if you'd like to drive slowly and enjoy things a bit use the B 42 or B9 road that runs parallel to A61 between Koblenz and Bingen am Rhein.    One word of warning regarding traffic jams: Watch out for the start of the school holidays in the Netherlands and in Germany. The route I described is the number one route for Dutch and German drivers with campers heading to Italy.|`|xp7jk4RTaa	why don't you google it in google earth and it will show you the way

t7qcjqWIaa	I've always found it easiest to start packing early, so that way you're not still packing boxes at the last minute when your moving help arrives. Start with the things you're not going to need for a while, like books, albums, pictures, stuff like that. Go to your local grocery store/walmart late at night when shelves are being restocked to get free boxes. To save space, you can use either t-shirts/towels to wrap your breakables rather than bubble wrap/newspaper. Clearly mark each box once you've packed it, so your moving help can put it in the right room. Speaking of moving help, try to find your help in the form of friends/family early, so you're not inconveniencing anyone...hope this helps, good luck :-)|`|TRvAhhNKaa	Get rid of any unnecessary books because they're heavy, a pain to move, and expensive if you're not moving yourself (lots of weight). Also plastic bags from Target/Walmart makes great packing material especially with dishes/fragile stuff.

That way, youre not hauling around a bunch of stuff that you could do better without. Plus, a little extra cash never hurt anyone!

If youre looking for a great moving truck as well, Penske is by far the cheapiest at the moment. Good luck on the move !

I3rjYVUFaa	You're in for the trip of your LIFE!!    I used to live in Sylvia,Kansas, (about 33 miles west of Hutchinson), now in Missouri...    Summer of 2007 took my kids & went West. Pikes Peak is about 16 hours from Kansas City if you go NONSTOP, that's just Colorado. We rotated drivers...I would guess it'll take you 2 days and nights driving to make it to Utah...IF you have a month, I would say to do ALL the driving you can in daylight hours, you're going to LOVE the scenery.   If you drive at night, you'll miss Colorado. GEAR DOWN when you go down slopes...They're MARKED on Highway with signs, but you'll burn up your brakes if you keep them on for 7-8 miles at a time...DOWNSHIFT.    Utah has no dirt, only rocks (just kidding, but not really...) Hwy 89 goes North & South and is scenic ALL THE WAY.  Bryce Canyon, Canyonlands National Park, Zion National Park, Arches National Park,White Rim...You CAN'T go wrong. There are rock formations in Utah UNLIKE anything ELSE on earth...    YOU MUST stay up all night at least once;  we did this in Bryce Canyon. I'm NOT an astronomer, but people in the Midwest who have not been there don't understand...It has to do with the LACK of city lights AND the higher elevation, and lack of pollution.  See, here in Missouri or Kansas, on a CLEAR night, you can see maybe 2500 stars with the naked eye...In Bryce Canyon, Utah, on a clear night, you can see maybe 8 to 10,000 stars WITH THE NAKED EYE. This is public information published in the Park informational brochures given out FREE.    Why don't you drop down Hwy 89 into Arizona and visit the Grand Canyon? It IS one of the Seven Natural Wonders of the World. I spent $400 for a twenty minute helicopter ride for myself and my son, and would do it again in a heartbeat.    My advice is to buy a digital camera (if you don't have one already)...Every night, after dinner in our Hotel, my son or I would download the pictures from the day onto my laptop...I have about 3,000 pictures from our trip. Priceless.|`|csYnTVeGaa	I am from Utah and go to Wichita every couple of years. I love Kansas.    Like the guy said before. Make sure you see the national parks. Zion, Bryce, Arches. You will be close to the Grand Canyon so be sure to see it as well. Goblin Valley and is cool as well. Bring a good pair of shoes and a day pack. There are some amazing hikes.    If you make it to northern Utah. Antelope island is very cool. There is a large Bison herd on the island that is fun to see. Also Down Town Salt Lake is very nice. Temple Square would be worth the visit even if you aren't mormon and it is very peaceful.     Have a wonderful trip, buy lots of maps and souvenirs OK, thanks.

If he's an expert in that field he may help you.|`|Lmw6dtQvaa	This is a web page that shows how much each dish is worth...    http://www.replacements.com/webquote/WYN...      Should help you. I hope it does.
6egxGam6aa	No, you will not need to recheck your bags on the way to the UK. They'll probably arrive when you do.    On the way back to the States, however, you will have to go through a Customs and Immigrations checkpoint at the first American airport you land in. You'll have to retrieve your checked bags and recheck them (there will be signs and airport/government personnel to assist you; just follow them/ask for help if needed).    To be on the safe side, take at least one extra outfit (especially underwear) in your carry on, and bring a travel toothbrush and toothpaste (don't forget the restriction on liquids, gels, and aerosols in carry on baggage: http://www.tsa.dhs.gov/311 ). I also suggest bringing any fragile electronics (cameras, MP3s/iPods, and the like) in your carry ons.    Have a great trip - I must admit that I envy you! Enjoy your vacation in the UK. :]|`|23vKOyBraa	I'll only add to the above good answers, this is only the case (you not needing to re-check) if your original ticket is through to UK. If, for some strange reason, you have got two tickets, one ATL-ORD, then another ORD-UK then you might have trouble. But, I can't think why you'd have two tickets, although some people do for various reasons.    Simply ASK when you check in in ATL - say to them that you are going to UK and what will happen to your luggage. The staff will tell you, and you will see them put a sticker on your bags with "UK".|`|fukzl8oaaa	You do not have to recheck your luggage.  Just make sure when you check in at the counter they check it to your final destination.  They do seem to lose luggage more often now but they always find it and will deliver it to where you are staying in the UK.  What you should do is take a small carry on and put a few things in it in case your checked bag is lost for a day or two.... Chances are it will not be lost|`|FVtWpqfxaa	NO|`|p5CrZ5Bwaa	You shouldnt have 2|`|WlYknD5Vaa	nope, since your layover is domestic, you dont have to clear customs. whenever you have an international layover, you have to clear customs and recheck your bags at each different country.
L6w8YmoOaa	you gonna put that stuff in the bag you check in|`|54tW840Oaa	all liquids must be 3oz or under and put in a 1 oz ziploch bag, most make up is fine as long as it is not a liquid base but lipstick I think is considered a liquid bases but its probablly not over 3 oz|`|bnm9BfxDaa	you have a better chance at crashing a car than a plane. don't worry|`|c97b11f063d5417bc2c001b07d58e097aa	Just put all your makeup in a plastic zip lock bag neatly..put it in your suitcase and put clothes on top of it so that it will have protection around it.

Make sure your items fit this criteria and you should be fine.|`|IK925thzaa	You can bring them on the airplane as long as your liquid is no larger than 5 ounces or it will be confiscated. Im a frequent flyer and I see women put make up at their seats all the time. Trust me and have fun at your trip|`|9oCrDNe2aa	Liquid things, soaps...etc..can "explode". Some shampoos have been known to do that. I haven't had to many problems. Do you have a Food vacuum seal? If you do, seal all your products in there, and they will be safe.     You can't have liquid things over 3-5 oz, or there is a big possibility that it will be confiscated.     If you have that Glad seal and press wrap, that may work.  Just make sure all the air is out.    Write your name and number on the bag, just in case, and call the airline and ask to speak to someone who knows about this kind of thing. It's likely that they have dealt with this sort of thing many times.|`|Ba6SSkzBaa	You can carry your makeup bag, but if you want to take a carry-on and purse as well, it's usually not allowed. However, cosmetics cases count as a purse, so you can just put all your valuables in the carry-on bag and leave a purse in your check luggage.    The make-up artist is right. You should use the plastic, and try to keep your stuff upright- turbulence can disturb it, even if the pressure doesnt.    If it doesnt follow the liquid rules- check the face scrub.|`|67115b1163cc8b9c69bf180fdf940ed7aa	hey..Ooh that's nice ur going to Egypt..u should go in the summer :)  i've been there nice place for a vacation..    well this also depends on what Airlines ur going on ya, like Emirate air wouldn't let u take perfume that's more then 30ml with u :(  so it really depends on what airline they could not want you to take makeup with u..  but most airlines r just against people taking in liquids so maybe ur foundation or something.. but Eye shadow and the rest of the makeup bag should be okay i guess :)   i took lots of makeup and my NAIL POLISH like every colour..Lol.. coz i can't like without it.. i put my nail polish with my luggage, but my makeup i took it with me in my make up case..and got through just fine..   don't worry bout it.. just don't take too much perfume and u'll get through for sure..    Good Luck..have FUN|`|6egxGam6aa	You can and should carry your cosmetics with you in your hand luggage. Any liquid or gel cosmetics need to be in containers that are 3 fluid ounces or smaller and must be placed in a quart-size, resealable baggie: http://tsa.gov/311  Your facial scrub would need to be in a 3 fluid ounce container (check your local Target or Walmart).    Any powder foundations, eyeshadows, or pencil liners wouldn't need to go in this bag.    Have a great trip.|`|3hIr3Dllaa	you should be fine    your daily scrub counts as liquid so you need a travel or >3oz package of it.    I've never had that issue with my eye shadow, but I suppose it never hurts to take extra precautions|`|WlYknD5Vaa	yeah, you'll be fine. most of the time they really dont check it that much. i always bring all my makeup in my carryon. just to be safe, put it in a plastic bag.    oh and btw we know that a best answer is 10 points.|`|AA10816488	All your make up and liquids under 3 oz (sorry the daily scrub is 5 oz) need to all fit in a quart sized ziplock bag and you can carry that on. You need to check the daily scrub or put it in a smaller bottle.|`|A54FZOjQaa	Anything liquid has to be able to fit in a baggie  You cannot take hairspray, or lighters, you cant take eye liner because the brush could be dangerous, there are a lot of rules and its complicated.  Whatever airline you choose make sure you call first to find out what you can take and what you can not take, don't fly skywest at all they suck|`|3tu88JTgaa	The TSA has rules on what you can and can't bring onto the airplane. If you are unsure, just leave them in your luggage and you'll be fine. http://www.tsa.gov/travelers/index.shtm|`|WUVGFINnaa	you can have one carry on during a flight so id get a bag or something and put that in there along with the stuff you want to carry on for entertainment|`|9f5985366e1c1ff46ce53256d1a9c626aa	Your best bet is to call the airline you intend to use.  Everything has to be in (I think) 3 oz. containers now. Im not sure the pencils and powders would be allowed at all. But your intended airline can tell you these things.  Sorry I couldnt be of more help.|`|cp38lX51aa	Wellthats kind of a tough question to answer. This website should help you out http://www.shefinds.com/blog/index.php/w... Also though there are some recent prohibitations on gels and liquids so they might not be aloud if you carry those items.|`|jZm8h2Fkaa	Ive only flown maybe 6 or 7 times. Out of country. It depends on the air liner you are taking. Usually, cosmetics are considered personal belongings, so yes. If it fits in your carry-on, you should be able to take it. As long as there isnt anything metal/sharp/liquid, it should be perfectly fine to carry onto the air plane. As for the cracking thing. I doubt it. Aircraft cabins are pressurized so that the air remains breathable in the cabin. Sure there is small pressure changes, but nothing strong enough to break anything. Youll just feel a slight sensation in your ears.|`|Uo16H34Aaa	They wont let you take more than a bottle of water and like a 6lbs purse and highly drought they will let you take a lot of makeup on board    Sorry|`|6a8Tj6gJaa	look i would not take that. Egypt has a lit of political unrest so its best for you to go as light as possible. Egypt also tends to be very hot since its a freakin desert. so its best to go light even if it means suffering for a few days|`|01RA3LH9aa	Yes! You can bring that stuff on the plane and i know how u feel. You will just have to explain and show them what is in the bag. Oh and about the eyeshadow pressure thing.. yes that is true. the same thing happened to be when me and my husband flew over to Ireland.. it cracked because of the pressure. I wish i knew about the GLAD bag thing. =) hope this helped|`|A0iYhhUFaa	All of that stuff will have to be in your checked baggage. Sorry to say it but you will not be able to have it as your carry-on. And about the eyeshadow I would go ahead and do what your friend said and cover it...never hurts to take extra precautions! If you are worried about a lot of things about flying just search on yahoo for what you can and cannot take on a plane.|`|2jnpvyzaaa	i think this is false .but make-up shadow does breack so yea try putting it in a sandwich bag ect.. and also u can take ur make up with u . i don't see why not.|`|LuIsLQH2aa	Yes, you can bring your cosmetics on the plane. Bring them in a bag (handbag, purse, etc.). If you want to bring it with you in the seating area, you just have to put the bag through a scanner and they'll look at what you have in there. Also, bring socks as they make you take your shoes off. After that you go through a metal detector. Make sure you put all of your jewelry in the bin before you do, because then it just gets into a big mess if the alarm goes off. I'm not so sure about the makeup breaking from pressure, but I'd try that just to be safe.|`|0pkAFo8vaa	EDIT-I'm amazed at the number of people saying you can't take "any" liquids on a plane...I think we have people answering who have never flown before.    No problem about the "worry wart behavior" miss.    Here are the rules. Brushes, lip pencils, stuff like that? You can keep that anywhere - you could have it in your pocket for all they care. Only liquids and gels are limited items.    As for the liquids and gels, here are the rules:  -You have to be able to fit your cosmetics within one quart-sized bag with a zip-top. (a ziploc bag will work FINE).  -Any particular bottle should hold no more than 3 grams (yours says 1.5 grams so you should be fine there).  -If you have any flammable liquids or gels, you MUST store those in your luggage. You cannot bring anything flammable on the plane.    If you cannot fit all your stuff in there, you will have to put some of it in your checked luggage (the stuff that goes in the bottom of the plane) rather than your carry-on-luggage (the stuff you have with you, either stowed below your seat or in the container above it).    As for the "covering makeup in GLAD" thing...I don't know the answer so I say do it, because a bit of wrap isn't too hard to manage. Better safe than sorry, right?    Also, a little tip from me for long flights like yours: get up and walk up and down the aisles if you can or you'll have a lower chance of cramping up and stiff after the flight.    Have fun in Egypt!    BTW look at my source if you want more general information on what to do with liquids and gels.|`|kk384VMLaa	Um.   Definitely if it's liquid, if it goes over the limit (I think 3 oz) you can't have it on your carry-on bag.   However, if you check in your luggage, it can be in there. =D    And as for pressure: probably.   You can get to a pretty high altitude.     Overall, I'd say leave the make up in the check-in bag just in case.   I just came back from a trip to DC, so I know by experience. =D
YLqVv7Lzaa	Ice hockey is a relativley unknown sport in the UK, definitley not as popular as the 'big three' of Football (soccer), Rugby and Cricket (and maybe less popular than darts and snooker) which regularly sell out 80,000+ seater stadiums.    However, there are teams and stadiums in various cities across the country (virtually every sport has at least one) which usually are not purpose built and double up as ice rinks when games are not being played. I can't imagine they hold more than 2-3,000 people.|`|AA11349530	we have ice hockey teams and they play tournaments etc ... but it is not big here like it is in some other countries ... they usually play on ice rinks around the country which only hold a few hundred spectators ... you rarely see anything about ice hockey on TV or newspapers, about the only time I really notice it is when the winter Olympics is on
23vKOyBraa	A standard university (college to you) degree is 3 years full time study. A post graduate (Masters) degree is generally 1.5 years full time study. There are exceptions of course.    You need to decide what you want to study first, before choosing a university. We have international students in ALL universities here. Once you have decided to study law, or medicine, or teaching, or .... whatever, then yes some universities are better for that.    There are some general top universities (Australian National University, University of New South Wales, and numerous others), but for my money I'd rather go to a university which has an industry reputation in the FIELD OF STUDY that I'm doing.    Try to attack it that way.    Cost? That's hard.... so many variables. Round figure? AUD$10,000 a year for uni fee only (plus books, plus living etc). But don't tell anyone I said that. It differs wildly.|`|s2IOyj8iaa	All our universities are excellent. I know on the Gold Coast in Queensland we have a huge amount of overseas students  at the private University  Bond also at Griffith University   http://www.bond.edu.au/  http://www.griffith.edu.au/international...   Sorry i can't help you with price and that will depend on your courses|`|543fe29cb1621f5aa1191836b9cfb2b2aa	I assure you that Australian Universities are good and they are said to be one of the countries with good quality education; actually Melbourne University is on the Top List.   International Students don't need to worry because each Uni is like packed with people of different cultures. It is so diverse, hunnie.  Uhm the prices really range from $40K to $60K depending on where you are and which course you're taking. Generally, Universities on the west coast cost higher.  Most courses run for 3 years, full-time studying.    PS:  Accommodation is so expensive.

3C3Mev6maa	Not less authentic but then again I believe a Jamaican who is born and raised partially in Jamaica automatically has the accent, now whether or not they choose to make that accent evident I feel is up to that person.    Sometimes when you are in in Rome you have to do as the Romans do, otherwise you are stereotyped, if you know what I mean.|`|lcj1AKt1aa	A Jamaican is a Jamaican regardless to if he has the accent or not.

There are some things that he should know as a Jamaican.|`|fuxx93P8aa	i shouldn't be answers think because i'm jamaican but if we never had the accent we would still be authentic because of our style of music our location on the equator and our style of foods not to mention our athlete's       and no  it has never come up but i am glad you asked it|`|WE94mze3aa	i dunno about what is right or wrong, what should be etc.. i just know what is, in my perspective.:D    to me if u are born and raise in Jamaica an you have nooooo accent whatsoever (it is sometimes hard to point it out BY a jamaican but by other people it is easy) i do think of them as less authentic yes. definately. i would auto-think that person is trying to separate themself from Jamaica  and ally with the place where their accent is from. hence, the person is ashamed of their heritage in a way isnt it?    for those people if ppl dont know them they are called "Foreignah" and not "Yardie" .  (keep in mind this can also describe someone who has migrated, in JA they are Foreigner, but Foreign they are Yardie)..     if the person doesnt live in jamaican from adolescence and even a little beyond that, i dont expect them to have an accent, u live what u learn (this is why ppl who live in jamaica auto have jamaican accents).     would you expect an indian  (from india, living in india) to have a jamaican accent? if he had jamaican parents only, but lived indian in an indian community, school etc|`|44dcc209645e25a90756133f2c64c1e5aa	no, nope|`|TrjiIiPHaa	nope your still jamaican no matter what

fIK9LBEuaa	I would try Costa Mesa.    For southern California, the housing is cheap. There are grocery stores close by; its not very far from the beach; it has a ton of other shopping, and being in such a suburban area; anything you need isn't very far away. It's also located in Orange County.    It is "technically" a 45 minute drive from L.A; but as I'm sure you know I wouldn't be surprised if it was realistically a 2 hour drive from the city in heavy traffic. And It's a 5 minute drive from Newport Beach. This makes it a reasonable commute to L.A; good for jobs.    As for the people; 39% of the people who live there are ages 25 to 44; many of them have children. The median income for a family is $55,456; just so you can compare that to yourselves.    That's my suggestion to you, my sister lived in Huntington Beach, and got tired of paying unreasonably high rent, and having a huge cost of living. She and her husband moved to Costa Mesa (cheap, cheap rent for SoCal), she said it's a great family town and perfect for what they were looking for. I've been there many times; and its really a great place to live. I really suggest you put it on your list of things to consider!    Good luck! :)    Try this website for close shopping: http://www.orangecountyshopping.com/cost...

And we also have more nature-filled things (such as the American River, Folsom Lake, etc.) ...Sacramento is also reasonably priced compared to the other big cities I mentioned above, but there is a lot to do despite what other people say.  You are also close to Napa, SF, and Lake Tahoe!    I know someone who has a small $800k house in SF...they can get a big house in Sacramento for that same amount.  And there's always good job opportunities here, especially political jobs since it is the capital after all.|`|lztLa9FGaa	omg you can sleep over at my house dude! haha, small towns like the one i live in are like less than  100,000 people.. there are a lot of small towns you could try.|`|HPRlEWu1aa	dude cali is huge .. i live in socal and its really not that expensive .. im 2 blocks from the beach, next to a trainstation but its not that loud at all. and live in a 1bd private home not like condo appts. and pay 875 a month. not too hard to find a job if ure really lookin. can diego isnt that bad, if ure willing to stay like in ocean beach maybe or like in between ob and sd. alotta jobs in sd of course, but u gotta look. id suggest trying to get a job b4 u come out via internet . we moved out here from jersey, had no job n place... found an appt within 5 days of being here and got jobs maybe a month later|`|TIH01UJoaa	I'm doing that with my friends to Italy.. but not RV cause ya know.. the whole fact of that ocean...

6egxGam6aa	I feel the same way. I'm not one to argue when a plane is grounded because of crosswinds and lightning and visibility issues. I recall being delayed due to thunderstorms in my destination's area, and our pilot issued a statement that I could not agree with more: "It's better to be on the ground wishing you were in the air than in the air wishing you were on the ground."    I could understand being upset about being late for a vacation, but better late than never, you know?    People confuse me.|`|1TKfwDGsaa	Maybe, but selfishness is unfortunately human nature. I wish it was an epidemic, as you say.    People don't get too many days for vacation each year. If you miss a day of vacation you aren't getting that day back.    What you're saying is true but the passengers' reactions are understandable.|`|23vKOyBraa	Yes, the world around me sydrome, so true. However, trying to peel the onion a bit, it seems people who pay $1,000 (or whatever) for a flight feel they DESERVED something special for that. It is a lot of money for them, and they want value.    But, $1,000 to an airline is like 1 cent to you and me, they don't care. I think this is why so many people whinge and complain about things, and why they have to have chicken because the beef is all run out. It's an expectation based on the high value they place on the ticket price.    The more you travel, the less you become like this, and are able to sit back and laugh at those kinds of people.|`|5N3odm3Qaa	Frankly, delays only slightly bother me when I don't get wireless, the snack and food vendors are closed, and/or I'm traveling alone with a lot of luggage that I can't leave unattended. I dislike being shackled to my baggage but otherwise I'm okay with delays. They're a part of travel. I get way more annoyed with traffic jams because I know that 99% of the time it's pure human stupidity. When planes are delayed, it's usually pretty valid. A disorganized airport is nothing new to me so I'm not surprised when there are too many planes for too few runways. I hate being ON those planes, actually. Flying privately does eliminate a lot of the issues with commercial airline delays but it's obviously not an option for everyone or every trip. I haven't done that in recent years thanks to the multitude of Learjet (and other small plane) crashes.    I'm much happier on the ground anyway. I would be the happiest person alive if I never had to fly again.|`|Qtys8AiTaa	I think one problem is that when there are bigdelays/cancellations what can happen is very little accurate information is passed out through accurate clear information portals. Often staff members (ground staff, airline staff, whoever) go to small groups throughout the airport and start telling them what is happening.  Which means that lots of groups may hear the same report (eg "no flights will be leaving the airport) but they often get changed somewhat eg "no jets will be leaving the airport" "no jets leaving the airport within the next three hours". After 3 hours those people are wondering what is happening with their flight. It is like a bad game of chinese whispers. People start hearing about some people being let on flights, others not, some getting accommodation, some getting food & beverage vouchers etc.     I honestly think it is the promulgating of information that is a problem for many people. They don't know what is going on.

uKWcgLLoaa	You're looking at places mostly in and near the mountains--places like Startup, Skykomish, Concrete, Leavenworth, Cle Elum. Unfortunately, they are all small towns or villages, not "good cities" as you seem to be wanting to find, which are near Seattle or Vancouver. The first three are about midway between the two cities, although they are very small. The last two are larger, nice towns, but are quite far from both Seatte and Vancouver.    North Bend (on the way to Snoqualmie Pass) might fit your needs, though. Nice town only about half an hour away from Seattle and probably gets two feet of snow or more every year.|`|fukzl8oaaa	Sounds like Spokane|`|HcjCdLehaa	hehh hehh. I live in Lacey and we got close to a foot this winter in December. On the olympic penensula(Sp?) it usually snows a lot. And by Enum Claw but that's close to the cascades(ACTIVE VOLCANOES!! DANGEROUS WHEN ERUPT! MUDSLIDES EVRYWHERE!) So you might want to carefully consider. Washington is a terrific state.  The eastern side has REALLY hot summers and tough winters they get about 2 ft of snow...but over here in the west, we are almost the oppisite but our winters aren't as bad..

I read some of his articles written in Japanese and heard him speaking Japanese (his pod-cast). I, as native Japanese, can guarantee that he's pretty unbelievably fluent in Japanese. I believe you can do it too if you really try!|`|4dfbcf738541ddcd8d3291d2dbbb44deaa	Sure, there's a chance. But it's all up to you. And realize this kind of thing will take years...It all depends on your effort and learning ability.Try to get involved in your local Japanese community if there is one. Like a Buddhist church that has Japanese congregation.  Watch Japanese TV shows.Rent Japanese movies.It won't be easy by a long shot, but it is possible.See what kind of books/ Cds they have at the library.Have a web cam? Look for a Japanese friend on line.|`|VHAqpggPaa	all u do is get somthing like rosetta stone  and lern  ps heres a tip=kawii=cute and ero ero=pervert or sexy or perverted|`|dbAWPWzraa	Going there is not the only way.

If you can get your parents to agree to let you go (if that is one of the obstacles) and the other things hindering you, then try,  http://www.geos-japanese-insti.co.jp/eng... , you can take a short summer course there if you can go....Also, look to see if there is a Japanese language school near you...or try working in a Japanese type store...and self learn through books and audio...watch japanese dramas on ... www.mysoju.com (where I watch all my dramas , I highly recommend "Lovely Complex", "Gokusen", "Hana Kimi", "1 Liter of Tears", "Nana", etc)...other than that, Good Luck!!!!!!!!|`|AA11286432	Yes you can.  The exact how to is variable and dependent on your location, but the key point is language use and immersion.    While I was in college, we spent the majority of the time in class speaking and interacting in Japanese.  This is especially true once we were into the 3rd and 4th year.  We had many Japanese friends who were exchange students and between us langauge students and the exchange students, we had many oppurtunities to use the language.  This may sound dumb, but we actually tried as much as possible to communicate between friends in Japanese.  That is key to interact and use the language as much as possible.  So how to do that without going to Japan?  As I mentioned it may take more effort on your part to find a language preservation club or society.  When I was in college I had stumbled across such a society for French.  A few of my friends were quite fluent and they had not lived in Japan.  It is fair to say that most of us had visited Japan once during college.      Reality is, in my case I was transferred to Japan and I can say that the pressure having to interact in Japanese really forces you to improve.|`|62deca1d37dad9f560583c21f5dd1721aa	Well first thing you need is to make friends with some Japanese people.    Second Thing is GETA AKA  In other words get a denshi jisho or Japanese to English electronic dictionary.    Try to watch Japanese tv every day if your cable provider gives you that channel.    Figure out what is your favorite kind of TV Show.    Then find a Japanese TV show that is similar to that.  I don't think movies will help as much as Tv Series will because with a TV show you need to watch the tv show actively over 10-26 episodes and that can be very helpful in learning new vocabulary.    Also Try to visit A Japanese Restaruant to be able to order japanese food.    Some tasty Japanese food is,     Shabu Shabu ( a hot pot dish of really high quality beef)  Sukiyaki   (a sweetened beef dish     Okonomoyaki - Japanese omolette dish with EGGS, savoy cabbage and meat, fish and vegetables of your choosing    Yakisoba- Japanese noodles with vegetables and meet in them|`|AVPf5nJPaa	nope almost no chance  in my opinion

Do you think maybe the road was slippery and the driver was unable to control the vehicle?  Why were you out driving if conditions were bad enough the road had to be salted, and on a bridge which will freeze first?  Sounds like maybe he HAD to be where he was, in a dangerous situation, and was doing his job so you could be safe. Would you still be complaining if you slid on that bridge because no truck had been there to salt it? Sounds to me like you are lucky you didn't get smashed. I bet that driver needed new underwear after that happened.|`|XT3uyW5kaa	In VA, you could contact the department of transportation, or VDOT itself. I'm pretty sure it's the same in all states, so try that.
6qsTmMQaaa	I suggest you go to see a fun show called Fuerzabruta in downtown New York. It is very fun! It's almost like a club, but there's no age limit!

Here is the official website >>> http://fuerzabrutanyc.com/    ~~~~~~    BAMN! AUTOMAT:  http://bamnfood.com/    This place is REALLY fun at night...there are usually a lot of people near by, and you could meet some cool people there. It's not a sit-down-have-food-brought-to-you kinda place. You get your own food; it's like a convenience store, but with vending machines, sort of. I definitely suggest it.

L1HVLylMaa	Our tobacco is the best in the world    Since I don't smoke, I don't know how much they cost|`|vl6OtBfWaa	I returned from 2 weeks in Cuba on the 25th of this month I returned with 2 boxes (50 Cigars) of the Romeo and Julietta variety the best is Cohiba but I believe the 2nd best is Romeo and Julietta I paid $93.00cuc per box for a total of $186cuc. The cuc is convertible peso the convertible peso is pegged at the US dollar so they would cost an American $93.00 dollars to buy a box.  I am Canadian and with the exchange the boxes of 25 cost about $130.00 cdn.    And yes the Cuban cigar is the best in the world bar none.|`|CZwJJetyaa	Well you can't just buy them because of an embargo, best way is to get in contact with someone that can go to Cuba (usually people with relatives in Cuba or that go for humanitarian reasons).  A few years ago the cost for a box of Cubans was no less than $150 bucks and about $15-20ea if you buy just 1 or 2.  Not sure why Cubans are the best, but they truly are only ones that come really close are from Dominican Republic.|`|wM9Vt4iyaa	Cuban cigars are of high quality. I visited a cigar factory when I was there last . they take great pride in there cigars. They are illegal in the U.S.A. But if you want to smoke one you can come to Canada and enjoy a sinful cuban cigar or else come here and board a plane to cuba , smoke a whole bunch and never speak of this trip to your american friends.|`|AuvMZYTSaa	They are 'special' and 'prized' only because of the 'Forbidden Fruit syndrome'.    Cuban cigars are not any better than Honduran, Nicaraguan or Dominican cigars - just different.    As to cost - they run the gamut from inexpensive, machine made/handfinished bundles like Jose L Piedra to expensive Edicion Limitada's from Cohiba.
2FsNdcXEaa	I've been to Phoenix 3 times. It's really hot, but I love Arizona, and I'm not a heat type of person! I think it's really pretty there, they've got amazing scenery and sunsets.

I've lived in Phoenix for 15 years and I've never seen a snake or scorpion and I've never HAD to speak Spanish. If you're coming for college then you may leave during the summer aka the worst time to be alive in Phoenix. The only time it's humid is in July and August when it rains a lot. I do feel like I'm sizzling away from June until October, but the rest of the months are great.  It is kind of congested, but it's no L.A.  I go to ASU West and they're going through so many budget cuts and lay offs that I'm glad this is my last semester.

There's a lot of dive and sports bars in Phoenix, a few clubs and art galleries. Right now they have what they call "first Fridays". It's a big art walk they put together every First Friday of the month. Tempe is college town, and Scottsdale is more upscale with a lot of clubs, even casual ones to.    The weather is perfect right now, but does get really hot in the summer. There's only humidity when the summer monsoon storms come in around July, and it isn't humid every day.    http://phoenix.about.com/od/arizonapictu...    http://www.downtowntempe.com/    http://www.tempemarketplace.com/index.as...    http://www.azcentral.com/ent/nightlife/    http://www.azcentral.com/relocation/relo...|`|dfI25Aalaa	hawt and humid but cool|`|HcjCdLehaa	HOT AND DRY|`|V90Ao2jfaa	hot|`|hCX1dTuUaa	it is cool but i like wyoming better|`|DxZepZg7aa	hot, very very hot.

Qz6nbXIfaa	No, when I worked there we were trapping and killing rats all the time. This one time a rat ran out into the teacups and got crushed in the gears. Rat guts were flying all over the place even all over the kids. We had to pretend that there was nothing out of the ordinary and that the rat guts were "magical raspberry jam." It was hilarious.|`|ef3e8a055f877ac48bf7cb67749b1830aa	Those that work there prefer the term rat.  We say working for the Rat.  As for a trap, no--most of us quit.

c6456e410970b2517c227e433dd2dc3aaa	Lol    I think its funny that you ask this, since I own the worlds most traveled teddy bear! I seriously bring him with me wherever I go. He has been all over the world and I can tell you that as long as you buy the bear at the airport you can take it on without it being in your carry on luggage. If not, then it MUST be put into your carry on.     My poor Coda gets squished into my backpack for every trip! :oP    I would pre-buy it. What if the SF Airport doesnt have a cute one? Then youre out of luck!!! Just stuff him into your bag, teddy bears are okay with being squished for a bit!    Have a fun trip!!!|`|F0uLexezaa	u can bring him as long as he doesn't take up a seat|`|TRvAhhNKaa	Just buy one once you land. You don't want to carry a big bear on a plane for hundreds of miles. It might get messed up and would have to sit in your lap like a child unless you can fit it into the overhead compartment. I bet the airlines would even charge you an extra seat ticket, and security will do a cavity search on the bear looking for drugs ;-)|`|qXCgeye3aa	i think if you can bring one 1 carry on luggage, you can bring a big teddy bear, just make sure you can stuff into the overhead compartment.|`|bb99459877b85c544a09c8c6e36667c1aa	Most airlines allow you to bring 1 carry on and 1 personal item. This means a small carryon suitcase or similar and a purse. In your case I don't see a problem with a teddy bear replacing the carry on. Just be prepared to put it in the overhead compartment or even check it at the plane entrance in the case that you get a really small plane. Preferrably it would be wrapped in plastic or something to avoid getting dirty.
54tW840Oaa	if your looking for cheap the all star hotels  more expensive but affordable are the yacht club at the disney boardwalk is beautiful, the swan hotel, coronado springs, boardwalk inn, beach club, saratoga springs  I suggest actually staying of the disney property and renting a house it is not too pricey and most of them have their own screened in pools here is where my family rents them from www.innhouse.com  hope this helps, I would really look into renting a house I have for about 5-6 years and have never done anything els, it gives you space, and is fun for all children!

We have stayed there twice (once before kids and once when our twins were almost 18 months) we saw giraffe and other animals out our window almost every morning, plus there are places on the hallways that look out over savanah areas as well. The pool area is nice. Food court is good and Boma (restaurant) is excellent. We never ate at Jiko (another restaurant) but heard good things about it. The lobby is gorgeous with so many things to look at. Even our little guys were entranced by it. There is an African storyteller many of the nights out by the firepit and there are areas to walk outside where you can see the animals really well.|`|k2IIZkA3aa	If you can handle the price, I like Disney's Yacht & Beach Club Resorts. They're expensive, but most of the rooms have balconies and they have huge pool with a sand bottom. Kids love it.    If that's not an option, Animal Kingdom Lodge is slightly cheaper. Make sure you book a savannah view. Savannah view rooms will have a balcony and you can walk out onto your balcony at any time during the day and see dozens of African animals roaming about freely, virtually in your "back door".|`|1wwi0HLlaa	Definitely the Yacht and Beach Club. We always stay there, because there's a great laid back atmosphere for kids, yet it's sophisticated enough for adults. The pool is amazing, and I'm almost positive all the rooms have balconies. It's really beautiful, because some rooms overlook the Boardwalk, and I think there's a small playground for kids. The Beach Club Villas are pricier, but they're great for families. Hope this helped! =)
CKRtwea6aa	The school must contact your state Senator or House Representative. The tours are free but must be scheduled. I chaperoned a class trip there 2 years ago. Security is very tight. You had to provide the name & social   for everyone on the trip and present a photo ID before going in to cross reference with the list provided.

Only I think 10km from Uluru, it's heaps of massive rocks you walk over and around, in the middle of nowhere. I have no idea why they're not as big a deal as Uluru but there you go.    Then there's the Great Barrier Reef, the biggest barrier reef in the world (so Uluru and the GBR, two of the 7 wonders of the world, right here in Aus). It's so beautiful, all the coral and fish species. Global warming is doing it's thing though, and it may not be around in as little as 50 years or so.    Then there's the cities, you've got Melbourne, Sydney, Perth, Brisbane, Darwin. I love Melbourne, I've lived here all my life, it's the most fun place to go, the nightlife is amazing. It's full of hidden lanes and bars and tiny boutiques.  Brisbane is fun, it's up north so almost always hot. There's awesome beaches, good shopping, and many many good looking people.  Perth, I've never been to, so I'm not sure what to tell you about it. I'd like to go though.  Sydney, basically it's the tourist version of Melbourne. It's got the Sydney Harbour Bridge, Sydney Opera House, all t he over priced tourist shops. There's a bit of a rivalry between Melbourne ans Sydney, but Melb really kicks it.  Darwin is so awesome. It's further North than Brisbane, so ALWAYS hot. It's only a young city, Cyclone Tracy came through in 1973 I think it was, and demolished the whole city, so it's all been rebuilt. It's only tiny, I caould walk across the CBD in less than 20 minutes, but it's probably my favourite place after Melbourne. The Mindal Beach market is awesome, every Thursday night a market appears on the beach selling the most amazing handmade jewellery, bags food etc. The only thing about Darwin is, you can't swim in the beaches cos of sharks and crocs.    So ther you go, I've probably missed heaps of stuff, there's simply too much here to put all down, you're just gonna have to come see for yourself!|`|nO9rX6O6aa	The Great Barrier Reef is by far the most spectacular thing i've ever seen in my life. just seeing all the coral and aquatic life. Also the sunset at Uluru was pretty wonderful|`|uAyYRXnvaa	I've seen a lot of places in my life.... but will always call Australia home.  I think if you come from another country, the space is what amazes most people.  And it's an English speaking country with all the mod cons.... but with more desert, rainforest, beaches, wildlife, etc, etc, than you can poke a stick at.  You can't really know until you've been here, but Australia has something for everyone.|`|xs2mpYjWaa	Well I live here and wouldn't want to live anywhere else.     The weather is amazing, if you like it hot all year round you have Queensland, cold Tasmania, a nice mix of seasons then NSW or Victoria.     The people are really laid back and friendly. We're hard working and would do anything to help out a mate.     The beauty of our country is glorious. The mountains, the sea, the rainforest, the desert.     The many cultures that make up Australia, we like the best parts of the world all rolled into one.     Our size, we are a great big country with a relative small population, you're not over crowded yet not alone.    We have freedom of speech, equal rights, excellent free health care, free education, etc..     We have all the beautiful food and culture you find overseas as well as the fashion.     As well all the touristy things people like to have such as theme parks, beautiful beaches, shopping, etc..|`|gIPHbAY3aa	The Big attraction of Australia is the Gold Coast. Its the best place to live. Its got beautiful beaches, warm sunny weather, lively people and a great fresh air to breath.|`|DotPKf7Aaa	Australia is a huge country with many great attractions like Oprah House of Sydney, Great Barrier Reef and much more. I have seen both of them and I loved the great masterpiece of nature and well man|`|B12AbmsHaa	I prefer Sydney.  Sydney is undoubtedly a leading tourist destination in its own right. Featuring many prime tourist attractions, sightseeing in and around the city is easy. The CBD itself is a manageable size, with many people preferring to see the attractions on foot. Alternatively, the bright red Sydney Explorer bus takes in almost all of the major tourist attractions on its 20km route.
fIK9LBEuaa	Of course, there are places like Daytona beach and Miami for spring break. Those would be the most popular, and probably the most crowded.     I went to South Padre in Texas, and really enjoyed it. I know you said somewhere around Florida, but that was just an idea.     Anywhere you go I'm sure you'll have a great time, it's about what you make it!    Have fun! :)|`|Z03zgM0maa	miami|`|9gCm9jW5aa	Go Skiing

g05wGcPhaa	Want a reason to move here? Psshh South Beach should be enough. Ultimate clubs, partying, drinking, shopping, all the things a young adult like you would love are all in Miami.    Since you've lived up North you should take a visit to the South and enjoy the sunny beaches and the beautiful weather.    Adjusting to Florida is typically easy since there are many cultures here but if you live in Miami you will encoutner some spanish people or people from the islands/carribean and of course the Florida natives.    As of the weather here it's typically the same all year round but in the winter time we get a couple cold fronts which makes it cool and nice. From the end of May to November it's Hurricane Season/Rainy Season and sometimes we get a hurricane or two. We haven't had any major ones hit South Florida in about 3-4 years now so were on the lucky side.    I'm assuming your going to graduate college in 4 years so I cant really say how things will be then but as of now Florida is kinda in a bad situation.    As of right now it's nearly impossible to find a job especially in Miami Dade County. The unemployment rate right now in South Florida has reached 8.1% since December 08 , higher than the national unemployment rate of 7.2%. So that means 752,000 are jobless right now. In the tri-county area, Palm Beach County had the highest unemployment rate, with 7.8 percent, followed by Miami-Dade, with 7 percent, and Broward, with 6.8 percent. Most companies are cutting jobs right now so it's going to be quite hard for you to find a job because now you have to compete with a whole bunch of people who probably want the same position.    Affordable homes? Psshh..Miami is a big city and it's divided into smaller cities so it depends which area of Miami you move to. Some area's are prone to crime and poverty so the average apartment rent for a good area there would be about $1500 if you live in a decent area. Home's are selling less and less today so expect to see real estate prices in the 350k-400k.    But that's according to right nows situation and I DO NOT know how it will be in 5 4-5 years so don't mind some of these answers if your not coming down here very soon.    Also If your planning on moving to Miami in the future get ready for nasty rush hour traffic and constant accidents on the 826 (Palmetto Expressway) and any other highway in Miami-Dade County. Miami has the worst set of drivers that's why I rather live in Broward County.|`|bkbVJVnXaa	definitely to Miami - and get acquainted with the city first :) http://www.2findlocal-miami.com/youth-ho...|`|AA11227536	well if you want to hear english i would go to new york. if you go to miami you'll only here cuban/spanish etc|`|AA12151909	You should make that decision on your own. But, If you want to be in warm/tropical environment with very little cold climate then Miami is the place to be. If you prefer the fast life with much interaction and cold weather then go for NYC. It's all about what you like, your preference. You should definitely do some research and or visit if you have a sufficient amount of funds to do so. Get an idea of what kind of atmosphere you want to be in daily and then go from there.|`|oi4LXCgLaa	I see your sicilian? You would love the Argentines in Miami! (Same People)    Anyway im moving back to Miami (im in NYC) because there is nothing like Miami (beach, clubs, exotic woman, friendly people, ect)    If you need a JOB...Go to NY, but be prepared for the fast pace of life.    My opinion MIAMI|`|yfPu5pcZaa	I've lived in Miami my whole life and visited New York City and may other places like Europe. I'm yet to find a place a like more than Miami. There is nothing like it here. My boyfriend and his family feel the same way. We all travel a lot and are yet to find a place better than Miami. We have the best everything, beaches, food, night life, just name it. Ohhhh and don't forget the all year round TAN =D    Miami is the place to go!|`|fukzl8oaaa	the only way to really  know this answer is ....to visit both places....and for more than a day.  You will find they are like night and day.  Then do a lot of reading about both of them.  It helps too if you consider your career and where that would be best.|`|51240aa7381d99320f140fee4af9a406aa	To me, it only comes down to 2 things: If you like cold weather (move to NYC) If you do not like cold weather (move to Miami!)

g8LLIeXKaa	OK... So I am moving to NYC with a friend in late August. How much should I save between now and then to be ok?  - As much as possible. Rent could be 1500 to 2000 per month plus security deposit. You will also need to pay for utilities if it is not included and they could ask for up to $400 as a deposit.    What things should I know.. how should I prepare.. I live in Austin right now... I am super excited but scared. Please help me, give me some advice about what I need to do. THANKS!  - See if your bank is in NY. If not, you will be paying $5 on ATM fees. If not, plant to have ID and CASH to open one up fast.

AA11231409	Japanese people do not act cute all the time. where on earth did you get such an idea?    If the tv shows are any clue, for a female adult to be 'kawaii' she has to  1. act like a brainless fool  2. inhale helium before she opens her mouth to speak, and if she's working on a kids' show she has to inhale it twice  and 3. be totally impressed by everything anyone else says as if it's all new and exciting information, and agree with everyone else constantly as if she can't think of a sentence without help.    Oops, almost forgot to mention that she has to wear ridiculously frilly clothes, sometimes including mini-skirts that a whore would blush to be seen in.|`|4bWUiIVdaa	Just be yourself.

You might find it simpler to apply for work as crew on a cruise ship.|`|IgEOB2Braa	The first thing you will need is a passport. Then, I seriously doubt you could "hitch a ride" on a ship. How would they know you aren't a terrorist, or up to no good?  Space is probably at a premium, so you might have to pay in advance, if they would take you on. You can work in other countries, but you should be aware of the rules for being able to work legally, and what sort of visas and time limits you will have. And the economic problems of today are world wide, so you might not be able to just walk in somewhere and get a job. Unless you have unlimited funds, your idea of an adventure may turn out to be more of a nightmare, as you can't rely on embassies in other countries to bail you out if you run out of money. You might do some research online and see if merchant ships take passengers, or see if there are jobs available on the ships. I think you do need to do some advance planning. What would you do if you arrived at a country and they refused you entry?
Tz2D0grWaa	if you tell us where you are going to be living we can give regional advice    learn what the money looks like, there are lots of fakes - http://www.chinahighlights.com/travelgui...    be aware of pickpockets - http://search.yahoo.com/search?p=pickpoc...    learn to use chopsticks before you go, : )    read as much as you can about the last 75 years of China, it will give you a good background as to why Chinese act the way they do today    bring a good camera and take lots of pictures    while you are here you must see the Great Wall, The Bund in Shanghai and the ice festival in Haerbin (if you are here during the winter months of course)  http://images.search.yahoo.com/search/im...  http://images.search.yahoo.com/search/im...  http://images.search.yahoo.com/search/im...    bring deodorant, hard to find and expensive when you do find it        sorry to tell you this but the Chinese are not going to like the fact that you speak no Chinese, I have had lots of American Chinese friends come here and the Chinese are very hard on them, they cannot understand why Chinese Americans cannot speak Chinese, you will find out very quickly that even though you look Chinese you are not in any way shape or form Chinese, just be patient and remember they do not understand the melting pot concept, they think if you look Chinese you should speak Chinese and "honor the Han race"|`|8G42oyydaa	Yes I dont know how old you are but be aware that China has one of the  highest AIDS rates in the world so be very careful. The Chinese Govt does not release the real statistics, during the Mao years ALL Chinese were forced to donate blood and they re-used the needles which started the AIDS epidemic.     If you are female never never get in the front seat of a taxi because there is a good chance you could be mauled by the driver. It has happened to several women I know who are teaching over there.    DONT ever brush your teeth with the water or open your mouth in the shower.    Take OTC stuff for headaches, enough vitamins to last the entire time you are there, you will need them. I also advise taking stuff like beef jerkey - good source of protein, power bars, dried packaged soup like Chicken Lipton, and all the makeup and hair dye you might need.     Take ALL your prescriptions if you have any, enough to last while you are there. Put them and OTC stuff in a carry on bag. Put sturdy locks on your checked suitcases.    Dont take clothes, I take two suitcases full of food, you wont find licorise or many other things you may be fond of, butter flavoured micro wave popcorn is hard to find, but you can find lots of raspberry flavoured popcorn. YUK    Take your own toothpaste because of all the knock offs, you cant trust them to be safe, allergy eye drops and sinus medication because of pollution. And take hand lotions and face creams, it is almost impossible to find GOOD ones in China that arent really expensive.     You cant buy dental floss anywhere I have been in China either.    Dont plan on wearing open toed sandles a lot because of the garbage on the street, and children just use the sidewalks as toilets - so do drunks apparently.     DONT eat anything that is given to you, if you are invited out to dinner and you have doubts complain ahead of time of having an upset stomach and not feeling like eating.    A lot of the food is not cooked well and they do eat dog in Northern China, cat in southern China, and snake and things like boiled or pickled intestines. Fish isnt cleaned before its cooked and some stuff like raw sea urchin will make you deathly ill -  be very careful.  Just explain you are not Chinese and your stomach is not used to their food and you cannot eat some things.  They will understand.    Trust me though when you go into your room at night a suitcase of your favourite snacks and high protein snacks are going to make it a lot easier for you.    You might also want to pack some powdered milk if you are a milk drinker.  Dont count on being able to find or afford western cereal in China either.     When you go out anywhere take tissues with you, most chinese toilets do no have toilet paper.    People living in a city like Shanghai and sticking in the "western areas" of these cities dont really know what the "real" China is like.  Its like people who travel and never leave the tourist areas.  They dont live in or experience the Chinese life.  You want to do that and you will be living with a Chinese family.  There are two faces to China, one is a mask and one is the real face of China.    I have travelled into the rural areas, lived in a fishing village, and spent almost no time in the cleaned up artifical tourist and foreigner wealthy ghettos so take advise from someone who has lived in the REAL China, and your visit will be a wonderful experience for you.    As for clothing China is a fashion spot, so you can buy fashionable clothing pretty much anywhere, stay out of high prices malls would be my advise.  For the most part Chinese young people wear jeans just as we do. Most of our clothing comes from China.  So there is no difference when it comes to how we dress and they dress.  People over 30 tend to dress better in China then NA's do at that age. And can be very fashionable.    You will need one pretty dress for special occassions.     Being a foreign female in China is VERY different from being a foreign male.  Women dont get the same respect or treatment that men do. Men are seen as potential rich husbands !!    Good luck.     and FYI Frank who is finding fault with my answers lived in China for a whole 6 months WOW !    In a western community, in one city and never experienced the REAL China as you will living with a Chinese Family and I am assuming you WONT be able to afford the exclusive western stores for what you need - like paying $8 Cdn for dental floss?|`|dstvm3zRaa	dint tough the birds, dint second guess the government. go sight seeing as much as possible. have fun. maybe leran a little chinese|`|rcRoF7WNaa	Good for you! Be prepared for the traffic - crossing the road anywhere is a nightmare, no one seems to follow road rules!    Bring some snacks from home, headache tablets, deoderant, cough lollies (the pollution's bad in the first few days).      I'm from Australia living in Tianjin.  I brought a few packs of koala toys to give to people who help me, like a really helpful cab driver etc.  Once they like you, they'll do anything for you.    Really watch your money.  I had a bad experience on the first day.  It's not rude to count your change, or dispute your charges, they will think less of you if you don't.    And last of all - be prepared to eat anything you're given.  There's not much rice in the north, and the food's spicy in the south.    Good luck! (sorry it's long)|`|KVlRYoidaa	AVOID "HAN"|`|Lmw6dtQvaa	I'm a bit mad at some of the answers you are getting. ISOTOPE2007 is so wrong on many points.    I WROTE THIS TO HER...  You gave some good advice. I'm not sure what part of China you are in or have been to. But you paint a very bad picture of China. Some of the stuff you wrote is just not true. I spent 6 months in Guangzhou, China. I could find all of those things you wrote that could not be found. They may have been a bit more on the cost side, but still available.    About your Aids comment? You are so wrong!     The USA is higher than CHINA!   http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_cou...    Look at that chart fro WIKIPEDIA.    A good chance on getting mauled in a TAXI? Yes it's true women don't sit in the front seat. BUT a GOOD CHANCE? If you are in China for some time you will get used to the water. I used the water to brush my teeth when I had to. I just never swallowed. Your Body will adjust. But you will get sick at least 1 time. I did. It is your Body adjusting.     You tell this person to take supplies like they are going on a 1 week hike. She or He can't take all that stuff! She or He is going to live with a Family for god knows how long. She can bring it but it won't last. You can find most of that stuff in China. They have special stores for Europeans and Americans. It may cost more. Yes you can find Dental floss, and milk and popcorn. I did.    The AIDS thing is just BS. That was such a lie. Many on here are correct. The toilets are squatters. But you will find many western toilets. Bring tissues... YES. Drunks and Babies going to bathroom in the streets... YES. I'm a guy so I could get away with staring back. I'm 6 foot 3 and 270. I'm a big dude. I got stared at all the time. It got old and I would just stare back or laugh. I wish I knew what city you are going to. That helps so much. Pleas next time add that to your question? China is very different, but you will still be able to find many of the things you have in the USA or western world. They have international stores. It does cost a bit more. But try some new things. Your body will adjust to your surroundings.     If you are not a smoker you will have to get used to smoking in just about all the places. But they now ban it in many western style places.     Try new things. Try new foods. Enjoy the cheap pampering. Haircut $4.00 USA. Massage $8 USA. RELAXATION CLUBS. 24 hours of TV LA-Z Boy chair. Internet, Buffet, free drinks and food and fruit. Sauna. Foot massage, ear cleaning, manicure. You stay and sleep for 24 hours and this all will cost you $40-$50 USA. The Chinese are very friendly. If you are a woman just be careful. You will find many men who only have one thing in mind. And that is not the Chinese men. Many foreigners are there and they think China is a play ground.

He is very excited about it. It is his first trip to China! He asked what is my suggestion for him to prepare the trip. I do have some tips.    Tip  1: Avoid Travel Around May 1 and Oct. 1.     May 1 to May 4 and October 1 to October 7 are national holidays in China. It is also called Golden Week, because the continous 4-7 day holiday and good weather bring millions of people to scenaric places, hotels, also trains, airlines, and buses. In short, it is crowded everywhere. People visiting China typically dont have the constraint of travel only in the 4-7 days, so avoid it. Also, if possible, avoid the two days before and after the holiday.    Tip  2: Visiting Shanghai? Strongly Suggest to Visit Beijing    For many business travellers to Shanghai, I would suggest to take a weekend to visit Beijing. Shanghai is the largest commercial city in China, but it is not a typical city that represent China. If you want to claim youve really been to China, plan a short trip to Beijing, and visit the Forbidden city, visit the Great Wall, and visit some Royal Gardens in Beijing. Even you dont go to these famous places, to experience the wide streets and the narrow Hutong is a good idea. Just FYI, Beijing is 1400 KM north of Shanghai, and takes 1 and half hours to fly there. Full price ticket is 1130 RMB, and you typically can get ticket at 20% off price. (7 RMB = 1 USD)    Tip  3: Take Taxi!    Dont bother to look at the transportation options unless you are really travelling with small budget. My point is, taxi is not as expensive as people think. From Pudong Airport to downtown is about 100 - 150 RMB (12 - 20 USD). There are much cheaper options like airport bus (18 RMB), but compared to the 100-150 USD taxi fare from SFO to Silicon Valley, it is not too high. To travel inside the city, taxi is also a handy choice, unless you want to experience Metro. (Disclaimer: I gave tips according to real situations. In this case, it is my friend Martin. You may find it not suitable for you).    Tip  4: Places to See?     Top places in Shanghai you should go are    The Bund. Leave it as the last place you go. Bund is much more beautiful and interesting at night (after 7:00 PM when the lights are lit).   Yu Garden. I dont really enjoy Yu Garden, but my friends who visit China for the first time always enjoy themselves so much in the Yu Garden.   Cruise on the Huang Pu River. It worth the time and money to have a cruise on the Huang Pu River, especially at night. Typical cruise is about 1 hour.   Xuhui District. Spend an afternoon in the small roads in the Xuhui Area - near Hengshan Road, or Hua Shan Road, and relax yourself.

But it is hot everywhere in China during the summertime, so bring light clothing for that season. As for right now, it's pretty cold over there. I would recommend you bring a light jacket as well as a warm sweatshirt or something of that sort. You can also always buy proper clothes there.  If you've never been far from (I'm assuming) the U.S., you'll need some shots (i forget which ones, ask your doctor) and bring pepto bizmo. Some of the foods may not agree with your stomach. Always buy bottled water!  Try to be respectful of the family. Be extremely polite, even more polite than you usually are in your own country. Especially the U.S., we have a tendency of being rude. Try to learn the language, but don't push yourself. A lot of Chinese people (especially if they're letting you do a homestay) are really nice and like to teacher our culture, customs, and especially language.  Oh also, bring toilet paper everywhere you go...there's quite a few places that don't have toilet paper...and get used to squatting XD. If you get the oppurtunity to climb the great wall, no matter how tired, try to get to the farthest point they let you get to. You'll enjoy it in the end, i promise. There are shopping places for tourists or foreigners. Be sure that if you're buying something that seems a little above the price it should be, to ask somebody you know who can speak fluent Chinese to haggle the price for you. Some of the people will try to get a bit more money out of you than what the item's really worth.  Remember, in China, cars and motorcycles (mopeds) have the way, not pedestrians. If you're by yourself, i'd suggest you cross the street with natives, because they know how to cross. If you're not asian, just warning you, you're gonna get a few stares, not angry ones, just curious ones.  oh, and be prepared for the smoking....  Be wary of pickpockets. Only bring enough money for the day. Leave your other money and passport at the house. Don't bring an iPod out or whatever if you have one. It may get stolen.   If you live in the U.S. you're gonna have to get used to have a smaller personal space bubble. Especially around tourists spots.  Don't be afraid to try things, but just warning you, some of those food stands you'll see are just there for foreigners, especially Americans so they can laugh at you behind your back at how naive you are in eating something that the natives wouldn't eat just 'cause it's deep fried.  People may stare at you, but don't stare at others.|`|WnEJdeAGaa	why china?? are u crazy?|`|97959fda8c4d2d5f1b2f5cce799210e3aa	Edit the question and tell us where you will be going, if you know yet.  If you are going to a big city like Shanghai, Beijing, Guangzhou, yes, it's very easy to find western food items/convenience items.  I live in real China. I must take taxi, bus, then another taxi (1.5 hours total) away to get spaghetti, chicken breast, cheese, etc.  And don't expect to be able to buy clothes unless you are a size 4 or under ...practically!|`|bYNFc05kaa	I went to China on a foreign exchange program, and lived with a host family as well. For things to bring. Bring them stuff about your culture and family that you want to show them. Don't talk bad about the government... Ours and theirs... Avoid talking about issues like Taiwan... Or at least that is what they told me before I left.     Bring basic needs... My host family was so sweet though.. They bought everything for me already... But just to make sure.. Bring back up... (medicine, toothbrush, shampoo, etc.) Bring a towel... I remember i spent the night at a friend's house... They had the little small hand cloth towels... So small... Don't bring too much clothes.. I know i bought some reall nice outfits there.. And a lot of the girls that went there on the exchange came back with a lot more clothes than they had come with. Also the Chinese tend to wash their clothes everyday... So you don't want to over load their wash with too many clothes... (At least in the city i lived in , Changzhou, they had to as the humidity was too much) I'm not saying bring very little... But you could figure out what is best.. depending how long you will be staying there.    Keep an open mind about everything... And don't be afraid to ask some questions. :)    You'll find almost everything available for you there, and buy products from there as well. You don't have to be afraid. It's cheaper too.     Just remember to keep emergency phone numbers and your home address on you at all times... In chinese too as... Just in case you get lost (Ask one of your chinese family members to help you write it if your don't know much chinese)    Oh, yeah, if you don't know much already, learn what you can of simple chinese needed phrases and sayings... It'll help.    Have fun.. I know i did... I was so upset when it was time to go back home..     Hope this helps a bit! XD
zx5zzf53aa	There isn't one huge store, like Sam Moon. But there are many small boutiques downtown with cheap jewelry and stuff.|`|bq8qt8Lcaa	tyui|`|VRO4Zhs2aa	i don't think there is but i could be wrong i thought only in Dallas Texas there is my last name is Dallas
b8tgCAQJaa	The song Penny Lane is not about Rose Lane. There is absolutely no evidence for that at all, although I'm sure the owners of the shops in Rose Lane would like you to believe it!    (If you look at other Yahoo Answers about this topic, there are people trying to spread similar rumours about other streets in Liverpool. Don't fall for it.)    The barber shop mentioned in the song is on Smithdown Place, just off Penny Lane itself.|`|DdNAqWulaa	well you'll have trouble eating in the Sgt Pepper Birstro cos it's closed down!    Penny Lane wine bar is very nice though and there are several nice restaurants at the Allerton Road end of Penny LAne.  You do know the song  Penny Lane  was actually originally written about a different road  Rose Lane  but that it didn't fir the metre of the song don't you!  I think doing those tours you mentioned should take to pretty much all the Beatles spots. There are a couple of other clubs and pubs  like the Blue Angel  etc which might be of slight interest  but having done those tours you should have got to see some other bits of the city you might like to visit.  Most of the city centre is within easy walking distance.  Check out the Hard Days Night Hotel and it's gallery too.
aPxmZq00aa	Have them bring in a crib and put it where she will be near you and won't be frightened. Be sure to bring her favorite stuffed toy.|`|uNQa4tXDaa	just let her sleep in the bed if she climbs down there really isn't any where she can go.
c06dc4d1e227f35f0b67179987536394aa	Everything is archived at city hall.  You can check the link below for online searches, too, or call and ask.    You'll be amazed at how much they have, and I am sure you will find the article you're looking for.    There is also the BNQ:  475 Maisonneuve East, they have the Montreal Star on microfilm.|`|AA12095483	Google up Thompson Newspapers - it's a chain, and they bought out the Montreal Star after it folded, following that disasterous pressman's strike in the late 1970s. They will  be able to tell you where the archives went. They are not usually destroyed, but are transferred - sometimes to a local university. The other possibility is to contact Montreal City Hall, and check with their archival department, or the Montreal City Library, and ask their archivist.   Once you track the archives down and find a copy of the picture, there wil be a credit line telling you who took the photo. If the photographer is still alive, you may have to write to ask permission to have the picture copied.   Good luck.|`|eulMjLtPaa	Contact the paper to research their archives.  They may also have the photographer's name, who may still be alive and completely anal about saving all his/her negatives.|`|0PKDVWAqaa	The Montreal Star no longer exist... It closed some time in the 70`s!  You may need to search through Canadian National Archives or a Montreal Library. Good Luck!
MBFeHS22aa	I have had the problem a few times. I found that taking the "blue line" is a very good option. You can go all the way downtown. The trains run a pretty good schedule (every 10 min or so). You can really see the city and it is interesting.I personally get off when I see a bar named "Zimne piwo" but that is simply part of my culture.   I do time the train so I am back two hours before lift off.|`|G2h8g2g1aa	Yes.    Take the blue line and you should be downtown by 11:30am if your flight gets in on time.  If your flight leaves at 6pm you want to be at the airport at 4:30pm which means you have to leave downtown (north on the blue line back to O'Hare) at 3:30pm.    It will only cost you $4.50 round trip (and the blue line is the best way to go, don't take a cab) so at the very least you have time for lunch and a few sites.|`|YDvrJbbiaa	O'Hare is notorious for having the worst on time record.  I would be very careful if you do leave the airport to not go very far. Your plane could land late, or your next plane may have problems.   So just be careful not to miss your connection ;) Oh and make sure that you check in with the airline, because if you do not, they will not put your baggage on the next plane. (The airport also has a bad reputation from that as well)  Safe journey!
