20081004033816AAJRMVC	Health;Mental Health	I feel paranoid that people have something on me ?	How am i suppose to succeed in life - achieve my goals when the local community treats me like this ?         How do you handle aloof, dismissive, stand-offish behaviour from people in your community ?         ive been treated by people in my local community like this for a long time but just tried to ignore it.      to say, i have had long term psychiatric problems, i have BPD and ptsd , regretablly i used to have rage problems and rage outbursts years ago, where id lash out and lose it in public , it would cause me to be publically embarressed and humiliated , attacked by strangers, pointed at and laughed at etc.      the rage came from years of abuse and bullying where i never stood up for myself and i bottled up anger throughout childhood.      iam now nearlly 31, and sadly i have a big disadvantaged history - no employment history - no education or qualifications - long psychiatric history - and a criminal history over 7 years back for an assault , carrying a knife in a rough area, i spent time in a psychiatric hospital to.   i regret all these mistakes, but my life has had incredabllle misfortune.      i now view myself as a reforming character and im trying to pursue help with the psychiatric services - theyve told me ther is no individual psychotherapy - that im not ready for intense group therapy - so they reccommended a local resource centre to help me better integrate with mankind again because i have been isolated in my 1 bedroom apartment for so long.      i live on disability, i own very little possessions, my only goal in life is to ; gain a decent job in IT computers and to emigrate from the uk - leave england for good to a hot coastal climate.      although i accept i wouldnt get into australia or america.      im depressed because iam disadvantages, and those are big goals to go for - and im not prepared to lower my sights.      in my local community as ive said theres some people who still remain to be socially aloof - stand offish and dismissive towards me.      i have thought maybe people remember me from my rage outbursts years back ?      or because im mixed race hispanic mainly living in a white area ?      or im viewed as the local weirdo, somebody to avoid ?      or its a conspiracy by the local community in the north of england to socially alienate and ostracise me ?      these are the thoughts running through my brain.      the way ive been handling it is by being ' aloof ' back, short with people back - as im not about to ' jump through hoops ' to be accepted..      throughout my life, because of my problems, ive never formed ; any ' social relationships or friends.      im starting from scratch , im isolated, my future is uncertain, i have alot to overcome , ill probablly faced alot of biasis and predjudices outthere.      the people who are aloof are people like ; helpline workers , authority workers , cashiers , store workers , library clerks etc.      like i say i aint kissin no butt to be accepted - so how do i handle this behaviour ?      i feel very enraged and confused towards it.          also because of my past rage outbursts , lashing out at people,  times when ive lost control of aggression on the internet , ie ;  verbally threatening people on youtube,   because they said insults -  people on here  ' goading ' insulting my questions -  the n i get aggressive and fire back aggressive emails etc...      i now feel paranoid that im marked down as a known crazy outthere in society  -  like people have something on me  to use against me etc.         also;      does anyone know of any person who faced extreme adversity or ex criminal who managed to turn their life around against all the odds and achieve their goals in life ?

Ningun Doctor me ha sabido explicar que me sucede, lo cierto es que es super raro, el lado izquierdo y derecho de mi cuerpo son diferentes, mi lado fuerte es el derecho, mi brazo y pierna de ese lado son fuertes, los musculos estan desarrollados muy bien, incluso el pectoral es mucho mas notorio de lado derecho, de lado derecho de mi rostro la barba es cerrada y tupida, pero justo cuando empieza la mitad de lado izquierdo se vuelve rala y espaciada, lo rar es que no es tanto que mi brazo y pierna derechos sean muy fuertes, sino que el brazo y pierna izquierdo los noto especialmente debiles, y cuando he hecho ejercicio para desarrollarlos no crecen mucho, de hecho es casi nulo, en cambio del otro lado de inmediato se pone fuerte y se siente el poder. Y quiza lo mas raro es que incluso mentalmente me siento como una dualidad, siento que puedo ser duro, fuerte de caracter y temperamento, y por momentos me siento debil y muy sensible. Que rayos pasa ?? Alguien que sepa Ayuda!!

I am very proud of her for being supportive of me, but she knows I can't support her smoking (i can't even be in the room with her with my lungs if she is smoking). I argued this very point of not smoking with my grandmother till the the day she died of lung cancer, and my mom seems intent on following her to the grave. I tried talking to my sister and my mom's friends to try to find support to get her to stop, and they told me she's smoking more than I thought, and it's a losing battle arguing with her. I feel like tihs is my fault for causing this strain on her, and I don't know what I can do.  I just stormed out of a fight with her over it...it upsets me so much i can't even stand to look at her smoking. Those things gave me lung problems from second hand smoke, took my grandparents, and now have thier hooks in her. What can I do? Any Advice?

Pois é, pesquisando sobre insonia achei mais de 300 tópicos, muitas dicas, muitas receitas naturais.. porém n?o achei nenhuma em que eu me encaixasse.      S?o exatamente 6:50 da manh?. Varei a noite. Tentei deitar, ficar quieto, n?o pensar, leite quente e nada. Nadica de nada.. e continuo sem sono. Agora n?o tentarei mais dormir, sen?o perco o dia todo. Tomo um banho e sigo o dia normalmente como se tivesse tido uma noite de sono normal. O que me preocupa é que parece que com o passar do tempo, tenho dormido cada vez menos. E o que mais me estranha, é que n?o tenho indisposi??o, apenas umas olheiras horríveis. Será que n?o tenho tanta necessidade de dormir ? Passo as vezes 48 ou 56 horas direto e nem percebo. Quando bate a exaust?o eu durmo umas 5 horas no máximo e me sinto bem. Sinceramente, me preocupo se isso n?o trará futuramente danos a minha saúde. Alguém convive com essa situa??o ou tem alguma opni?o a respeito?? Muito Obrigado.

20070314053847AAO2XNv	Health;Mental Health	Que faire de mon "fainéant" de fils?	Bonjour! Mon fils, aujourd'hui agé de 24 ans, a brusquement quitté le lycée à l'age de 18 ans en fin de classe seconde, après deux années scolaires assez difficiles. Le prétexte, à l'époque, était qu'il en avait "marre de l'école", et rien n'y personne n'a pu l'en dissuader. Sa vie, depuis, se résume à une longue paresse chez papa et maman (lever à midi, déjeuner, sieste, jeux vidéo, d?ner, re-jeux video et coucher à 4 heures du matin!), émaillée de "coups de gueule" de ma part suivis - pour la forme - de brèves périodes de stages complètement "bidons"!... Aujourd'hui, léger progrès: il ne m'a pas "envoyé promener" quand je lui ai proposé de recommencer à étudier au niveau seconde. Mais il n'a pas suffisamment confiance en sa motivation, pour choisir une formule d'auto-apprentissage de type "CNED".  D'où mes deux questions: 1) existe-t-il des lycées réservés aux ADULTES qui souhaitent avoir une "deuxième chance" dans la vie ? 2) est-ce la solution adaptée au cas de mon fils ?

I felt fine earlier today, it all started when I ate this homemade bread after school.  Do you think it's the bread or the flu?      I'm scared, help!!  Thanks.

20090205165723AAt6kg7	Health;Mental Health	My friends/family aren't helping me with depression. What's the point?	Lately I've been feeling horrible about myself and life itself. The only time I'm happy is when I listen to music to let me drain out my thoughts, but soon after the sadness and emptiness just drones over me all over again. I have no one to help me through this and now I'm wondering if there's really any point in living if this will never go away?      I have had bad experiences happen to me: Alcoholic father and abuse from him. The thing is, I was in 4-5th grade when most of it ended (I'm not in 8th). I can definitely admit that my family went through more of this, after all, my brother and sister tried to keep me away and upstairs every night to prevent me from seeing it all. Am I wrong to say it affected me, too? I still saw some of the abuse he did, and I could hear all the screaming going on for hours. I knew what was happening too, I wasn't an idiot. I could tell that my father had a drinking problem and that there was violence going on. He ended up going to jail twice for a short time, and my sister and brother both got depression, as my mom did too, and my father had nowhere to really go. I was about eight years old and upset/worried as sh*it. I know he caused a lot of stuff to happen, but I still worried about where he was going to go. He still visits now, and constantly trying to talk my mother into letting him back into her life, but there's constant arguing when he visits that just reminds me of the past. Also, it hurts me to see him so upset and regretful. I can say more happened, because it did.     So, I tried to tell my mom that I was depressed. She sort of laughed it away. No one in my family believes me. My brother noticed I had been crying one night, my sister noticed that I don't talk as much, and my father comments on how upset I sound over the phone. But no one is seeing that I'm depressed?       Plus, my friends don't seem to care either. 3 of my friends don't know. But I have two close friends that do. One asks me if I'm feeling okay everyday, but I just tell her I'm fine. My closest one doesn't say anything, but she probably can't even relate to what I'm feeling. She's been rather lucky in financial, family, and relationships. ....-.-' ? Lol. I feel like my friends got annoyed when I mentioned I was depressed. I feel like I was just bringing up myself when I needed to talk about my problems. After a few days, I just decided to shut up and act happy. However, I have everything bottled up inside which makes everything more difficult and I don't feel like myself when I act happy.     I cannot talk to the school guidance counselor, they might get the police involved which will make everything EXTREMELY worse.   I just don't see the point of going on if my life will just continue feeling like this? With no one helping me out?      And I have went through more events, such as, money problems, depression in family, panic attacks (serious ones), sibling drug abuse, tumor was recently found in a family member, and much more.
20090205173650AAUyeWR	Health;Mental Health	Why do I feel like my childhood's gone?	I'm only 12! I'm barely a teenager, and I'm bombarded with all the honor classes and ransom arguments about life and especially homework. I'm going nuts! I felt like I don't even have a chance to live my childhood anymore! It's all new to me! I'm trying my hardest to get myself organized, but all the notes and extra classes are getting me into a very dim and tense place. I have friends that support me, but what's the use? Half of them are failing because they're too lazy to study. I'm a 93.5 student, and I'm trying my hardest to maintain that but, I need to relax. Do I have control over what is happening? I still want my childhood, but where is it hidden?

20090205174157AAf4VV6	Health;Diet & Fitness	Somethings not right, i need help?	I know i am not fat.    i am 15 years old, about 5 foot, and 105 pounds. According to my doctor, i am perfect weight. and yes, that makes me happy. but a healthy weight and be skinny are different things. I don't have a flat stomach and my thighs are slightly bigger then i want them to be. I know i sound like some crazy weight freak, but i truely am not. I have been thinking of ways to slim down over the last year.   My first thought was exercise, i tried that. Going on jogs every few nights, push up, crunches, etc. I didn't see a difference in my weight, lose interest, and eventually stopped trying.   Next, i got stretch marks on my thighs. I still have them and they make me so upset. I dont feel comfortable wearing swim suits and always worry about people seeing them when i wear short. Im not fat and not overweight, so i just dont understand how i got them. They make me feel fat and ugly. How do i get ride of them without expensive laser surgery?   My mom is on weight watchers so i try just eating healthier and cutting back on sweets or just limiting the amoun of sweets. After my mom explained the weight watchers system and how you can only eat 20 points worth of fod each day, i tried it. Its so hard, espcially with the food i like being up to 8 points per a brownie or w.e   This got me thinking, what if i dont eat? I ended up skipping breakfast and lunch and eating when i got home after school. I firgured this was okay, because i usually ALWAYS stuff myself after school. I also ate dinner. It really wasnt that hard. i kept telling myself, hungry is only a feeling and nothing eles, just distracting myself helped me not that much.    Now, lets remember i still ate everyday, i just cut back.but this wasnt helping. The scale, still read the same numbers and my strech marks were still there. I just dont get it? I looked up pro-ana stuff and thats just not me. But i want to lose some weight, just to feel comfortable wearing a swim suit.         looking in a mirror makes me feel sad. All my friends are so skinny, i dont get it. im not even fat and the doctor keeps telling me i just the right weight, but them why do i have stretch marks?!            can someone just give advice, tell a story related to me, i just need some help.         idk, why is this making me so depressed?

Hi,  I had a root canal done. the doctor recommended crown but possibly because this way he can refer me to a friend and build business relationship!(?) Here is the source of my dilemma:  I had 2 root canals done in the past - one with a crown later and the other without. the one with crown i have to remove because it is terrible and i suffered from the gums around it for 10 years. the one without a crown just root canal and filling is still Great after 20 years! so how do i make a decision when i don't trust a word i hear from those dentists!? is it possibly a regular filling is the best option for me after a root canal or is it in general a bad idea?

I read masturbation helps. Clean the pipes, relieve some tension. That seems to make it worse for me. To give you an example I popped about 3 yesterday in the course of 5 hours. I whacked off, then when anything would come into contact with my d*** it would be zing, popped another. I popped about 5 more after masturbating.   Also, my gf and I have been going out for a little over 3 years now. She wants to keep her v card for when she is married. Wants to save it for a special moment. Which obviously makes me a virgin. I respect her decision so I never push. But whenever we kiss, dance, etc. I get horny and pop one. She understands and she has felt it so we both don't care. It's just embarasing. Sometimes when we haven't seen each other in awhile I pop one just from holding hands.   Any suggestion and/or advice for my situation? Is my sex drive very high or something?

20090205165009AAYXTAY	Health;Diseases & Conditions;Other - Diseases	Is this Crohn's Disease?	At the age of 16 I acquired a stomach illness. Everyday after school I would have terrible bouts of painful watery diarrhea (and occasional constipation)--worsening with stress, PMS and certain food intake.    After that I realized I had a chronic bowel disorder. My doctor, after just a few insignificant tests, decided I had irritable bowel syndrome. I'm 24 now, and threw a few different SSRIs and antispasmodics at me. Since then my symptoms have only increased with time.      Sometimes I will find blood(either on toilet paper or in toilet) and mucus with my feces. I have constant soreness, itchiness and mild bleeding around my anus. My bowel movement are very urgent, numerous and extremely painful. Sometimes I will go as much as 15 times a day. The pain in my abdomen is excruciating and feels as if my intestines are about to rupture. I have never felt pain even comparable to the pain I get from my stomach issues. And I just feel so exhausted and sore in my hips all the time. I also get nauseated and vomit. Sometimes the vomiting and diarrhea is worse than any food borne illness or stomach flu I have ever caught in my life.

20090205165621AAnFdN1	Health;Mental Health	How do you not let things or what people say bother you?	Lately I've not been feeling confident at all.  I feel like I'm let down frequently, either by what someone does or says.  Here are some examples:      My brother, friends and I will be playing a trivia game online or on tv, and my bro gets so many more questions right then I do.  I'm not dumb, but he's almost like a genius.  He was one of those types that practically has the dictionary memorized.  I'm happy for him, but at the same time, I'm a little jealous.  It shoots down my confidence level.       Also, some of my family members and friends seem to complain an awful lot lately.  Unless I just notice it more now because that I'm feeling a little down.  We'll turn on the tv and a video is playing and my friend will be all "that song sucks", or "that show isn't good at all", or I'll be in the car with my mother and she'll start complaining "i can't stand your father sometimes".  I feel like I'm a sponge for people to soak in their complaints at to me.       Maybe it's me.  Maybe I don't know how to handle complaints, criticism, etc.  It's like where is the positivity at?       Any advice? Sure would appreciate it! :)

20090205174017AA7Z4Tf	Health;Diseases & Conditions;Cancer	My sister has Stage IV Hodgkins - I don't think we can get through this?	My 26 year old sister was diagnosed with Stage IV Hodgkins disease in July 2008.  It was an awful time and we could not see how we would all get through it.  We were desolate as it was awful watching her go through so much.  She started chemo (ABVD) in August and it was not as bad as we thought it was going to be.  We managed to keep her spirits up, she hasn't lost all her hair and has had no sickness.  She had to have one line removed due to infection but that was the only difficulty.  Her 2 month PET scan came back clean and she had her last chemo last week.  We now have to wait until mid march for the results on her 6 month PET scan.      When Kate was initally diagnosed I had very severe depression.  I could not stop crying and some days could not face getting out of bed.  However, as the weeks went on I got more used to what was happening and filled my time spending time with my sister, keeping her spirits up and my depression lifted slighty - at times I even felt a little bit like my old self.  However, since Kate's last chemo I have reached my lowest ebb.  I was so looking forward to the end of chemo and expected to feel great so these feelings have taken me by surprise.  I am so worried that her final PET scan won't be clean and we'll have to start on stem cell treatment.  I also don't know how we'll get through the rest of our lives when the chances of it coming back are about 35% according to many websites I've read.      I just don't think I'll ever be the person I used to be.  Life just seems so awful.  I can't look forward to anything and am petrified of getting Hodgkins myself (as I know my chances are much higher now).  Life seems so pointless - none of the good things make up for this awful awful thing.  I love my sister so much and we are such a close family that I know we couldn't survive if anything happened to her.  I just don't know how to get through this.

Its gotten to be so bad that Ive contemplated suicide and wished that i got into an accident and died. My parents are divorced and have been since I was two, my mom is a psychopath who blames me for all of her problems and makes me feel like a worthless piece of crap. My dad moved away for his work and is too caught up in his work to give a damn about me. I dont have many friends, only a few of them that are true, but many people know me. Everyone else thinks im a sketchy kid because im quiet and don't say much because of my anxiety and dont really give me the time of day. My social anxiety has caused me to feel inferior to everyone around me in a way. I have such a boring personality and then I see everyone else around me having such a great time cracking jokes and it just sinks me deeper into my depression.I've been on medicine and gone to counseling but none of that seems to work. Im nice to everyone yet they could care less about me. I really just wish something would happen to me, no one would care anyways.It's only a matter of time before I go out one night and drive my car off the road somewhere, making it look like an accident. Tonight I drove around for a good solid hour and was ready to crash my car, but I wasn't ready. I honestly got nothing to live for anymore, im probably going to fail out of college because my depression has spiraled out of control. I don't like myself and who I am, Im just sick of being a failure at life and i see no way that anythings ever going to change. I've been waiting years and everything is still all the same. The saddest thing out of my whole ordeal is that no one who knows me would give a damn if something were to happen to me.

It started several weeks ago when I stayed up after a party and ended up playing a video game til the sun came up and flip flopped my sleeping hours for the next day or two.       Well ever since, somehow anytime I lay down or get in bed for a short nap I end up dozing off for several hours at a time. Sometimes I get a full days rest by accident in the middle of the day. For example, today I stretched out on my couch around 2pm and didn't get fully awake til after 6pm. I had gotten 6 hours of sleep the night before.       I'm a full-time student and have tests coming up. I've been thinking of the following things to help: coffee (I'm not a coffee drinker, but I don't mind it), caffeine pills, energy drinks, & a louder alarm clock stuck to my face LOL. So any advice to prevent these lllong naps would great great!
20090205182715AAeVDrN	Health;Diseases & Conditions;Other - Diseases	What could be wrong with my stomach?	For the past 3 weeks, I have experienced nausea after eating ANYTHING--including soup. My stomach also gurgles excessively for a good hour or so after ingesting anything. I have only been eating soup and bananas because I afraid that if I eat anything else, I'll vomit.    I also have been feeling bloated after eating, however, that has been easing up significantly the past week.    I went to the doctor, and he took an x-ray of my stomach, as well as did a blood test. He claimed he could not see anything, and prescribed me Prilosec (huh?). I can't understand why he prescribed me something for heartburn, and I'm not going to waste money on something totally unrelated.    Has anyone experienced this? What is your opinion? I want to be able to eat like a normal person again!

20090205175905AAvIziA	Health;Diseases & Conditions;Other - Diseases	What can I do about TMJ disorder?	I developed TMJ disorder about a month and a half ago, and it has not let up one bit. I went to see my physician about a month ago, who gave me an anti-inflammatory and told me I'd be fine in a few days. So then I went to my dentist, who sent me to the only TMJ specialist in my state. The specialist told me I have posterior capsulitis, but I don't think he was right. He did no x-rays and acted as if he didn't believe me when I said I could hear grinding when I open and close my mouth. He couldn't hear it, so he didn't believe me. He gave me more of the same anti-inflammatory and sent me home, telling me to call him if I need anything else. I'm at a loss. I'm 26 years old, my husband is overseas, I live alone, and I'm incredibly depressed. I have never had such thoughts of suicide before, but I have had them lately. I know people might think that's silly, but when you have TMJ disorder, it's not silly. I am just wondering if I am ever going to be pain-free again. I feel totally desperate. I wear my night guard, but it doesn't keep me from clenching my teeth at night. If I don't take a benzodiazapine every time I go to sleep, even to nap, I wake with extreme pain. I don't want to be addicted to ativan at 26. I have been applying moist heat for the past month. I tried ice, but it doesn't help.  I pray often and I know, as a Christian, that God will take care of me ultimately. Am I going to be in pain like this forever? Will I ever get to enjoy my life like before?

I got out thinking I had some sort of heart attack and walked a couple miles in the cold (but had my jacket.) my mind at that point is kind of still out of synch and driving to work I had another situation like in class, but letting in cold air helped a little, I could feel my legs become twitchy and once I got to work it helped a little to raise my arms above my chest and walk around. My throat also felt dry and I was able to get some water down but with some difficulty. my mind is still somewhat disoriented and my reaction time seems to be decreased slightly.

However, when I've told my mom that she's says "what it works right away for me" She tells me that she skips a day and doesn't take Lexapro on purpose and then will take it the next day saying it works better. At Christmas dinner she took 2 pills saying it gives her more energy and makes her happier. My mom plays with it.       Does Lexapro really work like that or is my mom mistaken? Can you really skip a day and then take it the next and it ends up stronger effect?

Basically i am just wondering if it could even survive being put through the trash process..it was just a small laptop hard drive outside of its case..usually if you just drop them they are toast. i also heard the trash from my town goes to the local power plant to be incincerated so the only chance it could have been found is point a to point b. What do you guys think?      I cant seem to get these thoughts out of my head and this has completely taken over my life..any help would be great i am really suffering here, i just really dont know what else to do..i am on paxil and have considered therapy but i dont know if that will even help me..       I have always had obsessions throughout my life. But not one that has gripped one so violently like this. I am sure people are sick of seeing me ask this, but it is theraputic for me to get reassurance, although i know it is not a solution. I guess i just feel silly seekign therapy for something so ridiculous. It is embarrassing.      I want to try and get over this without going to therapy, i am just not sure how.

20090205180731AAS8azx	Health;Women's Health	Help any one with knowledge on street drugs and the behavior they will cause?	Okay I know my 17year old step daughter has smoked up before, we talked and she said she only did it once and that was the end of it. So I have been keeping a pretty tight rein on her activities. I can not how ever control what she does at lunch or during her spare at school. I have noticed her behaviour is different, strange even. Like today for instance, she came home from school after volleyball practise and had dinner then had a nap (that in its self is unusual). When she woke up she has been strange ever since, such as giggly and loud, she has eaten a whole bag of chips (big bag) and 4 large soup bowls of ice cream and shes still at it. She was running down the hall so fast to get more food she darn near ran over me. Then the biggest thing of all as we where sitting there watching csi I noticed she was staring at the window, after asking her what she was doing she asked me if I could not see Charlie the Unicorn out in the driveway. I thought at first she was joking but she was dead serious. Help any suggestions for a Mom that does not know all the signs I perhaps need to be looking for. I am very worried that her so called smoking up once (which I really did not believe it was only once) has turned into so much more?

20090205180848AAtlHxu	Health;Diseases & Conditions;Skin Conditions	Part of my lip turns red where I used to have a cold sore, when i eat.?	About 2 months ago I got a coldsore on my lip. I usually get them every few months, one at a time and they it goes away and my lip gets  normal.   This time when it went away and i immediately got another in the same spot. It took a little longer to heal and it pretty much went completely away. But then i noticed the spot where it was getting red so i started applying the cream again..  Now EVERYDAY for the pass month and a half the spot is a little discolored when i wake up but barely noticeable usually. Throughout the day it will get red randomly sometimes. It ALWAYS gets red when I eat.  this is not my whole lip. just the spot where the cold sore was. in all honesty sometimes it resembles a very very badly chapped looking lip but only a small section.     Ive used Lysine +, Abreva, Caramax, Blistex... NOTHING makes it better.   When i used to use abreva, lysine and the cold sore medication it would go away within a week. This DOES NOT. I am convinced it is not the reminance of a lingering cold sore but maybe the cold sore medication damaged my lip? I am afraid to stop using the lysine on it because i do no want it to blow up into another cold sore : /. Ive been afraid to eat or drink in public because it is just really embarrassing to me. I constantly feel that when i see someone looking at me and they lick their lips or wipe their lips its because they are looking at mine.  Needless to say its hurting my confidence  : /    I have already seen alot of posts that seem similar to what im saying but i have yet to see an answer. Please if their is someone out there with this problem, post, so we can work this out together.

20090205180941AAqhptu	Health;Men's Health	Guys need some serious help?!?!?!?	I have been Jelqing ( penis enlargement)for about 5 months now, since I have started jelqing I noticed red spots on my glans. I used to improperly jelq( I jelqed my glans rather than just my penis) and the red spots became more prominent and even painful. I would take a week rest but after one jelq routine, they would be back right away. So I decided to fully stop jelqing, after 3 full weeks.. No progress.. There still there. So then I searched around and I found that Arnica gel helps. Well, I go buy a 75g bottle and use it. At first it seemed to helped but after another full month of practically using up the entire bottle.it's still there and as red as always. This is REALLY pissing me off because I haven't touched my penis for 2 month( no jelqing or masturbating) but the red dots are still there(and quite sensitive). I am believing to think that I made a hole in my inner foreskin layer ( http://www.cirp.org/pages/anat/).  Is there anything I can do?          BTW there is NO WAY I am gonna go see the doctor, it's something that would destroy my self confidence.

I wrapped myself in a blanket and I was still cold. then I started getting diarhea. I kept having a nauseating feeling also but I didn't actually vomit. today I went to school and I started to feel hot and then id feel cold. when I got home from school I started noticing rashes on my feet. It started to spread around and now its also on my calves. can someone explain to me what this is? and how do I get rid of it? thanks.

20090205181830AABMN3j	Health;Diseases & Conditions;Infectious Diseases	Does anyone know if Ritz Bits Peanut butter crackers are part of the peanut butter salmonella scare?	I bought some Peanut Butter Ritz Bits just about a week ago. It never even crossed my mind about the salmonella thing. I don't really watch the news, so I hadn't heard much about it. Well, I've finished the box by now, and earlier today I happened to catch the news while waiting in the doctor's office and they were talking about the peanut butter recall. I didn't hear them say anything about Ritz crackers, but I came in in the middle of it. My husband and I had both had diarrhea the last couple of days, and seeing that made us wonder if it was from those crackers. My husband will probably be okay, and I'm sure I will too, but I'm 15 weeks pregnant, so I'm a little more worried. Should I at least call my doctor and run this by him and see what he says about it? And does anyone know for sure whether or not the Ritz crackers were part of that recall?

I'm pretty much incapable of making any of my fingers 100% straight, the only ones that come close are the pointer and pinky, all the others bend back way to far no matter how hard I try to point them straight.

Everything changed when we moved in together and he is totally different. He always wants to know where i am going, who i am with & how long im gonna be out. We live in New Jersey & i have to travel into New York for work, i work ever hour i can to be away from him. He has this idea that i am cheating on him which i am not, im not that type of person at all. He is part of a very rough crowd and i hate them. I try my hardest to stay away from them.He has a very short fuse & gets pissed with me alot but always says he loves me so much, i don't know if i believe it though. I HATE our se life. Alot of my friends live in NY so i go there on some nights out with them. The other night when he came home i was on my way out with friends and he grabbed my arm and just kept staring at me & never said anything, i told him i was just going out with my friend eventually he let me go, i got terrified & knew i needed to get away from him.Another day when i was going out he put me up against the wall. I know he has a tendency to be violent as i have seen him beat a guy just for bumping into me. He shouts at me if i want to go somewhere with out him, even if the place doesn't involve him he wants to be there. Im not his property and he is starting to scare me, im only 25 i don't need to be scared. Im doing everything i can to not fall pregnant for him. Please help me with advice in how to go about leaving.   Thanks alot :)

The doc gave me some antibiotics because i was throwing up and had a high fever. the antibiotics started to help after a few days, but then all of a sudden it started to get worse.. i went to the doc again this monday because i was starting to cough alot and my throat was killing. n then last friday i started to cough up blood in the morning, and it has been happening ever since (for the past 6 days), but only in the mornings. I cough up about 5 table spoons of blood, mixed with mucus. during the day my mucus is just white, and kind of yellowish too. on Monday i went for a chest xray and was told i have bronchitis, so was put on some more antibiotics.. but so far has not helped very much. my throat has stopped hurting, but that might b bcuz of a new cough syrup, because i am still coughing alot..   Anybody have know what this could be?    Is the coughing up blood dangerous? will it lead to something bad?   thanks in advance

On my way home from work a couple nights ago, I was just driving when I noticed that when I looked at lights, stoplights and street lights, there was a huge halo around them.  Like 20 times the diameter of the light. I kinda got freaked out a little bit as I have never noticed them before that bad. I kinda figured I would have at least noticed that the last 27 years or so I have been seeing.      Anyways all tests came back perfect and had 0 problems.  I wear contacts and glasses, and I have noticed this wearing contacts and glasses. I cannot really tell without either of them because my vision is blurry without a prescriptions.

My period started way early, like almost a week ago (about Jan.29). For  3-4 days it was pretty much non-existant, and when i saw bits of it was brown and very gooey. Now my period is still very very light (still wearing panty liners) I tried a light day tampon, and it came out with very very little blood, mostly brown but with a little bright red.    Over the last few days (about Monday) I've have a feeling of nausea almost constantly, especially when I'm moving around but (like now) when I'm sitting down it still feels present. I'm more tired in the mornings then I usually am, after a 7-8 hour sleep, and I also get frequent dizzy spells during the day.    Am I pregnant..or what's wrong with me?? This has NEVER happened before, and..I'm alittle freaked out.I would have to walk to get tests, and the nearest place is stupidly expensive...I don't want to go buy them if no one thinks I'm not, but if you think I am, I will go get them. Please help.

But I have noticed that there is a significant dent on both nails of my big toe. It is growing out now, but it's as though the part of the nail closest to the cuticle is "lower" then a kind of ridge and the rest of the nail sits slightly higher. I have had no change in shoes... I am wondering if this is a deficiency of some sort. I do strive for a healthy diet. I am 33 and healthy, and live a healthy lifestyle.

20090205190837AAqhfzk	Health;Diet & Fitness	Is it wrong to count calories?	My older step son is getting kind of heavy it is affecting his activity and breathing. He gets winded quite often and it is truly painful to watch and hear. He is 6 years old. I am currently dieting to get into shape, Im not heavy woman in fact I've always been on the slender side. For myself I count every calorie intake, and it's worked out quite well for me. I also eat everything to it's exact serving size and the results are amazing.      I would like t do this for my step son, feed him to the exact serving size, with fresh snacks, plenty of water and have him excersize with me for an hour a day. I feel like it would do him so good because he eats even when he isn't hungry and his mom and my husband don't stop him.   My problem is, is it wrong to do that? To count the calories he intakes, am I wrong for wanting to do this? Im afraid he will end up with diabetes at age 15. ( we have never acknowledge his weight to him, we believe it's wrong to tell him he is getting big.)

20090205191406AAhe70i	Health;General Health Care;Other - General Health Care	Sleep Test and Medical Coverage?	A few months ago a doctor gave me a referral for a sleep test.  However, at the time I was on temporary coverage since I was removed from my father's work plan from having graduated from college.  After getting the sleep test cost estimate of over $3,000 my temporary wouldn't cover, the referral has been sitting there.        Now, I finally will be getting full coverage soon with Cigna that comes with my new job.  My question is, will Cigna cover the in lab polysomnography for diagnoses of sleep apnea, even though the referral was given prior to the start of their coverage?        I have found a recent policy that Cigna does cover such procedures, but I need to know if having pre-admittance referral will effect getting covered. Let me know thanks!
