20090223160539AAnxjX3	Health;Diet & Fitness	Mental/physical effects of carb deprivation?	So I lost 20 pounds eliminating processed foods and most carbs with the exception of fruit and low glycemic veggies.  After about six weeks, and about the time I stepped up my fitness regimen, I noticed a change in my demeanor.  I got REALLY moody.  Then this past weekend, I physically couldnt stop myself from going on a carb binge.  Every now and then I would allow myself something, but Id make sure it was just one serving.  But saturday I polished off the better portion of some Garden of Eatin tortilla chips, peanuts, graham crackers, and some water crackers with jelly.  All washed down with several cups of coffee.  Then I felt normal again.  I didnt feel that guilty, because I made sure it was nonfat stuff (as opposed to binging on something like pizza/chicken wings/etc).  But I could swear it was unavoidable, I felt like my body really needed carbs, it was weird.  Plus, I wasnt busy like during the week when Im working and can distract myself from thinking about food.  Can your body take control of your mind at some point, and drive you to carbohydrates??

The last time I remember having a flat stomach was at the age of 5, since then I've been a pretty fat little kid, hitting puberty I began to grow up and no longer outwards. Now two months away from being 18 years old, I realised I never thought I'd still have this "puppy fat" (some call it), and it's time to get rid of it for good.      I fit into 32" jeans, but my stomach bulges above at a large 38.5" inches, belly and muffin tops. I'm 5"8 and almost 160 pounds.      I currently have the opportunity to run 5 days a week, I started tonight, doing a mixture of walking/jogging/running for 3 miles, followed by 100 sit-ups. I'm also cutting out snacking, and probabaly replacing with some kinda of oat bar.      I know that everyone is different, but I would like to know what I am doing right and wrong, and if it is possible to lose my belly in 2 months of this routine.      I'd love to have a flat stomach, but the main thing is I want to look healthy and be confident with my body and the clothes I wear.      Thanks yo!

Now we have come back, And I have like no acne... I can just feel like a few bumps on my forehead which aren't really visible to others. So does it sound like the warm weather cleared up my acne? Would me getting a tan have anything to do with this? because I got a pretty dark tan while I was there lol.

20090223161158AAo3hNJ	Health;Diseases & Conditions;Heart Diseases	8 yr old son with murmer? Please answer my question.?	hi all my son who is 8 and a half yrs old was born with a heart murmer. He attended our local outpatients clinic once a yr to be checked until he was 4. Our doctors then suggested he visit Our Lady's hospital for Sick Children to see a specialist and have tests as usually the hole in the heart (murmer) would have closed by itself but it hadn't. Anyway to make a long story short the doc's there were happy with him and said he should be fine, not to worry about it. and he was to go back for another checkup when he was 8. He hasn't been called yet. My worry is for the last 2-3 weeks every now and then he has been compaining with left sided chest pain, especially after excerising ie. running while playing. He also said that when the pain goes it feels cold inside his chest. And that he feels out of breath so soon after running. Is this something to worry about?? Sorry my Q, was so long!!!

The dentist I go to is super nice. He has one dental assistant (a woman about 60). His wife used to work as a dental assistant too but haven't seen her in a while. I don't know rather she got a new job or he only needs or wants one dental assistant. It's kind of a small dentist office.   Anyway, I'm really comfortable with this guy and would like to work for him because he's so nice but it doesn't look like he needs another dental assistant but I could be wrong. Should I ask my dentist if he needs more help or should I go to a bigger dentist office where they need more assistance first.

Anyways, I couldn't get it fully erect for a while, so when I finally focused, and I became erect and pushed it to the limit and came. After that, my heart was beating incredibly fast, hard, and I felt a little weak. It went away after like 5 minutes, but then 10 minutes later, chest pains started to come around? It hurt enough to keep me from not being able to fall asleep until I found a good position to rest where I didn't feel it as much.       What could be wrong?  Have you experienced this before?       Also, i'm sick right now with a sore throat, stomache ache, cold symptoms, headaches, and i'm really hot. In other words, the flu probably.

20090223164547AAcY1iQ	Health;Diseases & Conditions;Other - Diseases	What would you make of this from my symptoms?	For the last couple of weeks, I've been feeling very strange. I've been having back pain from the choreography of our competition show for show choir. I am also on a new ADD medication, Daytrana (this is my third medication in the last 10 years.) And yes, it does have side effects. Within the last week and a half, everything about me has changed.      Here's a list of what's been going on:      -Severe back pain (I've been taking care of it with physical therapy and icing it and taking Ibuprofen)   -Constant stomach pain (the kind where you feel like you could just throw up)   -Lack of sleep (there are nights where I will sleep like a rock and others where I'll either wake up constantly or I'll be awake all night; I mostly can't sleep though)   -Decreased appetite (I'm very picky and I always have been so I've never really been on that much of a healthy diet; however, within the last few weeks, my stomach just doesn't want to take in very much food and I always have a stomach ache for long periods of time during the day and the night)   -Weight loss (I'm always losing weight but I've been losing more weight recently than I have in the last few months)   -Constant change in body temperature (My parents keep our house colder than they used to because of the whole energy/money-saving crap; I always wear a hoodie to school because of the freezing cold temperatures inside; even when I'm in warm areas, I constantly feel cold; and all weekend, I checked my temperature a few times a day, and my temperature was always lower than it was before (I think the lowest was about 95.2 degrees)   -Hands and feet constantly cold (Refer to the last one; my hands and feet will stay cold for hours, especially my hands)   -Constant weakness (I feel like all of my energy has been sucked out of me)   -Dizziness (I feel dizzy at random times)   -Nausea (I've been feeling nauseated since Thursday)   -This one is hard to explain but it's something like this (Whenever I lay down at night on either of my sides, it feels like the very end of my rib cage is pushing against something; I'm not sure if it's my spleen or my appendix or my kidneys or whatever)   -Slight burning/tingling sensation on the back of my neck up by my head and in my throat (It was very awkward to have that feeling)      That pretty much sums it up. I'd like to know what could be going on inside of me. Or what is wrong with me. I'd like some clarification on this. Please help me. Thank you! =]

Our mom said that because the infection went so long without being treated, she got a blood infection and that's why she is so sick now. Today, the doctors said my sister is in septic shock . They are holding out that she won't go into a coma. I don't know what this means but my grandparents told me it is a very serious blood infection and he could die if she goes into a coma. Also, if she goes into a coma even if she lives it could mean she would have brain damage. At the hospitals, he was sleeping and I didn't go in her room, even though my grandparents begged me to go and see her and kiss her, I didn't want to because I didnt want to look at her like that! they said her kidneys are starting to fail. can she live from a septic shock?? i don't even fully understand what it is. and is it wrong that i didn't go in there and see her.

Also, I've had bad stomach aches twice since my last period, where my abdomen is swollen with a constant dull pain.  I've also experienced some spotting, on and off again since the first stomach pains.  Does anyone think that either of these things is causing my period to be late, or does anyone have any idea if my stomach pains are period related?   In case this is relevant, the possibility of pregnancy is extremely slim.  I have not have sex, though there was a time where there was penis/vagina contact...but no sex.   Thank you so much for any advice.

I took my 8 year old to the doctor today and was advised in general that she wants him to come back in a couple weeks to do some tests with the central nervous system because she feels that there may be an issue in this area. This is cause for concern becuase my son is currently taking medication for his ADHD, ODD and Bi-Polar disorder. In addition to, recently he has been having seziures too. These are not just titles associated with this child for that if he wasn't on the medication he would be extreamly unmanageable and a danger to himself and other children.

20061223000404AAfZdp0	Health;Diet & Fitness	Do you agree with article below about so-called vitamin B6 being bad for you?	Below quoted from:  http://www.brojon.org/frontpage/bomber/b...       B6 is added, since it is a simple and stable synthetic chemical which does not degrade with age or cooking. It is also very cheap and adding 100% RDA costs almost nothing. But it is NOT a vitamin. It is not found in any natural food. And there is no natural form of B6. It is not a food. It's just a chemical.      It's a long story, which I will tell in a later article. But the average person in America, and now throughout the world, who eats a bowl of cereal for breakfast, a McBurger bun for lunch and other snacks and desserts, gets about 1,000% or ten times the RDA for B6. That is an extreme overdose of B6. This stops all the natural tryptophan in the diet from ever getting into the brain, to become the neurochemicals serotonin and melatonin. B6 is THE SOURCE of the so-called "chemical imbalance in the brain" which affects about half the population. If you were ever diagnosed as have a "brain chemical imbalance,"

After I go to the bathroom (loose watery yellow stool) with diarrhea, my body gives off an offensive odor. Kind of like a real bad BO that can fill a room. I also tend to sweat alot easily and this smell usually lasts for a day or two. Even after a shower, the smell is still there. I've been diagnosed with colitis and IBS but even when I watch what I eat, it still happens. My stomach is very sensitive (throbbing heartbeat like), blurry vision, fatigue and my skin is overly sensitive (redness).  I've done every test possible, but no one seems to know what the problem is aside from it being a symptom of IBS or colitis. I am also lactose intolerant but dairy is not an issue since I have none in my diet. Now is there anything I can take to rid of the odor quicker? I'm thinking there's just toxins in my blood and when I tend to sweat easily, it emits through my pours but that's just a theory of mine. TIA

I'm currently on a diet right now, but these past couple of days I have been drinking about 2 16oz cups of iced green tea with honey everyday.. would this mess up my weight loss in anyway? I work out at lot. I run/jog for at least 40 minutes twice a day, i do 25 regular crunches, 25 bicycle manuever crunches, 25 oblique crunches, at least 15 minutes on my ablounge, 10 minutes worth of wall squats, and 10 minutes of lunges and this is just my morning routine..I do the same routine at night too. Right now I currently weigh 135lbs, I'm 5'5". I don't eat junk food, or drink sodas or eat anything sweet like candy and stuff. Would I also benefit from drinking green tea with honey? THANKS SO MUCH!!         jenii

Dont jump on the scales and say your overweight, theres all sorts of contributing factors to mass such as, muscle, bone water and fat. Use a bodyfat measure instead or even better get a VLA done.      300 calories is about what you should get in a meal, sometimes more depending on you size and goals.      Exercise and stop asking for quick fix solutions, the weight wont stay off if you starve yourself, its not healthy and you probably dont enjoy it.      Eat carbs, they arent the enemy   Eat good fats.... fat helps lose fat   Eat protein      Be happy about who you are and not what you are. If your genuinely overweight then eat healthy and exercise more than normal.       I'm currently taking in around 3500 calories a day, combined with cardio and weights and losing bodyfat.      Rant over!!!

It also hurts every now and then when doing every day activities. I've started crying it's hurt so bad sometimes. I don't know if this may effect or be an effect from whatever this is, but I also recently have obtained some sort of bladder problem. Overactive bladder, that is. The doctor has said the bladder problem is not a UTI, yeast infection, or other type of infection. So, I don't really know what it's from. I'm only 16, so I think it's a little unusual, but whatever. Anyhow, another thing is that my menstruation cycle is very irregular. Sometimes I won't for four months. And I don't get any spotting. So, I'm just pretty confused with what's going on here and wondered if anyone could help. I haven't seen an gyn and don't want to be told "go see a doctor". I wouldn't be asking if I had the opportunity to at this moment. Thanks in advance!

Last year, I was overweight, ate junk food all day, got hardly any sleep and was depressed. My under-eye area was flawless.      Now that I'm ALOT healthier (Nowadays, I consider oat and whole-wheat to be junk food, so you can imagine how healthy I eat), now that I get 8-9 hours of sleep, now that I drink ALOT more water than before, now that I'm always in a good mood, now that I'm skinnier, my under-eye area looks TERRIBLE. I have purple-ish dark circles and you can see-through the skin so much that you can see a blue vein, and the capillaries, extending from my nose all the way down to the SIDES of my face!      Why is that? Should I get back to my old UNHEALTHY routine? Maybe that will cure all my problems... including my skin problems (acne) which I never experienced in my lifetime.

He's had to do this twice, and everytime it's messed up again when I get home.       It doesn't affect my eating or chewing or anything, it's just kind of annoying and uncomfortable to bite down and not have a correct bite.       Has this happened to anyone else before?

(I switch up my routine, too. Sometimes I'll do pilates, running, or swimming instead of the elliptical.)      My goal is 154 by April 13th but now I'm afraid I can't lose anymore! I've tried cutting down to 1400 but still I've been the same. Now I'm starting to gain weight again. (162 the last time I weighed.) I don't know what it happening?      Could it be stress? Lack of sleep? Should I just wait it out?      Please help!

20080804214820AArNqJw	Health;Diet & Fitness	Weight Gain and School Food, ECT	Note: I'm not so sure where to put this...      *sigh* I'm not really sure that anyone can help me with this. It's also abit random.      Anyways, I'm a bit bummed out, simply because A) School is starting soon and B) The food.      Last year I started High School, I had been homeschooling a few years before that. I've always been a bit heavy, and figured being in school might help me to loose weight. Well, I gained it instead.      It just stinks! Everything there is so unhealthy. And if you want to eat decent, then it costs you. I mean, I want water, but water isn't free, milk is.       I would eat salad everyday.... however, they don't have good quality, and I grew up on veggies, I love veggies. So I can't settle for anything less than good quality produce. Theres also that little fact that, oh tsk, all the things I want are on the back of the bar, which I cannot reach. And even when the lunch ladies see you stuggling to get said veggie, they don't help.      Has anyone ever done anything to change the menu in their cafeteria? I really want to make changes, and I know other people do, but I'm not sure HOW.      It's not just the food either, but it's a big part of the problem. I'm bothered by the fact that they don't allow kids to drink in class. Water even. Aren't we told to drink tons of water a day? That it helps to remain full and awake? So we spend half our day at school and are expected to get half that water in durring a 30 minute break? What a smart idea.... it will so totally work!      So, does anyone know how to get people to listen to you in these cases? For a long time I've wanted to change things about my life, and the world I live in.... but I usually get fed up because no one cares- they loose that desire to change things to.

Okay well before i say anything, this is kinda gross and please, don't say "Idk, go to the doctor". thnxx      Okay so usually, my periods are regular flow, and sometimes i get really bad cramps, and sometimes diariah, but that's about it.    But I got my period Thursday afternoon (and i still am on it). It was regular at first, until yesterday morning there was barley like any blood. I also felt reeeeally sick like i was going to puke, but i went to school anyways. So then in my first class my stomache hurt really bad, and i went to the bathroom. I had really bad diareah. Then at lunch i only drank my water because I felt sick when ever i swallowed. I felt sick the rest of the day. ( i had to run to the bathroom TONS of times at school and at home ). Then I went to bed and i woke up in the middle of the night and felt sick, so i went to the bathroom and puked for the longest time ever. Then i had diariah for the 4858 time again. I had to take 3 tests today so i didnt want to miss school, so i went. I only had diariah a little today, but i felt extremely sick this morning. I was really tired all day too. I also felt to sick to eat anything at lunch again. What the heck to you think i have?      *Is it just from my period?   *Is it the flu? ( but i dont have a stuffy or runny nose)   *is it something I ate?   *???      thanks for any helpp. :]

20081229171356AAvYklA	Health;Diet & Fitness	Are there any diet drinks that can help teen girls lose weight?	I'm not overweight i just want to slim down a little and lose only a few pounds. I want to drink meal replacement drinks instead of eating big meals. I was going to try drinking carnation breakfast drink in the morning because I never have time to make a good breakfast in the morning because of school. Then have a boost for lunch but i heard boost makes you gain weight and then eat a normal dinner with maybe grilled chicken or fish with a salad. Plus go to the gym 3 or 4 times a week. Will this work? If not what are some good diet drinks that help you lose weight but for a teenage girl?
