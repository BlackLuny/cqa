C'est une question de logique.  Il existe ncessairement quelque chose d'ternel car si  un moment du temps rien n'existait alors rien n'aurait jamais exist puisque rien en peut sortir du nant. Ce quelque chose d'ternel qui existe ncessairement, ce n'est pas le monde matriel car la matire se dgrade et l'nergie se dissipe (univers non clos). Ds lors ce quelque chose d'ternel est de nature spirituelle, c'est Dieu.  Dieu est l'Etre ncessaire, c'est  dire Celui sans qui rien n'existerait. Il est la cause premire cd Celui dont tout dcoule et qui Lui-mme ne provient pas de quelque chose qui Lui soit extrieur: Il tire son existence de sa propre essence.  Par divers raisonnements, on peut aussi arriver  la notion de perfection de Dieu. Possdant toutes les perfections, Il se suffit  Lui-mme puisque rien ne Lui manque. Il a donc cr l'homme par pure bont de fa?on  lui permettre, si l'homme le veut, de participer  Son bonheur ternel.  Ayant cr l'homme de telle fa?on que Lui seul puisse le combler, Il sait que l'homme va Le rechercher. Etant infiniment bon, Il ne peut le laisser chercher en vain. Dieu s'est donc ncessairement manifest. Il a laiss un message  l'homme, une Rvlation. Afin que l'homme ne se laisse pas garer par les esprits mauvais oupar les religions inventes par d'autres hommes, Dieu donne ncessairement des signes divins pour montrer dans quelle religion se trouve la Vrit qu'Il a rvle. La seule religion a avoir une suite ininterrompue de miracles (signes divins) depuis le dbut de son existence et encore rgulirementd e nos jours, c'est le catholicisme. C'est une religion difficile et exigente, mais c'est celle voulue par Dieu.

Une raison est pour pouvoir expliquer pourquoi on est ici.  Est on vraiment ici par pur hasard, au milieu de plantes danimaux et autant de crations faites pour nous?

Ces 5 sens sont la seule connexion que tu as avec la vraie ralit totale.  Si tu cherches Dieu avec un de tes 5 sens, tu risques d'tre d?ue.    Le Coran nous enseigne que Dieu a cr l'univers avec facilit.  Cette contrainte espace-temps dans laquelle nous sommes prisionniers, eh bien Dieu n'en dpend pas, il est en dehors.    (Parenthse :J'en profite pour rappeler que Dieu nous avait dj renseign sur le Big Bang avant les dcouvertes du 20e sicle  :  Sourate 21, Verset 30.  ------------------  Ceux qui ont mcru, n'ont-ils pas vu que les cieux et la terre formaient une masse compacte? Ensuite Nous les avons spars et fait de l'eau toute chose vivante. Ne croiront-ils donc pas ?  -----------------  Fermons la parenthse).    Je vais te raconter une petite histoire pour s'appuyer sur un exemple clair.  Ca se passe dans un ordinateur.  --------------------------------------...  C'est un fichier qui parle  un curseur en forme de petite flche blanche.    Le curseur dit au fichier :   - Tu sais que derrire l'cran, il y a une certaine Avemaria (toi) qui contr?le notre monde ?  - Avemaria ? Rpond le fichier.  - Bah oui, c'est un humain. Il rlchit par lui-mme.  - N'importe quoi !  - Si je t'assure !  - Ah oui ? Et pourquoi je ne le vois pas ?  - Parce qu'il est derrire l'cran, dans la 3e dimension.  - Mais bien s?r, et moi je suis le Pape et toi t'as fum la moquette.  - Je suis srieux, il est bien l et il nous voit.  - Il nous voit ? Nous et tous les autres ?  - Eh oui.   - Comment il fait ? Il est dans quelle fentre ?  - Il est pas dans une fentre.  - Il est sur le bureau alors ?  - Non.  - Il est forcment dans un des dossiers bon sang !  - Non, je te dis. Il est pas dans notre monde.   - Ah, j'ai compris, il est pas dans Windows, il est dans le Bios ou dans MS-Dos ou dans une cl USB, c'est ?a ?  - Mais non !   - C'est quoi comme fichier ce Avemaria alors, un mp3, un jpg ? Il pse combien de Mo ?  - C'est pas un fichier. Il est en dehors du monde informatique. Il le contr?le et ne dpend pas de ses lois. Au contraire, il les tablit les lois.  - En dehors de l'ordinateur ?! Mais y'a rien en dehors de l'ordinateur. Ou du moins, j'arrive pas  en sortir.  - Et pourtant c'est vrai.    La flche rpte  nouveau :  - Mais t'as pas rpondu, il pse combien de Mo ?  Alors le fichier n'en peut plus d'expliquer et il abandonne.  Il se dit que le curseur comprendra un jour le sens de sa vie et qu'il n'est pas un curseur juste pour tre un curseur jusqu' ce que l'ordinateur tombre en panne.  --------------------------------------...  Fin de l'histoire.    Si tu n'as aucun lien avec Dieu par tes 5 sens, c'est normal. Sinon, ce serait comme de voir les rponses avant la fin de l'examen.  Si tu dois me rembourser de l'argent et que je ne vrifie pas s'il y a le compte, j'ai confiance, j'ai foi en toi.    Le mrite c'est le fait d'avoir la foi.   Sourate 2   Verset  2  C'est le Livre au sujet duquel il n'y a aucun doute, c'est un guide pour les pieux .   Verset 3.   qui croient  l'invisible et accomplissent la Salat et dpensent [dans l'obissance  Allah], de ce que Nous leur avons attribu   --------------------------------------...  Et puis vu ton pseudo (Avemaria), je te conseille de jetter un coup d'oeil  la sourate 19 du Coran.  Voici un site o tu peux trouver l'intgralit du Livre sacr http://www.orientalement.com/n-saint-cor...        Je finis par ce copier-coller que j'ai l'habitude de joindre :  LES 5 PILIERS DE L'ISLAM  :    1-Croire en l'unicit de Dieu et l'authenticit du statut de prophte de Muhammad.(PSL)  -->Le magazine Science & Vie n1055 d'Ao?t 2005 ( http://www.philo5.com/Cogitations/051130... ) nous explique que le cerveau humain est con?u pour croire. C'est prvu. Si tu ne crois pas, il y aura toujours un manque psychologique en toi = suicide, anorexie, pdophilie...etc.      2-Faire la prire.  C'est ce qui certifie cette foi rclame par notre conscience.   On dit "prire" mais c'est pas dans le sens de "faire un voeu" c'est un acte de foi, une sance spirituelle et physique  la fois, lors de laquelle tu rcites le Coran (entra?nement de la mmoire) en mditant.  En gros, tu retrouves les avantages du yoga mais 5 fois par jour.  On ne rcite pas les versets du Coran avec le livre sous les yeux. On les apprend obligatoirement par coeur.  Mais on les oublie un peu, alors on rvise rgulirement et on entretient sa mmoire durant toute la vie. Une prvention radicale contre la maladie d'Alzheimer.  Et puis l'homme est un mammifre qui est sens marcher  4 pattes. On marche debout et c'est pourquoi le grand mal de ce sicle c'est le mal de dos. Le corps supporte son propre poids.  On doit rtablir l'quilibre naturel en faisant nos 5 prires quotidiennes o on se prosterne, annulant ainsi toute chance de mal de dos.   Quand on se prosterne de la sorte plusieurs fois par jour, l'irrigation du cerveau est  facilite, favorisant ainsi une bonne sant physique et mentale.      3-Je?ner.  A propos de sant :  En je?nant, chaque anne, tu offres 30 jours de rpit  ton corps et ton systme digestif et tout ton mtabolisme. Un ditticien ou un gastro-entrologue t'expliquera mieux que moi les bienfaits de la dite.  Je?ner te permet aussi de ressent|`|8shcTisnaa	Est-ce que c'est en Dieu que tu as de la difficult  croire ou en la religion?

s1zitZMOaa	No! On what grounds does she think she has the right to demand you marry her and her boyfriend???     Now I am not a lawyer or a legal expert of any kind, but I am pretty sure your Pagan-ness does not put you in a special category that requires you to abide by different rules.     You have every right to set guidelines. If what she is trying to do is even legal (she may have her parents permission and marriage license in hand), you still have the right to refuse services.   You aren't obliged to provide her anything. All services are provided within certain guidelines. There are rules for everything.

That said I think its actually illegal to marry a minor with out their parents consent (or proof they have "divorced" their parents and are independent, which you can do at 16 here). But that might be around here.  A 16 year old is considered a minor in most places I think.  Marriage is a legal contract and a minor can not enter into one and have it hold.     I also think that clergy/judges can refuse to marry someone on the grounds of "impaired judgement" of the people involved or similar things.    All that said I think your request of "pre-marriage counselling" is perfectly valid.  Many clergy require that (though I'm not sure on the time frames, as in 1 year might be unreasonable). Don't know about the legality of that though.

I see a pattern forming here :o)    Goethe: "To meditate is to labour; to think is to act."    this is a human capacity that works both ways; if you go over something in your mind before you do it you may do it better, this is very helpful as you need to imagine how things might could go under certain circumstances.   If you go over something in your mind and you decide not to act on it, that may be caused by 'conditioning' due to 'reprimands' or 'social out casting' - certain 'mind scenarios' have repercussions (society & humanitarian laws)    You can think about cheating on someone, but you may not actually do it because you are conditioned to value a life / relationship. If you have not been conditioned that far there is social out casting to consider. Aldultry will have consequences (many) that will affect yours and other lives if you 'think' you can get away with it .. you may actually attempt it to see what is in your mind can become reality. In all it is a lesser offence to commit adultry then to murder someone, hence the consequences may not be as impacting / severe but thare are conswquences nonetheless..     Is it actually a sin? - this is up for debate.. it depends on how guilty you feel when thinking about it or even when acting on it.

AA11622964	You would get one dumb cat. lol|`|AA11827424	Not even cats have nine lives anymore. Inflation has got to them.|`|mqV9TOv0aa	Only if the CAT believed in Shamanism http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shamanism      ME!    Why do people say that cats have nine lives?  http://www.coolquiz.com/trivia/explain/d...  Some people believe in the superstition that cats have nine lives, because cats can survive falls from high places with few, if any injuries. This gives the appearance that the cats return to life after sustaining a fatal accidents. Granted, they may sustain minor injuries, such as bloody noses, cracked teeth, or a few broken ribs, but they live to recover.    The ability of the cat to survive these accidents that would kill humans or other animals is not due to multiple lives, but to several advantages they possess. Their small size and low body weight soften the impact as they make contact with the ground after falling from great heights.     The highly developed inner ears of cats equip them with an unusually keen sense of balance, which is critical to their landing on their feet. This sense of balance allows a cat falling upside down to right himself by rapidly determining his position, repositioning himself, and making any adjustments necessary to ensure that he lands on all fours.    Since cats land on all four paws, the impact from landing on the ground is absorbed by all four. Additionally, cats bend their legs when they land, which cushions the impact by spreading the impact, not only through bones that could easily break, but through the joints and muscles as well.    Most are surprised to learn that a cat stands a greater chance of survival if it falls from a higher place than from a lower place. New York veterinarians gathered data from their feline patients, which clearly supports this fact. Ten percent of their patients died after falling from 2-6 stories, while only five percent of the fatalities occurred when their patients fell from 7-32 stories     Laws of physics explain why these survival rates vary. All falling bodies, regardless or their masses, accelerate by 22 miles per hour per second of their falls. The falling object, after traveling a certain distance through the air reaches a final speed, or "terminal velocity," because the objects friction with the air slows the fall. The smaller the objects mass, and the greater its area, the more it will slow.    A cat falling from a higher floor, after it stops accelerating, spreads its legs into an umbrella shape, which increases the area against which the air must push and increases the friction, thus slowing the cats fall. Through the cats highly developed sense of balance, he buys more time to maneuver his body in preparation for landing on all fours. A cat falling from a lower height does not have the opportunity to increase its bodys area, slow its fall, or position his body to land on all four feet.      .|`|BSttGuiUaa	I have news for you dear.

Macarius Notaras     To receive Communion the usual two or three times a year is good and helpful, but to receive Communion more frequently is far better. Remember, the nearer a person comes to the light, the more light he gets. The closer he draws to the fire, the warmer he is. The nearer he approaches sanctity, the more saintly he becomes.   In the same way, the more often one draws near to God in Communion, the more one receives light and warmth and holiness. My friend, if you are worthy to make your Communion two or three times a year, you are worthy of making it more often, as St. John Chrysostom tells us, by maintaining your own earlier preparation and worthiness. But what does stop us from taking Communion? The answer is our carelessness and laziness, and we give way to these faults so much that we are not sufficiently prepared to be able to receive Communion.     http://www.goarch.org/en/ourfaith/articl...

Her body was formed in the womb of the mother, and the father had the usual share in its formation.  The question does not concern the immaculateness of the generative activity of her parents.   Neither does it concern the passive conception absolutely and simply , which, according to the order of nature, precedes the infusion of the rational soul.  The person is truly conceived when the soul is created and infused into the body    Mary was preserved exempt from all stain of original sin at the first moment of her animation, and sanctifying grace was given to her before sin could have taken effect in her soul.    The formal active essence of original sin was not removed from her soul, as it is removed from others by baptism; it was excluded, it never was in her soul.     But she was not made exempt from the temporal penalties of Adam -- from sorrow, bodily infirmities, and death.     The immunity from original sin was given to Mary by a singular exemption from a universal law through the same merits of Christ, by which other men are cleansed from sin by baptism.   Mary needed the redeeming Saviour to obtain this exemption, and to be delivered from the universal necessity and debt of being subject to original sin.  The person of Mary, in consequence of her origin from Adam, should have been subject to sin, but, being the new Eve who was to be the mother of the new Adam, she was, by the eternal counsel of God and by the merits of Christ, withdrawn from the general law of original sin.   Her redemption was the very masterpiece of Christ's redeeming wisdom.   He is a greater redeemer who pays the debt that it may not be incurred than he who pays after it has fallen on the debtor.     Such is the meaning of the term "Immaculate Conception."  3 minutes ago - Edit - Delete   Source(s):  Genesis 3:15  No direct or categorical and stringent proof of the dogma can be brought forward from Scripture. But the first scriptural passage which contains the promise of the redemption, mentions also the Mother of the Redeemer. The sentence against the first parents was accompanied by the Earliest Gospel (Proto-evangelium), which put enmity between the serpent and the woman: "and I will put enmity between thee and the woman and her seed; she (he) shall crush thy head and thou shalt lie in wait for her (his) heel" (Genesis 3:15). The translation "she" of the Vulgate is interpretative; it originated after the fourth century, and cannot be defended critically. The conqueror from the seed of the woman, who should crush the serpent's head, is Christ; the woman at enmity with the serpent is Mary. God puts enmity between her and Satan in the same manner and measure, as there is enmity between Christ and the seed of the serpent. Mary was ever to be in that exalted state of soul which the serpent had destroyed in man, i.e. in sanctifying grace. Only the continual union of Mary with grace explains sufficiently the enmity between her and Satan. The Proto-evangelium, therefore, in the original text contains a direct promise of the Redeemer, and in conjunction therewith the manifestation of the masterpiece of His Redemption, the perfect preservation of His virginal Mother from original sin.     Luke 1:28  The salutation of the angel Gabriel -- chaire kecharitomene, Hail, full of grace (Luke 1:28) indicates a unique abundance of grace, a supernatural, godlike state of soul, which finds its explanation only in the Immaculate Conception of Mary. But the term kecharitomene (full of grace) serves only as an illustration, not as a proof of the dogma.     Other texts  From the texts Proverbs 8 and Ecclesiasticus 24 (which exalt the Wisdom of God and which in the liturgy are applied to Mary, the most beautiful work of God's Wisdom), or from the Canticle of Canticles (4:7, "Thou art all fair, O my love, and there is not a spot in thee"), no theological conclusion can be drawn. These passages, applied to the Mother of God, may be readily understood by those who know the privilege of Mary, but do not avail to prove the doctrine dogmatically, and are therefore omitted from the Constitution "Ineffabilis Deus". For the theologian it is a matter of conscience not to take an extreme position by applying to a creature texts which might imply the prerogatives of God.    Proof from Tradition  In regard to the sinlessness of Mary the older Fathers are very cautious: some of them even seem to have been in error on this matter.     Origen, although he ascribed to Mary high spiritual prerogatives, thought that, at the time of Christ's passion, the sword of disbelief pierced Mary's soul; that she was struck by the poniard of doubt; and that for her sins also Christ died (Origen, "In Luc. hom. xvii").   In the same manner St. Basil writes in the fourth century: he sees in the sword, of which Simeon speaks, the doubt which pierced Mary's soul (Epistle 259).   St. Chrysostom accuses her of ambition, and of putting herself forward unduly when she sought to speak to Jesus at Capharnaum (Matthew 12:46; Chrysostom, Hom. xliv; cf. also "In Matt.", hom. 4).  But these stray private opinions merely serve to show that theology is a progressive science. If we were to attempt to set forth the full doctrine of the Fathers on the sanctity of the Blessed Virgin, which includes particularly the implicit belief in the immaculateness of her conception, we should be forced to transcribe a multitude of passages. In the testimony of the Fathers two points are insisted upon: her absolute purity and her position as the second Eve (cf. 1 Corinthians 15:22).|`|UI79JnJVaa	"She NEVER so much as told one Lie."|`|gPSsVyVKaa	She was chosen from the beginning.

c3ec7b199ea9ca14cd6231d72c2bbffbaa	Bh...il volontariato fa comunque "curriculum"...poi, secondo me il concetto di volontariato esprime qualcosa di piu' della semplice attivit volontaria: qualcosa che si fa senza secondi fini, per gli altri;almeno...il fine principale dovrebbe essere aiutare gli altri...e di riflesso ricevere in cambio una gratificazione di tipo morale, una riconoscenza di tipo informale da perte delle altre persone(nel senso che:se ad esempio dici a qualcuno che fai volontariato tu sai che lui penser di te che sei altruista, sensibile...insomma un bravo ragazzo).|`|FlY5J66Vaa	secondo me in parte si e in parte no,  lo stato, magari non dovrebbe dare "regali" al singolo volontario, ma dovrebbe aiutare le associazioni sempre, perch in molte realt se non ci fosssero le associazioni di volontariato come le Misericordie, la gente sarebbe lasciata spesso in balia di se stessi, soprattutto se il portafoglio non  bello gonfio.  E poi vorrei che tutti questi politicanti smettessero di usare il buon nome dei volonatri, solo in campagna elettorale, o nelle cerimonie pubbliche, e sparino a zero quando succede qualcosa anche di piccolo    vi faccio un esempio:  in un paesino vicino a dove abito io,  successo che per una festa un albanese si  sentito male, avvertiti i soccorsi, sono arrivati dopo 40 minuti la chiamata al 118 perch tutti i mezzi sono fuori (chi fa volontariato sa che possono capitare serate del genere) ed il mezzo pi vicino libero era appunto a 40 minuti dall'incidente.  Ebbene arrivati sul posto l'albanese (che era semplicemente briaco) viene trasportato al Pronto Soccorso.  il giorno dopo  sui giornali locali, le "autorit" del comune lanciavano gridi contro l'associazione di cui facevano parte i volontari accorsi sull'incidente, per il lento intervento e per il servizio non professionale mostrato.    vorrei semplicemente dire a tutti i politici che ragionano solo per il loro tornaconto, soprattutto quando lo fanno giocando con servizi vitali per la popolazione, che si devono semplicemente vergognare !!    ragazzi, se aveter tempo libero, mi racomando andate a fare un po di volonatriato, fare volontariato  bello, si sta insieme, si conoscono i propri limiti, si imparano molte cose e soprattutto si aiuta il prossimo|`|ySef34ahaa	secono me no proprio perch nel volontariato si esprme il concetto di gratuit, non solo economica;  fare volontariato deve (o dovrebbe) essere fine a se stesso e basta non ad acquisire agevolazioni di qualsiasi tipo.  proprio per questa natura di gratuit al volontariato non dovrebbe essere affidato nessun compito che richieda una prestazione professionale (ai volontari della cri o della protezione civile sono sempre, giustamente affiancati professionisti pagati) ne dovrebbe essere l'attivit che uno fa per vivere. il volontariato  un modo per donare, liberamente, un po del proprio tempo libero agli altri e tratrre sddisfazione solo ed unicamente da questo e dal rappodrto con gli altri (che  un guadagno enorme)
dC1oGrVlaa	Quando il toro ha sul dorso le banderillas e comincia a dare segni di cedimento (i bovini, a differenza dei cavalli, hanno uno scatto fulmineo ma una resistenza molto limitata, e accumulano acido lattico con molta facilit), ha inizio la fase saliente e pi famosa della lidia.   Il torero depone l'ampio e pesante capote e lo sostituisce con la muleta, un drappo pi piccolo di flanella scarlatta, avvolto intorno a una gruccia lignea che lo mantiene disteso, in modo da poterlo impugnare con una sola mano. Nell'altra, nascosta dietro la schiena, impugna gi la spada di cui si servir per il colpo mortale.    Le cariche del toro, sempre pi stanco, si fanno sempre pi brevi e meno decise; egli tiene la testa abbassata, perch i puyazos gli hanno danneggiato i muscoli del collo. Questo il torero lo sa bene, e sa anche che non avrebbe speranze contro un toro in grado di muovere la testa correttamente. Il compito del picador  infatti proprio questo: mettere il toro in condizioni di inferiorit, costringendolo a tenere la testa abbassata perch il torero possa conficcargli la spada tra le scapole, raggiungendone il cuore.    La Ley taurina prevede che il torero uccida il toro entro il decimo minuto del tercio de muleta: se cos non avviene, ovvero se il torero ha vibrato il colpo a vuoto, o raggiungendo il toro in un punto non vitale, dall'alto degli spalti viene suonato uno squillo di tromba per avvertire l'uomo che deve affrettarsi.    Se entro il tredicesimo minuto il toro  ancora vivo, viene suonato un secondo avviso: il torero, a questo punto, usa di solito un estoque de descabellar, una spada pi piccola con una sbarretta trasversale in prossimit della punta, per dare al toro, spesso gi ferito a morte, il colpo di grazia. Ovviamente un'uccisione di questo tipo  molto meno "gradita" agli spettatori, di quando non accada quando il torero stende lo sfortunato quadrupede al primo colpo.    Se il torero non dovesse ucciderlo nemmeno questa volta, allo scadere del quindicesimo minuto suona il terzo avviso: il torero ha fallito e il toro, moribondo ma vivo, verr finito con un pugnale da uno dei peones. Il matador verr fischiato.|`|1e5cf9e227fcd900cf7f8fff5812919daa	oh, certo, spettacolare come no...un toro, che spesso viene stordito per essere meno aggressivo, un pagliaccio che fa tanto il figo con il suo spadino prima fa innervosire il toro e poi comicia a trafiggerlo con cose che a me sembrano simili a lance e poi se  in difficolt arrivano altri pagliacci di rango inferiore al suo a dare una mano...pi che una dimostrazione di coraggio mi sembra una gran vigliaccata. Hai coraggio? Bene allora scala le montagne a mani nude, lanciati col paracadute sugli scogli, fai una roulette russa...ma non mettere in mezzo animali innocenti.

God bless you.|`|TfeKGUYwaa	I will and have been.God Bless America,We need you to help us through all our trials Amen.                          ?

6wb8ERi5aa	You can pray for whatever you want.  It doesn't mean you get it.  When we pray we are communicating with a God. We do this for such things as worshiping, requesting guidance, requesting assistance, confessing sins, as an act of reparation or to express ones thoughts and emotions.  Communicating with God is a good thing.  Do it as often as you want.    Just My Thoughts!|`|AA11827424	You can pray for anything, but you will only get what is right for you.|`|S0c2MR5Gaa	no|`|8UP6iQ5Zaa	Well, there is no sense in praying for something that you have already been told to do or not to do. As to all else, I take everything to God in Christ Jesus, the big and the little stuff. But there is certainly a big difference between trying to get things from God and seeking to know Him better, which is the primary purpose in prayer.    :6 Be careful for nothing; but in every thing by prayer and supplication with thanksgiving let your requests be made known unto God.    Phl 4:7 And the peace of God, which passeth all understanding, shall keep your hearts and minds through Christ Jesus.   |`|keB9neboaa	Yes, you can pray for anything, from a new pair of shoes to World Peace and the death of all the people you hate.  It won't work, mind you.|`|omCODI5Raa	Jesus said if you abide in His words, and His word abides in you, then the Father will answer your prayers.  You can pray for anything, and sometimes God uses your request as an opportunity to teach you a different perspective.    Love is the main thing, therefore, pray for love.      P.S.  Don't be ashamed, and go hiding from God in the garden.  What a drama that has become!|`|Sb02ooOJaa	We are supposed to pray for anything that is within His will. To learn what is His will we need to read the Scriptures of who He is and What He has done. And meditate upon what He says He will do for our future. We must come to an understanding of who we are to Him and what our purpose for us is. Anything that is not of His will, is not what we pray for. Definitely anything unrighteous we cannot pray for. Jesus gave us a model prayer in Matthew 6:9-15. Now He did not give this as to repeat it as He did, but for us to base our prayers by using it as a guide.|`|4hreuGpPaa	If you don't pray God knows whats in you heart already Cos he is the one who created in the first place, but we need him all the time day and night because we are not secure from devils.  we Have to ask For his merci and salvation from hell which he has prepared for the disbelievers.   You dont ask God money or a car like ignorant one asks.  You can ask "O God Give us Good life in this life and also in the hearafter and save us from hell fire"|`|F6p22bmsaa	http://uk.youtube.com/watch?v=z7m59WBKr8... |`|AA11849917	Jesus said "Ask anything in my name (i.e. anything that is in His will), and you shall have whatever you ask."  Also, in another place, it says basically the same thing, that "If we ask according to His will, we know He hears, and if we know He hears, we know we will receive whatever we ask for."  But Jesus also said, "Seek ye first the Kingdom of God, AND  HIS  RIGHTEOUSNESS, and all these other things shall be added unto you."|`|15017428de404442efe6fff34a4dd6edaa	Oh Lord won't ya buy me a Mercedes-Benz!|`|4068ddb702bdc41558e963e223abc40eaa	You can pray for anything... but the prayer that really works goes like this... let thy will be done.    That may not sound like a prayer, but that type of "letting go" will bring power to the subtle desires you have and will deliver them to you. Click on my avatar for more on this original gospel of "let thy will be done," and "lose your life to find it."|`|H8WqMK1eaa	Be careful what you wish for...|`|0115b8162e3b4d1bdce5ffb45890b1d8aa	There is a saying, "be careful for what you pray lest it be granted"    The correct form of prayer is to end always with something similar to, "  not my will but yours,"  which put Christ's sacrifice exactly as it should be. He was like we would be, afraid.   We must pray only for God's will and mercy so it is OK to pray for anything or anything and to be able to do anything in God's service and the stringh and will to do just that. The problems come with the "new bike for Christmas" etc. |`|89dbd497fcd8c6cdb3d35fd8f19c44e1aa	You can't pray to become God, nor he can kick you out of his creation. You will always be in His knowledge.    "I am prayed to have beautiful girls, and I am still waiting for my prayer to be answered!"|`|XKecXwZkaa	You can pray for anything. There's nobody listening.|`|d503428496b7275f70c66859957bdd07aa	You can but you better be sincere about it. If you will get it that will be a different matter.|`|GDexucXKaa	Go ahead and pray for anything your little heart desires. |`|yIdgG8b1aa	I'm an atheist answering this so may get it wrong. But i think Your everyday prayers are meant to be thankful for what you have, I.E food and health. And if you need help with something you can ask for it from god but i don't think it's meant to be selfish... You can't pray to win the lotto but you can pray for a way out in time of money trouble ETC. Is that right to people who actually no about it? I just took a shot in the dark lol|`|XJ9oSR2daa	You can pray, but if it doesn't line up with God's will for your life, it ain't happening.|`|3ZzlrChgaa	You can talk to God about anything. Sometimes the answer is no, especially if the request puts us in a position of less reliance on God.|`|e04eb452209dd3002d2d0fa18bdf5cd5aa	u can pray even for money...God is the provider of everything just try not to pray for someones misfortune because u will be accountable for that in the day of judgment|`|c8828614b563cd3de41253b6a9e40991aa	Well, if you pray for things that go directly against the Word of God--you can pray all you want, but you're wasting your time. God will not deny Himself.    Be careful what you pray for; you may get it.|`|DZu43v76aa	U can't pray 2 b God.|`|6XLEnvAWaa	I pray for you to learn proper sentence structure.|`|qwetlHs2aa	You sure can.|`|m9iWkS2Faa	yes but its still wont help|`|qRGD0Hwiaa	"Can I pray for infinite wishes?"

KT7cllsLaa	Yes, its like a cat  |`|AA12360689	All personal names should be capitalized, but not necessarily TITLES.|`|AA11827424	The word is capitalised only by the followers of the particular deity. Non-Christians don't capitalise, unless it's out of long habit.|`|kWz0nEdBaa	Because Christians believe in One Supreme Being, King of kings and Lord of lords.  He created heaven and earth and everything in them.  He sustains all creation and powerful and mighty above all those who are called"gods".  He is coming one day to judge the living and the dead and will destroy who love darkness rather than light.|`|G6Wtwg3Uaa	You seriously need to think about the context where you got these ideas from: an english speaking, Christian context is obviously biased to those things.    This is only because you are living in a Christian society. If you lived in some certain societies, they would refer to the Christian "God" as "some other false god" and their own god would be spoken of with reverence.    Actually, the name of the Judeochristian god is Yahweh, but I bet you didn't know this because you are most likely ignorant of the history of the religion you claim to follow. This is something of a prejudice in the English language where Christianity made the name of their deity the same as the English word for a god (God is god).  The word "god" comes from the Proto-germanic translation of the Greek word "deus" which comes from the base "dyeu-" which means "to gleam", "to shine".     So now because of your upbringing in a Christian society speaking English, you think only your god gets to be capitalized and that his "name" is God. Hilarious.|`|LFQA94Msaa	They are always capitalized when writing about a specific deity (treated like a common name).  The word "god" is lowercase when talking about a type of being.  |`|KGJGqFalaa	Because he is the Creator.  God is a title.  When referring to the Creator (God) the G is in capital letters to distinguish him from those called gods in heaven and on earth. Those called gods were created by the Creator (e.g., angels, human judges) or by his creation ( e.g., Zeus, Dagon, etc)    God and those called gods all have personal names.  All personal names must be in capital letters.    http://www.counterfeitchristians.info/|`|jKyoKfnoaa	I don't capitalize "god" when I'm referring to the christian version of god or any other one because it is a title not a name.  If I am referring to a specific god, such as Odin, I capitalize the name.|`|WQvqLnnhaa	He is the God of creation. He deserve total reverence. His name should be use carefully. Not used casually, or with contempt.

101bfea0cfc2e9bab98441d37836406eaa	I don't think you really did anything wrong, per se.  Sure, you probably should have been up front with her about how you feel about being touched, the first time she ever touched you, but there's nothing you can do about that now.    You could try talking to her again, and saying you should have said something sooner, but didn't know how to say it, and so it just came out when you were drunk. But I would also point out that, while the incident may have embarrassed her, it was also embarrassing to you to be touched like that. You two should call it even and move on.    If she does not want to understand that, then let it go.  It's not something worth beating yourself up over.  Any friends who are going to judge you over her sayso, are probably not worth much effort on your part anyway.|`|CHCPnvksaa	You could myspace her or facebook her and just let her know that it's been bothering you for years and would like to apologize. But personally, I'd just let it go. You're not friends with her and aren't wanting a relationship with her, so if she's so childish that she would complain about you not liking the fact that she's grabby, then she's really not worth the time. You apologized once already, and if she didn't take it as being sincere then that's her problem.|`|oEYrC1Wsaa	Leave it where it belongs in the past!   Why drag up ancient history?  You are going to bring the past back to life & there is no need.   Stop with the guilt stuff, you are a human being & have learned a lesson.       Ignore taunts if any that may come your way occasionally.   The more you react the more girls are likely to keep bitching.    You apologized to her now forgive yourself & move on.     The past is the past, the future is tomorrow today is the present so treat it as a gift.   Take care|`|AA10771601	forget about it if you aren't friends with her still and move on don't do it again.  If you do still hang with her privately apologize to her and leave it at that.|`|p8YC9n2Raa	If it was me, i would of probably walked away or i would of said  something like "i need to go to the bathroom".|`|R2iCzRjsaa	FORGET IT!!  It was years ago, and you apologized.  Finished.  Who really cares about "reputation", this isn't Victorian England.  I think she'd be embarrassed to bring up this subject, especially after so long.  She'd sound like a slut trying to seduce you!      How old are you???|`|C4BJ3yLWaa	It seems to bother you more than anybody else.  It happened and it is over.  Let it go.  Just be cordial to her when you see her.|`|0Di3c7m0aa	I just wouldn't bring it up.  Honestly man, dwelling on something like that for so long is kinda crazy, and she would think the same thing.  Just let it go.|`|CCqqTw6paa	talk to her resolve your differences|`|e0e3e97ecc5ec23822071f8a88c516b3aa	I am kind of the same way, I don't like being touched when I don't give reason for it.. And there are girls out there who think that's ok, when really it's not.. I know you could of handled the situation better, but whats done is done.. Maybe she should of taken the time and actually understand what it was that bothered you in the first place, and maybe say sorry to you for making you feel uncomfortable.. In any case, it's not that big a deal, get over it. At least now, you can feel free without the unnecessary touching.|`|qSFtNZ1jaa	I think you should look at 'why' she was upset with you for saying that aloud. I think she was more mad at the fact you didn't want you to touch her, and maybe the embarassment was part of it. But I would look at it in the big picture. Seems like she liked you, or something.  I agree with everyone else with forgetting what was in the past. Its better that you let go too. She shouldn't bring up something thats old like that seems like shes trying to gain some power over you and make you feel horrible all over again. Don't go down that road and if she tries to pull that on you just tell her it was along time ago and to forget it. :/   Oh yeah, and shouldn't she feel gulity too? You were drinking and she was still playing grabby hands?|`|o65klEwWaa	Yeah she thinks you are gay for rejecting her and has told all her friends.

6e1884100ea01ca5c165183590f92363aa	It's probably more accurate to say "I'm going to Mass" if you are a Catholic. If you told me "I'm going to church" I would then ask "which church?"    For the Catholic, "church" with a little C refers to the building where God is worshipped. "Church" with a capital C refers to the universal Church on Earth - the Catholic Church.    Peace be to you all+|`|oojO4WAraa	I am going to mass is fine if you are catholic.  I am going to church is okay for everyone, unless you are Jewish, then you go to Temple.

I've had the same feeling when I first became Catholic about ten yrs. ago.  The word mass is more specific, but you are still going to church aren't you.  I find that at times when I do not feel like it being a subject for controversy among protestants if the subject comes up I will say the substandard church word.  Either way it is correct.|`|XKecXwZkaa	Mass is a particular celebration that takes place within the church. You could go to church when there isn't a mass going on.|`|3WYcPsm4aa	Catholic - Mass  Lutheran - Mass or Divine Service, or the generic "church"  Other protestant - church    Yes, Lutherans still recognize the term Mass, in regards to a worship service with Holy Communion.|`|AA11827424	Church is a place. Mass is a service. You can also go to Matins, Vespers, Compline, or any other kind of service.    Now, there are sects who wouldn't say the M word to save their lives. Their trip. Both expressions are correct anyway.|`|fxj6aaFUaa	Catholics have mass.

AA12006309	Let them know that you have something you want to discuss, that you haven't spoken to anyone else about, out of fear.  She's required to keep your discussions confidential, and you're probably not the first person who has come to her with the same conversation.    It's good that she's someone you feel comfortable with.  Counselors can do very little to help you if you're not open and honest with them.  If you're concerned about your parents finding out, let her know that is one of your fears.    Sometimes the best thing is to just have someone you trust that you can discuss these kinds of things with, not even to give you advice per se, but just to listen.  Good luck with your meeting with her.|`|oKvyaIPSaa	You should not be afraid. Your counselor at school is bound by ethics which makes what you say to her to be a private matter.|`|HAHDipTAaa	Quite likely your counselor has been presented with many similar situations and will be very understanding, just go ahead and make the appointment - the rest will follow naturally|`|yXg1ojQoaa	you know i'd really like to speak to a counsellor too, but i've never spoken to one before, and i'd love to know how to bring up the issue of my sexuality- try just saying, so can we talk about my sexuality?  *gives you a star* :)|`|l8c2kTlvaa	you shouldn't be worried about talking with her, she will help you, not judge you.|`|ypVrHE1iaa	IDK this is a good question!

Once you walk in the door you will know what to say.  Just don't say, "I think I'm gay."  Start with something like, the last few (weeks, years...) i have felt attracted to the (same sex, both sexes...), and I was wondering if I could talk about it with you.  You will do fine!  Good luck!|`|EIrdLq6Zaa	Okay here's where you start. First of all because you're a guy I strongly suggest that you ask to speak to a male counselor. i have been in therapy with both and must tell you that when you speak with a guy would will be much more open to use everyday "guy terms" You can freely say the "f" word or JO instead of the politically correct words when you're speaking with a woman. You will be much more comfortable. Being gay, talking to a woman about gay sex, masturbating etc... was awkward for me.You can very easily say, "First of all, I'm gay." and take it from there. These are trained professionals and will be able to hear you out. Remember, this is not the first time they've heard this subject.     But again, using everyday "guy words" will make it so much easier than having to think about every word before you say it. Hope that helps.

I work with a guy who thinks its funny to get under my skin (in a vindictive way--he kept trying to ask me out and i kept trying to blow him off nicely and finally lost it in front of some other coworkers and told him to leave me alone, not the most professional, I know).  I have borderline OCD and like things to be all even numbers, or all odd numbers or even little things that no one else would notice like color coding the push pins on our bulletin board.  Well every time I organize something etc he goes through and un-organizes it.  We have sheets that get passed on that need to be cut and he purposely cuts inside and outside the lines (zig zaggy) just because he knows it literally drives me nuts.  I can't handle it like that so I have to go back through everything he does that passes through me and straighten it or re-cut it etc.  so, the only way I can begin to handle it is to write it all down and then email the list to my best friend.  I know she doesn't read the emails anymore, but it makes me feel better just to write it all down and send it.  Every single little minute thing he does that bothers me, goes in the email.

UhyvM73iaa	1. Surah 2.Al Baara    62. Those who believe (in the Qur'an), and those who follow the Jewish (scriptures), and the Christians and the Sabians,- any who believe in Allah and the Last Day, and work righteousness, shall have their reward with their Lord; on them shall be no fear, nor shall they grieve.     Key word in this Ayah is .....and who believe in Allah and the last day (of judgment), and work righteous deeds.    Most Jews at the time of Rasoolallah SAW did believe and many still believe in one Allah, last day of judgment and do righteous deeds. Certainly Allah will reward them Jannah. What ever Allah promise, He never go against His promise.        Today most Christians do not believe in Allah - the one and only God, as Muslims believe.  But when Quran was revealed to Prophet Mohammad 1430 years ago.  I am sure at that time and age, there were groups of Christians in Middle East who really believed in one and only Allah.  Warqa bin Nofel the cousin of Khadija RA wife of Prophet  did believe in one and only Allah and had become Christian also.  He knew the true early Bible had prophsee Jesus Christ written in it about the arrival Mohamamd the last Messenger of God about this time and age. Waraqe listened the experience of Mohammad SAW with Angel Jibreel in the cave of Hira and recognized him as the prophesized last Messenger of Allah.  Waraqah was very old and blind.  He said, I wish I remain alive and help Mohammad when his people will force him to leave Mecca'. But he did die soon.    The point of this story is that there were Christians at the time Quran was revealed 1430 yrs ago  who believed in one Allah, the last day of Judgment and did the reighteous deeds.  Certainly they deserved to be in Jannah and Allah must have rewarded them Jannah.  Today if there are Christians who hold same belief in Allah, the last day of Judgment and are righeous people, Allah will reward Jannah to them also. And Allah must have and will reward to such Sabians also.  Allah will certainly reward them also.   believe in Middle East are that believed in one Allah and believed Jesus Christ as Prophet of Allah and not god. They were also the righteous people. They did deserve to be in Jannah. Remember the history.  When Muslim forces arrived on the gates of the fort of Jerusalem, the Christian Patriarch already have in his books books that when righteous Muslim leader comes, hand over the keys of Jerusalem to that man.  They had criteria written in their instruction when you see the the signs of righteousness in Muslim Ammer of Muslims then only you give them the keys of Jerusalem and not to any one else.     Soon after Omar bin Khattab was elected as Ameerul Momineen, he sent army to Jerusalem with message of Islam to the Christian Patriarch in Jerusalem. When the commander of army knocked the gates of city, Patriarch realized he is not the man according to what is written in our books.  So he said we will give keys of this city to a Muslim leader, but you are not that man.  The commander sent this  message to Ameerul Momineen Omar bin Khattab. Omar t started his journey from Madina towards Jerusalem on a camel in company of a slave.  Upto certain distance Omar sat on the camel and the slave walked holding the strings of camel.  They stopped did rest and then Slave sat on camel and Omar walked. Omar maintained this just rule in entire travel.  When they reached near the fort of Jerusalem, Christian Patriarch was watching and waiting from the top wall of the fort.  When he saw omar walking and African Slave sitting on camel, he immediately recognized  that it is Muslim Leader  whom we are supposed to hand over the keys of Jerusalem.  He let Omar come in the Fort.  After their formal conversation and handing over the keys of city, Ameerul Momineen Omar said I want to pray to Allah.    Patriarch said you can pray right here in the Church.  Omar said, I rather pray outside in open land.  Patriarch asked why you want to prray out in dirt.  Omar said if I pray in your Church, in future when Muslims will find that I prayed in this Church, they may convert your church into Masjid.  Omar did his prayer out of Church in an open land. Sure enough Muslims later built a Mosque right where Omar had performed his salat.  Still Omar Mosque stands there.     Most probably lots of Jews, Christians and Sabians did believe in one God and some still do today. But jews didn't accept Mohammad as Messenger of God because he was Arab and not a Jew.  Allah has written this reason of Jews for  rejecting Mohammad SAW in Quran in that Jews recorgnize you (O Mohammad ) like they recognize their own sons, but don not accept you as Messenger of Allah because you are not one of their Jews".    Rest of the Ayahs are self explanatory and do not need my clarification.  My reply is too long, so I close it.    Ma Salama, AM|`|287ae5682476df003fc4d95ff463997aaa	The verse from Surat Baqara is telling us that people, regardless of religion will be rewarded for their good deeds.  It does not however mean that all of them will be going to paradise.  As those who do not believe will be given the reward of their good deeds either in this world or it will raise them through levels in hell so that their punishment is lessened.  Only the true believer in Islamic Monotheism will attain the love and mercy of Allah and be allowed to enter Jannah.    The Verses in Surah Imran are pertaining to People of the book who were doing good deeds and had faith before Allah send his final Prophet... and then they followed Muhammad thereafter and accepted Islam.  Abdullah ibn Salam was one such man.  Allah knows best!|`|SCkhQc2Caa	Who are the Jews and Christians who will enter Paradise? : http://islam-qa.com/en/ref/2912  _____________________________________    Who are Ahlul Kitab( The people of the book) : http://islam-qa.com/en/ref/300  _____________________________________|`|7qe7EUahaa	I am happy to see your question. In the effort of sharing my opinion, on Surah 2 Al-Baqara, I am nothing more than a student of the Quran, and, if it APPEARS that I am a trouble maker;  Forgive me, I am not.   Sometimes when a person holds a challenging point of view; it is not to DISPROVE something, but to VERIFY what they find the truth to be.  I think this Surah means (just what it says-nothing added, nothing taken away) that 'SOME JEWS, CHRISTIANS AND SABIANS" (those that believe and do righteous work) will have their reward with the Lord.  (NOW, adding to what I read, I think this means some will go to Paradise and not to hell, (along with Muslims) based on what they do believe and how they live).  I will expect most Muslim's will say "No, that's not what it means".   Every Muslim will say the Quran is written in simple form, so that everyone can understand it without confusion. It is clear and specific.  It is said that there is no fancy symbolism  involved in the Quran, nor is there a need to interpret the Quran.(As it is so clear and specific)  So then, on this verse, which my husband and I discuss much, I say, read the simplicity of the words, there is no symbolism, nothing to interpret:   Surah 2. Al-Baqara   62. Those who believe (in the Qur'an), and those who follow the Jewish (scriptures), and the Christians and the Sabians,- any who believe in Allah and the Last Day, and work righteousness, shall have their reward with their Lord; on them shall be no fear, nor shall they grieve.   MEANS EXACTLY THAT.  My husband says it doesnt mean that BUT if it does, it means but only those Jews, Christians and Sabians that lived  BEFORE Mohammed.   IF THE QURAN IS SO SIMPLE AND SO VERY CLEAR TO UNDERSTAND, NO NEED TO INTERPETE....THEN, it would have said.. "THOSE BEFORE MOHAMMED"   I love your question and I think it is clearly stated. I won't comment on the other Surah, but I feel the same point is made in each of them.  Thank you for allowing me the opportunity to voice my opinion, which is: Some of Jews, Christians and Sabians will fall under the mercy of Allah and receive the just reward of their doings. Allah knows best.|`|ORbFRn4oaa	Amina,    The verses are self explanatory. HOWEVER, I notice that you are using a translation that is using "INJECTION" to mislead, or conclude a specific meaning i.e. braces etc.    The 2:62 and 5:69, lay down the MINIMUM criteria for redemption. The verses simply mean, that no matter what the faith is, as long as the person does the righteous deeds WHILE believing in God and the last day, he/she has nothing to fear nor to worry. This is true FOR ANY FAITH i.e. Muslims, Christians, Jews, Sabiens etc. etc.    You have taken out the context of the verses. However the context + verses do tell that ALTHOUGH most of the followers of previous scriptures i.e. Jewish and Christians may be evil in their deeds, "BUT !!!!!" some of them are upright and uphold the truth and the righteous path. They advocate righteousness and try to prevent evil. They put in all the efforts for the righteous deeds. They (among the followers of previous scriptures i.e. Jews and Christians) are GOOD people and believers in the eyes of God. And God appreciates them. They are believers.    -----------    When one focuses on the verses 2:62 and 5:69, one should remember that many athiests and pagans and agnostics may be righteous, BUT !!!!, since their righteousness is "NOT" for the fear of God and the last day, therefore they do NOT deserve any compensation either. If they are truly righteous God may grant them a neutral place (a personal inference, for which I have little Quranic indications), out of his mercy. However, the people who are REALLY successful are those who:    1-  Are righteous because  2-  They believe in God and the last day and hence accountable to God.|`|88fHI3xDaa	these all ayat is for Abul slam (rz) who was jew and became muslim and for salman farsi(rz) these ayat are conecting for nine jews who became muslim and these ayat for those people who died before the prophecy of Muhammad(saw) so if u want to say these are for modern time u are rong because after the prophecy of Muhammad (saw) there is no way for jannah except Islam

Here are some of the better known names of God in the Bible:    EL, ELOAH: God "mighty, strong, prominent" (Genesis 7:1; Isaiah 9:6)  Etymologically, El appears to mean power, as in I have the power to harm you (Genesis 31:29). El is associated with other qualities, such as integrity (Numbers 23:19), jealousy (Deuteronomy 5:9), and compassion (Nehemiah 9:31), but the root idea of might remains.    ELOHIM: God Creator, Mighty and Strong (Genesis 17:7; Jeremiah 31:33)  The plural form of Eloah, which is accommodating of the doctrine of the Trinity. From the Bibles first sentence, the superlative nature of Gods power is evident as God (Elohim) speaks the world into existence (Genesis 1:1).    EL SHADDAI: God Almighty, The Mighty One of Jacob (Genesis 49:24; Psalm 132:2,5)  Speaks to Gods ultimate power over all.    ADONAI: Lord (Genesis 15:2; Judges 6:15)  Used in place of YHWH, which was thought by the Jews to be too sacred to be uttered by sinful men. In the Old Testament, YHWH is more often used in Gods dealings with His people, while Adonai is used more when He deals with the Gentiles.    YHWH / YAHWEH / JEHOVAH: LORD (Deuteronomy 6:4; Daniel 9:14)  Strictly speaking, the only proper name for God. Translated in English Bibles LORD (all capitals) to distinguish it from Adonai Lord. The revelation of the name is first given to Moses I Am who I Am (Exodus 3:14). This name specifies an immediacy, a presence. Yahweh is present, accessible, near to those who call on Him for deliverance (Psalm 107:13), forgiveness (Psalm 25:11) and guidance (Psalm 31:3).    YAHWEH-JIREH: "The Lord will Provide" (Genesis 22:14)  The name memorialized by Abraham when God provided the ram to be sacrificed in place of Isaac.    YAHWEH-RAPHA: "The Lord Who Heals" (Exodus 15:26)  I am Jehovah who heals you both in body and soul. In body, by preserving from diseases, and by curing them when afflicted with them and in soul, by pardoning their iniquities.    YAHWEH-NISSI: "The Lord Our Banner" (Exodus 17:15), where banner is understood to be a rallying place. This name commemorates the desert victory over the Amalekites in Exodus 17.    YAHWEH-M'KADDESH: "The Lord Who Sanctifies, Makes Holy" (Leviticus 20:8; Ezekiel 37:28)  God makes it clear that He alone, not the law, could cleanse His people and make them holy.    YAHWEH-SHALOM: "The Lord Our Peace" (Judges 6:24)  The name given by Gideon to the altar he built after the Angel of the Lord assured him he would not die as he thought he would after seeing Him.    YAHWEH-ELOHIM: "LORD God" (Genesis 2:4; Psalm 59:5)  Combination of Gods unique name YHWH and the generic Lord, signifying that He is the Lord of Lords.    YAHWEH-TSIDKENU: "The Lord Our Righteousness (Jeremiah 33:16)  As with YHWH-MKaddesh, it is God alone who provides righteousness to man, ultimately in the person of His Son, Jesus Christ, who became sin for us that we might become the Righteousness of God in Him (2 Corinthians 5:21).    YAHWEH-ROHI: "The Lord Our Shepherd" (Psalm 23:1)  After David pondered his relationship as a shepherd to his sheep, he realized that was exactly the relationship God had with him, and so he declares Yahweh-Rohi is my Shepherd. I shall not want (Psalm 23:1).    YAHWEH-SHAMMAH: "The Lord is There (Ezekiel 48:35)  The name ascribed to Jerusalem and the Temple there, indicating that the once departed glory of the Lord (Ezekiel 811) had returned (Ezekiel 44:1-4).    YAHWEH-SABAOTH: "The Lord of Hosts" (Isaiah 1:24; Psalm 46:7)  Hosts means hordes, both of angels and of men. He is Lord of the host of heaven, and of the inhabitants of the earth, of Jews and Gentiles, of rich and poor, master and slave. The name is expressive of the majesty, power, and authority of God and shows that he is able to accomplish what he determines to do.    EL ELYON: Most High" (Deuteronomy 26:19)  Derived from the Hebrew root for go up or ascend, so the implication is of that which is the very highest. El Elyon denotes exaltation and speaks of absolute right to lordship.    EL ROI: "God of Seeing" (Genesis 16:13)  The name ascribed to God by Hagar, alone and desperate in the wilderness after being driven out by Sarah (Genesis 16:1-14), when she met the Angel of the Lord and realized she had seen God Himself in a theophany. She realized that El Roi saw her in her distress and testified that He is a God who lives and sees all.    EL-OLAM: "Everlasting God" (Psalm 90:1-3)  Gods nature is without beginning or end, free from all constraints of time and contains within Himself the very cause of time itself. From everlasting to everlasting, You are God.    EL-GIBHOR: Mighty God (Isaiah 9:6)  The name describing the Messiah, Christ Jesus, in this prophetic portion of Isaiah. As a powerful and mighty warrior, the Messiah, the Mighty God, will accomplish the destruction of Gods enemies and rule with a rod of iron (Revelation 19:15).|`|9KEBtsNTaa	Allah, he seems the most vengeful|`|ZGPFdep0aa	by the way why do you need to pray?

X9rXRNUxaa	The number 666 comes directly from the worship practices of the city of Babylon about he time of the Bible prophet Daniel.  The people of Babylon worshiped gods that were associated with the sun, moon, visible planets of our solar system, and certain of the stars involved with the practice of astrology. The Babylonians were the principle developers of astrology, as we know it today.  In their worship system, they had 37 supreme gods, and one of these, the god associated with the sun, was supreme over all the other gods.  These people believed that numbers in some way had power over the gods they worshiped.  However, they had to create numbers that they could assign to the gods so that they could have power over them.  To do this, they counted their gods and assigned a count number to each of the 36 lesser supreme gods, and then added up all of these numbers (from one to 36) and assigned the sum to the sun god.  The first god they counted got the number one assigned to it, and the second god they counted got the number two assigned to it, and so on up to all 36 lesser supreme gods.  Now, if you have not guessed it by now, the sum of the numbers from one to 36 totals 666, which they assigned to the god associated with the sun.  They did the calculation like this:     1  +  2  +  3  +  4  +  5  +  6  +  7  +  8  +  9  +  10  +  11  +  12      +  13  +  14  +  15  +  16  +  17  +  18  +  19  +  20  +  21  +  22      +  23  +  24  +  25  +  26  +  27  +  28  +  29  +  30  +  31  +  32      +  33  +  34  +  35  +  36 = 666      However, they went further.  They feared these gods and worried that one of them might strike them down sometime, so they made  amulets  with a 6 x 6 matrix of the numbers one through 36 on them.  Today we call these numeric matrixes magic squares.  The design of the amulets was to achieve a magic purpose, and they evidently believed that wearing a particular god's number would protect one from a specific god striking them down using his power of magic.  Now, the amulets had to be as powerful as possible, so in order to increase its power, they arranged these numbers in such a way that the sum of any given row, column, or diagonal is 111, and therefore the sum of all six rows or all six columns was 666.  This was supposed to provide extra protection, including from the god associated with the sun, since this god's sum was present on the amulet.    Below is an example of one such arrangement of numbers in a 6x6 matrix of numbers.   Note that any given column, row, or diagonal adds up to 111.  The ancient Babylonians wrote these numbers out on a small clay tablet, and after drying and baking it to make the writing permanent, they would hang it on a support and wear it around their neck.  As long as they carried the amulet with them, they thought that the amulet provided protection.     6  32  3  34  35  1  7  11  27  28  8  30  19  14  16  15  23  24  18  20  22  21  17  13  25  29  10  9  26  12  36  5  33  4  2  31    For the complete article please go to:    http://www.666man.net/666ReligionHistory...    .|`|U7sBZKUuaa	The name of a person can also be a number because in ancient Hebrew and Greek, their letters stood for numbers, so it was possible to add up the letters of someone's name, or any other word, and get their "value". For instance, the name of Jesus Christ in Greek adds up to 888. The unspeakable name of God in Hebrew (YHWH) adds up to 26. Apparently the name of the Beast will add up to 666 in one of these ancient languages. Purportedly Nero's name did, and there is also supposed to be an inscription on the Pope's hat that does, but this does not automatically mark someone as the Beast. Knowing this value would only narrow the field, if we bothered to run everybody's name through it.|`|X548yCR6aa	It means emperor Nero. They had to resort to numerical allegories, because if Nero figured it out, the authors would be executed for treason.|`|PcNzgisHaa	Thats hot.|`|IGDfhp3naa	its a mark my not be 666 but something meaning like 666, a W in Hebrew language means 6, the internet has three W www, so who really knows if it will be actually 666 or a mark meaning that. only time will tell.|`|eYs8DpbBaa	666 in Jewish numerology equals Nero, however 666 is a mistranslation.|`|YHmr7nvsaa	It means absolutely nothing, it is a christian fairy tale.|`|pSNSlRlRaa	Well, many have ideas about this, being imperfect, etc.    However the Holy Spirit showed me that in the Bible at 2Samuel 21:20, the giant had 6 fingers and 6 toes.    These giants were Nephilim. These were children of one human and one materialized angel. Many were in Canaan. That is the land God was going to rip from those evil ones and give to Israel.    Like wise today, materialized demons, posing as humans have become leaders in many churches. They lie and mislead 'Christians.' Revelation11:13.    2 Corinthians 11:13 For such men are false apostles, deceitful workers, transforming themselves into apostles of Christ.    14) And no wonder for Satan himself keeps transforming himself into an angel of light.    15) It is therefore nothing great if his ministers also keep tranforming themselves into ministers of righteousness.    Jesus accused some of the Pharisees of killing Zechariah, who had lived approximately 500 years prior. Matthew 23:35    So, 666 means an organization of demon-men.    Mattthew 13:28 He (Jesus) said to them, 'An enemy, a MAN did this.' 39) and the enemy that sowed them is the Devil.'|`|06aceb1d90d3755e9049c8a9a59210ddaa	I honestly wouldn't believe a word of Revelation.  It's complete nonsense written by a madman.      Not that I'd believe anything in the Bible without an outside source anyway but this is the bit that just takes the cake.|`|3jAdp1lJaa	The history of 666 is a mysterious one, It is the Mark of the beast foretold by the book of Revelations, which is already coming true. It is a mark that will save the world from global recession, by leaving a mark or microchip on your forehead and hands, so all men big and small can't trade for goods unless they have the microchip mark, and if it malfunctions you still have to call India for customer service support, which I heard the wait times are gonna be hell. Also pray it isn't designed by Mac, then we all will be trouble...Long Live IBM.........|`|cc1eedd4ec08792a3946f30dd974c11faa	the beast that is refered to is satan cos his number is 666 which is also the number of general evil|`|f2xhXmxmaa	It's one more than 665 and one less than 667. Nothing else.|`|T2zD3FS6aa	Wow, nobody's said it's a Pope or all Popes yet. Rabid anti-Catholics must sleep in.     Most likely it refers to a Roman Emperor. Probably Nero or Domitian, and the code was likely well known to the Christians of that time period.|`|Fo9ADQLBaa	Que serra serra, whatever will be, will be...  Only God knows, and when.  I do not perceive this as anything to worry about.    My focus will remain on God.  :D|`|qcEzJDY6aa	The gold is what the people now idolizes. It stands for money, it's the mark of the beast on their minds and on their hands it was given to all people to understand, the verse is a parable, speaking spiritually to everyone that they would be worshiping idols unnoticed on their hands and mind. You've got the right verses to compare that's the answer. That man representing Solomon with understanding has that number of the gold, His wealth, that stands for the money that most people idolizes.  "Money is the root of all evil." "You cannot serve God and money".  "Matthew 19:24 And again I say unto you, It is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle, than for a rich man to enter into the kingdom of God."   Most people actually depends on money not with God.|`|wnI04x8Kaa	correct me if im wrong but in those days didn't they use roman numerals|`|AA12346187	I believe it stood  fro a roman  symbol  in VI VIVI    but know I do not really understand its meaning.
59J4q4Uzaa	I live in Salt Lake City where there are many Mormons, ex-Mormons, Mormons-to-be, and people that have never been Mormon........ dude, they all treat each other awesome as long as nobody starts disrespecting each other.|`|ZtEVlc0yaa	I've got quite a few family members who are no longer Mormon.   And I've never treated any of them differently than I did when they were members.     I'm not saying that it never happens.  Just not with me. :]|`|TzY9vkinaa	All my ex-Mormon family is treated quite well by the rest of us, and by everyone in the great state of Utah :) They're quite happy here with all the Mormons.|`|2wUvFmrhaa	The mormon church likes to give a description of the kind of person who would be so terrible that he would leave the church.    Here some of the reasons why someone could POSSIBLY ever LEAVE the one true church on Earth.      1. Ex's are lazy and cant choose not to live up to the expectations of a good, clean LDS life.       2.They have some kind of secret sin they have been engaged in (or which they want to engage in as soon as they cut ties with the church.) Ive been called Gay here for being against prop 8.    3. They were offended by someone at church and just *couldnt* get over such an indubitably minor slight.     More like lied too(about a few doctrines) and offended by racist, hateful, statements made be mormon so called prophets.      4. They read some kind of sketchy anti-Mormon pamphlet and didnt want to hear the Real Deal from the scriptures or church leaders.  (I researched pro and con for a year!)   One more thing,  most "anti mormon" quotes and ideas, are found on mormon approved sites.    SO you SEE the LDS church always puts the blame on the member, or ex member. They state the "church" is perfect, so it must be you.      Blame is a *cult tatic*, I have found out.|`|DVDYDaVSaa	Because the former mormons often tell the truth behind the happy sunshiney story that the members present, and members don't like that.  It doesn't matter if what the exmormons say is documented history, it still bothers the members.|`|yTAXDL5Jaa	YEA I HAVE BEEN CALLING THE WARD IN MY ENIGHBORHOOD, TRYING TO GET ON THE "DON;T CONTACT ME LIST" AND NO ONE IS EVER THERE AND i AM TIRED OF BEING HARRASSED BY MORMON MISSIONARIES BECAUSE THEY KNWO I AM EX-MORMON.|`|SWYB8iQEaa	because they are not mormons anymore|`|gOKi1dcVaa	Muslims kill their apostates.|`|rfMLIqMpaa	Because the ex-morons (or is it mormons) know that the moronic faith is wrong.|`|kksq9BtOaa	Probs didn't hand in there magic underpants when they left.|`|7b66e5a036c936e526ce935966615cb4aa	I've noticed this too. and I've noticed that Mormons treat non mormons badly as well. I feel disrespected by the mormon people as many come across as rude and self-centered. Just my observation as I've lived in the Salt Lake City area.    In fact, at one point, a mom of my friend's would not let me into their house because I'm not mormon.|`|PeeIS28Oaa	Hah,, They accuse me of being sinful, evil, son of perdition, gay, unwilling or unable to live up to the standards of LDS.. Haha none of which is true. Well by lds standards I can be considered a Son of Perdition, since I have rejected the LDS religion, and all religion. But some consider gray cause I still believe there could be god(s) and an afterlife. Through personal near death experiences I can't deny that. But I am not stupid enough to believe something because I want to believe it, and I am not stupid enough to believe it because it is written in a book or some man...or woman says that is what I am suppose to believe. Because I use to tell people what they were suppose to believe. Because I believed it too. I was fooled and I fooled myself. Burning Bosom, Holy Ghost, Revelation... yep I had it all. Till I realized it was all self generated.    Now I only believe in the truth.
2wUvFmrhaa	Because when the thinking has been done, you answer the same way the leaders do. Most members, quote them word for word when they are asked a specific LDS question. I see that OVER and OVER on YA.    Never mind facts.    The LDS Church counts members until they are 110 years old!      Members who are excommunicated or have their membership removed are still counted among the membership of the Church. There are currently over 1 million members who have resigned yet are still counted as active.     *Inactive members and those who have moved on to other Churches are also still counted among the membership.       12 million members on the books, but only about half of them would be considered active. Only a small amount of them have attended the mormon temple for their "endowment."      Growth?  The LDS church grows is poor countries, think about where the internet is not everywhere.    The Mormon Church growth is down to 3% per year.  The internet is very damning to the religion.    Based on growth, Jehovah's Witnesses is more true church than Mormon Church.    NOTE: Hinckley lied about the numbers.|`|37LKDbtsaa	Meh, most of them are also in denial about what kind of man Joe Smith was.|`|dl97DmmYaa	To attract more members.|`|b7Lo5IAZaa	From the article:    Today, The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints has more than 12 million members on its rolls, more than doubling its numbers in the past quarter-century.      Oh, sorry, we're off by..... 30 when we say that. Do you know any other religion that has doubled in a quarter-century?|`|vGWD8Zncaa	Because they need to cover up all the polygamy  :-)|`|qTUaHHcDaa	Friends,  I found the info interesting and as a fully active member of the church of Jesus Christ of latter day saints,i agree as to the number  church record statistics ,but it is now  in the year 2009,not the  year 2005.  The actual number of membership includes children born to members as well , not just converts.  A  true convert is a state of change that has taken  place in a persons spiritual life ,which is shown by the way he lives,for me this has been dramatic ,and all of my thinking has altered for the good,  I try to live all the laws of the land as well as those made known to me via the study of all the Holy writ  at my disposal.  I believe in the brotherhood of man,and in the motherhood of woman.  I have found out for myself that Mormonism is Absolutely true and i testify  of  this, in the Sacred name of Jesus Christ. Amen.  God bless you all.|`|494f917287bcb72589c802dc7322ca19aa	What they meant to say was They wish they had 13 Friends|`|xMNMOJu2aa	Allegedly, even if a person chooses to "leave" the church, the Mormons still count them as a member..|`|kksq9BtOaa	Becouse there magic...thing .. arrr ......**** it its not that funny anyway|`|7b66e5a036c936e526ce935966615cb4aa	Because the mormon religion is about drawing people in before actually telling them the truth. Or at least that's what I think. Just another way to get more money|`|9KEBtsNTaa	Because "We have 13 million member on record, but half don't consider themselves mormons anymore" doesn't sound as flashy.  So much for the stone cut without hands covering the whole earth.

Yes, not all "black" people come from Africa. But that doesnt make them not "black" it just makes them not African. Arabs are caucasians like Europeans are, but theyre not White. Well the same principle applies here.    Also, socially Aboriginies and Melanesians more or less are regarded in developed nations (Australia etc) in largely the same way Black people are.|`|lKof1n0Xaa	No, my first impression of them was that they were of Polynesian descent.

It's obvious in their appearance and makes sense if you think about the location of their countries (before they broke apart).     This doesn't mean that having dark skin makes you black. Sri Lankans are often very dark but they are simply Indian (by origin).

b7Lo5IAZaa	You can go to LDS.org or mormon.org to find a basic idea of what we believe and the different doctrines that we teach. For an outline read the 13 Articles of Faith.     http://scriptures.lds.org/a_of_f/1/2 2    Mormons are viewed negatively mostly by those who don't have an accurate understanding of what we teach, or like the case in point of John here, who was once a member, as is now on some vendetta to destroy the church as if it rejected him for him choosing to walk away.....    I know. Usually when someone wants to quit something, they just let it go. It's a weird phenom that people get all obsessed with it.       John, well, keep laughing then because I thought someone could answer it if this person genuinly wants to know regarding our teachings. Notice that it was stared BEFORE you answered?|`|AA12275506	It's easy to hate something that one does not fully comprehend.    Mormons are looked at in a bad light on this site because there is so much hatred and animosity towards them, although they are some of this country's most outstanding citizens, they have been the brunt of many jokes and other snide remarks. R&S is supposed to be for the purpose of friendly exchanging of religious beliefs and ideas. Instead, it has turned into a platform to promote bigotry and intolerance toward specific religious groups. For shame!    I admit that I am not a Mormon, but I have the utmost respect for them. They are clean cut, very polite, and they have strong respect for family values. Those who badmouth them should shut up and take notice.|`|TzY9vkinaa	Christians don't like us because they think we believe in "another jesus" since we don't believe in the trinity, but in the godhead which is composed of 3 separate beings, God the Father, Jesus Christ, and the Holy Ghost.

These  people were told by God to migrate at 3 different times 1800bc  1000bc and -600bc.  The American indians are related to these people,  It plainly speaks of a visit of the Lord Jesus Christ  to  these people ,and doing similar things he did in the holy land after he was resurrected in Jerusalem.   Any person or persons are always condemed who declare the truth.   A free copy of this sacred book is available to you ,at your request,on any one of our church meeting houses or from the website L D S .ORG.  God bless.|`|2wUvFmrhaa	Here a good site I came across.     The Negative Effects of Mormonism  http://www.cc.utah.edu/~njb4/mormonnegat...    As a former member, I was not told much at all about real mormon doctrine, and real mormon history. I was a young adult, but this information would have been CRUCIAL.    Mormon youth and potential converts are kept in the dark, that's a fact. Mormon missionaries are taught to feed these groups the milk before meat. This means to come across as a normal Christian Church, and leave out the strange or controversial doctrines. (racist statements, sexist beliefs, real history, etc)    What Mormon Missionaries WON'T Tell You??    Here...  http://www.jesus-is-savior.com/False%20R...    I was not told a bit of that information. I had to find out Information on my own, because members are taught to sugarcoat, and intentionally leave *parts* out.

825d2f4e20d46fad3afe31f48cf87dbfaa	La chiesa cattolica come tutte le chiese, sette, comunit religiose tende a mantenere il proprio gregge nel proprio recinto.

Gli insegnanti sono pi preparati e non vai avanti se non hai il livello giusto di conoscenze...  ma...  spesso discrimina, anche a livello scolastico, chi non si adegua alle sue idee..  al liceo, dai salesiani, sono entrato in forte scontro con la direzione e di conseguenza con il corpo insegnanti, non per problemi di rendimento o di condotta, ma perch ero fuori dal coro. Avevo i capelli lunghi (neanche alle spalle), anche se seguivo gli obblighi religiosi (giusti per carit, dato il tipo di scuola) tipo la messa settimanale o la preghiera in classe, non ci mettevo sicuramente troppo entusiasmo!  Questo mi ha portato ad abbandonare dopo un anno e mezzo e ad andare a una scuola statale (dove ho vissuto di rendita fino alla fine data la differente preparazione!)  Culturalmente e successivamente, lavorativamente mi sono sentito quindi discriminato, perch non ho potuto usufruire di una preparazione migliore a causa dell'ottusit mentale di certe persone!

I risultati:  - L'asilo parrocchiale, per i genitori che lavorano, prende i bambini anche alle 7,30 e li riconsegna anche alle 18,30.  - Ha una marcia in pi perch insegna anche religione   (ci sono anche marocchini, cinesi, nigeriani, albanesi).  - Ha il numero di alunni pi che doppio della statale  - E' sempre all'avanguardia in quanto alle norme di Legge.  - Pratica prezzi leggermente inferiori alla statale  - I bambini che vanno alla primaria sono pi ben preparati di  quelli della statale (riconosciuto da tutte le maestre e dal  MIUR provinciale).|`|af5ac2fa6b3b5305fd2c579e2461224faa	Mio figlio frequenta una scuola cattolica.

La prima riguarda la validit della Chiesa confessionale cattolica come organo di formazione di cittadini anche laici, anzi, soprattutto laici.   E' un pregiudizio quello messo in atto contro le chiese cattoliche perch chi le conosce sa che da esse proviene una formazione di prim'ordine. Fatte salve ovviamente alcune eccezioni che, come sempre, ci sono ovunque.   Nelle scuole cristiane viene insegnata la religione, ma non invade mai il campo delle altre materie che vengono insegnate con competenza e con rigore.   Un alunno che proviene da una scuola cattolica  preparato meglio dei suoi colleghi delle scuole pubbliche e non tanto perch gli siano state fornite nozioni supplettive, ma perch  stato "educato" allo studio, al rispetto del sapere e dell'autorit.   Questo fa la grande differenza.   Nella mia ex scuola cattolica, ci sono bambini di tutte le religioni ora,  e nessuno si lamenta perch non solo non vengono indottrinati, ma ne vengono pi che rispettate le origini culturali e sociali.   Concludo dicendo che la Chiesa, che  tutta la comunit dei Cristiani,   parte della societ in cui vive ed ha in questa societ obblighi,incarichi, diritti, come quello di parola che dovrebbe poter esprimere in piena libert come la esprimono altri soggetti politici come i comunisti, i socialisti, i liberali, i radicali, eccetera.

LDqzP2LVaa	Words come from human need of communication and connection to others. Since every human wants to be understood by others, words have been created to serve this purpose. Before that, I'm sure other ways of communication have been used. Starting with gestures, then incomprehensible mumbles, then making up standardized sets of sounds that always mean the same thing (example: the sound of the word Sun will always mean the same). How did they come up with them... Imagine a human being millions of years ago. He tries to tell his friend that he is cold. Of course the word cold or the english language didn't exist then, so while making some gestures, he makes a sound like let's say: Haka. Then the next time he wants to say he's cold, he simply says Haka and his friend understands... But, in another region, the same thing happened but the sound they came up with sounded like: Doko instead of Haka... This leaded to the formation of different languages... And so on so forth...     The most efficient use of words is when they are meant to comfort someone, to express love, support, compassion. In fact, words aren't the most important component of communication. Silent communication is much deeper and efficient.

Quando algum estupra, mata, rouba, mente, descontrola-se, e depois diz: Eu estava fora de mim, quem estava no seu corpo naquele momento? O agente do mal, esprito maligno que a usou para realizar seus malvolos propsitos. O dem?nio n?o  mau por natureza. Quando algo na cria??o divina parecer errado, na verdade faz parte de um todo que est certo, porque DEUS n?o erra, n?o falha. Quem faz do dem?nio mau s?o os prevaricadores. DEUS criou o dem?nio com a fun??o de levar os homens ao vale da purifica??o fazendo-os cometer erros, porque na tenta??o se erra e no errar se sofre a conseqncia do pecado cometido. Neste processo est o mecanismo da evolu??o. Eis um exemplo: dentre todos os animais que integram a ecologia, DEUS criou a serpente. Ela  um ser pe?onhento e asqueroso, aparentemente malfico aos homens, todavia tem um lugar fundamental no contexto da biologia. Atualmente os cientistas recomendam que elas n?o sejam mortas porque o prprio veneno que produzem pode ser utilizado para benefcios aos homens. Da mesma forma, ao mesmo tempo em que o sol  perigosssimo, podendo at provocar um cancer de pele, a vida na Terra n?o existiria sem ele e todos necessitam de seus resplandecentes raios. No plano espiritual, todos os seres humanos tm o lado positivo e negativo, indispensveis para que possam viver,  semelhan?a da energia eltrica: se um dos dois plos falha, a eletricidade n?o se manifesta,  impossvel produzir luz. Quando o lado negativo sobrepuja o positivo, os espritos das trevas se aproximam do infeliz, induzem-no a caminhar contra a lei divina, fazendo-o sentir-se inferior, desgra?ado, infeliz, incapaz. Atualmente, a maior parte da humanidade tem o lado negativo dominando o positivo. H os que conseguem atingir o equilbrio, em que ambos os lados se equivalem. Neste caso, s vezes pode haver uma oscila??o para um lado ou outro, mas ainda assim se faz mister muita for?a de vontade e confian?a em DEUS a fim de manter a estabilidade. E por fim, quando o lado positivo consegue sobrepujar e dominar o negativo, caracteriza-se a vitria espiritual do ser humano, a comunh?o com o CRIADOR Supremo e rendimento incondicional  Sua santa vontade. A estes  dado comer da rvore da vida, que est no paraso de DEUS (Apocalipse c.2 v.7). Ent?o os espritos de luz se aproximam a fim de orient-lo e auxili-lo em sua jornada na Terra. Nisso est a chave do bem-estar fsico e espiritual, da felicidade, da alegria de viver, da simbiose com o ALTSSIMO. Deve-se, portanto, fazendo bom uso do livre-arbtrio, transformar seu prprio dem?nio em luz, iluminando o lado negativo a fim de que se unifique ao positivo, que j  luz. Ent?o o ser humano se transforma numa luminria, iluminando seus semelhantes e o caminho por onde passa. O esprito inteligente e evoludo trata o dem?nio como o toureiro procede com o touro: quando percebe a aproxima??o, diz: ol!, fazendo-o passar de um lado para o outro, impedindo-o de colidir. No entanto, o esprito pequeno, tacanho, medocre, que ainda est em evolu??o, n?o se desvia do dem?nio e deixa-o incorporar, at que um dia evolua e n?o seja mais cavalgadura do maligno.|`|a83cf77545ed089229763b6e315a35acaa	Algumas pessoas s?o o diabo em nossa vida!|`|dd3eb71786a00f8d51feb7bc044a9e7eaa	Eu n?o acredito que exista um ser para representar o diabo, mas muitos espritos maus, inferiores que fazem somente o mau, que est?o a nos cercar e nos influenciando a praticar o mau.

Por isso voc n?o consegue dormir direito.    Apesar de todos os riscos e aspectos detestveis do aborto, h aqueles que justificam tal prtica. Mas, poder-se-ia perguntar: Se  errado matar bebs recm-nascidos, n?o  igualmente errado matar um beb que se desenvolve na madre? Se  correto tentar preservar a vida de bebs prematuros em incubadoras, n?o ser correto preservar a vida dum feto no ventre?  O Criador da vida, Jeov Deus, considera a vida como sagrada. O aborto provocado deliberadamente  um ato criminoso  vista de Deus. Sua lei a Israel, para exemplificar, protegia a vida dum beb por nascer. Se certa mulher grvida, numa luta entre homens, sofresse um acidente fatal ao feto, tinha-se que pagar vida por vida.  xo. 21:22-25.  A freqncia dos abortos hoje tambm se relaciona ao fato de o homem ignorar outras leis de Deus. As pessoas desejam a chamada moral livre, e colhem resultados indesejados  c?njuges indesejados, doen?as indesejadas e gravidezes indesejadas. Em seus empenhos de fugir das conseqncias da maneira mais fcil, desejam divrcios mais fceis, tratamento mdico mais fcil e leis menos rigorosas. Mas, isto n?o as tem poupado das conseqncias trgicas adicionais. A nica solu??o para a trgica situa??o moral hodierna  o homem e a mulher se amarem nos vnculos do matrim?nio, planejando com sensatez sua vida em comum e obedecendo lealmente a seu Deus e Criador.

um9W8Dy8aa	Jesus said "Go and make disciples of all nations and baptize..."  Hence, adults should become disciples before they are baptized     Babies should be baptized since whole households came to be baptized and that would include babies who are brought into the New Covenant just as that included babies in the Old Covenant    Just baptizing adults (or children who are of "age of reason) without giving them time to make a real decision and to know "what they are getting into" does not seem to be at all sensible    There is nothing legalistic about putting people through a time of inquiry and a time of preparation and study before joining the Church.    "Marry in haste ,repent in leisure." The scandal of joining a church and then apostasizing because of ignorance about the demands of the Gospel will not be avoided if we just "dunk anybody i can get my hands on"    "The squirt gun in the maternity ward" attitude of just baptizing any baby without an assurance that the parents are Christian themselves and have a commitment to raise their child as Christian by word, example and practice is not respecting the Sacrament either, in my opinion.  If one takes baptism seriously one should go through a process,unless one is dying or, like the Nubian Eunuch, one will not have the opportunity again and one is ready by grace and knowledge.|`|9mLjDa5kaa	That's a lot of legalistic bondage you got there.     In the Book of Acts, those who believed the truth about Jesus, were baptised immediately.  No "ceremony", no "counselors", no rigamaroll.  Baptisms were done by any believer.     I'll stick with the Bible, and avoid the teachings of man's "traditions".|`|6e1884100ea01ca5c165183590f92363aa	I am Catholic too, and I think you summed up the process very well. The wonderful and rich teachings of Jesus Christ cannot be summed up on one prayer card or in one Bible verse so it's very important to have that formation in place before one becomes a disciple of Christ.    A Christian who is knowledgeable about the faith is more prepared to do battle in the spiritual realm and in the world of false ideas.    People should keep in mind, too, that it is not REQUIRED that these things be done before baptism. Case in point - infant baptism, which is how most Catholics "receive the faith." The reason these things are in place for adults is because the older a person is the more false ideas and worldly habits are entrenched, and these can sometimes be a hindrance to a new believer and his walk with Christ.    So Chris, why exactly is it a bad thing ("legalistic") to learn the teachings of Jesus Christ and to study His Word before receiving such an important sacrament as baptism?    Peace be to you all+|`|3WYcPsm4aa	An infant... just the parents, if they are not members of the congregation.  If they are members, then just a visit with Pastor.  For an adult.... generally education about Christianity and basic Lutheran theology regarding Holy Baptism.  Takes as long as Pastor feels is necessary.  Now, for Holy Communion... that's a whole other story.  That does involve adult confirmation classes, including Lutheran theology and doctrine, and study of the Bible.  Plan on about a year if you're an adult.  3-4 years for preteens/teens. |`|Dd0muPF6aa	The body of elders ensure that no one is baptized without full understanding of the basic teachings of God's Word, the Holy Bible.     Before baptism one is expected to have applied Bible principles in his or her life. That includes the Bible's standard of morality, preaching the Good News (Gospel) of God's Kingdom among other things (Matthew 24.14)    He/she should have dedicated his/her life in doing the will of the Almighty God, Jehovah.That dedication can then be symbolized with water baptism. |`|aZvWDxqvaa	Unfortunately, today most churches believe everyone needs to go to some course to get baptized. I think this is totally umbilical. While it is through the preaching of the Word that brings salvation, which I guess you can call a course, it was not some drawn out thing in order to learn scripture or jump through any hoops.     Cases in point:    Peter baptizing Cornelius and the household of believers (Acts 10:44-48).    Peter preaching to a crowd after Pentecost baptized (Acts 2:38-41).    Philip baptizing the Ethiopian Eunuch (Acts 8:26-38).    It has seemed that instead of just letting the Holy Spirit convict man and change his heart unto repentance and baptism, the churches has added a bunch of regulations as if they were some elite country club.|`|dhs9QBMoaa	Sorry, this doesn't actually answer your question.  I'm just curious about the whole "conversion" process before baptism.  If there was a need for counselling and a discernment period, what was the apostle Philip doing in Acts 9:36-38?  A 6-9 month "faith formation"?  What in the world is that all about?  To whom do you direct your faith, God or the doctrine of the church?  Sorry - don't mean to insult or anything...just wondering.  |`|x38Fb1UZaa	The practice of the Orthodox Church is too much to condense in to an answer section here.

I was living 2 hours away from home, and hadn't found a church yet (newly believing), so I phoned the pastor of my sisters church and set a date for two weeks. On that Sunday before the service we had a quick chat about what would happen, then after the service he said a few words and that I would be baptized, and if anyone else wanted to they could aswell.     I was able to say a little something about why I was doing this/my testimony first in the microphone. They had an under floor mini pool thing that the pastor walked down into, then I followed. He laid me back, and I got out dripping and then got changed out the back.  One guy decided he would be baptized after me.    This kind of 'emersion' baptism is common in all the churches I've been to.|`|h2HxsSJ5aa	My current church is Unitarian and doesn't baptise.  My previous church was Anglican and practiced both infant and adult baptism.  I strongly disapprove of infant baptism, and clearly the procedure would be different for infants and adults.  For adults, there would be confirmation classes over several months.  They would also be quite likely to have been on one of the outreach courses run by the church which are quite similar to Alpha courses and go on for several months as well before they got to that point, so i suppose the whole process would take about a year.|`|fYZ1XOhNaa	I agree with Chris.Prior to baptism,really all you need is a confirmation from the one to be baptized that they do understand what the Gospel(good news) is all about,But Jesus said not to deny even the little children.Since baptism is clearly an outward sign of comitting  ones life to Jesus Christ,then we are to simply confess Him as Lord and My Pesonal Savior and be done with it.You really ought to study the scriptures on when the church was started.These people jeard the Gospel ,as many as 3,000 in one day were saved and baptized!!!Go figure!! Does'nt sound like the catholic faith to me.|`|AA11174302	The only 'qualifications' you need to be baptised are that you have accepted God's salvation by believing that his son, Jesus Christ, died bearing your sin, and that you wish to express your love for him by following his commandments.  Baptism is a sign of your committment to serving the Lord, and normally precedes your joining a local church of God so it is appropriate to discuss this with the elders or deacons of the church to ensure that you know what you are committing yourself to.  There is more about the meaning and practice of baptism on the churches of God website linked below.|`|AA11827424	Since we baptise infants, there is no hard and fast rule about adult converts. They have to contact a priest and go through catechism, but how long that will last or what exactly it will cover depends on the candidate's background.|`|IZMxkGsCaa	Does some preparation occur?  Absolutely, need it be as extensive as you relate in your question?  No.      In the churches of Christ, baptism is usually seen as being for the forgiveness of sins.  As such, only those who have reached an "age of accountability" where they can recognize their sins as such are baptized.  Historically, this meant adult baptism, but the trend has come to be younger baptisms, usually in the teen or even "tween" years.    Going along with the necessity to understand sin, one must also understand their need for salvation.  Baptism comes only after sin is acknowledged and only after a confession is made that Jesus is the Son of God who died on the cross for the forgiveness of sins.  The individual concerned typically makes that decision for him/herself, but often has guidance from ministers, elders, parents, or friends.    The tricky thing is that do we ever really understand baptism?  Looking back on our baptism each day brings new understanding of what it means.  Baptism alone is not enough; unfortunately, the Church of Christ has a bad habit of thinking that everything will take care of itself in the life of a baptized believer if they only attend church regularly and take communion each week.    As for exceptions to the need for baptism, they are certainly found in scripture, but they are just that, exceptions.  The clear testimony of both scripture and tradition is that baptism is an important part of the life of the Christian.  An important part, but not the only part.  A necessary part, perhaps (unless you are dying on a cross next to the Savior), but never as important as the part played by God and his Son.    By the way, the early church history you mention dates, at its earliest, to the Second Century.  The earliest, non-Biblical writing of the church we have is the Didache, and while it has been dated as early as 70 A.D., it seems far more likely to have been written later in the first century or even very early in the Second.  It says, concerning baptism, "Now about baptism, baptize this way: after first uttering all of these things, baptize "into the name of the Father and of the son and of the holy Spirit" in running water. But if you do not have running water, baptize in other water. Now if you are not able to do so in cold water, do it in warm water. Now if you don't have either, pour water three times on the head, "into the name of the Father, and of the son, and of the holy Spirit." Now before the ritual cleansing, the baptizer and the one being baptized should fast, and any others who are able. Now you will give word for the one who is being baptized to fast for one or two days beforehand."    So yes, some preparation is indicated, but nothing as extensive as what you have indicated.  I'm not going to say my tradition is absolutely correct.  I think I've indicated some flaws in the CoC approach as I see it.  Of all people, you'd expect to find a CoCer arguing with you a lot more than what I am, but is that really conducive to strengthening our mutual faith, even with our differences?    I hope I've helped.|`|cGA957ifaa	I'm Apostolic Pentecostal. At my church we do nothing like u do. If a person wishes to join our church, our doors are always open to them. They do not have to go through anything with counselors, they do not have to learn about our religion unless they want to. Whenever they feel ready to get baptized all they do is tell our pastor when they want to get baptized. He may talk to them to make sure they know what they are doing then he sets a date & baptizes them.|`|d527a87be5a35816ffc2dcef7b56ab1eaa	If you wish to become a Jehovah's Witness, one must learn and conform to the requirements set out in the bible to be a follower of Jesus Christ. There is no set time limit on how long this takes.  Turning around from former ways that you have now learned are not in line with the scriptures is part of this process.  Once you have done this, you make a dedication to Jehovah God in prayer, and then symbolize it by water immersion.  Sharing what you know with others is an essential part of worship, which is also what Jesus said his true followers would do.|`|Js0nT1e3aa	I disagree with your view that the early CHRISTians had any space between the time of their salvation and the baptismal experience (please post any historical proof) however im not a trained historian.  I am a southern Baptist and i had my salvation experience at 5 years of age it was a very supernatural event which i have no space here to convey .after i walked up to the preacher during the time of invitation when protestants "go up" to receive CHRIST into our harts (when we respond to the calling of the HOLY SPIRIT) there was i think maybe two meetings with myself , my mom and the preacher who would perform the baptismal service.Basically he sat me down and asked questions to see that i did indeed understand what was happening to me and who JESUS is and what it meant to be baptized.Before this time i do remember (maybe in the week prior to my experience) talking with my mom and asking about being saved.  So after all that , the following sunday- right before the main worship service , i was baptized into the body of CHRIST .  I stayed close to GOD until the age of 15 when i started to totally rebel against both GOD and man - I returned to my faith (going to church/daily prayer/reading the BIBLE )when i turned about 29 or 30 and went through a "recommitment"ceremony when i turned 30 years old.  I am now 37 and i regularly attend church and i am closer to the living GOD now than i ever even dreamed i would be and i am so happy and excited about spirituality now , in fact its just about all i think about.I did not start "matureing" in my faith untill my 30 year.  I know this is more info than you asked for - but its such a wodnerfull experience i just cant help it !   so it was aproximently one week from my public anouncement of my belife in CHRIST JESUS to my baptisum.   |`|qY68muZZaa	The seventh-day adventist church teaches as did the disciples that a person must be old enough to understand that they are sinners and that they cannot correct themselves and are in need of outside help to be acceptable to live with God in Heaven. The only help that is available is the help that our God in heaven has provided and that is Jesus of Nazareth, the only begotten Son of God and that He was crucitied and buried and resurrected the third day and is sitting at the right hand of our Father in Heaven pleading our case. Jno. 3:16; Acts 16:29-32; --4:12; Eph. 2:8-9. Also Jno. 14:15 and Math. 5:17 and 1Jno. 5:3. Obedience to Gods written word. This can not be demonstrated in one day as some people seem to think . There are many mo0re things taught in Gods holy word that the converts need to understand that is obligatory upon those who take on the name of Jesus that they must show that they have accepted. Anyone who thinks this can be accomplished in a short time need to read carefully the accounts of baptism in the bible. They will see that all those examples they are quoting was of individuals who were already practising obedience to Gods word and only needed to Understand that they were only needing to accept Jesus sacrifice on that cross as their ticket to Gods Kingdom. I pray this answers your question. I know it is short and incomplete. It does help I think.

"Kashrut" comes from the Hebrew root Kaf-Shin-Resh, meaning fit, proper or correct. It is the same root as the more commonly known word "kosher," which describes food that meets these standards. The word "kosher" can also be used, and often is used, to describe ritual objects that are made in accordance with Jewish law and are fit for ritual use.     Contrary to popular misconception, rabbis or other religious officials do not "bless" food to make it kosher. There are blessings that observant Jews recite over food before eating it, but these blessings have nothing to do with making the food kosher. Food can be kosher without a rabbi or priest ever becoming involved with it: the vegetables from your garden are undoubtedly kosher (as long as they don't have any bugs, which are not kosher!). However, in our modern world of processed foods, it is difficult to know what ingredients are in your food and how they were processed, so it is helpful to have a rabbi examine the food and its processing and assure kosher consumers that the food is kosher. This certification process is discussed below.     There is no such thing as "kosher-style" food. Kosher is not a style of cooking. Chinese food can be kosher if it is prepared in accordance with Jewish law, and there are many fine kosher Chinese restaurants in Philadelphia and New York. Traditional Ashkenazic Jewish foods like knishes, bagels, blintzes, and matzah ball soup can all be non-kosher if not prepared in accordance with Jewish law. When a restaurant calls itself "kosher-style," it usually means that the restaurant serves these traditional Jewish foods, and it almost invariably means that the food is not actually kosher.     Food that is not kosher is commonly referred to as treyf (lit. torn, from the commandment not to eat animals that have been torn by other animals).|`|702f1401889c0ca8e2fb5ac7847aed29aa	kosher means anything that has touched non kosher meat or contains kosher meat.

To see how the biblical months starts with the first crescent establishing the pattern for the month. Then to go on a find the true Sabbath of God each lunar month.    Second, applying the lunar month, to find out that between Yeshua's last Passover meal and when he was crucified was about a week's time. In laying out a lunar month, Passover happens between the end of Sabbath (14th day) and the First day of Unleavened Bread (15th day). Then a big hint in the Christian gospel - the High Sabbath. This happens when Sabbath lands on another holiday - which only happens on the Eighth day of Unleavened bread.    By seeing where Passover sits and where the High Sabbath occurs, one can see that the arrest, prison beating, brought before Pilate and Herod -- this happened over a weeks time, not over night as so many believe.

BUT, rejoice!  I have a suggestion, which follows:    First off, my goal is NOT to decrease the cost of my meal, including tip. I am satisfied with the total paid. But rather to help out the food servers that we hear from daily complaining about the bad tippers, or those who don't tip at all, or tip 15% instead of 20% or whatever the complaint du jour is.    THIS IS THE SUGGESTION:  How about the restaurant giving the server the same basic salary as now, but give them a commission on what they sell!  ______________________________________...    The restaurant owner must already compute the sales per server for income tax purposes, and must pay the server their tips from those credit card slips when it was added to that instead of cash. So, the bookwork needed is already in place.    The advantages:  1) the customer would not need to decide how much to give the server, that would be decided by negotiation with the restaurant owner, just like the rest of our salaries are.    2) no one would short tip or stiff our loyal and kind hearted servers again.    3) servers would be obligated to pay taxes on ALL the money they receive!    4) as in all other service jobs, if the server was not pleasant or helpful or prompt, we would complain to the manager, stop going to the restaurant, or simply ask for another server. Very simple.    5) We would not have to listen to servers whining about tips anymore in Yahoo! Answers.    Again, this has absolutely NOTHING to do with paying less for a meal. MOST COUNTRIES DO NOT TIP, or at least do not tip as a "required custom" which considered a server's pay. They are paid a wage, a tip is either very small as a consideration, or as a reward for EXTRA service.    What are the flaws with this idea to help our servers?      Please, anyone saying other countries tip and pay as we do in the USA, either don't lie, or back up your statement with some links to prove what you say. It simply isn't the system in most places in the entire world (outside of International Hotel Chains, and that tip in SE Asia is 7.8%, and may be skipped if the customer wishes)    Thank you for asking, I feel so much better now.|`|C4BJ3yLWaa	You, your name, your responses.

XN0cYCATaa	Unfortunately, the philosophy of relativism is pervasive in our culture today.  With the rejection of God, and Christianity in particular, absolute truth is being abandoned.  Our pluralistic society wants to avoid the idea that there really is a right and wrong.  This is evidenced in our deteriorating judicial system that has more and more trouble punishing criminals, in our entertainment media which continues to push the envelope of morality and decency, in our schools which teach evolution and "social tolerance", etc.  In addition, the plague of moral relativism is encouraging everyone to accept homosexuality, pornography on TV, fornication, and a host of other "sins" that were once considered wrong, but are now being accepted and even promoted in society.  It is becoming so pervasive that if you speak out against moral relativism and its "anything goes" philosophy, you're labeled as an intolerant bigot.  Of course, this is incredibly hypocritical of those who profess that all points of view are true, yet reject those who profess absolutes in morality.   It seems that what is really meant by the moral relativists is that all points of view are true except for the views that teach moral absolutes, or an absolute God, or absolute right and wrong.       Some typical expressions that reveal an underlying presupposition of relativism are comments such as "That is your truth, not mine," "It is true for you, but not for me," and "There are no absolute truths."  Of course, these statements are illogical, which I demonstrate in the paper "Refuting relativism."  Relativism is invading our society, our economy, our schools, and our homes.  Society cannot flourish nor survive in an environment where everyone does what is right in his own eyes, where the situation determines actions and if the situation changes, lying or cheating is acceptable -- as long as you're not caught.  Without a common foundation of truth and absolutes, our culture will become weak and fragmented.         I must admit, however, that there is validity to some aspects of relativism. For example, what one society considers right (driving on the left side of the road) another considers wrong. These are customs to which a "right and wrong" are attached, but they are purely relativistic and not universal because they are culturally based.  Child rearing principles vary in different societies as do burial practices and wedding ceremonies. These "right and wrong ways" are not cosmically set in stone nor are they derived from some absolute rule of conduct by some unknown god.  They are relative and rightly so.  But, their relativism is properly asserted as such.  It doesn't matter what side of the road we drive in as long as we all do it the same way.        Likewise, there are experiences that are valid only for individuals. I might be irritated by a certain sound, where another person will not. In this sense, what is true for me is not necessarily true for someone else. It is not an absolute truth that the identical sound causes irritation to all people.  This is one way of showing that certain aspects of relativism are true.  But, is it valid to say that because there is a type of personal relativism that we can then apply that principle to all areas of experience and knowledge and say that they too are also relative? No, it is not a valid assumption.  First of all, to do so would be an absolute assessment which contradicts relativism.       Furthermore, if all the things are relative, then there cannot be anything that is absolutely true between individuals. In other words, if all people deny absolute truth and establish relative truth only from their experiences, then everything is relative to the individual.  How then can there be a common ground from which to judge right and wrong or truth? It would seem that there cannot be.        Of course, the issue that is important here is whether or not there are absolute truths.  Also, can there be different kinds of absolute truths if indeed there are absolute truths?  We might ask if it is always wrong to lie? Or, does 1 + 1 always equal 2?  Is it always true that something cannot be both in existence and not in existence at the same time? Is it always true that something cannot bring itself into existence if it first does not exist? If any of these questions can be answered in the affirmative then relativism is refuted -- at least to some degree.        More questions arise. If all moral views are equally valid, then do we have the right to punish anyone? Can we ever say that something is wrong?  In order to say that something is wrong we must first have a standard by which we weigh right and wrong in order to make a judgment. If that standard of right and wrong is based on relativism, then it is not a standard at all.  In relativism, standards of right and wrong are derived from social norms.  Since society changes, the norms would change and so would right and wrong.  If right and wrong change, then|`|xMNMOJu2aa	Everything is relative.

I would say at that point, whether you think theft is okay is relative to whether you're the one benefiting from it.  For the most part, though, you aren't an entire people and chances are you won't get to genocidally slaughter your enemies and then rewrite history once they're gone, so yeah.  For you, it's going to end up being wrong.    And yes, morals are relative. To those who say they derive from an absolute authority, I think Susan B.

The classic passage from the Bible that answers this question is John 3:1-21. The Lord Jesus Christ is talking to Nicodemus, a prominent Pharisee and member of the Sanhedrin (a ruler of the Jews). Nicodemus had come to Jesus at night. Nicodemus had questions to ask Jesus.    As Jesus talked with Nicodemus, He said, I tell you the truth, no one can see the kingdom of God unless he is born again. How can a man be born when he is old? Nicodemus asked. Surely he cannot enter a second time into his mothers womb to be born! Jesus answered, I tell you the truth, no one can enter the kingdom of God unless he is born of water and the Spirit. Flesh gives birth to flesh, but the Spirit gives birth to spirit. You should not be surprised at my saying, You must be born again (John 3:3-7).    The phrase "born again" literally means "born from above." Nicodemus had a real need. He needed a change of his hearta spiritual transformation. New birth, being born again, is an act of God whereby eternal life is imparted to the person who believes (2 Corinthians 5:17; Titus 3:5; 1 Peter 1:3; 1 John 2:29; 3:9; 4:7; 5:1-4, 18). John 1:12,13 indicates that "born again" also carries the idea "to become children of God" through trust in the name of Jesus Christ.    The question logically comes, "Why does a person need to be born again?" The Apostle Paul in Ephesians 2:1 says, "And you He made alive, who were dead in trespasses and sins..." (NKJV). To the Romans in Romans 3:23, the Apostle wrote, "For all have sinned and fall short of the glory of God." So, a person needs to be born again in order to have their sins forgiven and have a relationship with God.    How does that come to be? Ephesians 2:8-9 states, "For it is by grace you have been saved, through faithand this not from yourselves, it is the gift of Godnot by works, so that no one can boast." When one is "saved," he/she has been born again, spiritually renewed, and is now a child of God by right of new birth. Trusting in Jesus Christ, the One who paid the penalty of sin when He died on the cross, is what it means to be "born again" spiritually. "Therefore, if anyone is in Christ, he is a new creation: the old has gone, the new has come!" (2 Corinthians 5:17).    If you have never trusted in the Lord Jesus Christ as your Savior, will you consider the prompting of the Holy Spirit as He speaks to your heart? You need to be born again. Will you pray the prayer of repentance and become a new creation in Christ today? "Yet to all who received him, to those who believed in his name, he gave the right to become children of God children born not of natural descent, nor of human decision or a husbands will, but born of God" (John 1:12-13).    If you want to accept Jesus Christ as your Savior and be born again, here is a sample prayer. Remember, saying this prayer or any other prayer will not save you. It is only trusting in Christ that can save you from sin. This prayer is simply a way to express to God your faith in Him and thank Him for providing for your salvation. "God, I know that I have sinned against you and am deserving of punishment. But Jesus Christ took the punishment that I deserve so that through faith in Him I could be forgiven. I place my trust in You for salvation. Thank You for Your wonderful grace and forgivenessthe gift of eternal life! Amen!"    Have you made a decision for Christ because of what you have read here?

Nascer, morrer, renascer ainda, progredir continuamente, tal  a Lei`` (Allan Kardec)    ALM DA MORTE  Cumprida mais uma jornada na terra, seguem os espritos para a ptria espiritual, conduzindo a bagagem dos feitos acumulados em suas existncias fsicas.  Aportam no plano espiritual, nem anjos, nem dem?nios.  S?o homens, almas em aprendizagem despojadas da carne.  S?o os mesmos homens que eram antes da morte.  A desencarna??o n?o lhes modifica hbitos, nem costumes.  N?o lhes outorga ttulos, nem conquistas. N?o lhes retira mritos, nem realiza??es.  Cada um se apresenta aps a morte como sempre viveu.  N?o ocorre nenhum milagre de transforma??o para aqueles que atingem o grande porto. Raros s?o aqueles que despertam com a conscincia livre, aps a inevitvel travessia.  A grande maioria, vinculada de forma intensa s sensa??es da matria, demora-se, infeliz, ignorando a nova realidade.  Muitos agem como turistas confusos em visita  grande cidade, buscando incessantemente endere?os que n?o conseguem localizar.  Sentem a alma visitada por afli??es e remorsos, receios e ansiedades. Se refletissem um pouco perceberiam que a vida prossegue sem grandes modifica??es.  Os escravos do prazer prosseguem inquietos. Os servos do dio demoram-se em afli??o. Os companheiros da ilus?o permanecem enganados. Os aficionados da mentira dementam-se sob imagens desordenadas. Os amigos da ignorancia continuam perturbados.  Alm disso, a maior parte dos seres n?o  capaz de perceber o apoio dispensado pelos espritos superiores. Sim, porque mesmo os seres mais infelizes e voltados ao mal n?o s?o esquecidos ou abandonados pelo Auxlio Divino.  Em toda parte e sem cessar, amigos espirituais amparam todos os seus irm?os, refletindo a paternal providncia divina.  Morrer, longe de ser o descansar nas mans?es celestes ou o expurgar sem remiss?o nas zonas infelizes, , pura e simplesmente, recome?ar a viver.  A morte a todos aguarda. Preparar-se para tal acontecimento  tarefa inadivel. Apenas as almas esclarecidas e experimentadas na batalha redentora ser?o capazes de transpor a barreira do tmulo e caminhar em liberdade.  A reencarna??o  uma bendita oportunidade de evolu??o.  A matria em que nos encontramos imersos, por ora,  aben?oado campo de luta e de aprimoramento pessoal.  Cada dia de que dispomos na carne  nova chance de recome?o.  Tal benefcio deve ser aproveitado para aquisi??o dos verdadeiros valores que resistem  prpria morte. Na contabilidade divina a soma de a??es nobres anula a coletanea equivalente de atos indignos.  Todo amor dedicado ao prximo, em servi?o educativo  humanidade,  degrau de ascens?o.  ***  Quando o vu da morte fechar os nossos olhos nesta existncia,  continuaremos vivendo, em outro plano e em condi??es diversas. Estaremos, no entanto, imbudos dos mesmos defeitos e das mesmas qualidades que nos movimentavam antes do transe da morte.  A adapta??o a essa nova realidade depender da forma como nos tivermos preparado para ela. Semeamos a partir de hoje a colheita de venturas, ou de desdita, do amanh?.  Pense nisso.  (Divaldo Pereira Franco _ Esprito Otlia Gon?alves)    Deus  eterno, imutvel, imaterial, nico, todo-poderoso, soberanamente justo e bom.    Criou o Universo que compreende todos os seres animados e inanimados, materiais e imateriais. Os seres materiais constituem o mundo visvel ou corporal e os seres imateriais o mundo invisvel ou esprita, ou seja, dos Espritos.    O mundo esprita  o mundo normal, primitivo, eterno, preexistente e sobrevivente a tudo. O mundo corporal n?o  sen?o secundrio; poderia cessar de existir, ou n?o ter jamais existido, sem alterar a essncia do mundo esprita.    Os Espritos revestem, temporariamente, um envoltrio material perecvel, cuja destrui??o, pela morte, os torna livres.    Entre as diferentes espcies de seres corpreos, Deus escolheu a espcie humana para a encarna??o dos Espritos que atingiram um certo grau de desenvolvimento, o que lhes d a superioridade moral e intelectual sobre outros.    A alma  um Esprito encarnado, do qual o corpo n?o  sen?o um envoltrio.    H no homem trs coisas: 1o  o corpo ou ser material anlogo aos dos animais e animado pelo mesmo princpio vital; 2o  a alma ou ser imaterial, Esprito encarnado no corpo; 3o  o la?o que une a alma ao corpo, princpio intermedirio entre a matria e o Esprito.    O homem tem assim duas naturezas: pelo corpo, participa da natureza dos animais, dos quais tem o instinto; pela alma, participa da natureza dos Espritos.    O la?o ou perisprito que une o corpo e o Esprito  uma espcie de envoltrio semi-material. A morte  a destrui??o do envoltrio mais grosseiro, o Esprito conserva o segundo, que constitui para ele um corpo etreo, invisvel para ns no estado normal, mas que pode, acidentalmente, tornar-se visvel e mesmo tangvel, como ocorre no fen?meno das apari??es.-    O Esprito n?o  assim um ser abstrato, indefinido, que s o pensamento pode conceber;  um ser real, circunscrito, que, em certos casos,  apreciado pelos sentidos da vis?o, audi??o e tato.    Os Espritos pertencem a diferentes classes e n?o s?o iguais nem em for?a, nem em inteligncia, nem em saber, nem em moralidade.    Os da primeira ordem s?o os Espritos superiores, que se distinguem dos outros pela sua perfei??o, seus conhecimentos, sua aproxima??o de Deus, a pureza de seus sentimentos e seu amor ao bem; s?o os anjos ou Espritos puros. As outras classes se distanciam cada vez mais dessa perfei??o; os das classes inferiores s?o inclinados  maioria das n|`|72e15e919a65b1796ed6e280962b54bbaa	Vida aps a morte, sim, eu acredito.

Il trattato costituzionale stabilisce le modifiche da apportare al trattato Euratom "nel protocollo che modifica il trattato Euratom" allegato alla Costituzione. Le modifiche apportate al trattato Euratom dal trattato costituzionale si limitano ad adeguamenti alle nuove regole stabilite dalla Costituzione, in particolare nel settore istituzionale e finanziario. In Italia non sono state prese neanche in considerazione per il fatto delle norme di sicurezza e delle zone adatte alla loro costituzione. Scorie radioattive e altri problemi impediscono la loro realizzazione compresi i costi eccessivi per proteggere la popolazione da eventuali fuoriuscite di radiazioni. I pericoli sono ancora non sormontabili. Non siamo in grado di proteggere e quindi non sono favorevole|`|61993a101236b4ecfb30f7f9be8efdabaa	favorevolissimo. perch rimanere dipendenti dagli altri paesi quando qualche centrale termonucleare potrebbe risolvere la maggior parte dei nostri prblemi di energia?|`|deee94b1177a88e663c733818496944daa	Favorevole!!! Intanto se pensiamo al richio, ne abbiamo una qui vicina, in Francia, a 100 km da casa mia. Tanto vale mettersene una in casa e non pagare cos tanto l'energia!!|`|6DlepM6naa	pre le centrali nucleari io sono contrario , certo ,  un energia pulita , potente ed economica ma pensate ai servizi italiani..... in Francia le centrali sono perfette perch c' un controllo grandioso , qui il controllo potrebbe avere alti e bassi , un esplosione nucleare farebbe una catastrofe poich va nell' acqua e ci avveleniamo bevendo , va negli animali quindi nel cibo , va nell' aria , non ci sarebbe via di scampo , fate una riflessione...|`|awzWD6o4aa	Io sono favorevole e a coloro che accampano motivi di sicurezza per essere contrari dico questo: se esplodesse una centrale nucleare in Francia i danni in Italia sarebbero pi o meno equivalenti come se l'avessimo sul nostro territorio, quindi tanto vale....|`|bbd886745f492e9ad8ca01aac5f04a51aa	sfavorevole, del resto di centrali nucleari in tutto il mondo ne son state costruite pochissime, dovrebbero essere una decina, perch in realt il problema sono lo stoccaggio delle scorie radioattive, pur consapevole che se scoppiasse una centrale in francia le radiazioni colpirebbero anche noi c' da considerare che per realizzarne una ci vorrebbero almeno 10 anni, ad essere ottimisti. Oltretutto per come vengono gestite le cose in italia il rischio sarebbe molto alto. l'investimento richiesto in ogni caso sarebbe di miliardi, per una cosa, che come succede al paese classificato ultimo come qualit dei servizi pubblici, rischierebbe di non vedere mai il suo completamento.
AA11902003	Lo mismo me pregunto sobre benny hin y muchos predicadores que hicieron su dinero en base a gente que confi en ellos y les entrego su f. Pero no hablemos solo del papa y ellos. Porque no hablamos de millones de misioneros y jesuitas que dejan todo por irse a los lugares ms alejados a llevar el evangelio??? O la madre Teresa que vivi en pobreza y ayud al ms necesitado?? NO hay que generalizar religiones a partir de un simple hecho o una simple persona. Hay mucha riqueza en la fe cristiana.  Y en relacin al aborto... que hubieras hecho si tu mam te hubiera mandado a la chingada?? por simple tica moral, no creo que sea justo matar a alguien indefenso que tiene sobre todas las cosas, derecho a la vida.  Y aunque no tenga experiencia en matrimonio, llevan la palabra de Dios, que conoce mejor que cualquier ser persona los padecimientos humanos y el diario vivir de cada uno de nosotros.  Le das permiso a Dios transmitir su palabra a travs de la gente que el llam a servirle??  Le das permiso que hable a travs de ellos sobre el aborto, la pobreza y tantas injusticias humanas..???|`|3bb00c75f631c1374c70ef01ee4bce0aaa	Al fin y al cabo da lo mismo; como dicen los dichos: El habito no hace al Monje, Y la mona aunque se vista de seda, Mona se queda.|`|d242c69a06284d001db22d40e58a5a7faa	Claro que si...pero vos viste...la iglesia catlica hace todo lo contrario a las ense?anza de Dios Hijo.|`|cn3nl6G4aa	Por que sino la iglesia no seria el negocio millonario que es hoy en da!!!|`|eaee20068a29b2d07903b15342bd5964aa	Concuerdo.   Slo la teora es su base. Creo que los sacerdotes, an el Papa deberan casarse, tener hijos, etc. Pero fundamentalmente creo que deberan seguir el ejemplo de Jess en cuanto a los votos de pobreza y humildad|`|Ef9tAI6Yaa	No hubo, no hay y no habr otro como Jess que siendo el Rey de reyes vivi humildemente pensando slo en el prjimo hasta incluso morir en la cruz por todos nosotros. Saludos.|`|8ImZ1p5Kaa	Se basa en mucho, estudio, fe, doctrina, ,,,,,,,  ?En que nos basamos nosotros para hablar del papa, los sacerdotes, los religiosos en general, los nmeros enteros, los tornados, los conejos; si no somos nada de eso?|`|0b3bcc983dfdf0477c0d9cc06e59f056aa	en teoria asid eberia ser, pero buenooo, la religion catolica no es de lo mas congruente que hay en el mundo.|`|9o4boDKOaa	Nuestro santo papa ? estas loca !!|`|8e6925bacca35b675dfb3d20e600d9c0aa	La religin debera ser as ,humilde ,que no tenga desos de lucrarse pero lamentablemente hay muchas que hacen tropezar las personas.|`|5yA8qqhiaa	esas son cuestiones de relleno recuerda que su chamba es joder en nombre de el cielo, por eso cuando te digan que es en nombre de el dios corre, por que te van a chingar o no te acuerdas de todas las guerras santas|`|5c98406661bacb23346d53022b914832aa	Si bien coincido contigo en mucho de lo q expresas en tu pregunta pero los curas si estudian no como muchos boludos q hablan en los medios y los utilizan para su beneficio es cierto q en gran parte el vaticano es un gran negocio pero tambin es cierto de q si no fuese un negocio con q se mantendra con la caridad de la gente vamos esa no se la cree nadie (eso es por la respuesta anterior cada uno puede tener su punto de vista pero eso no quita q hay q pensar de ves en cuando y no hablar por lo q se escucha) Si bien puede ser q no halla sido pobre y q no tubo las experiencia de vida q tubo Juan Pablo Segundo ELLOS LEEN Y SE MANTIENE INFORMADO SOBRE LA REALIDAD SOCIAL Y CAPAS Q EL NO LA EXPERIMENTA DE LLENO PERO MUCHAS DE LAS CONGREGACIONES Q ESTN DISTRIBUIDAS EN EL MUNDO SI HAY Q ACORDARSE Q NADIE ES PERFECTO Y Q NO HAY Q JUZGAR SI NO SE QUIERE SER JUZGADO  por lo menos la iglesia habla sobre estos temas es mucho mas de lo q se puede decir de muchos polticos en el mundo|`|CaSCWnYuaa	El Papa, todos los sacerdotes, y todos los pastores evanglicos, deberan andar como Jess, pero los primeros andan ensalzados, segn por su jerarqua; y los pastores andan ensalzados segn por estar bendecidos; todos los lideres religiosos pierden el piso cuando empiezan a ver el dinero(va limosnas o va diezmos y ofrendas) y el poder. Ojala Dios me perdone a m por juzgar a los hombres de Dios, y a ellos por no seguir su noble ejemplo    Pero no olvidemos, "tanto amo Dios al mundo que envi a su hijo unignito, para que todo aquel que crea en l no muera, sino que tenga vida eterna"|`|74eb1b48018dd561d8c0fde6e9c5e376aa	Cuando uno va a la Universidad, y estudias un determinado arte, o ciencia. Puedes salir y dar clases de ese arte o esa ciencia. Aunque tu nunca haigas ido a la luna, sabes que existe. Ademas el papa nunca ha tenido el ttulo de consejero matrimonial, para eso estn los terapistas de pareja, que tiene profesin psiclogo. El aborto es un crimen. Y todo asesinato es un desorden moral grave. Si puede opinar al respecto, porque es clara la ley de Dios, de no mataras. La Iglesia Catlica, tiene cientos, quizas miles de instituciones de caridad repartidas en todo el mundo. Dedica una parte muy importante de sus ingresos a las obras de caridad en todo el mundo, especialmente, en los pases mas pobres y necesitados, donde nunca ha llegado, ni llegar la ONU. Durante la guerra de Irak, fue la nica representacin diplomtica que se mantuvo abierta durante todo el conflicto. Tiene hospitales, orferinatos, comedores populares gratuitos, promueve la caridad en todo el mundo. Jesucristo anduvo en burro, porque era el medio de transporte de su poca. Tenlo por seguro que si en la epoca aquella hubiera habido, transporte publico, como trenes, los hubiera utilizado, si hubiera habido carros, se hubiera subido a alguno, y si hubiera habido, aviones se hubiera subido a ellos. Quieres que el papa salga de Roma, en burro, hasta Brazil, por favor. El Papa utiliza la tecnologa para llevar el mensaje de Dios, el mensaje de Cristo a todo el mundo. Si hay aviones se sube a ellos, para visitar a los fieles de todo el mundo. Que de mal hay aqu. Si tuviera hijos, tenlo por seguro, no tuviera tiempo para andar recorriendo el mundo, no hubiera hecho nada de lo que ha hecho por toda la humanidad.|`|KnRKEvg4aa	Ni el papa ni la iglesia pueden hablar sobre ninguno de los temas que nombras., les falta autoridad moral , desde la epoca de las cruzadas estan metidos en todas las guerras, me sobran dedos de mi mano para contar los religiosos que han dado todo por el bien de los demas. como la MADRE TERESA.,  En la actualidad  les han mermado  las ganancias  pues tienen competencia de otras iglesias|`|a1PqAbpKaa	,Jesucristo vino a dejarnos un modelo de vida TODO cristiano debera hacer lo que Cristo hizo, el vivi una vida sencilla predicando de casa en casa y de ciudad en ciudad ,cualquier persona que quiera ser un verdadero cristiano debe hacer lo mismo.

Well, just try to know, whats makes God as god, the Power, isnt it? So what the power can do? Ah? Well, It can give the ability to organise all things and it can give the ability to separate everything and most importantly, the Ability to control everything, isnt it? Isnt it Good? Ah? So, what I try to say here is, from my hard study and research effort with the help from god, I realized that the ability to control everything, the Power of God is gradually increased in the full amount to use so, The Power of God is always the omnipotent and existed among everything. And The God now is always the same omnipotent for us, who is organised us and we are growing towards perfection. The perfection is the final stage, not the end. And The Power of God, the Ability is the reward for us to control everything in a proper manner, like the true God of goodness.  If god always perfect in perfection then there have to be beginning and end for that progress. So there is no end or beginning for all things so we cannot get anything from nothing. And  How could that be possible to be perfect in perfection always, ah? No way the perfection of god comes first or the growth towards perfection. There is No End and there is No beginning and so the Ability is for the Love of Joy And   ~ LOVE IS THE ABILITY ~   we have to lift it up little by little towards Perfection.   So it is    If you are humble, please... Pray to know the truth from true God by the inspiration of the Holy Spirit with great faith and. Good in Bad & Bad in Good so the values is most important. God gave us the rights to do what is right for you and sometimes, things can be right in your point of view but wrong in Public point of view so   Basically, just pray about it for the Good Answer and try to do the God's will first always   And  I have true testimony of true God   Please, just try to understand the fundamental...    If you think, why so much trouble and pain in this world? Then there is only one reason, without pain, No pleasure and without pleasure, no pain. So without them, we cannot enjoy this life so always we need them in our development towards the perfection of God. So-so you use pain and pleasure instead of pain and pleasure use you. I mean the vision of your future should be clear & it have to pull you rather than you have to push so you must link a lot of pleasure in order to succeed in the Best job. When you feel strong enough link a lot of pleasure in your subconscious mind. And your desire for success should be greater than your fear of failure.   And   It is Wonderful wonderful nature for us by the true God. And   we all make mistakes so it is hard to look for star in daylight. So just in faith it is possible. Like that the faith in true God. And If you think, even expert can be wrong then you have to make the fine research in all most everything so It is hard and some time, it is impossible to achieve so Why we need inappropriate action to find the owner of higher power? SO,  So, just try to understand, because of Lack of faith in true God, we do not have the great gift of understanding of things so   Just understand this please.  All things are spiritually first, to govern by God with glory so closely, Have a look at this world of wonders of yours and then you know the truth, when you listen to your real voice and then Having a strong desire to do the best every day then stick with the best to do your best. And most importantly, try to be grateful for what you have now and try to know where you come from to have the great gift of understanding and then, have the faith to become the best winner in your life. And this is the best meaning of happy life.  And   The Low of mercy cannot rob the Low of justice so God provided the way to our salvation to overcome our sin so Jesus Christ sacrifice is much needed to return to live with God, because God is perfect in perfection so Jesus Christ is our savior to pay our punishment of our sin so-so Because of the perfect love of god for you. So God gave Jesus Christ for us ~ FOR US ~  Well,    It is the time to make the great decision.  Good luck.     >>>      If you are interested, I gladly encourage you to visit the web side http://www.mormon.org for your spiritual support. & If you find this useful, please help others.

vvgmyX04aa	I think you are being unreasonable.    If it bothered you when she said she still loves her ex, fair enough, but she is not responsible for your feelings. I'm sorry but reacting by avoiding her seems rather immature and petty to me.    Here's the deal: she has an ex and there's history there. You don't want to be the person she talks to about it, fine, that's understandable. But if she was just saying there are issues and that still loves him, she was explaining and letting you know what was going on. Women often do it like that.    I'm sorry, but your reaction seems out of line and self centered passive-agressive. Just how it looks to me from your description.|`|lBLBvE0Zaa	I would have left too, but I think you should talk to her and let her know why you left, etc.    Good luck.  ;-)|`|LOSfacl5aa	No, you are not being mean. If you are going to be with someone you have the right to place your own limits. You obviously do not want to share her with some other guy. This is just the way you want a relationship, it is not like you are forcing her to be with you. Tell her that she has to choose between the two of you.  That being said, as a submissive she will find it difficult to extricate herself from what she was in before. You may just have to give up on her|`|le9ZROs5aa	Riley you have to tell her why you don't want to see her anymore. It is mean to just drop someone with absolutely no explanation. I don't blame you for being offended but you need to communicate that to her. K?|`|3OZgcntfaa	I can get why you left. Who needs that sort of drama?    Might be a little mean that you haven't even returned her calls to explain your side of the situation though. She should at least hear from you that you weren't comfortable with the situation and that you are offended by her little "still love" deal.    If it were me, I'd send her an email if I didn't think I could keep the drama out of a phone call. You'll probably feel bad later if you don't resolve this with some form of communication.|`|cCHHWSHNaa	I think she um didn't take him home but he id something "else"(if you know what I mean)and in otherwards she is trying to say that she wants to get back together with him.|`|MCW5tHv3aa	as others have said, I don't blame you for leaving her due to Drama. but you should at least give her the curtsy of explaining why you left.     after my separation from my ex, I did date a couple of people.. during that process I started learning my own boundaries, while being honest with the people I dated, about those boundaries..     whats interesting, is that some of those people have become friends, while those who seemed to invite drama to follow them, soon started loosing interest in me..     personally, being a full time single parent, student, advocate, and trans I honestly don't have time to play dramatic games.     and due to that, you could say that I also make whomever I date also fight for me, as a result I feel I have a wonderful relationship now.

But she did DUH. daughter waited two years befor she mentioned it.Then one morning at brekfst  She said that she was afraid of Cindy(BFF) because she thought Cindy had a crush on her. Mom blurted out" I am glad you are still a virgin" with that Dautr smiled at me and shook her head. I smiled back and we broke out in a gail of laughter at mom." Mom I am lesbian and have been forever, I never fell in love with boys at all, Neither did Cindy, We have been lovers three years and plan on spending a long time together. We want to date boys to go the places highschool goes but  we want to live together now. can we move into my room as a couple?? this was a 29 second speech that left mom speechless. A 14 year old co habitating with her lover in our home.&*^%& Yes was the answer and Grades were the deciding factor. They Graduated Validictor/4.0 and volleyball scholarships to KU to be coach PE/ teachers WE are very proud of them but her parents missed all of that with anger and resentment.

0S75fsMiaa	I have to agree with what has been said. If you are a student working for a non-profit or university center of some kind, don't get involved. They don't like one another, and the worst thing you can do is criticize their bad behavior. They both will regard you negatively.     If you go to their higher ups, you can't win. They are much more important to the organization than you are. The higher ups will ignore you, if you're lucky. They will let the people involved know that someone complained, if you're not.     It won't take long for the witch hunt to begin and, if you're the new person, who do you think they will suspect of complaining?    Now you will be in a situation where two members of senior management regard you as a trouble maker and a possible threat. Life at work will be great, as these two look for a reason to get rid of you so that they can fight in peace.    The politics of schools and non-profits can be worse than the in-fighting in a business because there is no requirement to get along and play as a team.     All that means is you have to put up with it, and the less you talk about it with anyone at work, the better it will be for you.|`|RXI8ImdIaa	Are you an intern?    If so, you're not really in a position to "do" anything about it. It's their company, or their responsibility when everything is foobar.    If your livelihood is being affected by these guys, though, you're probably justified in talking to someone who is higher up than they are. If there is no one higher up than them, well you're out of luck.    But pick your battles carefully. I'm guessing that this is something you don't need to be involved in.|`|KHC2oE8iaa	don't take this the wrong way but you sit back and shut the f*uck up. do not get involved if your bosses are squabbling. get your paycheck, earn your keep, and just drown those yackers out. sh*t i know what your going through lol. it's actually funny to watch. in your head your asking how did these numbnuts get to where they are? lol|`|AA11198190	You can voice your opinion.....

2QuGuphYaa	There is no hell.    However, the "idea" of hell has changed mainly due to the fact that it is becoming harder and harder to sell and to scare people with.  It used to be defined as very real and the whole fire and torture crap, however I have heard a newer interpretation being "an absence of god or of god's love".|`|9btru19waa	Luk 16:19 Jesus said, "There was a certain rich man who was splendidly clothed and who lived each day in luxury.         Luk 16:20 At his door lay a diseased beggar named Lazarus.         Luk 16:21 As Lazarus lay there longing for scraps from the rich man's table, the dogs would come and lick his open sores.         Luk 16:22 Finally, the beggar died and was carried by the angels to be with Abraham. [fn] The rich man also died and was buried,         Luk 16:23 and his soul went to the place of the dead. [fn] There, in torment, he saw Lazarus in the far distance with Abraham.         Luk 16:24 "The rich man shouted, `Father Abraham, have some pity! Send Lazarus over here to dip the tip of his finger in water and cool my tongue, because I am in anguish in these flames.'         Luk 16:25 "But Abraham said to him, `Son, remember that during your lifetime you had everything you wanted, and Lazarus had nothing. So now he is here being comforted, and you are in anguish.         Luk 16:26 And besides, there is a great chasm separating us. Anyone who wanted to cross over to you from here is stopped at its edge, and no one there can cross over to us.'         Luk 16:27 "Then the rich man said, `Please, Father Abraham, send him to my father's home.         Luk 16:28 For I have five brothers, and I want him to warn them about this place of torment so they won't have to come here when they die.'         Luk 16:29 "But Abraham said, `Moses and the prophets have warned them. Your brothers can read their writings anytime they want to.'         Luk 16:30 "The rich man replied, `No, Father Abraham! But if someone is sent to them from the dead, then they will turn from their sins.'         Luk 16:31 "But Abraham said, `If they won't listen to Moses and the prophets, they won't listen even if someone rises from the dead.' "     Rev 19:20 And the beast was captured, and with him the false prophet who did mighty miracles on behalf of the beast--miracles that deceived all who had accepted the mark of the beast and who worshiped his statue. Both the beast and his false prophet were thrown alive into the lake of fire that burns with sulfur.    Rev 20:10 Then the Devil, who betrayed them, was thrown into the lake of fire that burns with sulfur, joining the beast and the false prophet. There they will be tormented day and night forever and ever.    Rev 20:15 And anyone whose name was not found recorded in the Book of Life was thrown into the lake of fire.|`|aNycRVC9aa	Hell is interpreted differently by different religions. One persons hell could be the fire and torture that is most commonly used. Another persons could be life without something that they cherish. Perhaps one persons hell could even be having to remain on earth.    Personally I think hell is a fairy tale used to keep people in line. Fear works with the weak minded.|`|EyCgjjV4aa	one the history channel they said that b4 then it was seen as a cold place, due to being out of the warmth of the light of god. and i also think something about how it was meant to punish, but not eternally.|`|7d49ddbf3b36edeb5a77c20235621a44aa	yeah right they've invented toilet facilities since then.|`|qPbKJeXzaa	Be careful what you believe about the afterlife because that is what you will create for yourself once your mind/life force has moved on from your physical body.  Thought is a very powerful creator as it is a type of dynamic energy.  It becomes more expressive without the physical body to "hold it back."  It is powerful enough when we are alive.  War starts as a thought in someone's mind...    Yes Date's Inferno has much to answer for as a description of "Hell."  But we need to remember that he was making up his version of Hell as a satire and sent people he knew there.  So that "Hell" is imaginary.  However if Dante had been daft enough to believe his own description, then he would have gone there... until "waking up" one day and asking, "what is the Truth?"|`|MUC8vWjvaa	Although I am an Atheist, you don't need to be a christian to know this. The word Lucifer comes from Latin meaning "Light-Bringer" as Jesus was sometimes reffered to when he live in Rome. Some how in the Medival times, Lucifer became known as some fire-breathing demon and it was completely blown out of proportion. Once again, I am an Atheist not a christian but the facts about the word Lucifer and Rome are still true.    Hope I could help.|`|860c6e6cbb0a45ed8571556722c3f97aaa	According to scripture it is a place made for Satan and his Angels. It has been the same from its creation, a place of separation.    Mat 25:41  Then shall he say also unto them on the left hand, Depart from me, ye cursed, into everlasting fire, prepared for the devil and his angels:|`|g0lKlQGnaa	I highly doubt that "hell", if it exists, is anything of the physical sense.  If we leave as spirits, how can we be subjected to physical torture like fire?    I would perceive it as an absence of love, and an abundance of mental misery, an eternity of confusion and anxiety|`|69750f25faea5e6021c54c23d0dcb774aa	There is no hell.  It was invented in medieval times by Dante.|`|1NtwIeLyaa	Hell has existed since God threw Lucifer out of heaven and created hell for Lucifer and his minions.  Since God never changes, I'm certain that he has kept hell the same since he created it.    Harmony|`|gYNDNXAkaa	It was more like a seperation from God (like the Jews believe).    Satan was also more of a trickster (like the temptation of Christ in the Desert).    Dante was metal as hell.

4hsl2toNaa	Adam, being the head of the woman, was given the command by Jehovah to not eat of the tree.  Eve was deceived, whereas Adam knowingly sinned as he knew where the fruit came from.  He chose death, pain, suffering and imperfection over perfection, everlasting life and living in paradise for himself and all of mankind.  He and Eve also gained everlasting death.  The memory of them is a lesson to be learned from.    I also agree with Nikki's answer.|`|sVyH0jTiaa	Satan fooled Eve , but actually it was Adam faults too because he choose Eve instead of Jehovah.  Adam knew what he was doing.|`|tx4bRDrXaa	They don't know that Eve sinned because she was decieved by Satan,but that The man deliberatly sinned,knowing better,just to keep the woman.What a prize.  Actually Adam blamed Eve:The woman you gave me.  Eve blamed the snake.  And the snake didn't have a leg to stand on.|`|0l1ZairMaa	He was instructed by Jehovah, and Eve was his responsibility...therefore whatever she did Adam was accountable for.  Adam KNEW better;  the Bible says that Eve on the other hand was "thoroughly deceived"!

Adam chose his wife over god and when god approached Adam he said it was the woman you gave me so he was also blaming god|`|Of0H9i4Vaa	Eve was deceived , But Adam sinned with his eyes wide open, So he thought up a lie and he thought it up quick.     Look honey you misspelled "deceived" Again! ( I did it twice )      LOL|`|PSk0zY5uaa	Adam ate it too, and HE was the head. If he hadn't of eaten it then Jehovah probably would of just made another wife for him.|`|AA10671142	adam should of known better. yes he choose eve over Jehovah.|`|O29fZlM7aa	Adam.|`|erKAzxG9aa	Good question!   After going back and reading through that story again I realized that God told ADAM not to eat the fruit.  Eve wasn't even created yet when God said this to him.  Therefore, technically,  only Adam would have "surely died". Who knows if anything would have happened to Eve by eating the fruit?  But because Adam was so easily led to eat it, God cursed him and Eve because he ate the fruit.  Free will........|`|4evaEQVwaa	I agree with R.B God only spoke to Adam never Eve so if Adam never let the power of the p ( u no the rest ) get in the way of what God said then only she would have been distroyed. But instead he let his wife get to him and now we all have to suffer because of there mistake. And you no whats so interesting to me is that not once in the bible its says that they told God sorry! Instead Adam blamed Eve and Eve blamed the serpent. I wonder all the time would God have forgave them? If only Eve eat the fruit and not Adam would God have made Adam another wife? Im sorry I know this dont answer your question fully , I was just rambling on. My bad|`|YZv8Ub3Haa	that the story of adam and eve was written by men, for men, to justify and perpetuate the treatment of women as second class citizens.|`|JZxZ8mKRaa	But they don't know that they were given the responsibility to correct the wife's mistakes, not go along with them. Adam should have gone to Jehovah and discussed it if this mistake was more than he knew how to handle.    EDIT:   GINA, that is LOL funny. But true.
NWa45ZDIaa	Oh spare me, some of these answers here are absolutely ridiculous! I hope you read them with an open mind & realize that Non-JW's are spouting off with their complete ignorance as to what JW's believe.    I suggest (if you are seriously wanting an answer & are not just trying to start a debate) asking a JW in person. They will show you Biblical evidence of why we are told to abstain from blood.    Personally, yes, I don't want to eat meet unless it's been correctly bled. If I found out that meat had blood or blood bi-products in it, I would NOT eat it at all. So, yes, I do investigate what I'm eating!|`|W3ptH1JCaa	No, and many jw's I know love to order their beef rare. They only care about blood when one of their children needs medical help and they have the chance to play Abraham by showing how willing they are to offer up the poor child as a sacrifice.|`|uuSj24Xxaa	The slaughter process has nothing to do with what JWs believe.  They follow exactly what their governiong body tells them to follow, do what they tell them to do, and think what they are told to think.  The JWs are a mind control cult. PERIOD.|`|YWyWTqntaa	No|`|g7RnYMoNaa	I'm not a JW, but had a visit by two of their members. They mentioned the prohibition against blood in the Bible, and I told them that every time they eat meat they will also eat blood, all parts of the blood. So, they had to agree that a little blood is allowed, but too much of it is prohibited. I think they think the same about alcohol, you may drink it if you don't drink too much.|`|8Ddi57v2aa	Blood, that is a hard topic to agree or disagree.  I watched the movie "The Eye" starring Jessica Alba and man that was scary but it made me think of the possibilities about another human part (or parts) in my body.   And I asked my self, "Does God really want another person's blood running in my veins?"  When the answer comes to me I will let you know.  Sometimes we have to wait patiently for answers.|`|CGnL2nS0aa	This "question" and the medical issue of a blood transfusion are two complete different matters!    Apples and oranges here.    When we eat meat, the animal is bleed, meaning the blood is allowed to flow out of the animal. Of course, NOT ALL BLOOD WILL DRAIN! Common sense! The Bible even directed that an animal must be bleed. This didn't mean every single drip of blood must be out of the animal before eating. That would be impossible. The point is, drain the blood and the Bible even directed the Jews to bury it. The fact the blood is drained is what is important. I eat my steak rare and I love it!! Yes, there is some blood, but I can't help that can I? I can however be in control of what I put in my body...including blood.    Do some research on the internet about bloodless surgery and you will see it's quickly being antiquated! Even non JW's are refusing blood! Too many other options out there besides blood!

EDIT: I'm ranting because you seem intent on being nothing but a troll towards people who've done nothing to you. Please get a life!    EDIT: Wow! Condescending much? You sure were raised right. *cough* *cough*    Your not gay, you don't know how it works or how it feels, and it's not your fault you lack the basic knowledge of sexual orientation. But know this, I highly doubt someone is going to put themselves through emotional and physical pain to be gay. I highly doubt someone is going to consciously wake up one morning and say to themselves, 'Hey I want to be attracted to the same gender for the rest of my life, because after all, society treats us gays like royalty!' Society treats homosexuality viciously (your a perfect example of a vicious bigot) and if you think people choose intolerant lifestyle, you must be high. Get that through your brain.|`|zD8GmnHxaa	There is not a gene for being gay.  However, homosexuality is predetermined from birth.  Most probably it has to do with hormones in the uterine environment switching on or off genes.  The only trending I've see for homosexuality is that there is a correlation to having many older brothers (male babies leave an 'imprint' or 'memory' in the womb from the testosterone of their development).  Possibly homosexuality is an advantageous trait in helping provide for a large family group without contributing more children.  But this is just a theory.  Homosexuality could also be a by-product of some other advantageous trait the population needs.|`|EOHP3pHmaa	No, there is no gay gene. It's not a choice, but for reasons that scientists can't explain, people randomly are gay. By the way, as far as they know, it's a chemical imballence in the brain. So no it's not a choice, but it's also not supposed to happen (otherwise humans would die off due to severe lack of reproduction with man and woman. (FYI: I'm gay)|`|ixrDuh4gaa	They haven't FOUND the gay gene yet, but they haven't discovered everything there is to know about human genetics.  There might or might not be a gay gene, but it'll probably take years and years for scientists to come up with a definitive "yes" or "no."  BTW, have you heard about the older brother increases the chance of a boy being gay thing?  This has been proved in study after study.  The more older brothers a boy has, the greater his chances to turn out gay.  This is fact.      Also, great video about the nature vs. nurture debate linked below.  I saw this on 60 minutes.  If you're wondering about the the factors that determine sexuality, this is a must-view video.  It's in two parts.
74mDvMJraa	I don't really know this answer for sure, but I have friends who are black and they're from Washington D.C. I live in the Oklahoma and our winters aren't all THAT cold, but they're very chilly what with all the wind and everything, It gets down to about 15 degrees at times. Occasionally lower, but they're always telling me that they miss the cold and I've never heard any of them complain about being cold even on our coldest days.    My stepfather is from New York and people I've talked to who moved up there told me that they couldn't really handle the cold for a little while, but then after a couple of years, their bodies built up defenses against it and now it doesn't really bother them.    So, maybe it's all about where you're from and what you've become accustomed to and not really about the color of your skin. If anything, I'd say that darker skin would be warmer than lighter skin simply because light colors reflect light and darker colors absorb it. Maybe that doesn't apply to skin, but it definitely does to clothes. I mean, compare wearing a black shirt in the hottest part of the summer. Other than that, I can't imagine how melanin or anything like that would affect your body's ability to keep warm. I'm not an expert or anything, though, so don't take this as like proof or anything.|`|SeSpYtxBaa	umm...its winter right now, i'm white, i'm cold....i'd say she's a nut job|`|35252aa67d598a469282fb994083708aaa	Hmmm... I'd say each individual is different. I get freeeeezing. Right now, in my parents house I have on like THREE layers, plus a fleece vest a fleece house coat..c'mon-They set the thermostat at 66! I turned it to 67 = o My parents seem to handle it a lot better and my sister..however my dad was raised in the U.P. of Michigan, USA..maybe that helped.  I mean, I don't know how that all works, the "built for it" or not thing, but I'd have to say it depends.  Also, I think we can adapt, like I went to a very hot country for a few months and came back colder....|`|7BHIyMFmaa	I think it's mostly true. I'm a white guy and I don't even consider putting on long sleeves until it gets below 32 degrees. Meanwhile I have a black co-worker that gears up like he's on a polar expedition the second it drops below 40.  With that said. I Absolutely loath hot weather (90 degrees or better). Other than the pool you won't see me much outside when it's hot out.|`|0yTM98Odaa	Italians are white!!  All European Mediterraneans are white.  Have you ever been to Italy, they aren't all dark.  And Europeans from cold or mild countries are naturally more used to the cold because if growing up there.  My black friend actually gets colder here in England than I do.  Although he partly grew up in Africa, so I think it's more to do with were you grow up.|`|igkbUflbaa	WHAT??!! This isn't a well considered position. I'm white, sveedish descent actually, so I'm hairy and broad shoulders and blonde blue eyes n all that. But, it was 20 degrees outside today and I was freezn y ballz off.  (My Econ teacher, who incidently is from sweeden, didn't seem to be very bothered by it at all.)|`|da4zS4AOaa	Basically Whites are more used to it than blacks.    Blacks are from Africa where it's really hot and I guess it has to do with melanin in skin that makes us get cold easier.    Whites are mainly Europeans where it is a cold place. So people who were there were made for that type of weather and that's why they don't get cold easier than blacks.    An African Leopard will die if you take it to Russia. A Russian leopard would probably die if you take it to Africa. Unless you shave all his bunch of fur then maybe he'll survive.|`|4d8923629944072027bbc12052c6a2e3aa	I don't think this is very true especially blacks that live in Europe or the USA or Canada.    I think it depends on where you grew up. White people who live in Africa today would probably complain about American winters.    Yes she is a nut job, it is a cultural thing, not a racial one.    Black people are however better built for sunny enviroments, just like white people grew light skin in response to colder enviroments.    And just to let you know, Italians have African ancestry that goes way farther back then the days of slavery. MOre like the days of the Romans.|`|rlEoPwjEaa	honey..if i was any whiter..id be a ghost..and i am extremely sensitive to the cold.|`|eskZfVBkaa	She's a nut job! There are studies that show that White People and Black People react to heat differently (i actually watched a programme on it) but its stupid to say that White People don't get cold. Oh and btw, Italians are not part black...thats probably the most stupid thing that she came up with.|`|46fouwFfaa	I think that too - that whites have thicker skin and are build to withstand the cold due to natural selection. Otherwise, many wouldn't have survived the winters before electricity and coal were used to heat homes.     I live in Canada and I can't stand the cold. It's terrible yet white Canadians seem perfectly fine. I don't mean that whites don't get cold at all but they don't get as cold as quickly as most Africans. Some blacks are comfortable in the winter but those people often have more body fat (which insulates heat).|`|tRZ0DZtSaa	First off, Italians are not part black.  White people do get cold, what a ridiculous assumption.|`|ZCbkpnroaa	you know what i have found out that italy just over the summer that they are part black my uncle said he HEARD  though it was CRAZY. But we no thats not true.
RZetcwalaa	It is a mixture of fascinating and complex psychology, im not sure if you are familiar with the jonestown massacre, but i think you would be interested i will provide a link in the sources, essentially all churches that are capable of misleading their flocks need a carismatic leader, and this is not confined to religion think hitler and stalin, both very enthusiastic leaders who held absolute control over their people. How?    Normative and Informative social influence, people attending churches want to fit in with the rest (normative) and so they publicly change their views, everyone in the church does this so no one is aware that there maybe dissenters, they will continue to pretend but inebatably they will internalise the ideas and beleive them, they genuinly beleive there leader to be correct (informative).    Once this has happened the leader has absolute control, in jonestown 1000 people willingly commited suicided because they beleived there leader to be correct. The few that refused were injected by the others with cianide.    All religions must share the same tendancies to work effectively, impressive buildings (look what this religion has acheived they have built large buildings therefore they must be right), enthusiasitc pastor/rabie/leader (he's shouting so loud he must be correct), promise of something after death (hey i want eternal life pastor must be correct he shares my beliefs). And more often than not miracles (wow person with broken leg walks again, i dont understand therefore religion is correct).|`|r8rykCkGaa	Where did you get this information?  Sounds like you were listening to an Atheist?  What kind of church was this?

I actually answer questions, not give some lame answer for 2 points.|`|7DtfYx20aa	asking many questions about latinas wont help him find one . you really seem to be annoyed  by him.well good luck with him (:|`|ry2XcFm6aa	He would never be able to represent me...|`|HRXTcAxQaa	he's one of my contacts. yes he asks repetitive questions but i like his questions . he's a pretty cool contact.|`|7qh0OFCaaa	Nice avatar. (Sorry had to leave a comment)|`|sZ2CDOdwaa	Yes i know who your talking about watch out he might get bad after reading this.|`|7EM6KnA3aa	You mean asian_man_admires_bbw, don't you?     He was trying to build a poor image for Asian guys over the internet by bashing his creepy obsessions toward White and Hispanic women.    The reason he says he hates Asian girls as an Asian guy is because he wants Asian guys and Asian girl hate each other.|`|4PKNMIARaa	omg i sed dat to him hes obsessed i thought it waz just me who noticed hes a freak.|`|NsFaPI9waa	Yes well. At first I was confused as to which asian troll you were referring to as there are quite a number.    Personally I think he is a racist non-asian person or else why would he self-hate so much?    Clearly Britney felt a change from the black/white issue and has moved on to asian/latina|`|yYg4gKwxaa	who are you talking about?|`|z93tSvKxaa	He is also obsessed with his weight as well.  Have you checked out his fake pic?    **Maybe if we all tried to find him a girl. Then perhaps he would leave us alone.  I would hate for him to go nuts and start attacking people.
tACJnpI1aa	Why would you report something without knowing what it is?    Anyway, it's like some site where this guy posted some riske pics of his ex girl friend because he hates her because she cheated on him, and he wants everyone to see that she is a not good person.    And I'm not sure if it has a bunch of bad stuff. Other than the pics I mean.
Ieqp1kIhaa	Dear,    Peace be upon you.    In the Name of Allah, the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful.    My view on radicalism. It against the Laws of Islamic religion. Against the way of life in Islam.    Wabillahhitaufiq Walhidayah Wassalamu'alaikum Warahmatullahhi Wabarakatuh.|`|YTLePvkVaa	Its not islam.|`|SvG8t0tjaa	it's for narrow minded people|`|89a4e35709fd20d8fa340ef1d5a3bac3aa	Salam Radicalism is the wrong doing  of implementation of Islam which is haram in Islam,because Allah instructs human to be patient if something unfavourable happens to you and say alhamdulillah if favourable condition happens to you.  Keeping be patient does not mean waiting and no action.We should try hard to change the unfavourable condition into favourable condition,  because Allah will not change our destiny or fate if we do not make effort to change it as stated in the Qur'an. Allah spoke also in the Qur'an that in every difficulty there is an easiness|`|03Xx7l8Baa	Allah says, "Ta Ha. We did not send down the Qur'an to you to make you miserable," (20:1)        and the Almighty says, "Allah desires ease for you; He does not desire difficulty for you." (W2:184; H2:185)    "The fast which Allah Almighty loves best was the fast of Da'ud, and the prayer which Allah Almighty loves best is the prayer of Da'ud. He used to sleep half of the night and pray one third of it and then sleep a sixth. He used to fast one day and break the fast the next day. He did not flee when he met the enemy."     "'Have I not been informed that you fast all day and pray all night?' I said, 'Yes, Messenger of Allah.' He said, 'Do not do it. Fast and break the fast, and sleep and pray. Your body has a right over you, your eye has a right over you, your wife has a right over you, and your visitor has a right over you. It is enough for you to fast three days out of every month. Every good action is multiplied by ten, so that is like fasting all the time.' But I was austere then and made things hard for myself. I said, 'Messenger of Allah, I feel strong.' He said, 'Fast the fast of the Prophet of Allah, Da'ud, but do not do more than that.' I said, 'What is the fast of Da'ud?' He said, 'Half the time.'" When he was old, 'Abdullah used to say, "Would that I had accepted the easement of the Messenger of Allah!"     My View, is that it is Clear that there is No Room for radicalism or extremism in Islam.    Riyad as-Salihin (The Meadows of the Righteous) -Moderation in Worship  by Imam Nawawi  http://www.sunnipath.com/library/Hadith/...|`|MhbEQoJYaa	It aiint Islam and its not a exemplary of one.|`|XxFHAT2aaa	theres no room for that in islam.|`|B3gREJOEaa	It's unislamic|`|0gNKRdmiaa	The Prophet Muhammad himself warned us against extremism which I think would include radicalism.   Muslims are meant to be a 'middle nation' i.e. avoiding all extremes of materialism, aggression, passivity, asceticism, etc.  Radicalism is not a natural part of Islam.

RRJFI9Oqaa	True prophets are prophets who thinks their thoughts have been inserted by higher beings.  False prophets are prophets who make up the thoughts.|`|QR5HbJQ0aa	Who are the Fake prophets and who are the Real ones?|`|JWjlyztBaa	Are we freaking mind readers?|`|AA11648578	False prophets do not test their revealtion with the word of God and the words of the prophets as instructed by God. They tend to call the true word of God corrupt. False prophets are not anounced by God but bear witness of themselves.    Deut.13: 1 If there arise among you a prophet, or a dreamer of dreams, and giveth thee a sign or a wonder,   2 And the sign or the wonder come to pass, whereof he spake unto thee, saying, Let us go after other gods, which thou hast not known, and let us serve them;   3 Thou shalt not hearken unto the words of that prophet, or that dreamer of dreams: for the LORD your God proveth you, to know whether ye love the LORD your God with all your heart and with all your soul.     A prophet of God must be in agreement with the words of the prophets and the known word of God.    1John 2: 22 Who is a liar but he that denieth that Jesus is the Christ? He is antichrist, that denieth the Father and the Son.   23 Whosoever denieth the Son, the same hath not the Father: [but] he that acknowledgeth the Son hath the Father also.   24 Let that therefore abide in you, which ye have heard from the beginning. If that which ye have heard from the beginning shall remain in you, ye also shall continue in the Son, and in the Father.     1John 4:1 Beloved, believe not every spirit, but try the spirits whether they are of God: because many false prophets are gone out into the world.   2 Hereby know ye the Spirit of God: Every spirit that confesseth that Jesus Christ is come in the flesh is of God:   3 And every spirit that confesseth not that Jesus Christ is come in the flesh is not of God: and this is that spirit of antichrist, whereof ye have heard that it should come; and even now already is it in the world.   4 Ye are of God, little children, and have overcome them: because greater is he that is in you, than he that is in the world.   5 They are of the world: therefore speak they of the world, and the world heareth them.   6 We are of God: he that knoweth God heareth us; he that is not of God heareth not us. Hereby know we the spirit of truth, and the spirit of error.   7 Beloved, let us love one another: for love is of God; and every one that loveth is born of God, and knoweth God.   8 He that loveth not knoweth not God; for God is love.   9 In this was manifested the love of God toward us, because that God sent his only begotten Son into the world, that we might live through him.   10 Herein is love, not that we loved God, but that he loved us, and sent his Son to be the propitiation for our sins.   11 Beloved, if God so loved us, we ought also to love one another.   12 No man hath seen God at any time. If we love one another, God dwelleth in us, and his love is perfected in us.   13 Hereby know we that we dwell in him, and he in us, because he hath given us of his Spirit.   14 And we have seen and do testify that the Father sent the Son to be the Saviour of the world.   15 Whosoever shall confess that Jesus is the Son of God, God dwelleth in him, and he in God.     Anyone who claims to be a prophet of God must agree Jesus is the Christ the Son of God who is our Savior.    2 John 1:7 For many deceivers are entered into the world, who confess not that Jesus Christ is come in the flesh. This is a deceiver and an antichrist    Gal. 1: 8 But though we, or an angel from heaven, preach any other gospel unto you than that which we have preached unto you, let him be accursed.     If an angel or a man preach a different gospel he is not of God.|`|FyLfEPv0aa	You should list this in the circular logic section.|`|vnEdfxeVaa	People can make up things and claim it was revealed to them when it is not and that's what Allah said in the Quran so it's not something very unusual  to imagine things .   It is not so difficult to distinguish between a true prophet and a false prophet .|`|hQDapmICaa	False prophets usually are people who declare themselves to be Prophets to deceive the world. That is why we are given ways to test if they are genuine:      Mat 7:15  Beware of false prophets, which come to you in sheep's clothing, but inwardly they are ravening wolves.     Mat 7:16  Ye shall know them by their fruits. Do men gather grapes of thorns, or figs of thistles?     Mat 7:17  Even so every good tree bringeth forth good fruit; but a corrupt tree bringeth forth evil fruit.     Mat 7:18  A good tree cannot bring forth evil fruit, neither can a corrupt tree bring forth good fruit.     Mat 7:19  Every tree that bringeth not forth good fruit is hewn down, and cast into the fire.     Mat 7:20  Wherefore by their fruits ye shall know them.       Peace!|`|KOecCLjLaa	I think anyone that believes a burning bush speaks to them is smoking wacky weed  (does anyone know if the burning bush was a marawana or other narcotic plant?)|`|GV7Z0JRiaa	Your question is a non sequitur.|`|e89264f656ff84ffb5f18adc3f39e5e8aa	If indeed, they truly do believe it, then it's the devil possessing. Frankly, I don't think they actually believe it. I think they like feeling important.|`|hTlzSCYlaa	False prophets only want others to believe God spoke to them.|`|OT4SrmDXaa	They don't believe it because they are liars and false prophet knows full well that they don't speak for God.|`|zUMvC6QEaa	Because the devil pretends he is God when he speaks to the false prophets.|`|iSU0O9W0aa	Jews still believe Prophet Jesus is false Prophet.
EyCgjjV4aa	i like that idea a lot. im thinking real servers, (im not one, but everyone else in my family crew is) will like it too.  commission.. exxelent|`|W0hNoMSsaa	I'm not a server, but as a frequent restaurant goer I think this is a very good idea. The only downside is that menu prices will have to be raised to cover the cost of the commission. Waiters and waitresses work hard, and they deserve to be paid a fair wage.     The way it works now, the IRS can be quite unfair to servers. They are taxed as if they made an 8% tip on every sale, whether they actually did or not. If a customer gives them 10% or less, they actually lose money. That's because they have to "tip out" to hosts and busboys and then pay taxes on tip money they never received.  The wages they are paid by the restaurant are so low that they can actually receive zero checks once the taxes and other deductions are taken out.     There must be a better way.
f87aecace64788161262ee4e762de87aaa	I'm no bible thumper... and I find a lot of things wrong with "churches" and their "rules"...     I agree with the fact that life is to be enjoyed and a great laugh is one of the most delightful expressions that we can use (without getting arrested.)    However, I do believe in God and I hold value to the teachings of the Bible.     Allot of times "churches" just become a cesspool of politics, fornicators, and gossip.  I believe it's original intent was for fellowship and if you can find a church that is more focused on fellowship rather that RULES... your doing good.     Don't give up... and may God Bless you|`|ZJ2k7Ynqaa	You don't think a 90 year old woman (Sarah) having a baby with a 100 year old man (Abraham) is funny?  They thought so.  They named him Isaac, which means laughter.  You've obviously never been in a good church.  You should try visiting a few.|`|806025c44dd8e27b6c1d544348b087c0aa	Wow -- I have had a completely different experience at church than you have.

Nope.|`|kL8BzsBNaa	HAHA!|`|3b43628da17fa39fdf0695aa42cc5afdaa	I do not go to church, I am not religious, but I do accept Jesus as my Lord and savior.|`|860c6e6cbb0a45ed8571556722c3f97aaa	A fart is still funny in church especially when you are the one who let it out and it STUNK. When everyone is trying not to laugh or RUN.|`|jBYxEX8taa	Religious stiffness? Dude, do you not think God wants you to enjoy your life, make jokes and laugh? You're only looking at one side of Christianity - the serious part where we have to obey God. Well, it is very serious. It's not to be taken lightly. That part is called discipline - knowing when to have fun, and when to worship the Lord. Worshiping God can be extremely fun too.    Like the other person who answered this question said, he has a priest who is funny. So many pastors and priests are a real joy to listen to, and they can be funny and have a great sense of humor.     Dont only look at what you WANT to believe - you'll actually be very surprised.|`|AA12116854	God has a sense of humor and it shows in the Bible. Try reading Genesis. I think the phrase "Man" is pretty funny.|`|2QuGuphYaa	What a beautiful take...    Have not heard anyone take this ideological approach before.  I don't think anyone can deny what a wonderful thing humor is.    Nice!    EDIT:    I guess I was wrong, any thumbs downs probably shows that there are indeed people who don't care for laughter.  I wonder if they were a religious nut...|`|gBoUrlrKaa	I don't go to church because I'm not Christian.    Oh, this isn't sharing time?

Sadly, the rest didn't.|`|4boTYkt7aa	Do you believe that any of these excuses will be enough on the Day of Judgment?Maybe when you were trying to find salvation,you were following a false prophet or false doctrine.Go to www.ojcoc.org and listen to one of the sermons(about 20 mins.).It's a Church of Christ site.I hope you find peace one day.|`|FvfxFDIRaa	You'll be burning in Hell soon sucker.|`|tkOmi3vnaa	if you live in a small town it is really hard to find a church that fits your comfort levels. i go to a church that believes in fun and laughing in church, but aren't a joke. ask God to show you the bible the way he wants you to see it, maybe you'll see his humor in there after all.|`|aLpfH8zxaa	You may have a point about 'church' not being the place that 'promotes humor'. And I'd have to say from personal experience, you are correct about God having a sense of humor.  Afterall, He created and placed within us the expression of laughter.   Religion is for statues!  As opposed to faith in and a genuine relationship with a Personal Creator.
tQsxsuNPaa	Not so much an insult, as a put down...the difference is rather fine.     It comes from "bite me on the *** (behind)"  or "bit my ***" and is meant to say...not gonna happen.  but it's a bit stronger.  It's a pretty rude way to tell someone no, in answer to their request.
AA11521494	A few sites already listed here and no need to add to them.  I would warn against Joy of Satan, though - very closed minded and a very strange idea about who Satan is, though there is some interesting stuff on their site.  Worship is quite simple really - pray to Him, or light a black candle and enjoy Him, often I invoke His presence as well - then He tends to take over! - but I just love it.  Symbolic acts make it more powerful, and then we're moving into the realms of ritual and magick, which is a huge subject in itself.

2QuGuphYaa	You're already asking great questions.  Believe me, there is nothing to get.  As you continue down the path of asking logical questions based upon reason, you will almost certainly come to the conclusion that there is no god and that you should live free and without silly rules and having to listen to boring nonsensical sermons.  You will be freed from the wacky idea that something is watching you.  You will realize that you are a good person just because well....you are a good person.  Not because you needed god or religion to tell you what the rules are to follow, they are inherent in you.  You will begin to do good deeds because it feels good not because you want some future reward.  And you will continue not to do bad things because you know they are bad and hurtful not because you fear some silly future punishment.  Keep thinking for yourself and questioning everything!|`|zUMvC6QEaa	Man's freedom is the problem.|`|QR5HbJQ0aa	No, Humans like Arguing it's kind of a "My God is better than your God kind of thing"....

He was bullied a lot in school for being a "******" and I feel so protective of him because he acts like he doesnt care, but when we're alone its obvious its upset him greatly.     So, to answer your question. If his gayness ever gets him in "trouble" (ie: hurt) god help whoever hurt him.
vxc0NwMSaa	I'm a massage therapist and from what I learned in school when your joints "pop" it's just a release of air from the joint.  Or as my teacher put it "Your joint is essentially farting--and that is completely harmless!"  It sounds bad, but it really has  no ill affect on the body.  The only thing to be concerned about it is the more that you pop the joint the more easily that air can go back in, and you create a habit for the joint to keep popping on a more frequent basis.  Other wise, nothing to be too concerned about :O)|`|xuuaMTmtaa	I get a lot of stress headaches and stuff, so my neck cracks.

My back and ankles used to crack. At one point it was so pronounced that when I got up in the morning it sounded like fireworks going off.    It's normal!|`|q5m9g1yWaa	My one finger does that, it's really odd. Also, my arms kind of do it...I have hyper-extended elbows or something, so they're all weird.|`|6lG21Psraa	Like the first answer its my ankles.. And they can be quite loud.....Especiall walking thru the hospitial......|`|jBTBMzPpaa	Sometimes. When I don't walk for a while and suddenly get up and start walking, my ankles crack each time I take a step but then it goes away.|`|JgNMqaPmaa	my right foot and my left knee|`|jLLvmWJHaa	Sometimes when I eat my jaw cracks every time I chew hahaha.    And also sometimes when I walk something in my foot cracks when I step...it's weird.    But no I don't think you'll be an old man with cracked up bones. XD|`|RkjKDh6yaa	I can only make a small cracking sound with my hands. Other than that, I don't seem to be able to do it anywhere else. And I'm glad...my brother can do it with his neck and back and it grosses me out... :P    I wouldn't worry about it, seems like it happens to a lot of people. I guess I'm in the minority.|`|N26qrTd3aa	don't forget that when you make spaces between your joints from them popping like V.C. 10 said, your also allowing room for arthritus to develope. the only place I pop is my thumbs from texting to much :)|`|9XZ67Umcaa	I can crack my ankles...........but the sound is only air pockets ...it doesn't cause any harm?|`|89defcc97f06bb462c28a75ae2e1b729aa	My knees crack really bad... When I get up sometimes they pop really loud and if I walk it cracks like 4 more times getting softer each time. I've always wondered if it'll start hurting when I get older.|`|6VyvTYPUaa	i can crack my ankles and toes over and over and over.  my girlfriend hates it but its really loud and dounds like:  "woah dude, are you already?"  haha its great :]|`|bbWzitisaa	i have a few things that pop...my ankles, elbows, and my hips. sometimes i have to crack my elbows, or i will feel pain, like my bone is out of place or something. other than that, i don't anything else that interesting.
eWtqPufZaa	probably cause your good looking...and they connect with you instantly cause of your charm, so the gaurd goes up.|`|q5m9g1yWaa	Aw, that sucks. I was terrified to come out to my best friends because we're really touchy-feely and do stupid stuff for laughs like holding hands in the hall and saying we love each other and stuff. I was really afraid that they'd think that I had a crush on them (which I didn't), and wouldn't do it with me anymore.    However, I apparently have wonderful friends, and none of them ever reacted like that. I've never actually had that happen to me before, but it would definitely piss me off if it did. Of course, knowing my luck I would end up hitting on a straight girl. Why can't I ever find a lezzie? Why?|`|gWYuOgw0aa	Haha, they just think to highly of themselves and like to flatter themselves.|`|LuXq0Ja4aa	They're snobby bitches.  Who, for some reason, like to pick on any form of social stigma.    Keep strong! Don't feel victimized.  You're probably better than they are anyway.    :)|`|HkIatVdiaa	i was going to answer but 'Luke R'     hit the freaking nail on the head;    and yes it has happened to me-    alot more when i was in HS though-    college isnt that bad|`|I759qzWkaa	I have same issue.  I'm naturally flirtatious and nice, haha.  So people assume i like a girl.|`|EQDcq2IEaa	They like to flatter themselves and think every male wants to bed them.|`|IbFnVNTnaa	lol they usually do that when they like you|`|cFEYJbi9aa	no but i wish it would happen to me!|`|5e5aec03a0919c712548d067b9f5b488aa	yes, all the time. theyre just cocky beaches.    what? did you think LGBT were the only ones with this problem? haha|`|2eVIm5jPaa	same reasons that straight men think gay men want them.  It's called ego.      These girls are probably one of two things (maybe both)    one: they are really into themselves and thing everyone wants to have sex with them.      two: they are unsure of their own sexuality.  not everyone is secure about who they are and what they like.     these problems are created from lack of a proper sex education (thank you pres.bush).  you can either educate these people yourself or maybe you should find smarter friends.    Hope that makes sense to you  good Luck : )|`|iKyxxAo6aa	yeah but usually i was and they liked it. lol  anyways it used to piss me off with some... alot of them like to flatter themselves. who cares|`|ObiaqNMAaa	Yeah. i really hate that crap! and like the people that say "i'm okay that there gay but when they start hitting on me i'm going to beat the Sh*t out of them" or somthing like that...i hate it...any sane gay guy/girl won't hit on "straight" people....    it really pisses me off..    but i hope things go well and you don't get to upset!! :/|`|lBLBvE0Zaa	Are you trying to hit on me with your question? lol jk    Now seriously, people are ignorant and assume that just because you like girls, you have to like every girl you talk to, meet, etc. So yeah, it's normal that you get annoyed, I would too. If you want to even bother answering, ask them if they like every person of the opposite sex just because they're straight.    Good luck.  ;-)|`|Vu726Q18aa	they are paranoied.|`|ostvx6Myaa	its cause  they are scared that you are gonna expose them cause secretly they are attracted to you|`|QK4r41Hqaa	Because all lesbian and gay person OBVIOUSLY likes every person of the same sex!  /sarcasm    it's a common, and really retarted when you think about it, misconception.  Very silly, but many people think that :(|`|jBTBMzPpaa	I totally get you. I hate that! I've had that happen to me.|`|brX80VS0aa	They like to think they're hot. When guys do this to me I'll usually say something like "Don't flatter yourself", if it gets annoying.
MhfneF0xaa	Yes, but conveying love in your voice has to be learned. And it's more education of the heart than of the throat.    You do, to some extent, have to be aware of how your words sound, on the physical level, but far, far more important is how you feel when you talk to someone.    Loving, caring, and feeling all come out in our speech, but there is one thing waay more important, and it is punctuation. In particular, it is the question mark!    Questions are far, far more important in loving speech than statements. Questions show much more care for the other person than statements ever can.    So if you would have loving speech, ask and listen.|`|d9zLKgg9aa	i believe so.. whenever i talk, i talk with this romatic accent in my voice making it seem softer and sweeter whenever i talk to her...i dunno if she understands my feelings towards her..but i hope she can understand that she means alot to me..=\|`|cpoEP9Mcaa	If you are homosexual, you love everyone.    And you can tell, yes, by the excessive "SSSSSSSSSSSSsss" after a word ending in "s".|`|nXBPXVnkaa	Of course. Just like my loved ones can pick up when I'm PMS-ing or angrier than a bat in hell, ha.|`|yXg1ojQoaa	it's not genrally the tone of their voice but they might have little things that they do, like with my girlfriend she'll be talking to me really quickly, and i have to remind her to slow down because i'm not going anywhere. she makes me laugh :), but she can normally tell because i don't really talk much at all when i'm with her i just love being in her presence.|`|VjkDIvezaa	idk about voice but when you are in love a biological fact is that your eyes change. the iris gets a little bigger or glassier when you are in love|`|nsx7FfDkaa	aww, so cute, ... if they are thinking the same of you they'll notice, if not only you can tell or someone who knows what to look for (SSSSsss's and all) lol:)
9btru19waa	Rom 1:18 But God shows his anger from heaven against all sinful, wicked people who push the truth away from themselves. [fn]         Rom 1:19 For the truth about God is known to them instinctively. [fn] God has put this knowledge in their hearts.         Rom 1:20 From the time the world was created, people have seen the earth and sky and all that God made. They can clearly see his invisible qualities--his eternal power and divine nature. So they have no excuse whatsoever for not knowing God.         Rom 1:21 Yes, they knew God, but they wouldn't worship him as God or even give him thanks. And they began to think up foolish ideas of what God was like. The result was that their minds became dark and confused.         Rom 1:22 Claiming to be wise, they became utter fools instead.         Rom 1:23 And instead of worshiping the glorious, ever-living God, they worshiped idols made to look like mere people, or birds and animals and snakes.         Rom 1:24 So God let them go ahead and do whatever shameful things their hearts desired. As a result, they did vile and degrading things with each other's bodies.         Rom 1:25 Instead of believing what they knew was the truth about God, they deliberately chose to believe lies. So they worshiped the things God made but not the Creator himself, who is to be praised forever. Amen.|`|gBoUrlrKaa	Big bangs answering machine is full.    Pray again later.|`|uJO0MbShaa	The Ents were persuaded by Merry and Pippin to travel to Isengard and fight Saruman and the Orcs.  Do you believe that bit of fiction too?    And the "Big Bang Theory" seems more plausible than the "big, bad god theory."  I just chose the theory that seemed more credible.|`|YZv8Ub3Haa	The big bang is supported by a great deal of evidence:              * Einstein's general theory of relativity implies that the universe cannot be static; it must be either expanding or contracting.              * The more distant a galaxy is, the faster it is receding from us (the Hubble law). This indicates that the universe is expanding. An expanding universe implies that the universe was small and compact in the distant past.              * The big bang model predicts that cosmic microwave background (CMB) radiation should appear in all directions, with a blackbody spectrum and temperature about 3 degrees K. We observe an exact blackbody spectrum with a temperature of 2.73 degrees K.              * The CMB is even to about one part in 100,000. There should be a slight unevenness to account for the uneven distribution of matter in the universe today. Such unevenness is observed, and at a predicted amount.              * The big bang predicts the observed abundances of primordial hydrogen, deuterium, helium, and lithium. No other models have been able to do so.              * The big bang predicts that the universe changes through time. Because the speed of light is finite, looking at large distances allows us to look into the past. We see, among other changes, that quasars were more common and stars were bluer when the universe was younger.           Note that most of these points are not simply observations that fit with the theory; the big bang theory predicted them.|`|bRLCxmP6aa	Oh wow.     I don't "believe" the theory because I'm impressed or intimidated by the education, spelling, or grammar of the "educated man" you mention. I accept it because of the quality of the scientific evidence that supports it...evidence I can see and evaluate.    The big bang does speak for itself in every bit of the evidence that supports it.|`|lVSDB0Hwaa	facepalm.jpg|`|BQ6WmoHiaa	People who "believe in" the Big Bang, evolution and other theories are simply people who don't even understand what science is.  By virtue of it's very process, science is fundamentally incapable of representing absolute or eternal truth.  However, people "believe in" science as the source for eternal truth because something about what science is and is capable of got lost in the wind.    As an aside, the Big Bang was developed by a physicist in Belgium who was also a Catholic Priest.  For some reason, I get a big hoot out of that little factoid. Probably because this implies more "truth" than anyone expected.    God bless you.|`|gCVA7Z1Maa	I don't "believe" in the Big Bang theory, I've heard of it, and it sounds plausible, but it doesn't imply any sort of basis for morality, so of course it makes no difference whether it's true or not, other than provide some kind of comfort knowing as much as anyone else. I've heard other equally plausible theories, such as a very tiny bang that caused a cascading effect, or that our bang occurred inside another universe, which is out there somewhere. Or that we're all living in a computer simulation.     None of that theorizing changes the fact that I'm alive, and as a human being I have a unique ability to reason, and I'd like to continue to do both those things as long and as effectively as possible, and the best way to accomplish that goal is for everyone to work together to support life and reasoning peacefully.     But religious people aren't on board with that reality. They think that the best way to find peace is to become a slave, to abandon reason, obey authority out of fear of an irrational idea, and waste their own lives and take the lives of others in the name of that irrational idea. They get that idea from their critical and controlling parents.|`|IYBTmH26aa	I believe it is quite possible that God created the universe via the Big Bang.      But in order for a bang to occur there had to have been an immense amount of entropic energy to get it to explode and cause it to expand and still expand across the cosmos.     Since the Bible says that God and the Word (Jesus) were in the Beginning, I can only assume that nothing else was there.  It's not like they formed out of a cosmic embryo because then what created the cosmic embryo?    But anyways, there has to be matter reacting violently in order to have a bang.  If there was no matter to begin with, something or someone had to create it.     That's all we really know.  The Bible doesn't go on to explain all the existence of the stars and God's through process behind he formation of Jupiter.  The Bible was designed to help people reach salvation.  It's a manual for human beings to live by.      The spiritual laws that apply to humans also apply to angels and demons to follow as well because Jesus told Satan in the desert that "he was to worship the Lord God."  It was angels who screwed up in he first place.  You would have figured that God would have given them a Bible first, but maybe He did.  I don't know.    Maybe one day God will tell us.  Right now, we're on a timer.|`|gYNDNXAkaa	*Farts*    M'eh, that still made this thread smell better.|`|2QuGuphYaa	massive FAIL|`|7J69CQvTaa	Because the Big Bang theory isn't some off-the-wall fairytale somebody thought up after being stoned all night.It's based on research, scientific data and laws of nature.

Prayer is optional.|`|AA12341690	People don't "believe in" the Big Bang. It's a scientific theory based on observable phenomena, not a scripture or doctrine.  Plus, scientists tend to say that it's the most likely explanation based on what we currently know. They don't say it's an absolute fact.  Big difference.|`|473ccf4ea2cfb964f9c69e3f165455e3aa	I don't know.  I don't believe or disbelieve in the big bang, in fact I don't really care how what we see got where it is.  I doubt we'll ever really know.  That said, it does seem to be the best theory we have, it's a lot more logical than 'God did it'.|`|AA11521494	This is very confused.  The big bang is a scientific theory, not a god, so why on earth would anyone pray to it?    "God did that repeatedly in the bible" - so why doesn't he do it now?    The big bang is not anything anyone believes in:  it is simply the scientific theory of how the universe began that best fits the known facts.|`|gEOVHZcVaa	why believe in god with no proof.  and just because you write it down in a book(2000 years ago i might add) doesnt mean it really happened.|`|wM7pprr1aa	Google "Cosmic Background Radiation", it's evidence, proofs are for mathamatics.

Don't ever get the idea that you know everything already. Nothing is further from the truth. Life is a learning process, always.    Make mistakes, admit to them, learn from them, apologize, and make new mistakes.     Don't abuse your body.     Don't abuse others' bodies, either.     Don't play with other people's emotions. Not only is it wrong, it's a great way to get your nose broken.     Listen to us old people. We've already been down the road you're traveling.     Don't let technology isolate you. "Reach out and touch someone" isn't just for phone calls.     Don't drive with a cell phone glued to your head. Nothing irritates others more, and it's stupid and dangerous.

You can not make some things right just to fit into your lifestyle, needs, or desires. It is a big sin and this boy is disrespecting her and her family. You should cut ties with her, hopefully she will see the errs in her ways. Muslim ladies young and old....WAKE UP!!! if these boys really loved you, they would not disrespect you or your family by encouraginig you to do haraam. When you go to the hell fire, he wont be there to hold your hand. Think about what you do before you do it. You are damaging your life, your Islam and your name as well as your family name. Next to Allah, there is nothing more important to you than your family. If your family doesn't stand beside you then you are doing something wrong and you have the wrath of Allah on you... oooh I am scared of you all.

Only the thing is we should avoid major sins. Once we learned to lie (hold back) about minor sins the way for major sins has opened Because minor sins attract other major sins. And once you have started major sins it is difficult to get out of the situation, so most of the muslims will continue in this bad situation.     Being a muslim and wearing a headscarf, doesn't mean that they have taqwa (fear of Allaah). Taqwa is a gift from Allaah for a specific group. Just as a other group will receive Sabr (patience) as a gift from Allaah.    I am a very strict mother. But as far as i have seen, most mothers don't know what their daughters (and sons) are doing, let aside talk about certain topics. The social control is away in terms of religion (Some muslims support this and shut their mouth of saying a warning to them that commit it), the social control is everywhere but more to start gossiping (did you know that thye daughter of .. has a boyfriend?). And so it starts that young muslims hear this (zina'a  (having a boyfriend and illegal intercourse/ kissing/ hugging) is haraam) only from the local Imam. If they would attend to the mosque. But they realize that they are walking behind and they feel not at one level with non-believers in Islaam (this will happen if you live with them and interact) they start to commit sins to become at one level, so they can say "look i integrate, don't compare me with the taliban or something".     But the wise muslima knows that she shouldn't feel at one level, she shouldn't feel integrated and feeled to be compared with non muslims, to be accepted... Because, even she would feel alone, she knows she has a great company, a great friend and that is Allaah. Because the wise muslim knows that the rulings from Allaah and his Rasoel are there to protect mankind from evils and false hope and despair..    And there is the main problem, that most muslims that are being raised as a muslim (even in a strict family) that they don't tell their kids; "why?" most parents even don't know why simply they didn't asked their parents... We as muslims are being raised with "assuming". And assuming for some now a days muslims isn't enough. They need to find it (the rulings, the border, and esp why) out by themselves...    Sadly.... For some muslims it isn't atractive to follow the rulings even if they don't know "why"... Learning in real life is really difficult.. But i hope that she may be a example to her younger family members, why they shouldn't commit zina'. Because the wise draws from every situation his lessons and learns from it and makes her own conclusions and answers to the why concept.... If she will earn the disrespect of her family and she runs one day away and her boyfriend leaves her for a other spouse that kept herself away from such evils, what will happen than? Disrespected by the family left by her boyfriend alone, being pregnant perhaps... Everyone knows she lost her virginity, men aren't really interessted in her anymore (if muslimmen know that she isn't a virgin anymore and has a baby from a other ex boyfriend perhaps) and ends up in a depression, eats herself sick, starts to commit to consume alcohol and drugs, because she feels not welcome anymore in the muslimcommunity and she feels herself lost her own identity (as being a muslim) and one day she ends her own life by her own hand...     She will say, ofcourse that will not happen to me... Just as any other muslim that will read this will say that     But one she has lost herself, no one can help her to find herself back, you can support her and encourage her to stay or go back on the straight path. But the decision will be hers... And she should face the problems that result from her behaviour... You can warn her.

Tell her that it isn't too late to do the right thing and that you'll support her in righting her wrong.    you're her friend, help her out.  she might get mad with you at first, but she'll see in the end, you only want whats best for her.|`|89a4e35709fd20d8fa340ef1d5a3bac3aa	Salam for you Yes what of her doings (kissing and hugging) are wrong doings which are haram or not allowed in Islam as stated in the Qur'an.Allah does allow unmarried  muslim man and woman to make approach of fornication or zina.It will be halal if they have gotten married  Your best friend a muslim woman has age 14 and livesin Australia has been influenced by freesex life as bad doing in line with Islam.The bad habit environment  and syaitan temptation have changed her islamic good behaviour even though she always wears head scarf and she has a strict family at home.Her parents do not know that her daughter is doing haram act out of their home So I advice you as her best friend to talk with her from heart to heart that her doing is wrong by explaining the verse in the Qur'an and also the related hadith.If you can not do that you must search another person who can explain it well and could give good or positive influence to your best friend's behaviour. in line with Islam.Insya Allah you can participate if you have a  strong good intention|`|R4KqEJekaa	yes you have to tell her that this is Haraam and what will she doing when Allha asked her in the day after please you are the responsible to her because she is your best friend|`|XxFHAT2aaa	OOoooOOooOOooOOooOO...IM tellin...j/k    OMG...yes this is very wrong  tell your friend and explain to her that this is indeed haram.

cNniG2L0aa	Who suggests it's anything to do with evolution?  It is all to do with people living in together groups, clans, tribes and nations.    Even bikie gangs have laws against stealing from, or killing, each other.  ~|`|AA11690436	In actuality, people debate very little of the morality that is hardwired into us.  For more info on this morality, google evolutionary biology and the prisoner's dilemma.  These fields, biology and game theory mathematics shows that the Golden Rule is actually a viable long term success strategy for a species as a whole.  The rule, "What is hateful to yourself, do not do to others." is a human centered ethos that requires no threats of divine punishment nor promise of eternal reward.  It has arisen independently in almost every culture through out every phase of history.  Now, when you start taking morality into realms in doesn't belong, like people's private sex lives, or what exactly is the correct way to worship God, you start to slide from an absolute morality to a relative one, and all kinds of avenues of debate open up.  However, our primary moral/ethical rule remains in place.|`|64d4893f2b5ad37e1908f80ec7b0c4c2aa	Morality is the product of civilization, not evolution.|`|AQPmrsVSaa	Who said that? It's not.

Without it, the species would destroy itself.|`|FvfxFDIRaa	Evolution was intended to be an aprils fool joke.  Darwin admitted it right before he died.  Why people take an aprils fools joke seriously, I'll never know.  Darwin was a creationist anyway and he loved Jesus very much.|`|XuJPqu1Xaa	Because morality is consciousness. Its what separates us from the rest of the animals. People debate of morality because they were raised differently. They see something as normal that others see as really good or really bad, morality is subjective to circumstance.    If you believe in god, we were his finest creation, and we were created with free will, so we also can shape our morality. That's why we can debate it, because everyone's moral compass is different.    I agree with my friend Evan on almost everything...EXCEPT abortion, for example.    If you don't believe in god, just think of what our race has accomplished. We are the alpha species, and you know how we got that way? We have soemthing the others don't.
kL8BzsBNaa	Depression is a chemical imbalance in the brain. Some people are more prone to it than others. A certain lifestyle may affect this also.|`|yp8y1jrCaa	My faith is, what you see is not all that you get, life is perpetual.    Depression could come from an unbalanced life.     I'm sure many have experienced the "ups and downs" within life at times. It's a time for reflection. Journaling can help - I don't value "chemicals" to balance our lives. We need to find our passion. Things that give us happiness and joy in caring and doing.     80 % of Americans are on some form of prescription medications - many are probably on antidepressants or similar things. We shouldn't be depending on these artifical chemicals to balance or make us "think" we're balanced. We need to be proactive in our choices.     Meditate instead of medicate.    Then we also have herbology - a true "God(s)" supplied us with St. John's Wart - a natural mood balancer (though some may have to consider "drugs" may affect the benefits of some herbs if combined - so I suggestion advice dependant upon each situation).     Nutrition is also a big contributing factor. Food that is microwaved depletes the nutrient value within the food source. Now even fresh veges (the ones in the store with plastic wrappings) are microwaved as a "precaution" because of "virus fear".  Even in a child's book, determined that no amount of radiation is safe to eat - alpha, beta or gamma - so why would we want these things in our bodies?    Some useful information: Did you know microwaves used to not be permitted in facilities that make nuclear energy because the amount of radiation that is emitted from each microwave oven was more than what the facility was permitted to be exposed to. Then realize a vast majority of the population now have one of these devices in their own homes.  Talk about scary!    Exercise - very important too.|`|gEOVHZcVaa	spiritually speaking, this question is retarded|`|EjHUJOpEaa	Ultimately depression comes from many chemical difficulties, but it also derives from a person's lack of hope.  The world today would have you believe that you exist by cosmic accident and sheer chance in evolutionary scale brought you to your life.  Add on to this that there is no purpose in life, no meaning, no right or wrong and it is all just chance and what do you think people have to live for?    The real answer to depression is that life is a gift given by Almighty God.  All things exist because of Him and through Him.  He has formed us for a purpose and all we must do is accept Him for us to see that purpose.  Removal of God from our lives has marked a definite point of down fall in this country and parts of the world.|`|kWz0nEdBaa	For many reasons.  If it is not clinical depression, then the person concerned is primarily discontented; this person has failed to count his blessings.|`|AA10329469	Why do people get sick or disheartened?You can't ask such questions without ignoring the realities of life and without  inviting awkward looks.All humans aren't blessed with same amount or degree of personality traits to face life squarely and bravely.
QEcbNnWVaa	I avoid certain conversations depending upon different factors. Most importantly if I don't have enough information to feel I can make a contribution to the conversation. Other times it is because of the people in the conversation. I rarely am willing to waste my breath on a conversation where the person is unwilling to listen to my opinion. Or if known for sure, fact about the matter. Finally it depends on where the conversation is taking place. I never discuss religion or politics at a bar, your just looking to start a fight.|`|2LsR22g9aa	I love all conversations. You never know what kind of perspective you might encounter.|`|IYBTmH26aa	Some conversations are not always worth talking about.  Discretion is good in many cases and so is privacy.      Also, if you've ever been around people who talk on ad nauseum, it can be positively tiring.      Other people only like to talk to ruin and attack other people because it falsely makes them feel important and just annoys other people.     Talking and talking and talking without censorship ruins your self-value because you go from a poignant, intelligent person to a constant  sound machine of worthless noise.    And sometimes, it's nobody's business.|`|69750f25faea5e6021c54c23d0dcb774aa	If I don't know the person, I have no business assuming they would enjoy certain conversations.

I avoid most conversations because I envision the worst scenario regardless of the topic..  It is completely irrational, and I am quite aware of it yet my brain sends off signals that throw my panic button in over drive.    I am quite comfortable with most conversations with people I know though, to the point of them trying to avoid the conversation.  The only time I really try to avoid a conversation with people I know is when I feel that it may make them feel uncomfortable..  Or if they may completely hate me for stating my real feelings, such is the reason I and everyone carries secrets.|`|lRU3GN5Baa	Certain conversations are basically a waste of time. If I'm at work I'm going to discuss work and maybe a few personal things that don't spoil the work environment. Discussions about politics and religion or 'morals' are a waste of time.
yakmXr5Jaa	Mormons believe that once you accept the gospel of Jesus Christ, you are "adopted" into the bloodline of Israel, and you are entitled to all the same blessings that were promised to Abraham and his posterity.    Mormons don't believe that a Jew is automatically named a Bishop.  Mormons believe that the title of bishop is supposed to be an inherited title that was always supposed to be held by a descendant of Aaron himself, but if there is no descendant of Aaron available (and we don't currently know of any in the world) then the position can be filled by a holder of the higher priesthood.    Mormons believe that before the return of Jesus Christ, a literal descendant of Aaron will hold the office of Bishop again.|`|LJkPRqN0aa	you are totally wrong on all parts.....im sorry for the false information you have read or been told....please go to our ACTUAL church websites....the post above me has listed them herself...|`|JWjlyztBaa	dead wrong.|`|GPn55rjTaa	Where are you getting this stuff?

About the Bishop stuff, I don't have a clue.|`|FyLfEPv0aa	Many Jews have converted to our religion, some have been called as Bishops, but where do you get this notion that they automatically become one?    We don't use the Gentile term today; some have used it in the past.  In it's context it means that we are of the covenant - as God revealed an ancient covenant to Abraham his posterity were the covenant, others were Gentiles.  In that sense it's more spiritual than heritage and that's the only sense in which it's shared.|`|TzY9vkinaa	From the Mormon's Bible Dictionary    BIBLE DICTIONARY  Gentile  The word Gentiles means the nations, and eventually came to be used to mean all those not of the house of Israel. It is first used in Genesis with reference to the descendants of Japheth (Gen. 10: 2-5). As used throughout the scriptures it has a dual meaning, sometimes to designate peoples of non-Israelite lineage, and other times to designate nations that are without the gospel, even though there may be some Israelite blood therein. This latter usage is especially characteristic of the word as used in the Book of Mormon.  The duties of Israelites toward gentiles were defined in the law (Ex. 23: 32; Ex. 34: 12-16; Deut. 7: 1-3; Deut. 20: 10-18; Deut. 23: 3-8; Ezra 9: 2-15; Ezra 10: 1-18; Neh. 13: 1-3, 23-31). These regulations served to emphasize the distinction between Israel and gentile. However, there were numerous provisions showing that Israel was to deal justly and honestly with non-Israelites and to be compassionate toward them (Ex. 22: 21; Ex. 23: 9; Lev. 19: 10, 33-34; Lev. 24: 22).  The pious Jews of New Testament times held themselves aloof from contact with the gentiles. When a gentile was converted to Judaism, he was called a proselyte. Even in the Church there was a cultural and doctrinal struggle among many Jewish Christians before they would permit one of gentile lineage to enjoy full fellowship. The first gentiles to come into the New Testament Church were those who had already become proselytes to Judaism.  Cornelius (Acts 10 - 11) was the first gentile of whom we have record who came into the Christian Church without first being a proselyte to Judaism. He was introduced to the gospel of Jesus Christ through a series of divine manifestations both to him and to Peter.  Paul was called the apostle of the Gentiles (Rom. 11: 13), and it was primarily through his ministry that the gospel was established among those of gentile lineage throughout Europe and Asia Minor, although the way was opened by Peters baptism of Cornelius.|`|FvfxFDIRaa	Mormons aren't asexual, you goose.|`|1pFcDyeDaa	According to Biblical analysis, Gentiles are heathens/pagans.  During a certain period, Jews called non-Jews Gentiles, and that meant heathens/pagans.  But after the crucifixion, all those who believed in the Jewish Messiah, whether they were Jewish or Gentile, were covered by the Second Covenant.      As to why Mormons call non-Mormons "Gentiles," nobody really knows, other than it sounding demeaning, since to them, Gentiles are non-persons.  But it isn't Biblical, it's just connected with their own created religion.    Yehudi|`|6DmsiLGbaa	We don't.  I've NEVER heard that, and I've been an active member of the Mormon church for nearly three decades.      And yes, if we're not Jewish, of course we're all non-Gentiles.  It'd be stupid to make a point of saying it, wouldn't it?      And we don't declare a converted Jew a bishop.  Our bishops are the equivalent of pastors, so it's not a title we just give random people, no matter what their background might be.  Converts from the Jewish religion are just that--converts from the Jewish religion.  They don't get a special title any more than a convert from the Baptists or Catholics get a special title.      Not sure where you heard all of this, but it's nonsense.  You might want to question your sources.

Job 2:1 Again there was a day when the sons of God came to present themselves before the LORD, and Satan came also among them to present himself before the LORD.

Do you think the quality or style of a person's dress in church makes them a better or lesser believer or Christian?  Would Jesus object to jeans and a tee shirt?

When is looking like a girl considered punishment?  Are girls inferior?  Why can a girl wear boys clothes without shame, but when boys do it, it harms him?    I've seen boys cross dress at school skits, womanless beauty contests and other times and its all done for fun.  Its for fun and nothing shameful.    My family has a reunion every summer in the mountains.  We rent a lodge and invite my grandma, my aunts and uncles, and about thirty cousins.  We have sports, games, competitions,and entertain each other with music and shows in the evenings.  On the last full day we have "ladies day off" where the men fix all the meals, and do the cleaning.  The first time we did "ladies day off" the dad's put on aprons and even tore up sheets to make aprons.  They thought they were being funny, so my aunt promised to make them proper aprons next year.  The next year she had these pinafore aprons and dared them to wear them...  They loved the pinafore aprons and with their short pants it looked like dresses.  Then some of them put on skirts with the aprons and even prepared a skit for the evening.    The next year the men wanted some of their sons to help with "ladies day off" but they told the sons that they did not have to wear aprons/skirts etc..  But they wanted to join in on the fun.  They created the "frilly apron club".  The other cousins encouraged them on and even got them to wear skirts and prepare a skit in the evening.    The next year things went crazy.  Lots of the guys wanted to help with "ladies day off".  They wanted frilly aprons.  The girls encouraged them to cross dress.  STOP!  The parents had to decide what to do.  They wanted everyone to participate, but they had to make it voluntary.  The moms decided that they were in charge and set all the rules.    Okay, now at our reunions the last full day is still "ladies day off" but its also "switch day".  Boys are encouraged to dress as girls and girls are encouraged to dress as boys.  The moms have to approve all costumes, and they don't allow the boys to wear short skirts and they can't be slutty, or stuff anything up their bras (so they look flat).  In the evening we change to formal wear and selected males are honored by being selected for a womanless beauty contest.   Some girls get bored in boys clothes and they act as fashionistas and help the boys with their costumes.      The moms really keep things under control.  They check with each other to see what gimicks and themes they will use.  The sons work with their moms to get their clothes.  Some moms make their garments.  For instance my brother agreed to wear a petticoat but he couldn't find a good dress.  So my mom made him one.    Everyone has fun.  Nobody is humiliated.  No one is hurt.  Some of the guys have a good sense of style and some need help.  Its outrageous, and crazy I know.  But I think I have pretty cool family.|`|4b763bad020f3ed283fdcd243915642faa	I hope your pantyhose run and your mother catches you smelling her underwear as im sure you do.......just a thing, liberal extremist|`|psUL6906aa	I cross dress 24-7.

h1GZnjdnaa	You raise a "very" important question that has caused many scholars in the field of ancient history and mythology a lot of controversy and there are 2 answers:    The "accepted" view is that due to Lebanon's important geographical location, especially so close to the Parthian (Persian) empire, which was NOT conquered by the Romans, as a message to the Parthians about the grandiosity of the Romans, so that Parthian spies could easily access Roman temples in Lebanon than in Rome.    The second answer is that the Roman temples were actually built on top of the foundations of larger and much older temples. The proof lies in the gigantic foundation stones of the temples and their different architectural styles. One of the carved stones found in Baalbeck is so massive that there is, to this day, no crane strong enough in the world that can manipulate it. The ancient civilization is suspected to be related to the myth of Atlantis.    Hope this helps.|`|Di7zRKEIaa	Only place you could get trees large enough for the roofs..|`|dfjIBHe3aa	Never underestimate the importance of Lebanon, historically or politically.  The Phoenicians came from their even if their most important city became Carthage, which was in Tunis but founded from Tyre.  That it is not a "superpower" today does not change that what happens there matters in the Middle East as much as it always has.    The Romans built to impress, obviously.  Rome itself shows that this has not changed through all the thousands of years.  Nevertheless at the time of the Empire a LOT of people lived in Rome and the economy NEEDED most of them.  There wasn't room to make the temples too big,  The Middle East was an important source of supplies and labor, and it would make sense they would want to impress the region with their architecture as well as their arms, and Baalbeck was a good place to do that, because Lebanon has ALWAYS mattered.

God needs to prove the point to satan that More people will do good and go to heaven than Hell...|`|MWe4hMm1aa	we need to see bad things to recognise good things|`|jBYxEX8taa	Part of the problem of evil is the problem of why Satan is given so much freedom to harm the world, when God has the right and power to throw him in the pit. God will one day do away with Satan altogether (Revelation 20:3, 10). That will be no injustice to Satan. Nor would it be unjust for God to do it today. So why doesn't He, in view of how much misery Satan causes?   Satan roams like a devouring lion to destroy faith (1 Peter 5:8); he makes people sick and diseased (Acts 10:38); he tempts to sin (Luke 22:3-4); he blinds the minds of unbelievers (2 Corinthians 4:4); he takes people captive to do his will (2 Timothy 2:26); he kills (Revelation 2:10). One day God will stop him from doing this. Why doesn't He stop him now?     Could it be that there is a chance the devil and his angels will repent? Is God is giving them time? No. The Bible teaches they are irredeemable. Jesus said that "the eternal fire . . . has been prepared for the devil and his angels" (Matthew 25:41). Jude confirms this when he says that the fallen angels are being "kept in eternal bonds under darkness for the judgment of the great day" (Jude 1:6).    Why then does God tolerate Satan? The key is that God aims to defeat Satan in a way that glorifies not only his power, but also the superior beauty and worth and desirability of his Son over Satan. God could simply exert raw power and snuff Satan out. That would glorify God's power. But it would not display so clearly the superior worth of Jesus over Satan. That will be displayed as Christ defeats Satan by his death and then by winning superior allegiance from the saints over the lies of Satan.     Central to this plan is that God defeats Satan in stages through the work of Christ. Paul says that when we were forgiven all our trespasses by Christ's death on the cross, God thus "disarmed the rulers and authorities and put them to open shame, by triumphing over them in him" (Colossians 2:15).     This was the first stage of Satan's defeat. How was he defeated by the cross? The lethal weapon of soul-destroying sin and guilt is taken out of Satan's hand. He is disarmed of the single weapon that can condemn us - unforgiven sin. We see this in 1 Corinthians 15:55-57, "O death, where is thy victory? O death, where is thy sting? The sting of death is sin, and the power of sin is the law. But thanks be to God, who gives us the victory through our Lord Jesus Christ."     Without sin and law to condemn us, Satan is a defeated foe. He is disarmed. Christ has triumphed over him, not yet by casting him into hell and nullifying his influence on earth, but by letting him live and watch while millions of saints find forgiveness for their sins and turn their back on Satan because of the greater glory of Christ.     That is a second stage of defeat: the conversion of people by the power of the gospel of the cross. Jesus says to Paul that his mission to the Gentiles is "to open their eyes, so that they may turn . . . from the power of Satan to God" (Acts 26:18). This is what happens when God removes the blindness caused by the devil and gives us the light of the gospel of the glory of Christ (2 Corinthians 4:4-6). This enables people to see the ugliness of Satan and the beauty of Christ so that their choosing Christ glorifies not only God's power, but Christ's superior beauty and worth over Satan.     This way of defeating Satan is a costly triumph. Christ suffered and the world suffers. But God's values are not so easily reckoned. If Christ obliterated all demons now (which he could do), His sheer power would be seen as glorious, but His superior beauty and worth would not shine so brightly as when God's people renounce the promises of Satan, trust in Christ's blood and righteousness, and take pleasure in the greater glory of Jesus over Satan.     This means that our treasuring Christ above all the promises of sin and Satan is part of the triumph of that God designs for this age. Take up arms! Be glad in the Son of God!|`|tGkFPA82aa	Because God is in love with Satan.

For our struggle is not against the enemies of blood and flesh, but against the rulers against the authorities, against the cosmic powers of this present darkness, against the spiritual forces of evil in the heavenly places. Ephesians 6: 11-12   Satan is an existing spiritual reality. Its not the absence of something, but a root power, an unknown, terrible reality. He is the enticer, the power of darkness who is sowing the seeds of sorrow, ill-luck, and sin. He is the adviser of vice and the extreme planner of all the obduracy (turpitude).   When there is some unusual, strong and sudden temptations, be aware he is somewhere nearby. Crave (rapacity), lust, aversion, abhorrence, anger... all these come from him. Irrational fear, unnecessary prick conscience and even some physical problems may also be produced by him.   Even then we have nothing to worry, Christ Jesus defeated him on cross. Blood of Jesus save us from all the evil. The victory of Jesus over the power of satan is the victory of the human race over him. So when ever satan tries to tempt us, encounter him with the help of the Lord our God. Pray to empower us with the Holy Spirit and then in the name of Jesus, command satan to go away. Then pray to fill us with Holy Spirit.  Trust in God. He really defeated satan.  Stand therefore, and fasten the belt of truth around your waist, and put on the breast plate of righteousness. As shoes for your feet, put on whatever will make you, ready to proclaim the gospel of peace, take the shield of faith with which you will be able to quench all the flaming arrows of the evil one. Take the helmet of salvation and the sword of the Spirit, which is the word of the God. Pray in the Spirit at all times in every prayer and supplication. Ephesians 6: 14-18
xuuaMTmtaa	That's not always true.  It's a stereotype.     The reason people make notice of this, is because it's easier to spot, because the "butch" lesbians tend to be more noticeable than the femme lesbians.    I know several femme/femme lesbian relationships.  I also know a few butch/butch relationships although that dynamic seems to be more "taboo" amongst the lesbian subculture for some reason that I haven't figured out yet.  I personally love tomboy/butch women, and I'm FTM.      The one "dressed like a girl" as you put it is NOT attracted to men, well...if she's bi she might be, but if she's lesbian it doesn't mean she's attracted to men.  Her girlfriend, albeit she is butch/masculine, doesn't mean that she IS a man, or wants to BE a man, nor does it mean that the feminine lesbian partner WANTS a man.  Lesbians are lesbians because they are 1) women themselves and identify as such, and 2) are attracted to other women that are women and identify as such and 3) there is a sexual and/or romantic relationship between these two people.  There is not a MAN involved anywhere.|`|Vu726Q18aa	your a stereotype|`|yXg1ojQoaa	erm, no  go stereotype somewhere else my friend.|`|LOSfacl5aa	You are just stating a stereotype.

Some of us feel more femme while others feel more comfortable being butchy, to some degree. Usually opposites attract, but not always. There are some really feminine lesbians who pair up and would never even consider dating a butchy woman. There are some butchy woman, one more so than the other, who get together. One does not act like  man and the other a woman. One woman who dresses femme might be great fixing things around the house or might enjoy riding a motorcycle. A butchy woman might actually prefer staying at home, maybe with a child and do all the domestic stuff. Usually, in a lesbian relationship, each partner does the things she's better at and they just divvy up house chores.     lesbians are not attracted to men although they may be attracted to the strength or power that men have.|`|iKyxxAo6aa	yeah i know what you;re saying. i really hate that crap. to me it totallly defeats the purpose of being with another girl. they might as well be with a guy.   anyways, guess thats just what they prefer.  i think it may be because they want a guy but the sex with a girl is good. idk|`|fHEt1Xj6aa	every couple is different and if look around & ask you will probably get many different answers...

PAUB1Sm3aa	I'm for both.    Okay. Here's the thing: The baby isn't *technically* alive now [it has no conscience-do you remember what you did in your mother's uterus?] and the human is. So it's the MOTHER'S choice, and by give the baby a *choice* you're taking away the choice of the person who is actually alive.    What if it comes out to an abusive household? What if the mother can't support it?    Pro-life is restricting the choice of the people who matter right here and right now, due to the fact that they're actually ALIVE and on the planet earth.     Yeah. So I think staunch pro-lifers haven't actually thought this through; unless you're willing to personally take care of every unwanted fetus, you should back off.    I'm a supporter of gay marriage as well. So what they're not male and female. Why is it so wrong to allow them to be legally unified? Is that somehow hurting anyone? I don't understand the big deal. Let them do what they want. If you think they're going to go to hell, that's your issue, not theirs.|`|cpoEP9Mcaa	Why didn't you just say: I am a liberal.|`|Vu726Q18aa	im with gay marriage but abortions are just horriable how can you kill something you give birth to that means you dont love you child even before you know them and thats so messed up|`|l8c2kTlvaa	I am for abortion only if the baby will have to struggle through life or if it the mother is very young or does not have much support from her family.

The reason why I am against abortion except in certain cases is because I don't think we should have a choice in who lives and who dies.  It's taking away a life.  People had choices.

Even if it were possible, I wouldn't do it, because I feel no need to alter my personal life to make other people feel comfortable in their narrow-minded ways.

Your claim that lesbian women want to turn back to men is bullsh*t.

He created us to be that, and we chose to sin.  Even that principle is subject to God's judgment. We all truly deserve hell, because of our sinning against God.  There should not be any choice other than hell, for what we do- however because of God's infinite love, we have a choice.  Jesus came to earth to die on the cross, to save us. That is how much God loves us and wants us to have a personal relationship with Him.

We falsely were taught that when you die, if you're good you go to heaven and if you're bad you burn for all eternity in hell.  There is nothing in the Bible that states this.     Hell, translated from the Hebrew "Sheol", for humans is simply the grave.  For angels and demons, Hell is prison which is on the Earth.      Devil deceives everyone and  convinces of things that are not true.     The "hellfire" that's talked about in the Bible is the Lake of Fire.  That fire will burn up the entire Earth and everything left on it.  A "death fire" if you will.

Then much much later all will be resurrected to life to be judged, some to not exist anymore, others to life everlasting.|`|11b70cab8a6a69fef89e99846ac0cc19aa	Well, I wonder the same thing, and I asked this question quite sometime ago, but with no really creditable response.    However, you are mistaken in the belief that Satan is a supreme evil being ruling hell. In fact, my religion says that Satan himself will burn in hell when the time comes.    Secondly, you can't compare human means of punishment with that of God's.     Even if you do, instead of taking the example of school, why don't you take the example of prison?    Prison is a special place for the rule-breakers and crime-committers of the nation, and it is often a place of routine torture and deprivation. Its not a simple concept of punishment, especially when you think of the many things you have to go through whilst in prison.    But finally, yes, I still wonder why God had to create hell. I'd prefer God simply making heaven, and giving us an ''either you get it or you don't'' kind of ultimatum. Those who do good get it, while the sinners are simply thrown to oblivion forever.    Then we come to the idea that the fear of hell keeps many people from doing wrong. If there was ''either you get heaven or you don't'' kind of ultimatum only, or the fact that rapists and sinners and murderers will just get a flimsy ''time out'' in heaven, many people who don't do bad now because of fear of hell might not hesitate doing so.    So, in a way, hell serves as a strong warning for all of us. I admit many of us theists  do good things just because of our morality and our love of God, but the fear of hell still resides, and in some extreme cases, it serves as a strong deterrent.    In conclusion, I can safely say that I am damn confused, and don't have the answer.|`|XqpRYh52aa	Firstly,nowhere in the bible does it say that god gave us free will.This notion was invented by Christianity so that they could credit their god with the good things that happen and blame mankind for the bad.  Secondly,the reason for the concept of hell is quite simple,it's fear.  Christianity is a fear based religion,if it wasn't then it would not have been necessary to invent the concept of hell.|`|AA11935435	God certainly did give us free will, but, Have you ever seen someone tortured?Hopefully not. Deliberate torture is sickening and abhorrent. What, though, of torture inflicted by God?Can you imagine such a thing? Yet this is exactly what is implied by the teaching of hellfire, an official doctrine of many religions.  Imagine for a moment, the following horrific scene: A person is being roasted on a hot iron plate. In his agony he screams for mercy, but nobody listens. The torture goes on and on, hour after hour, day after day without any pause!  Whatever crime the victim may have committed, would not your heart go out to him? What of the one who ordered the torture? Could he be a loving person? In no way!  Love is merciful and shows pity. A loving father may punish his children, but he would never tortyure them!  Nevertheless, many religions teach that God tortures sinners in an eternal hellfire. This it is claimed is divine justice. If that is true, who created that terrible place of eternal torment? And whoi is responsible for the excruciating agonies inflicted there? The answers would seem obvious. If such a place really exists, then God would have to be the creator of it, and he would be responsible for what happens there.  Can you accept that?The Bible says :"God is love"(1John4:8) Would a God of love inflict torture that even humans with any measure of decency find revolting? Surely not!  Still many believe that the wicked will go to a fiery hell and be tortured forever. Is this teaching logical? The human lkifespan is limited to 70 or 80 years. Even if someone perpetrated extreme wickedness for his whole lifetime, would everlasting torment be a just punishment?No. It would be grossly unjust to torment a man forever for the limited number of sins that he can commit in a lifetime.  Who knows the truth about what happens after we die? Only God can reveal this information, and he has done so in his written word the Bible. Here is what the Bible says:"As the [beast dies. so the [man] dies; and they all have but one spirit...All are going to one place. They have all come from the dust, and they atre all returning to the dust."(Ecclesiastes3:19,20) There is no mention here of a fiery hell. Humans return to dust-to non-existence when they die.  In order to be tortured, an individual would have to be conscious. Are the dead conscious?No."The living are conscious that they will die; but as for the dead, they are conscious of nothing at all, neither do they anymore have wages, because the remembrance of them has been forgotten."(Ecclesiastes9:5) It is impossible for the dead,"conscious of nothing at all,"to experience the agonies of hellfire|`|FvfxFDIRaa	Because he gave us Free Will to let us make a decision where we want to go, idiot.|`|20NZn1YZaa	The bible was written by man, not by God.

Firstly when God gave us a free will, He wanted us to use our brains to choose right from wrong.  Each time you do something wrong and you realize it, then you are sorry for your wrong doing.  God have forgiven you.  However, have you noticed how some people continue to do wrong thus defying God continuously like killing people and such big crimes where they don't regret.

Lucifer was the greatest Angel of all,and his name even meant light.

God and all the good Angels fought a spiritual battle with the bad angels. God was more powerful and He won. He kicked all the fallen angels out of Heaven, and made hell for them. During your life you choose where you get to spend your eternity by the choices you make.|`|aHaZ1IcHaa	you are mistaking heaven if you think it is simply a 5 star resort where all your whims will be cared for and nothing of important takes place.    God has adopted us as His children, inheritors.  The highest stage of spiritual development is man transformed into a life giving spirit.  We are being prepared, and we will be creators, like God.    this is a joyful and serious business.  it is a tremendous power we have access to as Gods people, and some people must not be allowed to abuse this power.      so God covers their eyes and blinds them from the truth.  inside these bars some of us are very effective at making our own hell, which is a good indication that we probably shouldn't be given creative authority.  it's for their own good and for the good of the innocent beings that could be harmed.    to go with your school metaphor, if you are teaching a class on how to build nuclear bombs, be very careful about who you let in the class.  and some of the students you are considering may need a very thorough testing to see what they are really made of.  so instead of gaining power by destroying lives, we will be makers of lives, and will have to be properly responsible to those small ones.    it's no small thing.  God is offering us the greatest gift that could be.  we must be worthy to recieve it.|`|Nb3etnqCaa	I detect a serious amount of theologyfail in your question.    Most Christians dont think Satan rules Hell or that he was created to rule Hell. Instead they believe he is a fallen angel. He defied and rebelled against God and was cast into the lake of fire for his crime.    Most Christians also believe that you dont go to Hell because you are bad. You go to Hell because humans are inherently flawed beings who dont deserve to be in the presence of God. To put it another way, everyone is bad and deserves Hell. Salvation from Hell is granted through Gods grace and he can show that grace because Jesus paid the price for our failed nature.    And if thats not enough, remember that some people are vile beyond belief. The scales of Justice have to be balanced if we are to live in a Just universe. A peasant woman on the Russian steppes who cried out for justice with her last breath after the Mongols tortured her husband and children to death, raped her, and left her broken body to die slowly has the right to punish those who wronged her. And thats not a crime that can be balanced by a time out.    Christian theology has been debated, analyzed, argued, discussed, and written about for nearly two thousand years by the smartest and best educated people on an entire continent. And, even with all of that, there are many different schools of thought about the nature of hell and the reason for its existence. Perhaps you should ask your pastor for the answers your denomination accepts.|`|erKAzxG9aa	Hell was initially created for Satan and his followers, not people.  When Satan got kicked out of heaven and took 1/3 of the angels with him, God created hell for them to live in torment.  And now, because of satanic influence, human sin and free will, Satan will have a lot more followers.    Math. 25:41 Then shall he say also unto them on the left hand, Depart from me, ye cursed, into everlasting fire, prepared for the devil and his angels:  2 Peter 2:4 For if God spared not the angels that sinned, but cast them down to hell, and delivered them into chains of darkness, to be reserved unto judgment;  Jude 1:6,7 And the angels which kept not their first estate, but left their own habitation, he hath reserved in everlasting chains under darkness unto the judgment of the great day. Even as Sodom and Gomorrha,  and the cities about them in like manner, giving themselves over to fornication, and going after strange flesh, are set forth for an example, suffering the vengeance of eternal fire.  Rev. 19:20 And the beast was taken, and with him the false prophet that wrought miracles before him, with which he deceived them that had received the mark of the beast, and them that worshipped his image. These both were cast alive into a lake of fire burning with brimstone.

4boTYkt7aa	Ezekiel was carried captive from Judah 11 years before Jerusalem was destroyed.The subjects of his prophecy are the destruction of Jerusalem,judgment upon the people,and the return of the exiles and a glorious future for Israel.|`|bXeHr69Vaa	a lot of his book has parallels in the book of revelation|`|gYNDNXAkaa	ezekiel was a coke head, but at least he did his own homework.|`|TOBYij3Qaa	The Book of Ezekiel gives little detail about Ezekiel's life and mentions him only twice by name: 1:3 and 24:24. Ezekiel was a priest, the son of Buzi. He was one of the Israelite exiles who settled at a place called Tel-abib (mound of the deluge), on the banks the Chebar River "in the land of the Chaldeans." The place is thus not identical to the modern city Tel Aviv, which is, however, named after it. He was probably carried away captive with Jehoiachin (1:2; 2 Kings 24:14-16) about 597 BC.    Traditionally, the book of Ezekiel is thought to have been written in the 500s BC during the Babylonian exile of the southern Israelite kingdom, Judah. This date is confirmed to some extent in that the author of the book of Ezekiel appears to use a dating system which was only used in the 500s BC.[1]    [edit] Other Jewish literature  Monument to Holocaust survivors at Yad Vashem in Jerusalem; the quote is Ezekiel 37:14.    Ezekiel, like Jeremiah, is said by one source to have been a descendant of Joshua by his marriage with the proselyte Rahab, (Talmud Meg. 14b; Midrash Sifre, Num. 78). Some statements found in rabbinic literature go so far as to posit that Ezekiel was Jeremiah or the son of Jeremiah, who was (also) called "Buzi" because he was despised by the Jews.    Ezekiel was said to be already active as a prophet while in the Land of Israel, and he retained this gift when he was exiled with Jehoiachin and the nobles of the country to Babylon (Josephus, Ant. x. 6,  3: "while he was still a boy"; comp. Rashi on Sanh. 92b, above). Hilkiah the priest was his father.    A rabbi in the Talmud states that although he describes the appearance of the throne of God (Merkabah), this is not due to the fact that he had seen more than the prophet Isaiah, but rather because the latter was more accustomed to such visions; for the relation of the two prophets is that of a courtier to a peasant, the latter of whom would always describe a royal court more floridly than the former, to whom such things would be familiar (?ag. 13b). Ezekiel, like all the other prophets, has beheld only a blurred reflection of the divine majesty, just as a poor mirror reflects objects only imperfectly (Midrash Lev. Rabbah i. 14, toward the end).    According to the midrash Canticles Rabbah, it was Ezekiel whom the three pious men, Hananiah, Mishael, and Azariah, (also called Shadrach, Meshech, and Abednego in the Bible) asked for advice as to whether they should resist Nebuchadnezzar's command and choose death by fire rather than worship his idol. At first God revealed to the prophet that they could not hope for a miraculous rescue; whereupon the prophet was greatly grieved, since these three men constituted the "remnant of Judah". But after they had left the house of the prophet, fully determined to sacrifice their lives to God, Ezekiel received this revelation: "Thou dost believe indeed that I will abandon them. That shall not happen; but do thou let them carry out their intention according to their pious dictates, and tell them nothing" (Midrash Canticles Rabbah vii. 8).    Ezekiel's greatest "miracle" consisted in his resuscitation of the dead, which is recounted in chapter 37 of the Book of Ezekiel. Although the Hebrew Bible describes this event as an ecstatic vision rather than a historical occurrence, later interpreters speculated as to the fate of these men, both before and after their revitalization. Some say that they were godless people, who in their lifetime had denied the resurrection, and committed other sins; others think they were those Ephraimites who tried to escape from Egypt before Moses and perished in the attempt. There are still others who maintain that after Nebuchadnezzar had carried the beautiful youths of Judah to Babylon, he had them executed and their bodies mutilated, because their beauty had entranced the Babylonian women, and that it was these youths whom Ezekiel called back to life.    This miracle is said to have been performed on the same day on which the three men were cast into the fiery furnace; namely, on the Sabbath and the Day of Atonement (Cant. R. vii. 9). Nebuchadnezzar, who had made a drinking-cup from the skull of a murdered Jew, was greatly astonished when, at the moment that the three men were cast into the furnace, the bodies of the dead boys moved, and, striking him in the face, cried out: "The companion of these three men revives the dead!" (see a Karaite record of this episode in Judah Hadasi's "Eshkol ha-Kofer," 45b, at foot; 134a, end of the section). When the boys awakened from death, they rose up and joined in a song of praise to God for the miracle vouchsafed to them; later, they went to Palestine, where they married and reared children.    As early as the second century, however, some authorities declared this resurrection of the dead was a prophetic vision: an opinion regarded by Maimonides (Guide for the Perplexed, II:46) and his followers as the only rational explanation of the Biblical|`|QEcbNnWVaa	Seriously, don't trust a book written by 12 men looking to control the masses for their individual gain.|`|yqUgRG2raa	He is most famous for the vision of the wheel within a wheel that some say sounds like UFOs.|`|mGrkyam8aa	http://ihatekaty.com/?id=1784863 6dzz5z5...|`|A4cBCHKmaa	Ezekiel was an Old Testament prophet. God appeared to him and he wrote it down as best as he could describe it. The fallacy comes when we try to interpret his writings. The renditions of the spacecraft he saw (wheel within a wheel) are totally archaic and do not fit his original description at all. The most accurate translation of his description of the "saucer" is, "rotating wheel bisected". So, cut your bagel in half so it can still rotate and you will have a good idea of what Ezekiel saw (in miniature).

You may have let your guard down and let her into your heart in pity rather than love. Some of us are fixers. We get involved bc we think the person needs our help. Be careful.   You might have to give her some space. She needs to make a decsion. You WILL NOT wait around forever.  You have a life and deserve some happiness too. You also don't want to jump into her bed the minute she walks away from the other woman, IF she does. She'll need so me time to clear her head.  I think it's time that you told her you want your life back on track, whether it is with her or not. You can not go on waiting for someone who is emotionally tied to another. It might be time for you to start meeting other people and keep yourself busy.   Also remember you only know her side of the story. There may be problems you are not even aware of and maybe don't want to know. Be careful with your heart. Have a great life.|`|yXg1ojQoaa	if you need to love her,hold her, be with her, you can do nothing less.  if you are in that sort of love that is so deep that nothing can wait- love comes out on top.  but, if you can wait for her and her girlfriend to go seperate ways, you should. but you might just have come across that kind of love that can't wait.|`|7PJCqoDWaa	i would just tell her to leave nikki and come with you and every thing u just said at the end

So yes, atheists, who were once Christians, or have been affected by Christians, or are scared of Christians, have a vested interest in reporting their findings, e.g. that religion is nothing but a tool of authoritarianism, and discussing their ideas, both with like minded individuals, and people as confused and angry as they once were.|`|Johiu2cwaa	I am here because you keep asking me questions and to:    1.

It won't make you fluent, but it does teach you more things faster and more completely than anything else.      I've used it and I've also bought other books and computer programs, and even moved to a country to immerse myself in the language and Rosetta worked faster than all of them.      If you really want to learn Arabic, you should definitely get Rosetta, but you should also supplement it with other things to reinforce your learning.

In America we have many very poor companies that sell us poor quality things so they will break easily and we will have to buy more. Our Cars are built to low standards, our electronics and computers hardly last 2 years. Every day a new person thinks of a way to try and convince us to spend money on a monthly basis, like cell phones, game memberships, extra services within our TV service...

The bottom line is..............whether you like your name, not what others think of it.......it may have special meaning for your family or ancestors.....nonetheless make sure that you correct any mis-pronunciations of your name so others get it right   If they care enuf, then your name will be pronounced the right way or the way you wish  What's in a name?......sometimes alot and one never knows until told so  If it matters to you at all.......   by the way, I like your name.........imagine ppl with names like 'Laqueeshia' or many names  that are otherwise non-traditional or unconventional  also.....how about 'JaDonnia'...pronounced JA-DON-NEE-A....... I have faced mispronunciations all my life, and I do like my name[with a special meaning]    Don't sweat the small stuff.......|`|7kEu2mAXaa	NO offense,but i dont like your name.  id pronounce it " sas-kiea "|`|Rtat1tQqaa	i would pronounce it---saas-key -yaa; by the way whats its meaning i heard it 1st time nice name ;different one

The slowing earth rotation, eroding river dealtas, formation and erosion of mountain ranges, polystrate fossils, the decreasing magnetic field, the saltification of the oceans, the mud accumulation in the Gulf of Mexico, the "billions of years" radiometrically assigned to even horizons that happened in 1963, frozen mammoths that give multiple wild carbon dates, and dead frozen dinosaur bones with green food still in the teeth all lend scientific credit for a young earth despite the indoctrination given to you in your school class room.    It's high time that people like you develop some critical thinking skills and broaden your horizon of knowledge to include a few facts, and not just a bunch of nonscientific myths from loons who simply want to wish God away.

bTA5ndeMaa	Quote:This god lets people starve   How does he do that?  Isn't it your greed, your governments, your wars, etc. that cause all these things?    You mean to tell me that all of the earth is suffering drought and cannot make enough food for all?      Instead we see that the distribution and self rule by man cause injury to man.  Why do you have to blame God for your failings?  If you drive too fast while drunk and have an accident - is it really God's fault?  or your own!  Obviously you seem to be the kind of person who does not like to take responsibility for any of your own actions.    What do you think self rule implies?    All you guys do is find fault, you never study the issues.  The intelligence many atheists demonstrate is astounding.    For your amusement, you should know that the Great Tribulation is beginning, just being initialized.  During it perhaps millions will die from wars, hunger, pestilence.   God's judgments are starting to be seen.  Have fun, blame him all you want, scream all you want later.  He will laugh at all the wicked and their agony.|`|6DmsiLGbaa	Maybe not our "job," no, but it is our responsibility.  Of course God would want us to care for each other as best we can.      I'm not going to touch the "why God lets people starve" thing, either.  I understand why, but I'm not any more eager to trigger that debate than you are.  Still, I don't believe that by giving of my means, I'm taking life and death in my own hands.  The way I see it, everything I have came from God.  By giving some of what He has given me to others, I'm not usurping His authority; instead, I'm letting Him use me as a tool by which He helps His other children.  In that sense, I'm actually turning myself over to God, giving Him more honor and power over me.  In return, my doing so allows me to be part of God's work and to feel His love for all of us in greater measures.  Giving to those in need is a blessing I would never want to be without.|`|bd0RIXZ0aa	how can you blame god when he tell's us the strong ought bear the imfermetie's of the weak it's because greddy and heartless people who have their own agenda's in my mind what's wrong with there goverment how could there goverment let that happen to there own people god put them in charge and beside's god created us he gave us what needed to survive it's the greed of men who let people starve|`|Vd0a8fb7aa	I don't think it's our job to send money to starving people.

69750f25faea5e6021c54c23d0dcb774aa	The story of Sodom and Gomorrah was fiction.|`|AA11648578	No more evil than man is today. That is definitely not the point.  Who is more evil adulterers of the days when they were stoned or adulterers today?  Was Sodom and Gomorrah more evil than the world of today?    Luke 13: 1 There were present at that season some that told him of the Galilaeans, whose blood Pilate had mingled with their sacrifices.   2 And Jesus answering said unto them, Suppose ye that these Galilaeans were sinners above all the Galilaeans, because they suffered such things?   3 I tell you, Nay: but, except ye repent, ye shall all likewise perish.   4 Or those eighteen, upon whom the tower in Siloam fell, and slew them, think ye that they were sinners above all men that dwelt in Jerusalem?   5 I tell you, Nay: but, except ye repent, ye shall all likewise perish|`|OT4SrmDXaa	Christ said Sodam would have repented had they had him.  Its actually getting much worse now then it was then.|`|6DmsiLGbaa	It depends on how you look at it.  Sodom was supposedly a den of sin because of all the homosexuality (hence the term "sodomy"), rape, and general immorality...all of which today's world has in abundance.  We're probably far worse in the sense that evil has become so much easier for us thanks to the spread of pornography and violence through the Internet, television, and mass-produced literature.  Plus, today's people also often don't even think twice about doing things that would have gotten them executed in Old Testament times.  We've come to accept sin on a level that they couldn't have dreamed about.      On the other hand...the difference between a city of today, even the worst city, and Sodom is the people.  Lot was told by God that if even one person was righteous, the city would be spared.  He couldn't find that one person, and the city was destroyed.  If Lot were living in our time, would he be able to find that person?  Yes, I believe he would.  The world is more evil, maybe, but that only allows more of the good to come out.  When Katrina hit and all that crap was going on in the Superdome, for example, people all over the country were also rushing over to help.  They were opening their homes and donating time and money and supplies, and I just can't see something like that happening with Sodom.  The people were too selfish.      So is the world worse today than Sodom?  Yes.  Is it also better?  Yes.  I can't say that I'm grateful for the evil in any way, but I also have to recognize the good that often follows in the wake of the evil.  Try to hold on to that when you look around and see the horrors that come with the world in which we live.  It'll keep you sane and give you hope.|`|JXfGHsF6aa	I sometimes wonder about acid rain!    Matthew 11:24 But I say unto you, That it shall be more tolerable for the land of Sodom in the day of judgment, than for thee.    Mark 6:11 And whosoever shall not receive you, nor hear you, when ye depart thence, shake off the dust under your feet for a testimony against them. Verily I say unto you, It shall be more tolerable for Sodom and Gomorrha in the day of judgment, than for that city.    Luke 10:12 But I say unto you, that it shall be more tolerable in that day for Sodom, than for that city.    Luke 17:29 But the same day that Lot went out of Sodom it rained fire and brimstone from heaven, and destroyed them all.    2Peter 2:6 And turning the cities of Sodom and Gomorrha into ashes condemned them with an overthrow, making them an ensample unto those that after should live ungodly;    Jude 1:7 Even as Sodom and Gomorrha, and the cities about them in like manner, giving themselves over to fornication, and going after strange flesh, are set forth for an example, suffering the vengeance of eternal fire.    Luk 17:24-30 For as the lightning, that lighteneth out of the one part under heaven, shineth unto the other part under heaven; so shall also the Son of man be in his day.  But first must he suffer many things, and be rejected of this generation.  And as it was in the days of Noe, so shall it be also in the days of the Son of man.  They did eat, they drank, they married wives, they were given in marriage, until the day that Noe entered into the ark, and the flood came, and destroyed them all.  Likewise also as it was in the days of Lot; they did eat, they drank, they bought, they sold, they planted, they builded;  "But the same day that Lot went out of Sodom it rained fire and brimstone from heaven, and destroyed them all."  "Even thus shall it be in the day when the Son of man is revealed."|`|hQDapmICaa	Eze 16:48  As I live, saith the Lord GOD, Sodom thy sister hath not done, she nor her daughters, as thou hast done, thou and thy daughters.

Sodom and Gomorrah, along with three other cities, were heavily inundated with the practice of same sex unions to the point that the entire city, save only a few, were obsessed with this perversion.  Compared to those cities, the modern world we live in is wholesome.      Google earth shows darkened areas where Sodom and Gomorrah were and archeologists findings support what took place on that day, digging out of the charred rock formation golf ball sized brimstone.

They even followed 2 angels to Lots home, demanding (out loud) to have them.|`|i85Dui0maa	jesus came after S&G he made it possible for our sins to be forgiving.......thank god ...literally lol|`|0NOiAlJOaa	Actually, Sodom and Gomorrah are an exact "parallel" of today's world. Jesus Christ used the example of Noah's day to reveal the attitudes that would predominate near the end: "But as the days of Noah were, so also will the coming of the Son of Man be. For as in the days before the flood, they were eating and drinking, marrying and giving in marriage, until the day that Noah entered the ark, and did not know until the flood came and took them all away, so also will the coming of the Son of Man be" (Matthew 24:37-39).    Here we see history and prophecy working together. The meaning is clear: The attitude of people in Noah's day would prevail again just before Christ's second coming. As in the former case, God would be deemed as far away, unconcerned about human activities on earth, with life appearing to go on as always (2 Peter 3:3-6). Like before, people would be unconcerned as to their true spiritual condition and blind to God's impending judgment.    The key to the example Christ gave is to understand that people can be so concerned about the cares of this life that they ignore their Creator (Matthew 6:33; Luke 21:34-35). It happened before, and it is happening again.     The apostle Paul similarly foretold the overall self-seeking mind-set that would dominate people's thinking in the last days: "But know this, that in the last days perilous times will come. For men will be lovers of themselves, lovers of money, boasters, proud, blasphemers, disobedient to parents, unthankful, unholy, unloving, unforgiving, slanderers, without self-control, brutal, despisers of good, traitors, headstrong, haughty, lovers of pleasures more than lovers of God, having a form of godliness, but denying its power" (2 Timothy 3:1-5).    This perfectly describes the overall attitude and outlook of our age. Such thinking will prevent the vast majority of humanity from believing God and the biblical warning signs indicating Christ's imminent return. Like the people in Noah's time who laughed and mocked as he built the ark, the end of this age will come when the overwhelming majority are unprepared.|`|KYaM65gzaa	No.|`|FyLfEPv0aa	Wicked without righteous among them.

Psalm 78:69 (New International Reader's Version)     69 There he built his holy place as secure as the heavens.         He built it to last forever, like the earth.

"Tell us," they said. "When will this happen? And what will be the sign of your coming? What will be the sign of the end?"     Read on in Mathew 24 to find, not a date, but the signs, which we see today. Jesus said:    32 "Learn a lesson from the fig tree. As soon as its twigs get tender and its leaves come out, you know that summer is near. 33 In the same way, when you see all those things happening, you know that the end is near.

Lev 18:22  Lev 20:13  1 Cor. 6:9-10  Romans 1:26-28    Lev. 18:22, "You shall not lie with a male as one lies with a female; it is an abomination."     Lev. 20:13, "If there is a man who lies with a male as those who lie with a woman, both of them have committed a detestable act; they shall surely be put to death. Their bloodguiltness is upon them"     1 Cor. 6:9-10, "Or do you not know that the unrighteous shall not inherit the kingdom of God? Do not be deceived; neither fornicators, nor idolaters, nor adulterers, nor effeminate, nor homosexuals, 10nor thieves, nor the covetous, nor drunkards, nor revilers, nor swindlers, shall inherit the kingdom of God."     Rom. 1:26-28, "For this reason God gave them over to degrading passions; for their women exchanged the natural function for that which is unnatural, 27and in the same way also the men abandoned the natural function of the woman and burned in their desire toward one another, men with men committing indecent acts and receiving in their own persons the due penalty of their error. 28And just as they did not see fit to acknowledge God any longer, God gave them over to a depraved mind, to do those things which are not proper."         Homosexuality is clearly condemned by the Bible.   It goes against the created order of God.  He created Adam and then made a woman.  This is what God has ordained and it is what is right.  Unlike other sins, homosexuality has a severe judgment administered by God Himself. This judgment is simple: They are given over to their passions. That means that their hearts are allowed to be hardened by their sins (Romans 1:18ff). As a result, they can no longer see the error of what they are doing. Without an awareness of their sinfulness, there will be no repentance and trusting in Jesus. Without Jesus, they will have no forgiveness. Without forgiveness, there is no salvation.      39. WHAT SHOULD BE THE CHRISTIAN'S RESPONSE TO THE HOMOSEXUAL?          Just because someone is a homosexual does not mean that we cannot love him (or her) or pray for him (her). Homosexuality is a sin and like any other sin, it needs to be dealt with in the only way possible. It needs to be laid at the cross, repented of, and never done again.         As a Christian, you should pray for the salvation of the homosexual the same you would any other person in sin. The homosexual is still made in the image of God -- even though he is in grave sin.  Therefore, you should show him same dignity as anyone else you come in contact with. However, this does not mean that you are to approve of their sin. Don't compromise your witness for a socially acceptable opinion that is void of godliness.|`|hQDapmICaa	sure, if you want to                              but no luggage (sin)|`|6kAAj8hUaa	as long as you are a good person|`|WfR6AqHiaa	no. lets say if you were gay you could go to heaven, but do you even accept jesus christ is the son of god?|`|r3sg5Xsdaa	You like men to sex them?

XnAq9rd5aa	There are a few things wrong with this.  First off, I'm sure your teacher would approve the Bible if his decision were to be based purely on content of your books. But he's going to also be judging the difficulty of understanding the text and the length.  Which are both major issues on doing the Bible for your report.  The Bible (even if you only do one testament per each nine weeks) is insanely long! And it would be very unfair to the other students if he were to allow you to skim through your book but make all the other students read theirs. ("But why can't *I* just research my book and skim through the actual content like 'Megs.'?!") Because what you would have to do is skim the books to get the general idea and the research what the book's message was and why it is in the Bible and why it is important. Honestly, I think it would be nearly impossible for you to read the entire Old Testament and write a decent report on in it nine weeks. And even if it were *maybe* possible (which it's not) I wouldn't risk what sounds like a major grade like that.  Also, while you may be able to understand what the text is *literally* saying, you will NOT fully understand what you are reading. You'll probably end up writing a paper full of heresies and misunderstandings that were not your fault at all! You were just reading it the best you could! Really, unless your withholding the information that you are also a Biblical scholar, then you'd just be doing the Bible a disservice. Unless your a fundamentalist in which case you take everything literally from the Bible without considering what the author wanted to convey and the circumstances in which they wrote it then you'll have to research the reasons behind the writting. Remember, the Bible was definitely inspired by God, it is definitely God's word, but it is NOT *literally* written by God or whispered into the writer's ear by God. It is written by humans so what was written then will not be as clear as it was back when they wrote it so we need to study that time period it was written and the persecution the writers may have been under and why they wrote some of the stories that they did. Sorry if that was kind of confusing - I'm in the midst of a four-year class on this (I'm about two years into it, so far) so I just tried to tell you the very basics.  I think it's wonderful that you want to do your report on the Bible and that you have the best intentions in doing this but it is not wise (it is very 'sophomoric'! - lol, get it? your in tenth grade so your a sophomore but sophomore literally means 'wise fool'. It is very wise and great of you to want to attempt this but it is really not the best idea. Sorry, lame english joke. And, no, it wasn't meant to be insulting. My 10th grade english teacher always did lame jokes about that in my class, haha.) Anyway, it's not the best idea even though it is full of wonderful intentions.  Perhaps what you could do is pick one medium-to-long-ish book in Bible and do your report on that by reading it all and then researching it. You'd HAVE to research it though (unless your a fundamentalist in which you don't care about the author's intent or the background, you take the stories as they are from the Bible).  Otherwise, I'd suggest picking a different book. Perhaps a religious book written by a Pope or a saint or a priest or Mother Teresa or something?  It is really great you wanted to do this, I'm sorry that it probably won't work out. Even if you don't take my advice and ask him anyway he probably will not let you do it based on the shear magnitude of it! I'm really sorry!  Best of luck,  Katie  PS: sorry this is so insanely long. I obviously have a hard time being concise! Really, I am sorry for my rambling!|`|9wjUooBKaa	I think it is wonderful you want to read the Bible. DO IT!!! But if you want to do a book report on the Bible....I would just pick out a book of the Bible and do it on that. My Choice would be a book like Genesis or Ruth. To do a a report on the Bible would be long, very long...and you might find it hard to sum it up, and as a solider of God, You need to represent the Bible very well, and it might be hard to do in a school book report in a short time. I encourage you though to keep reading the Bible and set a goal in maybe a 12 month time span. Good Luck!|`|uuSj24Xxaa	Probably not.

God Bless.|`|gCVA7Z1Maa	I don't know where to start?! I think it's way too long and the language too archaic to be accessible. You know there are several chapters that are just lists of names of who begat whom. Several chapters are full of mystical mumbo jumbo like Genesis and Ezekiel which no one could take seriously.  And then there's the major problem that the archaeological evidence suggests the entire Old Testament is a work of political propaganda that doesn't have any connection to reality, no expulsion from Egypt, no kingdom of Solomon, no united Hebrew people at any time. And of course everyone knows the Gospels were written for similar purposes, collected to define a certain type of religion to allow the rulers to better exploit the people, which ushered in the Dark Ages, while the equally popular gospels that suggested people govern themselves and live happily were rejected and burned. And that all the letters from Paul and Revelations were of course added at a later date and were written by people who'd never heard of the gospels at all.     I think it would be a big mistake to continue bothering with this controversial and mostly nonsensical book.|`|gYNDNXAkaa	That'll be a fun report.

Created in God's image and called to know and love him, the person who seeks God discovers certain ways of coming to know him. These are also called "proofs" for the existence of God, not in the sense of proofs in the natural sciences, but rather in the sense of "converging and convincing arguments, which allow us to attain certainty about the truth. These "ways" of approaching God from creation have a twofold point of departure : the physical world and the human person.     The world: starting from movement, becoming, contingency, and the world's order and beauty ( I am not saying it is "too perfect"), one can come to a knowledge of God as the origin and the end of the universe.  Question the beauty of the earth, question the beauty of the sea, question the beauty of the air distending and diffusing itself, question the beauty of the sky....question all these realities. All respond: "See, we are beautiful". Their beauty is a profession. These beauties are subject to change. Who made them if not the Beautiful One, who is not subject to change.    The human person: With his openness to truth and beauty, his sense of moral goodness, his freedom and the voice of his conscience, with his longings for the infinite and for happiness, man questions himself about God's existence. In all this he discerns signs of his spiritual soul. The soul, the seed of eternity we bear in ourselves, irreducible to the merely material, can have its origin only in God. The world, and man, attest that they contain within themselves beither their first principle nor their final end, but rather that they participate in Being itself, which alone is without origin or end. Thus, in different ways, man can come to know that there exists a reality which is the first cause and the final end of all things, a reality that is called God.|`|5e5aec03a0919c712548d067b9f5b488aa	dude, im not going to read your disclaimer.    dont be a fool, you already know that the backbone on the god theories is magic! you think jehovah created the universe in seven days with a few nails and hammer?    they all believe in magic, and magic does not exist. i cant believe you wrote all that crap|`|MVLanV8zaa	I am a Christian.    You cannot prove it.  God says you must have FAITH in him.  Faith means believing in what you cannot see.  How can people have faith in him if somebody can prove his existence?        God is almighty, and that is what atheists and scientists don't get.  They think if he exists, they must be able to find him.    You can only find him in your heart. Nobody else can find him in your heart. Only you can.    That is what almighty means. He cannot be found in ways that he does not want to be found, no matter what instruments are used.  Walk by faith. Find him yourself. That is the only way.    But, if you cannot believe in His word, history, and the miracles that was written in history done by Jesus and prophets, even written down by atheists, and people that believe in other gods, then I guess you will never believe.    I guess if you are searching for a fact through science, you are barking up the wrong tree, and so far lost yourself from him. :(    Close minded. You got your answer didn't you?  There is no way to prove to anybody, or you that he exists :)  If you are too blind to see that...    Your believe or non believe is your own.

By looking at the series of motion in the world and going back to the creation of the universe, we conclude that there must have been a First Mover or an Unmoved Mover or God.    2. First Cause - The world is a series of causes and effects.  Taking those causes and effects back in history, to the moment of creation; we conclude, that there must have been a first cause of creation or God.    3. Everything comes from something - Nothing cannot create something ... therefore there must have been one necessary Eternal Being who brought other beings into existence.    4. Supreme Model - Persons and things have various degrees of perfections (such as goodness, beauty, truth, etc.)  No single created person or thing possesses all perfection, therefore, since creation shares in perfection but does not possess it, there must be a Being who possesses all perfection ... God.    5. Grand Designer - There are systems in the world which are so intricate and perfect in the way they work, that there is no possible way human beings could have been their origin, nor can they re-create them.  Therefore, there much have been an Intelligent and Perfect Designer or God    6. Happiness - All desire happiness.  Human beings spend their whole lives constantly searching for lasting joy.  This desire for everlasting happiness points to an Eternal God, Who is the source and summit of all happiness.    7. The experience of beauty or truth - When human beings experience profound beauty or truth, that experience points to the origin of all beauty and truth - God.    8. An experience of personal conscience or moral goodness - Experiences of doing good and doing evil point to an ultimate source of moral judgment or God.    9. Love - The experience of love is a reality which the material world cannot explain.  This experience must therefore have a non-material and spiritual source or God.

Hmmm...maybe the same way he did.    What you call proof (or more acurately non-coincidence), is also used against your claim, as the fatally narrow scope of scripture in the old testament (which is what the Koran is based on) clearly illustrates the narrow global understanding of it's author(s).

The truth is God is an eternal spirit and his truth is revealed through the spirit by God.  The ones who receive God's truth are those who love and seek his truth and are willing to receive it from God.|`|E870WbAsaa	Dear Brother,    God will never appear before any one of us to prove himself, he is not a human being, God shows his signs in this universe to think & ponder, have you ever give it a thought that how precisely, orderly, and perfectly this universe is working, if you say its laws of physics or quantum physics / mechanics, then i ask who is there, who created those laws. This magnifcient universe isn't running / working at its own, there has to be some one supreme being / power managing all this.    I agree with the answer of PAKI24, that's a fact, more over if you want to experiance God by yourself, then do as my profile says, you will know the facts by youself with the willing of God, Insha Allah.          Peace & Blessings    Thanks  :)
YcGNL9y1aa	Here is a link to a firm who deliver birthday baskets:-    http://www.adorablegiftbaskets.com/    If you input "birthday basket delivery" into your Google search engine, there are a few to chose from.    Good luck!
WAoNhHB1aa	Yeah, girl, ALL British guys have the EXACT same personalities.    That was sarcasm.  Do you know how dumb that sounds?  How can all people in a category be exactly the same?|`|yeFZzstvaa	No. But they are all seriously attractive due to their accents.|`|YFmtHNkiaa	no but the mean ones make all those great reality shows! :D my cousin dated a british dude and he was very nice.|`|If7d3qJIaa	i like to think that some of us are intelligent, witty generous and friendly, but if you come to any city centre on a saturday night and i would be ashamed to admit i'm english
N8UwWt2Kaa	Hell Yeah!    I am Christian and that annoy's the hell out of me! I don't even have a sexual preference, I'd date a guy or girl and I don't think for one second that God would love me any less. And to tell you the truth, the people who say that stuff know their wrong because the bible says they shouldn't judge anyone...They just focus on what makes them uncomfortable instead of worrying about themselves.|`|sVkSrUqNaa	the bible basher's piss me  off no matter what they are just sad little people that need a life|`|NTq0XOEDaa	Because like most religions (cough cough $cientology) they are simply using a fictional text to justify their own extremist views.  They cover up the bits of the bible they don't like (Such as woman not being allowed out of the home on sundays) and cover up their killings through the centuries not to mention their neglect of the poor and needy to provide gold to satiate their need for material wealth and then say it is WE who are unholy and immoral.    Remember that the church only survives now because of their uncanny ability to feed of the fears of the populace and divert it into hatred of minorities.  Blacks, Arabs, Jews, Gays, all have been and will again be targets of this bigotry.  Without that, people might start putting two and two together and realising that they've been conned.  Actually the Church of $cientology isn't so bad when you think about it, at least they freely admit that their religion is based on the texts of a SciFi Author!|`|3FOmoaUZaa	Yeah, it's absurd. Ppl shouldn't take everything in the Bible so literally. It contradicts itself a  million times... just like those ppl.   "Thou shalt not judge"  is one of the main points.|`|KzNv0gmaaa	Yes, and if they would read the bible cover to cover they would see that parts of it glorify rape, murder and sacrifice of children. So why only pick out certain parts?|`|q5m9g1yWaa	I am embarrassed to be associated with most Christians for that exact reason. Luckily, I am not an ignorant bigot and can defend my own viewpoints. People pick and choose what they want to believe from the bible, and then condemn others who do the same. Being gay is not a sin, and that can be defended by using the bible. People just don't want to admit it because that's the way they were brought up.    Luckily, I was brought up with a brain. Thank you Jesus, for making me smart enough to tell people when they're being dumb idiots.
uTocOEwUaa	Ask to speak with them and tell them how it much it means to you. If for some reason they are not able to accept it, talk to your fiance.    Or talk to your fiance first and go to them together.|`|89a4e35709fd20d8fa340ef1d5a3bac3aa	Salam. You should discuss it with your fiance how to deal it with the "in laws to be" when the right time and where the right place and what is the write words.  At the agreed time and place you must talk to the in laws to be politely and tenderly to explain your propose clearly,so the in laws to be will allow your walima.  You must get some information about the in laws to be from indepen  dent sourceand ask for his advice, before meeting with them for smoothing the process.Insya Allah.|`|bn0oXqDcaa	Tell them politely and with full respect. Be nice so that they take you positively :) and good luck!|`|bQMSrlodaa	ask them nicely and ask them to talk to ur fiance|`|Ztiy3jjwaa	Necessary for a Moulana from your musjid, or a member or elder from your family, to approach  your 'future-inlaws' in presenting your request at a immediate meeting, so as not to cause any further future misunderstanding and any inconvenience in the arrangements for the nikah.|`|vnty8yOgaa	Wilma is a feast.    It is compulsory
ytLvToBUaa	Why not. We already tell our children they are special, even when they are not. Giving them those ribbons that say participant. This raises the expectation of children. Who grow up thinking that they should be rewarded even when they didn't accomplish anything. And as the grow older and find that life is harder than the thought either they Whine until someone gives them what they want, or they realize they are too lazy to better themselves now so they cheat to get by. My answer is yes, Society is easy on Cheaters, because society created them. The really sad thing is that cheaters multiply. If the decent guy who works hard can't get anywhere because others are cheating, he feels more incline to cheat himself.|`|849d6b13631f1ba99a0c1e7655b40d5faa	Yes, and this has to do with modern religion.  Specifically, christianity.    When a religion mandates that all will be forgiven at the mere request of the offender, it creates a society of scapegoat-ism.    Combine that with the wish-thinking inherent in prayer, and you get a culture based on self centred ideals, founded on entitlement and a complete lack of conscience.|`|MB1oT04maa	society is a myth   bogus and hypocritical|`|wXp06yBEaa	Yes. Obama's people he has considered for positions have skipped out on their taxes and only have to pay it back, who cares about punishment for democrats and making a big deal about it. That would be silly!|`|H3Pu6YF4aa	I'm sorry ,but I can't agree with you
1xMTNTgkaa	Offer a hot meal and take them or give them money to get a bus or cab to the nearest shelter.    You should not let strangers in your car.   But I would do that for anyone in trouble. If I don't have money I'd call our local police if it was okay with that person, for a lift to the shelter. Our small town cops help like that. Or call my Dad to give us all a lift.  My family and I were nearly  homeless we lived on nearly nothing. Way back then you would kindly rely sometimes on friends and strangers. It is always hard to take things from people, even friends.They really did not have shelters or support for low income or homeless back then.  So I know how important they are to people now. And how special a hot meal can be. And true friends who helped us.  Our local shelter provides whatever anyone needs. With local support. Our town is really proud of that.  You asked a really wonderful question. Best Wishes.    EDIT>>>>>>>>>>>>>>Beware!!! The thumbs down TROLL is here!!!|`|T6nmD3X9aa	talk to them like a normal human being. You would not believe how so many homeless people are treated, like they are contagious or something to be ignored. Its horrible. Most of those who are homeless have also lost much of their pride and self-esteem. Seeing them as equals is one of the best gifts you can give.     Take them out to eat, sit and have a meal with them and see if there is something you could do to help them (blankets, clean clothes, location of a shelter or help center to help get them back on their feet). A good conversation is worth alot to people who feel completely ignored.|`|L2bQifUXaa	Just thank him?|`|lEQ4PhpLaa	Buy them a warm meal or beverage whichever I could afford.|`|YOKJP1evaa	Cook him or her dinner as my way of showing my thanks.|`|0xR5UNRpaa	Take them out to lunch, dinner or breakfast. It depends on what time of the day it is.|`|wfZTAD29aa	i would give him 5-15 bucks|`|qvEaW9s6aa	i would give them some money get some food maybe help them with there situation    good karma|`|KHC2oE8iaa	sh*t i'd ask him how the hell did he get to where he's at. he'd probably say, "i did the opposite of what ever it is you did young man". lol. seriously though just tell him thank you and give him a little something. with $3 he could get a meal from the dollar menu.|`|89xzNpVaaa	Ask that person what i could do for him in return, and i'd do anything.|`|od1IXLosaa	Talk to them, and offer them some money.  If they are helping a stranger usually means they are looking to socialize.|`|pe4uGaZbaa	I sometimes pack a lunch for a man that is so sweet and usually in the same spot. I gave him my old comforter this year. Thanking a homeless person good but an appreciative action is great... I don't like to give money but a cold bottle of water on a hot day is good.|`|YpN50jFDaa	I would look the person directly in the eyes, say thank you and how much I truly appreciated what he had done for me.  I would extend my hand for a handshake. Why?  People avoid eye contact with anyone that makes them feel uncomfortable, people would never shake hands with anyone they wouldn't look directly in the eyes.  I would do all of the above regardless what other people would do.|`|Aqhcl2eAaa	Just simply say thank you!  I'm sure that if they were nice enough to do a nice thing, then they wouldn't be the sort to expect something back!  One time when we were driving along the road there was a hitchhiker outside a petrol station.  We were going in there anyway because we were getting ice creams, and he thought we were gonna give him a ride but we couldn't.  I felt really bad so i bought him an ice cream too!  i know that sounds cheesy but i felt really sorry for him and it was a really hot day!|`|0s93q8Ocaa	Thank him.|`|iKJycf6Zaa	Offer him some money.|`|bab98853150b199df79ea228be16f757aa	I'd thank the homeless person from the bottom of my heart and tell that person my story.  Both my husband and I were homeless before ... we now have a good income (over $60,000 per year to support the two of us).  If I have any money, I'll give them some, but only if they know it's because I want to share with them, and not because I 'owe it' to them or that I think I'm 'better' than they are.  That's far from the truth.  I've been there, I understand, and I don't offer money unless I know they'll 'appreciate it' ... but our 'story' gives them hope, so most often that's what I give them ... just plain HOPE that their lives will be better someday, too.|`|uuSj24Xxaa	Like I would anyone else who was kind to me. With a beer and a pizza!|`|R2iCzRjsaa	Give them a meal preferably, or money.  Money for most homeless buys drugs or alcohol, but if they did something nice, and you can afford to help, then at least try.|`|94PHAJw9aa	I'd give him a dollar. Minimum. Depending on how nice, the price increases

From now on I would rather we ignore these arguments and answer questions.|`|287ae5682476df003fc4d95ff463997aaa	The problem with this whole mess is that people cling to "their" beliefs without actually going back to the Qur'an and Sunnah for judgment.

I guess they care about each other so much that they each want to prove each other wrong so that when that other person IS proven wrong they will truly find the new real right path to heaven.  Yeah, I guess that makes sense.|`|MhbEQoJYaa	Sorry that wont work. You know the Shia guy, Osama???? If you see the questions he post up, as a Sunni I cant just sit and look at it.

It's not in me to be able to understand how anyone could do something so barbaric.   A ten year old?   Ughh.   I'm ecstatic they were saved.
Kh5o3QCcaa	I would bring it up in a polite manner.  Something like "Hey, how are you? (let him fill in the blank) Then simply say "I was just wondering if you could include me next time you [rearrange cubicles] so that I can have a say in it as well?"  You really don't need to elaborate, but if you'd like to you can.    If you put it that way you are simply asking him to consider your input at the same time alerting him that what he did wasn't cool and you're not necessarily happy with the out come-- but you are doing it in a friendly constructive manner with out actually having to say so.      I don't think you would need to worry about losing your job over this, like you said, it's a really trivial matter, but it was rude of him none the less, and you have every right to ask that you're input be considered in the workplace.    I do not agree that a poor job market means that you should allow everybody and their mother to walk on you.|`|4B9Ve1LSaa	The boss was probably happy to have someone else take on the project of laying out the new floor plan rather than having to do it himself.  The coworker who now is assigned to do this pretty much just got lucky by turning a situation that the boss did not really want to deal with into a project for someone else to take on.  I don't think it would be in your best interest to say anything, really, what good would come out of it?  You would just come across as a whiner and be a thorn in your bosses side by complicating things.  It really would serve no purpose to confront or be angry with your coworker.  He saw an opportunity and ran with it and it worked out in his favor.  Let it go and like you said just smile at him and say hello.  You don't want to let him know that he got to you, it will just once again give him the upper hand.|`|FIG58FVpaa	I would probably be annoyed, too... but I probably would just keep it to myself. I don't know how much good it will do to piss him and all of his buddies off by asking your boss to switch things back around.|`|DpPCs6fPaa	RaGS sez : Dude! Quit immediately, if not sooner! If it was me, I'd tell them all adios tomorrow and that you have your own microwave oven at home and that you'd prefer to use your own.

I'm outa there like mucho pronto!|`|y4yKmqQLaa	start kissng up to  him, he will  soon be one of your boss',   He may have a Friend for your cubical!!|`|jd14u32qaa	Let him sit back there and hang out with his buddies.  You keep your head in the game and do your work.  If the company is well run, things will sort out better for you that way.  Bringing up something like this has more potential to make you look petty than it does of doing any good.|`|H5nBLB9Zaa	just suck it up, you're lucky to have a job right now. what's unemployment right now?|`|G9liglrwaa	Usually I might confront the co-worker and let whatever happens, happen but since we are going through tough times I would say.... Go to the same boss he went to and ask what motivated the change of the floor plan. Let him no that you are grateful for the job and you are in no way complaining but you are just curious...I think if you confront the co-worker things might get ugly and then he could make you look like a trouble maker to both your boss and other co-workers....I do understand your plight...When I feel crossed by someone its hard to get over it...In this case if you cannot forget about it then go to the boss.|`|So00Bd5zaa	Don't say anything to anybody. The proof of the latest floor plan is if it adds to the efficiency of the department. You will soon find out.
WVP1zmy7aa	NO,  they promised you in 4 hours but you got it back in 12 hours later.  where is the service in that.   if anything they should give you a discount.|`|R2iCzRjsaa	I'd say you've tipped them about 8 hours already.

I believe that Sasquatch/Bigfoot is a real primate, an ice age great ape called 'Gigaintipithicus' which is thought to have gone extinct 10,000 years ago but most likely still exists in the shrinking pockets of unexplored wilderness that remain. There are probably about 2,000 of them in the North America alone in the Forrest's of the Pacific Northwest (Cali, Oregon, Wash, & B.C)along with being nocturnal which keep our encounters at a minimum they must have learned over the milenia's of cohabitation with us that their survival depends on their avoidance of man.     Gorilla's the worlds largest known primate was only discovered 100 years ago before that it was thought to be a myth much like bigfoot and know we've driven them to the edge of extinction and keep them in cages for our entertainment...

I doubt they'll ever find a body, though. I'll give you a theory I heard, which I sorta agree with. What if animals tend to find themselves before they die a natural death?

Although it could be just a joke, remember that guy pretending to be bigfoot?  Well, they are just myths, and at the end of the day they are just that, underterminable things.  I believe the loch ness monster legend is more plausible then this.  You should wikipedia it.  If you wikipedia the lcoh ness monster you'll see that they did tests and found things, like sonar testing found unexplanatory creatures in the loch, but they couldn't track it.  I hope they are real, it would be so amazing.  Email me if you want.....    Btw; the loch ness monster being a dinosaur myth.  It should be dead?  Well take this into consideration...  When the supposed meteorite stuck the earth and killed off all the land mammals the monster (pletiosaurus) was submerged. most of them may have died but an egg was laid.  During the ice age the egg chryogenically frozen, and since then it has very slowly thawed out into another pletiosaur.  Either that or a fully grown pletiousaur may replace that egg.  There have been 2 sizes of the monster found, some to be a couple of metres long and some to be awesomely long creatures.|`|iCKkOWI7aa	NO!|`|6JXrlnYsaa	For centuries, Europeans and Americans heard stories about giant mountain gorillas in Africa.

If there is only one "Bigfoot" then it would have to be at least 50. The average lifespan of a monkey is around 20 years.    If there's more than one "Bigfoot" (thereby being able to reproduce) then it should be impossible for it to be so elusive, especially noting the many new species discovered in far more obscure locations.    No, I do not think a "Bigfoot" will ever be found. The infamous picture of Bigfoot was certainly a prank, noting facts like it has such a clean fur coat.    It is worth noting, that among "weird" human diseases and defects, there is one where the person grows hairs over 100% of their body (not a literal 100%...). This includes all areas of the face. It could be that one of these poor humans were simply running nude in the mountains.|`|S4HUVnzkaa	Seems to me they would have found at least bones by now.

T5DbLLgQaa	Learning language well requires being as active as possible and making the learning fun for yourself. Taking lessons is always important, but equally important are these:    1) Listen/watch: Listen to internet radio stations like BBC, watch TV shows in English (use only subtitles, NOT voice dubbing!), etc.    2) Write/communicate: Try to find discussion forums from the web about things that you find interesting (music/various artists, hobbies, etc.) and start communicating there with other people using English. Start using instant messaging systems in case you find some new friends or start emailing them.    3) Buy yourself a proper dictionary, and each time when you see a strange word that you do not understand, look it up.    The main point in ANY language learning is to make it as fun as possible for yourself. Try to find topics that interest you, read online newspapers, listen to BBC/NBC and other radio stations online, if you find a discussion forum for e.g. your favourite hobby or your idols in music do participate there, etc.     Last but not least: NEVER EVER use ANY online translators, they are nothing but utter rubbish!!

If you're not giving it they won't care. It's the sad reality. :(    I was there too, I didn't give mine up till I met a great guy in university. Just be yourself, find good friends and don't worry about it. Don't be someone you're not. People start maturing when you get out of highschool.|`|yJHu9Mdlaa	i dont like stick figure. i like auburn hair and i LOVE to read too :>.. so u cant say bout all guys|`|6Qq1dCCCaa	Baby, you just need to let that bowel movement dribble down yo' thigh honeh. It works wonderful to moisturize babeh.|`|TpsiOzCIaa	You'll eventually fine someone, just wait.|`|dcTtc2Xuaa	You should first ask yourself if YOU love YOU. Others can tell when our self-esteem is low and when we feel that we aren't good enough for others. Confidence makes you sexy and attractive so consider how you see yourself and others will follow. Hope this helps:)|`|dzLOoUn2aa	I am assuming that you are not a boy even though your nme is something like Brianna. If you are gay then well maybe you haven't found another gay person. Please note that I am not meaning any kind of offence to homsexuals in fact although I am not one I support them. Well if you are a girl and wonder why people don't like you is not because of the colour of your hair and probably not your weight (if your weight is what you have claimed it to be and by the way stick figuire and fat is a subjeective word in other words you might not judge yourself to be but ohers may do so). The problem is that people hardly even know that you exist. When I was in my first year of secondary school (when I was a book face) I would not have been known if it wasn't that the libaray did not open till 8:30am. So basically because i was very studious I had all my work done and I got to school at around 8-8:15am and read till the library opened and I could read peacefully. Apparently one day I  had finished my book on the bus when I got to school.There I was sitting there looking at all the other Year 7's do their "homeowrk" before class. Well apparently this guy on my right had answered a math's questions wrong do I pointed it out to him. his positive reply was o yeah thanks. Now I give up reading in the mornings helping others with ther work it got he a good reputation and loads of new friends who like me.In fact, a few boys had  things for m bt I turned them down because i didn't want that much attention. well the point is to do something that helps other and that is what will attract people to you.    Hoped I helped!

The bear total was $60: the bear itself was $18, $8 on a voice recorder to put inside, and the rest went to a little suit, sweater vest, sunglasses, and boots. The Sweater vest on eBay was $40. Every girl i tell this just thinks it's the cutest thing ever and want to be my valentine. This and I'm going to buy a dozen roses of course, 6 yellow and 6 red. The yellow roses represent friendship and red, of course, love.|`|tkOmi3vnaa	your best bet is to go with something that interests her!!

I mean even if we went out of our way to go learn something new what much can we do? to learn about other places the closest we have is the travel channel, if you want channels from other countries you need satellite or cable and if plus the news are the ones who are supposed to tell us about international affairs. and how is that supposed to happen when they censor the news? when two reporters tried to report that Monsanto was bad they pretty much got fired for it and they even lost the court case.     so yeah not much we can do about it    EDIT: Kenneth is right. 3rd world countries have no reason to complain about us.|`|jG7ejIZvaa	I'm flemish from europe.

The fact is that other countries aren't as ignorant as you might seem. Despite our wealth of educational resources, the average American citizen is ranked in the twenties compared to the rest of the word. A lot of Americans badmouth the French and other more liberal European countries (practically all European countries are more liberal than the US) for really stupid reasons ("they're wimps!" and stuff like that). In reality, Americans are a lot fatter than Asians. And of course the models won't be fat. That's just a given. IMO, Americans in general have morals, but a lot of them are rather silly.    You're being a bit hypocritical by saying that foreigners should base opinions on knowledge they "obviously lack". Their statements are not completely unfounded - trust me.

de61674560750ca671798a74d4f68053aa	1st of all, no one can turn another human being gay, which means sexual orientation is born that way, and no one can actually persuade or convince another individual to change his/ her sexual orientation.    2nd, it means that your straight male friends are kind of homophobic toward gay people, and you should change their perspective about that. If they don't listen, then you can just stop talking this gay friend/ roomme or yours, because they wouldn't want to listen. But on the other hand, it also means that those straight male friends of yours care about you, but the only problem is that they just can't accept the fact that homosexuality does exist in this society now and then.    3rd,your straight male friends probably just want you to make your choice, like whom you're gong to hang out with. And honestly, there's nothing wrong about hanging out with gay people, since most of them are nice people. But to your straight male friends, they probably don't want to be labeled as "they're having a friend that hangs out with gay people", and they think they are ashamed by that.  Well, it just simply explains that they are homophobes, that's all.    So I don't think you should actually be worried that much, because people have different perspectives toward everything, and you can't actually change that. What you can do is just not to mention James very often in front of your straight male friends, since they don't like it. And if they ask you about James, you just need to tell them that you're still straight and nothing can happen between you and him, since James said he would never fall for you, then everything should be fine.    At last, I am glad to know that you're such an open-minded person. And if gay people still keep flirting with you, saying things like "Sexy" or "Mr Straight" and stuff like that, what you can do is to thank them by giving such compliments to you. And since they know you're straight, you can still keep the friendship with them as the way it was, because you know that they can't take any chance, right?    Just chill out, and all the best to you.|`|cpoEP9Mcaa	The thing is, you're emotionally insecure, and have some faults.    Lack of compliments from girls, etc.|`|0121db3d89fa7258a5d230763048afc9aa	So did you enjoy that kiss? LOL *wink*    just kidding.     Anyways, yes it's fine. It's a compliment. And who dosen't like a compliment? Just because he's gay doesn't make you gay if he compliments you on your body and what not. But to the matter of kissing you. You seemed to react okay to that. Technically, that's fine. Though, it is strange that you WERE okay with it. Considering the fact you've known him for so long, feeling attracted to him wouldn't be unusual. He might just be your only male love, and that's fine. There's absolutely nothing wrong with that at all.     Yes, you are straight. But if you were to have some feelings for your friend, it would be perfectly natural.     Your straight friends need to grow up. Like you said, you are comfortable with your sexuality. Be proud of that. Not many guys are like you.|`|yXg1ojQoaa	if your straight buddies can't accept that you still want to remain friends with james and yourgay friends, then tell them to go find a new friend, you could ask james to not call you these things with your straight friends around. as long as your'e comfortable with your chosen sexuality you don't have any problems.|`|dkoGI9nfaa	From what you say all I can say you are a fantastic guy.  thanks for being so wonderful. I understand how you feel and I would feel exactly the same.  Even some gay guys get annoyed with that type of behaviour.  A friend of mine is totally gay, very masculine and does not want to be openly gay.  He is not half as good as you and will get quite nasty when other gay guys treat him like that.  So thank you for being great.  Please tell your mate that you love his company as well as that of his friends but that you don't like their behaviour, that they are putting you in a predicament where you don't want to be forced to choose between him and your straight friends.  Maybe you need to use the phrase "Please help me to hlp you".  You are helping him when his own family has rejected him.  I think it is fair to expect him to appreciate what you are to him and what you are doing for him.  thanks for being a non homophobic person.|`|hwU36Vgdaa	your such a good friend! He may like u, so what u sound like an amazing person. he knows ur straight. take the flirting and words he says to u all in fun and compliments. who cares what ur other beefy headed guy friends think! xoxo ~lesbian|`|q5m9g1yWaa	lmao, "I love being wrapped by your strong arms, Mr. Straight."|`|LX3IqQ3Caa	HaHa I Have A Friend Whose The Exact Same  Way And Straighter Than Straight Honestly  I Don't See Nothing Wrong With It, Most  Straight Guys Who Are Fine With Gay  Guys Giving Them Compliments Think  Of It As Hey If Both Sexes Think  I'm Hot Then I Really Must Be!    It's Fine Don't Get Too Worked  Up Over It|`|LuXq0Ja4aa	Well it seems to me as though your "straight buddies" aren't very tolerant people. They seem to be deterred by the idea of you turning out gay- which you aren't, but hypothetically if you ended up coming out in the future, they wouldn't support you. I believe that is an undesirable characteristic in a friend.     Conversely, the only issue with the gay friends is that you're kinda leading them on... Which isn't bad, because no consequences have risen.     I would therefor suggest that perhaps the loss of your straight friends in order to keep your gay ones is the way to go. Think about it. The gay ones could be there for you regardless of who you are or how you act, but your straight ones are judgmental and won't necessarily support you to the fullest.    Anyway, this is just my opinion from what you've said...  Hopefully it helps :)|`|b9082e593baa61d6020c92bab2fa8deaaa	I am shocked that you are comfortable enough with yourself to  hang around gay men so much. I have neve met a straight man before who didn't cringe at the thought that a gay man might find him sexy. I have to applaud you!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  In order for you to keep your straight male friends, you some how need to explain that you find their friendships just as meaningful as your gays friendships. If any doesn't like it, he is free to hit the road.You are open minded and don't need their crap in your life.   I must say I am surprised and quite proud of how your folks raised you.Have a grreat life.|`|DaYmkqe3aa	hahahahaha, that's cute|`|AA12225622	Your basic question is what should I do, correct?    My suggestions is to keep working on your writing skills, because I find it hard to believe that someone would sign up to this forum, today, to write this really hot gay fantasy.    Why do I think that, because, when I was 24 I knew what all of my male friends looked like naked.  It was the late '70's, early '80's and sitting in the hot tub naked was the thing to do, but, never did we ever shower with one another, unless it was in a locker room.  Your story does not make that distinction.    But that is just me thinking on the keyboard.|`|JgNMqaPmaa	wow i wish all straight guys were like u|`|MvmuZMG4aa	I would never have the guts to tell a straight guy all those things that your best bud tells you... lol.|`|6Qq1dCCCaa	Baby, I accept my chocolate milk and so should you.|`|0uj7DqlZaa	As long as you are comfortable and your friend hasn't crossed any lines to change that there is no problem.  Your so called straight friends need to step.  No on is calling them "Sexy"  They need to respect that if a line is crossed the you would handle it.

XCTUmHPLaa	i doubt bcoz shias has their imams to follow    their imam is the final authority ,who is indfallible .    giving some one a rank or status of infallible apointed by Allah,itself wrong bcoz this makes that person ,a being who should be followed blindly .    and this is kufr,bcoz Islam clearly states that there is no prophet after him.meaning no one should be followed blindly     Abu bakr(RA) said in his speech ,follow me as long as i am following QUran And Sunnah,and straighten me if i go wrong .    Omar (RA) also took his decision, about dowry, back when   an olad lday told him ayah quran.    so thats a spirit of last prophet hood .|`|efb24eedcf484b875157731a08fef57aaa	I do not understand your point, Shia Muslims have always, always followed the teaching of the Prophet Muhammad (SAW).    Have we not established that already? Your question does not make any sense.|`|AA10548244	its funny because people talk without knowing what being a shia is all about. THEY'RE NOT FROM A DIFFERENT RELIGION..and they love prophet mohamed S.A.W. more than anyone one else..and they love imam ali and imam hussein because they are from the prophet's family.     You get kicked out of islam automatically when calling another muslim a "kafir"...    read enough about shiites before even talking about them    stay away from rumers and the ignorance...    shiites never compare any of the imams with the prophet mohamed s.a.w.    whatever u hear is all ignorance.. people say bad things about islam..and doesnt mean its true..|`|88fHI3xDaa	i think it is better way that shia murtid with allying directly to jews and chirstian because some simple and honest muslim can see their orignal face|`|deTJcdv9aa	i agree with Maria  during the time of Mohamed there was no shia nor sunni  only muslims? these terms are new school of thoughts.
uSFS3BETaa	Ok, so you understand the rules so far, so there really isnt much explanation as to 'why' it is that way. For other example sentences you can take the sentence:  Gibst du Katja ein Schenk mit rot worter.  To answer this question using pronouns it would be done as so:  Ja, ich gebe es ihr.  I think in your question you mixed up the words preposition with pronoun. Es is a pronoun while something like mit is a preposition. 'It'-pronoun (renames the noun) and 'with'-preposition (introduces prepositional phrases).    If you have any other questions please ask, i hope this is what you were wondering about... i was a little confused by the question.

One day (27 and still married) I looked at a close friend and imagined her for the 1st time in her sexy undies. Shocked me to the core but then I understood my lack of 'butterflies' in my marriage. Went to a gay center and talked to a young fella, felt more sure of my feelings than ever before, got divorced and never looked back. Been checking out the ladies ever since. I'll be 60 this month and still looking.  (BIG SMILE!)  In order for you to understand your feelings, it would help if you were around people who would understand without any prejudice or pressure. Contact your local gay center and PFLAG.ORG (a wonderful org that helps keep families with LGBT members together with love and support) They will have contacts for you for gay friendly counselors. The also have monthly meetings. The websites are great (like YA) but you want to MEET other gay people. See if there is a coming out group (men and women, all women, young women, mature women). Share your story, your feelings. You will find others who are going thru the same journey. Coming out can be scary but don't stay in the closet if you do realize you're are gay. Get out there (when it's safe for you) and meet people.  There is a whole world waiting out there. In the meantime you're feeling lost and lonely. Call the 2 organizations asap and you'll be on your way to discovering your authentic self. I am not saying you must be gay just because you have thought about it. I am saying get out there and find your true self.  Don't waste another day.    Have a great life.|`|TpsiOzCIaa	Thegyc.com is a good website for this situation.    If you seriously do want to come out, then you should slowly come out to friends and/or family, one at a time.    The first person you come out to is always the hardest, unless you're coming out to some homophobic person.    Good luck.|`|q5m9g1yWaa	Well, I knew I was at least bisexual since middle school. I had a huge crush on my best friend, and from then on I started liking other girls too. I actually didn't realize I was a lesbian until like, 2 months ago. I still think guys are hot. I've made out with guys and had boyfriends before, but it was always disgusting, lol.     Then I started talking to this guy I liked through a friend. We talked on the phone every day and every night, and I seriously thought I was starting to fall in love with him. And then when I met him, it finally hit me. I DON'T LIKE PENIS.    And then I knew.|`|c48266c8f34bb8cf1a945602db2ffb33aa	I don't know how or when you know.....  you just know.  If guys are not giving you the feeling of euphoria, and making you want to shout to the world, then go all the way with a girl.  You'll know soon enough.  As far as coming out, I never really came out, as far as saying it to anyone.  If asked, I would tell them, but most people don't just ask.  Anyway, think of it this way.... you mom & dad don't report to you what they do in their bedroom, so why do you feel inclined to tell them what you do in yours?  I always tell people to let them ask you... because at that point they have already gave it some thought and it won't shock them as bad.  Good Luck!

To go to heaven you admit that you have sinned.  You realize that sin cannot enter a perfect heaven so you cannot go in.  Jesus came and lived a perfect life without sin.  He died sacrificing His perfect life on the cross so that by the spilling of His blood we can have our sins removed.  We can go to heaven.  This is a gift freely given to us, all we do is believe and say yes,  I accept the free gift of salvation from Jesus.  Believe.  Get a Bible and read starting in the New Testament.

Beyond its ordinary meaning of human life, Jesus used "life" to signify a share in his own divine Trinitarian existence, which becomes possible for those who respond to his invitation to turn away from sin and open their hearts to God's abiding love.    Eternal life signifies that this gift will last forever in the blessedness of heaven. This gift of God begins with the "life" of faith and "new life" of Baptism, is communicated in sanctifying grace, and reaches perfection in the communion of life and love with the Holy Trinity in heaven.|`|iAw1q6kbaa	be the best you can be|`|GV7Z0JRiaa	TIME IS THE FIRE IN WHICH WE BURN!

You find it in loving others and helping your neighbor.|`|8CWBIKRZaa	If you believe in God then maybe you could look at it as a test. When I believed in God I always thought that life, which we really don't keep anything from it except memories which fade anyways, is a test to see if we are worthy of heaven and of him. Then again this also brings up the question and why he tests us when he supposdly knows every outcome.    Other than that I guess life could also just be something of his gone wrong. He created us expecting us to be loyal and when we betray him he finds out that some of us don't deserve eternal happiness which leads back to the whole test idea.
CCf6Y7DIaa	jesus christ, stop mothering this kid! he is resentful because you are unjustly trying to protect him, which robs him of the opportunity to defend yourself -and of course, your defense of him is naturally imperfect.     at some point, tell this kid that he is grown up and from that point on, stop defending him and trying to make everyone else consider his feelings; unless there is some gross inequity here (and i don't see it, other than you acting like this boy's overprotective mother), that is solely his job, his responsibility and his role as a man which he must grow into. kids have to be given a chance to grow up; they don't just suddenly change one day out of the blue.    this is a very well known and very well understood pattern. those who are shielded from needing to defend themselves will always be resentful to those who shielded them because they were unable to learn how to defend themselves -and at the same time, do learn un-useful patterns to rely upon others. the kid doesn't know what to feel -you are defending him, but your defense is imperfect. the kid knows he should stand up for himself, but he doesn't know if he has the right. he is angry at you and himself because he does not know what to do -and if he does perceive that you are overprotective of him, the question becomes, how can he be angry against someone who is 'helping' him? so there is more self loathing on top of all the confusion and hurt -and because you caused it all and you are older, if the kid is immature, there will be even more hate and rage toward you.    he can hate and be angry against someone who means well because you are not really helping him -not with your imperfect defense and not by teaching this kid to rely upon you and not stand up for himself. you are robbing him of choice, personal power as well as a learning opportunity. please stop before your brother gets too old and turns into one of those kids with a self-entitlement complex.     -next time, don't say a word when you sense an inequity building, and wait for your brother to defend himself. then, to him and only to him, praise his decision and independence in standing up for himself and offer guidance if his method was wrong. TEACH him. do not defend this child any more, unless you want him to be even more resentful towards you.|`|yYg4gKwxaa	just keep on talking to you brother until he gets over it, that's just how it is.|`|z93tSvKxaa	Can you just give us a brief synopsis?

Start with "Dear Mr. so and so" (Dear Sir is too impersonal being that you know his name and are dating his daughter.)  Basically go on to say that you are apologetic and specifically state what you are apologizing for.   Don't make excuses for yourself but maybe a quick one sentence about why you did it or how you didn't mean it to come off as disrespectful.   Close it with something sincere like hoping he'll accept your apology and understanding if he doesn't.   Sign it "respectfully" or "humbly"|`|KHC2oE8iaa	daaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaamn boy. what the hell did you do??? man i'm sorry for you. do not use the word sorry. nobody wants to here your sorry. trust me. say you apologize for saying something so idiotic and stupid. not to long just two paragraphs. one for the mama and one for the baby. you talked about their kid???? daaaaamn.|`|NkGwKgZAaa	A letter might show the dad that youre scared.

j5aTwTtvaa	I agree with Leslie.    Another expression with a similar meaning is:    I can't read sheet music to save my life.    They all emphasize the fact that you just can't do something. Sort of *I REALLY can't read sheet music* or  *no matter how hard I might try I wouldn't be able to do it*.    Thassa|`|aX6RFBV5aa	it's like saying, "I can't read sheet music if my life depended on it"    I don't think I've ever heard it phrased that way but there's also: "for the love of christ" and "for the life of me" which are basically exasperated/upset ways of saying "OMG did that really just happen (or, do I really have to go through with this)?"|`|i738zS9taa	Traditionally people would say "for the love of God" as in, even if 'the most important thing' (love of God) were to depend on it, I still couldn't do it.    That sounds a just a bit serious, so in this case "for the love of me" is kind of making fun of the original saying, implying that "me" is the most important thing, ever. The author is being pretty informal.      (This is different from "For the love of God, what have you done??!!" where "for the love of X" is used just to make the request that comes next ("what have you done") very, very important.  Often used as a parody:  "For the love of all that's holy, tell me right now!!!"  "For the love of my great-grandmother's apple pie, will you stop doing that!")    Basically, adding a "for the love of X" phrase adds major emphasis to what you're saying.
c48266c8f34bb8cf1a945602db2ffb33aa	Wow, you are bold for asking this on here....  but here goes,       The female impersonators that I have known well enough to talk about that subject, didn't push their testes up into themselves.  Rather they made a foam rubber form that covered their pubic area and trailed between their legs to provide a smooth appearance once covered with multiple layers of panty hose.  They also arranged their testes one in front of the other rather than side by side.  I wish I had some pictures to share but they would probably be considered porn, so maybe it's good that I don't.  I used to help them get dressed, so I got an education early on...  Good Luck!|`|2lim0SHvaa	On either side of the base of your penis.  But not neccessary.

dM5a6Pm7aa	that's really not realistic at all, to be honest  the first two weeks of weight loss you are likely to lose about 3-5 pounds (this is with eating healthy and plenty of exercise).  and if you continue well, really keep it up and focus on losing weight, you could lose about 5 pounds a week.  but really to expect more would be setting yourself up for disappointment.|`|M9LLimOYaa	unrealistic sorry. if there were a way.. id do it too!

Just an idea, like I said I don't know the situation.|`|Kh5o3QCcaa	I call out every lie I hear, and I have had few people fess up to it.  It's an ego thing- not just their not admitting it, but the lie itself.    In my experience, people will make up their own minds.  But I will tell you: ten years after my worst experience with it, the majority of people surrounding the issue now know from their own experience with this person that I was right.    Also it's good to remember that people never have to own up to their crap these days, so when somebody has the... well, you know, to call them out they have nothing to do but pretend it didn't happen.    Don't worry about what everybody else is thinking.  If this person is a liar, their true colors will show.  In the mean time, you know you did the right thing.

Some aimed to establish a Chirstian society, according to their particular vision, and built their aims into their legal and educational system. So English Puritans settled in New England, and tried to shape society according to their ideals.     Russian Orthodox Christians evangelised the natives of Alaska -- Eskimos, Aleuts and Indians, and Orhtodoxy became part of Aleut culture, especially. When the US took over Alaska in 1867 they govenrment sent Protestant missionaries to try to destroy the Orthodox culture of the Aleuts and Anglicise them.     So there were different visions of what constituted Christian culture, and sometimes these visions clashed, but even the clashes helped to shape US culture.

The above verse speaks a lot about who Jesus really is.    There are a lot more chapters and verses mentioned in the below website along with music, speeches and praise and worship.    http://jesustrinity.blogspot.com    Jesus is God. He is alive forever.    The questions usually asked are:-    1) Did Jesus really exist?  2) Is Jesus God?  3) If Jesus is God, then why did He keep praying to the Father in Heaven? How can the Father and Jesus be one God? Why did Jesus have to suffer on the Cross?  4) What is the Holy Spirit?  5) What is so special about Jesus? Why cant I just view him as an ordinary man or a teacher or a prophet? Why should I see him as God?      It would not be possible to give a short answer to these questions .    I suggest you visit the below website.    After visiting the below website, you would get a lot of answers.    http://jesustrinity.blogspot.com    1.Thomas calls Jesus God in John 20:28 (Note, Thomas addresses Jesus  specifically.)  2. Jesus is God in Heb. 1:8  3. John the apostle states that Jesus was the Word which was God that became  flesh (John 1:1-14)  4. The phrase "Call upon the name of the LORD" (Hebrew, YHWH, i.e., Psalm  116:4) used only of God on the OT, and translated into the Greek in the LXX as  "Call upon the name of the LORD (greek, KURIOS)," applied to Jesus in the NT  (1 Cor. 1:2) Jesus is God in flesh  5. The apostle John says that Jesus was , "...calling God His own Father,  making Himself equal to God," (John 5:18)  6. Jesus said that He and the Father are One (John 10:30), that caused the Pharisees to  claim that Jesus was making Himself out to be God.  7. Jesus knew all things (John 21:17)  8. Jesus knew all men (John 16:30)  9. Jesus is everywhere (Matt. 28:20)  10. Jesus Christ, dwells in you (Col. 1:27)  11. Jesus is the exact representation of the Nature of God (Heb. 1:3)  12. Jesus is eternal (Micah 5:1-2)  13. Jesus gives eternal life (John 10:27-28)  14. Jesus is our only Lord and Master (Jude 4)  15. Jesus is called the Mighty God (Isaiah 9:6)  16.

Jesus is worshiped (Matt. 2:2-11; Matt.14:33; Matt.28:9; John 9:35-38;  Heb. 1:6) Only God can be worshipped (Matt. 4:10) (same Greek word for worship  is used in each place.)  21. In the OT God was seen (Exodus 6:2-3;Exodus 24:9-11; Num. 12:6-9; Acts  7:2), yet no man can see God (Exodus 33:20; John 1:18). It was not the Father  that was seen in the OT (John 6:46). Who, then were they seeing? See John  8:58.  22. Jesus claimed the divine name, "I AM", for Himself in John 8:58 see  Exodus 3:14.  23. Jesus says you must honor him even as you honor the Father (John 5:23).  24. Jesus gives life (John 5:21).  25. Jesus bears witness of Himself (John 8:18;John 14:6).  26.

3fd2288554aaf55a30c81ff30a54bba2aa	For many government jobs, no mental disability should specifically disqualify you because of the Americans with Disabilities act, if you are an american.  Some jobs require you to carry a gun, so there may be restrictions there depending on what state you live in and what your treatment background is, and some jobs do background checks, and you may not pass muster on some of that due to your disability, depending on what it is.  But if you want to be a postal carrier, or a receptionist at the social security office, etc., the ADA should protect you.  I imagine other countries have similar protections in place, as america is usually behind the boat on that stuff.|`|GtxnGKoAaa	OPM doesn't state anything specifically about mental disabilities. Of course you can't be insane. If I were you I would be more concerned about my credit history and background check.

c48266c8f34bb8cf1a945602db2ffb33aa	If you really trust your boyfriend, and truly want him to be happy, no matter what.... why don't you ask him if he would like to try a threesome with his friend as the third, or tell him you would like a threesome with his friend as the third.        If he agrees with it, at least you'll have your questions answered, and it will give you some control over it, if not he may just keep sneaking around.  Good Luck!|`|Vu726Q18aa	ask him. If you loved your bf youd really wounld care youd trust him with anyone|`|f2xhXmxmaa	Your boyfriend is this other guys lover...plain and simple. They were together before you came along and they will remain lovers until the other guy refuses to let him date women anymore. He is only with you to put up a front so no one will know who he really is. Just explain to your child that his father is gay and move on. Make sure you stress to your child that cheating is wrong...but that being gay is fine.|`|b9082e593baa61d6020c92bab2fa8deaaa	You may have hit the nail on the head and he just can't acknowledge it. A counselor might be able to help  you discuss this. Contact your local gay center or PFLAG.ORG and ask for a gay friendly counselor so there is no prejudice or pressure.      Considerations  If he has been sexual with his guy friend, it could be dangerous for your health.   If he needs to be with another guy, it is better to get it out in the open now, before you have more pain and have to tell your daughter.    I wish you all the best.
hTlzSCYlaa	You are a spiritual person, one who believes in God.|`|YZv8Ub3Haa	Deist? Pantheist?    Look up deism and pantheism.|`|eO2rnf7yaa	I am Roman Catholic.  It seems to me that you are wondering more than believing.  What does the word "god" mean to you?  How can a being be "god-like"?  What's the origin of the bacteria you mentioned?  How could bacteria become anything other than more complex bacteria?  What's fate?    If there is a name for "your beliefs", knowing that name seems to me unlikely to automatically add much to the clarity of what you believe.    It seems to me that you like to wonder.  I think you should read more.  You'll wonder better if you do,  and your wondering might ultimately lead you to the Truth.    I think you would have some useful and enjoyable wondering to do if you read a book written by Thomas Dubay  the title is: "The Evidential Power of Reason, Science and Theology Meet."    Peace be with you.|`|wnI04x8Kaa	your beliefs remind me of the Manson Family, a quasi-commune that arose in California in the latter 1960s|`|U8QQkeQ4aa	I think this requires more detail.  There are many people in the many different religions who have a separate set of core beliefs.    I call myself "spiritual but not religious" for any reasons but mostly because none of my beliefs exactly match a religion out there, Unitarians come close.  I believe in one God but I also believe in aliens, evolution and I do not believe in the Bible or any other scriptures.    Of course, you do not have to be "spiritual but not religious" but if you really are torn, then just be who you want to be.  Labels are overrated|`|dl97DmmYaa	Charles Darwin's evolution theory.|`|9YzgrwoQaa	Spiritual; great for you!! You are able to use all three mind body and soul; don't let label fall on you. Einstein wanted to know God's thoughts E=MC2 isn't chance. Find truth, stick with the good fight; don't let the theologian's fool you into believing the donkey spoke.|`|M6VcuiyDaa	You sound like you are a deist.    However deist is a very general term so your personal beliefs are your own.|`|tACJnpI1aa	Well, it could be deism if you think that God did this creating, and then left and has nothing to do with us.|`|gEOVHZcVaa	mental retardationism|`|Z92LPUqaaa	Well you are definitely a theist.  I don't think you belong to any religious group and your description is fairly vague to pinpoint if you belong to a religious group.  I would just categorize you as a theist.|`|AA10329469	Why a name?Your belief is as good as any name.|`|aNycRVC9aa	I love how that Jill chick is throwing out all these hell threats to every question. Isn't that going against some religious beliefs of some sort? Even if it isn't, it's rude.    Edit:  I'm atheist but I strongly believe in fate. Strange, eh?|`|VkAu2KDdaa	deist or agnostic|`|FvfxFDIRaa	willbrninhellsoonism|`|pyOz3ogPaa	Deist with some.....different beliefs.|`|itroxygvaa	Islam in regards of your belief in fate, but not in regards to evolution.  We believe God created the heavens and earth and all in between.  First human being God created was Adam peace be upon him.|`|E6bKH0UAaa	Wow...that last answer was mature. Whatever. Don't listen to closed minded people.    ...I think your beliefs border on agnostic... I'm agnostic, and I believe there's a higher power. It looks like you believe in evolution too. I don't think the fate thing is relevant, but...if I had to choose something for you, I would say agnostic. But i don't think you need to choose a name for what you believe. You can have beliefs without a name. Because I think you believe an eclectic belief system, as many people do.|`|NNmuZw1Kaa	we cant just believe without a proof right...
hZ9omSataa	I don't concern myself with saving the world, only ppl that want glory do that, I enjoy my one @ a time missions...:)|`|0e0a0f1828f99f87ea3d5e5bc8cbd46daa	I agree with wyndorf. I like helping people one at a time. My favorite website is "Wish Upon A Hero". It allows me to grant wishes daily.|`|2Ccfsy9Maa	I wouldn't go with the ruler of the world power mogul, that never works and there will always be something that needs to be fixed or someone trying to stop you from becoming ruler or you values get corrupted along the way. I would do it a little at a time and I am trying to make the world a better place by instilling values in my children such as compassion for their fellow humans, doing my part in caring for others in need. So I guess I fall under the belief that every little bit helps and if we all chipped in the problems would be solved.
iYBvVUgyaa	Uh-lee-sha  I think
QR5HbJQ0aa	http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=47N37nC01...    there is almost no difference infact they used to believe that in humans that the bones and flesh grew at the same time, but the Qur'an said bones first then flesh, which was considered a contradiction at that time, until with advanced microscopes they found the Qur'an was right.    Yeah it's so vague thats why it describes the embryos in 6 different stages....    EDIT: Lol when was the last time you were in a science class. bones form first then flesh..... It's only logical?|`|gBoUrlrKaa	The verses in the Quran are intentionally vague to avoid getting it wrong.|`|806025c44dd8e27b6c1d544348b087c0aa	The Quran's version of fetal development is vague and incorrect, anyway.  And no, the bones do NOT form first.      Further, anything that needs extensive writings about what it is saying isn't really saying it to begin with, or else it wouldn't need the extensive writings to explain it.
269rOoUUaa	I never knew these were listed anywhere specifically. My girlfriends and I discussed this a one point but I have never seen where they were listed as a "tier' in Wicca. Ok, so think of them this way- when you have earth and air together, which is NE, you would have? Dust! SE would be smoke- air and fire, SW would be steam for fire and water, then NW would be mud for water and earth. Just follow the logic. Like I said, I have never actually seen these listed specifically somehwere, but we had dreams and some messages from spirits we were working with about this. It was kind of fun plotting it out. Woking out the underused directions and such. Hope this helps. Blessings!!|`|dFBccLExaa	As far as I know, there is nothing specifically for the cross quarters of the compass. You could always make something up, or just view one element blending into the other.
BNlSh53faa	What's the alternative.  I'm 69.  I hope that you'll do something with your life that will count so that at the end you'll never have to do the refrain "doesn't getting old suck."|`|0e0a0f1828f99f87ea3d5e5bc8cbd46daa	Yup...just wait until you reach your 40's...Like Me. If it sucks at 19, it will get progressively worse, later.|`|hZ9omSataa	yeah, but things get better....I am happier now than I was as a kid, or a teen, or even in my 20's.|`|HGVbrbNSaa	You get old when your bones stiffen up - you are no where near that yet! There is only one sure thing in life and that is change. There is the good and there is the bad - it is your attitude that makes the difference. And the people you mix with. If they are all dull and uninteresting, you will be too. If they are busy and challenged - you will be too.|`|qjCZs9M7aa	I feel the same and it sucks ! The feeling is horrible and there is no word in any language to describe it.|`|4FFJNNjnaa	<agrees with lar.   At 61, I don't give a **** what others think.  I'm happy, lived a good life, expect to continue to live well and prosper, and to learn.|`|2Ccfsy9Maa	Your not 'old' just older, your life will go through periods of change, some turn out good, some don't. At 19, your fixing to fly solo and it might be a little bumpy not all chicks make it the first time but just think of when you wished as a younger teen you could make your own rules, well now you can, it isn't as righteous as you thought it would be, but the next chapter the 20's usually rock, then the 30's where you settle down into the adult thing usually getting married and having kids if you haven't started that already, then the 40's where you work your butt off to afford the finer things in life , then the 50's where for a brief time you enjoy life looking forward to retirement unless the body or mind has crapped out on you, then the 60's with grand-kids being spoiled rotten and all the aches and pains from all the fun you had when you were younger, and so on and so forth. The answer is to live each day like it could be your last, love much, laugh often and don't stress over the small stuff. Who ever wants to grow up and who says you have to? Good luck on life's wild ride.
AQPmrsVSaa	As scary as those kinds of dreams are, they signify change more often than anything half as ominous as they seem to. When you're going through a major change, like say, a change in your relationship with someone close to you (somebody moving in/out/away, for one) then your subconscious mind can kind of perceive it as the "death" of your relationship's previous state. (Or the previous circumstances of anything that's now undergoing change.)    And, since dreams are usually just a jumble of information in your memory/subconscious mind getting tossed together, it can just as easily mean nothing. Don't worry so much! They're more likely to go away when you stop dwelling on how freaky they are.|`|yqUgRG2raa	Sounds like you don't feel in control of your life. Perhaps, PTSD, have you been in some extreme situation before the dreams started.|`|aNycRVC9aa	sounds like someone is pregnant!|`|AA11494685	I really don't know how to interpret dreams but dreams are our subconscious minds.  Maybe you are having trouble at home or with your studies or friends.  You will have to check that out. Alternately your tummy needs to be cleaned out.|`|d7311ef8a7db3a2d7bda7c310f13691caa	well, death in dreams generally means Change. perhaps your life is changing and you feel you have no control over it.        PS wile = while|`|fwsZaIbraa	you just have to pray over it and it will go in no time.|`|VdifDUGkaa	you are feeling helpless and incapable of controlling some situation. These are basically stress dreams and finding the source of the stress and getting rid of it would eradicate the dreams, at least to some extent. Is your job fulfilling, are things ok between you and your family members or you and your gf? if yes, this could be stress from a health-related condition, otherwise it's probably a manifestation of your dissatisfaction with whatever is troubling you. You need to stop bottling up all your difficulties and talk things through with others instead, most especially those people you find dying in the dreams.
rcPnnfmmaa	Does Jesus count?    And the first responder has the censored version of Aphrodite's origins. She sprang from the severed testicles of Ouranos when they landed in the ocean. Born is a relative term.    Also if that counts Zeus birthed Athena out of his forehead.|`|9vTWgiGgaa	Gorgon Medusa.|`|bM9Y79wHaa	In Greek mythology the goddess of love (Aphrodite) was born from like sea foam.|`|0d9146a1d3a0724397992a1b2ed9f5cdaa	Well, let's see.....    Hercules  Ajax  Apollo  Jesus of Nazareth  Quetzalcoatl  Minerva  Anakin Skywalker  Mentor  Prometheus    That's all I can come up with for right now.|`|aHaZ1IcHaa	in the ancient world saying that somebody was born of divine patrilineage, and with no human father, was a way of saying a person who transcended his biological place in the world.    imagine if you had a child like Hercules.  So different from the other children.  So different from you.  Clearly this is not the kind of son who will profit you in your old age by taking over the family farm.  He has a bigger destiny than that.    'Where does all that strength come from?' people will ask.  Not from ordinary old you, that's certain.  Was it the postman?  But he is ordinary too.  No one around here has ever seen ANYTHING like Hercules.  Why, Zeus, King of the Gods Himself must have come down to earth and provided your wife with seed one night when you weren't looking.    Even today, a man who stands on his own and does something great must appear to be born of inexplicable or unlikely circumstances.  You could never get up on stage to accept the Nobel Prize with your father there telling you to stand up straight and tuck in your shirt.  It is an imperative that exists still.  Heroes, men of action, must stand alone.|`|513DGClraa	Jesus?|`|cTKrByOzaa	Bri emerged from the frozen wastes of Niflheim  Ymir was created when Niflheim and Muspelheim collided  Kvasir was formed from the spit of the Aesir and Vanir mixed with mead  Ask and Embla were carved from trees    And that's just Norse myth.
cNniG2L0aa	"The biggest problem between science and religion is the period"    Nah; it's invisible sky critters.  Godsters rely on invisible sky critters for everything.  Scientists rely on invisible sky critters for nothing.    An invisible sky critter didn't wake up one morning with a hangover after a heavy night on the juice AND, needing something to kick, create us and cats.    Ive discovered that it all boils down to brain wiring: your brain is wired to worship magic or it isnt, either its wired to utilize logic or it isnt, either its analytical of myths or it isnt.  ~|`|yqUgRG2raa	I would like to add that it seems to me that Genesis chapter 1 is contracting and expanding time. In this manner, it is like a heart or lungs, thus it is alive, in words. 31 verses less the opening verse less 6 days is 24 hours which is divided by 2(heaven/earth) is 12 months. Even 24 divided by the 6 days is 4 billion, the age of the earth.|`|91XGHfSaaa	Why make it more complicated than it has to be?     Time is a human construct - it doesn't exist per se.    The Bible is a human construct - most of what it records never happened.    Science uses human time - because scientists are humans.|`|MUC8vWjvaa	very well worded. And actually its about 23 hours and 57 minutes, we just round up and thats what creates a leap year.|`|1iXvphNYaa	Have bong, will travel.
AA11198190	Honestly......they are the landlords from hell.  l would be looking elswhere to live.|`|RXI8ImdIaa	You've got a persnickety property manager, or whatever this lady's position is.    If your feelings are being hurt, then yes you are being too sensitive. There are people like this in the world, they take their position seriously and to hell with anyone who stands in their way.    You seem to be dealing with her in a positive and constructive way, so just don't let it get to you when she continues to be surly. You're not going to change her demeanor. Just remember your own rights and don't allow people to take advantage of your kindness.|`|Kh5o3QCcaa	First, look at the landlords responsibilities for your state (I am positive a faulty window will be in it) and there should be a VERY short time line for him to fix it.  Since they are already being jerks, turn him in with out asking him to fix it again.  You shouldn't have to harass him to fix, one time is all it should take.    It sounds to me like they are bored, and are thinking they are just a little bit cooler and more empowered than they should for just being landlords.    You are the tenet, you are paying them to live there- which means they are there for YOUR convienience.  Not saying to walk on them, but put your foot down, and show them that you do not have to take their crap.|`|7f8043a704578fc1b8d7f0f395c95c08aa	Sounds like someone that has nothing better to do than micromanage their property.    I'd look for somewhere else to live, or perhaps put a plaque in clear view of the office that says, "YOU'RE WELCOME."|`|1bkiNiwzaa	No there seems to be something wrong with these caretakers.It would put anyone off.  Look for a solution, if you can't find any, you'll just have to accept it/ignore it.But not let your rights be messed with.|`|d8zxbKduaa	They haven't done anything illegal. They are just picky and snooty, I guess. You will have to put up with it (it's never going to end) or move. Next time you do move I would talk to the present residents before signing the lease to get an idea of what the landlords are like. I have had my share of nasty landlords my self. Good ones are hard to find I think.
2LZbzvY3aa	lol      interesting question.  I truly believe money is the root of all evils in this world, but no... i don't think it should be illegal.  Too bad there's no way to regulate if you have a certain amount of income you must donate some of it to charity|`|GnKsUHUmaa	We live in a meritocratic society where we get what we work for. Sometimes we don't get the rewards we think we deserve e.g. doctors and nurses being paid less than footballers. Rich people have worked hard for what they have so it's not fair for them not to be rewarded.|`|806025c44dd8e27b6c1d544348b087c0aa	No.  That is the reward for hard work and education.    Even if it is through an inheritance, at some point, someone in the family worked extremely hard for it, and the family has the right to it.    If you think it should be illegal for rich people to be rich, you need to go live in a communist country.  The government there will be happy to keep you and your fellow comrades poor.|`|jbE1nWqzaa	No.But...its how they become rich.|`|cpoEP9Mcaa	No, the guy that works in the factory obviously worked not as hard as the guy with the Camaro and 6 digit income.    The dolts that cry about people being rich were the lazy ones in high school.|`|ac1a592a254aff116a1f945b83be5e94aa	yea and illegal for people to post stupid questions too|`|taG5ncs5aa	Haha. I wish.  But on a serious note, I think they should pay more taxes.|`|Pzdt9MoSaa	they tried that in russia.    it's called marxism and it's a nice idea on paper, but in the end some people will always have more than others.  and everyone wants to have the chance to be more significant than everyone else or why not just be a plant?|`|ytLvToBUaa	Depends on how they get rich and how rich they are. If they get rich by paying the guys who do all the work too little to live well, then yes, And if they are so rich that there is no way anyone else could compete, then yes. But These are more directed toward the kind of person, rather than the amount of money. I have met good decent rich people, I know they exist, but the ones who Complain that their taxes will be going up from 36% to 39% are bad people, because even though they have many times the amount that us poor people are forced to live off of, they can not stand having to lose a single cent to help those of us who are not well off.|`|Yj4HoiYEaa	no as long as they didnt get rich by stealing|`|6YUxk7TDaa	It depends on "how" they got there.
ENyb91iKaa	Feel Like making love by Bad Company     it has alot of wonderfully romantic lines plus a nice chorus    ex. "if had the sun and moon, I would give you both night and day.

I think you should do something really sweet for her. Instead of calling and planning (which would probably remind her of you cancelling) maybe you should just cook something for her and surprise her. I'm sure she likes you just as much as you like her, it sounds like she just needs a little reassurance before she decides if she really wants to pursue it or not.    I hope this helps|`|G3VUDedjaa	email her a link to this thread to show her that you really care|`|U6gz8qUcaa	call her up again and ask her out again, tell her (in a jokey way) she has no choice but to meet u, word it how you want but make sure she both knows your being serious but in a funny way.    and make sure this time you dont post pone or anything!.    another trick is go out with your mates to a bar she regulars at on a night out, and 'accidently' bump into her, and just be sweet all night to her then ask her out again.    heres a rough convo of what i used with an ex (she wasnt my g/f at the time)    Me: Hey  Her: you alright?  Me: No  Her: whats up?  Me: im hungry on friday, so we are going for dinner  Her: Im busy friday night  Me: thats ok im really hungry ill probably eat fast  Her: *laughing* ok can you hold out till saturday night instead?    (extremely rough idea of how the convo went, i did say the hungry stuff but probably more was said, but its just a vauge idea of serious/funny.)|`|6dP60V3zaa	due to the canceled lunch see may feel that you don't like her or are trying to make excuses not to see her, just reassure her that you do like her and that you plan on seeing her again.

HlFzl1piaa	Why was prayers for Mohammad's life to be spared not answered, but Allah went through a lot of trouble to put Essa's face on another man in order to save his life, and then Essa with his body ascended to Allah, but Mohammad did not?  Why so much trouble for a "prophet", and none at all for the most important "prophet"?  important note: According to the Hadiths the angel Gabriel/Jibraeel, prayed for Mohammad.

How the Allah of Islam could be the perfect righteous God of Abraham but all of his perfect teachings are corrupt and he is now in agreement with the serpent in the garden who is called Satan.    How  Muhammad spoke with a spirit he thought was a demon and only had corrupt scriptures with which to test this spriit that disagreed with the word of God but somehow Muhammad  is still accepted as a prophet of God against the teachings of the word of God and the  prophets of God.    How Muslims claim the Bible is corrupt and that the Bible proves their prophet.    How a righteous God who does not weigh or overlook sin but says the wages of sinis death and provided an atonement to bring his creation to his righteousness....decided to weigh sin and more good than bad is good enough and a man can now earn his own salvation...how God allowed himself to be indebted to is creation.  How a sinful man becomes righteous by doing good deeds?  How does good deeds undo sin?    How the God that is Love becomes a god that hates sinners and created some people to mislead them to burn them in hell.    How this God    Mat.5:43  Ye have heard that it hath been said, Thou shalt love thy neighbour, and hate thine enemy.   44 But I say unto you, Love your enemies, bless them that curse you, do good to them that hate you, and pray for them which despitefully use you, and persecute you;   Luke 6:27  But I say unto you which hear, Love your enemies, do good to them which hate you,     28 Bless them that curse you, and pray for them which despitefully use you.     29 And unto him that smiteth thee on the one cheek offer also the other; and him that caketh away thy cloke forbid not to take thy coat also.     30 Give to every man that asketh of thee; and of him that taketh away thy goods ask them not again.     31 And as ye would that men should do to you, do ye also to them likewise.     32 For if ye love them which love you, what thank have ye? for sinners also love those that love them.       became this Allah    Whomsoever Allah guides, he is the one who follows the right way; and whomsoever He causes to err, these are the losers. Many are the Jinns and men we have made for Hell. S. 7:178-179       Aisha, the mother of the believers, said that Allahs Messenger (may peace be upon him) was called to lead the funeral prayer of a child of the Ansar. I said: Allah's Messenger, there is happiness for this child who is a bird from the birds of Paradise for it committed no sin nor has he reached the age when one can commit sin. He said: Aisha, per adventure, it may be otherwise, because God created for Paradise those who are fit for it while they were yet in their father's loins and created for Hell those who are to go to Hell. He created them for Hell while they were yet in their fathers loins. (Sahih Muslim, Book 033, Number 6436)     `Umar b. al-Khattab reported: I heard that the Apostle of Allah (may peace be upon him) was questioned and he replied: The Lord created Adam, then moved His right hand on his back and brought out issues and said: We have created them for Heaven: these will do actions befitting heavenly persons. Then He moved His left hand on his back and brought out issues and said: We have created then for Hell and these will do actions befitting Hell. (Muwatta Imam Malik, p.374).|`|WnOgbOmiaa	I didn't understand y someone wanted to beat me up during Ramadan|`|UmdKqP5kaa	TO ALL IGNORANTS WHO ANSWERED THIS, HERE'S WHAT ISLAM IS ABOUT:  Ok, we know we don't create each other and we don't come to this world from nowhere because when we die we must be going somewhere as well, hence there must be God, if there were many Gods, they would have fought over what to be created and what not to be, probably over who to die and who to live at the same time... so it's gotta be one God... if that God created us then there must be a reason... could we figure it out on our own? God made it easy and sent us messengers and prophets to show us the way and tell us why... so all the messengers and all the religions are from the same only God, so they've got to be complementary to each other, not opposing each other!!! then God must have said His final words in the last message, what is the last message? and how do we know it's the last one? I guess that would be the religion that believes in all messengers and all books equally... is there such religion? actually yes, Islam does :)  A True Muslim (man or woman) gets his reward for obeying Allah's orders (Allah means The God in Arabic) by going to heaven, where he/she are indulged forever in all the good things that were on earth and more, things no one ever dreamt of or heard about. The Holy Quran tells Muslims (men and women) there will be good food, good wine and sex in heaven for all, but not in the bestial way you may think of, but rather in a way that is satisfactory for everyone and better than what was on earth. Heaven is no heartbreak or injustice land.  True Muslims are no terrorists, and Islam never calls for that, Islam means peace, it bans violence unless you were fought so you fight back, it only doesn't require Muslims to be cowards, and true Muslims understand this very well and never attack civilians.   Islam is the only religion that accepts freedom of religion and asks men to treat women gently like queens.   It's all in the Holy Quran and the right teachings of prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him).  If some people behave otherwise, then it's because people behaviour doesn't necessarily reflect the rulings of their religion always, for example, we can't (and don't) judge Christianity by Hitler or Madonna.  And that is another reason why there is heaven and hell after we die, heaven for the obedient and hell for the disobedient and/or oppressor, it's all going to be decided on the day of resurrection and judgement.  To be a Muslim, you must believe God is only one with no spouses or offspring, believe in his angels (servants not males or females), believe in all his religions, messangers and books equally, the day of judgement, heaven and hell and that everything is in God's hands and because of his will (good or bad).  Muslims believe God is the only divine who never dies, the creator who deserves to be worshiped, all prophets who came to earth are human messangers sent by him.  Muslims don't deny christianity, judaism, Jesus or Moses. They believe in them as the noble prophets and messangers of God, love and respect them so much.  We believe the birth of Jesus (messanger of God) was a miracle from God to us, being born by a mother only and with no father. God is the creator, he can do anything.  We believe Jesus (peace be upon him) is NOT dead till today; he wasnt even murdered or crucified as most people think. God (most glorified) made the man who betrayed Jesus be killed instead by switching their looks for a moment. Jesus was left up to live in heaven until the end of days when he will come back to earth again, with no new teachings or messages but just to make justice prevail instead of oppression, fight the imposter who will claim to be God and (most important) to perform his last prayer with the Muslims announcing he's too a follower of the last prophet (Muhammad) as all people should... then he really dies like other Prophets and be buried (peace be upon them all). So we're waiting for you Jesus, Messenger of God, to bring the world peace and pray with us. Thats what prophet Muhammad told us and this is what I believe in, Im a Muslim  so how do we know it's true? what is said in the last message and what should we do? read the following, and you'll figure out for yourself:|`|MRhpYS77aa	I do not understand how Muslims can think God would change his mind about adultery, paedophilia, rape and murder! It seems that he wrote the Quran to make all mohammed's sins ok (marrying a child, lusting after a crawling baby, multiple wives, rape, murdering non-believers). Does not sound like the loving God of the Bible.|`|UITfm0fjaa	Wait, I feel like this is backwards....|`|AMCuX8XPaa	What I'd like to know is how the US could have a President who had probably never read a book about Islam - didn't know anything about it - didn't care anything about it - wished only to demonize it.

Their art sucks - it's only ever architectural spec drawings of mosques or arabic religious words. How droll.    They have no music except for old imams in towers yelling at people to get in and pray.    They have no great fictional literature, no stirring films that tell a compelling story, they have no drama or musical instrumentals that anyone wants to hear.    Muslims have let the old imams and mullahs hijack their culture and squeezed all the life blood out of it. It's dead, except for praying, praying, praying.    Oh, for the rich, glorious, colourful, musical days of Persia..|`|iSU0O9W0aa	Up Dated: See at the end please.    For those who think Qura'n is violent, sir or Madam, read and study carefully complete verses with its context as well, then you will realize, Qura'n is The Book for Peace and Justice.  Plus you have ever chance to read and study Old testaments and New Testaments?        All humans has life cycle, and after completing first life cycle has to return to God Almighty, leaving body on earth. And this is true for all Messengers and Prophets, including Prophet Jesus.    Secondly Prophet Muhammad never asked Allah to spare his life but Maghfirah, means forgiveness for any committed or non committed errors or sins, to teach us to pray same all the time and keep away from sins.    Thirdly Prophets like Abraham, Moses, Jesus, and Muhammad (pbu them all) were specially protected by God Almighty, so human was able to kill any one of them, their death were natural and Prophet Jesus has been raised with body to heavens purposely, by God Almighty, and will send him again to prove He was and is True Prophet of God Almighty. Prophet Jesus will also clarify that He is slave of The God Almighty as all the humans are,  and he not the son or God himself at all.

I will add counter questions to explain why Islam is true Religion taught and preached by all Prophets including Abraham, Moses, and Jesus.    Christians says, Christianity says if your enemy hit you on your one chick, give another to hit, why Christians falsely taking revange from Muslims and instead of offering peace, invading and killing millions and millions of Muslims, Budhist, Communists, and other faiths, in Iraq, Afghanistan, Japan, Vietnam, Korea?  Why when Jesus said, Idid came to abolish law of Moses, and not folloing Old Testaments, eating Pork, and drinking Alcohol?  First commandment say's very clearly, there is no God before me, why they think Jesus is God, is it not the denial of teaching of Prophet Jesus himself. He said very clearly about God Almighty, your Lord and mine, that means very clearly God is lord of Jesus, and Jesus is not God or son of God?

Of particular significance is what I have been told about suicide.  Muslims have told me that suicide is absolutely prohibited under all conditions.      I would like to know why Muslims worldwide do not more boldly and openly denounce such things as suicide bombings.   Many people have willingly killed themselves in order to kill others.  Even babies have been targeted in such bombings by suicidal killers who leave notes and even videotapes saying that their actions were done in the Name of Islam and Allah.    If these things are actually contrary to sincere Islam, I'd like to know why more Muslims do not aggressively denounce and condemn such acts.

I personally hate the "baggage" that comes with (technically) identifying myself as gay: Because I have a predominant attraction to the male gender, it's the MOST accurate description that I know of. But the movement can sometimes be a bit... out there for me. I'm all for equality of rights, but I feel more at home in ancient Greece than in the San Francisco streets (though I love California without doubt). And, what's more, there are certain girls that I genuinely am attracted to. It is physical as well. My old repulsion over the female anatomy just... died one day. But they are still a small minority and the rest (past the Ideal itself) don't mean much.    Same goes for you: Your attraction could be called either "basically straight," since you admit that your majority of interests lies in the female camp, while you could also consider yourself bi because you can legitimately say you feel strongly toward a member of your own sex in addition. Then again, "gay" might even be appropriate since the current "love of your life" is a guy--and thus your "predominant attraction."     It's all just semantics, man. I like to think of myself more as a person who happens to resonate with the themes of same-sex love, but society likes its labels. I personally advise against them. But if you must adopt one (certainly not for clarity's sake, as they are useless there), then choose well. May I suggest "Greek"? lol That sounds more accurate to me (pick your type: Athenian, Spartan, etc.). It's all linguistic nonsense anyway. You might as well pick something semi-appropriate AND fun.    Good luck! (Wish this could happen with my best friend.) : )|`|NUcIiXnBaa	You are bi... I know you say that you don't look at other guys, but if you look at even one guy as well as girls then you are bi. Kevin is just the only guy that you would be with... but he's still a guy... So you're still bi.|`|7158cf5ad6b257f1eff62f9759b44304aa	i don't usually go for names. i always tell my friends it just so happens i fell in love with a girl.    people fall in love and find their soul mates, not necessarily the opposite sex though.|`|oeyurWLoaa	No your gay? whos to say another kevin wont come along, this is veyr gay or possibly BI but no straight man on earth would do this!|`|g6cUQFuCaa	ur bi and when ur bi ur not always atracted to every guy only the ones that meet your fetish like "Kevin"|`|N8UwWt2Kaa	Not that I know of.     If you mostly like girls, but you somehow fell for a guy it doesn't make you gay. If  you marry this guy at some point and you guys stay together than i would say you were gay, or in a gay relationship. But, if this ends and you go back to chicks, I'd say you were straight. Hopefully it doesn't really matter to you though, what's a label anyway? Just something for people to start drama over.    Congrats and good luck with "Kevin" Lol|`|ixrDuh4gaa	No, there's no formal name.  There's nothing to stress over.  Sexuality is so complex, and there are so many varying factors that determine our sexuality, it's impossible to find a formal name for every single variation.  What if you're emotionally attracted to males, but sexually attracted to females (oh, wait, you'd be straight, wouldn't you?  Heh.)      No label, no need for one.  If you guys don't feel like explaining exactly what you told us to every single person you meet, over and over, you can just make it easy and tell people when you just meet them that you're bi.  If they become close friends, you can explain further.  Good luck with Kevin and congrats for pulling yourself together.|`|OFf6EWFoaa	Answer,  Assuming your male.    Interested in only Boys,- Gay  Interested in Both = Bi  interested in only girls = Str8    Sounds like you are a little bi, even if you dont like another boy.  at least your not Gay.    BEST advise ever = Dont worry soo damm much about what "Label" you are.   Would it make a differenc if i said you are a potato. and kevin is a donut.  lol|`|06aceb1d90d3755e9049c8a9a59210ddaa	You're bi.  You don't have to be attracted to ALL guys to be attracted to guys.  You're clearly attracted to Kevin otherwise there wouldn't be any attraction between you.    So yeah.  Bi, with an extreme preference for girls.

He is exempt from having any partners, helpers, or fellows. His relations with all beings are those of Creator. He creates through His pre-eternal will with the command of Be!, and it is. He is far beyond having any relation which is contrary to perfection, or is compelling, necessitating, or involuntary.Almighty God is pre-eternal and post-eternal, He is the First and the Last.

God is God.    Question: "What do angels look like?"    Answer: Angels are spirit beings (Hebrews 1:14), so they do not have any essential physical form. But angels do have the ability to take on human form. When angels appeared to humans in the Bible, they resembled normal males. In Genesis 18:1-19, God and two angels appeared as men and actually ate a meal with Abraham. Angels appear as men many times throughout the Bible (Joshua 5:13-14; Mark 16:5), although they never appear in the likeness of women.    At other times, angels appeared not as humans, but as something other-worldly. At times, their appearance was terrifying to those who encountered them. Often the first words from these angels were do not be afraid, because extreme fear was such a common reaction. Zacharias in Luke 1:12 was speechless before the angel who visited him, as were the keepers of Jesus tomb, who became as dead men when they saw the angel of the Lord (Matthew 28:4). The shepherds in the fields in Luke 2 were sore afraid when the angel of the Lord appeared and the glory of the Lord shone around them. To others, however, angelic appearances did not produce terror. Marys encounter with the angel who announced the birth of Jesus produced confusion at the pronouncement, but did not seem to produce the same fear experienced by Zacharias.    As for physical characteristics, angels are often described as winged. The cherubim on the ark of the covenant have wings that cover the mercy seat (Exodus 25:20). Isaiah also saw winged seraphim in his vision of the throne of heaven, each one having six wings (Isaiah 6:2). Ezekiel, too, saw visions of winged angels. Isaiah 6:1-2 depicts angels having human featuresvoices, faces and feet. Angel voices are heard singing and praising God in several other passages. One of the most complete descriptions of an angel is in Daniel 10:5-6: I looked up and there before me was a man dressed in linen, with a belt of the finest gold around his waist. His body was like chrysolite, his face like lightning, his eyes like flaming torches, his arms and legs like the gleam of burnished bronze, and his voice like the sound of a multitude. The angel guarding Jesus tomb was similarly described: His countenance was like lightning, and his raiment white as snow (Matthew 28:3).    Whatever appearance angels take on, there is reason to believe they are incredibly beautiful. First, Ezekiel tells us that Lucifers beauty was such that it caused his heart to be lifted up in pride. In addition, it stands to reason that angels have extraordinary beauty because they are continually in the presence of Almighty God, whose glory is reflected upon all that is around Him.|`|JWjlyztBaa	Women are home on cloud 9 with babby angels.|`|AA10098101	Angels are not men or women, they are asexual.  The Bible clearly states that there is no need for gender in heaven.    Understand the times that Jesus was born in: everyone wanted a son because a son carried on your lineage.  Plus, women were deemed inferior in those days, and were not permitted to speak to men without being spoken to first (thank God we live in a different time with a different set of standards, I'm just saying how it was back then).  God needed to be a man to reach people, therefore He needed a son.  There was no need for a daughter.

"I am too weak to live in this world, without the hope that there is someone watching over me, and I need to believe in an afterlife".  "I am too scared to even consider the possibility that there is no God, for fear of being punished by him".  "The thought of hell is so terrifying to me, that I have to believe, and be good".  Honesty, is always the best policy.    ~|`|SwtaUd56aa	A much more important question: Why would God be protecting or purposely not protecting America in the first place? America is not some rebirth of the pre-Christ Israel wherein the nations covenantal agreement with God affected them politically.    Frankly, I find it repugnant to suggest that God cares about America  a nation made up of human beings, Gods children  anymore than he does any other country in which Christians happen to live or not live.     So far as we can know with our limited knowledge, any evil that comes against America is either the result of humans making the wrong choices or the laws of nature working themselves out as they often to; how all of this fits in with Gods omniscience and omnibenevolence, we can never say for sure.     Finally, I'm not sure why you see America as turning its back on God. America has the highest percentage of Christians, and some would argue, as a free nation and successful democracy, stands as one of the most morally upright of nations.|`|stAeoUeSaa	The time of the end has come.

When I get home in the morning I will ask my wife (History Education Teacher who is completely fascinated with all things presidential) her top list for each of these categories and put them on here in the morning.

Lincoln, Jefferson, Madison, and Washington, undoubtedly the greatest Presidents we've had, were all VERY religious (and on a side note, all republicans [except Washington.  He was Independent]).  Jefferson's faith is clearly seen in the Declaration of Independence, Washington's faith is obvious in his speeches and morals, Lincoln's Gettysburg address shows openly his faith, as well as his speech on the institution of Thanksgiving.  Get over yourself.  99% of our founding fathers were religious, most of them Christian.      Bush was not a ruinous president.  Up until this economic downturn (which was caused by remnants of the Clinton era) started, we've been in some of the most prosperous years in the history of America!  Get some facts, man!
h5q89E3Haa	Yes, it is against Catholic Dogma.    The following verse is one of the simple reasons why.    Luke 1:7 But they had no child, because Elizabeth was barren, and they were both advanced in years.     Luke 1:13 But the angel said to him, "Do not be afraid, Zacharias, for your petition has been heard, and your wife Elizabeth will bear you a son, and you will give him the name John.

A transsexual person is born with a brain-body mismatch.  For example: A transsexual women is born with a female brain in a male body.  Researchers have proven that gender identity is inborn and unchangeable.  Transsexual people fix their birth condition by bringing their body into alignment with their brain.

For several the term "blind" would be a total misfit.

Faith is believing in the evidence.  The Bible is explicit in saying that God left sufficient evidence for His existence.      Logic itself dictates there must be a God, because natural cosmology leaves us with a huge dangling contradiction.  Where is the primary cause.  Whereas, God, being eternal, requires no cause.  Also, order does not come from chaos, intelligence from non-intelligence, intention from the unintentional, etc., etc.    He left evidence of His triune nature throughout creation, by creating atoms with protons, neutrons, and electrons; man with body, soul, and spirit; and the universe itself with space, time, and matter.    He left evidence of his creativity and intelligence by simply seeing those qualities in existence.    Skepticism is fine, as long as it's unbiassed skepticism, which it very rarely is concerning Christ.|`|b73d4eb6bf979588795fb3b329f48afaaa	They refuse to accept the notion that faith is blind by definition.  "Belief in things for which there is no evidence."  Blindness.

I know that he was born to a mortal mother some 2000 years ago in the Holy land and spent His life giving us an example of how we should live. (St John 13:15-17). He taught the true gospel, His gospel. He knew His mission and would not turn away from it, even tho He knew it was going to be so hard (St John 12:26-28). He entered into the Garden of Gethsemane and took upon Himself the pains and sins of all mankind. He suffered horrifying pain on the cross as He volunarily gave His life for us. Three days later, He overcame death by taking up His body. He lives and reigns in the eternal heavens even today. He is my Lord and my God, the Holy One of Isreal.     "And moreover, I say unto you, that there shall be no other name given nor any other way nor means whereby salvation can come unto the children of men, in and through the name of Christ, the Lord Omnipotent."  -Mosiah 3:17 (Book of Mormon).     Jesus is my Savior. I have commited sins, and thereby I am not clean, and would not be able to enter into the presence of God except it were for Christ. There is nothing that I can do for myself to become pure and clean. The only way I can be washed clean of my sins is by giving my life to Jesus, and following in His ways. I know that my works will not save me, only His grace can save me! My works are only to show my dedication and love to Him. I love Him with all of my heart. He is my gentle master.

"And now behold, I say unto you that the right way is to believe in Christ, and deny him not; and Christ is the Holy One of Israel; wherefore ye must bow down before him, and worship him with all your might, mind, and strength, and your whole soul; and if ye do this ye shall in nowise be cast out."|`|93fc57ca1c692acd2bd8f1bc7a446e6eaa	Alissa, you have already received many great answers.  Jesus is the second member of the Godhead.  He is the first born of the Father in spirit and the only begotten of the Father in the flesh.  He is our Lord, Savior, Redeemer and God of this earth.  Everything we do, we do in His name for He is our advocate before the Father.    I am grateful that He made redemption possible for me and for all of us.  I would like to reiterate Nephi's testimony of Him. II Nephi 25:  26 And we talk of Christ, we rejoice in Christ, we preach of Christ, we prophesy of Christ, and we write according to our prophecies, that our children may know to what source they may look for a remission of their sins.|`|AA11713693	Someone who has atoned for my sins.

They are three distinct beings. They're not the same person.   I learned this on my mission. Most Mormons don't understand how confusing this is for non-members.    EDIT: Look at these answers.

He was the first/oldest of our Father's spirit children... as well as the wisest, most filled with love (character requirements for whomever was to be the needed messiah).    He's also (and much more importantly) my Savior. Sure, He expects me to do the very best I can, but He and I know it will never be enough. I have faith that He has paid the balance, and that Father will accept His payment for my sins.    He's an example.. one that I fall woefully short of on a regular basis. He's a perfect example of love, wisdom, kindness, obedience, proper motive... Need I go on?    Like I said, there are a lot of things Jesus is to me.|`|BMQlzUkfaa	Their are many great answers here, so I would only like to add how I as a Mormon feel about my Savior Jesus Christ.    I know that he is the literal son of God.  That he came into the world to sacrifice his life for us if we will but only repent.  I know that he did this out of love for each of us.  That he taught us th way to become like our Father in Heaven and the way that we can return to his presence someday.  That after he was crucified he was resurrected and became the first person born on earth to have a body of flesh and bones reunited with his spirit in an immortal and perfect state.  That he is still an immortal being with a body of flesh and bones like his Father in Heaven and that because of this he has not only the right but the power to offer this gift to us.  This he does freely for all of us who chose to come to earth and receive a body of flesh and bones.  I know that even though he is the son of God, he is also a God.  The God of this world that he had a hand in its creation.      I revere, honor and worship him as well as our Father in Heaven.  I know that it is only by him and through him that we can return to live in heaven with our Father in Heaven and that it is this place where the greatest happiness and growth for all eternity is possible.     I love this song because the words say exactly what I feel about my Savior Jesus Christ.  It is called:  I Know That My Redeemer Lives.  I'm including the words for you.    1. I know that my Redeemer lives.  What comfort this sweet sentence gives!  He lives, he lives, who once was dead.  He lives, my ever-living Head.  He lives to bless me with his love.  He lives to plead for me above.  He lives my hungry soul to feed.  He lives to bless in time of need.    2. He lives to grant me rich supply.  He lives to guide me with his eye.  He lives to comfort me when faint.  He lives to hear my souls complaint.  He lives to silence all my fears.  He lives to wipe away my tears.  He lives to calm my troubled heart.  He lives all blessings to impart.    3. He lives, my kind, wise heavnly Friend.  He lives and loves me to the end.  He lives, and while he lives, Ill sing.  He lives, my Prophet, Priest, and King.  He lives and grants me daily breath.  He lives, and I shall conquer death.  He lives my mansion to prepare.  He lives to bring me safely there.    4. He lives! All glory to his name!  He lives, my Savior, still the same.  Oh, sweet the joy this sentence gives:  I know that my Redeemer lives!  He lives! All glory to his name!  He lives, my Savior, still the same.  Oh, sweet the joy this sentence gives:  I know that my Redeemer lives!        P.S.

However, their leaders definition is very different than traditional Christianity. The former president of the Mormon Church, Gordon B. Hinckley, made this statement in 1998:     In bearing testimony of Jesus Christ, President Hinckley spoke of those outside the Church who say Latter-day Saints "do not believe in the traditional Christ. No, I don't. The traditional Christ of whom they speak is not the Christ of whom I speak. For the Christ of whom I speak has been revealed in this the Dispensation of the Fulness of Times.  He together with His Father, appeared to the boy Joseph smith in the year 1820, and when Joseph left the grove that day, he knew more of the nature of God than all the learned ministers of the gospel of the ages." (Deseret News, Church News section, Salt Lake City, Utah, week ending June 20, 1998, p. 7)     The Mormon Church teaches that men, gods, angels and devils are all the same species. Thus both Jesus and Lucifer are literally our elder brothers  all are the children of God the Father and one of his celestial wives. As men are viewed as being the same species as God and Jesus they have the same potential to achieve godhood. Brigham Young preached:     We have a Father; He is in heaven; ...He says that we are His children. ... we actually believe that God the Father is our heavenly Father, that we are His children; and we believe that Jesus Christ is our elder brotherthat he is actually the Son of our Father and that he is the Savior of the world, and was appointed to this before the foundations of this earth were laid. (Journal of Discourses, vol. 13, pp. 235-256, February 20, 1870)     He [Jehovah] was the Son of our Heavenly Father, as we are the sons of our earthly fathers. God is the Father of our spirits, which are clothed upon by fleshly bodies, begotten for us by our earthly fathers. Jesus is our elder brother spirit clothed upon with an earthly body begotten by the Father of our spirits. (Journal of Discourses, vol. 10, p. 2, September 28, 1862)     Traditional Christianity teaches that Jesus was always God  with no beginning or end.  Mormonism teaches that Jesus was fathered by God and one of his celestial wives and then he earned his godhood.     The LDS Church teaches that God the Father has a physical, tangible, resurrected body and that God literally sired Jesus in the same physical sense that any other man begets a child. Consequently "the virgin birth" is redefined to mean Mary had intercourse with a god, not a mortal, in order to literally conceive the baby Jesus. In a 1916 doctrinal statement by the LDS First Presidency we read:     1. "Father" as Literal Parent ... God the Eternal Father, whom we designate by the exalted name-title "Elohim," is the literal Parent of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ, and of the spirits of the human race. Elohim is the Father in every sense in which Jesus Christ is so designated, and distinctively He is the Father of spirits. ... Jesus Christ is the Son of Elohim both as spiritual and bodily offspring; that is to say, Elohim is literally the Father of the spirit of Jesus Christ and also of the body in which Jesus Christ performed His mission in the flesh, and which body died on the cross and was afterward taken up by the process of resurrection, and is now the immortalized tabernacle of the eternal spirit of our Lord and Savior.

Because he claimed to be THE God, not "a God".    Joh 1:1  In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God.   Joh 1:2  The same was in the beginning with God.   Joh 1:3  All things were made by him; and without him was not any thing made that was made.   Joh 1:4  In him was life; and the life was the light of men.   Joh 1:5  And the light shineth in darkness; and the darkness comprehended it not.   Joh 1:6  There was a man sent from God, whose name was John.   Joh 1:7  The same came for a witness, to bear witness of the Light, that all men through him might believe.   Joh 1:8  He was not that Light, but was sent to bear witness of that Light.   Joh 1:9  That was the true Light, which lighteth every man that cometh into the world.   Joh 1:10  He was in the world, and the world was made by him, and the world knew him not.   Joh 1:11  He came unto his own, and his own received him not.   Joh 1:12  But as many as received him, to them gave he power to become the sons of God, even to them that believe on his name:   Joh 1:13  Which were born, not of blood, nor of the will of the flesh, nor of the will of man, but of God.

He's our purpose and lighthouse that guides to the source of light. Gotta love him!! (Oh, but it's only the Heavenly Father whom we worship.)    This is amazing how so many LDS don't know their basic principle. We believe that we are saved through Jesus Christ. We love him as our savior and eldest brother. However, it is only the Father whom we worship. It should be. Otherwise we are polytheists.

He is the creator of everything.  He is the voice that spoke to all the prophets of the Old Testament.  He was the voice in the burning bush.  He sent the fire from heaven to light Elijah's altar.  He carved the ten commandments with His finger.  He is God.    I even disagree with Mr.Investigator.  We worship Jesus Christ.      When you ask who He is "to me", suddenly it's personal, though.  To me, He is the guidance I rely on when life is difficult.  He is the reason I can forgive myself for my worst moments.  Because I know He is willing to forgive me.

6aMeHzryaa	Carl Sagan never comes out and denies Gods existence,  he merely states probabilities based on years of scientific reasoning.  Richard Dawkins was on the edge of his seat when Ben Stiller in the movie Expelled asked him if he REALLY didn't believe in God.  It's priceless to see the most quoted atheist of our day stammering for words.  And as far as Darwin is concerned there is still no varifiable proof of evolution from species to species.  And even if this small mutation situation were to occur over the course of time, we'd have some form of creature alive today midstream in this process with a very distinct character, pointing toward the change occuring.  Evolution is real, with in a species, it still remains a theory and a theory is no more solid than my faith.  And as far as the atheists claiming that all christians were indoctrinated to believe what they do, I personally met my master in my heart, long before I even understood the bible.  I knew it was him once I started reading and realized everything he was sharing with me in my heart was written in some form or another in scripture.  while it is true, men have handled and mishandled this info over the years, I always verify and weigh it out with the spirit with which I have been sealed.  Just as many men have mishandled science over the years as well.  Do you realize at one time in american history there was a field of scientific medicine that was actually devoted to proving the inferiority of the black man as lower on the evolutionary scale than the white man.  They used to take the cranal cavity of a black skull and a white skull and measure their densities and sizes in order to prove their thoeries.  Imagine the scientists that wasted their entire careers with this!  How absurd is that?  If you look for these things there are just as many deffects in the evolutionary wall as there are in the theist wall.  This will all make sense when The theists wake up and see the truth in science and the atheists wake up and see the truth in intelligent design.  There are no mistakes only human error, which can be corrected, if we all work together;  and the only way we can work together, is if we all come together under one head, where flesh and spirit meet or rather science and religion intersect.  Only in Christ are these two united and this is the truth.  All creation was corrupted as a result of the fall, and creation is science, spirit is incoruptable.  This is why Jesus said we must worship in the spirit and in truth.  Our answers must come from our heart and our hearts must be devoted to peace and love.  If there is any self seeking at all we will surely ruin each other for the sake of wise sounding arguements and debates about such things that bear little value in bringing us into a happier way of living together.  We all must unite under the guidence of one whose very concepts defy and challenge us to take responsibility not only for ourselves but also each other as we walk the extra mile turn the other cheek and give from our abundance.  Is my isolation so dear to me that I am willing to sacrifice the willingness of a possible friendship for the sake of believing that my ancestors were amphibious sea creatures?  What is more important than the time we share together right now?  I want so desparately to believe in everyone I meet.  I desire to be free from the oppinions that keep me from understanding my brothers need to be heard and not only heard, but understood.  Do I need to know what causes the flower to grow in order to enjoy its simple beauty?  Do I need to know that the sun is the center of our universe to take advantage of its life giving warmth?  Do I need to understand how water takes its form on the earth in order to appreciate its effects in my life?  Do I need to understand my brothers need to believe in God or not to, in order to win his heart as a friend?  In all of these things I submit to you my heart, we all must be willing to work together under one head, and as far as I can see, history has not shown me a better candidate for the job whether in fiction or reality than the very son of the living God YESHUA, a.k.a- Jesus Christ.|`|OZ2Ass9iaa	I don't think Lewis actually wrote "Surprised by Joy" - but regardless.

Why cant they just say:  "I know my beliefs are illogical, but I've been brainwashed into believing these things my entire life."  "I am too weak to live in this world, without the hope that there is someone watching over me, and I need to believe in an afterlife".  "I am too scared to even consider the possibility that there is no God, for fear of being punished by him".  "The thought of hell is so terrifying to me, that I have to believe, and be good".

He critiques God in all his forms, from the sex-obsessed tyrant of the Old Testament to the more benign (but still illogical) Celestial Watchmaker favored by some Enlightenment thinkers. He eviscerates the major arguments for religion and demonstrates the supreme improbability of a supreme being. He shows how religion fuels war, foments bigotry, and abuses children, buttressing his points with historical and contemporary evidence. In so doing, he makes a compelling case that belief in God is not just irrational, but potentially deadly. Dawkins has fashioned an impassioned, rigorous rebuttal to religion, to be embraced by anyone who sputters at the inconsistencies and cruelties that riddle the Bible, bristles at the inanity of "intelligent design," or agonizes over fundamentalism in the Middle East--or Middle America.|`|PvgZUzHjaa	I think it's a well-known Christian ploy to talk like this, in the hopes that you will sufficiently confuse an atheist into believing in god.

I mean that literally.  For me, it's impossible to go back to believing because I've found all the answers the show me why it isn't so... and I'm happy with that.  My life feels full and I don't need a God to help me along.    Personally, when I first became Atheist, I too felt the need to show the believers the light... then I realized why some people need God... be it to show them some kind of morality (since they can't function on their own merits), to ease them into believing they're going to be here for a longer span of time and are thus more important than a mere blip on the map of time, to help them not feel so lonely, to help them feel more loved, to help themselves feel redeemed and worthy, and a lot use God to be superior to other people/animals/even the planet.    Atheism is not for everyone because some people have a need deep inside for an explanation.  I am not one of those people.  You are.  Somewhere inside of you was a hole that was filled by the most widely available hole-filler there is... religion and God.

It's how we see things.  It's when we are willing to see around this lens that clarity is a possibility.      Most who are die-hard in their views guard the lens through which they look through intellectual assent to tenents which support them.  The possibilities of what may actually be, are frightening once we have are paradigms firmly planted.  THAT is why atheists remain atheists.  One's paradigms are part of who he is.  To shift paradigms is psychologically not only difficult, but likely improbable due to several factors, pride being among the most significant.     The denial of the obvious is incredible to me.  Some highly intellecual people otherwise have used mental gymnastics to solidify what isn't the case.  Amazing.
AA11910766	Well, I would wait for the angel to appear before me and confirm the story, just like Joseph did...|`|6bC1HnyHaa	if Her son baby talked when he is 1 day old then ye    Narrated Abu Hurairah said,The Prophet said  "None spoke in cradle but three: (The first was) Jesus, (the second child was): There  was a man from Ban? Israel called Juraij. While he was offering prayer, his mother  came and called him. He said (to himself), "Shall I answer her or keep on praying?"  (He went on praying and did not answer her). His mother said, "O Allah! Do not let  him die till he sees the faces of prostitutes." So while he was in his hermitage, a lady  came and sought to seduce him, but he refused. So she went to a shepherd and  presented herself to him to commit illegal sexual intercourse with her, and then later  she gave birth to a child and claimed that it belonged to Juraij. The people, therefore,  came to him and dismantled his hermitage and expelled him out of it and abused him.  Juraij performed ablution and offered prayer, and then came to the child and said: "O  child! Who is your father?" The child replied, "The shepherd" (after hearing this) the  people said, "We shall rebuild your hermitage of gold," but he said: "No, of nothing  but mud." (The third was the hero of the following story): A lady from Ban? Israel  was nursing her child at her breast when a handsome rider passed by her. She said, "O  Allah! Make my child like him." On that the child left her breast and facing the rider  said: "O Allah! Do not make me like him." The child then started to suck her breast  again. [Abu Hurairah further said, "As if I were now looking at the Prophet  sucking his finger (in way of demonstration.")]. After a while they (some  people) passed by, with a lady slave and she (i.e. the childs mother) said, "O Allah!  Do not make my child like this (slave-girl)!" On that the child left her breast, and said,  "O Allah! Make me like her." When she asked why, the child replied, "The rider is  one of the tyrants while this slave-girl is falsely accused of theft and illegal sexual  intercourse."

When the woman questions him about it, he answers, "Well, the last time this happened, Magi showed up with a lot of money.  I was hoping I could get in on some of that."

10AvUf8Jaa	I don't like the old versions. If you look up the NLT or the NIV translations of it they read more modern and it makes more sense. Most people do not talk with using words such as shall, thou, bidst, etc. English in todays times has been completely changed from it's original wording. What the verse is supposed to mean though is the Lord is enough. He is all that I'll need. I don't need anymore because He is my provider.|`|06aceb1d90d3755e9049c8a9a59210ddaa	A modern translation without metaphors or archaic grammar would be:    [Because God is my guide I won't ever go without the things that I need.]    The "I shall not want" doesn't relate to having God as a shephard but being without things like food.  To want, in this context, means to be in a position where you want something that you need to survive.     So yeah, it's lost in translation.  I really wish that if they're oging to continue to use the Bible, that they'd modernise the language in it at least.  You ever tried reading Genesis?  F*cking nightmare.|`|91XGHfSaaa	Dude, put the word "When" in front of "the". Then it makes (a bit more) grammatical sense.    In a theistic kinda way.

Sheep are retarded and they would be completely eaten by wolves if they didn't have a shepherd watching them and keeping them from all running off a cliff.  So the Lord is protecting and guiding his "flock" away from harm. The, "I shall not want" means " I will want for nothing." to translate this expression further, "you will not be missing anything you need to survive" (because God is doing His Shepherding thing)   It continues to say He maketh me to lie down in green pastures,  "He leadeth me by still waters. (water you can drink from and not get swept away by it.) He restoreth my soul."  He has created Man to have some Leisure time and be at peace and in physical comfort. He takes away my emotional exhaustion and disappointments and lets me cheer up again.   There is more to it, but it is all messages of assurance and reminders of promises that God has made to His followers.|`|AA11564934	meaning I shall not have unfulfilled needs, it's really 2 separate sentences.    -atheist|`|bOTCVCOHaa	"I shall not want" means that I won't be in need of anything.

bcb934cd4176c6117c3cbd9a6a0357c9aa	Pero el joven con quien argumentaba ese da no estubo de acuerdo conmigo. El insista en que la palabra "dukkah" a sido traducida inapropiadamente como sufrimiento. "Dukkha" meramente significa "descontento" o "incorformidad" y eso, segn el, estaba muy lejos de ser sufrimiento.    "El descontento con tu vida social puede llevarte al "sangha" le dije. " La incomformidad de no tener una guia moral te puede llevar a los precptos y a las escrituras. Podemos entrar a grupos religiosos y entonces comenzar un tipo de carrera moral con otros miembros. Podemos hacer buenas obras (actos), mejores obras (actos) o hasta la mejor de las obras (actos). Pero Zen es ms profundo que el estudio, hermandad o filantropa. Zen es la salvacin del sufrimiento." Pero no pude convencerlo.
4786d32b584fcb26c69f4fab5c440db6aa	There are several programmes on television of ghost hunters who go round saying they can 'feel' something.    To me, it seems they spend 45 minutes sticking an infrared camera up someones nose. I've never been so bored or laughed so much at their pathetic attempts to prove the existence of spooks. Now if one did jump out on them, that would be worth seeing.     Sadly, one never has and never will. Titillation for the gullible.|`|AfbjU9Guaa	It's fun to have your suspicions though isn't it? I wait for proof, I've never witnessed anything myself, I'd like to though... so i'm waiting just incase. Keeping an open mind.

We will watch, tell us when it will be on.|`|dSQxCGbJaa	Nah, there isn't much evidence for the existence of ghosts..    ...but then what do you think religion is based on? Noone can prove any of that either but people still believe in it.    I think you've got to be open minded about it all, there's got to be something more than just what we can see! I'm undecided either way but no matter what you believe, it's still an interesting subject that keeps us all talking!|`|TjrnVFVRaa	Firstly,  you must define what evidence is.     It is possible that we do no have the ability to produce this evidence yet, because we do not have the technology. Our senses may tell us something, but we do not know what it is.     For example, in times past many people did not believe in the fact that the earth was round. They believed the earth was flat because that is what their senses and logic told them. Technology developed and proved the earth was round.     Our senses may tell us that sprirts DO exist, our logic may tell us spirits do NOT exist. Perhaps one day technology will offer a final proof.|`|Aoj0croZaa	To a believer no proof is necessary but to a skeptic no proof is possible. A spirit is made up of energy, it can manifest itself in many ways, some can speak to us, some can move things, and some show themselves. Paranormal research is a very interesting field, for those who do not believe they must fear the unknown. For those that do believe, they must have had some experience with a spirit. We in this field are used to people yelling and arguing about this subject and that just pushes us more to do what we do.|`|m6CIhrgqaa	I would call the CSI, but as far as I know ghosts don't go around leaving DNA evidence...    EVP is probably the closest thing to definate proof, but some people still question things like the existence of dinosaurs, even with all those bones in the ground.    The truth is most people will deny they exist until they see it themselves. Nonetheless, I find the supernatural an interesting subject to talk about.|`|FZ0hwowaaa	On the same argument is there evidence of existence of GOD?

6nucoaY9aa	I'm agnostic with atheistic leanings, and I have encountered a lot of misunderstandings about my beliefs as well.    For example, I personally do not believe in God, but I DO NOT deny his existence.  It seems to me that there is evidence against the existence of a supreme being, but we CANNOT prove that there is not a God.  The creation of the world, for example, is something we can only theorize about, so for all we know, there could be a God.    In other words, it is harder for me to comprehend the existence of God (that's just how my mind works) but I think it is perfectly plausible for God to exist.  There is simply no way of knowing if a God exists or not, which is why Christians emphasize faith.    Being agnostic is not about being unable to decide on whether you believe in God or not.  Agnosticism is about realizing that you do not know everything.  I do not know if there is a God or not, so I can see the theist side of the debate just as clearly as I can see the atheist side of the debate.    Agnostics are just open-minded people who acknowledge their lack of understanding of the world and the universe as a whole.|`|wR1XyyrUaa	Nice way to generalize 6 billion people there....    I can't speak as to why theists use their holy books as fact, but I know that as an Atheist, I can say that we simply do not know with absolute certainty that there is no God. We would have to know everything to know that, which we clearly don't. So while it is still possible, it is highly unlikely.|`|8pDblyCBaa	Why is it so hard for you to trust and believe?|`|37LKDbtsaa	Atheism = the lack of belief in deities. There is a big difference in levels of certainty.     TAP = Temporary Agnostic Position = We don't know now, but we will.    I can respect that, but I can't respect the fence-sitting of permanent agnosticism.    Trey: I'm just saying, but it can be rather insulting, that you are basically calling us unknowing and unaware.|`|06aceb1d90d3755e9049c8a9a59210ddaa	Uh, you do realise that agnostic should be used as an adjective and not a noun, right?  So you're an agnostic what?  Are you an agnostic theist, agnostic atheist, agnostic pantheist?    If you're going to label yourself at least follow the standards so we know what you mean. Duh :B    I don't care that dictionaries list the popular usage of agnostic as a noun, it doesn't describe your position, it just tells us you're agnostic about something.  You can't just "not know" about nothing.|`|Bi1W5U35aa	Just closed minded. The evidence is there and so is the refusal to look at it there. Truth is constant and belief doesn't change a thing. We know the earth is round because reliable people tell us it is and we play the odds. Joseph Smith and those around him were reliable people and what they said has been verified over and over again. You can't judge the contents of a book by looking at the cover.|`|ORFXYTj6aa	My friend,did you not open up a can of worms this time?LOL I may well be the only friend you have today.I must say alot of them made sense to me.Have a good one my friend.|`|Q6qyfPkRaa	Lord forgive this person, for they know not what they say, and although you told me that in the last days ppl will fall from the faith and many will not believe and some wont be able to make up their mind as to what they believe, i have solace knowing that YOU LORD can increase their comprehension if it is according to your WORD, WILL,and WAY  and you have not given them over to be reprobate. I pray on their behalf that they may understand your spirit! In JC name i Pray .. AMEN!|`|R0KIR66Haa	I understand it, you can't prove there is a God, but you can't prove there isn't. So you don't pick.|`|4pDvXONeaa	Yes!  Thank you!|`|bQ36mdBdaa	The fact that we can't absolutely know that there is or isn't a god doesn't make the two possibilities equally likely.  Believers as well as atheists make their own assessments of probabilities, and then live according to the results.  A believer doesn't _know_ there is a god, but (s)he is 99% percent certain, and with faith, that is enough.  An atheists doesn't _know_ there is no god, but considers god's existence as unlikely as anything else, and sees no reason to believe.    An agnostic, on the other hand, sticks with stating the obvious (that there is no way of _knowing_) and refrains from using the evidence and logical considerations available to make up his/her mind in any meaningful way.    Belief/disbelief is a conclusion based on experience (knowledge/emotion/upbringing/whatever). Agnosticism is the position of refusing to draw a conclusion, so yes, agnostics are people who can't/won't make up their minds.|`|bxYWJAYNaa	Actually being agnostic is a bit of a catch 22.    If you believe that God MIGHT exist, then you really have to become a Christian or something if you don't want to risk the damnation of your immortal soul.    Whereas you don't need to do anything for the opposite, because not embracing atheism has no penalty.    So thats my problem with agnostics. If you believe God might exist, then shouldn't you be hedging your bets? Just in case?|`|YWuAt65Qaa	No need to be so rude. Agnostics in my opinion, are atheists who do not think there is substantial proof to disprove the existence of God. Kinda bad logic. You need proof to prove something is not there, when there is no reason to believe that thing is there? It usually works the other way. Generally speaking, I do not automatically assume there is a bomb on the train I take on a daily basis, as there is little reason I would think it to be there. I have no proof one won't be there, but thats not a reason to believe there will be one there is it now? Theists think that there is some reason for God to be there. If their reason is valid, then of course it is not stupid to believe.     BTW, "aww you poor misguided souls" aren't you an agnostic and therefore are unsure of the existence of the soul? wouldn't it make sense NOT to speak as though you are certain of souls existence.

He comes up with a scale (completely fictional) that rates people like the Kinsey scale--1 is totally dominant, 6 is totally submissive.  It has nothing to do with gay or straight.  Some of the people in the story (who happen to fall on the submissive side of the scale) are actually aroused when the alpha male of the story (who's like a 0 or -1, he's so dominant) flirt with them and they are totally straight!  It's a great story, archived at Nifty (fair warning: contains lots of accounts of gay sex,) and even if the scale isn't real, I have to wonder if something like that spectrum could exist; I mean, could we actually measure how dominant and submissive people are?      Anyway, yeah, it's normal.  You're just like a heterosexual 5!  :)
LOSfacl5aa	Lots of trans people do not opt for the surgery. Usually because of the expense or due to health related reasons so no surgeon will touch them. Many of us happily live in a state of limbo.

Please contact the gay center and PFLAG.ORG regardin getting in touch with trans people. There are  some pretty big groups around. I'm sure you'll find a contact where you can actually talk to and meet others in ---ahh----LIMBO.   There are 2 good trans movies out there - one about 5 or 6 college kids going thru their own struggles and one where the MtF has to try to explain her new self to her estranged son. Very good. Very sensitive. If you are trans, and you don't go all the way, you will forever be in limbo, you'll never be able to change your name, driver's license, birth certificate, etc. You'll always feel like you're not complete. I'm sorry-- maybe that is my opinion. I am a lesbian who came out late (27) but I knew something was different about me from early on. When I finally 'got it' I was overwhelmed at first, but then talking to a young fella at the gay center helped me sort out my confusion. You need to talk to someone who has had the same experiences. ..... some one to guide you. No one can tell you what to do. You need to figure out what will make you feel whole inside and out.  I wish you all the best. maye you have a great life. CALL THE 2 ORGS  ASAP SO YOU CAN START ON YOUR JOURNEY TO WHERE EVER YOU NEED TO BE.    Oy, I didn't mention that you might just be a really butchy lesbian and really don't want to go  thru any transition. SORRY!

AA10637643	We do use the Book of Mormon, KJV of the Bible, the Doctrine & Covenants and the Pearl of Great Price.  All of those we consider important and inspired Scripture.    What influence does Joseph Smith have on my life?  Uh...just that I revere him as the first prophet of this dispensation.  He is not my example, Christ is.  I try to emulate what Christ would do.  We don't worship Joseph.  We just love him for all that he did to bring about the restoration.|`|BtygS0Hraa	Our religion is based upon the teachings of Christ, whether it be through the words of His prophets, or his personal words.  Joseph Smith has a huge impact on my life, but not the way that people make it look.  I don't worship him, he is a prophet, not God.  His impact is due to the restoration of the Church, the priesthood, and the translation of the Book of Mormon.  I follow only the words of Christ and his chosen prophets, and we have one among us today.  His name is Thomas S. Monson.  Christ is the center of the religion, as previously stated, and visited in both the New Testament (pre- and post- ressurection) and the Book of Mormon (post-ressurection- other sheep have I also... John 10:16).  We use the King James Version of the Bible, which is the same used by most Christian religions (as we are one ourselves...)  We use the Bible, Book of Mormon, Pearl of Great Price, Doctrine and Covenants, and also the word of God revealed through His servant, the prophet (such as General Conference, etc.)|`|dc00e6f724cc094e75dc0475843d0e44aa	Here is a summary of our beliefs.    1. We believe in God, the Eternal Father, and in His Son, Jesus Christ, and in the Holy Ghost.  2. We believe that men will be punished for their own sins, and not for Adam's transgression.    3. We believe that through the atonement of Christ, all mankind may be saved, by obedience to the laws and ordinances of the Gospel.    4. We believe that the first principles and ordinances of the Gospel are: first, Faith in the Lord Jesus Christ; second, Repentance; third, Baptism by immersion for the remission of sins; fourth, Laying on of hands for the gift of the Holy Ghost.    5. We believe that a man must be called of God, by prophecy, and by the laying on of hands by those who are in authority, to preach the Gospel and administer in the ordinances thereof.    6. We believe in the same organization that existed in the Primitive Church, namely, apostles, prophets, pastors, teachers, evangelists, and so forth.    7. We believe in the gift of tongues, prophecy, revelation, visions, healing, interpretation of tongues, and so forth.    8. We believe the Bible to be the word of God as far as it is translated correctly; we also believe the Book of Mormon to be the word of God.    9. We believe all that God has revealed, all that He does now reveal, and we believe that He will yet reveal many great and important things pertaining to the Kingdom of God.    10. We believe in the literal gathering of Israel and in the restoration of the Ten Tribes; that Zion (the New Jerusalem) will be built upon the American continent; that Christ will reign personally upon the earth; and, that the earth will be renewed and receive its paradisiacal glory.    11. We claim the privilege of worshiping Almighty God according to the dictates of our own conscience, and allow all men the same privilege, let them worship how, where, or what they may.    12. We believe in being subject to kings, presidents, rulers, and magistrates, in obeying, honoring, and sustaining the law.    13. We believe in being honest, true, chaste, benevolent, virtuous, and in doing good to all men; indeed, we may say that we follow the admonition of Paul--We believe all things, we hope all things, we have endured many things, and hope to be able to endure all things. If there is anything virtuous, lovely, or of good report or praiseworthy, we seek after these things.      Joseph Smith is/was a prophet.  We believe, as the Bible teaches in Amos 3:7, that God calls prophets.  We believe that God, as throughout history, calls prophets in this day and age as well as in times of old, ie Moses, Noah, Abraham.    We have prophets that lead the church today.  Joseph Smith was one of those prophets.|`|2ZO7vFC1aa	It's not just the Book of Mormon.  We also believe in the Bible.  Most Mormons use the KJV, though I don't think we necessarily believe there is only ONE "right" bible.  There are many translations, none of them "perfect".  I like to use the NIV sometimes too; and I also like the NKJV.    Joseph Smith was a good man that taught people to love each other and serve God.  His teachings have had a positive impact on my life and brought me closer to God.  I try to emulate, however, Jesus' deeds and instructions.      For more details on what we believe, check out https://www.mormon.org|`|rx20pKgOaa	You've received some really good answers about the basics that Mormons believe.  (From those who ARE Mormon.)  In regards to Desiree's post can I just say I am amazed that someone who claims that the Mormons are liars would herself use such outrages lies in trying to make her point.    So much hatred and animosity.  Where does it all stem from?

"By their fruits shall ye know them."|`|AA11281392	I'm not a Mormon, but grew up in a community with a large Mormon population and many of my cousins are Mormon.

So of course we believe in the Bible, because that's where the story of Jesus's life is found.  It's not crucial that you use any specific version, but Joseph Smith received some revelation about passages in the Bible and his revelations specifically relate to the King James version, so that's the version almost all Mormons use.    We believe Joseph Smith was one of the greatest prophets that ever lived, on a level with Moses and Abraham.  I don't think that means you emulate his deeds, because with Jesus as an example, why would you ever aim for anything else.|`|075ddc678f370797a19050edaae8be18aa	Agree with Desiree!! :)  Mormonism, as well as Jehovah's Witness, are masonic by-products! And there are many other sects like that, which have been created/plaaned/ engineered by the masons....  Even catholicism is a pagan infiltration in the christian(original) religion...  The "Roman-isation" (I call it like that) of Christianity is one of the most early attempts at destroying Christ's original teachings....  Just make a research on The Council of Nicea and you'll understand where does that concept of trinity(invented in 325 A.D) came from..... And why....    EDIT:  I'm also amazed with Desiree's answer.... Its not everyday we get somebody talking about mason's infiltration....(even though partially).... Keep it up!    EDIT 2:  Hahaha... lol.....

But its just that Id like to know what on earth and in heaven, could you refute me with....     Once, Aldous Huxley said: Facts do not cease to exist because they are ignored.  Also, Margaret Fuller once said: If you have knowledge, let others light their candles at it.    And thats what we did; we had the knowledge, and we conveyed it to you....    I challenge anyone to refute me on what Ive said...    Peace. May God guide you...|`|jdRKZe18aa	I do not try to emulate Joseph Smith although I have great regard, respect & love for him.  I believe  that only CHrist should be our lst example and who we turn to and try to be like.    As scripture tell us "all scripture" is for the edification and benefit of man and so Yes, we believe in, read and follow the King James Version of the Bible as well as the Book of Mormon, and all other new prophetic words from our current living Prophet of God today.  We do not believe that scripture or revelation from God ceased with the death of the apostle of old.    Although your question wasn't specifically directed to just MORMONS, hopefully you recognize that MORMONS are the only ones who will tell you what we actually believe without the negativity and deception you get from all the haters you read from on here as well.

You go to the SOURCE.|`|JWjlyztBaa	No desiree, it just means people want to collapse your answer so as not to have to scroll through that drivel.|`|4rWPX8CTaa	I have an essay that I copy and paste about the Mormons; they usually reward me with many, many thumbs down, so that indicates that I'm on the money...    Mormons basically have to believe that a guy who lived in America in the early 1800's was a prophet of the Christian god and not a liar. Thats the main tenet of the Mormon faith  believing this guy was not a liar. His name was Joe Smith and he claimed he was visited by an angel who told him the location of golden plates buried in the ground with another biblical text written in an old language on them. He claimed he translated these golden plates and wrote the translation in the Book of Mormon. He then claimed an angel took these golden plates to heaven when he finished translating them. During the translation, he claimed the golden plates were in his hat along with some magical rocks and he hid behind a curtain and talked aloud whilst holding his face in his hat and a guy who owned a printing press wrote down what he said. A lot of what Joe claimed was new biblical scripture was actually taken from the Old Testament. Heres a link explaining the connection: http://www.utlm.org/onlineresources/bomn...    Now if you think this is weird; wait, it gets worse! What this Joe Smith claimed was written on these golden plates was that Native Americans are descendants of a lost tribe of Hebrews that somehow made it from the Middle East to the Americas over 2000 years ago. He claimed they founded civilizations and fought wars with each other and apparently Jesus even visited the Americas. DNA evidence alone proves that what this guy said about Native Americans being descendants of Hebrews is nonsense. There has NEVER been any evidence found of pre-Colombian Hebrew civilizations in America. Heres a link to what the Smithsonian Institute has to say about the Book of Mormon; http://www.lightplanet.com/response/Smit...    Mormons used to practice polygamy and some of them still do but mainstream Mormons try to distance themselves from the polygamous ones. The Mormons who are the most fervent believers of their phony doctrine and do their utmost to spread Mormonism get special treatment in the temples and are rewarded with special underwear which has Masonic symbols sewn into it. Mormons believe this underwear protects them from bullets, fire, knife wounds etc. They have weird ceremonies in their temples and only favored Mormons are allowed access to the temples during these ceremonies. Mormons are expected to give 10% of their gross income to their church; if the church leaders feel as though their members arent giving enough of their income to the church, they are interviewed by the church leaders and have to explain their actions. If Mormons leave the church and dont attend services anymore, they are hounded by other members of the church for a while, then all contact is broken with them and friends and family are discouraged by the church to contact the member who has left.    Mormons used to be considered a racist cult as well, listed right alongside the KKK. They used to have as part of their doctrine judgment from their god that people with dark skin were cursed folk unequal to white people and people with dark skin werent allowed to attain high positions in the Mormon hierarchy. It was during the civil rights movement of the 60s that the Mormon leaders realized that society had shifted and laws were changed outlawing segregation and discrimination against dark skinned people. The Mormon leaders, each claiming they were prophets of the Christian god, claimed that they had received revelation from this god that the Mormon doctrine had to change to allow dark skinned people better treatment in the Mormon churches. This was a similar occurrence when they had to give up polygamy in order for the Mormon home state of Utah to be granted status as a state; again the Mormon leaders claimed they had revelation from the Christian god outlawing polygamy even though the founders of Mormonism were known polygamists.    Mormons believe lies; blatant lies. They try to make other people believe their lies too. They are active proselytizers and if you ever encounter a Mormon, its almost guaranteed they will try to get you to join their organization and believe the lies that they believe. They claim things like, Oh, but I am a law abiding person and I have a happy life and a good family and even if my religion is based on untruths, I can live with that because I know it makes me a better person. Sure, believing nonsense can make people into decent law abiding folk who are good parents, but its such a trade off. They trade reason and accountability for delusion. They trade intellect and individuality for delusion. They trade their freakin humanity for delusion.    If the missionaries were honest, they would tell people right from the start about the weird tenets of the Mormon faith. They would tell them things like, underwear with Masonic symbols on them, Jesus going to America, ancient tribes of Jews in America for which no evidence exists, golden plates, seer stones, magical glasses and the 'prophet' reading out his prophecy whilst holding his face in a hat. Of course, if the missionaries blurted out this stuff to everyone they meet, they wouldn't get many conversions (unless they start going to mental health institutions) but anything short of this is inherently dishonest.    Mormonism as a business; compare it to McDonalds  they both started in the USA, they both took an existing product, jazzed it up and marketed it in a different way, they have both spread all over the globe, they both recognize the financial benefits of getting children hooked to their product, they both update their menu/doctrine along|`|TzY9vkinaa	It's composed of Christ, the priesthood, prophets and apostles, the Bible, The book of Mormon, the pearl of great price, and the D&C.....

Go here and read tons more:    http://lds.org  http://mormon.org|`|FyLfEPv0aa	The answer is Christ.    We don't try to emulate Joseph Smith, he had a job to do, as do we.  We try to emulate Christ though.    The Book of Mormon is useful as a testament of Jesus Christ, without that it would be worthless.    Joseph Smith was revered because of his testimony of Christ and revelations from Christ; however he was an imperfect man whom I greatly respect, but without Christ would have been just anther countless person who's name I'd never hear.    We do use the bible; generally we use protestant bibles.  In English the common version is the King James, however we don't eliminate other versions (I'm fond of reading the King James, Italian Gerusalemme, and the Vulgate to get 3 views of the same chapter).

You refer to the church as if it's a place.  Please know that The Church are the faithful followers of Jesus the Christ the Messiah.  We know Jesus as Lord, and we seek to obey God's Word.      God delights in our obedience and love for Him.  He prefers our obedience more than any sacrifice that we can make.  However, the person who has experienced God's love will desire to give back to God and much more!      God has commanded the Church to go into all the world preaching the good news of Jesus to all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit, and teaching the reborn people to obey God's Word.  The Church is basically called to go and make disciples in order for them to also know God's love for eternity.      This world's currency operates on money.  The Church needs to do more with the money to reach-out to the sick, hungry, homeless, destitute, ect...people all around us.      It's not difficult to give money when we have had a glimpse of God's love for us and for all mankind.  The Church does not attempt to build-up treasures here on earth.  Rather we seek to invest our resources into advancing the Kingdom of God in every nation.    God is to come first in our lives as our first priority.  It's easy to see a person's priority when you know their level of generosity and hospitality and how they use or spend what God has given to them.  Nothing should come between us and our obedience to God's Word.      **************************************...

Tithes were supposed to be stored in a place commanded by God, to relieve those in need as well as to rejoice, when the families and servants of the contributors were to eat in celebration from the tithed foods, together with the priests. The priesthood of Aaron and the sons of Levi, which had commandments to take tithes from the people, died with Christ's sacrifice of himself, establishing Christ as the everlasting priest of an everlasting priesthood. So tithing died when the old priesthood died, when the Law died. Anyone who takes tithes is a false prophet, antichrist, and a deceiver; and anyone who continues to pay tithes is denying Christ's priesthood; both are subject to God's condemnation. Tithing died with the Levitical priesthood; the only places tithing is referenced in the New Testament is the claim of the self-righteous Pharisee, and the explanation of its death in Hebrews. The Apostle Paul instructed people to set aside funds from their excess, but that was to relieve the poor, particularly the large numbers of poor brethren in Jerusalem.  Jesus, Paul, and Peter all denied those who solicited money for preaching; and as Christ instructed his disciples: Freely (without pay) you have received, freely (without charge) "give.|`|597c2cb57b5dd60ca91e8fdd1a7325c6aa	The giving of tithes was a commandment only in the Old Testament.

Secondly, I prefer to give my gifts in terms of time and talents. For example, I volunteer as a tutor for homeless youngster. I find it more fulfilling to spend time helping these youngsters with homework and talking to them then merely writing a check. The third reason is that I don't make a lot of money. After bills, household expenses, and possibly owing the IRS again, there is very little left for me to do something like travel, buy new clothes, or see a movie.|`|veB7gJYcaa	Have you read Hosea 6 v 6 ?    Hosea 6:6 (Amplified Bible)    6 For I desire and delight in dutiful steadfast love and goodness, not sacrifice, and the knowledge of and acquaintance with God more than burnt offerings.    God wants our Love not our sacrifices.    God wants us to know Him more than our offerings.  ______________________________________...

Xt4n9h40aa	"But those who crave to be rich fall into temptation adn a snare adn into many foolish (useless, godless) and hurtful desires that plunge men into ruin and destruction and miserable perishing.  For the love of money is a root of all evil; it is through this craving that some have been led astray and have wandered fro the faith adn pierced themselves through with many acute [mental] pangs."  (1 Timothy 6:9-10 ~Amplified Bible)    Paul is telling us here that when you crave money above God nothing good can come of it.  Being rich is not a sin but putting it above God is.  It makes it a god to you, adn God says "You shall have no other gods before or besides Me." (Exodus 20:3 ~Amplified Bible)  When all you strive for is riches you miss out on a relationship with God.  It brings on so many troubles and worries that God does not want us to have to go through, but we will bring them on ourselves and eventually fall away from God.|`|AA12346187	those who make money their god  will find  hell.|`|gHSarVD1aa	What can I say about this verse?    1Ti 6:11   But thou, O man of God, flee these things; and follow after righteousness, godliness, faith, love, patience, meekness.   1Ti 6:12  Fight the good fight of faith, lay hold on eternal life, whereunto thou art also called, and hast professed a good profession before many witnesses|`|ZoSpdTIbaa	Perhaps they wander off in search of money and neglect their faith.

AA10665732	Well I'm not  in my late 20's or mid 30's, I'm 18, but let me tell you... there are some older men that I've seen that I've been really attracted to.  My Biology Lab Professor... he was in his mid 30's, honestly I really enjoyed his personality, my Bio Lab class was very small only 10 people the class for 2 hrs so it was quit easy for me to get to know him.  I didn't imagine that if I were to be with an older man that it was for the fact that he was successful or it was for his money, but I'm still young and naive I suppose.|`|MlgxVr0saa	r u friends with the pope?|`|fdkegbwgaa	Well I am in my mid 30's and if I truly fell for you then yea it would be genuine.  I have never been a gold digger etc I think it is the person that counts not what is in their bank account!|`|rNXCnJ8Eaa	I'm 22 and I find older men very distinguished and attractive. ;-)    Yes it's possible. My fiance's 28... which is actually a bit young for me.|`|daaf98fda077fbcf980e059669c29f08aa	I am 44 and my LTR b/f is 28 now.  He was 24 when we met. My last  LTR before him, (who is tragically  missing in the Asian tsunami) was  21 and I was 35.   They say I look a bit younger than  my age, I don't know, and I stay  very skinny, but the young guys  seem to love older men...IF you  don't seem desperate.  Your question would make some  young guys think you are an older  dude just hunting "fresh young meat",  which is a downer for them.  Act mature 75% of the time, be  yourself and DO NOT hit them up  for sex right away! Be friends first,  and let them go easy into lovemaking.  They love to play with the "older man",  so reversing roles is loads of fun for  them. Treat them with respect and  give them unconditional love; not just  frequent sex. A lot of what kind of  relationship you get depends on YOU.  Surely they are adorable but younger  guys really need respect from an   older man. You shouldn't even be  thinking about them being "posers".  YOU could very easily be a poser  yourself, pretending to be rich just to  snag some tender young tail to use.  Take each young man at face value,  and don't judge him until you know  him awhile. Good Luck, Pop!|`|G3VUDedjaa	It's been my experience that twinks usually date twinks, and bears date bears. People mostly date their "type". However, I'm 34 and prefer dating twinks, but it's always been on the sugar daddy level to be honest.      I'm sure there are always exceptions to the rule, but a 50-year-old dating a 25-year-old is not likely to happen in the gay community unless it's a sugar daddy type relationship.  Even in the hetero-world, there's almost always some level of gold digging with such a large age-gap.    I'm sure you will get people on here saying "sure it's possible, etc, etc etc" but in real life it always boils down to "conditional relationship" when it comes to "older vs younger" age-gap relationships.    Dont get hurt. Dont get played. The bottom line is you need to keep it real, and never be in denial about what the truth is regarding your relationship.    As a person who's always dated much younger, the one thing i know for sure in this world is that there is "no free lunch" and it's always "conditional" with age-gap relationships in the gay community.|`|08QtgdpOaa	Hi. I'm 28. If I thought we could have a future together, then absolutely. Honestly, I would have to say I prefer men closer to my age, and hopefully not younger than me. But I decide these things on how well I get on with someone. Though, I have to say, the older someone is in regard to my age, it's less likely that we are in the right places in our lives to be together.    Cheers mate.|`|AA11226034	There are younger guys that are genuinely attracted to older guys. I myself, whos 27, have always been attracted to older guys, ever since I first started dating. When I was in my early 20s, I dated guys that were in their early 40s. And I never dated anyone for money or for anything. I dont take age into consideration. Its about the person and who they are. But I have seen these seedy guys that look for older men just to use them for their money.  My advice, just take your time in finding someone and really get to know them first before you put your heart in it. And thats at any age.|`|JXH8SDqOaa	Yes. I'm 30 and I was looking for someone in his mid 40's, just because he'd probably be past the looking stage and would want to settle down. Unfortunately most guys that age are either taken, or bogged down with emotional baggage.|`|R7smL5mQaa	Sorry I can't be of any more help, unfortunately I'm not a male lol, but I'm sure if someone truley loves you they'll accept you for whoever and whatever you are!!|`|HAHDipTAaa	There sure are - Paulo and I are happy and we have a good relationship.

Re9Pdfxbaa	sympathy is not the right word for the terrible atrocities committed against the jews, namely the holocaust.  it goes beyond words.  today, we find the israelis murdering indiscriminately, as witnessed in gaza recently.  the world says nothing.  it is allowed to happen.  is it a case of the abused becoming the abuser?  there can be no justification for their actions, but they also have nuclear power which is something being denied to other middle east countries.  they have become monstrous in their defensiveness.|`|AA11304025	Yes , you would think that nothing bad ever happened to anybody else.  But the bad behaviour of the jews in the Middle East started long before the holocaust , it was going on in the 1920s and 30s.  Their official policy is to eliminate all Christians and Muslims from the lands they claim and create a Greater Israel.  They still have someway to go so a lot more people will die yet.|`|Hxqk9LoHaa	All peoples have been persecuted at one time or another, yet there are only certain groups that constantly bring it up.

TEtOq1XCaa	Natural selection is not evolution - it is the proliferating of already existing information, as any non-propagandist science book will explain. The genes for tall men were already there from the beginning when God made us.    My bet is that your observation is not due to natural selection (more likely due to diet, environment etc.), as women do not marry a man primarily based on his height. Even if they did, men do not marry women based on height - probably the opposite, which would nullify the effect of any height preference of females.|`|UITfm0fjaa	Change does not mean evolution.

I don't have any idea why I like tall guys, but I definitely do.    I'm only one person, of course, and that's not enough for a statistical sample, by any means, but I'm reasonably sure that I'm not the only woman that feels this way.  That said, there are many, MANY other qualities that I care about far more, and one of the men that I've found most attractive in my entire life is only about 5'5" :-)    Edit:  Yes, honey, I'm a biology student and geneticist-wannabe, working on my PhD in botany/biochemistry.  I'm fairly well-acquiainted with what evolution is.  I didn't ask why it works - I know; I said I don't know why *I* personally am attracted to taller men, all other things being equal.

We can't do genetic testing on everyone we want to have kids with.|`|9onFys4baa	Tallness = robust    But in this social world of ours, if we made it trendy for women to be attracted to short fat men, then we would have more short fat men....Ah the beauty of natural selection.

Hence, it would appear that yes this occurs.    And genetically, height does have an inherited aspect - although this is actually a 'potential for height' in that nutrition is still an important element: both pre- and postnatal.    It is a feature emerging from evolution; but it would appear to have been an emergent feature for which humans had a potential from the outset - rather than a new modification - in that it is uniform in all populations of humans.|`|473ccf4ea2cfb964f9c69e3f165455e3aa	100 years is a little too short of a time period to be putting it on evolution, even with some 'artificial selection' thrown in.|`|6DmsiLGbaa	I don't know about women in general, but I do.  I'm only five freakin' two, for Pete's sake!  I can't see over the counter at the bank, I can't get anything down even from middle shelves without jumping and usually falling over, and I have to look up at EVERYBODY.  It's annoying, and I'd never want to do that to my offspring.  I figure that I'd have to marry a guy at least six foot tall to make up for my midget self.      And I do agree with you about genetics, though all of my brothers are at least six feet tall (I have a fourteen year old brother who is already that tall, and he'll probably be way over that by the time he's fully matured.  I'm just a throwback, I guess).  Is it a beneficial trait?  I dunno, but I want my children to be able to get things down from high shelves.|`|OT4SrmDXaa	I saw a study on TV once where woman would choose a tall gruesome man over a short well proportied decent looking man.    I think many woman prefer a tall man over a short man.    I am not a woman so I don't know but I do see many woman prefer tall and ugly.

But its over rated, and its not for everyone. I was a popular kid in school, because I did everything. Student Council, President of Drama Club, Drum Major of Marching Band, Soccer, President of Hi-Y (All boys club), etc. But thats cus I liked to busy and multi-task and it was fun for me to be stressed. If being stressed isn't fun for you, then no it's not. Haha. I was being myself, and thats what made it fun. As long as you're being yourself, Aaron, then thats all that matters, because thats whats going to bring you the most joy in your life. Don't change and become someone your not just to be popular, I saw and met kids that did that, and they hated themselves. Yeah, I hung out with everyone in high school, but thats because I'm a social butterfly. I still had my bff that knew stuff about me that no one else did, and even though I could walk in the halls and say hey to everyone and get a response back, it never made me a better person than say you. As long as I'm true to myself, and you're true to yourself, than we're equals. =D    And yeah, I was openly gay since Junior year of high school.

(I never kissed any guys, but I'd guess it was the same with guys!)    Some girls kiss like they're in a hurry.  Their bodies get all stiff like  when you pick up a cat that doesn't want to be picked up.  They act like they're not really into kissing, like they're thinking about something else.  No fun.  I always thought it was me.    But other girls throw themselves into kissing.  It's like it's the most important thing in the world, just at the moment.  Every kiss is like that last kiss before you go off to war. 8^)  And not just one kiss and there, you're done, but another one and another one.      And there's a skill to it too.  Not too dry, not too slobbery, not too hard or too soft.

Don't drool.|`|7158cf5ad6b257f1eff62f9759b44304aa	a good kiss is somewhere in between friendly kiss and going to second base kiss.    it's soft and gentle, not wanting anything more but that kiss.|`|N8UwWt2Kaa	I think it's different for everybody. Certain people like different things when it comes to kissing. But for me personally I like soft lips and gentleness, that's always nice. I also like it when it's not rushed or if I feel like my face is being swallowed. Basically someone who knows how to share the experience.

She might just be nervous, it's always awkward when you're a first-timer. Or, if you guys are good friends she might be scared of losing you if you take the relationship to the next level.     I know you like her, but I think you're going to have to leave this one up to her. Just tell her that you didn't mean to put her on the spot, and you guys don't have to talk about it anymore if she doesn't want to. I think it's best if you see what happens from there, who knows maybe she'll come to you.    Best of luck to you
AA10098101	My wife as a child (I believe about 4 years old) drowned in a backyard swimming pool.  She had the typical "light at the end of a tunnel" experience, and a man (she now knows to be Jesus) held her hand and told her that she couldn't come in yet, that she had to go back.  Her mother needed her there.      I sure is a lot more interesting when she tells it.|`|YHmr7nvsaa	Science has been able to prove what the bright light story is all about and it isn't anything supernatural.|`|39AfwRL5aa	Due to extreme oxygen deprivation extremely realistic hallucinations occur before you die =) Those who manage to survive and come back and regain consciousness and remember it will turn it into one of these stories. The hallucinations that occur in these situations along with dreams that occur in certain depths of electromagnetism exposure are in accord with the persons own beliefs and recent thoughts. If a person is a Christian they will experience something to do with Jesus, perhaps, if they are a Muslim they may experience their 72 virgins, some may go to hell in their state. But it all a trick of the mind. When it is dying or exposed to certain other conditions.
AA11707311	Yes, but the price is repentance, and belief. This will lead to faith and obedience.  I was once lost, had a black heart, and could have easily been called wicked. Now I am secure in the promise of Jesus to forgive me, and have no desire to sin. I am a changed man.|`|AA11564934	god and sin are both meaningless concepts|`|syMxQEF3aa	Jesus didn't die on the cross, one of his companions did. None of us is automatically forgiven just because we accept Christ, If someone was a murderer, a thief but they believed inChrist dying for their sins, does that mean he will go to heaven?    If you sincerely repent then you will be forgiven. Forgiveness is tied to repentence.|`|2ieiGIhTaa	I wouldn't worship (or believe in) any God who didn't forgive sin.

I am a sinner by being born in sin.  Jesus died that we might have a chance at everlasting life.  It's not as if we don't have to work for it.  His death didn't erase sin from man.  If we accept his sacrifice and do what is needed to earn this reward then his death is not in vain.  It is a gift from our creator that he gave his only son that we might attain a future reward.  It isn't free without our changing how we live.    God forgives those who are trying to find him.  People sin everyday and until they try to change and seek his wisdom then they are still sinners.|`|UAq9ogIQaa	turn to christ if you want to feel better,   he said let no soul fear to come to me for forgiveness.   the darker the sin,the greater the mercy....   but there is a catch......you cant go do some horrible thing to get greater mercy,you must feel sorry for your sins,it has to be real repentance,real regret.   when you turn to him,he starts you on a journey of healing and self discovery...it changes your emotions,and eases the body...he takes a load off you,and you feel lighter and new....sometimes it takes time,sometime its instant....but he is the soul doctor.i know firsthand.|`|zUMvC6QEaa	Jesus died on the cross not to remove all sin from mankind, but to be able to have your sins forgiven. There is a difference. The only way to have your sins forgiven is through the Sacrament of Reconciliation. All sins committed before Baptism are forgiven. All sins committed after Baptism have to be forgiven.|`|tGAt3ZKkaa	if you are truly sorry, tell him, remember you cant trick god into thinking your sorry if your not, if you mean it and you say it, bam! your sins are gone|`|a9eWbAMGaa	yes he does, you just have to believe and have faith in christ.|`|wK7LSyUyaa	yaaaaaaaa|`|EtfADEkyaa	God forgives you of the sins you repent for|`|7KeAlaAVaa	God IS Jesus.

And he will forgive.|`|jGgOVd5Zaa	Um, you started off with a question there but by the end you had given yourself an answer and were just kind of making a statement.    Edit-  I'm not a very spiritual person.  The other day someone recognized me from high school and asked if I remembered him.  I said, "Yes, you used to beat up my little brother all the time."  He couldn't think of anything to say for a couple minutes.  Then he asked me for my forgiveness.  (He's since become a born again Christian.)  This all happened back when we were kids, but I didn't really feel comfortable forgiving him.  I told him so.  Really, he needed my brother's forgiveness, not mine.    In any situation, I think the first person you should seek forgiveness from is the person you have wronged.  If it is more of empirical sort of sin, like taking the lords name in vain, then, if you believe in God, certainly ask his forgiveness.  I'd frown on trying to get forgiveness from God if you haven't at least asked for forgiveness from those you may have wronged.    As for 'Those who don't accept Jesus keep their sin and aren't forgiven.'  I hope you realize that there are two entirely different takes on that just within the Christian faith.  There Evangelical groups that believe this way, but there are also huge swaths of Christianity that believe that you are judged by what you do, that a good man who is a Hindu or a good Buddhist can get to Heaven (even a good atheist, although that might confuse the atheist a bit) can go to Heaven.  That is what separates the conservative and progressive branches of the faith.  If you are interested in seeing some very nuanced discussion of faith you might stop over at Meaningoflife.TV.  Cardinal Lorenzo Albacete's interview is wonderful.|`|M35SoYqiaa	Yes God forgives sin, if people ask forgiveness. Jesus is God in the flesh, so accepting God and accepting Jesus are one and the same. Some people may not want to be forgiven- man does have free choice- so God will not force anyone to repent and spend eternity with him, even though he would like them to.|`|6pbzg2oBaa	I am sinless. I can not be forgiven.|`|AA11955963	Dying on the cross is an illustration.God is Good and not evil.For Him there is no such thing as Sin,which is a perception of wrong-doing by us ,humans.So he does not have to excuse whatever that WE perceive as Sin.

"me and her " can not do anything. ok?    hi sweetie, welcome to the other side.  just teasing. You are still unsure of yourself. You might want to contact the gay center and PFLAG.ORG and get some info about being a lesbian. See if there are any young women's groups available. A gay straight alliance at the high school would be perfect. It would help you understand your feelings if you could talk to others who are on the same journey as you. Gay people all come out at different times on their paths, sometimes they get it really young and some of us waste a lot of time and even get married before we get it. (been there, done that) Ask either the gay center  or PFLAG about a gay friendly counselor so you can talk about your feelings without any prejudice or pressure. Also, ask for info for your folks so you have it when it's time to come out. That's what PFLAG is for. Ooh, also be careful that your door is locked- you don't want anyone walking in on you as you're just getting to know each other . It would be really traumatizing. I wish the best for you. Have a great life.

The humidity is 96% according to my weather station, and the dew point is only a degree lower than the current temperature; if we start to get any onshore flow from the Pacific, we could easily see snow, but rain is far more likely, despite a very cloudless sky at the moment :-)    "My" raccoons have already been by for their nightly visit and handout of grapes, raisins, bread, or whatever I happen to have on hand ;-)  In the morning, I'll undoubtedly see several kinds of sparrows, Steller's jays, spotted towhees, finches, and at least two "races" of juncos, as well as my local merlin, if I get lucky.  There's an eagle's nest not far from me, and a Great Blue Heron rookery that's starting to show signs of life already.

Before we have children and lives of our own, we can afford to make mistakes that are life altering at a later point if we had made them.    This safety net, although necessary, also makes most people take hardships lessons for granted and don't truly learn from them as we should.    Youth is a time for great learning-not partying and making a fool of yourself.  But so many do just that-and waste the pinnacle of their lives accomplishing nothing of any value and often, very much of detriment.    Yes, you only live once, and yes, you're only young once-but remember you're only old once too.  You can party in your youth to the detriment of your older age-or you can plan in your youth to the benefit of your older age.    Keep careful note of the lessons laid in front of you everyday, and you'll be better off for it and have nothing to regret in your later years.    They say "Live in the moment"-but that only helps (and possibly hurts) now.    I say, "Learn from the moment"-and enrich yourself for the rest of your life.    The lessons are indeed there-from your earliest years-most only learn from them when it's too late and the final result manifested itself already to their grief.

The church doesn't (or shouldn't, anyway) condemn homosexuals.  They are people in need of God, just like the rest of us.  They should be welcomed with open arms by the church, just as Jesus welcomes them, even though He cannot condone their actions (just as He cannot condone any of our sins; and yes, homosexual acts are sin; just as lying, cheating, stealing, and coveting are.)|`|49c07573b2ef8b7f4c512a10de7d7febaa	Hmm... what's your problem with rich people tonight/today?  Somebody forget to give you your allowance or something, little girl?|`|SwtaUd56aa	First of all, the concept of "kingdom of God" is much different than the concept of "Heaven" (to which you refer in saying "going to Heaven").    Second, Christians should think very seriously on the negative aspects of wealth and take seriously some of Jesus' statements.    Third, just because the Bible does not report Jesus saying anything about homosexuality in action, doesn't mean he would of improved of it. (And the evidence suggests that Jesus -- considering he was a first century Jew -- would have been opposed to homosexuality in action, as was Paul).|`|b57b651854cad9f8163199d57bf6d9b6aa	they were always in the close back then , or 'caves'    I am thrilled w/Jesus, but He too, accepted money.

Rom 1:24  Wherefore God also gave them up to uncleanness through the lusts of their own hearts, to dishonour their own bodies between themselves:     Rom 1:25  Who changed the truth of God into a lie, and worshipped and served the creature more than the Creator, who is blessed for ever. Amen.     Rom 1:26  For this cause God gave them up unto vile affections: for even their women did change the natural use into that which is against nature:     Rom 1:27  And likewise also the men, leaving the natural use of the woman, burned in their lust one toward another; men with men working that which is unseemly, and receiving in themselves that recompence of their error which was meet.     Rom 1:28  And even as they did not like to retain God in their knowledge, God gave them over to a reprobate mind, to do those things which are not convenient;     Rom 1:29  Being filled with all unrighteousness, fornication, wickedness, covetousness, maliciousness; full of envy, murder, debate, deceit, malignity; whisperers,     Rom 1:30  Backbiters, haters of God, despiteful, proud, boasters, inventors of evil things, disobedient to parents,     Rom 1:31  Without understanding, covenantbreakers, without natural affection, implacable, unmerciful:     Rom 1:32  Who knowing the judgment of God, that they which commit such things are worthy of death, not only do the same, but have pleasure in them that do them.             'God also gave them up'      Happy now?|`|a993fdffebb5d1eb64fe6baba1499d98aa	Actually, he didn't "condemn" anybody.  He spoke out against certain things, but He did not condemn anyone.    And, being that Jesus is God, it's good to note that God speaks out against homosexuality in the book of Romans, calling it an abomination.    Now then, that said, homosexuality alone is not the sin that will condemn a person to hell. Rejecting Jesus Christ as Savior, however, will.     Read the Bible and know and understand all that it says. Ask God to help you understand it, and He will.     "For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life. For God sent not his Son into the world to condemn the world; but that the world through him might be saved.   He that believeth on him is not condemned: but he that believeth not is condemned already, because he hath not believed in the name of the only begotten Son of God.   And this is the condemnation, that light is come into the world, and men loved darkness rather than light, because their deeds were evil."  John 3:16-19    "For this reason God gave them over to degrading passions; for their women exchanged the natural function for that which is unnatural, and in the same way also the men abandoned the natural function of the woman and burned in their desire toward one another, men with men committing indecent acts and receiving in their own persons the due penalty of their error."  Romans1:26, 27    "He that believeth in the Son of God hath the witness in himself; he that believeth not God hath made Him a liar, because he believeth not the record that God gave of His Son.  And this is the record: that God hath given to us eternal life, and this life is in His Son. He that hath the Son hath life, and he that hath not the Son hath not life." IJohn 5:10-12    **EDIT**  Paul wrote the words of God... so they are still God's word. Hence, Jesus's words.  WHat don't you understand about that? Either the Bible is all true or it is all false. It isn't up for picking and choosing which parts you think you agree with or don't. If you don't believe in God, let it be so.  But don't think that you can just pick and choose according to your likes and dislikes and somehow "invent" Him. Jesus NEVER says that any of the commandments are false. The commandments came to prove that we could not keep them... alone... Jesus said that He did not come to abolish the law, but to fulfill it. We can only keep the law, ourselves, by placing our faith in Him completely.  Read your Bible with understanding and ask God to give you understanding as you read.|`|dFBccLExaa	Oh I wish more people were like you!   I'm not a Jesus follower, but I do like what he taught- unfortunately, more and more Christians are forgetting his teachings, and are acting more hatefully than ever. I personally see nothing wrong with letting the gays live their life the way that they want. Esp. in a "free" country, I don't see why they should have to live in persecution from a church that touts the loving of others.   Just my two cents.|`|ZoSpdTIbaa	MAYBE BECAUSE THERE WEREN'T THAT MANY GAY PEOPLE AT THE TIME, OR WERE OPENLY GAY.|`|Nf0FLjGhaa	never condemned homosexuals? seriously?    Leviticus 20:13  "If a man also lie with man, as he lieth with a woman, both of them have committed an abomination: they shall surely be put to death..."    edit: the old testament is the word of god, is it not? and according to jesus himself, he is god (John 10:30 - "I and my father are one.."), therefor, the teachings of the old testament are in fact the teachings of jesus    edit (again): so jesus, who claims he IS god, denounced things God supposedly said? well then, he's either flip-flopping to make everybody happy, or somebody other than god was responsible for at least part of the old testament. in the first case, how do know which parts we should actually abide by? in the second, how would we know what's actually the word of god and what isn't? there is of course, a third option: the bible is full of stupid contradictions, and nobody can tell with any certainy which parts are right and which are wrong. all three of these would, of course, render this discussion moot|`|gwEubXRjaa	hey, definitely Bible condemns homosexuals.
Icwz678Qaa	Who are these people you speak of?    There will not NO sin in heaven.    The Almighty turned His face against His own beloved Son while He adhered all the sins of the world.

But I am a Christian and I believe that God hates gluttony, laziness and greed, and does not want his children to live like that.    Greediness is wanting more and more of everything, not exactly having great wealth. You can be rich and not be greedy (my opinion)|`|dqZrq7Zeaa	oh yeah! some heavens like muslim heaven have sex! Gluttony but you never have to use the toilet!    how weird is that?|`|bxYWJAYNaa	Mmmm, I think the fattest and richest country in the world is in pretty big trouble then.    Does the Bible actually rank sins, like homosexuality is level 10 bad, but gluttony or greed only gives you a 1? So gays are really evil, and fat or rich people are only a little bit evil?  I can't remember reading anything about that anywhere. Unless you get decide for yourself, and downplay your own foibles while being free to bash others.|`|Xt4n9h40aa	There will be NO sin in heaven.  Sin is sin.  There are no small sins, big sins.  Being slothful will send you to hell just the same as killing the innocent.  Anyone who thinks sin will be allowed in heaven seriously needs to spend some time in deep Bible study because their belief is not lining up w/ the Word of God.    By the way...beign wealthy will not keep you out of heaven.  It is when you put your money above God that it hinders your eternity w/ the Father.  To put money above God is to make money your (false) god.  (Thou shalt have NO other gods before me.)|`|LOYeeweAaa	I know u r referring 2 one of the ans I gave abt heaven.

I've seen his daughter Shirley battling her conscience on TV.   She really looked like she was about to cry when Louie Theroux read out a quote from the mother of the soldier whose funeral they were picketting.

James 1:19 says 'so then my beloved brethren, let every man be swift to hear, slow to speak, slow to wrath; for the wrath of man does not produce the righteousness of God.' God loves us all, Jesus died for us all. it is our sin that God has a problem with. I don't think God intends for us to use hate to reach out to others, but to use His word and His love. a relationship with the Lord is a personal one between that person and the Lord. we should all review our relationship to Him and search His word. we should know right away that what this man is doing is not christian or right.|`|uCB3VHv5aa	I have actually seen him in person...at a GLBT conference in Kansas years ago...he and others like him take things too literal and hate a lot of people... the forgot the rule in the Bible where God is the ONLY one who can judge our lives...|`|tUOUy2Ewaa	Oh gosh it annoys me so much.... they had the cheek on news intrviews to tell their interviewers that they knew nothing about The Bible and they couldnt and werent Christians grrrrr|`|SO7zRZK9aa	Yes, this is OLD news (like 2 or 3 years old), everybody knows about him, everybody hates him.

I came out late in life, after I had been married for several years. I think they were so glad to get rid of that son-in-law, that the shock of my coming out wasn't as shocking.   Family was in pretty much good health: mother heavy  Had a very close relationship with my mother (still do at 60 yrs old) and 3 out of 4 siblings..    Father was intellectual and into computers back in the early 60s, worked all the time, was not close to the kids at all.    Interesting little survey.  I think we were lower middle class, did alright..|`|YdD200a6aa	I'm open about my life, so here it goes...    My family is not dysfunctional. It was just my sister and I... and because my dad is in the military, he's never home. My parents have stayed together for at least 25 years now, and they seem to be happy together.    I rarely spent time with my sister or my mom... I usually hung out with my friends (boys and girls) growing up.    I haven't told my parents about myself yet because, like I said, my dad is in the military and is simply against homosexuality. My mom is hardcore Christian and finds it wrong.. so I haven't told either of them. They would kick me out of the house if they ever did find out, though. :(|`|l8c2kTlvaa	not my family, we are as dysfunctional as you can get. and my mother doesnt even realise it, she thinks eveyones happy :)|`|ezNSyvqeaa	That is a very interesting question!  I think my family was about as picture perfect as it can get.  The weird thing is that it wasn't just all a big show for the public.  We really lived like that.  My parents have been married almost 30 yrs and neither me nor any one of my 3 siblings have ever heard them argue.  They have always shown great love and commitment to each other as well as to each of us.  They were always there to support me during my sporting events, and even as an adult it isn't rare to see them in the bleachers cheering me and my friends on.    Other than a few awkward teenage yrs, I have always had an excellent relationship with both of my parents.  Everyone in my family is very healthy and active and I would say that we are far from poverty (but also far from being rich).  All in all I have been incredibly blessed in the family department!|`|NTongQ9iaa	your combination of questions is thought provoking. I am anxious to see what others say. Will reserve my comments with the exception of the fact that even though my parents never seperated, they had some real bad arguments that ran all night often and woke up to start all over again....it was tough for me until i grew up and left.

WGzb3Fhaaa	It is sad to say but very very few Indian youth actually know anything about the great mythology and culture of India. Many youth hold Western Culture in a high position, and they shun Indian culture and get embarrassed by it.     This change in youth has made them lose their self esteem, you know why? Because what they follow and what they like is not their own, it is foreign. They believe that nothing they have (culture, traditions etc) is better than Western(English).    And this western culture has made Indian Youth mere Imitators and Hypocrites, and bad imitators at that.    This has happened due to many reason, the media, the society, the education etc. And it was a plan of British to replace the existing Indian culture by British culture, way of thinking and habits, and I have to say that they have succeeded.|`|M2vrjRy8aa	I think you are the same questioner who was that day comparing Brahmn gyaan with atheism...so on what grounds are you questioning the knowledge of Hindus or the state of thier religion?

But consider that it will take some time to master the alphabet before you can actually start learning Russian. This will probably make German easier.|`|8YUtmEU7aa	Russian is a more difficult language to learn, if you already speak English.  English is a Germanic language, so they have a lot in common.  I don't know which has a higher population speaking the language, but you're more likely to run into German speaking tourists, or Russian speaking immigrants, in the USA, from my experience.    Days of the week in German:  Sontag, Montag, Dienstag, Mittwoch, Donnerstag, Freitag, Samstag (or Sonnabend)    "Tag" means day.  Pretty difficult to translate most of those to English, eh?|`|wJ45gsyZaa	Go for German.

Russian has 6 cases, German only has 3.5 (okay 4, but Genative is dying out in some ways).    (Don't know what a declination is? In English you will only ever find it in personal pronouns:  *She* kicks the ball, I kick *her*  I gave him a present, he gave me a present  Also: Thou art beautiful. I gave thee a pear.  That's only 2 cases right there.)  Basically, English speakers are more or less completely unused to declining every single noun in a foreign language.    HOWEVER, I would recommend Russian, because that nation is really gaining power on the world stage. In several years, Russia and China may well be the main economic powers of the world.    So I'd say go with Russian. Declination can be learned. And you'll get to write in a cool looking alphabet, eh?|`|675240e4767a78efb825e156326f38d1aa	I would take German for sure but that's only because it is part of my heritage.

RZetcwalaa	And now for the actual truth,     Jesus who may or may not have existed is one of the biggest myths ever, the jesus story that is described in the new testament is a mixture of old legends taken from many cultures and mixed together to form a blanket religion all are capable of following, from the widely populated myth of jesus being born on december 25th (birth date of many legendery leaders/pagan gods) to the crucifixtion wich is also shared by several other pagan demigods.    The greek demigod (his name fails me) could also turn water into wine, many leaders/demigods are claimed to be of virgin birth, almost all end up being killed. The new testamant was simply written to fullfill the old testamant phrophecies (not a hard task) the bible has not predicted anything with the codes (look up moby dick predicts assasinations), and no events have actually occured that the bible specificaly predicted.    Result jesus was a religous leader of the jews. Probably nothing more.|`|hR7OsqtRaa	In John 8:58 "I tell you the truth," Jesus answered, "before Abraham was born, I am!"

There are a lot more chapters and verses mentioned in the below website along with music, speeches and praise and worship.    http://jesustrinity.blogspot.com    Jesus is God. He is alive forever.    The questions usually asked are:-    1) Did Jesus really exist?  2) Is Jesus God?  3) If Jesus is God, then why did He keep praying to the Father in Heaven? How can the Father and Jesus be one God? Why did Jesus have to suffer on the Cross?  4) What is the Holy Spirit?  5) What is so special about Jesus? Why cant I just view him as an ordinary man or a teacher or a prophet? Why should I see him as God?      It would not be possible to give a short answer to these questions .    I suggest you visit the below website.    After visiting the below website, you would get a lot of answers.    http://jesustrinity.blogspot.com    1.Thomas calls Jesus God in John 20:28 (Note, Thomas addresses Jesus  specifically.)  2. Jesus is God in Heb. 1:8  3. John the apostle states that Jesus was the Word which was God that became  flesh (John 1:1-14)  4. The phrase "Call upon the name of the LORD" (Hebrew, YHWH, i.e., Psalm  116:4) used only of God on the OT, and translated into the Greek in the LXX as  "Call upon the name of the LORD (greek, KURIOS)," applied to Jesus in the NT  (1 Cor. 1:2) Jesus is God in flesh  5. The apostle John says that Jesus was , "...calling God His own Father,  making Himself equal to God," (John 5:18)  6. Jesus said that He and the Father are One (John 10:30), that caused the Pharisees to  claim that Jesus was making Himself out to be God.  7. Jesus knew all things (John 21:17)  8. Jesus knew all men (John 16:30)  9. Jesus is everywhere (Matt. 28:20)  10. Jesus Christ, dwells in you (Col. 1:27)  11. Jesus is the exact representation of the Nature of God (Heb. 1:3)  12. Jesus is eternal (Micah 5:1-2)  13. Jesus gives eternal life (John 10:27-28)  14. Jesus is our only Lord and Master (Jude 4)  15. Jesus is called the Mighty God (Isaiah 9:6)  16.

In the OT God was seen (Exodus 6:2-3;Exodus 24:9-11; Num. 12:6-9; Acts  7:2), yet no man can see God (Exodus 33:20; John 1:18). It was not the Father  that was seen in the OT (John 6:46).

T    Far from being a fierce champion of the oppressed, a crucified clown, befuddled mystic or well-intentioned charlatan, Jesus was the most balanced individual who has ever lived. He was a man of courage, manliness and strength, yet he was not ashamed to show tenderness; a man who could enjoy a wedding feast, but who always put spiritual interests first; a man who maintained himself in perfection, though he was never demanding, arrogant or overbearing with others.Matthew, chapter 23; 11:28-30; John 13:1-16; 2:1-12.|`|TcNklmBVaa	Jesus in the Glorious Qur'an     Introduction     The Quran tells us a lot of wonderful things about Jesus.  As a result, believers in the Quran love Jesus, honour him, and believe in him.  In fact, no Muslim can be a Muslim unless he or she believes in Jesus, on whom be peace.    The Quran says that Jesus was born of a virgin, that he spoke while he was still only a baby, that he healed the blind and the leper by Gods leave, and that he raised the dead by Gods leave.    What then is the significance of these miracles?  First, the virgin birth.  God demonstrates his power to create in every way.  God created everyone we know from a man and a woman.  But how about Adam, on whom be peace?  God created him from neither a man nor a woman.  And Eve from only a man, but not a woman.  And, finally, to complete the picture, God created Jesus from a woman, but not a man.    What about the other miracles?  These were to show that Jesus was not acting on his own behalf, but that he was backed by God.  The Quran specifies that these miracles were performed by Gods leave.  This may be compared to the Book of Acts in the Bible, chapter 2, verse 22, where it says that the miracles were done by God to show that he approved of Jesus.  Also, note that Jesus himself is recorded in the Gospel of John to have said, I can do nothing of my own authority (5:30).  The miracles, therefore, were done not by his own authority, but by Gods authority.    What did Jesus teach?  The Quran tells us that Jesus came to teach the same basic message which was taught by previous prophets from Godthat we must shun every false god and worship only the one true God.  Jesus taught that he is the servant and messenger of that one true God, the God of Abraham. These Quranic teachings can be compared with the Bible ( Mark 10:18; Matthew 26:39; John 14:28, 17:3, and 20:17) where Jesus teaches that the one he worshipped is the only true God.  See also Matthew 12:18; Acts 3:13, and 4:27 where we find that his disciples knew him as Servant of God.    The Quran tells us that some of the Israelites rejected Jesus, and conspired to kill him, but Allah (God) rescued Jesus and raised him to Himself.  Allah will cause Jesus to descend again, at which time Jesus will confirm his true teachings and everyone will believe in him as he is and as the Quran teaches about him.    Jesus is the Messiah.  He is a word from Allah, and a spirit from Him.  He is honoured in this world and in the hereafter, and he is one of those brought nearest to Allah.    Jesus was a man who spoke the truth which he heard from God.  This can be compared with the Gospel According to John where Jesus says to the Israelites:  You are determined to kill me, a man who has told you the truth that I heard from God (John 8:40).       The Virgin Birth of Jesus  Muslims believe in the virgin birth of Jesus.  When the angels announced to Mary (peace be upon her) about Allahs promise that she will have a son, she was surprised, since she was a virgin.  How can this be?  she thought.  She was reminded that it is easy for Allah to create whatever he wills.    She said:  My Lord!  How can I have a child when no mortal hath touched me?  He said:  So (it will be).  Allah createth what He will.  If He decreeth a thing, He saith unto it only:  Be!  and it is (Quran 3:47).    It is not difficult for Allah to do anything he wants.  He can create a child with both human parents or only one.  No miracle is beyond His power.  After all, He had created Adam (peace be upon him) from neither a man nor a woman.  He created the rest of us from both man and woman.  What is so hard if Allah decides to create a human being from a woman only?  He only commands Be!  and it occurs.    Some people think that since Jesus, peace be upon him, had no human father then God must be his father.  The Quran rejects this view.  The position of Jesus with Allah is comparable to the position of Adam with Allah.  Just because Adam had no human parent does not mean we should call him the Son of God.    Lo! the likeness of Jesus with Allah is as the likeness of Adam.  He created him from dust, then He said unto him:  Be! and he is. (Quran 3:59).    According to the Quran, everyone except Allah are His servants.    And they say:  the Beneficent hath taken unto Himself a Son.  Assuredly ye utter a disastrous thing, whereby almost the heavens are torn, and the earth is split asunder and the mountains fall to ruins, that ye ascribe to the Beneficent a son, when it is not meet for (the Majesty of) the Beneficent that He should chose a son.  There is none in the heavens and the earth but cometh unto the Beneficent as a slave.  (Quran 19:88-93)       The Miracles of Jesus  According to the Quran, Jesus, on whom be peace, performed the following miracles by Allahs leave:    1.  Spoke while he was only a baby.  2.  Healed those born blind.  3.  Healed the lepers.  4.  Revived the dead.  5.  Breathed life into a bird mad|`|CGr6EtRUaa	A Healer, who was put to death for contradicting the strict religious taboos of his day.|`|si3eq11haa	Jesus Christ is God.   He is God made flesh / human.

y28DO2lbaa	In general, Women are attracted to masculinity and men are attracted to femininity.  For what ever reason, in our society no matter how manly and man is, bisexuality is a very emasculating quality, but if a girl is very feminine, her being bisexual isn't seen as making her any less famine.     Also, the thought of loosing your lover to someone else is very hurtful. Loosing your man to another woman is a woman's worst nightmare, and she then compares herself to the other women to see why she is better than her. losing your man to another man is just horrifying to a woman.

vGWD8Zncaa	Possibly your conversational partners in English are speaking to you on a more simple level; either because they're trying to "adjust to you" because they know it's not your native language or because they speak simply anyway  :-)    At any rate, find some people who speak English at a high, complex level and who are willing to make suggestions to you as you speak for your own improvement.  Tell people you WANT constructive criticism!  That would help immensely.    Were I in your vicinity I'd surely volunteer towards that end  ;-)|`|T5DbLLgQaa	Learning language well requires being as active as possible and making the learning fun for yourself. Taking lessons is always important, but equally important are these:    1) Listen/watch: Listen to internet radio stations like BBC, watch TV shows in English (use only subtitles, NOT voice dubbing!), etc.    2) Write/communicate: Try to find discussion forums from the web about things that you find interesting (music/various artists, hobbies, etc.) and start communicating there with other people using English. Start using instant messaging systems in case you find some new friends or start emailing them.    3) Buy yourself a proper dictionary, and each time when you see a strange word that you do not understand, look it up.    The main point in ANY language learning is to make it as fun as possible for yourself. Try to find topics that interest you, read online newspapers, listen to BBC/NBC and other radio stations online, if you find a discussion forum for e.g. your favourite hobby or your idols in music do participate there, etc.     Last but not least: NEVER EVER use ANY online translators, they are nothing but utter rubbish!!    Good luck!|`|7e2774dbd0f5dfe71e63e178eb13001baa	Well, there's not so much a cause, but rather you just need to build your vocabulary. You could start with the dictionary, or you could buy a vocabulary book to increase your usage and understanding of new words.  Your paragraph above shows you can write quite well.  It's OK to speak and write in very simple English because it's not your native language.  You could go to the bookstore, or search Web sites that sell books for standardized tests for high school and/or college students, ones that have a focus on words and word usage.  If you decide to use a dictionary, just pick a new word a day. You could even get yourself a thesaurus, that will help you find different words with similar meanings.  And don't be too hard on yourself. English is one of the most difficult languages to learn. Others may make fun of people who learned English later on, but I have respect for people who are able to learn and use English. There's so many inconsistencies in English.  Anyway, keep it up!  Good luck!|`|8a6NPz9Waa	Honestly, you seem to speak better than the majority of the English speaking people. You should be proud.    In actual speech, it's rarely necessary to use even mildly complex words, lest you confuse the general public.|`|24ebc8edf978e269550ad9d8827de8dcaa	The reason for this is that we all understand a larger vocabulary than we use.    This is most obvious in children, you can use more words to your child and they will understand them than they will use in return to you.    So you being able to read and understand more words then you use is quite normal and even a natural English speaker...such as I, does exactly the same.    As for improvement, to build up your vocabulary you have to learn new words, it's as simple as that.  To learn to speak and write English better than you do at present you need to practice.    It's the same for me, if I want a bigger vocabulary then I have to learn new words.|`|X0x3iAJhaa	This is definitely not uncommon. I for one speak and write English well (because I am English). But some of my friends write terribly, with very bad grammar. If you can easily comprehend English when reading, try re-reading what you have written afterwards, this way, you will see where you have made mistakes and most likely realise how to fix it.    Hope this helps.

Matter is comprised of molecules are comprised of atoms are comprised of electrons/protons/neutrons are comprised of quarks.    What are quarks comprised of?  Many quantum physicists would propose "string theory", the idea that all things are in actuality made up of tiny vibrating "strings".  These strings are considered the very building blocks of time, space, and matter.  For any of these three to exist, the other 2 must be present (if you had time but no matter, it wouldn't work because time is the measurement of the movement of matter through space; if you had only matter, where and when would you put it?)  The book of Genesis states that God created everything (time space and matter) with spoken words.  Spoken words create sound waves and frequencies.  Frequencies cause vibration.  Everything is made up of "vibrating strings".    Coincidence?  I think not.

Interesting fact about the 100+ amino acids: some are "left-handed", and some are "right-handed." Only the 20 left-handed aminos can support life. So, out of the 100+, all 20 left handed aminos must have come together simultaneously.

MPbqO3e0aa	i could give you a logical, and not complicated explanation regarding the law of the Torah (three times repeated):  Exodus 23:19 The first of the firstfruits of thy land thou shalt bring into the house of the LORD thy God. Thou shalt not coock a kid in his mother's milk  ask again for this.  there is no law in the torah that forbid eating meat and cheese. this is from the Rabies of the talmud. there is no good reasoning for this. so, i am going to tell you a jewish joke that very ortodox jews may not like.  god said unto Moses: Thou shalt not coock a kid in his mother's milk  moses answered: i understand, we shall not coock meat and milk together. god repeated: Thou shalt not coock a kid in his mother's milk  yes, yes. said moses, we shall not eat meat and diary the same meal.  liten well, said god, Thou shalt not coock a kid in his mother's milk  sure said moses, we shall keep separate cutlery for meat and for diary.  i am tired of you, said god. do what you want.|`|AA11992885	Exodus 23:19 The first of the firstfruits of thy land thou shalt bring into the house of the LORD thy God.

The Torah does not explicitly state the reason for most kashrut laws, and many varied reasons have been offered for these laws, ranging from philosophical and ritualistic, to practical and hygienic.    This doesn't really answer your question, but it does show that it is a complex issue.|`|aO4iCwtoaa	Here's an easy rundown of the rules concerning meat and dairy:    " Separation of Meat and Dairy    On three separate occasions, the Torah tells us not to "boil a kid in its mother's milk." (Ex. 23:19; Ex. 34:26; Deut. 14:21). The Oral Torah explains that this passage prohibits eating meat and dairy together. The rabbis extended this prohibition to include not eating milk and poultry together. In addition, the Talmud prohibits cooking meat and fish together or serving them on the same plates, because it is considered to be unhealthy. It is, however, permissible to eat fish and dairy together, and it is quite common (lox and cream cheese, for example). It is also permissible to eat dairy and eggs together.    This separation includes not only the foods themselves, but the utensils, pots and pans with which they are cooked, the plates and flatware from which they are eaten, the dishwashers or dishpans in which they are cleaned, and the towels on which they are dried. A kosher household will have at least two sets of pots, pans and dishes: one for meat and one for dairy. See Utensils below for more details.    One must wait a significant amount of time between eating meat and dairy. Opinions differ, and vary from three to six hours. This is because fatty residues and meat particles tend to cling to the mouth. From dairy to meat, however, one need only rinse one's mouth and eat a neutral solid like bread, unless the dairy product in question is also of a type that tends to stick in the mouth.    The Yiddish words fleishik (meat), milchik (dairy) and pareve (neutral) are commonly used to describe food or utensils that fall into one of those categories.    Note that even the smallest quantity of dairy (or meat) in something renders it entirely dairy (or meat) for purposes of kashrut. For example, most margarines are dairy for kosher purposes, because they contain a small quantity of whey or other dairy products to give it a buttery taste. Animal fat is considered meat for purposes of kashrut. You should read the ingredients very carefully, even if the product is kosher-certified."  from http://www.jewfaq.org/kashrut.htm     Here's another excellent overview of all the kosher laws: http://www.ou.org/kosher/primer.html

I was doing about 45 and there was no where to go and no way to stop in time, I instinctively cried out "Jesus help me!" as I slammed on my breaks, Trying in that split second to decide if it would be better to hit the car in front of me or plow into the cement wall divider but to my great surprise, and relief, the front of my car dips down like some giant hand pushed on the hood and I stop with room to spare!

I did not realize it was a holy angel until the next day, when the Holy Spirit guided me to the scripture that said..'The angel of Jehovah is camping around all those fearing Him."    Then, during persecution from bad Jehovah's Witnesses, God revealed to us that many persons we could see were materialized angels, including Jesus and raised prophets.    Recently, God let me see many lakes and water streams which were being visited by thousands of angels. The water had strange markings on it. Then many times tiny lights, hundreds of them would move about. It made me think of the scripture in the new testament where the water was disturbed and the sick man couldn't get there fast enough to get healed, so Jesus healed him.    Then also, with the lights on the water, I was priveledged to see Moses, (MY HUSBAND) as an angel, who appeared to be greeting the angels who are coming to earth to prepare for the judgment day, the great tribulation, with Jesus.    This is one of the fullfillments of the scripture that there will be signs on earth. Acts 2:19

stAeoUeSaa	Here are three quick ways to prove it to yourself.      I. First: You exist.   If matter-energy can NOT be created, how did we even get her int he first place? But here we all are 'existing'. This implies the very hand of God leaving every atheist staring in the mirror asking themselves, "But how?"      II. Second: Big Bang and other cosmological evidence.   If you truly understand quantum mechanics then you will know that the Big Bang theory requires a creator by fiat. Think of the universe in reverse until it's small enough to be completely described by quantum mechanics alone. In order for the universe to start unfolding into what we see now, our universe's specific wave function had to be brought into existence as a certain possibility out of an infinite number of other possible wave functions that had to collapse or at least decohere. At this fuzzy nanoscopic beginning, this required a 'Prime Observer' to enable this and set the expansion of the universe into motion and those initial conditions became the very facets of physical law. What we refer to as this finely tuned 'reality'. This need for an 'observer' comes from the basic quantum mechanical concept known as Shrodinger's Cat. Also, we must remember that the universe is being said to have come from nowhere which implies an act of 'creation'.  This ever increasing expansion of our universe is alluded to 11 times in the Bible:  Job 9:8 ; Psalm 104:2 ; Isaiah 40:22 ; Isaiah 42:5 ; Isaiah 44:24 ; Isaiah 45:12 ; Isaiah 48:13 ; Isaiah 51:13 ; Jeremiah 10:12 ; Jeremiah 51:15 ; Zechariah 12:1   http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_bang  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schrodinger...  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wave_functi...  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decoherence      The Bible also alludes to the Big Rip:   Revelation 6:14 ; Isaiah 34:4 ; 2 Peter 3:10   http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_rip      III. Third: The fulfillment of hundreds of Biblical prophecies.  For instance here is one that was prophesied almost 2 millennia ago, yet has manifested itself now. Revelation 13:16-18   http://www.verichipcorp.com/|`|97d2a2d9ef8fc8e73e2d9c8436cd4609aa	Nope.  Science doesn't have the power to kill God.  In fact, in the end, science will confirm God.

Seek to walk in the path that the Lord has shown you and stick to it and you will help the young ones in time with their vision.
jGgOVd5Zaa	I'm an atheist, so I'm getting a kick out of these replies.    Sorry.  More seriously though, I read a really good article once that discussed Christianity.  It said basically that Christianity, for all it's sub-groups, really boiled down into two separate religions.  I'm mangling the details here, but basically there are Christians who live based on how God acts in the Bible and Christians who live based on how Jesus acts in the Bible.      The first group tends to include Evangelical groups and tends to be against gay rights, evolution, and other religions.  The second group includes groups like Unitarians who are so tolerant that you don't even have to be Christian to be a Unitarian (although many Unitarians consider themselves Christian.)  So, there are lots of Christians out there who don't hate atheists, in fact, my best friend is a Catholic.    Meaningoflife.tv has a wonderful interview with Cardinal(?)

Deut 29:18  Lest there should be among you man, or woman, or family, or tribe, whose heart turneth away this day from the LORD our God, to go and serve the gods of these nations; lest there should be among you a root that beareth gall and wormwood;  29:19 And it come to pass, when he heareth the words of this curse, that he bless himself in his heart, saying, I shall have peace, though I walk in the imagination of mine heart, to add drunkenness to thirst:  29:20 The LORD will not spare him, but then the anger of the LORD and his jealousy shall smoke against that man, and all the curses that are written in this book shall lie upon him, and the LORD shall blot out his name from under heaven.|`|QsCPOHAraa	Christianity programs its sheep to reject the people and the ideas and the logic that can free them from religiosity. Religion is imprisonment of the mind, sometimes voluntary by those who prefer the comfort of being confined in an illusion where God is looking after them and waiting for them in paradise. Comfortable illusions.    Those Christians who bash atheists do so because they are trained to do so. They are trained to attack anything that is a threat to their indoctrinating institution. All we atheists/non-religious people want is for you to snap out of this and think for yourselves. We are trying to tell you that religion is a hoax that you have been sucked into by one means or another. Those of us who speak out against religion only want you to think freely as we do, and see the truth of things from the perspective of an independent observer of life. Independent of any forces that aim to pacify your questioning mind.     Life is a mystery. We atheists accept this. Christians and other religious people prefer to fill that void of mystery with stories. Pretty lies about heaven and God and angels and other lovely things that simply are not real. We just want you to join us in reality.    I attack religion because it is an imprisoner of the mind.

There seems to be approximately as many different ways to be a Christian as there are Christians.  You are not absolved of the responsibility for making moral and ethical decisions yourself.

I never wanted them to worship me or even love me. I gave them life (particularly the kittens) because I loved them. Why would a spirit as good as God be any different.

This is one of the biggest misconceptions! You don't have to be obsessed with a certain religion to have trust and faith in God. God has nothing to do with Christianity or any other form of religion.    I don't know why so many people feel that you are some narrow minded idiot if you trust and believe.    I do not go to any church, I do not read the bible-I get angry because people use religion-especially Christianity- as a scape goat and excuse to judge others. Why do that?    I know that most people that claim God is not real, and claim that they never had a close relationship and trust with him is because they hate their own lives.They could never get anything to work in their life so they blame God over it.    You have GOT TO UNDERSTAND The true issue-it is not about religion,the bible, history or other issues. God, Allah-it's ALL THE SAME!    Good things and bad things happen and you can NOT blame God if bad things happen. He is not here to make our lives comfortable, but he is here to see how we react and deal with each situation. Are we patient and understanding or are we always angry and negative?    How do you think people's goals and dreams happen?

How can you not believe in something you believe. In true essence it is not that they don't believe in God they just have no faith in Him, as do most people even those who say they believe in God.    It is a known fact that when a person who considers themselves to be an "Atheist" comes into a life stressing situation they call on God, that one they say they don't believe in. You can't call on Him who you don't believe. That would be like looking for gold that you never knew existed.|`|hngBe87naa	Its illogical to believe in a Higher power. This belief is comparable to thinking that an earthquake is the wrath of god but we know its tectonic plates rubbing together.

We don't know many things but isn't it logical to think that you can believe in anything you want doesn't make it true.

Keep in mind that the people who worshiped Zeus, the ancient Greeks, cited as proof of Zeus's existence stories written down in books which they said were divinely inspired (much like the Christian Bible or the Islamic Koran). This is the same kind of "proof" that people provide for Jesus's existence or Allah's.    So what you have is the word of one piece of mythology versus the word of another.    I daresay the only reason you believe in Jesus and not Zeus is because of the century and the country in which you were born!|`|0H8AEvJkaa	I first started doubting the existence of a deity when from reading the bible I saw how evil the character of god really is.

PvgZUzHjaa	I think the two answers you propose are probably both true, although they may not be all the reasons.  I think a genuine desire to communicate is also involved.  And wanting to tell others about your point of view on the subject is not necessarily the same as any of them.  You may want to learn other people's reactions to what you believe, or you may want to have what you believe confirmed by others, but you really may just want to tell others what you believe.  Maybe to convert them, maybe to inform them, or maybe to have people who agree with you as contacts.

When the soul is born it is born in love but it does not know the object of its love, that is God. And it seeks God in all things, in all creation hoping it will find Him. The soul then tries to embrace all things, to posses all things, to satisfy itself with all things, to quenxh its thirst (this is most evident in babies how they try to touch everything and grasp everything; later it is evident in how humans seek love, they seek to find someone who will satisfy their inner thirst for God). However this thirst cannot be quenched with the things of this earth because the soul was not made for this Earth. And the things of this earth give it pleasure because they are God's creation (an image of God) but at the same time leave it with a certain melancholy because they are ONLY His creation and nothing more; they are not God. What the soul seeks is an infinite, transcending love, a sort of living water. And it can never be satisfied until it finds it. That is why most people return to religion and spirituality, they realize how temporary, fleeting the things of this present Earth are, and they seek something more.|`|9S6xT3Onaa	For me it was taking up too much of my time that is why I left.

My basic thing was to use the pagan gods and goddesses as myth and metaphor.  I had read Tarot for some 35 years, and recognized the value of such archetypical symbols.    I soon realized that it was not really honest to call myself a witch, particularly since Steve committed suicide and I no longer performed rituals.  So I realized that what I was was an atheist.

I think I have been astonished by the Christians who are on here, and their vitriol.  Even though I grew up in the Bible Belt, most of the Christians I knew were pretty moderate.  So many of the very young Christians here are just plain scary in their anger and their single-mindedness and simple-mindedness.  They make me gladder all the time that I converted to Judaism, and I think they drive me further away from Christianity every day that I'm here, and with every foul thing that they spew.  Many are simply reprehensible.  In particular, I've been absolutely stonkered by their PRIDE in a lack of education; the whole notion of being proud of ignorance is incomprehensible to me.    I've thoroughly enjoyed the wit of many of the atheists here, as well as the wisdom of many who consider themselves to be pagan.

But not just my understanding has changed, I have changed & it really was not what I was expecting when I came here. I have developed some relationships that have become very important to me, & have found many who I honor & respect. To those that are my friends & mentors here, I wonder if you realize the impact you have had upon my life & Being, & just how grateful I am to each of you.  What am I ? My roots are Christian Mysticism, I was taught an oral tradition that was given to my Mentor/Teacher in the same fashion, but today I feel I am just Mystic. It has always been amazing to me since coming here how the Mystics of all belief systems can use different words yet speak the same language. I have had many from different systems befriend me, including Wiccan & Pagan. Each has added to me! You have all left me far better than you found me.

6FdNYjl5aa	I hear you say you are a Christian, then you should know that this is one of those faith walks, one of those ask and believe, one of those make your request known to God and wait for the manifestation. If you truly love her then you should be willing to pray, and wait and in the meantime build a relationship through communication and sharing.     The question is are your motives pure? If so then you can give this to God and let time and persistence change her heart. This could be the witness for the mormon faith that the love of Christ can withstand and prevail over all.    So the question is How deep is your love? And do you truly have the love of christ  1 Cor 13: 4-8.|`|c25b976df76790483eae7d219034707caa	You are very rude and disrespectful in my opinion.    I was offended by just reading your rant. You respect her but disrespect all that she believes. No wonder...I would venture to guess that she wants nothing to do with you.    If you disrespect our religion why do you ask for our opinion?|`|GQyAf4Umaa	This is very simple. Scripture is more important than feelings. Can two walk together except they agree? You better be wise. Do not entangle yourself in trouble. Avoid her.|`|WyICbuPqaa	She deserves to marry someone with roughly as much faith as she has.    You say you love her, but charity seeketh not its own.|`|ZtEVlc0yaa	Could it be that she truly believes that a temple marriage is the only way that marriage can endure on into the eternities?   If she believes that, I think it's fairly easy to see why that would be something she'd strive for.     It's a tough situation.   One that I do not envy. :/    Hopefully everything works out.    Okay. I'm thinking you don't understand how Mormons view marriage. (And the blessings that we believe come from a temple marriage.)    "Do not add..."   Practically the same message is found in Deuteronomy 4:2. Does this mean that everything that came after Deuteronomy is invalid? No. Why? Because God can "add" (I prefer to say reveal.) to his word at anytime he sees fit. At least that's my belief.     Let's try to keep the hostility to a minimum? :]    So you know that when the Book of Revelation was written, there was no such thing as the New Testament. And it wasn't even the last book written. (John wrote it before the Gospel of John, as well as his epistles.) Yet I'm sure you believe the Gospel of John to be the Word of God. Eh. Why? Because that verse was speaking specifically about a single book. (That is the Book of Revelation.)      "And believe me, I know what you mean when you say the "blessings from temple marriage." I know more than you probably think I know."     1 Corinthians 2:14  But the natural man receiveth not the things of the Spirit of God: for they are foolishness unto him: neither can he know them, because they are spiritually discerned.|`|TzY9vkinaa	Sounds like it's not going to work out between you two.

Can you respect someone if you think their beliefs are ridiculous?    You are in highschool.  Chances are, you'll be in love with someone else in a few weeks.  She won't date you right now.  She says she won't date you later. That's her choice.  You move on.  That's all you can do.    And you can be Christian and "smash" someone's heart.  You don't have to be in love with someone just because they're in love with you. Maybe she's trying to let you down easy.|`|dl97DmmYaa	find another girl|`|7d16b3b33c15681f9d53425cac12ac67aa	The problem is she takes her religion and faith seriously and the commitments to it seriously as well.     Although it does happen that Mormons and Non-Mormons do fall in love and do get married, it is hard because it is a decision that we feel will effect our lives. Those being the factors of having Eternal Marriage and having children sealed to us for Time and All Eternity. I realize that you probably do not believe in this doctrine but she obviously does and the thought of missing out on those things is hard for her to ignore.     There is no easy answer to your question other than stating the blatantly obvious that it probably won't work out between you two as she is determined to stay in her faith and you admitted to her that you will probably never join. So from that you are going in two different directions. Either you will have to give her some leeway, in otherwords make an attempt to understand her faith more so you can say you are trying to so you can date her or just give it up.     Either way there are no easy answers for it.|`|hQDapmICaa	Brother, PLEASE change your heart. Even if you manage to change her decision today, one day she will leave you for her belief.    And if you decide to be a mormon now, you too later will regret your decision.    Never compromise your belif. Don't force her to change. You can't force someone to love you.    I respect the girl's power of will even though she is on the wrong side. What you can do is pray and wait.    One last word, be worthy of Christ:    Mat 10:37  He that loveth father or mother more than me is not worthy of me: and he that loveth son or daughter more than me is not worthy of me.      Peace!

Why are you placing YOUR reservations on her.  I don't know, I think you are leaving out something. The information you provided is lacking and a bit one sided.  _______  You seem to be mentioning a lot about her religion. I think you don't like the fact that she is a Mormon. Her religion is the issue not her.  If you want to date her why don't you find out more from her what she likes and doesn't like?

Yes, you can completely love someone who would be the wrong relationship.  Don't fall for the sappy love-song riddled notion that all you need is love.  You also need common goals.  And guess what?  You two want different things out of life.    Let her go.  You're only hurting her worse by holding on to her.  That's really a selfish thing to do.|`|BMQlzUkfaa	These are your words:    I'd go through Hell and back for this girl. I'm not saying I'd convert, because I'm not going to. I've looked enough into the religion to know that I can't believe the messages. Yes, it does have good morales, but I'm not changing who I am for anyone.     You would go to hell for her but not to heaven?  Instead of trying to fight her, if you really love her then join her.  It really is the only way for you both to be happy together.      Don't fault her for being wiser than you are.  Love of course is important, but you need to also use your head.  Would it be fair to your future children if you were to marry to have a father who would not go to church with them?  Would she be happy if she could not raise her children in the faith that she loves and believes in?  Would you be willing to not go to your children's  weddings because they want to be married in the temple for all eternity?      If you truly love this girl wouldn't you want  what would make her truly happy?  She wants to be married in the temple to someone that she loves forever.  Would you take that away from her?    You can study and read about the church until you are blue in the face but it finally comes down to you getting on your knees with a humble and sincere heart and praying about it.  Any other effort is just a meager attempt at finding out the truth.      Don't join for her sake though, you must learn that it is the Church of Jesus Christ all on your own or you are just being dishonest.  If you are not willing to do this then do the right thing and let her go.    I know that these are tough words, but they are true ones.|`|rjIenv1Baa	Well if she cant except you the same way you except her then ditch her im retty sure you can find someone better!..|`|kKSq5VFKaa	Bu By

Maybe you could have discussed with your visitors the origins of the crusades as a response to Muslim invasions of North Africa, the Middle East and much of Europe.      You should also have expressed how confused you are about how Jesus would view feeding and sheltering the hungry and homeless.  Maybe you could have engaged your visitors in a discussion of how and why Jesus would be repulsed by Mother Theresa, a profoundly devout Roman Catholic.    Good luck with your next visitors.

If they ask "Are you saved?"   I often say "Yes" and close the door.    If I have the time...

They usually go away.    Sometimes if I just don't want to talk to them I will say:    "Muta assif anna ma a'arof al-englise"  which is:  "I'm sorry but I don't speak English"  (in Arabic)     Since they don't know what language it is, they can't send a representative who knows the language.    .|`|ZtEVlc0yaa	I took their literature.

Are you serious?"|`|gBoUrlrKaa	I wouldn't care.|`|UITfm0fjaa	I would invite them in for a discussion, see how much they read their own material! I would try to understand their points and how they came to such a conclusion.|`|bbb941465ccc4a1ec3a57d5ff0a4b17baa	I would be very, very surprised.  Then I would ask them why they're going door to door.|`|cFaCmYrXaa	Even though I am one, I would think that it was really ignorant.  Atheism is something a person needs to come to realize on their own.|`|91XGHfSaaa	I'd tell them I wasn't interested, the same as I would tell a religious "missionary".    I'm an atheist.

To those groups, I would politely say I wasn't interested in a pamphlet telling me I should believe in a far fetched idea with no proof whatsoever beyond them *really* wanting me to believe.    To atheists, I would simply say they were wasting my time, giving me a pamphlet telling me how far fetched those ideas are and how there is no proof beyond the holders' *really* wanting me to believe.    Seriously, though, I have never seen an atheist group handing out such pamphlets, except in either ironic humor or protest.|`|AA11923447	Generally, I do not permit proselytizing on my property. I am a Christian, and do not believe in forcing my faith upon others, so I don't appreciate it when others try to force their beliefs on me. However, the twist of being visited by atheists is unique enough that I might actually talk with them. As it happens, I do have a lot of atheist pamphlets. I have atheist friends who have tracts and leaflets that they give out at meetings (not door-to-door). I held onto some of those pamphlets, and have referred to them several times for research purposes.

GOd is spiritual and the comprehension of HIM is likewise. The understanding of the spi rit and natural or what we do on this earth vs. What god does, is completely different!     Earn the respect of the child... BS!! i dont have to earn the repsect of a pissy little one that i decided to have and give natural life too! i will love him, and take care of him, and provide for him and for doing all this they need to respect me, b/c there is nothing besides the law of the land and my morals that says i HAVE to do this! please!  i wish i would give my children this power over me!!!My kids will know that i am the provider and everything is up to me,especially since i brought them into this world and fulfills my repsonsibilities towards taking care and providing for them and i will decide what is best for them and sumtimes i will let them have some options. i will do this until they beomce older and can decide for themselves.. which ties me over to GOD! A child does not have the authority or should not have the audacity to demand anything from their parents,likewise ppl should do this for GOD, especially seeming as tho they wouldnt even be here in the first place without HIM . PERIOD!!!!  IDK why some children have rough lives and some dont, and i dont go around trying to look for all the answers to which there are no answers too at least that will satisfy man. All i know is that GOD is always in control depsite what i see and understand in this world whether it is good or bad and i TRUST HIM to let life(despite the events in some ppls life) play out as it should!|`|rfMLIqMpaa	Don't listen to these atheists.

VzCygD6taa	The prophet Malachi wrote -    Malachi 4:5-6 NIrV    5  "I will send you the prophet Elijah. He will come before the day of the LORD arrives. It will be a great and terrifying day.    6  Elijah will teach parents how to love their children. He will also teach children how to honor their parents. If that does not happen, I will come. And I will put a curse on the land."    Jesus said    Matthew 11:12-15 NIV    12  From the days of John the Baptist until now, the kingdom of heaven has been forcefully advancing, and forceful men lay hold of it.    13  For all the Prophets and the Law prophesied until John.    14  And if you are willing to accept it, he is the Elijah who was to come.    15  He who has ears, let him hear.    The implication being that there will be another like unto Elijah before Jesus returns to establish Gods Kingdom on earth.    Who this will be only God, Jesus and may be the angels know.|`|qcEzJDY6aa	This is actually Jesus in the form of Elijah who should restore everything. He will be the coming Son of man that most people won't realized for he will come as thief. this will be His second coming and also play the part of a comforter; read John 14;15;16 chapters he would teach the last message for the last generation, but many would not recognized Him as the last messiah. This will be before the end come for the judgement of the wicked. His purpose is to restore Heaven on earth.|`|dl97DmmYaa	Mat 11:14  And if you are willing to accept it, he is the Elijah who was to come.    Mat 17:11  Jesus replied, "To be sure, Elijah comes and will restore all things.        Elijah or Elias (Hebrew: ?????, Eliyahu) meaning "Yahweh is my God" was a prophet in Israel in the 9th century BCE. He appears in the Hebrew Bible, Talmud, Mishnah, Christian Bible, and the Qur'an. According to the Books of Kings, Elijah raised the dead, brought fire down from the sky, and ascended into heaven by a whirlwind. In the New Testament, both Jesus and John the Baptist are on some occasions thought to be Elijah. He is also one of two Old Testament figures (along with Moses) who appears and converses with Jesus on Mount Tabor during the Transfiguration.    Elijah is invoked weekly at the Havdalah ritual that marks the end of Shabbat, and in other Jewish customs, among them the Passover seder. Based on a prophecy in Malachi, many Jews await his return as precursor to the coming of the Messiah[1]. In Eastern Europe, he is known as "Elijah the Thunderer" and is blamed in folklore for poor weather.
Q6qyfPkRaa	WOW! ok, this is a good one. i will have to save this one, study and come back.. i was under the assumption they were men! i will write u back in the later on to discuss this after i had a chance to look it up!    EDIT: Ok. so i took the liberty to go back and look it up. I have to do more study as i only read zec 5 and 6 chapters and revelations 11. i need more info,but yes, there is an interesting similarity between the two witnesses of joshua's  and zerubbabel's time, (which is what the book of zecariah deals with), and the two witnesses in revelation. The basket is symbolic i zecharah to indicate isreals sin's had accumulated in that day. for that sin, the restraint of GOD needs to be fulfilled so the saved can be permitted to live in the land. this is the symbolism of the lead cover in zecariah, and then evil will be carried back to the seat of idolatry which in the NT is babylon! ... this is very interesting, give me another day or so. i will continue to study! help me out a bif if u see i am going off track, but this is what i have come up with so far....

Also, I can feel love when I look at my child, see love when she hugs her mommy, and all the other senses.  BUT I DON'T SEE, HEAR, FEEL, SMELL TASTE OR TOUCH ANY GODS BECAUSE THEY AREN'T THERE!

EYqTV2EYaa	It depends on how you interpret boredom. In my perspective, ongoing war and poverty isn't fun. In fact, that reason alone creates debating. There are various other things that can be considered fun like shopping, hanging out with friends and family, playing games, and so forth. Also, with peace, we wouldn't have to worry about being attacked, or crying after getting a report of family members being killed in wars.

8QWwFsFIaa	Yes, I believe it is close.  But we must remember that, as the Bible states -     2Pe 3:8 " But forget not this one thing, beloved, that one day is with the Lord as a thousand years, and a thousand years as one day. "    God's concept of time is not the same as ours.      Jesus said that we would not know the exact day or time of His return, even He does not know - only God the Father knows for sure.  But He slso said that we can know the season of His return - the signs of the times.  And so, according to Biblical prophecy, almost everything foretold that must happen before His return, has happened.  So basically He could return any day!|`|a7e4527ac6ed1229d8be6f0ca3adf702aa	Jesus will come again as the King of Kings and Lord of Lords at the time appointed by the Holy Eternal Living Heavenly Father.    Human knowledge in physical science may tell us that the earth changes every 2500 years. Some others may say it is 6000 BC that Adam and Eve lived on the earth as the first human beings and so it may be 6000 AD. It is good for human beings to avoid all types of speculation regarding the time of Jesus coming again but wait for the Holy God Almighty to reveal the truth.    Read the Holy Bible Mark 13:32-33 ... But of that day and that hour knoweth no man, no, not the angels which are in heaven, neither the Son, but the Father. Take ye heed, watch and pray: for ye know not when the time is.    Believers in Christ Jesus should get ready and be prepared to meet Jesus anytime as soon as Jesus appears again as promised in the Holy Bible and the prophets throughout the prophesy given to mankind.

These are not people we want to be in any positions of power...much like they were in the past 8 years in the GOP, or how they are in the Middle East.    Jesus supposedly told his apostles that "there are those present here who will not taste of death 'ere the Kingdom of God arrives."  Unless any of his apostles are still alive, he's more than a little bit late.  2000 years late.

Our family is so close, we're sisters and she stayed with us during the vacation.     On the way, long during the trip, we stopped at Burger King so my little siblings could get a bite to eat and use the bathroom. At the time, I didn't feel I needed to do so, and plus, I was playing music, and basically, enjoying myself with Roxanne. Once the little kids were situated, we continued the trip without any interruptions.     About an hour or two later, my uncle needed to get gas, so he stopped at a 24-hour rest stop gas station. During this time, the little kids didn't have to go obviously, but Roxanne and I were dying to. The womens bathroom was out of order and a huge line was front of the mens room. It was a long line, and thankfully, after it was over, Roxanne and I were the last remaining people. When she came out, it was my turn, and she went back to the van.     Then, while I was still on the toilet, the next thing, I knew, some lady opened the door, fidgeting in need to pee. With a new fair number of people lined up and watching me, I demanded her to close the door. Surprisingly, she had enough nerve to yell at me, saying  "Hurry up." I responded, saying something like, "Well, I will, but you'll have to close the door!" Then, I remembered, most people were laughing at me, while a few were telling her too close the door, and I could remember being REALLY embarrassed. Seriously, I wanted to disappear.    To stop the girl from actually, well, 'protesting' for me me to come out by keeping the door open, the clerk came near the bathroom to get her to move, also getting a good look at me. It was so mortifying, I couldn't look anyone in the eye after coming out, not even the clerk. I could hear some people snickering and making comments. Thankfully, my brain is more mature now because I know if something similar happens again, I wouldn't be embarrassed because strangers aren't a part of my life after I leave their site, so really, it would matter. Sure, they can tell people they know, but I wouldn't know about it, and the people they tell don't know me personally. Well, I'm just glad it isn't on the internet. lol. By the way, the lock was broken, so I couldn't lock the door.    I have many more embarrassing situations and oddly, most of them are bathroom related. lol. I don't know why it happens, but it just does. In November, a lady opened the door on me in a Chinese restaurant that was rather small, and everyone got a good look at me, but nonetheless, she did it by accident. Sometimes, I still wish people would knock.|`|9ekjMzbUaa	being at this church centre for homeless and all these women were like'im so hot and confident'and im like im steve mcqueen here please lay off it.i just didn't get their style|`|ACA8i43Gaa	My fiance and I were going to college. He lived with five other guys, but at any given time there would be one or two random guys that would stay there for the week. In order to see each other I would have to come over in the early morning between our two jobs and classes. It was that, or we couldnt see each other during the week. He started sleeping out on the couch because his roommate that shared a room with him started a graveyard shift and needed his sleep. One morning, before the sun came up, I had just let myself in to his apartment, and saw that his alarm clock was by the couch so that he wouldnt sleep through class. He hadnt been expecting me so I carefully walked through the pitch black apartment trying not to trip over anything. I wanted to surprise him with a wake up kiss, so I knelt down and started to kiss him. It was turning quite passionate when all of the sudden he went completely rigid. I sat up to see what was wrong and it wasnt my fiance at all. It was some random guy who had just happened to stay overnight. I thought I was going to die!

It is the abjed count of 'Bismillah hir rahmanir raheem' (in the name of Allah, the most beneficeint, the most merciful).|`|Ne3XNDRJaa	Its a Miami area code|`|ZYrQXiwBaa	It is the abjad count of the phrase "besmellahe rrahmaane rrahim"    Also:  There have been various speculations about the mystical or religious significance of 786 in Islam for centuries. There is a famous poem praising Allah, titled Bismillah al-Rahman al-Rahim, which has exactly 786 letters. Some have argued that 786 is the number of days in which Allah created the world or the number of days in which Muhammad conquered the pagans of Mecca.    All Arabic copies of the Koran have the mysterious figure 786 imprinted on them . No Arabic scholar has been able to determine the choice of this particular number as divine. It is an established fact that Muhammad was illiterate therefore it is obvious that he would not be able to differentiate numbers from letters.    This "magical" number is none other than the Vedic holy letter "aum" written in Sanskrit (see the figure at the right). Anyone who knows Sanskrit can try reading the symbol for "aum" backwards in the Arabic way and magically the numbers 786 will appear! Muslims in their ignorance simply do not realise that this special number is nothing more than the holiest of Vedic symbols misread|`|6bC1HnyHaa	it's not|`|acf400a33d755981a13756d9aed8a8b6aa	It was discovered by Dr. Khalifa in the early 1970.

YHmr7nvsaa	Yes I do. Studies have shown that the more educated someone is, the less likely they are to believe in fairy tales.|`|ggjSKphZaa	Yes.|`|39AfwRL5aa	Truly religious people see their god in anything and everything. So the answer would be no if you were already a Theist, maybe yes if you were not. It also depends on what you mean by 'science.' There are a lot of fake scientific ideas in the world perpetrated by people who use it for their own agenda. Global warming is an agenda and a pseudo - science and is completely false, and is backed up with false data produced by corrupted 'scientific' organisations. (NASA, for example.)|`|AA10824205	No, Why?    Read this!    Excerpts from Zakir Naik's answers!      the Quran mentions in Surah Anbiya, Ch. 21, V. No. 30, about the Big Bang Theory. Who could have mentioned this in the Quran 1400 years ago? - He will tell you May be it is a fluke. Dont argue with him - Next part of the question. We did not know the light of the Moon is reflected light - We came to know recently - You ask him. He will tell you Yes, yes the light of the Moon is reflected light  it is not its own light. When we discovered ? He will tell you Recently, yesterday, fifty years back, hundred years back, yesterday in science. You tell him, the Quran mentioned that  the light of the moon is reflected light, fourteen hundred years ago. Who could have mentioned that ? May be somebody had a wild guess. Do not argue with him. Continue -     We thought the sun was stationary. You ask him - Is it stationary ? He will say  No it is rotating and revolving. When did you learn this? He will tell you Yesterday fifty years back twenty years back. Quran mentioned this fourteen hundred years ago. He will hesitate, but may say  May be, some intelligent person wrote it. Dont argue with it Continue.     How was the universe initially - What is celestial matter ? He will tell you it was Smoke. How did you come to know ? We have got proof, we have got evidence. You tell him Quran mentioned this fourteen hundred years ago. Who could have mentioned that? - He will hesitate. Dont wait for a response Continue -     Quran told 1400 years ago, that there are 7 layers of atmosphere (General science 1984, page 10 to 20)    that Mountains act as pegs in earth and stabilizes it    Quran told about the Pharaoh of egypt , who was taken out of sea after 3000 years in 1898, after almost 1300 years of the revelation of Holy Quran, as the Quran had predicted    "Today, We will save your body, so that you may become a sign to those who come after you. But verily, many people are heedless of Our signs.   10-Jonah, 90-92   http://theholyislam.blogspot.com/2007/12...    Keep on posing question after question. All that I have given in the lecture - Keep on posing one question after the other. That, water cycle, how did you come to know about it? Quran mentioned it fourteen hundred years ago. About  every living thing made from water - Who could have mentioned that ? Quran speaks about Botany - the male and female - Who could have mentioned that ? Pose one after the other and ask the question  Who could have written that ?    Let us analyse scientifically, whether the human beings can be created by chance. The protein molecule is a very important structure of the living cell -Very important part in the living structure of the cell. The protein molecule consists of five elements - the Carbon, Nitrogen, Oxygen, Hydrogen and Sulphur. And there are tens and thousands of Atoms required to make one Molecule. One Atom has five elements - Carbon, Nitrogen, Oxygen, Hydrogen and Sulphur. There are tens of thousands of Atoms, which make one Protein Molecule - And there are approximately 92 free elements. The chances that out of these 92, the five will form an Atom and these atoms will form tens and thousands of Atom, to form one Protein Molecule was calculated by Frank Alien . And he said the chances are 1/10 raised to 160. You know what is the meaning of 1/10 raised to 160? If I say 1/10 raised to two, ten raise to two means, one zero zero zero. One in hundred - Chance is one percent. If I say 1/10 raised to three, it means one in a thousand  That is 1 percent.    anything 1/10 raised to fifty, is counted as zero. Further more, this is talking about one molecule. And the substance required to form this one molecule of protein was calculated by another person Charles Guy - that it will require millions of times of substance as huge as our Galaxy. Millions of galaxies will be required to form this one molecule of protein. And the time was calculated by Charles Guy - the time taken for one protein molecule to be formed, will be ten raised to 263 years. You know what is that? One zero zero zero zero zero zero, 263 zeros, it will take to form one protein molecule.    Science tells us There has to be Someone , some Supernatural force. Therefore science as I said earlier, is not eliminating God - It is eliminating models of god.

Geoff: What is his Ph.D. in?|`|g0lKlQGnaa	I find the opposite is true    And there are many areas where science is incapable of finding any truth or meaning, i.e subjective experience, imagination, abstract emotions.  Knowing that chemical balances correspond to emotions gives no true meaning, it can only help in treatment    I have the greatest appreciation for science, but I am not so arrogant that I don't recognize its limitations.  As complex as our technology is today, we cannot even explain relatively simple things such as how a tiny glass will break on the floor and be able to accurately predict the result, nor can we even solve a simple game like chess, in fact we are many many years from that, but it is in the forseeable future    From what I see in this forum, most atheists seem to cherrypick little bits and pieces that they think bolsters the atheist movement such as little evolutionary sound bites|`|4rWPX8CTaa	As a general rule of thumb, yeah. But it's like fat women; not all of them are fat, some are pregnant.|`|rvmiK8rgaa	No.  Partly because the phrase 'a proper understanding of science' is question begging.

Unless you haven't been going out for long and it's really super flesh showing and tight, he's going to feel great having you with him. The difference between "slutty" and sweet is that "slutty" shows more flesh. You can be very sexy by wearing outfits that show and flatter your feminine curves and figure.

So, it is possible to be an agnostic theist (one who believes a god exists, but that they can never truly know this being) or a gnostic theist (one who believes that they can come to know whatever god they happen to believe in).  A similar thing applies to atheists.    The word has come to mean the same thing as a 'weak atheism,' recently, that is, the idea that there could be a god or gods out there, but the person is not sure, and so lives as if they didn't exist.|`|eO2rnf7yaa	Strictly used, it means that a person believes it is impossible to know whether God exists.

And even when they don't, it seems like other religions take it as such. I just don't understand it. Why can't we have an intelligen conversation? For example, here I will ask what religion you are. What religion are you? And then after that instead of telling you you're wrong, I'll simply say, "Oh, I'm a Christian. Wanna talk about stuff?" See, very simple.     I think maybe the reason people can't do this is because they can't accept others believing something different. Atheists seem bitter that those who have religion have it, and those with religion hate Atheists for not having what they have, and if two people have religion, they have to fight about how they have it.

I'm a fan of Shakespeare, and I remember this quotation from one of his plays: "Love all; trust a few. Do wrong to none." What do you think of this sentiment?    I've come across enough people to know that incivility isn't the accepted norm, if that's any consolation.
xxEhpytpaa	Then you might as well go live in a cave with no electricity, no TV, no internet, and don't ever take your children shopping. This would be a disaster for you. As for the school systems, well they have tried to conveniently to take God out of the school systems, and I think they, they have not quite got there yet. So you better home-school your children. That about covers it. May God bless you, you need them.    BTW: What will you say to Jesus when you see Him? just wondering!  Also what are you doing on R&S if you don't want your children exposed to religion? Why are you exposing yourself?  Isn't this a contridiction you asking religious people this question?|`|UutLVO2Laa	I told them that I didn't think God existed - but that they should decide for themselves when they're older.

The great majority stay atheist/agnostic.    "how do i tell young kids that already have been exposed to religion an its basic story that god is jibberish"  God didn't create humans, humans created god.    Just remember, if you try to force them into any belief system, whether that be without a belief, or with one, you're being no better than the religious plague destroying our potential.

A little agitated I sense. Unfortunately what you asking for is the impossible. It's like being 100% secure in the world.... It will never happen. Even an atheist should be informed about religion though. To make an educated decision about religion is better than making an uneducated decision about religion. Your son will question however why are we alive and how did we come to be for what reason? At that point what will you say? An evolution theory which is lacking profusely in multiple aspects, or an atheistic aspect (A belief in not-believing?) or a scriptural reference that explains what is taught through the bible? Additionally, if you believe "G"od is jibberish you have never had faith.(Not trying to offend, please try to understand this.)|`|diAqosiIaa	thats the thing.....people think you can shelter kids but you cant!!! they will learn or find things out on there own. the only thing you can do is talk to them about the things they learn and be truthful. dont be scared to tell them the truth. as long as they are mature and they can handle it. but you cant protect your kids from everything. if you try to and when they find something out they will not be ready for it|`|AGmZNf7zaa	we are not all good people willing to help, there are so many selfish people out there... or are you talking about your family, if so then forget what I said.

I am an atheist, and I treat Christmas and Easter as traditions. I think it's important that children know why we do these things. It's part of our culture.  I also think that childre should be exposed to as many religions as possible as then they can make an open minded decision as to what they believe rather than make uninformed decisions.

Would you accept the above argument. ?  If I tell you Who Created God, then you would say Who created the one who created God and it would go on and on.  We know God is real, since we are real. If you deny God, then you have to deny your own existence, which is impossible. No matter how knowledgeable or intelligent you are, you cannot deny that there has to be a supernatural force that has created our planet and our body and, that creator is God.

Wn0nwNFjaa	I'm with Canute on this one. It has recently been proven that an E grade in a 1970s A level is equal to an A in today's version. The kids are half educated and now they are being taught the work ethic "skive at every given opportunity" by the very people paid to set them up for a working life.   The reason they get more homework these days is because the schools invest far too much time in the brainwashing campaigns set up the the PC brigade of Nu-Labour.   In the 1970s and 1980s we only studies academic subjects, plus art. Today there are PSHE lessons Citizenship, Sex Education, Politics and a host of other crap. Remove the BS, go back to teaching the important academic subjects and the homework will drastically reduce.     Kids are miserable in this country because the Health and Safety laws and fear of litigation prevents them from having a proper childhood and idle parents content to sit in front of the TV rather than taking them on day trips at the weekends.     Parents, I assure you, would far prefer to be with their children most of the time, but the pressures of work make that impossible. We have to work to provide all the crap you swines demand these days.|`|YvvnTrxDaa	Children need stability.  This should include every part of their lives.

But then again it is a big ask for parents to take days off for snow when they also have to take days off for their children's illnesses and the various other problems that life throws at you. My initial thought that it could be easily solved by communities working with each other but that would involve people being friendly and that doesn't seem to be the way forward when it is much easier to just get angry and shout at people.

Ok, we know we don't create each other and we don't come to this world from nowhere because when we die we must be going somewhere as well, hence there must be God, if there were many Gods, they would have fought over what to be created and what not to be, probably over who to die and who to live at the same time... so it's gotta be one God... if that God created us then there must be a reason... could we figure it out on our own? God made it easy and sent us messengers and prophets to show us the way and tell us why... so all the messengers and all the religions are from the same only God, so they've got to be complementary to each other, not opposing each other!!! then God must have said His final words in the last message, what is the last message? and how do we know it's the last one? I guess that would be the religion that believes in all messengers and all books equally... is there such religion? actually yes, Islam does :)  A True Muslim (man or woman) gets his reward for obeying Allah's orders (Allah means The God in Arabic) by going to heaven, where he/she are indulged forever in all the good things that were on earth and more, things no one ever dreamt of or heard about. The Holy Quran tells Muslims (men and women) there will be good food, good wine and sex in heaven for all, but not in the bestial way you may think of, but rather in a way that is satisfactory for everyone and better than what was on earth. Heaven is no heartbreak or injustice land.  True Muslims are no terrorists, and Islam never calls for that, Islam means peace, it bans violence unless you were fought so you fight back, it only doesn't require Muslims to be cowards, and true Muslims understand this very well and never attack civilians.   Islam is the only religion that accepts freedom of religion and asks men to treat women gently like queens.   It's all in the Holy Quran and the right teachings of prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him).  If some people behave otherwise, then it's because people behaviour doesn't necessarily reflect the rulings of their religion always, for example, we can't (and don't) judge Christianity by Hitler or Madonna.  And that is another reason why there is heaven and hell after we die, heaven for the obedient and hell for the disobedient and/or oppressor, it's all going to be decided on the day of resurrection and judgement.  To be a Muslim, you must believe God is only one with no spouses or offspring, believe in his angels (servants not males or females), believe in all his religions, messangers and books equally, the day of judgement, heaven and hell and that everything is in God's hands and because of his will (good or bad).  Muslims believe God is the only divine who never dies, the creator who deserves to be worshiped, all prophets who came to earth are human messangers sent by him.  Muslims don't deny christianity, judaism, Jesus or Moses. They believe in them as the noble prophets and messangers of God, love and respect them so much.  We believe the birth of Jesus (messanger of God) was a miracle from God to us, being born by a mother only and with no father. God is the creator, he can do anything.  We believe Jesus (peace be upon him) is NOT dead till today; he wasnt even murdered or crucified as most people think. God (most glorified) made the man who betrayed Jesus be killed instead by switching their looks for a moment. Jesus was left up to live in heaven until the end of days when he will come back to earth again, with no new teachings or messages but just to make justice prevail instead of oppression, fight the imposter who will claim to be God and (most important) to perform his last prayer with the Muslims announcing he's too a follower of the last prophet (Muhammad) as all people should... then he really dies like other Prophets and be buried (peace be upon them all). So we're waiting for you Jesus, Messenger of God, to bring the world peace and pray with us. Thats what prophet Muhammad told us and this is what I believe in, Im a Muslim  so how do we know it's true? what is said in the last message and what should we do? read the following, and you'll figure out for yourself:|`|KOecCLjLaa	firmament... or the imagination|`|zN1TyLMPaa	i read in one book (journey to other planets) that god world exists about 40,000 light years from here in an other dimension!!!!!!!!!!!|`|01dd345ea6b0e59bc9a20c0606341eefaa	In our hearts and mind.

But who is main Creator ? Who created Adam ? Question is there ? Who created Siva - Question is there ? If Adam or Siva is GOD then opposite sex is taken as Goddess and both jointly producing i.e. called son or daughter etc. But what I have seen, there is a powerful light which is entirely covering this world and under that light we all are. This light is proving that it reflects on any object of the world. As we assumed some one as God or Goddess (may be Idol) with our full faith, devotion, purified mind, wholehearted crying, that light being satisfied, is reflecting there and appearing to be so many GODs/Goddesses. There is nothing wrong. From one we see so many. I have seen  this light to connect any bird/animal/man/woman and even on wall to reflect and showing me that light is only one acting through out the world. It can create rain, cloud, within twinkle of an eye. You see - I am such a person who has become so powerful with the blessings of the lord, the Almighty that you cannot imagine. Will you believe that God so called Almighty has been giving justice to each and every player through out the world centering me ? Each game's result is with the movement of mine and whoever coming to me that is helping to change each game's result also. I say this not to gain name or fame or to be worshipped but to let the people know the truth. Suppose two guys (foreigners) are playing in certain part of the world - how the result will take place centering me who is living in Kolkata (India) ? You may be astonished or may call me a fool/or anything else. But, unltil and unless you see yourself, it is very difficult to believe or to make you believed. Is it not ? You can request Govt. of India to bring me into public and see, whatever I have said whether it is true or false. In conclusion I say there is one powerful light under which we all are and that light is reflecting everywhere whom we trust, believe, keep faith - one from so many. One thing I am asking you to take as trial - suppose you are sitting alone or in the midst of a group, before any person coming to you - whether any of you is having any of the symptom or not - such as drowsiness, headache, pain, displacement, feeling for toilet etc. etc. Or before any mishap happening to your family-member, anybody is getting sick, sustaining injury, black-out (loadshedding) etc. etc. or not.

I will beg to differ here, and, interpet it literally.Judge for your self-Genesis 1:26:    New American Standard Bible (?1995)  Then God said, "Let Us make man in Our image, according to Our likeness; and let them rule over the fish of the sea and over the birds of the sky and over the cattle and over all the earth, and over every creeping thing that creeps on the earth."

Young's Literal Translation  And God saith, 'Let Us make man in Our image, according to Our likeness, and let them rule over fish of the sea, and over fowl of the heavens, and over cattle, and over all the earth, and over every creeping thing that is creeping on the earth.'      Geneva Study Bible  And God said, {s} Let us make man in our {t} image, after our likeness: and let them have dominion over the fish of the sea, and over the fowl of the air, and over the cattle, and over all the earth, and over every creeping thing that creepeth upon the earth.    (s) God commanded the water and the earth to bring forth other creatures: but of man he says, Let us make... signifying that God takes counsel with his wisdom and virtue purposing to make an excellent work above all the rest of his creation.    Incidentally, many experts now believe much of the Gospel Bible was borrowed from the Arab Ancient Egyptian allegories because of the remarkable similiarities-only the names have been changed.    EDIT: Thumbs down-that just doesn't change the TRUTH-you probably don't believe in GIANTS either, but, they to, are mentioned in the Bible-Genesis 6:4-"The Nephilim  were on the earth in those days, and also afterward, when the sons of God came in to the daughters of man and they bore children to them. These were the mighty men who were of old, the men of renown.WERE THESE "sons of God", SONS OF THE TRIUNE-NOT LIKELY? Remember, Goliath was between 6'7" and 9'0" tall depending on interpetation, yet, he was not called a giant, so how tall were these "GIANTS". As Freud once said,  "Sometimes, a cigar is just a cigar."

EYqTV2EYaa	My worse fight happened when I was in high school. It wasn't long ago, but I was in 11th grade, and I'd never forget that day. After school, I was having a debate with some girl in the back because were just getting out of class. We had a class in a back building, so we could take a shortcut to the front to either walk home or go to our rides. Honestly, I can't recall what we were arguing about, but I remember, the girl was a lesbian. Her girlfriend however, was a really tall, powerful butch lesbian and she didn't like the idea of me being 'disrespectful' to her girlfriend. Actually, I wasn't even. I wasn't yelling because my voice is too light and I wasn't disrespectful at all. It was HER doing so. Well, her girlfriend still attacked me. She responded by hitting me with full force in the face, and it almost knocked me out. Then, she was just hitting and boxing me like a man or something. Afterwards, she ended up slamming my head against a poll and the ground a couple of times. Well, after the fight, I remember crying apparently, and I was bleeding a little bit from being scraped on the ground, but I had nothing broken. Let's just say, it was the worst fight I ever been in. I don't fight often, but of the few fight I've been in with the typical girl, they never actually hurt, or even used fists if you know what I mean.|`|pJaFd14Raa	Between the good and bad forces|`|0mXQODsIaa	well i didnt get hurt other than a pucnh to the face. this guy called my mum a fat whore, so i grabbed his throat, and i wouldnt stop hitting him in the face. he was pretty messed up by the end.|`|Nf0FLjGhaa	it all started when the IED (improvised explosive devise) detonated. i caught some shrapnel. moments later, i was also shot at. i returned fire, killing 2, but at the end, i took a round through my neck. happily, there was a little time between the blast and the firefight, so medics were already there to save me. and i survived while the 2 i shot at didn't, so i'd say i won. we also won as a group, but it wasn't hard. in fact, due to my position, i was one of only 2 marines shot. i ended up losing my right kidney (could've been saved, but i stayed to help those more seriously wounded), i have slightly diminished use of my left hand, and a bit of pain in my now mostly artificial right knee, but all in all, it could've been much worse
d8zxbKduaa	Nasty habits are generally HARD to quit. But I did learn once that it takes 21 days to break one or develop one so if you can "quit" for 21 days (in a row) you may be successful.|`|KHC2oE8iaa	why don't you tell me what your trying to quit doing miss?|`|R0M1WCmZaa	Nasty? Umm, I don't have one but I need to stop doing with crack with my hands with bones because it's hurt so much..I am trying quit it because every body said it's hurt and will caught a more problem & I was like I don't want do it and it's not worth it...So I am finally do less now....|`|1bkiNiwzaa	Depends on what the nasty habit is.  If its an addiction like smoking you may want to join a group or something.  Find a distraction.    If its something concerning morals, talk to someone who is a good human being and who knows you well and who can help you out.    Difficult to say without more details.
BuSicwDqaa	DEFINITELY.    You should make your own interpretations of the bible, not a biased preacher's interpretation.|`|fL3SiRDWaa	It's all really about reading and underatanding Gods word.  So whatever method works for you.    I personally get more out of it when I sit down alone every day and read to myself, because I can go at my own pace.  And especially with the bible, it can be complicated because of the way it is written.      I also hold a bible study, and we discuss it together, and that helps too, because it is easy to think it is contradicting itself when really there is a lot of information to gather.    I don't think there is a BETTER way, if you are really committing yourself to the Lord.    Good luck, and God Bless,  Jolie|`|AA11992885	better to be on your own    the text first gives the ONLY authority to interpret to the Levites and judges of Israel, and that which has already been given away can not be given to someone else    someone might claim, "well, they were interpreting it wrong"......well, God should have thought about that before HE gave them the authority, after all, HE is supposedly all knowing........HE didn't give a time limit to their authority, HE simply said that according to their laws    Deuteronomy 17:8 If there arise a matter too hard for thee in judgment........  this verse in its entirety gets confused  if a matter is too hard for you.........don't think of yourself as the intelligent person you are, consider for a moment, that you are mentally inept, as there ARE those who are, and they will HAVE to go to the authorities to determine what is right and what is wrong    and the end result    Exodus 12:49 One law shall be to him that is homeborn, and unto the stranger that sojourneth among you  Leviticus 7:7 As the sin offering is, so is the trespass offering: there is one law for them: the priest that maketh atonement therewith shall have it  Numbers 15:16 One law and one manner shall be for you, and for the stranger that sojourneth with you  Numbers 15:29 Ye shall have one law for him that sinneth through ignorance, both for him that is born among the children of Israel, and for the stranger that sojourneth among them    so, whatever the authorities come up with for the mentally inept, so shall you HAVE to abide therein    now, it brings it into more of an understanding    Deuteronomy 17:8 If there arise a matter too hard for thee in judgment, between blood and blood, between plea and plea, and between stroke and stroke, being matters of controversy within thy gates: then shalt thou arise, and get thee up into the place which the LORD thy God shall choose;    two brothers are arguing over whether something is kosher or not, an animal that has a scar, a blemish, despite the fact that it is of the kosher species, it has a blemish, one brother says it is still kosher, the other doesn't.....but the transaction was already done BEFORE the other brother FOUND the blemish, and thus, they are arguing    the one brother doesn't want to give the money back, but the other brother is demanding that he be compensated for being sold an animal that he can NOT use for the intended purpose due to the blemish    EVERY matter in the Torah HAS to be legalized  God commanded it...........and being all knowing, HE already KNEW, BEFORE all these laws came about, HE KNEW the laws they would come up with, and still said................Deuteornomy 17:12: And the man that will do presumptuously, and will not hearken unto the priest that standeth to minister there before the LORD thy God, or unto the judge, even that man shall die: and thou shalt put away the evil from Israel.    christian authorities have NO authority, you are better off reading it for yourself and judging for yourself then handing authority over to them whom God never gave authority to|`|4rWPX8CTaa	Instead of better, you should say less harmful, because there's nothing good about reading the bible.|`|ZYrQXiwBaa	You should read it for yourself, if you have determination and promise yourself not to quite after 300 pages...|`|1a42bf28fe11e609b0c68795bce43d6baa	Both are just as important.

The words put in the mouth of Pastors are meant for EACH person listening.|`|4boTYkt7aa	Jesus came and gave His life for the Church.And it is good to read the Bible yourself because you need to know if the preacher is teaching truth or not,but it is important to teach because that's what Jesus told us all to do.When you attend service,don't worry about why the other people are there,just know why you are.I had the same problem before,I used to go home thinking that the people in the church were supposed to act better than people who were not in church.But then I realized that those people aren't perfect,nor am I.And yes there are people who go to service and are far from being a Christians,but don't let satan win by putting some of his people in the church.Don't think that the devil stops at the door of the church building,he does some of his best work there.He wants to keep you from going and hearing the Gospel.I started looking for the people who were Christians and formed friendships with them.May peace be with you,my friend.|`|HlFzl1piaa	Can be dangerous, but it worked out for me.|`|SwtaUd56aa	I think it is better to read the Bible on one's own given one has the right tools and frame of mind to safely and effectively do so.|`|DNQxUcptaa	I would say read it yourself first, that way you have an unbiased understanding of what is written, then you can discuss any issues or questions you have with someone like a preacher, but be careful because their answers will be biased towards their own understanding of the writings and that of their religious leaders.|`|3xkM90eFaa	I think if you are a well-educated person,then read it on your own.otherwise you need to go to church not just for listening the preacher's interpretation of the Bible but also for communication with other believers and showing your love for the Lord and its people.|`|Q6qyfPkRaa	it depends on your level of spiritual growth and comprehension. For babes in christ.. they need to be spoon fed and fed with milk until they grow and wax strong in the faith and word.. however for some, they ned to be fed with meat. These beleivers are the one that have greater faith and understanding of the word and these can b trusted to read the bible ontheir own! the bible says that believers should go to church and study ontheir own.. You know satan has gotten pretty craft, and even he preaches in pulpits around the world! That is why we just cant take other ppl's word for it! One must know what the word says for themsleves, so they wont be misled! Besides, the book says "Study to show thyself approved unto GOd, A workman that needeth not to be ashamed, but can rightly divide the word of truth!"    Church going is necessary dependant upon the person. The bible says don't forsake the asembling of the righteous. I go when i feel like i need to hear a good song, sermon, or be ecouraged, but for the most part i study at home, b/c i am not a babe in christ, and GOd himself gives me the revelation of the word as i study at home!|`|nt7Il1eXaa	I think reading the Bible with the guidance of the Holy Spirit is the best! But sometimes we aren't in a position to listen to God. In those times, we need to hear someone preaching God's word.    Well, if you're really strong in God's word and cannot be moved by any storm, then church is not necessary. But most of us aren't that way. We fall down, and sometimes God uses people to pick us up. So that's why we need to go.|`|Xt4n9h40aa	We are supposed to read our Bible daily and go to Church.  The Word of God is what builds us up spiritually.  Going to church gives us solid Christian support.  We are to help build one another up.  Besides if you do not read, study, and pray to God everyday, on your own, how do expect to have a solid relationship with God?  If you didn't talk to a spouse of spend anytime with them or learned anything about them...how long do you think they would remain a spouse?              "And let us consider and give attentive, continuous care to watching over one another, studying how we may stir up (stimulate and incite) to love and helpful deeds and noble activities, Not forsaking or neglecting to assemble together [as believers], as is the habit of some people, but admonishing (warning, urging, and encouraging) one another, adn all the more faithfully as you see the day approaching." (Hebrews 10:24-25, the Amplified Bible)      Also, when you read and study on your own then if you ever have an inncedent where someone is preaching falsely, then you will know it in you spirit becasue you have studied in God's Word.  I've been going to church for over 22 years and only a small amount of times...like 3 or 4...did I ever hear a person get up behind a pulpit and speak utter nonsense from the Bible.  Had I not have studied on my own time then I would have fell for what the fakes had said.  Now on the other hand because I study at home, when I get to church I can get more out of the preaching when our Pastor speaks becasue I can understand the message he is bringing forth.  I know that what he is saying is correct because it lines up with the word of God and therefore I can draw from what he is preaching.|`|597c2cb57b5dd60ca91e8fdd1a7325c6aa	The  problem with "a preacher interpret it for you" is that is one reason why we have so many different "christian religions today. We have too many preachers who teach  "their interpretation" of the  God's one word. Read Deut.18:20-22 and Acts 20:29. We are encourage at Heb.10: 24,25 to meet together. Pray for understanding, read Prov. 3:5,6; 4:5-7;|`|AGmZNf7zaa	yes and no... I stopped going to church and got lazy.. so church is like the inspiration to keep the fire burning, but I do prefer to interpret the bible on my own.|`|TDo1EMJkaa	Yep.  I read it myself and I could clearly see it was a load of crazy nonsense.|`|oUiVckg2aa	it depends. sometimes having a preacher interpret it for you could mean that he/she will be incorporating his/her views on you. sometimes, the verses in the bible could get complicated that we do need someone to explain it to us. i personally read it on my own. as for going to church, it has its advantages and disadvantages. you will have to find that out for yourself.|`|WVXHQv4Faa	Both, there is no other way, really. We need the experience of a good teacher but we also need to read if for ourself to keep thinking about it and learn.The preacher does need to back up their teachings with scriptual reference that support other teachings of the bible. For example, the fiery docuturne I asked about, it doesn't coincide with the teachings of God being all loving. So if that is being teached, there is no sound reasoning. Therefore you must question everything that is being taught to you. Its only when you gain knowledge that you can gain true faith through personal study and teachings of others who truly believe fully in the bible.

What you're really saying is that you don't know him well enough/care enough to get him something he'd actually like so you're taking the easy option.  Most guys I know would not be thrilled to get a gift like this.  If he's nice, he'll pretend he likes it so he doesn't hurt your feelings but chances are he's not really going to be too happy with it.    Put some thought in and get him something he wants and likes.    Every guy I know that's gotten a gift like this has been rather disappointed - you can buy a card that says I love you.  The bear will just end up hidden away somewhere.    If you're on a budget, you could always cook for him.  Make him a cake that says "I love you" or cook his favourite food - you could even make it a valentine's theme, like spagetti with heart shaped meatballs and garlic bread, for exapmple.  Or buy him a DVD that he really likes, but you don't so much, and watch it with him.|`|u0udwkZQaa	Yes. The message we like, and the bear is cute and loveable, just like you for giving it.

Check a mirror, periodically,.. make sure there's nothing hanging out of your nose.. or that your shirt isn't buttoned weird...  And, having been a teacher, I can tell you this... a student with messy hair is oftentimes a student who is lazy and/or  lacking in self-respect.. so that may be why teachers are looking at you.. it may be they are seeing you with pity.    It's good you don't suffer from low self-esteem, but it IS a bit bold of you to assume you know what others are thinking.      I used to know a guy like you, when I was a teenager. He was so full of himself, there was no room for anyone else.  He was too shallow for me.|`|JWLaPaAGaa	Gross!

Here is my opinion from stages in my life.    Stage 1:  The punk rock teenage years.  Yes, fully obsessed, as a girl I had a mohawk, spikes and pins and every imaginable metal object sticking off my clothes, noisey everything I could think of.  Tattoos.  People were SCARED but didn't hate.  I think they thought I would kill them or something.  But they all avoided me.    Stage 2:  Normal years.  Meaning, dressed like everyone else.  College years.  People treated me normal.  I used to dress really nice at times, looked really good, those were the times when no body hated me.    Stage 3: Islam.  I converted to Islam.  I began wearing hijab (headscarf) quickly after.  All those people from stage 2, now either divided: 100% nice or 100% mean.      The moral is:  people will hate on you if you look DIFFERENT.  Period.  People will act nervous if you are different because they don't know what to think.  People that like you but are afraid to come around you because you are different are doing so because they don't know how to approach you and talk to you.    Maybe you should be looking into how you are setting yourself apart from the crowd, even in a subtle way.  But my guess is it's not because you look too hot or too ugly (wasn't sure which way were you implying).  I think difference is the key.|`|4b763bad020f3ed283fdcd243915642faa	maybe your hair cut looks stupid and their trying not to laugh in your face, I doubt you look so incredible there just staring in envy    Whatever the case just ignore them|`|Bm9x9ydxaa	Yes girls can hate and talk :D
qzY6TuQmaa	charming all the way so much more fun|`|rBlrnxvvaa	HAWWWWT DEFINATELY...charming people piss me off with there smooth talking and all that ****...|`|MvmuZMG4aa	blazin hot.|`|DaYmkqe3aa	I'll take a non-charming hottie over a charming not-hottie any day!|`|ixrDuh4gaa	I'd rather date the enchantingly charming guy.  I'd just **** the smoking hot guy.      Sometimes, if you're lucky, they're both!|`|clD9MWAzaa	charming..|`|DZB0WCmmaa	the first|`|R7smL5mQaa	A bit of both but I'd prefer charming lol|`|HH90Eghaaa	Well if its just dating, "smoking hot" would be fun!  A relationship, then charming, but not too charming!|`|vV5QIlMVaa	enchantingly charming (:|`|lVNYRSs8aa	can they be both?    if not charming duh!!!!|`|sCGWcJTFaa	Well due to our hormones, we all want someone to look smoking hot. Yet when we find out that they are not that great in personality, we choose to find someone charming instead and they might not look as great. I rather choose for someone charming because you always want to be treated special not just have sex with them. But having both would be great though, too bad it's uncommon in today's world.
bn0oXqDcaa	you can say 'je te kiffe' which is more appropriate than je t'aime mon ami    or like the person before me said: je t'aime comme un(e) ami(e)    un ami = a male friend    une amie = a female friend    but like i said je te kiffe is better, its like 'i dig ya' in slang|`|lrsLI2JGaa	Je t'aime comme un ami.  "I love you as a friend."  Je t'aime can be interpreted as "I love you" or "I like you."  If the person you say it to knows French, just be aware of this.  That bit of French I first provided would work better, I think.
ecmnS63Uaa	no. and there is a good quote from that bar guy in ANCHORMAN legend of Ron burgundy "women can do stuff now".|`|FMuSs9Qtaa	I don't|`|fFmbBRbcaa	no girls are awesome|`|5dc6493b424c85096e22e1614be3c9daaa	most guys are sexist. I saw an Episode of Degrassi were this girl who can play footbal really good was being tormented by the guys on her team. they even beat her up. the thing she did is stand up for herself and love what she does and do the best she can at it. Maybe there are some guys in the wrestling team who understand your position. If there is maybe you can talk to them about it.|`|zIiiqNGBaa	No. He just feels threaten and that if he loses to you, he will be seen as as less than a girl.|`|BBlfetz3aa	sounds like someone likes you|`|D2M5iERjaa	95% would say yes its obvious that wrestling is a guys sport but for a girl to wrestle shows that u are just as tough and the only reason they put u down is because they know that u are tougher then they are|`|NTongQ9iaa	Ur right Fluffy many are but not all. Of course this is an opinion from a gay guy.|`|XuP0QwFtaa	When I graduated in 1995 there was a girl on the opposing team.  I think it was the first time a girl was on a wrestling team in our district then.  A lot of guys didn't want to lose to a girl so they kind of made fun of her.  Not to her face but they wondered why a girl would want to wrestle guys.  She did beat a guy and the guy got made fun of because he lost to a girl, which I didn't think was right.  Honestly, some guys were afraid they would get an erection.  Some of the guys didn't like it either because they thought she was getting all the attention.  I think she was but it was just because she was the first.  I was a very good wrestler and it would not bother me if a girl was on my team.  The only thing that would bother me is if was a huge distraction or she was a jerkoff (guys included).|`|ixrDuh4gaa	Pretty much, yeah, especially in a team or group setting.  One on one, you'll find they're much less sexist and less of a prick, all around.  It's that group setting that brings out the bad in guys--they have to impress their peers, so they try to be the most macho guy in the room, and that means being sexist.  See if you can arrange it so you're around a guy on the team one on one.  Talk to him.  I can (almost) guarantee he'll be a different person.
R1vos19Caa	Actually I was raised in a family that taught to not mix races. They would say "You are only supposed to date people in your race because that is our religion". But as I grew older I noticed that all other races were accepted except black. It is then I realized that my family was just racist and it had nothing to do with religious practices. So, I had to fight off the mindset that had been driven into my head, to not date black women. It just became a part of life to not even look at a black woman as dating material. I recently got into an argument with my parents about all of it. And my mother made the mistake of saying "why would anyone want to date a black woman they are not even good looking?" I was very upset by this and I let her know about it. Now, my mother is realizing that she had been brought up in that mindset as well and is working on getting her head cleared up.   So truly racism does still exist especially for black women. I have first hand knowledge of it. My grandfather once said to me "I would run every ****** over with my car if I could get away with it".  This is the kind of things children are still being taught. And I believe wholeheartedly something must be done to further rights and equality.  But over time I think this situation will get better as it seems the younger generations are starting to see things more clearly than previous generations are.  So black women don't be discouraged by the racism that plagues our society today. You are beautiful in every single way.|`|HUSFy3i5aa	I live in a major US city with a vibrant black community, Chicago, I don't have any preconceptions.|`|SI0PhJ5naa	I think the media is to blame for people's perception on a number of things. Luckily I've met plenty of intelligent, attractive Black women and know that any stereotypes are just that, stereotypes. Not every Black Women acts like those on talk shows, ranting and screamin' about her baby's daddy and throwing chairs.     However, my opinion is based on my personal experiences :P  I'm sure there are people with negative things to say.|`|GJdPuagzaa	My grandmother ued to say "pretty is as pretty does." Meaning, if you act like a nice, confident -but not arrogant - woman it is more beautifying than good looks and acting like a snot.    I relate to the open expression, "call it like you see it" of black women. I do not at all relate to the handful that act like queens and think they are owed smething. Like they are the only ones fighting and struggling. I think black women are slightly better looking than most white and latina women if they wear their clothes tailored.  Black women are packing curves fit to kill a man! Sometimes I see a black girl with such a perfect butt and I wish I had a butt that perfect, but then I think I would be spinning around real fast all the time to catch the guys checking me out.   Darker skinned women can wear clothes so much better because colors look better against their skin. Plus, black skin just plain lasts longer. You see black women 55 years old looking 35. Just like an Oil of Olay commercial and they didn't do anything to their skin!    Black women need to respect themselves more and not just let lack guys run rough shod over them. Good, worthwhile men are hard to find in ANY color, but especially hard to find in black.|`|3kNncEXpaa	i think we get alot of negative media attention. and i hope michelle can turn tha around for us. u would think oprah did that a while ago but i think non blacks forgets she is black at times lol|`|vqjTfkJ9aa	Black women are some of the strongest women on this planet. Unfortunately they don't receive much press for the positive things they do and accomplish. Considering the fact that they are the heads in most single parent households in their communities they have continued to excel in the workplace and universities. Contrary to popular belief, not all single parent families are on welfare. Black women have a drive and focus that can only be matched by there undeniable love for their children. I was raised in a two parent household, but it was my mother who showed me what strength was as i watched her sacrifice, make mistakes and deal with her consequences. Some of the most educated, career driven, and spiritually led individuals i know are black women. America loves the superstar black male athlete. To bad no one cares about the person who gave them hope and love when no one else was there. The only food chain black women are on the bottom of is the one of appreciation. As a black male there is no one group of women who i regard higher for their courage and faith because only God could be responsible for the miracles they give everyday to this world which are often overlooked.|`|hTRJFA4Jaa	For me, the color of your skin doesn't matter.    I'm just not physically attracted to the shape of your body.    I know that may sound strange, seeing as black women have most of the same features white women do, but here are the things that turn me off (and they apply to other colored women too):    -Bubble butt  -Hair being overstyled  -Making clicking noises when you talk (like when they click their tongues, not like how African bushmen talk, but like popping gum)  -Squashed nose  -Being overly reactive to situations (like screaming in movie theaters)  -Acting "ghetto"    There are some black women that I find very pretty, but they have to not have those qualities.    Hope that helps =)|`|yvWIt3Ubaa	I think the most horrible thing about this issue is that young Black men do not even appreciate us anymore. Then again, on the flip side, too many young Black women are perpetuating these stereotypes with their low-self esteem based on skin color and hair length, their attitudes, their insecurities and ignorance, and their competition with other Black women.    If anything, it is THIS generation of Blacks that are deteriorating. We need to take intiative and clean up our own backyards. We need to stop blaming it on each other and look at ourselves. We need to stop letting BET teach us about our Black History and do our own old fashion research. Guys need to throw away those god forsaken King/XXL magazine and read about true Black women. Girls need to stop idolizing Beyonce and video hoes, and start loving themselves.|`|8lNWNxmQaa	I don't think it's because of today's hip hop. Blacks have always been potrayed badly, and it has affected society greatly. These hip hop artist are just hopping on board|`|Pa4cyKn7aa	I'm quite young, just twenty two, but I feel as though the perception of a Black woman's beauty was never  much thought about until rap became as popular as it is today.    I can say that as a light complexioned Black woman, Black men and women, especially men value my skin color more than I do.    Likewise, there have been many Black men that either approached me or tried to "holla" at me by refering to my skin color.    "Ay lightskin, where ya man at?"  'Ay shorty, ay yo lightskin!"    I would agree that Black women are on the bottom of the chain when it comes to dating.  I mean, how can men of other races feel interested in dating Black women when so many Black men aren't even interested?!    At the same time, I see a lot of Black women walking around with scarfs, rollers, and shower caps on their head in public.  That doesn't exactly help the image of Black women when it comes to beauty.    One must realize that "society" holds Black women to a much higher standard of what beauty is.    I think the level of respect Black men have for Black women is practically non-existent.    *Sorry if my writing is all over the place.  I just wanted to get a word in.|`|yj3GT7jOaa	For the most part I like Black Women.  They are strong in character, reliable and resilient.  However, I have noticed the traits that I like in one of two types of women. One type of women would tell me I am black, know it and you will like it.  The other type of woman will tell me I am a woman and you need to accept that. The first type of woman does not fit  into the category of a person who I keep in good esteem.  The second type of black woman has the traits that I mentioned because she is a woman and accepts herself.  Concerning the treatment that black man may give a black women is and certainly should be a concern.  That issue would hold true for a woman in any race.  My observations tell me a black man often times refuses to accept a black woman for her independent relationship she is able to carry on with an individual.  Black men have a need for their women to depend on the them in some of these instances.|`|AA10855383	First off, I thnik very highly of black women. Yes we have strong opinions,, we do not take crap from anyone, but we are also smart, intelligent and we are just like anyone else, color has nothing to do with it.    Second.. if those men are blaming black women.. those are just people who blame everyone else for their problems BUT themselves.. men will go say that their woman is full of "drama" and use that as excuse to go out there and to the things they do. Or perhaps, look for someone who is willing ot put up with them like that. Yeah i've seen a few of those women-bashing youtube videos, and things they say do no justice neither does it set the stage for how we are.. their reasons to me are not valid at all. To me its like a blame game, poor excuse type of thing.    What else was i gonna say.. oh yeah. The Media.I do not like to see other black wmoen get on tv and misbehave on these reality shows, talk shows, etc.... because the way SOME act justifies why many people have those stereotypes about the REST of us. I notice how on certain reality shows they tend to pan the camera on the black ladies who are not like that, yet STILL expect them to get out of hand and start drama for the tv. Music Videos.. its not just hip-hop videos where you see women degrading them selves, I've also seen it in latin (reggaeton) videos and such.    There is nothing wrong with black women, and I'm not just saying that because I am black and trying to defend my people. I cannot defend those who choose to live up to the stereotypes but I am defending myself and those who do not. What you see on tv and youtube is not how things are in reality. There are also many intelligent, EDUCATED, smart black women out there who are just as high up o the "food chain" as anyone else. And I am not going to let those negative coments people say about black women affect me. And it shouldn't affect you.|`|sVrkjixAaa	From my own life experience, I think a big part of the stereotype comes from some black women trying to be like the women they see on MTV or other TV channels. It might be related to finding an identity, as some women might find that image appealing. The majority of black women I've met obviously don't do this, but for one reason or another seeing someone who fits their stereotype stays in someone's memory a lot more than someone who doesn't.    Edit-I know, but just as with pretty much every stereotype out there, some people copy it. I noticed growing up that almost everyone tried to find an identity, and instead of creating their own a lot of people just became what they either thought was cool or what they thought people expected of them.|`|p8Mc6rpBaa	The first women to ever love me was a Black woman. She was my mother. She would give her life for me no question. Black women have loved me all my life. It was a Black woman that taught me love. I love Black women. Even at their worst when they break my heart by acting in an unbecoming, unworthy manner they are still queens and I love them.|`|tlUihEOvaa	I feel as if I can relate to this because being an Asian American male I do see people stereotyping us as the least attractive race of men. They say we are nerdy, short, asexual, small wangs, ugly, and etc.     So I think the media has contributed to the degrading of minority groups. The portrayals just lead many to generalize or believe stereotypes, especially in this time of technology where more and more people are watching television than going out there to explore. People now rely on what they see on the media, so media is an effective tool indeed.|`|oKvyaIPSaa	women are women and that's it|`|H4GM9kWyaa	I've spoken to many many people about this issue and I can honestly say, it depends on the person.  For me, the colour of your skin doesnt matter. But that's just me|`|AA11198190	Disergard colour..........  l do not give a hoot  about colour....  l prefer the person to be honest,have morals......and be happy.|`|c82ecbef231aced5c49891502424aad3aa	You know I never really held any type of color thing in high regard, The color of a person's skin means nothing to me what means anything is what is inside and how they live there lives and how they treat others and if they are kind to animals that's what makes a person for me.|`|UyITmoH7aa	The way I see it, the media is probably the center of the problem. Usually, countries will make their own race look good while degrading other races. For example, in Australia (which is where i am from, although I am of asian background but i was born in australia) there is a current affairs program (cant say its name) which usually portrays basically any minority group such as asians, african-australians, europeans, ect. as bad, without even showing their point of view.|`|0UjFOsHkaa	When I see someone, I pay no attention to their color. I do not judge them until I get to know  them. I've met many black women who are so kind and genuine, and I met some who were down right *****es. Same with all people, regardless of color. I can't say I like or do not like someone until I actually know them|`|4Y1qzeBfaa	I'm married to a black woman, she is american, I'm french and white, and personally, I do not care about skin color. I've met different kind of black women and men, you can't really judge someone on his skin color    Image of black women on many rap videos are totally degrading, but that's my personal opinion
h21PoIcraa	Unionbay stretch pants|`|EYqTV2EYaa	When I shop, I purchase for various types of items depending on which store I visit. When shopping for clothing, I mainly visit Macy's and Underground Station for casual clothes, and Saks Fifth Avenue and Simply Fashions for the formal. The brands are typically Apple Bottoms, Baby Phat, Akademiks, and Blac Label. For the formal days, I purchase Gucci dresses, but sometimes, I don't care about the label, but rather style.

G9R6VZOXaa	You need to be aware of other people's faults, just so as you can avoid them and make compromises if you need to    This awareness can also help you, to help your partner, correct those faults.

However if they continue to make faults over and over again after they kept saying sorry over and over again, then you should NOT ignore the faults and should look to either settle the issue or leave the person for good.|`|U6gz8qUcaa	it depends on what the faults are really.    and what you determine as a fault, one of my exs voiced her hate of my morning burps (i have an acid problem in my stomach so im always burping in the morning before ive even drunk or eaten anything) and another ex found it cute.    If im going out with someone and their a regular pill taker (like E's and other recreational drugs) thats a fault to me because i dont take anything and no i couldnt turn a blind eye to it. (but people who Take recreational drugs aswell wont find that as a fault)    so i guess really it depends on what the fault is.    I used to be a heavy drinker, so to date someone who is a heavy drinker would be a fault for me as they could drag me back down to heavy drinking.    so no, i can maybe turn a blind eye at first but at some point ill have to do something about it, like leave them or learn to accept.|`|5I6ZQUn7aa	No.|`|39KzYiS2aa	I'd say it's dependent on the fault: some of them are small and can be overlooked, others one just can't turn another check to and they need to be addressed.|`|RbYEif0Waa	uh huh (:|`|NmQCYizTaa	No. You love them because of their faults, I've found sometimes.    And it's a bad idea to ignore someone's faults if you're going to live with them the rest of your life. You have faults also, and with love comes that realization, crystal clear. You will both annoy the heck out of each other sometimes, but the love will remain.|`|JXH8SDqOaa	I don't think you should ignore their faults, but most of us do without realizing it. That's when we get in trouble and end up in an unhappy relationship.

TWKIuTEyaa	Eras are not always called after the first name of the monarch.    For example, the Regency period and the Reformation.    It could simply the William period, or the Windsor period.    We do not refer to ourselves as Elizabethans anyway. That term still applies only to the time of Elizabeth l.|`|tuKY5Q7Waa	If they can't use William in that context, they might just use his family name instead?|`|T0xLpygfaa	it still would be the house of windsor, which is not named after an era.  windsor was formerly known as saxe coberg gotha, a german dynasty with its roots in the hanoverian kings.|`|H8gsDRWeaa	When ascending to the Throne, the Monarch doesn't necessarily take the name he is usually known by.  So Prince William might decide to become George VII or Edward IX. To add more confusion, some of the older members of the Royal Family had nicknames that had nothing at all to do with their given names. Lord Louis Mountbatten was known as "Dickie" -- because that's what Queen Victoria called him.   If William becomes King William V, Williamite might be the Era. This may have been  the case with King William III (William of Orange), but not in the instance of King William IV, whose reign was part of the Hanoverian Era.
u0udwkZQaa	Sure. He likes you, so all you need to do is show that you have spent time and thought on it tailoring it to his likes. There's nothing wrong with making the evening good for both of you, but showing him you're putting effort into pleasing him will make him feel great. What does he like doing activity-wise? What does he like to eat? (much better if you cook it yourself) Then the rest is up to you. All men like massages, and lingerie. One thing you need to sort out is the day structure, if he's planning a day out for you, you don't want yours to clash, so look for clues about possible plans he might have made.|`|osoTq2dcaa	im trying to do the same thing ! its really hard ... we might go to dinner and then maybe sped the day in the city ! something fun thought maybe even a picnic|`|yC55lotMaa	Going out together is the one option that I'd suggest.   becuase you can see a lot of people acting what they feel with thier lover.  moreover, you can realize that your boyfreind is care of you when he hold your hand while walk across the road..  - have adinner in a small shop nearbe side road..so romantic..i think|`|CCqqTw6paa	well for her  hire a hotel room  get rose petals scatter it from the doorway to the bathtub, have a hot bubble bath ready with some candles and music, have your menu from room service handy and order while she's in there freshening up.

0NdBx2keaa	18 is arbitrary. Many different cultures and anthropologists, psychologists, sociologists agree that once a girl reaches puberty she is an adult and ready to have babies.|`|oPDTdoWDaa	Actually, depending on your age and where you live, it could very well be okay for you to be attracted to a minor.|`|WX1b747Iaa	Just go with it, the hassles that ensue if you get caught with a minor will last you for the rest of your life.|`|pxwqB9Zyaa	attraction is psychological, physical, sexual    the legal age of consent varies but  the reason is to protect the young and vulnerable from predatory adults.  Children do not have the maturity or the power to protect themselves.    You need to grow up, why are you attracted to children instead of potential partners youurown age?|`|EYqTV2EYaa	Western society is fueled mostly by religion and morals. In my opinion, it should be loosed.|`|0kWsC3Uhaa	It's to protect the person under 18.  They are not mature enough yet to make this decision.  You can still be attracted to them, just not have sex.|`|t8a0YzZOaa	The whole idea is to keep perverts away from impressionable children. 18 is when they start getting out on their own and start becoming adults.     Having your urges and acting on them are very different things. It's not hard to see why someone might be attracted to the sexed-up little corporate whores like Miley Cyrus because she has the best image team money can buy, but she is not enough of an adult on a personal level, due to her age, to have any sort of physical relationship or really understand what an adult relationship is like.    There is also a difference between being attracted to someone who happens to be 16 or 17 and being attracted to minors. I sincerely hope that you fit the former instance.
wCXY3MJ2aa	Yes the flowers would have wilted and withered when they arrive in England. But I am sure she can appreciate your efforts. It is not the flowers that count but your efforts. Alternatively, you can order online from a local (England) florist and have it delivered fresh. Good luck.|`|nHxfRHbnaa	i think so....   They will die before the mail reaches your girl. try to contact the flower merchant in her area, and make a delivery to her;s home..|`|BqDyxcvpaa	It's tough to know if the roses would survive, It all just depends on how they are handled but putting a small amount of water in a bag tied to the bottom sounds good, If they're all dead by the time they reach your girlfriend, I suggest something like getting 5 real roses and 1 fake one, then tying a note to the fake one saying "even if that other roses die my love for you will last as long as this rose". You can never be sure if they would die, as I said it all depends on how they're handled and then any certain temperatures they might have to travel through. And that is the only backup plan in case they die, and girls believe it's also a very sweet thing to do. I hope this helped.
BjQcwGSLaa	True, Americans do say it this way "I am pregnant with my second baby". When you translate this literally into Polish, it will indeed mean that her second baby made her pregnant.  "Pani jest w ciazy z pianista" - there is no need to add 'z dzieckiem' as it is obvious that if you are pregnant there is a baby involved.

I think people shouldn't be asking such lucrative questions, like, it may annoy your sister's baby when she grows up.|`|Hxqk9LoHaa	Because many white women who adopt, have Chinese children. It is very common.  When you adopt, there is usually more Chinese babies available, for example, then white babies.

The steps to follow are these and you are somewhere along the line already.    1. Ask for the Practice Manager and tell her your requirements.    2. If that doesn't work send them a letter repeating your requirements, you should receive a reply within two days, at the most ten working days.    3. If this doesn't work the you have to contact your Primary Care Trust as below:    "If your are unable to resolve your complaint with your GP or practice, you should refer your complaint to your Primary Care Trust (PCTs- England& Scotland) Community Heatlh Council (CHCs - Wales) or Health and Social Services Trust (HSS Trusts - Northern Ireland)".

C7zHcvE9aa	I know what you mean.. Most of the time they say '' The reason I dont like bi people, is because they dont know what they want''. Ive heard that one many times, Also many are jealous because they cant get both sexes. That is always my come back, ''at least I can get both sexes you cant'', hehe a bit harsh but still. You know the other day My friend told me she would not date a ''bi'' guy because its nasty but honestly most of the time they are  insecure. TO be Honest with you, I would Rather Date a Straight Girl or a Straight up gay guy. Bi I would not mind but still hehe uncertainty is always there in the back of our minds. especially finding out that he or she cheated on you for another gender ehhh, Hard to cope with. possibly battle of the sexes. Hey just Relax, I cant tell you to be in the closet cause heh. Good question. be aggressive and if there is no need to tell them dont but if you want to let them, let them  know from the start.

For reals|`|iKytX00Paa	People confuse "bi" with "poly" all the time.    When I first started dating my current boyfriend and I told him I was bi, he didn't say much at first.    And then he asked me if that meant I was going to look for another person while we were dating.    There are a lot of misconceptions out there.  You just have to be as calm and patient as possible if you value the other person, IMO.    Good luck.|`|897f9782bd9356ff775df4cf6a07496faa	In my own experience what I didn't like was being deceived by girls lying to me about being lesbians when they weren't, they were bi instead. It's the lies I dislike.  Also the concern for higher risks for STDs: transmitting diseases from straights to gays and viceversa.|`|pmEnOPomaa	It's not so much that people "hate" bisexuals, it's the idea instilled in people minds from the media.     take katy perry for example, she had the number one "party-bi" song of the nation.    it's the idea that being gay is cool, teeny bopper girls will willingly make out with other girls buit dont like the idea of a relationship.    or the idea of emo/scene kids, the taboo aspect of appearing gay make you cool but you still like gays,    also it's the sence that bisexual people cant make up their minds..      you have to realize it's not bisexuals people hate it's the fake hollywood image stupid people have created to protray a bisexual person.
ohUm00RYaa	Lol, I find that hard to believe that you look that middle eastern. I mean most moroccans that I have meet look mixed to me, and I'm from algeria (south of wuh'ran)and am black. Moroccans are actually mixed with african and turkish like most north africans.  Like Moroccan people generally have hair that look very similar to mix race people, like curly and they are tanned. There is actually a big black community in wuh'ran and it is fairly close to morocco.  Morocco has a larger black community than algeria so I'd be surprise if your dad wasn't mixed.    Then again I have meet americans who have tried to convince that I look white and some think my brother is mixed even though I am clearly black and so is he.    Kind of sad really because lots of these "black" american are probably less black then you in terms of ancestry    You also have to remember though that some of the greatest black people in american were not "very" black looking, like fredrick douglas or w.e.b. du bois, many of these people could have even passed for whites but choose to identify as blacks and were vital in destroying the kkk a racist white terrorist organization who murdered blacks, jews, italians and other non-whites.    I can't tell you to wave a wand and become black but you are black.  Race is a social concept really.  Remmeber how in some states a black person needed only 1/16 black ancstry but in others it could be 1/8 black ancestry.  In other words you could change race by walking across the county line into a new state.  So you see race is what people make it up to be it has no objective foundation.  What I can say though is that he who identifies as black and has black ancestry is black.  If Obama is black, Halle Berry, Mariah Carey and Jimmy Hendrix why not you?|`|AA12325475	Whether you live in Lagos, Kyoto, Guinea Bissau or San Francisco it's you under your skin that people will react to, so I suggest you get over the superficial 'I don't look black' thing and start being who you really are.

Nothing wrong with being both. Not sure how to solve you recognition problem though. Perhaps get someone influential in the black community where you are to believe you?|`|j3bE41RNaa	I honestly don't think it should be a problem what others think about what your race is and what they believe is the truth. You should be equally proud of your background and its up to other people whether they want to except that or not.   It doesn't matter if you don't have all the features of one race or the other, the main point is that you know where you come from and you back yourself up when others don't want to believe you.   My dad is a pale skinned red head....but he comes from a family of tanned skinned dark hair.   People will learn to except you for who you are and what your background is, and the people that don't believe you can just go on thinking whatever they think    Stick to your roots and don't let yourself down.|`|AA12275780	I'm a white guy and even I'm black.

Take pride in both of ur cultures.|`|XS3PexPIaa	You are not black... You're father is moroccan so you are morrocan. and morrocans look more arab...|`|fB4RfiCgaa	Racial pride is overrated. Why not be proud of what you can do instead of people who lived before you that you had no control over. I have ancestors who did some pretty amazing things, but it was not me who did them. They can be good examples, but so can people of other races. I'm sure that being a minority makes it easier to empathize with your ancestor's struggles, but I just don't like it when people have to live through them.
EYqTV2EYaa	I'm 20-years-old, so it wasn't long ago when I was a teenager at all, so therefore, I still have many things to look forward to, but so far, everything is going according to plan. When I was younger during elementary school days, I had many learning disabilities and a strong case of dyslexia, all of which caused me to advance to the other grades slowly. I've made it throughout all the grades in special ed classes, taking forever to learn how to read, write, and do math. Honestly, despite contemporarily having a lot of friends and great social skills, intelligence, logic, and what I'll call interesting personality, I still believe I have some form of mental impairment. Nonetheless, during those days, I always wanted to get out of the learning disability classes because I hated the kids with the behavior disorders, whom where in the room across the hall, making fun of me all the time because I couldn't read. Thankfully, during 5th grade, I fully learned how to read and write and I was out of LD classes. So, that went how I wanted it. Afterwards, I began to adapt in middle school, which is something I wanted and I as I got older, I became a cosmetologist, something I always wanted to do. I also have the dream to become a lawyer, and right now, that's what I'm trying to fulfill. Therefore, yes, I feel life is going just how I wanted it.|`|n2O0NwR6aa	I recently ran across a paper I'd written in 5th grade, back in 1976.  The subject was, "What will your life be like in the year 2000?"  I'd imagined that I'd be married to handsome man (check), have tons of pets (check), have 3 kids (almost - I have 2), and that I'd have a nice big house with a pool (dang, no pool!).  The only part I was really off about was the flying car.  I guess cell phones and internet hadn't even entered my imagination.  But for the most part, my 10-year-old self was pretty much right on.    If I'd written something like that as a teenager, though, I'm sure it would've been a lot different!  I would've visualized myself living in Africa, saving the lions and elephants; or being a marine biologist, rescuing sea life from oil spills; traveling the world as National Geographic photographer, perhaps; or maybe being an environmental lawyer.      My teenage self would've been bitterly disappointed if she'd known that none of those dreams would come true.  "What??  You're just going to end up being a plain old stay-at-home mom?  You'll never live a life of adventure or make a difference in the world?  How totally laaamme!"      I never would have predicted that I'd drop out of college to help my mom open a gymnastics school; that I'd turn out to be a darn good gymnastics coach and spend 15 years totally immersed in the sport; that during those years I would have a chance to make a positive impact on the lives of hundreds of kids, and have the satisfaction of watching them grow into beautiful, confident young ladies.      I wouldn't have guessed that I'd marry a "regular guy", instead of a Steve Irwin or Jeff Corwin.  That I'd live in a non-descript suburb and spend half my day in the car driving my kids from one activity to the next.  Or that my kids would turn out to be the most amazing people ever - and that making a good home and life for them would take precedent over everything, and that watching them grow into kind, happy, wonderful people would make me happier than anything I could've imagined.    I am sorry that I didn't get the chance to follow some of my dreams. And if I had a chance to do some of those things now, I'd take it in a minute.  But not if I had to trade it for the life I've lived so far.  When all is said and done, I'm glad that my 5th-grade self turned out to be right!|`|pZBq0TKcaa	So far, no.  It's not very different. Just a little bit.|`|zN1TyLMPaa	it didnt turn out anything wht i wanted but i got the will power , skills and fame you see only because of hard work and thinking....so start thinking a lot and do work for that ....you will only then achieve something....i personally made the largest amateur telescope in india i.e 20 inch mirror ...hmmmm so i like stars and astronomy|`|a993fdffebb5d1eb64fe6baba1499d98aa	No. I was going to be veterinarian.

Concentrate on what you know about yourself and your friends.  If you stop to really think about it, you know there are people you trust.  That is the basis for friendship.  If you don't trust anyone, then you need to re-examine why.  If you think there is something wrong with yourself, then you will build up you insecurities until you get your sense of well being out of kilter.    All of us start thinking about the moments when people look at us, and you can make too much of it.  Most of the time, it is nothing.    I know this sounds like I am over simplifying the issue, but try to relax and let other people have a chance with you.|`|K1M2ujKbaa	People are not staring at you as much as you think.

TX5uV9bIaa	Proverbs 3:5-6 (New International Version)    Trust in the LORD with all your heart          and lean not on your own understanding;   in all your ways acknowledge him,          and he will make your paths straight.|`|qRFTEBlGaa	Prov 3:5,6 says:?Trust in Jehovah with all your heart and do not lean upon your own understanding. 6?In all your ways take notice of him, and he himself will make your paths straight.    Why We Should Trust Jehovah Implicitly    6 In these critical times hard to deal with, we, like the Israelites, face foes that are stronger than we are. (2?Timothy 3:1) We are pressured morally, spiritually and, in some cases, even physically. On our own, we are unable to withstand those pressures, since they originate with a superhuman source, Satan the Devil. (Ephesians 6:12; 1?John 5:19) Where, then, can we turn? In prayer to Jehovah, a faithful man of old said: Those knowing your name will trust in you. (Psalm 9:10) If we truly know Jehovah and understand what his name stands for, we will trust in him as surely as did Joshua and Caleb.John 17:3.    7 Why should we trust in Jehovah? Joshua and Caleb did so in part because they had seen demonstrations of his power. So have we. Consider, for example, Jehovahs works of creation, including the universe, with its billions of galaxies. The immense physical forces that Jehovah controls demonstrate that he is, indeed, the Almighty. As we contemplate the marvels of creation, we have to agree with Job, who said of Jehovah: Who can resist him? Who will say to him, What are you doing? (Job 9:12) In truth, if Jehovah is on our side, we need fear no one in the whole universe.Romans 8:31.|`|NGpztOIMaa	Oh I think I've heard of something like that in the Bible.

f43be0279e4f60717eb598a32d93faa0aa	No.    Because sometimes you need to tell people something they really won't like but which is meant in 100% sincerity.    It's just that some people often use it to defend a multitude of insults.    So I can see your point in some situations, but in others it's totally justified.    e.g. An alcoholic  friend is drinking and driving, he's a lovely chap, but needs to understand he's in the wrong. So saying to him what he's doing is wrong, and more than that, totally selfish, and showing him his disregard for other road user's safety  is not acceptable to me will upset him, but I'm not trying to be offensive, just truthful. This seems a perfect time to add 'no offense' to the statement.|`|WX1b747Iaa	Because a little bit of sugar helps the medicine go down.|`|P0EAzyw8aa	say something offensive back, what goes around comes around|`|AA11690436	And how about, "It's not the money, it's the principle of the thing!" when it is really always about the money?|`|4Z8wogroaa	yes, it's like shooting someone but warning them that you were going to shoot them beforehand. hahaha. as if by saying that they could not take responsibility for the outcome.  tell them! say, "don't say no offense when you know that that's very offensive."

God is eternal - He always existed and always will exist.    That we can not fully understand God does not mean that what we believe about Him is incorrect.  In fact,  since God is infinite and we are finite, it is impossible for us to understand God completely through our own reasoning and earthly observations.      Our reasoning and observations can show us that God exists,  but we can not actually through our own efforts fully know everything about God.   Our realization that we can not fully understand God through our own actions is a significant sign that we are approaching our best possible understanding of God.    Peace be with you.|`|tGkFPA82aa	Without time, there is nothing, so we don't know how long existance existed as nothingness.  Then something impossible happened. I don't know what it was, but I wasn't there to see it.  Impossible things happen all the time, so it's not out of the realm of infinate possibility.    It's possible that it's an ontological paradox, but even then, it was probably something really odd like reverse spinning gamma radiation coliding into itself and creating matter.|`|dl97DmmYaa	god came from nothing.  he is the prime mover unmoved, the creator uncreated.     NOUN:     God   A being conceived as the perfect, omnipotent, omniscient originator and ruler of the universe, the principal object of faith and worship in monotheistic religions.   The force, effect, or a manifestation or aspect of this being.   A being of supernatural powers or attributes, believed in and worshiped by a people, especially a male deity thought to control some part of nature or reality.

This follows with the belief that God existed before all things.  For God to be a creator of finite things He must be infinite, as a creation can only be equal to or less than the creator.  God could not create an infinite being since this is a contradiction and is logically impossible.  If God were created then He would have to have a creator and this would go on and on.  This however could not go on for infinity as there could always be one more and you cannot have more than infinite.  This points to the fact there must be a First Cause that is Uncaused.|`|g7RnYMoNaa	There is always an explanation, but we don't always get the explanation.

And, like "Uncle Joe", I also pray that the Holy Spirit will fill you completely when you receive the Sacrament.|`|Icwz678Qaa	I thought that only the Almighty God proclaimed who are Saints.    A Saint is someone who is sacred, holy, pure, blameless, dedicated. They became saints by means of the Holy Spirit, which can only come from God. God therefore chooses His saints, and gives them of His Holy Spirit to make it possible - (The Church of God, Daily Bible Study).    People, self-proclaimed churches nor anyone else on this earth has the "Authority" of the Almighty God to decide who will or will not be a Saint of "His."    This a sinful and presumptuous act that the Roman church has mandated herself to undertake without the authority of the Almighty God to do so.    None of us have the right or the authority to do such a thing.    Matthew 7:22, 23 - On judgment day many will tell me, 'Lord, Lord, we prophesied in your name and cast out demons in your name and performed many miracles in your name.'  But I will reply, 'I never knew you. Go away; the things you did were unauthorized.    Matthew 7:21 " . . . The DECISIVE ISSUE IS WHETHER THEY OBEY MY FATHER in heaven."    Be Blessed:-)

2a5881df65c98b14ac8b795a2848acd7aa	As many people misunderstand, it's not LTTE to first demand for a seperate nation.    It was first made by C.Suntheralingam M.P of Vavuniya in 1958    Revived in 1970s by S.J.V Chelvanayakam the founder leader of Ilankai Tamil Arasu Katchi (ITAK) even releasing seperate stamp for their nation    And hope you know the series of incidents that followed.     So the reasons for the claim like inequality, indifference of Sinhalese majority govt to tamil feeling, language and their buddhist chauvenism still remain or may be worsened.    So the need/aspiration for a seperate nation or autonomy will always remain.    The sinhalese govt which wishes to end this struggle by military force dedicating thousands of sinhalese lives and crores of sinhalese tax money can not convince the majority sinhalese to agree for a negotiated settlement or an autonomy of any kind.    Instead they would like the supporters of national split, to be punished.    The fight for freedom will continue in different forms.. worser if not in same form.     In turn tamils will feel crushed, ashamed, defeated and will have hostility in their mind for centuries to come. This will ruin the country.    This crush-raise cycle will continue until a negotiated settlement (of any kind) is achieved.    So, Tamils will continue to suffer domination from Sinhalese and will be deprived of political representation in a deeper sense.    The restrictions on their education, language, livelihood will continue, fuelling yet another era of blood shed.    But all these are the probable outcomes assuming Tigers are defeated. I strongly doubt that rebels are anywhere near a failure.    Tigers are the most dreaded and disciplined rebel group in the world and won't make it an easy exercise for the Srilankan military.    With the growing pressure on Tigers, have you ever felt that the public support for Tigers is reducing. I am sure it is at its peak now.    This tactic by Sinhalese ruling class will never augur any justice to Tamils.

8DCslWmMaa	I'm not sure if I am totally understanding what you mean by called to it.  Called to it because you have this ability?  Everyone has psychic ability, it is that most do not believe it so they do not see it in themselves.  If you have abilities that are naturally strong, that can be a hard cookie to chew. Those that are empathic can be bombarded with impressions and sensations that can be overwhelming.  That is why those that call it a gift also call it a curse.    Just because you do does not mean that you have to be a psychic as a profession, or that you have to tell people what you 'see'.  Then again, there could be more to this that you have not expressed.  You may have that nagging feeling that this IS what you are supposed to do.    The thing with psychic ability, one CAN learn how to turn it off and on just as easy as a light switch.

That's not really common sense.  Common sense would not be allowing people to go through your wallet.      It's not that they think they can walk all over you.  It's that drunk people have *great* ideas of things that sound hilarious to them at the time.  They really want to see someone do that.  You seem to think they aren't aware but I bet if you talked to them sober you'd find they'd still think that was funny and want to watch someone do it.    Dumb drunks are dumb people when they are sober too.

You can move to where you're not standing near a woman or you can move to the front of the bus.  If you are guilty (I'm not saying you are), then you need to stop immediately, because that's a crime and you can be arrested.

They love picking on a kid who is alone just because they are more than one person and it makes them feel cool amongst their friends.  Yes, some people would say "Stand up for youself and show them you aren't scared and they'll eventually leave you alone" but doing something so rational would probably make matters worse.  You'll never know how they will react.  Just tell the bus driver that there are a group of kids harassing you on the bus and you don't feel safe on the bus anymore.  They'll probably get removed and picked up from a different bus everyday.  Hope this helps!|`|nvDNAqWKaa	hm tell them "no i didn't?"

There are a lot more chapters and verses mentioned in the below website along with music, speeches and praise and worship.    http://jesustrinity.blogspot.com    Jesus is God. He is alive forever.    The questions usually asked are:-    1) Did Jesus really exist?  2) Is Jesus God?  3) If Jesus is God, then why did He keep praying to the Father in Heaven? How can the Father and Jesus be one God? Why did Jesus have to suffer on the Cross?  4) What is the Holy Spirit?  5) What is so special about Jesus? Why cant I just view him as an ordinary man or a teacher or a prophet? Why should I see him as God?      It would not be possible to give a short answer to these questions .    I suggest you visit the below website.    After visiting the below website, you would get a lot of answers.    http://jesustrinity.blogspot.com    1.Thomas calls Jesus God in John 20:28 (Note, Thomas addresses Jesus  specifically.)  2. Jesus is God in Heb. 1:8  3. John the apostle states that Jesus was the Word which was God that became  flesh (John 1:1-14)  4. The phrase "Call upon the name of the LORD" (Hebrew, YHWH, i.e., Psalm  116:4) used only of God on the OT, and translated into the Greek in the LXX as  "Call upon the name of the LORD (greek, KURIOS)," applied to Jesus in the NT  (1 Cor. 1:2) Jesus is God in flesh  5. The apostle John says that Jesus was , "...calling God His own Father,  making Himself equal to God," (John 5:18)  6. Jesus said that He and the Father are One (John 10:30), that caused the Pharisees to  claim that Jesus was making Himself out to be God.  7. Jesus knew all things (John 21:17)  8. Jesus knew all men (John 16:30)  9. Jesus is everywhere (Matt. 28:20)  10. Jesus Christ, dwells in you (Col. 1:27)  11. Jesus is the exact representation of the Nature of God (Heb. 1:3)  12. Jesus is eternal (Micah 5:1-2)  13. Jesus gives eternal life (John 10:27-28)  14. Jesus is our only Lord and Master (Jude 4)  15. Jesus is called the Mighty God (Isaiah 9:6)  16. Jesus is called the Mighty God (Isaiah 9:6) and "God" also be called the  Mighty God in Isaiah 10:21  17. Jesus is able to raise Himself from the dead (John 2:19-21)  18. Jesus created all things (Col. 1:16-17), it is God who created all things  by Himself (Isaiah 44:24)  19. Jesus searches the hearts and minds of the people (Rev. 2:23)  20. Jesus is worshiped (Matt. 2:2-11; Matt.14:33; Matt.28:9; John 9:35-38;  Heb. 1:6) Only God can be worshipped (Matt. 4:10) (same Greek word for worship  is used in each place.)  21. In the OT God was seen (Exodus 6:2-3;Exodus 24:9-11; Num. 12:6-9; Acts  7:2), yet no man can see God (Exodus 33:20; John 1:18). It was not the Father  that was seen in the OT (John 6:46). Who, then were they seeing? See John  8:58.  22. Jesus claimed the divine name, "I AM", for Himself in John 8:58 see  Exodus 3:14.  23. Jesus says you must honor him even as you honor the Father (John 5:23).  24. Jesus gives life (John 5:21).  25. Jesus bears witness of Himself (John 8:18;John 14:6).  26. Jesus is the One who will judge you on judgement day (John 5:22-23). Only God can be the judge.  27.

And  . . .Dude! You want to come to God. Did you know that is the key to all of this? You cannot want to come to God unless the Father is willing. Jesus said that twice in John 6.

Try calling up a kingdom hall nearest to you and ask for a free home Bible study. Two loving brothers would love to study the Bible with you so you can DRAW CLOSER TO GOD. You set the time, and if you don't want to study any longer, then you just let them know, but I can almost guarantee that you will not want to stop learning "accurate knowledge" about Jehovah God and his word, the Bible. It is that accurate knowledge can only lead to everlasting life. It would take you repenting from your former course of life and "putting on a new personality" [and keeping it].

Its having to deal with all the garbage the world has in it is the hard part.    Church isn't going to get you closer to God if your not seeking him though out the day. Lets say if there were no church services or a bible for you to read. Then how you going to believe in him? Abraham did not have a bible or go to Church but he still knew he was there.    Put the bible down and stop folding your hands and closing your eyes and start talking to him and asking him questions. And when you see suffering in the World start hounding God to make it stop. And keep at it till the day you die. He will answer you, it might not be a miracle like I am waiting for but he does answer and show that he is there.    Then once he answers you learn to obey his Holy Spirit as God is a Spirit. This is the way he talks regularly. For some reason unknown to me he rarely audibly speaks to people.

You can feel that something in your relationship with the Father is missing and you desire for it to be put right,, don't give up... your diligence shows your faith in a sense and your desire to find the truth for yourself so you may experience the peace that comes with the knowledge of a Living God. Pray for this testimony.. i feel it will not be had by a powerful voice telling you of His existence but something that happens in your life or a series of events that will unfold to you that will show you and you will either be able to have eyes to see it because you have not stopped looking or you will miss it because you have given up and resigned yourself to the fact that there probably isn't a Living God.Once the Holy Ghost Bears witness to the truth of God and Jesus Christ  nothing  and no one can take that gift of the spirit from you.. When you do get your testimony of God nurture it and record the events that lead up to it in a spiritual journal so you can re read the events and ponder the gift and replenish your faith if you need to recharge. Please don't give up. Pray and ask for a heart that is ready to receive a testimony of His Love and Greatness.Plead your cause and explain you have been waiting and desiring this gift and could He please help you to receive it.? Continue to be patient and open .. meditate often on spiritual precepts ..got questions? Ask Heavenly Father with the spirit of a child asking a Father ... and expect an answer or a direction to an understanding of Him and what the answer may be...

God made it easy and sent us messengers and prophets to show us the way and tell us why... so all the messengers and all the religions are from the same only God, so they've got to be complementary to each other, not opposing each other!!! then God must have said His final words in the last message, what is the last message? and how do we know it's the last one? I guess that would be the religion that believes in all messengers and all books equally... is there such religion? actually yes, Islam does :)  A True Muslim (man or woman) gets his reward for obeying Allah's orders (Allah means The God in Arabic) by going to heaven, where he/she are indulged forever in all the good things that were on earth and more, things no one ever dreamt of or heard about. The Holy Quran tells Muslims (men and women) there will be good food, good wine and sex in heaven for all, but not in the bestial way you may think of, but rather in a way that is satisfactory for everyone and better than what was on earth. Heaven is no heartbreak or injustice land.  True Muslims are no terrorists, and Islam never calls for that, Islam means peace, it bans violence unless you were fought so you fight back, it only doesn't require Muslims to be cowards, and true Muslims understand this very well and never attack civilians.   Islam is the only religion that accepts freedom of religion and asks men to treat women gently like queens.   It's all in the Holy Quran and the right teachings of prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him).  If some people behave otherwise, then it's because people behaviour doesn't necessarily reflect the rulings of their religion always, for example, we can't (and don't) judge Christianity by Hitler or Madonna.  And that is another reason why there is heaven and hell after we die, heaven for the obedient and hell for the disobedient and/or oppressor, it's all going to be decided on the day of resurrection and judgement.  To be a Muslim, you must believe God is only one with no spouses or offspring, believe in his angels (servants not males or females), believe in all his religions, messangers and books equally, the day of judgement, heaven and hell and that everything is in God's hands and because of his will (good or bad).  Muslims believe God is the only divine who never dies, the creator who deserves to be worshiped, all prophets who came to earth are human messangers sent by him.  Muslims don't deny christianity, judaism, Jesus or Moses. They believe in them as the noble prophets and messangers of God, love and respect them so much.  We believe the birth of Jesus (messanger of God) was a miracle from God to us, being born by a mother only and with no father. God is the creator, he can do anything.  We believe Jesus (peace be upon him) is NOT dead till today; he wasnt even murdered or crucified as most people think. God (most glorified) made the man who betrayed Jesus be killed instead by switching their looks for a moment. Jesus was left up to live in heaven until the end of days when he will come back to earth again, with no new teachings or messages but just to make justice prevail instead of oppression, fight the imposter who will claim to be God and (most important) to perform his last prayer with the Muslims announcing he's too a follower of the last prophet (Muhammad) as all people should... then he really dies like other Prophets and be buried (peace be upon them all). So we're waiting for you Jesus, Messenger of God, to bring the world peace and pray with us. Thats what prophet Muhammad told us and this is what I believe in, Im a Muslim  I know if God turned out to be unreal, I won't lose anything, because there will be no one to judge me :)  I know if any of the prophets turned out to be right in the end, I'd win because I believe in them all :)  I know if God (most glorified) was real (and he is), and Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him) existed and isn't fake (and he had), I'd win, non-Muslims won't :)  so how do we know it's true? what is said in the last message and what should we do? read the following, and you'll figure out for yourself:|`|AA10674998	One of the big obstacles to us is our emotional concepts of God. We run to God with our mind, but with our emotions we only want to bolt and flee. It makes sense when we hear Billy Graham so we make a decision while our mind is flooded with truth, but the next day we regret it because our emotions start to impact our perceptions. This is all very common.    Now I have a little list of questions that I got from "Abiding Life Ministries International" that are given to people to help them see how they feel about God when the roof is caving in, and everything is bad. This is a typical list of responses when people are at their worst:    (Beginning of ALMI hand-out) "Who is God?"  FILL IN THE BLANK___    When I think about being with God I feel _Distant._    When I have to trust God I feel _That He may not come through for me._    When I think about God I wish _That He would just talk to me, because He is silent._    Sometimes I get angry with God, because _He doesn't answer._    It frustrates me when _God wants me to do something that I can't._    I really enjoy God when _He is there._ (But this person isn't enjoying God so it tells me that they feel that God isn't there.)    The one thing that I would change about myself to please God is _Everything._    When I think about God's commandments, I feel like _a failure, and His judgment is coming._    Sometimes I wish God would _Take me home._ (suicidal people have a hard time witnessing, because they don't want to inflict others with their source of misery.)    I can really depend upon God when _I do everything right._    In my relationship with God I always feel like He is going to _Get me, reveal me, and make me pay._    The one thing that frightens me about God is _His judgment._    God surprises me when _He helps._    When I fall I feel that God is _Unhappy._    One of the things that I am afraid that God will do is _Take one of my children to get my attention._  (end of ALMI list)    I bet some of those answers are familiar to you. This list is a typical one that the ministry gets filled in, but it nearly matches what you have been telling me about yourself.    We have needs that only God can meet. These are spiritual needs that are only met in Him: security, commitment, love, stability, intimacy, safety, acceptance. We know that nobody but God can meet those needs, but at the same time we are not emotionally comfortable to trust God to meet them.    If I said I have a surprise for you, God is right outside on your front porch and He is going to spend 15 minutes with you one on one. Here is what you need to know about Him before you go outside: He is going to be distant, and unreliable, He'll give you the silent treatment and ignore your questions, He will force you to fail at doing the impossible, and wants to change everything about you, and will judge and expose you, He'll make your life miserable so that you just want it to end, He won't be happy with you unless you are perfect, He won't help, and He might kill someone you love just to make a point. Now, aren't you excited to go out and meet with Him? (smile.)    That wouldn't make you want to be with this kind of God, and I would not blame you. But, if we leave the emotional concept of God behind and concentrate on the rational facts that are revealed about God ... none of those things really describe God. So who do they describe? Satan? The flesh? Actually, in almost every case these emotional concepts about God describe one or both parents. It is your dad. It is your mom, or whoever you recognized as a child as your "authority."    If you had a critical dad, you only read what you are "NOT DOING" when you read the Bible. If your parents always lost their temper, then you are emotionally waiting for the big blow-up and angry outburst from God. If your father showed partiality, then in your calamity you feel that God might help Jimmy or Jane, but He won't help you. If you had a passive father, because he was busy or died, or maybe he was preoccupied or indifferent, then you can't imagine how any of God's promises will ever actually happen.. God's promises are as empty as dad's, right? All of this makes it impossible to look to God to be filled, so we end up looking to others, or in your case we try to change ourselves to be lovely and bring out the best in the reluctant heavenly Father.    Here is what I really think about God:  God never gives up.  God cares more for others than for self.  God doesn't want others to fail in order to highlight His success. God doesn't strut, God doesn't have a swelled head, God doesn't force himself on others, Isn't always "me first, He never flies off the handle, God won't keep score of the sins, Doesn't revel when others grovel, God takes pleasure in the flowering of truth, God puts up with anything, God always is trustworthy He always looks for the best, God never looks back, But keeps going to the end without failing or giving up.    I know this because Paul said:    Love is patient,  love is kind.  It does not envy,  it does not boast,  it is not proud.  It is not rude,  it is not self-seeking,  it is not easily angered,  it keeps no record of wrongs.  Love does not delight in evil but rejoices with the truth.  It always protects,  always trusts,  always hopes,  always perseveres.  Love never fails.(1 Cor. 13)    And GOD IS LOVE!!!!    If we wait for our emotions to catch up with reality, how long will we wait?    The reality is plain, and the fantasy that our emotions have is scary and uncertain. We have to let intellect rule reason and judge our thoughts if they be true, or emotionally derived from fictional emotional concepts.|`|si3eq11haa	hi Jo,  i read your post and you say you go to church, but you don't say anything about Jesus.   the really good thing is, you can change all this in a moment.  whatever you feel, the truth is that God Loves You. He adores you . His greatest desire is for you and Him to be friends.  the bible says that if we ask anything according to His will, we will have it.  if God wants you as His friend, and in His family (which He most certainly does) then for you to ask for that, is asking for something that He wants to happen.  there are things that separate us from God. those things are called sin, wrong doing. God is so pure and Holy that He can't tolerate sin. because He loves us so much, God made a way for us to be in His company without sin. that Way is Jesus, Gods Son.  Jesus paid the price that our sin deserved, by giving Himself in our place and paying the debt we owed. He died on the cross. when He did that, all our wrong doing, all our rottenness, was nailed to the cross with Him, and dealt with. what Jesus did, is a free gift to us. it is called salvation.   but its no good just knowing about this free gift of salvation, it doesn't become our gift until we accept it.   to accept this free gift from God, we need to accept Jesus into our hearts.  admit you have done wrong things, say sorry to God for them, thank Him for His forgiveness to you by what Jesus did for you, and ask Jesus to come and live in your heart, live in your life, and be your Lord.  give yourself to Him, offer your life to Him. let Him have your very self, the very you...  once you have done that, Jesus comes into your life, makes His home in your heart and then you begin to live a new life, a life that has Jesus as the centre. then comes the peace, and the joy, all with the knowledge that you're accepted by God, that you're secure in Him.  from this side, it all seems like just so many words, but when Jesus comes to live in your heart, a transformation takes place. supernaturally, you will see things from another perspective and it will become clear. you cannot see it now, from where you are, but when you accept Jesus as God, as your Lord, things will be different. ask Him now, peace can be yours now. just ask ...  and because you're unique, God will speak with you in a unique way, not like He does with others, but in a way that is special between you and Him. x  if you want to chat, just email me and i will happily chat with you. God Bless|`|AzdAvDW1aa	its how u r|`|KBZNraEaaa	Join the dark side|`|GPMmlhuqaa	well we all have a time in our life when we doubt our faith. thats no doubt it sure happens more than once.     maybe you dont feel he is real because some of u doesnt want too. does he have some requests that u cant fufill? like staying faithful to ur wife or lying etc? u maybe just dont want to be committed.     or maybe, you hav other stress on your mind that distracts you from ur relationship from god. prey to him that he will show u his light some how .. but do we wide awake to see it or not. cause only in the old testiment, would he appear in person.    wat may be wrong also, is that ur disappointed in him, u may asked for something lik happines or a new car but didnt recive it? you have to remember that god has his plan set out for u already, and he wont let certain blessings come in the way of that... even tho we all think nothing is wrong wit a new car!! he knows btr than us and for all we know, that certain car could get us in a car accident!!      there is many reasons to y u feel ur faith is lost, and one of them i mentioned may b one of em. keep preying that god will show u his light but do we awake and focused to c it..        dont give up though, we all have been there 916305 times!|`|Jm9eE3WJaa	Its the begining of having faith...I had the same problems...its hard to believe in something that you can't see or feel...so you just have to have faith...but ur not a bad person if you don't believe becuz i believe in God...but Christians scare me with all these rules that I just dont understand and sometimes that kinda throws you off too...but you just have to keep praying on it and it will come to you one day|`|VnNzPKA8aa	Stop being lost -- just believe in yourself.  There is no evidence to support a god of any kind and the more I study mythology, the more that I see that all myths (including the Christian one) are very similar.

You may not have faith in a god or multiple gods but if you believe in something then it doesn't matter who you pray to. There are so many religions out there that are open for everyone to practice. Going to church unfortunately doesn't solve life's problems, for some people. But it helps, if you believe that it does and of course you believe in that particular religion.     I myself do not attend church but I do believe in God. My relationship with God is my business and I do not need to attend church to solidify that.    As far as your dilemma with finding peace, there are many ways to achieve that. Such as walking in the park, listening to birds chirp or even watching the daily activities of a squirrel, reading, writing poetry, meditation, even excersing can bring about peace, etc....|`|bd0RIXZ0aa	the reson why you feel like that is because there's a spritual fight going on over your soul your spirit man which is your conceince ifghting against your flesh to do the thing's which is right and the devil don't wont  in church so he make's you feel tired something alway's come up when you trying to do the thing's that's of god play trick's with us to get us off focus on the thing's of god the reason it's so hard is because the devil gone make it hard for 1  we haft keep pressing and stop doubting that's the hinderence that the devil is using against you keep reading your bible and living your life right before the lord and you got to go to a church that teach's the word of god somewhere,where can grow in the word and in faith with god|`|kKSq5VFKaa	God does answer Prayers, I know two years ago I came down with HEP-C and my liver failed I kept my Faith strong  knowing that whatever happens God will take care of me. If God wanted me to come home or stay here on earth it is completely His choice. I went through some operations to help me God willing. And he did my last visit at the hospital, tests were done and they found no HEP-C and the doctors don't know why. But I told them it is because I pray to God and have a strong Faith knowing He will take care of me.   He did ! We will not hear Him speak to you until our demise, when our flesh body's are turned into Spiritual body's. To be absent from the body is to be spiritually with God.  Our Faith is our strength and God is with us. He will never leave us nor forsake us. He is in our hearts and our minds. stay strong and keep reading everyday.

cNniG2L0aa	There is NO purpose; there is NO plan or 'meaning' to our existence; there is NO invisible sky critter; at best we are an accident in Time and Space.   We exist for the simple reason that we exist.  We are, at best, an accidental collection of loosely combined molecules responding to our environment ... no matter how sophisticated that environment may be or we imagine it to be.  At the end of 'life' we 'disperse'; we dissipate into stardust.  We may as well have some fun while we're here without all that paranoia stuff - thinking there are invisible sky critters watching and waiting for us to screw up.  ~|`|wnI04x8Kaa	That's an age old question Primitive man did not have a scientific understanding about his environment. For them, the world must have been a very mysterious and scary place. The weather was difficult to predict. Disease struck without warning. Predators were everywhere and natural disasters abounded. Humankind strove to understand and control the world to his own ends. Eventually, after centuries of hard work and cultural development, humankind could predict the seasons, navigate by the stars, build shelters, stay warm and cook with fire, and so on. Despite these important advances, much of the world was still not understood. To bridge this gap, humankind invented explanations for the unseen causes to the mysterious things observed in the world. Over time, these explanations became anthropomorphized and they grew up to be the gods of our religions. If lightning struck with a loud thunderclap, then clearly the gods were angry. If one's child grew up strong without succumbing to disease, then the gods clearly blessed her. This perception of gods has been with humanity so long that it may be that humans have acquired an innate need to explain the unknown with the unknowable actions of a god. Regardless of the actual cause of a mystery, some god or another could be found to explain it. Atheists will recognize this rationalization as "the god of the gaps" argument, the idea that if there isn't a readily available scientific explanation, then attributing it to some god is a neat and tidy non-answer that stops the line of questioning (unless you're one of those pesky atheists).|`|IYBTmH26aa	We are here to prove ourself worthy of the coming Kingdom of God.  God intends to extend His family to human beings who are spiritually incomplete.      God wants to reproduce Himself, with His full powers and capacity, in human beings.

6GNqMJB4aa	I definitely know what you mean.  There have been some people that I don't like but other people that I knew liked the people that I did not like.  I also find myself in situations where there is usually one person that I don't like that everyone else seems to like, which makes it very uncomfortable for me, since everyone else seems to just love that person and he or she can't do any wrong in their eyes.  But I say to myself that it is just the way I feel and if someone questions me then that is what I tell them.  I simply say "There are many valid reasons why I don't like "Johnny" but I don't feel like going into a long explanation and would prefer to keep that to myself."  I'm sure that your friends will find themselves in a situation where they find someone loathsome and try to avoid.  It eventually does happen to everyone.  You can't like everyone and everyone has their own reasons for not liking another person.

GrgNm1Ofaa	Most guys will be smart enough to leave you alone if you tell them what's up.  Tell the guy on myspace/email you think it's weird that he talks to you a lot (or tries to), then tell him you don't need any comments or intrusion with what you're doing with your life.    Your first mistake was to give him your email or ask him if he could hear the drums.  This means the guy thinks you like him because you invited him into his 'life'.  Even though it's friggin lame, you gotta let him know you don't like him and let him know it's better if ya'll wouldn't send emails or myspace stuff.  Otherwise he's thinking you're playing hard to get and it will never end.  If he starts to creep you out after that, have your brother (if you have one) or a big guy friend to have a talk with the guy.    Girls biggest mistakes in these types of situations are to be polite (yes, even a little bit).  This is where b-tch mode kicks in, have fun.|`|6YJDYOdUaa	Wow...be careful, truly.

Be extra careful about what you post in your facebook...change accounts...it's obvious he's reading it. Don't respond to his emails anymore, & save the ones you have, yours & his, just in case.  Have friends over often, vary your routines, if you don't have a boyfriend then ask a trusted male friend to help you out by playing the part (preferably a really big dude).

When I am in great physical pain I scream at him but I don't stop loving him in spite if the fact I suffer. Be angry and sin not the bible says.    So just dig in and keep at him. That's why he said be faithful unto death and I will give you a crown of life.|`|hQDapmICaa	your heart is NOT right with God. stop using **** words. Read the Bible.

W0rcm3awaa	The reason why life is happier isnot because we 'block out the negatives' remember in buddhism we try not to delude ourselves and often try to dissuade the delusions in life.    I cannot remember the origin but i remember a quote, "We see the world as we are." And this is true, looking through your eyes we may see that halloween is a wonderful time while looking throug another its terrifying. The idea in buddhism is to take away these labels, we create them. The idea is that we take them as they are and instead of 'blocking it out' we break it down and understand it then are able to move past it.    I'm sure some enjoy being a better person but the reason why we're generally happy is based off of the eight-fold path and an end to suffering. Most people put unrealistic expectations on external objects (cars, significant others, clothing) in hopes that it will make them happy. Often it doesn't or it does but only briefly. In buddhism we look for the ultimate happiness, the one we already have inside of us because how we see the world is up to us.    Hopefully this makes sense to you, i apologize if i rambled too much. I'm not aware of every buddhist whose achieved in enlightenment but many have, some are still living.|`|473ccf4ea2cfb964f9c69e3f165455e3aa	It's all about letting go.  Things don't get better, you simply learn how to accept what is, and release your conception of positive and negative.     I don't know about enlightenment, I've never met anyone who has attained it.|`|f9d5978875fa5fe524d24fd2891438bdaa	You can save money too by blocking out hunger. :)|`|dqZrq7Zeaa	I like some aspects of Buddhism very much and I try to apply them... such as being DETACHED from possessions and outcomes.  And I meditate. very calming|`|E3v6Ctffaa	Buddha means ( He who awoke to reality ) or his a part of it ,   The awaken one    What Buddha achieve is the liberation of Kamma , of oneself Illusion of Duality ( Subject - Object ) Ego.  Then he achieve a permanent state that is called ( Nibbana ) ( Nirvana) The only permanent state because it is outside the law of kamma ( Or before would be a better term )  I cannot describe Nirvana or Reality since it is outside or without conceptual thoughts    Buddhism is the science of reality   It is reality describe in concepts for us to understand by a Awaken being ( Buddha )    You must not block thoughts , you will create the illusion that there is a controller , you must simply let go , observe you emotions , thoughts with a empty critique mind (conceptual perceptions) and let them go    To achieve Awakening you must be very committed , (Siddhartha)Buddha said you must work for your own salvation day and night without loosing any moment. No one achieved awakening since Siddhartha Gautama ( On earth that we know of )|`|RRJFI9Oqaa	Life becomes very simple if we can block both positive and negative thinkings.

p8Mc6rpBaa	Honestly if a man feels like I feel he could care less about how a women's hair is during sex. In fact I like my women's hair a little messy and wild. Nothing worse than a woman that puts stipulations on the sex because she cares more about her hair at that moment. However most men understand and will compromise. So hair wraps and scarves are tolerable. Also you can try to have sex with your hair down the night or morning before you get your hair done. Remember this is a man's point of view and as a man I know how some of my sisters are about their hair.       P.S. You know you wouldn't have to worry about sweating the temporary (OOPS!!) I mean term and relaxer out of your hair if you would go natural. But that's the answer to another question...LOL!!!|`|cdc5c7dd0d41e9074d692c3b95fb21abaa	Lol... great question. I don't know much about the sex & hair messed up aspect (I'm curious as well for future references). But I work out a lot and my hair is natural so it's hard to keep it up for long. I've found that if I regularly get my hair done at least every 2 weeks at the salon (every week if you can afford it), then it holds up more after I've sweated for a couple of hours. But the longer I go w/o having my hair done, the easier it is to get messy and unmanageable. So I'd say, make the Salon your BFF at will, and keep the covers off. Tell him to open a window or turn the AC up a little beforehand, lol. The more air circulation in the room the better. That's my opinion....    And what are you talking about O-Gun in your P.S. ??? lol
58845e4f2306ab8fa4166a538dfcddc8aa	That would depend of your age and the type of relationship you have.  Generally speaking though, the answer is "no."  Even if you have been intimate, or for that matter, even if you were married, most women would prefer something that doesn't suggest that the only thing you have on your mind is sex.  Most women want romance not overt suggestions that you want sex.|`|GL5MOqDKaa	no|`|eZ59v90Zaa	no way im a girl i know girls like chocolates and roses or special thing from the boy to that special girl|`|GPMmlhuqaa	depends if you have that type of relationship.       if u two think its sexy than she might like it yes. other girls might take it offensive as if ur calling them a slut.     all depends on the girl and relationship|`|fyXCunCSaa	Would I, Yes!  but, if you have to ask the question, then the answer is probably no. its not worth the risk of offending her.|`|ND1nFEWSaa	yes if;    you have been together for at least 6 months  you have been intimate  she will not open it in front of her parents (assuming she lives with them, you have to be considerate here...)|`|KVAh5xxSaa	No, that would totally send off the wrong message! Unless you and your girl have an inside joke about lingerie or something. Maybe if you're in an intimate relationship, that depends. Good luck! =D
iNFE3utOaa	Ask people your age that look like they would. The clothes they wear is usually a good way to tell who does and who doesnt. Either that or roll through the hood and get some on the corner, you'll most likely get crap though, not high quality stuff, plus sometimes they put raid on it. I knew a girl who got shot in the chest during a robbery when she tried getting it in the hood though, but I guess it depends on how street smart you are.

Is there any specific reason for that as per them?     There is no rule as such. But sometimes it out of personal indifference, more than law that these guys behave like that. Do you stay there  on rent or do you own the place. You have more authority to speak if you own it. And tuition is not a commercial business, if its not a large group of students who come there. So just try to solve it peacefully|`|L5S6rpI7aa	The society persons have no right to prevent your visitors , I guess it is ownership flat and you are also a member of the society and subscribes. The matter may be sorted out in your society meeting. Use of lift can't be conditional that your visitors would not be allowed to use.  If the society people prevent usage of the lift by your visitors(students) it tantamounts encroachment to your right.|`|d3eab5726a0f9f49c756fdcdee1a6bc5aa	Is the lift all the time very crowded ? No member of the society can object friends & visitors coming to see someone. Next time they will ask you to make number of friends according to them. Afterwards they will put the condition that you purchase food grains & other eatables according to their personal choice. Is this freedom or logic ? Students are innocent, immature children & harmless children, not criminals. As far as your wife's personal hobbies, social service or any other activity at home is her personal matter. None has any right to interfere in them.

uO7Yd0Vgaa	I looked for this and found only the one source that you did. Then I searched in German with plausible translations of partial phrases ("ber Hecken", "ber Steinen", "das wilde Pferd" and so forth) both with and without Bismarck. There's a tasty second volume of a Bismarck biography at the website I mention below, but it was printed in Fraktur, the usual typographical style of 1890, so reading it is a bit slow.    You could try posing your question to the reference desk at your favorite big-city or college library. They absolutely love to work on that kind of question.    I wish I had more time to work on this, but it's almost 4 in the morning, and I'd better get to sleep so I can get up and feed the horses. My next step would be to try searching in Spanish, French, Italian, Dutch, Danish and Russian, in about that order. But I won't. --Snezzzzzzzzy.

tEsIu7FIaa	This may help:    ' criollos (Spanish-born Americans) and mestizos (mixed Spanish and Indian settlers) pushed past the Rio Grande River to take advantage of land grants in the kingdom of New Mexico, which included most of the western states.    They were called caballeros, says Donald Gilbert Y Chavez, a historian of the cowboy's Spanish origins.    "One of the highest stations you could have in life was to be a caballero," said Chavez, a resident of New Mexico whose lineage can be traced to the Don Juan de O?ate colony, the caballero who was among the first cowboys in the U.S.    "Even the poor Mexican vaqueros were very proud and there were few things they couldn't do from a saddle."    Caballero is literally translated as "gentleman." The root of the word comes from caballoSpanish for "horse." For every caballero there were perhaps dozens of independentsthe true "drivers" of cattle: vaqueros.    "All of the skills, traditions, and ways of working with cattle are very much rooted in the Mexican vaquero," Nelson told National Geographic News. "If you are a cowboy in the U.S. today, you have developed what you know from the vaquero." '

WEXawoASaa	My parents used to say that to me when I was little! "Hey" is actually slang for "Hello." This phrase originated, and turned into a popular saying to remind kids to use the proper english, and not slang! Basically "Don't say 'Hey' because its improper English." Since horses eat hey, then "Hey is for horses."  The "and the grass is cheaper" of it is further showing how "hey is for horses" by drawing a grass/hey comparrison)|`|Cx9ZQmZDaa	its like saying dont just tell them "hey"...i think it means more, like address them proper...tell them "hello" and ask them "how are you doing?"  but it could also be a joke...probably depending on the age of the person who says it. lol|`|5O3JD29iaa	I was brought up with when I said "Hey" my mom would always say "Hey, is for horses" So I'm guessing it's just a freedom of speech and people just like to say it for the heck of it.

Just giving you my opinion.|`|i738zS9taa	Yeah, it's a bit rude.  You could use it to your friends, but they might get slightly annoyed. (I would) It's like, they just want to be friendly and say "hey" but you make fun of it. It's annoying.     I've only heard people use "hay is for horses" without the part about grass. Basically, they're taking what you said and twisting it up and think they're funny. Some people might laugh. Some might get mad.    It's not slang, really, just colloquial. And annoying. My advice --> do not use!

If you think your girl would like it, I love when my boyfriend gives me massages, so you could always go to bath and body works and get some massage oil, I love the smell of it.

NO|`|jKJ2rdmJaa	Well, first of all, if you are not true to yourself by being yourself and you are allowing others to control your behaviors and thought patterns then you are just putting yourself down and out. I was made fun in school; however, I chose not to let what others say get in the way of being myself. I too like gymnastics and was in gymnastics at one time to increase my flexibility for other sports and martial arts. Another reason I was in gymnastics was to build core strength to help build muscle mass and stabilizer muscles. Now back to the subject at hand, I would say your self esteem needs a good boosting. I have a good example for you that I used in class one day because I too was sick of the bs. Now if an unusual person or thing is put into a so called normal state group or thing the unusual person or thing is rejected "made fun of". Now if the unusual person or thing say look i am staying right here whether you like it or not than the so called normal group or thing has to change or mutate in some way in order to stay that so called normal. It makes you think about what you say and do to others because of your own sense of what is normal.  I suppose you can bring it back to an old saying don't judge a book by its cover, but I like to expand a thought rather than keep it simple.  I would have to say screw what others think of you. Be you and strive for excellence in all that you do and follow your heart eventually people will come around and see you for who you are and not judge you.
EYqTV2EYaa	I would live during the era of the dinosaurs because then, I'd be free from taboos. I'd run around naked all day as I try not get squashed or eaten by dinosaurs. That would be so fun. lol. Seriously though, I disagree with living in the 60's because of all the racial tension, but rather the 90's. See, in the 60's, if it's before 1965, I wouldn't be able to date people of different races, even though races doesn't matter. It's just that, personally, I'd date any guy I like. Also, I wouldn't really be considered human. Even after the Jim Crow laws, the environment may still be harsh towards Blacks, so still, I prefer to stay out the 60's. lol. 90's it is! I remember, I was younger then and all the good things came on TV such as the Nicktoons, ECW. I loved the music. Then, if I go back, I'd be able to enjoy it in this smart and sociable mindset rather than the dyslexic one I had that time. Nonetheless, even in the 90's, I'd run around nude.

It is a fear from watching both parties consistently undermine our liberties, and watching American citizens surrender them in the interest of security, or their own agendas.  Look out for anyone who pledges allegiance to "hate crime" legislation.

I believe the greeks translated the original Hebrew scripts to be written in a bible. One thing they did which is not proper is changed the "real name" of our Messiahh called Jesus  named after the Greek god zues by them but His real name is Yahshua.

Paul may have written the most books out of any other author, but he's still only one of over forty, and out of the sixty-six to eighty books accepted by Christians, he wrote only thirteen (fourteen if you count Hebrews).    Why did they write it?  There were many different reasons.  Some wrote to record history, some wrote to work out their own salvation, some sought to encourage other churches, and others just wrote what they had learned (Ecclesiastes and Proverbs both fall under this category).    I don't believe the Bible was written by power-hungry people, because most of them were humble and peaceful (except perhaps Moses, but no one's perfect).  Has the Bible been used for control?  Absolutely.  But I don't think it was intended that way.|`|7d49ddbf3b36edeb5a77c20235621a44aa	the bible is not a book but a tome ,a series of several books .Many have contributed and the sources are not always known as the original scriptures were lost long before the bible was compiled.the reasons are speculative and sometimes complex.|`|I3uOGMBUaa	Actually the Bible was written by 40 different men and was written a little over 1,000 yrs. It is the inspired word of God or as a letter from God. "Bible" means "little books" because it is made up of several little books combined. A good illustration to use to explain this is think of how a boss of a company relays a message or letter through his secretary. Are the thoughts the secretary's or the bosses?? Who's name is signed at the bottom?? The secretaries or the bosses?? It is the same with the Bible, the 40 different men that wrote the Bible were assistants or aids to God in writing the Bible but the instruction comes from God. The reason why many men where used was cuz think if one man where to write it he would have lived one lifestyle or occupation and to see one perspective. So by having many people write it from different aspects and experiences you get lots of perspective and flavor. If anyone higher like the angels would have wrote it their lifestyle is not even on the earth so it would not even work as a manual to human life since they wouldn't even have experienced living on the earth....|`|8PjHFUdfaa	The answer is neither simple nor straightforward--just the way we at the Straight Dope like it. But this subject is complicated even for us. Rather than try to pack the answer into one article, weve decided to split it into sections and give a detailed account, to be presented over several days.     Part 1 - Who wrote/compiled/edited (and when) the first five books of the Bible, called the Torah or Pentateuch or Five Books of Moses?    Part 2 - Who wrote/compiled/edited (and when) the various histories in the Old Testament (such as Judges, Kings, etc.)? (This section will also include a brief essay on the problems inherent in dating ancient events.)    Part 3 - Who wrote/compiled/edited (and when) the various prophetic books (Isaiah, Jeremiah, etc.) and the wisdom literature (Psalms, Proverbs, etc.) in the Old Testament?    Part 4 - Who wrote/compiled/edited (and when) the various New Testament Books?    Part 5 - Who decided which books should be included and which excluded from the Bible(s)? Why are there differences in the Bibles for Catholics, Protestants, and Jews?    The work of many hands    The answer to Who wrote the Bible? turns out to be complex. For a start, the Bible isnt a single book, but contains 66 separate books which were collected over something like 1,200 years. Christians and Jews have usually been careful to say that the scriptures werent delivered from a passing cloud, but were, they believe, written, edited and compiled by human beings under the inspiration of God.    The real Question is what Powers and principalities have manipulated the Bible for their own purposes to our collective detriment and their profit.|`|4bWUiIVdaa	Someone who loved being unrealistic|`|AA11564934	dozens of people.

Satanists and many pagan cultures from every corner of the world all throughout history have celebrated this like the Sumerians, Babylonians, Cherokee, Hopi, Chinese I-Ching (confirmed by Terence McKenna), Mayans (Pacal Votan; Chilam Balam of Tizimin, Mani, Chumayel; Jaguar Prophet), Egyptians, Celts, etc. This evil event is called "the abomination that causes desolation" that will be set up in the Jewish Temple's Holy of Holies when the antichrist is imbued with the spirit of satan himself. When will Jesus come? Only God Himself knows exactly, but very soon in "the twinkling of an eye" and like "a thief in the night".

269rOoUUaa	The Banshee (IPA: /?b?n?i?/), from the Irish bean s ("woman of the sde" or "woman of the fairy mounds") is a female spirit in Irish mythology, usually seen as an omen of death and a messenger from the Otherworld. Her Scottish counterpart is the bean shth (also spelled bean-shdh).    The aos s ("people of the mounds", "people of peace") are variously believed to be the survivals of pre-Christian Gaelic deities, spirits of nature, or the ancestors. Some Theosophists and Celtic Christians have also referred to the aos s as "fallen angels". They are commonly referred to in English as "fairies", and the banshee can also be described as a "fairy woman".    The term banshee is an anglicization of the Irish bean sdhe or bean s, or the Scots Gaelic bean shth, - both meaning "woman of the fairy mounds" or "woman of peace". Both names are derived from the Old Irish ben sdhe: bean: "woman", and sdhe: "of the mounds". Some consider the bean nighe ("washer-woman") the Scottish counterpart of the Irish banshee. However, bean shth is the linguistic and mythological equivalent, appearing in a number of different roles and situations in folklore and mythology. The bean nighe is a specific type of bean shth.[1] In Scottish Gaelic, bean shth can also be spelled bean-shdh. Sd in Irish, and Sth in Scots Gaelic, also mean "peace", and the fairies are also referred to as "the people of peace" - Aos S or Daoine-Sth.    In Irish legend, a banshee wails around a house if someone in the house is about to die. There are particular families who are believed to have banshees attached to them, and whose cries herald the death of a member of that family. Traditionally, when a citizen of an Irish village died, a woman would sing a lament (in Irish: caoineadh, [?ki?n??] or [?ki?n?u?], "caoin" meaning "to weep, to wail") at their funeral. These women singers are sometimes referred to as "keeners" and the best keeners would be in much demand. Legend has it that, for five great Gaelic families: the O'Gradys, the O'Neills, the O'Briens, the O'Connors, and the Kavanaghs, the lament would be sung by a fairy woman; having foresight, she would sing the lament when a family member died, even if the person had died far away and news of their death had not yet come, so that the wailing of the banshee was the first warning the household had of the death.    In later versions the banshee might appear before the death and warn the family by wailing. When several banshees appeared at once, it indicated the death of someone great or holy.[2] The tales sometimes recounted that the woman, though called a fairy, was a ghost, often of a specific murdered woman, or a woman who died in childbirth.[3]    Banshees are frequently described as dressed in white or grey, and often having long, fair hair which they brush with a silver comb, a detail scholar Patricia Lysaght attributes to confusion with local mermaid myths. This comb detail is also related to the centuries-old traditional romantic Irish story that, if you ever see a comb lying on the ground in Ireland, you must never pick it up, or the banshees (or mermaids - stories vary), having placed it there to lure unsuspecting humans, will spirit such gullible humans away. Other stories portray banshees as dressed in green, red or black with a grey cloak.    They are common in Irish and Scottish folk stories such as those recorded by Irish-American writer Herminie T. Kavanagh. They enjoy the same mythical status in Ireland as fairies and leprechauns. Banshees continue to appear in modern fiction that deals with mythology, folklore or the supernatural.|`|90MwwrSeaa	Banshees don't attack or infect people.

T1beLIQqaa	Rebuilding of the Wailing Wall-the Israelis have cleared the area and are bringing in materials. Mark of the beast-possibly an implanted computer chip or laser readable permanent mark on the skin, or retinal scan. Also, a false sense of Peace. God will punish the city on the hill(that's Israel)  and she will be brought to her knees for her indiscretions-this can only be the Palestinian situation. Nation upon nation shall rise up against her, but God shall protect her and punish these nations. A NEW Jerusalem shall arise out of all this.    EDIT: If you believe in prophecies, St. Malachi accurately predicted every Pope up to the present, and one more that will usher in the Anti Christ- my guesstimate is this pope will live another 1-2 years. Before the Anti Christ, the Papacy will fall(big schism already exists). We are living in the Third Prophecy of Fatima(two proved accurate and were fulfilled). We will go through extreme heat and pestilence-possibly the cobalt bomb(thought only to be on the drawing board) of which the Russians  may have developed. This bomb would cause a chain reaction in the atmosphere, producing intense burning, more so than radiation effects. China is the only country on earth, that can single handedly raise the army described in the Bible. Gog and Magog are considered to be in present day Russia.Nostradamus predicted Moab, whom many think to be Muslim, would usher in a false peace-note similiarities to President Obama's name(Nostradamus spelled Hitler as Hister)-Obama's father was Black Muslim, he attended a Muslim school, and he is often toted as the World Uniter.We should watch the next 3-4  years very closely.|`|EAuMJrs4aa	this one here    http://www.pellepelster.de/serendipity/u...    sorry but the first guy is right there are many many gods many of which actualy predate your one god    do you mean the most long lasting prevailing of all zeus or do you mean odin hmmm?|`|AA11992885	world peace?  an end to all illnesses?  an end to death?    technically, no text says that no one will die again, it says death will be swallowed up.....what exactly does that mean?  all too many people ASSUME that it means death will stop, but that is NOT what it says|`|dl97DmmYaa	The appearance of the beast with number 666 on his forehead, the anti-christ.|`|5eSJpYbMaa	Have ANY of God's signs been fulfilled yet?|`|CODYtcwkaa	Nation will not lift up sword against nation, and neither will study war any more.|`|zUMvC6QEaa	God is going to leave a sign where The Virgin Mary first appeared in Medjugorje in 1981.

The salvation and the glory and the power belong to our God, 2?because his judgments are true and righteous. For he has executed judgment upon the great harlot who corrupted the earth with her fornication, and he has avenged the blood of his slaves at her hand. 3?And right away for the second time they said: Praise Jah, YOU people! And the smoke from her goes on ascending forever and ever.    4?And the twenty-four elders and the four living creatures fell down and worshiped God seated upon the throne, and said: Amen! Praise Jah, YOU people!    5?Also, a voice issued forth from the throne and said: Be praising our God, all YOU his slaves, who fear him, the small ones and the great.    6?And I heard what was as a voice of a great crowd and as a sound of many waters and as a sound of heavy thunders.

10c1407ad3b148843d1e616e9a4c6215aa	"J'ai visit Quebec"    The "pass comps" is the past tense used when something is completely done, and is called the Perfect tense in English.   It is in two parts, so to help you, think "I have eaten" " I have seen" "I have  drunk", rather than " I ate" "I saw""I drank" when you convert them into French.  "I have visited Quebec" rather than "I visited Quebec"     For most verbs the first part is the present of the verb "avoir" added to the past participle of the verb that you need, so:  -er  verbs   J'ai aim le film  J'ai mang la pomme.  - ir verbs   Tu as fini tes devoirs  Tu as choisi un chocolat   -re verbs  Il a vendu sa voiture  Elle a perdu sa clef    Some verbs have an irregular past participle like prendre, faire, mettre.  Nous avons pris le train  Vous avez fait vos devoirs  Ils ont mis les assiettes sur la table.     Some verbs (mostly of movement) do not form their perfect with "avoir" but with "tre".  In that case the past participle agrees with the subject  Pierre est parti. Marie est partie  Ils sont partis  Elles sont parties    Use "tre" with the following verbs.   (To remember them, learn the first letter of each word:   MRS VAN DER TRAMP)     monter - to go up - mont(e)(s)   rester - to stay - rest(e)(s)   sortir - to leave - sorti(e)(s)   venir - to come - venu(e)(s)   aller - to go - all(e)(s)   na?tre - to be born - n(e)(s)   descendre - to go down - descendu(e)(s)   entrer - to enter / go in - entr(e)(s)   rester - to stay - rest(e)(s)  tomber - to fall - tomb(e)(s)   retourner - to return - retourn(e)(s)   arriver - to arrive - arriv(e)(s)   mourir - to die - mort(e)(s)   partir - to leave - parti(e)(s)   The mnenomic MRS VAN DER TRAMP will help you remember!   Examples:   je suis parti (here masculine) = I left   il est all = he went   elle est arrive = she arrived   Es-tu entr? = Did you go in?   Ils sont retourns = They returned   Je suis alle (here feminine) = I went     This also applies to reflexive verbs (when you do things like  getting up, washing  yourself, dressing,  going to bed, etc...)  Je me suis lev (here masculine)  Elle s'est lave (here feminine)  Ils se sont habills (masculine plural)   Elles se sont  couches (feminine plural)  BUT there is NO feminine or plural agreement when that kind of verb is followed by a direct object.   For instance:  Amlie washed her hair=  Amlie s'est lav les cheveux   Peter and Henry  brushed their teeth= Pierre et Henri  se sont bross  les dents    I have tried to make things as clear as possible for you.    PS> I see that because I went into more detail, two other posts have appeared before mine. "Goddess" is wrong about reflexives with a direct object.  "She washed her face" should be "Elle s'est lav la figure" and NOT "Elle s'est lave la figure". Also, it should be "Nous avons discut ensemble"( no "s" after ensemble), and "Ils ont mang le gateau" in the second paragraph.    2PS>I have just seen your added comment.  You only add an accent to the past participle of -er  verbs after knocking off the -r at the end :  manger=mang  chanter= chant  (The accent effectively replaces the -r to give the right sound  when you say it)  For -ir  verbs  you just knock off the r at the end  finir= fini  mentir= menti  For -re verbs  you knock of the -re and replace it with a "u"  perdre= perdu  attendre= attendu|`|AA10982716	Yes pass compos is just the past tense. The "compos" part just means that there are two words (avoir or tre and the past participle).    J'ai visit Qubec.  Tu as vendu ta voiture.  Elle a manqu son train.  Nous avons discut ensembles.  Ils ont mang le gateau.    It's not clear if you've learned about the tre verbs:  Use "tre" if there's movement involved (the Vandertramp verbs or whatever they're called) or for reflexives. Then the participle must agree in gender and number with the subject. *add an e if it's feminine, add an s if it's plural. This doesn't change the pronunciation.    (Note: I'm a girl and I'm calling you a boy.)    Je suis alle au restaurant.  Tu es venu trop tard.  Il est mont l'escalier.  Elle s'est lav la figure.  [corrected--thanks Wise Owl!]  Nous sommes partis en vacances.|`|MEm1vNMjaa	Hey there!  First of all, Je visite Quebec is not in pass compos, it's like present tense...  Pass Compos is basically French's simple past tense  Like,  I visited Quebec ---> J'ai visit Quebec  You ate an apple --> Tu as mang une pomme  He came here --> Il est venu ici  She did something --> Elle a fait quelque chose  They slept --> Ils ont dormi    It's different from 'Imparfait'  I was sleeping would be Je dormais...    You can look at the source for a better explanation.  I hope that helped :)

Besides, Islam itself has nothing to do with Judaism or Christianity. It's just that Islam wants to be associated with them to make it look original.|`|mc9pPxsnaa	Definitely they are teaming up in spreading bigotry and hating/killing each other......|`|UmdKqP5kaa	ISLAM ALREADY TEAMS UP WITH ALL RELIGIONS, IF ONLY YOU UNDERSTAND!  Ok, we know we don't create each other and we don't come to this world from nowhere because when we die we must be going somewhere as well, hence there must be God, if there were many Gods, they would have fought over what to be created and what not to be, probably over who to die and who to live at the same time... so it's gotta be one God... if that God created us then there must be a reason... could we figure it out on our own? God made it easy and sent us messengers and prophets to show us the way and tell us why... so all the messengers and all the religions are from the same only God, so they've got to be complementary to each other, not opposing each other!!! then God must have said His final words in the last message, what is the last message? and how do we know it's the last one? I guess that would be the religion that believes in all messengers and all books equally... is there such religion? actually yes, Islam does :)  A True Muslim (man or woman) gets his reward for obeying Allah's orders (Allah means The God in Arabic) by going to heaven, where he/she are indulged forever in all the good things that were on earth and more, things no one ever dreamt of or heard about. The Holy Quran tells Muslims (men and women) there will be good food, good wine and sex in heaven for all, but not in the bestial way you may think of, but rather in a way that is satisfactory for everyone and better than what was on earth. Heaven is no heartbreak or injustice land.  True Muslims are no terrorists, and Islam never calls for that, Islam means peace, it bans violence unless you were fought so you fight back, it only doesn't require Muslims to be cowards, and true Muslims understand this very well and never attack civilians.   Islam is the only religion that accepts freedom of religion and asks men to treat women gently like queens.   It's all in the Holy Quran and the right teachings of prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him).  If some people behave otherwise, then it's because people behaviour doesn't necessarily reflect the rulings of their religion always, for example, we can't (and don't) judge Christianity by Hitler or Madonna.  And that is another reason why there is heaven and hell after we die, heaven for the obedient and hell for the disobedient and/or oppressor, it's all going to be decided on the day of resurrection and judgement.  To be a Muslim, you must believe God is only one with no spouses or offspring, believe in his angels (servants not males or females), believe in all his religions, messangers and books equally, the day of judgement, heaven and hell and that everything is in God's hands and because of his will (good or bad).  Muslims believe God is the only divine who never dies, the creator who deserves to be worshiped, all prophets who came to earth are human messangers sent by him.  Muslims don't deny christianity, judaism, Jesus or Moses. They believe in them as the noble prophets and messangers of God, love and respect them so much.  We believe the birth of Jesus (messanger of God) was a miracle from God to us, being born by a mother only and with no father. God is the creator, he can do anything.  We believe Jesus (peace be upon him) is NOT dead till today; he wasnt even murdered or crucified as most people think. God (most glorified) made the man who betrayed Jesus be killed instead by switching their looks for a moment. Jesus was left up to live in heaven until the end of days when he will come back to earth again, with no new teachings or messages but just to make justice prevail instead of oppression, fight the imposter who will claim to be God and (most important) to perform his last prayer with the Muslims announcing he's too a follower of the last prophet (Muhammad) as all people should... then he really dies like other Prophets and be buried (peace be upon them all). So we're waiting for you Jesus, Messenger of God, to bring the world peace and pray with us. Thats what prophet Muhammad told us and this is what I believe in, Im a Muslim  so how do we know it's true? what is said in the last message and what should we do? read the following, and you'll figure out for yourself:|`|uzczwVT1aa	Salam. Well, Jews don't believe that Jesus ASWS was a prophet while we do, but we do respect Jews as People of the Book and Judaism is a very peaceful religion.

ebe3c2b26459019c836fe0d5e547a974aa	First off these are two very different issues that you are discussing and so I will address each separately.      In regard to unified prayer or responsive readings where the pastor or someone does a reading and there is a unified response from the congregation:    Reading in unison is awkward in its own right, especially with lots of people. You always have the one speaking too fast, or one jumbling words because they are trying to stay in rhythm.  The fact is that most people don't like reading out loud......period.  Unified or solo, people just don't want to be standing up and talking loud enough that others hear them.  I think this awkwardness is just a matter of public speaking anxieties that most people face.      In regard to speaking in tongues:   I have a lot of opinionated beliefs about this topic and mostly due to what the apostle Paul writes in 1 Corinthians ch. 14.  I will post a section of it directly below.    22Tongues, then, are a sign, not for believers but for unbelievers; prophecy, however, is for believers, not for unbelievers. 23So if the whole church comes together and everyone speaks in tongues, and some who do not understand[g] or some unbelievers come in, will they not say that you are out of your mind? 24But if an unbeliever or someone who does not understand[h]comes in while everybody is prophesying, he will be convinced by all that he is a sinner and will be judged by all, 25and the secrets of his heart will be laid bare. So he will fall down and worship God, exclaiming, "God is really among you!"    Because I strongly agree with Paul on this matter I have been strongly agitated at a couple churches that I visited where people were speaking in tongues.  I felt that the things I saw occuring were in direct violation of Paul's teachings about the matter.  Here these people were speaking in "tongues" with a lot of jibberish and no one there to interpret anything.  Paul basically says that if an unbeliever walks in while everyone is speaking  in tongues the unbeliever will think they have lost their minds.  I couldn't agree more.  But if an unbeliever walks in while someone is prophesying and interpreting he will receive some edification.  Paul also says he would rather speak 5 intelligible words than 10000 words in a tongue.  AMEN.  I think the main reason that you feel awkward about people speaking in tongues at church is because IT IS AWKWARD!  And in my opinion it's not only awkward and unfruitful but also displeasing to God when there is no interpreter that can let the blessings of God be known to everyone beside the babbling bafoon.|`|AA11564934	all religions are cults basically.  Some more dangerous than others|`|AA11923447	No. I respect the various ways in which people choose to worship.

XD    Actually, my church is starting to move away from speaking in tongues because they were losing so many people because of it, so maybe it's going to be a short-lived religion ...|`|ZtEVlc0yaa	I don't like throwing the cult label on anyone.   But that's just me.     If it works for them, super. :]|`|4fTiCNiKaa	The Bible teaches us that there are two types of "tongues". One, is for the Believers edification. It is commonly called their "prayer language". It is when the Christian allows the Holy Spirit to pray through them. This is necessary at times because the Bible teaches us that there are some things the Christian does not know how, or what to pray for. And, this also allows the Christian to worship God when their own natural language is insufficient. This "prayer language" is given to the Believer when he or she receives the infilling of the Holy Ghost.     The baptism in the Holy Spirit is the empowering for service that takes place in the life of the Christian.    The Baptism in the Holy Spirit is a Second encounter with God. The first encounter with God is called as 'conversion' or salvation. Just as the indwelling Spirit reproduces the life of Jesus, the outpoured, or baptizing Spirit reproduces the ministry of Jesus.    To illustrate, if I had a glass of water and took a swallow, then the water would be inside me. If, on the other hand, I went down to the beach and stepped into the ocean, then I would be in the water. We receive, as it were, a drink of the Spirit when we are saved, but when we are baptized in the Spirit, it is as if that initial drink becomes an ocean that completely surrounds us.    The Baptism in the Holy Spirit is a definite experience, not identical with conversion. When the Baptism in the Holy Spirit is received, unknown tongues will follow. The Baptism in the Holy Spirit is given to endue the believer with power from on high; to give and to equip him for a practical, efficient, spirit-filled, soul-winning ministry and service. Inasmuch as this is the dispensation of the Holy Spirit, every believer has a right to expect His incoming to be after the same manner as recorded by the Word of God in Bible days.  Luke 24:49; John 14:16; Acts 1:8; 2:4, 38-39; 10:44 -48, 19:6     Do not think that I am saying you have to speak in tongues to be saved. I am not. The work of the Lord Jesus Christ and the mercy of God bring salvation and the indwelling Spirit, and that does not involve speaking in tongues. Speaking in tongues, from all indications in the New Testament, is the consequence of the baptism in the Holy Spirit. There was an initial utterance in tongues, bearing witness that the tongue had been sanctified and empowered by God for His use. But speaking in tongues was not necessary for the salvation of those people.    Praying in tongues builds your faith. "But ye, beloved, building up yourselves on your most holy faith, praying in the Holy Ghost" (Jude 20). Some think you have to be "spiritually up" and anointed to pray in tongues, but praying in the Spirit builds our faith. If you need victory, pray in tongues.     Praying in your prayer language brings you spiritual rest. "For with stammering lips and another tongue will he speak to this people. To whom he said, This is the rest wherewith ye may cause the weary to rest; and this is the refreshing . . . ." (Isaiah 28:11,12). When we are tired or upset we can pray in tongues and receive supernatural rest from God.    Praying in the Holy Spirit can help us better understand the truth of Gods Word and His guidance. "Howbeit when he, the Spirit of truth, is come, he will guide you into all truth: for he shall not speak of himself; but whatsoever he shall hear, that shall he speak: and he will show you things to come" (John 16:13).     Praying in the Spirit helps us in that circumstance. "Likewise the Spirit also helpeth our infirmities: for we know not what we should pray for as we ought: but the Spirit itself maketh intercession for us with groanings which cannot be uttered" (Romans 8:26). 1 Corinthians 14:2 says, "For no man understandeth him; howbeit in the spirit he speaketh mysteries."    Praying in the prayer language gives us a "direct line" to God. "For he that speaketh in an unknown tongue speaketh not unto men, but unto God" (1 Corinthians 14:2.) God the Holy Spirit can talk to God the Father in ways we cannot. "For he that speaketh in an unknown tongue speaketh not unto men, but unto God" (1 Corinthians 14:2.) God the Holy Spirit can talk to God the Father in ways we cannot.     Praying in the Spirit acclimates us to the realm of the Gifts of the Spirit. I believe it is a stepping stone to the other gifts. For these reasons you can see that speaking in tongues is much more than just a sign of the Holy Spirits Baptism.    The second type of "tongues" taught in Scripture is called the "gift of tongues" This is when a Christian speaks a message in tongues that is designed by God to operate in tandem with another spiritual gift from God called the "gift of interpretation". These two gifts allows work in tandem, and are always for the church body. Together these gifts deliver a message from the Lord to His church is a supernatural way. This message is always to be judged by the word of God to see if it lines up with the Scriptures. If it does not, then the Bible teaches us it is to be rejected. Usually this happens when a young Christian becomes zealous for the gifts to operate in them, and will give what they "feel" to be a message from God. If it does line up to the Bible, then it is to be received as such.  1 Cor. 12:7-11, 31, 1 Cor. 14    Hope this helps.    Elder Greg  (((SFECU)))  pray4revival|`|Fd1WHPQ2aa	There are thousands of churches that don't practice these things. Why not find one of these where you can feel at home?  The apostle Paul once proclaimed that he spoke in tongues as well as most of the early believers in Jesus. Even though this can be a powerful tool in ones spiritual walk, I think that our spiritual life and our worship of God is something that should develop in a group of believers that you feel comfortable with and trust.

With only a little searching, you can find a website that really goes into the poem, in depth.  However, when I was in school, I always found the best resources to be the University Library, because they have Literary Criticism and Analysis books there that aren't available anywhere else, and when you source them in your paper, teachers practically wet themselves with excitement.

Wicca, Witchcraft, Satanism, Hinduism, Kabala, who knows, whatever they think makes them look cooler is what they believe in. They usually like dragons or other fantasy things which are not real and as far as culture, they spend most of their time leaching off someone else, if not their parents, a friend, playing video games all day long (final fantasy) and watching lord of the rings or whatever has dragons and fairies in it. They get into contests of who is more goth and whos a "poser".

Yes, we don't have any set beliefs, but we don't pick a religion because we think it's "cool". We're just more open to alternative beliefs. The whole dragons and fairies thing, yeah, you get a lot of goth kids into that (I can't say I personally am) and they watch a lot of fantasy movies/television, Underworld is a good example. We don't exactly pick out wannabes any more than any other group.

It encompasses aesthetics, architecture, literature, music and much more.   The sub culture can be described as dark, morbid, lifeless etc but is it much more in depth than this as it is a whole lifestyle. The traditional lifestyle started off in the 80s and branched off from the Punk sub culture and it has progressed to Marilyn Manson loving teeny boppers which is really disgraceful.   There are different types of goth sub cultures such as Traditional (people who are into the 80s scene which includes music, dark/punk-ish attire etc), Victorian goths (attire consists of corsets, long fancy historical dresses, usually like Classical music anddark wavee bands and trad goth orientated music), Cyber goths (these people are somewhat like modern goths however they are not often darkly dramatic but rather into electronic music (techno etc) and Industrial , often mix their black attire with streaks of different colours, wear goggles etc) modern goths (Marilyn Manson, wear spiky collars, have tons of piercings etc) and many more which I'm sure you can research.    Music is varied and very diverse. Often dramatic and theatrical when the less modern music is considered. Many goths like metal and sometimes Black metal exlusively...---the best metal IMO---lol =) and some like to just call themselves goth because they wear black (which really just means jack ****...they're quite like emos. Please take note that real goths despise emos (and their culture as they have turned their culture into a joke).  There are many bands that are considered gothic due to aesthetics and musical sound and lyrical themes.  Such bands include: (some are modern and some are trad)  Nightwish  Type O Negative  Depeche Mode  (Marilyn Manson) - rolls eyes  The Cure  Alien Sex Fiend  The Damned   Siouxsie And The Banshees  (Cradle Of Filth)- *Cringes* They are a shame  Evanescence  and many more.    Literature: This icludes poets like Edgar Allen poe. Many literature can be classified as gothic if they have the certain dark and eerie atmosphere. Many stories can have gothic elements which can strike a mind and astonish but they are rare these days. Concepts are versatile and sometimes have no connection to what the goth culture was initiated with. They  often include death, love/dark love, vampirism. pain, Satanism and many more concepts which are endless but too much to name although these are the main ones.    Today's goths seem to call themselves "Satanists" but they haven't got a clue that it has hardly anything to do with being goth as it has only been introduced as the culture progressed over the time.  Some goths are Pagan. Some are Christian and some are Agnostic or Atheist although you do have other religions in the scene which is comical in my opinion although one dosen't have to live the lifestyle but hold the certain element of aesthetics.

I'm goth and agnostic, but I was agnostic before I was goth.  I've known atheist goths as well as Christian goths.  Their religious beliefs are just as diverse as anybody else's.  Goths are NOT Satanists, though Satanists can be goths.    It's not about dying your hair and wearing makeup.  I've got light brown/dark blond hair and wear less makeup than most "normal" girls.  Black hair and eye makeup/white face makeup certainly looks goth, but it's not necessary.    It's not necessarily about the music, either, but a lot of people make it about the music.  A lot of goth trends in America started in the 80's, but that's more pop culture than anything.    The goth culture is heavily influenced by the Victorian era, the original germanic Goth society (especially their architecture), and gothic romanticism movement in literature as well as some more recent music movements.    Basically, goth is  a spectrum.  It's about individuality and personal expression.  The goth style reflects an individual's ability to see the darker sides to life (although one doesn't have to dwell on that idea all the time).  Goth ranges from combat boots and street pants to borderline punk to corsets and fishnets.    To sum things up, goths beleive in individuality, creativity, and personal expression.  They tend to be attracted to the darker aspects of life, but most goths that I know are not pessimistic.  Goth beleifs are diverse and cannot easily be grouped together since goths are everything from democrat and republican to christian and atheist.

That said, goth started in the late '70s and early '80s and emerged out of punk and post-punk.  Classic goth bands include Bauhaus, Siouxsie and the Banshees, Sisters of Mercy, Specimen, Alien Sex Fiend, Virgin Prunes, Christian Death, and 45 Grave.  Newer bands include Frank the Baptist, Cinema Strange, Bloody Dead and Sexy, The Ghost of Lemora, and A Spectre is Haunting Europe.    As far as your statements, there's not really anything that goths as a whole believe.  It's a music based subculture, really nothing more than that, so they're going to like goth music.  And there's a style that goes with it, so they're likely going to dress in that fashion to some extent. But those are pretty much the only things all goth would have in common and even within music and fashion there's lots of variations (although what some people would classify as goth as far as music and fashion I would argue against, but that's a different conversation).  Beyond that it's not like there's beliefs that fit all goths.  Goths have a variety of religious beliefs, political beliefs, etc.  I mean, a lot tend to be more open-minded and have unconventional interests, but even that isn't true for all goths.  And as far as fashion, it's not like all goths wear pure black or dye their hair black.  I haven't dyed my hair black for years (it hasn't been dyed at all for a year and before that I was dyeing it burgundy) and my clothes are primarily black, but not completely.
Q7EN2Zqbaa	Well I'm actually from Canada though it's pretty much the same here and health conscious people drink a lot of water.  I'm not even health conscious really and I always order water at restaurants so maybe it's just the people you know.  It could just be more hospitable to offer people cola/juice and whatnot too because water's basically free so it wouldn't really be giving anything to your guest.  If someone offers soda, the guy can always go "no, I'll just have a water please" if you know what I mean.|`|3kNncEXpaa	we drink more water then most countries because    a. we can drink it w/o worrying about parasites all the time  b. we don't have to walk a mile to get  c. its free everywhere (etc water fountains, free at restaurants/fast food)    while some places struggle to find water we are literally swimming in it|`|XBwLjq1daa	I drink water.

We're all out there enjoying the beach, ya know. Those folks with their family and me with mine. If you walked by me and got a ****, I wouldn't even notice. It'd kind of be wasted on me.|`|5vkqmp15aa	for some reason whenever i am naked i get a *****
EYqTV2EYaa	I'm not a nudist or anything, but I don't see anything wrong with enjoying yourself on a clothing optional beach, nor do I see anything wrong with children being there as well. Children have the same body parts, and that doesn't mean because they're around naked people, they're going have sex or anything. Only society has a shallow and weak view on such things. For instance, if you asked people WHY it's gross, they never give an effective response. They'd probably say something like, "Come on, do you want to want to see that," "It just is," or maybe even bring religion into it. However, it's fine with me because we all (of the correct gender of course) have the same body parts, and it's nothing new. If it was disgusting, doctors wouldn't even work on the human body. In fact, NOTHING is disgusting about the natural, disease free, and nude human body. Therefore, I feel people should lighten up to nudity, or at least open their mind and stop following societies taboos all the time. Nonetheless, I have consideration for people that disagree, it's just that, their disagreements like substance. As for the question however, if a guy got an erection from looking at me, I wouldn't be offended, but flattered because it proves I got him aroused.|`|WchfVMsPaa	If I happened to see it my first reaction would be "oh my goodness" and then probably laugh out of embarrassment and maybe somewhat flattery.

Especially if you've accidentally exposed them to your *****. Secondly, that's disgusting. You should probably keep your clothes on.
AA11872632	Use the imperative command, and leave out the 'de'.  Cre ou meurs.  familiar.  Crez ou mourez.    formal.    crons ou mourons.   WE create or we die.|`|F9NgatMtaa	It depends on if you want to say in a sentence or not and with what tenses and subject. I'm assuming you know at least a little bit about French; sorry if that's not the case.     If you're looking for just the infinitive:  To create = crer  To die = mourir    If you conjugate them, for present tense it would be:   I create - Je cre  You create - (informal)Tu cres or (formal)Vous crez  He/She create - Il/Elle cre  We create - Nous crons  They create - Ils/Elles crent    For mourir, you usually wouldn't say it in the present tense, so most likely either a future tense or a past tense. Also mourir is one of the irregular verbs (uses tre (to be) instead of avoir (to have) in the past tense)  Past tense:  Je suis mort(e) - the e is added when it is feminine  Tu es mort / Vous tes morts  Il/Elle est mort(e)  Nous sommes morts  Ils/Elles sont morts/es    Refer to this for more tenses: http://conjf.cactus2000.de/showverb.en.p...

AQPmrsVSaa	Assuming you meant "start"...    If you don't already have a lot of connections and a good reputation in your community, you're way, way better off starting a fundraiser instead. Sell people something they might be willing to pay for, like food, drinks, books, crafts, whatever you have the means for or whatever would appeal to the people most likely to be interested in your cause. Then use the profits for the charitable cause, or donate them to a charity that focuses on that cause.    People are a lot more likely to give you money if they're going to get something in return. If you simply ask for money without anything to offer, they're more likely to feel patronized and annoyed and reject you. Plus, if your organization isn't well-known or backed up by anyone known to be trustworthy, people may wonder if the money is actually going to get used wisely.|`|FjhGxAOoaa	Duck tape the star to it's window.

If they call you, which I don't think they will but if they do just tell them you go to St. so and so's church. That it is convenient to you and leave it at that.   Or call them and say, I have decided it is more convenient to go elsewhere so please take me off the registry. Thank you. Most churches have secretaries and the priest is usually too busy to answer the phone. So don't let this become a big problem for you. There are worse things to worry about.

8UTdi5G0aa	A normal length feature film runs about 1.5 hours.  Some are longer.  Yours is 93 minutes.  Can you imagine how much work goes into producing dialogue translations?  I doubt any software can do it on the fly.  Conversational speech is hard enough to translate by ear; almost impossible by machine.  Go onto YouTube and listen to any German language video.  Try to write down what they say, even for a minute.  Doch ist es sehr schwer!  Surely it would be better to obtain a version of the moive in English.  Another option is simply to learn German :-)
AA11846543	Well i'm very much into photography and when my fiancee and I were fresh in our relationship, I wanted to get him something he'd cherish. I had a few pictures of the both of us, so I went to CVS and made a collage with a few of the pics. For my favorite one of us, I made a 5x7 and made a cute border around it. He speaks french and taught me how to say "I love you", so I added that to the pic as well. Get creative! Think of something you like to do in your spare time and find a way to turn it into a nice gift for your honey.    Another suggestion could be to get into his head...kinda. I know the kind of movies my fiancee likes and I treated him for his birthday. I bought 2 comedies and 1 action movie, cooked for him, and did all the cliche stuff after...card, candy, balloon.     But you could do something like that. Not necessarily cook for him, but just figure out his favorites and shower him. Let the "common" stuff come later in the relationship...

Neways,buddy..what I believe is to make a relationship work both d parties involved should work upon it.I guess you never took interest in your wife during d past one year of your marriage..dat makes her think dat d child is only hers! Ask yourself-how involved were u when she was carrying the child? Leave d child..how much do you know about her?Did you ever ask her how is she feeling in a new place..amidst new  people after her marriage? When she repeatedly went away home did you ever care to analyse the real reason behind ? May be she never felt at home in d new surroundings..dat made her crave for her familiar place and she rushed home.Since you are d person wid whom she has d tie..becoz of you she's in your home-You should have helped her to adapt to the new surroundings.You didn't do that..instead you gave her fault finding sessions n teachings on your family customs! I dont see anything strange in her behaviour..she must be feeling terribly lonely after getting married to an unknown person who never bothered about her.She couldn't vent out her feelings to nebody..there wasnt a soul other than you and your mom..n i guess evn she ddnt care!    Its your call to save your marriage..do dat for your child..children from separated parents have a very difficult childhood!

Your marriage is not based on love, it is simply a loveless contract between you both. She does not go to you for comfort, why would she, when you are just the man that lives in her house, that orders her to cook and care for your mother and your baby, while she still works? Do you put in your share of cooking? Have you ever tried to romance her? Have you ever tried to get to know her, such as getting involved in her hobbies, making friends with her friends, understanding what makes her an individual? Do you ever offer her comfort when she is obviously sad? Do you have any idea what kind of shampoo she uses, moisturisers, underwear, books???     In short, a good marriage is based on best friends deeply in love with each other, each on the same page, with similar goals, similar background. This breeds respect, trust and partnership.     You do not seem to have that, in fact you have never had that. I would advise you to talk openly to her about your future together. Work out a plan that you both agree on, and this might include starting at the beginning of your relationship again. Make use of your mother as a baby-sitter and take your wife out on dates. Be romantic. Make her fall in love with you. Be interested in her. Provided you haven't already totally put her off, she will in turn begin to trust, admire and respect you.|`|oEYrC1Wsaa	Has your wife been checked for or diagnosed with postpartum depression?    The trouble with arranged marriages is you don't really get a chance to know each other properly.

Is there someone you can contact in yr country for advice like an abused husband  / single father help line?     Your wife might be lashing out @ you, as prior to the baby she always defined herself as an accountant.  If she is having trouble coming to grips with motherhood (a situation that she cannot have full control of), this will cause her to question her abilities.   I think you need to sit down with either a church counsellor or marriage counsellor.  For the sake of peace why not hyphenate the baby's name in the meantime so that is one less stress to contend with & it is quite acceptable in most cultures?

A group of computer savvy husbands in Bangalore, reportedly harassed by their wives, have joined hands to form a social forum named Save Indian Family Foundation (SIFF).     The Save Indian Family Foundation (SIFF) intends to prevent intimidation by female partners against men and their families.     Formed just over a year and half ago, SIFF has emerged as a platform for harassed male software professionals fighting against false dowry harassment cases.     Till date, the SIFF has over 5,000 members across the world and has counselling facilities and help lines in the United States and the Middle East.     Threatened by false cases of dowry harassment, people have joined hands. Internet was instrumental in this movement, as it provides a scope for anonymous identity. Thus, the harassed husband could connect each other and evolve a solution. Later, with the help of Blogs and internet chatting option, the effort gained momentum and we felt a need to coordinate it. Hence we formed an organisation Save Indian Family, said Anil, a software personnel and founder member of the Save Indian Family Foundation.     The lifestyles of married couples have changed in the last few years. In India, many people have sensed that often social and legal concerns are expressed only for wives in the case of matrimonial disputes. Husbands and their family members are usually labelled criminals.    According to members of Save Indian Family Foundation, anti-dowry laws are often misused to extort money.     We have seen that Section 498 of Indian Penal Code (IPC) and other anti-dowry laws have been heavily misused. In the last one-and-a-half years, we came across many such cases where anyone can find out that the charges framed are nothing but forgery and maliciously intended,aid Panduranga Katti, a software personnel and member of Save Indian Family Foundation    The existing laws to protect women against crime are being misused to abuse decent families. Experts opinion also held that the laws need a change. At least, the dowry law can be made an bailable offence, Katti added.Save Indian Family Foundation has free helpline telephone numbers for seeking counselling by men/husbands and their family members in distress in eight cities across the country. In Bangalore, it is 55334135 whereas, in Delhi, the contact number is 9871150860( Mobile No is wrong , typical mistak)    [b]Correct No. 98110611534 , 9911119113.[/b]     A Bangalore-based NGO (non government organisation) Asha Kirana is also part of the SIFF.    A recent survey by the International Institute for Population Studies showed 56 per cent of women justifying wife beating in India in certain circumstances.     The reasons varied from going out without the husbands permission to cooking a bad meal.

ccOJn7q8aa	Without being judgmental or sounding rude - Id like to open the answer by saying that i was told by an American friend that a lot of Americans have falgs outside their house or in their cars, offices etc to let people around them know that they love the country and to avoid being accused of bein un-patriotic.    This was told to me during the Bush Administration being in power and from what i know it was thanks to that half-wit that a lot of americans feared being accused of this that they would do what they could.

j5uO9LL7aa	I have actually known Latinos to call themselves brown (La Raza types often scream of Brown Pride), although they are often the same shade as Middle Eastern folks that don't call themselves brown.  I've never heard an Asian refer to themselves as yellow, perhaps because of its cowardice association, but I've heard others call them that.    Perhaps it is because until recently whites and blacks were the most prevalent groups and we simplified it for ourselves.  Perhaps it is also because "white" and "black" carry the simple and *most often* accurate implications of Euro and Afro descent, respectively (I know its a bit more complicated than that, but you get me).  Though yellow would be a mostly accurate implication of Asian descent, I can see how some would not embrace a word that also carries some less than honorable meanings.  To call someone brown, however, doesn't really signify anything accurate about their background.  Latinos and Middle Eastern folks can have the same shade of skin, yet their historical and ethnic backgrounds are quite different.    But, again, I think the main reason behind this is what I discussed in the first paragraph.  Whites and blacks have been here for awhile, and it was primarily us and the Red man, who was often called Red, for a long time.  Correlating with the increase of the Latino population, I think the reference of Brown has slowly but surely begun to take hold here as well...although when others use brown to describe another, they are likely going to be more clueless about the person they are describing.    Not real sure how you would explain this jumbled mess to a 10 year old.  Some would get it, some wouldn't.|`|143bm6cnaa	Because of political correctness.  Just like there are no more females, but rather Gyno-Americans.  There are no more Jungles, now they are Rain Forests.    Although there was always the "N-Word" people of African decent were referred to as "colored" 50 years ago.  Then "*****" entered the lexicon as a more civilized word.  Then "Afro-American" became popular.  Now "African-American" is the most accepted form.    Latino were referred to simply as "Spanish"  It didn't matter if they came from Spain, Puerto Rico, or Argentina.  Brazilians were referred to the same way, even though they speak Portuguese.     Arabs were A-rabs.      All Asians were called Chinese.  It didn't matter if they were Chinese, Japanese, Korean, Vietnamese, etc.    Its just people trying way too hard not to insult each other.  Sorry, but tell your cousin that it makes no sense at all.|`|K0mvCFhEaa	Hispanics are called Brown.Its really stupid.    "Black" people are not Black, they are Brown.

However these terms are used as often as black and white maybe because those groups don't like those terms.|`|46fouwFfaa	I think it's because there were mostly Blacks, whites, and Natives in America before many Asians (including Middle East) came. There were some Asian slaves but not many. Since the greatest contrast was between the whites and blacks, of course they would come up with labels to separate the two. Natives were called Indians or redskins (which is an offensive term today).|`|NDhC2PNGaa	my son is 10 and hes started to ask questions, but what i noticed at first was when he had to describe some one, he would say it was the boy with the brown face, but to some people, we would say, "it was the black man", same as "it was the white man". do i tell him we say its a black man because none of really can tell someones nationality by looking at them,its all complicated when it comes to teaching them, anyway good luck with that.

101bfea0cfc2e9bab98441d37836406eaa	Frankly, I think the boss has a right to know that his heat is being turned up so high. Presumably, he has a heating bill to be concerned with. HE should have the say on what the heat is set at, not you OR your coworker.    Bring it to him, and then do what he says in regards to it.

They are making Christianity a crazy concept.|`|uz9GtV9vaa	I usually don't unless it's for a joke.|`|qKSn0AVsaa	WE...dont!

This is how I usually try to respond. Thanks.|`|AA11521494	I was always told when I was a Christian that the biggest witness is the way you behave.  If people like you and see something different in you, then they might be willing to listen to the beliefs that make you that way.  Unfortunately for Christians, there do seem to be an awful lot who can't communicate.  Throwing bible verses as an answer to people who don't believe the bible is hardly helpful, nor is being rude in reply just because you disagree.  There's far too much of that on this site and it tars the rest of you with the same brush.    You would presumably expect non-believers to be less respectful, but the funny thing is that the proportion of rude people seems to be the same here amongst believers and non-believers.  I can't give numbers but it feels like that.  Intriguing!

These people should be treated as kindly as possible however if they are about to destroy a soul which could be rescued from an eternity of Torture and Pain or if they are telling some one to kill them selves as we witnessed the other night then not only is their behavior illegal in the eyes of the law but in the eyes of God as well!|`|8KBYpo7Eaa	I think they act in this way because they are unsure of their own belief.

Thank you, seriously, for stepping up as a Christian and talking some sense into the others who are making the whole religion look bad.

That's what I think.|`|iN0Jc7D7aa	Well i must say with all due respect that you are a wise man.You were patient enough to read all answers some so called "real christians" backfire to the none belivers out of emotional anger.The word in the bible says you should be the light of the world,the shining light so that those that are unbelievers would come to be interested in how you condone yourselves with christian values.The Bible purely states in the book of Proverbs 25:21-22 if your enemy is hungry,give him food to eat;if he is thirsty give him water to drink .In doing this you heap burning coals on his head,and the lord will reward you.Proverbs 26:4-5 Do not answer a fool according to his folly,or you will be like him yourself.Answer a fool according to his folly,or he will be wise in your eyes.In Matthew 24:10-13 At that time many will turn away from the faith and will betray and hate each other and many false prophets will appear and deceive many people.Because of the increase of wickedness the love of most will grow cold.But he who stands firm to the end will be saved.    If we claim to be christians but don't have self control then i would say we're are cheating ourselves and the love of God is not in us because God is love and with divine love we have patience,kindness,self-control,goodness,... and happiness which are the fruits of the spirit.

PEUwnGHraa	So true Tara. I'm glad you brought this question to the surface. It is a form of suicide to not take the proper medication and potentially life-saving assistance from a doctor's advice in order that you may be saved from death.    They'll say as you know, "Well, can a doctor guarantee life during surgery" or some madness like that, "but only God can guarantee life so we abstain from taking any blood transfusions".    They will call you a liar, Tara, but you know you are not a liar. These people are not from God at all but are PROGRAMMED to come up with any/every degenerate response or lies as it were, when dealing with anything including taking a blood transfusion.    http://www.slideshare.net/DeeeTeee/a-mes...    http://www.freeminds.org/sales/index.htm...      GET INFORMED especially by the 2nd link above. There is just no reason for anyone to be ignorant of this cult any longer. We're putting the truth out there so there are no excuses not to get informed and steer clear of this cult.|`|n5AXfWEfaa	It is systematic mind controlled suicide.  QiA Post your Ham Sandwich picture!|`|MEReSvZeaa	Some questions just shouldn't make it through the filters...|`|6Q4xh4F1aa	It is suicide, imho.  I might respect the jw's more if they would at least be consistent in their beliefs. They cannot have whole blood transfusions of even their own stored blood, but they can take in artificial blood that is made from expired, stored human blood.

6Q4xh4F1aa	They use it because if they were to take a KJV into the kingdom hall they would burst into flames.  They might claim to use many translations, but this is only to throw off critics.  By and large the vast majority of jw's use the NWT exclusively because it has been constructed with a bias to favor their false doctrines.    Someone wrote this:  The NWT is known worldwide as the most accurate translation available. It is used by many others because of this, not just us.--    This is a bald-faced lie.  I would love to see a citation from a source other than watchtower dot com that agrees with this.  The KJV is the most accurate of the translations because it is not taken from the incorrect Alexandrian Bible texts.    When the Bible was first being translated into English scrolls and books were gathered together from all over the world and with only some spelling differences in some names of people and cities like Peter / Pedro, they were all the same.  They were exact copies of one another.    The one exception was the Alexandrian Bible.  It was written by some folks called the Alexandrians.  The scholar mentioned that they were sort of like Jehovah's Witnesses because they called themselves Christians but they believed a lot of strange things.  Apparently they didn't like some verses in the good copy of the Bible they had so they took them out and added in others to fit their beliefs and created a new version of the Bible.    This altered version it is claimed to be the basis for the Catholic Douay Bible, Westcott & Hort's Translation and the New World Translation which is used by the jw's.      Besides this, the Watchtower has taken many Greek scholars words and twisted them out of context so as to appear that they support their NWT.  Here is a scathing example of what happened when Dr. Mantey discovered what they were doing:    The aforementioned are only a few examples of Watchtower mistranslations and perversions of Gods Word. In view of the preceding facts, especially because you have been quoting me out of context, I herewith request you not to quote the Manual Grammar of the Greek New Testament again, which you have been doing for 24 years. Also that you not quote it or me in any of your publications from this time on. Also that you publicly and immediately apologize in the Watchtower magazine, since my words had no relevance to the absence of the article before theos in John 1:1. And please write to Caris and state that you misused and misquoted my "rule." On the page before the preface in the grammar are these words: "All rights reserved - no part of this book may be reproduced in any form without permission in writing from the publisher." If you have such permission, please send me a photo-copy of it. If you do not heed these requests you will suffer the consequences. Regretfully yours, Julius R. Mantey     Here is part of an interview of Dr. Mantey by Dr, Martin:    DR. MARTIN: What would you say to a JW who was looking for the truth?   DR. MANTEY: I would advise him to get a translation other than the NWT, because ninety-nine percent of the scholars of the world who know Greek and who have helped translate the Bible are in disagreement with the JWs. People who are looking for the truth ought to know what the majority of the scholars really believe. They should not allow themselves to be misled by the JWs and end up in hell.     Here is a quote by Dr. J. R. Mantey (who is quoted on pages 1158-1159) of the Witnesses own Kingdom interlinear Translation):     "A shocking mistranslation." "Obsolete and incorrect." "It is neither scholarly nor reasonable to translate John 1:1 'The Word was a god.'"|`|231296b9ebdeed24570b8ca6978948c0aa	I don't like the Jehovah's Witness version, and I'm not too fond of the King James Version, either.    The King James was great, back in 1610.  But the English language is different than it was back then.  And most readers do not take that into account.  Example:  "wonderful" nowadays means "very good"; in 1610, it meant "filled you with wonder" (which is what the Greek means) - not exactly the same.|`|5WIZowKOaa	The NWT is known worldwide as the most accurate translation available. It is used by many others because of this, not just us. All of the errors and punctuation have been corrected that had been altered previousely by the clergy in order to support false teachings and doctrines. Most important, Gods name has been restored to its rightful place. In just the Hebrew scriptures alone it appears almost 7,000 times. The Jews took it out dut to a superstition and substituted titles such as lord in its place. And you wonder why all the confusion!|`|303d09c15f570b61eacfd986abd0f326aa	Well, I will use the KJV if someone wants and show them scripture.  But most religions and not just us will admit it's not a great version for english.  Look at this link..  http://tetragrammaton.org/truthintrans.h...  For one we don't use a different Bible.  It's probably 90% or more that same as most others.  Second look at that link and look at what that college professor who studies such things says about the "New WOrld Translation".  Says it's the most accurate english version in existence.  So that is food for thought.|`|EJHhCDcaaa	The New World Translation (NWT) is defined by the Jehovah's Witnesses parent organization (The Watchtower Society) as "a translation of the Holy Scriptures made directly from Hebrew, Aramaic and Greek into modern day English by a committee of anointed witnesses of Jehovah." The NWT is the anonymous work of the New World Bible Translation Committee. Jehovahs Witnesses claim that the anonymity is in place so that the credit for the work will go to God. Of course this has the added benefit of keeping the translators from any accountability for their errors, and prevents real scholars from checking their academic credentials.    The New World Translation is unique in one thing  it is the first intentional systematic effort at producing a complete version of the Bible that is edited and revised for the specific purpose of agreeing with a group's doctrine. The Jehovahs Witnesses and the Watchtower Society realized that their beliefs contradicted Scripture. So, rather than conforming their beliefs to Scripture, they altered Scripture to agree with their beliefs. The New World Bible Translation Committee went through the Bible and changed any Scripture that did not agree with Jehovahs Witness theology. This is clearly demonstrated by the fact that as new editions to the New World Translation were published, additional changes were made to the biblical text. As biblical Christians continued to point out, Scriptures that clearly argue for the deity of Christ (for example), the Watchtower Society would publish a new edition of the New World Translation with those Scriptures changed.    The most widespread change in the Watchtower Bible is the insertion of the name JEHOVAH 237 times in the New Testament. Of course, it is appropriate for a translator to choose to use the divine name JEHOVAH or YAHWEH in the Old Testament where the Tetragrammator YHWH actually appears in the Hebrew text. However, the Watchtower has gone beyond this by inserting the name JEHOVAH in the New Testament, where it does not appear in Greek manuscripts. One need only look at the word-by-word English that appears under the Greek text in the Society's own Kingdom Interlinear Translation to see that the name JEHOVAH is not there in the Greek.     Why the bias concerning Christ? Because the Watchtower teaches that Jesus is a mighty god, but not the almighty God, a creature rather than the Creator.     It is only the Watchtower's pre-conceived heretical beliefs that are behind the dishonest and inconsistent translation that is the New World Translation. The New World Translation is most definitely not a valid version of Gods Word. There are minor differences between all the major English translations of the Bible. No English translation is perfect. However, while other Bible translators make minor mistakes in the rendering of the Hebrew and Greek text into English; the NWT intentionally changes the rendering of the text to conform to Jehovahs Witness theology. The New World Translation is a perversion, not a version, of the Bible.|`|VxTKNbJRaa	The KJV is not acceptable because the language supports the divinity and deity of Jesus Christ Imannuel(God with/among us) our Lord and Savior.    Here is an answer to part of your question about the New World Bible.    Q.  Does the Watchtower Bible and Tract Society claim: The NWT is known worldwide as the most accurate translation available?  A.  No. The NWT is known as a variation that has been altered to fit the beliefs of the men that publish it.  The Watchtower Bible and Tract Society cherry picks supporting statements for its translation.    Q.  Is it true that, It is used by many others because of this, not just JWs?  A.  No. There are former JWs that have not let go of certain dogma that may still use it  and certain non-Trinitarian people that may use it to support their view as a reference but not as a primary bible.    Q.  Have All of the errors and punctuation have been corrected that had been altered previously by the clergy in order to support false teachings and doctrines.  A.  This is a belief by the followers of the Watchtower Bible and Tract Society. The Emphatic Diaglott, long in print by the named publishers, alone disproves the deceptive changes in translation, phraseology, and syntax, let alone punctuation.  Clergy in this statement along with the word Christendom are words that are used in a unique way by the Jehovahs Witnesses. This labeling is called argot and loads the language in whereby a follower of the Watchtower Bible and Tract Society snaps their mind shut to further information because they have be taught with repetitive reinforcement that the only accurate source of information is from the above named publishing group.    Q.  Is it true that Gods name has been restored to its rightful place by the Watchtower Bible and Tract Society?  A.  No. The letters YHVH are still present in the Hebrew scrolls. These have not been removed.    Q.  Does Gods name in the Hebrew scriptures alone appear almost 7,000 times and The Jews took it out due to a superstition and substituted titles such as lord in its place?  A.  The Jews have not removed YHVH from the scrolls The Jews would not do that.  A group of translators called the Masorites and another called the Seventy translated the scrolls into other languages and did not find it any appropriate  manner in which to bring forth the very name of God into the languages they were translating the scrolls into. This led to using the nearest title of respect to the translation.  In English these were later translated LORD rather than YHVH. This was not done by the Jews.|`|0vm11Q3Zaa	The KJV is Gods Word    The NWT is changed into Watchtower beliefs.          http://www.cftf.com|`|AA10157646	They use the bible that fits more...for example they use one edited by the Watchtower organization.

KS2OHXCRaa	If you're a first time learner I would advise going for 2 hours lessons rather than 4 hours. Especially if you're learning it on the side and have other things e.g. school/college/employment that require your attention too.    For one, there are going to be a lot of basics to learn, and unless you've already have the knowledge of another Latin-based language, you may find a lot of things rather confusing e.g. verb conjugation, gender differentiation etc. It is best to learn them in classes, then have a bit more time to yourself to assimilate and understand the lessons.    Secondly, prolonged period of learning usually means less retention, as you're likely to be tired or have your attention span weaning and starting to wander somewhere else.     Thirdly you want to be able to enjoy the classes and not feel like you're just having these endless classes. Considering this is your first attempt at learning the language, you may or may not find it to meet your expectations. If it does, it's great but if it doesn't, long hours will make you resentful that it's taking up too much of your time.    In short, I would be more inclined to advise someone to take 4 hours classes only if they've learned French at some stage and now need to bring their level up to speed, so to say, and improve on a more intensive scale. Otherwise, 2 hours would be good start. If you do find the 2 hours classes not advancing your learning fast enough, then it's not too late to request for an "upgrade" to the 4 hours classes.    Bon courage!|`|AA10176537	i would go for the normal course considering the fact that your attention and concentration will decrease after 2 hours.

Science always moves forward, pushing back the fog of ignorance, and making religion less relevent with each passing day.|`|4sUek7ugaa	Love is a subjective experience and can't be studied mathematically.  I think the parallel that can be drawn is that love as a subjective human experience exists just like faith as a subjective human experience exists.   However, the subjective human experience of faith does not prove that any deity really exists.|`|95d7d71a581d3cf307e1768f080800edaa	What does love have to do with being an atheist or not being one? This is just sad.|`|KVirP3bsaa	There is evidence that love exists. If you have loved someone or have had someone love you, that is a form of evidence for the emotion we call love. How else do you think we would go about defining the emotion and calling it love if it did not manifest in us? Observation shows that love exists, that observation is what we defined the emotion based on.    Just because you can not see something does not mean there isn't evidence for it. However in the case of god, he not only can not be seen, but there is not even any evidence to support his existence.    Edit: "4Saken: Subjective experience cannot be used as evidence"  It is evidence of what is being experienced being an experience. Just as any emotion causes reactions from us, love causes a reaction. That reaction is evidence for the emotion causing the reaction(just as a falling object is evidence for gravity). You don't even need to get into brain chemistry and neurology to show that an emotion exists.    "4saken: But that has no scientific meaning, since there is no clear cut definition. If you take a group of 100 people and ask them to define it, you will get a ton of varying responses"  So what? It is still evidence that the emotion  known as love exists. That would be a problem with the definition, not a problem of whether it exists or not.

You want us to prove something, you first have to provide an operational definition. If you want to talk about brain chemicals, then serotonin, dopamine, and oxytocin are all involved with what we would call infatuation. We would measure these and then look at subjects self-reporting their experiences. Despite what you say, subjective self-reporting IS a valid method in science, particularly when there's no other way to measure something.    Another way to look at love would be commitment. You could say that the number of years someone has been with someone else is a way of measuring love. Not necessarily a definition I would choose, but at this point I have given you two examples of an operational definition, and you haven't provided even one.

A Multi complex organism is something that has multiple parts that have to be there from day one working together as a unit. If any of these parts were not there from day one then the  organism simply couldn't evolve (exist) Science has advanced alot since his time. So if Charles Darwin wouldn't believe in Evolution now, why would other people continue believing. Facts are still facts  Scientists tell us the probability of life at its lowest level of complexity, originating on the earth by natural proses over a period of two billion years is 10 to the minus 255. so that's a decimal point and then 254 zero's before your first number. but the boundary of possibility is 10 to the minus 50, so any number past that is just impossible.  The moon each year moves away from the earth so if we have been here for millions of years the moon would have been rolling around the surface of the planet. the fact is that we have been here for about 6000 years.  i like to think that some of my ancestors were hung by the neck but not by the tail.

Questioning islam and really think and rethink the religion twice  .To see if their teaching are really from god.  3.Love instead of being so harsh specially LOve and understand people who are different.    4.Read more about the world specially other religions and cultures in detail so they can be more smart and understand they are not the only ones in the planet.    5.Start mixing with other races very important so people can like them.They need to socialize with  the rest of the world .Communication    6.Work with their fellow jihad brothers to STOP bombing the usa and the REST of the world.    7.Helping other people more than you help yourself.Specially non muslims.    8.Caring more for others people problems,their feelings too.    That is more than enough and they will get a good review in front of Gods eye.There is more but that other part they know it.If ??they read the koran its there.

I'm 20-years-old, so I don't feel it was long ago, and actually, I remember it like it was yesterday. I was in LD (learning disability) classes because I had severe dyslexia and other learning disabilities. Because of that, it took me until 5th grade to learn how to effectively read and write. Well, as a result, the BD (behavioral disorder) students across the room would make fun of us when the teachers were gone. I believed it was torture. lol. The room was hot, the place was always loud because the severely mentally impaired students would often shout and cry, and worst of all, the BD students would make ME cry. Nonetheless, I still learned how to read and write and I got out of there. In middle school, I adapted really well.

I couldn't put this in a delicate way....but people like to beleive that there's something more than this world out their...and there's different volume's of religion, as there is different volume's of how religious you are. So it depends, like, are you evangelistic, or lutheran? Or maybe your bhuddist?  You also have to consider how they were brought up with religion.  I think, if they were brought up with religion in a personal manner, speaking about religion to someone else...may make them a little uncomfortable, cause its like a secretive thing to them. However, if they are religious but grew up with it as not such a serious thing, they might be a little more open about it.  There's just to many factors involved to say for sure why people take offense to talking about religion in private or in public, or somewhere inbetween.|`|T52vXXBJaa	I was watching a video about some Jewish people in New York dancing around and celebrating the bombing of Gaza.

She thought it was totally despicable that someone would do that. The guy replied that a moil had slashed his penis when he was a child, and she looked at him like she was pretty offended and replied that it wasn't the same thing, that it was inappropriate.    I think she was offended because she was unaware of the hypocrisy that her position forced her into.|`|YQNEB7CRaa	Well, it is true that sore spots are hit when talking about religion. And this might not exactly that they are unsure of their sprituality, it could be more of them not being able to express what their religion and its beliefs are all about in the simplest manner possible. Sometimes, some beliefs in religion have no proper explanation to them and the reason people still follow it is the faith that binds them to God :)|`|eMAMo5oPaa	When people have been taught 'religion' instead of Bible, they are not always able to receive anything that doesn't coincide with their views.  They are afraid that they would be heretics if they did. Many are afraid to die and they look for a future 'coming' of Christ soon so they can just ride on a cloud into heaven. No, no!  That is physical thinking.     Religion, IMV, is traditional beliefs, rituals, "we always do it this way, so it must be right" and the preacher becomes the leader of the congregation. People willingly give up their own responsibility to study to see if what they are taught is true. It is spiritual laziness and love of self to put God last, and it leads to exactly what you are talking about.  God said that He did things in the OT because then "They shall know that I am God." Read Ezekial's message to Israel from God and you will see what I mean.|`|93aY6WzAaa	well, there is righteous indignation, too.  i don't think in this day and age (assuming that we have evolved any as a species) think that I should have to endure the "our way is the only way" proselytizing of a cultic religious zealot.

It is simply a FEAR-soothing fantasy.   Faith represents a security blanket at its best and a tool of subjugation at its worst.    1. There is no evidence that gods exist.  2. The world operates exactly as we would expect it to if no gods exist.  3. The entire concept of "gods" is illogical.  ~|`|OT4SrmDXaa	Because this is a war between Good and evil.

THAT, to me is pure blasphemy, for God IS Unconditional Love, Love WITHOUT conditions, and if we take the trouble to think things through with the brain and discernment God gave us, we will see that all the negative qualities stated were assigned to God by MAN, who wrote the Bible, and his churches, who use fear and threat to maintain their power over people*s lives as they always have done, since their TOTAL rule over the centuries resulted in their killing millions of people, and brilliant individuals like the genius, Galileo, were imprisoned for life for, in his case, daring to disagree with the church*s teaching that it is the Sun that goes round the Earth!..

God made it easy and sent us messengers and prophets to show us the way and tell us why... so all the messengers and all the religions are from the same only God, so they've got to be complementary to each other, not opposing each other!!! then God must have said His final words in the last message, what is the last message? and how do we know it's the last one? I guess that would be the religion that believes in all messengers and all books equally... is there such religion? actually yes, Islam does :)  A True Muslim (man or woman) gets his reward for obeying Allah's orders (Allah means The God in Arabic) by going to heaven, where he/she are indulged forever in all the good things that were on earth and more, things no one ever dreamt of or heard about. The Holy Quran tells Muslims (men and women) there will be good food, good wine and sex in heaven for all, but not in the bestial way you may think of, but rather in a way that is satisfactory for everyone and better than what was on earth. Heaven is no heartbreak or injustice land.  True Muslims are no terrorists, and Islam never calls for that, Islam means peace, it bans violence unless you were fought so you fight back, it only doesn't require Muslims to be cowards, and true Muslims understand this very well and never attack civilians.   Islam is the only religion that accepts freedom of religion and asks men to treat women gently like queens.   It's all in the Holy Quran and the right teachings of prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him).  If some people behave otherwise, then it's because people behaviour doesn't necessarily reflect the rulings of their religion always, for example, we can't (and don't) judge Christianity by Hitler or Madonna.  And that is another reason why there is heaven and hell after we die, heaven for the obedient and hell for the disobedient and/or oppressor, it's all going to be decided on the day of resurrection and judgement.  To be a Muslim, you must believe God is only one with no spouses or offspring, believe in his angels (servants not males or females), believe in all his religions, messangers and books equally, the day of judgement, heaven and hell and that everything is in God's hands and because of his will (good or bad).  Muslims believe God is the only divine who never dies, the creator who deserves to be worshiped, all prophets who came to earth are human messangers sent by him.  Muslims don't deny christianity, judaism, Jesus or Moses. They believe in them as the noble prophets and messangers of God, love and respect them so much.  We believe the birth of Jesus (messanger of God) was a miracle from God to us, being born by a mother only and with no father. God is the creator, he can do anything.  We believe Jesus (peace be upon him) is NOT dead till today; he wasnt even murdered or crucified as most people think. God (most glorified) made the man who betrayed Jesus be killed instead by switching their looks for a moment. Jesus was left up to live in heaven until the end of days when he will come back to earth again, with no new teachings or messages but just to make justice prevail instead of oppression, fight the imposter who will claim to be God and (most important) to perform his last prayer with the Muslims announcing he's too a follower of the last prophet (Muhammad) as all people should... then he really dies like other Prophets and be buried (peace be upon them all). So we're waiting for you Jesus, Messenger of God, to bring the world peace and pray with us. Thats what prophet Muhammad told us and this is what I believe in, Im a Muslim  so how do we know it's true? what is said in the last message and what should we do? read the following, and you'll figure out for yourself:|`|AA11132696	Of course its Islam like always  the main cause of all the mess and fights.|`|AA10736671	Its not the religion its the army from both side who is responsible for the tension.

So in essence they opposed everything India has stood for. They oppose multi-ethnic, multilingual and multicultural concept that is India. The very founding principle of Pakistan that religion could unite people received a big jolt in 1971 when East Pakistan seceded from West Pakistan and came to be known as Bangladesh. Now their government is defunct, they have nothing to offer to their own people. So they use hatred towards India to unite their own folk.    And Pakistan uses Kashmir as a ploy to justify the prevailing tension. As one of the users here has pointed out there are more Muslims in India than in Pakistan even though India is secular and Pakistan an Islamic country. So their claim on Tibet is farce, unjustified and maledifide.|`|FD9Jz0hoaa	Islam can be misinterpreted in many ways , this is not the fault of Islam , more the human failing we all have , even we Muslims :)    The best we can do is what we think is right(the way we interpret Al Quran) ...we know that it is right ...........even though we could be wrong .........it must be correct ..........because Allah says so .......even though it could be wrong.|`|VCzsfVM5aa	I'd have to say no.  Just using religion to justify the killing.  But it breaks down to who threw the first rock and why instead of forgiving, got the whole block to throw more rocks back. You can look at every war that way, what is the underlying motive.  Pride, it clouds our judgments, and gives a false sense of righteousness to those who may have inadvertently chose the path of evil. Just another form of racism.|`|pThx9eA6aa	Aurangzed,being an indian,it was a 'great ' information for me to know that we worship Ram and Krishna..lol..Get a life    @asker,no,there isn't much religion in the play.Its just sick militants spoiling our peace and wasting our resources..

Our most recent common ancestor with all other apes is probably Pierolapithecus catalaunicus, which lived 11-14 million years ago (known from fossil evidence).  From recent studies of molecular genetics, it appears as though reproductive isolation between humans and chimpanzees (our closest ape relative) began about 10 million years ago, although some gene interchange (interbreeding) occured until complete reproductive isolation was achieved about 5 million years ago.|`|gBoUrlrKaa	Man ape is Bush.|`|kksq9BtOaa	Well come on atheists we know when were not wanted lets just pack up our things and go back to worshiping man ape.|`|M8T31Roaaa	Just step outside.

7608d8bbef666e373ac9050db58b0ce9aa	Jesus (Peace Be Upon Him) was not crucified.  He was ascended to the Heaven.    That they said (in boast), "We killed Christ Jesus the son of Mary, the Messenger of Allah.;- but they killed him not, nor crucified him, but so it was made to appear to them, and those who differ therein are full of doubts, with no (certain) knowledge, but only conjecture to follow, for of a surety they killed him not:-    (  ???? ??????  , An-Nisa, Chapter 4, Verse 157)|`|bEeozqacaa	Jesus is fictional|`|8pQrIL90aa	Jesus said " I will raise this temple in three days" when he knew the time for death had come. Numbers play a very crucial role in the bible, especially the numbers 3 and 7.    Jesus was SINLESS and he died for us. He did not have to die as the bible says " No man take my life from me, but I lay it down of myself" If you were a sinless man, and there was a GOD that sent you into the world for a divine purpose, would you not be able to come back to life under the power of GOD and serve the purpose that was given to you? Jesus died because he wanted to save us, but more than anything he was dedicated to his father. Even before he was going to die the very real threat came upon his soul that he was going to suffer at the hands of a evil mob of people he said " Take this cup from me, but may your will be done!. Jesus was never literally forgiven, because he never sinned, but he had to die in order to go back to heaven and make it able for man to be brought back to GOD in a much more powerful way, that will save the soul from death.    Only those who sin need to ask for forgiveness, Jesus never sinned.|`|mMPjXbvcaa	FREE WILL DERP DERP|`|AA12346187	its the willing sacrifice  Jesus made  that paid the price  of sin.  he did not sin.|`|2WnbP80Taa	John 20:17 - Jesus saith unto her, TOUCH ME NOT; for I am not yet ascended to my Father: but go to my brethren, and say unto them, I ascend unto my Father, and your Father; and to my God, and your God ( quotes from the KJV).    Jesus himself, had to ascend and stand before God for Judgment-he was carring all the sins of the world for all time.  Those who do not accept him as their personal savior will stand before God on judgment day with their own sins.|`|eb38abe11698b46fde324034db87a709aa	I think you should learn the difference between trade and metamorphosis. There are so many metaphors of Jesus and his crucifixion it is rather complicated. The blood of this 'lamb' cleanses sin from the sinner. Personally I think it is a dangerous psychology, but some people have the necessary competence. It is Gods son, that's how, but it is a representation of a promise to forgive, presumably in exchange for repentance and allegiance/alliance.|`|AA11654248	In the same way that I forgive people, I send my sons to their death so I can forgive the other person.  Sensible, huh ?|`|SQ6FVuuXaa	I don't mean to be pedantic, but he wasn't dead for three days. It was more like a day and a half. He died on Friday afternoon, was dead all Saturday and rose again on the third day in the early morning, before the women could get there to re-wrap his body. That's about one and a half days total. Not a lot of time to spend in Hell for the sins of All Mankind.  But obviously enough, or there would be no internal consistency to the story, and it already has enough internal inconsistency, you don't want even more.|`|AkFVoQlVaa	Jesus was sinless, thus he did not need to be forgiven of anything. Rather he suffered the punishment of our sins, death, that we might not be punished for them. Also, eternal suffering was not what Adam was cursed with, only physical death. Thus the payment to God on behalf of Adam was also the same, physical death. It is the same principle of sacrifice that has existed with the Hebrews for thousands of years: "For the life of the flesh [is] in the blood: and I have given it to you upon the altar to make an atonement for your souls: for it [is] the blood [that] maketh an atonement for the soul." (Lev 17:11)    In addition, your belief that God made Jesus into "sin" seems to stem from 2 Corinthians 5:21; but this says that God made Jesus to be "sin for us", not that he just turned him into sin. Thus it is implied that he was made a "sacrifice" for sin and  not guilty of the sin. Also, to say that he was physically and completely made into sin is false, for his shape was initiated by God.|`|AA11232354	By his death on the cross, Jesus Christ paid all the penalty for sin.  He fulfilled all his Father's will.  The Bible says that "For as in Adam all die, even so in Christ shall all be made alive.I Cor. 15:22  It was what God had decreed and Christ's death satisfied God's requirement.|`|VzCygD6taa	You state    When Jesus was crucified, God put all man's sin onto Jesus, but he also made Jesus sin itself.     What is your Bible evidence that God did this thing?   I expect your following some notion put forward by one of the Christian Churches.  You can justifiably say Jesus died for our sins but not that he (God) also made Jesus sin itself  Sin is just disobedience of Gods ordinances.  Jesus never disobeyed.    You state -  If God cannot forgive the unrepentant, because he cannot dwell with sin and the only way to expunge sin is to cast it into Hell, how is it that Jesus could be punished by a mere three days of death? If sin (Jesus) is expunged merely by spending three days in death, why does a sinner require eternity in Hell?    Since you first statement is incorrect.    Your second is based of a false assumption.    Jesus did indeed spend 3 days in the grave but because Jesus was sinless he was raised for the dead.   In like manner if we accept Jesus as our saviour as Mark records -    Mark 16:15-16 KJV    15  And he said unto them, Go ye into all the world, and preach the gospel to every creature.    16  He that believeth and is baptized shall be saved; but he that believeth not shall be damned.    Gods love of us provided a way of reconciliation -    John 3:16-19 TNIV  For God so loved the world that he gave his one and only Son, that whoever believes in him shall not perish but have eternal life.  17  For God did not send his Son into the world to condemn the world, but to save the world through him.  18  Whoever believes in him is not condemned, but whoever does not believe stands condemned already because they have not believed in the name of God's one and only Son.  19  This is the verdict: Light has come into the world, but people loved darkness instead of light because their deeds were evil.    The faithful are able to look forward to resurrection and a place in the kingdom.    1 Peter 1:3-21 MKJV    3  Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, who according to His great mercy has regenerated us again to a living hope through the resurrection of Jesus Christ from the dead,    4  to an inheritance incorruptible and undefiled, and unfading, reserved in Heaven for you    5  by the power of God, having been kept through faith to a salvation ready to be revealed in the last time;    6  in which you greatly rejoice, yet a little while, if need be, grieving in manifold temptations;    7  so that the trial of your faith (being much more precious than that of gold that perishes, but being proven through fire) might be found to praise and honor and glory at the revelation of Jesus Christ,    8  whom having not seen, you love; in whom not yet seeing, but believing in Him you exult with unspeakable joy, and having been glorified,    9  obtaining the end of your faith, the salvation of your souls.    10  About which salvation the prophets sought out and searched out, prophesying concerning the grace for you;    11  searching for what, or what manner of time, the Spirit of Christ made clear within them, testifying beforehand of the sufferings of Christ, and the glories that should follow.    12  To them it was revealed that not to themselves, but to us, they ministered the things which are now reported to you by those who have preached the gospel to you in the Holy Spirit sent from Heaven; which things the angels desire to look into.    13  Therefore girding up the loins of your mind, being sober, perfectly hope for the grace being brought to you at the revelation of Jesus Christ,    14  as obedient children, not fashioning yourselves according to the former lusts in your ignorance,    15  but according to the Holy One who has called you, you also become holy in all conduct,    16  because it is written, "Be holy, for I am holy."    17  And if you call on the Father, who without respect of persons judges according to the work of each one, pass the time of your earthly residence in fear,    18  knowing that you were not redeemed with corruptible things, silver or gold, from your vain manner of life handed down from your fathers,    19  but with the precious blood of Christ, as of a lamb without blemish and without spot;    20  indeed having been foreknown before the foundation of the world, but revealed in the last times for you,    21  those believing in God through Him, He who raised Him up from the dead and gave Him glory, so that your faith and hope might be in God.      Additional note -  You wrote -  TruthSetsyouFree - I ask you to read your bible. God not only lay the burden of man's sin upon Jesus, but he also made Jesus sin itself. Think about that. Jesus BECAME sin. He didn't become a sinner, he became sin itself. How can three days (or a day and a half) atone sin itself when God requires eternity for a mere sinner?    Please provide a quotation that says "Jesus became sin itself"   Jesus did not have to atone for his sins - he didn't have any.    All you do is say this is so - you can't prove it.|`|c2fc70c8196fb6665f4605b33bcc57a4aa	Jesus was born perfect and remained perfect.    He does not have to be forgiven for anything.    He was sent to the earth by his father as a sacrifice for us.    And his father, ALMIGHT GOD JEHOVAH...always wanted sacrifices to be the BEST. The Best quality. Jesus, as a man, was that.|`|uZ1KX3v4aa	2Co 5:21  For He has made Him who knew no sin, to be sin for us, that we might become the righteousness of God in Him.     Rom 6:23  For the wages of sin is death, but the gift of God is eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord.     Jesus became sin in that He became the carrier, or burden bearer.  Jesus took sin upon Himself for one reason - to destroy it.  Hell could not hold the spotless Lamb of God - and as I type that, I'm grinning from ear to ear.      I think that perhaps a distinction should be made here between the sin and the sinner.  Jesus was not a SINNER because He did not commit sin.  There was nothing to forgive.  The verse in Romans says the wages of SIN is death...not the wages of being a flesh and blood man is death.  It was sin that was punished in Hell, not Jesus.  He took it there.  The miracle is that Jesus never sinned, not once.  His love for God was such that He clung to Him and His grace...the enabling power of God.  And that grace enabled Him to live a sinless life.  His love for man enabled Him to never commit offenses against them.      Another verse says that Jesus has the keys to death and Hell.  The keys are the two commandments!  Love God and love man.  It's so freakin' simple, but people make it so complicated.  Death cannot kill love.  And Hell cannot hold it.  That's a revelation in and of itself.    Hope this answered your question.  If not, you know where to find me...lol.|`|AA11955963	He was not forgiven,rather He forgave.As long as we fail to recognise the other side of Sin we'll dwell in "Hell"!(your definition,of course.)|`|a7e4527ac6ed1229d8be6f0ca3adf702aa	Jesus was the Holy One of the God Almighty as written in the Holy Bible - the Holy Word of God.    Jesus Christ the Holy Son of God was resurrected back to life, appeared to all people who believed in Jesus, ascended to heaven, exalted and seated at the right hand of power. Jesus will come again as King of Kings and Lord of Lords to establish the Eternal Kingdom of Heaven for the Glory of God Almighty.    Obedience to the Holy Eternal Living God Almighty will send the creation to eternal Life in Christ Jesus.    Read the Holy Bible Romans 10:9... That if thou shalt confess with thy mouth the Lord Jesus, and shalt believe in thine heart that God hath raised him from the dead, thou shalt be saved.  Acts 2:38... Peter replied, "Repent and be baptized, every one of you, in the name of Jesus Christ for the forgiveness of your sins. And you will receive the gift of the Holy Spirit.    Obedience to the disobedient fallen angel Satan, demons and false prophets will send the creation to eternal damnation.    God bless you in Christ Jesus mighty name.|`|ed6dd97680f16853ceee083850fe8bd6aa	Jesus wasn't punished by three days of death.  Firstly, he died on a Friday evening and rose on a Sunday morning - so he was in the grave 36 hours. He rose on the third day.  Secondly, the punishment ended when he cried out, "It is finished!". This was before he died. He then (voluntarily) gave up his spirit. Having done so, he went to Paradise (as he said to the dying thief, "Today you will be with me in Paradise").  Finally, Jesus was a perfect man and his sacrifice was acceptable to God as the price to be paid for the sins of all mankind. Unbelievers do not go to Hell in order to pay the price for their sins - this has already been done and a just God cannot demand payment twice - they go to Hell because they reject Jesus.

In the ancient Greek city states and ancient Rome the first converts to Christianity were educated, members of the noble classes.    Naturally these sorts of people were the ones which initiated the conversion of hordes of the illiterate, and eventually built up such a huge base that they could forcibly convert the entire Roman empire to Christianity and the abolition its pagan religions (i.e. in the age of Constantine, who's wife persuaded him to convert, and his successors).

NOW GO WASH YOUR MIND OUT WITH SOAP.|`|f3nwI8ytaa	Since you like the Catholic Encyclopedia, here is its discussion of resurrection in the Old Testament:    The words of Martha and the history of the Maccabees show the Jewish belief towards the end of the Jewish economy. "I know", says Martha, "that He shall rise again, in the resurrection at the last day" (John 11:24). And the third of the Maccabee martyrs put forth his tongue and stretched out his hands, saying: "These I have from heaven, but for the laws of God I now despise them: because I hope to receive them again from him" (2 Maccabees 12:11; cf. 9:14). The Book of Daniel (12:2; cf. 12) inculcates the same belief: "Many of those that sleep in the dust of the earth, shall awake: some unto life everlasting, and others unto reproach, to see it always." The word many must be understood in the light of its meaning in other passages, e.g. Isaiah 53:11-12; Matthew 26:28; Romans 5:18-19. Though Ezechiel's vision of the resurrection of the dry bones refers directly to the restoration of Israel, such a figure would be hardly Israel, such a figure would be hardly intelligible except by readers familiar with the belief in a literal resurrection (Ezekiel 37). The Prophet Isaiah foretells that the Lord of hosts "shall cast down death headlong forever" (25:8), and a little later he adds: "Thy dead men shall live, my slain shall rise again. . . the earth shall disclose her blood, and shall cover her slain no more" (26:19-21). Finally, Job, bereft of all human comfort and reduced to the greatest desolation, is strengthened by the thought of the resurrection of his body: "I know that my Redeemer liveth, and in the last day I shall rise out of the earth. And I shall be clothed again with my skin, and in my flesh I shall see God. Whom I myself shall see, and my eyes shall behold, and not another; this hope is laid up in my bosom" (Job 19:25-27). The literal translation of the Hebrew text differs somewhat from the foregoing quotation, but the hope of resurrection remains.     Belief in eternal life is built on this confidence in the resurrection of the dead.  In addition the Hebrew concept of karet, or being cut off, is an example of belief in an afterlife.  Being cut off from one's kin applied to the next life-- in many cases the punishment is threatened for crimes not discoverable or punishable by human agency.  Nice try though.    peace|`|LjsRfaskaa	The bible and all such teachings are the result of the illusion of separateness. The Piscean age is one of individualization and labeling.

I believe that when the scripture is not really clear, you, as a Biblical scholar, go with the   scripture that is very clear.  You can't go wrong with this methodology.  The Bible teaches that there is a resurrection.  At that point, one obtains eternal life.  This whole idea of life after death is based on so much of the pagan, Greek philosophies of the early converts.

There is one that awaits you, hopes that you will come by a shred of faith, so that he may use you for the divine reason you were brought into existence.

The scriptures said that he reckoned that God could even resurrect him from the dead since he had made a covenant with him for a seed that would become a multitude. He knew God could not lie.  Titus 1:2     Hundreds of prophecies were written aforetime about Jesus and were fulfilled by him,there  in no way could this be coincidental.  But now we have the most precious gift of the entire Bible,whatever translation it may be.  And we fully can understand how prophecies were fulfilled,how Jesus died and was resurrected to heaven from the 1rst prophecy in the Bible about him at Genesesn 3:15,this is a common thread woven through the Holy Scriptures,the sacred secret that we now can understand fully.  Jesus has been resurrected to be a mighty King John 5:28,29 John 11th chapter.

AA11232725	God says that practicing homosexual sex is a sin because the word "sin" means to "miss the mark" of God's will for your life. Jesus reiterated what God's plan for human beings was and is when He came down to earth and was asked about marriage and divorce.    Matthew 19:3  Some Pharisees came to him to test him. They asked, "Is it lawful for a man to divorce his wife for any and every reason?"  4  "Haven't you read," he replied, "that at the beginning the Creator 'made them male and female,'  5  and said, 'For this reason a man will leave his father and mother and be united to his wife, and the two will become one flesh'?  6  So they are no longer two, but one. Therefore what God has joined together, let man not separate."    A person who determines in their own mind that they were born with the wrong gender and has surgery and takes hormones to make superficial changes so that they appear to be of the opposite gender is missing the mark of God's will for their life.    I'm not saying that such people don't deserve compassion and that Christians should condemn them. I'm just saying that instead of taking their troubles to God and trusting in Him to bring His will to pass, they've missed the mark by using medical techniques to further aggravate and confuse the situation.|`|LjsRfaskaa	Honestly it is just so much subjective nonsence.

We should accept Jesus as our Lord and Saviour and live according to the will of the Heavenly Father.    Read the Holy Bible Romans 10:5-9   For Moses describeth the righteousness which is of the law, That the man which doeth those things shall live by them.   But the righteousness which is of faith speaketh on this wise, Say not in thine heart, Who shall ascend into heaven? (that is, to bring Christ down from above:)   Or, Who shall descend into the deep? (that is, to bring up Christ again from the dead.)    But what saith it? The word is nigh thee, even in thy mouth, and in thy heart: that is, the word of faith, which we preach;   That if thou shalt confess with thy mouth the Lord Jesus, and shalt believe in thine heart that God hath raised him from the dead, thou shalt be saved.

Then they die, just like everyone else, and their perceptions cease.    The world keeps on spinning without them.    Eventually the Sun explodes, burning this planet to a crisp.  If humanity was not able to leave the solar system by then, all traces of our existence, minus a few satellites here or there, are erased from the universe forever.      Eventually, the universe either expands until the average temperature is absolute zero or collapses back in on itself, possibly causing a 'Big Rebound' where in all of the matter and energy in the universe is essentially recycled, causing what will appear to be another 'Big Bang' afterwards.

hdFn4Dobaa	The Crucifixion of Jesus must be understood as His taking the penalty, or curse, that each of us deserves for breaking God's law, for the fall from an intimate relationship with Him, because of sin by humanity, and  loss of Eternal life dear.  Grace is the Love of the Lord.  Jesus has came to restore and redeem our salvation.     Salvation is from sin. Salvation is the way of Life where persons are freed from the past effects of sin and freed for the love and power of God  in their lives. It is a personal reality, because the Bible talks about salvation as something available in life. But it also has a future aspect, since the saved belong to God and will be cared for by God in life after death, just as they are now.    The Bible teaches that sin is a fundamental problem. Adam and Eve wanted to be like God, and their disobedience results in death ad separation from the Lord.     To be saved means that we are forgiven for our sins and accepted by God, despite or wrong thoughts, words, and actions. When we deserve punishment, God chooses to pardon us and accept us as His sons and daughters because of Christ's death on the cross. We are also freed from the power of sin in our lives. Anyone who has wrestled directly with a significant problem knows how hard it is to overcome it quickly. In the same way, God's love helps us overcome the continuing power of sin by helping us to grow and become more loving and holy persons as we grow in our relationship to Him.    Still the act of salvation is not yet fully described because it includes our life with God. After all, we do not become automatically perfect when we become Christians. Sin still remains in our heart. Thus, we must pursue holiness in our lives. This part of our salvation, like all the other parts, both demands action on our part as well as recognition that our success in growing more like Christ is the result of a gift from God. We should pursue the Holy life, while noting that it is a work of God in our hearts.  The end result of the process is that God will bring us to Glory. We were created in the image of God, reflecting God's perfect character. When He brings us to Himself at the end of time, we will once again be restored to our original sinless state, and we will live in eternal bliss with him.    The road to heaven is a narrow one, and many will stumble and fall. Some will fall from disbelief in the Savior, Jesus the Christ. Some will fall from following false prophets, false doctrines, cults, false teachings, and the rise of the Antichrist, for he will say that he is Jesus the Christ and he shall come before Jesus returns for His  remnant people. They shall be fooled by the Antichrist, for he shall say that he is coming in peace, and will create great signs and wonders, and people shall wonder after him instead of knowing that Jesus shall come 5 - months later, in the clouds. Christians will not be gone then. Many will be afraid to face the real Christ, and will seek death, but death shall run away from them. Even some Christians shall be fooled along with non-believers. But God's Elect shall know His voice.    Many do not accept Him, therefore, they fear hell.  Believers do not fear hell, for they do not believe that is their destination. All thought of those left behind shall be wiped away, and joy and peace, and Eternal life in the presence of the Lord shall replace it.  Amen !|`|2d2ZuimCaa	Jesus blood covered the sins of those who will humble them selves after hearing Gods Word and admit to God that they are sinners deserving hell and will accept his " Free Gift " of eternal salvation by accepting him as their savior.|`|8pQrIL90aa	You must accept the LORD, and you must stop being GOD over your own lives. Though we believe ourselves to be in control, we are under control by something much more pwoerful than we care to believe.    Jesus died to save us from the fate that the devil and his angels shall suffer. How can one say to a GOD that they are fit to live in his presence, yet they refuse to come in by the terms of his service?     Our Lord died so that MAN could become a new and improved model, unlike the first adam, but better in the sense that we know evil, and now we know never to do what is wrong, nor let temptation overtake us.|`|AA11521494	Because we still have to believe in it or it doesn't have any effect, apparently.|`|OT4SrmDXaa	cause he died for who ever would believe in him.

I am not saying I do and I'm not saying I don't believe, but what I am saying is I don't know what I believe, I can't lie and say I don't believe in God, cuz I don't know that either, I only know, I'm un-sure if he exists, in my own mind. I'm just being honest with myself and God, if he's up there and who knows maybe that will chock me up a few brownie points for being able to not continue to lie to myself and him, thinking I'm pulling one over on someone, I am only saying what's in my head, I Don't Know for sure about God, I WILL say I sure hope there is a God, cuz if we've gone thru all this for nothing, that will really piss me off, but then again, I won't know nothing to get pissed off about cuz I'll be six feet under and won't know anything if there's no God, cuz I won't be upstairs OR downstairs, my mind & body will be no more to worry about which ever truths exist, God or Evolution.....|`|7mhRDbvsaa	you know when your younger and older kids would tell you something ridcioulsy untrue and that would make you so scared...

Also I can't get my head around that his "dying" has absolved the sins of all future generations, before they have committed the sins, despite the fact that they will certainly continue to commit sins.  Sorry, have I confused you.  I find it hard to articulate something that I have absolutely no way of comprehending.  I've tried, it just doesn't make a scrap of sense|`|009wtvVeaa	because by Jesus dying on the cross he did his part, now its up to us humans to determine whether or not we accept Jesus as our lord and savior and go to heaven.

No way around it, through, over or under it.  Humanity is on this side of the wall and paradise on the other side. Each brick in the wall is a sin committed by man against the will of God.  Jesus Christ comes along and makes a door through the wall.  He tells folks about it, sends others to tell the whole world about it.  Some believe some scoff,  some say:  "Where ?  I dont see any door.  Some deny there is a wall or a door or anything on the other side.  Know what I'm sayin?        When Jesus lived without sin and died on the cross He did make a door.  He even said:  "I am the door".  He also said:  "I am the way the truth and life.  No man cometh unto The Father but by Me."  There is only one door !  In Rev, The Lamb says to the Church of Philadelphia:  "I know thy works, you have a little strength.  I have set before thee an open door which no man can shut.  You have kept my word and NOT DENIED MY NAME."   Folks of the Trinitarian persuasion think they have two more doors.  Sorry, they're all locked up.  Know what I'm sayin?       Now forget about the wall.  The Love, Grace and Salvation of God is come to the world in the Name of Jesus Christ.  His blood is "coin of the realm" to pay the debt of sin we owe to God.  We collect it when we are baptised in His Name and recieve His Spirit.  Rev 1:5 "Unto Him who loved us and washed us from our sins in His own blood"   and   Rev 7:14  "These are they who washed their robes and made them white in the blood of The Lamb"  John the baptist seeing Jesus approaching said:  "Behold, The Lamb of God who taketh away the sins of the world"  Hope this helps answer your question.

JRlMmO4Qaa	A major part of the problem is with the method of interpretation. What most churches seem to all agree on is dismissing how the Bible declares we are supposed to understand it, in favor of using their man-made methods.    Two fundamental rules the Bible declares we must follow if we are to come to a correct spiritual understanding are:    1) Christ spoke in parables, and without a parable He did not speak.     Christ is the spiritual author of the Bible, as John 1 declares, so we must look for the deeper spiritual meaning in every verse throughout the whole Bible, including the OT.    2) We must compare spiritual things with spiritual, or Scripture with Scripture.    Unless we take everything into consideration the Bible gives us regarding any particular subject before drawing any conclusions, it is very easy to come to an incomplete, or completely wrong, understanding. God has written the Bible in such a way that we have to diligently search out answers from His Word, not just take a few a verses out of context and believe we have found truth.|`|2K2QyLJCaa	The reason there are so many different interpretations has nothing to do with any changes that have made to the sacred text. Let's start with that.     The only interpretations of the Bible that mankind has been given have come through the doctrines of religion, over 1500 years of religious iniquity.    What is missing from these religious interpretations is the holy spirit, the spirit of truth, through which Jesus taught, providing us with a spiritual interpretation of scripture, which he protected by speaking in parables, preserving it through a symbolic code, sealed until the "end of days," allowing these erroneous man-made doctrines of religion to run their course.    Every story in the Old Testament contains symbolic meaning, revealing a spiritual truth that will bring unity, removing the divisions caused through the conjured doctrines of religion.    Pretty ingenious if you ask me.     In 1975 I began an indepth study of the Bible. I have no religion, and prefer not to call my self a christian because of the doctrines embraced by todays christianity. In 1998 I began receiving what would be a 7-year-long revelation of the symbolic code of the Bible.     I have spent the past 10 years compiling this revelation (1998-2005) and the revelations of my mentor (1960-1993) into two books for anyone that is interested.|`|ckLlUQfMaa	He didn't, Satan did.

God's kingdom is a government not a religion. That's all Jesus spoke about was HIs Father's Kingdom.|`|AA11232725	The majority of the Bible, especially the gospel message, is agreed upon by all Christian denominations.    The passages that are disputed are mostly prophetic passages. God made the main things the plain things in the Bible and anyone who just reads what it says without trying to impose their own preconceived notions upon the text can find the way of salvation in the Bible.    God doesn't take away people's ability to think and reason and make mistakes. Instead, He sends his Spirit to make people His children when they are born again. If they don't understand everything written in the Bible correctly it isn't going to stop them from being with their Heavenly Father for all eternity.    It isn't like Saint Peter is at the pearly gates with a big Bible in his hands asking departed Saints to answer questions and if they don't get them right they can't enter.    John 1:12  But as many as received Him, to them He gave the right to become children of God, to those who believe in His name:  13  who were born, not of blood, nor of the will of the flesh, nor of the will of man, but of God.    Ephesians 1:3  Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, who has blessed us with every spiritual blessing in the heavenly places in Christ,  4  just as He chose us in Him before the foundation of the world, that we should be holy and without blame before Him in love,  5  having predestined us to adoption as sons by Jesus Christ to Himself, according to the good pleasure of His will,  6  to the praise of the glory of His grace, by which He made us accepted in the Beloved.    Ephesians 1:13  In Him you also trusted, after you heard the word of truth, the gospel of your salvation; in whom also, having believed, you were sealed with the Holy Spirit of promise,  14  who is the guarantee of our inheritance until the redemption of the purchased possession, to the praise of His glory.|`|D9lMg7A2aa	We had the answer for 1600 years, the Catholic Church, and there it is still standing, still saying the obvious thing, that the Bible is not a matter of Private Interpretation. But you seem to give evidence of what the real problem is. You suspect there is a One Church founded by Jesus, and that everybody doing their own thing can't be right, but you just aren't going to give Catholicism a chance.    Why not just see without commitment.    "There are not more than 100 people in the world who truly hate the Catholic Church, but there are millions who hate what they perceive to be the Catholic Church."

And it doesn't.    God wants us to have faith in Him, not knowledge of Him. The message in the bible is very clear and basic-it's just that people have a habit of making verses say what it doesn't say.    So what if God didn't debrief Moses with the process of evolution and of the universe. Just because much about science isn't in the bible doesn't make the bible false or science false.    People are too narrow-minded regarding God and science. I accept both, because I take the words of the bible at face-value as well as scientific theories.    Edit: I respect your beliefs, but if you take a look at biblical verses with an unbiased mind, you will see that its face-value is quite simple in understanding. Throughout the ages, people have interpreted verses to say what it actually doesn't say. Whether God's Word is allegorical in nature or literal, the true message is that God exists and is all-powerful and that He sent a Messiah to give us salvation. Everything else is subject to debate because of varied interpretations of verses.|`|Xg1ZR4ptaa	Revelation 22:18-9    "For I testify unto every man that heareth the words of the prophecy of this book, If any man shall add unto these things, God shall add unto him the plagues that are written in this book: And if any man shall take away from the words of the book of this prophecy, God shall take away his part out of the book of life, and out of the holy city, and [from] the things which are written in this book."      if you add or take away from the Bible...thats bad. it warns us about this.|`|719261d758e0cebf5beeb6101b21166faa	Notice how many arrogant little podlings claim that TRUE Christians have no problem understanding it?

If they did, they'd know better than to make such  stupid assertion.|`|OhhKRahTaa	Have you ever considered that there might not be any God? Because I have you know.|`|XN0cYCATaa	The reason there are different denominations within Christianity is because the Bible allows for us to have differences of opinions. Within Christianity there are very few essential doctrines that define what it means to be a Christian. These essential doctrines are,     Jesus is both God and man (John 1:1,14; 8:24; Col. 2:9; 1 John 4:1-4).   Jesus rose from the dead physically (John 2:19-21; 1 Cor. 15:14).   Salvation is by grace through faith (Rom. 5:1; Eph. 2:8-9; Gal. 3:1-2; 5:1-4).   The gospel is the death, burial, and resurrection of Jesus (1 Cor. 15:1-4; Gal. 1:8-9).   There is only one God (Exodus 20:3; Isaiah 43:10; 44:6,8).   God exists as a Trinity of persons:  Father, Son, and Holy Spirit. (See Trinity).   Jesus was born of the Virgin Mary (nature of incarnation)   As long as a church believes in these essential doctrines, then it is Christian. However, there are many things in the scriptures that have been interpreted in different ways. For example, what day of the week should be worship on, Saturday or Sunday? Should we baptize by sprinkling or baptize by immersion? Do we take communion every Sunday, once a month, or once a year? The answers to these questions do not affect whether or not someone is a Christian. It is in these issues, and others like them, that denominations are formed. It does not mean that one denomination contradicts another. It means that though they agree in the essentials, they differ in some nonessentials. This is permitted in Scripture:     "Now accept the one who is weak in faith, but not for the purpose of passing judgment on his opinions. 2 One man has faith that he may eat all things, but he who is weak eats vegetables only. 3 Let not him who eats regard with contempt him who does not eat, and let not him who does not eat judge him who eats, for God has accepted him. 4 Who are you to judge the servant of another? To his own master he stands or falls; and stand he will, for the Lord is able to make him stand. 5 One man regards one day above another, another regards every day alike. Let each man be fully convinced in his own mind," (Rom. 14:1-5).   Sadly, there is another reason for denominational differences and that is the failure of Christians to live according to the will of God. The truth is that we are all sinners and we do not see things eye to eye. It is an unfortunate truth that denominational differences are due to our shortsightedness and lack of love. But, the good thing is that God loves us so much that He puts up with our failures. There waits for us, in spite of our differences, a great reward in heaven. Neither salvation nor damnation is dependent upon our differences.  Our salvation is based on our relationship with Christ.|`|rTplTuEdaa	There is only  truth in God,s word,and we must be spirit lead to     understand it,,that,s why some can not see the truth.|`|2JbCMKNAaa	He didn't...God gave born again believers' the help of the Holy Spirit to understand His word.

The Bible says "its not in man to direct his own path" Read for your self and study.......|`|pSNSlRlRaa	The important part of the Bible is simple.    Repent, get baptized and live for God through Jesus, by loving God and your neighbor just as Jesus loved you.    Then grow to maturity.    The rest of the symbols and prophesies, can only be interpreted correctly by true prophets, by Holy Spirit.    To find out who is right, one has to pray over the matter and wait for Holy Spirit to convict you one way or the other.    Matthew 11:25..Jesus said in response: "I publicly praise you, Father, Lord of heaven and earth, because you have hidden these things from the wise and intellectual ones and have revealed them to babes."    So, most men are merely guessing at God's secret messages.|`|yxIzm2dqaa	You have stated an excellent question.  I  would choose to say that there is one interpretation and many applications.  Beyond this you have the issue of personality of the individual that impacts how one responds to the Scriptures. As to mortal jeopardy the issue of sin and salivation is very clear.  Beyond this it seems to me that God allows for a great deal of freedom in how man responds to God.|`|0fd6c9cd983b835b83ca7be549d67540aa	my opinion is some verses are meant to be taken a certain way at that time for your encouraging. example: the verse saying "being  made perfect in love cast out fear" at the time i read this verse i was in an abusive relationship, i was just a teen, young and dumb. i thought he cared so much for me and that's why he did what he did out of anger. this scripture told me, me and him wasn't in perfect love caused i feared him. well now i look at the verse and it tells me if im made perfect in God's love, i wont have the fear of hell, i know exactly where im going when i die.|`|rtFkwelQaa	God did not leave the Bible open to different interpretations.  There is only one correct one.  The Bible even says that it interprets itself.  Most people do not read the entire context of most passages. That's the  main reason they get so many misinterpretations.  God would never try to confuse us.    Satan on the other hand is the master of deception.  He is the one we get all of the other misinterpretations. Some people caim they are followers of God, but at the same time live very sinful lives.  These are the people whom the devil works on.  He is the one who gives them the false interpretations.  They inturn go out into the world to decieve many.     If you are truly studing your Bible and praying with a sincere heart that God will reveal its meaning to you, then and only then will you fully understand what the Bible is teaching.
OKClYfDQaa	God makes no mistake. See Psalms. 18:30  Angels did; humans did. See Ezekiel 28:15; Ecclesiastes 7:29    God doesn't know what humans nor angels would think. See Jeremiah 7:31. Originally, the rule of procreation is "after his kind" (Genesis 1:24-25), which "God saw that it was good"; but when God deemed their numbers to be enough (Revelations 5:11), He ruled out that "they neither marry, nor are given in marriage, . . . as the angels of God in heaven" (Matthew 22:30). But when the angels -- "the sons of God saw the daughters of men that they were fair; . . .they took them wives of all which they chose" (Genesis 6:2). God "maketh his angels spirits", and co-habitation with humans is contrary to the universal decree echoed in creation to reproduce after his kind.    God doesn't know that which doesn't exist. See Isaiah 44:8.   Something not thought doesn't exist; that's why God didn't know what was going to happen then. See Jeremiah 7:31. God could tell the result of the choice; but not the choice to be made. See Deuteronomy 30:19.    The hybrid offspring "also is flesh" (Genesis 6:3) whose days were limited by God to be only "a hundred and twenty years."

The love which remains even when things change, things sag, your partner gets on your nerves etc. It is a logical love as well as an emotional love. But there is still the emotion driving it that this one person completes you, that no one could be better for you, and you make each other better people.|`|7212e5e7136740e7fd7cc2e16f98a96aaa	When you feel like you will die if your not around them and it does not go away.|`|HAHDipTAaa	Being in love with some one means that you put there needs before your own and that you would give your life for them without question.

What it took for me was continuous questioning; not just about other people's beliefs, but also my own belief in the idea that there is no God. It may sound like a dizzying process, but that's because it was, and still is.     A lot of the answers I got from other atheists left me with more questions than before. In general, their answers about life added up to "God doesn't exist, humans can reason out any situation, so enjoy life while you can". Well, I tried that. I partook in a lot of awesome experiences that the world has to offer, and some not-so-great events as well. At the end of the day, I was still frustrated by my fulfillment deficiency.     My secular perspective just left me hollow and depressed, when my atheist friends claimed that the idea of no God was liberating. In high school, my cousin started inviting me to a youth group that he was going to. At first I didn't want to, since I thought I had Christianity all figured out, but I concluded that I might as well make my cousin happy, even if I'm not.     That visit, and the youth groups that followed, showed me a perspective that not only welcomes questioning, but one that also shows us that there is Someone who answers. I was flabbergasted at how happy these people were, despite the fact that some of them were worse off than I was. Granted, our lives weren't perfectly blissful, but they had this fulfillment that I knew nothing of.    I still ask questions about my new-found faith in God, but there's no way I'm going back to being an atheist.|`|8YUtmEU7aa	To be honest, I don't know, for sure.

In fact right love does not need anything but only feelings of right. Where love is high, there selfishness is Low. Just only faith is not enough to be right. We need real Evidence. Right..?  So,   Spiritually,   What is God?  Whats makes God as god?    Well, just try to know, whats makes God as god, the Power, isnt it? So what the power can do? Ah? Well, it can give the ability to organise all things & it can give the ability to separate everything & most importantly, the Ability to control everything, isnt it? Isnt it good? Ah? So, from our hard study & research effort with the help from god, we realized that the ability to control everything, the Power of God is gradually increased in the full amount to use so; The Power of God is always the omnipotent & existed among everything. & The God now is always the same omnipotent for us, who is organised us & we are growing towards perfection. The perfection is the final stage, not the end. & The Power of God, the Ability is the reward for us to control everything in a proper manner, like the true God of goodness. & Everlasting Happiness is the final stage. & it cannot come alone without the final stage perfection of God. & if god always perfect in perfection then there have to be beginning with God for the organizing progress of all things. So, there is No end & also No beginning for all things, including this on going organizing progress. So, we cannot get anything from nothing. All are energy. E=MC2     If you dont still agree,   Note  this:  you can use any thing for Good or Bad so, whenever possible If you ask the god for the good reason to give you the ability perfection, because of your obedience, then the God will give you, if the god is Almighty.       If you are humble, Please, Pray to know the truth from true God by the inspiration of the Holy Spirit with great faith. Good or bad, Good with bad. God gave us the rights to do what is right for you & sometimes, things can be right in your point of view but wrong in Public point of view so Basically, we & god can do anything for right reason but just pray about it for the Good Answer and try to do the God's will first always.    Just think, why so much trouble & pain in this world? Then there is only one reason, without pain, no pleasure, without them, we cannot enjoy this life so always we need them. You use pain & pleasure instead of, they use you. You have to be certain to win in order to succeed in your Best job. If possible, keep the photo of your vision. The vision of your future should be clear & feel it strong enough in your visualizing mind & your desire for success should be greater than your fear of failure. & Love is the Ability. When we do repetitive actions somehow our State of mind has to be new as we did the first action. & we all make mistakes so it is hard to look for star in daylight. So just in faith, it is possible. Like that the faith in true God. Because of Lack of faith in true God, we do not have the great gift of understanding of things. All things are spiritually first, to govern by God with glory. Have a look at this world of wonders of yours & then you know the truth, when you listen to your real voice. & having a strong desire to do the best every day then stick with the best to do your best & most importantly, try to be grateful for what you have now to get out of fear & doing your best & making good people as a powerful influential person / leader, this is going to make your life winning.    The Law of mercy cannot rob the Law of justice so Justice demands the punishment of our sin but The Law of mercy requires the forgiveness to give to us & God is perfect in perfection so cannot violate his laws so The God provided the way to our salvation to overcome our sin so Jesus Christ sacrifice is much needed to return to live with God, so Jesus Christ is our savior.    Did you make the commitment to find joy in every moment by using your empowering meanings & conscious focus for the needs of your five senses?  Did you make this promise; I will never going to settle less than I can be?

Long before there was a yahoo, I have pondered this question.  My first instinct is to say that I want tangible evidence.  To be able to touch and feel the hand of God.  But in a world of trickery, I'm sure that there is some tv preacher already working on this, and will soon be on sale for $24.95.      Then I thought maybe that the God who loves us so much, could do something less tangible like sprouting crops in Africa to feed the hungry.  Or water to spring up in all those countries where this is a problem.    But finally I have decided.  And for God, I am thinking that this shouldn't be that hard.  To make all the religious leaders in the world who are not speaking the truth to suddenly become unable to speak.  I wish no harm to come them, just if they speak for God, let them continue to speak and if they don't, remain permanently quiet.

Hope that helps.|`|7d84621e89c49bcba037226d3361c90baa	To be honest, I'm not sure exactly what it would take. I guess I'd know it when I saw it. It would have to be something more substantial than someone else telling me they "feel him in their heart".    To borrow from Ebon's musings, who words it much better than I, some things that could HELP convince me that there is a God:  1) Verified, specific prophecies that couldn't have been contrived. So-called prophesies that are vague, unclear or garbled don't count. They must be detailed, specific and unambiguous in their prediction and wording. It can't be for something trivial, or be something that is self-fulfilling. It has to be verifiable, and the writing of the prophesy HAS to be proven to have preceded the event.  2) Scientific knowledge in holy books that wasn't available at the time.  That means a piece of knowledge that the people of the time couldn't possibly have known but that is now known to be true. What if Jesus had said something like this?   "Verily, verily, I say unto thee that thine energy is as thine mass times the speed of light multiplied unto itself."  (Of course people of the time would have been baffled, but just imagine how many souls it would have saved today!)  3) Miraculous occurrences, especially if brought about through prayer.  If a hospital did a double-blind study to determine if intercessory prayer helps the sick, and it was discovered that only the patients prayed for by members of a certain religion experienced a dramatic, statistically significant increase in recovery rate, and this result could be repeated and confirmed, I would convert. A lone success after a thousand failures does not count, no matter how miraculous it seems.  4) Any direct manifestation of the divine.  I'll be happy to believe in God if he tells me to in person, as long as he does it in such a way that I could be sure that it was not a hallucination (for example, in the presence of multiple reliable witnesses, none of which are in a highly emotional or otherwise altered state).   Those are some examples of things that could help convince me.     Things that do NOT convince me are things like:  Speaking in tongues or other pseudo-miracles.  People's conversion stories.  Any subjective experience. ("I feel him in my heart")  Quoting scripture.   The Bible Code or similar numerological feats  Any form of Pascal's wager. ("What have you got to lose?")  Creationism of any sort  "God of the gaps". ("I don't understand how else this could have happened, and scientists haven't explained it yet, so that's proof that GOD did it!")  Threats of punishment for non-belief.  Insults. ("A fool says in his heart 'there is no God' ")    Every single thing I have EVER seen so far in "favor" of God has fallen under the second category.  (The "Things that would NOT convince me" category.)|`|ttTDiJWfaa	A lack of censorship and character assasination from Xians?|`|IHa6FxE6aa	There is no God or Jesus. The Bible is fiction.

WsdFOGKMaa	Over and above all the very good replies - what has made me wonder about the state of our country is who was it that went to the management of the BBC and actually said "I have overhead of racist comment and I am offended by it".    This is what the BBC is saying happened - that someone was offended and the fact that CT did not apologise. For this she is sacked. I am no fan of Carol Thatcher - but I am a fan of a free country and the UK is rapidly turning into a fascist state.     The thought and speech police are hot on the trail of the soft targets that speak out because they are not attempting to offend anyone and therefore have nothing to feel protective about.     If I was to hear a comment that offended me - I would either move away from that person or if I felt strongly enough about it - I would say so to the speaker. I would NOT run to the persons employer and demand that they lose their jobs.     What adult acts in that way ........ other than informants such as those that undermined the allied forces in WWII? And these people are nothing but cowards and petty non-entities.

The book's main characters were two Dutch dolls, Peg and Sarah Jane, and the Golliwogg. The story begins with Peg and Sara Jane, on the loose in a toy shop, encountering "a horrid sight, the blackest gnome." The little black "gnome" wore bright red trousers, a red bow tie on a high collared white shirt, and a blue swallow-tailed coat. He was a caricature of American black faced minstrels - in effect, the caricature of a caricature. She named him Golliwogg.    It was meant to be insulting attacking the black skin of black people.  If we created dolls and called them 'aggots; the gays would find them offensive.  The history of the golligwog was meant to be racist
Q6qyfPkRaa	Good One B!    And based on the answers of the atheists that posted.. they are sooo hypocritical( i am rofl rite now) why?  b/c they used most of the same reasons/explanantions we use for why we KNOW that GOD exists and then they say whatever... hah good one i say..... Love exists my azz! Sorry all, love does exist, as does GOD i was just solidfying my point!    Edit: felt love??- we feel GOD and his spirit.. prove we dont!           know its real? well prove it. WE know GOd is real and u all attempt to make us prove it.  That chemical one is priceless? sertonin , oxytonin etc etc... nice try ... Use medical devices to measure  believers neurological, emotional, and endocrine or hormonal responses when GOD is mentioned to us and i m sure you will get varying results with all that good stuff u mentioned you get when love is measured!   I wish one atheist would just admit love is real b/c they believe in it.. that would be too easy....     Relax though, im just helping B prove the point, and a very good one it is!     Lastly ppl, LOVE exist b/c GOD is love and with that said and using your own logic against u.. I would have to say that GOD EXISTS!!!!!!

To objectively verify love for someone, one must devise a concrete definition for what love means. Psychologists have already done this for us with the triangular theory of love (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triangular_... ).    Your refusal to acknowledge any of the evidence provided in response to your question exposes your insincerity and bias; your unwillingness to refute demonstrates your lack of ability to do so.    Now, may I see your evidence for God?|`|hRkeUn5Taa	Love is not a thing in itself but a blanket term for a combination of psychological processes. It's only our powers of reason that have named  these factors collectively as Love.   However, the group-survival mentality, the mating-selection process and the natural manifestation of altruism are all gifts from nature - and evident most immediately in dolphins, bonobos and other primates. Human success has relied in part on the stream-lining of these naturally occurring traits - to the extent that we are as inquisitive about what makes us 'human' now, as we were 40,000 years ago.|`|1tccQF3gaa	The things is, and this is the biggy here, no one is attempting to prove love exists independently of living beings never mind is responsible for the existence of the entire universe. were anyone to suggest that i would scoff at the idea the same as i do at the idea "god" is responsible    p.s it is polite and courteous to treat the answers you get to the question YOU asked with respect.

Romans 13:10  Love worketh no ill to his neighbour: therefore love is the fulfilling of the law.    Galatians 5:14  For all the law is fulfilled in one word, even in this; Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself.    Love is an action not a feeling as the lost world likes to label it. If you do no wrong to a person, then you have fulfilled the law.    1 Corinthians 4:18-21  18Now some are puffed up, as though I would not come to you.   19But I will come to you shortly, if the Lord will, and will know, not the speech of them which are puffed up, but the power.   20For the kingdom of God is not in word, but in power.   21What will ye? shall I come unto you with a rod, or in love, and in the spirit of meekness?|`|EAuMJrs4aa	people feel it towards one another and show it in outward ways only to unobservant individual cant read its signs, but god and love are two different things so......    no answer we give will satisfy you your trying to liken god to an emotion, however that humans have emotions is proven already god is not    youre going to get a snickers?get me one i ll email the money :P|`|YZv8Ub3Haa	Do you really don't understand the difference between "can't physically see right now" and "no evidence ever"?

If love did not exist people and animals would behave differently; they would not show signs of affection to other people or animals, but would treat them only with indifference or aggression. In short, we know love exists because we can observe its effects.    In contrast, theists cannot point to any thing or effect that is unequivocally caused by God.|`|RrVr9Bwfaa	So you don't believe anything you can't see?

The brain is the dope dealer and love is the drug.|`|uz9GtV9vaa	You can't just tell them about the chemicals in the brain responsible for the love reaction, you have to give examples that it works the way you claim it does by examining couples in a controlled environment.  Since it's almost impossible, and at the very least prohibitively expensive, this evidence doesn't exist therefore atheists have an excuse to discount the value of love, not its existence.|`|KmnbjZIdaa	It is my belief that you cannot prove that a person loves you since you cannot see what is in his heart.  But based on how that persons treats you with care and affection, you can have a reasonable faith, that the person love you.  Atheists cannot accept anything by faith, so they have a real problem in obtaining evidence of a person's love for another.|`|AA11969509	I don't have to prove love exists.  It sure seems likely given all the people I have seen that appear to have been in love.  Of course theoretically they may have all been faking it, but that doesn't seem likely.  On the other hand people who say they have felt the presence of God disagree with one another.  Some people feel he is Allah, others that he is the Christian God.  Others claim other things.  From talking with them, I get the strong feeling that they are just imagining it.|`|aPuUuWlLaa	Quite easily. Most obviously by the outcomes, a person who truly loves someone will act in ways consistent with this that are directly observable. Secondly, biochemically. The biochemicals responsible for love are known and can actually be measured in the brain. Third, experiments with these biochemicals show that love can be induced or inhibited through manipulation of these biochemicals. For example, if you block the natural release of oxytocin in sheep and rats, they will reject and refuse to nurture their own young. If you induce it though in a female rat that is childless it will eagerly bond with and care for young that is not its own.|`|KVirP3bsaa	Evidence. There is evidence that love exists. If you have loved someone or have had someone love you, that is a form of evidence for the emotion we call love. How else do you think we would go about defining the emotion and calling it love if it did not manifest in us?     Just because you can not see something does not mean there isn't evidence for it.  However in the case of god, he not only can not be seen, but there is not even any evidence to support his existence.|`|Gj0zOqTyaa	Love is an emotion caused by chemical releases in the brain.  You inhibit hormone production and you remove love.  It is scientific, not spiritual.  Basic neuroscience.    To be more precise, there are many chemicals involved in the different stages of attraction and feelings.  Seretonin and oxytocin are important for 'love'.  Seretonin is also related to OCD, which is why it is common for people in love not to be able to think of anyone else.  OCD drugs can mess with people ability to love.    *edit*  Guy far below me - I never said that love does not exist.  By all means it does.  I was simply explaining its existance.  Much as endorphins can be used to explain a feeling of rapture.|`|gBoUrlrKaa	Everyone feels love. Somehow, only people who have been brainwashed feel gods presence...|`|wL2AnT6Waa	please stop embarrassing yourself , love is the result of bio-chemicals like every other emotion in our brain .

It's an evolutionary adaptation to solve the commitment problem. Love is a fact, and so is the evolutionary problems it helps to solve.

I am religious, and its based on what the bible says in just a few verses.     Atheist are religious as well. They live under rules and creeds just like we do. They come here really to find reason for what they believe. The logical mind shall die and decay back to the earth, and the soul shall be stuck with all that it learned, it shall report to GOD, and your thoughts, words and actions shall be your own judge against you.    But we are not the enemy. I am not no mans enemy. I do not blame the atheist for what he claims to believe. I think that we all were atheist before we came to the LORD.

AA11156135	No one to date has proved macro-evolution. The proponents promote the idea that you just have to take it on faith.    Facts the evolutionists don't like to talk about:  1. absence of certain fossils CAN be the result of inadequate numbers of living species of that type for that time period. Tectonic plate shifts and subduction means some earth has been lost forever.  2. The 'laws' of ancient dating is contingent upon our current understanding, - and we just infer it was the same back then.  3. Macro-evolution is counter-intuitive. Like from an eel to a fish, - every 1/millionth of an increment from whipper tail to legs had to be net beneficial to a species. With preservation of calories, defense, or re-production. (The math just doesn't work out)  4. Irreducible complexity. For an eel to grow a hip, and successfully propagate that to its offspring requires bones, muscles, nerves, brain (real estate), - generated all at once. (And to find a conducive 'mate' where the offspring don't become 'sterile'.)  5. Bio-diversity, - I look out my back door here near D.C., and I can't tell you why there's 8 different trees types growing in the natural woods here. Wouldn' you think that after millions of years, - one tree type would be slightly better than the rest, - and push out all the others?|`|PjwWWMu4aa	No missing link? What exactly is Australopithecus afarensis then?    I suppose you could justify the comment by saying that the moment they are found, they are not missing any more, they're just links.    You're kind of half right with your mockery of why certain species live concurrently with their different descendants. Its really quite simple. A well adapted species is using most of the available resources in a given area, and still growing. So some part of the species must move on - the place they find might not be as suitable, and they adapt through natural selection to fill the new niche. And so on.    How can I prove evolution?

Second, the "theory of evolution" refers to the modern evolutionary synthesis, which is the current scientific explanation for why these changes|`|mMPjXbvcaa	Congratulations, you have a preschool understanding of evolution.|`|cNniG2L0aa	Uneducated fundie make my flesh crawl.  ~|`|AA11503678	There are lots of illogical theories Darwinists believe in.

You do know that you can be an Atheist and not believe the theory of evolution, right?  Oh, I know, it is so funny how you link the both together all the time, and by the way, evolution makes perfect sense,  I won't explain it in a scientific way, but more like this.  There are million beyond millions of species of animals on this planet,  some look very similar and some look strange and very bizare to us humans,  however, you can see that every animal has adapted to it's environment flawlessly,  how weird would it be to think that these animals have adapted to their environment over time to stay alive and not become extinct?  I know, sounds crazy right?    To make the claim for the scientific truth of evolution in this way is to assert nothing about how it might occur. Darwin provides one answer (through natural selection), but others have been suggested, too (including some which see a divine agency at work in the transforming process). The above argument is intended, however, to demonstrate that the general principle of evolution is, given the scientific evidence, logically unassailable and that, thus, the concept is a law of nature as truly established as is, say, gravitation.  That scientific certainty makes the widespread rejection of evolution in our modern age something of a puzzle (but that's a subject for another essay).  In a modern liberal democracy, of course, one is perfectly free to reject that conclusion, but one is not legitimately able to claim that such a rejection is a reasonable scientific stance.|`|nVCf8EC5aa	The ones that evolved obviously lived in different climates and had to compete against different set backs to survive.

What we see today are the modern descendants of earlier species.    "Did some choose to evolve and then others just like the way they were" - - - An organism does not make a conscious decision to evolve, evolution is driven by adaptation to a given environment, the more suited an organism is to its environment the more likely it is to survive and produce offspring.

Even the "living fossil" coelacanth is different to the fossils found - the species that exists today is significantly smaller than its ancestors and none of the larger species still exist.    We'll essentially always have missing links simply because fossilisation of animals is a rare event since most are eaten or simply rot and leave no remains.  There are a few notable "links" between groups like reptiles and birds (archaeopteryx) and between fish and amphibians (tiktaalak).

The human mind works within the perimeters of the permutations and combination or synthesis achievable by the various data the five senses of human beings collect, from its empirical existence. The five senses of human beings unfortunately are imperfect in all respect and therefore their conclusions also are imperfect including what I conclude right now. Therefore, all conclusions and results obtained and proved at the level of understanding and knowledge in the material plane of consciousness is subject to change and not conclusive but accepted as finite by the science.

Though it may look absurd for the ignorant, the fact is that according to the Karma, rebirths have to take place as human beings or animals or birds or plants and other living beings until the higher level of consciousness is achieved through human birth.  If human birth is not properly used to achieve the purpose of Birth i.e. Moksha or Salvation or redemption or whatever you call it;  the soul recycles itself to lower animals according to Vasna or inherent desires.            Therefore, animals and birds and plants in combination with the higher consciousness of human beings live side by side and their continuity are maintained in co-existence.
cNniG2L0aa	I do not fight against invisible sky critters if that is what you're attempting to infer.  No one I know fights against invisible sky critters.  It's a foolish venture.  Would I fight against pink unicorns,Thor, Tooth fairy, elves or goblins?  Of course I wouldn't.    BUT, I will fight against the followers of these illusions who say that their 'god' gives them all sortsa permissions to do any damn thing they want to the rest of us ... in 'his' name.  Y'all are really scary.  ~|`|EAuMJrs4aa	If I were to suggest that between the Earth and Mars there is a china teapot revolving about the sun in an elliptical orbit, nobody would be able to disprove my assertion provided I were careful to add that the teapot is too small to be revealed even by our most powerful telescopes. But if I were to go on to say that, since my assertion cannot be disproved, it is an intolerable presumption on the part of human reason to doubt it, I should rightly be thought to be talking nonsense. If, however, the existence of such a teapot were affirmed in ancient books, taught as the sacred truth every Sunday, and instilled into the minds of children at school, hesitation to believe in its existence would become a mark of eccentricity and entitle the doubter to the attentions of the psychiatrist in an enlightened age or of the Inquisitor in an earlier time.---bertrand russell    The reason organized religion merits outright hostility is that, unlike belief in Russell's teapot, religion is powerful, influential, tax-exempt and systematically passed on to children too young to defend themselves. Children are not compelled to spend their formative years memorizing loony books about teapots. Government-subsidized schools don't exclude children whose parents prefer the wrong shape of teapot. Teapot-believers don't stone teapot-unbelievers, teapot-apostates, teapot-heretics and teapot-blasphemers to death. Mothers don't warn their sons off marrying teapot-shiksas whose parents believe in three teapots rather than one. People who put the milk in first don't kneecap those who put the tea in first.--- richard dawkins    edit:and i quote"the absence of evidence is not the same as evidence of absence"  okay fair enough but when someone makes an unproven claim like that there is a god for example the burden of proof is with the person making the claim, it is not for the rationalist to prove the rational|`|YZv8Ub3Haa	It amazes me that people believe that the harm caused by religion does not exist.|`|PjwWWMu4aa	Not really.

However, the same thing is true of leprechauns, unicorns, goblins, and the like. Seemingly rational adults eschew belief in fairy tale characters and they still feel certain that there are gods. Perhaps fairy tale characters have not been as successful at associating themselves with our ignorance. Another problem for believers is that science is progressing. Every year new scientific discoveries take some of the mystery out of the world. Intense storms that seemed to strike at random a century ago, for example, we now understand as hurricanes and tropical storms that meteorologists can track and predict with life-saving accuracy. Every year, then, the part of the world that needs explaining by a god gets smaller. The gap is rapidly shrinking, with no end in sight.|`|zkETPA8waa	A: It's atheistS. Note the 's' on the end.

Why is that so difficult for simpletons such as yourself to understand?    EDIT: Nonsense. We don't care what you lot believe. When you try to enforce your beliefs and deny human rights or mess up education based on those beliefs, then it's you who's in the wrong.

Atheists are generally more concerned about the freedom to choose their own path which they must often struggle for in the face of Christian opposition.    If Christian's just said "do what you want, since you're not a Christian" then there would not really be a problem.

If I send a week away from Yahoo Answers, religion never crosses my mind.  Further, despite the dangers of religion, I do not advocate it's removal from society.

We reject the idea of deities, we don't battle them or anything as ridiculous as that.    Secondly, the absence of evidence thing doesn't really work when you have absolutely zero evidence to support your idea.  I could use the same argument to suggest that invisible pink unicorns rule the universe and the claim would be just as valid as the idea that a deity created everything.  You couldn't disprove it either.    Your claim that atheists are god hating busybodies is completely unfounded.  In reality, atheists are a minority that seem to be some of the few who actually care about keeping religion out of the government and judicial system because we can simply look at countries like Saudi Arabia and Sudan to see where that leads.    What makes me laugh the most about this claim though is the fact that all atheists have to do is put up a few adverts saying "Hey there's probably no gods, just get on with your life and be a decent chap" and Christians are all over it claiming persecution.  You act like you live in an atheist's world and that you're constantly being criticised and challenged for your beliefs.  Even though this is not the case, your "holy" book says to expect this so why are you complaining? ;)|`|U7sBZKUuaa	Very good quote.

The great proprietor of war, chaos, disconstruction, prejudice, and segregation.

Bad things done by a christian shouldn't be a reason to hate christianity.  Likewise bad things done by an atheist shouldn't be a reason to hate atheism.  But then it still leaves us in the same place.  Some atheists will try to push their views and are unwilling to let christians be themselves just as many christians' goals seem to be to wipe out atheism rather than just acting like christians.  Then there's the majority in the middle who just want to have their particular beliefs and go on with their lives.|`|3lMujNUZaa	I disagree.  If a leader invokes his nation to go to war in the name of god, surely this is an abomination.  To ask a soldier to lay down his life for the glorification of a fictitious being is an atrocity.

I can't believe stores even sell it, any other book written in that fashion would have a big ole' M for matured stamped on the cover.    Many people do not feel it is okay to have their own view and own belief amongst all of the pressure of wanting to be a part of something. These few friends are really the only ones I will speak about religion in great depth to. Not to try to make them believe me. I can see that they arestrugglingg with their emotions because of their family. Maybe they need someone to tell them it is okay to have different beliefs.      A few friends of mine lived as christians simply because they did not want to have that talk with their family.      I do not talk about religion usually with friends simply because I believe everyone has the right to choose their own path in life.   I can tell you I find it very difficult to be friends with someone who is overly religious since they find it very difficult to not bring it up quite often. Especially after finding out that I am an atheist, they seem almost offended by it. I also have a hard time respecting most religious people because most of them a hypocritical and the evolution of how people practice is just lazy in this day.   You see many religious people having sex before marriage, doing drugs, stealing, fighting or hurting others intentionally. It's almost as if they know it is a joke but need something to fall back on when times get hard for them.     If you are truly religious and do as you say I will have much respect for you but I can tell you that is a very rare find.|`|tACJnpI1aa	Okay, I don't really care about the crusades and all that, but a lot of Christians speak out against non believers...such as yourself, and just don't leave well enough alone.

"Eclipses, be they solar or lunar, occur when the Earth, Sun and Moon are in a line. If the Moon is in-between the Earth and the Sun, it blocks the view of the Sun from some parts of the Earth, and this produces a solar eclipse. If, on the contrary, it is the Earth that is in-between the Sun and Moon, then the earth will block the light from the Sun before it can get to the Moon. Since moonlight is just the light the Moon reflects from the Sun, this will darken the Moon, and we get a lunar eclipse.    Since the Moon goes around the Earth every 28 days, shouldn't we expect a solar eclipse about every 28 days (when the Moon is new), and a lunar one in the same period, (when the Moon is full) ?    Well, this would be so if the orbit of the Moon were in the same plane as the orbit of the Earth around the Sun. But we know eclipses are rarer than that; and the Moon's orbit is not in the same plane. Instead, it is tilted with respect to it, and the Moon does not in general pass directly on the Earth-Sun line. Moreover, the Moon's orbit tilt varies slowly. To have an eclipse, then, it is not enough that the three bodies be in the right order; the Moon's orbit should also be at the right tilt."     "In former times a month was calculated as the time between two full moons, or the time it took the Moon to travel around the Earth. According to this, one month was equal to 29 days, 12 hours and 44 minutes. This is known as the "lunar month." Twelve lunar months represent one year, according to the Hijri calendar. However, there is a difference of eleven days between the Hijri calendar and the Gregorian calendar, in which a year is the time it takes the Earth to orbit the Sun. Indeed, attention is drawn to this difference in another verse:        They stayed in their Cave for three hundred years and added nine. (Qur'an, 18:25)    We can clarify the time referred to in the verse thus: 300 years x 11 days (the difference which forms every year) = 3,300 days. Bearing in mind that one solar year lasts 365 days, 5 hours, 48 minutes and 45.5 seconds, 3,300 days/365.24 days = 9 years. To put it another way, 300 years according to the Gregorian calendar is equal to 300+9 years according to the Hijri calendar. As we can see, the verse refers to this finely calculated difference of 9 years. (Allah knows best.) There is no doubt that the Qur'an, which contains such pieces of information, which transcended the everyday knowledge of the time, is a miraculous revelation."    http://www.answering-christianity.com/lu...    ...just in case you don't yet understand how science works...|`|gBoUrlrKaa	Tons of Muslims are nice modern people.|`|bgsJnpr8aa	i didnt know that   but the comment below was rather harsh|`|wSYYfBK4aa	Islam is being religion of peace.

It is because of Islam that we even have the freedom to choose or choose not to have a religion.

Additional to your question: what you are saying is all the other faiths were barbaric eg,Judaism ,Christianity, according to their calender in the 15th Century.

E870WbAsaa	Soul is a software installed in our body / brain   :)|`|P6atY3xXaa	Biblically, the soul is all our body, the whole thing.    Ezekiel 18  KJV  4Behold, all souls are mine; as the soul of the father, so also the soul of the son is mine: the soul that sinneth, it shall die.   20The soul that sinneth, it shall die. The son shall not bear the iniquity of the father, neither shall the father bear the iniquity of the son: the righteousness of the righteous shall be upon him, and the wickedness of the wicked shall be upon him.     Ecclesiastes 3  KJV   18I said in mine heart concerning the estate of the sons of men, that God might manifest them, and that they might see that they themselves are beasts.      19For that which befalleth the sons of men befalleth beasts; even one thing befalleth them: as the one dieth, so dieth the other; yea, they have all one breath; so that a man hath no preeminence above a beast: for all is vanity.      20All go unto one place; all are of the dust, and all turn to dust again.     Job 27:3  KJV  The spirit in man is God's spirit or energy shared with us to allow life.    3All the while my breath is in me, and the spirit of God is in my nostrils;      4My lips shall not speak wickedness, nor my tongue utter deceit.     You can see from Ecclesiastes that humans and animals are alike...both made from dust, both souls and go to the dust when they die.    In the Greek, the mind is called psyche often translated soul....but that does not refer to the body, but the intangible mind that is recorded on books in heaven waiting the resurrection.  Matthew 10:28 (use http://www.studylight.org/isb/ to find the word psyche used for soul.  Psyche is the Greek goddess of the mind, origin of the word psychology).    Debbie   debbiepittman@yahoo.com  (one of Jehovah's Witnesses)|`|4rh9ah3Paa	Yes, there is soul AND spirit. They are two distinct things and really shouldn't be used, one for the other. The point of interaction with the body? The Solar Plexus.     That they have not been classified under one of the (as yet) slightly over one hundred elements known to Science does not automatically mean they are non-existent. Ask yourself this: what are Thoughts, Imaginations, Memories and other abstract stuffs made of? They've not been classified under any element known so far, yet we can not deny their existence if we are to be objective.    Every human on earth has a soul and spirit in addition to the body which you can see, and so won't question. Every animal form has body and soul, no spirit. This is the basic difference between Humans and Animals. Science will scratch its head for a long time to come in the search for a difference between man and animal and won't find it as long as it keeps looking in the most 'logical' or 'plausible' places instead of giving the whole thing a more expansive view.    The substance soul and spirit are made of? Light. There is no doubt in  my mind that man can one day be able to take pictures of these things. Not a doubt.     If you want evidence of their existence now, talk with any one you know with missing limbs. They sometimes experience pains in areas where they lack flesh and bones (say, missing arm or foot). Scientists call these 'phantom' pains, but I assure you, it is not 'phantom' to the one experiencing it. The pain they feel is as real as any pain can be, yet Science try to convince them it is 'psychological' or 'phantom.'    When Science decides to give credence to the existence of these things, carry out necessary investigations, it will discover that proving their existence with pictures is not as implausible or difficult as it seems now. Till then, we sit and wait.
AA12006309	While I can't give any more specific advice, I can tell you that there is no connection between being a transvestite and being schizophrenic.  I've dealt with my schizophrenic sister all my life, and it's not the easiest thing to live with.    You might be able to better control his penchant for stealing your clothing, perhaps by buying clothes specifically for him?  Even if they're just from a thrift store, it's still stuff that's just his, and prevents him from having to steal.    People who suffer from psychiatric disorders should avoid alcohol at all costs.  It can upset the already skewed chemical balance in the brain, and lead to severe mood swings.      Whether he's on medication or not, he should still be under the care of a therapist and psychiatrist.  Perhaps voicing your concerns to his doctors might help?    Good luck.|`|U6gz8qUcaa	Problem here is, you cant say his TV, because it could be the Schezephrenia, you need to sit down and talk to him about it all, maybe to save your kids from getting to confused you tell him that he can ask for something and you will lend it too him, instead of him rummaging through your stuff (although i suggest you tell him to keep the underwear) then if the children ask why your giving him girls clothes you can use your mother as the reason until they are old enough to understand then you can explain.    it sounds like his depressed though, how many women do you know that crack open a bottle of wine in the morning? i only know one and shes going through some problems atm.    so your serious best option is to talk to him, no one talks about it so maybe he feels no one cares be the first to open his eyes that you all do care, you might not want to impose your views, but no one else is going to, he probably needs someone to talk to but no one will talk.    but keep an open mind theirs maybe a 50% chance its all related to his Schezephrenia, but then again theirs also a 50% chance he is actually truely TV, and he needs support not condeming, even if at some point you gotta tell him that his in danger if this all gets out.

0f7ba60c4b5854ac551f8222ad3afdf1aa	I think it's probably because adults remember the mistakes they made as teenagers and want to prevent others from making the same mistakes. Somewhere along the line, I think they forgot that making mistakes and learning from them is a part of growing up. Myself, I wasn't allowed to date until I was 17 and I ended up making a lot of stupid mistakes because I had no experience in dating.     I definitely think you can know your sexuality at 13. I knew I was bisexual at 15 and 7 years later, I'm still bisexual.|`|AA12006309	I wasn't allowed to wear makeup til I was 13.  I wasn't allowed to date til I was 16.

But that doesnt mean to say that what you are feeling right now is wrong chick.  you go for it, whatever you want to beleive and whenever and whoever you want to date -its your choice xx|`|yRlIXECTaa	You dont know that you are really BI-sexual until you are an adult, You may be bi-curious, and you may like others of the same sex and opposite sex, but that doesnt intentionally mean that you are bisexual.     14 is too young to date mainly because there are sooo many dangers out there that a 14 year old could get into and even happen to a 14 year old.  Its a cruel cruel world out there.  The right age to start dating would be 16, but with parental supervision for safety reasons.|`|1831ede9e27aa3948ecfe643b6ae8bfbaa	You can know you are bi/gay etc from any age.  Some people may go through "phases" of finding who they are but they don't last long.  I think adults say 14 is too young too date because 14 is too young to have sex/get pregnant/catch STD's/etc  and dating is the beginning of the path to people having sex.  A 14 year old who doesn't date is much more unlikely to be sexually active.|`|PSWFAVthaa	I think adults shouldnt be patronising about young teens dating, its when your hormones are at their worst so of course your going to want to explore the possibilities with the oppisite (or same!) sex. THe more your parent doesnt allow it, the more you push the teen to do it. I think if there was a better comminucation and understanding of boundaries when a teen informs their parent that they want to date that it would be so much better.    Its ok to consider the possibility of being bi at that age, but I also appreciate that at such an age, your still exploring all options. As long as your not hurting anyone, I dont see the harm in being bi|`|538ab5ecdacab6b5aa127afe86626733aa	There's a difference between being attracted to the same sex and wanting children and to settle down with the same sex.  I think people have the misconception they are bi if they will do sexual things or kiss the same sex.  I studied psychology and was able to repeat a study that a lot of homosexuality/bisexuality is due to insecurities with ones own gender or the opposite gender.  A portion of it has also become popular culture, whether you like that statement or not.      About the 14 being too young to date thing, there is no laws to life.  You might live in the system and the system might tell you what's wrong or right, but Earth doesn't regulate those laws, the system does.  Whether the system being the government or your family.   Theoretically, wrong/right  good/evil doesn't even exist.    Though if I had to judge, I would say to only date people your age, because older people may try to take advantage of you.|`|agNjPmBWaa	well 13 is not to young to know if you bi    I can't say much because I started dating at that age   alot (but not all) 14 year olds are naieve  they don't know a lot about relationships so  a lot of times they wind up getting taken advantage of  trust me its happened to pretty much everyone I know  Also we all know what sex leads to  for one thing 14 is way to young to have a baby  I know a lot of ppl wer condoms but  a lot don't   to top things did you know off 1 in every 5 people in the united staes   over 12 have herpes ....... but you can get hepres even if you wear a condom|`|f0f91b1f61307e94f9c53fd86e2c1295aa	Your spelling tells me you're old enough.|`|PeQ40WcWaa	Well......    It's mostly because adults have had more experience than 14 year olds, and know that often, feelings change over time. Sexuality can change over time, too.    I knew when I was 13 that I liked women. In fact, I came out at 13. So I do believe, since I feel sexuality is there from birth, you can be aware of your sexuality at 13.     However, I also believe that you should never label yourself for life. I think that you could say "I have always felt bisexual, and feel bisexual right now". You do not know how you will feel in the future. I labelled myself as a lesbian at 13, and when I turned 18, I suddenly started liking men too.    As for dating.... it's difficult. 13 is SO young. It really is. But, some 13 year olds are more mentally mature than adults. I have always been mature and it frustrated me when people told me that I was just going through a phase. At the end of the day, you know yourself, and you seem comfortable with who you are, so let them think what they want to think, and just try to get on with your own stuff.    Be respectful to your parents in terms of dating, though.    I do think that in school, there should be more education about young relationships and how you can have them without having sex. This WILL sound patronising, but teenage relationships ARE different to adult relationships. But teenage years are difficult for adults to talk about, because they are in between childhood and adulthood. So it's easy to sound patronising - because teenage relationships ARE different to adult ones. Adult ones involve things like mortgages, life-goals, travel, work, marriage, commitment, etc. Teenage relationships involve feelings... and lots of them.     I think I would just say to you, for what it's worth, be sensible, use protection, don't sleep around (you will hate yourself for it) and use your head!!|`|SI0PhJ5naa	I agree, you should be able to date when you're ready. Parents will try to hold their kids back but ultimately it is pointless. Kids need to date, make mistakes etc. Its what defines the people they become later in life.

That is basically the function of dating. If you think you are ready for a child... well i guess go ahead. But, when 14 year olds date, it isn't even really dating. It's just being close friends for awhile...|`|67CBIM7caa	They are looking out for you, want you to be happy which is never easy.

As a linguist myself, of course I see the dangers of using the wrong speech items in public - especially coming from a language school! - but I think it's necessary to view it from a lighter side.   Maybe these students do not need higher bands in IELTS, and if they do, I'm sure they'll go looking for a better school. As you probably know, IELTS is not only for those seeking entrance to English speaking universities, it is also a recognized diploma for professional people, and these include vocational training. I've known many people who took the exam and got the band they needed, and their language skills were rather poor.

There is a lot of scientific Research showing this to be a true model.The dating methods are hopeless. I have an igneous roch here which has been dated by pot argon and some other authentic method. One answer is millions, the other billions. In fact it came from a volcano in the Pacific which erupted about 1880. So it is just over 200 years. So much for dating. When it comes to the universe and other galaxies it is really beyond us. It certainly has taken light millions of years to get here. The scary thing is "out there" may be already gone and we are seeing the light that left them long ago. We don't need to know all this to be saved. nev r|`|czdCtTvWaa	6000 years old ( LOL!)|`|AA12059450	It DOESN'T...    4004 B.C. took a couple 17th century nut jobs taking several dozen passages OUT OF CONTEXT, shuffling them together like a deck of cards, and "adding them up."      ... "Card shuffling" is NEVER a VALID method of Biblical interpretation. We see attempts at this "method" in "Harmony of the Gospels" books, discussions of the "qualifications" of church leaders, and occasionally other areas. Each of these cases ignores various aspects of context, often robbing individual passages of their audience and setting, both key elements in reaching a correct understanding of a particular passage.|`|T0xLpygfaa	the bible is wrong and cannot be cited as an authority on anything.    the religious people who repeat this absurdity of a young earth do so because they have conditioned since kids to believe it and are now incapable of refuting it.|`|f8mLpPXlaa	It depends on who you listen to.The Christians and Jews who think you should take the Bible literally say 5000 years. The rest of the world knows better.|`|06da0acef0ef561a9e28c4c4aee9904faa	There are ~34,000 religions all claiming to be 'christian'    a famous Anglican bishop (bishop Usher? IIRC) added up all the times given in the bible and came to the conclusion that the earth was created in 4004 BC.    some christans believe the earth was created 6,00o yrs ago ('young earth' creationists)    others say it was created some indeterminate time before, but don't believe in evolution ('old earth' creationists)    some christians believe the scientific timescale, but belive that god has been tampering with the universe since the big bang ('Intelligent design' creationists)|`|AA11212224	There is no official stance for all of Christianity.  Catholics, Eastern Orthodox, and many Protestant denominations accept that the Earth is millions, if not billions, of years old.  There are very few Christian denominations who take the stance of a young Earth.    And no, the Bible doesn't say how old the Earth is.  Now, if you take the creation story literally (six actual days), and count the generations back from Jesus to Adam, then yes, the Earth is a little over 6000 years old.  However, most Christians do not believe the Earth was literally created in six days.  Furthermore, even if the six days were literal, God created the Earth "in the beginning"; it doesn't say how long the Earth was in existence before God began creating on it.|`|0e4f8cb88b486d0c0f4eb1228b765759aa	uhmm wish i had read this question before promising to answer!  I don't believe their is an actual date for the start of creation but apparently if you add all of the ages of the descendants of adam and eve then it comes to roughly 4000bc.  Does this include Methuselah who was 900 or something?  All pretty silly really (:|`|5RDsNdNDaa	Only fundamentalists believe in a literal bible.

FVCZEL9Maa	Smoking, at least in today's world, is considered "rebellious" and "dangerous." Our generation believes that girls should be "good" and "perfect." Guys are the ones who are accepted as being "bad boys." It's just more natural to see guys smoking than to see girls smoking, even though in reality, a higher percentage of girls smoke than boys. But still, I think we also see more boys smoking since they are more open about it. Girls tend to be shyer about their habit, and may not light up a cigarette in public as readily as guys do.    I personally think that girls who smoke are extremely sexy. My girlfriend smokes, and I would never date a girl who didn't smoke. I like to smoke and I love the smell. Smoking is a positive attribute in my eyes and is a complete turn on for me.|`|SU8z0TUoaa	I don't know, but to many guys, a girl who smokes is sexier than one who doesn't.|`|ccZuEOEfaa	I've never really noticed that.  I know a lot more female smokers than male, but that is because I work with women and nearly all the smokers I know are the people that I work with.  Smoking is absolutely disgusting whoever does it though, and also very selfish because they just smoke everywhere and give the rest of us cancer as well.|`|BWt4mj13aa	I agree with what you're saying, but I'm not quite sure why there is this double standard. I think all smokers are bad though, regardless of gender.|`|wOA2Mf6Naa	I dont care really, but a lot more girls smoke here than boys|`|JTSNljLhaa	less feminine??|`|bc8492ecc5cb8d9056d4595644fa6f30aa	Women carry the babies, logic says they should take better care of their bodies.|`|3YiZ63OVaa	I don't necessarily agree I think people look bad on it either way.  I would never date a girl who smokes though, A girl should not smell like an ashtray.|`|D54u7mZ8aa	i dont really know but i do know that I LOVE SMOKING and everyone should|`|tHmLuCcoaa	I have never noticed that.I honestly don't think people react differently, smoking is a filthy habit in general.

kCu6Him8aa	Well, most people prefer the touch. It's basically and iPhone with out the phone. My sister has one. You can get online, talk on AIM, it's got all the apps, you can check the weather... it's just really nifty. ANYONE can make use of it. Who doesn't use the internet or chat online? I would definitely consider getting it engraved because that actually makes it personal. Also, try to add a couple songs. Songs that remind you him, Your Song if you have one, and just songs that you both like. I think Valentine's Gifts should be personal because the holiday itself is getting so impersonal.     If you're going to make him cupcakes or something of that nature... go all out. Try a recipe that seems a bit more impressive than you usually would make. Try it a couple times this week and next week to get it just right. It will really show that you put some thought and love into rather than just stirring in the ingredients with the box and popping it in the oven (although, that's a nice gesture, too). If possible, try to find a way to sneak the cupcakes to his house or something or have someone deliver then in the middle of the day before you guys see each other. It's so cute. =)     My other suggestion would be to cook for him instead of going out (if you're planning on doing dinner). It's going to be CROWDED! Plus, homemade meals can be more romantic... and affordable after spending so much on his gift.     Good luck and happy Valentine's Day!!|`|zdpp7cubaa	I've owned both the ipod classic and the touch. I like the touch way more than the classic, but I think it's all about what your boyfriend likes. I like the touch better because of the bigger screen (I like watching music videos, movies, etc), all the applications, the fact it can play out loud, I like the touch screen better than the click wheel, and also you can get on the internet and watch youtube videos or buy music from your ipod touch. To me it was the better buy even though it holds less songs, it still holds a lot of music unless your boyfriend just listens to thousands and thousands of songs. I have had an ipod for about 2 years now and I only have like 500 songs on it.|`|cOuz2RZ5aa	The iPod Touch because it is more entertaining but if he likes music more mayeb you should buy the iPod Classic|`|bo3CuPzeaa	I think you should get him the Ipod touch, it is much better looking, and it feels nice, and it is just generally better then the touch, but I think you should definitely get it engraved!!|`|TPXrfPk6aa	ipod touch i think, and don't forget  transfer your beautiful pictures with your boyfriend to ipod.     combine the pictures with romantic musics as a backsound, for the best, i recommend you to create simple video clip or slide show from your pictures and combine with poetry, love quotes, or anything related your memories with your boyfriend.

The Church knows this is happening and they are calling it the 2nd coming among other things, just another con really, they know their time is up...  I will post a couple of sites for you, but I am more of a book man personally, and if you go to amazon.com and punch in 2012 there are plenty of books there...Also punch in Mayan prophesies, and you will be amazed as to how many people have written books on the subject...  http://www.greatdreams.com/2012.htm  http://www.diagnosis2012.co.uk/1.htm  There should be enough diverse information in just these two web-sites to get your mind thinking in overdrive...

Satanists and many pagan cultures from every corner of the world all throughout history have celebrated this like the Sumerians, Babylonians, Cherokee, Hopi, Chinese I-Ching (confirmed by Terence McKenna), Mayans (Pacal Votan; Chilam Balam of Tizimin, Mani, Chumayel; Jaguar Prophet), Egyptians, Celts, etc. This evil event is called "the abomination that causes desolation" that will be set up in the Jewish Temple's Holy of Holies when the antichrist is imbued with the spirit of satan himself. When will Jesus come? Only God Himself knows exactly, but very soon in "the twinkling of an eye" and like "a thief in the night".

Don't drink too much though; contrary to popular belief heavy water is not radioactive but if you drink it heavily for several days with no regular water it can become very toxic.|`|sSjdtI7Eaa	there s a jellyfish which seems to be close... contact may not be advisable.|`|yp8y1jrCaa	I have a book that explains some things about spirits and manifestations. Some manifestations can take physical form - or atleast a type of physical form.     This would correlate to scripture when the population around Moses (after he came down from the mountain) had horns. These horns, in my perception, were a physical manifestation though not fleshy, occurrence of spirit.     Things really are interconnected.     To contact  - you'd have to do your own work on that - try researching and reading some literature on the subject, or find a "burning" bush.    I do believe eternity is a form of immortality. Infinite.     Things can change in form, and still continue to exist. A supernova is just one example, it is studied, and I believe, supernovas, upon this occurrence - release iron - this iron comes to earth and may actually be some of the iron we ingest in food sources (and some vitamins) into our own bodies - producing healthy red blood cells. Just another thought of how we are interconnected to the universe. One thing combining to another to encourage health, life and longevity. And it continues on...    Wow|`|NOTc1b9saa	You are a Spiritual Being within a physical body, and when you die it is only your physical overcoat that is cast off..YOU continue and ARE immortal as will be revealed quite soon..

That would mean with a fleshly body, yet not die...  This WILL happen, but has not yet done so.  It applies to the Great Crowd...  (Revelation 7:9) After these things I saw, and, look! a great crowd, which no man was able to number, out of all nations and tribes and peoples and tongues, standing before the throne and before the Lamb, dressed in white robes; and there were palm branches in their hands.    These ones are benefitting from this promise of God.    (Revelation 21:4) And he will wipe out every tear from their eyes, and death will be no more, neither will mourning nor outcry nor pain be anymore. The former things have passed away.      This promise can only apply to those who are subject to death or sickness...    It cannot apply to the "little flock" of 144,000 [ Rev, 7;4 and 14;1] They have to die to become purely spiritual.

Even if you find something remotely close to a contradiction, the Bible teacher will whip out his Greek/Hebrew knowledge and give you the true meaning of that word which will ultimately go with everything else.     What you should do is either BS it or talk to the teacher and tell him/her you don't believe in God (politely) and ask to be excluded from any personal application kind of stuff.     BTW I'd recommend that you not look through the Bible for contradictions and falsities.

One statement that makes sense to me is:    If God exists and wanted, He would give us a way to know Him.  I don't know if you've read the Bible, but that is the first time I began to believe when I read the Bible and the miraculous journey of the Jews to the promised land, and the miracles of Jesus as He preached.    I began to read the Bible after that crazy book, the Late Great Planet Earth.  It was very scary especially considering the author missed most of his prophecies, and has many things backwards as most Bible only people do.    Jesus founded a Church and it is the Catholic Church.  Historically his teachings and the 7 Sacraments have been passed down since his time to this time.  Miracles abound throughout the Church history and God is with the Church He founded.

yB0nVXfWaa	Yes, my dear, you are absolutely right.  It's called the 'Prosperity Gospel' don't you know?  So, put that in your dissertation.    This is another reason why I don't subscribe to Sky, even though there are some very good Bible teachers on there, in amongst.  It seems you always have to wade through the muck to get to the good stuff.  It's such a pity, because it doesn't give people like you (and me) a good impression, because they think that's what Christianity is.    These preachers are getting rich, rich, rich on gullible Christians who can't be bothered to think for themselves and who are happy to have a church which is a big-business institution.  Like - we can buy converts?      You can tell what's in a person - and a preacher, too - very quickly, you know, and folks outside of 'church' can spot this faster than the ones inside.  It's never long before the appeal for money comes.  There it is 'the love of money' - it's that simple.  And sick, as you say.    'Sow into my ministry' they say 'and the Lord will bless you'.  Now, where in the Bible does anyone say that?  Nowhere, and if people would read their Bibles more often instead of listening to these charlatans, they would have been 'sent down the road with a flea in their ear' long ago!  I tell you, one day the Lord will judge them, and I personally wouldn't like to be them when that happens, for these people have done so much damage.  Just think where that money could've gone - to the poor and needy and to places like Africa - but instead it's gone into private jets, flash cars and luxurious living.    Yes, it's pretty sick - big business methods come into the church.  Oh well, all I can say is that you haven't seen the real Church yet.  These are folk who live a lot simpler and are not building their own little empires.  There are few of these simple believers about - because the love of money and power gets a lot of people - but this is the true Church of Jesus Christ.  We will not preach you 'give, give', but we will preach you the Gospel.

AA12077984	I live in Thailand and have spent some time in Canada - the proportion of gay men to straight men in both countries seems the same to me. Where did you get this information?     Unlike Canada, homosexuality has always been legal in Thailand so people here are perhaps more comfortable with it.    But... I don't understand what any difference would have to do with being born homosexual.    edit:.  Yes Fizzy, I really live in Thailand.     I can't find statistics in NationMaster to support your position - there's no "Homosexuality" category.     Yes, you're right...  There are gays everywhere, not just Thailand - we're about 10 % of the population everywhere.    I still don't know what this has to do with being born gay.|`|yzgS5KiQaa	Because every one here is in the closet! Of the hundreds of people I see everyday at work and school, how many do you think go home and say "I saw a transsexual today" uh, zero. You'd be shocked to see how many transsexuall people and gays were around you.|`|G9R6VZOXaa	They probably don't have more, per capita.    There's probably just a higher proportion that are out of the closet    {edit - look it up where?

In Thailand they have a place in the society while in North America we are still being killed just for being born the way we are.|`|CfZn9kK5aa	People in Thailand are more open about homosexuality. Perhaps less in Canada are less open about it because of the religious stigma from most Abrahamic religions. That stigma just does not exist nearly as powerfully in Thailand than it does in Canada. Yes, the Canadian government does not discriminate against homosexuals. Yes, a large portion of Canadians have nothing against homosexuals. But, there are still large groups of religious fundamentalists who are completely and utterly against homosexuality, and still speak out loudly against it.     People, for instance, from such religious families may never come out. The truth of the matter is, we have no way of knowing how many homosexuals per capita each country has, as both have many that hide it. We may never truly be able to know do to religious intolerance.  -----------    Perhaps this will make what I mean about religion clearer, I will use the web site you listed..       In Canada, there are 0.228215 Catholic priests per 1,000 people      Doesn't seem like a lot does it?    In Thailand, there are only 0.00995544 Catholic priests per 1,000 people     That is 22.92 times more Catholic priests.    There are 72 Catholic diocese in Canada. While there are ten in Thailand.    Canada is 46.66% Catholic. Thailand is only 0.44% Catholic.     Canada is 29% Protestant. Thailand is .4%.    Canada is 2% Muslim. Thailand didn't even make the list.     In Canada there are 10.9739 Jews per 1,000 people. In Thailand there are 0.00389493 Jews per 1,000 people. Thats 2817.48 times more.     All of those religions have writings in their religious text that speaks against homosexuality.  -------    Canada  Roman Catholic 42.6%, Protestant 23.3% (including United Church 9.5%, Anglican 6.8%, Baptist 2.4%, Lutheran 2%), other Christian 4.4%, Muslim 1.9%, other and unspecified 11.8%, none 16%      Thailand  Buddhist 94.6%, Muslim 4.6%, Christian 0.7%, other 0.1%      I can't ever remember a Buddhist screaming and shouting that homosexuals are wrong and unnatural. I can't ever remember hearing a Buddhist say any thing regarding homosexuality period.     In Buddhism there is no rule explicitly prohibiting homosexuality. Though Buddha is recorded as  being opposed to both cross-gender and homosexual desires, no where was it out right prohibited.     YES, the countries are open to it. But the PEOPLE of those of Canada are not as open to it as the PEOPLE of Thailand|`|U6gz8qUcaa	If hetrosexuality is something you are born with, then why are there less hetrosexuals in say thailand compared to canada?    thats my question to you.

10c1407ad3b148843d1e616e9a4c6215aa	A fire plug is a fire hydrant.  In the olden days firemen drew water from wells or underground water and to access underground  water mains there was a wooden fire plug.  They would put a barrel there, which would be filled with water and, until  hosepipes and  hand  or electric pumps were invented, buckets would be used to carry the water and throw it on the fires.    There also were different fire companies operating as the fire service was not one single organisation in those days.    "To make it" is "to arrive in time".  So if a fire crew, or a fireman, arrived on the scene of a fire in time (before the place burnt down completely) they placed a barrel close to the wooden fire  hydrant in the street for it to fill up....
kRTSVuywaa	ok well 1st of all if you are in a relationship it is disrespectful to the other person to be going out with someone else.

I bought my husband a big bag of his favorite candy...and some people might think that's "tacky" but it shows that I love him and I know he'll be tickled with it...so it works.

I was a good mother to my children, I loved them and made sure they were safe from mother by never asking her to baby-sit for me. Being a parent showed another side of me. The little girl so afraid of her own mother grew up to be a strong woman who loved her own children unconditionally and never hit them or call them names. That love for my children is the same today.

"Why are people still so proud of their religion knowing fully well the loopholes ?"    They simply don't see it. They're manipulated (brainwashed, for lack of a better word), so plainly, to gloss over certain contradictions, misconceptions, and details that are obviously delusional fantasy. They would either see these as something that is not meant to be taken literally, a complete comprehension flaw, or something that was lost-in-translation (LOL).    Why has the Bible seen over 2,900 different revisions? Why are there hundreds of different sects of Christianity?

With that in mind, religious beliefs should be seen as drivers of humanity and therefore people have a right to be proud of them. The fact that in modern society the vast majority of people don't take pride in their beliefs, or even entertain any notion of God, be it as an omnipotent ruler or as a metaphor for natural forces, explains the funk and depression that seems to prevail. It is my belief that for society to continue progressing we have to return to a consensus on a belief/value set, that doesn't rely on the worship of material goods and empty consumerism. As for the loopholes, these will never be eradicated in any religion as religion is man-made and guided by us, and as such will be neither wholly perfect nor wholly imperfect. All major religions are largely metaphorical, without specific practical advice, to encourage thought and soul seeking/searching. If you think of religion as a tool to guide you on a spiritual journey, think of it as a map that will occasionally lead you up a blind alley or cause you to take a wrong turn or make a u-turn, but generally it is going to guide you in the right direction to some kind of enlightenment.|`|MyLsLugGaa	NO LOOPHOLES IN ISLAM|`|G2yUpoqfaa	NO THINKING IN ISLAM--ONLY BLINDNESS|`|8qQm9AnHaa	i think NO religion is perfect.only stupid people say my religion is best n other religin is bad.foolish people are always here to create troubles n add bad things to the name RELIGION .God must be thinking why  he/she/it created such a fools what a waste of time........please goto some other planet so can earth be in peace.
QfTEYT3zaa	How about 'I was suffering from a women's problem'. It's quite vague but most people will know not to ask anymore questions.

You'll get away fine with whoever handles your case: if it's a woman, she'll understand. If it's a man, he'll be too embarrassed to pursue. (Or if he does, just be casual and give a lot of details).  But what kind of school is this if you can skip classes and get back without a note from your parents ?
mwdwDOaWaa	For some men [no disrespect here], there own paternal family comes first before everything else even their own wives and children. They trust their brothers and sisters more than anything else. Its quite common actually, and the man family always seem accuse the wife of stealing the man away from his family.     And also in some cultures parents have a preferential treatment towards their sons than their daughter [specially, in the son is the only son]. Its more of a cultural thing, than anything else. And I will assume, therefore, your dad is more of a cultural man rather than religious [an assumption only, if wrong my apology].  --------------------------------------...  Trust is a hard thing to come by or to win. Once its broken that can be extremely hard to repair.  --------------------------------------...  I would suggest:  - Talk to your mom; ask her aid to clear this air between you and your dad.  - Teenage years, are always the hardest, its the child inside you fighting with the adult inside out. Most teenagers have a strained relationship with their parents, its natural.  - From your statement, its clear that your uncle is a liar and a manipulator. Also that he seems to have certain amount of influence over your own dad!   - Although you may not like this, but I think you should make peace with him. I know this may be too much to ask, but remember this you are the younger one, and hence there is no shame is asking forgiveness. Just to make the peace, I am not saying that you are wrong [mind you!]  - As men get older and older, its very hard for them to even accept their own mistakes, so you can be the more generous one here. For GOD truly knows!    - Lastly talk to your dad openly and frankly, for no father can deny that! A father is the first man that a girl- child comes in contact with. So father is very important. Yes I know that he is wrong, but I suggested before, its you who have to take the first step in rebuilding that trust!  --------------------------------------...  Hope that helps and I am no wiser than you are!  --------------------------------------...

If I was in your shoes, I would approach my dad and calmly and respectfully tell him that you want to move forward with his help.    Explain that you were hurt physically and emotionally by some of his actions, but you want to put this behind you and move on.    Ask him to support you by spending more time with you, so that he gets to know you and get your mom to back you up.    Promise you will do your very best to make him proud.    As an Orthodox Christian that's what I would do, but I don't know if that is something you can do honey.    Can you get some advice and support from your Imam?    Also apologise to your dad for the swearing and say that you need his guidance. We are all sinners and I am sure he will be moved.    Try to reach an agreement where he promises to believe you unless proven wrong. Tell him that he can punish you (ground you or take away privilages)if you are proven to be lying.    You are his immediate family and he needs to show that he loves and trusts you. Explain that his love and support is crucial to your happiness and future progress.    I will pray for you.    Stay strong and God Bless|`|AA11237620	Calm down, take a deep breath.    Now listen to me carefully.  Don't you ever leave that house or the gap will increase, I am talking within experience.

I know its tough right now, but time heals everything. What you need to do is earn his respect, you need to suck your pride in and sit down with him(as much as it pains you) you have to talk like an adult to him. Say "Hey dad I apologize for the way I behaved so and so, but I realize you are my father and that I should treat you like one". if your dad is any loving and caring parent he will really be moved by the maturity and sensibility you are displaying. So in order to restore order and respect, you have to earn it.    Also make a dua that Allah makes him understanding and conversant.|`|syMxQEF3aa	Susan, I like you. So don't take what I'm about to write in the wrong way. When you said to him "F this family" he had every right to hit you for speaking to him in that way. Within that statement you said "F your mother, brother, and father" Which is a great sin. In my opinion, you are in the wrong in this situation, and you should take the first step to fixing things with him because he is your superior. And even though you feel he is in the wrong, it is still required for you to make the first step.    It's not fair that your father believed your uncle over you, but your uncle will have to answer for that because it is a huge sin to accuse someone of something they didn't do. But now he knows the truth. Start small, say hello to him, ask him how his day was. Or what's even better is if you sit down with him and tell him how some things he does hurt you. God forbid you die in this state with your father angry with you because it will be held against you. And don't leave your house because that will kill what can be salvaged from your relationship.  Do it for the sake of Allah.|`|5ofS2qQYaa	you shouldn't have talked to your dad like that :\  if he's always there to support you through your ups and downs in life, provide you food, clothing, shelter, islamic guidance i think you definetly owe him a ton more respect  he'd already be doing what some fathers give up on     1. stop cursing members of your family, even if it's 'acceptable'   2. have sabr and respect when dealing with others  3. apoligize for your behavior   4. speak to your mom to speak with your dad  ---  you really need to learn some respect and patience sis  give it time...i don't see why your dad must accept your apology right away, yes most parents do...and he probably has, but he probably just doesn't want to deal w/you right away  he's human afterall...even if some parents say they've accepted your apology, they still take time to absorb the blow from their children...it's a serious thing you know 0__o  i guess your dad is just more open with recovering from it  women tend to keep the pain inside  men tend to show it externally    :|  peace  Wallahu A'lam|`|dAcNaajsaa	r u muslim ?

PWankIUpaa	Hello Ruby        There is so much controversy about healing and Faith healers I will try to help you with this question! Faith Healers are usually Frauds! Oral Roberts , Peter Popoff ran into trouble with the law for this after people found out about  them  haveing  put people in the audiences who were never ill and claimed to have been healed on national television or in so called healing services! Or recieving messages about illness fromm God which came from and ear phone and was transmitted to these so called pastors by their employees who gathered the information from people standing line !        This dose not mean All Healing were Phony even in their services. God dose heal people however God what people fail to realize is that God is in control. He puts people in situations which they find themselves for a purpose . If we are ill we are ill for a purpose which we may not understand . Perhaps we have sinned unto death . That is  we have un repentant sins in our lives and we are damming other people's chance of redemption. In such cases God will call a saved person home to stop the damage from continuing.Then there are those people who through their illness can reach other people to be saved! These people may or may not recover , God is in control and what ever the circumstance He has placed the person in is to help the people around them to come to a saving Grace knowledge of Himself! A person if he is in Christ Jesus is not being punished to be called Home because this world is NOT our Home. This life is temporary!  We are here for a purpose and that purpose is to show the rest of the World God through our lives!  We are to show people that Jesus is the ONLY way to God and we can ONLY approach God through Jesus the Messiah of the World!    Sadly some people who call them selves Christians preach false doctrins such as Wealth is a sign of God's love and Favor when nothing could be farther from the Truth.We have God's Favor through Belief in Christ Jesus and we show that favor by showing the World God as He leads us to show the World.  These same people desire your money and claim all sorts of promises for blackmailing you into sending it to them! What ever wealth you have is to be shared in promoting The Truth and the Truth is Christ Jesus and His Gosple.    God dose sometime Heal but We are NOT here to minulipate God and His Grace but to serve mankind and by serving God through Christ Jesus . The Apostles were NOT Ritch nor did they have good lives as we count Good life ! They looked as we should to a life to come with our God! Their lives were a Light to the World given and counted Rich in following Christ Jesus and drawing All men to Him. To Him tey Gave the Glory for lasting Treasure in Heaven not to recieve rewards on this world  which by the standards of eternity is but a moment!    Paul one of the Greatest of Apostles had a "thorn in the flesh" given by God which was an illness . We know that most of the Apostles died a marters death with Peter being Crucified upside down!    This false teaching of some churches of Prosperty Teaching is from the PIT of Hell ! It is the fore told Apostasy of this world to dissapoint Christians or make them feel inadiquet or guilty because they cannot minulipate God to suite themselves!    Always remember that We are Here to Serve God and bring Him Glory not To recieve Glory and Praise for ourselves and serve our selves!|`|8pQrIL90aa	God heals us all! He wants all of us so therefore the promise is not to a few but to all that are willing to go through the fire of change to receive it.    The real sicnkess is the virus of sin, which is like a spreading cancer in the soul, that GOD heals us of in this present time. The healing comes when you come to him and see that he is GOD and able to cleanse you of all inequity. You are healed in that you SEE the importance of obedience as we are a physcial people under spritual attack. Do you know that as we speak a war is raging on in the spiritual realm for the souls of men? God wants us to be part of his kingdom, but the best way to train a child is to subject them to a training course that they may learn how to overcome obstacles in their lives. God training course is hard, and sometimes it seems unfair, but the whole focus is on eternal life with HIM.  Satan was in heaven and he rebelled against GOD and took 1/3 of the angels of heaven with him. All you need is one bad apple. Like the bible says, a little leaven, leaventh the whole lump.    God can heal your SOUL. I am living testimony of a man that began life as a docile, timid shy guy and how without life turned me into a hideous sex starved drug using maniac. Heartless, stupid man.

Keep in mind that healing a body of death isn't much use in the whole scheme of things, it's far more important to heal a sinful soul and prepare it for eternity. God alone decides if He wants to heal someones body, He see's the big picture, we put all our eggs in this world which is full of poison, murder, wars, famines, hatred and all kinds of crime.  It's in our nature to cling to this life tenaciously, when a person becomes a Christian, the fear of death leaves them and they set their sights on eternity.
yB0nVXfWaa	Well, I think you are referring to the Jerusalem Bible.  As I understand it, this Bible has been compiled with much help from Roman Catholic theologians and as such, has a definite 'Catholic' emphasis.  What I mean is, Protestants would not interpret from the original languages in quite that way.    Furthermore, there are two sets of Apocryphas - the Old Testament Apocrypha and the New Testament Apocrypha - included in this Bible.  These are the books which are 'extra-canonical' - ie. not accepted as totally inspired in the way that the rest of the Scriptures are, so not included in the Canon of Scripture.  However, the Catholic Church does accept them as inspired.      So, though Protestants consider them to be 'gnostic' (ie. outside the Canon/extra biblical = not inspired by God) because of the erroneous teachings found therein, Catholics read them alongside the approved scriptures and believe they are equally God-inspired.    Protestant Bibles do not include the Apocryphas at all, but they can be useful (eg. I and II Maccabbees) for historical background, though not for doctrine.     How does Scripture qualify for inclusion in the Canon?  Well, in the case of the Old Testament, the Jews themselves always knew which scriptures were authentic and which were not, and it was the same with the New Testament writings which came to the Early Church.  They were taught by the apostles at that time and so had the faith in its purest form and, testing everything against the gospel truth they had first received, they could tell very easily which ones aligned with that truth and which ones did not.      These things - the canon of Scripture - were decided around the time of Constantine in the 4th century and - bad man though he was - it seems that he still made the right choices in leaving some things out of the canon and including what everyone knew to be divinely inspired.  Maybe they had Apocryphas then, but they nevertheless kept them apart from the rest of the inspired writings.    Now you ask what it means to me, being Protestant.  Well, it means that I prefer to leave the apocryphal writings alone and concentrate on reading the Scriptures which are truly inspired.  For only by these can I learn and grow.  If I want to read the writings of men, I can do it, but if I want to learn what God has to say, then I am wasting my time reading the Apocryphas.  For me, they are a distraction from the important thing.      Neither do I particularly want to study how the Catholic Bible differs from my own in the 'nuances'.  It is enough for me to know the great big differences between our two doctrines.  I just want to get on with reading and studying the Bible in its most honest form.|`|AA11431665	a bible|`|4qj98nhdaa	All bibles make good door stops|`|4wHjtkJXaa	lol the atheists' response to this will make me laugh.|`|bqCmVI7iaa	Nothing.

And:    1Co:4:5: Therefore judge nothing before the time, until the Lord come, who both will bring to light the hidden things of darkness, and will make manifest the counsels of the hearts: and then shall every man have praise of God.      P.S. This is not directed at Christians trying to sort things out. But it's hilarious to see athiests and so forth put down the Holy Bible now when their sitting on cushy chairs in comfortably warmed houses. But they will sing a new tune when true reality slaps them in the face and they have hell to pay for zillions x zillions x zillions plus years. Those are the people who cannot take a little crap now but think they can take crap for eternity, Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha.    M't:23:24: Ye blind guides, which strain at a gnat, and swallow a camel.

I don't like to rush into sex or relationships at all. It tells you if they're serious or not.     No matter how hard you try people will think what they think. Sometimes your best is not good enough and that's the moment you need to find someone better. Keep your chin up. We're all not that bad haha.|`|AA12006309	Very difficult, especially when they've used and abused you in the past.    What is required for me to trust a man is respect.

6nWGMP5Laa	Fulfill all your personal needs before you commence your Prayer, for e.g., thirst, hunger and calls of nature.    Pray in a pure physical state. Perform your wudu with care and perfection.    Although the whole earth is a masjid or a place of worship, choose a place that is clean.    Pray in an environment free of noise and one where there is no distraction.    Adorn yourself with clean and respectable clothes.     and while Performing Your Prayer:-  Assess your mental readiness for Prayer before its commencement, during the various postures, after each raka and ultimately at the end.    Pray with humility both in your mental state and in your physical manner. Pray with hope and awe.    Remind yourself continually that you are talking to the most important 'One' in your life - your Creator and Sustainer. He is in front of you. You are facing Him and you are involved in a dialogue with Him.    Commence your Prayer by seeking Allah's help and protection from the influences of Shaytan.    Lower your gaze while praying and do not allow the physical environment to distract you. Anas related that the Prophet said: "My dear son, be sure to avoid being distracted during Prayer, for, to greater concentration and awareness.    Adopt a whispering technique in your recitation in order to remain focused on what you are saying, and not distract others.    As you recite the Quran, translate it into your own language so that your attention is held. As you ponder upon the meaning and implications of the words, insha-Allah, all worldly thoughts will disappear.    On each occasion that you recite the Sifat or attributes of Allah in ruku and sajda, consider how indebted you are and how grateful you should be to Allah and express your true emotions.    Utilize the occasion of sajda to make additional dua to Allah. The Prophet said: "A servant is nearest to his Lord when he is in sajda, so increase your supplication when in sajda." (Muslim.)    Make your Prayer of moderate duration so that you do not become physically and mentally tired but be aware that while in Prayer you must take your time praying.    Give due regard to the proper performance of all the physical postures. Do not 'peck like a crow' when doing rukus and sajdas as every posture in Salah, even the rests, are important.    Pray as if it is your last Prayer. The Messenger of God said: When you stand up to pray, perform your prayer as if it were your last...' (Ahmad)    Performing your prayer in a satisfactory manner should lead to a radical change in the way you lead your daily life. Salah must be as the Quran states: Surely, Salah prevents indecency and evil [al-Ankabut 29: 45.] Your improved and more disciplined life will in turn help the quality of your Prayer to increase even more. The two should continuously reinforce  each other.    Remember, Salah is an obligation. Whether your heart is attentive or not, it must be performed. You cannot give up Prayer because to you it appears useless. There is punishment for a Prayer not performed satisfactorily. It will be a witness against you rather than a witness for you on the Day of Judgment. Don't give up the obligation but try to infuse it with the purpose it seeks to serve - remembrance of Allah. It is important to remember the saying of the Prophet (pbuh): "If a man performs two rakas of Salah without the distraction of any worldly thought, all his previous sins will be forgiven." (Bukhari.)|`|SzqeeUxgaa	Focus on the words.

If your mind starts to drift....think to yourself "i'm praying".......|`|9p2wQ21Aaa	The following things will help you, Insha Allah, keep your concentration while praying:     1. Intention should be in the heart. That is the real place of intention. Intend that you are praying to Allah Almighty and only for His sake. Focus on the nature of the prayer you are making. Is it an obligatory prayer or a supererogatory one? Are you praying Fajr, Zuhr, `Asr, Maghrib or `Isha and any other prayer? How many prayer units or rak`hs you intend to pray and whether you are praying alone or with the congregation? The clearer you are in your intention, the better will be your attention and concentration.     2. Perform your prayers on their appointed times without delay.     3. Perform your prayer according to the sunnah of the Prophet (peace and blessings be upon him).     4. Stand upright. Keep your eyes open and look at the place of your prostration or sujud while your are standing. In bowing or ruku` look at your feet, in sujud towards the floor and in the sitting position at your lap or your hands.     5. Do not play with your hands and do not rub your face, body or clothes. Be as quiet and still as possible.     6. Think yourself in the Presence of Allah and Allah is facing you.     7. Do not rush your prayers (i.e., to perform your prayers in haste). Rather, you ought to perform every part of your prayer with care and in a relaxed manner.     8. Recite the words carefully. Pay attention to what you are saying. You should learn the meaning of various supplications or du`as in prayer.     9. Implore Allah earnestly to help you in your prayers and to accept your prayers. The Prophet (peace and blessings be upon him) used to say, "Allahumma a`inni `ala dhikrika wa shukrika wa husn `ibadatika (O Allah help me in remembering You, in thanking You and in worshipping You in the best way).     10. Finally, remember that haram food, haram income and sins take away the joy and concentration in prayer. Keep yourself pure and clean as much as you can.     May Allah guide you to the Straight Path, and direct you to that which pleases Him, Amen.                 Allah Almighty knows best.    http://www.islamonline.net/servlet/Satel...|`|AA11441260	w alykm slm w rhmtllh w brkth!    why the need to concentrate?  just let go , relax your mind, body tension, deep slowly and deeply,  flow with the environment and just return you thoughts to your prayers when the mind drifted.  closing of the eyes is not allowed though.|`|zKQKl9mZaa	How do we concentrate in salah? From the Sunnah of the Prophet sal Allaahu alayhi wa sallam we are taught the following:    1. Come early for salah and prepare yourself to concentrate.  Repeat the adhan to yourself with the muadhdhin and after the adhan, say the prescribed supplication. Between the adhan and iqamah make dua. Do wudu properly, cleansing your mouth, and wear your finest clothes.    2. Aim to get the entire reward of your salah.  Abu Bakr ibn Iyaash said, I saw Habeeb ibn Thabit in sujood. If you saw him you would think he was dead (by how long he held his sujood).    3. Contemplate the aayaat and adhkaar being recited during the prayer.  Think about the meanings of the verses that you are reciting. Isnt is disheartening that someone may perform salah for decades, day after day, and he still does not know what he is saying? The Quran was revealed to be pondered over! Allah revealed:    (This is) a Book (the Quran), which We have sent down to you, full of blessings that they may ponder over its verses, and that men of understanding may remember (As-Saad 38/29).    4. Pray in congregation. Allah subhaanahu wa taaala commands:    And perform salah, give zakah, and bow with those that bow (Al-Baqarah 2/43).    5. Never miss your Nafl (supererogatory) Prayers, especially those that the Prophet sal Allaahu alayhi wa sallam used to pray constantly, like Witr and the Sunnah of Fajr.    6. Do not rush your salah.  Take your time and do not allow your salah to become the most invaluable action of your day. Ibn Wahb said, I saw Ath-Thowree at the Kabah. After Maghrib, he got up to pray and then prostrated. He did not come out of that prostration until the adhan for Isha was given.    7. Know that Allah responds to your prayer. The Prophet sal Allaahu alayhi wa sallam said:    Allah, the Blessed and Exalted has said: I have divided the prayer between Myself and My slave, into two halves, and My slave shall have what he has asked for. [From Surah Fatiha] When the slave says, Praise be to Allah, Lord of the Worlds, Allah says, My slave has praised Me. When the slave says, The Most Merciful, the Bestower of Mercy, Allah says, My slave has extolled me. When the slave says, Master of the Day of Judgement, Allah says, My slave has glorified me. When the slave says, It is You alone we worship and it is You alone we ask for help, Allah says, This is between Me and My slave, and My slave shall have what he asked for. When the slave says, Guide us to the straight path, the path of those whom You have favoured, not the path of those who receive Your anger, nor of those who go astray, Allah says, All these are for My slave, and My slave shall have what he asked for" (Muslim).    8. Pray with a barrier (sutrah) in front of you and pray close to it.  Another thing that will help you to have khushoo (concentration) is paying attention to the matter of having a sutrah and praying close to it. Having a sutrah will restrict your field of vision, protect you from the Shaytaan, and keep people from passing in front of you, which causes distraction and reduces the reward of the prayer. The Prophet sal Allaahu alayhi wa sallam said:    When any one of you prays, let him pray facing a sutrah, and let him get close to it (Abu Dawood).    9. Seek refuge in Allah from the Shaytaan.  The Prophet sal Allaahu alayhi wa sallam taught us how to combat the whispers of Shaytaan. Abul-Aas radi Allahu anhu reported that he said, O Messenger of Allaah, the Shaytaan interrupts me when I pray, and I get confused in my recitation. The Messenger of Allah sal Allaahu alayhi wa sallam said, That is a shaytaan whose name is Khanzab. If you sense his presence, seek refuge with Allah from him, and spit [dry] towards your left three times. Abul-Aas rahi Allahu anhu said, I did that and Allah took him away from me (Muslim).    10. Pray as if you were told that after salah you would be going back to Allah. Abu Bakr Al-Muzanee said, If you want your salah to benefit you, then say, I shall die after this Salah!|`|ATnsdr8Caa	Wa'alaykumussalaamu warahmatullaahi wabarakaatuh..    just remember that Allah always see you all the time..    and always think that you do your pray not for the jannah (heaven/paradise), but to show our loves to Allah..    and also, know the meaning of the saying (praying text) will be very helpful in order to make you more concentrate in do prayer..  feel it..|`|B3gREJOEaa	I block out my Doenya thoughts and activities in my head.

When you know and understand what you are saying then the words come out of your heart. This makes it easier to concentrate.  We easily fail to concentrate when we recite a memorized surah and don't know what Allah is saying us in this surah.    Secondly to block the voices in the house from the talks of family members, it is best to go in a room, close the door and then perform your salat by raising your voice high enough that you can hear yourself and aslo you know what you are saying to Allah. Being all alone in a closed room will help you block the external voices and the knowledge of what you recite help you concentrate in Salat and blocks the other thoughts keep coming in our mind during salat.     We can't block our wandering thoughts when we don't know what we are saying and we are simply repeating the words from our memory  which doesn't require concentration.  That is why we fail to concentrate in our salats.    Hope it will help you.     Wassalam, urs AM

A potion (Wicked, evil, cruel potion) To turn people Gay has been invented, (respectively by the poison apple lady in Snow White) Who do you test it on? how do you convince them to drink it?  -- My step brother - and I get him to drink it by telling him that its a new type of protein shake.    5.

I proposed to her the next morning.     7. Im learning boring History (Yr 10 History is a Drag) in class, will you do my homework?

ieEHhps6aa	Okay, in a girl's point of view, i think it would be sweet, if i had feelings for you or at least thought you were cute in some way. Now, if you see that she pays attention to you when you talk and she wears lipgloss and looks nice all the time around you, then she likes you. Only then can you go for the song and expect her to like it and not think you are a freak or weird(or creepy).  GOOD LUCK BUDDY!!!!!

rItaulkDaa	You should try and step out on your own and learn about yourself don't let her hold you back even though you love her(or think you do I can't and won't judge the situation as I don't know all the details) I know I would have been happier if I had taken the time to explore myself and what I want in life between the time i was old enough to date ect and now but I was stuck hiding in a lie to make my mom happy, thinking that I had to be straight for her and the grief from when she died drove me to just date another guy that I really honestly had no feelings for...so here I am stuck in a relationship with someone I really don't love and don't want to be with...the point is you don't want to wind up in a cage if you aren't TRULY sure of what you want...keep that in mind when making your decision...because in the end it is about making yourself happy, not her...if in the end you ultimately aren't happy and you are miserable she won't really be happy either because it will all be fake...    As for being back with her in the end if you really want to be you need to talk to her about it...you honestly can't expect her to wait for you especially if she is religous and won't understand the situation...that's life...and I hope that she will understand but if she doesn't then you will have to choose between what you think you want and what you have right now and that is what really sucks...but that's life...      and I know you said only 25 year olds and older should answer this but I thought what I have to say might be relevant (I'll be 22 this year so I still count as an adult so please don't sell me short just cause of my age)|`|IM1bLPf6aa	Dude your only young once mate if you dont do it now you will never be happy trust me!

Nf0FLjGhaa	they don't, that's why it's called "faith". and a pre-emptive strike: the bible and your belief are NOT proof, period|`|eYs8DpbBaa	Well since adam and eve are actually generic names for man and woman, and not proper names there had to have been a first man and woman at some point in time. There had to be a beginning for humans. It may or may not have been like the Bible said, but there did have to have been a first man and woman.

Weather or not he was as described in the Bible is a whole other issue.|`|ReTPKcfEaa	there is no exact evidence that Jesus existed people just put faith in to their beliefs  there are three approaches to relgion  fundamentlists - who take eveything in the bible true so adam and eve happened, miraclesh happened whatever is said in the bible is historically and factually true  liberal- those who d o not beleive adam and etc creation etc is true its just a way of expressing Gods power and the stories in the bible are symbolic  and then there is conservative -who are in between they realise some of the bible is so outrageous to occur but some parts cud be true  depending on what you belive will depend if you think they actualy existed but there is no ACTUALY proof.|`|4pDvXONeaa	The stories behind the possibilities of them existing worked on the uneducated peasants of the time.

"Now faith is the substance of things hoped for, the evidence of things not seen." Hebrews 11:1    "All scripture is given by inspiration of God, and is profitable for doctrine, for reproof, for correction, for instruction in righteousness" 2 Timothy 3:16    "Jesus saith unto him, I am the way, the truth, and the life: no man cometh unto the Father, but by me." John 14:6|`|Q6qyfPkRaa	B/C God tells his ppl the truth! and if u dont know that these ppl existed,i can assume you are not a child of GOD!    Sweetheart how old are you. i ask b/c of the additional details u added? it is a well know biblical fact that YES, adam and eve's children were incestuous and YES we in fact are all related and this can be proved through science! We are all brothers and sisters on this earth however the family tree has become so populous that we arent able to trace the connections and this is why GOD outlawed incest and this can be found in the book of genesis. This is also why ppl in the world today do not claim everyone as a relative, b/c they do not even know how they are realted! God saw that the earth was well populated and demanded that incest should no longer occur. Your understanding of the world and the bible is very young and honey, you have to do some more studying in history, science, biblical studies, african studies, philosophy etc etc. to be able to completely understand what goes on in this forum. at least from the serious posters!   P.S. there is actual documentation that Jesus was a man over in Orthodox rome that was a great historical figure of his time, said to perform miracles, and in fact a lot of the biblical events are also recorded and can be seen today!  Also, not everyone tha is inbred have problems.. besides you need to study biology and DNA sequencing and gene pooling, this will explain that ur reference to why no heart problems.. especially when the genes have been pooled over generations and generations!  Now, i ask u, how can we be sure they didnt exist?|`|HrQDQvUUaa	God and Adam and Eve cannot be physically proven for obvious reasons. God has said that no one can see His face and live, and any evidence of Adam and Eve was destroyed by the Flood.    Jesus on the other hand, we DO have evidence for from  contemporaries who wrote of Him;    Roman historian Cornelius Tacitus wrote of Christians, stating that Christus (Christ) was the founder of the faith, saying;    Christus, from whom the name had its origin, suffered the extreme penalty during the reign of Tiberius at the hands of one of our procurators, Pontius Pilatus, and a most mischievous superstition, thus checked for the moment, again broke out not only in Judaea, the first source of the evil, but even in Rome, where all things hideous and shameful from every part of the world find their centre and become popular.     Contemporary Jewish historian Flavius Josephus also mentioned Him in his writings;    "There was about this time Jesus, a wise man, if it be lawful to call Him a man, for He was a doer of wonderful works. He was Christ. Pilate, at the suggestion of the principal men among us, condemned Him to the cross. He appeared to His followers alive again the third day."     So we have historical evidence of Jesus outside of the Bible, and written historical proof that He founded the Christian faith and died on the cross at the hands of Pontius Pilate and the principle men (Pharisees and Sadducees) of Judea just as the Bible states.|`|AA11225089	You could try reading 'why trust the Bible' by Amy Orr-Ewing, or any of the 'case for......' books (link provided).    There is a huge amount of evidence for the Bible being true.

He may be an amalgamation of a bunch of messiahs that were around Judea at that time, or he may have existed but there is no mention of him being executed or doing anything miraculous in the Roman records.    There is no evidence outside of the holy books that Adam&Eve existed and genetic studies would appear to completely refute the idea that the human race started from 2 individuals.    There is no evidence that any god exists, never mind evidence showing exactly which god or gods (Allah, Trinity, Yaweh, Ra, Thor etc.) it is.|`|37LKDbtsaa	Simple, you don't.|`|OJShm63saa	read some holy books|`|AA11992885	well, Adam and Eve are not said to be the first humans according to Genesis, only the first ones NAMED in the story, a starting point of humanity, probably the most current level of evolution    jesus existed, it just matters to your perception, as, anyone with a BRAIN can see just how much of a sinner he was    God, define God and HE exists, define HIM in a different way and HE doesn't|`|AA12218857	We don't.

Then it may perhaps you can take some samples from them on how they deal with the problems on the way they are, while then perhaps you could have yourself sample of ideas on how you gonna deal with, or perhaps you may leave them for your own goodness as to live happily like others..  Other things are, please don't too much trust yourself on what you understood about people, cause it might down you.  Try to let everything goes as it is...and please.. don't try to dig them up again after you had accomplished deal with them..Hope it helps...

Jesus did not say love the lovely, the rich and the good, your family nor your friends but He teaches us to love the poor, the needy, and the oppressed or your enemy and the suffering even the fate of death, this will produce the true qualities of love in you.

Sometimes we have to get to the point in life that we do not depend upon someone else (human) to make us happy.  Would you feel bad if you died today and the most wonderful person came into your life to-marrow?   You never know who God has lined up for you and  how it works according to His plan.  You are young and I am old and I have learned I do not trust myself to make the best decisions for my life.  Try to learn to trust God and ask Him to send you the one which He has picked out for you.

zXcVLanAaa	Well, you certainly made me feel better about my life!      But seriously, you're having a low point, but it's not going to last forever is it? And yes life totally sucks, even if you were rich, could drive, had a boyfriend, you would no doubt still feel that life sucks!     You need to focus your time and energy on things that will improve your situation. Don't try and rush it, take one thing at once.  Start thinking of a plan to find a job for instance, maybe part time so you can get more education.  If you don't know what to do with your future (not many do, myself included) go for a course at college that's quite open, like psychology/sociology.    Make a list of ideas on how to come back out of your bad situation and slowly tick each thing one by one.  See it as a challenge, relax and you will see things slowly improve.    Oh and go easy on your family....it sounds like at the moment you need them   :)|`|61ddfb6410cdb1fde97533401cf0a601aa	just be like everybody else, be a nobody.|`|IM1bLPf6aa	Yeah your far from alone mate!

7258da4c2329311982666e5727f6ae14aa	My opinion on the topics?    1. Not hard at all for me I could live without people in my life all together since I'm that kind of person. Socializing with people is something that I have to do not something that I like to do.     2. It depends on how you define "good use". I'm sure many of them feel that they are doing what they want to do and that it's not a waste of time. But being from an older generation I see many things that I think they could have done with their time instead and I do think that they waste their time at times.     3. Being respectful, understanding and willing to work through conflicts helps.    4. Get new politicians into power (the ones we have are idiots when it comes to solving traffic problems), build a bridge to let traffic bypass the central area and the "bottle neck" situation there, and forbid car traffic in the central area unless it have permission for spacial reasons.

It states clearly that Jesus has a father in heaven. It does not mention any 'trinity'. It says that Satan will end up in  the "lake of fire". The same 'lake where death and 'Hades' [ Hell] will end.  so it cannot be a place of eternal punishment for people.  The 'lake' must simply be elimination and destruction.  (Revelation 20:10) And the Devil who was misleading them was hurled into the lake of fire and sulphur, where both the wild beast and the false prophet [already were]; and they will be tormented day and night forever and ever.  (Revelation 20:14) And death and Hades were hurled into the lake of fire. This means the second death, the lake of fire.  ITS THE SAME LAKE.      That Jesus judges but God does not. That means that Jesus cannot be God himself.  (John 5:22) For the Father judges no one at all, but he has committed all the judging to the Son,  That AlmightyGod has a NAME...  (Exodus 6:3) And I used to appear to Abraham, Isaac and Jacob as God Almighty, but as respects my name Jehovah I did not make myself known to them.

The questions usually asked are:-    1) Did Jesus really exist?  2) Is Jesus God?  3) If Jesus is God, then why did He keep praying to the Father in Heaven? How can the Father and Jesus be one God? Why did Jesus have to suffer on the Cross?  4) What is the Holy Spirit?  5) What is so special about Jesus? Why cant I just view him as an ordinary man or a teacher or a prophet? Why should I see him as God?      It would not be possible to give a short answer to these questions .    I suggest you visit the below website.    After visiting the below website, you would get a lot of answers.    http://jesustrinity.blogspot.com    1.Thomas calls Jesus God in John 20:28 (Note, Thomas addresses Jesus  specifically.)  2. Jesus is God in Heb. 1:8  3. John the apostle states that Jesus was the Word which was God that became  flesh (John 1:1-14)  4. The phrase "Call upon the name of the LORD" (Hebrew, YHWH, i.e., Psalm  116:4) used only of God on the OT, and translated into the Greek in the LXX as  "Call upon the name of the LORD (greek, KURIOS)," applied to Jesus in the NT  (1 Cor. 1:2) Jesus is God in flesh  5. The apostle John says that Jesus was , "...calling God His own Father,  making Himself equal to God," (John 5:18)  6. Jesus said that He and the Father are One (John 10:30), that caused the Pharisees to  claim that Jesus was making Himself out to be God.  7. Jesus knew all things (John 21:17)  8. Jesus knew all men (John 16:30)  9. Jesus is everywhere (Matt. 28:20)  10. Jesus Christ, dwells in you (Col. 1:27)  11. Jesus is the exact representation of the Nature of God (Heb. 1:3)  12. Jesus is eternal (Micah 5:1-2)  13. Jesus gives eternal life (John 10:27-28)  14. Jesus is our only Lord and Master (Jude 4)  15. Jesus is called the Mighty God (Isaiah 9:6)  16.

Jesus is worshiped (Matt. 2:2-11; Matt.14:33; Matt.28:9; John 9:35-38;  Heb. 1:6) Only God can be worshipped (Matt. 4:10) (same Greek word for worship  is used in each place.)  21. In the OT God was seen (Exodus 6:2-3;Exodus 24:9-11; Num. 12:6-9; Acts  7:2), yet no man can see God (Exodus 33:20; John 1:18). It was not the Father  that was seen in the OT (John 6:46). Who, then were they seeing? See John  8:58.  22. Jesus claimed the divine name, "I AM", for Himself in John 8:58 see  Exodus 3:14.  23.

My reply will share Truth with you regarding Jesus who is God the Son, the second person of the Trinity.    Question: "Is Jesus God? Did Jesus ever claim to be God?"    Answer: Jesus is never recorded in the Bible as saying the exact words, I am God. That does not mean, however, that He did not proclaim that He is God. Take for example Jesus words in John 10:30, I and the Father are one. At first glance, this might not seem to be a claim to be God. However, look at the Jews reaction to His statement, We are not stoning you for any of these, replied the Jews, but for blasphemy, because you, a mere man, claim to be God (John 10:33). The Jews understood Jesus statement to be a claim to be God. In the following verses, Jesus never corrects the Jews by saying, I did not claim to be God. That indicates Jesus was truly saying He was God by declaring, I and the Father are one (John 10:30). John 8:58 is another example. Jesus declared, "I tell you the truth, before Abraham was born, I am!" Again, in response, the Jews take up stones in an attempt to stone Jesus (John 8:59). Why would the Jews want to stone Jesus if He hadnt said something they believed to be blasphemous, namely, a claim to be God?    John 1:1 says that the Word was God. John 1:14 says that the Word became flesh. This clearly indicates that Jesus is God in the flesh. Acts 20:28 tells us, "...Be shepherds of the church of God, which He bought with His own blood." Who bought the church with His own blood? Jesus Christ. Acts 20:28 declares that God purchased the church with His own blood. Therefore, Jesus is God!    Thomas the disciple declared concerning Jesus, Lord and my God (John 20:28). Jesus does not correct him. Titus 2:13 encourages us to wait for the coming of our God and Savior - Jesus Christ (see also 2 Peter 1:1). In Hebrews 1:8, the Father declares of Jesus, "But about the Son He says, "Your throne, O God, will last for ever and ever, and righteousness will be the scepter of your kingdom."    In Revelation, an angel instructed the Apostle John to only worship God (Revelation 19:10). Several times in Scripture Jesus receives worship (Matthew 2:11; 14:33; 28:9,17; Luke 24:52; John 9:38). He never rebukes people for worshiping Him. If Jesus were not God, He would have told people to not worship Him, just as the angel in Revelation had. There are many other verses and passages of Scripture that argue for Jesus deity.    The most important reason that Jesus has to be God is that if He is not God, His death would not have been sufficient to pay the penalty for the sins of the whole world (1 John 2:2). Only God could pay such an infinite penalty. Only God could take on the sins of the world (2 Corinthians 5:21), die, and be resurrected - proving His victory over sin and death.|`|pSNSlRlRaa	Yes, even Jesus serves the Father Yahweh/Jehovah.

God bless|`|2vf6tu8Oaa	Jesus is not God, nor the son of god. why ? cause he is a flesh only.  On what had happened to him was called as a prophet hood methods.  I am a Christian myself, and in my spiritual journeys, I found that method had been known as a level in spiritual rank which called a human has raised in one with God, those explanations and wisdom were came to me on Jesus revelation in my many transcendence conditions while praying, and Jesus told me that everybody could have the same spiritual level like him by surrendering truly on their minds, bodies and souls, only to the One Creator, which is only The One God who created every things with all known for the secrecy of His creations.   Jesus said that the spirit of all humans were all only came from One God, that He is Himself blown His Holy spirit into humans bodies eventually, to make them could feel the presence of God on their hearts of each people, by their understanding level of the presences of other God's creations, like earth, sky and all creatures living upon them.  Jesus said that, God never differ any human from the way they do for pray to Him, but only by their true believes in their hearts to God.Cause only by true heart, they may find peace for their life.  Perhaps it might looks unfamiliar, but if you do really want to seek the truth trough the Bible, perhaps you may start now to pray to God, in order to reveals about all truths, by means through Jesus himself explain them to your own hearts.  And by one way of those or another, you may could have the truth in Bible by yourself eventually, and I am telling you that is true my friends, no lies.

HDgvOJyLaa	To the LORD BUDDHA who now lives in HEAVEN and watch over the MOTHER EARTH.     I'm Buddhist and I believe in more than one God in general.      When I was little, I pray to the shinning star(s), sky and heaven or other Gods in heaven.         Edited:  Is Jesus your God? Not!  Jesus and Buddha are the same we look up to them for compassion and etc.  They both are the sons of Lord God, and Lord Buddha one rule middle heaven and one rule upper heaven. There are four separate level of heaven,  King of heaven ruled upper level  Buddha ruled middle level  Other Gods ruled second level  Other spirits ruled the first level  >>>>>>>>HELL would be like a prison for all the sins people to be punished, torture, and never die. For years and years then they will be reborn again. That's why babies are born with the blue birthmarks. Nobody is perfect.     We are born over and over until we have accomplished our mission and gain knowledge, wisdom, and the laws and rules of every beings and respect every living things. So, we can evolved into a higher power or spirit and reborn again to be leader or rich and famous or whatever we desired to do when we have reach that level.     We as a human beings need to be open minded, accepting, understanding and we are here on this mother earth to learn, practice, teach, and we each have missions to accomplish.|`|8pQrIL90aa	They pray to a god that isnt a god. Their prayers are sadly without power.|`|YQMCVuFiaa	"Who is supposed to help them in their needs?"    Not everyone needs a crutch on life ;)|`|h3gMzNS3aa	They're not praying to anything. They're humbling themselves for the sake of humility itself and letting go of ego. What they're saying and thinking are buddhist teachings and dogma, such as "I bow before the the idea of enlightenment, the teachings and the community of teachers".    In Buddhism if you're praying or asking outside forces for help then you're on the wrong track; you'd actually considered to be going backwards not forwards.    EDIT: Wee one- in thai temples they chant for the transference of merit and specifically say they wish the good merit to pass on to their dead family members. I think it's a bit selfish to focus it on one's clan.    Buddhists do chant to devas (spirits) too but it's minor and not integral. They invite the spirits to listen to the chanting and receive merit~ there's one specific chant on this which sounds really beautiful. I asked a monk "do the Devas know the Pali language? If they don't how do they understand what the chanting's about?"|`|dDSuBQURaa	To the Enlightened one so they can reach Nirvana.

And in light of verse []4:86] I would say that if it is deliberate then yes it must be a sin....but not if unintentional. In the latter case it would just be a sign of not having good manners. Of course Allah subhana wa ta'ala knows best.     "When a (courteous) greeting is offered you, meet it with a greeting still more courteous, or (at least) of equal courtesy. Allah takes careful account of all things." [Qur'an 4:86]  ---------------------------    ".....Lo! the noblest of you, in the sight of Allah, is the best in conduct. Lo! Allah is Knower, Aware. " [Qur'an 49:13]    "The Believers are but a single Brotherhood: So make peace and reconciliation between your two (contending) brothers; and fear Allah, that ye may receive Mercy." [Qur'an 49:10]    Abu Hurairah (radiAllahu anhu) related that Rasulullah (salallahu 'alayhi wa salaam) said, "You shall not enter Heaven unless you have Faith and your Faith is not complete until you show love towards one another. Would you want me to show you how you can achieve this? Shower your Salam upon one another."     Abu Hurairah (radiAllahu anhu) related that Rasulullah (salallahu 'alayhi wa salaam) said, "Let the one who is driving give salam to the one walking; let the one who is walking give the salam to the one sitting; let those who are small in number (or alone) give salam to those who are in a larger group and let the younger one give salam to the elderly."     Anas (radiAllahu anhu) related that Rasulullah (salallahu 'alayhi wa salaam) said, "O my son, when you enter the house of your family, give the salam so that you and your family may receive Allah's blessing."     Umar (radiAllahu anhu) reports that he was riding with Abu Bakr (radiAllahu anhu) on one mount. When they passed by people, Abu Bakr (radiAllahu anhu) greeted them saying: 'Assalamu alaikum' and they replied: 'Wa alaikum assalam wa rahmatu Allah.' Or he may greet them saying: 'Assalamu alaikum wa rahmatu Allah,' for which their reply was: 'Wa alaikum assalam wa rahmatu Allah wa barakatuh.' Abu Bakr (radiAllahu anhu) commented: "Today, people have gained much more than us."  [Sahih al-Bukhari in Al-Adab Al-Mufrad]    ?

Thus Allah makes clear the Ayat to you that you may understand.  (chap.24--verse.61)    The Noble Qur'an An-Nisa 4:86: When you are greeted with a greeting, greet in return with what is better than it, or (at least) return it equally. Certainly, Allah is Ever a Careful Account Taker of all things.     Ibn Katheer raheemahullaah explained this verse by saying: "If the person greeted you with the Salaam you should reply in a better form, or reply similarly. However, the extended form is preferable, but the shorter is compulsory. Which means that greeting is preferable but the greeting in return is compulsory, and it should be in the form of the Salaam and not in any other form."|`|lh2H5oSOaa	Yes it is. The better Muslim and more closer to Allah is who is the first to say salam alaikum.    It is a sign of  end time that people will say salam to only those they know.

dc00e6f724cc094e75dc0475843d0e44aa	Mormons is the slang term but we are officially members of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints.  LDS.    The term some apply to us, "Mormons" comes from our belief in another testament of Christ, one given to the ancient inhabitants of the Americas, called the Book of Mormon.    There are members across the world.|`|93fc57ca1c692acd2bd8f1bc7a446e6eaa	An "elder" in The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (Mormon) is a holder of the Melchizedek Priesthood and the two that you encountered are serving missions for the church, teaching the gospel of Christ to all that are willing to listen and learn.  We are not a "cult" as some claim.  We are as Christian as can be.  We love our neighbors and strive to reach out in service when and where we can.  Do not be afraid to let them in.  They will only talk as much as you want them to.|`|TzY9vkinaa	Mormons is a nickname for Latter-Day Saints.    If you practice polygamy you will be excommunicated from our church. So no, we don't practice it.    Elder is just a title we give the missionary men, it has to do with the priesthood they hold.    PS- someone said one of our books promotes polygamy... yup, that would be the Bible.|`|n7hezV5aaa	You already got your answer, but let me just say that your politeness and willingness to please other people is not overwhelming but is bordering excessive. I wouldn't give my phone number to people like that nor to any stranger that just seemed polite.|`|QYu8KrXTaa	HI, People in cults are usually OK. They are brainwashed into believing the weirdest anti Christian doctrine. They are allowed to deceive you into joining them. They don't tell you the strange bits until you are in it.Their book is a copy of another even though it is supposed to be a secret "seer" translation of ancient Egyptian.. Their archaeology isn't there. They believe God was once a man like us and has advanced. Jesus and Satan were something like brothers. Apparently women only get to Heaven if their husbands let them. People have left them and reported what goes on with them. Of course they condemn anyone who tells the truth about them like Ex Mormons, Jerald and Sandra Tanner, have examined three different handwritten manuscripts of the first vision written by Smith or his scribes and all are different. They declare ultimately it  becomes very difficult to believe Smith ever had the vision.    If you are seeking the truth read the Gospel of John, The book of Acts and Genesis. To be saved you need to  believe Jesus died on the cross taking the blame and the punishment for your sin and ask Him into your life. Be  willing to turn from sin with His help. Now live for Him by worshipping God, learning of Him in His Word the  Bible and owning Him before others. May God bless you as you seek the TRUTH.  nev r|`|BtygS0Hraa	Yes, Latter Day Saints and Mormons are the same people.  We are not a cult, and you will be excommunicated for practicing polygamy.  They are serving God, and may be very, very far from home.  "Elder" is a title given to the missionaries, and is also an indicatior of someone in the Church who holds the Melchizedek Priesthood.  I strongly recommend talking to them, they will be respectful of you, and will not force anything on you.  Missionaries will only ask or challenge you to do something, and it is still your choice.  Once again, don't worry about them being cultists, they are not.  Treat them well, and God will bless you for it.|`|q5lreoiWaa	I agree with everything Alissa says above, with the following to add:If you want to know about the LDS|`|AA11521494	Exactly the same thing.  The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints is commonly known as Mormon, because they have the Book of Mormon (and a couple of others) to go alongside the bible.    One of their books promotes polygamy, but they are not allowed to follow this doctrine as it is illegal.  I don't know what an elder is but just about all men in the Mormon church seem to have some title or other.  Mormons are all very respectable but their beliefs diverge a long way from orthodox Christianity, and so would be regarded by mainstream churches as a cult.|`|2MP9nYLdaa	yep a cult and if they phone ya tell them your not interested and hang up on em.|`|sSjdtI7Eaa	http://www.somethingawful.com/d/news/oh-...|`|2ZO7vFC1aa	Yes, they are Mormons.    They aren't cultists.    They aren't polygamists.    They aren't as bad as people make them out to be.    If you want to see what they stand for, check out the following site and judge for yourself     https://www.mormon.org|`|QDM3Y28laa	Mormons are Latter-Day Saints. Mormons is a nicknames given to us in the 1800s because we believe in the Book of Mormon. At one point, we were commonly known as the Mormonites.    We are members of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints. Those who are polygamists are members of Fundamentalist break-offs of the Church, like the Fundamentalist Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints and other splinter groups.    Elder is the title given to missionaries.     Most of that anti-Mormon propaganda stuff is untrue, but some are true but exaggerate or half-truths. If you want to know about our faith, just ask us.     We're not that weird. I do a good dinosaur impression, though.|`|2wUvFmrhaa	As a former member, I was not told much at all about real mormon doctrine, and real mormon history. I was a young adult, but this information would have been CRUCIAL.    Mormon youth and potential converts are kept in the dark, that's a fact. Mormon missionaries are taught to feed these groups the milk before meat. This means to come across as a normal Christian Church, and leave out the strange or controversial doctrines. (racist statements, sexist beliefs, real history, etc)    What Mormon Missionaries WON'T Tell You??    Here...  http://www.jesus-is-savior.com/False%20R...    I was not told a bit of that information. I had to find out Information on my own, because members are taught to sugarcoat, and intentionally leave *parts* out.    About polygamy....  One more thing. The LDS/ mormon church of today believes that all the polygamy of the past with be together forever. (to procreate, just like God is with us and his wife (wives).     Today if a mormon man is sealed and his wife dies, (or divorce) HE can remarry (be sealed) and have them both as wives in Heaven.     ***LDS state that they are not **practicing** polygamy because  the ones that are double sealed are waiting for Christ's return to attain their physical bodies. (this is the belief) so See they believe in it FULLY! About in their scriptures, its D and C 132.      Many LDS leaders and mormon men have done this.|`|Kwfo0aRvaa	Who are the Mormons?    The official name of the Mormon Church today is The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. Joseph Smith founded it at the age of 24, in the state of New York on April 6, 1830. It was originally named the Church of Christ, and then in 1834 the name was changed to the Church of the Latter Day Saints. In 1838 it received its current name (Doctrine and Covenants, Sec.115:4).    Joseph Smith proclaimed that God Himself had designated the LDS Church as "the only true and living church upon the face of the whole earth" (Doc. & Cov. Sec. 1:30).    The LDS Church claims to have the only true priesthood that is required to act in the name of God. A Prophet/President and his two counselors govern the church. Under them are twelve apostles and a group of men called the Seventies. These are the highest offices in their church.    They have four books of scriptures: the Bible, the Book of Mormon, the Doctrine and Covenants and the Pearl of Great Price.    Why are Mormon missionaries coming to my door?    The LDS Church claims to be the "only true church" and the only church with the authority to act in God's name. They do not accept any other church's baptisms. According to their teachings, their baptism is the only one recognized by the Lord. This belief, coupled with their belief in the need for a Mormon temple marriage to gain eternal life, compels them to take their message to the world.    Is the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints just another Protestant religion?    No, the Mormon Church does not claim to be Protestant. It claims to be a divine restoration of Christ's true church. It therefore rejects the validity of any other church. Its basic beliefs place it outside the standard doctrines of Christianity. Mormonism teaches that the God to whom they pray is but one of a whole series of gods who at one time were mortal then progressed to godhood. The LDS Church teaches that their Heavenly Father was once born as a spirit child of a god and wife who ruled a different world. After maturing as a spirit being he was sent to another world where he was born as a human. There he grew to maturity, married, died, was resurrected, went to heaven, progressed and eventually became the God of our world. He and his resurrected wife continue to have spirit children born to them in their heavenly realm. The Mormon man, accompanied by his wife, who is faithful to his religion, pays his tithe, attends the LDS temple rituals, etc. is hoping to eventually progress to become a god of another world, just like his Heavenly Father did.     Until recently, the missionaries were required to present Mormonism in six "discussions", which were a series of memorized sales talks. They are now encouraged simply to "follow the spirit" in their presentations. The basic message and approach, however, is still essentially the same. A thorough, thoughtful and balanced discussion of each of the six "official" lessons as the missionaries formerly presented them to investigators is at http://www.lds4u.com, together with the techniques and strategies which the missionaries are instructed to use. (The actual texts of the discussions were also on this site at one time, but the Mormon church threatened the webmaster with a lawsuit, and he removed them; click on "next" at each window to read a summary and commentary.)|`|T0xLpygfaa	" touch not these barking mad loonies with a twelve foot barge pole"    john 32:1.|`|T2zD3FS6aa	Latter Day Saints is another name for the Mormons, and yes, they are usually very nice and polite. In the sect's early history, they did practice polygamy, and a few small splinter groups still do. It is highly unlikely that the ones you talked to do.    The objection to them comes from their beliefs, which most people consider to be a little strange, and their tenacity in promoting those beliefs. Also, their church tend to exert a lot of control over it's members and they practice the shunning of apostates.    I'm not certain but I believe most people raised Mormon become "elders" in their teens, so no, it's not a very high rank.|`|Di7zRKEIaa	They write books about vampires...|`|z4dqIBpFaa	Mormons are some of the nicest, most polite, and consiterate people I have ever met. No, we are not polygamist. No, we are not a cult, we only worship God.    If you want to know more go to: mormon.org or lds.org|`|ZVfXqbNjaa	The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints is the same as "Mormon".  "Mormon" was a nickname given to us in our early years by those who hated us.    We are Christian and teach the Jesus Christ of the Bible instead of the Jesus that was formulated by the Nicene Council.    We are not a "cult" like you have heard.  We are a group of people who believe in God the Father, His Son Jesus Christ, that God still leads His people through prophets like is taught in the Bible, we strive to be kind, to serve all of those around us and to try to be the best people we can be.      Joseph Smith, in the early days of the church, was once asked how he could manage so many people.  He said that he teaches them true principles and they govern themselves.  No one in the church forces anyone to do anything.  That has been the way its been since the beginning and that is how it continues to be.    Someone posted that we shun apostates.  That is simply not true.   If someone who leaves the church and is rude and hateful to me I probably won't hang around them very much.  If anyone, whether they have ever been members of the church or not, is mean to me I probably  won't want to spend much time with them either.  But, it has nothing to do with their membership status.  In fact I have known people who were excommunicated and I had no idea until they told me.  I certainly couldn't tell by the way they were treated at church.  They were loved and respected the same as anyone else.    Our missionaries take 2 years out of their lives to serve God by teaching people about Jesus Christ.  Another purpose is to teach people the truth about us so that people won't be duped into believing the lies that are spread about the church.  Those missionionaries aren't paid to teach.  They serve at their own expense.  It is truly a labor of love, love for God as well as love for mankind.    I think that you will really enjoy visiting with the missionaries.  They are wonderful kind men and women who won't push you into doing anything you don't want to do.  I remember when the missionaries taught me, many years ago, I thought it was fascinating and opened up a whole new world of thought for me.  It blessed my life.

One of which is that lack of power.  Unintelligent people losing jobs & having no real alternatives pushes them into a life of crime.  Organizing and committing crimes together seems to be a way to protect oneself - but its not always true.      If you consider how complicated the drug business is - and how difficult it is to not get caught by the police (I'm referencing the big dawgs, not the little dealers) - you have to be pretty smart to run that kind of business.  I think the guys running the gang are obviously going to be smarter than the little gang banger that joins because he wants to be respected.      Could a drug dealer pass a calculus class?  I doubt it.      Could they have a better understanding of economics (supply vs demand, pricing, etc) and the distribution of goods than most of us?

A60fh6craa	Well, this hugely depends on the person, some people have the gift of learning languages easier than others.    All u have to do is practice EVERYDAY. Listen to many songs, try to write down the lyrics u hear, look them up in ur dictionary, better be an italian-italian dictionary, that way u acquire as much vocabulary as u can AND u get to learn how sentences r composed in italian (This applies to any other language).     Watch news in italian, they speak clearer than they do in films or TV shows.     Do cruciverba, gives u a lot of words too.

(=|`|htBHCNDtaa	Well I'm Romanian and I came to Australia when I was 6 months old and I didn't learn English that well cause my family wasn't speak it at home (even though they knew it fluently from learning it at school in Romania) and I ended up going to kindergarten not knowing English. Within a month I picked up a lot of words and my brother started conversing with me more and more and I learnt it simultaneously with Romanian, so basically it was easy.    I learnt Italian when I was 11 and it was a little easy since it's similar to Romanian, but all I remember is how to count from 1 - 10, say, "my name is..." and "good night", so that was a waste of a year, lol.    The best thing to do is the old LCWC (Look, Cover, Write, Check). Basically look at the word, cover it, write it down and then check if it's correct. Then after doing that you should memorise words better.|`|gFBDcfQGaa	Find italian friends to practice. In general, they are so lovely they will be pleased to help you learn their language. ( They are latinos !)  Ask your cable provider for RAI the italian television which is really good.  By the way, I learned english,portuguesse, italian and papiamento talking with my little friends when I was a child, but later I needed to learn the grammar by myself. Try your best, Italian is a wonderful language.    EXTRA BONUS FOR YOU. visit: http://www.aulafacil.com/Italiano/Cursoi...|`|WbVE1cXKaa	Well, the truth is you never stop learning, but combining my experience with watching others go through it, I would say it takes a several to many years of using the language on a daily basis before you get to the point of what I would call reasonable fluency, meaning you can converse and write with a native speaker without any real trouble.  (I am talking about learning a language as an adult and not as a child).    You can become functional, meaning you can get by speaking with people in the language, in a couple years or so.  By functional, I mean that you can talk to someone and they won't keep trying to switch into your language rather than suffer you in their language, and you will be able to understand them and they will understand you.  Writing takes way longer than speaking.     For me, it went in steps, I could read the language, then I could follow a conversation, then I could participate (speak and listen) in a conversation, then I could write without having a million mistakes.  And even now, after about 20 years, I still have a tendency to structure my statements in English form even though I am using french.    A huge jump occurs when you switch from always translating from english in your head to the other language aloud (and backwards when you listen) and actually start to think directly in the language, and that takes time and exposure.    Get a girlfriend or boyfriend according to your tastes and spend a lot of time with them solely in the language you are trying to learn.  That is a very good way to speed things up.  Watch tv in the other language too.  A lot.     Things will also go a lot faster if you almost never use your own language anymore.  Reality is that most of us only use the other language in public, so only about half the time at most is spent trying to use the other language, and this makes it take a lot longer to become fluent.|`|gSGQcgeLaa	I was learning and REMEMBERING basic Italian in about 2 weeks using Unforgettable Languages courses.

34ruM1eDaa	Have you done something to loose their trust? If you have I think you should work upon it. Im not much older than you are, but being from Indian family, I can tell you that your parents just want you to do well. They want they best for you, and thats why they are asking you to study. Whats wrong with studying? Dont you want to see yourself as a successful person with heaps of money? Then why dont you wish to study. Parents shouldnt need to tell you to study, you should do that on your own..without them telling.    If you are dressing way too indecently, I think your dad is ABSOLUTELY right to point out. Do you know what horrendous deeds are comitted in this world? Your parents dont want anything bad happpening to you & so they say all that. They have your best interests at heart.    How do you know they arent saving for your future studies?? And why are you so concerned about future studies if your not ready to study at age 13? I find that quite ironic.    I agree, your parents should NOT put pressure on you to excell nor should your mom beat you. The only solution to that is simple talking. Dont raise your voice. Tel your mum what you feel about all this..promise her, you will try your best in studies. If your doing your best, she shouldnt be beating you.

I have a lot of international friends, from Europe, and they are so uptight and high class sometimes that it is annoying.  So, kicking back every once in a while with a good friend makes my life seem so unhectic.    Listening to turkish or arabic music calms me down and puts me into my own world.

7BJ0YScwaa	Americans can't distinguish different British accents. It all sounds the same.|`|HXQ5cVzYaa	"British" in the West usually refers to England in general, while the accent expected to be heard from England is the King/Queen's English.

Ive never met an english-person who acts, sounds or looks like the way english people are portrayed on American TV, i mean, look at emily in Friends, ive never met any single english woman in my life who was even slightly like that, yet a faier amount of yanks assume we must be like that if their television tells them so.|`|ZoSpdTIbaa	Hugh Laurie, the doctor from House, is a perfect example. See how he acts in the clips from Ellen Degeneres' show about his show, and then how he talks out of the show. He's got a Brittish accent in real life, but in the show he has an American accent.|`|hVDchwOlaa	They are talking about the kind of British accent that the queen has. I think it sounds cute when a kid talks like that, but an adult sounds snotty. The beatles accent is much cooler.

Im just writing to say many thanks for inviting me to holiday with you in Torquay. Its just as well the weather was exceptional and we could do a lot of activities outdoors. I had a marvellous time. I hope you did too.    I had never imagined this town could be so beautiful with its Victorian villas and terraces gaze out to sea. It was fantastic to visit Kents Cavern, the beautiful gardens and listen to street musicians entertaining people with everything from opera to jazz.    When I got to Alicante I was given some nice news. At last I was going to be independent! My city council had given me a council housing! So Ive been very busy moving for the last month. I had to paint, buy some furniture and organize my new home. I think my flat looks very lovely in accordance with my personality. But one thing's certain; now I have to work harder at my new home than at my parents. I had a big house-warming party for my friends and we had a lot of fun but the following day I had to promise my neighbours not to make any fuss next time.    Ill tell you more things another day. Thanks again for everything and I expect you to come to Alicante very soon just as you promised me. Any season is good to visit my city as the sun is almost always shining.    Lots of love      Mara      PS I enclose a photo of the three of us in Paignton Zoo

Too bad most don't recognize it as a centuries-old dilemma: the impossibility of omnipotence.    Here's one for you, if God is omnipotent AND omniscient, could he prevent himself from doing something he already knew he was going to do?
QNNOCf4Kaa	LOL! This is one-third of me so listen to me...err him...whatever! I'm a mystery anyway and I will soon send people to confuse and baffle you with a word you cannot find in my own Word. Oh yeah and forget that one part in John 17:3 where my son or is it  me or is it my son who speaks by my ghost? Oh whatever! Can you believe I have a ghost too? Yeah it all confuses me too. Anyway, ignore John 17:3 because everlasting life doesn't really come from taking in knowledge of me like the Bible says, but listen to your Church leaders who cannot fully explain my nature either. I really want a relationship with you but I don't want you to know me. Make sense? It's true I created you and know your limitations of understanding and I could very well allow you to come to know me but keeping you off-balance and then watching you fight wars over religion makes for good entertainment. Especially those who say they believe in and worship my son and then go kill others who say and believe the very same thing. Ohhhh that is soooo pleasing to me!    Now that I think of it what I really should have inspired my servants to write was listen to your Church in whom I am well pleased and ignore my Son's teachings and those he had chosen to follow him because your Church leaders know me more than my own Son, whom I created before creating anything else (Col. 1:15) What? I didn't do that either because he is co-eternal like me, just like your Church leaders say? Wow, your Church leaders are never wrong, are they? How could they be with billions following them right? I mean how could they be wrong with billions following them? Every single Church is right that's why the path to heaven is so wide, right? Isn't that what my Word says? Wellllll, the Bible is confusing and you do need your Church leaders to tell you what it says, so do NOT read it for yourself. I don't want to confuse what I say and what they say. Do not investigate it. Do not meditate on it. Just listen to your Church. Give them lots of money too or I will send you to be tortured in a burning chamber for all eternity. Worship my son and give him my glory...I don't care if he said that the Father is looking for ones to worship ME in spirit and truth. No, you worship him and call him God. If your Church leaders say to do so, you just do it, no questions asked. If they make my Word a contradiction let it be so. They can give you salvation and raise you from the dead. That's why I give them the power to heal and speak in tongues still to this day.    Ok wait a minute...according to your Church I'm a liar and can't explain who I am clearly and plainly. Simple enough for all to understand...tell you what. Pick up your Bible, read it, and tell me if you believe my Word or that word of your Church? Who is really God? Will the one true God please stand up?    Who Is Jesus Christ?  http://www.watchtower.org/e/20050422/art...    Should You Believe in the Trinity?  http://www.watchtower.org/e/ti/index.htm|`|L6E6lDGKaa	    Doesn't this statement indicate Jesus is a part of God? We are a part of our parents. Jesus was also called Son of Man which infuriated the religious leaders of his time.|`|E9chZY74aa	Actually, what was happening there was for the benefit of the apostles who were there seeing it.  Moses the great law give and Elisha the great prophet of God were there.  God was saying, forget about them, the mantle has been passed, now listen to my Son.    Of course, this is one of the times when God gave witness to His Son as God and the one with the message.  Another time was when Christ was baptized as an example of what is commanded by God for us to do.  At that time, God spoke from Heaven and the Holy Spirit descended as a dove.|`|e4Mu7ci9aa	Because Jesus is the son of God , not God or God in the flesh to believe anything else would make this scripture sound silly .|`|P6atY3xXaa	Because Jesus is truly literally God's son.  He was God's firstborn son, the brightest of his morning stars long before he ever came to earth.    Job 38:7  KJV   7When the morning stars sang together, and all the sons of God shouted for joy?    Revelation 22:16  KJV  16I Jesus have sent mine angel to testify unto you these things in the churches. I am the root and the offspring of David, and the bright and morning star.    Debbie  debbiepittman@yahoo.com|`|UOBvuImUaa	Because the trinity is a belief of fools.|`|b8e321f3ad0d1eae90c1058863af7856aa	God created a son for himself...and was with him for a very long time before God suggested they make the earth. He watched how faithful this son was and his good qualities. And when he sent him to earth he knew he could trust Jesus, his son, to accomplish the task. And when he did he spoke through a dove....and told everyone there how proud he was of his son...He was not speaking to or of himself.    God is not a trinity.|`|91d4fbc3c75e4f7b862432c431187afcaa	Because you were born in sin & Jesus Chrst was not born in sin|`|IXBUaXDeaa	Because there is the holy trinity between the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit. They are three in one. The Father is God, the Son was God on Earth and the Holy Spirit works inside each of us. While they are different in form, they are all God. Just think of it as him in three different areas, but God none the less.    http://refbible.com/t/trinity.htm:  A word not found in Scripture, but used to express the doctrine of the unity of God as subsisting in three distinct Persons. This word is derived from the Gr. trias, first used by Theophilus (A.D. 168-183), or from the Lat. trinitas, first used by Tertullian (A.D. 220), to express this doctrine. The propositions involved in the doctrine are these: 1. That God is one, and that there is but one God (Deuteronomy 6:4; 1 Kings 8:60; Isaiah 44:6; Mark 12:29, 32; John 10:30). 2. That the Father is a distinct divine Person (hypostasis, subsistentia, persona, suppositum intellectuale), distinct from the Son and the Holy Spirit. 3. That Jesus Christ was truly God, and yet was a Person distinct from the Father and the Holy Spirit. 4. That the Holy Spirit is also a distinct divine Person.  The term "Trinity" is not a Biblical term, and we are not using Biblical language when we define what is expressed by it as the doctrine that there is one only and true God, but in the unity of the Godhead there are three coeternal and coequal Persons, the same in substance but distinct in subsistence. A doctrine so defined can be spoken of as a Biblical doctrine only on the principle that the sense of Scripture is Scripture. And the definition of a Biblical doctrine in such un-Biblical language can be justified only on the principle that it is better to preserve the truth of Scripture than the words of Scripture. The doctrine of the Trinity lies in Scripture in solution; when it is crystallized from its solvent it does not cease to be Scriptural, but only comes into clearer view. Or, to speak without figure, the doctrine of the Trinity is given to us in Scripture, not in formulated definition, but in fragmentary allusions; when we assemble the disjecta membra into their organic unity, we are not passing from Scripture, but entering more thoroughly into the meaning of Scripture. We may state the doctrine in technical terms, supplied by philosophical reflection; but the doctrine stated is a genuinely Scriptural doctrine.    I hope this helps:)|`|lNeDc5q2aa	While he was yet speaking, look! a bright cloud overshadowed them, and, look! a voice out of the cloud, saying: This is my Son, the beloved, whom I have approved; listen to him.     This clearly is God approving of his son , not God approving of himself , you can give fancy explanations how it may fit into a belief of the trinity but it clearly & simply would be a lie to say it does not show they are are not the same being.     I think the way religion has taught this lie & others is why so many have become atheist , they are smart enough to see through the lies but then do not trust the bible , Christianity has a lot to answer for .    With the trinity , you tell one lie to make it look true then you have to keep making up lies to cover the first lie as people question it.The truth is just plain & simple .

That's the really annoying thing about prophecies.  They're usually vague, and can be applied to anything.|`|zWj6HXHNaa	No|`|qRFTEBlGaa	Revelation 6:6 says:     John has more to tell us: And I heard a voice as if in the midst of the four living creatures say: A quart of wheat for a denarius, and three quarts of barley for a denarius; and do not harm the olive oil and the wine. (Revelation 6:6) All four cherubs are united in expressing a need to watch food supplies carefullyjust as the people had to eat bread by weight and in anxious care prior to Jerusalems destruction in 607?B.C.E. (Ezekiel 4:16) In Johns time, a quart of wheat was reckoned to be the daily ration for a soldier. How much would such a ration cost? One denariusa whole days wage! (Matthew 20:2) What if a man had a family? Well, he could buy three quarts of unpolished barley instead. Even that would feed only a small family. And barley was not viewed as a quality food such as wheat.     What is implied by the statement, Do not harm the olive oil and the wine? Some have viewed it as meaning that while many would be short of food and even starving, the luxuries of the rich would not be harmed. But in the Middle East, oil and wine are not really luxuries. In Bible times, bread, oil, and wine were viewed as staples. (Compare Genesis 14:18; Psalm 104:14,?15.) Water was not always good, so wine was widely used for drinking and sometimes for medicinal purposes. (1?Timothy 5:23) With regard to oil, in Elijahs day the widow of Zarephath, poor as she was, still had some oil left with which to cook her remaining flour. (1?Kings 17:12) Therefore, the command do not harm the olive oil and the wine appears to be advice not to use up these basic commodities too quickly but to be sparing in their use. Otherwise, they will be harmed, that is, they will run out before the famine ends.
VinxvzXcaa	Hi again! :D   lol    A glitch? nahhh.  Sounds natural to me tho.  Welll i think you should stop asking these questions on yahoo cause your clearly gay or bisexual, you shouldn't worry just let your feelings flow and just go with it.  I mean me and my friends kind of [used to cause we moved] kinda touch each other in ways well one of them would more touch me and the other than anything i'm not sure if we were just having fun or if maybe some of them liked girls more then guys, well i dunno some where along the line i have become quite attracted to girls, i didn't choose to it just happened and sometimes i think its because how close i was with my friends but then again i don't really know.  look really there is nothing weird about that at all!  i got called weird to many times tho but that wasn't because of that, that was because i was really different and a lot of the time was a complete idiot and enjoyed myself like hell and didn't care what anyone thought at all!   It's best just to let your feelings flow and don't let them go cause you might regret it, and i'm pretty sure me and my friends showed our feelings in one way or another we all say love you to each other because we all love each other as friends but i don't think i LOVE love them but you can't always be sure, i'm still working out my feelings and just letting them flow and its not going to take you a minuet to work out your feelings or if you like guys or girls.  So really just stop asking these questions on here! and just let your self be!    Well good luck with it alll again!

IYF4xSTdaa	sorry I have no answer..|`|acbqsZZbaa	Interesting reply from Full Armor. The tapeworm is beautifully designed to do what it does, and it cannot survive outside the human body, so where did it come from? If God did not make it did it evolve from something else? Did Satan make it? What about the tapeworms that infest other animals, like the hamster tapeworm (yes, really)? Were they the product of animal sin?    There are plenty of even nastier creatures. My favourite is the candiru, a fish that likes to swim into one of your bodily orifices...|`|XN0cYCATaa	All Human  Suffering (Including Tape Worms) is the result of human sin. The world is not the way that God created it and because of that, all are vulnerable to the affects of sin in the world. Why does one person suffer and another does not? Why do catastrophes happen to some and no others? It is because sin is in the world. But there will come a day when the Lord will return and cleanse this world of all sin and all suffering.     "And God shall wipe away all tears from their eyes; and there shall be no more death, neither sorrow, nor crying, neither shall there be any more pain: for the former things are passed away" (Rev. 21:4).|`|IHa6FxE6aa	There is no God, or Jesus.

AA11856921	This scripture is not referring to, say, an evangelist preaching to the public. The parable of different soil types (the sower and the seed) applies to public preaching. The instruction in Ecclesiates to which you are referring applies to giving scriptural advice about a specific life problem to someone that has absolutely no respect for God nor His advice. This verse, and those like it, are why I do not answer questions of atheists unless I think the question is phrased in a way that might injure the faith of others. Offering a Biblical answer to an atheist make as much sense as throwing a pearl of great price to a swine.|`|baa198aacdf80ead59f8f0fea0ada6f8aa	You make a good point, yet Christ preached the coming of His kingdom regardless of who believed or not.

When Paul or any other was preaching on the street corner, do you think for a second that everyone that stopped to listen believed a single word that he said? It is casting seed abroad, some of it takes root and some of it does not. All we can do is speak the truth and let God deal with the consequences, and if we have to suffer for it, so be it. It is the will of God, some good will come of it, even if we do not live to see it. Trust in Him and do not worry about those who do not believe. They have had their chance, and perhaps God will be merciful and grant them another chance at another time.|`|b1PvVoB0aa	There are a lot of pigs, here. But there are also a few sheep.

Luke 1:37     8 My thoughts are not your thoughts, and my ways are not your ways, declares the Lord. 9 Just as the heavens are higher than the earth, so my ways are higher than your ways, and my thoughts are higher than your thoughts. 10 Rain and snow come down from the sky. They do not go back again until they water the earth. They make it sprout and grow  so that it produces seed for farmers and food for people to eat.   11 My word, which comes from my mouth, is like the rain and snow. It will not come back to me without results. It will accomplish whatever I want and achieve whatever I send it to do.

I tried to tell my parents that I'm gay, firstly I tried to do it like a joke. Like, Hey mum and dad, I have a boyfriend ! Then they didn't care as much, because they thought I wasn't serious ! But when I really tried to explain them my father was mad and furious, my mother told me to stop talking like that, and they still don't believe me. They are still my parents and they think that I'm straight... I just can't make them accept the fact that I'm gay... But could you imagine how I felt ? Bad... My parents wouldn't accept me if they knew, and now I know that the only way to tell them is to show them ! It doesn't bugger me much if they reject me now, because I already live alone, the only bad thing would be getting money, 'cause my father is responsible for that.   Anyway my point is : Accept your son no matter who he is !   Even though it might look disgusting to you, you know that he is your son and whatever makes him HAPPY should make you happy too !|`|kwhPv1w3aa	I'd still love him and support him unconditionally.

If we had your last line wouldn't be there! There are some areas that people have to work on the Sabbath, health care and farmers come to mind. We take care of our sick and of our animals that depend on us. These are allowed.    Yes, it is one of the major commandments. This is the one commandment that really sets the people of Yahweh apart. It is His sigh or seal between us and Him. If we break it we can be forgiven, but we must ask for it. If we ignore it He might not know us or just ignore us!    Exodus 31:16  "Wherefore the children of Israel shall keep the sabbath, to observe the sabbath throughout their generations, [for] a perpetual covenant."  Exodus 31:17  "It [is] a sign between me and the children of Israel for ever: for [in] six days the LORD made heaven and earth, and on the seventh day he rested, and was refreshed."    Will we burn in hell forever? No. The wages of sin is death not eternal torment! That is a misunderstanding of Revalations that is talking about Satan and his minions (who are eternal spirits) not the humans that follow him or don't follow Yahshua the Messiah. Satan will buren forever, humans become ash or something simular instantly...after all it is a lake of fire.

Unfortunately some Muslims today have developed the wrong attitude by thinking that they are better than others, being better than others means being humble also and not constantly passing judgement upon others.   We must treat all people with respect and be rational. If you look closely at the life of our Beloved Prophet Muhammad (pbuh) you will find he was always rational in his thinking and the way he dealt with people even non-Muslims, he never became emotional and he showed tolerance, if only Muslims study his life closely and realize that there is a lot to learn from him and the excellent way in which he constantly remained rational and was fair and just to people. May peace prevail in our world InshaAllah.

You also have the choice of whether or not to act like an a** , so here's your answer :choose not to!  Nobody wants to be around negative, nasty behavior.  What are you really so angry about in the first place?|`|hZ9omSataa	try to be more conscious of your actions...|`|KHC2oE8iaa	you have to stop seeing people as idiots. if you can't say something that's going to help someone in a positive way without saying something regrettable, don't say nothing at all. corny and old school but it works. grumpiness huh? laugh more man. watch funny programs or read the comics section in the paper.|`|64d4893f2b5ad37e1908f80ec7b0c4c2aa	Figure out what is causing your anger first.  You can't control others, but you can control yourself.|`|slHUNl58aa	Ok Mike, first when you catch yourself being all pissed.. stop and take a few deep breaths, honestly, get you blood pressure down a notch.  Pay attention to see if you are clenching your jaws or just scowling out of habit.   Pay attention when you feel pissy to see if your shoulders are raised and tight or if your hands are making a fist at your sides when you are feeling like the great bungholio.  Your body language helps you stay aggitated and angry.. if you loosen up so will your mood. Try smiling as much as you can, not grimacing..smiling for real.   I know this may sound weird to you, but try it. Anger causes more anger because your brain chems get all hopped up on adrenaline.  I  bet your gritting your teeth or poking out your chest or doing some kind of stress posture while being a Jerk, that you may not be aware of because you are too mad to notice.  once you can cool yourself a bit before you go ahead and just say it or do it... and then regret it.  You can become calm enough to figure out what is really going on with your head. You will be abe to put stuff in better perspective.  Try it for your physical health too. I do wish you luck. Being angry is exhausting and no fun. The bummer is it can be addicting.  .|`|w74qWx0raa	How bout go to a bar and be a jerk real bad until someone punches you in your jerk head. Then repeat until you no longer wish to be a jerk.   I wonder what a jerk like you has to say back to an answer like that.    Haha seriously. good luck man|`|3zlD0fYZaa	Just change the way you look at people. Try to understand the underlying causes to why they might seem like idiots. And consider the possibility that you might have a flawed perspective of them and that you could be wrong about them being idiots. Humility is best way to go if you want to make sure you never treat anyone in an assholish manner. Cause if you think you are better than others, of course you are going to treat them like they are inferior.    Sometimes, you can't help being angry at people because it is not within your good judgement to show certain types of people sympathy. But do try to understand them, and that may reduce your amount of anger. You don't have to like them. Do understand that other people are like you too, and have their own opinions and values. Avoid violating their opinions and values especially when they hold on very strongly to them and refuse to change. Some people are just too stubborn. Let them be. Stubbornness has its own advantages.    I've noticed that alot of the time, miscommunication can cause a heck load of hatred between different parties. Establish a good method of communication with another without instigating misunderstandings, and you should be able to eliminate so many arguments that would have happened if communication was bad.    Edit: If somebody insults you with the actual intention of insulting you, ignore them. They aren't trying to help you anyway, so there is no point in socializing with them. But I don't think Rockisbeingkilled was trying to insult you. He was playing around. Read what he wrote carefully. You see? Misunderstanding.
