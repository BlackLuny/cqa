aYjF2SOKaa	It isn't my place to judge by any standards, but from my experience, it sounds like Sophie has had the living hell beaten out of her for doing puppy things.<br>  I had a 1year old labXborder collie, and he showed very similar traits, but he also had separation anxiety. He would howl and become very self-destructive if anyone even left the room without him. I believe he may have been in a similar situation, as the woman I 'rescued' him from had a small child, too. <br>  <br>  If she was mostly an outdoor dog, this will explain the poor potty-training. When the dogs are alone, I would suggest you separate the dogs, so Sophie's poor habits don't rub off on Roxy. <br>  <br>  The most important thing is to make sure both dogs know there is no favouritism. Spend equal amounts of time with each dog, praise them when they're good, and give them a firm 'NO' when they're not.<br>  <br>  As far as Sophie's behaviour is concerned, treat her as a young puppy again, start everything over as you did when you first trained Roxy.<br>  <br>  Use her name in a 'friendly' tone as much as possible when you're making a fuss of her, that way, she'll associate you calling her with good things. When she comes to you, offer her a small treat, so she knows she's done right. <br>  <br>  How is Sophies behaviour walking on a lead?<br>  Also, since they were separated from their litter, have they spent much time together as they grew up; i.e...Do they know each other well? <br>  And, is Roxy well socialised with other dogs?<br>  Sorry for all my questions! >.<<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  Edit: If you haven't tried walking sophie yet, I wouldn't suggest you take Roxy along for her first few walks, so that the two of you can can used to each other, as she may be very defiant on the lead and pull like crazy. But it is very important that when you do walk them, alternate which dog goes first, so that neither feels inferior to the other. If sophie seems to behave well on the lead, I personally like the very, very long leads you get for training puppies. They're anything up to 15 metres long and are great for obedience training :)<br>  <br>  I think the reason for Roxy's sudden chance in behaviour could be that she is that excited and overwhelmed by another dog for her to play with, that all knowledge of training just flies out the window when she can much about with Sophie - This, of course is nothing to do with poor training, it would be the same with children, if they're at the over-excited 'toddler' stage of their development (which at 6 months, they are) nothing is going to stop them enjoying themselves.<br>  When they're used to each other, they will hopefully calm down quite alot, or atleast be responsive to your calls!<br>  <br>  But for this to happen, the 2 dogs need to spend alot of time together, as well as time apart when necessary (i.e - nights, whenever you're not home, etc)<br>  Cages are often the easiest way to keep them apart, but if neither dog is used to being caged, this could be unfair to them to try to expect them to adapt to this method at this stage in their lives.<br>  When Sophie isn't in Roxy's sight, I would hopefully assume that Roxy would be her normal, well behaved self..<br>   I hate to say it, but I think you've let yourself in for one hell of a ride, but honestly, good luck and I hope you can give Sophie a good home alongside Roxy.<br>  Just build up Sophie's trust slowly, and she'll be a much better, more responsive dog. Don't make sudden movements around her (unless you're playing and she knows it) and don't make loud noises, use her name both positively and negatively when appropriate, and remember that the dog will pay more attention to the tone of your voice than your actual words. A low tone of voice for telling offs, and a high pitch, excited voice for praise.<br>  Also, if Roxy is much bigger than Sophie, be careful that Roxy doesn't get jealous or territorial and start to bully Sophie, as this will make your job 10 times harder!<br>  *I also meant to say in the first part of my answer that the reason for Sophie chasing the sheep is in her breed, there is very little anyone can do to even try and stop her, as it is instinct*<br>  <br>  Anyway, good luck :)|`|C4jNmT32aa	It sounds like the other pup has been through a rough life. My husky was the same way when I first brought her home, she would hind all the time, now she only hinds when she's potty'd in the house, or wat something she wasn't supposed to, like my book, or wife's shoes.<br>  <br>  Your sisters puppy sounds like she might have been beaten a lot when she was a very small pup, or another type of abuse.  Ether case, it will be difficult to train her to same way, you'll have to take more time into getting her to trust you before she'll get over the scaredness that she has.  She'll never completely get over it, but for the most part she'll get over it.  <br>  <br>  As for the biting, that her way of saying "stop that", try and let her smell you hands before playing with her, or smelling the toy first before getting her to play with it. She might slowly get over her fear of having your hands on her.  Have your sister do the same thing, and see if it's only with you that she's getting scared, if that's the case then it was most likely a man that beat her, which happen to be the case with my husky, a woman beat her before I got her from the shelter, since I can play with her, but my wife can't do the same things, she will bite her in fear if she does.|`|DEPIyd6Paa	I think that both dogs could do with individual time spent with yourself.<br>  <br>  Firstly, you are new to Sophie. There is no way that you're going to be able to step in and have the authority of a master immediately. No matter what. She is scared of you, she misses her home and she's probably had a tough time at the home with feeling neglected. She doesn't know what to DO with the attention you're giving her, it is not what she is used to.<br>  <br>  Do relaxing things with her, turn the tv on and drink a cup of tea. Lock her in the room with you and observe what she does. Encourage her to lie close to you and pet her where you can. Build up a trust.<br>  <br>  Pay equal attention to Roxy because she will feel jilted about Sophie's arrival. Know that with two females, there is the chance that a jealousy/bitchy scenario could develop. <br>  <br>  Know that obedience, good behaviour and peaceful interaction between themselves and you might be a balance that takes time to work out but once you're there, it will be very rewarding. <br>  <br>  Take your time, relax. Don't get so caught up on their obedience, that's something that can be worked on once you have built up trust.<br>  <br>  Don't worry about the biting. You have responded appropriately and this will merely be a passing phase to Sophie. However, in future situations know that she does have biting tendancies so you may want to keep her away from potentially harmful situations just in case.|`|dl1OOOT8aa	With a very submissive/"soft" dog, you don't need to give harsh corrections, which can actually do more than good. Overpushing a soft dog with "Alpha rolls" will make them bite you out of fear not dominance. Also I would never leave two 6 months old puppies alone together, no matter how "Well-behaved" they are. They need to be kept in two separate crates. <br>  <br>  With an extremely submissive dog, I would avoid making direct eye contact, as this can be seen as a correction. You don't even need to make a voice correction with these types of dogs, just eye contact will be considered a correction. Thus why she never looks at you. The more you punish her for her submissive behavior, the worse it's going to get. <br>  <br>  I've seen men are usually the ones who don't know how to correct a submissive dog. You are giving corrections that should be given to a normal dog, not a soft dog. Group obedience classes is an absolute no-no with this dog. Because honestly, training is not the issue it's a pack leadership problem, the dog doesn't trust you. <br>  <br>  Petting a submissive dog only encourages it. You need to be more aloof and avoid eye contact. Pet the dog under the chin. Positive training will also help a soft dog gain more confidence. Marker or clicker training is excellent.|`|gC4UEn3maa	try seperating them with gates and then give them a lil playtime for an hour or 2 each day...|`|AoSeHXeQaa	To me the new dog sounds very confused and frightened.  Maybe being in a house with two young children and no guidelines overhelmed her.<br>  <br>  I would not work with the two dogs at the same time.  I would work with them separately, until Sophie has a better grasp of what is expected of her. And I would crate Sophie when you cannot watch her, rather than give her the opportunity to teach your dog destructive behavior.  <br>  <br>  I would allow them to play together, but only under supervision, and in an area where they cannot get away (so you wont have to chase either of them down).<br>  <br>  I would not punish the fear biting at this point.  Once you have established trust, then you can discipline her. <br>   <br>  I am fostering a chihuahua (Sophie, too, coincidently :o)) who was a fear biter at first.  I dealt with that by ignoring it, while calmly insisting that she do whatever I asked her to do.  That worked beautifully with her.  Once she found out that I would neither hurt her nor back down, her whole attitude changed for the better.<br>  <br>  Now that she is comfortable with me, and no longer fearful, she occasionally threatens to bite out of dominance.  I discipline her for that.<br>  <br>  With a fearful dog, I think your best bet is to ignore her as much as possible, wait for her to calm down and come to you. Give her some time to settle in, without any expectations.  <br>  Once she is more comfortable with you, and you have her trust, then you can start training her.|`|b0AvMRqbaa	You need to give them lots of love and attention, so they trust you, that they know you won't hurt them. So they won't be anxious. Also keep them on leads so they learn they're not to run away. When you trust them to come back they can have more freedom. As with children they need boundaries. If they both get equal love and attention they will become friends. All good energy to you.

Don't waste your tank space on so called "algae eating fish" they don't really destroy algae,they only recycle it.<br>  As far as the Elephant Nose, being nocturnal he will be a constant bother to the other fish after lights out,and his special diet requirements will create tank cleanliness problems. They need live food like worms and small crustaceans. <br>   If you feel you need scavengers go with the shrimp and perhaps some of the large snails like Mystery or Apple.<br>  You stocking plan does leave room for more fish, consider increasing the school sizes and perhaps one more school, 6 or 7 (minimum) small Corydoras catfish, I think you will find their antics amusing. And if you are an incurable overfeeder they will work on the leftovers. <br>  As far as algae control goes,that's your job,and it can be handled by weekly 25% water changes accompanied by gravel vacuuming and filter sponge rinsing.|`|7KxQXHzOaa	ok tetras, frogs, and shrimp are all i know that will go good together|`|p20v99N2aa	Tinfoil barbs, Veil Angelfish , Plecostomous are also good.

faa23f4368704769d71cc29e72525163aa	Like all animals (including you), your horse has binaural hearing, meaning his ears can hear sound concurrently. His external ears, known as pinnae, act like satellite dishes to capture sound waves and funnel them to his inner ears. Because of the large, cuplike shape of his pinnae, especially when compared to your small, flat ones, very little sound spills out of them, so he can capture noises you might miss.<br>  <br>  Another reason your horse can detect sounds you can't is his ability to hear a wider range of high-frequency tones, such as the ultrasonic squeak of a bat. For a prey animal, which he is, this hearing acuity makes sense. In his natural environment (open plains), other animals, including predators, are the only things besides weather that generate noise. Predators generally don't vocalize when stalking prey, so your horse is hard-wired to listen for the sounds of stealth--the snap, crackle and pop of grass and twigs under, say, a mountain lion's paws. <br>  <br>  So horses hear differently than we do and are more sensitive to a wider range of noises but studies have shown horses to hear each other up tp 4400 meters away which is just under 3 MILES!

This is the ONLY place where you should get it, because they have to fit it to your parrot and they have to make sure that he can still eat and move around with it, WITHOUT being able to get to his feathers.<br>  <br>  Make another appointment with your avian vet for a collar fitting.

zqVDJxUIaa	Don't worry about it! It's normal behavior. The goldfish will not get tired. The only thing that you want to worry about is that the other fish may be nipping at it's fins. If they are simply following it, then don't worry; there's nothing wrong. However, if it's lying on the ground later, or has rapid gill movement, then you should be concerned. Check for signs of stress, and if the fish's fins are getting torn, then separate them. If the fins are fine, and the other fish are not harassing them, DON"T WORRY! After all, they're just playing! Fish like to have fun too!<br>  They can't get 'tired'. <br>  <br>  Also, I've been reading some of the other comments. Feed your fish AT MOST 2 times a day! Overfeeding will cause ammonia buildup (toxic) and can kill your fish. I only feed mine once per day! <br>  <br>  Good Luck!|`|dE5fs9yzaa	Sounds like spawning behavior. If you can, remove the males you don't want to spawn and leave the one male you do. Be on the lookout for small nodules, egg, and if the water suddenly become cloudy. This will be sperm.

YqlemuNRaa	Because they are of opposite sex, there shouldnt be any serious opposition between them. This is instinctual. However they still might squabble if they disagree about something. To help them become closer, take them on walks together. this not only gives them exercise, it gives them a sense of working together, and helps them bond. Also give them equal amounts of attention, so neither of them feel left out.|`|w0dxId5taa	As there is a gender difference between those two they won`t fight that much; but for the safer side at least for some couple of months you have to be very unbiased with those two. specially you have to take care of the older dog so he does not feel jealous
bDqfgObTaa	You need to gain his trust first. If you are in the same room, give him space, sit with your back to him, don't talk or give affection. Just let him experience you being there. This is very non-threatening, and low energy. After a while move a bit closer but keep your back to him. You don't necesarily have to have contact with him the first time. If he comes you then great. Gradually work your way closer until you can be in phsyical contact with him. You don't need to pet him just letting him see you are no threat. Eventually you should be able to put a leash on him and walk a bit. Walking will help him bond more with you. afterwards you can give some affection maybe food or water.|`|52bfba7833ff67fedabdba05216f5314aa	be patient and don't approach him. Wait for him to come to you.. And dog snacks works wonders for friendship..|`|QdQcAHqaaa	You need to create positive associations in this dog's mind.  For starters, do not stare at him or approach him head on.  By walking up him sideways, you are presenting yourself neutrally.  Do not pursue him, let him come to you.  You can try sitting in a room with a treat and letting him take the treat from you.  After a while, he will associate yummy treats with your scent.  The same thing happens if you feed the dog.  If you let your frustration towards his fear of you show, he will sense it and avoid you even more.|`|dtZ3tmoRaa	Try to give him a treat. Make sure to squat when you call him and show him what is in your hand. If you stand over him he is more likely to run away as that is perceived as a dominant stance. You can even sit on the floor indian style and place the treat a little ways in front of you and let him come to it. Give it time he will get used to you.|`|S8Tzx44paa	Get a dog treat and lure the dog to you. It'll probably snatch the treat away from you and then run away, dog treat and all. But if you do the same thing everyday, the dog will eventually realize you won't hurt it, and it probably won't be afraid of you anymore.|`|XUjxpQluaa	try feeding him to build trust and move a little slower around him.<br>  It sound like he was abused as he was younger. Good luck!|`|RBcPCirJaa	Hmm, Was he abused in the past? If he was, He was probably abused from boys. So, Now, When he sees boys, He gets afraid.|`|qN92yLzMaa	I agree with the dog snack idea, but the dog's behavior speaks of something deeper.<br>  <br>  First question - the step brother it adores, is he pretty young?  In comparison to the rest of the males in the house, is he physically smaller and is his voice still young and not deep?  <br>  <br>  If I had to guess - of course without knowing anything about this dog, I would think maybe he suffered abuse, possibly at the hands of a male.  Best guess.<br>  <br>  My parents took in a cat that had issues with males too - she'd pee in my dad's & brother's shoes if they were left out.  Never had issues with the females tho'.  This was the theory they had with the cat - that she had been abused by a male.<br>  <br>  Never come on strong with the dog, don't raise your voice.  You'll have to be patient & let him come to you on his own terms.  <br>  <br>  And never beat/spank this dog.<br>  <br>  Good luck.|`|ady8Nqivaa	It is likely something that happened to him before you Dad got him and for whatever reason, you guys remind him of it.  The only thing to do is be patient and nice to him, try approaching him on you hand ans knees so you are at his level and less imtimidating and smile, dogs understand friendlyness

RA3p25Qoaa	Sometimes when a crab comes up from moult the other crabs pick on him. Try giving him a bath to refresh him and get any strange smells of him. <br>  <br>  make sure they have lots of shells around and they're clean. the shell thieves tend to come out after a moult.<br>  <br>  As for the leg sometimes a crab has slight defects after a moult or they loose a leg and do a double moult and the leg doesn't grow out properly. The leg should be back to normal next moult. I wouldn't worry too much about it. <br>  <br>  Try adding some shell fish or more meaty or fishy foods to the tank it sometimes helps cut down on fights and keeps all crabs happy.|`|JQbEE1plaa	Maybe poor moops needs a new shell to move into that's large enough so that  he can hide inside it. You have to keep a selection of empty shells of various sizes for them when they want to move into a bigger one.|`|C0KU33Hoaa	Maybe it's a dominance thing!  Try getting Moops a little cage of his own.  My old hermit crabs enjoyed climbing up to the air slits in the top and hanging there for hours!  Just move him and then, after a couple of days put him back with the others and watch him carefully!
Nhje1U06aa	okay - I agree wild animals should be kept in zoo's , the wild , or a sanctuary. However i do not think the owner should be charged. Its the states fault for allowing her to keep the chimp in a residential neighborhood. i think she has suffered enough. <br>  I do feel compassion for the woman that was mutilated . however punishing her friend will not make her better. <br>  The whole thing is just a mess!! I hope each state tightens there laws for keeping wild animals!|`|rQlzfHqraa	It is proof that no matter how long you have a wild animal or how friendly they are, there is still a wild animal within and something could set it off against you.|`|fbd64694a498c73d8b0c3ca90c37602aaa	If you're going to rant, then at least get the language up to a competent level of fluency.  But yes, you are right.  Exotic animals should only be kept by people who are qualified and licensed to handle them.  There are factors that we will never know and its a shame the animal was killed.  Its also a shame that the women was injured, but when you play with wildlife, there are consequences to be accepted.|`|9IjZ386Daa	Uh damn. I think that's horrible. Whatever that lady did, she is a very incompetent person.|`|yBTGXdFwaa	Get your story straight, a lot of things you wrote about this story are untrue.  moron.|`|GVR9AjoQaa	The chimp could probably spell & puncuate better than you!
fypgDK53aa	He probably drank too fast and too much after his exercise. Let him rest for a little, and allow him a small amount of water to start. <br>  <br>  That being said - watch carefully if he is a deep chested breed like great dane, doberman, or sheperd.. they are predisposed to bloat, which can sometimes come on after strenous exercise. Watch to see if his abdomen is swelling at all, if he seems to be drooling excessively, or acting like he can't get comfortable. Bloat is a veterinary emergency. <br>  <br>  Chances are though, your dog is fine - this would be the same as you would be if you downed a whole bunch of water after strenuous exercise. As long as he cools down, rests, and is able to take small volumes of water in the next few hours, he'll be fine. In a half hour or so, offer him a little room temperature water (not cold) to see if he can drink and keep that down.<br>  <br>  If you note any of the symptoms I mentioned above, or if the vomiting continues, you may need to go to the vet. Bets are, he'll be perfectly fine.|`|UETAqR8Taa	he should be okay.

Give her a few days and she should be much better. It helps some puppies to have a warm thing to snuggle with ( dried peas or beans in a sock in the microwave for a few minutes works, but check for  excessive heat before you give it to the puppy), and a ticking clock helps sometimes, too.|`|OtKCAeQZaa	It really depends on the dog, and how old cuz yours is really young i dont think it would take that long. I got a dog from the animal shelter and she was 8 month and it took her almost 2 months to get relaxed and comfortable with us, but it may just be because she was abused before. :( Give your puppy time, and for the time being all you need to do is love him/her.

nUW4oioxaa	The way I see it is that you have to options.<br>  <br>  Easy - Get rid of the problem dog<br>  <br>  Hard - Spend time with your sisters dog and get back to basics with the training. You will have to leave the other dog at home though while you do.|`|A21SswSfaa	Imagine getting in trouble for something. You've done something wrong and you don't know why it's wrong. You're commanded to come over and you try to show submission. When that doesn't work you might bite some to let that person know not to mess with you. Then you're pinned on your back!<br>  <br>  It sounds like Sophie is used to being punished. She has low confidence. Instead of punishing her for bad things she does, praise her for good things she does. Train her daily. That will bring up her confidence in you and herself.<br>  <br>  Both the dogs could be a little stressed by this new situation. Don't leave them alone together. Crate one, or both, while you're gone. Give Roxie the food and attention first: she was there first. Chances are they need more time to adjust. But Roxie is also excited. She's well-trained when there's no distractions but you add a distraction and all the training goes out the window. She needs more training. Try working on commands with Sophie right there. Use treats to get her attention. <br>  <br>  Also, since they both have so much energy, walk them. Every day. Both the dogs need more time to adjust, training, and a huge confidence booster.|`|KOtMicRKaa	I would let sophie be scared and teach her to act like roxy then there will b no prblem but if thats not possible if you want things to b normal then someone else will have to take sophie.

By the way did she act the same where she used to live? i just think sophie is untrained and is not sure about things. hope i helped alittle|`|XxU94aKlaa	It sounds like Sophie has some bad submissive issues, though the fear biting is what would worry me the most.<br>  I personally advice you hire a professional behaviorist (ask the vet for recommendations) as this sounds fairly severe and I don't believe most normal homes have the ability to deal with something like this on their own.<br>  She's going to take a lot of work, but without that she would be far too much of a liability in all honesty.<br>  <br>  Add:<br>  "However, once I turn her over to show her that I'm the boss and am not going to hurt her (as she is in a very vulnerable situation on her back)..."<br>  No, no, no, no. I can not stress this enough NO!<br>  You're making things worse doing this. I don't care that some idiot on TV did it, this is an out of date technique based on out of date information proven not to work.<br>  Wolves NEVER do it, dogs only do it before a kill, and it emotionally messes with your dog to forcefully flip them.<br>  <br>  You're suppose to be helping her confidence, not making her think you might kill her. No wonder she's doing all this....<br>  <br>  Go hire a REAL behaviorist else your going to get this dog beyond fixable.|`|01AdxToLaa	WELL IT SOUNDS AS THOUGH SOPHIE HASN'T HAD MUCH STRUCTURE AND SHE NEEDS TO BE TRAINED BUT ALSO SOCIALIZED. MY DOG IS A LITTLE OVER A YEAR AND STILL IS FEARFUL AND TIMID BUT I HAVE BEEN WORKING WITH HER AND SHE IS GETTING MUCH BETTER. IT SOUNDS LIKE YOU HAVE A LONG ROAD AHEAD OF YOU ITS NOT IMPOSSIBLE BUT IT WILL BE CHALLENGING. GOOD LUCK|`|6c44f892b5d2aa60a25c4efc0d98082faa	You've got a lot of issues there, but I'd start by crate training.  Often people think that putting a dog in a crate is mean, but in reality it makes a dog feel more safe and secure (think a wolf in its den).  You always feed it in its crate.  You leave its water bowl in its open crate.  And you put it in the crate whenever you're out or too busy to supervise.  Sounds to me like getting two crates would really solve a lot of problems.<br>  <br>  If she's submissive, it sounds like Sophie's fear biting, not aggression/dominance biting.  So making the dog belly up may not solve the problem.  I think walking the dog may help with some of the weird behaviors.  Teach the dog to walk properly at a heel, with daily 10 minute training sessions, so that she will properly submit without the cringing, crawling stuff.  <br>  <br>  It also sounds like she's a dog that may respond better to positive feedback (tiny treats when she's doing well) and may not respond well to negative feedback.  I would put her on a pretty strict, regular training regimen to keep her busy, tire her our, and help her understand her place in your pack.  <br>  <br>  Sounds to me like both dogs would benefit from crates, regular walks at "heel", and some serious obedience training.|`|7Rp256IOaa	You've got a lot going on here.  Roxy's sister has just had her life turned upside down.  She doesn't know you yet or why she is in a new situation.  Her submissiveness and fearfulness could be the change in environment as other factors.  I am not sure how your sister was handling her but she could have been too harsh with her too.  As far as the biting is concerned, once she bit, its too late to impose any "punishment".  As a matter of fact I wouldn't force any dog on its back.  You are at greater risk of getting bit again.  She is telling you to back off, you just didn't heed the other warning signs like a stiff body, looking away, ears back and such.  You need to give her a chance to settle in.  Work with her on a one on one basis, put Roxy away for these sessions.  Find out what makes this dog tick like you acting goofy.  Make it a game when asking for sit or down or whatever.  Try treats, a ball, a game of tug, whatever turns this dog on and make it fun!  Watch your own body language.  Are you standing tall, leaning over her, staring into her eyes?  If she is that stiff and cowering she is speaking volumes to you that she thinks she needs to appease you.  Watch for these signs and back off.  <br>  I wouldn't recommend keeping any dog outside unattended.  Its just begging for problems.  Have you thought about crate training?  This can be a very safe area for both dogs to be while you are not there to supervise.  <br>  As far as the play goes, that's just puppiness. Enjoy!  When they get too rough in the house, proclaim excitedly "Let's go outside and play!".  Then sit and enjoy their antics as they romp together.  Your puppy is naturally not going to listen as well to you at this stage while she has a playmate to keep her attention.  As the other one settles in and learns basics, the two will listen better.  You can then start working the two of them together in fun structured play where you start incorporating some implulse controll for both of them.  You will get there, it just takes time.  If you need help, seek the advise of a professional positive trainer.|`|GKk9rWqkaa	Have you heard of Jan Fennell?  She is a fantastic person who studied wolves to understand dog language.  She has written several books and I recently went to one of her lectures where she made me understand how my dog [a Yorkshire Terrier] was thinking she was the leader of the pack which was why she was so stressed all the time.   I followed her guidelines and my dog is no longer a problem.   I could write pages of advice but I suggest it would help you if you could get hold of a copy of one of her books where you will find all the answers.  If you key JAN FENNELL into a search engine it will take you to her home page where you could find how to buy a copy.   If you are in the UK, it may be that your local library might have copies to borrow.   I hope this helps a little.   Good luck.<br>  Beryl|`|Yr1nToGzaa	it sounds like your new dog(the bad one) is upset, unconfident, afraid, and unsure in her new home. it'l probably take her a while to get used to everything. she may be pining for her last owner who gave her away. Roxy is probably trying to make Sophie feel more at home and is excited to have a friend. keep both of your dogs and refrain from locking them outside, unless together so they can play. make sure they don't annoy the neighbours too much with their barking. you could try taking them to obidence classes. just try and make sophie feel more at home by giving her a little extra loveeeeee! :)|`|bbpDgLonaa	Well.. I would leave the dogs outside in a kennel with a bed and food and water when you are gone (separate if need be), and eventually they will learn that that is their home and they won't pee in it, and as for the behavior, reward good things with treats( pieces of dog food) and when they do something bad send them to the kennel for about an hour, and of course exercise them at a park or just a walk.|`|342b3711423c978836fa192cef3238d8aa	Are these two herding dogs?  <br>  <br>  OK, your heart's in the right place, taking on Sophie and giving her a home.  It sounds like she was never socialized at all and certainly not trained either.  She's being submissive, definitely and you never, ever go all alpha on a submissive dog and turn them on their back.  You're only making her much worse.  <br>  <br>  She needs her confidence built up, not torn down.  Besides which she's a 6 month old puppy who's had no training and clearly doesn't know right from wrong, so how can she make a mistake?  You need to get her into obedience classes for socializing and to have a qualified instructor teach you how to train your dogs.  Dogs also gain confidence from success.  This puppy needs lots and lots of positive reinforcement for every single thing she learns.<br>  <br>  There's also a great book by Patricia McConnell called "The Cautious Canine" that would help you help her.  It's very short but packed with info.<br>  <br>  Until Sophie gets older and more trust-worthy, perhaps you could crate train her for those times you can't watch her so she can't wreck anything.  You made a commitment to her when you took her, it would be a shame to dump her now.  She can be helped, don't give up on her!|`|Pi8KfmOxaa	you have to give it time, sounds like your original dog is just excited to have a playmate and you have to get the trust of the new dog she sounds frightened.
AA10455526	Unless you already have a problem chance are slim,  you didn't say which macaw you have but l have not had a problem with any plucking from my 2yr old military or my 4 yr old blue and gold with change long as they have plenty of toys to destroy and bells to ring and play with they are quite content and l also rotate my toys often but their may be a problem if you change locations for sure unless it is a place that is more appealing to you bird.|`|xJMhQAhfaa	If you're concerned, place both cages next to each other, where she can see and get used to the cage with new toys. <br>  After a few days add her favorite treats to the new cage and let her play (by opening both cages and letting her go in, if she is allowed to climb around her cage) in the cage a little each day for a few days increasing the time spent in the new cage, then convert her to it. You can leave the old cage for a few more days then remove it.<br>  I think if you spend good quality time interacting with your macaw every day and she is a well adjusted bird, you can convert her to a new cage with little fear of feather picking.<br>  Feather picking is usually found in birds with health, dietary or behavior issues. If your good on those three things, I'm betting she'll be just fine.<br>  I would also consider discussing the matter with your avian vet. I don't necessarily mean making an appt., just call and get his/her advise.<br>  Good luck.|`|F5vsY4rOaa	Does she spend a lot of time in the cage or on it or does she have a pole perch? If she spends more time on perch she might not care at all if you change as long as her usual toys are put inside If she is a cage sitter you have to use the slow approach so as not to upset.<br>  First set up the new cage where she can see it leave it open and of course act all excited when telling her all about her new home.<br>  Every day encourage her to go to the new cage a new bright toy should be added to attract her then each day take one of her toys and with her help place it in new cage. A really fixated bird may take a week to be willing to stay in cage so do not rush her even if it means you are climbing over other furniture in a stuffed room. If she does not protest you closing her in new cage even with her old one nearby she should be ready so take the other one out. Oh and make sure you put her favorite treats in the new cage when you set it up, my son claims his rainbow will do anything for peanuts so when he was training him to get in a carry cage ( they travel a lot) he put a few peanuts inside after a few in and outs he was willing to have the door closed now we just tell him time to go bye bye and he goes to the carrier on his own. so go slow use treats and be sure to act excited after all she is getting a whole new house and it should be an exciting and fun move.<br>  The only time I have heard of parrots plucking from a move was from the people showing no concern for the bird and just shoving them in, that can cause problems even for a new bird. Most of our birds take moving very well as long as their toys and treats go along and you explain what is happening they have no problem with a bright new cage.

cY8DgJv5aa	Rather than just size, you need to start researching which distinct breed you want for your exact lifestyle. Will you have time to offer a high energy dog lots of exercise and mental stimulation or do you need a more laid back breed? Do you have children? If so, what are their ages? Different breeds make better pets for different aged children. What about grooming requirements? Do you like long hair or short hair? Do you prefer a dog that needs lots of grooming or very little grooming? These are things you have to figure out on your own by doing your own research. If all you want is a medium-sized dog, then just go down to your local shelter and take your pick. There are literally hundreds of dogs brought in over the course of a month that meet that simple criteria.|`|P2yRAWiJaa	Make sure it's an actual breed and not a mixed breed mutt being sold for an outrageous price by a byb...go to a shelter if you want a mix. :)<br>  <br>  Anywho...I'd say a boston terrier, bulldog, minpin, spaniel (most any kind), corgi, shar-pei, spitz, papillon, whippet, greyhound, pug, portugese water dog, shipperke, shih tzu, maltese, silky terrier, yorkshire terrier, pomeranian, chihuahua, bichon frise.<br>  <br>  Yes, I included some smaller breeds in there as well.  I tried to include breeds that are easy to maintain, don't require a whole lot of exercise, and are generally happy being lap dogs (or lazier than a working/herding breed that HAS to have a lot of exercise).  The greyhound and portugese water dog are bigger and will need a bit more exercise but are still good for inside.  I could add the Lab or Golden Retriever but they are larger breeds that require more exercise and generally need a yard or at least a field to run around in.|`|Ff7mCzlPaa	It doesn't matter what type of dog you get, they all need daily exercise.  So, letting a dog out on a chain or lead in the yard, isn't exercise.  They need walked and some need to run. <br>  <br>  It would depend upon the amount of time you intend to spend on the dog's exercise program.  <br>  <br>  My best advice is to look up the breed types you are considering on the internet, and taking it from there.|`|4KF4v3Dcaa	maltese poodle! sorry i love thoseeee|`|abf5d4fe2f9bae29c0d64b30a39b985faa	I found a cockroach in my apartment yesterday that was the size of a small dog you could have it.

The rest of the worm is still inside your puppy, and yes, puppies can die if they have an overload of worms inside them.<br>  You need a special de-wormer for tapeworms, not the same as for other worms. But they do sell it over the counter. One that I know of is called D-worm.<br>  However, since your pup has had no shots you might as well have the vet do it. He need at least the rabies shot by law. Get him neutered too. Call your local spca and they will give you a list of low-cost spay & neuter clinics. They will also be able to give shots and de-worm at the clinic.|`|B1OUPWxXaa	He will not die. Take him to the vet. The vet will give you a de-wormer. He needs his shots, get them as well.

Dogs need to have their vaccinations on a regular basis -  usually once a year.<br>  <br>  It does sound like he has worms.  If he does, only the vet will know what kind of worm it is and how to treat it.  If you can capture one, put it in a jar with a tight lid and keep it in the refrigerator until you can take it and your dog to the vet.  He won't die from worms unless he's had them for so long they've eaten into his stomach or intestines.  <br>  <br>  Be sure to ask the vet what to do about flea and tick protection.

Roundworms can grow up to 15 cm long and are white in colour. As their name suggests they are round (like string),<br>  whereas tapeworms are flat (like ribbons). Tapeworms can grow up to 60 cm long. Both roundworms and tapeworms live in the dog's intestines along with two other types of smaller worm (similar to roundworms) called whipworms and hookworms. However, these rarely affect dogs in the UK. <br>  <br>  In some countries there are parasitic worms that can live in the dog's lungs, heart, stomach or bladder but these are rarely seen in Europe. (Don't know where you live?)<br>  <br>  Intestinal worms help themselves to your dog's food and can damage the gut causing loss of blood. Worms can also cause diarrhoea, dehydration and anaemia, and this may make your dog run-down and<br>  susceptible to other diseases. If there are a lot of worms your dog may cough, lose weight, have a rough, dry coat or a 'pot-bellied' appearance. In puppies a worm infection can be more serious, causing poor growth and sometimes even death. If there are large numbers of worms the intestine can become blocked (although this is rare in an adult dog) and this may be fatal.<br>  <br>  I hate to state the obvious, but you should have been financially able to take on a puppy before you went ahead and got it!<br>  <br>  I hope he is ok :(|`|TtFBNxOOaa	1st<br>  CALM DOWN!!!!<br>  2nd<br>  listen carefully<br>  u must first think if it was really a worm or larva. doesn't matter you're going to the vet<br>  3rd<br>  Y ISNT HE VACCINATED!!!!!!<br>  4th<br>  i think the do the but thing when they're ' itchy'<br>  5th<br>  RELAX HE'LL BE FINE!!!|`|zDXDHQI0aa	You need to take him to the vet. he is the one who will most likely know what to do.

5e5c65a2cd3552e7b1ff218d6c990e26aa	I don't think you're dealing with an egg issue.  An egg forms and then the hen lays it and that entire process doesn't take longer than 48 hours.  A bird would not be "pregnant" with an egg for two weeks.  Egg binding is a medical emergency and again, if your bird were egg bound, it would be dead long before two weeks were up.  If you are very attached to your budgie you might take it in and have it checked, but a realize a vet bill will cost the equivalent of about 3 budgies.|`|F5vsY4rOaa	she might be egg bound from drying out first take her out and gently feel her bottom while you have her out ask someone else to be on hand to check her box.

If there is a hard swell hold a warm damp rag on her bottom to moisten her vent or hold over a bowl of steamy water if after 2 treatments 6-8 hrs apart you best take her to the vet or your breeder so they can free the egg before she becomes septic. be firm but gentle and remember when she yells in protest that you are helping her

7uznrLBXaa	It depends on your lifestyle and living arrangements.  Not all small breeds have the same exercise requirements.  Remember that some larger breeds are inactive and don't need much space, too.<br>  <br>  Min pins are very popular these days, but they are *extremely* yappy and anxious little things - they were bred at watchdogs, so you shouldn't assume that you can simply train the yappiness out of them!  I have one and love her, but I *strongly* discourage anyone in an apartment from getting a min pin.  <br>  <br>  Personally, I'd probably go with a pug if I were you.  Such happy looking things!  Italian greyhounds are another option.  Breeds like beagles and terries come with some special needs, so be sure you understand the breed before purchasing/adopting. <br>  <br>  Don't forget your local rescues and shelters.|`|UETAqR8Taa	pappillon - gorgeous :)|`|t9Fxx75uaa	A small beagle or beagle mix.

iiNAJfGCaa	A $5,000 horse is very expensive for a first time horse, especially with someone on a limited income who is still in high school! I hate to play the devil's advocate, but what happens when you graduate in two years? Is the horse coming with you? What if you find a college in the city with no boarding barns? What happens if you get the horse home and she has a freak accident in the pasture? It happened to my horse... he was at his new barn for two days, got kicked in the eye, and cost me $2,500. What happens if you lose your job? Are your parents willing to support you financially? Are you willing to put this horse in front of saving for your college career? From your calculations you will need to earn at LEAST another $310 a month. And that's if everything goes according to plan and no surprise expenses spring up. What about tack? Riding attire? Blankets? Halters? Boots? Summer shots? Horse show entry fees if you plan on showing? Trailering fees? Farrier? Teeth? I know its not what you want to hear, but it really is better to wait, or lease a horse for now, or at the very least find one that is less expensive.|`|RUzBDX6Jaa	Oh that's tough...<br>  I think you could get a second job..?<br>  I don't know- I know you can do it.

Have you factored in vet and farrier costs?? With all that your also going to need an emergency fund in case your horse gets sick or hurts themselves. I know its easy to fall in love with a horse, but maybe you should just lease or take lessons until you have the financial needs to both support you and your horse.|`|2vSxgAkDaa	earn extra money on extra jobs and look for a 3rd job that pays more than the first job and quit the first job or second job and replace it for more money|`|4XZx0fMbaa	i want a horse really badly too! what im doing to save up is im working at my neighbours lots and i work all day at my local stable on a saturday.<br>  hope i helped!|`|hLYdCu8Jaa	first and foremost, you may need to look for cheaper board for you to save more money, this may involve you offending your instructor, but if you really want this horse than sacrifices will need to be made. secondly, you need to assess your reason for buying the horse,eg: shes pretty, she does this, she can do that, etc. if you really want a horse first you need to decide what you want to achieve with her? then make you decision based on that. owing a horse for the first time is VERY exciting, but you need to look at all of the scenarios so you don't end up with a bad investment, trust me i know from experience. hope i have enlightened you.

vVB6lP3baa	Get his distant relative- a Doberman.  I've owned an Australian shepherd, GSD, and a Rottie.  But after getting a dobe I am never going back (of course I still love those other dogs, but a Dobe is like the best of all their traits).  They get pretty big (mine is still filling out, but will be around 120-130 lbs), best guard dog (if you look at its breed history that is what it was made for), extremely intelligent and loyal (top of the list in these categories), very energetic and playful but calm indoors.  Also, they are one of the most affectionate breeds (many people say this, not just me) so not only will they not want to run away, they will follow you everywhere (to the bathroom included).  Plus they shed very little, don't usually bark or drool or smell or SNORE (my rottie snored a lot), and make an excellent playmate for a big rottie.  Youtube some videos of dobes and rotts for amusement.|`|MauSHQGRaa	Any dog around the same size as him would be good, just make sure he gets along with them before you bring a new dog in the house. Take him with you to meet the potential new addition on neutral ground and see how they interact. Rotties do have a tendency to play pretty rough with each other. I would also recommend a female and not another male. If you want breed specific, have you thought about a Doberman? If breed is not important to you, and it is only size, then find a dog that gets along well with your Rottie and you. Good luck|`|FoDimTxCaa	He would probably be better with a smaller dog as he won't feel a need to set dominance (which he will do even though he hasn't previously shown signs - it won't just be a dog he meets out on the park and runs around with, it will be another member of his pack!). You don't want a breed that tends to show agression as he will obviously be a big strong dog and it is unfair to expect him not to fight back if another dog squares up to him. Why not get him a little girl rotty to play with?|`|MLB9Z3qOaa	Mutts are always a best mixture of breeds beleive it or not. But any dog can be a good companion depending on how you raise them.

You can't assume a dog won't wander off if you don't have a fenced area.  Some breeds are more likely than others but any dog that sees another dog or animal is going to take off if unfenced and unsupervised.<br>  <br>  Be aware that very large and giant breeds (such as mastiffs, Great Danes, etc) don't make great running buddies.  Too hard on joints.  Smaller more athletic dogs are better for that.|`|FdcWPp48aa	A female Rottie would be best.

kWwgWSSgaa	Nothing if you use something like Quick Bath Wipes For Dogs. If my Dobes are muddy, I towel off the worst of the mud & then use a wipe.<br>  <br>  If on the other hand you were to give your dog a bath every day, it would strip the natural oil from the coat & make it prone to flake.<br>  <br>  If my female b*tch rolls in fox poop {which she does given the opportunity}, I just wash the fragrant area with Tea Tree Oil shampoo, which does an excellent job of combating the odour.|`|UmhWxs1laa	Clean dog?<br>  <br>  When we're showing, the dogs are bathed every day.  When the are not showing, we bathe every week.<br>  <br>  Remember, some breeds are seldom if ever washed -- chesapeake bay retrievers jump to mind.  Dirt just falls off them!  Hand stripped or harsh coats are seldom washed (terriers).<br>  <br>  Regular old dog -- wash all you want, and human shampoo (baby shampoo, conditioning shampoo) works just fine.  Nothing magic about dog shampoo.|`|P8Q39vA4aa	You will strip him of the natural oils in his coat. His coat will become brittle and will probably fall out. His skin will become so dry it will flake. Breed has nothing to do with it, this can happen to any dog.|`|inST4SlAaa	dogs have a natural oil in their fur that they need.  too much bathing would also cause skin problems|`|cJRFbZUaaa	Dogs don't need to be bathed every day.  It would probably dry their skin, because they don't have the same glands we humans have to secrete lubricants protecting the skin.|`|zEZF5ITMaa	They will develop very dry skin and it will not be healthy.<br>  <br>  Dogs aren't meant to be washed everyday.<br>  <br>  You could "spot clean" with a warm washcloth if they get into trouble.|`|7lCJWU52aa	They will loose their natrual oils that keep their coat shiny. and develop dry itchy skin.

You can't moisturize your dog like you can yourself. Dry skin = itchy skin = inflamed skin = infected skin = trip to the vet.|`|WWhYCAbSaa	The skin will dry out and/or the oil glands will go into overdrive.  Your dog should only be bathed about once a month or less.|`|GF3NjM7zaa	you will ruin its coat. a dog coat is covered in oil there glands produce to protect it, when u wash the dog the oils are striped away.|`|5f6fbccb8643408cbd62a8431b3e5c44aa	skin dryness and irritation will happen.|`|iVQULHqYaa	You will dry out their coats and cause dry skin if you use shampoo every day.

YuTFG3feaa	WOW!  Are you for real?  I have never heard of anything happening like that.  It's just one of those freak accidents you occasionally hear about.  I feel so bad for your friend.  Hopefully she will stop blaming herself and realize it was just an accident.  She can at least be grateful that he died instantly.  He could have suffered before he died or even survived only to be permanently brain damaged!  LOL<br>  <br>  Additional comment:  Just ignore the rude heartless jerks.  They have nothing better to do but criticize others to avoid addressing their own faults.  I wish your friend the best and pray things will start to get better for her soon!|`|WWhYCAbSaa	It was just an accident.  People throw balls all the time for their dogs, and none of those dogs die.

Things happen in life that are quirky and unpredictable you don't blame yourself for throwing a ball and the dog dies.|`|cJRFbZUaaa	Tell your friend that it's not likely that the dog died from hitting a tree.  He probably had some other issue like a heart attack and just happened to be chasing the ball and hit the tree at the time of death.
KAX0HCfTaa	I've had the same problems with bettas in the past but I figured out the solution....<br>  <br>  What you need in the tank is a heater.  You have to add the Anti- fungal medication as directed and turn the water temperature up gradually to 75- 79 degrees. Make sure you remove any kind of stones and or charcoal that removes nitrates.  These things neutralize the medication.  You should see results within 3 days.<br>  <br>  After his recovery you may want to get a 5 gallon tank that you can equip with a heater and water filter so you can reduce water changes and keep essential bacteria that your tank needs to thrive.  <br>  <br>  Another tip is to not keep your fish tank exposed to direct sun light.  It causes algae to grow in the tank which will cause other problems.<br>  <br>  Now I keep my bettas in a community tank with a bunch of tank mates and they've thrived for more than a year already occasionally I'll put a low dose of anti-fungal medicine and aquarium salt to keep any fungus growth to a minimal just for maintenance.<br>  <br>  Have fun fish keeping!|`|dE5fs9yzaa	The clear fins probably are new fin growth..the color will come back most of the time. Bettas breath air and don't usualy need a filter/airstone. But...to cut down on water changes and stress on the fish, one should have one. What they really need is warm water. Changing water every day stresses the fish. Really watch the amount of food given for awhile and see if that helps also.  If the spots are small and white, he could have ick now, which is sometimes brought on by a sudden drop in water temp. Changing the water every day could make that happen as the water temp could be different from what he was in. I hope he makes it.  Good luck.|`|ZgGe0bNZaa	ur changing the water to much only change once a week u will be romoving all good bateria from ur tank and ur wee fish mite be finding it hard to breathe keep treating him maybe add an air pump do u have fliter it would keep water clean for ur fish go back to pets store and ask for advice he may still get better it does take a while to treat good luck|`|wnnudNp5aa	If you have followed the full course of Betta Revive (never heard of it, myself), and he still seems sick, then I would use Coppersafe and Maracyn-two. Sounds like a fungus coming on. Putting him in a 16-oz. container isn't doing him any favors. He should be in at least a 2.5 gallon tank with a heater and filter. With a filter, you won't have to be doing constant water changes, which is also stressful to the fish.<br>  This is my best advice, good luck!
nFcl0BOsaa	Report that owner to Animal Control, and provide documentation to that agency of all of the injuries and vet bills. Furthermore, you can request reimbursement from your neighbor and if she won't pay up you can take her to Civil Court.<br>  <br>  You can see the limitations of electric fences. You don't have to keep a dog inside all day, you just have to go out with him and supervise. A CORGI is a herding dog and extremely intelligent, and need plenty of mental and physical exercise including a long, daily walk. Running around the same old yard day in and day out is no substitute for a walk.|`|5f6fbccb8643408cbd62a8431b3e5c44aa	Report the attacks to your vet and they will contact the humane society's animal control. <br>  <br>  Get a fence if you can. Tell your neighbor to contain their dog as well. Get a lawyer and sue them for the medical expenses and time loss you have had to deal with.|`|c7c42fcd2fd4b62ba49207bebbdb931daa	Have you called anyone after these attacks?  The police, the local humane society?  How is the dog getting to your dog, are there no fences up?  That's the first thing I would do is put one up if there isn't. I wouldn't go ahead and do the cayenne thing, because then the neighbour can start instigating problems for you. Plus it's not the dogs fault, it's the owners fault.  Definitely call people you need to call and see if she can be at least warned by someone if not charged with something.  Good luck!|`|WWhYCAbSaa	You should call animal control and have them get the dog.  If the dog is in your yard, lure him to a spot where the neighbors can't see, tie him up, and call animal control.<br>  <br>  Edit: If this neighbor is too lazy to neuter her dog, she's also too lazy to get it out of the pound.  Which would be better than her having it.|`|FaPrr8bbaa	Call animal control and ask them a lot of questions on what you should do.  Our local animal control came out to my neighbors and discussed the "why your dogs can't run free" concept with them.  The 4:30 AM howling (rabbit hunting) beagle has quit hunting since then.  <br>  I just hope your animal control is as helpful to you.|`|2Upd7ev6aa	If your dog regularly gets attacked by other mutts, and especially if you live in an area where many owners don't bother with leads, carry a fast-unfurling automatic umbrella with the catch undone. If you do get some creature flying at your pooch, you can fend them off (or with luck, frighten them away completely) by opening the brollie, without any harm being done. There will be nothing for the other owner to object to. My rescue greyhound had significant fear issues around other breeds, which made him a magnet for aggressive loose dogs, and this protected us many times.<br>  <br>  If you are walking your dog where it is safe for your dog to be off the lead, then let it be! Don't forget that in your dog's mind it is not on the lead, you are, and it will do all it can to protect you. Most dogs that stop to say "hi" to your dog are friendly but if you are on a lead then your dog will feel the need to protect you and a fight of some sort is bound to occur.<br>  <br>  And cayenne pepper spray would work
Avmo8d8Saa	i used to have a german shepard we realized that was to hyper so looked into it and i found a shih tzu we got him about a year ago<br>  he's the most gentlest dog ever the only time he barks is if there is someone at the door or if your playing rough with him..but he only got his full bark when he was about 11 months hes only 1 year and 5 months and its still not even that loud ..they do learn really quickly and for a plus they dont shed because there hypoallergenic<br>  i would recomend you this dog it seems like it would fit for your family since they are so calm and behaved..some people arent suited for hyper dogs just cause they cant handle it..its better if your gave it away to someone who could tolerate the behavior<br>  <br>  ----<br>  thats right so just find a relative who can temperarly foster the dog till you find a new owner|`|hPFQyH3zaa	You really may want to check the AKC dog site. Look a the toy dog breed group, they are almost always small. In the toy dog group they will usually tell you something about the breed. If one sounds good to you, you might be able to find someone with that breed of dog and ask them what they think about it, and describe it to you. You really need to be on the safe side and check it out if you can before you buy.

I would suggest King Charles Cavalier spaniel - they are fairly clam, laid back dog & cute.

People like you should not have dogs.|`|4170b6159b559adeeada7e5a240ebe71aa	I dont think any puppy is calm and quiet. They are almost all hyper because they are growing. It is your responsibility as an owner to train them. It has nothing to do with the breed ( at least as a puppy), rather in the training and effort you put into it. If your expecting it to be calm and quiet than your never going to find it. Get a book and read on training as oppose to giving your dog up as an irresponsible owner. I really hope you dont get another one, you deserve. Dogs are not disposable objects they are living creatures with feelings and emotions.|`|TXmAx8jwaa	Omg. whats the point yeah buying a dog and getting rid of him because his hyper? omg please don't get another dog if you cant handle proper responsibility's such as discipline and training. <br>  otherwise you may end up getting another dog and getting rid of it again.<br>  get a cat.<br>  Stuff your neighbors his your dog!!!

MstjbpVJaa	Moulting is the process whereby a bird renews it feathers ,the old one fall out too be replaced by new ones(this is all feathers)<br>  <br>  Make sure your bird has a good Diet ,a supply of fresh Green Vegetables and Fruit,not forgetting a Cuttle bone and Mineral block,these are all the essentials of a good tonic to help through this stress full period of a birds life.|`|96a318bea85eb2aa7d0b38b893875fb9aa	Moulting is the loss of fur or feathers. Your bird may have a disease.|`|b1256d852b56b556e6bb26806d1c64eaaa	Well, you answered the first part of your question already - molting is indeed the shedding of hair. You don't do anything, cos the bird is just losing its winter coat.|`|2Ku4DuvCaa	Molting is a completely normal process that happens with parrots when they lose their old feathers and grow in new ones. Signs of molting are:<br>  <br>  -Loss of feathers<br>  -Pin-like quills/feather casings on various parts of the parrot (I find they're most noticeable on the head.)<br>  -Increase in preening habits. <br>  <br>  Molting can be a little uncomfortable sometimes, so it's important that you provide your cockatoo with a good misting or let him take a bath every few days to help with the process. (He should receive a bath at least every other week anyway.) He might even let you help him with some of the more mature casings, but don't try unless he seems to let you. Even just offering an extra head scratch will be appreciated.<br>  <br>  However, if you notice that the feathers that are falling out are chewed and that your cockatoo has an increasing number of bare spots but not many quills coming in, then it's time for a vet visit. Your parrot might also be plucking out his feathers due to stress, boredom, or an illness. Only your avian vet can tell you.<br>  <br>  Please do your research on cockatoos so that you can be sure you're providing him with the best care that you are able to. Molting is something that you should have been aware of before acquiring the bird.|`|qeOlkRM0aa	This is natural. Feathers wear out in time, and need to be replaced.<br>  What you can do, is give your cockatoo a bath. Sometimes when new feathers come in, the bird will get itchy. Pin feathers, new feathers coming in encased in a sheath are stiff and scratchy, so a bath will soften them up. **IF** your bird will let you, GENTLY break the sheath on the pin feathers with your fingers, but be careful, they are sensitive.<br>  Other than that, this is perfectly normal, and will happen periodically.|`|cfblRvE3aa	If your bird is molting it is fine but look at the fethers that came off examin the pin parts edge it should be smooth if it looks like it was chewed on that is bad your bird may bee pluking its self wich could mean you will have a naked bird soon.if not give him showers it will help the sheding and make him look better.|`|I9YgbXe5aa	all birds do this. they are growing new feathers. it's very stressful for birds, and i sort of like their version of puberty. you can't do anything except make sure your bird is comfortable during the process to help ease stress. i believe cockatoos molt once a year|`|FhWOpW4waa	Molting is the process where birds and reptiles shed their feathers/scales to allow new growth to occur.|`|ivejg4whaa	It's normal, you just let it happen and then clean up the mess afterwards!

nFcl0BOsaa	Teach your children to walk slowly in the presence of the dog. When he does put his teeth on them, they should yelp "Ow!" in a high-pitched voice, immediately turn around and walk calmly away from the dog, go do something else, and everyone must ignore the dog for several minutes. Yelping will usually startle the dog long enough for the person to turn around and walk away. This training, known as "bite-inhibition", takes some time and patience. Do not drag the dog off or give him attention in any way for undesirable behavior. If necessary, until the dog learns appropriate social skills, structure the playtime with the children in such a way that they can wear their "outdoors clothing". <br>  <br>  Alternatively, you can teach your children to make the dog "sit".|`|FaPrr8bbaa	The world is his play and he is acting like the boss.  When a puppy is acting big and fierce in his litter the other puppy screams in pain and the mean puppy backs off. He takes notes on how ruff is too ruff. Thats my families understanding of it so we shreak at a ruff pup and he becomes gentle as can be. Sorry if you live in an apartment your neighbors might need to be warned.  We also walk toward a bossy pup and stomp a little to reinforce the I am bigger than puppy. But you still need to take on the leader roll even with these hints and you must teach your kids to be leaders, they must imitate the same boss Caesar Millan rules as you exhibit.  There is a lot to learn when raising kids and dogs together, good luck with your homework.|`|w4zjmhxoaa	I don't think he's being aggressive.  We have a puppy with our toddler.  He seems our son as more of a puppy, and tries to play with him how puppies play together.  When puppies play, they growl, chew on each other, tumble, etc.  I think he's just trying to play.  You've got to teach him to give kisses, instead of trying to chew.  Just be consistent, and keep close watch when he's with your children.  Separate them when you're not able to watch.  It'll get better, once he learns how to properly play with children!

Dont worry about him loosing his spirit or being sad because he is at the bottom of the pack. He will be a much happier dog having proper rules, boundaries and limitations. If your dog does something that gets a reaction from you he is the pack leader. Like letting you know he needs to go out to pee, and you let him out. He is the pack leader. <br>  Basically dont let your dog do anything without your say so. You call all the shots. Children often have an excited energy, and added with a puppies high excitable energy often creates problems like yours. Your dog is more than likely trying to out your children in their place. I suggest watching or reading about Cesar Milan, The Dog Whisperer, he is amazing and will be able to help you to understand why your dog does what he does. <br>  Good Luck with becoming your dogs pack leader.<br>  :-)|`|tDKzYuHBaa	He may be jealous of them, and trying to establish himself as top dog. You need to establish your 'pack'. You need to teach the dog that your children are more important than him. This website is a good place to start. <a href="http://www.canineconcepts.co.uk/ccp51/cc/dog-behaviour/packleader.shtml" rel="nofollow">http://www.canineconcepts.co.uk/ccp51/cc...</a>|`|UC9Wjjscaa	He is probably just playing. That is how pups play with litter mates.  He has to be taught that being so rough is not acceptable.  I currently have a 9 week of german shepherd and we are going through same thing.  We sometimes will yelp when he is too rough and this will startle him and he will quit.  This is what his litter mates will do if he were to hurt them playing.  I have also started using a water bottle to squirt him sometimes because he will go for pant legs when you are trying to walk. Really it is just going to take time, he is a baby and is learning what is acceptable. Good luck.  I would just make sure I was there to supervise the kids playing with him.|`|5BOV76bmaa	Children can be rough with animals so if they have been rough with it, it will just be reacting to that?|`|aCqSF87Raa	At eleven weeks old i doubt it's "aggression" - it's more than likely just play. Puppies play rough: they bite, they pull, they tumble, they mouth. And yes it can hurt. If you notice him playing too roughly, then it's time for a break.<br>  <br>  If your kids are old enough, teach them how to properly play with a dog. Don't let them wave their arms around, don't let them run around screaming, no kicking out, flailing, etc. And tell them that if the puppy bites, they need to stop what they are doing and walk away.<br>  <br>  The pup isn't the only one that needs to learn proper "manners." The kids should, at some point, learn how to behave around dogs as well. Anything you wouldn't want them doing to a strange dog should not be done to yours unless they are old enough to understand the difference (for example: my aunt let her two year old son sit on their dog when he was smaller - the dog is about 65 lbs - and he thought it was okay for ALL dogs and tried to sit on ours - which is 16 lbs... so i told her and she changed the rules to "no sitting on the dog.")|`|5f6fbccb8643408cbd62a8431b3e5c44aa	he needs obedience classes. it will fix a lot of behavior issues you may encounter later on too.|`|00P38FKraa	Maybe they were teasing him|`|9kTejB0uaa	At 11 weeks, I hope your puppy isn't being 'aggressive'.  Otherwise you have a problem.  Puppies communicate by nipping (and shouting).  In the litter they will play bite all the time.  However, obviously you have to let your puppy know nipping humans isn't such a great idea.  Children run around and make lots of noise, and this will gee your puppy up, he'll want to join in the fun.  This is good, but you have to be there to keep it from getting out of hand.  Your children have to learn not to be overly excited around him.  How old are your children because unfortunately if they are very young, they need 'training' to be around your puppy just as much as he does, with the greatest of respect!.   And I'm afraid it is for this very reason that I didn't sell my puppies to families with children under 8, unless the owners were very experienced - they'd had a dog before. <br>  <br>  I suggest you buy a crate, if you haven't already.  You need to establish puppy play times, when you can supervise, and puppy time-out periods, when things get too manic.  No shouting!  This will also only stimulate him.  He is still very much a baby and you now have an additional baby in your family.  And there is only so much he can take in at one time.  With my pup, when she gets over-excited, I take her face in my hands, and gently say 'No Biting!' looking right at her.  I reinforce this command by wagging a finger at her (you have to make sure he doesn't grab your finger).<br>  <br>  When he grabs at your children, replace what he's tugging at with one of his toys.  But do try the crate-time out option.

Mouthing and biting are natural, normal behaviors; all puppies do it. During teething (generally starting around four months), the urge to mouth is extra powerful because it feels good on your pups' tender gums. Lacking opposable thumbs, puppies also use their mouths to catch, carry, and play, making it all the more crucial that they learn how to control themselves in the presence of human skin.|`|K4xXxaJhaa	Puppy's are best with a routine, mine is now 6 months but when I first got her I had to get up at 6am every morning and let her out to go to the toilet.  She's now older and can hold her bladder until 8am.. however she needs out at this time.  You have to remember that they are like babies and are physically unable to hold it in if they really need.  Your puppy will get used to a routine and if he knows that every morning you will let him out at 6am he will hold it till then.  <br>  Every time he uses his teeth on you tell him in a firm voice "no" and give him a toy to bite instead...puppy's take a lot of time and hard work but learn very quickly!  Hope this helps a little and you don't get too tired waking up at half 6 !!  lol|`|OxFsslN8aa	Puppies lick and bite as a way of getting your attention.  It is completely normal.  Puppies will lose their teeth around 6 months of age and the biting will increase in intensity to relieve the pain and discomfort they feel inside their mouths.  Provide them with chew toys so they don't teeth on you.<br>  <br>  As for the potty training - yes you should set up a schedule.  Feed your pup twice a day about 8 - 12 hours apart.  A puppy will have to poop anywhere from immediately to 30 minutes after eating.  Bring him outside and stay out there with him to be sure he does what is expected.  Give a treat when he does pee or poop outside.  If he has an accident inside, do not punish him - it is up to you to make sure he can get outside; I assume he cannot open the door when he needs to go out.  At this age, let him outside every hour and a half and go out with him to watch him do his job.  Treat him for doing it outside.  If you stick to a schedule, both of you will know when he goes & where.
BWez86Ldaa	Hi there! I'm a proud momma to 9 rats and suggest that you do not go to a pet store for your new rat, for many reasons including horrible health. Are you an experienced owner? If not, go to WWW.GOOSEMOOSE.COM and find out some useful information about pet rats via their forum! :) We even have an adoption section there! In fact, I was browsing the adoption section yesterday and saw a few up for adoption in Canada, so you might be able to find a good rescue there in the UK.

Nco7uM0gaa	There are two different kinds of colic:<br>  #1: Horse colic which is caused by wet pasture and/or too much grain.<br>  <br>  #2: Sand colic which is caused by ingestion of sand.<br>  In either case the horse should be treated by a Vet.Sand colic is quite common in any area with a high concentration of sand.One of the most common cause of colic is the lack of enough fiber in their diet.<br>  <br>  Prevention: Do not feed your horse on the ground,especially in a dry,dusty or sandy area,and limit the amount of grain you feed it,and feed it bran.I fed my horses very little grain unless I was working them.If you feed your horse pellets make sure they are high in fiber.I raised and broke horses in California,and am no stranger to both types of colic.Bottom line,ask your Vet.|`|Nuh3T1cDaa	Bran mash is ok to give every once in awhile because it can cause some nutritional problems if fed too often.<br>  The basic reason to give it is to get fiber and water into the horse.  You can do that to better effect with beet pulp mash if your horse will eat it.  Of my 9 only 6 of them will touch beet pulp and only one really loves it.<br>  Lots of excersise and lots of good fresh clean water will do a great deal to keep colic at bay.<br>  I do feed a pelleted feed but I'm not a fan of it for horses that don't need it.  I feed only grass and a good grass/alfalfa or grass hay plus a ration balencer and that's the type of feeding program I recommend.|`|dpK16rvXaa	At five years of age, you are looking at colics caused by sand, impaction or parasites.  Make sure you use a feeder if your soil is sandy, actually feeders are good for parasite control also, keep feed clean.  Provide lots of good clean water, if you wouldn't drink out of the water tank, why should your horse?  Keep it scrubbed and the water fresh, this step alone prevents a lot of colic.   Worm on a regular schedule and keep manure picked up or at least piled in one spot.   Finally, this has helped me tremendously over the years, feed alfalfa hay.  You can add it to grass or feed it exclusively.  That is what I do.  The few times I have been forced to use only grass, I ended up with impaction colics.  Besides being the best value for nutrition, alfalfa keeps the bowels open and loose.  Just a lot better than walking a horse all night.  Hope this helped.

Don't go meddling with a pH unless you want dead Goldfish!<br>  <br>  When you got the new filter did you just plug everything in and move everything over? But throw out the old filter media?

I think the ammonia odor is a coincidence when it comes to the air stone bubbles.  I would say that it should have been cycled by now.  By cycled, one mostly means that there has been enough beneficial bacteria created (by the fish) in the tank for them to thrive healthily.  You can actually purchase beneficial bacteria at a pet store (or online if your local shop doesn't have).  This bacteria actually helps to breakdown harmful Nitrites and Ammonia present in fish waste and decomposed food.  Each time you do a water change, you should add the beneficial bacteria.  I would also recommend adding an ammonia removal product with each tank change (suggestion: Ammo Lock).  If you don't have any ammonia testing kits, you can use a very simple test to check for ammonia!  Feel the inside of the tank glass with a swipe of your finger.  If it feels slimey, that means there is a build up of ammonia.  You should do a water change immediately.  Water changes (exchange dirty water for new) should be done as often as neccessary, trying not to take out more than 25% of the water at a time, and trying not to take out water more often than once a week.  Each time you do your thorough gravel/tank cleaning, I would strongly recomend scrubbing all sides of the tank to eliminate that ammonia build up.  Be sure not to overfeed your fish - this is another major cause of too much ammonia in your water.  It's almost better to underfeed.  Only feed them as much food as they will consume in 2 minutes - twice a day maximum.  Keep your filter cartridges clean, and replace them with new at each complete tank cleaning.  At each "complete" tank cleaning you should still try not to take out more than 25% of the water.  This strips the water of more beneficial bacteria than is healthy for your little scaled friends.  If you have to take out more than 50% at a time - note for next time to do it more frequently.  Not related to your question, although a piece of information you might not know - Goldfish prefer their water to be cool (room temp, but no warmer) and they actually like their water slightly brackish!  You can even add non-iodized table salt.  One pinch per gallon is what I always found best.  They also love their water to be alkaline (non-acidic) and unfortuntately ammonia acidifies the water.  One way to inexpensively regulate the pH of your tank is to purchase seashells!  They will help maintain the pH at 9.0 or above, which the goldfish will love.  You can also add ordinary baking soda, but you will have to add enough to increase the water of your pH gradually (over days) to a pH of 7.5-8.0, and a test kit might be required.  <br>  <br>  Orandas are awesome!  I hope you have fun with them - and good luck.

There could be a lot of things wrong.|`|nQdGGBN4aa	As Amanda said, have a vet check her over to be sure there is no medical condition causing this vomiting.<br>  <br>  It is normal for cats to occasionally throw up fur balls - though they are actually shaped like a cylinder, not a ball - but to continually throw up food is not normal.<br>  <br>  A vet needs to examine your cat to determine if there is a medical condition causing her to throw up.<br>  <br>  There are a number of conditions which can cause vomiting, one being CRF (Chronic Renal Failure -- kidney failure).<br>  <br>  Have your vet check her out.<br>  <br>  Be aware that continued vomiting can cause dehydration and dehydration can cause serious problems.<br>  <br>  And if she is not getting any nutrition, that is, if she is really throwing up everything she is eating, she is headed for serious problems.<br>  <br>  Has she lost any weight? Weight loss is usually a sign of a medical problem.<br>  <br>  Get her to a vet.|`|IRaIxWJKaa	Ask your vet if you need to give her a 1/4 of a Pepcid tablet a day.  Ours is 18 and his stomach is sensitive and he'll barf his food if he doesn't get a Pepcid piece. It's made a huge difference.  The Pepcid brand is ok for cats, the generics usually aren't.  Talk to your vet about it.|`|0011Smdtaa	At a guess it could be because shes old... Take her to a vet, they may be able to prescribe something to make her less inclined to vomit or they may be able to suggest something more digestible to feed her.  Good luck and give your cat a hug !!!

j2albguDaa	$400/ week is rediculous.  look up pet sitters, vets can also board animals.  don't look around on the internet, you're probably going to only be able to find the more expensive ones there.  just open the phone book, look under pet boarding, and start calling.  i live in NC. , here's the prices we have at my work, under 30 lbs- $15 a day, med-$17, to have a large run for the dog is only $22 a day.|`|2O58btqxaa	hi there must be some cheaper than that my family own kennels and we charge ￡10 a day|`|oHKpy4IRaa	I pet sit for people.

TdrgZwnoaa	You mean the lures don't you? I have outdoor cats and they don't even try for the birds at the feeder. It's the bloody dog that keeps chasing the birds from the yard, not the cats. Our cats only take mice and birds on the ground. And there is no shortage of either out here in the country.<br>   In the Winter the cats cannot see the bird feeder from inside the house. The back wall has no windows that they can access. It's that stupid squirrel in the front yard that drives them to distraction and we don't feed him. They have been trying to catch him for two years now with no luck.|`|lTsDwY9Paa	I can't put out kitty torture devices. I own a Basenji / Mini Schnauzer mix, she'd probably break through a window to get to the birds. The kitties get enough bird & squirrel watching from those in the trees.|`|FQyeGsIyaa	No, I don't need to - my neighbor takes care of it for me.  They have a long line of bird feeders that my cat can see from a side window.  They also have 2 cats that watch from their place.

qgeI6Chxaa	For many working dogs the tails are cropped to prevent injury. Herding dogs, for example, are at risk of getting their tails caught in gates. Guard dogs are docked so that there's less for an intruder to grab. Many breeds have very brittle tails, so docking is a way to prevent injuries. Some people think docking is cruel, but it's a lot better than a traumatic injury and amputation. <br>  <br>  Ear cropping also serves a practical purpose. Cropped dogs are much better at locating the origin of sound, which is a huge advantage for hunting or guard dogs. Cropping also helps reduce ear infections by increasing airflow in the ear canal. Floppy ears are a result of selective breeding, but all wild animals have prick ears for good reasons.<br>  <br>  As for current practice, docking and cropping is illegal in Europe for reasons that have more to do with emotion than logic. I think actual working dogs can get an exemption, but it's a hassle. The US still allows these procedures and as far as I know there isn't really any significant interest in banning them. Docking is quite common, while cropping is more of a personal choice. Good breeders usually choose to have their dogs cropped if the standard calls for it, but most breeds can be shown with natural ears too.|`|Z9zzNYNCaa	My breed is docked to"provide a sturdy handle" for removal from vermin dens & I *USE* that handle.<br>  <br>  I have always docked (&dewed) & will continue to do so.

The breed is bred to be a companion protector and was specifically bred with out loose skin folds etc that would allow a human to grab hold of the dog easily.  Docking the tail and cropping the ears go along with that.   The erect ear is also better able to pinpoint sound than a floppy ear which is important in a protection breed.<br>  <br>  Many other traditionally docked breeds are gun dogs with naturally thin whip like tails that would be prone to injury in the brush if left with full tails, terriers that would be prone to breaking tails when going to ground especially when trying to back out of a hole,  and stock dogs bred to work with cattle who would be prone to having tails stepped on.   <br>  <br>  Many of the traditionally cropped breeds are breeds that were bred to hunt animals with tusk or horns  or act at catch dogs for wild boar and bulls.  Floppy ears would be prone to being torn by tusks and horns.

You never mentioned what breed you are working with, there are alot of different breeds that perform in reining, I really enjoy the QH/Arab cross for example.  I know everyone is giving you QH's to look at so I though I would mention that.|`|2AOzkBPJaa	As the previous poster mentioned, it's important that the horse is built correctly for reining.  Reining is a demanding discipline, and, like any other demanding discipline, if your horse doesn't have proper conformation for it, they may be unable to correctly perform the maneuvers, or have difficulties staying sound.  If you don't have any experience with reining I would recommend taking some reining specific lessons with an experienced coach.  It will be hard to teach your horse the quick spins and sliding stops unless you know how to ride them on a broke horse already, and understand the proper steps involved in teaching the horse to do them.  At the end of the day  some horses just don't have sliding stops and quick enough spins in them, it's hard to tell until you get there.  Maybe have your horse evaluated by a reining trainer or coach.<br>  As was already said the lope is the gait that the whole pattern is ridden at so definitely keep working on the basics until your horse is solid at all gaits, especially the lope, before beginning reining training.<br>  In my opinion, if your horse's gaits and transitions are not yet suitable for western pleasure, they aren't nearly ready for reining.  The horse would need to be broke enough for pleasure before it would be close to ready for reining, as in pleasure all that is required is a nice slow steady walk jog lope on the rail, reverse and back up.  Reining requires many different speeds of lope, collected, and extended, spins, sliding stops, back ups, as well as the ability to ride precise figures in the arena off the rail, much more advanced.  <br>  With a bit of natural talent on your horses part though, and a lot of hard work it's definitely achievable, talk to as many people in the reining world as you can, read, watch videos, take lessons, and practice practice practice!!! :D|`|PYqJtRQnaa	In reining the majority of the pattern is done at the lope so having that gait down is essential. Most patterns are a serious of slow collected lope to a fast move out lope. Then there are flying lead changes, sliding stops, spins, and backing. Most of the time the rides are done with a loose rein, and very little hand movement. They have to be well collected and have great balance. A good way to start some basics is to look into some Dressage basics. That can get you started in the collection part and properly moving forward. If she can do haunch turns the big part would be to start getting her to do multiple correctly and then speed them us slowly.  Sliding usually will come naturally but teaching them to do it takes a trainer so I would look into finding one in your area. Hope that helps. Good luck.|`|ThsyiJLEaa	A good hint at her hidden abilities is her bloodlines.  If you see Doc Bar, Doc o Lena, Peppy San Badger, Wimpy, Te(e) Jay, Gunsmoke or anything like that in her bloodlines, chances are she will have some talent.  Make sure she is in proportion e.g. not too long, not ewe necked, level sloped (her withers are not lower than her croup and vice verse).  Now, reining is my personal discipline and I will tell you it is HARD!!!!!  On average it takes a professional a couple of years to finish.  Reining is not full of the flash and glory that you see in the show pen.  To tell you the truth it can be down right boring.  The constant repetitive drills and exercises done to enhance performance and athletic ability go on for months before you even begin to teach the unique actions of spinning and sliding stops.  To break it down, your first couple of months will be strength and sensitivity exercises to make her physically fit enough to slide, change leads, spin, rollback and do other strenuous activity found in the reining patterns.  These execises will make her a very sensative neck reiner.  After that, there is the arduous task of teaching the spin and the other above mentioned maneuvers.  Also, she needs to be able to run a full speed in a circle and then be responsive enough to slow down to a "jiggy-lope."  That takes a very long time to acheive.  Thats the thing with reining, it takes a lot of time.  But, if that suits you, welcome! We are glad to have you!  We are always looking foward to people dedicated to our refined and awsome sport.  Also, for training tips there are too many to mention so I would say go to <www.nrha.com> and look at their "Inside Reining" series.  They have all of the top names like Dell Hendricks on them and they give you step by step methods for teaching all of the complicated maneuvers.  They're really great tools to have.  Hope this helped and again welcome!!  Maybe we'll be competing against each other...you never know ;)|`|px27V5N9aa	Register at THE HORSE (free, just email required)<br>  to see this in full<br>  <a href="http://www.thehorse.com/ViewArticle.aspx?ID=617" rel="nofollow">http://www.thehorse.com/ViewArticle.aspx...</a><br>  <br>  "The balanced horse, built with withers higher than croup, can stop with hindquarters collapsed and shoulders elevated. He needs a strong back and loin to stop correctly. Joe Stricklin, DVM, treats reining horses in his Abilene, Texas, practice. He compared the conformation of a reining horse to that of a cutter, because the reiner also must move quickly from the hindquarters: "You need a well-balanced horse, from front to back. You have to have a horse that has lots of hindquarter muscle mass. Look for a sloping hip."|`|3BMBZtDxaa	Okay, first off, is she a stock paint or more of the modern one? I would hope that she's the slimmer modern one because stock horses aren't doing very great in cutting/reining events anymore!<br>  <br>  Your horse should have sort of an attitude and a flare to her. Reining horses need to be much more haughty than WP horses! That's why you'll hardly ever see a WP horse also be a reining horse. She needs to have spunk to her and a hard drive, one where she would do almost anything for you. The horse needs heart which many horses lack now-a-days.<br>  <br>  As for conformation, she should have a shorter neck (but not stubbed), a regular head with erect ears and softer eyes, a shorter back with nice hindquarters, a good sloping shoulder, straight legs that line up, and an over-all proportionate body. <br>  <br>  Here are some good conformation reining horse pictures:<br>  He needs a smaller stomach and maybe a slightly longer neck.<br>  <a href="http://www.oasisquarterhorses.com/REMINICS%20APRIL%20STAR%20800.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://www.oasisquarterhorses.com/REMINI...</a> <br>  This is what a reiner's body should be similiar to<br>  <a href="http://s46.photobucket.com/albums/f127/SilverBuckleHorses/?action=view&current=HPIM0961.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://s46.photobucket.com/albums/f127/S...</a><br>  Great horse!<br>  <a href="http://equisearch.com/horses_care/health/anatomy/correct_conformation_clinic_800.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://equisearch.com/horses_care/health...</a><br>  A reining champion<br>  <a href="http://mckbqh.com/docoboots.JPG" rel="nofollow">http://mckbqh.com/docoboots.JPG</a><br>  <br>  Anyways, if your horse fits the conformation and personality, go for it! She should also be very quick and agilie and also listen well to you. Work on her lope a lot and flying lead changes, her spin, and definitely those sliding stops! Try and build good muscle on her and work definitely on the basics of reining.<br>  <br>  Good luck!

NAGiNKFWaa	Some people prefer the litter box method to pee pads as the puppy can't move around too much.  The bladder isn't grown until 6-months-old and they are not fully potty trained until 1-year-old. Take the puppy to the spot you want him to potty, use your commands, and praise him when he does good.  here are some tips, use what helps.  I use a crate* to potty train with, but only for potty training and then I break it down and store it.  I put blankets and a small food and water dish in the crate.  Dogs don't potty where they eat and sleep.  When they are first little, I only expect them to hold their potty for 4 hours, and then 6 hours, then 8 hours and so on.  So when they are first little, I set a timer or alarm clock to wake myself up at night to take them *out.  I only allow my puppy in the bedroom* or the living room, only one room at a time.  They have to graduate to more space.  If I allow them to have full run of the house, it will overwhelm them.  I take them out the same door each time.  I tie a dinner bell to the door handle.  Do not use a jingle bell as they could get their toe caught in it.  So when they are little, I ring the bell for them, and then open the door to go *outside to potty.  When they get bigger, I take their paw and whack the bell and open the door to go potty.  Eventually getting to the place where the puppy will ring the bell and let me know when they need to go potty.  Dogs want to please you, so it is your job to let them know what behaviors please you and what doesn't.  So when my puppy goes potty, I give her a treat*, and clap, and make a fuss and praise her.  So she learns that going potty outside makes me happy.  If she has an accident, make a disgust sound like “tsst” and take her out right away.  I never yell* or spank* my puppies.  Take them out when they first wake up, after they eat or drink, before nap, finish romping, when their activities change, or when they are sniffing around. Some puppies go pee right away, but may not go poop until 10 minutes later, so wait for the poop.  I have a little play time here, because sometimes I think they are done, and they are not.  Puppies train at their own pace.  While I may have a puppy that hasn't had an accident in several weeks, I don't let my guard down.  I don't expect my puppies to be "fully potty trained" until one-year-old.  If they have a setback, shake it off, and start over.  I only have my puppies in the crate when I am not watching them.  When I am sleeping, cooking, ironing, doing chores, basically when I am not watching her.  All other times, she is out of the crate practicing being a "big girl."  This is the time I train her how to behave in the house.  So we are practicing "no barking", 'no biting", "no jumping", and "don't eat the furniture."  I also have to practice "playing inside" so she doesn't knock over things.  You must keep the puppy in sight when they are little because they don’t know the difference between newspaper and carpet, and you don’t want them sneaking off and getting into trouble.   Some puppies can sleep through the night around 3-months-old, but their bladder is grown around 6-months-old.<br>   <br>  REVISIONS: <br>  *I use a CRATE to train with.  It is the method I prefer, compared to other methods I have tried.  I noticed that if they are in the crate, while I am doing chores, they are o.k., because the crate allows them to see me and be re-assured.  The crate can also be a comfort when stored in the basement for dogs who live in areas where thunderstorms and tornados are an issue. .  However, use the method that works best for you.....a laundry basket, a cardboard box, a woof-woof house, x-pen, child gates, whatever works for you.<br>  *OUTSIDE, pee pad, litter box, whichever method you are using.   When the puppy is first little, keep the pee pad, litter box near the food and water dish, so the puppy can eat and drink, and then go potty.  You can move it away as they get older.  The pee pad has a scent that smells and initiates potty.  Sometimes a pee pad makes a sound that scares some puppies, so you might want to use a litter box if that happens.  The pee pad allows a puppy to walk around, but a litter box keeps the puppy in one place. <br>  *BEDROOMS, I use the bedroom and living room for training, because it works for me.  Choose rooms that work for you, but watch for rooms that are damp, or drafty.  While my puppies sleep in the bedroom during training, once they are trained, I let them sleep where they want to.  They don't have to sleep in the bedroom forever.<br>  *TREATS.  While I use treats for training, you don't have to.  I like Charlee Bears for training (a little cracker for a little mouth,) I use them for training, but once they are trained, I cut back on them. <br>  *SOME PUPPIES will go potty in the same spot each time.  Some puppies have to be told to go potty.  A command like "go out" for pee, or "go finish" for poop, might work for you, keep saying “go finish” until the puppy poops.  This is a good thing to train if you travel with your dogs.  By using commands, the puppy won't get confused when you are visiting someone, on vacation with you, or when you get to a new home.  The command will tell them what you want them to do in an unfamiliar place.  You might also want to use a leash method, so the puppy doesn’t sneak off, or for strange places.<br>  *YELLING.  It is not a good idea to "yell" or "spank" your puppy and then take them outside when they have an accident.  They may get confused and think that going outside is punishment.  While you want to correct them, if you are extreme, they may not want to go outside again.  Shake it off, and resume your schedule.  You have to keep it real.  Puppies train at their own pace, but a puppy can only hold their potty for a few hours.  A guide would be 1 hour for each month of age, plus 1 hour, so a three-month-old puppy should only be expected to hold their potty for 4 hours at most.    <br>  SOURCE:  These tips, tricks, and ideas were contributed from many brilliant minds.  Thanks for your help!|`|oVwGit7qaa	In the beginning i would try starting to keep him in a cage all the time. I know it sounds mean but it works some. You can take him out and hold him, have him in your lap, or walk him. You should also feed her in the cage. (take all toys out while having her eat.) Make sure the cage is not too big because then he will have room to pee/poop in it. The cage should be big enough for him to stand up in and turn around. When you take him outside, and he pees or poops outside give her a treat/s and praise. Take him out about every half hour to an hour. Maybe even more often. After you think he has gotten used to peeing and pooping outside try putting him on the floor. he should not have the whole house to roam around in. You should close off most of the house with gates so he only has a small area compared to a big house. Continue taking him out every half hour to hour. If he pees on the floor make sure you clean it up with a pee cleaner that takes away the smell and the stain. If you don't he will keep going to that spot to pee. If you catch him while he is peeing, pick him up and take him outside fast. Hopefully he will get the message after a while. Do not punish your puppy or stick his face in the pee if he did it on the floor and you didn't see him do it. Try to watch for things he does before he pees (growls a lot, stares at you, barks at you etc.) If you notice these you may be able to take him out before he goes on the floor. You just have to be patient and keep rewarding her for going outside. Good Luck.|`|1itC64nVaa	You should go to petvideo.com !<br>  They have tons of videos on how to potty train, friend train etc. I wish I could attach a link but I'm not sure how.

280d96ad7b5e9ffad03a34a66cac5db0aa	Question 1 - <br>  I have never noticed such a stereotype. Ever. I don't believe it's generally true. A dog will be most protective of whomever it bonds with closest, regardless of gender.<br>  <br>  Question 2 -<br>  Yes, both German Shepherds and Rottweilers are prone to hip dysplasia. Most "big dogs" are. Although you can never guarantee that your dog won't develop hip dysplasia (just as you can't guarantee he'll never be hit by a car), you can definitely minimize the risk. You need to find a breeder who performs all of the necessary health tests like the PennHIP. The breeder should only use stock with good results on such tests, which means they're physically healthy. And if the dog has no hip dysplasia in his heritage, the chance of him developing it is drastically lessened.<br>  <br>  Question 3 -<br>  Both of them are highly loyal. Most dogs are. You can't really measure a breed's standard loyalty, and I haven't heard more about either breed's loyalty.<br>  <br>  Something to consider about Rottweilers: <a href="http://www.rottweiler.net/forums/general-info/57934-why-rottweiler-not-everyone.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.rottweiler.net/forums/general...</a><br>  Something to consider about German Shepherds: <a href="http://www.austingermanshepherdrescue.org/Adoption/adoption_before.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.austingermanshepherdrescue.or...</a>|`|CJMhtM7maa	The answer to your first question,I have not seen any difference in our Pits as far as being protective to either my wife or i.The hip problems you are referring to is common in both breeds,caused by in breeding and bad breeders.The only way way to avoid this is through a kennel<br>  (breeder) that has a pure bloodline and guaranties their dogs through x rays and genetic testing.Good Luck|`|oHKpy4IRaa	1) NO!!!!!!!!!Who told ou something like that?!?!<br>  <br>  2) There is no way to prevent those problems unles you get a german shepherd or rottweiler mix because mix breed dogs have less of a chance of getting these problems. German shepherds have those problems too<br>  <br>  3) I think either one is great. Most people would say german shepherds but I think both are very loyal.|`|AA10400143	They are both great breeds. I have had a Rott that i adopted from APL at 3 years! He was so sweet & great with my 3 yong kids. I have also had a red faced shepard & a husky/shepard crossed. They where also sweet & great with my kids. Both have the potential of having hip problems. Two of my three did (rott & r.f.s). I would recommend what one you get is, met the parents & make sure they have had hip checks.:)|`|Z9zzNYNCaa	1- NO!!!<br>  #2=BULLcrap & BULLcrap.<br>  <br>   &...it's spelled SHEP***HERD***!=HERDS SHEEP!|`|Zjq6vcAvaa	answer 1.male or female.dogs r protective of first the leader of the group(their owner) then the family.no gender troble for them.<br>  <br>  2.get a german sheppard cause rott can b difficult for first time owners.and illness come and go dont worry.<br>  <br>  3.although all breeds r loyal ,but some r more openly loyal and other r a bit shy.these both breeds r openly loyal n does noy shy to show u their love.goodluck|`|0yIhlO3vaa	In the end I really think it depends on the dog and who they see as part of the pack than it does gender. Although, in my experiences,  my females had a tendency to be more protective overall... Both Shepherds and Rottweilers are predisposed to hip dysplasia as they are considered large breeds...However, finding a reputable breeder who is willing to provide OFA/CERF etc..  documentation showing that the dog/or its parents have been certified clear of any genetic defects would greatly reduce the chances of acquiring a dog with such problems.. Both breeds require proper training and socialization because they both are known to become quite protective of their families and are often wary of strangers.. This comes from their roots seeing as they were originally breed as Shepherd dogs to help herd and protect livestock and have since been adopted into the law enforcement scene{because of those same traits}, now that their use as a Shepherd dog is no longer required... Quoting an above post:  "Feed a good quality dog food at or below 25% protein, preferably 24%. For the first two years of life.  Keep exercise light for the first two years of life too. Just puppy play and short walking. "   I agree: this too helps to reduce the risks of your dog developing joint and bone issues....|`|3KWodOgIaa	1.) Well practically there should not be a diff if a person is male or female 4a dog to like, no matter who is the master a dog will favor him/her against any other person regardless of their sex. This might vary a bit from individual to individual, maybe some dogs might favor more the opp. sex, but seems very unlikely n non practical.   <br>  2.) Both German Shp. N Rottweilers have their health issues, hip and elbow displacia is common equally in both of them. German Shepherds have more problems health wise than Rottweilers, because of years of too much inbreeding. These include ear infections, skin disorders, too much shedding, skeleton problems, odor etc. You cannot guarantee any two of these breeds against hip dysplacia as it has become a chronic problem in these breeds, every now n then in every 5th or 10th pup it shows up, the gene is recessive n present in the lines itself n lies dormant in most cases, but can show up n be active in infected dogs, even when chosen from parents who dont have this disease in many generations,  At the most you can do to avoid this is choose a pup from a very reputable breeder, whose dogs have been tested against HD & ED, that would increase ur chances of ending up with a normal pup without any health defects, but can never ever guarantee that. <br>  3.) Both breeds are equally good n loyal, although rottweilers are a bit more reserved n aloof type, the German Shepherd is more of a hyper n rowdy (in a loving attention seeking way) breed. <br>  My opinion in the end would be get a rott if u dont want to deal with chronic infection problems, hair shedding, odor issues etc. But then again both have their own negative n positive aspects, the decesion is totally urs at the end of the day.|`|VJQZZrkCaa	question 1:yes.my sister's little dog is very protective toward my sisters and i.he doesn't like men.not even my dad.same for girls.my big girl dog protects my dad,mom and me only.<br>  don't know why she only protects us.<br>  <br>  question 2:my girl dog is a german shepherd /rottweiler.rottweilers don't seem to like more than 1 person.they pick their fav and protect them against anyone who might try to hurt their owner.i am not so sure they tend to have hip problems.german shepherds don't have that.it really just depends on their genes.<br>  <br>  german shepherd are more loyal.like i said the rottweilers only like 1 person from every family.german shepherds r more loyal cuz they like the whole family.and they protect everyone i it.<br>  they don't need to be trained to protect.they need to be trained to attack or sometimes they just do it by themselves.|`|26PPwzrWaa	No for question 1. Personality is what does that. <br>  <br>  Seems to me you want a protection dog. No dog is good for that, especially those two breeds. Consider a chihuahua or other dog that when it bites, it wont hurt near as bad and get the dogs breed banned. <br>  <br>  Hip dysplasia(sp) is a condition in the breeds you have chosen. It affects many dog breeds and only way to avoid it is by luck. you can delay the issue, but you can not stop it. Feed a good quality ADULT dog food at or below 25% protein, preferably 24%. For the first two years of life. Then you can switch to a higher protein food. <br>  Keep exercise light for the first two years of life too. Just puppy play and short walking. <br>  <br>  Genes play a big role in that issue. A well bred dog with a great diet and lifestyle will hopefull delay the issue. Maybe it will never be an actual problem for the dog. Although their are no promises to that. That is the chance you take when getting a large breed dog. <br>  <br>  Both are very loyal and with the right family/pack leader, will do fine. Please learn about BSL before obtaining any dog, but in particular these breeds or other breed affected by BSL.

They are solitary and really should be kept separate. There is no benefit in keeping them together except for you only have one cage to clean. If one gets sick, all of them can get sick, they can easily get stressed, and there may be feeding problems. I have over 150 snakes and keep all of them separate. If money is a problem, buy Sterilite bins from Walmart, put holes in them, and heat them with heat pads. But I strongly advise you to not keep 4 adults together. I'm not even a fan of keeping two snakes together, but four is a bit excessive.

oMmBhWK4aa	Great you have a decent size tank for your betta, he'll be able to show off his full gracefulness swimming in a 5-gallon tank and be much livelier.<br>  <br>  As for the plant u showed, it's egeria densa which does need to be planted into the substrate. If you don't want to plant, then use plants that anchor to driftwood or rocks, or floating plants. Java fern, mosses and dwarf anubias can be easily tied with fishing line to rocks & pieces of driftwood to create interesting & natural decor. They are undemanding plants with respect to lighting & nutrients. By the way, the use of driftwood helps to make the water a bit softer and acidic to simulate the betta's natural environment, also if you use some dried oak or Indian almond leaves.<br>  <br>  As for floating plants, there are very small ones like riccia fluitans (liverwort), azolla caroliniana (carolina fairy moss) & lemna minor (duckweed) that soon multiply on the surface or larger plants like pistia stratiotes (water lettuce) & salvinia auriculata (butterfly fern). Floating plants can act as anchors for bubblenests produced by bettas and gouramis. You just need to thin out the growth a bit if they spread too much.<br>  <br>  The plants mentioned above are pretty much no maintenance compared to other plants, suitable for plant novices and busy people. Live plants are always preferable to fake ones.|`|bDPVRtCNaa	Most plants require more than people realize. Appropriate substrates, fertilizers, co2, correct lighting...<br>  <br>  You didn't mention tank size.|`|TYohMrlXaa	Would you consider getting small terra cotta or glass pots?<br>  Easy to move and you could have any kind of plant you want. <br>  He might also like an extra one for a cave.<br>  <br>  The plant your looking at (moneywort I think it's called) does put down roots, it would probably live without gravel, but it would float at the top of the water.<br>  <br>  I have hornwort it's just floating in place underwater in my tank, I think that's what your looking for.|`|d4ed95bed4c328fffaf810f911eaa905aa	why not use a fake plant??<br>  <br>  a fish that is first and foremost HEALTHY will be able to heal himself if he happens to get scratched....<br>  <br>  that being said, there is no reason to not put substrate in your bettas tank. <br>  <br>  just be careful what you choose, many tiny gravel is polished and has no rough edges for your fish to scrape against.<br>  <br>  <br>  your fish will actually run a chance of being sicker in a tank with no substrate, with no substrate, there is no where for your healthy bacteria to live.|`|iW5cmYQPaa	There are many plants that don't require gravel to grow. Anubias is easy to grow, requires no special lighting, and is best grown secured to a rock or piece of driftwood. <br>  Hornwort prefers to be left free floating, and will often die at the base and break off if planted. It is also undemanding of water conditions and lighting. <br>  Java Moss grows well on rocks and driftwood as well. I secure it to my filter tube above the intake to camouflage it. <br>  <br>  The plant you have listed seems to be doing well in my Goldfish tank so far, (about 3 months,) but I do have it planted. <br>  <br>  That being said, there is really no reason to leave your tank bottom bare. A healthy Betta will not get small cuts, and if they do, they will be able to heal from them regardless of bottom substrate. In fact, substrate can help contain the wast between cleaning, leading to less of a chance that the fish will come in direct contact with unsanitary contaminants. <br>  <br>  To keep your Betta happy and healthy, and limit the likely-hood of illness and disease:<br>  1. A 5-gallon cycled tank is minimal for Betta health. (Please consider at least 5-gallons. It is much easier to maintain a 5+ gallon, takes up very little space, doesn't cost a whole lot more, and will make for a much happier Betta.) Smaller tanks and bowls do not maintain a consistent temperature, and it's nearly impossible to keep healthy water conditions. <br>  2. A filter is necessary in any tank in order to keep the water aerated and free of toxins. For Bettas it is best to set the filter flow to low, as they are not very strong swimmers.<br>  3. A heater is essential. Bettas need warm steady temperatures of about 80F, to thrive. Constant fluctuation leads to stress, which inevitably leads to disease and often death. You can find an inexpensive heater for a small tank at any fish store.<br>  4. In a 5-gallon tank, weekly 25% water changes, using a gravel siphon are necessary. Water conditioner must be added to the water before it is put in the tank to remove toxic chlorine, chloramine, metals, etc.<br>  <br>  Bettas have been known to live for 10 years. I have personally known them to live for 6.|`|wnnudNp5aa	Your best bet, if you have never owned a Betta, is to go to your library, a book store, or pet store, and get a book or 3 about them. Especially since all your other fish have died of diseases. I wouldn't blame it on the substrate, I would blame it on lack of knowledge on how to properly manage an aquarium. Please read up on these beautiful fish, to give yours a fighting chance!<br>  I use flat marbles as the substrate in my Betta tanks. Very easy to keep clean, and perfectly smooth, so they can't hurt delicate fins. <br>  The easiest plants to keep in a Betta tank are silk ones made for aquarium use. There isn't any real benefit to growing live plants in your Betta's tank, and it's just one more element you'll have to manage. Aquatic plants grown in the aquarium don't require soil, per se, but they do need something to anchor them, or they'll float at the surface.<br>  Forget the air pump. Bettas hate a lot of current, and it isn't necessary, they can breathe at the surface. You do need a filter, though. Get a gentle one that doesn't create a lot of current. Sponge filters are great for Bettas.<br>  These are just some of my best suggestions, gleaned from years of experience, and from reading about my hobby. Please do yourself and your future pet a favor, and read up on it, so you'll know how to properly care for your new little friend. Good luck!|`|NwZ6yrq7aa	fake plants would be easiest.  but, I do enjoy java ferns.  I have a pot on its side like a cave and a java fern tucked behind it in the corner, no planting.  just floats around.  I've also heard java moss is nice, I can't find any though.. :(  Moss balls are fun, they just sit there, you can roll it around every now and then to keep its round shape.

dcOJQYRJaa	Now before I start this, I am not a vet. I do have a lot of experience with horse injuries and things like this, however. Please talk to a vet or equine chiropractor. <br>  <br>  What I believe this to be is what is called a knocked-down hip. Many of these injuries come from something falling on the horse, like a tree branch, the horse getting severely cast in their stalls, or a fall on ice or in a trailer. This actually knocks down the hip and pulls it out of its natural position. It is painful at first but then the horse begins to get used to it and it does not ail then so much anymore. However he still needs to be seen. This injury is a severe one, whether or not he is in pain at the present time. If the vet comes out and adjusts him (although a knocked-down hip is irreversible, the injury may have pulled his back out of alignment), I think he would be able to be lightly ridden by small children with a well fitted, well-padded saddle. <br>  <br>  Like I said, I am in no means a veterinarian, so please talk to yours before you do anything. This is simply my education opinion. I hope you figure this out, and kudos to you for being a fellow rescuer!<br>  <br>  -and i TOTALLY agree with you. that Arab is the result of generations of line-breeding and insane characteristics that are considered "stylish"|`|ff42beaeb7a8ee5d3b32dd2655c08c36aa	i do not think this is a birth defect.<br>  the horse has a knocked down hip and the rest of his body has twisted up to compensate for it.<br>  it is caused by sloppy handeling and allowing horses to run in and out of their stalls .  when they make the turn to go in the stall (or auction shoot or horse trailer) and bang their hip..it casues the hip to actually pop out of its socket.  it tears the soft tissue attachments.<br>  it is not curable or reversable.<br>  most can be used at walking trail horses.and with his tempremenet he would be perfect for this.<br>  i would def. have the vet look at the hip when he comes to do your horses spring shots and teeth.<br>  i hope you can keep him forever:)|`|UIM8X38Oaa	I know you don't have a lot of money but you would really need to find out what is going on in there with a good vet.  Sometimes a good chiropractor could help if he is out of alignment.<br>    One other thing I did notice form your pictures is that his left front hoof has a high heel and left is low.  Which will also through him off a bit  because of the way he is moving on his front legs.  <br>    A good ferrier can trim him up more evenly (take heel off one and toe off the other) and it will help to square him up.<br>  But looks like his hip is out to me.<br>  <br>  And that Arab is a bit deformed I would say, I am into Arabs and that is not what you are looking for  :)<br>  <br>  I hope this was helpful<br>  I think he is a beautiful horse<br>  Jenny|`|jVriLcSLaa	haha yeh that arabian looks like a seahorse. poor thing.<br>  <br>  but your horse. the pictures of his hip he isnt standing straight. he does look like a happy kid tho and hes super cute. if he is not in pain i would not worry about it. if he is i would get some buteless. i dont think its a birth defect he just doesnt have the best conformation. his legs are actually pretty straight just a little toed in. i would get his feet trimmed soon though because they are starting to flatten out and that can cause more pain. since he's barefoot you could even learn to do it yourself and that would save you alot of money but be careful. one of my colleagues trims all of her horses.|`|iynxbd9Daa	ummm... it looks like hes done something to his hip in an old injury and it might be slightly out.<br>  i would suggest searching for your local horse chairopracter (im not sure how to spell it) or equine vet and getting him to take a look at your horse. they can be considerably cheaper than vets.<br>  P.S. that is a truly cute and gorgeous horse to the max... <br>   =)|`|TSc8OE4vaa	What a cutie!  That looks more like an old injury than a birth defect to me.  Not sure what he'd need to stay comfortable, but I know a stud who looks to have a similar injury.  The stud was a few weeks premature so he was a weak baby, and then his mother stepped on him so he has leg troubles... it's a pity because he has some of the best Welsh pony lines in the country and he's gorgeous!<br>  <br>  Anyway, may or may not be able to live comfortably, I can't say.  If he is uncomfortable it may be kindest to euthanize him.  He will probably never be rideable.<br>  <br>  (BTW, the "deformed" horse isn't deformed, it's a very typey arabian.  Personally I think that such an extreme head is unattractive but many people breed for that look)<br>  <br>  EDIT-  Yep, that's what a super-type Arabian looks like.  Here are some normal Arabians...<br>  <a href="http://www.brookvillearabians.com/photos/stallions/charisma/2004/tuttcover.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://www.brookvillearabians.com/photos...</a><br>  <a href="http://img237.imageshack.us/img237/5338/noblegigiheadyq5.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://img237.imageshack.us/img237/5338/...</a><br>  <br>  See how the face is dished?  Then some people get carried away and take the dished face to the extreme, and you wind up with something like you posted.|`|IMPvzBk1aa	I agree with others who think this is a knocked down hip from a previous blow injury.  My experience is that these horses can recover thoroughly enough to be useful for pleasure or trail riding....nothing with high speed or too athletically demanding.  It's important to condition the muscles carefully, and your vet is the best one to advise you on what exercises will be safe to strengthen his haunches.|`|DLxh9CANaa	I agree with everyone else- this horse has definitely had a hip injury, and a serious one, at some point. It took me a while to actually see it, though, because of his brilliant dark coat color. Your best bet is going to be a thorough evaluation by both the vet and by a chiropractor, as soon as you can afford to have it done. As for the Arabian, I actually have WORKED with horses which looked like that- and the other writer who says that this horse was bred to look that way is correct. He was. He's most like an Egyptian Arabian, and there is a strain or type among these horses which is ULTRA refined, called the Sglawi strain. This horse has many of the characteristics of that strain, including the massive dish to his face, and the huge jowl. I knew a number of horses like this when I worked on a farm in New Jersey a number of years ago- the owner of the farm bred Arabians and Warmbloods for dressage. One of the horses bred at that farm was a stallion who eventually was sent to Europe to learn classical dressage, and the intention was to have him stand at stud there too. I'm not certain what eventually happened to him, however. I do know that he looked a lot like the horse that's pictured- he too was ultra refined, and very feminine looking. <br>  <br>  Good luck with your horse.|`|cSqx1DxKaa	Everyone else has it right.  This poor boy had a serious injury earlier in his life and now his body has grown and developed to accomodate it.  It looks potentially painful.  I hope you can get the vet out to see him sometime soon.  I think a chiropractor might be able to relieve some of the pressure and tension he is very likely feeling.  He's a cute horse.  That Arab you posted, however, is scaring the hell out of me!|`|58410e61549a3fe40d177cf7e71fc875aa	Looks like a bad pelvic fracture has occured in this horse at some point.<br>  <br>  Some info here:<br>  <a href="http://www.petergray.org.uk/news3.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.petergray.org.uk/news3.html</a><br>  (please read the full article)<br>  <br>  I know you're going to struggle to find the money, but the best person to advise on this horses future is a good equine vet.<br>  Without seeing the horse move, nobody can really assess the full extent of his problem.|`|aKSicRp9aa	your horse looks like he's happy, is he in any pain?<br>  hopefully you can find out something to help him.<br>  that Arab however, is hideous.<br>  if people are breeding for that on purpose, I can't understand why.<br>  Regular Arabs are very pretty but that one is pitiful.
S9ZNGhqyaa	WOW... that's intersting...<br>  From what I know of Cocker Spaniels are about average smartnes in general, but your dog sounds like a GENIUS!|`|sQOXjKFNaa	Do you have a neopet?
6MQsUhHLaa	just because you want to hold and cuddle her dosn't mean that she wants to be held and cuddled. some dogs are like that. my dad's is one. he's loving playfull and frendly, but hates being held or picked up. he simply dosn't seem to feel safe about it. so we simply don't pick him up or hold him. like people, some like to hug everyone they know, and others don't like to be toutched. don't push her or one day she may just get sick of warning you not to do something she obviously dislikes and flat out tell you with her teeth. lover her in a way she comfortable with, on the ground, where she don't feel trapped.|`|ZLjeDe7xaa	So what makes you think that breeders are not abusive. Haven't you heard of puppy mils. My mom went to buy a Pomeranian once at this supposedly notable breeders place and she could hardly walk through the front door of the house, what with all the bird cages, cat and dog kennels blocking the the entrance. Do you think that's a nice environment for a puppy to grow up in from a very young age..I highly doubt that this lady ever took all those dogs (20 or more) on regular walks, don't you.<br>  <br>  <br>  Anyway, you should first  take the animal to a vet to be certain that she doesn't have any stomach problems or illnesses. If the dog is sick, she will snarl. Its her way of letting you know that shes in pain. But since you you got this dog at 3 -4 years, shes not going to be comfortable around you right anyway.It will take time for her to learn to trust you and this will be an even longer process if she has in fact been abused. And some breeds are more vicious than others, especially smaller dogs, who feel vulnerable because of their size.|`|qh0YrhN5aa	She is obviously uncomfortable being picked up. Dogs often nip or act out when they are being picked up because the pressure of the hands or the fear of the dog causes them to act out. I would just stopped trying to pick her up. If she doesn't like it...don't do it.|`|G2lER6uSaa	maybe your dog has artheritis, and it hurts when you pick her up...|`|MLB9Z3qOaa	maybe it has pain take her to the vet|`|2u8teJkJaa	Just because she came from a breeder does not mean she was not abused. I have seen many breeders and hoarders that abuse animals.Did you just get this dog?<br>  She may be in some kind of pain like the other person said. Take her to the vet if this is some thing new with her.|`|vOYyFqxRaa	First, all dogs are weird in some way. This has been my observation. <br>  <br>  Second, Some dogs just don't like being picked up. I have one of those and it is just her personality. However, it could be a dominance issue. You need to assert your Alpha status. It will keep her from biting you but not from  growling when you pick her up. <br>  <br>  It would help to know what breed she is.|`|AoSeHXeQaa	Assuming your dog does not have a physical problem, I would say you probably have a dominant dog.  <br>  <br>  A dominant dog does not allow another dog to touch it.  She is trying to put you in your place, as she would another dog.  <br>  <br>  I am fostering a chihuahua right now with a similar attitude. :o)<br>  <br>  My suggestion would be to do two things: <br>  <br>  First, take her for a long walk every day.  Not a meandering walk where she is allowed to sniff at everything, a brisk walk where she has to stay beside you, and can only stop when you do.<br>  <br>  Second, touch her firmly on the neck when she growls or snaps at you, and tell her NO.  If she bites and runs away, put a leash on her before you work with her.<br>  <br>  My little foster girl was a terrible biter when I got her.  She is pretty good after two weeks working with her.  No biting, anymore. She still growls when I pick her up to make her do something she doesnt like, but it is more of a protest than a threat.|`|AA10400143	I would not say she's been abused. If you said she tucks her tail & pees when you pick her up, then maybe, but not for acting that way. I would take her to the vet & make sure she is ok. If they give her a clean bill of health, you have to assume she is just over spoiled! I have seen this far to many times eps.in smaller breeds. If this is the case, tell her NO in a Stern voice when she acts this way. Make sure it is every time & she will get it. You can't just not pick her up for acting this way! If you do, you'll have fun finding a vet or groomer who will see her.|`|pd5rERcfaa	Has she had any training?  Is she properly socialized?  There are a ton of possible reasons, so its kind of tough to point to one.  First, take her to the vet, make sure the problem isn't physical.  It could be that she is just not used to being picked up, then its something you need to introduce her to slowly; touch her back, if she doesn't respond reward her with a treat, if she reacts negatively correct the behavior.  Hope some of this helps.|`|AA11244754	You need to take her to the vet to find out why she's doing this.  My roommate has a miniature schnauzer who seems to have sensitive skin because he gets picked up in the wrong way he will snap or bite because it hurts.

I would maybe brush her down every day, even if its just for 5 min's. That will help, but will not eliminate the shedding. All dogs shed, some more than other, and yes it can be frustrating at times always cleaning up the hair.

26PPwzrWaa	I would correct the behavior. If you are leader, no need for dominance. <br>  <br>  Owners freak out at the dog park all the time. With a maltese you have a lot less of that stigma. I have a great dane and if he wants to play, he rudely pounces. One dog had been pounced and rolled over to submit and yogi kept trying to get him to play. Well his owner saw the two and though he was biting her dog when if he had, there would've been some puncture wounds minimum if not a very High vet bill with his stomach exposed. She comes over and Screams at my very rude dog thinking that is the way to solve the issue. By the time she noticed her dog was not happy with my dog, her dog had told my dog off. <br>  I got my dog and left. Which with idiots is all you can do.<br>  <br>  If you choose to go to dog parks, go armed with a bit of a bullet proof vest. Dog owners dont know dog behavior typically, especially those that show up to a dog park. Your dog will at some point cause an issue just as all three of mine have. Just as some other dogs have been good with my dog, but others are not. I stopped going to dog parks because yogi needs to learn that behavior is not good. He needs to know who is boss and he doesnt get that yet. I now set up meet ups with dogs I know he gets along with. <br>  <br>  Learn dog behaivor: <a href="http://www.flyingdogpress.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.flyingdogpress.com</a>|`|NVg06Egwaa	I am so glad that you care enough about your pet and his health, to see if this is normal etc...seek a solution. It annoys me SO much when people bring their un-neutered dogs (which they DON'T have appointments for yet) and let them hump every dog their. Now, I am not saying this is your case. <br>  <br>  This is a great sign, that you have already made an appointment. Until then, try to tire him out a little before you come to the park. A 20 min walk, so he's less interested in dog-butts. Or, bring his favorite toy, bring a kong, ball...just not a rawhide or something directly edible b/c of other dogs wanting it. <br>  <br>  Does he have a favorite game?<br>  <br>  For example, my girl dog (she's like my baby!!) LOVES to explore! She is pointer/lab/beagle...something like that, so it's natural.. It's is actually quite handy, b/c then she likes to just roam the dog park and she's SOOO happy and tired when she's done. <br>  <br>  If he's not like that, try to get him to walk the perimeter of the dog park fence with you, just to smell and walk and enjoy it.<br>  <br>  Also, it IS normal for dogs to small rears when meeting. It tells them all kinds of information; gender, age, health condiiton etc...<br>  <br>  but from what you said, it sounds like he wants to get more aggressive. And it is GREAT that you intervene so that nothing goes wrong.  I'm especially happy to hear that you are seeking exercise for him also. But like you said, it is also a dominance thing. <br>  <br>  Puppy/dog obedience classes are AWESOME for this!!  Petco's/Petsmart's can get expensive sometimes, so look and see for some cheaper options in your area. Our local community center offers one for 25% cheaper. But a good obedience class, can not only teach him great manners, but also appropriate interaction with other dogs. And I think this can be key with male dogs especially, regardless of their size. <br>  <br>  If this behavior continues on after neutering, talk to your vet, they can realllllllly help!!!<br>  <br>  Good luck!
52162133e9e06553229902bb43a5182caa	<a href="http://www.newrider.com/Library/Riding_Tips/putting_on_saddle.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.newrider.com/Library/Riding_T...</a>|`|penuzN8jaa	The placement of the saddle is very important. Place the saddle blanket on the horse and the saddle on top of it. The front of the saddle should be slightly behind the withers. You should stand on the left side of the horse, and pull the left stirrup up, hooking it over the saddle horn. This makes it easier to tie the cinch strap to the saddle. Reach under the horse’s belly for the girth, which should be connected to the right side of the saddle. Take the cinch strap, located on the left side of the saddle, and pull it through the buckle on the girth, pulling the girth securely under and against the horse’s belly. <br>  <br>  <br>  Make sure the girth is not twisted, and check to make sure there is at least a hand’s width between the front leg and the girth. You don’t want there to be too much space, as this can hurt the horse’s back. You also don’t want the girth too close to the front leg, as this can pinch the horse and restrict his movements. <br>  <br>  <br>  Bring the cinch strap up towards the buckle on the left side of the saddle, and thread the strap away from you, through the buckle and back down and through the buckle on the girth. Depending on the length of the girth and the size of the horse, you may need to do this process two or three times. You are now going to make essentially the same knot you would make if you were tying a tie. Bring the strap up and through the top buckle for the final time, pulling it to the side, take the strap across the front of the girth, forming the knot, bring it around the back of the other side of the buckle, and pull it back down behind the length of strap that runs across the girth. <br>  <br>  <br>  You should now have what looks like a tie knot. Pull as tightly as possible. If your horse has a tendency to blow out his belly while being saddled, you will need to tighten the girth some more after you put the bridle on him. <br>  <br>  <br>  To bridle a horse, stand parallel to the left side of his head, holding the bridle in your left hand. You can place the bridle over the halter, so it won’t be necessary to remove it, and your horse should still be on the crossties or rope. Place the reins over his head to rest on his neck. With your right hand, take hold of the crown piece of the halter, and begin pulling it over the horse’s ears. At the same time, with your left hand, gently push the bit into the horse’s mouth, between his teeth. Keep your fingers out of harm’s way. You don’t want to be bitten. <br>  <br>  <br>  The muzzle strap of the bridle should be about four inches above the nostrils. The chinstrap should be tightened but be sure and leave a space of about two fingers between the strap and the horse. You will now need to buckle the throatlatch. Leave enough space for a fist to fit between the strap and the throat of the horse. The strap will be buckled along the left side of the horse’s head. Check the saddle girth one more time to make sure it is snug. You are now ready to ride. With a little patience and practice, you can become more comfortable and adept at saddling and bridling your horse.<br>  Good luck, I hope I have helped!!<br>  xxxxxxx|`|jVriLcSLaa	a saddle should sit about the center of the withers because when you sit the saddle will slip back a little so you wanna put it a little higher. the girth should be tight so you cant pull out and get a lot of space between your hand and he horses body. just snug enough where you can get your hand in between the girth and body. the girth should also sit right behind the elbow of the horse and not around his belly. <br>  <br>  the bridle you wanna cup with bit with your left hand and hold the top of the bridle (headstall) with the other. bring your left hand with the bit to the horses mouth and hold the headstall against his forehead as high i you can so that there is not much slack otherwise when the horse opens his mouth the bit will slip into his mouth instead of falling down as many beginners make this mistake. so your left hand has the bit against lips and you want to slip your thumb in his mouth to where he has no teeth. he should open his mouth and quickly you want to pull up with your right hand GENTLY and then pull the headstall over the ears. straighten out the nose band and make sure all the straps are straight. the check piece should be in the middle of his cheek and you should be able to fit 2 fingers between the nose band. its confusing and its something that practice will help with and watching. hope this helps a little
NAGiNKFWaa	Well the bladder isn't grown until 6-months-old, and they are not fully potty trained until 1-year-old,  don't get stressed if she has an accident.  Take her outside, use your commands, and praise her when she does good.  You have to go with them when they go out to go potty, so they know what you want from them.  Here are some tips, use what helps.  I use a crate* to potty train with, but only for potty training and then I break it down and store it.  I put blankets and a small food and water dish in the crate.  Dogs don't potty where they eat and sleep.  When they are first little, I only expect them to hold their potty for 4 hours, and then 6 hours, then 8 hours and so on.  So when they are first little, I set a timer or alarm clock to wake myself up at night to take them *out.  I only allow my puppy in the bedroom* or the living room, only one room at a time.  They have to graduate to more space.  If I allow them to have full run of the house, it will overwhelm them.  I take them out the same door each time.  I tie a dinner bell to the door handle.  Do not use a jingle bell as they could get their toe caught in it.  So when they are little, I ring the bell for them, and then open the door to go *outside to potty.  When they get bigger, I take their paw and whack the bell and open the door to go potty.  Eventually getting to the place where the puppy will ring the bell and let me know when they need to go potty.  Dogs want to please you, so it is your job to let them know what behaviors please you and what doesn't.  So when my puppy goes potty, I give her a treat*, and clap, and make a fuss and praise her.  So she learns that going potty outside makes me happy.  If she has an accident, make a disgust sound like “tsst” and take her out right away.  I never yell* or spank* my puppies.  Take them out when they first wake up, after they eat or drink, before nap, finish romping, when their activities change, or when they are sniffing around. Some puppies go pee right away, but may not go poop until 10 minutes later, so wait for the poop.  I have a little play time here, because sometimes I think they are done, and they are not.  Puppies train at their own pace.  While I may have a puppy that hasn't had an accident in several weeks, I don't let my guard down.  I don't expect my puppies to be "fully potty trained" until one-year-old.  If they have a setback, shake it off, and start over.  I only have my puppies in the crate when I am not watching them.  When I am sleeping, cooking, ironing, doing chores, basically when I am not watching her.  All other times, she is out of the crate practicing being a "big girl."  This is the time I train her how to behave in the house.  So we are practicing "no barking", 'no biting", "no jumping", and "don't eat the furniture."  I also have to practice "playing inside" so she doesn't knock over things.  You must keep the puppy in sight when they are little because they don’t know the difference between newspaper and carpet, and you don’t want them sneaking off and getting into trouble.   Some puppies can sleep through the night around 3-months-old, but their bladder is grown around 6-months-old.<br>   <br>  REVISIONS: <br>  *I use a CRATE to train with.  It is the method I prefer, compared to other methods I have tried.  I noticed that if they are in the crate, while I am doing chores, they are o.k., because the crate allows them to see me and be re-assured.  The crate can also be a comfort when stored in the basement for dogs who live in areas where thunderstorms and tornados are an issue. .  However, use the method that works best for you.....a laundry basket, a cardboard box, a woof-woof house, x-pen, child gates, whatever works for you.<br>  *OUTSIDE, pee pad, litter box, whichever method you are using.   When the puppy is first little, keep the pee pad, litter box near the food and water dish, so the puppy can eat and drink, and then go potty.  You can move it away as they get older.  The pee pad has a scent that smells and initiates potty.  Sometimes a pee pad makes a sound that scares some puppies, so you might want to use a litter box if that happens.  The pee pad allows a puppy to walk around, but a litter box keeps the puppy in one place. <br>  *BEDROOMS, I use the bedroom and living room for training, because it works for me.  Choose rooms that work for you, but watch for rooms that are damp, or drafty.  While my puppies sleep in the bedroom during training, once they are trained, I let them sleep where they want to.  They don't have to sleep in the bedroom forever.<br>  *TREATS.  While I use treats for training, you don't have to.  I like Charlee Bears for training (a little cracker for a little mouth,) I use them for training, but once they are trained, I cut back on them. <br>  *SOME PUPPIES will go potty in the same spot each time.  Some puppies have to be told to go potty.  A command like "go out" for pee, or "go finish" for poop, might work for you, keep saying “go finish” until the puppy poops.  This is a good thing to train if you travel with your dogs.  By using commands, the puppy won't get confused when you are visiting someone, on vacation with you, or when you get to a new home.  The command will tell them what you want them to do in an unfamiliar place.  You might also want to use a leash method, so the puppy doesn’t sneak off, or for strange places.<br>  *YELLING.  It is not a good idea to "yell" or "spank" your puppy and then take them outside when they have an accident.  They may get confused and think that going outside is punishment.  While you want to correct them, if you are extreme, they may not want to go outside again.  Shake it off, and resume your schedule.  You have to keep it real.  Puppies train at their own pace, but a puppy can only hold their potty for a few hours.  A guide would be 1 hour for each month of age, plus 1 hour, so a three-month-old puppy should only be expected to hold their potty for 4 hours at most.    <br>  SOURCE:  These tips, tricks, and ideas were contributed from many brilliant minds.

A dog is either purebred or a mutt, so the number of breeds mixed doesn't matter.|`|18f339d2d88d8a05cc418425220b52e1aa	It is still a mix & is still called a mutt.|`|oK5kVlrnaa	The number of breeds mixed together doesnt matter. It is either a purebred or a mutt!!|`|637af0df73292f4d1c8ec85214c9a369aa	It's still a mutt- a dog mixed with two or more breeds is a mutt.

Set up an appointment ASAP.|`|Bw18seFqaa	might be ringworm..  which is a highly contagious fungal infection.|`|20244512d33d2e4edb6c55c4bcd03bbaaa	my mini dachshund oscar has the same thing.  it is ok, i think it is because of winter.  you dog will be ok|`|R3SZ2hT4aa	sounds like the fungal infection called "ringworm">not really a worm,but a common fungus in dogs and other animals.ur vet can give u a cream to put on it.dont handle the rings,people can catch this.it isnt dangerous in any way,just unsightly.my entire nursing class caught this from a patient once,we werent aware he had it,and in those days,u didnt wear gloves to change bed linens.it could be hot spots as well this is a skin allergy common to dogs..u can get cortisone spray from walmart,plus a medication -yellow liquid,comes in a bottle at walmart for 3 dollars.cant remember the name of it,but it says for hot spots on the label.this worked as well for my dog as the more expensive treatments from my vet.but this time,u will need a vet to tell if its ringworm or hotspots.|`|TInJIfKfaa	Take him to the vet! That could be any number of things, all of which will need a vet's care.|`|EBeUj5tuaa	it could be hot spots
iVQULHqYaa	Puppies are excitable, lovable hooligans. They have bursts of unbelievable energy, however in order to grow they need lots of sleep. New puppies need a room where they can rest and sleep and the other dogs in the house need respite. Older dogs don’t want puppies biting their ears and chewing their necks, if a puppy does this, the older dogs should be allowed to chastise the puppy. How would you cope if you were expected to cope with an unruly toddler twenty four hours a day? Would you be annoyed, if you had a toddler thrust upon you who pulled your hair and poked your eyes? I am sure that you would grumble.<br>  <br>  Please don’t expect your dog to cope with an unruly puppy and to baby-sit twenty four hours a day.  Supervise them for SHORT play sessions in the garden and if the puppy is over exuberant, allow your dog to chastise it, then put your puppy in its own room to rest. Don’t expect your dog to want to sleep with your puppy or to play with it constantly. <br>  <br>  Your puppy will possibly need about four meals a day. Divide your other dog’s rations into four and feed it (or them) when you feed your puppy.  Give your existing dog extra attention when the puppy is resting and make him feels special.<br>  <br>  There will be visitors, who want to see your puppy. When the doorbells rings, put your puppy into another room and tell your visitors to fuss your adult dog or dogs and give them treats BEFORE they make a fuss of the puppy.<br>  <br>  Older dogs love puppies, with the proviso that YOU stop the puppy from being a pain in the bum. They don’t want a puppy being thrust upon them all of the time. If you do this any dog will object and be confused.|`|MpTZjdLJaa	she is trying to have fun<br>  she is simply a puppy and needs some attention<br>  just play with her a lot and she wil eventually stop or you can separate them as a last resort|`|kceGobAXaa	maybe she is just trying to play?  if she is new to your home, she may just be trying to establish herself.  chi's are funny little pups.|`|U02Ku6jpaa	she is trying to find out who is the top dog and she cant reach any higher than the ankles|`|Lazhb6CWaa	bcause it is stupid
J5hsCONRaa	It takes a while - go into your profile and check your questions, make sure you put it in the right section!|`|OrvTG44laa	Yeah, it doesn't always show up right away.  Try refreshing the page, that usually works.
D1beU6MPaa	As an owner of eight dogs and have always had multiple dogs I think I can safely tell you that you are going to have to  keep them separated. I have a Great Pyr that I have to keep separated from the others as he does not get along with any of them. Once they start being aggressive, it is nearly impossible to make them get along. It isn't something you can train them out of. I have had dogs all of my life under many different circumstances, and I can tell you that this is not an easy problem to fix. I am giving you advice through many years of experience, so if I get 100 thumbs down, please know that I am certain of the advice I am giving you. If you can't keep them separated, it would be best to find the weimaranar a good home. <br>  I know how hard it is and to worry about him getting a good home, but you can be very picky as to whom you rehome him to. Good luck to you<br>  <br>  Poodle Mom, I am so sorry. But I have had so much experience with this and know it is such a bad situation.. But it is best for the protection of your smaller dogs. As I said, I have to keep my Pyr away from the others for their protection. I am very concerned for you and know all too well what you are feeling. If it isn't too much trouble, could you please let me know what you decide to do? Some of these questions I really do worry about and take to heart.|`|f9fb186e1c82bf7349b1e14dcbb1bcc4aa	If you weren't there to see the attack, are you positive that the Weim did it? Perhaps the dog got caught on the fence ?? How do you know exactly the route of escape if you didn't see what happened? Has the dog shown other signs of aggression towards the dog ? <br>  <br>  I would have him checked by the vet, talk to a trainer and find out for sure what is going on..|`|oK5kVlrnaa	You may not need to give your dog away. That is a very heart breaking situation. Possibly, you can hire a good dog trainer or behaviorist, who will help with your situation!<br>  <br>  I will pray for your dogs to get better and grow to be great friends!!|`|MYEEK4dcaa	First, take heart!  Your weimaraner CAN be rehabilitated so that he is no longer aggressive toward your chihuahua. You may not have to separate them 24/7  if you're willing to never leave them alone together unsupervised.  But if you keep them separated, the problem will never go away because they won't have a chance to practice getting along.  <br>  <br>  You have to be able to catch the weim when he is just THINKING about attacking the chi and stop him THEN -  not after the attack has begun.  Keep him on a leash tied to your waist when the chi is out and about, so the weim cannot try to sneak up on the chi and ambush him.<br>  <br>  Set yourself up to be pack leader.  Here's how:<br>  <br>  A. Behave like a leader at key points of responsibility within the pack and that makes you the leader. <br>  <br>    1.  Eat your own meals before you feed your dog.  Even if you have to munch on a cracker while he watches, make sure he knows you're done eating before you allow him to start eating.<br>  <br>    2.  Make and enforce at least 5 household rules (such as "No begging at the table" and "Stay off the furniture").<br>  <br>    3.  Lead the walk, with the dog walking beside you, at heel.  Never use a flexi-lead because you can't control your dog if he is 15-25 feet out in front of you. <br>  <br>    4.  Exercise the dog by a brisk walk with the dog at heel at least once a day, preferably twice a day. A dog can walk for 5 minutes for each month of his life up to the age of 12 months; after that he can walk as long as you want to walk.  Be sure to check the surface on which he'll be walking - if it is too hot or too cold for you to rest your hand on, it will be too hot or too cold for his feet.  You can get booties for him at some of the larger pet stores, or try Paw Wax.<br>  <br>    5.  Playing with the dog is demonstrating affection for him; it's a bonding time.   Be sure you start the play and you end it.<br>  <br>    6.  Own and provide all resources like food, treats, bones, and toys.  Leave food down only 15 minutes then pick up the bowl. Give toys to dog when you want to play; put toys away when you're done playing.<br>  <br>    7.  Ignore the dog for at least 5 minutes when you come home so he will recognize that you are "top dog" in the pack.<br>  <br>    8.  Greet strangers (guests at home, friends and passersby on the street) first and direct the dog how to react to them. <br>  <br>    9.  Protect the dog from onrushing, off-leash dogs, dogs who are harassing them, and dogs who challenge them.<br>  <br>   10.  The dog gets NOTHING (except water and potty breaks) unless he works for it.  "Working" means obeying whatever command you offer, such as sit, stay, stand, and down.  (This is the essence of the NILIF program.)<br>  <br>   11.  Never pet the dog or comfort it when it is misbehaving.  Never talk in a high squeaky voice to a dog.  Dogs don't understand what it means to have their feelings hurt.<br>  <br>   12.  Don't let the dog sleep in your bed until you are sure he sees you as his pack leader; you don't want him to try to own the bed.<br>  <br>  <br>  B. There are four "MUST READ" books you can probably get at Amazon.com. They will explain all the rituals listed above.<br>  <br>    1.  The first is "Be The Pack Leader" by Cesar Millan. Teaches you how to be a pack leader.  <br>  <br>    2.  The second is "The Dog Listener" by Jan Fennell. Teaches you how to get willing cooperation from your dog.<br>  <br>    3.  The third is "The Art of Raising A Puppy" by the Monks of New Skete. Teaches you how to get a puppy started right as a member of your pack.<br>  <br>    4.  The fourth and last is "A Member of the Family" by Cesar Millan and Melissa Jo Pelletier.  Teaches you how to raise your dog from the moment you get him to the moment he has to leave you.<br>  <br>  C.  You might consider signing up for "Sessions with Cesar" at <a href="http://www.sessionswithcesar.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.sessionswithcesar.com</a> , where you'll find video and audio lessons, as well as printable materials to help you learn to be your dog's pack leader and help you learn to handle specific behavior problems.   <br>  <br>  D.   You might also consider buying (or renting from Netflix or from the library) Cesar's "Mastering Leadership" series of DVDs.  You'll get a LOT of help from those!<br>  <br>  Good luck!<br>  <br>  Apacapacas
Mcf33eLbaa	I see problems ahead with vice grips coca cola being doubled up in the pedigree.<br>  Doubling up on a dog that your breeding is never a good practice.<br>  Good Luck and God Bless|`|f9fb186e1c82bf7349b1e14dcbb1bcc4aa	Don't know their pedigrees but the photos included with the pedigree show that the dogs are horrible examples of the breed..|`|lSiEKZFIaa	Yes I'm familiar with the mother's pedigree the banjo is champion blood! And also the bolio which is almost extinct is great and the tombstone is also alright its blood is known for big heads and body structure!<br>  And as far as looks game pit bulls can look like hound dogs and still be pure that's why its great to have papers so that u know the puppy blood is identical to the mom/dad blood!<br>  <br>  In my eyes these are great puppies, most likely really expensive no less than 600 dollars!|`|J5hsCONRaa	You want a dog from people who clearly fight them?! Note the last one - " WAS IN ABSOLUTE CONTROL, FROM START TO FINISH, AND BOY COULD HE FINISH." Telling me thats not a dog that isnt a fighter - look at the scars and punctures around his muzzle!!<br>  <br>  I'd stay well away - unless thats what you are looking for....?|`|34uWa9kHaa	You have asked this and has been answered.

8TLCxEJzaa	chihuahua hater.|`|stCyrS4Eaa	Nobody should just get a dog as a gift for someone. It was irresponsible of him. This should have been something you were involved in choosing. You have a right to these feelings. If you are not happy with your new pup, you realize it is a 10- 12 year investment of love. You need to choose a dog that is right for you. You should be able to take the dog back where he came from. They should understand. Don't worry about hurting your bf's feelings. He should have thought this through better. It will be a learning experience for him.|`|TkJXWpFkaa	wow tuff decision but if you cant give it the love it needs you'll be doing the right thing giving him up dogs need lots of attention and someone that loves it im sure you love it but i know what you mean bout likeing bigger dogs i think its something you and your boyfriend need to talk about|`|637af0df73292f4d1c8ec85214c9a369aa	Honestly, no you shouldn't keep the dog if you don't want it.  You'll end up resenting both the dog and your boyfriend in the long run.  Keeping the puppy to spare your boyfriend's feelings isn't the right reason to have a dog.<br>  <br>  This is the problem with people buying puppies as presents for people.|`|Zjq6vcAvaa	well girl i tell u one thing,better now than later.ur bf should b moreunderstanding.its not selfish.i like cats a lot and have 5 in my house due to family,but it doesn,t mean that i am crazy about them,if ur bf wants u to give ur time to his dog than he better pay u in return.ur mobile phone bill for instance.goodluck|`|2Xr3m0X9aa	it really depends on if its worth making ur bf mad train it if it cry allot when u don't let it sleep in your bed show its how is boss don't abuse it just lay down the law discipline same thing with kids|`|FX7t4IdEaa	maybe you should see how it goes? maybe u will learn to like it?<br>  <br>  but if your really not happy i'm sure your bf culd understand<br>  <br>  goodluck :)
f9fb186e1c82bf7349b1e14dcbb1bcc4aa	You should feed your dog a good quality kibble.. You shouldn't need to supplement to keep up her energy if she is being fed properly.

If she won't take it herself.
j2albguDaa	if the do was going to hurt you, he would've already.  you need to take him to the vet to see if he has a microchip, if he does, then it will have the owners information.  if he doesn't, put up flyers for him, if no one claims him, either keep him or call the local humane society.  if you call a shelter, most of them put dogs to sleep if not claimed and humane society's don't.|`|AA10500537	see if it has a collar on maybe the owners phone# is on it if not call animal control but check with neighbors first cause you can save them lots of money if you find  the owner|`|q1JadeWWaa	personally, id take care of the poor guy.<br>  if he growls at you, stay away from him<br>  but if he keeps his head low, ears back, and wags his tail, your good<br>  <br>  you should put up flyers to let people know you found him, then his owner(if he has one) can get him back|`|k9gC23apaa	You can call animal control or take it into a local vet and have them scan the dog to see if the dog is microchipped.  If microchipped you can locate owners.  You also can put fliers up around the neighbrhood ! Or may just have a new dog, good luck !|`|NF0fUntZaa	call ur local animal shelter. or email me. just look at my stuff on my info. i know alot. trust me
Kj8Ie77waa	I wouldn't get another dog just to cure the problems of the other. I know some people try that for a dog with seperation axiety, which is hard to defeat since it often happens when the dog is alone, and so they need someone to stay with it all the time, aka another dog. Still, that can backfire also if the new dogs developes SA too.<br>  <br>  But what your saying is you have a dog whose temperment is a bit off kilter. Dogs CAN get depressed, often times due to not enough attention or exercise. But the biting? That should not be aloud "at all". Another dog may simply learn this behavior of biting from the old dog, and you don't want that. I would suggest working through these problems with your old dog becfore thinking of adding a completely new set of angles in with a new dog.<br>  <br>  Try more exercise, try taking him to a dogpark so he can meet and play with other dogs now and then, perhaps try another training class, for continued obediance, or maybe something fun like agility. Try taking him to the vet and making sure nothing is wrong. Or if you have the money, seek out a behaviorist.<br>  <br>  But getting another dog is not an end all, it could just as easily "add" to the problem, more than anything.<br>  <br>  Work through the problems you have with the current dog before getting another one.  Perhaps he is just lonely or under challenged since he is not getting trained as much since the puppy classes are over? Training is not something that ends with the puppy class, you need to practise it every day, or the dog can forget, just like how you can forget math formulas if not practised! It also challenges a dog's mind and gives them a job, and gives them your attention while you train together.<br>  <br>  So my advice would be to try all of the above first and formost, instead of trying to get another dog.|`|m81dfyOYaa	My westie pup was so lethargic when our senior dog died (and they didn't even like each other) that we got another pup. Some dogs don't do well in a one dog home and obviously others do. It was so bad that people coming into the house would comment on how depressed he seemed.
ADjeuxIiaa	Chihuahua mix. Cute puppy!|`|AxaspNJJaa	chihuahua. Or a chihuahua mix.
Kj8Ie77waa	This is serious. You have to be very careful with such a dog. If he were to actually bite someone, you could be sued, or he could be taken away and put to sleep. <br>  <br>  I would highly suggest getting the help of a trainer or behaviorist right away. Dealing with agression is something that needs to be done carefully, and you can easily make it worse, so please get professional help. <br>  <br>  Try to get a positive reinforcement trainer, not someone who likes things like "alpha rolls".  This just makes things worse and makes the dog scared of you. You want a good trainer, not a foceful instigater.<br>  <br>  good luck.|`|p7swtBYzaa	He needs to be socialized.   Best would be to enroll in group obedience classes with him, this will teach you how to train and control him and help socialize him with other dogs and new people.<br>  <br>  Ask your vet for a reference to a good trainer who gives group obedience classes.   You and your dog will enjoy it and it really helps - I've taken two of my dogs and it really improved their behavior.|`|26PPwzrWaa	A chi/terrier mix? Tell him no. <br>  Do you know about dog behavior? <br>  <a href="http://www.flyingdogpress.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.flyingdogpress.com</a>|`|dW3HSba3aa	Put him in like an obedience class or walk him a lot and tell him no|`|hfZSILMNaa	mix him as much as possible with other people an dogs :0)
o93EwErKaa	The gestation period is approximately 63 days.  I feed the same high quality food I always feed during season.  At about 3 or 4 weeks, I switch to a high quality puppy food (no corn, no soy, no wheat, no by-products and a named meat in meal form as the first ingredient).  She is allowed to eat all she wants of the dry food.  The puppy food is continued until the puppies are weaned.  I also may give "treats" 2 or 3 times a week to include boiled white skinless chicken, cottage cheese or very small amounts of liver.  Be limited on the liver as some believe the high Vitamin A content may be the cause of cleft palates.<br>  <br>  Calcium should never be supplemented because it can actually cause eclampsia (low blood calcium) when the dog starts lactation.  I do give a small amount of vanilla ice cream when she has her first contraction.  The calcium in the ice cream strengthen her contractions and the sugar gives her an extra boost of energy.  I have also heard of giving Tums for the same reason, but have always just used the ice cream.|`|5rfnEQnGaa	NEVER feed extra calcium before she starts to whelp. Get the book "How to breed your own showdog" and see link below for information on breeding.|`|M3jRtq2Aaa	Dog's gestation is nine weeks which is 63 days.  It is easier to count by weeks, but if you prefer days it is the same amount.<br>  Feed a pregnant dog puppy food.  Extra calcium such as cheese, yogurt, milk can be fed to a mother dog anytime.  Extra supplements should be only be used if approved by your vet.<br>  There is a condition that lactating momma dogs can have called milk fever or hypocalcemia.  That is when extra calcium must be given by injection (by vet) to prevent death. People add calcium to the diet to help prevent it in the form of calcium rich foods like yogurt, cheese, cottage cheese, milk, etc.<br>  <br>  Another good idea is to use some form of milk replacer like biolac, maternalac, ebsimilac, etc, over Mom's food while she is pregnant and lactating.|`|CcESWX5vaa	heres a link that might help <a href="http://www.petcaretips.net/dog_breeding_pregnancy_birthing.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.petcaretips.net/dog_breeding_...</a>  59 to 65 days is the gestation period i give my female just born powder its for puppies but good for mom  mixed in her food for calcium i start her on it as soon as she whelps till puppies are weaned|`|Z9zzNYNCaa	Approximately (note-AVERAGE)NINE WEEKS.>for the math-impared,what's nine times SEVEN??<br>  NONE!

W7WganJ4aa	Dog Conformation refers to how close the dog conforms to the breed standard for that breed.  That can mean both "does he look and move like an x-hound" and "does he seem sound".  "Sound" can vary from breed to breed, but "seem sound" could mean things like does he have all of his teeth or is he missing some or other health or structure type things that are common to a lot of breeds.<br>  <br>  The best test for conformation is having multiple people very knowledgable in the breed look at him and judge his conformation.  Most people do this through conformation shows and whether the dog can get his championship.<br>  <br>  In my opinion, all the titles that the dog's ancestors have are important.  I would like to see conformation championships, obedience titles, and agility titles. Special breed titles like earthdog for terriers and herding for herding dogs are very important to me to help me to see if the dog can do as well as he looks.  Alternatively knowing that some or all of the dogs are from real working lines (Border Collies that have been herding all their lives or working terriers) replaces and surpasses the need for those titles.<br>  <br>  I would expect that the vast majority of the dogs on the pedigree would be champions and that the parents would be champions.  If the parents were not champions I'd want proof that they have been evauated by enough people who really know the breed as show quality, NOT just the owner.|`|2be14aaeddfaa187fb19a7f9392bf657aa	Conformation refers to how the dog is built. The better built the dog the less likely it wil lbe to have joint muscle injury due to poor movement. A dog must conform to it's breed standard in order ot be considered for a breeding program.<br>  In order to evaluate a dog for correct conformation  you either need to show it and get points/champion or have it evaluated by at the very least 3 unbiased breed knowledgable people/judges (the dogs breeder does not count)<br>  OFA and or PennHip, DNA on males, ch. and or working titles..you also need to research it careful for color purity in breeds where color is part of the standard and for longevity.<br>  <br>  While championships are important there is no exact amount that should be present on a pedigree..more importantly should be health, longevity, temperament, breed standard.|`|Z9zzNYNCaa	"CONFORMING" to the breed standard!<br>  In ALL traits!<br>  <br>  Experienced dog-people can quickly & easily see- & feel-quality from crap,w/disqualifications considered first.<br>  <br>  TITLES are important in pedigrees-conformation & performance.<br>  <br>  A dog worth considering-let alone using-should have at least 75% red-ink!

oHKpy4IRaa	There is hope still! This is what happened to my dog (I have a lab/shepherd/pitbull mix) She kept on doing the same thing that your dog was doing and on top of that she wasn't potty trained. My dad said he was going to give her awa (He would have if I didn't do anything about it). Train her like the worl is coming to an end. Train her every day. Tell our parents to give you a chance to train her. If she tars up stuff you can spray this stuff on what she likes to bite and when she bites it, it will taste bad to her (you can buy this stuff at our local pet supply store.)

Get a part-time job and say you will pay for her food and help towards her vet bills. <br>  <br>  At the end of the day, its your parents house and their rules so it is down to them. But you can try and change their minds by being as responsible and thoughtful and mature as possible.<br>  <br>  EDIT: Now I know the reason, I can give better advice. I say sit them down and tell them how much she means to you. Promise them (and make sure it's wholehearted promise), you will try your very best to keep training her. Ask if you can take her to a dog behaviourist - they're professionals in dealing with dogs that have training problems. Tell them you will help pay for it yourself if you have to by getting a part-time job. Say you're prepared to take responsibility and will keep her from hurting your siblings. Unless she's being aggressive - and in that case I would totally understand if your parents wanted to get rid of her - then I think this problem can be sorted out. Good luck.|`|MeODfbWJaa	You didnt say WHY your parents wanted to send your dog to a new home.  Is the dog aggressive?  Is it a house-broken problem, still messing in the house?  Is it a financial problem.. money needs to be spend on children and not enough to care for the animal appropriately?<br>  <br>  Have you taken over the responsibility of the care, training (actual obedience classes), and feeding of this dog?  Or are you leaving it up to your parents to do all the work.  <br>  <br>  Parents dont usually just get rid of a dog... there has to be a specific reason.  find out the REAL reason, and figure out a solution to the problem, whether it be making sure this dog is well-trained and obedient, has been properly house-broken, or if it's financial.. get a part-time job to help pay for medical care, shots and food.  <br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|CGmWbDuAaa	Talk it out with your parents, tell them how you feel.

280d96ad7b5e9ffad03a34a66cac5db0aa	Out of curiosity, what do you do when he freaks out? If you try to soothe him by sweet-talking, petting or cuddling, you're reinforcing his behavior. We've taught dogs to perceive petting and a happy voice as praise, so when you're trying to comfort him, you're only praising him. You're telling him, "Yes, good boy, that's a nasty shadow, be afraid, that's right!" When a dog is frightened, the best thing to do is to ignore him or, better yet, snap him out of the behavior before it escalates into a panic. If he's starting to get a little nervous, poke him to get his attention, try to get him to play fetch or tug, do a round of obedience tricks, do whatever you think might work. <br>  <br>  You know the triggers that set him off. That's great, because you can work to fix the problems that you've identified. Do you know what clicker training is? <br>  <a href="http://www.clickertraining.com/whatis" rel="nofollow">http://www.clickertraining.com/whatis</a> (Explore the links, too!)<br>  You can have a clicker and a bowl of treats with you everywhere in the house so that you will always be prepared. Begin with noises, for instance. Find a high-quality clip of a noise that scares him, maybe fireworks or a car, I don't know his triggers. Begin by playing that sound at a very, very, very low volume. Does he respond? If he doesn't care, click and treat! Repeat several times. Then increase the volume one notch, and keep repeating the process. Eventually, you should be able to work up to the noise being very loud. You absolutely must remember to go at his pace, though. You cannot increase the criteria until he is 110% comfortable with the current step, and remember to keep each step very, very small. You can't jump from volume 1 to volume 4. Baby steps! By doing this with things that frighten him, you can form positive associations (hearing this noise = tons of yummy treats = good noise!). You can do this with pretty much all of his phobias. For example, with the shadows, begin with tiny little shadows, a size he doesn't care about. In the same way, gradually work up to big, moving shadows.<br>  <br>  You can help calm a dog by using "calming signals." Yawning, looking away, blinking slowly - these are just a few examples of signals that dogs use to calm each other or themselves. <br>  <a href="http://www.diamondsintheruff.com/calmingsignals.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.diamondsintheruff.com/calming...</a><br>  Pay special attention to the paragraph about a puppy named Mee near the bottom!<br>  <br>  Anyway, back to your original question.. yes, there are definitely calming herbs. For starters, try rubbing lavender on his collar and keeping the scent in the house. While lavender isn't a miracle-worker, it's been scientifically found to have a calming effect on animals. (We're animals, too, remember!) For instance, babies with the scent of lavender in the room have been found to tend to sleep longer and fuss less than babies without.<br>  <br>  Try an herbal supplement called Rescue Remedy. I've never used it myself, but I know and trust several people who have with used it with success. It's a flower essence concoction that you mix into drinking water, I believe. <br>  <a href="http://www.preciouspets.org/newsletters/articles/bach.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.preciouspets.org/newsletters/...</a><br>  <br>  Finally, as someone mentioned, you should indeed look into using DAP products. DAP stands for Dog Appeasing Pheromone. It's a pheromone that mimics the pheromones produced by a nursing dam to calm her puppies. It's been found to have the same effect on adult dogs, too. You can buy DAP collars, DAP plug-ins and DAP sprays. I've also heard great results for DAP.|`|KxjUim7yaa	Get the room atomizer form of DAP spray.

NO online source is!  Instead, contact a rescue organization and ask them about reliable breeders.  You can google the breed and your state (rottweiler rescue, WV, for example).  Or contact the rottweiler breeders association - google "rottweiler breeders, WV" for example.  But go to see the puppy first, and ask to meet its parents.  Ask all the right questions, such as questions about health checkups, genetic disorder possibilities, who the parents are (and if you can meet them) where the dog is registered (only AKC has the real registry in the USA), and so on.  Ask the breeder how she chose the mate for her *****, what shots the puppies have already had, and so on.  Be sure to find out whether you get a copy of the puppy's medical records to take to your own vet.  Be sure the breeder will take the puppy back no matter how old it is if for any reason you can't keep it - and put that clause into the sales contract if it isn't there.<br>  <br>  Don't take the puppy home before it is 10 weeks old, because it needs that extra two months for its mom and litter mates to teach it bite inhibition.  <br>  <br>  Good luck!<br>  <br>  Apacapacas|`|F5vsY4rOaa	Call your local vet and see if they know of any breeders in your area you can also make breed specific requests from most ASPCA branches and with them your adoption fees often include puppy classes which are invaluable with rotties  the people up the road from me raise them but sorry they will not ship.

Puppies are sold at certain ages for a reason - they learn VITAL skills from their mother and siblings, such as how to accept a "telling off" from an older dog, how to interact with other pups etc. Take that away and you will need to do so much MORE training and socialising - thats if you dont end up with a dog with other dog issues.

Seriously,<br>  a healthy, well bread rottweiler puppy is going to cost at<br>  least $1,000. You are not likely to find a rottweiler puppy,<br>  that is less than 3 months old, readily available in an animal <br>  shelter. Those dogs are in high demand. Plus, you have to <br>  factor in, all of the veterinarian expenses. Your vet bills will <br>  likely total close to $500.00, just in the first 6 months. And<br>  you need about $200 - $300 in supplies, i.e. a crate, bowls,<br>  collar, leash, food, treats, etc. I would wait until you can <br>  spend the money necessary to get a healthy puppy, and<br>  meet the financial obligations to take care of the dog.
WzOjFS9Xaa	What I would do is wait a day or two and see if she comes back. Cats have a very good sense of direction and will usually return to where their source of food is. If she's not back by then, I would make some "missing kitten" fliers and post them around your neighborhood. If someone has seen her, they will let you know. Good luck. :)|`|0zriLTZXaa	Shake a bag of dry food and bang a can of canned food with a sppon. You cat will probably hungry. Call the cat by its name.

I really feel for you.<br>  <br>  Cats get scared when they get lost and they will hide even from their people.  Once they get pretty hungry, they get a little braver and may come out for you, so keep looking hard--this could take over 24 hours.  Do not leave out a food source for her unless you put it inside a humane trap (you can usually borrow one of these from the animal shelter).<br>  <br>  In the meantime, alert all your neighbors by knocking on doors or by hanging fliers.  Make sure you use a picture or at least describe any distinguishing marks.<br>  <br>  If she isn't back in 48 hours GO to your local animal shelter and look (don't just call, they get hundreds of animals a week and only you can identify your cat).  Bring them a picture and flier.  You may have to check there multiple times and be sure.  Be sure and ask how long they hold strays (they're required to by law, but the minimum time varies state-to-state) so that you know how often you need to check.<br>  <br>  All that said, I've had numerous scares, some lasting as long as 36 hours, and our kitties came back and I certainly hope yours will, too--but don't just assume she will, do the work.<br>  <br>  Once she's back, take her to a vet or shelter and have her microchipped as this is a cat's best chance of getting back to her owners if she gets lost.  By far.  Also, if she's over 3 mos of age and 3 lbs, it's time to get her spayed (it's safest and most beneficial to get this done when they are young).  Cats in heat will continually wander off.  If she's already 5-6 months old, it's possible she's out there getting preggo as I write this, so if she's not fixed yet, make an appointment as soon as you find her.

2junv2Z9aa	I probably go a little overboard- :) I have a 7 month old Maltese, whom I adopted after my first dog passed away. I am 21 years old and in college...I live with my boyfriend in an apartment. <br>  Dogs are VERY time consuming when they are young (or recently adopted)! I'm not sure how old your pup is- But they definitely take up a lot of time- :) It's well worth it though, once they grow up and know what behavior is acceptable and isn't acceptable it gets easier. <br>  Leaving your dog alone is okay. Are you kennel training your dog? Does he have free roam of the house? I personally would recommend kennel training the little guy...Most people (unless you are independently wealthy) have to work or go to school...That's just a fact of life.  <br>  I usually try to come home during lunch  (or any break I get depending on my commitments that day) to spend a little bit of time with my dog-  I try to take him to the dog park at least an hour every day (a half of an hour is even great!)- He definitely has a lot of energy he needs to get out after sitting in the house all day! When I have to run errands many times I find I can just bring him along- I'm lucky he's small- He enjoys the car rides- I also spend about 2 hours throughout the day training- (Not all at once but scattered throughout the day!) <br>  Because he's a Maltese (white with long hair) He needs A LOT of grooming- That takes about 45 mins but is something that HAS to happen everyday- <br>  The little things really do add up- I wouldn't feel too guilty about leaving your dog at home while you're working- If you know you're going to go out for a few hours just try to make time before and after to play with him or spend some special time with him. And give him a bone or a constructive outlet for his energy while you're gone- He'll be fine and happy to see you when you get back...<br>  My boyfriend helps sometimes with Louie, if I ask, but I prefer to do it myself. :)<br>  Good luck!!|`|4c2b4b3698607bc95dd331438404d7e8aa	Yes, this is a tough issue and I bet all working dog-owners struggle with this one every day. I know I do. That's partly why I got a second dog, to keep the first one (see avatar!) company, and it works - up to a point. Dogs are clingy creatures, unlike cats, and because they have a pack instinct, they want to be with their pack all the time. And you, if you train your dog correctly, are their pack leader. That's why they are so unhappy every single time they can't be with you.<br>  <br>  I say that the two-dog strategy works "up to a point" because although my two love each other (most of the time!) and play really well together, now I have TWO dogs who miss me ... aaargh!<br>  <br>  On the other hand, if nobody who worked had a dog, there would be millions more dogs worldwide having to be put down. Also, there are so many places apart from work where you need to go, where dogs are not allowed, like the vast majority of shops.<br>  <br>  So what is the answer? Like I said, getting a companion for your first dog can work, although it can also backfire if they don't get along. You need to do some research first and ask your breeder or the local shelter what type of dog would make a good companion for the first dog. For example, our dog trainer told me that you shouldn't have two females or two males, but then again, I've seen other owners with two dogs of the same sex (or more than two) and they get along fine. Depends on the dogs' "personality", I suppose.<br>  <br>  Second, you need to do everything you can to ensure your dog/s is/are mentally stimulated while you're out. They get bored easily and once they're bored, they cause mischief, or they just become miserable. There are lots of websites with tips on how to keep your dog amused - I'll post this, then have a look to see what I can find. I have a huge backyard and the dogs chase the birds a lot of the day - also I leave them treats buried around the yard to find during the day. And I leave the radio on, tuned to a "talk" station so they can hear human voices. (No idea if this helps them or not, I have to say!)<br>  <br>  Third, make sure you walk your dogs before and after work. Even if you just take them around the streets on the leash, that's better than nothing because they might meet other dogs to socialise, and also do the vital "lamp-post sniffing" that they all seem to need! A run in the park or at the beach, of course, is even better.<br>  <br>  Fourth, try not to feel guilty. Do your very best for your dog and give it lots of attention when you are able, but don't let it take over all your spare time! Good luck!|`|KxjUim7yaa	My dogs are 5. I feed twice a day and put them out 7 times a day for potty breaks or to just play.

My son proved to me that he was mature enough for his own animal by taking care of my cat and just helping out around the house you know picking up his room or clearing the table without being asked try that it worked on me before I even knew what he was shooting for I think he asked a friend how he had covinced his mom<br>  I hope you get your pup|`|rVskthkiaa	tell them that your friend just adopted a dog from the shelter and it saved his life because they almost put him to sleep and say that its good when they have a chance for a better life. also say that a dog or puppy would be good for your family that's what i said to my dad cause my friend had just adopted a puppy and i had been wanting one for a very long time and now i am getting one this summer :]|`|5zpp408Zaa	Tell them you would do everything. Do something to show that you would be really responsible. Show them you can get good grades and keep it that way even when you have a pet. That's what I did. I have 3 dogs and a horse. All of them are my responsibility and I got straight A's!|`|HHOVl5SYaa	Ask them why they really don't want a dog. Then convince them that they're wrong and maybe try to show them you are responsible enough to take care of him/her yourself, like doing extra chores or getting a job.|`|b033997f273bdfdbe4ff466e9e24277eaa	Volunteer at the animal shelter, babysit some friends/family's dogs; show them you are responsible and deserving of a dog.|`|V4ljwCE8aa	You should try to find something that will show that you have responsibility to take care of an animal.|`|xkzkCtrUaa	Listen..I know from my dad. If they dont want a dog its not happening.|`|NVg06Egwaa	This happened to me!!!  I absoleutly LOVE animals, especially dogs and since like age 3 I have been BEGGING my parents for a dog!!<br>  <br>  First, try to pin-point EXACTLY why it is that you aren't allowed to have a dog. <br>  <br>  It was sort of a age issue, money issue, space issue type thing for my family.  <br>  Here's what I did<br>  ~Age Issue: I was only 12 but I wanted to prove that I could be extremely responsible and care for a dog.  So I did things like caring for my neighbors' dogs, walking, feeding, and the biggest help was volunteering at an animal shelter. (Oh and btw, thank you SO much for seeking an adoptable dog!! I can't tell you how happy I am to hear that. It is heartbreaking how many animals go through shelters and die b/c of space issues).  So shelter wise, I HAD to have a parent come with me which came in quite handy. Not only did it show how I could care for a dog, but it made my mom feel terrible that all these homeless dogs were sitting there ALL alone. It was so powerful.<br>  <br>  ~Money Issue: I babysat nearly every day for 2 summers, all day long for three kids. I was lucky enough to have them come to my house and babysat them here. Although that wasn't enough alone, my parents had a sort of 'matching' deal. For every $15 I had, they would give $5. OR something like that. I strived for more jobs, ANYTHING. If you are not old enough to babysit, ask for jobs around your house, neighborhood, outside.  Dogs are def not cheap!<br>  <br>  ~Space Issue: We have a fairly small house, and with 7 family members, it wouldn't leave us too much room. So I opted for smaller dogs, searching every site possible.  I cut back on buying personal stuff also :)<br>  <br>  Here a few GREAT websites to get you started:<br>  1. www.Petfinder.com<br>  2. ASPCA.org<br>  3. <a href="http://www.adoptapet.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.adoptapet.com/</a><br>  <br>  Here is my own personal website, to help you get started:<br>  <a href="http://adoptiontheoption.webs.com/adoptablepets.htm" rel="nofollow">http://adoptiontheoption.webs.com/adopta...</a><br>  <br>  If you have any more questions, or any more ways I can help. PLEASE do not hesitate to email me. You are destined to have a dog, I can tell. All animal-lovers deserve a pet =)<br>  <br>  Good luck!!!  It can be a long process, but it's SO worth the wait!|`|fbS9I7jQaa	show them one of those sad adoption videos that would probably make me  sad and think more about adoption.good luck oh and if your going to do this. go on youtube and type in sad animal neglection video or somthing. hope this works, good luck!
nr5VfSguaa	You must stop when he pulls excessively. But besides that you must continue to walk him despite the difficulties and just that will improve his behavior.|`|lTsDwY9Paa	Get a Halti head collar. I walk both dogs on them and they're much easier to control.|`|CXgPkEPFaa	Everytime he pulls stop completely. Then he'll get all impatient, but the second he stops pulling start walking again. This works really good but you need alot of patience!! And make sure he stops pulling on his own (this can take a long time)<br>  good luck!|`|yLkSov8maa	Jerk the leash to correct your dog when he chases birds,barks at runners, and sniffing. Just keep walking also when he sniffs. To keep him by your side, whenever he is walking you change direction, this way he HAS to pay attention to you and this behaviour makes YOU ALPHA! Every so often on your walk stop abruptly and tell him to sit.<br>  I hope this helps:)<br>  <br>  I strongly disagree with special collars and stuff like that. They push aside the problem; they dont fix it! There is no point.|`|RIomvvZ0aa	i have the same problem. have my dog for 4 months and frustrated. i finally had the courage to let my dog loose at the dog park. there was only one other dog. she's so hyper that she played and played and ran soo much she wore herself out. i would never let her loose with alot of dogs because her hyperness creates havoc. a dog lead that goes over her nose or mouth should work. i still haven't bought one but will get one as soon as possible...|`|uMyMHDPDaa	Well some people may think this is bad but for a few weeks or until he or she stops,Use a chock chain because i have done this with my dog and he used to chases everything and pull.

I would recommend you get the book "Control Unleashed" by Leslie McDevitt.  Your dog is showing classic signs of reactivity and being over threshold.  This means, no matter what you do, your dog is too over stimulated to be able to listen to you.  You need to work him under threshold (like keeping him in your neighborhood for now if that's less stimulating for him).  <br>  Please don't resort to leash corrections, or punitive collars such as a choke or pinch collar.  They won't help you with your problem.  Work on your basic commands in the quiet of your home and slowly increase the amount of stimulus he is exposed to while continuing to ask for these commands.  Set him up for success.  If he explodes in any way, you have pushed too far and have to create more distance between you and the stimulus.  Leslie describes how to do this very well and gives you many fun things you can do to help your dog.  Good luck!|`|S8Tzx44paa	Whenever he goes ahead of you, stop walking and tug at his leash, then firmly say, "No!" The dog will start obeying you, but don't expect quick changes, especially if your dog is big. The sooner you start training your dog the sooner he will obey. YOU are the master, not the other way around, and your dog needs to know that.|`|qpXPJ1pLaa	Get a choke collar until the dog is trained or if youre going to be around other dogs, that usually works|`|rVskthkiaa	get a good leash and stop when your dog pulls and when he returns give him/her a treat and your dog will realize that it is good to stay at your pace
qgeI6Chxaa	The AKC doesn't support the pet store. If a dog is eligible for registration the AKC will grant it. That is not an endorsement of the breeder or a guarantee that the dog is good quality. Every single puppy sold in pet stores comes from puppy mills or other crappy breeders. Never, ever buy a pet shop dog.|`|0e51HkpHaa	puppy mill dogs are usually sold in pet stores|`|Rva0ocMOaa	Absolutely not! Any "purebred" dog can be registered with the AKC. It is a scam.|`|EeJMITyCaa	Heck no. Pet store pups are can be unhealthy and they ARE a nightmare to train. See, the pet stores and puppy mills they came from don't really let them out of the cages. So, the pups learn to potty on themselves in the crate (against their instincts). Meaning crate training wont work! Thats the only "weapon" you have against breeds like Yorkshire Terriers. Trust me, thats how I trained mine. If you can't crate train your dogs then I doubt a breed like a Yorkie will ever be fully house trained.|`|XagPxe7Faa	IF the breeder that supplied the puppies is using AKC legally, it is likely that they have not had a recent AKC inspection.|`|5rfnEQnGaa	NO REPUTABLE BREEDER would EVER submit their puppies to a pet shop to sell !<br>  <br>  That are from a puppy mill or byb|`|P2yRAWiJaa	AKC doesn't know where the pups come from when they are registered. They only know that someone had two purebred parents, had puppies and registered the litter.  AKC isn't "supporting" anyone or any breeder.<br>  <br>  Anybody can bring a puppy, registered or not, to a petstore.  They sell the pups to the store, the store in turn sells them to customers.  These pups have likely come from very bad breeders that didn't have health tests done, didn't title the parents and don't care where the pups end up.|`|P0Fjh59Eaa	The AKC is JUST a breed registry. certainly it is one of the more reputable registries, but they cannot keep track of EVERY dog in the US or where it ends up.<br>  <br>  All the AKC does is keep a detailed history of a dog's heritage.<br>  <br>  ANYONE can get an AKC registered dog and breed them together. just because a dog is registered AKC doesn't mean it's breed carefully, or healthy. and Pet Stores use this false since of security that comes along w/the title of "AKC" to make people think they are getting a healthy dog.<br>  <br>  There is not a responsible, reputable breeder on this planet that would EVER EVER EVER put their puppies in a pet store to be sold to any Tom, Dick or Harry that walked in off the street.<br>  <br>  Pet store puppies come from puppy mills PERIOD! consider the AMOUNT of puppies they sell a month, and the supply they would need to keep pups in their store. a responsible breeder could not do this. but a puppy mill can!<br>  <br>  DO NOT buy a dog from a pet store ever, it puts money in the pockets of the puppy millers. and pups from pet stores are usually very sick, and have tons of health issues that cost you thousands at the vet.<br>  <br>  please read this site it will answer ALL of your questions:<br>  <a href="http://hattrick-dals.home.att.net/10Reasons.html" rel="nofollow">http://hattrick-dals.home.att.net/10Reas...</a><br>  <br>  Edit:<br>  Norah- buying a pet store dog is not saving a life. it's supporting the cruel treatment and continued breeding of MORE animals. thus- destroying lives.|`|1prFATCBaa	In a word<br>  <br>  NO!!<br>  <br>  purchasing a puppy from a pet shop promotes puppy mills!<br>  <br>  They don't care if you bought it because you felt sorry for it, or it was cute, or to get it out of that horrible little dirty cage-- or any other reason<br>  <br>  All they care about is that they got your money<br>  <br>  The way to stop puppy mills is to NEVER BUY FROM PET SHOPS THAT SELL PUPPIES<br>  <br>  And that means NEVER buy ANYTHING-- dog food- fish- supplies- NOTHING!!!

Even some puppy mills still mange to get AKC registration.  AKC registration does not guarantee a healthy well-bred dog.  All pet store dogs are from puppy mills.

Or do they act tired if the pups look healthy you have probably found a good store so go ahead and fall in love with the little one yorkies are great little dogs|`|dHjvUkvLaa	Never buy a dog from a pet store.  You don't know what you're getting and if you have a problem, generally you are on your own.  If the dog is sick or has any negative condition, do not expect the store to make it right.
8584e0329fb17c662606d5a6a8650ee2aa	I think the thing to do is to make time for each individually.  It's not wrong to enjoy time alone with one of your pets.  Take Sasha for walks on her own now and then and leave Zackie at home.  Then make separate time for Zackie too - maybe for exercise or training.|`|26PPwzrWaa	No. <br>  <br>  Without the three dogs, they wouldnt know how to act like a dog.|`|ad9efc98eb0fbeeae6b6c4abfd63046caa	oh no i think only dogs are lonely dogs they need company like we do|`|kvHqnR5Haa	Part of the reason she may be acting so well-behaved is because she still misses her buddy (based on your previous question).  She may have calmed down from her inconsolable state, but may still be a bit depressed so maybe she is just not being herself.  As for the not barking while on a walk (the rain must have stopped!) she is probably a little nervous not to be with her buddy so she is very reserved. But no, it is not wrong to enjoy a little one-on-one time with each dog individually.|`|WWhYCAbSaa	My Toy Poodle is now more barky since we got our second dog, but no, I would never want her to be an only dog again, as she was so lonely when she was an only dog.<br>  <br>  Edit: I think your dogs is probably bored now.|`|9kTejB0uaa	Hum, so what happened to this poor dog who was missing her buddie like mad.  She obviously settled down just fine.<br>  <br>  I don't understand  ............... hahahaha!!|`|Mcf33eLbaa	I do at times.<br>  For example right now I have a wonderful FCR that has lung cancer and I am just keeping en eye on him so i can be aware of when the time comes to do the right thing.<br>  He is the alpha of my pack of 6.<br>  He has been a wonderful dog and companion, I do love him so.<br>  He has been many a fan favorite in the obedience ring taking many top 3 placements and always having fun doing it.<br>  But being a breeder and competitor I do train and put in time with all my dogs.<br>  Ra is 8, which is waaay too young to be crossing the Rainbow Bridge, and I have been here before losing a dog at a young age.<br>  All my guys clamor for my attention and play and work time which makes it so difficult to put in the time I want to with Ra knowing that he won`t be with me for long.<br>  So yeah, times like this I wish I could give all my guys to some one to watch for me while I say good bye to, in my eye`s, the worlds greatest gift to me, The Ra Dog.<br>  God bless you and keep you safe my friend, till we meet again.<br>  Good Luck and God Bless
AA11821009	I whole heartedly agree with the previous answer you received.  If she is in labor, and in distress she needs help.  Being a stray with no medical history to speak of is a problem.  Best advice is to take her to a vet NOW.
qgeI6Chxaa	It's a made up designer dog, not a breed. As for the rest of your questions, there's no way to know. Mixed breeds vary and could have traits of either parent breed. There's a very good chance that a Jug would be less healthy than a Pug because they are only bred by puppy mills and crappy backyard breeders.|`|Ei85kgfdaa	Its not a real breed. A mixed breed is a lottery of genetics. So you don't know what health or temperament will be like or anything else.<br>  <br>  If you want a pug, get a pug.|`|lTsDwY9Paa	A "jug" is a cross between a Pug and a Jack Russell.

Also, why are you in pet stores looking at dogs?|`|P2yRAWiJaa	What the hell is a "Jug"??? A pug mixed with ????...what?<br>  <br>  It's a mixed breed mutt.  It's made up by the back yard breeders and puppymillers that are out for a quick buck from naive' people.  There will be MORE health problems with most mixed breeds due to having the potential of inheriting both breeds genetic problems.  It could shed as much, less, or more than a pug.  <br>  <br>  Whatever it is, one thing is for sure - it's a full fledged MUTT.|`|Z9zzNYNCaa	MUTT/MONGREL w/a REALLY fing stupid lie stuck on it by crooks to SCAM THE SUCKERS!!!!<br>  Mutts can't be predictable for *ANY* trait,which is the whole point of purebred animals-they CAN!|`|5rfnEQnGaa	No such breed. <br>  <br>   Maybe the people who thought up this silly name needed a jug to use with  their teacups?|`|35xC3mqkaa	Made up by pet stores.

No offense but I have been riding for 2 years, and I am more experienced then you are.<br>  <br>  Edit-I said you should be better then you are for 8 years, I didn't say you aren't good.

He's very cute! Best of luck to you in the future!|`|PYqJtRQnaa	Over all I think you look pretty good. I have a background with Dressage competing at state level in level 1 dressage. I would say that your heels need to be down a bit more to keep you better centered in your saddle. Also if you hold your hands up a bit more and hold them like ice cream cones you will have better contact with his mouth and he should drop his head more. When you are jumping you need to have a crest release bring your hands slightly foreword as he jumps so that you are not pulling on his mouth. If you pull on his mouth while he jumps then he could start refusing cause it hurts. Keep up the good work. You have a great start.|`|Y12dZVLjaa	i think u guys look amazing just slow him down a bit before the jumpxx<br>  your position is great and you seem realy balanced, all i would pick up on is to lean further forward coming up on the jump otherwise u will get left behindxx<br>  love ur horse he is gorgeouse im so jelouse lolxx|`|gaUvKebFaa	Pretty horse. He kinda looks like clayton,the barrel racer.<br>  Very pretty :]<br>  I added you on youtube.|`|qi79aIkOaa	Which one is the horse the horse or the other things.

I bet western helped a lot. <br>  You have a very cute pony in your hands. He is a great jumper. He doesn't rush it or try to chip the jump. He lifts his knees very well and many jumper horse fly their tail up while they are in the air. That's what he did! Good job on his part. <br>  You looked great on him. Your heels were not down all the way in the beginning of the video though, BUT got much better through out the ride. You need to lift your hands up more toward hid neck and follow with your hips more.  Find you center of balence more. You need to follow with your body and not bounce in the saddle too much. When he canters you sometimes go up and down in the saddle and it will <br>  Your pony a bad back if you do that too much. You have a good leg on him. When you go over poles you start off great. You don't look at it and you don't lean forward and get ready for it too soon. GREAT WORK! But when he hops over the pole you get left behind and smack him in the back. So when he jumps it to land on the saddle too soon. Wait until his back feet touch the ground before you land in the saddle. Same with the jumping. You don't need to land soon. Just wait. Your take off was good. I loved it. You waited for it and didn't get ahead of your pony. One more thing when jumping. Keep your heels down! All the way. You will have more balence with your horse. Cause that;s what you need when jumping. To find that center of balence. <br>  But good work and keep it up. You are doing really well!!!!!!

d6kekKgeaa	the hard part is getting them to stop breeding. just put the boy and girl together for a couple days, then seporate so you don't have to do  it after birth. you'll need a couple cages, sause as soon as you can tell if the babies are boys/girs and theire eatting solids and using the water bottle, it's time to seporate them, or they will "breed like bunnies"|`|lT3Aqt1Caa	breeding mice is pretty easy, although it does cost a bit to start you will need several cages to keep them seperated or they wont stop breeding but it did save me money in long run, but i also have 4 lizards and 2 smakes that are on a mouse diet. if all you have is the one snake you are probally better off just buying from the store. hope this helps.|`|B8je4n5vaa	kinda, well the hard part is getting them to stop breeding. just put the boy and girl together for a couple days, then seporate so you don't have to do it after birth. you'll need a couple cages, sause as soon as you can tell if the babies are boys/girls and theire eatting solids and using the water bottle, it's time to seporate them, or they will "breed like bunnies|`|McnuekTBaa	Breeding mice is easy.<br>  Putting up with the smell, not easy.|`|kVcRIHglaa	i think its hard to breed mice|`|jzASWplfaa	trust me, you dont want to breed your own. once you put a female and male together the babies come by the millions!!!  i got a male and female hamster, but i thought i got two females, and.....lots of babies!!!!<br>  <br>  it is actually a lot of work to care for that many mice.. you have to buy food, bedding, a cage, water bottle, it is a lot more money to breed your own mice, and it is also a lot more work<br>  <br>  your better off just buying them

She showed a couple of her dogs to their championship to look more reputable, but she is a big time byb. She has at most, 5 champions and only 2 currently showing but is breeding 26 dogs with plans to add more females in the near future. She makes NO mention of health testing for any of her dogs which means she most likely is not testing them. I looked at the pedigree for "Hope and Faith" and saw some big red flags: the sire, dam, grand sires, and grand dams (with one exception) all came from this kennel and only one of them was a champion (the dog not from this kennel). It is not unusual to have one dog of a breeding not be a champion, but breeding two non-champions should be a fairly rare occurrence in any kennel. For her to have done so many consecutive non-champion/non-champion breedings is concerning. I checked out the "available" section and was disgusted by the crystal collar/necklace her puppies were wearing. It's not as if there aren't enough people who see such small dogs as dolls or toys, why is she encouraging it?|`|AA12196139	Please be careful.<br>  <br>  You should contact several other breeders and ask lots of questions.<br>  <br>  Also, ask for references from people that bought dogs from them in the past and then contact those people and ask how their experience was with that breeder.<br>  <br>  I noticed lots of Chihuahua breeders on this site: <a href="http://www.pets4you.com/chihuahua.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.pets4you.com/chihuahua.html</a>  <br>  <br>  Good Luck and please be careful.|`|QLopvWKDaa	Check with the American Kennel Club website for a list of breeders- they will be expensive, however, they usually have a few pups that are "pet Quality", which are cheaper with a promise that you will not breed or show them.

Breeders have costs invested in their programs that they have to try to cover by what they charge for the pups they place.

b3b3292f0a82969ceed4f00b38611bccaa	I think it's a good idea to err on the cautious side and give the fluids. It's pretty standard at vet hospitals. Not only does it flush the organs during anestesia it also helps the cat recover far far quicker from the after effects. <br>  <br>  It's true that many clinics/vets don't offer it... but that's because clients (like your BF)  think they are trying to scam them... when really they are only looking out for the cat's delicate kidneys and other vital organs. Furthermore, most pet parents are either cheap and want to spend the least money possible... or they just don't understand the benefits so they immeadiatly assume the vet is trying to jack them. <br>  <br>  I always REQUEST fluids during any procedure that needs the cat to be under for so that they recover quicker will less after effects.|`|oDVx7nSxaa	I've never had that done during a cat neuter - a dental for an older cat, or any procedure for a kidney-compromised cat, yes, but not a neuter for a young male.  They are under anesthesia for like 2 minutes - it's that simple of a procedure!  I've had dozens and dozens of male cats neutered, and only had one who needed fluids *after* the neuter as he had trouble coming out from the anesthesia.  <br>  <br>  Not all vets are scammers, but this does sound a bit excessive to me.|`|ArBOK95aaa	there is a huge difference between scam and being overly cautious.<br>  <br>  Scam, he charges you for fluids, but does not give them.<br>  <br>  overly cautious, he gives the fluids.<br>  <br>  i've observed many a cat neuter, and I haven't seen it done.  Does that mean it is wrong to do, not necessarily.|`|xHxKDQ80aa	My vet did it for my tiny male, but he did not charge me for it. It is good to be on the cautious side.<br>  <br>  Some vets do take you for all the money you have and some don't care enough. If you don't have the money, then they won't even give you proper advice.<br>  <br>  I am sure you could have asked for the IV fluids not to be done and signed a sheet stating so. Most vets are good about telling you their procedures as long as you ask.
nlRr07dRaa	same way it'a harder to breath at a higher atmospheric level. your body is just not used to it.. it's just not equal to where the fish is originated from.  if you've lived at sealevel all your life, and you went to the top of MACHU PICHU you'd probably die without the proper acclimation. same with the fish I have a fresh water eel that I purchased 4 years ago, he is now in a saltwater tank, slowly over the years I've acclimated his water a little more salt at a time to get him acclimated for the saltwater and he's happy as a goat!

iasOicRjaa	Use a 50/50 white vinegar and water solution to neutralize urine. The trick is to pour the solution on and soak until soppy wet then soak up as much as you can with a towel. Do this 2-3 times and thin do a final soak with plain water and lift as much as you can out. Then let it air dry. the vinegar will breakdown and neutralize the urine.

Bleach kills everything, but the important issue really is, can you find the area where it is coming from. I had a strong Tom odour in my room and cleaned the floors and everything I could possibly think of. One spot behind a cabinet was the cause of this foul stench in the air. The only way you can remove urine smell is to 'hit the spot'. If it is in your carpets, you may have had it, depending on how stained the carpets are. With animals weeing in the house, if one is unable to stay on top of it, you will have to change the flooring or the wall paper, depending what type of animal you got. If you want to use a natural product, lemon is the only thing that takes away the urine smell. You can dilute with washing up liquid and add a few drops of bleach and as many lemons as you consider necessary. None of the commercial remedies you purchase will suffice. Ceramic Tiles, the urine stains the joints, same with wooden flooring. Hard work, on your knees and a strong brush, scrubbing and scrubbing. Dogs are a little easier in that you can use a mop. I use professional stuff, but always add a tablet of bleach and a spoonful of powdered disinfectant. If you are quick to spot the problem, you can just wipe the area.|`|rVskthkiaa	you can find the pet odor removers in target or petsmart they get rid of all urine odors

GMvzUYbSaa	Well, I have two dwarf hamsters. They are very tame, but it took me a long time to get them that way. You can't get just one. If you get just one, it will be crazy lonely, and it will be 400x meaner. If you can't get two, don't get any. But if you do decide to get them, make sure you hold them every day. I sat in the bathtub with mine (MAKE SURE ITS DRY!) and so that way I could hold them, but if they escaped they couldn't get out. But they tend to crawl under you, so be careful!

il0uOmG3aa	alright i had the same problem a couple months ago. the salt is okay but ur best bet is to go buy fungus treatment for fish which you can find at any petco or petsmart or even the place where u got ur fish. this will  heal ich and many other fungus problems fish can get that is wut i did and it cleared up in a couple days and heaters are not needed for goldfish. hope this helped
w4DIPHf1aa	It does but it's not the easist or the option which creates the least amount of stress or directly solves the problem the quickest.<br>  <br>  A liquid ick med is the best way to go.|`|yZAcwN3haa	No, it actually just helps a fish heal and kept stress free.It also helps for proper gill function.Use ick tablets or ick drops and read the directions.<br>  <br>  So use the ick medicine first,then you can add some salt in the process.|`|H0fXySX9aa	gradually increase the tanks temperature to 80 degrees F.<br>  * add salt to a solution of 3 teaspoons per gallon (in increments of 1 tsp per gallon every 12 hours).<br>  * keep the tank in darkness by switching the light off and covering it with cloth or paper.<br>  <br>  The theory behind how this treatment works is this:<br>  <br>  * Increasing the temperature to 80 degrees F speeds up the ich lifecycle to a few days and therefore speeds up the rate at which the tomites are killed off by the salt. It also boosts the fish?s immune system, helping it to fight off the disease.<br>  * The salt raises the salinity of the water to a level beyond the the tomites osmoregulatory tolerance, causing them to burst. Also, the increased salinity stimulates the fish to produce a slightly thicker slime coat, helping to prevent re-infection and secondary infections.<br>  * Ciliated protozoans cannot find new hosts easily in darkness and therefore more of the tomites die before they can latch on to the fish.|`|7erjLpuWaa	Well, many hobbyists treat ich with salt in addition to heat in their tropical tanks.  The heat eventually has to be elevated to 85*, and your goldfish is not going to tolerate that well.  So, I don't recommend the heat/salt technique for your goldie.  Good luck.
bIynPnyGaa	uhm monkeys with disabilities is what a rescue/rehabilitating zoo is for.<br>  you need to get degrees and be licensed to own a monkey in the U.S.<br>  it not like old times where you can just go pick out a monkey.<br>  <br>  <br>  heres some steps you can take<br>  <br>  Contact your local Wildlife and Fisheries department to get a list of rules and restrictions on monkey ownership. Monkeys are considered wild animals, and so are highly regulated in most states and counties. <br>  Step2Call or write your city fire department and ask about city requirements for exotic animals. Even if your state allows monkey ownership, your city or county may not. <br>  Step3Refrain from purchasing a monkey if you live in California. California will not allow you to own a pet monkey. <br>  Step4Visit the Monkey Maddness website to get an idea of the primate laws in your state (see Resources below). Just click on your state to read the statutes they have gathered. Remember that this information may be out of date. <br>  <br>  <br>  but most likely you will have to work at a rescue/rehabilitating zoo and ask to rehabilitate one.<br>  mokeys require full time needs. they can be more needy then chilren and dangerouse.<br>  some are known to randomly attack. more in gorillas though.<br>  so dont do this because they are cute and you want to tell your friends hey i have a pet monkey.you basically wont be able to have a full time job if you have a pet monkey.|`|JGq9rKBOaa	<a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2009/02/26/garden/26primates.html?scp=2&sq=monkey&st=cse" rel="nofollow">http://www.nytimes.com/2009/02/26/garden...</a>|`|e0eb82b689e1db392eb51c89982ed115aa	books are not good since they can become outdated so fast.

oMmBhWK4aa	Be careful of plants that ignorant or unscrupulous retailers (even in fish shops) sell to unsuspecting customers as aquatic plants when they are not. Such plants will soon rot and die when submerged, and end up polluting your tank. One common example is the 'Peace Lily'. Only use true aquatic plants. If unsure, you can link photos for people in this forum to help identify.<br>  <br>  If you don't have physical stores near your location, you may just have to resort to on-line buying. Unless you know other aquarists in your neighbourhood who may be willing to give you plant cuttings to propagate. To disinfect plants, you can dip them in a light solution of potassium permanganate for a short while, rinse well with water before planting and remove any dead or dying leaves.|`|SOxdyWQOaa	not really those plants came from water|`|bDPVRtCNaa	I would be wary of plants sold in stores other than pet stores. They may have fertilizers unsafe for aquarium use.|`|KAX0HCfTaa	I'm guessing that your hardware store has equipment for ponds and along with equipment they sell pond plants. Also in the aquarium section at your mega mart you may be able to find similar plants.  There are various kinds but the ones that they probably sell are the bulbs of the plants.  It will grow over time so be patient with it, but I don't think they are that nice.  <br>  <br>  You also have another option of ordering them online from an online store of some kind where they have a large variety to choose from and can be at your home within a few days.|`|dJs2s9pfaa	The only thing I can think of is bamboo for a fish tank. Now if you were doing a pond I'd suggest Peace lilies some people add them to their Betta fish bowls.

peDwXmQJaa	If your using any kind of snaffle bit (O ring, D ring, full cheek) then DO NOT USE INDIRECT REINING this will only serve to confuse your horse, because that not the way they are meant to be used (they work on direct pressure on the corners of your horses mouth).<br>  <br>  I had a trainer who had me do this with my horses and it only made the problem worse. I have also seen other horses really messed up because riders used indirect pressure with snaffle.<br>  <br>  What worked really well for me was practicing circling onto the rail and keeping the horse bent that way. I also will to a lot of side passing onto and off the rail. <br>  <br>  You also want to make sure that when your asking for bend that you don't jerk on the horses mouth, or pull to hard because the horses Natural reaction to a jerk is to jerk back.<br>  <br>  You might also check your bit for sharp edges that might be making your horse uncomfortable, and you might try a different kind of bit, like some type of curb so you could use indirect pressure.|`|rbLdJ6Iiaa	if she ignores your leg completely, you can try using spurs. does she do that both directions? if she mainly does it in one direction then she could need to stretch out that side. try pulling her nose around completely facing to the inside of the arena, not just straight ahead, and use your leg to keep her on the rail (use spurs if needed). when she doesn't listen, tapping her (not hitting!) with a crop might make her realize she's being naughty. <br>  <br>  good luck! the circles against the wall is good advice too.|`|e8d7a36a9d51e627bb995817040e92a0aa	my old horse did that. what worked for me was bending her into a small circle up against the wall then walking, when she turned her nose out again, i would do the same thing. she's very smart and learned quickly, but she was a quirky horse, so that might not work for your horse<br>  <br>  good luck!|`|bx7qmKbGaa	Indirect reining is a MUST in this case.

IFEIP5Doaa	It is a pied white face cockatiel. A normal white face is completely grey except for the face being white, and a white strip down their wings.  A pied cockatiel can come in many morph colors, basicly it is a sploching of color that doesnt belong there, even including a few specks of white or yellow (depending on the morph) on top of its crown.

Trust me even if the new fish is bigger, the Oscar will always find a way to kill him. I know so because i have raised and bred them, and they are known to be heartless when it comes to their territory, otherwise they are great fish to own. Also make sure you have a comfortable tank for them otherwise they will develop disease and die way sooner than expected.|`|rrLHU6ehaa	No.  Not only do they need brackish water, about 1% salt, but are usually picked on by aggressive fish.<br>  You don't mention how many oscars you have, or the size of your tank, but the eel, which can grow to 2 feet long, needs at least 55 gallons, preferrably long, just by itself.  <br>  They do best in a species tank, if the tank is large enough.|`|aFslyRbMaa	here is a wabsite it will help you alot|`|IFEIP5Doaa	no this species of goby happens to be brackish water, over time it will die due to the correct salinity in the tank.

IFEIP5Doaa	Make sure it has a plenty large enough cage to hop about in, I would suggest at least 48" long, this way it has a space for sleeping, eating/drinking, a littler box if trained to use it, and to hop around. And rabbits do enjoy toys, check your small animal department at a local pet store for some toys. You can also try things like tp or pt rolls, balled up plain white sheets of paper, wooden toys with holes in it to stuff greens in. Or even hanging toys, like a kabob to hang greens and veggies from bcause they should have greens daily.<br>  <br>  just a note, if you ae not using a timothy based pellet only diet, I would switch to it, one they cant digest corn and they can choke on seed shells,but also alfalfa based pellets can cause kidney stones in the future, a timothy basde diet is not known to do that. And as much timothy hay daily as they want, rule of thumb is 1/4 a cup of pellet per 5# rabbit, the rest should be hays and greens, and even edible flowers like dandelions!|`|M9o5WpOqaa	Hi Shannon.<br>  Congrats on your new bunny!!I just adopted a sweet little male rabbit in Dec.and am having a ball with him! <br>  Sammy does get bored when he's in his cage so I keep a toybox filled with goodies for him to play with:kids plastic car keys,large baby blocks to chew on,empty oatmeal tubes,towel for digging/burrowing in,empty paper towel rolls,plastic cat balls w/bells,wooden bird toys w/bells (hung in his cage).<br>  When I let him out to exercise every day,he free roams the kitchen.I took a bunch of cardboard boxes and cut all kinds of holes and trapdoors in them and taped them together into this huge maze he likes to crawl thru.<br>  He also likes to play inside a large paper bag with a hole cut thru the top.I put a few pieces of spinach or broccoli inside the bag,and he hops right in.I laugh when his ears stick out thru the hole in the bag! <br>  He also likes to play 'tag' in the kitchen with my dogs.He chases them,they chase him...then when he's good and tired,he will snuggle up with them for an afternoon nap-what a sight that is!!!|`|KOiUG9Gcaa	i give my rabbit small cardboard boxes to play with...he chews them and it takes him quite awhile to get through them he also likes to toss them around i also give him washcloths he will take one and put it over his head...i don't know try one thing at a time and see what happens....rabbits are really funny they like to play with just about anything...|`|a5CEuWDxaa	If you have a garden thats great!

iW5cmYQPaa	Your tank is cloudy because it is going through an algae bloom, a first step in the tanks natural cycle. You will need to read up on properly cycling your tank before you bring any fish home.<br>  <a href="http://www.firsttankguide.net/cycle.php" rel="nofollow">http://www.firsttankguide.net/cycle.php</a><br>  "Water clearifier stuff" won't do you any good. <br>  Un-cycled tanks are the number one reason for dead fishes and failed aquariums. <br>  Good luck.|`|SOxdyWQOaa	do a 50% water change and put a new cart. in the filter it should clear up in 24 hours <br>  <br>  if not then your are feeding your fish to much <br>  <br>  <br>  18 years experience with fish|`|dJs2s9pfaa	Normally cloudy water would be caused by not rinsing your gravel well. This can only cleared up with water changes. Do no more than 50% this week. Then you need to permanently do 25% water changes since this is a requirement to keep your water clean and fish healthy. <br>  <br>  Between doing a 50% water change this week and your filter you will notice more clarity in your water. If not then replace your filter and make sure you are replacing it at least every 2-4 weeks anyways. Always add water conditioner to keep the chlorine,chloramines out of your water. <br>  <br>  In addition your fish need aquarium salt. You need at least 1 tbsp per 5 gallons as this will help them fight off bacteria and disease that may be introduced into the aquarium.|`|IFEIP5Doaa	It could e two reasons, there is something actually wrong with your water, or it is attempting to cycle itself. Did you put fish in it already? really you should let your tank cycle for 5-7 days before putting fish in it depending on your filter, adding fish in before can do 2 things, one produce NH3 because the lack of correct bacteria grown in it before the fish were introduced, or two thrown your tank into a whorl wind as it isnt done cycling, so it causes it to get cloudy. Instead of adding chemicals into your tank, which can make matters worse, go get your water tested at the pet store. If you have ammonia, or NH3, then get the Amquil brand of NH3 remover, which will take care of the ammonia also. Also do a water change, even if there isnt anything wrong with your water. Nothing big, just 10%, which should be done weekly if you have fish in it anyways, cloudy water looks ugly, but it isnt a bad thing all the time, let your tank finish its cycle.|`|BMri9tITaa	It's an ammonia bloom.  It's the first step in the nitrogen cycle.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.theaquariumwiki.com/Nitrogen_cycle" rel="nofollow">http://www.theaquariumwiki.com/Nitrogen_...</a><br>  <br>  Your water is extremely toxic to fish right now.  No fish can come out unharmed, but some (like bettas) will come out with some damage, a somewhat shortened lifespan, but will mostly look alright.<br>  <br>  You probably also filled the tank up to capacity right away.  Fish should be added slowly, over the course of weeks, to give the filter time to adapt.<br>  <br>  I would find a temporary home for all your fish until your cycle is complete.  A friend, or a local fish store, might be willing to hold them.|`|5RRMLzvzaa	That is a NORMAL phase of a new tank as it begins the nitrogen cycle.  Leave it be, and don't go adding anything else.  Changing the water could restart the cycle if you do it too often or too much water at a time.  Here's an article I like about tank cycling - it explains it all very well and in an easy-to-understand way :)<br>  <br>  www.bestfish.com/breakin.html|`|dE5fs9yzaa	Are there fish in it? Did you wash the gravel real good before putting it in? How about a filter? What else is in the tank? These questions will help us help you.|`|3Z7B0dcaaa	Nooo!

s76aC4G8aa	Remember it takes a year before any dog is 100% housebroken so be prepared for accidents up to 1 year old.  With that being said the best advice I can give is pick up a book on housebreaking, EVERY bookstore and pet store sell them and while you're there pick up ones on crate training, and obedience training using positive reinforcement.  That way you have a constant reference guide as the dog gets older.<br>  <br>  These are all things that should have been done the minute you decided to adopt a dog not after.<br>  <br>  These websites should get you started but I own many and have read many books on housebreaking, training, obedience training, positive reinforcement training, Pack leadership training, Dog language, dog tricks, day care, Weimaraners etc.  The better prepared you are the better off your puppy will be and the less mistakes you'll make along the way.  Read as much as you can because it's very easy to screw up a dog without even knowing it.<br>  <br>  Good luckj<br>  <br>  LATE ADD:  Please don't listen to Peachz, DO NOT shove a dogs face in their feces or piss, that's inhumane and cruel, it also reinforces the BAD behavior so the dog either 1. becomes too afraid to potty in front of you and makes housebreaking harder and 2. the dog is afraid to potty in front of you so he begins to HIDE his messes so they won't be found and lastly smacking the dog when you come home and find the dog crapped now makes the dog fear your homecoming.  See told you it was easy to screw up a dog.<br>  <br>  Remember dogs are born without flaws, we as humans have tons of flaws so if the dog makes a mistake it is OUR fault and not our dogs.  If the dog craps in the house then you weren't paying attention or you haven't taught him to toilet properly.|`|2qVcpkF3aa	It's illegal to sell a 6 week old animal. Where ever you go the puppy give it back until it's 8 weeks or older. If taken away too early it will have behavorial issues.  <br>  <br>  Before getting any kind of animal you need to do research. It takes soo much time and patience and a lot of training. For right now, since it might not have any of his shots, you're going to have to buy pee pads until he does get all of the shots. There's spray that you can buy that attractes the puppy to pee. Simple Solutions make it. Once he has the shots and is ok to be outside, that's when you start taking him outside to do his business. You have to be consistant on it and rewards when he does go outside or for right now on the pad. Good luck|`|KxH74NIHaa	yeah, listen to that bean girl.. she makes sense.!|`|cYmIMtGOaa	ok im traing my dog also just when he pees somewhere tell him no and show him where he is supposed to go and move the crap where its supposed to go like a news papper <br>  <br>  or if u want to house train take him out side more and praise him when he pottys out side but when ur puppy goes in the house tell him no shove his face at not in it and take her out side even though he/she allready went to the bathroom and make sure that you clean up his pee and poop because if he smells it there he will keep going there so that why if hes being newspaper trained you move the crap there
3O6CTb3saa	Hi the major problem with your kitty is that she was played with TOO aggressively as a baby and when growing up.  If a person doesn't want a cat to attack and be aggressive and dominant you never want to rough house with them roll them around having them scratch and bite you.  She has got to go back to square one.  When she first started to bite you or attack your ankles she should have been sprayed with a water bottle or swatted with a newspaper.  She sounds like she has turned into the demon cat which is not good.  You are not going to hurt her by spraying her or giving her a swat with a newspaper.  But the thing to remember is it has to be consistent discipline not just once in a while.  She needs to realize she is not the Alpha person in your household that you are.  Granted at first she will be totally surprised and might stay away for a day or two but she will eventually realize this is not the right behavior and it has to change if she doesn't want to get sprayed or swatted with a newspaper.  You have to be the one to take charge and be the aggressor now.  Do not play rough with her anymore as this just feeds into her behavior.  She must learn to be petted like normal cat and rough housing is out.  Some day if her behavior continues and she would scratch your eye or your dogs eye you or the dog might be blinded and letting the cat do such a thing is not allowed.  Cat scratches are so bad to get as they carry such bad bacterias and can make you very sick.  So please start showing this cat who is the boss in the house and it isn't her like she thinks.  Just to let you know a quick story I worked at a vet clinic for many years and one day when we were giving this cat an IV injection to go to sleep for surgery the cat came unglued turned and bit me with all 4 fangs deep as they would go into my arm and stuck every claw there was into my arm for a few seconds.  He finally let go but i was a mess, my arm swelled up 4 times the size in just seconds.  I was totally amazed at how fast it swelled.  The vet cleaned and cleaned on the arm and then sent me to ER where they cleaned some more and started me on IV and po antibiotics.  That arm was miserable for one whole month before it started to feel better.  Then the cat had grazed some nerves with her fangs and my arm was tingly and numb for months.  So please show this cat who is boss.  Good Luck!|`|dWed21jUaa	try feliway and lots of treats|`|OoPMqhrXaa	Hiya<br>  <br>  Sorry to hear about your kitty she clearly has some issues that need to be sorted. Although i think there is very little you can do to help her. Maybe your just going to have to suffer ignore her when shes bad and treat her when shes good. Try the water spray method. If she bites to hard spray her if she bites gently reward her.

7QDDI7TFaa	Beta fish eat sparsely.  Try feeding it only flakes if that's what it likes once a day.  put a temperature gage on the side of your fish tank.  Beta fish should be kept at about 76-78 degrees in their fish tank.

3uEHLGD4aa	Brushing boots - ideal for all horses to protect their legs from knocks and bangs in general riding. If your horse moves closely they are an absolute must.<br>  <br>  Over reach boots (also called bell boots) - go on the front feet to protect from over reach wounds. In my opinion, absolutely necessary when jumping or lunging and certainly advisable in every day work, especially if your horse is shod.<br>  <br>  Tendon boots - worn on the front legs, absolutely necessary when jumping to protect the tendons from damage should the horse cut into itself on landing (more common in deep going). Ideal because they are open fronted so the horse can still feel when it knocks a jump<br>  <br>  Fetlock boots - go with tendon boots, worn on the back legs. Protect the fetlocks from knocks when jumping. Only really any good when jumping - brushing boots provide better all round protection.<br>  <br>  Bandages - as brushing boots. Should only be used by experienced people as they can cause huge damage to tendons if applied too tightly.<br>  <br>  Splint boots - aim to protect the splint bones but DO NOT prevent splints!! (Common myth)<br>  <br>  Galloping boots - protect the legs from 'speedy cuts' - they are higher on the inside in order to protect the legs from damage when galloping (when the legs are raised higher and the horse is more likely to cut into itself).<br>  <br>  Knee boots - necessary when doing road work to protect the knees in the case of a fall. Ideal when travelling if you don't use extended travel boots.<br>  <br>  Hock boots - used mainly when travelling or in the stable to protect the hocks from scrapes and grazes.<br>  <br>  Travel boots - To protect legs when travelling. Extended ones cover the knees and hocks, not just the cannons/fetlocks etc.<br>  <br>  Turnout boots - come in various shapes and sizes, used to prevent damage to legs in turnout, some are designed to protect against mud fever.|`|qdtU1Q1Laa	Yes, you are correct, splint, galloping, and brushing boots are exactly the same thing and can all be used on all four legs. <br>  <br>  Since you know what bell/overreach boots and splint/galloping/brushing boots are-<br>  <br>  Open front also known as tendon boots are used by jumpers to protect and offer some support to horses while the open front allows the horse to notice that it hurts when they knock a rail. <br>  <br>  Fetlock boots are also most commonly used by jumpers. They're boots that go on the hind legs. <br>  <br>  Wraps are used for several things. Stable wraps are used for the obvious, while a horse is in a stall (people will use them after a horse has worked hard, like at a show). Polo wraps are most commonly used while schooling upper level dressage as they will offer some support and protection. Shipping wraps are used while transporting a horse; some people like them more than shipping boots as they believe that they offer more support during longer trips. <br>  <br>  Hock boots may be used on horses who tend to lean on their hocks while traveling in trailers. <br>  <br>  Knee boots are used while doing road work. <br>  <br>  Travel boots are used while traveling. The extend high up a horses legs and usually go all the way to the ground to protect a horse if he falls, is in an accident, etc.<br>  <br>  Turnout boots; there are several types of turnout boots. Most people who put turnout boots on their horses will just use galloping boots on all four and bell boots. Then you will also see (they're more common in the UK) boots that are specifically made for turnout use. Some of the models will keep the legs dry, mud free, and will offer some protection if the horse knocks his leg. <br>  <br>  Hope this helps!|`|GIPIjD2Oaa	my mums horse has shoe type things, they go around the hoof and cover the bottom of the hoof aswell. cant actually remember what they were for, he's had them so long, but it does look funny cos he lifts his feet up higher than without them on. and people always say 'look, that horse has shoes on' lol

The adult dog looks "regal"|`|XavY3fiWaa	Puppies are cool because they just like to be funny and fall everywhere and they trip alot, im laughing just thinking about it, they are just so funny.  And adult dogs are cool because they are out of the puppy stages so they don't chew everything (well most adult dogs don't chew everything, not the case with my dog).  You liking adult dogs better is you own opinon, everyone has their own opinion, i like adult dogs and puppies.|`|B462BQYzaa	it really depends on your point of view, of course you cant expect the entire world to be unanimous on something that's "opinionated" however the term puppies are cuter than adults is simply the majority of the population with this opinion and this actually applies to all animals including humans.  living things are born cute so it will trigger the instinct of those around them to protect and nurture them - it's actually a survivial trait.  One of the few animals that retains these traits till adult is the cat - their skull grows symmetrically while most other animals grows assymetrically - such as the dog, the snout may be longer at adult age, ears are different etc.|`|ivIQl6Awaa	big inquisitive eyes, dumb long legs too big for their bodies, mega-ears the their heads haven't grown into yet, doing hilarious things like tripping over sock they are pulling around, or noticing their own tail and barking at it...The list is endless Why puppies are so cute I think!!!|`|JNsyAxbXaa	Well, I personally think puppies are much cuter than adult dogs. This may be because all their features are much smaller. Small=Cute? Very possible. Also, puppies are clumsy and often trip over themselves, this is a very endearing sight. "Aww look at that poor baby, he just tripped over his ball!!".<br>  <br>  Puppies are curious about everything and it's a lot of fun to watch them experience new things like water for example. Take a puppy that's never seen a lake and watch him/her play in or avoid the wave's. They can look so confused or playful, it is simply adorable. Adult dogs just don't have that innocence.<br>  <br>  Puppies make cute little noises because they are young. Baby barks are really funny to hear, where as adults barking is just annoying.<br>  <br>  I hope that sort of clears up your question. I really think its just a matter or preference :). Some people are going to prefer adult dogs, like yourself ^ ^.|`|OqsLPqKiaa	well they're small and tiny.  not sheding yet and falls a sleep alot of times.

4gPVgysLaa	I would go ahead and let them loose as far away from the school as you can, and not take them on the bus. Just because you set them free close to the school doesn't necessarily mean they're gonna make a beeline right back there. And taking a mouse on the bus will ensure THAT particular mouse won't get back in the school, but the mice problem isn't going to end because you're letting the mice out too close to the school.

l42UDjFGaa	I think of it in 2 different ways. 1) A person who rode a lot as a kid, took a long break, and then came back to riding later in life, having to kind of start all over again.That's the most common way I use it and have heard it used by others. 2) A person that started out riding one discipline for years and years and then decided to completely switch directions, like from barrel racing to dressage (actually know an upper level instructor who started out running barrels for 15 years and then switched, very cool)...they feel like a greenie all over again because it's a completely different world than the one they know.|`|7cm4dZVaaa	It probably means different things to different people, like "green" does.  To me, it means someone who rode early in life, maybe into their 20s, then stopped for a number of years.  Now, as an older adult, they have taken up riding again.|`|IJoM4Q50aa	Possibly someone that has to do there event at a show over for some reason.|`|SzW9GmRsaa	Not one I've heard before!

IrdZKYT3aa	A filter is a must, but TopFin is a pretty reasonable company, you don't really need something too fancy.  Sounds like you have a ten gallon, but I'm not 100% on that.<br>  Here's were you have a choice, to get a heater or not.  ALL TROPICAL FISH NEED A HEATER.  With no heater I recomend a school of white cloud mountain minnow.  They need to be in a group, but don't need to be heated, they prefer cooler waters.  They're very striking, especially the longer finned variety.  I'd avoid goldfish as they are extremlly messy and you'll need excellent increased filtration to keep even one alone in the tank.  They need a lot of filtration and a lot of space.<br>  With a heater, about 15 bucks for a ten gallon heater, you've got a lot more options.<br>  I'd suggest fake plants, easir to keep and you won't need special lighting.<br>  As for placing avoid direct sun light.  And make sure whatever surface you use can support the ful weight of the aquarium.<br>  As for lighting, with just fish a simple light is fine, plants need a better lighting system.<br>  With pretty much all tropical fish tropical flakes are fine.  The minnow will eat these fine as well.<br>  Best of Luck!|`|pcvcMePXaa	Well FIrst a filter is everything EVERYTHING that cleans your tank and is most important besides the glass thats makes your tank, a good filter will cost about 50 dollars, i would suggest fake plants for a beginner and lighting i would suggest a fluorescent light and get some flake food like wardley. As for Fish let you tank run with water filter and heater for 2 weeks then add some fish id go with tetras swordtails mollies or danios all relatively cheap and nice fish|`|PXZ8jxiGaa	Tetras and Danios are perfect for beginners, and require only sub par filters, can have some artificial or live plants, but those are not necessary. They need average lighting, and nothing special, they also eat any major brand of flake and pellet food, and they don't need meat. They also are cheap, and friendly fish, Danios are also easy to breed so you can also try that if you want.|`|f8RBtCVAaa	ok sounds like your tank is a 29 gallon or 30 but anyway that is a nice size tank. u need a filter. it gives your fish oxygen, u will need a srubber for the algea and a vacume cleaner. pice would be about $100 light realy matters if u have live plants. but u need a light. no matter what to see the fish. food depends on what type of fish|`|bD7Yaatkaa	neon glow fish they are so cool they are fresh water you can put in a (block) of food that they eat when they are hungry and the block lasts for 10 days or you can buy flake food.they are really small and cheap like less than 2.00 so you can get a bunch they glow in the dark and <br>  they are sooo cool. and they are clean animals so maybe 4 times a year tops|`|0c5e60ce4b8fdd00c644bddf68b7f9caaa	Get books,more than one, you'll never get all of the information you need on forums like this.|`|ZJCbnlF3aa	**It sounds like a 26g tank based on the size calculations I added up**<br>  <br>  First of all, you need to get some gravel and add the water in there.  Plus, the water needs a filter, dechlorinator to eliminate harmful chemicals in tap water, and an air stone or bubbler. You should set the tank up without fish with all of this and whatever ornaments and plants you want for at least 24 hours, but 48 hours would be better, before getting the fish so beneficial chemicals can build up in the aquarium.<br>  <br>  A good filter is about 5-$20 depending on the brand and size. Your prob. looking at about a $15 for your tank.  Placing: It needs to be on a sturdy platform (desk, table, etc.) and would be best if its not in direct sunlight so algae doesnt form everywhere. The light isnt necessary but you need one so the fish won't jump out. And most fish just eat normal fish flakes.<br>  <br>  Now the best kind of fish in my opinion for beginners would be live bearers like guppies, mollies, or platies. these fish are very hardy, easy maintenance, and amazingly easy to care for. They usually cost between 1-$4 depending on how fancy the color you get. Plus, some bottom feeders would be smart.  Like some corydoras catfish which are around 2-$5.<br>  <br>  For your tank, a nice fish setup would be 5 corydoras, 5 guppies,5 platies, and 5 mollies.  All those fish get along and are great fish.<br>  <br>  **If those fish dont sound good heres a few others but DONT have more then 20-22 fish in your tank: Tetras, Danios, Barbs, Gouramis, and Khuli loaches.<br>  <br>  ><> Happy Fish Keeping <><|`|AtO3x9E3aa	A filter is a must with basically all fish yes fish can go with out a filter but believe me you will want one its hard to really clean that fish tank correctly so just save the money up to get one there pretty cheap. <br>  <br>  Heres a price for a filter: <a href="http://www.petco.com/product/106992/PETCO-Power-Filters.aspx" rel="nofollow">http://www.petco.com/product/106992/PETC...</a><br>  <br>  (you can probably find them cheaper then that)<br>  <br>  Um a tank hood is a good idea to keep the fish from jumping out of the tank and it does happen lmao. <br>  <br>  price is usually in the 30 - 40 dollar range depending on where you go. <br>  <br>  plants all u really need is fake plants and those range anywhere from 2-7 dollars usually. <br>  <br>  food: it all depends on what kind of fish you are getting and the size will all determine the price of the food. i payed 2 dollars for my fish food and its going to last me forever<br>  <br>  <br>  some good placed to go and pick up this equipment is walmart. Walmart has really cheap stuff. in fact today i went to go buy a new 5 gallon tank for my gold fish who was living in a fish bowl and i bought a 5 gallon set for 30 dollars with a hood and light, and tank, and food, and top the line filter. all for just 30 dollars. so go and check out their stuff. <br>  <br>  <br>  good luck on the new fish.|`|jvqFxXnYaa	hmm.. idk how big the tank is (i hate math)((plus im pretty dumb :B) but i know i had goldfish as my first fishes!( well really feeder fish :S) but goldfish are good first- time pets b/c they dont really need a lot of care. just normal pinch of food, clean once a week. for plants, you can get decrative ones, but ive used them before and they got algae on them, and it NEVER got out. If you want a fish that makes ur house look flashy, you can get a betta. WARNING- ONE BETTA PER TANK. ARE CHINESE FIGHTING FISH AND WILL KILL EACHOTHER!!! You can put bettas in vases, and the look flashy themselves. Ive sen bettas in vases w/ plants, (like flowers w/ roots in top of water so they can swim around) and they look REALLY attractive. or guppies. but are REALLY small. if no fish sounds good enough for you, get a hamster. I got 2 and they r sooo cute !!!!!|`|PVR0y9eOaa	hmmmm.... i have a beta fish they're really easy to take care of, but i think your tank may be to big go look at a local pet store and check out the cheaper fish that live together. there are some pretty ones out there!|`|fLUwsXBiaa	Well, I absolutely LOVE goldfish... always have, always will. There are many kinds, like comets, calico, other fancies, ect.<br>  I like to get fancy goldfish like my favorite is a Calico Fantail.<br>  <br>  My old goldfish (who died from a disease a couple months ago :( )<br>  He was a calico fantail. He would be blowing bubbles and like shaking (good kind of shaking. kinda like people jump when they are excited) and wait at the end of his bowl when I came home from school. I used to give him little pieces of Special K as a treat (haha) and we brought him to our kiddie pool to swim.<br>  <br>  They are adorable. <br>  <br>  Actually, I don't know much about filters. I had always had goldfish in bowls, which isn't good. Since my old fish died, today I got a little tank with a filter built in. My first tank with filter. I had to set it up, which was easy. It was $30 but not that big. I have to rinse two pieces of the filter once a month, replace this filter pad thing every 2 - 4 weeks. <br>  <br>  I got a kit where it was really simple to set up. For more info on filters, go to your pet store and ask the workers. Today when I asked, they were VERY friendly. <br>  <br>  So, whats next? Oh yay, plants.<br>  <br>  Ya know, I have never gotten really extreme with this whole fish keeping thing myself, but I know a lot about this stuff.  I mean, I get fake plants, but I haven't had live plants. You can go to your local pet store and see what freshwater plants they sell. Fake plants are easy. Just rinse them in warm waer before you put them in your tank, and NEVER use any soap for anything that goes in your aquarium.  The fake plants prices go from $1.00 - sometimes $11.99 and more.  Live plants, the prices vary.<br>  <br>  Next, Oh, placing. Well if you mean like where your tank can go? Well, keep them away from air conditioning sources, heating sources and direct sunlight. <br>  <br>  Light? Well, I don't really think they NEED light built in there aquarium. If you do have some built in lighting, make sure it is only plugged in for 10 - 11 hours a day. <br>  <br>  Last but not least............ food.<br>  <br>  Now, thats the simplest part! Just buy goldfish food and give them about a pinch of food twice a day. An overfed or starved goldfish is unhealthy and certainly unhappy.

1WmDOPGtaa	Furminator: <a href="http://www.furminator.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.furminator.com/</a>|`|C4jNmT32aa	I have a Husky that sheds all the time.  I use a Medium comb call the Furminator.  Petsmart has a kit that cost around $50 right now, it includes a Meduim Comb, Bathbrush, Microfiber cloth, Shampoo, and Conditioner.  Which is great because the Medium comb is around the same price to begin with.  You can't beat getting the other stuff at the same time for the same price.  BUT here's the website and it explains more, and shows pictures and a video too.  Enjoy.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.furminator.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.furminator.com/</a>
M7KT6NSCaa	Furminator deshedding tool works like magic! you can find it at petsmart|`|4JNyhT2gaa	I got a thing called a "FURMINATOR" at a pet store, looks sorta like a heavy duty "flea comb".  Works great but they aren't cheap.  Good luck
jzBzwBYaaa	I don't think she'll get sick. I brought my guinea pig outside today too! And I live in PA so there's not much of a temp change. Just make sure she's completely dry before you put her back in her cage. <br>  Have fun with your piggie! :)|`|Zgtv1mDzaa	I have a guinea pig and i always leave her outside in the summer and she loves it.. but i don't leave her out if the grass is wet or the ground is damp because they can pick up colds very easily..|`|6LPxzVsPaa	Guinea Pigs love the heat! Guinea Pig's original habitat is Africa. They have hot temperatures.<br>  <br>  Make sure there is grass on the ground, and that there is some shade it can go under.<br>  <br>  Best Regards, Erika (:|`|b6400b04a0e3413ba30570ad0aa8cd2baa	I let my bunny outside today and i live in PA and he was perfectly fine. As long as she wasn't out to long and you made sure she was dry. Keep an eye on her for a little while just to be safe though|`|Z9xy3Mwxaa	i think it would be better to wait till it at least 70 to let them out or they can get sick|`|EZxdAqEuaa	she'll be ok|`|3sB49YNnaa	It might be pushing the season a little.  Even when the air temperature is warm this time of year, the ground can still be a bit cool.  I wouldn't worry about her though.  Pigs which are cold don't act like they are having a good time!<br>  <br>  Here are some things to remember when you are having "lawn time" when it is warmer.  Make sure that she is in some sort of pen so that she doesn't run off.  Pigs are surprisingly fast even with their short little legs and they will make a bee line for the thorniest bush or whatever is the hardest place to get them out from under! :-).  If you are not with her continuously, you need to make sure that she is protected from predators, both 4 legged and winged.  You cannot turn your back for a second!  Finally, you need to be careful about sun and heat.  Make sure she has shade and water and be ready to take her in at the first sign that she is too hot.<br>  <br>  They do love their lawn time so have fun!|`|0nIwKd5Uaa	she should be alright. Just keep a close eye on her.
biwt6MH2aa	Poodle. Great dogs that is easy to train &nd love kids.|`|6qsocyK3aa	Staffordshire Bull Terrier - otherwise known as the "Nanny dog" and for good reason. They're one of only two breeds (I forget what the other is, maybe a labrador) that the KC says is extraordinarily good with children. They're short haired so shed very little and are highly tolorant of pain, playful, have a great sense of humour (they're basically just hairy clowns!), energetic, affectionate and very intelligent. I have one and let me assure you they are wonderful dogs. :) Oh and they're also medium sized. Very very sweet dogs.|`|DhE0rEWiaa	All dog shed, there is no such thing as a dog that dose not shed, pure breed or mix they all shed. <br>  <br>  Now there are those dogs that blow coat  but all dogs shed. You will just have to choose if the dog you want is a long coated breed or a shot hair breed they all shed..|`|Wt61EclRaa	My friend has a Portuguese Water Dog.  He is so gentle and calm and not that big.  They don't shed.  They do need trips to the groomers though if you want to keep the hair somewhat short.  He is a great dog and great with her kids,loves to play.  <a href="http://www.pwdca.org/" rel="nofollow">http://www.pwdca.org/</a>  You dont' have to have the same hair style that they show here.  She gets her dogs whole body clipped..she leaves the tip and his muzzle...but gets a more uniform cut.|`|jzASWplfaa	sorry to say but all dogs shed at least a little bit, unless you get a chinese crested, cuz they are like bald chihuahuas|`|Qb61mRVOaa	Yorkies and poodles only shed when brushed and are friendly with|`|M7KT6NSCaa	miniature Schnauzer or bizon frizza|`|oK5kVlrnaa	i have the perfect breeds for you! I would either choose a purebred poodle, or a chow/husky mix!! They are know not to shed and are very playful animals. <br>  <br>  I hope i helped a ton!
jzBzwBYaaa	If they're not too heavy in comparison to the dog's weight and size, I don't see why not. Just curious, but why?|`|0nIwKd5Uaa	We have a doggie back pack for our dog. We put a couple bottles of water in while on a walk. It seems to help the dog work out more energy. But an actual saddle not sure.|`|5sRWo47eaa	are you training it for DOGFIGHTS mr ? hmmm
XavY3fiWaa	I don't know if an iguana is too unusual, but we have one.  We had a chipmunk once, it was a baby chipmunk that one of our cats got, so we kept it for a while then released him, it was so cute because he didn't want to leave us.|`|kVcRIHglaa	ummm... i have a dog that eats plants and throws up after|`|9ifTY0ENaa	My dogs pretty weird!!<br>  <br>  Lol. Does a bearded dragon count as unusual?
pDKm9Wmgaa	If it was MILK chocolate, she will be fine. If it was dark chocolate, that is more worrisome. The darker the chocolate the more pure the theobromine is. Theobromine is the chemical that makes chocolate toxic to dogs. They cannot process it and it builds toxins very quickly in the system. Milk chocolate is very dilute with milk and sugar. Bakers chocolate is pure and the worst for dogs. Only a tiny amount will kill a dog.|`|eu6UQElYaa	If she only ate 1 she'll be fine.   Chocolate is poisonous to dogs but they need to eat a certain amount and 1 chocolate for a 28lb dog probably won't even make her sick let alone kill her.|`|MpTZjdLJaa	she isnt going to die<br>  my dog ate all my halloweed chocolate a few years back and hes still ok<br>  nothing happened to him|`|qioH81tiaa	<a href="http://ngm.nationalgeographic.com/2007/10/pets/chocolate-chart-interactive.html" rel="nofollow">http://ngm.nationalgeographic.com/2007/1...</a><br>  <br>  That is a great site that explains the effect of chocolate based on the dog's weight and the quality of chocolate consumed.<br>  <br>  If your dog starts having serious symptoms, there are emergency vets opened 24 hours a day.|`|Run7dyraaa	call a 24 hr. emergency vet. I don't think she'll die with just eating one. Give her some water, see if she drinks it. She should be ok. Watch her. Keep an eye on her. Make sure she is ok. And don't leave chocolate  around!|`|3xoEFFOKaa	jesus christ!! calm down a dog can eat a million of chocolate balls and they wont die! its not the end of the world!! ur dog will be fine!<br>  calm down i was about to call u.................wait never mind|`|mYRw8H99aa	There's probably some animal help website or place open that you could probably e-mail or call for help.  If it wasn't very much she'll probably be just fine.  Her stomach might be upset and she might have diarrhea or throw up.  But she should be okay.  Unless she's allergic.  Just be there for her.  And make sure she doesn't get any more!  If something else happens try to find somewhere to get answers and help!  There is probably somewhere open because once on a weekend my chocolate lab got very sick and we had to take him straight to the vet and it was on a weekend and some animal clinic was open, and they saved his life, and I'm glad they were open and saved him!!  But it wasn't because of chocolate, but the point is somewhere was open that saved him and it wasn't far away.  Just in case.  But your dog should be fine.  Just don't let her have any more and watch her!  I hope that helped you and made you feel a little better.|`|EwzM7EEaaa	Ok, well She most likely is NOT going to die. Chocolate only affects some dogs and it extremely rarely causes death.<br>  <br>  I have have a friends who's beagle's favorite food is chocolate, and oranges. they feed it to their dog regularly, however i wouldn't recommend it, there dog is quite overweight.<br>  <br>  But no, you dog is not going to die.|`|5a1c8253181a8adf5c06c0040d8f981eaa	First off, I've never seen or heard of a dog being allergic to chocolate.  So don't worry about that.<br>  <br>  One piece of chocolate, plus a cherry never killed any dog.  Not even the tiniest chihuahua!<br>  <br>  You don't need to contact your veterinarian.<br>  <br>  Here is a fun interactive website to help you learn more about chocolate and dogs:  <a href="http://ngm.nationalgeographic.com/2007/10/pets/chocolate-chart-interactive" rel="nofollow">http://ngm.nationalgeographic.com/2007/1...</a>|`|Wo0AWgYVaa	Calm down, dogs are not that fragile.  yes, chocolate is not good but a dog won't die because consuming one.<br>  <br>  To make you feel better, my dog just ate an advil the other day on the street.  By the time I got it out from its mouth, the capsule was punctured already.  And he is totally fine.<br>  <br>  Dogs are not that FRAGILE|`|uin3ffWDaa	calm down, she'lll be fine unless she has an allergic reaction. once my daughters chihuahua ate a whole bag of Hershey's kisses (this dog is like mcgyver when it comes to finding sweets) my daughter was like " oh no she's going to die!!" needless to say she was fine.|`|iNvGnl0Xaa	No the dog is not going to die unless they are allergic or some extreme case. I've had many a dog eat chocolate and most of the time did not even get sick. I did not feed them on purpose but just from growing up with dogs.|`|yVlYuxPVaa	It is okay!<br>  <br>  My lab jumped up on my friends table and ate 4 dozen Chocolate chip cookies. She was fine! <br>  <br>  Your dog will be okay!|`|Ict5JA4eaa	she'll be ok. she just may have an upset stomach and have the runs....|`|GIPIjD2Oaa	my alsation ate a bar of cholcoate on a couple of occassions, she was fine, its different for all dogs. just keep an eye on her and see if she acts funny. if you are really concerned then there will be a vet open somewhere. they do open for emergencys, just have one vet in there overnight so you can give surgeries near you a call and see if they do emergency checkups, all you do is turn up and they'll check your dog over or just give you advice over the phone.|`|9KeX8dsJaa	They just don't die simply like that.  It usually takes multiple cases of digestion to cause sever problems - like death.  I would still make an appointment with the vet for a checkup, with a small dog is can sometimes only take one digestion to cause problems.  Go Monday! or ASAP.|`|UW9Trvrpaa	Chocolate is slightly toxic to dogs. But, a little bit won't hurt. And don't worry. Your dog will not die from a small piece of chocolate. Just be more careful next time. Also, if in a few days, your dog acts weird in anyway, bring him or her to the vet.|`|VKhcWhubaa	If she didn't eat too much of it I'm sure she'll be okay =]<br>  my dog had some chocolate once, and she's alright <br>  but if she is allergic. then you might have to be concerned.<br>  I hope everything goes alright with her =]|`|GhrRQ4Xcaa	one easter my dog ate two chocolate bunnies, and he made it for a really long time. years actually. he just had mud butt (diarrhea) for a little while.  also my other dog ate an entire case of oreos and is still alive, she just got the runs,|`|oOU6XJOqaa	She may become sick and vomit. Odds are, if she only ate a small amount of chocolate, calm down b/c she will be fine. A dog has to eat 1/7 of its body weight in chocolate to suffer death.<br>  <br>  Hope this helps.|`|ed05ZIrsaa	She won't die! <br>  <br>  That wouldn't be enough to harm your dog. She might get an upset tummy or something. Chocolate now-a-days isn't pure enough to harm any animal, but I don't recommend feeding to your dog on a regular basis.|`|umInGNV5aa	ok stop panicing. relax. give her nothing but waer till moring. in the morning give her some dogfood and she should be fine. if you are still worrryed by morning, call the vet and ask about it.|`|qawYlIjkaa	NO not unless it was a huge amount i mean 5 pound Hershey bar my grandma used to feed her dog chocolate and it lived for 13 years your dog is fine dont worry :D she will be fine.|`|55N1AA7zaa	shuld be fine my staford bully ate a choc orange on boxing day and was fine just dont worry <br>  <br>  if u are then make it through it up but i wudnt worie cus it was only 1 neway|`|x8loZIvEaa	she should be fine. my cousins like 2 pound dog ate a chocolate bar and shes completely fine it happened years ago too anyways dont worry|`|O8LiCt19aa	this has happened to me and its okay because its not too much.  you don't need to see the vet. our 30 lb. basset ate a bite sized snickers 4 days ago he's fine.|`|JjS4ARPYaa	If it was just one peice, you should be fine, if she had a ton of it, be worried.|`|AaPyuC5faa	if she eats a little bit she wont die, so she wont die:)|`|gyMscuA1aa	no she will be fine but her #2 may be pretty bad|`|AA12006899	feed it more till it dies  then so u can put it out of its painfull misery then simply get  a new doggy
IrdZKYT3aa	A female will have a little white spot, like a granule, on her upper belly between her pectoral fins.<br>  As for making a bubble nest, females do occasionally do this, it;s not super common but not unheard of either.  Some females will even assist in retrieving the eggs when mating and maintaining the bubble nest.<br>  Best of Luck!|`|6faBN1OEaa	Its because she wants to breed. Shes exicted and she is getting ready.|`|OqsLPqKiaa	well I can help a bit.  First of all does it have a long tail.  Males have long tails.  They blow bubbles when they want to breed try putting a female with it, even if your fish is a female those two won't fight.  Only males fight but make sure the one you buy is pregnant and big.  If she's not big she will die.  Good Luck.
3YHZUuhyaa	I think a ferret would be perfect for you! they're quiet, they LOVE to run around and play whenever you get them out but if there's nothing to entertain them, they just fall asleep..lol They live to be around 8-10 (maybe longer if they're well taken care of). Make sure you get a young one that's not agressive. Some ferrets can be really mean but my 2 ferrets (i got them when they were less than a year) are the sweetest ferrets I've ever seen! The only time they bit me was when I first got them and they were just "play nipping." they weren't being mean. In petstores they're about $100 each.<br>  <br>  good luck!|`|XavY3fiWaa	Maybe a parrot, they love to be with you and you can teach them to talk, we have an african grey parrot that we found a few years ago and he talks and likes to sit on peoples shoulders, he is an awesome bird.|`|K0tpQoHRaa	well get a bird ,birds are very smart small animals wich some have the ablity to talk.like you i know the others are stupid and boring,birds love humans and dont mind attention.birds are very interesting pets and you will find that all of them are different and have their own personalities.very funny at times too.|`|nkqQh3aqaa	Well what about a chincilla? i know you can only peting and hold it but they are really soft and cool to look at...<br>  i would say a ferret but i personaly think they stick if you dont take care of them right.<br>  um...yeah <br>  if i think of more ill let you know|`|krsoVRszaa	Parrots ARE wonderful!!!!!!!!|`|Z0XR4F0vaa	rabbit, bird|`|7955ec36986076dc3013a66eaf3fd877aa	rabbit

CvbB4qv3aa	On the net adverts are for ￡500 and up.<br>  But please go to a good breeder, its the best way to ensure you get a good healthy pup and if there's any problems you can go back to them.<br>  <br>  Never get a pup from a pup farm, or any other bad conditions.|`|5RRMLzvzaa	It depends.  Getting a good quality one from a "real" breeder (AKC registers the dogs, shows them, etc) will cost more (you're paying for the quality - the dog will look and act as it should, and the fact that the breeder tests their dogs for genetic disorders.  Not a guarantee it won't have any, but they're trying to breed the healthiest dogs they can).  You can probably find a poorly bred one cheaper, but some people will still try to charge you hundreds for a bad quality husky, so be careful.  Additional less expensive sources are husky rescues (cheaper) and shelters.<br>  <br>  I found something that says a pet quality husky from a good breeder can range from $500-$800.  They cost far less from a back yard breeder or puppy mill, but don't come with any health guarantees, and might not look at all as a husky should.  <br>  <br>  Info on pros and cons of this breed:<br>  <a href="http://www.siberianhusky.8m.com/sibeinfo.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.siberianhusky.8m.com/sibeinfo...</a><br>  <br>  This is the national Siberian Husky rescue group:<br>  <a href="http://www.siberianrescue.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.siberianrescue.com/</a>|`|jzASWplfaa	depends, on the breeder  if you get one from a shelter they can be only a couple hundred dollars <br>  <br>  if you live somewhere hot then dont get one...they dont need to suffer in the heat with their thick coats|`|31C0WsR2aa	normally they cost around $450-$1,000.

hoOygDw1aa	LOL- Zelda, those are not your rabbits to begin with. I know for a fact that the second picture is property of Three Little Ladies Rabbitry in Michigan. Secondly, they breed Jersey Woolies and Holland Lops...so that's not even a Netherland Dwarf baby. On top of that, that picture was taken to show the size of a peanut, which is a rabbit that recieves a fatal double dwarfing gene. So it is NOT the size of a normal kit.<br>  <br>  *sigh*<br>  <br>  Anyway, I don't have pictures as I don't breed dwarfs, but they are very small at birth. They're about a pinky length at birth. That picture Zelda posted does show what they look like, but as I said...it's not a dwarf baby.|`|ZdQtNNI9aa	They can fit in the palm of your hand.

0uqsaxEqaa	It's just part of growing up, and if they've only just been introduced they are likely to be testing out who's the boss, particularly if they are both quite dominant characters.<br>  <br>  I'm not intending to scaremonger, but do keep an eye out for scratches or bites though, which may happen accidentally, and can turn into absesses quite easily. Also invest in a good pair of animal nail clippers and take the sharp points off their claws until they settle down a bit - no point in giving them the means to accidentally hurt each other!|`|VHsD8KzXaa	that is absolutly normal. young cats are just like kids they need to play and have fun. we have 2 young cats that play 2 gether all the time.|`|oZIWhhoNaa	Yes! It's just that the kittens need to play with each other. It's especially normal for 2 male cats.|`|A5XuZ3pIaa	Yea, mine do!!!|`|AA10800192	they're fine as long as there isn't any really arched backs, puffed up fur, and loud growling hissing and swatting|`|bc80b085beb98b92a6819181843ddbbbaa	They are just playing, don't worry.  It's very normal|`|e31se8p1aa	It is normal. They're fighting for territory and think they're both stronger. If you think they could get hurt, I would take a broom and like push them away from each other, gently. If you're thinking about spraying them with water, I wouldn't recommend it. They could get way more aggressive and attack even you.
AxaspNJJaa	awwwwww she is adorable!!!! I love havaneses. They are a wonderful breed. I suggest the name....pebbles, ripple,misty, and I actually like the name missy but since your family doesn't like it.... Oh, and how much was she?

39a2d5e9bc3c417cbdc5ba33cb6386bbaa	I haven't seen anyone not recommend them.  They are community friendly, but it can be hard to feed them if you have carnivorous bottom dwellers.  They aren't very hardy in my experience, but get along fine with fish.  It's kind of annoying feeding them because they seem to have a hard time figuring out where the food is, but they're cute.

BJGudd52aa	1. A pair of dwarf cichlids (Golden Rams, Blue Rams, and to a lesser extent Kribensis) would work in a tank of that size, provided it was of the proper decoration, and that what you added in was definitely male/female. Adding in 2 males or 2 females will often end very badly, especially in such close quarters. They're interesting and rather hardy species, and from what I hear, one of the easier groups of cichlids to breed.<br>  <br>  2. Depends on the kind of puffers more than anything.A single Figure 8 Pufferfish could be housed in a 15, a group of Dwarf Pufferfish (say, around 6) could be housed in a 15, a pair of Red Eye Pufferfish, and that's about all the puffers I know that will live in a 15. Most of them get far too large to live in a tank of such a size.<br>  <br>  3. Once again, depends on the eels. I know if you went the saltwater route there is a few which will work in a tank of that size (Dwarf Golden Moray would probably be the best to my mind), but on the FW side I can't say I am that well versed honestly.<br>  <br>  4. Don't know much about Chesapeake Bay either, but I do know that coldwater SW can present very troublesome issues. The equipment required to keep the temperatures stable at what they'd be in the real world can cost a lot, and if we're honest, adds in another piece of equipment which can break down and cause your tank to spoil. <a href="http://www.nano-reef.com/forums/index.php?showtopic=164213" rel="nofollow">http://www.nano-reef.com/forums/index.ph...</a> may well be of help to you if you go this route, it's information gathered through a bunch of people making coldwater biotope tanks :]<br>  <br>  5. Reefs needn't call for you to remortgage a house to pay for them (though they easily can be), but a tank your size shouldn't cost much at all to set up. I assume you're in the US? If so, I've seen people over that side of the world set up beautiful reefs for a few hundred dollars including stock, your biggest expenses will be live rock (a natural biological filtration zone and the basis for the majority of reefs set up), good quality lighting (a 70W HQI/Metal Halide will allow you to grow most anything in that tank, as would a 4xT5HO unit), and excellent water flow. The good thing about reefs is they start out with tiny bits of coral generally, and then those grow to fill the spaces. And best of all - you can share/sell the bits that you cut off the growth to others in the hobby :]<br>  <br>  6. Specialty fish will usually have large additional costs associated with them, as well as being pretty easy to kill. Wouldn't waste your time unless you're willing to dedicate a fair amount of time and cash.<br>  <br>  7. That really depends on how deep the tank is.<br>  <br>  8. Neon Tetras are fun, but to keep them properly can be a pain in the ***. So long as it was a species tank with water of a proper hardness and pH I can't see it'd be a problem though, especially if you added in vegetation to the tank :]<br>  <br>  <br>  I'm not sure how a terrarium will go - if it's not rated for aquarium use I wouldn't risk putting things in it. Honestly, it'd be a lot cheaper to buy a new aquarium than replace everything in a smashed tank ;)|`|hFU31zm7aa	what i did was stays at the top 1 betta stays in the middle of the tank 4 black neon tetras (1.5 inches) stay at the bottom of the tank  6 pygmy corydoras they are also very small  <br>  <br>  its a great mix they all get along but i would recomend a 20 gallon filter cuase it is pushing the tanks limit on fish|`|iDId4QWuaa	idea one might work depending on what kind of cichlids. <br>  I don't think idea 2 would work but I don't know a ton about puffers.<br>  idea 3 wouldn't work because all eels that I know of get to big.<br>  idea 4, I'm not sure <br>  idea 5, no a old terrarium would omost never work for a reef tank. not just because of the tipe of tank but the size.<br>  idea 6, maybe, but you wouldn't be able to put much in that size tank.<br>  idea 7, well some bottom feeders can get pretty big, and I would think that you would like some other more colorful fish.<br>  idea 8, yes this would work, but it might be kind of bland.|`|f8RBtCVAaa	u could set up a brackish water tank and have just one figure 8 puffer fish. this water will be part freshwater and salt water. i want to so bad but every one says a 10 gallon is to small but a 15 will work. u could have 1 male betta and 10 neon tetras.
39a2d5e9bc3c417cbdc5ba33cb6386bbaa	You want to get the larger snails like golden apple snail. <a href="http://www.applesnail.net/content/species/pomacea_bridgesi.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.applesnail.net/content/specie...</a><br>  The one's that tag along on live plants are what you want to avoid.|`|6faBN1OEaa	I've had fish for quite a long time, and the snails I have are called corkscrew snails.

They live pretty long and wont harm your fish in  anyway.<br>  <br>  I DO NOT recommend cone snails because they breed rapidly and can easily over run your tank.  <br>  <br>  **It would prob. be best for your plants to just by an otocinclus or two becuase they will clean your tank just as well as a snail will**<br>  <br>  ><> Happy Fish Keeping <><|`|e55cjnbJaa	I have had lots and lots of experience with snails, so trust me on this. Gold snails, also called apple snails never eat your plants and wouldn't even eat a shrimp. They are the fastest snail and will clean up 80% of the fish's waste. They are found at almost all pet stores and are extremely hardy. You should keep one gold snail for every two gallons of water. Gold Snails are very attractive and there is only one problem with them. They produce a lot of waste, but are totally worth it. Good Luck - Jess|`|V4ljwCE8aa	go to the pet store and ask them about snails, but most snails shouldn't eat plants or kill fish

They usually live for a few years.  Just buy some hamster food at the store, they will have it.  Gerbil food will also work.

They need a small chewing block to keep their teeth from growing, which is only a few dollars.|`|3fcc9a252947e724efd722b6fb916926aa	it depends.<br>  <br>  dwarf hamsters are 15-20<br>  <br>  gerbils are 20-25<br>  <br>  rats are 11-20<br>  <br>  i hope i helped :] i used to breed hamsters.|`|cc8Jl3Lwaa	It actually depends on what type hamster you get.

Same thing goes for the cage, some cages come with bedding, food, water bottle, wheel and food dish. They can cost about 25-30 dollars. The cage I got came with a wheel, food dish, watter bottle, tubes, and an attached seperate room for only $27.  You might want to stick with what the store feeds their hamster because if you change their food to something different, they can get wet tail (but not all hamsters do, mine didn't).  Food can cost anywhere from 4-10 dollars also.|`|ntmsNk5Jaa	Syrian Hamsters (teddy bear) are $9.99<br>  <br>  Dwarfs $17.99<br>  <br>  They live 2 - 3 years.<br>  <br>  And only go to a local Petco to buy one. Because they use quality bedding. Petsmart uses wood Shavings. That causes tons of problems with health in rodents.<br>  <br>  10GAL aquariums are $9.99 as well. I recommend Syrian Hamsters. Easier to tame and to handle. Plus they are cute.|`|wnQK33zaaa	Hamster are somewhere around free from adopted to $40 good condition hamster. Usually most hamster are $19.95. I suggest getting a guinea pig, same price a little bit bigger so you cuddle like a small dog, but also it's nosier. A guinea pig is a called a pig because it grunts, snort, and whistle lol.|`|eaV0ip24aa	Hamsters can be anywhere from $15-$35. It depends on how fancy of a cage you want to get.

yQSu7v22aa	If she pees in the house at night but no other time she may not be able to hold it in.

Dogs will not soil their dens. <br>  <br>  To train your dog to sit:<br>  <br>  There are a number of sites online with simple video instruction on how to teach a dog to sit and to lie down. Some dogs don't shake, period. I taught my Lab to shake in about 2 minutes. I know have a Wheaten Terrier who won't shake, I don't care what you offer her, subject closed. She will sit, stay for up to 30 mintues, lie down, roll over, get her leash and speak. But she won't shake hands. <br>  <br>  I have trained both my dogs for Obedience Trials.<br>  <br>  It takes patience, consistency, lots of regular practice and consistency. "Sit" means "sit" the first time I say it; not after I say it ten times. "Down" means "lie down" the first time I say it. Don't get into the habit of saying "Sit! Sit! SIT! SIT!" because the dog will ignore you and think you are pointless. <br>  <br>  It's really important to establish right away that you mean business. Use a special collar when you are training and reserve that collar for training times. When you get it out, the dogs will know it's time to get busy.<br>  <br>  I recommend a pinch collar. Get properly fitted at a pet store and learn how to place the collar on the dog the right way. ONLY use the collar for training.<br>  <br>  Praise the heck out of your dog every time he does something right. Don't ever shout, get angry, lose your patience. If you get to the end of your rope, release the dog and call it a day. Be sure to "release" the dog so he knows that training is over and he can have some fun.<br>  <br>  Train in five or ten minute sessions two or three times a day. This is much better than training for an hour straight. Both  you and the dog will tire of it quickly if you push it.<br>  <br>  This is an excellent site. Check it out: <br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.dogbehavioronline.com/dog_training.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.dogbehavioronline.com/dog_tra...</a><br>  <br>  Scroll down to the list of commands for training.<br>  <br>  Good luck! Working with dogs is great fun, very rewarding and creates a special bond with each of them. Enjoy!|`|F4ptJH67aa	The urinating inside the house could be becaue you give her water before you bring her inside at night. As for the training, it usually depends on the time you spend with the dog. Usually when my dog was trained, they told me, or who ever was with my dogs during the training, to feed her a small portion of food in the morning so that by the time the trainer came in the evening she would be hungry. That way you can have your dog listen to you by giving her some delicious treats. To sit you stand in front of the dog with the treat out of sight, but in your hand. Then you tell her to sit, if she doesnt sit you gently push her back down onto the floor until she sits and give her a small portion of the treat. Make sure you say "sit" when he/she sits down so that she understands. This method is called classical conditioning (if you didn't know). Use this method every day for about an hour and a half. The routine becomes tedious after a while, but, depending on the dog, it works quite effectively. The same for laying down except from sitting down position you hold the treat in her face near the dogs nose and drag slowly move your hand from her face down to the floor until she lays down. The dog should follow the treat. If it's the first time you could move her legs so that she gently goes into laying down position. Give your dog a treat every time! Make sure he or she knows so that the dog knows its doing something right. Eventually she should do it with just hearing your voice. Same goes with shake except YOU take her hand and tell her "shake", and give your dog a treat.|`|UZfLLFDBaa	First of all I would have the blue tick checked by a vet for a urinary tract infection. Is that the only time she has accidents? Has she always been this way, maybe you need to re-housebreak her alittle.  It may also be that as she is getting older her bladder is not as strong and there is medication they can prescribe to help with that. I would go to your local bookstore and look for books on dog training or see if there is a class somewhere that you can join. Ask your vet if they can recommend any reading for you. The main thing to remember is to keep it fun for the dog. Don't be to stern or hard as they will not respond as well. Just remember - you can teach an old dog new tricks. It just takes patience.|`|lwUHC13vaa	well ii don't know about the peeing but the trainingg i can help you with(: when your teaching a dog to sit, laydown, shake, ect.. you need to be CONSISTENT! <br>  first tell the dog to sit down!<br>  then if he doesn't right away push on the bottom of his back tell he sits down! <br>  then when he does give him a lil treat or praise him!<br>  then just keep doing that over and over and over!<br>  same with the other tricks!|`|O8LiCt19aa	i have 2 hound dogs too. all you have to do is be patient and give them a reward when they do good. when you tell them to do something, move their bodies so they know what to do and tell them what it is they're doing.
8YrqeCPQaa	Put down the food for him (the food you want him to eat with nothing on it) leave it down for 10 minutes. If he hasnt eaten it yet, pick it up and dont give him more time to eat untill the next feeding time (which may be that night or the next day or the next morning) the more he misses his meals, the more inclined he will be to eat what you put in front of him (he will not die from missing his meals for 2 or 3 days but he will learn to eat the food you give him) I do this with my puppies to teach them that if they dont eat this food, now, then you may not get another chance to eat until the next day or so. I have been successful with this, now all my dogs eat their whole meal in under 1 min.|`|hfZSILMNaa	you should tryt feeding your dog at specific times an if he doesnt esgt it after half hour to an hour then take it away.untill the next feed, an give him it again,or try mixing meat into the biscuits.NOT tinned thogh!<br>  an if he doesnt eat it with the meat in jus leave it untill he does.<br>  <br>  some dogs dont like gravy in their food, and this can cause an upset tummy also!<br>  <br>  your dog will eat when its hungry, my dog trys 2 c if there is anything better on offer as well. but i try to change the flavour of his dry food, an occasionally add a half of a different dry food for variety.<br>  <br>  hope this has helped :0)|`|FG9hjIIjaa	pour a bit of olive oil in his food|`|P8Q39vA4aa	Try putting green beans in his food and see if he eats it.

K0tpQoHRaa	well since the bird is still young and though he was pre hand tamed it still has a erdge of interest and may want to get to know you more as you want to get to know it. though having friend around was good having it alone for the start is even better, so that it can be more interested in you then other birds and learn the owner pet relationship at which you wish to have.!!! dont feel sorrow as it was just getting to know the other bird as well..!!!|`|qeOlkRM0aa	It sounds like your bird is bonding to you. He considers you to be part of the flock You are doing fine. he may still be sorting things out, and he is young. Train him, and he will be your friend for a long time.<br>  Enjoy|`|Gr6Xe1gGaa	First of all you are smart enough not to do what Emko says. Your bird is beginning to bond with you and wants to get to know you so it can get a new friend. If you want your budgie to bond with you and make you his best friend then you wouldn't want to let your third parakeet meet your budgie. If you do put the two together your budgie will bond with your third budgie instead of you. Try bonding with both of them so you can get them both to like you.

MmRDzhaHaa	Oh my, she is just a short time away i would say no longer than a week! she will let you know by nest building looking in cupboards ect so just provide a nice quiet place for her,and when she is giving birth just check on her now and again in case she accidently squashes them, as she will be moving about in her birthing bed,it can take up to 24 hours for the whole litter to arrive! but once they are all safely born its important to give her some privacy, as some cats will reject them if people keep going to look at them.|`|0nIwKd5Uaa	watch for her to start plucking the hair from around her nipples and her butt area.

Looks like conjunctivitis which could pass to the kittens. Try & get her to the vet before she gives birth.|`|oDVx7nSxaa	Not long - and i agree with the previous poster, she's got some sort of eye infection, and possibly the beginning of an upper respiratory infection. While it probably won't harm an adult, those kinds of things can quickly kill a newborn kitten.  URI's can cause congestion, and given a choice between breathing and eating, the kittens choose breathing - and then quickly die.  Try to get mom to the vet first thing on Monday.  She should be flea treated and wormed too so that she's parasite free when the kittens arrive.  They vet can give you a flea treatment and wormer that's safe for a pregnant mom - the over the counter stuff isn't generally safe for the unborn babies.
C4jNmT32aa	A dog will have puppies around 9 weeks along. Avg is 63 days.  I'm wanting to guess that she's 3-4 weeks along.  I have a dog that is pregant also, and she's about the same time along.  She's at the end of 3 weeks and doing the same things.  She'll play a lot but she'll sit and lay down a lot too.  She gets tired pretty quickly too.  Her boobs ae growing, but there is no milk in them, yet.<br>  <br>  You can ask around and see if a vet will do a Doppler, they cost about $25-40 dollars.  They can help to see how far along your puppy is and how many there is.  ALSO be warned, it's not exact but it's cheaper than doing a Ultrasound which can start off at $350+, and again they aren't exact either.  A friend of mine had a Doppler done on her puppy ad they said there was 6 heart beats, and she had 8 puppies.  <br>  <br>  BUT if you are wanting to narrow the time down more, you can ask the vet tech to help you out.  GREATEST of luck with your puppies.  Make sure to update whenever you have the puppies so that we know how's it going.|`|5a1c8253181a8adf5c06c0040d8f981eaa	Even the most experienced vets don't bother to palpate (feel) for puppies.  They shoot an x-ray or use an ultrasound.<br>  <br>  You should really have this dog checked by a veterinarian, and if she seems far enough along they can shoot an x-ray to see how many puppies are in there and if their heads are going to fit through mom's pelvis.|`|CcESWX5vaa	heres a good site <a href="http://www.petcaretips.net/dog_breeding_pregnancy_birthing.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.petcaretips.net/dog_breeding_...</a> as for the spay one most vets wont spay if the dogs pregnant anymore my sister took her cat in to get her spayed n she was about 2 weeks into her pregnancy  n they said they wasnt allowed to spay a pregnant animal anymore its illegal in some states because so many  cats n dogs  died from it.|`|GIPIjD2Oaa	dogs are pretty good at giving birth on their own so if you misjudge it she should be fine. depending on breed a dogs gestation is about 52-58 days. when the puppies are nearly due, you will know|`|55N1AA7zaa	erm well her nipples will become larger and she will become fat =P<br>  <br>  you shoulld be able to feel the pups about 2-4 weeks (based on my cavalier) what breed  is she or if u dont know how big =S|`|tpSUlxvZaa	a couple months but dont go to long or something might go wrong with ur dog|`|4S6V4sb4aa	If the dog was just found, how do you know she's pregnant at all.. She might have something wrong with her hips or something.   But if she would to be pregnant, her Virgina would be, and stay enlarged or swollen looking,, and you would not be able to feel any puppies until at least 5 plus weeks,, she wont produce milk into her nipples until the last few weeks of her pregnancy...Make sure she has her own area that is untouched or unmoved,, that's the place she will give birth.. you will need towels and might have to help her deliver them or open the sack around the puppy.. good luck|`|KxjUim7yaa	You have no idea what she was bred with.

Bettas can make great community fish (ive always had them in communitys) its really only other bettas they dont get along with. As long as a bettas tank mate can kill him (like a goldfish) and you havnt got a very evil betta (they all have different personalites) then theyll be fine.<br>  <br>  Best of l uck Angel.|`|AktmOvVmaa	because male betta fish are also called "fighting fish" so they will probably kill your goldfish|`|KgKVWv9paa	the betta fish may bite the **** out of them

8Ymsx4Oraa	New tank syndrome. Look it up.<br>  <br>  Your tank is not cycled and if you add all those fish you WILL loose some. You need to research cycling a tank first and then buy the fish!! A clown is not suitable for that tank anyway, best thing you can do i return/sell your fish and slowly add a few hardy fish so you tank can cycle. Can take 4-8 weeks. Be patent and you ll be rewarded. <br>  <br>  Also Cory's are schooling, so are Angels in general and tetras...as in?....Just be careful what fish you mix and match and always try and complete schools. Alot less fin nipping etc this way.<br>  <br>  <br>  Best of luck Angel|`|cr64xK4Kaa	your fish are most likely going to be dead soon if you didn't use the proper chemicals (water conditioner, ph & amonia balancer... ) you need a filter and heater that are made for size tank. you will need gravel (which needs to be soaked in hot water prior to putting it in the tank) look at people's answers because this question gets asked alot|`|39a2d5e9bc3c417cbdc5ba33cb6386bbaa	You should get a filter rated for a 30 or 40 gallon, whichever you can find.  It doesn't hurt to over filter.  You want to look up the nitrogen cycle and understand how it works.  It takes about a month to fishless cycle, but at least you don't have to worry about killing any.  Gravel is up to you, I like the natural looking pebbles, but it's a personal choice.  You can also mix in a substrate like fluorite if  you're interested in keeping live plants.  Make sure you rinse it thoroughly first.  The only chemicals you need to add is a water conditioner.  I use stress coat.  You also need a test kit so you know when the water parameters are safe to add fish.  API master liquid test kit is a good one. <br>  <br>  Research the fish you are getting before you buy them to make sure they won't get too big for your tank or eat each other.  For example, your angel fish will eat tetras and albino cories need to be kept in a school and loaches like to be in schools too.  I would suggest one or two schools of middle/top dwellers and then a school of bottom dwellers and an algae eater.  You want to stick to peaceful community fish, be careful about semi aggressive or aggressive fish.  Try harlequin rasboras, cherry barbs, neon or cardinal tetras (6 or more).  For bottom dwellers cories are always good.  I have polka dot loaches in my tank, they are very playful, but should be kept in a group of 3 or so.|`|dXLMDGqDaa	well first of all since you ready got your fish you should go and buy some alive bacteria so your fish tank would have enought bacteria so they wont die, may one or two fish may die but not all of them. and treat the water they sale all of this stuff at petsmart or  petco. also dont feed them twice a day so they  wont get a lot of food waste that can kill them since they dont have a lot of defence right now since is a nw fish tank<br>  <br>  good luck with your fish|`|lfhnChXXaa	As far as the filter size, I always go up one size.  If the filter is for up to 50 gallons, I buy the next size up.  That way the filter doesn't have to work as hard.<br>  The fish is a little different, you are going to put aggressive fish in there according to your description.  Make sure you don't put non aggressive in there they will not survive.<br>  I have a 55 gallon.  I love it, I put two mollies in mine when I started almost two years ago, they have multiplied to 13 now.  None of my others do this on their own.<br>  Good Luck....

FNYEkyqLaa	Actually what your dog does is called "submissive peeing".  This indicates that you have an omega dog or one that does not want to be pack leader but just a follower, and nothing wrong with that.  I think omega dogs are just the sweetest because they love everyone.  Submissive peeing ofter occurs when the dog is excited or approached by something or someone new.  This is a sign of submission.  That is the dog is telling everyone that it is submissive and not to fear it.  Often a submissive dog will roll over on its back while peeing.  This exposes the throat to any attacker and is the ultimate sign of submission.

As long as he is eating and seems healthy otherwise, I don't know that I would worry. It's up to your grandma to try to fix the issues if she chooses. Otherwise, just love him and play with when you can. Good Luck.

4b5106290d0dd7b8527192088f2ec6b6aa	If your piggie is young (under six months), he/she should be eating Alfalfa hay. Piggies over six months should get Timothy hay. I realise you don't know the age, but you can tell by weight whether or not its a baby or a teenager or a full grown adult. Be sure you are feeding pellets, hay, and fresh veggies every day. The pellets should be plain green with no seeds or coloured bits. They should also contain stabilised Vitamin C.<br>  <a href="http://www.guinealynx.info/diet.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.guinealynx.info/diet.html</a><br>  <br>  Pups always have soft hair when they are young, but it will coarse up as they age. Some more so than others. It just depends upon the genetics of that piggie.<br>  <br>  It is normal for the piggie to run from you. This is their instinct. However, over time (sometimes it takes longer with pet store piggies since they are not used to human contact) your piggie will learn to trust you. Handfeeding yummy treats is a good way to encourage trust. The more you work with the piggie, the faster this process will go.<br>  <br>  If your piggie doesn't like carrots, its probably because he/she has not been exposed to them and your piggie doesn't understand that its food. New veggies should be introduced in little bites so you don't end up wasting a bunch of food. It may take several, if not numerous, tries before your piggie figures out that the treats are good. <br>  <br>  Don't be discouraged. Long lasting relationships with pets can take time. Be patient & it will pay off!<br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|CACiIkS6aa	I added some guinea pigs to my family today. I had 4 before so now i have 6! <br>  <br>  First of all, you only need one kind of hay. Try not to feed it too much hay because it is purely for fiber only and is not proper food. Yes, the hair will get coarser as time grows. <br>  <br>  They're probably scared. Give them at least 48 hours to adapt to it's new enviroment before you try to pick it up. It's scared and might think you want to attack it. It will probably take about 3 days or 4 until it lets you pick it up, but guinea pigs are very jumpy creatures, so you need to gain it's trust slowly. <br>  <br>  Try not to make too much of a sudden movement. Give it some time and some treats, and make sure your cage is large enough. The minimum for a guinea pig is 30" by 36". Make sure it has a little hideout house for it to sleep in. Once it gets used to the new enviroment, it will be less scared.|`|q0avHwvWaa	O.K. I am going to be in your position soon but I do have experience with rodents. You should definitely not give it alfalfa hay. Timothy hay is the best to use. I am not sure about the hair thing. But, as for handling it, you just need to be patient. Keep doing what your doing. While you're holding it, stay close or over the cage in case it tries to jump. In a few weeks it will trust you and will most likely become your best friend!lol<br>                        -have fun with him!|`|Zgtv1mDzaa	I wouldn't give it too much hay because its not proper food..its only a source of food there to keep them occupied and munching. You will need to get guinea pig food. My guinea pig, Princess wouldn't eat carrots but LOVES cucumber and lettuce and broccoli.. you will have to try a lot of vegetables.. It will take a while for it to get used to its new surroundings and your voice before it gets comfortable so keep talking and petting it and feed it out of your hand..keep picking it up so he has no choice but to get used too you.No the hair will more than likely stay the same|`|eaV0ip24aa	It should only need one kind of hay. So if you already have timothy hay you shouldn't need alfalfa hay. After you run out of timothy hay, you might want to get alfalfa hay and see which one he likes best. As for the hair, it might get a little more coarse, but not too much. It could take as long as a few weeks before it get comfortable around you and its new environment. Give him treats so it knows that you are going to be good to him. <br>  <br>  <br>  Hope this helps.|`|jvqFxXnYaa	well, with my hamster, it took me a few weeks for it to let me hold it. now i let her run over my head xDD! for a few days, let your guinea pig be by itself so it can get used to its home. after that, just try feeding it out of your hand. if you feel ready enough, try holding it. I heard they only bite u if ur scared. im not sure if it will get coarser hair, maybe i haerd running a soft bristled tooth brush through there hair. and about the hay? i would search on google. I have never fed them hay before. but i know as a treat, they like salt wheels, yogurt drops, and dried berries, or veggies. WARING MAY GET BITTEN THEY DRAW BLOOD. LOOK ONLINE BEFORE FEEDING THEM BECAUSE SOME FOODS MAY BE POISONOUS.|`|NlI4P7fRaa	I am going to answer your problem about picking it up. Your Guinea pig is probably not used to u thus, it is scared. What you should do is put your hand at the opening. Hold it there for a while. Put ur hand in a little more each day eventually when ur hand is all the way in there, pet it or its feet. (they like that!). After a while u should b able to gently lift him out.<br>  <br>  <br>  If that doesn't work, you could leave the door open and watch him or her. Eventually, the guinea pig will come out and you could put ur hand closer each day, as listed above. I hope it works.

Usually a store does it as a free service because it brings people in and they buy stuff.  Buy a toy or a treat for your bird - that is tip enough.
F3FrZ7eAaa	If there's a pond near where you live, I recommend putting it in there at a shallow  place so that the eggs are just covered with water. If you want to raise the tadpoles yourself, you can find excellent info on how to do that here: <a href="http://allaboutfrogs.org/info/tadpoles/index.html" rel="nofollow">http://allaboutfrogs.org/info/tadpoles/i...</a><br>  <br>  EDIT: If you're really going to do this, I suggest you take a few of them! If the rest are definitely going to die, why not save a few lives. Also, the chances of the one you pick to survive are quite slim. Take a few, keep your favorite and release the other surviors. Good luck, hope you can hatch them!|`|z7FEj9QSaa	They are going to be tadpoles when they hatch. NO more problem cause your not going to be able to take care of a tadpole.
da0aae2062bfa45dd5bf319b25c3e886aa	So long as the eggs do not freeze, they will most likely still be viable. However, ordering duck eggs from anywhere, even incubating them yourself, always leaves room for error that one or more of the eggs may not hatch. But shippers typically plan for fluxes in temperature and therefore transport the eggs in highly padded boxes. Hope they stay nice and toasty on their way to you! Good luck!
dl1OOOT8aa	First of all, raw meat will not cause bad gas. Feeding raw is more than alright. With a shih tzu I would just make sure to avoid small pieces such as turkey necks. Feed whole large chunks of meat so the dog can tear and chew the meat. <br>  <br>  You only need to feed about 2% of their body weight. Eventually you can introduce some organ pieces.|`|JM4Uiunqaa	If you are going to feed raw, do the proper research. It doesn't need to be complicated, but you will have questions or problems along the way. I suggest googling Prey Model Diet to get started. You should also join some of the Yahoo! raw feeding groups which are great sources of help (some of the members have been feeding for 10+ years). Good luck!|`|6qsocyK3aa	In the wild it is what they would eat anyway. Just be prepared for really stinky farts.|`|yXUS7jz5aa	Yes raw meat is good for dogs.|`|qzPZf2XPaa	Look up Prey Model or BARF feeding.
dE5fs9yzaa	Bettas don't need the air pump. They do need a heater and a filter would make it easier on you and the betta in the cleaning department. Use the new silk plants for aquariums, make sure thats what they are. I have just one silk plant per betta plus semi-medium size flat stones. For me, its the beauty of the fish I'm interested in, not the tank. The boys seem really comfortable in their tanks and thats what I want.|`|cUx1uCBkaa	A filter and air pump will help make the betta happy but you can have a very happy fish without them. Just make sure to clean it regularly. <br>  Plants are always a good idea but again you can go without. A good choice would be java fern or java moss. <br>  Hope this helps|`|5vaFaQoMaa	I have a beta and I think it is better to put in silk plants than real ones. Also you don't really need any air pump, but a filter helps keep the tank clean longer. Also only do a 50% water change as they really don't like the tank to be really clean. Good luck

A popular pet, Pacman Frogs can eat mice. Others usually eat bugs, which is meat, therefore they are carnivores. In their tadpole stages, most begin as herbivores and become carnivores as they grow.

F3FrZ7eAaa	What about a Fire Belly Toad? If your house isn't too cold, they should be fine without a heater. They stay small, about 2-2.5 inches. Most people get more than one, as they are cheap and don't require a lot of room. A 10-gallon aquarium with a secure lid should be adequate for a pair of fire belly toads. When housing toads together it is important that they are the same size as they can be cannibalistic.  A 50/50 ratio of land to water is usually the best way to maintain these animals for breeding. A strictly forest floor type of enclosure is fine if you will not be breeding.<br>  <br>  Air temperature should be maintained at 68° to 75° F with a basking spot of 74° to 85° F. My house is about 70°, so heating isn't necessary. Depending on where you live though, a heating lamp MIGHT be needed for a basking spot. Materials like Bed-a-Beast?, sterilized potting soil, or sphagnum moss can all be used as substrate. Gravel is not recommended as the top layer of substrate because the toads may ingest the gravel and cause an impaction.<br>  <br>  If using a forest floor type of setup, spot clean regularly and replace the substrate as needed. Fresh dechlorinated water should be offered daily. Good luck, hope this helped!|`|jzASWplfaa	just dont keep it in the pool room and you can get whatever frog you want|`|QrjjiOgTaa	where do you live?? most frogs need a source of heat especially in the winter time even a common toad. no amphibian really enjoys handleing, some just tolerate it more than others. handleing an amphibian is very stressful to them and can cause them harm (they breathe through their skin so anything on your hands can get into their system and handleing them rips the mucus and slime that they need for immunity)  so please research handleing amphibians

It is VERY dangerous and extremely contagious Not to mention that the virus can stay on items and in the yard for years. <br>  <br>  For your sake, I hope it's not Parvo.

Don't force food on her. If she gets worse, ring the emergency vet.|`|CL5Plgekaa	Hi. I'm sure this is a worrying time for you and your puppy. First it may be possible the puppy ate something which Did not agree with it's digestion. This happens regularly with young pupps. Keep an eye on the frequency of the runny faeces. It's dangerous in puppys if it continues for over 24 hours. However if they begin to become more solid that is a very good sign. <br>  Now to ensure your puppy remains rehidrated provide water. Food wise I'd say you should offer the puppy small regular feeds of cooked chicken, boiled rice and some moistened bread. Please don't give the puppy water with sugar in it.  This can upset it's tummy further and lead to the puppy drinking more water than it should. I hope you and the puppy get on well at the vets and this information is helpful to you. Good Luck.

If the mats are that bad, take the cat to a groomer or the vet where they have clippers and people who can handle cats with mats.|`|YBcB0732aa	I certainly would talk to the vet before giving your cat ANY medicine, especially human medicine.

Could work for your cat, too, works on a lot of them.<br>  <br>  Also, you can try a clipper - they sell small ones for pets, or you can buy one intended for cutting men's hair, and just buzz the matts out.

If it's just scissors, then it might be worth trying to slowly get her used to them, by giving her treats while they are near, then next to them, then just touch her with them and treat... Though it's probably better to use clippers anyway!|`|kVcRIHglaa	maybe scared|`|uKpkOss0aa	There are brushes out there that are designed for long-haired cats.

XxU94aKlaa	About a 3, if he's right against my face maybe as much as a 4- though I don't consider the smell unpleasant.<br>  I own a single ferret and like to join in working with the rescue group here when I can. <br>  Twilight was an utter accident that came to me neutered and descented (the dots on his ears mark him as a Marshall's for the record), the litter box is cleaned every day to every other day, the bedding is cleaned once a week (this is very important), and he is only bathed if absolutely necessary (so unless he's rolled in poo or something I can't simply wipe off then no baths/ frequent bathing will cause the production of more oils and thus a stronger smell), and occasionally I like to sprits him with some ferret spray (melon scented).<br>  Not over bathing, changing the litter, keeping the cage clean, washing the bedding, and feeding high quality ferret or kitten food all help to keep the odor to a minimum.<br>  Often times us ferret owners don’t notice the mild smell though, I can’t smell Twilight at all unless he’s up against my face (and even then I don’t find the musky odor unpleasant personally).<br>  Try hanging out around some ferrets (in a shelter, pet store, or someone’s home) for a bit and seeing what you think of living with that scent before you decide.<br>  <br>  Be sure to research ferret ownership and care before getting a ferret, and be sure that they are the right pet for you.

Personally, I don't think they smell bad - it's kind of a musky scent - but they do have an odor to them that some people dislike.<br>  <br>  For the rating of one to ten, I'd say 3 or 4, depending on how you feel about the odor.

0BjfEel2aa	Also known as Crawfish, Freshwater Crayfish <br>  <br>  Yabbies are freshwater crayfish which are distinguished from others by having 4 low ridges along the head and a short smooth rostrum.  Their claws are broad and spade-like, with serrations along their inner edge.  The claws are sometimes covered with a matt of fine hairs.  Body colour ranges from pale to dark brown and there is a distinctive mottled pattern on the outer edge of the claws.<br>  <br>  Yabbies are widely distributed throughout central and southern inland Australia.   There is also a translocated population in the south-west of Western Australia.<br>  <br>  Yabbies live in both temporary and permanent habitats including rivers, creeks, billabongs, lakes, irrigation canals, farm dams, swamps and bore drains.  They generally inhabit turbid, slow flowing or still, shallow water but they can be found in waters up to 5 metres deep, depending on the levels of dissolved oxygen.<br>  <br>  Juveniles are often found associated with microphytes, that is large emergent aquatic plants in the shallower parts of water bodies.<br>  <br>  Temperature limits for yabbies are between 0°C and 36°C.  Yabbies can survive periods of drought by burrowing in damp soil and they remain in their burrows until the next rains.<br>  <br>  Yabbies spawn from October to March, with peak activity between December and February.   Spawning is induced by an increase in day length and water temperature (above 15°C)  It is not uncommon to find 1000 eggs on a large female.<br>  <br>   <br>  Following spawning, the female carries the eggs under her tail, where they incubate for 3 weeks.<br>  <br>  Like all crustaceans, yabbies have to moult as they grow.  The frequency of this decreasing as they grow older.  Weight can increase by up to 50% with each moult.<br>  <br>  Feeding activity peaks at dusk and dawn.  Their diet is mainly detritus, plant material and small invertebrates.  Yabbies are cannibalistic and smaller animals often are eaten by larger animals.  Yabbies are also preyed on by fish, water rats, fresh water tortoises and water birds.  Water birds, particularly Cormorants, can be a major pest in commercial aquaculture operations.<br>  <br>  Yabbies are fished commercially.  They are taken wild, but there is an increase in farming yabbies. <br>  <br>   <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  Crayfish & Crawfish Recipes<br>  <br>  [Main Australian Fish & Seafood Page]|`|t6UkxbBNaa	WHAT ON EARTH!!..... is a 'yabbi'?!??!?|`|XavY3fiWaa	A what?

We had a stray come up and we started feeding him, had made up our mind to adopt him, before letting him in the house. We took him to be neutered. He tested postitive for FIV.  We had him put to sleep. We did not know when we took him to the vet, that someone had brought a stray 5 month old female, he was spaying her, when I walked in with Freckles. He finished surgery and told me he was going to call me and see if I was interested in a sweet precious female, that he had just spayed.

If you get too many cats in one home, though, they start to have trouble identifying where they fit in the pecking order and it can lead to a lot of insecurity, fights, etc.  My husband and I have four cats.  We have a medium-sized home.  It's not huge, by any means, but we have enough rooms that they find spots to be by themselves if they're so inclined.  I don't think we would get a fifth cat, though, in the size home that we have.|`|f5a8d99afbb73cd0703df99b87996901aa	First you need to check with you municipal board to see if there is a pet limit in your city.  Some places only allow residents to own a limited number of pets.  Other than that, if you have ample space, can afford proper vet care and good food for all of them, and have time to spend with them all, I don't see a problem.  Too many cats is when you aren't able to do the things I listed, be it one cat or 20.|`|77700ae60cac2abd41d7a7f8bd98336aaa	No. If you can afford to feed them well and provide vet care why not. I had three at one time. They would all sleep up close to each other either on the back of the sofa or on my bed.

Once you get him in, clip his wings so that he can never get out and fly away again.|`|6KxBqnstaa	Need to go outside and make familiar sounds that he knows such as a whistle or a call you do back and forth. Also try holding on to some food so he will come. Your best bet is to hope he makes it through the night and put his cage with food and water and toys out in the am when light. He will get hungry and look for something familiar. Also call and make familiar noises. Tell your neighbors to keep eye out especially if they have bird feeders out. make sure you have a net handy if you see him. Good luck.|`|x5tOxNz9aa	bring his cage outside or something that he s familiar with. Make sure he can see it, try putting a light next to it so he can see it even in the dark, he might get stressed if he is outside, so the first familiar thing he sees, he'll want it. So take is cage outside, or you could try and get a large net and catch him tht way, hope this helps|`|6zDVlvIoaa	my friend once used a hose to get her bird out of a tree, but i'd just wait outside and make familiar noises to try to lure the bird out of the tree or offer it some food, JUST DONT LEAVE IT ALONE IT MIGHT FLY SOMEWHERE ELSE AND U WONT FIND IT!!!!!<br>  <br>  good luck|`|cpxkROqMaa	Open his cage with fresh food and place it outside.

XUnsJ2xjaa	i wouldnt advise buying from a website...but go down to your local RSPCA or other similar organisation and adopt from there, you get to save a life and find the perfect pet. :D|`|tPGxPDvBaa	Try your local paper on-line want ads.|`|0SHAY9TQaa	No site that sells pets is a good idea! What you need to do is adopt. Visit local shelters, or look on www.petfinder.com<br>  <br>  Adopt a dog, and save a life! Good Luck :)|`|p7ZdohGTaa	Here are some places to try:<br>  www.petfinder.com - Petfinder is a site that allows rescue leagues and sometimes shelters to advertise their animals. These animals are usually in need, but sometimes rescue leagues can take their time to get back to you, and some have rules for adoption that can seem a bit strict. That does not mean they are not a good place to adopt through. I helped with one and they adopted animals out to good homes.<br>  <br>  www.craigslist.com - this site allows people to advertise their dogs and cats they want to find homes for. Sometimes shelters advertise here, but not too often. You can contact the people at their anonymous address provided by Craigslist, or a phone number if they have posted one. There are often pictures and good descriptions of the animals, to help you decide if it is an animal you might be interested in.<br>  <br>  www.kijiji.com - Another online site with animals for adoption.<br>  <br>  Rescue leagues showing their animals at Petco or Petsmart stores. They do this on weekends and you can see the animals in person, without having to go to different homes, etc. You can see what you think of the animal. Ask about the adoption contract details upfront before you fall in love with an animal.<br>  <br>  Shelters - The animals who need you most, usually these animals are prescreened and very loving and adoptable. You can find anything from puppies and kittens to full grown dogs and cats and you can even find purebred dogs, there. I adopted my dog from a dog pound and she is the best dog you could have. These are NOT rejects. They are truly nice animals, in a bad spot and they usually thank you every day for your kindness in saving them. <br>  <br>  Please try to find an animal that is not offered through a breeder. This helps encourage excess breeding. If you get a dog who is not fully housetrained, get a dog cage and crate-train. Find a book about Crate-training. It is extremely useful and works!<br>  <br>  If you are not sure if you are ready for a dog, try fostering one or two to see how you like dog ownership - rescue leagues are always in need of fosters.|`|hZWup7xXaa	www.kijiji.com its a great site, but there are the odd scammers on there, most ppl can tell what adds are scammers though. hope this helps, i've gotten lots of things off of here and it is a great site.|`|AxaspNJJaa	um...petfinder.com....there is kijiji but I would advise to stay away from there.

g61qflItaa	a yellow labrador is good for goose hunting and it can be a boy or girl.|`|ivIQl6Awaa	My friend breeds labs and trains them for hunting.  They have been bred to do it, and are much easier trained due to the breed.  (for purebreds at least)  For example they have "soft mouths" meaning they generally let go of things they are holding instead of pulling on it (once you train them, so they don't wreck the bird they are retrieving).  They can be fairly easily trained to follow hand signals as well and are rarely gun shy.  If you got a mix with lab in it, it would prob do just as well if you gave it the right training.  And as a bonus, they are awesome family pets anyways, so if the hunting doesn't turn out, you still have a great dog!!!|`|OFpl236faa	I know someone who duck hunts with labs. There is also someone with a standard poodle who field hunts. I also think a pointer would be good. Do you know anyone who hunts with a dog? What type they might have? I know that labs are common for duck hunting. I think that the gender really has to be up to you and your preference. Males are generally bigger.<br>  <br>  Do not get a Jack Russell for this kind of hunting. Totally wrong type of hunting for them. They hunt rodents and other small pray like that, not birds.

IrdZKYT3aa	Yes they can, it was named after the neon tetra b/c they were the first for it to be discovered in, and of their tendency to get it, however it can infect other fish as well, just not as often.<br>  Who else des it live with?  Tetra?  Tetra are known fin nippers and don't usually make good tank mates for the long finned male guppy.  He may definitely be suffering from abuse and harassment.<br>  Unfortunately, there is no cure or treatment for neon tetra disease, it's generally a highly contagious death sentence.  You need to isolate him to verify if he is infected, he may need to be humanely euthanized.<br>  Best of Luck
CqquoBy4aa	They are capable.|`|hKXIeur6aa	They are very much capable of breeding. However, the majority of the spawns will be brown, and if you are looking for money, the albino plecos sell for more. The mature age for bristlenose plecos is about a year, I believe. Remember, the only difference between your brown and albino plecos is the colour, so the same care is needed for both.

If you make a lot of money with meal worms-- what are they being fed to? You don't want to breed Ball Pythons for example if no one in your region will want them. I suggest you start by breeding a popular reptile, or maybe even morphs of that species. Things like Leopard Geckos, Beardies, Balls and Corns are obviously right up there when it comes to common reptiles.|`|jzASWplfaa	buddy come one there are already plenty of reptiles in this world, you dont need to be greety and get money from breeding them when there is no reason for it.
FNYEkyqLaa	No telling how long the breed has been around but it has been here for a long time.  It was bred to hunt badgers and that it what its name means in German, badger hound.  It has a round chest with a pronounced keel, or breast bone, for digging, short legs, for tunneling, and a strong tail so it can be pulled out of any hole it might get stuck in.  Since a badger is a very aggressive animal and will fight just as soon as run, the dachshund is also fearless and brave fighter.  On the other hand they are very social and truly a lap dog as that is where they prefer to be, in their owners lap.|`|PM23RDycaa	Dachshund - it means badger dog which is what they were bred to hunt and the breed was developed in the early 1600s in Germany. They are the size they are because they are supposed to be able to get into and dig out the badger's burrow on top of fight and kill it.|`|KxjUim7yaa	Dachshunds ( Daks huns) have been around since the 15th century. The name means Badger Dog and they were used for hunting badgers,rabbits and other burrowing prey. They have webbed feet and very strong nails for digging. They are hounds that can follow a scent trail. They can compete in ground trials where they go underground to a prey they find in a cage. They are very smart.They are short so they can go underground and have strong tails so that they might be pulled from a burrow if necessary.|`|7KxQXHzOaa	They were bred to hunt burrowing animals such as badgers and rabbits. dachshund means badger dog. the reason they're so small is so they can fit in burrows and they also have strong tails in case they have to get pulled out of a burrow.  they are SO cute, i think.|`|PVR0y9eOaa	its spelled dachshund<br>  they were bred to go into holes and catch rodents and stuff, they're like hunter dogs there are larger dachshunds (medium size) and then there are the minature dachshunds. i love both breeds.|`|zWFJBlJZaa	In the 1600's in Germany as a badger dog.

They will eat and drink when they need to.<br>  <br>  My rats often stay in the same place for 3, 4 five hours.<br>  <br>  Hope I helped|`|6W4ZWOetaa	Hey there,<br>  First of all NEVER EVER EVER feed a rat peanut butter, as one answerer said.  The choking risk is too great.  I have heard way too many horror stories about rats choking and dying on peanut butter.<br>  <br>  Anyway... sorry about that.  Had to get it out, you probably already know...<br>  <br>  Good for you for taking your rat to the vet!  :)  The blood blister will probably be fine if you keep it clean and dry.  Usually once a blister pops it will start to drain and swelling, inflammation, etc will go down.  You can clean it with a warm moist cloth with water and then dry it off. <br>  When it starts to scab let the scab form, and your rat should be fine.<br>  <br>  Take him back to the vet if it starts to look infected, rats can get infections easily, but they can be pretty easy to treat too. <br>  <br>  As for him not looking so good.  He's probably in a little pain, and feels a little sad about the situation.  He will probably start to eat and drink again soon, but if he hasn't started drinking or eating by the next day you might have to take him back to the vet.<br>  <br>  Try giving him a treat that he really likes, and doing what you can to reduce any stress in his environment.<br>  <br>  I really hope your little guy feels better. :)|`|TrTfowAQaa	my rats play but never fight...but mine are all related females...so do you have the hurt rat separate from the boxing champ? if not I would. as for what wrong hard to tell... does he have a favorite treat like egg or cat food? mine love bugs :p i'd offer a treat to see if he takes it. they can go days without water (3 days I think) so don't worry so much about that...one other thing if he's old like 3 and up he might just be getting ready to make his grand departure (but I hope not) good luck I hope he comes around for you. call your vet he may have a better idea...|`|a315d4b46f075e0544a1da68a65bc218aa	Give your rat a little peanut butter I sure this will work
ntmsNk5Jaa	For one: DON'T GO TO PETSMART.<br>  <br>  They don't use correct bedding for rodents.<br>  Wood shavings can cause problems. and splinters<br>  <br>  Go to PETCO.|`|b6400b04a0e3413ba30570ad0aa8cd2baa	I think it depends on where you live but at my Petsmart guinea pigs are 34.99.  The closest Petsmart doesn't have bunnies but Petco does and they are 99.99. However they are already spayed/neutered and most of them are already litter trained since they have a litter box in the cage. I guess the best thing to do is check the individual store about the rabbit prices however i'm pretty sure that guinea pigs are pretty much the same price all over. Good Luck on whichever one you choose|`|CjW8DkoEaa	I agree with Mr.S, but, for me it's because of this video <a href="http://getactive.peta.org/campaign/petsmart_investigation" rel="nofollow">http://getactive.peta.org/campaign/petsm...</a><br>  and these pics<br>  <a href="http://www.petsmartcruelty.com/photo_gallery.asp" rel="nofollow">http://www.petsmartcruelty.com/photo_gal...</a><br>  these are real animals have feelings too, and if you buy from Petsmart they will just get more animals, and more animals will suffer. These are real pics, and that is real torture.|`|CACiIkS6aa	At my local petsmart, the guinea pigs are 34.99. The guinea pigs alone are pretty cheap, but it's the bedding, cage and food, etc that is the expensive part. If you are planning on getting a pet, make sure you are willing to pay the vet bills. A 30" by 50" would be a good size of a cage.<br>  <br>  The bunnies vary from 45.00 to 100.00, depending on their species. Rabbits are very jumpy, so take good care of them if you're getting one. Rabbits need a slightly larger cage, but you can always get those starter kits for guinea pigs or rabbits. They come with a small bag of food, bedding, a bowl , a cage and a water bottle. Hope I helped.<br>  <br>  BTW, don't put a rabbit and guinea pig together, because rabbit food does not have the vitamin C that guinea pigs need. Also, rabbits can harm guinea pigs with their hind feet.|`|bMnBDVQBaa	I am an employee of PetSmart so I can tell you :)<br>  <br>  Guinea pigs are $32.99.  Sometimes, on Pet Perks weeks, they are $27.99.<br>  <br>  We do not sell rabbits!|`|jzBzwBYaaa	I believe guinea pigs are $8-15, rabbits I'm not sure of. Probably more though|`|AA10790491	I'm sure you've heard this to death but have you considered rescuing a guinea pig or a bunny? Many animal shelters have these animals and they are usually better cared for and socialized than an animal you get at a pet store.

fLUwsXBiaa	I had a Calico Fantail, but he died from a disease. My fish went to sleep at night at the bottom of the tank. <br>  <br>  Maybe he's looking for food? Or, if you have lighting in the aquarium, the light is on at night, AND if you turn the heat maybe down a little in your house at night he might be like cold and the light is warm at night.<br>  <br>  I'm not sure, but he probably just likes to be up there. <br>  <br>  Maybe he's waiting for you to come on the morning, or if you have other fish maybe he's waiting to be the first one to the food in the morning haha.<br>  <br>  It doesn't seem like you should be concerned though.|`|Nzb5QmNXaa	Is it only at night? If so, then he just likes to sleep at the top of the tank. If it is also during the day, then it is either lack of oxygen or ammonia poisoning.
6ok6SKjxaa	My cat is the same way with me, I still love him though, don't get rid of her. Just ignore her, thats what I do, and eventually (atleast with my cat, yours might be differen't) he comes to me looking for attention :P Mine is very independant, and it probably is the same with your cat. Just let her come around you then try and pet her a few times, then let her be. Maybe getting a new cat, along with your current cat, might help. I'm getting a new kitten aswell, not just for my cat to have a friend, but looking for a nicer one that isnt independant and cuddly :3. My cats getting better with time. and about your cat hissing at guests.. I think they should do the same, ignore her and keep walking.

39a2d5e9bc3c417cbdc5ba33cb6386bbaa	Goldfish grow large and require a 20 gallon tank and definitely a filter.  They are messy fish and need their water to be over filtered to handle their waste.  They can live for 10-20 years if cared for properly.  They could live a few weeks or months in a bowl or unfiltered tank.  Smaller tanks will also grossly stunt their growth, which will shorten their lifespan.  Bettas should live 3-5 years.  Bettas do not live in puddles.<br>  <a href="http://www.fishlore.com/Profiles-Goldfish.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.fishlore.com/Profiles-Goldfis...</a>|`|b9Hqdf2Haa	unless this betta is in a 30 gallon tank on her own then absolutely not. goldfish need a lot of space because they are so messy, and can get up to 10" long. the absolute rule is 20 gallons for one goldfish, and 10 for each additional. but no they cannot live without filters no matter how big their tank is.|`|fLUwsXBiaa	No, you need a filter.

6be65543422b4937c27d1761a2ed50a0aa	I have a houseful of Siamese cats, and raised them for over 14 years. So, I guess I may be able to answer some of your questions.<br>  <br>  Siamese cats seem to have sensitive stomachs, and they eat too fast...so they throw up after practically EVERY meal.  I go through a LOT of paper towels, cleaning up after them.  I have 11 indoor, spayed & neutered, so I clean up a LOT!  I often ask them why they "bother" to eat, if they're going to throw up immediately afterward!  Of course, nobody answers me!<br>  <br>  Siamese cats are VERY vocal....they don't just ask for food, they like to "carry on conversations" with you.  One of my males "talks back / sasses me", when I fuss at him, or try to get him to move OFF of me!  He "grumbles" at me!!<br>  <br>  The average weight of a Siamese is 7-9 lbs, so it sounds like your cat is weighing about right for her breed.  If you're worried about her, you should consider taking her in for a blood test, though.  She's getting to the age that she COULD be developing any one or more "age-related" illnesses.  My 14 yr old cat was diagnosed with Diabetes 2 years ago, but has been on insulin twice per day, and he's doing fine.<br>  <br>  Some Siamese are VERY cuddly and loving.  Others are not.....and can be very standoffish.....Sounds like you got one of the "nicer" ones.  Be HAPPY about that!!  I have some of both........and the ones that ARE nice seem to be "one person" cats......for the most part!  They'll "tolerate" other people, but prefer one.<br>  <br>  The male (tom) that was father to most of my Siamese, died at 15 yrs.  He got very sick and nothing seemed to help.  It was devastating to lose him......but I have a lot of his "kids" still.<br>  <br>  As long as you take her into the vet for regular checkups, and make sure that she stays inside where it's safe.......she should live a long and happy life.  Some live into their 20's.  Just make sure she sees a vet regularly, for "wellness" checkups......and a blood test at least once per year........<br>  <br>  Hope this helps to answer some of your questions.......Good luck, and ENJOY Mimba, for as long as you can......Siamese are SPECIAL !!|`|OzNfhmaEaa	That's not normal for a cat (even siamese) to throw up like every other day (unless you mean like hair balls), I suggest you go see a vet.  I don't know what to do about getting it fatter, although that may be related to the throwing up.  It's natural for cats to be sweet, and that's not a problem.  I'm not sure how long she will last though, you could ask the vet if you go.|`|lNzhglLFaa	I have a wonderful Siamese kitty "Mr. Chubbs" and he is very clingy to me.. doesn't like anyone else like he likes me..  :)<br>  <br>  as far as the food issue... she might be allergic to something in the food you might try something with chicken or if your food has chicken try beef <br>  <br>  it could also be hairballs.. in that case you con go to the local pet store and get some laxatone <br>  <br>  and the age thing... Siamese are one of the longest living cats..about 20years on average... so i think you have some time to spend with your kitty :)|`|oDVx7nSxaa	Welcome to the wonderful world of Siamese!  They are really a different sort of cat - there are no others quite like them.  Many of them pick their one special person, sometimes to the exclusion of everyone else in the family.  They form very tight bonds with their humans, more so than any other breed.  They are extremely curious, and very smart. I often say that many people don't care for Siamese because they don't like having a cat who is smarter than they are ;o)  <br>  <br>  Siamese are a very long-lived breed of cat, and if well-cared for, usually live longer than their domestic short haired cousins.  So while your 13 year old is no youngster anymore, she's not exactly an ancient old lady either.  <br>  <br>  One thing you need to know about Siamese is that many of them are very sensitive to foods with corn in them.  If your parents are buying her a food from the grocery store, that may very well be the cause of her throwing up so often.  I have a big lynx point who cannot have food with even a little bit of corn it it - none at all.  It may be that if you get her some food without corn (and you probably won't find any at the grocery store - you'll need to go to the pet store) this will go away.<br>  <br>  Some Siamese are extremely skinny - they are the "modern" type, and never get over 6-7 pounds.  So it's hard for me to say if that's normal, or if she's too skinny.  At her age, many cats can develop a condition called hyperthyroidism.  The vet diagnoses it with a simple blood test, and it's easily (and cheaply) treated with a human drug called Tapizole.  If that's her problem, it will help her gain the weight she needs and help ensure that her senior years are healthy ones.

He gets all fidgety and jumps out of my arms :(<br>  I still hold him and touch him everyday anyway because he needs to get used to it. He lets me pet him now without moving his head away, and I can sit and hold him for a few minutes now without him spazzing out.<br>  <br>  When my grown dog was a puppy she loved being held.|`|AA11244754	Of course they do, they are just like kids for pete's sake, yes but it will take a while, he's only nine weeks old, so he's only a baby and the cartilage in his little ears hasn't formed yet|`|zWFJBlJZaa	All dogs love to be held.

If he could he would lay across my lap right now as I sit at the computer.  He is right by my side...like velcro.  I give him all the hugs and kisses and pets and sweet talk I can.  They deserve it.  My last Greyhound who just recently passed away was lovey dovey in different ways.  He loved when we would pet him but he wasn't so much into hugs.  He would just stand there and look away like "What are you doing?".  But we found other ways to make him feel loved. He loved his belly rubbed and to be brushed and his ears rubbed.  Try doing different things and see how she responds.  Definitely they love human contact.  As for her ears...Not sure about Boston Terriers but Greyhounds ears stand straight up when they hear food wrappers or squeaky toys.|`|B462BQYzaa	whethere a dog likes to be held and cuddled with depends on the dog, i have dogs who do and dogs who dont.  but you should still do it to desensitize the dog.  this means, sitting down for 30 minutes a day, touch the dog on the body, around the mouth and gum, feet, and paws, so the dog gets use to human contact, that way when the need arises that you need to let say trim ur dogs nails oe brush ur dogs teeth, the dog would not try to back away due to discomfort.<br>  <br>  the ears of ur boston terrier will start to stand up as the cartilage hardens, if the ears are larger than typical bostons then it will take longer, at 9 weeks, it should be up soon.|`|oZIWhhoNaa	Dogs have different personalities, you're dog may be the type that likes it, or maybe not.

Most dogs love to be held, kissed, and loved. But, if your dog shows any sight of discomfort or dislike, stop carrying it. Also, try to stay away form high places such as balconies when holding your dog. Some of them might get scared and struggle. Also, do not bother it when it's sleeping. Most dog do not like to be picked up when sleeping.|`|15L0veYnaa	It just depends on the dog if they like to be held. My dog prefers to have all feet on the ground! She grunts if you pick her up. I've seen other dogs that love to be cuddled. <br>  Concerning the ear question, once again, it just depends on the dog. Some stand up at 4 months, others at a year. I would say they should stand up between that time period,if they haven't, then they probably won't.
sUN7TVtzaa	ok first you don't hold them for about a week or two after you get them! that is why she tries to jump out of your hand.<br>  second you need to feed her about ten crickets every two or three days. she can't and won't live long on a diet of just mealworms. they don't have much nutrition and will not be sufficent enough for her to eat. you can give her mealworms as well as other types of worms but only about once or twice a week.<br>  some do like to be petted on the head but most do not really apprecieat it very much<br>  sorry if i should a little impatient i just want you to know some of the things you are doing wrong. we all make mistakes. if you fix these things then read up on leopard geckos a little more i think your leo will be just fine. enjoy owning her!|`|01nMRPHVaa	I really don't know if they like to be petted. Try seeing if they stay while you do it. I mean, she should leave if she dosent like it. <br>  <br>  How many mealworms? 6 or 7 is good.<br>  <br>  Just make sure you dont grab her my the tail. Like the poster above said, it will come off. Seems like you are treating it well. <br>  <br>  Good luck<br>  -MB|`|lT3Aqt1Caa	definately dont hold her by her tail because when they are scared the tails will detach as a defense mechanism. ive had my 2 for about a year and they do some times try to climb back up when being put back in the tank just try lowering your hand and letting her walk of. again definately do not grab her tail. i would also try alternating meal worms and crickets so she gets more vareity and all the nutrition she needs. as to how much to feed her, everyone does it alittle diffrently, just be sure to remain constant as possible with her feedings and you should be fine. good luck.

aizHCizlaa	First of all I can speak from experience when I tell you that a Shih-Tzu is a wonderful little dog that does not shed. How is this possible? They have hair, not fur. They do not shed and do not have dander and subsequently do not have the odor that most dogs have.<br>  <br>  They are fantastic companions and require a lot of love. They are lap dogs and will want to be with you constantly, preferably in your lap. Their greatest joy in life is being with you and are the most wonderful little loving companions I have personally ever had, as far as a pet is concerned. :-) The down side to this is that they do not exercise well as they are small dogs. They love to be taken for walks and will go as fast as their little legs will allow them to go. By the time your walk is done they will have taken 5 times as many steps as you have, so if you are looking for a more active dog, look to another breed.<br>  <br>  They are better suited to cooler climates than warmer ones as their hair will keep them pretty warm. You will need to keep them groomed as their hair grows just like yours does. This is something that my spouse and I do for our two Shih-Tzus. They look absolutely adorable when they get their little teddy-bear cuts.<br>  <br>  Vet bills will be present with any dog. All dogs require heart-worm preventative and the one we use is a topical called Revolution. It is about $15 per month per dog, if your dog is under 20 pounds, as Shih-Tzu tend to be. Revolution will also take care of fleas and ticks which will also help to keep your pup happy.<br>  <br>  In any event I have owned a few German Shepards, a Collie and even a little Heinz 57 Terrier. I never thought I would become as attached to a small dog as I have with our two little Shih-Tzu. They have been the most enjoyable of them all, by far. I realize that my response has been pretty one-sided in favor of the Shih-Tzu, but it is merited.<br>  <br>  I hope this helps you with your decision.|`|bJh1MesQaa	Labs are a great dog to have with a lot of people in the family.

If you can you would probably want to train it.  That's about all I have as help for you on this, sorry!|`|F4ptJH67aa	Well from those choices I will tell you:<br>  <br>  1. Labs are very energetic, smart, loving, and faithful. In addition, they need constant attention 24/7, otherwise they will begin to look for ways to entertain themselves by digging holes, chewing on wires, dolls, shoes etc...<br>  <br>  2. German Shepards are the 3rd smartest dogs. Also very energetic, amazingly smart (able to learn something the first time being taught something), loyal, and loving. Unfortunately, they shed A LOT of hair, but that issue can be minor if you comb it's hair after every shower, or if you take it to get its hair cut at the vets or local pet shop. As for training, this is by far one of the best dogs for that. Depending on the training you are refering to, they are by far the best. Like labs too, they need constant attention, otherwise they will also find ways to entertain themselves by jumping walls (if not trained well or not given much attention) and digging holes. They don't have a big chewing issue as much as labs, but during their infancy years (1 year and below) they, like all dogs, have a minor chewing problem. <br>  <br>  3. Dalmatians. On the plus side they don't shed a lot of hair. Also, they are very very loving and extremly energetic! On the downside they are the most playful dogs ever! They will chew, tear, dig holes, jump walls to escape, and even pick fights with other dogs. They are very jealous. They are smart, but arrogant. Difficult to work with (but not as hard as Husky dogs!). <br>  <br>  4. Last but not least, basengi. Don't shed hair too much, very energetic, aloof, and energetic. Although they are two faced dogs and should not be trusted with non-canine pets. They dislike water and are difficult to handle under aqueous circumstances. They have a strange way, too, of having things done their way. Although they don't bark. Also, difficult to train.<br>  <br>  As far as health goes. Labs have bone deterioration so a vet is recommended, also are its shots! German shepards too are at high risk of bone deterioration and arthritis. It's best to supply them around age 5 with Glucosamine vitamines to help them out. Otherwise they'll be walking around during their senior years with a wheelchair because of their weak geneticaly presidposed hip problems. Dalmatians are quite strong, but get sick easily because of their mischeavious behavior. And Basenjis have kidney issues, too, during their older age. <br>  <br>  It's fairly expensive to have a dog, but not as expensive as an actual human being. I'd say roughly about lets see: $30+ for food (depending on brand, if German Shepard the best food choice is Eukanuba) and if you decide to get your dog insurance (which is highly recommended for the first 3 dog choices, and also depending on the insurance plan) roughly about $10-$69 dollars, and for yearly vet check ups $10+ (also depending on the vet. Some places cost more than others and vice versa)  and then for its shots, which is a once a year thing, about $50+ (also depending where you go to). The vet check up is once a year as well as the shots (rabies is every 3 years). Then for snacks, for good deed treats, about $1-$20+ dollars. Thats an estimate average. There are other expenses, but those are the basics.|`|Wo0AWgYVaa	lab, damation etc...yes, it's short haird but when they shed, the hair is very hard to get out.  I have a Newfoundland and I find my double coated long hair brat is so much easier to care for than short haired breeds.  My daily grooming is 10 mins max (brushing coat, teeth and nail)<br>  <br>  I think you should consider a Newfie.  It's as friendly as lab and golden retriever, but it's more calm.  It's a working breed, so definitely intelligent (too intelligent sometimes).  Very gentle with children, has life saving instinct (the dog will be your children's lifeguard).  It's not coincidence Peter Pan's nanny dog is a Newfie.  Dalmatian could be a handful for first time dog owner.<br>  <br>  It does not have a mean bone in them.  My one is 8 mths old and has been home for more than 6 mths.  He has not chewed any furniture, any shoes, the most he did is steal my socks and made me chasing him (I think he thinks it's a game).<br>  <br>  And I am a first time dog owner too.  Once you have a Newfie, you won't want any other breeds.<br>  <br>  Email me if you want more info on this breed.  chris75works@yahoo.com|`|15L0veYnaa	I would go with a lab. retriever. They don't shed too much, are one of the sweetest breeds you will ever meet, and are very intelligent. Dalmatians tend to snap.<br>  As for guidelines/tips: <a href="http://www.newpet.com/quicktips/quicktipsindex.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.newpet.com/quicktips/quicktip...</a><br>  Healthy dogs should have vaccinations done at least once a year, price depends with vet. Anywhere from 20-80$ i would say.<br>  Please adopt. There are plenty of adorable lab puppies or adults in shelters that need loving homes. Plus the shelter will guide you through the ownership, and the dog will come spayed/neutered and with their shots.<br>  Good luck!|`|O8LiCt19aa	in my opinion, you should get a basset hound cause they're nice but you can't let them get fat but they're sssssssssooooooooooooo sweet!!! also, vet bills might be expensive, unless you take very good care of your dog|`|URusy62Iaa	I have a bichon and he's great.

They are so loving and barley shed( if they do!) They are intellegent and love to work and train.Dobes are energetic and not rough.but, after play time they settle down for a nap!<br>  <br>   Tips/ Guidlines:<br>  you should always have a bowl of water down and food(opitional).Make sure they have a comfortable place because Dobes are comfort orianted. Make sure you let your dog out every 2 hours or so to have excersise/potty time.<br>  <br>  House Set Up: <br>  Like i said, Dobes like to be comfortable, so let your dog on the couch. If you dont, then make sure you have a lot of doggy beds in the house.Make sure nothing is in the reach of your dog that can hurt the dog if eaten/chewed. Even if your dog is the best trained, dogs are still dogs. <br>  <br>  Vet Bills/ Vists:<br>  <br>  If you notice your dog acting strange, then you should really think about taking your dog to the vet.If you dog doesn't have any obvios sign of anything abnormal then about twice a year your dog should have a vet check up. Vet bills can be costly if it is serious. So you want to make sure you have the money if something goes wrong.

If you are looking for a family dog that will enjoy exercise, shed "in moderation," is energetic and loving, and trainable, I recommend these breeds:<br>  <br>  Australian terrier, Bichon Frise, Border Terrier, Cairn Terrier (like Toto in the Wizard of Oz), Maltese, Labradoodle, Minature Poodle, Miniature Schnauzer, Portuguese Water Dog (what the Obamas have), Sheltidoodle, Silky Terrier, Soft Coated Wheaten Terrier, Standard Poodle, Tibetan Terrier, Wirehaired Fox Terrier (like Asta of The Thin Man movies), or a Yorkshire Terrier.  <br>  <br>  You need a plan of where you are going to put the dog when you are not at home.  You will need a watering and feeding bowl, food, treats to train with, toys, a leash, a collar, and I would recommend a flea collar.  You will also need supplies to bathe the pup with.  Vet bills will vary - there is no answer to that.  It depends on what health problems your dog comes with/develops.<br>  <br>  BEST OF LUCK!! :)

This is a parasite.<br>  <br>  This disease has a habit of showing up when a fish has been injured.  The parasite attacks the fish, but can spread to healthy fish in crowded conditions.  The disease is very debilitating and in severe cases can cause long-term damage to the gills. <br>  <br>  Symptoms: The fish might have clamped fins, they may be gasping at the surface or swimming around with labored breathing. They may be lethargic and spend more time hiding. Affected fish might rub against hard objects and hold in their fins.  A whitish blue opaqueness might cover the skin, particularly between the head and the dorsal fin.  If the gills are affected, the respiration rate increases noticeably.  The later stages of the infection will give the skin a swollen appearance then fall away. <br>  <br>  Treatment: If the fish is fairly strong, a good treatment is to try a 3% salt dip.  (this is a great cure to this) Keep the fish in the salt solution until they roll over, then put them back in the tank.  For alternative treatment, and less stress for your fish, try a salt solution of 1% and let the fish swim in it for 10-15 minutes, then replace the fish back in the tank.  Their are medications available at the pet stores. Look there and follow the directions accordingly.  The parasites will die off if in the tank with no fish if they are left that way for 5 days.  You must still treat your fish!  Quick Cure works good for this issue. Quick Cure Directions: 3% salt dip, then administer Quick Cure for 3 days, doing 30% water changes each day before adding more medication. <br>  <br>  This was taken from <a href="http://www.goldfishinfo.com/ailment1.htm#chil" rel="nofollow">http://www.goldfishinfo.com/ailment1.htm...</a><br>  <br>  For more help, try tetra-fish.com/forums|`|WbWudqUvaa	"WHY are my fish scales turning colors and shedding?"<br>  You have fish scales?<br>  <br>  Probably illness, seek immediate medical attention.|`|shMphSRiaa	idk maby your fish is dieing or growing, try feeding it less fish food

zqVDJxUIaa	First of all, fish like to swim. In fact, they swim all the time! They won't get tired, so why are you worrying about a fish that swims back and forth? All normal fish do that. Think about it... If a fish only swims in one direction, then it would eventually reach a dead end (the aquarium glass)! <br>  <br>  Bettas need to be fed only once per day.

OrvTG44laa	I don't know about skunks, but I know a lot about ferrets.<br>  <br>   Ferrets are not cage dwellers.  They do need to have cages, for when they are sick, sleeping, over aggressive or if you can not watch them or if you have company over.  They also sleep about eighteen to twenty hours of the day.  Then they will need three to six hours out of the cage to play and excercise. <br>  <br>       A ferret will need a large cage.  They can not live in glass aquariums, as this provides poor ventilation.  Cages are usually in the hundreds, but can go up to the thousands.  They should have at a minimum two square feet and about two feet in height, though you should go bigger.  If you have a large dog cage lying around, that's perfect.  Large may do, depending on the brand, but extra large, giant or even colossal is preferred.  In the cage there must bed some form of bedding.  Some people use alfalfa.  The best kind is some old blankets and sweatshirts.  Ferrets love to curl up into something while they sleep and this is perfect for that.  Do not use pine and cedar as it is toxic.  You will also need a food dish, a water dish and a water bottle, toys, a hiding box, a liiter pan with litter(not clumping litter or clay litter, as these cause illnesses, and it must be very fine) which can be a shoebox and optionally a hammock.  You can also put tubes in there, as ferrets love these. <br>  <br>       Ferrets do not tolerate heat well.  Thier environment must be under 80 degress but above 55 degrees.  If it's not, they can die in half an hour.  They do need regular daylight, but do not leave the cage in the sun.  Because of thier temperature needs, it is best to keep them inside and not take them for walks.<br>  <br>       Ferrets are carnivorous.  In the wild, they eat small rodents and rabbits.  Many people say they can eat veggies, but that's not what thier bodies were made for.  Thier bodies were made for meat, and thier digestive system can't handle it.  It can end in health problems.  A good ferret diet contains about 30% protein based on meat and poultry and 18% animal fat.  There should be no more than 4% fiber and no more than 7% ash.  A good commercial ferret diet is Zupreem.  Dog food is not a good idea, as ferrets fed this will die of malnourishment.  Avoid diets consisting of corn or fish meal.  Regular meat alone is not enough as ferrets in the wild would eat the organs and the bones of an animal, not just the meat.  They will need fresh food and water daily.  The water should not be distilled.<br>  <br>       Ferrets require a lot of care.  Thier litter box must be cleaned out daily, and the pan must be replaced or cleaned weekly.  Every day, you must provide fresh water and food, and clean the bowls and bottles.  About every week or so, you must scrub down the entire cage, and change or wash the bedding.  The toys may not look dirty, but they should also be cleaned every week, or replaced.<br>  <br>       Ferrets have a lot of grooming needs.  In the Spring and Fall, they will shed, and you will need to brush them.  If you don't, they will go everywhere in the cage, and end up in the ferret's mouth, and result in a hairball, which they can't pass through as easily as cats.  They require bathing, but only do it twice a year.  Some ferrets hate water but others love it.  Hold the scruff of thier neck, and rinse them with warm water.  Than provide a shampoo made for ferrets or kittens onto thier back.  Lather them thoroughly , keeping clear away from thier eyes and ears.  Then rinse all of the soap residue out.  To dry, wrap them up in some soft towels and gently rub.  Afterwards, you can let them curl up into some towels to dry off more.  Ferrets need thier ears cleaned about every one to two weeks.  If the wax isn't cleaned out, they can easily get mites in thier ears.  You'll need to buy an ear cleaning resolution.  One made for kittens will do.  Put some onto a Q-tip and gently rub out all of the earwax and dirt.  Then softly dry out the resolution in thier ears.  They also need to have thier teeth brushed about twice a month, some times every week.  You'll need to buy a toothbrush made for kittens, as human toothbrushes are too rough.  You'll also need kitten toothpaste.  Rinse the brush, and put a little drop of toothpaste onto it.  Then massage thier teeth, and you're done.  Some will not like this, so reward them with treats at the end, and they'll get used to it.  Another grooming need is nail clipping, which needs to be done every two to four weeks.  Ferrets also may not like this, but giving them treats in the end will make it easier.  You can use a regular nail clipper for humans, but it must be very sharp, otherwise it won't cut the nail properly.  Cut a little before the red vein, which is also known as the quick.  If you're unsure, ask a vet or a local pet store to do it for you.  Pet store employees who are experienced will generally do it for free.<br>  <br>       Ferrets also must be neutured or spayed.  Male ferrets that aren't neutured may beco|`|339NqJ84aa	I have both.. rescued domestic bred pet skunk and 2 rescued ferrets.. ferrets are more energetic then skunks and ferrets seem to get into more things their not supposed to get into. While I do have both a skunk and ferrets, I do not let them roam the house together, simpley because my ferrets can and will bounce all over my skunk and my skunk wouldnt be very happy about that. Both get ample time to free roam my house (a ferret proofed and ferret proofing updated daily) and while its either a skunk under foot or ferrets they do all get along with my dogs and cats.

0B4plcLEaa	I breed parrotlets.  I wouldn't suggest putting two females in the same cage. They would most likley fight to the death. The person who said it is not to late to hand socialize is not exactly right. I shouldn't say she won't become hand tame...because with birds nothing ever goes as expected! Parrotlets are best tamed when they are young between 6 and 10 weeks of age. Once they become used to sitting in a cage and not being held, it is very hard to try and hand tame them. Small birds, like parrotlets, budgie's and lovebirds are very difficult to train once they get older and haven't been handled.<br>  Is space or another cage a problem? You could always get another parrotlet and put it in another cage near your bird and they could see each other and enjoy their company through the cages. Even though I have a ton of parrotlet breeders, I only have one as a pet. I have a little albino hen that I kept back, she is in a cage alone. I handle her daily, but so she is not lonley I have a cage next to hers with my lovebird in it. They play and chitter back and forth. They don't like it when I take one out and not the other. They don't play well outside of the cage together though. Parrotlets are fiesty and she attacks the much bigger lovebird! <br>  Most of the time with parrotlets, if their is no box on the cage, they won't breed. When I am ready for eggs and babies I put nest boxes on. When I give the birds a break or set up new pairs I take the boxes off and I don't have to worry about breeding. You may be able to get a male and not have to worry about eggs or babies. Their is a small chance she may decide to lay no matter what.  I have never had it happen but it doesn't mean it won't. Usually the box being on the cage is what spurs them to breed. Sometimes they don't need encouragement...they have a strong desire and breed wherever!|`|ec1d80b5105e09c381fb6e0b627016c2aa	since u don't handle her u might should but they'll be more nosiey and will tend to be a lot less tame.  If she was mine i would just take her to the vet and have her wings clipped and then u could hold her without worrying about her flying away from u or off ur hand.  My conure was well aware of his wings and though he's handraised and tame he would still fly into things (when i had him out to play on his house or playstand)  I was worried about him getting hurt flying into things so i got his wings done and he's a lot more tame and has accepted that he shouldn't fly.  He's molting and getting his flight feathers back in at the moment though so i'm having to debate whether i want him re-clipped.  It's really a personal choice and whether u think ur bird is happy.  Mine is happy being handled a lot and i like him being tame so i don't want him to have a friend or he wouldn't want me anymore.  Plus he's extremely nosiey and that would double if we got him a buddy. It really depends on u and the personality of ur parrolett.|`|zpMXhynkaa	No.  Parrotlets are very territorial and it is usually not a good idea to house them together. While you occasionally see it, it is best to keep them separate.  They require their own cage, and more importantly, they require interaction. Parrotlets are companion birds. They need out of cage time. They need training. They need positive reinforcement.  She fell behind your refrigerator because she wasn't clipped and was able to fly up to the top of your refrigerator..  She needs to go to an avian vet to have her wings clipped.  A correct clipping will allow her to glide safely to the ground, but will usually keep her from gaining any lift and getting into trouble up in high spaces. It will also help with training, as she will be less likely to fly away to where you can't reach her. <br>  <br>  It is never too late to try and hand socialize her.  You don't mention how old she is, but birds are very intelligent creatures and you might still make her a sociable companion.  If you are seriously interested in learning, there are many wonderful groups right on Yahoo! that deal specifically with parrotlets. Check them out.|`|sM6V9tjXaa	i would because your not handling her at all

If she does get milk, you've got to get info from your vet on drying her up because that gets really painful.  (It may not happen, I'm just telling you possibilities).  There are hormone treatments available but because they have severe side affects, they're only used in extreme cases.  She'll be back to her normal self soon!!|`|fgxajTiBaa	I'm fairly certain that I HAVE heard of this in a recently spayed female before. But honestly, I'd trust your vet over a bunch of strangers on yahoo.<br>  <br>  Fake pregnancy doesn't mean she's pregnant, it means she'll exhibit many of the signs of being so, but will not produce any puppies. Your vet 'might' be able to give you some hormones to end it.
BJGudd52aa	Depends on the species of shark :] They typically release very few (in the order of 2 to 130 or so), others maintain an almost mammalian-like placental bond to their pups, or in some other species, simply birth live pups. This differs from most of the Perch-like fish which will produce thousands upon thousands of fry of which only a very tiny portion will survive. The three types of Shark reproduction are classified as Oviparity, Viviparity, and Ovoviviparity - there is information all over the internet going into more detail of each of those. :]|`|Ik6WOcw3aa	Some sharks give birth to live pups.<br>  <br>  As always, you need to be specific here.

zqVDJxUIaa	A male fish has a pointed anal (bottommost and second from the rear) fin, shaped like a needle. A female has a fan-shaped anal fin, though it may be curled up.<br>  Fish anatomy:<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fish_anatomy" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fish_anatom...</a><br>  <br>  Keep one male for every two females, so if you have a male, get 2 females. If you have a female, get a male and one other female. This prevents the male from picking on the female, and will also prevent stress to the Platys.<br>  <br>  Breeding is very easy! You don't need to do anything other than provide the water. "Just add water and voila" applies to all Platies.<br>  <br>  Breeding them is like other live bearing fish. With next to no effort on the part of an aquarist, Platys will breed and have fry every 4 to 6 weeks. The challenge is keeping the mother from eating the fry soon after they are born. There are a couple things that can be done to save the fry. One is to provide plants for the fry to hide in. The other is to use a commercial breeding trap, which separates the babies from the mother when they are born. Of the two solutions providing plants for hiding places is the best option and puts the least stress on the mother.<br>  <br>  Platys are easy to take care of and will accept all types of foods. They are hardy and will tolerate a wide range of water conditions. <br>  <br>  The gestation period is normally between 4 to 5 weeks. After gestation a female platy can give birth to as many as 50 fry.<br>  It is in their nature as live bearing fish to eat the fry after the mother gives birth. This is true for all live bearing fish. As a Platy owner and breeder, it is necessary that certain steps are taken to protect the fry from the mother after they are born. The options for doing this are to either use a commercial breeding trap or provide plenty of plants for hiding places in the aquarium.<br>  <br>  There are several different styles of commercial breeding traps available today. Each one is designed to separate the fry from the mother when they are born. Usually it is done by providing a small space for the fry to pass through away from the mother into a separate area of the breeding trap. Breeding traps can be very effective at protecting the fry but they also tend to place a lot of stress on the mother.<br>  <br>  Using plants that provide hiding places in the aquarium is a good alternative to a breeding trap. This method will keep stress on the mother to a minimal amount. Some fry might not make it to a hiding place but the strong ones will survive.<br>  <br>  You really don't have to try all that hard to breed them!<br>  <br>  Good Luck!|`|xbyQAU4haa	I will answer your questions.<br>  <br>  1. You can tell your fish's sex by its lower pectoral fin. If the fin is triangular shaped, it is a female. If the fin is straight like a rod, the fish is a male.<br>  <br>  2. You never know if the fish are going to breed. They may not want to. What I do, is when you are buying a new fish, look for a pregnant female. How can you tell the fish is pregnant? That's easy. On the fish's lower stomach, you will see a black colored ball. That is called a gravid spot. There will be a lot of pregnant fish, because of the mixed sexes and overpopulated tanks. Platies and mollies have live birth. There are no eggs involved. What you want to get is a heated and filtered tank, probably a ten gallon, and a net. (if you don't all ready have one) Then, get a breeder box. You can find this at a pet store, I got mine at Pet Smart. They are only about seven dollars or so. You need a breeder box because the other fish in your tank will eat the babies. It has happened to me. When a fish is about to give birth, it usually swims around by the heater, and mine looked a little gray in the face. When your fish looks like it is about to give birth, take your net and put the fish in the breeder box, inside the tank. Wait and watch your fish. This might take a while, but pretty soon your fish will give birth. She will have a lot of babies. And I do mean a lot. Once you are sure your female is done, take her out, but leave the babies in. Let the babies grow until they are too big to get eaten. Crush fish flakes for them to eat. Some will die, and some will live. <br>  <br>  3. Good luck, and I hope you love your fish! If you have any questions, feel free to email me.|`|YedeC4D5aa	1. male- has an ovipositor, which is a seemingly a curled up fin looking like a rod pointing backward<br>  female- has a regular fin<br>  <br>  2. you need two sexually mature females and one sexually mature male<br>  you need to make sure that they have a 10 gallon or less tank, turn up the pH to about 7.3-7.5, and raise the temperature to about 80 F degrees. and see to it that the water is tip-top shape as far as ammonia (keep it under 1 ppm)<br>  <br>  3. Make sure that the male and females you get aren't torn up, beaten, or diseased. its hard to get interested in sex if you have a black eye, mutilated limb and cancer lol|`|ZJCbnlF3aa	1.

There isnt really anything you need to do to make them mate. Some live foods would help though.  Platies are live bearers and have live young so you will need to get a breeder box and put the female in it and so she can have the babies. They will eat the babies if you dont.**<br>  <br>  3.  You need 3 females to every male so the females dont get stressed. So you need atleast a 5g tank. Plus some caves and hiding places if the male gets too rough.  It should be easy!<br>  <br>  <br>  ><> Happy Fish Keeping <><|`|dafWVguKaa	you can tell a boy from a girl by their "anal fin". if you look close you'll notice the girl's will be fanned out and boy's will be longish and straight. breeding's easy peasy lemon squeezy, soon enough one will get knocked up, it doesn't require any effort, just try and keep 3 females to every male you add, and platies are live bearers, they give birth to swimmers, not eggs.|`|6faBN1OEaa	I just bought mine for 75 cents on clearence! First The males have a tale that kind of streches up and down and the female has sort of a straight tail. I don't think the female lays eggs. She has her baby born live like guppies. If she does have her babies live , the you shold get a hatchery that looks like this;<a href="http://rc.marinedepot.com/IMD/250/HG10931/HG10931_99.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://rc.marinedepot.com/IMD/250/HG1093...</a> because the mom eats her babies just like the guppies . so what happens is that the mother has her babies and then they slide down through the grille and are caught in the bottom compartment and are safe. Hope all this helps!
zqVDJxUIaa	THIS IS THE CORRECT ANSWER:<br>  Yes, you can put them together. No they will not fight. If you want to breed them, then you can separate the male and female using a see-through plastic divider. When both male and female are ready, you can remove the divider.<br>  For more on Betta care:<a href="http://www.bettatalk.com/betta_care.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.bettatalk.com/betta_care.htm</a><br>  Betta Breeding:<br>  <a href="http://www.aquariumfish.net/catalog_pages/bettas/betta_breeding.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.aquariumfish.net/catalog_page...</a><br>  <br>  Good Luck!|`|IrdZKYT3aa	Hello!  I am the proud owner of my own sorority tank!<br>  No, two females can not be kept together, you need more than two.  Generally it's suggested to have 3-4, I prefer the suggestion 4-5.  Having 2 means the dominant one will gang up on submissive one, possibly until death.  Having more means they can establish a hierarchy, and no one in particular is beat to death.<br>  I personally have 4 females living together with no squabbles.  I first attempted with five, the fifth female was simply to aggressive to be kept with other females.  You'll have to determine the individual aggression levels of the females you choose.  Some can be just as aggressive as a male.<br>  Best of Luck!<br>  any Q's feel free to message : )|`|39a2d5e9bc3c417cbdc5ba33cb6386bbaa	Angel's answer is correct.  Females can be together generally, but only in larger groups.  Three is the minimum.  There is still no guarantee the won't pick on each other.  A group of 5 would be good for a 10 gallon as long as there are plenty of plants and hiding places.|`|1YNhKzeqaa	It is not recommended to put 2 beta splendens in the same tank, regardless of the gender. If you would like to breed them you can put a male and at least 2-3 females in the tank together only for as long as mating them requires. <br>  <br>  Females are not as aggressive as the males, and some people have actually successfully kept multiple females in one tank, but the successful tanks I have personally seen were medium sized (20 gallons with at least 3 females) and had multiple hiding places and plants so they could have a rest from each other. Be sure to get more than two though. If you only get two, the dominant female will focus all the harassment on the other one, however, if you get more than two, the abuse will be spread out amongst the others.<br>  <br>  If you want to add some variety to your tank there are other fish that will get along with beta splendens, such as hypostumus plecostomus (assuming you have a large enough tank, 55 gal, they grow big), some cat fish (such as cory cats), and algae eaters such as otto cats. As far as I know most bottom feeders and algae eaters won't bother your betas. Neon tetras add a splash of color and are not known to nip fins (be sure to get at least 6 of them, they are schooling fish and love to be with each other), just make sure you don't get fin nippers such as danios, and don't get other fish with flowy fins such as guppies.<br>  <br>  One more note: beta bowls are sold at many fish stores, and many people keep them in these unheated bowls, they are tropical fish! NOT cold water fish, be sure to put them in a tank (bowls are just cruel for any fish really... you need 1 gallon per inch of fish, let them stretch their fins) and put a heater in the tank to keep the water at a cozy, tropical 72 degrees Fahrenheit. Also be sure to have proper filtration as well.|`|lZevLfjhaa	No, you can not!<br>  females can be just as aggressive as males. whether it is a male and a male; a male and a female; or a female and a female they should not be kept together.|`|8Ymsx4Oraa	Females are generally fine. More then two tho, more like six. They establish a pecking order. Although some fish are psychopaths so no matter what we say theres always a chance it wont work.<br>  <br>  Best of luck Angel|`|ZJCbnlF3aa	Absolutely!!! Female Betas actually prefer to be grouped together.  They also get along with all kinds of tropical fish.  I use to have one in my tank with 7 platies, 2 plecos, 3 brown khulis, and 3 neon tetras and she did wonderfully (died of old age).<br>  <br>  They ae smaller then males and are pretty easy to care for. I would recommend them :)<br>  <br>  ><> Happy Fish Keeping <><|`|e55cjnbJaa	LISTEN VERY CLOSELY AND READ ALL OF THIS.

GIPIjD2Oaa	yh dogs have a fettish for stuffed toys. just make sure your dogs gets enough excercise as its an energetic breed to stop it going further.|`|JfBzzXQ4aa	Pretty normal at my house!  My dogs think the stuffed toys are to be killed. But they would never tear up or chew anything else.|`|m81dfyOYaa	It's normal at my house. I don't buy stuffed toys anymore because the male (not the female) rips and pulls out the stuffing. He does like to run off with socks periodically but my furniture so far has been spared (he's 7 years old) and he hasn't done any damage.|`|p7swtBYzaa	4 out of 6 of my dogs do that all the time - they remove the squeeker and the stuffing, lay it out, then are delighted that they have "killed" the thing.<br>  Perfectly normal, just watch that he doesn't eat the stuffing, that's dangerous, can cause obstructions in his intestines.|`|AA11244754	A lot of dogs do that, I have a miniature poodle, and he has killed more "babies" than I can count!  and no it will not lead to him chew things that he's not supposed to.

Does he shake it back and forth?  He's trying to break its neck.  Why?  So he can eat it.<br>  <br>  God help you if it has a squeaky in it!  Then his prey is actually screaming in pain!<br>  <br>  Now, obviously the dog is playing, not eating - but the reason that dogs play is the same reason that humans play - to learn to interact with the world and to learn to do what you need to do, to survive.<br>  <br>  The dog needs to have a clear idea of what is his and what is not.  And if its his, then ... well, its going to be very heard to stop him from doing this.  I have seen one dog owner do it with a very intelligent dog ... but they CONSTANTLY have to remind him to be gentle with the toy, and yes, he occasionally forgets.<br>  <br>  Remember, Spot descended from wolves.|`|CJMhtM7maa	Yes it's normal.Around our house our 4 Pits love to pull the stuffing out,then tease each other with the remains.Hours of fun for them.It hasn't led to them tearing anything else up.They know if we give it to them it's theirs,socks and other things are off limits.|`|ZWGgRFZkaa	yes this is normal i have 5 big dogs and they love the stuffin from there beds am always buying new ones but it can lead to chewing up other things dogs will be dogs just tell him/her no if the dog does someting bad also i talk to my dogs alot and they learn so fast|`|3be3cdbc75192f1745ec8ef8d1ad5738aa	Yes i have a dog and they always do that when they are young. <br>  its just like when babies play the trowing game.<br>  the dog might even end up biting the edge of the sofa<br>  or if u have kids there toys.<br>  its best to get the a soft plastic chew toy.|`|0BjfEel2aa	One of my dogs Boss, only chews up soft toys like you said but, he doesn't chew on anything else. If chewing starts on furnature get a fomula and put it on it, it will stop.|`|0Lv8qL0Kaa	yes it is normal|`|O8LiCt19aa	yes dogs do that!|`|55N1AA7zaa	yh just make sure it stops at the toys and not ur sofa <br>  <br>  my staff chewd my sofa wen he was little =S
znGpjsGjaa	No rabbit should be sold before it is 8 weeks (2 months) old. At 4 weeks they still need their mother's milk. It is wrong to sell kits that young.<br>  <br>  At this young of an age it is hard to tell what sex they are. But a rabbit can become pregnant as young as 12 weeks. This is very dangerous and will result in the death of the doe. They are too young to deliver a healthy litter of kits and still survive since they are still growing themselves at that age.<br>  <br>  Does should not be allowed to breed until they reach 75% of their adult weight which is usually around 6 months of age. Bucks can be used to breed starting at 5 months but it is better to wait until they reach puberty, at around 6 months also.<br>  <br>  If they are walking like they are crippled then they are crippled. A healthy month old kit is more than able to hop and move around normally. Sounds like you got 2 very sick rabbits. If you bought them from a pet store- take them back and get your money back. Then find an ARBA breeder near you to purchase some healthy, pedigreed rabbits. You will be much happier in the end.<br>  These 2 sound like they are not healthy enough to make it very long.<br>  <br>  ARBA is the American Rabbit Breeders Association<br>  <a href="http://www.arba.net" rel="nofollow">http://www.arba.net</a><br>  ARBA holds rabbit shows every weekend all over the country. you should be able to find a show near you on the website.|`|meMF69tXaa	Just out of curiosity, why is this breeder selling kits this young? <br>  <br>  As far as breeding goes, rabbits can breed between the ages of 3-4 months. I do not recommend breeding rabbits this young but everyone is different. Also, of you are keeping your rabbits indoors, your females will stay in estrus longer than outdoor rabbits will. In other words, indoor rabbits will be fertile almost every day, minus pregnancy days.<br>  <br>  If you are considering breeding your rabbits, please do it for the better of the breed. Most breeders look for good quality in the doe and the buck. They also take into account if the doe or buck has genetic issues. If you are breeding netherland dwarf rabbits, you run the issues of having hippo kits and such because of the X factor gene that dwarf rabbits carry. Also, you do not want to breed a rabbit that has the condition called malclussion.<br>  <br>  As far as the "cripple" walk, there are conditions such as splay legs that can affect rabbits. However, some just walk like that at first until they get used to their surroundings. You need to have your kit checked by the vet to be sure that there are no deformities present.|`|Cp8Y0cHcaa	Only 1 month old<br>  <br>  They should still be with their mother,<br>  <br>  Baby bunnies need their mother until they are 8 weeks old, fully weaned off their mothers milk.<br>  <br>  If not they can die, as they need their mothers milk to grow a strong immune system, or they are very prone to getting ill, and their tummies are very sensitive to greens.<br>  <br>  I'd return them if i were you, or they'll have a short life.<br>  <br>  That person is very irresponsible.<br>  <br>  Normal for them to bit a bit wobbly, as they still have allot of growing to do.<br>  <br>  Females can fall pregnant 3 -4 months of age.<br>  <br>  You cant tell their sex untill their at least 8 weeks old.|`|xV57C37Aaa	They can become pregnant when they reach 2 years of age or sexual maturaty, and yes the month old rabbits are still trying to get a feel for hopping, so they would be a bit clumbsy,lol!|`|v1tePj44aa	One month is to young.

LazxXqXjaa	Older, spayed female dogs sometimes develop urinary incontinence - the reproductive hormones also act to maintain bladder tone in females, so the absence of the hormones can cause the leakage you describe.  The bladder relaxes during sleep, so you will often see urine spots on her bedding when she gets up - holding her urine while she's awake isn't as much of a problem as she has more voluntary control over her bladder muscles.  <br>  <br>  Your vet can do a urinalysis to make sure there isn't an underlying urinary tract infection and get a baseline on her urine values, and bloodwork can also be done to make sure her organs can handle the incontinence medication.  The most commonly used drug is called phenylpropanolamine, or Proin, and is available in chewable tablet form at a reasonable cost.  Bloodwork is needed every 6 months to make sure the Proin isn't causing more problems than its fixing.<br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|nlMfJtxcaa	Might be urinary incontinence. Your vet can make the diagnosis. It's treatable with a pill.|`|49ec8e0944023c0f5c20e37484f16366aa	She could have a urinary tract infection, spay incontinence is also a possibility.|`|lNzhglLFaa	if your doggie is getting older, it is probably bladder leakage... it is an unfortunate side effect of age.... so you could get some puppy pads from the local pet store, and put them in her favorite spots to sleep.. or you can get doggie diapers that she can wear when she is in the house
f5a8d99afbb73cd0703df99b87996901aa	Please have the cat spayed ASAP.  If she got out while in heat you can be 99.9% sure she's pregnant.  She can safely be spayed within the next 3 weeks. Her heat won't end immediately with conception.  For this reason some kittens of the same litter can have different fathers.|`|Lc9ucAMXaa	no.i knew my cat was preggers because she didn't go i heat. cats only go into heat when they are looking for a guy cat to impregnate them.|`|6LPxzVsPaa	When a cat is in heat, they are looking for a boyfriend to make love. They make weird noises in heat.|`|HXVaqUjXaa	Yes. The cycle does not end just because she was bred. She will continue this heat cycle even if she is pregnant.
