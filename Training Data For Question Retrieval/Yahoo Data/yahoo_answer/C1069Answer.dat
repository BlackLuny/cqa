nRSjUKJZaa	I think some celebrating should be allowed in football and in any other sport. Sports are meant to be competitive and fun. There are some celebrations that weren't needed like pulling the sharpie out and signing the football or pulling out the cell phone. But doing a quick dance in the end-zone I don't see anything wrong with that. When your team scores as fans we celebrate because were happy about it and as a player when they score they are happy about it also so celebrating it should not be that big of a deal. So I think they should be allowed to, just limited as to what they can do.|`|KNTofuxMaa	I think it's ridiculous. I am ashamed for some of these guys. Seems to me that there should be no place for this foolishness in professional sports. Taunting and showboating, in my opinion, show poor character. You would never have seen Joe Montana or Roger Staubach acting like they just won the Super Bowl after getting a first down. Maybe I'm old school. There is the old saying... Act like you have been there before and expect to be back soon.|`|m4yyCDNCaa	I think they are fine as long as they don't go too far. It's one thing to have fun and be excited for yourself and your team, it's another to taunt and be unsportsmanlike.|`|FHjZuEhQaa	"I think if you can do a good enough celebration that gets people to laugh or something like that its not bad. But some people just spin the ball. Thats creative if I were a player i would spend hours preparing for ways to wow the crowd with my celebration and if I could end up number one on Deion Sanders weekly primetime segment that would make it all worth while," Terrel Owens said to a reporter reccently on the subject of endzone celebrations.|`|RS3fjNboaa	I understand what you are saying, but those other sports don't have 300 pound guys ready to tear your head off if they get the chance. I like some of the TD celebrations, but some of them are just infantile.|`|3oUSroiZaa	My opinion of TD celebrations is that they are just thing players do in excitement when they score and they shouldn't be penalized for it unless it's the sharpe marker thing. I mean if you just scored wouldn't you do a little dance because your excited?|`|i0QzvbSnaa	That is not completely true, it is just that the celebrations in baseball are a little more in with tradition and basketball players would do all kinds of things except that they would be dancing while the other team was scoring on the other end.   As for being professional, how is it professional to have a bunch of throwing balls at batters and having cheap "hold me back - PLEASE" fights in baseball. Each sport needs to be individual and make itself appealing to its fans and what they like, that is the key. If NFL fans like dancing or snow angels, doing that helps keep them talking and happy. Not much different than Manny going behind the wall and making a call or taking a piss during a game.|`|m7BFxtBkaa	Let them celebrate. What's the harm? Live and let live man|`|TjttzpPKaa	Actually, they high 5 when they home run. That's celebrating. They go nuts when they win the World Series. Basketball players don't celebrate when they hit a 3 because they are busy running down to the other end of the court to stop the opposing team. It's not feasible due to the flow of the game. Football is different. Ever since I can remember a "spike" was expected after a TD. Yes, some of the younger kids get carried away. Like basketball players want to be like Mike, football players all want to be like Deon or TO. They carry it too far. Hey, I like some of the celebrations. "Mile High Salute", "The Dirty Bird", etc..But some are taken to the extreme. Moss, pretending to pull down his pants and moon the fans was tasteless and rude. I think he forgets who actually pays his salary? Those same fans who paid the ticket.|`|T0FTAeDoaa	WAS up KENDALL   I think that they should allow it, its not disrespectful and the players get 2 have fun playn|`|B5DDAvQtaa	Well for the sake of arguing basketball is a little more fast pace to celebrate dunking on someone or getting a stuff. Baseball they do there thing at the end (i.e. hand shakes, hip bumps, so forth).     There is so much emotion on the field that I think its enjoyable to celebrate. Not to say there isn't emotion in the other sports because there is emotion in all sports but I just think in football you have more of an opportunity to show it.     I actually enjoy some football celebrations as long as you are not poking fun at some on or the other team itself. T.O. going to the star is too over board. But Chad Johnson had some good ones. So did Steve Smith. I think the one the Giants defense came up with (shooting a jumper every time they got a sack) was pretty cool. Merrimans is signature. Just has to be tasteful. But who decides tasteful? Not me.|`|acibYHATaa	Have non|`|m0KleJrvaa	I think that they're great. Most people celebrate when they do something special.|`|14oEyPjMaa	i think they should be able to celebrate all they want, with a short time limit of course, you cant really compare it to making a shot in basketball cause the game doesnt momentarilly stop like in football. but some of there dances are pretty cheesee but its entertaining|`|jesjtp87aa	I found touchdown celebration very amusing as well as team celebrations amusing too.  I remember watching one game a couple of years ago just because Chad Johnson said he was busting out a good one.  The game was bengals and ravens so the game was crap I just waited for Chad.  Eventhough I don't mind seeing a touchdown celebration, some of these celebrations are becoming pointless.  I'm tired of seeing a special teams guy make is only tackle of the game that he only tripped the guy by the ankle, yet he runs twenty yards down the field to celebrate.  So in conclusion allow td stuff, get rid of celebrating every single play.|`|AA10896470	I'll say this, if you've made it to the end zone, with 11 guys trying to maul you, you deserve to celebrate. If the celebrations hurt the opposing team's feelings instead of firing them up, then tough.|`|rzkFHAEJaa	It's baby. Next a sports reporter will be running up to them with a microphone and they'll say, "gaagaa, googoo".|`|bed9746a7bf18f598324f858a93ae28eaa	love em|`|2wpPrmibaa	i think it is the form of expression of the players
Fuldt36yaa	wondered that myself.Wikipedia to the rescue:      The running score in each game is described in a manner peculiar to tennis. Scores of zero to three points are described as "love" (or "zero"), "fifteen", "thirty", and "forty", respectively. The origins of the fifteen, thirty, and forty scores are believed to be medieval French. It is possible that a clock face was used on court, with a quarter move of the hand to indicate a score of fifteen, thirty, and forty-five. When the hand moved to sixty, the game was over. Another explanation is that the scoring system was copied from the game sphairistike, which was played by British officers in India during the 19th century. That game's scoring system was based on the different gun calibres of the British naval ships. When firing a salute, the ships first fired their 15-pound guns on the main deck, followed by the 30-pound guns of the middle deck, and finally by the 40-pound lower gun deck.[citation needed]|`|yYQsfnVGaa	Probably they're going for something unique...|`|U7BkuEU9aa	It's just because saying "forty" is easier than saying "forty-five"...it's shorter and it just flows better...    Anyway, that's what I was told when I asked that exact same question a few years ago...|`|LD1qDUOlaa	Back in the day (way back, tennis is a very old game) they used to use the clock to keep the count of the score, as they had no dedicated score board.    So when someone would score a point, the hand would be moved to 15, another point to 30 and so on|`|E8dcbmwJaa	Back when tennis was only played by royalty and kings, the scoring was designed to confuse the average peasant so they wouldnt learn the rules (and whoop their royal butts)|`|j1BTIYcCaa	It is definitely a French system of scoring.|`|c2Xoghfdaa	Some people are just weird i guise[who named it the 'hot dog']?|`|2ieiGIhTaa	Good question.  I think the answer may be too dangerous for us to know.|`|LLeQyWGcaa	i think who ever invented it didn't know how to count but wanted a big score so they skipped a few in between.|`|7Q1dJoFzaa	Don't question it just get on board.|`|SLTlvqRlaa	its french... french are weird|`|7d96b4f24578cd2c4b4f5474341984afaa	Good question.  I always wondered about this as well.    I would guess it has to do with an OLD tradition, or maybe they couldnt count as well back then? lol    I wonder if anyone out there knows the real reason.|`|xnBbmCkCaa	I'm sure it has to do with where it was invented, which was probably somewhere in Europe, Britain possibly? Yeah, that system bugs me too. It doesn't even make sense.|`|XoYHF1RLaa	I don't watch tennis. There's too much moaning.|`|QJWn3GWOaa	It's just tradition, probably from when the scores were kept on a clock using the minute hand.    I do know why it's called 'love' though! its because the french l'oeuf means egg, and an egg looks like a 0! Thats where 'love' evolved from :)

WbUrwR2Haa	Well the soreness i can help u with    like when uve been doing chin ups pull ups benching or push ups for track or doing leg work like squats and such, ur muscle fibers are torn. To repair , consume good protein like pasta tuna chicken and protein supplements based on ur needs (gaining weight or losing weight)    If the front of ur legs hurt they may be shin splints     Do u go to HS?     If so, u may have an athletic trainer to talk to and all else fails talk to ur coach if u seriously cant even walk    Give more detail    Is this ur first time doing track ?|`|z7JsVzcnaa	It could be muscle soreness from the workouts.  Ice is your best friend after hard workouts.  Ice baths do wonders for helping with muscle soreness in the legs.  They're horrible, but you won't regret it the next morning.    If you have shin splints, ice them when they start acting up and take some ibuprofen.    Shin splints occur when the muscle along the shin isn't strong enough to handle the pressures of vigorous exercise.  To prevent them, add walking on you heels to your warm up routine.  20-30 yards should suffice.
ZmTwI9Bnaa	Match 1: Shelton Benjamin? C'mon! He should be fighting a bigger star. I say Kane. Of course he'll win though.  Match 2: Great idea, but should be much farther in the card. HBK will win.  Match 3: Replace Kofi Kingston and you've got a classic. And I don't think Evan Bourne should win. He's great talent, but not ready for a World Title run.  Match 4: God no. I am sick of diva tag matches. Melina vs whoever is on Playboy for the title. But yes, the good guys should win for once.  Match 5: Not bad. Should be Extreme Rules though. As long as Mark Henry doesn't win it back I agree.  Match 6: Ooooooohhhhh yeah. You are right about the winner, too.  Match 7: Get rid of Kozlov and you've got a match. And Kozlov wins!? The WWE Title!? This would completely kill Wrestlemania!  Match 8: It seems natural, but a very cool idea nonetheless. And of course Rourke will win.  Match 9: Batista? GOD NO. Not only would he spoil the match, but would ruin the the Main Event of Wrestlemania, and would take down Wrestlemania with it. Especially if he won.

q6zIQ12Paa	Not a Bad looking Card. I would probably put R-Truth & vladimir Kozlov in the Interpromotional Battle Royal and have Khali take on Kane in another Raw VS Smackdown Match and add MVP into the WWE Championship Match.     I would also probably add The Brian Kendrick & Ezekial Jackson to the Tag Title Match and make it a fourway.    I would also add The Boogeyman to the Battle Royal & have Umaga face Finlay in a situation where Umaga makes an open challenge & Finlay accepts.    The Match I would most be looking forward to would be the Money In The Bank Ladder Match|`|rJMZdp04aa	Good Imagination Kid.    Only Matches you got happening are Orton/Cena & Hardy/Hardy.

AWESOME|`|w173betxaa	Nope! Undertaker won't be in 2 matches. 14 matches won't fit 4 hours most likely. Batista won't return until Great American Bash to defeat Orton for the WHC. So this WM25 won't happen.|`|H7p09fL2aa	i like it  only that the whc match should be one of the last  and the brand supremacy should be last   since they would get more cheers being from texas|`|770573c4f38cca3bd501e926925bcf9baa	it's pretty good son|`|XieVq09Xaa	I like how you put Melina vs Maryse!It should be a winner takes all but then what belt would SD have?Anywho Melina would demolish her!
PSMsDalLaa	If the T-Wolves are that stupid, and they are, then that would be a good trade if you get Mike Miller.

He should be quicker and more alert cause he's playing like he just woke up.
KHeR3hGIaa	It will, and it won't.    The GPS functions will be useless if you aren't going anywhere.    However, if you get the HRM, that will certainly still work.  And if you have the cadence sensor and it's installed on your stationary bike, it'll work.  The cadence sensor also has a sensor that can pick up the back wheel turning (if you put a magnet on it) that it can use instead of the GPS functions.  That will work on a regular bike on a trainer, but probably won't work on a stationary bike.    Actually, that's all about the Edge 305 (which I have), not the Forerunner 305.  But it looks like the Forerunner 305 supports the HRM and the sensor too, so it's all still true.    But without the GPS functions, there's little reason to get the Forerunner if you don't have it already.  You could put a cycle-computer on your stationary bike (even the $10 versions from Wal-Mart), assuming that your stationary bike has a wheel that you can mount the sensor to.  But the problem is that it's speed doesn't really tell you much.    You could mount the sensor to your pedals and if you put in the right wheel size into the computer (you'd have to do some math here) it would read cadence rather than speed -- that would be more useful.  But you could just get a cycle-computer with cadence if you wanted to do that (but it would cost more.)    And heart rate monitors are easy to find for a lot less than a Forerunner 305 if you want that.|`|DOVbF4Piaa	No, you have to be moving for it to record anything.  Go the Walmart and get a Schwinn bike computer for $10 and hook that up.  Most stationary bikes have a speed and distance read out, but if it doesn't the Schwinn computer will help you keep track of riding time.  For the distance you are going to have to figure out the correct setting to use.    This may help.  http://www.instructables.com/id/Add-Cade...

zoB64Ymoaa	Major blow!! I read about it this morning! I think alot of people under estimate Tait. He is a very good bowler with a lot of pace. Hilfenhaus has a lot of potential. Siddle and Hilfy i think should still be taken over to SA just in case. Bracken should be used for just the one dayers i think. I cant recall seeing him bowl in a test for Australia!! Johnson will bowl excellent again.|`|LzkujA3Faa	The poor bugger just don't seem to recover from injuries, right? with Lee too ruled out of the tour, Clark's absence will further dent our hopes of winning.     How big a blow is this? Massive,IMO because without Lee and Clark in our side, we will have to go with an inexperienced pace attack with Mitch leading the attack. I bet that will be a bit of pressure on him.     I think Tait will do a fairly good job. Lets hope the fast pitches in South Africa will help him.|`|fsLMFIpgaa	I think he came back too early.

90CzwjCqaa	With the last game of the steelers you can c that they have no problem on d but struggle a little on offense. The cardinals on the other hand have been playing good ball from both sides for the most part. I'm thinking a lot of pros will be saying the cardinals take it, but the steelers are a tough team and it could go either way. My prediction is  21-24 Steelers take home another :D|`|rzkFHAEJaa	who's suppose to, who you want to, and who actually does, are all different things And although in theory you can tally up the facts and get everybody to agree, with what you feel should be the winner, that 3rd category can only be determined by playing the game.

AA10304847	The Cardinal defense can stand up to the Steeler offense, the question though is can the Steeler scary defense shut down the impressive Card receivers?     The Cards have several edges in this game, not only was Whisenhunt the Steelers tight end coach from 2001-2003 and offensive coordinator from 2004-2006, but Russ Grimm was the Steeler assistant head coach/offensive line coach, Mike Miller the receivers coach , Matt Raich a defensive assistant and Kevin Spencer the Special Teams coach. Talk about knowing your enemy. They know the strengths and weaknesses of alot of the Steeler players. Of course Tomlin knows this, but even so, it's making a Cardinal bet looking mighty good. Whisenhunt should be able to get in Roethlisberger's head to devise a scheme to minimize Hines Ward's impact (assuming he's able to play at 100%).    Consider this: Pittsburgh has played 2 of the top 7 passing teams this season in Indy and Houston and given up an average of over 20 points per game. Both were home games for Pittsburgh where their defense is off the charts, and more importantly, Arizona passes for close to 30 pts per game more than either. For these reasons, i'm leaning on the CARDs to pull it off.     The "us against the world" mentality is the other big edge for the CARDS, used to win the last 3 playoff games.....|`|acibYHATaa	whomever has the most points.|`|PMSSoTqNaa	My Cardinals are gonna own Pittsburgh!  im sooo happy the cards have made it this far  ive been a cardinals fan forever even though im only 15 but even i didnt really think they could get this far  CARDINALS IN THE SUPER BOWL BABY!!|`|Ah5KDMALaa	steelers by 21|`|hvFq2kIgaa	Pittsburgh because Cardinals have never beaten even 3 playoff games  until now and they aren't as good|`|jRi35KJHaa	Pittsburgh Steelers.

LGVrhTFTaa	I don't take any pitchers until the 6th round (Unless someone like Johan Santana falls to the 3rd round.) Pitching is the deepest position,and there are always surprise upstarts/sleepers that can be gotten during the season off of waivers.(Like last years' Edinson Volquez.) But,after I feel I have a potent starting lineup I load up big time on starting pitching+closers..Because 2 eleven game winners with 130 Ks is better then 1 twenty game winner with 220 Ks.And 2  closers with 30 saves is better then one closer with 50 saves.  Also taking lower end closers and starting pitchers lets you build a   dominating starting offence.And building a dominating offence has   dozens of variables;which would be tough to explain without knowing what positions you are picking.Like if you have the 1st,24th,and 25th  picks I'd go HanRam(the only truly great S.S.),then maybe a 2nd+3rd baseman..And if you have the 2nd pick,and Han Ram is gone I'd take A.Rod over Pujols because 1st base is so much deeper in talent then 3rd base.Basically just take the best available hitter,and focus on speed+power the 1st 6 rounds.Then take a starting pitcher,and a closer.Then take another hitter,or 2..Then take more pitchers+closers for several rounds,until you see the final offencive starter to complete your line up(there's usually a good catcher,or outfielder left around round 13..And finally just take more pitchers,and closers.    ~g0()d LuCk!~|`|kAznuRTIaa	If you have the first pick i'd go with a-rod or pujols. If not than i would try  to fill my infield out 1st than maybe draft a few pitchers. It all depends on when you draft. I'd also try to get a top tier catcher quick also. Pitchers are difficult to judge early on so I would get my infield 1st before any other positions.|`|BASZjJKbaa	I think other responses have included some good advice.     You league looks a little smaller than a typical league. I would definitely wait to grab pitchers. I would also wait to grab a catcher since usually the difference between the  1 fantasy catcher & the  12 fantasy catcher isn't that big of a gap. (basically if you wait on some of these positions, you can grab an average player to fill the spot while you are grabbing better players at other positions)      Before your draft, you should take some type of draft guide or list of top 300 players to use as cheat sheet. Maybe mark some of the players you want to target or the players you would want to have on your team (should be along the lines of "I am not taking top catcher Brian McCann with 7th round pick but I want a catcher along the lines of Jorge Posada, Saltamacchia or Chris Snyder so I will take one of them with 10th round pick if all the catchers are gone.   While guys are filling up their roster with each position...1st base, 2nd base, shortstop, etc. you are snatching up the power hitters in outfield or corner infield spots so you can kill in those categories or have trade bait to make a trade for power pitcher if you eventually need help in pitching)      Good luck and have fun|`|1SxkPTabaa	I'd definitely try to fill out the infield first. There are a lot of pitchers to choose from, so don't worry too much about not being able to grab one of the many viable picks. You'll be able to grab at least 2, maybe 3, great pitchers before you need to worry. I'd wait till the 5th or 6th round to pick up a starter.|`|xQFWjFyZaa	I want to get players from the weakest positions first. SS, 2nd, 3rd, and OF are my primary targets in the first few rounds. A SP will be something I pay attention to, but not necessarily go out of my way to pick one. I would deviate from those positions if someone like Pujols fell to 4-5 but it usually doesn't happen.     SS is becoming deeper every year, but there are very few stud SS in the game today. Hanley, Reyes, and Rollins are your top SS. Young, Jeter, A. Ramirez, Theriot, and Drew are good. After that, the position is mediocre. 3rd and 2nd are even more limited.

CBVlu3Gvaa	This was asked and answered yesterday  Same answer today:    Speed control only comes with a lot of practice...I wish there were a magic pill I could recommend...but that's the way it is. Reading a green is almost a science.....It also comes from just putting balls to get a feel of what the breaks will do.....What I am saying is practice. Practice. Practice.    The only other alternative is a lesson on putting from a teaching pro.....tips and articles and videos are only going to give you so much.....at some time you just have to bite the bullet and do something different.|`|eROd0mRDaa	i dont know about golfing|`|GW7pWIlXaa	speed depends on the particular course on the particular day..the ball rolls faster on some days and slow on others...you have to learn to adjust your putting stroke..the way i decide is while i warmup..i can tell if the greens are rolling fast or slow i then base my putting off of that..if im wrong i change it up after the first one..    To read a break takes practice..see how the green is sloped..usually if there is a gully or water infront of the green the ball will generally roll towards that due to draining purposes..    Golf is totally a mental game and really the only way to get better at it is to practicee..you cant go out one day and expect to be a pro..you will have your good shots and your bad you just have to go out and practice..practice all your shots, but spend more time on the ones that are more difficult for you (like putting) the short game is always the hardest and takes the most work to get good at it|`|wgWbm2zUaa	Plan on spending at least ten minutes putting on the practice green.  This will give you a feel for how fast the greens are for that day.     One thing that helps me a lot is watching how the ball rolls on the green when I chip the ball up onto it.  I also try to see high and low points of the green from the distance.  This helps a lot in seeing all of the major hills and valleys that may not seem so obvious once I actually stand on the green.      Plumb bobbing is a great technique to learn to help you visualize which side of your putting line has any break.      You should also watch to see how the ball rolls for other players in your group.  I tend to stand behind them as it rolls just to get a better feel for how the ball will react when I am putting.|`|5wfOhw6maa	Most golfers focus way too much on reading break in greens, and not nearly enough on gauging speed. If you don't get the speed right, even if your line is reasonable you will miss, and likely by a lot. In the end speed is speed, and speed determines line too. Focus on speed and the rest will come.     Watch this video on putting:   http://www.hitdowndammit.com/video.htm|`|wYGeg0QRaa	The key to putting is like so many say here is speed. To acquire the proper speed you must have good feel. To get good feel I would suggest that you practise putting with your right hand only for awhile. Hit putts from different lengths and you will soon acquire some degree of touch when you return to your two handed stroke. Reading greens is an art that is learned through your powers of observation. When you are putting make sure you watch the roll of the ball and how it reacts when rolling on left to right and right to left sidehills. Uphill and downhill putts also react differently so pay attention to what is happening. Start a routine of practising on the putting green before you play paying particular attention to hitting 20' putts. If you can feel the speed from 20' you'll be able to handle the rest of your putts and soon become respectable on the greens.|`|dSKjqYshaa	Firstly the stroke speed stays the same.Try and keep your back swing "low"and "slow"and follow through as a normal shot.ie.keep it in context with your swing as you would a chip or pitch.Even try to envisage yourself rolling the ball.Go to your practice green (with 4/5 balls)and  start from 1foot away with your balls circling the hole.Putt 10 in a row trying to get a good Feel for your putting stroke.Think of a pendulum.Then move out to 2 feet and repeat the process.and so on till you feel more comfortable and then putt at random distances.As for reading the line of your putts look for any slopes or contours on the greens which may cause the ball to roll towards the hole and away from it.Pick a line (a spot 2/3 feet in front of your ball on the line you think the ball will roll)and try to visualise the ball rolling along that line into the hole.Be POSITIVE that you picked the right line and be CONFIDENT in your putting stroke.Then let it rip.If you find this hard to do to begin with,imagine a circle 2 feet around the hole and putt your ball into that area.Thus leaving yoursef an easy 1/2 foot putt that you have practiced over again on the putting green.Good Luck|`|GsSLGgicaa	Reading the Break of the Greens    Reading the break of a green is an art and a gift. It all seems so simple  you look at the ground and decide which way the surface of the green tilts, and then you adjust the line of your putt accordingly.    Sometimes, however, the break and slope can be tricky to see. Sometimes you may face more than one break in a putt. Sometimes a nearby hill affects the break. Sometimes the green naturally breaks toward water. It takes patience and imagination to envision the path the ball may naturally take as it rolls along. There are, however, a few ways that you can help yourself read the break  clues that help you forecast the way the ball will roll.  Examining all angles    Don't hold up play, but do look at the putt from all angles. As you walk up to the green or while the other players putt, move discreetly around and look at your putt from behind the ball and from behind the hole back toward the ball. Look at the putt from the side. If you can, get down low and look at the ball from a worm's-eye view. (You can do this easily on raised greens or from bunkers.) The more information you can process, the better the result.  Closing your eyes    If you have trouble seeing the break, stand with your hands at your sides and close your eyes. You can stand at the hole and do this or stand behind your ball and do it. Closing your eyes causes your other senses to come alive to maintain your sense of balance. You feel yourself being pulled by gravity one way or another and your body naturally corrects that pull. Take these clues to heart.  Spilling a bucket of water    To help yourself read the break of a green, you can stand at the hole and imagine that you've spilled a huge bucket of water on top of the hole. Which way would all that water run after you fill up the hole and it overflows? Would it run off the front of the green? Would it stream to the back or off the side? Adjust your line accordingly. If you have trouble imagining, don't go for realism and dump water in . . . unless you think you can outrun the greenskeeper and the cops.  Looking into the hole    Looking down into the hole can provide a sloping clue. Because a plastic cup lines the actual hole after the greenskeeper cuts it, you can see the discrepancy in the earth that rings around the top of the cup if the hole sits on a rise or a hill. The side with more dirt is the lower side of the hole, and the side with less dirt is higher. Therefore, if you putt the ball toward the higher side, it rolls and slides down toward the lower side.  Watching other players' putts    The break of another player's putt isn't proprietary information. Pay attention to your playing partners and competitors when they putt and watch how their putts react to the break of the green. Sometimes you get lucky and someone has the exact same line as you. In the 2004 Masters, Phil Mickelson caught a break when Chris DiMarco's bunker shot rolled behind his ball, giving him a great view of the break of his winning putt. But even putts stroked from another angle can tell you something about the beak of the green.    Although it isn't against the rules of golf to stand directly behind or directly in front of another player (beyond the hole) on the line of his putt, players consider it bad form and inappropriate. The player may ask you to move so that you don't distract him. You should, if you want to look from directly on the line, wait until the ball leaves his putterhead to step into the line.

FxObqmGFaa	I would say that Ba Gua can be developed into an effective street defense form. However, you would probably be better off in Kajukenbo, Wing Chun, or Jeet Kune Do for pure street survival tactics in the short run as Ba Gua IS an internal art and would take a while to master for effective self defense. The characteristic aspect of Ba Gua is its circle walking practice and that is used as an exercise (part of a form) and is used to practice your movement in fighting. Also there is an extensive use of palms and all of the different palms and aspects of fighting are categorized into animals and trigrams. Unlike Xingyiquan which is explosive and very linear, Ba Gua stresses movement around an opponent and shifting angles of attack. There are probably locks and grappling involved in it, but as far as i kno, palm striking is emphasized. hope that helped =)|`|6QrnOBZVaa	A great Bagua practitioner is Erle Montaigue.

9d792c6e2da6e5b53a036baec7115b43aa	Villa are learning fast. They may not be playing that well in certain games but they still manage to get the results. They are also playing better against the so called big four. They have developed a winning mentality and are hard to beat. They also seem to have a united dressing room. Arsenal on the other hand appear to be in some disarray if press reports are to be believed. Their defence does not seem to be on the same wave level and they look like they can leak goals at will. I think it would be good for the game if Villa could break into the top four. Bear in mind also that Villa are only a point behind Liverpool and Chelsea neither of whom are performing particularly well. Who is to say that Villa could not finish second or third!|`|7Tw7s6HSaa	I think Arsenal will finish 4th, the usual top 4 with the usual top 2|`|5YKMYcxWaa	5th atleast. wont be fighting for the 5th if aston villa do keep their luck up|`|gPvOcB6oaa	Fingers crossed|`|AA12370193	fighting for 5th? no  5 points are nothing to make up with 15 games to go|`|kxMQXhuAaa	If Arsenal don't qualify for next season's Champions League,i think Wenger will walk.|`|gpNIG15eaa	Arsenal may as well finish 6th behind Everton.|`|XzScEyQZaa	Could nay give a flying toss.|`|tNfjre0Laa	THEY WILL FINISH 4TH|`|hlKEZAp6aa	come on villa, or everton. would be amazin to see a different top 4 this year    claret and blue 4ever.|`|569220f4bb3c501027a6a6fe7ba2bb28aa	Arsenal is better than both Villa and Everton.

No one below 6th is safe from the drop, but I think despite their struggles so far and with the new signings, City should finish comfortably above the relegation zone.
l4WEwTWwaa	You'd be surprised how much longer you can keep your hair when you have tens of millions of dollars tucked away. Remember rich people and poor age differently.
VKSnvr7Yaa	Yes. They definatley have the best pitching rotation out there. And if their offense can get going they will win the NL West handedly. (I predict them winning around 90 games.)|`|PkCqIfMFaa	No they don't. There 1-2-3 is weaker than several. Not much elseto say. They have a very strong 1-2 but after that, it is just a mediocre staff.|`|0e3d21f52ae8d3a44a6dd71d8d2fbeafaa	hell no. webb.. overrated. davis.. just a sob story becase he had cancer. haren.. moderate not great. sherzer.. a joke. garland.. the best one there. but one guy cant save the other 4|`|JSXzVQM2aa	nah|`|c6q3EERdaa	They have a top 5 rotation, but they do not have the best rotation.|`|d9755b1afe952617603d01f2e4c6acb1aa	um no the  Giants have    Tim Lincecum - defending NL CY young award winner  Matt Cain - promising young pitcher  Randy Johnson and Barry Zito excellent veterans  Noah Lowry or Jonathan Sanchez will be the 5th man but Lowry is better he led the Giants with 14 wins in '07 he was injured all of '08|`|uh2bkRrFaa	Not remotely.|`|PJF4J3iYaa	hell no...but it will be good enough once they make the playoffs to win the world series!    cubs and yankees have the best rotation hands down|`|DjjCvjlnaa	Nope. Yankees does. CC Sabathia, Chin Ming Wong, Aj Burnett that beats those 5 already|`|gwUq6HMUaa	No, teams like the Yankees and the Reds ox have a lot better pitching rotations. Also, I would rank the Dbacks about 5th in the league when it comes to their pitching rotation.|`|5e1843a800af8a0c4fa0753cee310ddbaa	I disagree, the Chicago Cubs do with Big Z, Dempster, and very hopeful Jake Peavy.|`|5xIroQjMaa	Webb is superb, and Haren is a young stud that's only getting better. After that though, there's not much for Arizona. Don't get me wrong Garland is a strong pickup and with him, Arizona has a very strong starting rotation, but compare them to Tampa Bay or Boston, and I think they fall a little short. They're definitely in the top 5 though, but you could make an argument that even the Mets and Cubs have better rotations (Personally I'd say that Arizona has better than either of them, but just saying it's not totally clear there.) Even in the NL West, the Giants might have a better rotation, if not on paper. For my money, Lincecum/Cain is every bit as good, if not better than Webb/Haren. If Zito turns around and Lowry comes back, the Giants will have a stronger rotation. But those are two big ifs.|`|QASHySUbaa	i dont want to say this  buy yankees|`|iz5zDFxvaa	No, because there are others teams who have better rotations than the D-backs.|`|B5BWocvZaa	no man, hate to break it to you, but there are a lot of better rotations. the red sox and the yanks are the best. u might have the best 1st an 2nd starters in the NL but AL is better when it comes to pitching
YAvcW83Paa	I've purchased an intermediate sherwood Int wood stick in JUST ***$75***.    If you are intreasted to buy one. You may visit to :     http://stores.ebay.com/GreatHockeyDeals    They are selling all the Ice hockey products in very reasonable price.    I often use this store to purchase any hockey item.    Good Luck!!|`|DbfG5Cpraa	That's a nice stick.    Well, it's hard to say when someone should move up to senior sticks. Everyone has their ways. Generally, if your sticks seem to break a lot more than often or your stick just flexes way too much on slap shots you could move up to an 85 flex.    The best stick you could get for around $120 would be the NikeBauer One75, which i found at Pro Hockey Life in Canada.  If you live in America, you could order from totalhockey.net. The highest quality stick for around $120 is either a Warrior Dolomite, RBK 9K, Easton S11 or Easton SyNergy Elite.    Oh, and a Pro Stock stick is a stick made for a pro player, most likely an NHL player, with their preferred curve, lie, length, toe shape and flex. Some players like to curve their own sticks, but I wouldn't recommend it. The Pro Stock sticks are also more durable, and, most times lighter.|`|GMFofYZ3aa	Look on hockeymonkey.com all there stuff is really cheap. And their stock is amazing.

q3flRI9iaa	I've actually got better and faster at swimming after taking 8 lessons at the Y. It helps with form, timing, breathing, etc. While a few lessons can't get you to be on a swim team (let alone Michael Phelps,) it definitely helped me improve my swimming.|`|V5xHaIAcaa	I am too embarassed to give times.  Since I am 60 years old, I hope you cut me some slack.    Here is the good news.  My times increased over 10 percent, with with significantly less energy expended.  So I guess what I am saying, is that swimming lessons helped improve my EFFICIENCY.  And that is the whole point, I thought, for taking swimming lessons.    Best of luck|`|19JRf8Cxaa	Lessons don't really help you swim fast. They mostly just help to keep yourself from drowning, and learn how to save yourself if you ever are drowning.

GBzz7Wkzaa	If there was no wind then a lighter ball is your choice    A light ball will not cut through the air as easy so it needs some mass to do this. (imagine trying to throw a volleyball made of paper).    Now if the ball is too heavy than you will not be able to make it travel far:  newtons second law of motion says F=ma.    If the ball mass is huge than your acceleration will greatly reduce if you hit both a heavy ball and a light ball with the same hardness.      Conclusion:    Your project should include a series of EXPERIMENTS.  Mass (weigh) different balls and then try to serve them consistently the same way.    Then take their circumference and calculate their area.  divide mass over area for density.      Hit the balls as far as you can in different areas. (ex. inside and outside) and see the different effects that still air (inside) and blowing air (outside) have on the balls.  You will find that density has an important role in it's distance.      Good luck, any questions feel free to ask.|`|ldLxcKW8aa	start out with light, then go to beach volleyball, then switch to normal. then if you really want to test yourself, serve w/ a setters ball. HARD!|`|RnkOEzGuaa	It probably doesn't even matter how heavy the ball is if you can't even serve it over. I've been playing for a few years now and from my experience it's all about the upper body strength.     If the balls heavy, it's heavy you're just going to swing harder, so yeah maybe it'll help, but in the long run it's not going to help you find control. If you want control and to serve the ball further, just do push ups daily and maybe even start lifting.|`|DFaVrzBGaa	personally the ones without the like leather skin are easier to serve i think but ive been playing for 6 years i dont think the wieght of the ball have anythjing to do with it!|`|3d06f7ff58add9d6952dcbf43fd5f48caa	It's proportional to the force you hit it with. If you're a weaker server, a lighter ball will go further than a heavier one. If you're strong and can hit it quite hard, a heavier ball will go further (it will gain more kinetic energy because its mass is superior)

AA11528760	Well, he IS coming back. But, with so much hype (created by us - the pro-wrestling fans) about his return at Royal Rumble, it was the right thing done by the WWE to not bring him at the Rumble, or else the WWE would've been labelled as very predictable.   When pro-wrestling storylines are created, about 2 or 3 plans are also created about how the storyline will proceed further. In this "Jeff hardy attacks" storyline, Christian was the culprit according to Plan 1. But looking at the all the hype about Christian's return at the Rumble, the WWE went ahead with Plan 2 & brought in Matt as the culprit. And, Plan 2 turned out "unpredictable" for majority of the WWE fans.|`|F3VjJAdiaa	no it's real about him coming back to the wwe. it just hasn't happened yet.|`|nzKo4TFvaa	no never|`|PyJ3PMRnaa	Unfortunatly, no...|`|SOuezSW2aa	yep|`|0Dm3WEMcaa	Well Dixie Carter has said in an interview he has really gone back to the WWE so i wouldn't say his return is a online rumour it was more when that got confused. Christian was taken out on TNA around the same time as the attacks started on Jeff someone has clearly made a link between the two even if it wasn't really there. a case of 2+2=5 but i do expect him to return unless Dixie lied to an independent newspaper and what would be the point in that?|`|7f2GSDmqaa	I think hes returning to WWE, its just too many fans knew he was Jeffs attacker and WWE wanted to keep people guessing, so they went with Matt instead.

Watch for the warning signs:  They want you to sign a contract for instruction.  They guarantee you a black belt in a set amount of time (in a real dojo this can take from 7-10 years).  There's a lot of really young looking black belts.  Check out their testing fees - you shouldn't be charged more than $35-$50 for a test, regardless of level.|`|9ZwFQadRaa	Give it a shot.

One thing to deal with schools are to be careful with the contract, and if they try to sell you a black belt contract or some crap like that.    Make sure that they do a proper sparring sessions and not just touch sparrings.  Also, be very very careful, as website might list instructors name but they might not be there at all instead just lend their name to the school.    Good luck finding the school.|`|2baYnAokaa	The karate (shotokan) is kept separate from the other arts and they don't claim to be an MMA school (usually not good with its popularity) but have many martial arts in a location.

I have seen a new phenomenon happening where many traditional schools come together to survive against McDojo, mma gyms, and the like.  there is no way to say that this is definitely a mcdojo or not.

The credential they list makes them look good. But that is what a web site is supposed to do. I have a couple of concerns. It looks like a cash cow. There gallery is full of picture of mostly children. Do they have any adult classes?     With as many years of experience that they claim they should know that Judo came from jujitsu not jui jitsu.    It appears as though the children are enjoying the class. That is a good thing.    With so many different styles I would hope that each one has their own training room. I don't know how they can schedule al of those styles in 5 days and expect you to train a minimum of 3 days a week unless each style has its own room.    I can imagine their overhead is high. Therefore to maintain a business their prices would also have to be high.    You can start by visiting the school. Visit each class. Ask a lot of questions. Then decide if this is the place for you.

w173betxaa	No DQ- is a match has few weapons used.  Extreme Rules- Involves Tommy Dreamer or Jeff Hardy all the time and has a lot of weapons.  No Holds Barred- Anything Goes- This includes illegal moves like when Undertaker's Gogoplata was banned but they dropped the storyline.  Belfast Brawl- A Street Fight involving Finlay  Hardcore- Extreme Falls Count Anywhere Match|`|rJMZdp04aa	No DQ , No Holds Barred , & Belfast Brawl must be won IN the Ring.    Hardcore & Extreme Rules - Pin or Submission may occur ANYWHERE.|`|7f2GSDmqaa	They're all the same, just different names|`|hNIyshmkaa	No DQ is just no DQ, but I'm pretty sure there are countouts.    Extreme Rules is basically a hardcore match.    No holds barred = no rules except pinfall/submission.    Belfast brawl = extreme rules with Finley    Hardcore = pinfalls/submissions count anywhere, no dq, no countouts.

qixdmJ5raa	It is possible to have a gift in tennis. I am also a quick learner, as well as i am a natural at every sport.(exept basketball, hockey, rugby and soccer) Tennis is my favorite sport though. The gift all by itself is NOT enough to get you by. You must also practice, just like others. I do so myself. And i am still at intermediate.(exectly where i was at when i began playing.) However, i signed up for the tennis team two days ago. :D I am on the "Team" but i am not Varsity or J-Varsity. The tryouts for those are in late march. The coach has set up time for us to practice between the Tenth of february and the first practice, which is around the time of tryouts.   If you dont make the team, oh well. Just work had at tennis so you can make it next time. If you DO make it, tell me all about it. I am in the same position as you.    What you should do , is study as much tennis as you can between now and tryouts. Read about kick-serves, twist serves and any other serves you find.  READ HOW TO DO THOSE. Then try them out BEFORE tryouts. Also, if you have a raxket and a ball, bounse the ball on the racket to gain more ball controll. I do this all of the time. I also have good accuracy, meaning i can hit the corners without them going out.     Practice putting spin on the ball. Also, develop as good of a serve as you can before then.     Good luck, i hope you make it.    -Sk8terdude.

But most tennis players do have a certain knack for it. You could probably try out, just tell them you have not played tennis before but you are willing to learn. They should be okay with that. All of the great tennis players had to start somewhere :)|`|AbDAdrXkaa	I think people do look at Roger Federer...he was dominanting and still dominanting =)  Its not too late to start playing tennis....you should really practice first than try out because your body has to get used to the movements..when you start playing tennis you get used to it and you wont be scared anymore =) I'm also 13 and i been playing for 5 1/2 years and still sometimes its fustrating lolz|`|TR0JgiVZaa	you can make it i made my team after only playing for about 1 month and i go to a highly competitive school but you must work very hard.

uh2bkRrFaa	LOL. You don't know much about baseball, do you?    First off, if that was a possibility, why in the world would the Dodgers do that? They get an over the hill player with a big contract, no power who is not a clutch hitter - they give up the best clutch hitter in the game? Why, why, why would the Dodgers do this? What would they have to gain in any shape or form?    Manny is a free agent. The Dodgers do not own the rights to him to trade.|`|1yuUIN9Aaa	Manny is a free agent so that trade makes no sense..|`|gwUq6HMUaa	Well, first the Dodgers would have to sign Manny, but, if they were to sign them  they would NEVER sign them because Manny is a beast compared to Randy Winn. Also, they are in the same division and rivals so that only makes matter worse for that trade.|`|PJF4J3iYaa	the giants shouldn't throw that kind of money around after what they have done with zito and rowand...manny would be the next barry bonds there, and i mean that in a bad way|`|4TgxrCX4aa	Besides the obvious that Manny is a free agent not currently signed to any team (and would not require a trade nor could the Dodgers trade a player that's not theirs), that would be an awful trade.    While that's a good batting average, it's not great and the other numbers are far from impressive.    Comparing the two (whole season, numbers for Manny are better with LA)  Winn - .306 BA, .363 OBP, 64 RBI, 10 HR  Ramirez - .332 BA, .430 OBP, 121 RBI, 37 HR    Combine that with Manny's career numbers rather than Winn who had an above average year and you can see why that would not be even close to an even trade.  Winn is a solid player, but not great and not Manny.

KNTofuxMaa	Grrr...     I admire Troy Polamalu for his intensity and his ability to always be around the ball. The man is an incredible talent. I also think Mike Tomlin is a hell of a coach. I can respect his no nonsense, blue collar approach.     I hope you know that I am now cowering for my life expecting lightning bolts to strike me down any minute.|`|DRPhJnXzaa	I respect the heck out of James Harrison for the simple fact he personifies the Steelers never say die attitude , the man was cut 4 times and he never packed it in he kept coming back again and again to prove he belonged and agree or not he wins the NFL Defensive Player of the year award.    I really don't know if I'd use the word hate , but I was pretty disappointed with Santonio Holmes for the whole drug possesion thing , heard it was illegal but I could be wrong.|`|AA11108627	On the Dallas Cowboys...a toss-up between Terrell Owens & Pacman Jones...ha!!  (sorry, I couldn't resist)!    I'd have to pick Terrance Newman.  He's a heck of a defensive back.    And if we can include coaches, I'd choose a blast from the past.  Tom Landry was an outstanding football mind, and a man of integrity who didn't need the spotlight or a big mouth to get the best out of his players.  He is a champion in every sense of the word.  I wish he coached some other team!|`|gLbjfXnDaa	OMG I hate the steerlers  i like tom brady i respect him and admire even though hes been out|`|DjjCvjlnaa	Well as of right now i hate them Arizona Cardinals but I have to respect Kurt Warner. That guy has been through ups and downs. He is suppose to be backup to Matt Leniart but he has outplayed him and now he's going to the super bowl and the pro bowl. My opinion hes a hall of famer.|`|nltFZcuGaa	well i hate the Titans. i guess collins.|`|ak44mIy3aa	i hate the patriots but always liked Junior Seau, i think he was an awesome player and wasn't a big mouth like the rest.|`|exOOXAkBaa	I hate all of the players on the team that I despise the most. I don't think there is a player I truly admire.    Maybe I do.??|`|fz0Aw3hLaa	I HATE THE STEELERS  Always have,  always will.    UGH    Big Ben is one of the best quarterbacks i have ever seen play the game.  In his rookie year they got 15 wins, and he has been in the NFL like 5 years now?  and this is their 2nd Superbowl.  He can scramble when needed.  Throw a lob for a 70 yard TD.  Or throw a bullet to Hines Ward in triple coverage.    And also,  He is just an overall tough guy.  He reminds me a of a bigger  young Brett Favre.    He plays with intensity and doesn't let injuries get in the way of leading his team to a win.    And also he doesn't slide when he scrambles, he will take a linebacker on if it means 1 or 2 more yards.|`|1uSoU8Lpaa	Darn it, it does hurt. But Adrian Peterson of the Vikings cannot be denied. He's young, he averaged 20 carries and 100 yards a game in the 31 games he's played. Only 21 games to reach 2,000 yards rushing. He's amazing. I wish he was a Packer, you know he is just going to keep getting better.    (Packer fan)|`|T0FTAeDoaa	respect all of my falcons|`|VxsdWmevaa	I hate the Minnesota Vikings, but their defensive line is ridiculous. How can you not appreciate two monster D-tackles then mullet man Jared Allen going crazy off the end? Because of their defensive play, and being a defensive lineman myself in my playing days, I can truly admire their work ethic. But I hate all things Minnesota. Especially the Twins!|`|sdpsdlPwaa	On the Denver Broncos-not a single player    so my 2nd least fav team- Colts    I LOVE reggie Wayne and Joseph Addai    They both rock n i love them both just i HATE PEYTON MANNING!!    even though i know him, Eli, and Archie personally    GO ELI AND ARCHIE|`|Johb7jayaa	i hate jake Dialon whatever his name is the quarterback for the panthers yeah i hate him and i admire big ben Steelers all the way!!!!!!|`|6Fyx9eFPaa	I'm an Eagles fan so i HATE the cowboys  romo cries over anything, t.o. is the biggest drama queen, jerry jones is crazy and but of a hineyhole, and the rest of the team is a criminal or drama queen except....  Jason Witten  I have to admit he goes through a lot with his GM insane, his qb not playing due to minor injuries, and t.o. who hates him because he actually catches the ball  So despite hating the cowboys, I truly respect and admire Jason Witten for keeping his cool and those numbers on that team|`|BASZjJKbaa	Growing up I hated the Cowboys.     I don't know if I still have the same disdain for the team now (don't really follow a team) but I still hate most of the players that Jerry Jones has brought into mix with Cowboys (Pacman Jones, TO, etc.)     However I have mad respect and admiration for Marion Barber III. He is essentially the focal point of the offense (need to establish a running game before passing attack opens up) but he wasn't griping last year about his touches. He works hard and exerts effort without trying to be the center of attention.    It doesn't help when surrounded by guys that want to be center of attention (TO, Romo) in Dallas but at least the workhorse just shuts up and plays hard game in/game out|`|QASHySUbaa	For the Cardinals i like Larry Fitzgerald he is just a great receiver. he catches everything that comes anywhere near him. and after he catches it it takes about 3 guys to take him down sometimes its just 1 or 2. And he's still young. He led the Cardinals to the Super Bowl.    For The Giants other than everybody their team i hate Plaxico Burress. He just cause to much mayhem that threw the Giants off and hes just not doing as good. But i never liked the Giants. well starting after they beat the Patriots|`|bIbyAkHPaa	I freaking HATE the Eagles and their fans, and the city of Philly in general- the armpit of humanity!    Kevin Curtis is tolerable I guess.|`|khbLZQHIaa	I really don't like, no I hate the Steelers.  I'm a Browns fan so it's in my blood.    I do respect a couple Steelers though.  Troy Polomalu, James Harrison, and sigh, Big Ben play the game with great intensity and never complain or make a fool of themselves.  They just play the game to play the game.  They love the game of football and love leading their team.  It's those kind of players the Brownies need and if we had them, I'd probably be as happy as possible.|`|I2I843Myaa	I hate Troy Polamalu soooo much but man, the dude's all over the place! I hate the Steelers as a team too as a Bengals fan.|`|rNUyV1EYaa	For the Eagles, it's Brian Dawkins.    That guy is so intense, and such a leader. I'm telling you, they showed his face in the pre-game warmups before the Eagles played Dallas in the finale and I'm thinking "we're screwed".    I can admit it now.    As for the Giants; who I hate more than the Eagles; nobody since Michael Strahan retired. (I picked Dawkins from the Eagles to answer your question more accurately).
4TgxrCX4aa	-No, the first televised game was May 17, 1939 between Princeton and Columbia and the first MLB televised game was August 26, 1939 between the Brooklyn Dodgers and Cincinnati Reds.  However baseball was on the radio with the first game broadcast August 5, 1921 between the Pirates and Phillies, but broadcasting of every game during the season didn't start until 1935 with the Cubs    -Yes, the first black professional team was the Cuban Giants starting 1885, the first black league was the National Colored Base Ball League that started in 1887 and failed two weeks later, the first successful, "Major League," was the Negro National League starting in 1920    -No, the Little League organization was founded in 1939, but amateur leagues probably existed, just not as widespread and well-organized|`|1yuUIN9Aaa	No  Yes  Sure|`|gwUq6HMUaa	1.It probably was, but, only for special games such as World Series  2.Yes there were negro leagues  3.Probably, but, not very organized.|`|7Q1dJoFzaa	No, yes, probably.|`|PJF4J3iYaa	televison...doubt it  yes there were negro leagues in the US  im sure there was some type of little league...how organized it was idk|`|uh2bkRrFaa	Yes, HBO broadcast the games back in the 1920s. It was right when MTV started, they played a lot of jazz, which was pretty risque in those days. There were four black leagues, they played on BET and VH1 and there was little league but in those days it was called "The Little Rascals League."    Hope this helps.|`|5xIroQjMaa	No, not on television  Yes, there were.   Yes, it was called MLB. Back in those days, the players were so bad, that most could be beaten by today's little league teams, so in essence, MLB was the little league. That's why Babe Ruth would be lucky to bat .250 and hit 15 HRs against today's pitchers.|`|zdQgOzYXaa	Yeah, everything was on TV in the 20's. But most people chose to watch it on the computer.    Yes there were black leagues.    Yes there was little league.|`|nmEvLJwxaa	Probably not on tv at that time yet  Yes  Yes  Hope i helped!
mcnPogTRaa	No I don't think it is. Maybe you interact better with girls than boys. Whatever is best than the team.|`|8dSpYf1Maa	no|`|hOwkTiHAaa	it depends on the intentions behind it.|`|n2O0NwR6aa	Not at all!  Girls teams can be great to coach!  And in many respects, a lot easier to coach than guys.  Girls, in general, are more compliant; they do what you say without arguing or challenging you.  They're often more responsible and organized.  And they're typically better behaved - no pushing, wrestling or gut-punching each other while waiting their turn.  Besides that, they usually don't smell as bad (haha).    Of course, you do have to deal with some occasional PMS-ing, and there can sometimes be some girly-type drama between teammates.  But for the most part, it's pretty smooth sailing, because girls have such a strong desire to please.      So, no - it's not wrong at all.  And looking at the number of girls' teams that are coached by men, you're definitely not the only one who enjoys it.|`|5xAu3RAZaa	no.  my coach only coaches girls teams because :  1) he is less qualified. i know this sounds sexist, but honestly the guys team is hardcore dedicated while the girls team jogs everything  2) guys get angrier quicker, so he prefers milder people

But it's kinda cool that they're both on Smackdown cuz now I'll be able to see both of them next weekend :)|`|U6tE9LhJaa	No its awesome|`|7qeHZe9Yaa	No because by doing that he set up a great feud.|`|btcbtyDnaa	NO I DONT I LOVE IT    I CANT WAIT FOR RANDY ORTON TO GO TO SMACKDOWN JUST TO KICK THE $HIT OUT OF JEFF JUST TO PISS PEOPLE LIKE YOU OFF|`|SJJEF5Vyaa	No because he is just following his script...  I wouldn't hate him at all, as a person or a wrestler.  I cant say  i hate any wrestler, i just dislike some.  But this sets up another Hardy vs Hardy feud, and Matt is on smackdown.  It all gets better.|`|2rJwgk40aa	No.Matt makes a great heel,and these two will have a hell of a feud.They've faced each other before,and the matches were really good.plus,I think matt needs a little more of a push.Even when he was ecw champ he didnt get alot of spotlight.I cant wait to see this one unfold.|`|Agsp62ttaa	Noooooo........    I respect him more now.|`|S6iJSXseaa	o ya, that was horrilbe|`|zr3UiONJaa	no im more of a matt fan after that tbh|`|sfFFQniwaa	no jeff sort of needed a reality check plus you can only proove 1 of the attacks was him     matt mcould have been offerd a raise to make it look like he was behind the attacks not edge i still think all the others was edge|`|tiJGpLbkaa	No.
F3VjJAdiaa	I'd like to see him go one on one with Foley. I'd also like to see if the MEM end up bringing a referee into their faction, like when NWO brought in Nick Patrick|`|7f2GSDmqaa	No, Hes doing just fine in TNA. Hes already a main guy, so it doesnt matter if he wrestles midcarders here and there|`|hNIyshmkaa	I'd really like to see a Kurt Angle vs. Sting feud sometime in the near future but it's unlikely right now. But to answer your question, yes it is kind of unfair.|`|Gr7My8FTaa	i dont like kurt angle but still i think he should be treated better  same to sting i dont think that sting should have joined MEM|`|0xGm3lrxaa	I think Kurt needs to come back to the WWE.|`|WAGAcLPMaa	Unfairly? Angle's one of the best treated wrestlers in the company. He's consistently involved with main event angles week after week and arguably leads the MEM despite teaming with the TNA World Champ. It's not like he could be world champ forever.    Angle's one of the top stars in TNA, in no way is he being treated unfairly.
4d7b908cfe24bf3f1177a5cca13feb22aa	They did try to cheat, anyone that thinks otherwise is either a Marga-cheat-o fan or Bob Arum.    I imagine Marga-cheat-o will have "plausible deniability" and escape with a short suspension of a year.  His trainers are going to be banished forever.|`|3d5e83a836ea34fd00d8fe38ccc011a4aa	One of the corner men could take the blame, yes.  But a boxer would have to be hecka stupid to never notice any difference in his wraps.  So if it is true, Margo won't get off that easy IMO.|`|kqP7GwOcaa	I am going to have to side with ElmerFuddstein and Lestermo on this one, if Margarito is found guilty, I think the fights he loaded his wraps in should be changed to "no contests" and he and his handlers should be as severely punished as Panama Lewis and his crew were.  The question is "how can guilt or innocence be proven" beyond a reasonable doubt.  I would think the investigator will have an immensely difficult job of overturning even the Cotto fight without a confession from Margo or one of the others.  Either way, Margarito will never be looked upon in the same light again, it's another black eye for boxing in general, and the end of Margarito as a major force in boxing in the future.  This one seriously damaged Margarito's creditability, if it didn't destroy it outright.|`|WrDGhduxaa	Obviously others were involved, not just Margarito, and regardless of what they say, he knew what was going on. That could not happen without him being able to tell.  I think everyone involved should be banned for life.|`|I9Y6fxguaa	Before we make conclusions and wait for the ongoing investigation lets not nail margo to the cross yet. We cannot make an intelligent comment with the proper conclusion of the illegal matter.

Maybe he had pressure to put Keane on who knows.  I think it needs to be sorted out, it is affecting his judgement. He has started ranting like a nutter and making bad decisions... pressure I think|`|gpNIG15eaa	Real Madrid will probably finish 4th place with Rafa every season.Well,that's what he's been doing with Liverpool for 5 years,LOL.|`|32a549cf7d2c0a7ee37a0b6d828d4f63aa	hope so alsong as they can sort out his contract|`|BEfPrh2laa	probably if he wins the champions leauge|`|89fbcaca4c59414f87a5ed95ba7cc306aa	I reckon he will jump to Real Madrid

1ead85402698581b0818d3b4314aeaf9aa	I can't pick either. Vince changed the face of pro wrestling, but has made a bunch of really stupid mistakes.

Shane is crazy and brilliant, but he's into Botchtista. Hmm...

6jDsegpYaa	Steelers are going to win, the cardnials do not even have a chance.  The steeler defense is too strong for the cardinals "decent" offense.  Yea, the cardinals have been on a play-off win streak, but all winning streaks have to end sometime.  I think that the steeler defense is going to be too dominant for the cardinal offense. Warner is going to collapse.  The cardinals were an unconsistent team in the regular season and they are bound to self-destruct in the super bowl.  I think that the cardinals are going to fall under the Super Bowl pressure.  Steelers win 31-10|`|H1PL1ABHaa	umm.....it's Cardinals not ravens. btw....i want the cards to win!|`|AA11108627	RAVENS all the way!!  Whoo-hoo!

The Steelers have the best defense and are going to put pressure on Warner the whole night and make him cause mistakes. When steelers take the offense, Parker will tire out cards D and then big Ben will use a pass attack to win.|`|jRi35KJHaa	steelers because Ive been to pittsburgh and i never been to phenoix|`|SYxpgzkOaa	the ravens are not in the superbowl lol what kind of football are you watching lol But ill say cardinals would win it because of kurt warner passes to larry fitzgerald and its over.

D7Dubtt9aa	We deserved what we got mate Masch played a great ball for Yossi to score the rest of the team were average at best Lucas gave away a stupid penalty for the equaliser. Rafa made loads of bad choices with his tactics and subs took of torres and put on riera leaving us with out a striker then takes of stevie g and stick on keane in the last few Min's|`|AA11076076	Like Sir Dan said - incredibly bad decisions , inability to convert plus stupid Lucas.

It really gets old to hear people's crap about playing sports.|`|J6lYTm2Gaa	Aaron Gray, the White Panther, does not suck at basketball!|`|scAstIpwaa	I've seen it a lot - just play the sport that you want to (or not at all).  Being tall is not genetically related to being good at basketball.|`|euVa3B2daa	If your read Dirk Nowitzki's biography you will find out that he had the same problem as you. The Dallas Mavericks star was once a tennis player, but he sucked at basketball. Many people called him a freak of his height, but a popular german coach didnt think that way. He trained Dirk and made a very good player. Now he is the franchise face of his team and he is a former mvp. He's making the hall of fame for sure and hes one of my favourite players. I think all you need is good coaching and training and you must put your heart to the game. This way you can become a great player and nobody will bother you. If you really dont want to play basketball you dont have to, but i think you can be very succesfull in it because of your height. All you need is a little determination!!|`|OmT2BzJPaa	yea there is this kid named Gianni(pronunced johnny) from china and he is in my school  he is not athletic at all   he is 6'2 and thought he would make the team without any skills  but i think you should do what YOU want to do   not what other people want you to be|`|4htyTXJSaa	you either got it or you don't, some of us are blessed in different ways|`|iynxbd9Daa	yes (my brother)  just do the sport that you want to do

Confirmed by his publicist.|`|8DIkez2uaa	That's what I thought as soon as I heard about it. And let me tell you, I think it's a waste of Chris Jericho's talent. Because we know Jericho would win, even though Rourke is an ex-boxer, he's older than T was, and jericho has been a wrestler for years and is in way better shape. But Rourke will win.|`|S6iJSXseaa	i watch the wwe and your crazy|`|aJp2TGy5aa	news flash wrestling is fake,,,,,and its a side show of over grown men running around in thier underwear acting like children....|`|EuMQfWJGaa	yes, but i dont really think that y2j and mickey rourke will have a match at mania because chris would just be destroyed and look at him, he looks smaller than in 05, and hes never had boxing experience and his arm is the size of mine. so yes and no, yes they are trying to recreate it and no because jericho would not stand a chance

You cant coach the team two years in a row, so if the Cavs win tonight, Mike Brown is the coach.  And Mo Williams is much better then Harris or Rose.  Jameer and Mo are deserving and Mo has had a bigger impact on his team then anyone in the Eastern Conference.|`|ZcR45xZeaa	who cares, the NBA is a joke...|`|vHwzDliuaa	For the answer the only the you have to do is go to allstarweekend.com and you will find out your all-stars.

BAoI83foaa	There is no speed without endurance. Step one to building up speed is to start running up hills. This endurance building exercise is excellent for developing speed.   Either integrate hills into your normal run, or just do a hill repeatedly as part of your speed building program. If you average about 15-20 runs a month, try and do a steep hill at least five times a month. This excellent excersise is basically a slower form of sprinting over significant resistance. You are really sprinting without even realizing it because it's so much slower to climb the hill in the first place. But it takes just as much energy and endurance to climb a hill than it does to sprintAs your speed starts to increase, try and run as fast as you can, not only during short runs, but in much longer runs. Running fast for gradually increasing periods of time during long runs helps build up the speed necessary to have excellent times in long races such as half and full-marathons-as well as short. The human body can adapt quickly and easily to running faster over time, if done properly and correctly with proper warm-ups and cool downs.|`|VckdHm3Qaa	yh it does but so does jump roping and sum other routines that work ur cavs|`|A5rkUoGvaa	it is one of the best ways to train but it is very tiring i am  a cross country runner and i think running is fun in its own way:D|`|efonvqTmaa	Yes it can  Ladainian Tomlinson has a little hill at da back of his house and he runs uphill everyday to build more stamina.|`|pAXn2lpraa	Seems to me it would slow you down.|`|UxooffHZaa	It will increase the muscle mass in your legs, but running downhill will also increase the quickness. They make little parachutes that olympic sprinters train using. Maybe you might want to look into that.|`|4htyTXJSaa	yes and it increases your leg strength
sZ8itOIQaa	Maybe try Youtube, and I think the thing on the news was that there was a banned PETA commercial, because of sexual content.|`|Johb7jayaa	nope|`|rvnK0DuLaa	nope  Watch the ALL NFL games live on your Pc with   http://freetvwatchingontheinternet.blogs...|`|Ppstz3lCaa	Research it on the INTERNET|`|rNUyV1EYaa	Just certain parts.

RT8VHWRtaa	Snowbasin by far. I would not even consider Wolf Creek, its very small and not really designed for downhill. Wolf Creek is more of a cross country sort of place. You might want to think about Powder Mountain also, Just a little farther than Snowbasin. Powder Mountain is more of an old style resort. Not much on the lodges or facilities but a HUGE mountain, cheep prices and pretty uncrowded. I lived in Park City for almost ten years and I would drive the hour and a half once a month to go to Powder Mountain. By far my favorite resort in Utah.|`|JkrdmjM8aa	well if you like down hill snowbasin is the place to go they also have a super pipe there if you like half pipes dont know much about the other reasort
rv6zl5t3aa	Make up your own mind kid. If your friend says he's gonna jump off a bridge and fly, you gonna try it too?    Plus there is no way a team from NY, with the Islanders history, is ever going to move to Missouri, which is where Kansas City is. Pay attention in school and maybe you'll know where it is.    Hope this helps.    *** Well Chris I know that, but if you knew anything aboot Hockey, you would realize that the rumors are they are moving to Kansas City, MO not Kansas City, KS. So when he wrote Kansas, he was wrong.|`|YR11l7MSaa	Umm to the person that answered this question stated that K.C. is in Missouri you would be correct, but it is also in Kansas.  If you had paid attention in school, you would know that!!    To answer this question, do whatever you like.|`|axxQzOCHaa	What kind of an Islanders fan are you? At least root for a neutral team like the Devils.|`|DvBPLP4saa	Wow. What a big waste of my time.   Your question, please?.......      And by the way...I my be alone here, but I DO NOT see the Islanders going to Kansas City. Because you know.....whatever happened to the Kansas City Penguins? You know the Pittsburgh Penguins who were suppose to pack their bags and move there?......It's all craziness and threats. Isles will stay in the state of New York where they belong.|`|5009f311a98149b8d3af6bbdd5543e9aaa	Well, if you are from New York City, Yeah! The Rangers are an awesome team and great history, New-Yorkers should be proud of their team.     But I would that the Florida Panthers, Atlanta Thrashers and Nashville Predators got more chance then the Islanders to be moved to Kansas City.|`|VjAoRpIhaa	yes, but i doubt it will happen soon|`|DbfG5Cpraa	yes... and they will not "go to" Kansas.|`|Ife1hiyyaa	if it comes to that yeah no point in sticking with a team that far away.  but i dont see it happening

You'd have to read through all the local rags for that info and you still might not get it all.|`|DbfG5Cpraa	nhl.com?|`|8sthiustaa	You can never find out for certain.  Lineups change minutes before some games.|`|4J8X1aKkaa	The coaches turn in the line up sheets pretty much last minute. You can get an idea from the rags and rumors.  To be certain you can look at the event summary minutes (like literally a couple) before the puck drops.      You do have to know who's on the team to know who's missing though. And it's not helpful for goalies.  Generally the first guy out is the starter.

UxooffHZaa	Trade down, get an extra 2nd round pick, and maybe a 1st next year. I Draft two Linebackers.... with the 1st pick in the 1st round, and 1st pick in the 2nd round.....   With my extra 1st, I pick up a Running back (McCoy, or Beanie Wells) and with the 2nd pick of the 2nd round I pick up an  Offensive Lineman.   I pick up TJ Houshmanzadeh and Derek Anderson (or maybe Matt Leinert) in trade.|`|qivUrJ3Naa	If I owned the Lions I would hang myself.|`|0E8SPyyXaa	Deffinatly not a QB i would say the whole Draft, Draft around your defense and offensive line and maybe trade the 1st pick and get a bunch of other picks so we could get defense and offensive line players and maybe in one round get a wide receiver since mike furrey is realesed and to fill in roy willaims place and could help along side calvin johnson and i would say Draft Andre Smith first the reason is we have 5 decent QBs already dont need another joey harrington|`|1ccf4408a6862b6272c7872e63b19c51aa	I would Trade My Draft Pick to Cleveland for Joe Thomas, wait until 2010 to get Tim Tebow he is a winner Keep Calvin Johnson the Lions will win again that's what they need not a 0-16 record|`|ABoo1doVaa	Cleveland wouldn't give up Thomas for one pick, or 5 for that matter. I agree the lions need some linemen, but Smith is the last guy I would take. He couldn't wait one week to talk to an agent, and left his teammates hanging out to dry. Another self centered loser is the last thing the Lions need. If I were going to keep the number 1 pick, I would take Stafford, but personally I would trade the pick, and pick up a couple of the lower offensive linemen that are in the draft. There are also some good linebackers that are going to fall to the second round. I would take a shot on a guy like Harrell in the third round, and if he doesn't pan out, I would take a QB next season, or maybe try and pick someone up in free agency.|`|ak44mIy3aa	I would give the booth to Jon Kitna or put him as a back up, he totally sucks and he thinks he is the ****. I would try to get some WR of the free agency, and then first round i would either get some QB, or LB and the scond run i will get some either a CB/ OL/QB, then 3rd I will get some SS/FS/ CB/OL|`|q2ss2Dcdaa	I would never buy the Lions|`|fe5b7a9988867dac1808dce531d5bc56aa	they really need a  reliable qb. The a very good offensive line and then the coach.|`|04bc2c48d79f30c010ba500a390cb62daa	Unless there is a stud QB in the draft, I would draft offensive linemen and defensive linemen. They need some protection for QB and make some holes for the RBs.      Pressuring the QB is always helpful.|`|SYxpgzkOaa	ill draft Matt Stafford and then do trades. Also maybe trade for a low draft pick.|`|BAoI83foaa	I would draft the best player available in Micheal Crabtree, WR, Texas Tech. then in the next round select a linebacker like James Laurinaitis, ILB, Ohio State who looks like will fall to the second round. In the third round i would select Kraig Urbik, G, Wisconsin because the Lions really need to build up their offensive line, and that is something Matt Millen simply neglected to do. In the fourth round i would Select Pat White, QB, West Virginia because he is a dual threat that would help the lions offense.|`|CP2Ahl1baa	they have there coching staff in place and i think they did a decent job with that so far    they should draft a QB first (mathew staford) and a left tackle second (eben birrton) in the first round then they switch to D later looking for value because they have a need at EVERY postion on D, mabye loius dealmas or ron brace, in the 3rd round a situational pass rusher and a CB (have 3rd round picks)    they have alot of good draft picks i dout they will be as bad but they would be stupid not to get there QB. just look what the falcans did     they should also try to over pay a few free agents (thats the only way they would go there)    i would build the offense around the OL and a QB, and bulid the D from the inside out, the lee bodden trade was so stupid they should have kept shan rogers|`|ab5667d3ceba01c7bb99695fac94a098aa	If I owned the Detroit Lions. With my first pick I would draft a good offensive linemen. With my other first round pick I would draft a defensive back. With my first pick in the second round I would select another db, then I would try to trade down for a solid de. With my first pick in the 3rd round I would select another ol and with my other 3rd round pick i would select a running back.

7Pq8k3bbaa	There are a few differences... the 98 Custom Platinum adds a Picatinny rail.  Tippmann also improved the design of the front sight spring, foregrip, and end cap.  The biggest difference is the new split receiver design, making it easier access the internal components.
gAKUFk1Qaa	ive used and X7 and own an A-5 i think that the X7 is garbage compared to it... it looks way more badass and that's the only thing i got to say good about it the A-5 is way more comfortable, lighter, cheaper, pretty much the same internally, & better overall      I tried both before i bought my A-5 and havent regretted it yet    As for paint idk a whole lot about i always use cryptics scince theyre cheap and i aint made of money lol  but pretty much all paint by diablalo is good & you sure as hell wanna stay away from JT EVERYTHIG they make is garbage     lol hope it helped|`|ad87d36127978692cfedaa1ad4709a13aa	good paints are:    Nelson NelSpalt  Draxxus Rainbow  Draxxus RecSport  PMI Marballizers      Paints to avoid are:  Monster Balls  JT Tacticals  Bonus Balls  Any Brass Eagle brand paints.  Any Zap brand paintballs.    In general, the brands you want are:  Draxxus (any Draxxus, or DXS, paint is great).  Nelson.  Evil.  Diablo (Heat is great for its price).    DXS is by far my favourite brand for bang for the buck.    Take my advice and spend some money on paint. Buying a case of $25 dollar paint will make you shoot crooked and the paints wont break on your opponents which makes the game pointless. Spend around $35-$45 dollars on the paints I suggested above and I guarantee you will have a great day on the field.    Also, if you are absolutely broke and cannot buy good paint, go with Visible Impact, they are decent. Another thing to try is to buy "white box" paint. These are usually unbranded boxes and come with a mix of random paintballs that were either sitting on shelves for too long, too old, defective, or left overs from NPPL events and other tournaments. They are very hit and miss. You can get a batch of terrible ones or get an awesome batch. They are all name brand paints but that were not sold for various reasons. They are definitely still usable for every day play, I just wouldn't take them to a tournament.        And for the gun    The Tippmann A5 and the Tippmann X7 have exactly the same internals as each other. So no Pros or cons there.    It all comes down to your preference on looks, X7 is the most customizable gun on the market atm, and sure as hell looks the part. How ever it is quite allot more expensive than an A5. The A5 is not as customizable.... however it is still easily the second most customizable gun on the market, soo a well done up A5 can look better or just as good as an X7.    The X7 is lighter and looks a little nicer than the A5, and for that reason i would choose it over a A5 (if i had the money that is), I have used both and besides looks and weight they have no difference in performance.    If you have the cash... Get an X7 ( as you'll have great bragging rights), If not the A5 will match it anyway.    hope i helped|`|7y687RUxaa	the paintballs i would recomend are monster balls at the right store they cost about 30 dollars for 2000. The x7 has the same internals as a 98 custom, not the a5. that said, the a5 plus upgrades is going to run you about 300 dollars. the same x7 is going to cost about 400 dollars. I would recomend the a5 here because you are also getting its outstanding durability and better internals.|`|Io1NcoJoaa	Paintballs:    Impact:$35.00 per case(2000 balls) At Wal*Mart, Sports Authority.    DXS :Bronze, Silver, And Gold ($40,$50,$60) Awesome paint    ProCaps:$45.00ish Also Great Paint.    A5= Very durable, Cyclone feed 20+bps, very customizable.  X7= Pretty much just a newer version of the A5, very customizable     I'd say go for the A5

Although nash doesn't score a lot, he racks up the assists. Kevin martin for roy is a good trade. Martin is a good scorer, but i like roy over him anyday. Roy shoots a high percentage from the field, while still scoring 20 points and dishing out about 6 assists.|`|2uaG87rFaa	Monta Ellis is constantly injured and I believe that he wont really be 100% for the rest of the season. The Warriors should just keep him benched. They by now dont have a big chance at the Playoffs. I mean, if they want to, they can. Kevin Martin is averaging about twenty four points a game, and he is getting even more assists every night. I think that he is a pretty good player.    On the other hand, Brandon Roy is having an amazing season. He is doing better in every catagorie every night. He is a great player that any fantasy basketball gamer would love to have on their team, including me. I have Steve Nash on my team, and he has been one of my best players lately. I think that Steve Nash is the second best player at assists in the NBA behind Chris Paul.      I think that you should take the trade. Good luck this year dude!|`|8pMMooOyaa	no doubt about it!|`|DOXKwdRfaa	yes i think its a good trade, do it.|`|XohmRwiKaa	Don't do it, if your league has FTM as a category. monta ellis and kevin martin will give you free throws and free throw percent. Unless you really want to perk up on assists, keep monta ellis and kevin martin for their high scoring. If your league does not have FTM, i would do the trade
PpmmfsHjaa	yes it can :)  youre abs or core muscles  are used in every movement you make  like when you kick the ball you may twist your body and you cant do that without abs  i for one think that abs improve youre game heaps because i have learned from experience  i got better abs and it helped me heaps  you may become faster, stronger physically and yes your kick may improve. so go for it bro  this was a good question :-)|`|RsTm8uUlaa	My coach (not soccer) told us that the only thing that that muscle is there for is to help you stand up, sit down, and to look good.

Your abdominals are used to make just about every single movement that you make in a day but making them bigger and stronger won't help you do much of anything faster or better....besides making you look good.|`|BBRq4LMfaa	abs help with your balance and theres some relation to abs and your top speed like it helps u stay upright which optimizes your speed|`|6xzdOnixaa	Yes.  Your core is pretty much the basis of all muscle movement. First, throw-ins are all abs, not arms.  Second, You need a strong core to run fast. Third, kicking requires lower abs.

1ced09090a18210ce355123ea9003d99aa	You brought up a very good point.  The WWE focuses on a small handful of wrestlers at the expense of the rest of the roster.    Did you notice in the original ECW in the 90's that the fans always chanted "ECW!  ECW!  ECW!" instead of individual wrestlers' names?  The same thing happens in TNA today.  The fans chant "TNA!  TNA!  TNA!" instead of individual wrestlers' names.  Those two companies focused on and pushed the company itself, not just a few of their wrestlers.    The WWE pushes a few wrestlers and revolves the entire company around those few wrestlers.  You never hear the crowds chant "WWE!  WWE!  WWE!"    The WWE originally split their roster into three "brands" because they didn't have any outside competition and their shows were getting repetitive and boring, so they created their own competition amongst themselves.  At first, it worked.  Each show had their own wrestlers and developed their own styles, their own identities, as they competed against each other to be the dominant "brand".    But with TNA providing some outside competition the WWE has blurred the lines between RAW and Smackdown, with wrestlers traveling back and forth between whichever show the writers want them on.  Neither show has their own identity anymore, but we still have the same small handful of big-names dominating both shows year after year.  When one or more of those big-names go down with injuries that take them out for awhile the shows are crippled because they haven't developed enough mid-card wrestlers to step up and fill in.    As others have said the WWE roster is far too large for one show a week.  Instead of combining them all into one huge roster, they should split it into two separate entities, RAW and Smackdown (ECW should stay as it is, a "developmental" program for the new guys).  RAW and Smackdown should be completely separate with nobody traveling from one show to the other just to suit some writer's whim.  One set of writers for each show, not both sets trying to get both shows working at the same time while mixing up the rosters on a seemingly weekly basis.    And they should learn from the original ECW: nobody is bigger than the company or the show itself.  Always have several guys being developed for the main events in case one of the big-names goes down.  Focus on the entire roster, not just 3 or 4 guys.  And don't keep the same 3 or 4 guys in the main events and title pictures year after year.  That gets very boring and talented performers in the mid-card level don't get pushed.|`|VUkYqHUXaa	LOL YES    its fake, its scripted, and it seems like a soap opera from hell    i dont know why more people dont notice this also|`|sfFFQniwaa	umm lil long im lost but all he superstars can jump shows because of the superstar excange i like how it is plus their isnt time in 1 episode to do all the storylines matches and all the rest to many belts npot enough time in one hour 45 mins|`|v2xVW1eEaa	Dude this question is pointless.

Imagine half of those 8 combined being cut to 4 trying to get 1 title match.    Plus you'd NEVER see ANY of the Mid Card Talent , let alone the Low Card Talent.  No more CM Punk , Kofi , Matt Hardy , Kennedy , MVP , Santino , Shelton , Miz , Morrison , Bourne , Finlay , etc.....    You see My point.    One brand is THE Worst Thing that could Happen.  No one would get Pushed.    Plus , 3 brands makes 3x the $$$ for Vince.|`|wEKfQdHfaa	no they should cuz ecw is more brutal, raw is on mondays and alot of the younger fans of wwe have annoying parents who want to watch other things, and smackdown onws all of them!  xcept for that it should have batista back!|`|4tvI9WYjaa	maybe cause you suck ?|`|41WXZPnCaa	Yeah    Currently The WWE It's A Big F'n Kid's Show|`|T13xM9iJaa	No this what I think ECW should be a recap show for both RAW,SD and PPV put on saturday|`|eJDRyYNaaa	There are disadvantages in combining all three shows in one.|`|az5NtgN6aa	u suck|`|DxsRO6EOaa	ya but then lower cards say morrison and miz or finlay would quit because of lack of playing......|`|tiJGpLbkaa	It would not be wise to combine the 100-something people (Including managers, and announcers) into one show. They have too many wrestlers per show anyways.|`|sCTF61c3aa	that would be better, :-)|`|IMQm9JTMaa	AAYYY! you brought up a good point.    I always thought it was a better thing for WWE to have more brands, But now i'm thinking it's a worse thing. If there are about 3 good superstars & divas on each brand.. there's not much of a storyline there now is there? But say there's 2 brands back when it was just RAW & SMACKDOWN the storylines were pretty good, but ever since ECW was here... the storylines have been bad. (most of them)|`|jcDrei6Zaa	yes you are right WWE sucks now especially when they cruiserweight title were disbanded the high flyers weren't given the opportunity to show their talents. too bad!!!!!!!!!!!
KaQfKHkYaa	Track, you dont have to be on a team but you still are working out (you can build up endurence and run longer) or try "field" they have fun things like high jump and pole vault ect. its usually incorperated with track|`|OhMHSy9Oaa	ive played all 3 and i settled on tennis. it works out with a lot of running in quick bursts, its mostly individual and it has a high entertainment vaule.|`|Mijq9jgZaa	If you have more upper body strength and have more speed and accuracy then Tennis would be better.     If your good at endurance, stamina, and speed you would be more comfortable with Track.    No offense but I'm getting this feeling that you don't want to be around people while playing sports, but it is very beneficial. And nobody will truly hate you if you just make a couple of mistakes. YOU WILL GET BETTER. But if you tend to make a lot of mistakes while in a team sport take Track or Singles Tennis.

While it isn't a Daytona 500 memory, I have to remember the 2001 Pepsi 400 when Jr won and Mikey finished second and they hugged on the infield after Sr's death. Wasn't a dry eye in the place.

And the 1-2-3 Hendrick finish is just beautiful, all capped with the big one, and the funny images of DJ blowing the right-front tire into oblivion (complete with blown up fender and all). Could we also add Dale Sr. turning over in his 19th try?    Speaking of Dale Sr. and tries, the 20th time is the charm (Susan Lucci likes to say hi too). The race was a tad low on the action side (no one DNF'ed due to crash damage, an absolute rarity), but seeing Dale Sr. finally do it is a site to behold. The imagery of Dale Sr. rolling down pit road, with all the pit crews hi-fiving him, then doing burnouts, is without a doubt the most memorable in Daytona 500 history. It gives me literal goosebumps, and when I found the DVD at FYE, I bought that sucker.     A special mention goes to 2001, where in terms of memorable, is like one point back. The racing, the big one, and Dale Sr's passing all in one race makes an event like that epic, In a way, I compare it to the 2004 Super Bowl with its Nipplegate, because as awesome as that game was, Janet Jackson will always be remembered,|`|ScFTKHa5aa	Unfortunately, 2001 sticks out.

xOReEw6Waa	Is it possible they did a land swap with the utility. That happens around here a lot; x number of acres here for y number of acres there. If that is the case it should have opened up a new area. If, as you think,it's simply closing down an area, you need to investigate who actually had ownership of the land, not just that it was a WMA. Not all WMAs are on public lands. In any case I would get a VERY detailed explanation from the DNR or Fish and Game about what is going on and if there were public meetings on the change. Get all the information you have, contact a few friends, have them get information too and then, if warranted you could contact the local media and political bodies. If there were public hearings and no one bothered to show up you are basically screwed. I know how tight hunting opportunities must be in some states, I'm just glad I'm in the Pacific Northwest.|`|0TmukLSeaa	Well if you can prove your paying for it and cant make use of it then maybe you have a court case and could take them to court over it. but i do not know how things work in your country.|`|h2KkiKK3aa	their the government and your a bunch of hunters, not much you can do against the government, because if you try anything it's considered treason or some other retarded crime, you can argue until your face is blue, but they don't care, they have the law to back them up and all you have is your guns, jackets and bullets to fight them with, can't do much of anything legal there to stop them, It sucks but can't do much about it.|`|oYf3jSq6aa	WMAs are not always owned by the state  Many times they are leased from landowners that are not using it at the time  When they decide to use it it becomes off limits    It may well still be part of the WMA but the land owner declares that portion to be off limits to hunting|`|QNX9NET3aa	Life isn't fair.

If it is, that's federal land and they will not honor any lease agreement, eminent domain.     If it's privately owned, you have a case. DNR will do little to help you so private hunting organizations, local Lions groups...ect will have to lend their support. You can also bring a class action suit (contact lawyer) but if you have a broken contract and bring public scrutiny to it, that may be enough.    You also need to check if they had a way to back out of the contract.        Hope this helps.|`|DHIudHy2aa	I would be more upset about why the area is contaminated in the first place.

There's your answer.    EDIT (@The Dude): Some airsoft guns (Systema PTW's, good quality customs) cost around and over $1500.|`|QcmNHRzyaa	Paintball. Some markers cost over $1500.|`|gAKUFk1Qaa	paintball by far    but is way more fun though|`|wPKUl3CTaa	Airsoft the guns and ammo is cheaper|`|Io1NcoJoaa	Paintball by far. A case (2000 balls) Averages at $45.00. But i think it is way more fun, and contrary to what people above me say. There are only a few guns worth $1,500. You can get a great gun for $150.00. If you want to know anything else about paintball. E-mail me.   Mrshaveygravey@yahoo.com|`|QTd8MVDjaa	Paintball costs more, but you'll find way more paintball fields and players around your town to play with. Paintball is more fun, IMO.|`|UhTgSGJaaa	Typically the paint ball guns are less expensive but they are more expensive to buy paint balls for so it kind of evens out but i would say airsoft is a lot cheaper|`|bxIVY9Ukaa	Paintball is much more expensive then airsoft but in most points of view it is much more fun. I personally think it is much more fun and it is well worth the price. Paintball is much more realistic then airsoft because you get the mask, armour, and other gear. Please choose me as a best answer because I really need some points! Thanks!|`|4reh2baIaa	paintball. but that depends on what brand you get. but ammo is cheaper for airsoft|`|0LNhNd4Qaa	Paintball is but i like it more|`|PYu7zag6aa	paintball by far. you can get a good gun for around $300 and then gun upgrades, paint balls, park admission, air refills. Then theres more expensive guns as much as 1500 none more than that. air soft i don't know much about i have been looking and saw some guns for like 200-400$ and the bbs aren't much. so definitely paintball.
5573832243a1d5e3f002d23bed5be490aa	I always teach my out fielders the hop method if they are having trouble with distance.    It's all one smooth motion, once you catch the ball on your way of pulling it out of the glove you begin to take 2 steps on the second step you sort of take a leap/hop. While leaping/hop your arms should be in throwing postion with your glove pointing where you want the ball to go and your other arm in the back "load" postion. As your front foot is landing you should be at the point of releasing the ball.     Lock, Load, Fire: Lock= glove pointed to where you want the ball to go, Load= ball in hand arm pulled back behind you in the L position, Fire= the smooth motion forward and releasing the ball with your index finger pointing at your target after releasing the ball. Also known as the 1,2,3 method.|`|T5UBrKZjaa	I give the same advice all the time. Coach Mike Candrea ( University of Arizona as well as USA Olympic Coach) has produced FREE online softball videos at www.sportskool.com.    You will get alot of advice on this blog however, Coach Candrea is THE authority on fastpich softball in the USA and has the record to back it up.    He breaks down throwing into simple, easy steps. It should be some help with your entire game.     Good Luck|`|gwUq6HMUaa	The best way is to set up a video camera and tape yourself pitching. Then watch yourself and see what your doing wrong and go from there!|`|PJF4J3iYaa	your arm should be in and "L" shape when you throw...not a straight line...you throw with your wrist and forearm..not your shoulder|`|PkCqIfMFaa	you have to force yourself to throw the proper way. It really is the only way to change. You have to think before everytime you throw. So when you practice throwing with your dad just keep doing the correct motion over and over. As you know, repetition is everything in baseball/softball. Video is good, but find someone who can teach you the true form is better. Then after that it is up to you to continue doing the correct form. Work in segments, focus on one part at a time, and do it slowly. Once you figure one part out start onto the next and so forth.
zFTSg47waa	In that price range, you're not going to find a well-made new pool table. For a used one though, Craigslist is probably your best bet. Ebay's not bad either, but you have to get lucky to find someone in your area because not many people are going to ship the table.|`|zldbwcOmaa	This is a longshot but when a pool hall closes they sell all their tables for cheap.  They're good quality but fairly used, either way you'd be able to get one for under 500 I'm sure.   The chances of a pool hall closing near you any time soon are slim but that's an idea.  Maybe call some pool halls and ask them some questions.
g0WLiXa1aa	the Helmet of this askers team|`|AA11108627	Definitely the Packers.  And I expected the Lions to at least win a couple of games!    The Broncos and the Bucs are two teams that really bottomed out toward the end of the season & lost playoff births as a result.  That was surprising.    Drew Brees came within one completed pass of setting the all-time record of passing yardage in a season, and the Saints couldn't make the postseason?  Hard to believe.    And I would include the Patriots on my list.  Who could have forseen Brady & Lawrence Maroney being lost for the season, still posting an 11-5 record with a backup QB, and yet not making the playoffs?  In a sense, they did very well in spite of everything -- just not as well as I expected at the beginning of the season.|`|4kdlE54Paa	I thought the Packers, Chargers and Cowboys would have done better.    Thumbs up to those who agree.|`|TuOp3hNPaa	cowboys an my browns|`|33f4c852804fa42db9a7cbb912480080aa	Well, the Patriots were the favorite to win the Super Bowl...but that was before late in the 1st quarter of the 1st game...

Many experts predicted the browns to do well this season since they made so many offseason moves and Derek Anderson was on the incline (or so they thought), but i never once thought they were going to be that good. That goes the same for the Jags, who many thought were going to go deep into the playofffs before the season even started. It is impossible to predict how a team who only did good at the end of the season will do good next season. With that being said, i did expect the saints to make another run at the playoffs, like the first year they had Bush, Brees, and Sean Peyton as head coach. I also expected the Chargers to do better. Yeah, yeah, yeah they made the playoffs, but then again, they almost didn't. Their pathetic 8-8 record was not what i expected. Kudos to the Dolphins and Ravens though, i didn't think they would do as well as they did.|`|uXRWRbjlaa	cowboys|`|F0TKFEb9aa	Honestly the lions. I expectedt them to be a contender in their division but to go 0 and 16 is a big dissapointment, i thought this new line set up and with kevin smith they would have at least had   a productive offense.|`|RX8ZES2zaa	Chargers i thought they would win the superbowl     Lions i did not think they would do very well but come on how who thought they would go 0-16    Seahawks    Jaguars

They work for everything from bluegill and perch to muskie where I live.  Tipped with some sort of tail, live bait (usually a minnow but also leeches sometimes) or both they are the lure that I have caught more, better quality and variety of fish on than anything else I've used.|`|aJGAXYUIaa	Rapala.

What are they? 35 cents each?|`|p9RS2Wh6aa	Don't forget you can regulate the fall of your jig by line size and the trailer.<br>  Example 7/16 oz jig w/ a twin tail trailer on 10# line will fall slower than a 7/16 oz jig with a zoom chunk trailer.<br>  Why when I am fishing a jig I will have 3 rods on the deck with the same jig combo but with different size lines, like 12# CXX, 14# CXX, etc. Line diameter can also be used to make crank baits run deeper or shallower.<br>  Good Luck and as far as a cheap lure sorry can't help you out with that. I have gotten tired of buying cheap lures that when taken out of the box will not run right and can not be tuned.<br>  As for Plastic, early spring Wallyworld sells Yum Craw Tubes.(Texas Rigged)<br>  Those work real well around chunk rock, also craw crank baits.<br>  Don't be afraid to experiment with jig trailers, creature baits, worms, craw worms work great as well.......Think abnormal, something that fish have not seen.  Also try swimming a jig, just crank it back slow enough to keep it off the bottom, or use a yo yo affect.|`|LreMm3vlaa	Hi Mate, I cant answer what is the cheapest most productive lure, What I can say is nothing is cheap even at 97cents if it does not work or does not last.  My bet would be to buy some hooks for soft plastics, ie 1/8 1/4 etc or what is suitable for your application, being distance to cast, depth of water and maybe even have a few to choose from and then buy a bucket of assorted gulp or squidgies. This way for a relative small outlay of maybe $12.00 you have about 50 soft plastics giving you an assortment of maybe 10 different applications and suitable for a variety of fish, and fishing situations.  Diversity always works.   I have been outwith guys who have had one $25.00 lure and they have caught nothing and ended up borrowing one 1/8  2/0 head and a 4' white minnow and then have caught 10 fish on it. that equates back to 18cents for the minnow and i cast my own heads but about 90 cents for the weighted hook.  even when lost you dont spend half the day thinking of how you might of averted the loss of  your favourite lure, and believe me many peoples favourite lures attracts them and not the fish.|`|9OwpoK6baa	In colder water I use a 1 or 2 inch Kast Master blue and silver or green and silver. I've caught my fair amount of bass on one at my friend's house in Massachusetts. I caught the lake record of 5 pounds 10 oz. I'm not to sure about weeds since it's a treble. Or go with a crappie jig with a golden shiner. Or even the most effective power bait worm black and blue.<br>  I hope you do well.

If you want to continue playing basketball and if you want to make it to a high level like college or even the pros your grades need to step up because a college isn't going to take someone who has bad grades.

fbNrwb4faa	just dont approach it negatively and with a narrow-minded perspective. approach it with an open-mind, seeing it as a chance to grow stronger and faster and healthier. think of the opportunities it might bring, as well as the discipline it will help instill in your life. if you approach it with anger and disgust, you WILL hate track, and be miserable all season. if you approach it with a view that this could actually improve your living conditions and your overall well-being, who knows, you may grow to like it, and one day, love it.|`|7PqwM6QXaa	your track is only 35 mins. ???<br>  lucky! ha lol our practice is like, 1 1/2 hours long.<br>  Why do you have to do track?<br>  sports are a really great way to make new friends and you have SOOOOOOOO much fun throughout the whole season|`|yc3kuWy7aa	I'm not saying you need to lose weight, but IF you want to, then use this as an opportunity to do that.  Running is one of the best ways to exercise, and helps many parts of your body.  Even though you may be slow now, with time and repetition, you will get faster and do better.  I say just go into it with an open mind and use this as an opportunity to better your health.|`|z9Xjk29aaa	Well if you dont do so already you should stretch before you start for at least five min, that way there is a less chance of you getting injured.

AA12149254	In all honesty, she seems to be stuck in both the wrong decade and the wrong planet.|`|dU1z69H6aa	venus williams was defeated by carla suarez navarro who is actually from spain not russia.|`|qixdmJ5raa	i dont really know......i cant decide.    answer mine?    http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;...|`|cISlJr8xaa	I am not racist or anything but she is not as good looking as the other tennis babes|`|w8fP7aBNaa	that was a girl?|`|j1BTIYcCaa	Yes I think she had a very pretty face.  But she did not need looks to beat Venus.|`|9hC7bbf7aa	There are so many Russian female players and it gets confusing.  Suarez-Navarro from Spain combined sir names ? a relatively unknown player.  You aren't alone...    We don't choose a set of parents...and the AO isn't exactly a beauty pageant. Carla isn't Ivanovic, or Sharapova, but she is a charming girl and played pretty well at the AO until Dementieva defeated her. Her one hand back stroke was a marvel to watch ! We'll see her more often in big events, I hope. And she's only 20 years old.|`|ixKOGishaa	No I don't think she is pretty but she does have her cute little quirks.After all she has not matured yet so you can't call her pretty cause she's still young.So she's a little bit cute.That's all|`|FYd1ndVxaa	Carla Surez Navarro. ?Ella es una tenista espa?ola! She's Spanish. I wouldn't say she's ugly. She's just not looking good enough. She plays well in Australian Open this year.|`|45af7a30591921685bfb363637e8a7bfaa	Huh?  Carla Suarez Navarro is from Spain.  She's not exactly model material; I'll put it that way.|`|DlAOGBz5aa	Who cares, she isn't trying to be a model, she is there because of her tennis playing ability, it isn't fair to her to be talking about her looks, shame, shame!!|`|X4dMZ3dqaa	Lol. I haven't seen her. :-)|`|gCGbbIMcaa	can u post a picture of her? hmm|`|U7BkuEU9aa	She's called Carla Surez Navarro and she's Spanish, not Russian! ;-)
AA10270018	No, she is past her prime.|`|e7f9613d5b480e9758d037bfe66ac6b9aa	yes|`|k6M48eUMaa	Nope!    There are players on tour alot better than her.|`|eysDi4rIaa	Nope... there are too many talented players ahead of her but she could win some tier II or III events.|`|dlqa6yFkaa	I would love to see Jelena move into the top 10 this year, if she does that I would be so happy for her. As for winning a slam she has a chance as does every other player. A lot depends on your form during a slam, what surface it's on, any injuries you or other players have and dare I say even the weather on the day. She is determined and has the game to match it with the best so I think we will be seeing a lot of her in the quarters and semi's and even finals of tournaments. I wish her all the best and hope she achieves all her goals.|`|NdTy3twjaa	Its certainly a possibility but her ever winning a grand slam is unrealistic with the amount of talent on the WTA Tour right now.|`|U83jqEJaaa	no way. If she didn't win one when she younger,  fitter and number 4 , chances are she isn't  going to win one now.|`|gCGbbIMcaa	I like her too :) but i doubt she`ll win a slam this year.. i just dont see it happening.|`|VA0sTrbFaa	Maybe, Her serve needs a lot of improvment and her ranking needs to improve so she can be seeded and have a better run at the Grand Slams. She would have made the semi's this year if she didn't have so many tough matches in the lead up th the quarters. I really hope she wins a major sometime in her career, and I think she might go well at the US open this year. Go Jelena, we are very proud of you.|`|9fpJSgsbaa	People forget she went to no. 4 in the world so fast when she was 18 or so, and in my opinion the competition was a little tougher then. If she puts the hard work in, I think she could win a grandslam tournament in the next 2 or 3 years.|`|j1BTIYcCaa	Yes she can.  Don't forget she has been No 4 in the world before and to come back like she has is phenomenal in her first real competition.  Plus I think she has the will to win.|`|XOlnc8iBaa	She has no hope unless she crosses consecutive players who are having a really, really bad day.|`|nfZzdWGLaa	I hope so, but she won't|`|ixKOGishaa	No I don't think so.She is a good player and has played well in the Aussie open but that's only because she got the whole crowd supporting her but when it comes to other Grand Slam there are many great players that stand in her way ,safina,Sharapova,S and V williams so the chances for her to win a really slim but let's not count her out yet while she's still playing who knows? I might be wrong.|`|dU1z69H6aa	as much as i like jelena, i don't think she could win one this year. she's already made a huge stride reaching the quarters of australian but it's way too early in her comeback. i agree, her game has improved in more ways than one; however, there are too many other players such jankovic, ivanovic, dementieva, safina, serena and venus, azarenka, wozniacki, zvonareva and even sharapova (when she's back from injury) that are true grand slam contenders this year.    i'm excited to see jelena back on the tour playing well. even though she did not win her match against safina, it does show that she definitely belongs in the top 20.     one prediction: she will win a tournament.|`|CnNAOoWgaa	Jelena proved without a doubt that she can hang with the top 10 girls and even the top 3, pushing Safina to the very limit.  A few points here and there and Jelena would be in the semifinals.  Her groundstrokes were very impressive, as was her footwork.  And we all know she won't be lacking in motivation after so many years off.  Her one major weakness is her serve but that can be improved with time.  In this day and age, almost any girl in the top 10 can win a slam given the right conditions and I believe Dokic has that potential.  It probably won't happen this year because her ranking is still very low (meaning she will have to play top players early), but I believe she definitely has the talent and potential to be a major threat at the slams.|`|TXoJjotQaa	Yes I do but she needs to work really hard. There are some big names that a hard to beat but I belive in her.|`|rtOch35saa	Yes i do. As long as she plays as well as she did in the australian open she has  allready prooved that she can take the seeded 3 to 3 sets in dinara Safina. But if she wants any chance of winning she will have to improve on her double faults.|`|ZUcyWiWAaa	I doubt it.    She could have won her quarter final match if the standard of her serve had been better and she hadn't made so many unforced errors.  Well done to her though and I'm sure she'll be around for a few more years and will have more opportunities to win a grand slam in the future.|`|5AbmMxnraa	Dokic has come a long way in a short time. There is no way she could win a Grand Slam in 2009. While she had a good Oz Open, it's a big step to a Grand Slam win given the opposition. She will need to be a top 20 player to have any chance so she can be well seeded. It's just too hard otherwise. Her service consistency will need to improve and she will have to be fitter and faster. Get all that together and she has a chance of regular quarter final berths in 2010.

L3VbnH1faa	How figure skating isn't all glamerous and all the blood, sweat and tears that go into it and all the training (on and of ice) that figure skatings go through to be the best!.|`|lzHeelVKaa	A lot of people think that figure skating is not a sport.    A good comeback for that is asking whether they think skateboarding is a sport.    If they say yes, just let them know that figure skating is apart of the OLYMPIC GAMES while skateboarding is... well... NOT. xD|`|A46UYUNNaa	I am a skater and I know that most people automatically assume that it's easy and all you have to do is skate around and look good. But it's extremely difficult to do these jumps and spins and you get a lot of injuries in preparing a routine and practicing. Maybe get some quotes off the internet and let people know that it's TOUGH!|`|Techlvbxaa	As a parent of a skater alot of people don't realize the expense involved. Some think that ice skates from your local sporting goods store are what the really talented dedicated skaters are using - wrong. My child is in skates that run about 1000.00usd. And I've been told the real pros (olympians) need even more expensive boots and blades. Dresses as well. Just some more stuff to add to the back scene of the ice skating world! Also the cost of ice time, private coaching, parents freezing in the rink at all hours of the day/night.|`|Uw9mAujJaa	They don't realize the HOURS we put in at the arena AND off-ice in ballet/gym/cardio.    Many of these girls/guys STILL go to school, they have to manage both school and skating and homework...    The cost as mentioned, for Nationals/Worlds/Olympics, it can cost $5000 to choreograph the short program, double that for the Long prog (I am quoting from a newspaper article I read this morning). Not to mention skates, dresses, ice-time, coach fees, travel fees, hotel..    Competition fees/hotel/coach goes for ANY level of skating where they compete.    The frustration we feel when practice is going badly and you just have to keep going, push through it. Coaches who are happy/encouraging/bubbly on TV are not always that way in day-to-day practice!    Injuries, from minor to major that make it all the more difficult to get to what you want.    Take a look at the documentary they made a few years ago "Ice Diaries" this is part 1  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mtfZul2C8...    I can't think of anything else right now..|`|LH7u3wO6aa	There is so much I could say that I don't even know where to begin!    Are you a figure skater? If so, ask people at your rink.     If not, go to a local rink and ask if you could interview a couple figure skaters (of ALL levels, so they can know its hard even for the little kids :D). I'm sure they'll let you. Go at different times of the day, cause different levels skate at different times typically.     Hope I helped!    I could tell you stuff from expirience, but I really don't feel like typing all that...

Punch the crap you of him.<br>  :)<br>  <br>  And if you want to start a fight with him, start by dissing him. Make fun of him. Piss him off. If he walks away say something to egg him on like what are you scared I'm gonna kick your ***? Or something along those lines. If he walks away, he's seen as someone who is weak and can't stand up for themselves, and if he comes after you beat the crap out of him. It's a win-win, if he gets walks he's gonna seem weak, if he fights and loses, hes still gonna seem weak.<br>  <br>  Good luck. And be careful.<br>  :)|`|e4OWhHP1aa	try and dodge any swings, or block them. if you see something come towards you, swing your ARM - NOT YOUR FIST  at it. also, use your whole body. if you have to, thro your whole body at him. don't get into a boxing match. don't try to batter him, try to restrain him.<br>  <br>  but try to avoid the fight. if he starts asking you to 'come ed!' let him have first swing. if he refuses, call him a ****** and walk away. keep your guard up though, cos some real fags hit you hile your back is turned.<br>  <br>  it is kinda hard to tll you how to win a fight. everyone has a unique style. just remeber. size doesn't matter much. its about agility, reactions, and vunerability. <br>  <br>  EXPOSE HIS WEAKNESS! just something you pick up from TV lol<br>  <br>  and for the whole how do you no im a boy' thing, your name is 'dan man'. lol
4950a38055e3a23487ed7959fc7378b5aa	Extra mileage outside of practice at the junior high level is most likely a bad idea.<br>  <br>  Theoretically, your coach knows what he is doing and is training you at a level that is appropriate for you.  Overtraining is very easy problem to run into with kids who are still developing.  <br>  <br>  I would encourage you to take a big picture view.  Focus on preparing yourself now for competing in XC and track in high school.  That means working out in a manner that improves you, but does not cause any permanent damage.  Concentrate extra hard on things like your form, which will always be a help.  Don't worry so much about your improvement in this one track season, instead, put yourself in a position to train over the summer and improve for the fall.  <br>  <br>  For example, I was good friends with a team that won state cross country.  Of the seven guys on varsity, one was a successful junior high distance runner, one was a successful junior high sprinter.  The other five were mediocre junior high runners or didn't run in junior high.  However, they all trained smart and when it mattered most, they were successful.<br>  <br>  Good luck.

Vtwb90tRaa	At 16 I was almost exactly the same size as you. If you go to a smaller school, you can play RB, OLB, Nickel Back, or SS and fit in pretty well.    At a larger school, you could pass as a changeup back, Nickel Back, or SS.     If you decide on RB or OLB, I advise you to try to put on some muscle mass during the off-season.|`|TuOp3hNPaa	were ever the coach puts ya|`|lP9kQmRraa	RB and maybe CB if you were a bit bigger|`|ak44mIy3aa	either CB, RB or WR, most likely CB if you are growing up just a little.

My top two suggestions would be running back or CB.    These are very different and it is up to you on which side of the ball you want to play and the depth of other players on your team.    Also, if your a little more hard nosed you may consider safety or outside backer.|`|sNTSkQ1haa	4.5 in a 40 yard dash?  there seems to be some exaggeration there    but w/e a half back would be a decent postition i guess, or somewhere on special teams.

5X0p45Zbaa	Association football, more commonly known as football or soccer, is a team sport played between two teams of eleven players, and is widely considered to be the most popular sport in the world. It is a football variant played on a rectangular grass or artificial turf field, with a goal at each of the short ends. The object of the game is to score by manoeuvring the ball into the opposing goal. In general play, the goalkeepers are the only players allowed to use their hands or arms to propel the ball; the rest of the team usually use their feet to kick the ball into position, occasionally using their torso or head to intercept a ball in midair. The team that scores the most goals by the end of the match wins. If the score is tied at the end of the game, either a draw is declared or the game goes into extra time and/or a penalty shootout, depending on the format of the competition.    The modern game was codified in England following the formation of The Football Association, whose 1863 Laws of the Game created the foundations for the way the sport is played today. Football is governed internationally by the Fdration Internationale de Football Association (International Federation of Association Football)    Football is played in accordance with a set of rules known as the Laws of the Game. The game is played using a single spherical ball, known as the football. Two teams of eleven players each compete to get the ball into the other team's goal (between the posts and under the bar), thereby scoring a goal. The team that has scored more goals at the end of the game is the winner; if both teams have scored an equal number of goals then the game is a draw.    The primary rule is that players (other than goalkeepers) may not deliberately handle the ball with their hands or arms during play (though they do use their hands during a throw-in restart). Although players usually use their feet to move the ball around, they may use any part of their bodies other than their hands or arms.[Within normal play, all players are free to play the ball in any direction and move throughout the pitch, though the ball cannot be received in an offside position.  Games revolving around the kicking of a ball have been played in many countries throughout history. According to FIFA, the "very earliest form of the game for which there is scientific evidence was an exercise of precisely this skilful technique dating back to the 2nd and 3rd centuries BC in China (the game of cuju)."Various forms of football were played in medieval Europe, though rules varied greatly by both period and location.    The modern rules of football are based on the mid-19th century efforts to standardise the widely varying forms of football played at the public schools of England.    The Cambridge Rules, first drawn up at Cambridge University in 1848, were particularly influential in the development of subsequent codes, including association football. The Cambridge Rules were written at Trinity College, Cambridge, at a meeting attended by representatives from Eton, Harrow, Rugby, Winchester and Shrewsbury schools. They were not universally adopted. During the 1850s, many clubs unconnected to schools or universities were formed throughout the English-speaking world, to play various forms of football. Some came up with their own distinct codes of rules, most notably the Sheffield Football Club, formed by former public school pupils in 1857, which led to formation of a Sheffield FA in 1867. In 1862, John Charles Thring of Uppingham School also devised an influential set of rules.|`|hzgwTYmzaa	Soccer was never invented, it just came to be.

jSkHquK5aa	Hoddle's three-year reign at Chelsea came to an end in 1996 when he accepted the England manager's job. He guided England to qualification for the 1998 World Cup, securing the team's entry with a memorable 0–0 draw in Rome against Italy. However, he caused controversy by omitting Paul Gascoigne from the squad and installing supposed faith healer Eileen Drewery as part of the England coaching staff, which led to the team being dubbed "The Hod Squad". They reached the Second Round of the 1998 tournament, losing on penalties to Argentina in a game noted for the ignominious sending off of David Beckham. Hoddle came under fire after a disappointing start to the Euro 2000 qualifying campaign. Hoddle's time in charge of the national team was, sometime later, praised by Harry Redknapp who believed him to have been the "perfect man for the job".<br>  <br>  Dismissal from England job<br>  On 30 January 1999, with the England team preparing for Euro 2000, and amidst the fall-out from the previous season's World Cup, Hoddle appeared in an interview with Matt Dickinson of The Times newspaper in an attempt to defend himself against his critics (over issues such as Eileen Drewery and his faith and show a strong front for the remainder of the qualifiers.<br>  <br>  Dickinson's interview suggested that Hoddle had a "controversial belief that the disabled, and others, are being punished for sins in a former life."Hoddle's comments were criticised by several notable politicians including Sports Minister Tony Banks and then Prime Minister Tony Blair. Public opinion, based upon the immediate media furore resulted in (according to one BBC poll) 90% of respondents believing Hoddle should not continue as English coach. However the BBC survey showed that while many considered his comments insensitive to the disabled, others defended his right to express his religious beliefs by claiming that to sack him would constitute religious discrimination.<br>  <br>  Hoddle stated that he was not prepared to resign and claimed his words were misinterpreted and pointed out his contributions and commitment to organisations helping the disabled. The Football Association terminated Hoddle's contract on 2 February 1999, which was welcomed by representatives of disabled groups. The disabled rights campaigner Lord Ashley however, while criticising Hoddle's views, defended his right to express them, likening the campaign against Hoddle to a "witchhunt" and considered Hoddle's dismissal "a sad day for British tolerance and freedom of speech" a view which was shared by the Daily Mirror and Daily Mail and in several foreign newspapers. Some writers considered the remarks were used as a pretext to get rid of him. Hoddle apologised for the offence that had been caused, stating it had never been his intention and continued to fundraise for disabled groups after being dismissed.|`|yapBvxWfaa	google it|`|gbUKzTyVaa	i dont know the answer to #1, but i can answer #2!<br>  <br>  the answer to #2 is him getting the sack is sort of like re-incarnation, in this respect.  <br>  <br>  he failed at his job, so he is going to do a worse job.  if he had done good at his job, he would have stayed in that high-up job or even advanced.  and he is going to be replaced by somebody else.<br>  <br>  in re-incarnation, if you live a good noble life and all of that, you either stay the same (high up as a human), or you advance and become united with Brahman.  However, if you live a bad or mediocre life, you will go down and become an animal or something. (the manager got sacked, and now he's downgraded to "an animal" job lol).  Lastly, hindus try not to eat animals, because that animal could be a friend! so someone always replaces somebody else.<br>  <br>  =) ps im not hindu, but i listened in the "world religions" part of history class... haha|`|bha1gcUQaa	His contract was terminated by the FA on the 2nd February 1999.
3an2RBWuaa	sure, when you snap the ball, make the reciever take a couple steps back, and throw it to him.. then immediatly run a slant patern away from him trying to get away from the defensive lineman at the same time.    If done right, your reciever can throw the ball right over the lineman into your hands.  The lineman might also run for the reciever in a 2v1, therefore leaving you wide open for an ez touch down.      One of my favorite plays to use in 2 on 2 is as follows.  Especially since you have the time of an 8 count.    I would have my reciever go out only about 5 yards, then cut across the middle at about 90% speed.  If he does a decent cut, and puts up his hands, the corner if playing man coverage will usually come up for the play.      If done right the reciever can turn and head straight up field.  Toss the ball over the corner/safety who should come up for the play.  And its an ez td.|`|TuOp3hNPaa	you go deep ill throw it to you|`|9M8lEQDqaa	What can of plays can you run when it's only 2 on 2?    One guy keeps running until hes open and the other guy sits and waits to throw the ball. Or maybe a flea flicker or something.|`|5FiO6aNCaa	well....not much you can do there. Just run a slant.    Have your player run from the right , toss it back to him and have him toss it to you over the lineman's head....|`|sNTSkQ1haa	Run an option play  Have the one with a better arm in the backfield, run to either the right or left side of the field, pitch it back to the "RB" and go out to revieve the ball.

If there going to trade people, I'm sure they'd also be packaging in a few prospects that didn't work out like Igawa and Kennedy, so that is definitely a plus.|`|gwUq6HMUaa	Well, they already have made enough changes and I don't really see where Dunn would fit in. Also, Nady hasn't even played a full season as a Yankee (same with Swisher), so they should give them a chance and go from there.|`|PJF4J3iYaa	adam dunn is garbage|`|HeWUbyHJaa	I think that would be a GREAT move for the Yankees. That would give them another big bat that can crumble when they need it. Dunn would do great striking out twice every game and hitting all of his solo home runs. Wasting more money, and still most likely a third place team.|`|8hIs3dHsaa	No Way! Nady and Swisher are descent hitters, and Adam Dunn is just a big doof who can't play the field, has a terrible batting average, and strikes out way too much. I really think the Yankees are set pitching wise and hitting wise after signing Sabathia, Pettite, Burnett, and Texeira.|`|V03f8tmMaa	Na i think they should stick with Nady and Swisher they had pretty productive seasons last year|`|4293a0ff696620f3c5a721afbba4df64aa	They can't. They've already hit their quota of Type A or B free agents this year.|`|BAoI83foaa	I believe that if the Yankees trade anyone it will be Nady. They like Swisher and believe he could be a big bat off the bench. unless the right offer comes up i don't believe that Swisher would be traded. they Yankees don't have any interest in Dunn if they do sign anyone it would be Manny Ramirez|`|FfWeTACKaa	Probably won't happen. Nady definitely should be traded, he greatly over performed during his time in Pittsburgh. His numbers during his time with the Yankees are more likely what you will see.    Swisher should stay, and Dunn should be brought in. The Yankees have spent a ton of money and after that possible $12M given to Pettite it looks unlikely. The money used on Pettite should have been given to Dunn.    So to answer this question no the Yankees shouldn't trade Nady AND Swisher, just Nady.|`|MjZ1Pvydaa	He is jason giambi in right, I don't want someone who plays bad d and ks out a lot.

Those sponsors are in the game to turn a profit. Honda didn't need to pull out of F1...they chose to pull out of F1. I think if they had better results from the past seasons when they first came back in 2000 they would have possible stayed. Honda just couldn't justify supporting what was in theory a failed investment in F1, considering the massive losses they have sustained in the road car market.<br>  <br>  As far as what F1 needs to do to deal with the financial crisis they should do as they are now and even more. Find ways to cut costs without having it effect the racing in a negative way.|`|aYIEnd0Gaa	WE WILL DO VERY WELL THANK YOU.<br>  BUT THANKS FOR YOUR CONCERN.<br>  BUT WE ALREADY HAVE FUNDING IN PLACE FROM VARIOUS SPONSORS AND PARTNERS TO SECURE OUR FUTURE FOR MANY YEARS.

Lol0iLfgaa	www.stevepre.com is a great resource.    I know that he was a little bit on the cocky side, judging by all of his interviews.      According to the movie "Without Limits", Prefontaine became a runner by running away from bullies.  I don't know how accurate that is, but that is one take on it.  Also, you need to mention how obessed Pre was with going to Oregon in High School.  He could have gone to any school in the country, but wanted to run for Oregon.  Pre love Bill Bowwerman, even though they butted heads quite a bit.    As far as your last question goes... I don't know.  I wouldn't think so.    EDIT:  I almost forgot to add.  Watch the documentry on Pre called "Fire on the Track".  Great movie.|`|FaqsLRJEaa	I agree that Pre was a little cocky to start with.  He though he was the best American distance runner, and he had the stuff to back it up.

I just hope the can get back to winning so I can say ,The Drive For Five Is Still Alive again !|`|iO12Vjnvaa	It'd be neat but I don't think Ray is the caliber of crew chief he once was....I think he's very burned out with the sport. But it would be neat to see them teamed up again. Who knows maybe one day!!!    Just an opinion as always.|`|7RUMbREoaa	That would be sweet except for one thing-if that happened,there would only be mainly two different winners and two possible champions every season,Jeff Gordon and Jimmie Johnson.That would make for the greatest rivalry in NASCAR history    Johnson/Knaus vs. Gordon/Evernham in the same equipment.WOW!!!|`|muc8sq9naa	I don't think they could ever click together again enough to get the "rainbow" to shine.  I think their magic is gone now, so I don't believe it would do any good. So my answer is no.    *JAKD*|`|YHYT8qMKaa	It wouldn't hurt, but I'm not counting on it. I believe Jeff said that this won't ever happen again. Right now, I think Steve Letarte is a great crew chief. Things will get better for the  24 this year. Jeff has defended Steve 100%. If Jeff is happy with Steve, then I'm happy. Jeff doesn't need Ray to win championships. Jeff won many races and the championship in 2001 with Robbie Loomis. Ray was the best crew chief Jeff ever had, but I think Jeff and Steve are capable of winning races and championships together.|`|I6CGhbClaa	TRIPLE HELL YEAH!!! HE AND RAY WOULD BE GREAT TOGETHER AGAIN!|`|gEG4yJmGaa	I would just to see what will happen for one race. Then Jeff can go back to Letarte|`|PGlZn1wEaa	Ray's a sellout.  No.  Jeff doesn't need him.  He's one of the best race car drivers ever and has proved he doesn't need him.  The only thing Ray did for Jeff was improve on what the Wood Brothers brought into NASCAR several years before.   When Ray walked out on HMS and Kasey(GEM) he dug his own grave as far as I'm concerned.    I feel bad for Kasey.  I really do.  He was kinda dooped.|`|3f5eb6adc2988f8d8a7b40fe71ea20feaa	I would love to see him back. He might be the kind of person the 24 team that can get them over the top. I dont think he will return and be his crew chief but if he could be a consultant and be atop the pit box and help LeTarte on race day that would be awesome!|`|7B3TwoaSaa	I would like to see the two hook up again, but not under Hendrick.I say work under RCR or something.|`|pChoen9haa	I Would Actually Want Chad Knaus To Be Jeff Gordon's Crew Chief.|`|5xu0KnkGaa	an even better question, should ray help out JR. JR can't win with his current team ... not with eury jr ... maybe with eury sr.    hendrick could have the top 3 teams if he can find a crew chief for JR.
bIKfSJ9kaa	BBs hurt more. Paintballs have liquid inside. If one hits you, it will explode, sending pieces of its shell and paint in all directions, therefore, the energy will be dispersed.|`|fAMpj8s2aa	bbs if pumped enough. if pumped once than paintballs.|`|0dyIrY8Gaa	Well in paintball i got a lot of bruises but i never bled. unless you get shot like a couple feet away or less, itll just be a bruise.|`|7w1c7vVCaa	paintballs no matter what|`|2mxbb6ULaa	Well bb's are made of metal and are heavier and smaller and have a chance of penetrating your skin, so I would go with bb's hurting more.|`|QcmNHRzyaa	paintballs
AA10270018	The one that Roger Federer is using.|`|eY1Vttiyaa	1. Prestige Midplus  2. Radical Midplus  The Prestige is heavier than the Radical, but it has better control and less vibration.|`|JJ0OIiZ1aa	well it depends on your game style and preference. I play with the liquid metal radical, its a good racket for someone with solid strokes, and Spin friendly, but it's a little on the heavy side. I'd suggest going to tenniswarehouse.com and demoing some, its only 20 dollars and shipping's free.|`|ezjarBMKaa	my favorite is the Head Instinct Microgel.  great control and spin, you always get it in with however much power you want. strategy plus calculated power is much better than raw power
ZKikquiOaa	5 miles is a long ways, the most you'd hear from 5 miles away from a 12 ga is probably a little pop similar to when you're popping a bubble wrap, not the big ones the teeny tiny ones.  Even when I'm at the shooting line, about 100 meters away from the 12 gauge, it didn't sound that loud at all.|`|WrDGhduxaa	you may be able to hear a 12 gauge from more than 5 miles, but it is doubtful.  The circumstances would have to be perfect.
DbfG5Cpraa	If you use a lower flex, the stick is most likely to break at the shaft. If you use a higher flex, and it's to stiff for you, it's most likely to break at the blade. That's why it's important to choose the right flex for you.    I believe Chara uses a 120 flex. (or 115) "Bigger" players may use a 115.  The average NHL player uses a 100 flex. That is the most used flex, then 110 second, and 85 third.
GCufUbxJaa	stardust - the music sounds better with you.
gqx2H6mDaa	Do not put grease, grease will wreak your bearings.     The best thing to do is buy a skate tool that can help you insert them.     If you dont want to do that simply put the bearing on the wheel (where it needs to go) and put the wheel on the truck with the bearing still on the wheel facing the truck. Then just simply push down on the wheel and the bearing will pop into place.

a2DW1Bqgaa	The hitting, Back in the day they didnt make cotton pillows, only the down feathers. Thats why is all the movies it flies everywhere, just a stigma I guess. They actually poke and hurt pretty good. Its all about fun pain. You can take out the aggression and make it seem harmless!|`|KaQfKHkYaa	feathers!  what would be the fun if nothing got destroyed or without making a huge mess!|`|OhMHSy9Oaa	its a good combination of both. hitting is always fun, and its great because its nearly impossible to get injured. the feathers are good for  showing how hard you hit and stuff like that... kind of like blood coming off a charcter in a video game. also the most important part of a pillow fight is girls.
LaBxzWa7aa	His contract's on hold because when EliteXC folded, the former company CEO took hold of the contracts.    So it'll be quite a time before he can fight, but when he can he'll probably fight in Japan.    It's very likely Affliction will recruit him, he's quite a draw, even after his loss.     I think it's very likely he'll get a rematch with Petruzelli, and I hope he beats the **** out of him.    I'm no Kimbo Fan, but Petruzelli is just such a low-level fffaggot with no honor.    He said **** like Kimbo was scared of him and stuff.    Just can't stand it when a fighter beats his opponent, looks in his opponent's eyes, shakes his hand with respect and than talks **** after that.|`|cj8iM1Olaa	Haha, Dana White said he could be a contestant on next season's Ultimate Fighter.|`|pSiwm8rmaa	I fight that big ******..and I am terrible stand up..but he is dumb ****** American..no problem for win easy with *** kicking.|`|E14cuDlZaa	I'm sure he'll return to fighting soon. What a Legend.|`|2F2dHCSVaa	There has been some nterest b the folks at DREAM, K-1  I don't think you will see him in UFC, but maybe Affliction just for the ratings, although after his last performance he may not be the draw he was last year for Elite XC
4d7b908cfe24bf3f1177a5cca13feb22aa	You're hitting a round object, I don't think it's possible to hit the same spot with punches coming from different angles.  I can put it close, but really, the angle isn't right.  Don't worry as much about putting the punch in the same spot as you do about making good contact.    If you ask me, a straight right isn't as straight as a jab.  I think it has to do with your stance and angle to the bag.  I certainly don't throw a straight right perfectly straight unless I tilt my body a little too much to the left.  If you could video-tape your 1-2 combo and put it up on youtube, I'd love to see it.|`|2WkY4VHVaa	keep your eyes open, maybe get a laser sight foir your fists so you can see where it will hit|`|M0ZDvXrAaa	thats what practice is for. look where ya wanna hit and dont try to go too fast at first.|`|wscyjkPAaa	Practice it slower.  Pick a spot on the bag to hit, hit it with a jab then rotate your hips and pivot, keep your elbows in and pretend that there is a straight line from your right shoulder to your right fist.   When you connect, you should look like you're looking through the sights of a rifle with your right arm being the barrell.  Work on your form in front of the mirror until you get it perfect, then get on the bag again and watch the improvement.|`|iJ8MQ5HZaa	www.rossboxing.com
d0bd239f3c115d58ab2ab71d96618ad2aa	Mate, there are all kinds of Jackasses in this world. A few even get badges.    There should be an address on the ticket to lodge an appeal or apply for mitigation of penalty. Write a letter and give it your best shot.(BIG TIP, try to be polite, respectful and include references). They might be impressed that someone who hangs around a skate park can still put together a coherent letter.    The odds are you will just get a letter back saying the fine stands. I reckon you have a snowball's chance in hell, but who knows, stranger things have happened. Maybe this could lead to a career in law.    It only costs a few cents to write a letter. Taking it to "court" is likely to incur other fees and charges if you lose.     You are best off to pay attention to signs and anybody that can stick you with a fine. It can get kind of expensive if you don't.    Good luck|`|lDbNf3h9aa	A bicycle is not a skate-board. Have Mommy pay the fine and stay out of the park|`|DOVbF4Piaa	No it says specifically, "Only skating may be done inside the park", and driving a car is driving a car smarts, I haven't looked up the definition but I'm sure skating is skateboards rollerblades bikes and scooters    Since when are bikes considered skates ?|`|p1zkFTbbaa	doubt it.If it said "Skateboards only" than it's your fault.|`|ER9LoAkraa	Well, by your logic you can drive a car in the park too (rolling on wheels) But you know that's wrong.     If you look up the definition you will see you don't have a leg to stand on. BTW, $80 is a ridicules amount for a ticket of this sort. But your are out of luck my friend.|`|AA10161173	Chances are, if the sign says Skateboarding Only, you are not allowed to be in there with your BMX bikes. Some places do enforce that and unfortunately, you got nabbed for entering with "improper" equipment. Take your case to a judge, but I don't think you're going to win.
a6a555da6f939b85469e3c83f71c0ecaaa	Is like a boot to add additional support and better fit.  They can be color coordinated.|`|PG1LuEk5aa	It is ankle tape....so they dont turn an ankle the wrong way....its called a wrap
5LxpvXSmaa	I think he isn't   because he bunted Vince yes but it is all part of the storyline and i think Shane did an awesome job going after him the other night. Who cares if it is scripted. I like seeing Shane take control|`|aOCfLAJJaa	Yes, out of a cannon, into Triple H.|`|GJsIZeUIaa	Nah, just a storyline.|`|6E16tR6xaa	No just a storyline. They wouldnt fire one of their best heels.|`|U6tE9LhJaa	**** NO|`|T13xM9iJaa	No its a storyline|`|4ad21c8bd9ed4a91c2d622b918f0138daa	nope its a storyline and vince isnt going to just fire one of the top heels in this business today. Not a bad storyline though legacy vs the McMahons. I wonder if wwe is going to make randy the WHC at wrestlemania|`|sCTF61c3aa	nope. he definetaly is one of the best heels, fans would be really upset|`|eJDRyYNaaa	No. Instead, he was punished with Shane McMahon's FAKE punches.|`|sfFFQniwaa	um if he fired in script its not like he can still wrestle in real lyfe theyl probably just do what they did with y2j|`|kJhZx5Mcaa	No way they wont fire him he will beat Cena 4 da World Championship at WM 25.
dfBwVxXFaa	wrong section.|`|Y4mz8BShaa	An M14 is not a sniper rifle. Stay off that website. Poor quality airsoft gun, too.    Don't use .12's unless it shoots under 225 with a .20, and never in electric airsoft guns. They have very poor accuracy and easily break inside of the airsoft gun, damaging the internals, and chip on mesh goggles, potentially damaging another player's eyes.    Airsoft goes in Other - Outdoor Recreation.|`|dq5DjePqaa	I would use the 12. The lighter 12 goes further thus it has greater velocity. Great choice for close range. The 20g is more accurate but a lot slower.
rQgYL4Zzaa	stars make up to $1million a yr john aloisi    average players for instance mark milligan gets $150,000 a year     bench players such as Koffe Danning who has just launch paded his career fetches $10,000 a season
h2KkiKK3aa	they both work, but I prefer the magnesium starter, since you can use the magnesium as a high temp tinder to help start the fire, you can get these at walmart for around $10, coghlands brand, really good, have one in my survival kit.  it's spelled swedish and they are good if you need them.|`|JSGLKnA4aa	it's swedish! the GI magnesium longer strip to strike. you can use the back of any knife on it or steel your choice.|`|CbhRi72Aaa	Both work great, I have used them both in the backcountry. They are both the same material, magnesium alloy. I like the "Swedish" fire steel better, it is more comfortable to use, and it comes with a better striker. As far as which one lasts longer, does it really matter? either one will light thousands of fires, if you know what you're doing, and it costs a little more than a Bic lighter. It would take years of everyday use to wear one down beyond use, at which point you could buy a new one.
JQXCdGHYaa	Most likely the carb is not plugged in. Plug it in and see what happens.    Good Luck!|`|vIonh5mnaa	Sounds like the carb is plugged. Take the carb off, take it apart and thoroughly clean out all the passages with some carb. cleaner.  Use compressed air to blow out the passages. Check the diaghram and be sure it is not torn or ripped.   Make sure the pilot jet is not plugged.  Be sure the fuel lines are not kinked or plugged.      As far as the track is concerned, check the primary clutch for a binding spring.  Also check the fly weights and make sure the move freely and do not bind.  Check the secondary clutch also and be sure the spring is not binding.
hTruYNUQaa	The centenary test at the MCG in 1977 between Australia and England.    The match had the same result as it did 100 years earlier with Australia winning by 45 runs.The match was remembered for Rick Mckosker getting smashed on the jaw by Bob Willis.When he came out to bat in the second innings to a thunderous applause he made 25 gutsy runs whilst Rod Marsh remained 110 not out.    The great DK Lillee took match figures of 11/165,whilst for England Derek Randall made a brilliant 174.|`|cb9KqrUyaa	I have many but Matthew Hayden's 380 and Jason Gillespies 201 are just 2 that stand out in my mind.    And seeing Glen McGrath,Shane Warne and Justin Langer all retire together after the Ashes in 2007 is another of my favorites.|`|LzkujA3Faa	Actually there are too many. One is Hayden's fastest century off 60 odd balls against West Indies in the World Cup. Gilly's century in the 2007 world cup final is also my favourite.    Australia winning the last Ashes 5-0 is one thing i will never forget!|`|E0KjlJLjaa	MY FAVOURITE MEMORY IS THAT WHEN SHAHID AFRIDI WAS HITTING 9 SIX AGAINST INDIA  IN INDIA|`|GGuXJJeAaa	I have too many to mention... I like especially when Nasser Hussain (former captain of england) congratulated Steve Waugh for his century in sydney it was one of the speculated last test game of Steve, he went on to play for few more games after that...  even channel 9 delayed their news telecast... it's just lovely to see our local hero still has got what it takes after coping a lot of criticisms..|`|caAuJJwGaa	Being at the SCG to see Steve Waugh make his career saving century.|`|AA11088802	Many     but watch the highest run chase ever match live on TV was the amazing moment|`|jhmeSGQFaa	Brian lara scoring 400 vs england     a wonderful innings|`|bbf096ad6f74d4fe631cb97301e1a43baa	The "ball of the century" Shane Warne's first ball in a test match in England which bowled Mike Gatting that was brilliant, but there are so many great memories to choose from.

iO12Vjnvaa	I have been to the track but unfortunately never during the Daytona 500....it kills me that I haven't got to go yet.....but it's definitely on my bucket list!!!! lol! To me while in Daytona you must see Daytona USA on the same property as the speedway. The dog track next door...and the Friendly's restaurant across the street....good food good price.    Just an opinion as always.|`|Qw4l9R68aa	I've been to two, 2006 and 2007.|`|JSryPP8faa	Just park the car, enter the premises and enjoy one of the best day's of your life. It's all there. The souvenir hauler's, the exhibit's, the men and women of our Armed Forces, the fly-over's and the greatest race on earth. PERIOD!!!!!|`|c3tADklmaa	No, but lucky you!|`|OFFjKX72aa	I entered a contest to win some tickets but I don't think I won. I haven't been to Daytona yet but I hope to go there soon.|`|sQeyUGqLaa	I go to both the races there along with some other things so i would try to get tickets to the monday car introduction its at daytona usa stay there when it gets less packed then its fun.next go to the flea market its only use full when nascar comes to town. go to the beach if you need help parking just park at this shopping mall its pretty cheap head to the beach not for long though if you like hooters there is one across the street. There is a best buy across the street and make at all the free stuff last time i whent i signed some thing for motorsports authentics and got a free elite car.So this just beats the whether i am in right now I am going this year thought.|`|muc8sq9naa	Sadly (and green with envy!)  I have never been.  But if I were going, I would spend every waking moment doing anything and everything I could, and taking it all in.  Have a great time.    *JAKD*|`|PGlZn1wEaa	Several times.  Simply relax, roam around the inside and outside of the track and enjoy our great weather and watch some racing.  There is a cool country bar(although I'm not into country) along A1A (I think thats the road).  Hit Daytona USA and the beach.  Just chill.  Our friends up north are scraping ice and shoveling snow..    Enjoy.|`|MqdSjSvnaa	I have not.  I'm going for the first time this year.|`|5LxpvXSmaa	i have only been once and that was in 1992 so i am sure things have changed. Hit the beach and read all the local papers to see if you can catch any appearances by drivers. Be sure you go to Daytona USA and have a great time.|`|E5mFWOqqaa	Never been to Daytona for the 500, but I've been to the Shootout since 2002 annually. Already bought my tickets for 2009.    Must things to see: If you are going to be there early (like days early) go to the FanZone. It's really cool. On the less crowded days like the regular days with only practice and qualifying, the FanZone tickets are only like $20.    I would say also that you gotta go into the Daytona 500 experience, but I've not been there so I couldn't tell you. Just tour the freebie trailers outside of turn 4, get all the free stuff you can, and then wander FanZone.|`|VQHGqYXvaa	Yep been there the last 17 years for the 500 !!|`|qZpcgXgDaa	no, and i really want to go to one.|`|4QBvQ9gDaa	Don't go to Daytona! It's becoming the next compton. There's murder, rape and stealing going on every day. Last year we had 93 murders and 207 rapes. People don't even walk at night. Our college was broken into and they stoled computers, tv's and books. It's so bad that im leaving.|`|gEG4yJmGaa	Yes many times, if I were you I would get an infield spot by Turn 3 and camp out for the whole week! There are parties every night and you see drivers pass by on golf carts all the time. If you are a beer drinker, your set! Beers Galore! Another thing to do is the Daytona USA, the souvineer haulers and the Nationwide, Truck races. TRUE STORY- In 2008 when Michael Waltrip won the outside pole, he drove through the tracks infield, our family met him and got pics and autographs!|`|4OM3A44Saa	5 times.|`|5Hh4Stj8aa	No, but I would love to go down there. I just hope its not ungodly hot, and that the cars won't slip and slide to the point where it affects the racing.|`|48NOH6fbaa	Yes, we went to the 50th, last year.  Take time to explore the trailers better during week days, friday and saturday is too crowd.  We walked to our Hotel (30 min) and it was SAFE. We are planning to go again next year 2010.  Also don't miss the farmers flea market, your will find lots of cars, t-shirts, and all kind of things related to the race at better price than at the track.  If you don't find it at the flea market buy it at the track.  It is huge so plan around 1/2 day to see it.  Enjoy it !!!!!  Relax, I am not a big fan of race as my husband and I really enjoy that week. Also go to "where everything begin....  Daytona Beach.." You can really drive your car on the sand. Too much to do for a weekend, try to spend at least a week.|`|mvahMk6Vaa	Daytona is dangerous. There's lots of drug dealers and at night it's really unsafe. I would carry some pepper spray.
muc8sq9naa	There is no way to know exactly which drivers will be running in each race until after qualifying for each individual race!    *JAKD*|`|iO12Vjnvaa	I would have to say no....because you never know about the one off deals and things....so Nascar has no way knowing exactly how many cars will show up for each race in the future....usually they don't post entry lists until the Wed or Thurs before a race. I think the teams have a 2 week deadline to enter a given race....so it's always up in the air until 2 weeks prior and NASCAR is never in any hurry to make that info privvy to the general public. Just an opinion as always....very interesting question!|`|MqdSjSvnaa	I don't believe so.  But I might be able to help depending on the driver...|`|PGlZn1wEaa	Yeah that's a difficult one.   The regulars are a given but there are probably 20 drivers that can race or not race from week to week depending on a lot of variables.  UH-liyah will help yah out.|`|E5mFWOqqaa	Well, you can figure out a bunch of them, since a lot of drivers will be running the full season.    If you look on Jayski, you can find the schedules for most of the drivers who are going to run a part-time schedule.|`|4l0yGuE9aa	It's called "the starting line-up" and it is posted on www.nascar.com when the drivers qualify for each race. Once they qualify then you can view the list.     Here is a list of some of the drivers that MIGHT attempt to qualify for each race http://www.nascar.com/drivers/list/cup/d...|`|0Pd6INebaa	that information is not possible to find. Owner points will determine the drivers that are "locked in" after each race starting after the fifth race of the season. The first five races will be determined by last years final owners points. So, you'll have to look up the owners points after each race to find out who is automatically in for the next race|`|vkT7xRuxaa	Not each race, but look up jayski's blog on google, and click on jayski.com or something like that. It will take you to a main page. You can click to Nascar 2009 silly season and it tells you all the changes you need to know.
3mMElwb0aa	Wonderful.    Yet another illiterate question.    My gosh, can we not impose an IQ requirement for membership here?|`|AA11088802	what is it|`|f9hiPMDxaa	I go along with OO7, with batting scores like tthat he would have to be right up there with the greatest all rounders.|`|E5mFWOqqaa	It would help if, instead of trying to fit your whole question in a space it's not going to fit, to actually ask it here.

vlISWIOSaa	Hello!    I have a Remington 700 Varmint Special (24" barrel) that I use as my 1000 yard rifle. I am very happy with the accuracy.     You need to gradually work up to your load ... You can also talk to the folks at Sierra ... they are very helpful with load development! They can be reached at 1-800-223-8799!    I use the RCBS competition dies, and use the following recipe.     Lake City Match Brass  CCI Benchrest Large Rifle Primers  Sierra 175 grain MatchKing bullet    I use either of the following powder charges (DO NOT MIX THE POWDERS!):  IMR 4895 ... 41.5 grains, or  Accurate Arms 2520 ... 42.0 grains.    Good luck and good shooting!|`|YrxLbfiIaa	This may be of help.....    http://www.6mmbr.com/308Win.html|`|xOReEw6Waa	Each rifle will respond differently to powder loads and types, so you could be loading anything from Hodgdon to Alliance, to who knows what.   168 MatchKings and Palma bullets are the standard for long range targeting. If you are looking at a hunting/varmint bullet then 150 grain to 180 grain are in the best range, although you can go as low as 110s.   This is a link to the Palma info:http://www.sierrabullets.com/techservice...    Get a good reloading manual, or the 308 specific book. Most powder companies and bullet manufacturers have load references on web sites now.|`|b1f68fe4a7602cd05ee10c7b596c5a1baa	An internet general forum like this one is not a good place for reloading data. If you haven't already get a reloading  manual. You might visit some of the shooting related forums and get some advice. There are several in the Yuku forums.
z7JsVzcnaa	Goalie  Close Defense  Long Pole Midi  Offensive Midi  Defensive Midi  Attack  Face Off (Can be a specialized player  who faces off only or it can be a midi)    Explaining in detail what all the players do, is far too complicated but I'll give a general rundown.    Goalie: Pretty self explanatory.  Stops the other team from scoring by making saves.  Also runs the clear.    Close Defense: Defends against the other team's attackmen    LPM: A midfielder that plays defense with a long stick    Offensive Midi:  Midi that specializes in playing offense, but has to be a a competent defender as well to guard opposing team's midis    Defensive Midi: Midfielder that specializes in playing defense against the opposing team's midis    Face off guy: a player who takes facesoffs.    Attack:  Offensive players that spend a fair share of their time playing behind the opposing team's goal.

AA11610448	Yes and no.  Swimming strenuously will burn a lot of calories and build muscle and trim you down.  but, it will require more effort than some other activities.  apparently, the water keeps the body temperature down, makiing it somewhat harder to dissolve the fat in your body.|`|YR11l7MSaa	Yes it will.  If you swim for a 1/2 hour or more a day or so you def. will lose weight.

The weight you will lose while swimming will be body fat not muscle, and it is a fantastic exercise for building upper body and lower body strength.|`|aQLTXwUbaa	Its not the best exercise for losing weight so it might be right for you.  It tones amazingly and builds the upper body in particular.  not so much for the lower body.

KmzjSnzVaa	Twisting your spines while throwing punches puts pressure on your discs. Therefore you need to avoid exercise that involves twisting i.e. punching and sit ups for a week or so.... plus running. Good for long walks. You need to ice your back straight after working out so that the swelling in your discs goes down.    You may have even developed a weak spot in your core. This isn't the end of the world. You can build it all back up again. The BEST thing to do is to see a specialist ASAP. Not a quack. Maybe a physical therapist to get a workout program going. Don't messabout this back. Good luck to you champ, you can fix this with the right attitude.

KHznTmpsaa	In high school I swam the 500 and 4x100 relay as well. I found that my high School coach had me swim long distances during practice. It was like I only trained for that race even though I also swam the 100 fly sprint. Anyway I hit a platue and was frustrated. My club coach had me swim workouts for a month with nothing over a 200 in it and my times dropped like a rock. Maybe you need to change the training a little So talk to your coach.     Also a six beat kick is where you kick six times in one stroke cycle. Its a fairly fast beat.|`|t0PzSCs0aa	I've reached a plateau personally, but i may be able to help.    in the 500, manage your speed. dont try to sprint the whole thing, you'll get tired. make sure your start, turns, and finish are strong.  work on your endurance so that you can increase your speed.    work on your endurance all around and try doing sprints in and out of the water.|`|YHtpB3wBaa	The best advice I can give is treat every set in practice like a race.  Try to beat the swimmer in the lane next to you.  Memorize all of your fastest practice times at the most common distances and try to beat them.  Another thing to try is pick one thing to really work on every practice.  One day might be getting your head down, the next might be underwaters, another might be keeping a 6 beat kick through out the entire practice.  Keep working and you WILL get better.  It might take a long time but do not give in. Happy swimming.

You could also go to a gym and ask for good exercises to do when you are taking time off. I do gymnastics myself and i work out 16 hours a week so you should deffinitly work out alot. Lots of good exercises are v-ups, push-ups, running, splits, bridges, ect....

xb0Jidr1aa	Don't listen to that person who said that kids your age should be running a 5 minute mile because most don't.  Yes you should join track.  Looking at your mile time you might want to go for a shorter distance like the 400 or maybe the 800.  When you join the coaches should be able to help find the right event for you.  And it doesn't matter that you are very skinny.  I'm a freshman and weigh less than you (mostly because I am quite short) and I am pretty good at running.  You should definitely join.|`|3kaa5Vfkaa	yea go|`|ypL0PJ4Iaa	Your slow. Try a diffrent event. A kid at your age should run a 5 minute mile|`|5uIWjTHVaa	Ok. Here is the skinny..<br>  <br>  A. Your a freshman. Even if it doesn't work out this year, you have 3 more. Keep at it.<br>  <br>  B. Skinny is WAY better for running than being big and brawny. Aerodynamics, amount of weight your carrying, all comes down to it. You would have to get some killer calves, quads, and hamstrings. <br>  <br>  C. A 7:35 mile, while pushing it, is bad. Not saying it is horrible, your in better shape than some people, but if you wanted to do say, varsity track, not likely this year. <br>  <br>  D. It also depends on what you want to do in Track and Field. You could do javelin, shot put, or long jump/high jump, which takes running, but a far less amount (long jump is for really fast people). There are sprints n dashes (same thing), hurdles, and cross country. Cross country is about pace, and stamina. Hurdles is speed, accuracy, and agility (but all running is agility really). And sprinting, well.. It's sprinting. <br>  <br>  The information you provided didn't provide us with much, but give it a shot, and go to the practices and have them tell you your not good enough, not some people over the internet. <br>  <br>  <br>  P.S. - On your next question, leave out the non important information - (i.e. - I can't go to practice today, busy. Or I'm going friday) Make it short and to the point and you may engage your readers a little more into answering it.

QtjnmEzoaa	I suppose my story would define the word "fan" very loosely.  I was at the Texans at Colts game this season, and in the middle of the first quarter, a lady wearing a business suit came in with her family. They walked in front of our entire row DURING A 3RD DOWN CONVERSION PLAY to get to their seats, only to realize that their seats were, in fact, at the beginning of the row they had just walked through. Therefore, they had to pass through us again in order to find their seats. They sat down an proceded to show no interest whatsoever in the game. The woman got a call on her cell phone and attempted to quiet the crowd around her in order to hear that call. I'm actually quite shocked she made it out of the stadium intact.|`|KTp27Fokaa	Some guy was walking out of the Jets-Broncos game (when the game was out of reach) and was saying "Cutler is a whore!"

He said, I should take it off, since Moss wanted a trade. He started pulling out alot of his Cowboys merchandise ( Helmets / Jerseys / Pictures, etc ) I told him we defeated the Cowboys last time we played them. He denied it.. I told him we hadnt lost to the Cowboys since 1996. and that we were the only NFL team to never lose a regular game at Texas stadium, besides the Ravens who had never played there at the time.. He didnt want to admit the Cowboys had lost to the Raiders the yr before ( 2005 ) he pulled out a schedule ( 24beer schedules you get when you buy a pack of beer ) and shows me the Raiders were not in the Cowboys schedule. Which they werent.. He was showing the 2006 schedule. Till this day, he claims Cowboys never lost to the Raiders.. I had it recorded and i never heard from him..|`|exOOXAkBaa	Some dude in  Lambeau field shaking his booty all negated and drinking; and saying "Steelers suck!!!"|`|VbrtwQSWaa	All the brand new Cardinal "Fans"    Oh and the idiot that poured the cooler of ice on himself during the steelers game that was like below 0|`|8UTJ0kFNaa	Any of the fans who take their shirts off and paint their chests in freezing weather would have to be in a tie on that one.

What else they going to do with the taxpayers time?|`|0Fi9EANKaa	Ironpump who is on this site  he is such a hypocrite...I remember him crying about the officiating week two about his Chargers and posting questions like "The refs blew is again???" but ever since then if anyone complained about a bad call in the nfl, he'd respond with "yeah go ahead blame the refs"    that guy truly defines the meaning of a hypocrite.|`|VUvvQ5nkaa	Any bandwagon fans|`|B5BWocvZaa	the week before the ravens steelers playoff game, my friend wore a steelers jersey one day, and a ravens jersey the next day|`|PSMsDalLaa	Well I listen to a lot of dumb Cowboy, Patriot, and Jet fans.    It wasn't exatcly a fan, my story really. It was hearing about how likely the Jet-Giant SB was gonna be.    I mean my Giants were the best team in the league at the time, so they were as good a choice as anyone in the NFC I guess.    But the Jets are the Jets. They'll never be in the Super Bowl. Id say the Lions are more likely.|`|ak44mIy3aa	Any Patriots fan jijijij yeah i said it. jk jk    Well there was a guy that threw his beer to Chad Johnson while he was celebrating, i mean that is pretty dumb why would you waste your beer like that?|`|6yknPnOVaa	A dumb Eagles fan who didn't know a game could end in a tie.|`|T0FTAeDoaa	well Kendall, since we always argue imma say u|`|Fl4b4Yd4aa	this isnt the dumbest fan but its funny I was at an eagles game and this guy had a Jersey  that said mad dog and his face painted and stuff well on the giant TV it said eagles biggest fans and it said mad dog and the  guy sitting next to him was like hey there you are but the guy looked up and he was like "what the hell thats not me that guy has blue eyes and brown hair where the hell did they get that guy"|`|ZWMOHQAlaa	those guys how paint their teams letters on their chest in like sub-zero weather...

And I said "Tough loss against the Eagles, right?"    And he was like "Oh, they lost? I didn't even know the Giants were in the Super Bowl until I watched it last year".    And he says he is a big Giants fan.

FYd1ndVxaa	Wow. You love tennis so much like I do. I'm excited. Anyone is possible to win that. I have no idea this time whether Roddick is really mature enough to beat Federer, but it's ok whoever wins today. I just love to see Federer break Sampras' record.|`|gWLhIoIiaa	lol thats so cute sneaking to watch tennis    hopefully it will be a good match and not some boring blowout|`|e7f9613d5b480e9758d037bfe66ac6b9aa	its going to be great match|`|tjImPvzOaa	I'll be watching it and I'm pretty sure Roddick will win.|`|6S8KjBLQaa	Oh hells no will i be staying up til 3:30, I'll DVR it though,  A-rod will win!|`|Ectn7tkSaa	I am excited for any Andy Roddick game!  He is my favourite player.  i live in Australia so the game will be on at 7.30pm for me so that is a good time.  I want Andy Roddick to win...I just don't have high hopes that he will unfortunately!|`|75ZMWlnnaa	im excited LOL    but seriously it will be a good match, i do not see roddick winning, but i do hope that he will put up a real fight to federer, i just do not want to see federer winning 6-4, 6-0, 6-2 like he did 2 years ago at this exact same stage, that was just bad.    i want to see roger tested again because if he is, i feel that it will hold him in good stead for the final and will give him even more confidence that in tight matches, he will have the mental edge over his opponent, which i think is the most important thing.    i predict a federer win in 4 sets- a scoreline of maybe 6-4, 6-7, 7-5, 6-2.    but...great to see roddick in a grand slam SF again, it sure has been a long long time. but i want roger to win his 14th slam at AO.|`|n3CVPXrVaa	NADAL FAN ALLLLL DA WAYYY!!!!!! GO RAFA WOOP WOOP|`|A46UYUNNaa	federer!|`|wFzV0T22aa	federe  5 set match tho  v close|`|lZNYIpBZaa	I hate to say it but it doesn't matter who Nadal plays in the finals...he'll win. With Federer, he might make it a 4 set match. With Roddick playing Nadal, it will be straight sets.    But I do think Federer is hungrier & wants to prove he is better than Nadal, so he'll beat Roddick in 4 sets|`|ixKOGishaa	Me I'm totally excited!!I'm skipping my night classes tonight to watch the match!Its gonna be really exciting tonight but I'm sure Fed is going to bring his super A game against Roddick cause Roddick is an old rival of his like Marat Safin so Fed will be playing his heart out tonight .Roddick is in tip top shape but when Federer's playing phenomenal tennis  he's unstoppable .I'm supporting Federer for the win all the way!|`|U7BkuEU9aa	I'll be up at 6.30 am for Andy and Fed for sure...I gotta say though, whoever wins it'll be bittersweet because I usually don't want either to lose - unless they're playing Rafa, of course! But even then, I gotta say that after the Wimbledon final, even though I was unbelievably happy for Rafa, seeing how Roger got afterwards, specially when he had to answer the exact same depressing questions in English, French AND German during the press conference, completely broke my heart...|`|3d3d2a18b838d322464051559bd8c0e3aa	I'm lucky because the game starts at 4.30 p.m. (but you're also lucky 'cause you don't have to skip school in order to watch the US Open final)    I'm rooting for Federer all the way. Federer crushed Del Potro, I can't see why he can lose to Roddick.|`|TZ6GdF27aa	Me!!  my whole family LOVES tennis!  Who are you going for?|`|dWX9xM0caa	me. i hope federer kicks his a*s! i hate roddick. he may be good but hes cocky.   P.S:NADAL WILL WIN THE TOURNAMENT!|`|j1BTIYcCaa	It should be a good match but we in our house will be watching Federer win. We like Roddick too but love Federer first.|`|dU1z69H6aa	i'm definitely not going to stay up late as i have work tomorrow morning BUT i know federer will totally crush roddick tonight.|`|AbDAdrXkaa	I am so excited!! =) i think federer will win in 5 sets we just have to wait and see!!!|`|JUurHgOSaa	I am deifinitely staying up late for this match. I think Roddick is in better shape than before, but the way Federer beat del Potro, Roddick has no chance.|`|GAsHsBEGaa	I'm more excited on seeing Nadal vs. Verdasco. I'd rather watch my fellow Spaniards battle it out. But for Roger and Roddick....argh....umm...I'll go w/ Roger.|`|vS3L1gadaa	Hell yeah! I want Andy to win though, although Roger would probably crush him.
dDhTMacAaa	Very tired.    and it's pretty dumb because he was never convicted.|`|ovBNkYtpaa	yeah , stop bringin up false allegations from the past.|`|YeNp4m8haa	I know|`|V4D5vciuaa	I KNOW IT GETS SO ANNOYING!!!!!!!!! when ever I say Im a Laker fan they always say why there best player is a rapist.

But I don't think that stupid lil' kid is gonna stop, because he wants all our attention.          ------------------------------------|`|u4CuUmwdaa	yes he probally did do the girl but not rape her.

HATERS!!!|`|I2I843Myaa	I can see why people would be mad that he raped a girl.|`|XrCc85kNaa	I guess...  But I am pretty sure they know that he didn't..    So..I am cool..|`|g0WLiXa1aa	yes, because they weren't there if/when it happened, so no one has the right to comment on a situation that they don't know jack **** about.|`|2dgVkcVAaa	i'm tired of,       Who's better kobe or lebron?
dDhTMacAaa	A couple good games can't get you the vote.      Devin Harris still deserves the  1 Reserve spot.     Mo can take the next, all I care is that the former Mav (and still-should-be Mav) gets in.|`|vzH7f7V5aa	Yeah. All the Cavs Starters should be Up there somewhere.|`|QooRDaCgaa	He is averaging only 4.1 assists per game this season and he's a point guard? NO. Also take that "Yes we can" quote off, its been overused.|`|WK3Kx4Mkaa	He has been doing good I give him that but if he kept a consistent 40 which is pretty damn hard and maybe 30 at least then yes but for now no in my opinion|`|qjat4aLxaa	I think not yet, maybe next year because hes not been like that for the whole season. Theres other players that put up performances like him, but unfortunately they didn't make the allstar Team, such as Jose Calderon from the Toronto Raptors. He was the one of the best point gaurds in the NBA last year averaging the least turn over rate, but styll didnt make it...What im tryin to say is that it will take Mo Williams a couple of more years.|`|efonvqTmaa	Hell yea.!  He just scored 41 points and 11 assists lol|`|FWZ4Obocaa	If he doesn't it'll be a snub and a travesty.     I can't remember the last time that the top-seeded team in the East only got one player in the All-Star game.  They deserve at least 2...I'd makes an argument for Zydrunas before he was injured that is.     LeBron James is good, but Batman ain't Batman without Robin (ala Mo).|`|21J0IIZbaa	The first two reserve guards should be Joe Johsnon, and Devin Harris.  The next guards in line would be Andre Iguodala and Ben Gordon.  Then Mo Williams would be next.|`|khbLZQHIaa	Yes.    Where would the Cavs be without him?  I can bet they'd have a Heat type record and Delonte West would be our PG.  Not exactly what the Cavs would want.    Mo plays a huge part and definatly deserves to be an all-star.  The only thing holding him back is all of the guards that have a chance to make it.|`|ZAh8CEoGaa	He deserves it. He has great stats and he plays a very big part on the Cavs sucess ever since he arrived to Cleveland.|`|AsvVWfiHaa	i'm gonna have to say NO.    don't get me wrong...he's playing good ball right now. but his play over the passed week only elevated his scoring average to 17 per game...and the 4 assists per game for a PG is not All Star caliber.  i feel you tho...this argument can be made for a lot of players every year.|`|vFbzBo4eaa	Yes,he does|`|P93I8CHtaa	by how hes been playing,i think he does deserve to be a reserve|`|2dgVkcVAaa	he has 2 averaged 25 points and 5 assists all year 2 make it on reserve team and not 25pts in just 7 games.|`|fuYYRJXtaa	NBA.COM said today that it may have been too late for Mo Williams to shine & impress the coaches cause they closed the polls Late Monday...    I think he should get in though.. Him, Jameer Nelson or Devin Harris.|`|B5BWocvZaa	definately. he has been heating up, and has developed into an awesome point guard. he was 2 rebounds away from a triple double. how often do you see a point guard get a triple double?|`|F65Km3Coaa	YES|`|GBGcI509aa	He should be yes.|`|WLXFAeSnaa	Heck yeah!! I have heard it in quite a few places that he will be a reserve for the All-Star game.

51e7baee76cfe5758f817c35c038f4c7aa	Yes.  There comes a time when you have to say enough is enough in football and let each team take home the tie.  Any longer on the field and you will get people really hurt or they will not recover for the next game.    Personally, I think that baseball should end in a tie after something like 12 innings or something.  You decimate a bullpen staff for a week in games that go much longer.|`|ak44mIy3aa	No that is useless specially because of the recording system that football has, it doesn't work really. This is not soccer where a tie equals 1 point and a win equals 3 points while a loss well its 0. Since football doesn't have a point sistem it is really useless to have ties.    They should end it in OT until someone records a field goal. I don't care if it wares them out, that is why you have back ups and the depth requirements in football teams helps a lot when first string players are worn out,  it is almost impossible to use all of your players of your depth chart out, of the players being tired. Also it helps backups to shine every now and then, i mean that is why they get pay so much right? TO PLAY PRO FOOTBALL not to warm up a bleacher for a whole year.|`|SaeUxO6Gaa	I don't have a problem with regular season games ending in a tie, though it obviously can't happen come playoff time.  A tie doesn't subtract from the significance of regular season games; a 1/4 of a game difference in records would have changed the AFC playoff teams and their seeding.    The problem I - and everyone else in the world - has with the NFL's sudden death overtime rules is that it heavily favors the coin toss winner.  It's not hard to get into field goal range against a tired defense.    The way it should work is that whoever gets 6 points first or who is ahead after 15 minutes (whichever comes first) wins.  Simple, and much more convincing.  A TD wins automatically, and if you start with a quick field goal the other team has a chance to answer.    If that's not realistic for regular season play because of injury risk, TV timing, or whatever... a tie is fine.|`|8paBQAk5aa	No i don't think that any game should ever end in a tie at a NFL game. These teams prepare ALL week for this one game at the end. They should decide who prepared better instead of a tie. What a sissy thing to do. Kudos to whoever agrees with me.|`|QtjnmEzoaa	I think there are some situations in which it is appropriate and the game just needs to end in order to prevent players from being worn out or injured. I think the rules are okay the way they are. If games ended in a tie every week, I'd say they needed to add an extra overtime quarter. But because of the rarity of it, I don't see a strong need to change it. No one wants to watch an inept offense play for five hours. Honestly, if neither team can manage a field goal in one quarter, neither team deserves to win. You can say it's good defense, but any offense should be capable of 3 points in a situation like that.|`|5gG2OfHIaa	A tie seems to a good result in many games.  I favor ties in the NCAA and the NFL.   The statistics crowd of the teenager SI and ESPN consumers and the tv sportswriters love number crunching.  The modern fan is focused on the W-L line and if tired players at the college or pro level suffers a serious injury, it matters not.  Because keeping fan and the tv executives and sponsors happy is Job One.|`|TuOp3hNPaa	no they should never end in a tie.  u should always have a winner. thats why u play..to c who can beat the other.  it doesnt always mean the one team is better  it jus means tht one team played better on tht day
IS6T13ttaa	as far as horses currently in training well most of the good ones just retired so we will have to wait till this year plays out before we really know the answer to that.  the one match race I was dying to see and was mentioned as a possibility was Big Brown vs Curlin.  that would have been one hell of a grudge match.  there was alot of trash talking going on.  IEAH proposed the idea before Big Brown got hurt but Curlins connections shot it down.  which is a good thing because honestly match races are just too dangerous.      of course Man O War vs Secretariat is the ultimate fantasy match race.|`|kgczgM3Raa	I agree with the others - there are horses I'd like to see race against each other, but not in a match race.  I don't think there are any really good rivalries of horses that are currently in training, but I would have liked to see Zarkava vs Zenyatta before Zarkava was retired - Europe's best filly vs the USA's.                            Since there is an eternal debate over whether Man O'War or Secretariat was the best ever, I'd of course want to see how those two would do against each other.  I would also like Secretariat vs Ruffian at their primes.|`|DLxh9CANaa	There aren't any horses I'd like to see in a match race right now, and I agree with Mike- match races are dangerous, dangerous events. The last time there was one which was planned and promoted, it led to the one of the WORST TRAGEDIES in all of racing history. I WATCHED that race on TV when I was eleven years old, and I can STILL HEAR the announcer screaming " Ruffian has broken down !!" in my head when I think about it very much. That poor filly sacrificed her LIFE in the name of human vanity and GREED, and so some people who knew better could have a few minutes of entertainment. In my mind, that's NOT SPORT, any more than watching the so-called "dream team" play basketball at the Olympic Games is sport. I get NO THRILLS FROM watching innocent creatures suffer horrendous injuries and DIE because someone wants to be entertained for a few minutes, and match races are BREEDING GROUNDS for this type of thing. That's one of the reasons why there hasn't been one in over 30 years, in fact.     I get even more sad when I think of the PRICE which all of Ruffian's connections PAID for her death. It was a high one, believe me. Her trainer, Whitley, was a man who never knew peace again after that horrible afternoon. People blamed him for the filly's death for decades afterwards, and it RUINED his professional reputation.He finally died last spring, after having been ill for many months with heart problems.Ironically enough, the day he died was ALSO the day that Eight Belles, another young filly, lost HER LIFE after breaking both front legs while pulling up following the Derby. Ruffian's owners have both passed on as well- one from heart disease, the other from cancer.( I remember reading about their deaths at different times in the Chronicle of the Horse, which publishes obituaries for famous horses and horse people.)  Their son now runs the family racing and breeding business. But perhaps the saddest ending is the one which happened to the filly's groom, Dan Williams. He loved that filly like she was his own daughter, and he NEVER GOT OVER her death. Within two years of the tragedy, he died too- of acute alcoholic poisoning !!  Given all this, it's hardly surprising that I can't say I'd favor another match race any time soon. If there'd been one between Curlin and Big Brown, odds are good we'd most likely have added BB's name to the list of horses which died tragically in breakdowns on the track, rather than be anticipating the birth of his first foals in a year or so. I say this because BB comes from the Native Dancer line, just as Ruffian did, and these horses are notorious for having foot and leg problems, along with only being able to race a limited number of times before they break down. Curlin has that bloodline in HIM, too, but in his case, he's older and more mature, and the risk of injuries is much less because of this. Curlin also has the advantage of having been trained by someone who DIDN'T believe in CHEATING and in using steroids to bulk up his horses and make them run faster, the way BB has been. I respect Asmuessin, he's a decent person. Dutrow, on the other hand, is NOT, and he will never be able to earn my respect, even on his best day. I have real problems with someone who not only uses drugs on his horses, but is an admitted addict HIMSELF, and one who has actually been arrested for possession, in fact. He even claimed to know nothing about what the steroids he was giving his horses did, a claim I believe- but that doesn't mean what he was doing was right.       This is just my take on this.|`|opttgiVNaa	I agree with the others- its not as interesting as 2 horses in a match race than 10 horses in like the breeders cup championship, I would love to see Big Brown and Curlin cuz Dutrow keeps running his mouth.   Thats the biggest one. But there isnt one compared to Man O' War vs. Secratariet or War Admrial vs Seabiscut
1ced09090a18210ce355123ea9003d99aa	He was okay.  Just okay.  The problem with that gimmick was it was based on a real legend who had damn near killed himself in the ring to become that legend.  Basically "Jimmy Jack Funk" was trying to capitalize on Terry's fame and notoriety.    Jesse Barr was a very capable wrestler in his own right and a good heel in Florida.  The "Barr" name was not unknown in wrestling at the time; he should have used it in the WWF.  Of course, Vince was all about everybody being "characters", and he stuck that one on Jesse.    Unfortunately, Jesse Barr is not Terry Funk.  And once Terry left the WWF, so did Jimmy Jack's push.  Not even Dory Jr could salvage the team, so he left the WWF and Jimmy Jack became a jobber.|`|a1c79820b82a16475aa4c959f6efd44eaa	well I guess he was not a funk but he was pretty cool.|`|K2nNTDqhaa	Who???????|`|UWJinEbIaa	I don't any memories of this mid-card nobody.....was he the same as Outback Jack who did the clothesline to the back of the head?

MARK HENRY the worlds strongest man thing yeah not a gimmick he has won a world strongest man contest and several wieght lifting contests its clearly him and as far as all fat LOOK AT HIS ARMS THE MAN IS F*CKIN JACKED YES HES GOT A GUT BUT THE MAN IS PROBLY 80% MUSCLE|`|4YDli7Lzaa	Triple H, John Morrison Ted DiBiase and Randy Orton are the loves of my life...lol    so i'd want to say one of them...    but mark henry was dubbed the worlds strongest man even if I personally dont like him...|`|ko2Iskl0aa	batista - raw  undertaker - smackdown  none - ecw|`|hIJRrIWiaa	Pound for pound i would have to say John Cena. But strongest would have to be mark henry or the big show.|`|GJsIZeUIaa	I'd say Batista. All those steroids gotta do something...
9kLiiDzVaa	i think his foot slipped a little|`|IMQm9JTMaa	yes it was intended to look hard so that they could use the storyline that vince mcmahon sustained a ''concussion'' from the punt, just like batista did from ortons ''punt''.    so yes all in all randy orton was supposed to kick vince THAT hard    & i hope you know it's all a storyline, vince isn't actually hurt|`|4ad21c8bd9ed4a91c2d622b918f0138daa	Well it looked like the punt hurt and randy might have kicked a little hard but vince is fine he can take a lot of beatings. He told the wwe superstars not to hold back.|`|8vAxlg2Daa	Vince has been known to let superstars physically hurt him to put over the show. So maybe Orton hit him full on.|`|zOw0Ta5Oaa	well he wasnt but probably he let of a bit.|`|d6bb91335d2d467b86fe9b280c4c812eaa	I think usually tells them to not hold back. So yeah he kicked him that hard on purpose. The harder Orton kicks the more money Vince makes.|`|9enFa2osaa	Actually he didnt meant to kick it because after he kicked him he was all suprised.|`|K2nNTDqhaa	Yeah he was , Orton was off his rocker on roids, started hearing voices in his head and thought Vinces head was in fact a football. He thought he was representing the St Louis Rams or something and got carried away cos he heard Vince mumble something about Randy - The Ram (gettit!)- Robinson from the movie the wrestler so he went bezerk and started kicking everything in his path.......|`|AA10341097	in doing certain attacks like that or sweet chin music and things like that, you never really know how much force to put in cause you don't wanna do it too hard to cause injury but not too soft to where it looks too fake.    Orton probably under judged his kick and he did definitely do it pretty F'ing hard. plus he might have only wanted to connect farther towards the top of the head but he got it straight in the middle, solid *** kick    unless vince was sure he could take a kick that hard AND ASKED for it to be hard, that was probably a little of an accident but Vince is fine and probably liking the way it came off. With all the replays, they are obviously liking how real it came off|`|BlgZmV6uaa	I believe the kick was souppose to be hard so it did not come off as fake.The best part of that skit was when Randy slapped Vince|`|532ca7e079e8f2fbedc1cf289e0db90baa	His laces cut Vinces head so the hit probly was much harder than was planned..|`|AA11528760	McMahon was legit punted in the head and had his face cut up a little bit by Orton's boot. The belief is that McMahon may have told Orton to bring it during the angle feeling it would be a big thing for TV as he has a history of taking real abuse from a number of guys over the years to get physical angles over.|`|v4hFUpC5aa	yes he was. vince can take a huge hit, read stone colds book he can take an *** whoopin he told randy to bring it on and randy brought it good job rko|`|7f2GSDmqaa	I dont think he was supposed to kick him as hard as he did, but Vince told him to lay it in before the show|`|smcDn76jaa	I think it was an accident. I listened to an interview with him and he said he tries to hold back, but then it won't look good.

iT8CNh6paa	did u know citi field was started cuz of the 2012 olympics? Giants Stadium for soccer, and the tennis could be in queens|`|rGGymoowaa	That's a tough one because an Olympic Stadium  (that was to be used for Jets, Soccer, other events) with a retractable roof that was to be built in the lower west side was defeated. This is why NYC was not able to be a host city for 2012 as their was too much opposition to building an Olympic Stadium.     Yankees and Mets would never go away for most of the entire month of August and Stadiums are not only too small (75,000 or more) their built for baseball not Athletics and Soccer     Even the new stadium that Giants and Jets will use  would be problematic as  it's owned by both teams as they privately financed the stadium. Also the configuration will be all wrong think how the LA memorial Coliseum is designed with the track around the field and how it can seat 93,000 spectators.      Only way NYC has a shot at the Olympics  build an Olympic Stadium in the lower west side. Since developing that area just doesn't have much support I don't see that happening in the force-able future.

H7AcXAyaaa	arly life    Yoakam was born in Pikeville, Kentucky, the son of Ruth Ann, a key-punch operator, and David Yoakam, a gas-station owner.[1] He was raised in Columbus, Ohio, growing up with his mother and stepfather, who had a white-collar job in the automotive industry. He graduated from Columbus' Northland High School on June 9, 1974. During his high school years, he excelled in both music and drama, regularly securing the lead role in school plays, such as "Charlie" in a stage version of Flowers for Algernon, honing his skills under the guidance of teacher-mentors Jerry McAfee (music) and Charles Lewis (drama). Outside of school, Yoakam sang and played guitar with local garage bands, and frequently entertained his friends and classmates as an amateur comedian, impersonating politicians and other celebrities, such as Richard Nixon, who, at that time, was heavily embroiled in the Watergate controversy.    Yoakam briefly attended Ohio State University, but dropped out and moved to Nashville in the late 1970s with the intent of becoming a recording artist.    [edit] Career    When he began his career, Nashville was oriented toward pop "Urban Cowboy" music, and Yoakam's brand of Bakersfield Honky tonk music was not considered marketable.    Not making much headway in Nashville, Yoakam moved to Los Angeles. Yoakam's vision of bringing traditional, Honky Tonk or "Hillbilly" music (as he himself called it) forward into the 1980s wasn't fully realized until he teamed up with lead guitarist and Producer Pete Anderson. While Yoakam wrote most of his songs himself, Anderson had a hand in arranging the songs and shaping their direction, as well as determining their ultimate sound as producer. Pete grew up in Detroit, Michigan, where his family had moved North to find work in the Michigan auto factories, a similar move to Yoakam's family's migration North from Kentucky. In Detroit, Pete picked up Blues guitar, being influenced by local Blues guitarists like John Lee Hooker. You can hear Pete playing some Hooker-inspired licks on Yoakam's cover of "Honky Tonk Man", on his debut album. When Pete moved to Los Angeles, he had to pick up other styles of guitar playing in order to work, and he forged his Country style playing in local Country bands. Some of these bands lacked a Steel guitarist, and so he worked out one of his most distinctive techniques: imitating a pedal steel guitar on standard electric guitar. Pete has tremendous skill and technique, rarely over-plays, and has added quite a bit to the unique, hard-hitting Country/Honky-Tonk sound Yoakam featured on most of his albums. Pete has always produced records for other artists, and recently left Yoakam's band to focus full-time on producing.    Continuing to perform mostly outside traditional country music channels, Yoakam did many shows in Rock and Punk clubs around Los Angeles, playing with roots rock or punk rock acts like The Blasters (Yoakam scored a small hit with his version of their song "Long White Cadillac"), Los Lobos, and X. This helped him diversify his audience well beyond the typical Country music fans; at many of his shows you would see mohawked and leather-clad Punks alongside Rock & Rollers, as well as the typical cowboy-shirt wearing Country crowd.    Yoakam's recording debut was on the independent album A Town South of Bakersfield, which was a collection of "New Country" artists who were based in Los Angeles, California, and was planned and produced by Pete Anderson in 1984. He released an E.P. on independent label Oak Records; this was later re-released, with several additional tracks, as his major-label debut LP, 1986's Guitars, Cadillacs, Etc., Etc.. It instantly launched his career. "Honky Tonk Man," a remake of the Johnny Horton song, and "Guitars, Cadillacs" were hit singles. The follow-up LP, Hillbilly Deluxe, was just as successful. His third LP, Buenas Noches From a Lonely Room, included his first  1, a duet with his musical idol, Buck Owens, on "Streets of Bakersfield". 1990's If There Was a Way was another best-seller.    Yoakam's song "Readin', Rightin', Route 23" pays tribute to his childhood move from Kentucky, and is titled after a local expression describing the route that rural Kentuckians took to take to find a job outside of the coal mines. (U.S. Route 23 runs north from Kentucky through Columbus and Toledo, Ohio and through the automotive centers of Michigan.) Rather than the standard line that their Elementary schools taught "the three Rs" of "Readin', 'Ritin', and 'Rithmetic", Kentuckians used to say that the three Rs they learned were "Readin', 'Ritin, and Route 23 North"!    Yoakam has also taken some acting roles, most notably as the abusive alcoholic Doyle Hargraves in Sling Blade, (1996) and as a sociopathic killer in Panic Room (2002). He has also appeared in Southern California live theater, combining his acting talents with the talents of director Peter Fonda. More recently, he appeared in a cameo role as the doctor|`|GHnkKwl3aa	Hun, Dwight Yoakum is a country singer, not a basketball player.

eflQHBK2aa	well the situation defintly matters. EVERYTHING plays a factor. i.e. score, the pitcher, the batter, the inning, homefield or not, importance of game, ect. but speaking from a general standpoint its definitly the offense. any miscue on the defense is a run. also, it puts a lot of pressure on the pitcher to not walk the batter or throw a wild pitch. a hit, error, past ball, or walk will all score atleast one run or more. Advantage offense|`|FfWeTACKaa	First off you never mentioned the score, so for all we know the score is 57-3. Obviously the runners on base increase the chance of a run being scored, but it has nothing to do with the outcome between the pitcher and the hitter.    The chances of making an out are much more likely than getting a run in almost always, depending on the hitter. Let's say the average OBP is .330. That means the odds of not getting on base are .670, over two times more likely than getting on base.|`|1yuUIN9Aaa	Offense, the pitcher can get a little shaky and if he does he can either throw a wild pitch or throw one down the middle.|`|AA10025824	The defense.  A hit batter, a baulk, a walk, a hit, an error, anything can happen and with the bases loaded there's a lot more stress on the pitcher.|`|g9P7oWyeaa	It depends, if its a good pitcher to a very choker batter. But I say the offense because they could score even with a single base hit.|`|PJF4J3iYaa	its a great opportunity for the offense but the advantage would still be in the defenses favor.    a great average for a hitter is .300, which is less than half so 70% of the time that a ptcher gets a hitter out.  it wold be an advantage if the offense had only 1 or 0 outs. 1 out can get a sac fly. 0 outs anything can happen, even a double play.    the hitter/pitcher matchup would also have an impact on the outcome|`|JD3yWKNGaa	It really depends, but I would say the hitter because you could definitely have the ability to change the whole game. But the pitcher knows that they are only one out away, and if they can get that last out, then they will come away from that inning with a whole bunch of confidence.|`|JSryPP8faa	The offense for sure, really a no brainer. The manager has to bring in the right pitcher, bring the outfield in for a possible play at the plate, bring the corner infielder's in for the same reason then pray for a strikeout or an out in some other fashion. For the offensive player the option's are unlimited. No brainer.|`|mml9J88caa	Offense  Because they have a change to score, from a base hit to a grand slam!

7y687RUxaa	1 most co2 canisters are the same but compressed air tanks can be expensive (most 20oc co2 canisters run about 20 dollars)  what im saying is, there isnt really a difference    2 personally i always use monster balls they are about 30 dollars for 2000. some people may have problems  if they are using high powered guns but your gun should be handle them just fine    3 the hopper that comes with it because it will be using tippmanns specific hopper for it to maximize rof     sum up:  most co2 is the same   monster balls   the standard one|`|boB43p0xaa	1. just a pure energy tank is good (20 once) (can be purchased at walmart or any sporting good stores)  2. any paint is good just not walmarts paint or any thing like 10$ for 500 but if you are looking for them at local store impact works good.  3.just get a gravity hopper or if you are getting an e-grip look for a cyclone feed with is like on a tippman a-5|`|FF66xJISaa	i got the alpha black also its an awesome gun, but a little heavy, i might get a remote hose so the Co2 doesn't leek into the gun.  i have a 20 oz pure energy tank, and a gravity hopper.  I am thinking about modifying a 98 custom's cyclone hopper and using that.|`|Io1NcoJoaa	All Co2 is the same. I think compressed air is all around better for your gun, and is more consistent then Co2. A gravity hopper will not feed enough bps to work with e-grip. I suggest a Halo B (you can get them for like $60.00) or a V-locity Jr.($40.00).     And Monster Balls are terrible. They dont break good, and they often stain white and gray clothes.Impact is good if your buying something local. I suggest any DXS paint or ProCaps.
HFEotT1Qaa	The actual ball is unaffected by weather conditions...I think you got screwed.    The color fading is fine, but less grip is definitely suspicious

But I think we will easily be above .500 on this trip.....|`|45e71bc8ca903cd0b9c0e4294eff6f04aa	they only games i see them having a chance to lose in are @ utah and @ g state the rest are w's.    the loss yesturday is a bit of a wake up call and maybe it was what they needed before this road trip.    and god dammit Charlotte always plays good ball against us
6E16tR6xaa	JBL, Batista, CM Punk, Rey, Kane to Smackdown.  Triple H, Jeff Hardy, Edge, Big Show to Raw.  Do away with ECW.  Swagger to Raw.   Mark Henry to Smackdown.|`|eJDRyYNaaa	Vladimir Kozlov to RAW.|`|U6tE9LhJaa	Cena to ECW|`|IMQm9JTMaa	rey mysterio to ecw, to boost the ratings    shawn michaels to smackdown to work with HHH    beth phoenix to smackdown, bump up the divas division.|`|2rJwgk40aa	I'd take everyone on ecw and trade them to smackdown.Then Id do away with ecw.  Bring undertaker to Raw.  Bring Nattie to raw so she can compete for a real title,and have some decent matches.|`|ABRPsjwBaa	I'd make JBL go to Smackdown! and so should Chris Jericho.    I'd also make Big Show and R-Truth go to Raw|`|OTdveVCHaa	everyone to smackdown  chuck norris to raw.  Mr.t to ECW|`|GJsIZeUIaa	Shelton Benjamin to RAW. RAW seems to be focusing on young superstars now, and I think he could have a good feud with CM Punk for the IC title.
nAtBuBRhaa	I'm not a fan of them either, lol. But, I would have to say Giants in '07. Look, that team was undefeated. (even if they cheated...) Anyways, if a team lost no games during the regular season, and the only game they lost was the Super Bowl to a Wild Card team, that's like unbelievable. Also, it seams heaven sent because it was Strahan's last game. But, in 2001, New England were hot. And they were unbeatable at the time. When a team has so much confidence they usually beat the opponent. Good question, but the Giants win over the Cheatriots was the bigger upset.|`|e53807be9e34b50fae02ba7c73274c6baa	Jets over the Colts in Super Bowl III was the biggest upset, ever in the Super Bowl.    Giants winning over the Cheatriots was the best of the two you mentioned.|`|rNUyV1EYaa	Giants over Patriots was the bigger upset. Everybody expected a "perfect" season from New England; and the Giants made the playoffs as a wild card in 2007.|`|TuOp3hNPaa	giants over patriots.  they were undefeated. thts a BIG upset if one team is undefeated|`|qxgpXA6kaa	GIANTS vs cheatriots by far|`|KJiGI60Laa	Giants over the Pats, becasue the pressure of playing a team that's 18-0 you don't want to lose to them. You want to do what others couldn't do.|`|0Fi9EANKaa	without question the Giants over the Patriots...I mean the Patriots were undefeated all the way until the Superbowl, so the Giants couldn't have possibly been less of an underdog than the Patriots in 01'
GRRpbWLoaa	Excellent choice.  Both are very similar and have the same performance.  The only real difference between the two is that the G36C model has a shorter front assembly and barrel than the  G36K model.  The longer barrel will give you better accuracy at longer ranges, but the shorter barrel of the C model will give you better manuverability in tight spaces like a CQB course.  It depends on where you will be playing.  If an open wooded area, then use the K model; if in a smaller CQB setting, then use the C model.  Two good links for them are:     http://www.airsplat.com/Items/ERM-JG-G36...  http://www.airsplat.com/Items/ERM-JG-G36...|`|U0Rvsabdaa	The K model has a built in red dot scope (and carrying handle) while the C model has a rail mount.     I'd say to pick the K, I feel it looks better and is more useful.|`|gpwI2sbvaa	They are the same, except for their size. The G36C is meant for short range encounters, due to its small barrel and body length. The G36K has a longer body and barrel which gives it more accuracy. I recommend the K model because the accuracy lets you effectively in larger open areas. The battery is stored in the front handguard, which has a larger compartment on the K model. Also, they both have a folding stock, which is helpful for tight areas, and storage.|`|4owr19vCaa	The G36C is more compact (hence the "c" for compact)    The G36k is longer (the "k" is for Kurz (german for short))    If you have a smaller frame (say 5'7" or shorter), or just want something more maneuverable  get the g36c.    if you are taller, the g36k may be more comfortable to handle.      cheers    edit - unfortunately, Echo1 does not follow the real steel G36K it is simply a longer version of the G36C, extended handguard and barrel.  It is what it is.    E1 G36C  http://www.airsoftgi.com/product_info.ph...    E1 G36K  http://www.airsoftgi.com/product_info.ph...

OHs8yJiOaa	It's going to be relative to you as an individual. You have your own unique arch type, pronation, foot size, mileage, running surfaces, etc.    You need to go to a running specialty shop where they'll determine all of the above and recommend the things most likely to be appropriate for you personally. You need to then try them all on physically in-person. Your size is likely to even vary from one model to the next.    There is not one best model or even brand. If you run over enough time, you're likely to even switch brands, models, etc. frequently as different designs come out each year, and as your needs change over time.    Go get properly fitted for shoes (and insoles) in a running specialty shop.|`|U5l7LZ3kaa	You have to find out what fits your foot type best.  If there is a running specialty store in your city, go to it.  They can look at your foot and make a suggestion to what will work for you best.      Take care - Coach Tief|`|eDCyle05aa	Yes, Brooks makes the best running shoes, thats just my opinion, but they specialize in running gear and i think they are more confortable than asics and nike. Here is a site that has discount running shoes: http://www.holabirdsports.com/m/Running/...

FYd1ndVxaa	Never thus far|`|KdhNCnEjaa	If it is an important point a fist pump and a yell psych the other guy out|`|eY1Vttiyaa	No, I don't tend to celebrate after I win a point.|`|ymrkxCGdaa	I get told not too so much, but after I win a long or intense point, or a game/set/match, I tend to get way overpumped and start fist-pumping, etc.|`|ixKOGishaa	Yeah I do  fist pump sometimes but only during crucial moments when I win a big point cause it really boosts my confidence.I know why Lleyton Hewitt does it so much it feels greats.Even Federer fist pumps at a certain point in a game.So really fist pumpimg is SUPER fun|`|iyDXt5d9aa	haha how do ya not fistpump when ya win a point.|`|3eeda29c64cb4c0d10c7d7c0813cce7faa	I do on an important set (the last one) or a match point but I try not to over-do it because I try not to be a douchebag.|`|j1BTIYcCaa	I do not like Hewitt's actions on court, he would have a larger fan club if he was more like Federer.  There is no point celebrating over a few good winning points, it's winning the game that counts.  Then you accept success graciously.|`|2ab86b1d07a4387eb50e37a6fe895233aa	yes i fist pump after evry single point i win  i fist pump and shout out "come on" after i hit an ace, or winner  and on the big big points  but i dnt say *** on after evry single point just big ones but i do fist pump on evrypoint i win  and i say *** on and fist pump when my matches are very close  and yes i grunt on every point and i grunt louder on big points  my franns call me a male version of maria sharapova and victoria azarenka lol  im 14 btw|`|3d3d2a18b838d322464051559bd8c0e3aa	Oh, you lose! I even fist pump during a point and I fist pump before hitting the ball.    Seriously though, I don't usually celebrate after a point, I only get mad if I lose a point from my error.
23c29ffe0b37caf3f16d0ec3d3b9c0ddaa	kofi is not ready sorry...maybe a year or two but not wrestle mania main event...as far as mysterio i just dont see why he is popular he is so boring to watch ill rather watch...|`|8jViRw5qaa	I have your WWE spoilers.  In the Smackdown Elimination Chamber the participants will be the following:  Edge(c)  Undertaker (beat Mark Henry to qualify)  Big Show (beat Festus to qualify)  Triple H (won a triple threat match including Kozlov and Great Khali)  Vladimir Kozlov ( won a 14-man battle royal, last elimianting R-Truth)  Jeff Hardy (Qualified after Vickie Guerrero announced it)    In the Raw Elimination Chamber:  We already know John Cena(c), Rey Mysterio, Chris Jericho, and Kofi Kingston are in. Since Raw is live nobody knows for sure. But my prediction is Randy Orton will be punished by being forced to fight in the Elimination Chamber. Also HBK will have a qualifying match and win, but JBL says HBK is "injured" and JBL will take his place.    Smackdown is final, last 2 on Raw are predictions, tell me what you think.|`|QrB5OImjaa	jeff and matt hardy|`|K2nNTDqhaa	Smackdown have named Edge,HHH,Kozlov,Big Show and Taker but have a spot open strangly either for Jeff or Christian perhaps.    RAW have named Cena, Kofi,Y2J and Rey but still have two spots open, the smart moneys on both JBL and HBK being the two that fill those gaps, even though HBK was supposed to have cost JBL his spot this past week.|`|caczNImxaa	for smackdown i think it will be both matt and jeff hardy and it will be edge vs matt vs jeff at the end. i dont know about raw though|`|ULSUqmeZaa	It's already been determined that Jeff Hardy is taking the last spot for the smackdown group.    Raw will probably have either JBL/HBK or both and maybe Orton as part of the McMahon plan to make his life a living hell. Maybe even Christian could come back on Raw|`|v4hFUpC5aa	John Cena wins the raw elimanation chamber Edge as the smackdown. Jeff wont get the tittle back untill hes done feuding with matt (he might get it back) and kofi needs charecter devolopment give him some promo time and let him get mad. put him in acouple long feuds (even if the feuds only go a month or so itl help him) Cena needs to win. he is good. people need to suck it up and not down the man. cena is a good guy and a good wrestler people are just pisssed that vince is consistint with him. Cena and edge will carry wwe to wrestlemania Edge is the best in the buissness right now and cena is right up there he has cHarisma|`|ua4l7Iqyaa	HBK and JBL and Jeff or Matt hardy on SD and Kofi is absolutely ready for a main event push he is a fan favorite and talented as hell
8Im1iGFTaa	if either of them were to join legacy it would be stephanie|`|GJsIZeUIaa	They have been known to turn on Vince in the past, so I guess it is possible.

J1fxwkqraa	Currently my favourite Celtics player is Ray Allen. Smoothest shooter in the league and still getting it done despite everyone saying he's getting old or that he's not as good as he used to be.     All-time, its hard to go past Larry Bird who was at his peak as I first started playing the game. Great shooter, great passer, great basketball mind.     After many lean years in the late 90's and early 00's ... its great to see the Boston franchise back on top.

Most people believed that it was Christian pulling all that stuff on Jeff Hardy. I thought so. Also it didn't help that on TNA Christian got the crap kicked out of him because reportedly he was switching over to WWE. Well see what happens at Wrestlemania though.|`|ABRPsjwBaa	"WE want Christian!"(Claps)    That entire match I was like that lol,unfortunately he didn't show up!|`|IMQm9JTMaa	Yeah, Alot i mean ALOT of people were expecting Christian to return. But those few knew that he wasn't going to return.|`|4ad21c8bd9ed4a91c2d622b918f0138daa	Yes they were screaming we want christian mostly between the jeff vs edge match. They even had the welcome back christian signs. I was a bit disappointed with him not returning that night but it was way too obvious. Besides the bigger the pop he gets from the fans the bigger the push will be.|`|XdjpnzO7aa	i cant beleive it but yeah for some 10 secs i heard they were shouting christian lol thats why vince scraped up this storyline too|`|ua4l7Iqyaa	yes i even saw a peeps sign and an E & C sign|`|Agsp62ttaa	Yes! It absolutely cracked me up. I joined in with my TV at one point lol.

K2nNTDqhaa	Yeah theres a great chance of them happening ..... if someone matchs them up on Raw v SD 09 LOL!|`|fmUGHvgHaa	i dont think any of that matches will happen because     raw can put a match like legacy vs whole raw    and    probably there gonna be rko vs shane O mac    but how hhh|`|4V6V9uN8aa	The first one would not be a contest.    The second is the one that is intriguing.  Seeing Shane at Raw was a shock, but not as much as seeing him take out Randy with Cody & Dibiase standing right there.  I expected Shane to either take a beating & the rest of the roster to come to his aid or for Shane to have Cody & DiBiase suddenly turn on Randy.  Still, that was a moment to remember.  Be nice if Shane came back full time for awhile..|`|9enFa2osaa	I think both of the matches will happen at no way out.|`|GJsIZeUIaa	Nah, those would be bad matches.

l4WEwTWwaa	Shadow Boxing is used for exactly this purpose. You stand in front of a mirror (the bigger the better) and practice throwing punches and dancing around and everything. It is supposed to show you how you would look against your opponent. Watch tapes of fighters with good footwork. Maybe Ali is setting the bar a little high for yourself though, and then practice while shadow boxing. Do three three minute rounds and you should be fine.|`|iJ8MQ5HZaa	rossboxing.com|`|CaYqzlcGaa	some of it is just natural, like your naturally good at footwork, do endurance squats like pick a weight that is easy for your to squat and do a lot of em|`|KmzjSnzVaa	Don't run on your toes. Running is to build stamina. But keeping on your toes in the ring is something else. Shadow boxing is the best way. You also need to gauge how far apart your feet are. Too far and you can't stay on yours toe. Shoulder width is best, but you will lose power. Play with the differences in widths to see what feels good for you. Enjoy the experience.|`|czybCCyZaa	2 things:    1) Running on your toes is ALWAYS good. You should be running on your toes ALL THE TIME. It builds calf muscles and allows your leg muscles to take the impact. Touching your heels on the ground when you run is a big no-no since it makes your bones take the impact which damages your ankles, knees, and lower back over time.    2) Building footwork drills is easy. Just search google for all those football footwork drills for building lower body agility and coordination. You setup cones on the floor and run around them everyday and in all sorts of different patterns. Practice and your footwork will improve. The best ways to build footwork is to start SLOW!!!

I am 27 years old and been a pro wrestling fan since I was ten years old and you are telling us that pro wrestling is scripted and fake? No way, I do not believe you. I have been a pro wrestling fan for seventeen years now and this is the FIRST time I have ever heard that it is fake. Can you provide links or scholarly websites which can emirically show pro wrestling is faked? Are you telling me, sir, that the matches of Ricky Steamboat wrestling Randy Savage at Wrestlemania III was scripted? Or what about when Rick Martel lasted over an hour at the Royal Rumble in 1991? Was that fake too? My childhood memories have been forever destroyed! Noooooooooo!!!|`|6E16tR6xaa	I knew it was scripted before I started watching. I didnt care if it was scripted.

Dont pretend like the winners are all over the internet 3 months before the match happens.|`|1UKAho1iaa	I've pretty much always known that it was fake because my brother was a wrestler in a local promotion.

But that didnt stop me from watching wrestling.|`|RcORfsOIaa	Lets see...I've been watching wrestling since I was 3.  When I was 10 I found out wrestling was scripted when Triple H was doing some type of interview about his relationship with Chyna and he started talking about scripts that they shared together. I was like scripts????? I was looked at my mom and I was like "Scripts???" and she was like "honey this is scripted..all of it is planned" I was crushed.

I saw Nikolai Volkoff miss a punch completely on a jobber and the guy fell flat.  I thought it was the funniest and most entertaining thing i'd even seen up to that point.

You have never been on a W.W.E ring so you better shut up and let people believe!  Mavy there feuds are not real but the action in the ring it is! so  let people believe in something!|`|Q1MI6L96aa	....Wait....it's not real? <br>  <br>  I was the type of kid at 5-6 who would try anything....I remember one day when I was armed with a baseball bat with the intent of knocking out windows of a barn on the farmland just like the firemen do when battling fires, so my parents told me straight away when I started getting interested in pro wrestling. They rightfully were concerned I would be diving off the roof of the home.
LaBxzWa7aa	Machida by superior striking and take down defense.  I would go by this:  Chances of Machida winning-Over %90  By TKO/KO-Over %20(Thiago rushes things)  By Submission %0(Thiago's way too good on the ground)  By decision %80  Losing  By TKO/KO-%8  By Submission-%0(Machida getting submitted? WTF)  By decision- %2(1 good hit can send Machida dazed for the whole 3 rounds)      BJ Penn vs GSP  %65 GSP  Winning by:  Decision-%55(GSP by boring lay-n-pray)  KO/TKO-%10(Penn is superior in striking, if GSP wins by strikes it'll be through GnP)  Submission-%0  Losing by:  Decision-%10(Penn striking GSP to a split decision)  KO/TKO-%20(Penn by superior striking, over coming GSP's reach and avoiding the clinch)  Submission-%5(Penn pulling out a trick out of his sleeve because he was prepared for GSP's lay-n-pray)|`|CdAE4nXcaa	machida is definitly going to win and i am a fan of silva and machida. machida has the perfect style for winning he doesn't take any damage but he gives out a lot even though he has won most by decision it's still a win idk what silva's game plan is going to be to try to stop machida.|`|ZpShIvylaa	I think Silva is a very aggressive fighter and expect a surprising KO from Machida with a kick to the head.      and St. Pierre is going to beat Penn.|`|NSgSaspAaa	Silva's aggression is normally what guys like Machida lika. If Silva just comes forward, Machida will likely counter him over and over for 3 rounds and take a unanimous decision.    He's already proven that he can manhandle big guys...just watch his accurate striking and smart movement against Tito Ortiz.    Silva can definitely win, but I'll take Machida by decision.|`|UWJinEbIaa	Lyoto Machida will be the next 205 champion before the end of 2009!|`|AA11264943	I would really like to see Machida win.  I predict that he will win, but I am concerned with Silva's power and being able to hurt Machida if he lands one.    I agree that GSP is going to beat Penn.  The first fight was close, but GSP is like 20 times better than he was when they last fought.  I know BJ is better too, but I just think GSP is on another level all together.    If Machida wins, I think he gets a shot against Rashad Evans.    James|`|REdcuFwOaa	You're right on one account, Machida is a more technical, better at every facet of mma then Silva, who does have vicious gnp, but won't be able to trap the elusive Machida.  Machida wins via unanimous decision.    Bj Penn will defeat Pierre, I think the decision in their last fight could've went in Penn's favor, he was totally destroying GSP in the stand up genre, he just was timid on the ground for some reason, I think the fight (welterweight title fight) will live up to every bit of the hype.  Bj Penn will win via split decision.|`|nfZzdWGLaa	Thiago Silva|`|I2fIfGUqaa	Machida, he trains with my favorite fighter, Anderson Silva. I believe he will win because he knows how to keep his distance, knows when to srike, and knows when to avoid danger.    Thiago Silva on the other hand has had more experience and can take some hits, he is an excellent fighter and proves a challenge to everyone.    My bet is Machida will win= 60%  Thiago Silva= 40%    If Thiago can take this fight to the ground, he's in. But Machida, he backs off to quickly and can get some knees in if Thiago tries to take him down. Alls lyoto needs to do is keep his stance, stay up, and win.|`|cj8iM1Olaa	Machida is such a tactical fighter. He isn't explosive or flashy. Some would even call it boring. He just waits for his spot and capitalizes on it.     Silva is more of the aggressor, so i think he'll play into Lyoto's hands.|`|pG6kRPqvaa	I think this is a really bad match up for Thiago. I believe that his agressive way of fighting will make him an ideal target for Machida's counter-punching offence. Its kind of a bummer cuz I'm a fan of his.
OHs8yJiOaa	Most do report difficulty sleeping the night immediately before events like a marathon. The most common solution is to ensure thorough sleep two nights before.     If you're thoroughly rested prior, one night with little or no sleep doesn't take as big a toll as if you're going in with a sleep debt already present.    In addition, in can often take a few miles for the body to truly transition into sustainable running gear -- many runners will say 2-3 miles or perhaps around 30 minutes. Once a little ways into the things, the body can actually "wake up" and better settle into a sustainable running gear.|`|S1523jdAaa	go to sleep early...and make sure you stretch and get a good breakfast|`|xmFiyRRNaa	You should definitely take the advice of the Iron Man participant, but...    I couldn't tell you why exactly, but some of the best running I've ever done in my life has happened when I'm sleep deprived.   First half-marathon I ever did was the Las Vegas Marathon 2006. Like you mentioned, marathons typically start around 6 or 7am, I believe this one started at 6am, Sunday morning. Well...you know Vegas, me and friends who were running with me were out until about 2:30am just a few hours earlier. We all went to sleep right before 3:00am. Got up 30 minutes before the start time, got a taxi to the Mandalay Bay. And started the race.   I could still taste the alcohol in my breath when we started but believe it or not, that race was the best I've ever felt running! The first 7 miles were a breeze. Didn't hit the "wall" until the 10th mile. Finished the race at 1hour 44minutes (which was my personal best at the time).     I certainly wouldn't recommend this to any aspiring runner (and I haven't done it since). Most people are aware that Marathons kick off very early and dully load up on carbs and go to bed early the night before. But if you're ever in a bind where you didn't get very much sleep, give it a shot anyways. You never know, it may be the run of your life.     Good luck!|`|U5l7LZ3kaa	What really matters is the sleep you got two days before.  The night of really doesn't have as much impact.  If you are doing a long slow run, make sure your pace isn't too fast to begin with.    Take care - Coach Tief
AA11518803	It makes me sick. Benitez has only started Torres and Keane together a handful of times this season. Admittedly Keane has been a disappointment, but he plays better off of another forward, which he hasn't been allowed to do. If you're not going to play him, transfer him. That and Lucas has been useless. He cost them another match today, but it should have never come down to protecting a 1-0 lead in the first place.|`|gpNIG15eaa	See,I told those Liverpool fans that Liverpool would choke under pressure.Rafa was thinking too much about Alex Ferguson,and my words came true.|`|BEfPrh2laa	i think they suffer from never winning the premership syndrome|`|u6PhC7vhaa	Well, we've been terrible some times this season. But we've also played brilliant. Admit it United hasn't played all that well (until yesterday)|`|0HO8sTGeaa	there no good as they use to be lol|`|Rds4eGIyaa	Because Rafa is too damn defensive! He sets out not to lose a game rather than win it and when we are 1-0 up he goes on the defensive rather than going for the kill. Teams that are lower in the league ie Wigan, Stoke etc still have enough quality to score goals if they go on the offensive and are given too much possession. Rafa is too stubborn to realise this and, while we are always a chance to win the Champions League, it doesn't look as though Rafa has come to grips with the Premier League and I doubt we will ever win it under his guidance.

A5aYD4S3aa	yes every fighting style is a form of martial art although.its more of a martial sport then art.|`|9b5QUw2eaa	In the Olympics, yes.    On Channel 8, no way.|`|3BGJETHYaa	I'm going to have to say no, actually.  While it is an excellent sport, wrestling really is missing some vital aspects that appear in almost any other martial art- how to finish somebody.  Wrestlers know how to take someone down and pin them there, yes, and they do that very well.  But doing much beyond that is not part of wrestling- there is no finish.|`|UWJinEbIaa	It is a sport that is in every major international competition like the Olympics....so yes it a recognized sport.|`|36u3Ml0kaa	yes it is both a sport and martial art such as judo is.  Wrestling is the oldest form of martial arts and sports in the world.|`|TH1fT6rdaa	Yes.  Wrestling is a combat technique and sport that focuses on a certain aspect of fighting - grappling.  You have to learn moves, condition, wrestle wisely, and react quickly to a situation.  Just like there are several forms of karate, there are several forms of wrestling.  Folkstyle, freestyle, collegiate, and Greco-Roman, all focus on wrestling, just differently.  It can be applied either as sport or actual fighting technique.  All good mixed martial artists must know some form of wrestling.    Just because there is no belt system doesn't mean its not a martial art.  Also, you could argue that wrestling isn't a martial art because the goal isn't to "finish" your opponent.  However, wrestling is known for putting the opponent in pain and making them concede to your supremacy, then pinning them.  And, taekwondo (an undisputed martial art) is a point scoring sport.  No taekwondo artist's goal is to knock their opponent out.    Wrestling is a martial art as much as judo or jiujitsu is.  Just because there is no black belt doesn't mean its not a martial art.|`|lQxy6WVRaa	Of course it is.|`|sj902Wyuaa	No, it is just a bunch of guys trying to prove how tough and strong they are.|`|nKNiKPn3aa	Yes, at least i would consider it one because they have to condition, learn moves and there is more behind it. It is one people just don't recognize  because it is more popular and well the stereotypical kicks and all that stuff isn't allowed.|`|LaBxzWa7aa	Yes, every combat style is a martial art.    As long as it's a tradition and a type of training for combat than it's a martial art.    The only way a combat sport can't be a martial art is if it doesn't train you for combat, wrestling is a martial art because it prepares you for combat even if it's not the intention.|`|MCB1ovEtaa	It's the "America Martial Art" lol..    But seriously idk if it is or not technically but it's a very good base.  Wrestlers are very strong, well conditioned, and have awesome takedowns.    (former wrestler)|`|4gwSrPhfaa	yes wrestling is very much a martial arts, there are several different styles of wrestling folk, freestyle, grecco, catch, and for anyone who things that wrestling dose not have moves or holds that can finish people off well then that person has never been on the receiving end of a 5point spulex onto their neck , and catch wrestling is nothing but puting people into moves with which u can submit them|`|dc6f042f0a1f241b0647713f95aefc3aaa	LOL...after reading this I had a good laugh...wrestling...a martial art...LOL    It is a sport. Now, if you want to state greco roman or a specific, non-high school or collegiate version of wrestling, then yes a couple may, and I stress may, qualify as martial arts...but I doubt it.     Wrestling is to limited and aimed at winning events...not real fights.|`|N5SVU6Xwaa	not really|`|FxEp6ehKaa	Yes, look up forms of grappling. Although it does not emphasize much on kata, there are many martial arts that don't for example Muay Thai or boxing.
8S2KhGwSaa	Well you need to be very good.  I mean if you want to be a sponsored skateboarder these days, you have to have your switch stance dialed [meaning you have to be able to do tricks in the opposite direction you skate] Its like having a right handed baseball batter hit a home-run with his left hand.  Plus you need to make a good "sponsor-me" video. Meaning you gotta take the time to film it and edit it. Once you make your video I would send it into a skateboard shop first so you can enter skateboard competitions where the skate companies go to get new ams. Hope I helped.|`|JuTyQgQiaa	go to ur local  skateshop and ask|`|7r7x9aUBaa	you send a video in to your favorite company and you get sponsored...you have to also be really good|`|73ce9320e575a7c5972ae82e45ed8be4aa	Enter local contests in your area.  Many times there are sponsors there looking for people, or even just a skate team looking for members.  With a team, it's easier to be noticed than if you are freelance.|`|lmJlABpZaa	Everyone has given good advice, but mine is simply skateboard.  Don't worry about getting sponsored, but simply focus on pushing yourself and progressing.  Go on skate trips, enter contests (if you like to compete), film your tricks, and have fun with your friends.  If you get sponsored then you get a bonus, but I hope you are skating for fun... not to get free crap!  ha.
gqx2H6mDaa	I''ve been skating for 7 years, through these years i've tried many different trucks (venture, Thunder, Indy etc..)    I have to say the best is Krux  Krux are low, strong and very fast. If your going to get new trucks at least give Krux a try. Once you try them you won't ride anything else.|`|boB43p0xaa	krux or thunders both work well
BXq8MZ8Zaa	well, training a lot will definitely improve your time by a lot. also, if you havent hit your growth spurt yet, that can help you drop time too. heres a couple tips for during your race:<br>  <br>  1) nail your start and turns. be explosive off the block and wall and make sure you have a tight streamline to keep your speed as long as possible.<br>  <br>  2) dont breath more than 3 times the entire 50. take 1 breath on the first 25 and 2 on the way back.<br>  <br>  3) kick as hard as you possibly can.<br>  <br>  4) when you pull, your arms should be almost straight, like you are trying to touch the bottom of the pool. that way, you can pull water with your biceps as well as your hands and forearms.<br>  <br>  5) keep your head still to help maintain a good body line. if your head is moving, then your body will wiggle through the water, slowing you down a lot.<br>  <br>  good luck!|`|DjQQosqjaa	I swam a 24.22 at my sectionals meet and didn't make it on to districts.<br>  It sucked, I also swam a 52.91 100 Free and didn't make it to districts...<br>  <br>  You just really gotta work on turns, lengthening your stroke, not breathing in and out of turns and trying to take as little breaths as possible. I got down to 3 breaths for my 50 and 8 for my 100 and I dropped time immediately.<br>  Drop your head on flip turns too...|`|WzsxvP16aa	Hopefully, you'll continue to eat and sleep right over the next few years, and your body will grow.  That will be a major factor in dropping time.  Additionally, if you practice over the summer in addition to your winter school practices, you can get in better shape.  Mastering your technique is important, but starts and turns ultimately can make or break a 50.  <br>  <br>  My best advice would be to focus on practicing, and get good starts and turns.|`|wOYmeIUIaa	Keep practicing what you are doing and make sure your turns are PERFECT because that is one of the biggest factors.<br>  <br>  Hope this helped
l4WEwTWwaa	Antonio Tarver and Earnie Shavers didn't pick up the sport until 22 and Tarver didn't turn pro until 28 and look at what they accomplished. I'm 17 and I picked up boxing just fine. It is all a matter of how fast you pick it up and if you are willing to work. You are still young enough to train and go pro easy.|`|1r05fktRaa	go for it|`|a112fa2d0ccf1099eec1119d4da5e902aa	Just right.  Most competitive boxers started in their mid-teens so you're right on track.|`|KmzjSnzVaa	16 is a very good age to take up boxing. It means you are going to be fresher than many boxers that began when they were 8-13. If you want to be an amateur you wont be at your peak until you hit your early 20s anyway and if you want to go pro you will probably turn over when you are around 21. This gives you 5 years. if you are looking at the Olympic Games this gives you 3 years of building and 1 extra year until the Games. Good luck, it's an amazing sport.

I m sure its easier for them to beat the hell out of each other if they were in the same brand. Also since christians probably going to return to smackdown we might one day see edge and christian unite against the hardy's

Z8UV6S3baa	Ok, now we are getting into some nitty gritty and have to create a distinction between Accuracy and Precision. Oddly enough, this is largely a mathematical distinction:    Accuracy is generally considered to be a representation of the difference between a measure of the center of a group's, (most commonly by taking the vector minimum of a set of shots), distance from a designated aim point.   (Vector sum? What the heck is he talking about? Most shooters just do this by eyeball, and essentially we look at the shots and pick the center by picking the point in the center of the group which has the shortest sum of distances to the given shots. However, if you wanted to get technical about it there is a formula and everything.)    Precision is generally considered to be a measure of the variance (or standard deviation, whichever you prefer) of the shot distances from the designated center of the group.    So, if you are looking for accuracy, then you are probably looking at 5 four shot groups, because 4 shots is adequate to establish a center of a group, and you want a larger number of groups to assess how far away from the center you are. If you could reliably identify outliers, then 20 one shot groups would be statistically better, and assuming you aren't making adjustments in process would be realistically better as well, and shouldn't be differentiable from 1 twenty shot group. However in a practical sense usually you are doing this to move a sight or try different ammo loads and a sample of 1 is too small.    Now, if you are looking at precision, you need fewer groups and a higher count in each group for an accurate measure of precision. So again, ideally you would run 1 twenty shot group and have a great measure of standard deviation and ability to identify and cast out outliers. However, again, usually you are doing this for a comparison of something, like hand loads. In which case you are probably looking at either 4 five shot groups or 2 ten shot groups.    If you really are a geek about these things (which I have to admit I am at times) there are templates and such for this stuff to help make accurate measurements. However, I won't,unless you really want to know, bore you with the math behind this stuff.    Thinkingblade    P.S. - I didn't mention anything about the practical side of barrels heating up in a high power rifle, or any of that sort of thing. However, I am assuming that all of those factors are normalized across any of the choices of group.|`|h2KkiKK3aa	five four shot groups, because the gun companies use 3-4 shot groups to estimate their MOA.|`|AA11729094	When I bench test ammo I always use 5 shot strings, so my answer would be 4 five shot groups.|`|TEAKcA5Laa	four five shot groups. helps eliminate human error and fibs.|`|xOReEw6Waa	For me and my hunting rifles, I load up the magazine, have one in the pipe and shot for groups. I have Browning A-Bolts in 30-06 and 300 WSM so that means either 4 shots or 5. You don't say if you are cleaning between groups either, and that impacts accuracy. Also important is the dwell time for heat in the barrel;are you letting it cool between shots, cool longer between groups, etc. If you are competing then you obviously match the pace of the competition rules;but if you are simply sighting in a hunting rifle you normally take three shots and adjust if needed. Off a sand bag I can get 5 shots I can cover with a quarter with my 06. Still working on the 300 WSM but it is normally 4 shots under 1.75. I hand load so I can tune the load a lot easier than trying various factory ammos. If you can find a factory ammo for a hunting rifle that is 3 shots within  1.0 inch at 100 yards, you have a 1MOA rifle, not bad.   If you can do the same at 200 yards then it is a .5 MOA.   For my son and his single shot 243 Win., he can put 10 shots within 4.0 inches or less at 100 yards, not bad for a 90 pound 11 year old.|`|yaq7oaH6aa	You don't say how you intend to process the numbers.  (One shot is not a group. How the heck would you compute   anything from one round?)  Baring that, if you properly averaged all the group sizes,   20 shots total is twenty shots total.|`|Vakup5Jvaa	I shoot a 2-three shot groups after that with a big magnum I tend to get fliers.      You could probably use a 2-five shot groups and throw out any fliers. I would just pause a lot to let the barrel cool.    I'm sure others do it different.|`|GcOWoAmSaa	It depends on what you want to shoot when it counts. If you are using a hunting rifle the only shot that counts is the first one, so twenty groups of one shot each will tell you what the rifle will do when you shoot at that animal you want to kill. If you are just playing around and want to see averages of group sizes, then shoot four groups with 5 shots each. But if the barrel gets hot, I slow down.
iw3v5bgIaa	Abi,    If I remember correctly, Dominic Hasek started at about that age and became one of the most successful (if not unorthodox) goalies in the NHL.    If you want to play ice hockey, learn to skate well (forward, backwards, even sideways) without a stick before complicating matters (and possibly frustrating you) by integrating passing, shooting and puck handling into your game.    My advise is to get the skating down before investing in equipment.    If you are ready for equipment, check out the site below for equipment deals, discounts, close outs, new product lines and training aids to DVDs at great prices:    http://www.squidoo.com/sports-hockey-equ...|`|sK9kDAtLaa	go for it!  i know kids who started playing ice hockey when they were freshmen in high school.  Start now and try out for ur high school team when u r a freshman. GOOD LUCK|`|9GzkVwfGaa	yes it is ok. FTW you didn't have to tell us all those details|`|Y8AxM7c1aa	Yep, 13 is definitely not to late to be playing!  I started playing when I was in grade 6 (so around your age)   I'm now in grade 11 and playing on my provincial team.    I would suggest getting in power-skating for awhile. They will teach you how you do all the basics of skating (forward,backward,crossovers,etc.)    Then when you feel like you are stronger with your skating you can register with you local female (or male, whatever you prefer) hockey league.    Since your only staring off I would get your equipment at a sports store that sells used gear.  Nike-Bauer,RBK,Mission,Eagle are all great brands.|`|Cr7gfrAuaa	i started wen i was 13. and im already in AA its really fun. yeah its a great idea to join when ur 13.       good luck!!|`|bjzeWMZ0aa	Of course! I just started a year ago (at 14) and am confident I can make the school team next year.    Go for it! If it's what you love, you should have no problem improving in no time!
AA11528760	I hope Boogeyman is used in a more useful storyline than the past. He is extremely talented and strong. I just feel that he could be used for more than a "Mythical Nightmare" character to scare little children. If he were used more on a powerhouse basis, rather than "strange" character, he would be a more developed character.|`|xbez1qBPaa	I like him. Underused and under rated.   There is actually some talent under that make-up and worms.   Maybe he'd do more in a tag team?|`|0b8c6deec73968ee5de1b69c2345788caa	NO NO NO dont hide under my bed lol|`|HnOIAdTYaa	hes a beeeassttt(:  he's cool. i like him.|`|IMQm9JTMaa	i think boogeyman is a good wrestler, he has so much ability and potential, but the wwe is mis-using him. they need to give him a serious gimmick.|`|2rJwgk40aa	I like him.  I'd like to see wwe use him more.He should be put in a good feud maybe have that lead to a title win(IC,maybe?)|`|v4hFUpC5aa	the worms is unneeded in the wrestling ring its gross and distrespectful. maybe he should be turened into more of a domminant heel because the goodguy that eats worms doesnt work|`|Agsp62ttaa	I love that guy! The worms are definitely a nice touch.    Plus it's fun saying "I'm the boogeyman and I'm coming to GET YA!"|`|wQEVpe7zaa	My worst fear is worms, so I don't like him very much. My son, on the other hand, LOVES him & also loves hiding in his closet to "scare" us with his Boogeyman phrases. I'm just a little worried that when spring time comes he's actually going to bring real worms in the house! EWWW!

lNnCWMA2aa	yeah that kinda happend to me when i first started skating... i fell and broke my fist because of a rock in the road..u got to watch out for stuff like that.. u need to get wrist gards u can get them eny where ,walmart, k mart ,skate shop, target, skate park...there like 7 bucks or like a set of wrist Gard's elbow pads and  knee pads for like 20bucks...hope i helped.. and stay safe. look out for rocks|`|WrDGhduxaa	there are wrist guards made for skaters, I have seen them at the park.
g0WLiXa1aa	you can do whatever you put your mind to|`|ga4ZWsuZaa	Ya, if you can catch, be a wide receiver or a running back. You could also be a cornerback or safety.|`|TuOp3hNPaa	ull either play wr or corner prolly. an ya u can start as a junior. my brother did it|`|ZprjlxH3aa	anything possibly K.G|`|IoCK2bEnaa	At 135 as a junior, sure you can! With your body type, try out as a wide receiver or cornerback. Maybe sneak in as a kick/punt returner too. See what your best at. Both positions require similiar attributes like being able to jump high, good hands, quickness/speed. How much do you actually weigh though? The differential between your bench and squat is very strange. You bench only 135, but you squat 250??? Make sure you hit the weight room and build more upper body strength throughout the season too!|`|Vtwb90tRaa	Depends on what division your school is in. If you gain some muscle mass, you can walk on at a division II school and probably earn a spot on the roster. It also helps if your quick. If you have a really good 40, you can walk on no problem, they'll teach you any other skills necessary.     I wouldn't try LB, unless it's what you have your mind set on, because you will need to gain a good 50 lbs to even be considered at a LB position, and still you would be undersized, but if you have good speed, and you're willing to hit with everything you've got, you'll make the team.
AA10056762	I paintballed for a very short period of time. It was just too expensive at the time and I never fell through with it. I started airsofting and loved it. I soon became a sniper and loved my position on the field. It felt intense and very real. Paintball just seemed to fast paced for me. Of course the costs caught up with me. Sniping is expensive but I love it...probably more than I would paintball...but hey...thats just me.|`|U0Rvsabdaa	Airsoft has the pros of using actual sights and magazines. But its harder to tell who gets hit unless you use powerful guns and forgo heavy clothing.    Paintball is crippled by annoying C02 tanks and hoppers that obstruct the view. But you can tell who gets hit easily.    I'd say airsoft is better for realism, while paintball is easier to play.    Its personal preference, but I place airsoft above paintball.|`|AA10816337	Paintball. In my opinion, little bb's don't make you want to duck under cover unlike paintballs. And it's a whole lot easier to see if you get someone out.|`|Io1NcoJoaa	Airsoft is good if your playing with a bunch of friends that you know will call themselves out if they get hit. The good thing about paintball is once you hit someone and it breaks its more difficult to cheat.     I think paintball is a million time more fun(a little more expensive but all around more fun).Make sure you play at a field with refs and real bunkers. It will make your paintball experience more enjoyable.|`|gpwI2sbvaa	Airsoft, because of the realism, cost, and overall value. To all the people who can't tell when they are hit, try playing a match with 550 fps snipers, and 425 fps automatics.|`|b1yx4e8Eaa	airsoft because paintball guns are ick|`|7y687RUxaa	i perfer paintball because it is more realistic and more intense most of the time. HOWEVER it is more expensive than airsoft to play because the ammo is far more expensive. its a matter of preference but i prefer paintball|`|boB43p0xaa	airsoft is cool because the guns look real but it sucks paintball is great because your guns shoot much harder which makes it a blast to shoot     so i deff say paintball|`|yE535sgkaa	vettedude, you have no idea what you are talkin about do you? Airsoft is way more realistic and intense then paintball because you don't get all those annoyances like hoppers in ur face, and also co2 tanks in your shoulder.Plus, paintball ammo is in sum cases like $40 for a good box of 2000 paintballs, while for $16 i can buy 4000 high grade high polish bb's for my gun.  I would say they are both fun though. Personally, i prefer airsoft because of the realism but i prefer both. It all depends on you, airsoft isnt as widerspread as paintball so it is harder to find ppl to play with, as opposed to paintball where there are numerous places u can go and just jump in games.

D0zPjnzmaa	build up your stamina and do bleachers for 1 of 2 miles every day go up and down a bleacher (depending on its size) about 4 to 5 times and run around a track or neiborhood one time then again do the bleachers then repeat 5 to 6 times depending on how much you want to do this buirlds up leg muscle and stamina to get you going|`|B4VdNdo5aa	If you've got stairs in your house, sprint up and down them a number of times.   I personally used to do 10 up, and 10 coming down. I had 12 stairs and would do 5 reps of 20, so I did 1200 stairs a day.   If you can get 240 stairs or thereabouts in less than 1 minute 30 seconds or maybe 1.15, that'd be really good for you.   Another thing is to try the shuttle run, which is just a nice name for running suicides.  But just get out there and sprint when you can. Or go for longer runs. All are helpful.     Good luck, and happy running! :)

That way, you step up to the line and use your form that is natural for you and it's just like a practice free throw.|`|J1fxwkqraa	If you're a good free-throw shooter normally then its just a case of the pressure and the situation getting to you. What you need to do is work on a "routine". This is crucial for being able to transfer your success in practice to game situations. Like golfers (who have pre-shot routines), watch good free-throw shooters and you'll see they go through the same routine before taking each shot. This relaxes them and makes it easier for them to block everything else out and knock down free-throws in pressure situations.     If you're not a great free-throw shooter in practice then its time to spend some time at the line. Work on your mechanics like the people above have mentioned (bending your knees, aiming at the same spot on the ring every time, arc, back-spin, etc). Create drills and games for yourself to make the practice time easier.     Wishing you nothing but net,     Dodge Taylor

Plus media wars int eh paper and the comments Fergie and him exchanged probably took their toll as well. I never really blame a manager,but I actually dont think he should go,not just yet. All Liverpool need is a chance to redeem themsleves,which I beleive they can do so. I suppose it was the fact that it was Wigan,but the game is all about chance.  Been honest,yeah I was surprized with the substitutions. They were a wee bit bizzare.

obPSaYf3aa	Professional bowling (PBA men and women's) rules are much more strict and rigid than usual regular adult/jr. league or high school class, but also follow the rules set by the USBC, which is the governing body of bowling.    For instance, in my regular USBC league and my son's jr. USBC league, we bowl with one lane separating each bowler on the approach.  In the PBA, we use one full pair of lanes and have to use our best judgment when seeing someone go up to the approach before we step up in order to give them courtesy.  In my USBC league, I can re-rack the pins by myself as many times as I want to, but in PBA tournament proper, have to ask for permission to do so at the rate of two re-racks per game.    Regarding hygiene and dress code, in my USBC league, I can wear just about anything from shorts to slacks with t-shirts or polos.  My son can wear the same in his jr. league.  You can also wear a full beard and a mullet, if desired.  In the PBA,  there is a dress code where you have limited choices in apparel to wear mock necks, polo shirts, "underarmour" material t-shirts, PBA 50th anniversary patches on our shirts/slacks, no denim jeans in competition, neat slacks or khakis and neatly cut hair and minimal facial hair kept clean.  I've seen a fellow bowler in the PBA Western Region qualify in a tournament with a short colored mohawk, but don't know if they called him on it.    Scoring during tournaments is somewhat similar but the PBA gives "bonus pins" and USBC gives out handicap pins based upon averages to even out the field, because in the PBA, everyone bowls essentially "scratch", but get rewarded for wins in match play.  High school bowlers cannot earn straight cash, but rather scholarship money towards college educations and trophies/medals/patches from the USBC.  Professional bowlers are considered doing it for a living and are independent contractors bowling for a way to support themselves and their families.  Some pros like myself, have full time jobs and supplement their income by bowling in the PBA regional program.      Hope this helps!|`|JuTyQgQiaa	ones harder|`|6iuZEUhzaa	yo ben s your an asshole|`|jH8hIB0kaa	Once you turn pro, you can not participate in amateur tournaments. Pro is with a declaration to have sponsorship or participate in a paying tournament.|`|czNUMFdWaa	As a High School Coach and PBA member, I can tell you that both associations are similar yet nothing alike.  The rules are actually somewhat similar.  There are dress codes, lane courtesies, ball weight restrictions, etc.      Most high school competition requires a two lane courtesy and the PBA requires a one pair courtesy on each side.  It's essentially the same thing just a little more rigid.    The main differences in dress code have to do with sponsorship.  The PBA is very strict regarding what can be on bowler clothing.  No unapproved logos etc.  In other words, you couldn't just wear a Polo brand or Nike brand.  In my high school conference, the athletes are required to wear school bowling shirts and dress pants so there isn't too much difference there.    Regarding appearance, the PBA has "loosened" up quite a bit in recent years.  It's not unusual to find a bowler with long hair, tattoos, earrings, etc.  I saw one bowler that had hair almost to his waist.  He did have to wear it in a ponytail though.    There is a slight difference in equipment.  The ball weights and balance requirements are the same but "plugged" balls are somewhat frowned upon in the PBA.  They are allowed but the plug material has to be clear and the ball can only be plugged once where there is virtually no limit on plugging in the USBC as long as the ball "balances" out.     The manufacturer of the equipment also has to be approved by the PBA.  For example Lane Masters (which I love) is USBC approved but not PBA approved.    The bowling experience is very different between High School and the PBA.  In high school, you'll typically bowl three games (6 in sectionals...maybe 12 at State) and total pinfall wins. (There are many other formats...points, games, baker, etc)      In the PBA,  you might bowl anywhere from 32-64 games.  If you are not exempt, you'll need to qualify via TQR (Tournament Qualifying Round) and then there is the qualifying round where the top 32 advance, then 16, and so on.    The absolute biggest difference would be lane condition.  Most High School competition takes place on a typical house shot (THS) where there is considerably less oil on the outside part of the lane than the middle (or inside) part of the lane.  This allows for a greater margin of error.    The PBA patterns vary and typically have only a 2 to 1 ratio of oil from the outside-in whereas a THS could very well have a 10 to 1 difference.  In other words, PBA patterns are much harder to score on.  Most bowlers will see a 20-30 pin difference in average.      I almost forgot...to be a PBA member you have to hold a 200+ average unless you cash as an amateur in a PBA tournament.  There is also a membership fee that has to be paid on a monthly or annual basis.    There is much more that I can write but this should give you a pretty good idea.  Hope this helps.  Also, look into College Bowling on the USBC website.  There is a ton of scholarship money out there and a great way to really learn the game.|`|jLTDqVHsaa	The actual gameplay is almost exactly the same, really.    High schools will likely operate under USBC rules:  http://www.bowl.com/rules/rulebook.aspx    Professional bowling is under PBA rules (PDF format!):  http://www.pba.com/file_upload/members/r...    There are nuanced differences on equipment restrictions, dress code, pin re-rack requests, things like that.  PBA bowling also has a very specific set of lane oil patterns for competition.    It's still 60 feet from the foul line to the center of the headpin.  The pins are the same.  A strike is a strike, a spare is a spare, the scoring is the same, the maximum ball weight is still 16 pounds.  There's nothing blatantly, obviously different between USBC and PBA bowling in the gameplay itself.    Generally, high school bowling is done in team formats, while professional bowling is mostly individual.
n2O0NwR6aa	Just sort of make a joke about it.  Say, "Okay, you better sit down for this one... you're not gonna believe this... are you ready?  I've decided that I want to do cheerleading!  Really!  I'm totally serious! So can I please take a tumbling class?"      It might take them a minute to realize you're serious... and they might even laugh or tease you about it... but that's okay.  Laugh with them.  It IS kinda funny, isn't it?  After you've always made fun of it.  But once they realize that you're completely serious about it, I'm sure they'll get used to the idea and support your decision.      The truth is, a LOT of girls who've said "I'd never be a cheerleader!" do end up doing it.  And it's a surprise to everyone who knows them.  But hey, life is full of surprises.  We all change our minds about things and sometimes take a course we never expected.  That's part of life!  So don't feel guilty or nervous about it.  Just follow your heart and do what makes you happy!     Good luck!  =)|`|JuTyQgQiaa	just tell them u like it and cry to them lol|`|4XcmCKPbaa	just be like    "mom, i have thought about it for a while and i think cheerleading would be fun. I know you may not agree but just listen for a second. I think it would be really cool to do all of those tricks and stuff. It is a lot like dance but just more tumbling. I think it would be so awesome just to show school spirit"    haha something like that|`|YMbaFWA2aa	http://cheerlikeumeanit.synthasite.com/  Its not embarrassing its Just a sport.  Tell her i doubt shell make anything of it : D|`|3c3a6998da4c577a09bc2789d0d7787caa	Don't be afraid of your parents. They should not judge you or make fun of your goals. Tell them straight up that you've had a change in heart and that you want to cheer. Maybe tell them some pros'...make a lot of friends, become flexible, it will boost your confidence, looks good on college applications, could possibly get you a scholarship to college, etc... If they say no, especially because THEY just aren't into it then they really aren't supportive parents and should re-evaluate their parenting skills. Good luck.|`|bfee60f409aa513990b67c64614195fdaa	sit down with your parents and tell them you need to tell them something, they shouldnt judge you before you have said what you want to say.  tell them that things have changed and you want to do soemthing you never thought you would do.  tell them why you really want to do cheerleading.  good luck adn cheerleading a great thing to do!|`|gHWyLQUfaa	i am a cheerleader,and it is a good sport,mostly if you havea  good team,and i have a really good team,the Folsom Bulldogs(youtube it) anyways,alot of people don't see what cheerleaders really are,they are hard working strong athletes,and we do alot,we have to lift people up in the air,dance jump,and be able to not screw around..it is nothing to be assamed of,just sit your parents down and tell them the reasons,maybe show them you have put a lot of though into it by researching squads in your area..good luck,and i know that if you have hard work and perserverence,you can do it.|`|roFGlldOaa	If you ask your mom and say it with courage, she should most likely say yes!

QTd8MVDjaa	The pockets aren't for anything specific. You can put whatever you want in them. The big pocket in the back is for an air tank (CO2 or HPA) so you can use a remote to tank your tank off the gun. You can put money, tools, a snack, map, squeegee, and stuff like that in the front pockets. The strings I guess adjust the tightness of the vest. Play with them and find out how tight the strings need to be

8ivnzNi5aa	Where do you live?  There should be any number of gun stores near you.  For the biggest selection, try Jay's Sporting Goods in Clare and Gaylord, or Cabela's in Dundee.  Or you could go to Gander Mountain or MC Sports.  If you're near Traverse City, go to Hampel's Gun Shop.  Your purchase permit is good at any licensed dealer in the state.<br>  <br>  You could also check out the gun and knife shows at the Gibraltar Trade Centers in Taylor and Mount Clemens, but only on weekends.|`|MEOjwPCNaa	Traditionally, you would go to a gun store to buy a gun.

To think that liverpool worked so hard in the start of the season! Liverpool's not performing well is because there are too many problems happening in the club!

We are not seeing results with him.|`|c65125310c801112d2ca421b6ef869edaa	how the tables turn eh!|`|QKgWDWooaa	Don't even think about not backing rafa he is a great manager it's not is fault the players don't give it 100% (apart from Gerrard). We'll pick up pace now just you watch, liverpool for the premiership!!!|`|9d792c6e2da6e5b53a036baec7115b43aa	I cannot understand why Benitez is so popular with Liverpool fans. He has a good record in Europe but on the home front Liverpool have not looked like challenging for the title for years. I watched the highlights of the Wigan game and Liverpool should have won easily. Their inability to score goals is certainly going to cost them any chance of winning the title. Torres looks a shadow of what he was last season. I am also amazed that Liverpool spend 20 million pounds on a player and then treat him as a fringe player. I feel very sorry for Keane as he is a very talented footballer and always gives 110%. Kuyt may not be the most gifted player but again he works his socks off. I do not understand why Gerrard was taken off. It cannot be to save him for the weekend game as there were only 8 minutes left when he was taken off. I can remember a time when if you were playing Liverpool you expected to lose. They hold no fear anymore and most teams fancy their chances against them. I cannot see anyway Liverpool will win the title this season and personally I think it is time for Benitez to go.|`|kfj5sOsgaa	When we turned the new year top, I looked at the fixtures ahead and predicted it would be a tough January. However I never predicted the Gerrard court case or Rafa's silly rant against Sir Alex. Rafa has started to go back to type and rotate the side too much and we are again seeing inconsistent performances. I will always support the manager and will never call for his head, but he really does need to get a grip and go back to playing the strongest side when it comes to Premier League games. As for what he is doing to Robbie Keane...dont get me started. Anyway all you so called Liverpool fans out there, lets get behind the team and stop slagging them or the manager.
IBEVI6YQaa	I'm originally from North Carolina and we have great golf courses around the Greensboro and Pinehurst area.  Pinehurst is probably more well known and was voted 2008's Best U.S. Golf Course.  Both locales have been home to the PGA as well.  As for as lodging, Pinehurst is also a resort with accommodations on site that also features a spa and fine dining.  There are many great lodgings in and around the Greensboro area as well.  You might be interested in checking out a bed & breakfast (there are quite a few in the region).  For more info on Pinehurst, you could check out www.pinehurst.com, the official website of the golf course and resort.  Greensboro offers the Bryan Park Golf Course (www.bryanpark.com) and Crooked Tree Golf Course (www.crookedtreegolfcourse.com), both of which I have seen in person and are very beautiful as well as golf paradises!    Hope I've helped at least a little.|`|rjEnFSAIaa	Seahawk has it right: the Pinehurst area is loaded with great courses. If you can't afford to play & stay at the actual Pinehurst courses, you should check out Fayetteville for bargain accommodations.

Know breeding aspects, training, how horses run under what conditions.<br>  Get to know the industry, trainers, hot walkers, grooms, etc. Get to know other jockeys an get tips on how they got their start.<br>  Watch your weight. In most countries a jockey can never weigh more than 115 pounds. You have to maintain weight in order to meet weight requirements..<br>  Most jockeys start by working in other aspects of the training process. They hot walk horses (cool them down after training) grooming and participate in exercising duties long before they actually become a jockey. They get to know the profession and decide if this is the career they want to have.<br>  You need to go to Jockey School such as Frank Garza Jockey School in Southern California. There are also jockey schools like Chris McCarons in Kentucky..<br>  Going to jockey school is not required, but if you are not Grandfathered into <br>  it, it is a big plus. If you can already ride and can pass the test by the <br>  stewards, it is not necessary.<br>  <br>  You start by running schooling races. These are races that help you get familiarized with racing and track facilities, and prepare you to become a jockey. Often this is required before you can obtain a jockey license.<br>  You must have a license in order to be a jockey. Most racetracks provide applications and the license is good for any racetrack within a given area. Recommendation from a trainer to jockey school is a huge plus. <br>  <br>  Jockeys are paid on a per mount (race) basis. The fees are between $30 per mount and $100 per mount depending on the purse structure at each particular track. Those are the fees jockeys receive if they do not finish first, second or third. The jockey of the winning horse receives an amount equal to 10% of the winning owner' s share of the total purse. (The winning owner in most states receives 60% of the total purse.) The second place jockey receives 5% of the owner' s share of the second place purse money. (The second place owner receives 20% of the total purse in most states.) The third place jockey receives 5% of the owner' s share of the third place purse money. (The third place owner receives 15% of the total purse in most states.) The most successful jockeys can earn over a million dollars a year. The least successful will make less the $20,000 per year. The record for purse earnings in one year by a jockey is $23,354,960.00* set by Jerry Bailey in 2003. *These are the earnings of the horses, not the jockey. As a rule of thumb, a jockey' s real earnings are approximately 7% of the horses' earnings.<br>  <br>  Thanks ?. there is no reason we can't be friends, and I appreciate your thoughts.<br>  <br>  <br>  Source(s):<br>  Horse owner and breeder<br>  Avid horse racing enthusiast|`|8lsBBK62aa	The British Racing School at Newmarket.<br>  <a href="http://www.brs.org.uk/Home/index.php" rel="nofollow">http://www.brs.org.uk/Home/index.php</a>|`|V028jDjWaa	First of all you need to gain experience at the track and work from the bottom up. That's working as a hotwalker and then eventually you can get on some horses around the shed (barn) and then go out on them at the track. Eventually riding races can happen!  You need to get to know trainers and get lots of racetrack experience. It isn't easy to break into.It's good that you're getting riding lessons, but Thoroughbred racehorses are a different, high strung breed. So get experience with them. <br>  <br>  To get onto the track and work, you need to go there and the guard may page that trainers looking for a hotwalker can find you up there. Or approach trainers in the grandstand, they would usually take your information if an opening comes up. <br>  <br>  As for your weight, it is fine and remember because you get a 10 lb. weight allowance to start as an apprentice - they shave 10 lbs off the normal riding weight to help you get a start getting mounts. If you are a robust eater it would be something you would have to give a lot of thought to because weight is everything to jockeys. If you don't make the weight alloted to your horse then trainers don't want to ride you. Eating habits would have to become a new way of thinking..<br>  <br>  You don't need to go to a 'jockey school' which are pretty difficult to find depending where you live. <br>  <br>  The pay for a jockey varies greatly. Some become very popular at good tracks and make lots of money. But the vast majority only scrape by. So just so you know, don't get into it for the money.<br>  <br>  And lastly, good luck!!|`|7mdbyjVEaa	Usually i disagree with Vickie but she's dead on 100% right, since if you no experience go to Lexington and go to the racing school there, also there is a training center nearbye where you could get a job walking hots and learning a little more of the trade on the way.|`|OeCpZ5pFaa	Retired jockey Chris Mccarron runs a jockey school in Kentucky USA. Do a search on yahoo and get info about going there. Otherwise, if you already know how to ride a horse, go to your local track and look for work as an exercise rider and work your way up to riding races.|`|PwZZJh1taa	check out a jockey school in PR its the best in the world|`|cQm0RmLOaa	Most people have to work up the ranks  walking hots,  grooming, galloping then maybe getting a shot to ride.  Training farms are the best place for this.  you must come to the track with some experience to ride.  However Chris McCarron has started the North American Racing Academy in KY.  That is your best bet.  you start from the ground up but in a much shorter time with expert instruction thus eliminating the pitfalls of depending on someone else to give you a shot.<br>  Good Luck|`|b6z1Uf9Aaa	go buy an orse den practice like hell ,

AA10705794	It could have been Floyd Patterson. He trained in the Catskills with Cus D'Amato.|`|KmzjSnzVaa	You need to describe him first?
Vtwb90tRaa	Depends on how well you tackle. If you tackle well, you could play SS, if not, work on speed drills and you could make for a good returner, or a changeup back. Heck, if you have a decent arm you could play QB.     If you know what position you want to play, look up training techniques that you can do to build your skills to play it.|`|k6JMrs0Caa	I'd say a wide receiver|`|AA11108627	Cheerleader.  Or mascot.  :)    But seriously, how are we supposed to know, based on that information?  Talk to your football coach.  He would have a much better answer than we ever could.|`|TuOp3hNPaa	wr an corner.  but the coach will decide|`|FmZyN6ORaa	that's not nearly enough information...ask your school's coach|`|RtQDbYQzaa	i would say corner or maybe safety.|`|bAvWkOdUaa	tight end or safety..most likely safety.
U5l7LZ3kaa	Whoa - You've got talent!  Go out for track.  I ran just over 6 minutes in 8th grade with no training.  The next year I went out for track and ran 4:55 as a freshman.  I think you could do that with the training you have described.    Good luck - Coach Tief
ucot94w3aa	There are snowboard bags made specifically for travel, which are more heavily padded than regular bags.  Buy one.  Then I would get some bubble wrap and fully wrap your board in it.  Or as someone else already mentioned, wrap your clothes around it.  I would also pay special attention to the nose and tail.  I wouldn't trust baggage handlers with anything.|`|jTaW3goeaa	I'd be worried, the last time I flew I watched baggage handlers allow bags to fall from the cargo door straight down to the ground because they weren't putting the things on the conveyor belt the right way.  So no, I would never trust the idiots at the airlines with my snowboard.  I would wrap the board several times with protective foam to minimize the risk of damage if you're going to check it on the plane.    If you know anybody in Utah, you can consider shipping it out there, with how much it costs to check bags today its probably the same price or cheaper to do this, and if you pack it right it won't be broken.      Plus so many people lose luggage on airlines and I wouldn't want that happening to my board, if You shipped it, you'd have a tracking number and know where it is at all times.     I believe you can prearrange for pickup at a UPS distribution center to so if you don't know anybody in Utah you might be able to do it this way.  Its worth looking into because if it can be done its probably a better option, and like I said I would never trust the airlines with my board.|`|xjS2Hdjbaa	your stuff will be fine, the only thing is that they're definitely gonna search your snowboard bag.  it happens everytime i go anywhere|`|a0a8LsN5aa	It will be fine snowboards wont snap even if they are thrown around and if you want you should just ask the people to be careful with it or write delicate on it haha.|`|oij6ZrxXaa	pack your boarding clothes inside your board bag, like wrap your snowpants and coat around the edges of the board for extra padding    it shouldnt be a problem, your boards gonna get knicked up in Utah boarding anyway|`|nRYVWkpEaa	Well,   I have travelled with my snowboard to Utah, and on a separate occasion, Colorado.   Neither time did I have trouble.   I had a snowboard bag, and the board looked the same when it came out as when I put it in.   Just be aware of the possibilities.  You're always gonna have that chance that they're not careful with it, cause to be quite honest, those people working there never seem like they want to be working.  I was pretty nervous, but our party had snowboards and skis, and they all were fine.  Sorry, I don't know what else you should do, simply because I've had no trouble.  goodluck!:)

ZKikquiOaa	no ground game in kick boxing.|`|nRBC4E5saa	There is a tremendous difference.  Kick boxing uses larger gloves that cover the fingers and palm.  Under some rules they also wear shin pads or padded "boots" on the feet.  Techniques are restricted to kicks, punches, and under certain rules, knees, elbows, and some clinch fighting.    MMA fighters wear smaller gloves with open fingers and palms.  This is because in addition to the strikes that are used in kick boxing, grappling techniques such as takedowns, ground fighting, and submission holds are allowed.  So while kick boxing is only striking, MMA is strikes, takedowns, and grappling.|`|LaBxzWa7aa	Mixed Martial Arts incorporates all styles that don't violate the sport's rules such as eye poking(Krav Manga), crouch hitting(Krav Manga), biting(Krav Manga) and head butting(Krav Manga)     Being what it is, MIXED martial arts, it incorporates grappling martial arts as well: which including various forms of Judo(Ju-Jitsu, Brazilian Ju-Jitsu, Sambo) and wrestling.     Kickboxing is a mix of Eastern Martial Arts such as Karate, Muai Thai and various Japanese striking focuses.     MMA is a mix of everything, so we actually see what's effective in 1 on 1 combat.|`|CdAE4nXcaa	kickboxing is only stand up with the use of some sweeps in muay thai and stand up grappling in muay thai as well but no submissions, or wrestling. mma is not a specific martial art. although that's what it's turning out to be. by mixing up different styles of fighting from stand up to ground you have more options to work with and you will be a well rounded fighter on the ground and in stand up

WrDGhduxaa	since you need to lose some weight and  your heart rate was very high, you need to slow down.  Your hips may hurt because of your weight and lack of exercise or your shoes.  This is not normal, try just walking for a week or two and see how you feel.  The gym should have stationary bikes which are good, and elliptical is also.  If you want to be consistent you need to do something that does not cause you pain after you are finished each day.|`|451075cc0b28ffa413b31fd0b3fd84c0aa	"and so on" ?  sounds like you did too much.  muscles should hurt  joints shouldn't  tone it down.  walk or power walk.  get good shoes.|`|j5hak6SIaa	1. Try doing some leg stretching before & after running.  I am sure you can find good way of stretching thru google.    In fact you can search for streching whatever hurts such as hip joints. I hope it helps|`|OHs8yJiOaa	You're almost certainly running too hard.    Try keeping it to a conversational pace -- something where you'd be able to carry on a conversation if need be without gasping for air.    You will burn almost exactly the same calories per mile regardless of pace. Though it's good to get in at least 30 minutes per session, for losing weight, ultimately worry more about the distance you cover than how fast you go. You can even just walk the entire distance, though it may simply take a bit more time than if you ran parts of it.    You're not going to do yourself any good if you injure yourself or burn out, and you're at a higher risk for injury when you're just starting out and your body has yet to physically adapt to the pounding.    Slow it down when you do run, and if walking is more sustainable for you especially early on, there's nothing wrong with doing that instead if you'd like. You're also likely to benefit from cross training, taking days off from running to do something like biking, rowing, or swimming instead -- likely outright alternating days early on.    You might want to look into heart rate zones as well to better understand the ranges that are appropriate for you individually. Without knowing things like age, it's hard to even estimate, but it's likely you should be training with your heart rate a good deal lower than that (in the middle of whatever Zone 3 would be for you).    You don't necessarily need to find a different exercise. You need to do whatever exercise you're doing correctly.|`|0dbDQh8Haa	that's normal, but it's not good. once you exercise more you're body will get more used to it and won't be as hurt during and after the run. and i advise running outside. that way it's more entertaining and you can't stop whenever you want.|`|Rt6ajbqoaa	you really need to start off slow and make sure you are stretching a lot! try lightly jogging, sometimes when trying to loose weight people will just try and run hard, but that has little benefit because your endurance is not strong enough and you should build it up.

sZ2ggavJaa	You will probably need a little wider board than normal if you buy a woman's board.  When riding, it takes more time to get a wide board from edge to edge obviously because the the distance is bigger.. so try not to go any wider than you need.  Look for a board with a waist width of 25.2-25.5 whether or not it's called a wide or mid-wide I don't know, but that's the size you want for your boot size.|`|p51w3k0laa	I agree with josh|`|ucot94w3aa	You will probably need a wide board.  However, if your board is long enough it may already have the width you need.
oMjVp4zGaa	I sold my boat five years ago. I guided in So Cal Waters mostly inshore. If you want to spend nights out you will need a galley and a head so go with Genmar it is the parent company for most of the best fishing boats in the world. A few of the best yachts as well. For the money? Find one at all the harbor police auctions. You will find beauties usually some dumb drug runner got caught in and you can buy it for a quarter it's worth....|`|43JgLpkKaa	off shore - 22 - 23  foot roballo  single engine center console  in shore - 19 foot  sea craft  single outboard center console|`|jf0UV1Bjaa	Im not a charter captain, but i work commercially on the water. crabbing and netting within the chesapeake.  We tend to use the chesapeake dead rises around here, but if youre looking for a nice solid fishing boat for offshore, go with grady white, striper, robalo, pro line, or wellcrafts.  All those are great fishing boats.  if youre going offshore fishing, the length and beam have major importance.  Rough waters will require atleast 23 feet of boat or more and a closed cabin with washboards are needed if waves break over the bow.  If its an open bow the water will come right in the boat and sink your vessel.  If you plan on doing charters, youll need a much larger boat for load safety and comfort.  All on where youre fishing and what kind of fishing youre doing.|`|vwoVlTViaa	I'm not a captain but I did sleep at Holiday Inn Express last night and I say Gravois aluminum boats built in Jenerette, La. is by far the best boat I've fished out of  in over 30 years of fishing. They are expensive as hell and very hard to come by but worth every penny.  This link has a few opinions: http://www.rodnreel.com/Forum/topic.asp?...    They started building boats for the military, Coast Guard, and other government agencies a couple of years ago under the name MetalShark and put a hold on recreational boats.

Ar5VHDiBaa	So did I..... I was busy all day & this was the 1st i had heard the news, sorry for my rant. I'm not upset they dealt either player but Heilman is HORRIBLE|`|hR87A418aa	HA peavy will b traded at the trade deadline :)|`|5SevMeDiaa	Who cares? Rickey only care about what Rickey is doing.|`|wrGN5BNmaa	Olson has very little value, so he would have had very little importance in a Peavy deal. I'd actually say Heilman would have MUCH more value in a Peavy deal than Olson. I'm pretty sure that the Cubs aren't interested in Peavy anymore, though.|`|tOwK65PRaa	Cubs are still going after Peavy and Heilman is not like olsen who the Padres were interested in, but Im suer Hendry will work it out.|`|4TgxrCX4aa	The question is why the Cubs are interested in having Heilman (or Olson for that matter). The rotation is probably the most solid piece of the Cubs team with Zambrano, Lilly, and Dempster as a dependable 1-2-3 and Harden as a great 4 when healthy. As for fifth or a spot starter, Marshall or other pitchers in the organization could more than handle those roles as well as Heilman or Olson. I'm assuming that the Peavy trade won't go through, but even if it does, aren't the players we're trading away worth more than either of these two pitchers?  Why aren't the Cubs focusing on more pressing needs like relievers or some left-handed bats?

I get butterflies in my stomach because I am worried I'll screw up. lol. But I never do. They always go away right when the ball is tipped.     I just warm up, shoot around, run around the gym once or twice, stretch, tell myself we're going to beat the crap out of the team. Just be optimistic. They'll go away the second the ball is in play.    Good luck!|`|fc5a2676d0a9ea687d91d44050637158aa	Butterflies are natural...it means your ALIVE!    In regards to your coach, i have been a coach, and it is not the job of the coach to stroke your ego to make you feel good, ( the great coaches inspire tho) however they are there to help minimize the negatives in practice so they dont become bad habits in the game. " you play how u practice..practice makes perfect.    In your career you will come across good and bad coaches and because of their appraoch to the game or their personality they might drain you. but just remember the initial reason why you started loving the game..and remember anything worth having is worth working for..and championships aren't jus given away to anyone who wants one..they're earned|`|WK3Kx4Mkaa	Listen to some pump up music and just don't worry about it just play the game|`|45e71bc8ca903cd0b9c0e4294eff6f04aa	i used to get butterflies and it would be such a bad adrenaline rush that my stomach would hurt but my coach told me to get your adrenaline out by moving around and stretching and running in place. you know just warming up. try and stay active and not just sitting around ya know?|`|NWa5i60Kaa	Definitely get good earphones, like the Skullcandy earbuds that have high sound quality with good bass, and if you have an iPod, go to settings>EQ>bass booster. then play some exciting music, like rap or techno. Close your eyes while listening to it.|`|tBuzrlSdaa	Listen to music|`|8paBQAk5aa	Well as an athlete, you've got to block out the negatives and make yourself better. Remember what your coach says, then do it right. To get rid of the butterflies, listen to your Ipod before the game. It will get you pumped up. Then when your on the court, don't think about what the people in the stands are seeing. You're out there to win and that's all. Who cares what others think? You're out there to get yours and yours only|`|vCCCy5ljaa	well honestly i like the teaching methiod where the coaches arte mean it has alwayse made me work somuch harder to impres them then i think to not have the butterflyes just have more confidence in yourself and your team:D hope i helped

NXktxy8jaa	I Think it will be Vladimir Kozlov. He is getting a huge push at the moment and I think with him and Triple H in the Chamber, a brutal fight will start, and thats what the fans want to see. Each superstar in the Elimination Chamber match is involved in a feud with another. Undertaker and The Big Show, Edge and Jeff Hardy, and It would only make sense to put Kozlov in there because he is in a new feud with Triple H. Not only that but Kozlov is on the cover of No Way Out. But I wouldnt be surprised if Its Matt Hardy in there instead, or even Umaga. I dont think that Christian will be in the Elimination Chamber match, but he might return at that Pay-Per-View. Superstars tend to return at No Way Out just like how The Big Show did last year. Christian might come out, cut a promo, and that will get him started in a feud. But like I always say, knowing the Brain That Vince Mcmahon has, anything can happen.    BQ: Yes, its about time he gets inducted. He is one of the all-time great wrestlers that competed in the wrestling industry back in the day, and its great he is getting rewarded for it.|`|KIOR56r6aa	Buddy, Jeff hasn't been announced, it's Kozlov. As for the 6th, it's probably Umaga or Matt.    BQ : Of course!!|`|7rpILeYtaa	the 6 that have been announced are:  1. Edge  2. Triple H  3. Undertaker  4. Big Show  5. Jeff Hardy  6.

Matt Hardy hm Nah he'll be involved some way though    BQ-I didnt know I must have missed it but thats awesome|`|Xar3YgiRaa	Definantly Matt Hardy.     He wins and a Triple threat at Wrestlemania Edge vs Jeff vs Matt.    BQ: Didn't know that but now im happy. Everybody is getting inducted by Ric Flair though. Shows how much of a legend he is.|`|kGCd8ioRaa	Matt Hardy|`|8tSbcUj9aa	It's Kozlov as much as I hate to say it.  It has already been confirmed.     BQ:  I think its great that he's being inducted, but I think its risky as well.  Austin wanted Flair to induct him, but WWE said no because Flair wasn't contracted anymore.  If Flair inducts Steamboat, we may see another Austin Flip Out.  WWE has to be careful for this one, because Austin is the biggest name in this year's HOF, unless they suddenly plan to induct the Rock.  Rock and Austin could have a match at WM25! Lol I wish.|`|hIJRrIWiaa	hmm maybe mr kennedy will make his return and compete in the elimination chamber match.|`|AA10341097	its Kozlov.

AA11580219	2003 is a great class, but i would have to pick 1996 as the best because that class had kobe, nash, iverson, camby, peja, jermaine oneal, stephon marbury, antione walker, ray allen, and shareef abdur raheem, who are all star players. Even guys like derek fisher and erick dampier were drafted that year|`|wXxJUnLJaa	I gotta go with 96|`|KdhNCnEjaa	In my opinion it is 1984 by far  This draft has 4 of the NBAs 50 greatest players, no other draft can say that.

FO9WK7kjaa	Yes they are different and there are softball bats out there. Just make sure you get the right one because there are slow pitch and fast pitch. Along a regular baseball bats. Oh if you are not in shape make sure that you start running and the key to be a good baseball or softball player is to not be afraid of the ball and be aggressive.|`|4usNNeXSaa	baseballexpress.com they have all kinds of softball bats and gloves varying in price|`|sHXazyDWaa	Solfball bats sure do exist. The bets place that I know of to get them is at Dicks. They have lots of baseball and softball bats there.|`|0Pd6INebaa	There is a difference between baseball and softball bats. Softball bats tend to taper up a little to the main part of the barrel, and then go straight to the end of the bat. sometimes they will say ASA on them, too so if your not sure look for that. Baseball bats taper all of the way up, so there is a pretty distinct difference.|`|uN0S6Nbvaa	lol yes, there are such things as softball bats.  They are skinnier than baseball bats.

H3nbC71eaa	He might've had talent, but overall he was just bland. He was pretty much not standing out from the other's that much. He was the traditional babyface, what didn't help him was just that he wasn't anything different for the fans.I don't think him being WCW champion would've done any good for WCW...since during the time he was there WCW wasn't doing that well...they had great wrestling but not much of an audience...so putting the belt on him wouldn't have helped. They tried to keep the fans interested by keeping the belt on wrestlers like Sting, Vader or Flair.|`|UWJinEbIaa	Using the Russian Leg Sweep as his finisher is the primary reason why he went nowhere.  But I'm willing to say that any combination of Brad, Steve, Scott could of been at least US Tag Team Champions.

The NWA/WCW could have done a lot more with him, He did win the NWA World Light Heavyweight Championship, but not the NWA World Heavyweight Title or the WCW World Heavyweight Title. I have to agree "Candyman Brad Armstrong" was not the greatest gimmick. Another one was Thunder and Lightning when he wrestled Tag Team with White Lightning Tim Horner.
rJMZdp04aa	Y2J - You probably know my answer to this already but:    Wrestling has Always been the One thing in My Life that has Always been there.  If something is going like Sh*t , I know for at Least 2 hours , I can Be Entertained & take my Mind Off whatever is bothering me.  Because that's Really , Truly what WWE & all Entertainment is for.  For as long as I can Remember , That's how it's been.  But as for how I decided this would be the path I follow:    I was at Football Practice , And During it , I got hurt.  I Couldn't play for the Entire Season.  Naturally , I was Pissed for a few days.  But as I was Watching RAW one night , and as happened to ALL of Us , That thought crept into my head - "What If"?  I couldn't Stop thinking about that Question - What If?  A few days later I was Watching a Highlight Reel Music Video of Survivor Series 2002 with the song "I Dare You" by Shinedown as the background Music.  I don't know WHAT it was about that Video or Song (Still Don't) , But something Just Clicked.  I began looking up Everything I possibly Could on How you go about becoming a Pro Wrestler & How to make it to WWE.  Once I had it all put together , I told my family , And Surprisingly Enough - They were ok with It.  I put my Money down & got into the Class , and as they say - I haven't looked back , and It has since been the Best Decision I've ever made.    Everytime I hear or Play "I Dare You" , it still gives me Chills.    As far as Encouragement though - Guys like Cena , Edge , & The Hardy's.  All were told they couldn't become anything.  Cena & The Hardy's coming from No Name Towns to the Big Time.  And all 4 being lifelong fans who had a Dream , Chased It , & Succeeded.  They all went from Nothing , and Became Everything.      Honestly , I've Always knew being a Wrestler is what I was Meant to do , I just needed something to push me in the Right Direction.  Getting hurt was Just that.  Hell Yeah , I was P*ssed when it happened , But now , I'm Extremely Grateful that it Did.  Without that Happening , I may have never gotten The Idea , and Never made the Decision to Go for it.

And Kurt Angle comes up pretty close behind these guys. John Cena is close, but to me he is fairly new as well as Randy Orton, but Orton is a beast, so I can't leave him out.   Triple H  Chris Jericho  Randy Orton  The Undertaker  Shawn Michaels|`|vaVkveEkaa	I think all of you are forgetting Mr. RKO.    Randy Orton's the most popular guy in WWE. He gets cheered as a true heel, even when he has no reason to (i.e., The Rock cuts funny promos, Stone Cold was a SOB). Triple H is Triple H, anyone would want to live as him, and have a sledgehammer whereever they go, nuff said. Cena's a kid's guy through and through, and is the face of the company. Jeff Hardy's a model for all the average people in the world to strive and do better, and his "Imag-i-nation" is just a thing in itself. And of course, you can't leave out Edge of this. Yes, Taker gets a bigger pop cuz he's a legend, but right now, Edge has the better gimmick, and gets way more heat from the fans. Edge also has that aura that makes semi-wrestling (half blind, half knowing) want to be him. He's getting Title Reigns every PPV, and will easily surpass Triple H by the time he's done, so really, he rounds out the top 5. Yeah, HBK's also there, but he doesn't make a good reaction like he used to, and although he's my favorite on the roster, because he's the last (along with Kane, Triple H, Bradshaw, and Taker) of the Attitude Roster.    So....    1) RKO  2) Cena (he's starting to lose it, I'm hearing more boos)  3) Triple H (a living legend in WWE, keep in mind, he has BOTH Evolution and DX)  4) Jeff Hardy (The World's Best Not-so-perfect Role Model)  5) TIE: Edge (Rated-R Genius) and HBK ( 5.5)    Honorable Mentions: Undertaker, Batista, CM Punk, Mr. Kennedy, Matt Hardy, Kane, (soon-to-be) Christian, Rey Mysterio.|`|w173betxaa	1.

n2O0NwR6aa	My daughter was a level 8 gymnast, and she went through the same thing.  About a month before cheer tryouts, she decided she wanted to try out.  She made the team with no problem - and so will you.  But it did take some work! There are definitely some things you should start working on, because like any other sport, there are specific skills you'll need to master.    First, about the shyness.  Everyone gets nervous performing alone in front of people, but hey - you're a gymnast!  You've done it a million times!  It's really no different than competiting at a meet.  You learn the cheer, you practice till you've got it, and you go out and show it off.  You're gonna be fine, trust me!    Now, about the tumbling.  Tumbling on a hard floor is a lot easier than you think.  It just takes a little getting used to.  The first time my daughter tried it, she was scared to death.  But she got the hang of it, and tried out with a roundoff  3 back handsprings to a layout.  If she can do it, so can you.  You just need a place to practice.  See if there's a cheer gym nearby (they'll have a non-spring floor) and get a couple private lessons so someone can spot you until you're comfortable.  Then find a gym - at school, a ymca, etc - where you can practice on a basketball court.    Tumbling will be the easy part for you.  Now for the other stuff:    Jumps: There are three main jumps in cheerleading - the toe touch, pike jump, and front hurdler. You can search the web to see what they look like, but it's important to learn them correctly.  The technique is a little different than gymnastics jumps, and it takes some practice to re-learn what you've been taught at gym. Sign up for a cheer class or clinic, or take a couple private lessons, so you can learn the proper technique from an expert. Then go home and practice, practice, practice!    Motions: You'll probably be taught a cheer to perform at tryouts, and you'll be judged on how sharp and tight your motions are. See if you can learn a cheer ahead of time - any cheer, it doesn't matter - and practice at home in front of a mirror. Watch to make sure you're hitting each position precisely, with straight arms and quick, sharp motions.     Dance: You may be taught a dance to perform, in addition to your cheer.  Just think of it as learning the dance parts of a floor routine.  And don't sweat it - even if you're not the greatest dancer, the dance is only one small part of tryouts.  If you think it will help, find a dance teacher who will work with you after you've been taught the dance, so she can give you some specific help on the routine.    Voice Projection: Cheerleaders need to be loud - but not screechy. When you shout your cheer, yell from your diaphram and make your voice deep, sharp and clear. This sounds easy, but it takes some practice to get it right. And when you're jumping around in a cheer and yelling at the same time, it's easy to become breathless and lose your voice!  So start "training" your voice by yelling a chant or cheer while you're doing something active - jumping jacks, jogging in place, etc.     Spiriting: You'll probably be expected to do some spiriting when you try out. That's when you jump around and yell things like "Alright! Let's go Eagles! Fire it up!" while doing some simple arm motions. If you're not used to doing that, it can feel pretty weird... and you might not know exactly what to do or say. So go to a game, watch the cheerleaders, and see what they do. Make a note of some of the things they say, and what they do with their arms. Then go home and practice in front of your mirror. Make up a little "spiriting routine" that you can use at tryouts, so you'll be prepared and know exactly what you're going to do.    Performing to a crowd:  This can be a little freaky for gymnasts, who are used to staring straight ahead into nothing when doing a routine.  Cheerleaders, of course, have to look at the crowd (or judges) and actually make eye contact.  You have to look AT people and smile at them - the whole time you're out there!  If that freaks you out, then just fake it: look at a spot just above the judges' heads, and cheer to some "imaginary" people.  Move your eyes from one spot to another, as if you're working the crowd.    Smile: The number one tip people give for cheer tryouts is to SMILE! Sounds simple enough, but it's easy to forget when you're out there concentrating on your jumps or cheer. So start working on it now. Whenever you practice anything - jumps, cheers, etc - do it with a smile. That way it will become a habit, and you won't have to concentrate on smiling when you're out there in front of the judges.     To get an idea of what the judges are looking for, here's a typical score sheet that many schools use:    Entrance/Smile - 5 pts  Crowd appeal (neat, pleasant appearance) - 5 pts  Spirit (being peppy) - 5 pts  Voice Projection (being loud but not screechy) - 5 pts  Motions (being sharp) - 10 pts  Memory/Recall (ability to learn the cheer) - 10 pts  Jumps (height and technique) - 15 pts  Tumbling (difficulty and form) - 10-15 pts  Dance ability - 5-10 pts  Grades - 10 pts  Citizenship - 20 pts  Total Possible points - 100 pts    I hope this helps some! Good luck!|`|sA6cuDY8aa	well if you practice alot and show your dance moves in front of your family members ... by then you just dont worry about the squad .. im a cheerleader take it from me.. im not much of a dancer myself and they just care if you can do the basic jumps flips and stuff like that .... but the most important thing they look for is that you can have fun...because if  you dont then you wont be that much of a cheerleader in front of crowds.. and good luck:))|`|uEsEVl15aa	r u looking for a competitive team .  [[goes to different states and cheers against other cheerleading teams ?]]  well just email me and tell me exactly what u need .  and for jumps if u strech and practice ur splits everyday u will get it .  and shyness .  well thats a different story .  i have alot of that too .  and its gets me everytime .  but if u stay calm and dont care what ppl say and or think then u will be great and believe in urself .  here is a saying that might be gud to keep in ur mind when u try out .  :: never let the fear of striking out keep u from playing the game::    hope that helps .|`|YMbaFWA2aa	http://cheerlikeumeanit.synthasite.com/|`|3c3a6998da4c577a09bc2789d0d7787caa	First off, you reallllllyyyy need to boost your confidence. Have you noticed that almost all cheerleaders are always confident? It's sort of key. Believe in yourself. The best way to find out what you will need to know and learn it right is through a girl who is already on the team! Really, they know a lot and will most likely be willing to help. Jumps-you will probably need a toe-touch/double toe-touch, r/l hurkey, front hurdler, and pike. You need to be flexible to jump. Work on splits and other stretches everyday. A backhandspring should be good enough but the more tumbling you have, the better your chanes. Dance wise, just try your best and have fun. Show that you have potential. Smile a lot! Good luck.|`|lK6FzBAuaa	jumps    -make sure you get alot of power when you bend down before you do the actual jump  -practice your jumps on a tramp.  (that really helped me!)    CHEER in leading    -if you can't do it by your self and you need a group then, your not confident enough! confidence is everything, just practice your moves in a mirror and you should improve(:      other wise you sound like your a shoe in(:      p.s. remember to smile!

KZsdVGJzaa	yea this game was pathetic the refs clearly through that game and that goal line td by ben was so obviously not over the goal line that the referees should be ashamed that they called that a tough down. i even remember the refs calling holding from nowhere in that game against the seahawks every time they got a big first down. i think this was a pathetic job by these referees and that they should be banned from officiating|`|FmZyN6ORaa	I'm guessing you're talking about Super Bowl XL...  that game was horrible. I'm not one to blame things on refs....but really, how can you argue that the refs didn't give them that win? definitely the worst officiated game I have seen in my life.|`|rDmlKoRQaa	Yes, the officiating was bad and nobody can dispute that fact. Its that simple.    But the human element is part of the game and always will be. Plus, what would ESPN fill its hours of endless coverage of dribble with if they couldn't argue about officiating.    I've also heard something about Anquan Boldin yelling at his offensive coordinator? Did anybody else catch that and could they explain it to me? LOL.|`|IYm9a3SUaa	That was bad officiating but the steelers deserved it.|`|BlgZmV6uaa	For someone that is nuetral I do agree this game looked like it was fixed.I am surprised that the FBI didn't do a invetigation into this because of all the millions of dollars bet on this game leagly and illegaly.|`|2DM7ruAjaa	Steelers won this game fair and square and plus sehawks suck|`|JnYFLsZcaa	Steeler "fans" are delusional.....worst SB of all time........|`|SSrsxhllaa	Did the Steelers cheat when Willie Parker rushed for 75 yards for a Touchdown?
4kdlE54Paa	I agree with you.  Many people have been underestimating the Cardinals defense.  They have led all the teams in the playoff with the most turnovers.  If I am correct, I read that they had 12 from an article.  To me, let the steelers rant all they want.  Underestimating their opponent is what killed it for teams in the playoffs.  Just ask aby Falcon, Panther, or Eagle fan.    Thumbs up to those who agree.|`|ea207ed5b6ef75b8f1362932a6abf174aa	Sorry.  Steelers by a touchdown.  You can take that to the bank.|`|lP9kQmRraa	Defense wins championships|`|ABoo1doVaa	Because it is very difficult for the average NFL fan to wrap their head around "Cardinals, Super Bowl Champs" Even if they win the game, I will have a hard time believing it.|`|KZsdVGJzaa	finally someone agrees with me people who route for the steelers to win this game must have short memory. look at that titans game when ben is pressured all day then he loses the game he had like 2-3 ints and like 3 or 4 fumbles in that game. and like u said that cardinals defense has really stepped up and put tons of pressure on evry single team they played so far in the playoffs. i expect them to win 24-20|`|qxgpXA6kaa	THEY ARE BUT IM ROOTING FOR THE UNDERDOG|`|LTpBVPwcaa	That stuff you have been smoking...and inhaling...is illegal and has made you hallucinate!|`|gR6P6gaMaa	Defense babay defense!|`|UMVWQiYJaa	its actually been pretty split of late, at least on the tube people are starting to realize we are a good team. as a cards fan, i can definitely see us winning this one. we beat em last year pretty handily, its just gonna be a tough matchup for the steelers. sure there defense is good buts lets see what happens when we spread em out a lil bit. warner is actually better under the blitz. im not sayin we will or wont win, but i expect a good game from both sides.|`|Ah5KDMALaa	steelers have more talent|`|xsLWryq7aa	Alright, first of all there offense isnt that good. It should really be called Larry Fittzgerald, since he is there offense. Sure James and Boldin contribute, but Larry pretty much does all the work. And with with James Harrison and Lamar Woodley putin pressure on Kurt Warner you can expect quite alot of those balls to be off target. I have to say Warner being a true vet does work well under presure but hes still human. Plus with Ike and Ryan clark playin deep on Larry the pass would have to be dead on accurate to make a completion. Even though Kurt just lobs it up most of the time anyway (like in the game against Atlanta) and depends on Fittzgerald to make the completion.    Also, I wouldn't count out Pittsburgh's offense. Yea sure there "inconsistant" but they've been dealing with injury problems since week 3. After Willie messed up his knee, and Mendenhall ended his season after trying to truck Ray Lewis, we had to depend on a running back, who in august wasn't even placed on the roster. And with two offensive  linemen out and the recivers going in and out it was hard. But against a healthy Pittburgh team I have no doubts at all.    Steelers Domintate 35-13|`|j8QV4nEMaa	i definitly think arizona will win ,   there defense IS to often forgotten about   and it is not as if the steelers offense is anything that great,   as long as arizona gets the ball to Fitzgerald and there defense plays solid they will win|`|py0DpCh4aa	I never said the Steelers would win.|`|H7AcXAyaaa	Because defense wins championships and the Steelers have the number 1 defense.

ZntcITMIaa	In order to gain mass you should probably do alot of power lifting. This is squats, bench press, shoulder press, curls, cleans, etc. You should try and do upper body mondays and thurs and lower body tuesdays and fridays. Dont work out every day you tear muscle that way. To get faster, plyometrics are great. You should try and contact ur high school now and start lifting and what not. Im about to graduate from high school this spring, we did lifting and running 4x a week in the summer and it defintly helps. As corny as it sounds persistancy is the key. At one point or another you'll plateau, which means you'll reach a point where you don't gain weight and you gotta just mix up ur lifts and keep working harder and eventually you'll break through it. Eat a good diet and drink alota water. When you get to about 16 and u play on the line id recomend small amounts of creatine cause that helps u gain mass but will hurt u alot for speed. Just be persistant, high school football is alot of work but can be very rewarding|`|KZsdVGJzaa	well i personally don't think that u can actually gain speed but u can build some muscle by going to gym and working ur *** off, or if u can't go to the gym then go on ur door hinge and do pull ups, do lot of pushups, u can do some sit ups, o and most importantly stretch. stretching is very important u don't want to deal with hamstring and quad injuries etc|`|WuTGzNVkaa	if you wanna play a skill position then carry around a football play catch with it all the time that's the most important thing right now... start running everyday, find a good workout routine and workout 3-4 times a week and lift hard|`|1XhnEjPeaa	start with 3 sets of 15 sit ups, 3 sets of 10 push ups, 3 sets of 5 pull ups and run one mile(you can do more if u want this is just what my frosh football team said to do before tryouts) then work your way up and you should be good by the time tryouts start. oh and dont be lazy and skip a day you need to do this almost every day because if you skip a day or two its hard to get back on track
p8YC9n2Raa	i live here and sure its hot its been over 40 degrees 4 days straight but it always changes one day it could be freezing, dusty, hot as hell but its not bad maybe because those brits are use to -10 weather|`|z7JsVzcnaa	That's stupid.  Sure, it can get hot there, to say it's too hot is stupid.|`|jLTDqVHsaa	I do agree to an extent; during some parts of the year, it can be excessively hot in parts of Australia, to unsafe levels.  140 degrees on the court is ridiculous.  Now I know that's the ground temperature, and the actual air temperature is not as high, but regardless, that is dangerous heat they've been playing in.  Lives are not risked when it rains at Wimbledon.  Lives ARE risked in that kind of heat.  Perhaps a slightly altered time of year would be more practical?  I don't know.    Now, going and saying Australia's too hot to host international sporting events is ridiculous.  The Sydney Olympics seemed to work quite well; that was in September.    As for insults, don't take that personally, we here in the U.S. get that all the time from just about everyone.
ak44mIy3aa	Ben is almost as good as Warner and look at the stats for the playoffs and tell me who has played better, Ben never had an interception.    I agree with you on the O-line and the RB's    Same for defencive line and Line Backers.    And i am not sure why you mean by criticizingg the CB's if the STEELERS ARE FIRST on pass defence.    Safety's? Only Adrian Wilson is good but what about  Antrel Rolle who is that?    Troy Polamalu is the defencive leader behind James Harrison and Ryan Clark is a monster ( playmaker)    Remember Defences win Championships|`|yxaOg0QDaa	big ben is one of the best qb's when hes pressured, even one of the ravens defensive players warned the cardinals not to rush ben because thats when he gets you    hes one of the best qb's out of the pocket, if not the best, he can finish a play and complete a pass while being tackled, or with defenders waving in his face, or throwing on the run, hes taken more hits than any other qb since he entered the league, yet he gets the job done, thats because he can overcome the pressure    i dont really have any opinion on the running backs, both are mediocre this year and i dont see them getting much done during the game    the o-line for the cardinals IS probably better because like i said, big ben takes a lot of hits, and warner gets more time in his pocket    defense goes to the steelers hands down, for every defensive position, you dont become the number 1 ranked defense in the nfl by having any kind of weaknesses at the position|`|xsLWryq7aa	Alright, first of all there offense isnt that good.

Steelers Domintate 35-13|`|tEW4SjBnaa	Qb's- Big Ben on this one Warner is gonna get blitzed from every direction and will make mistakes. Yes Big Ben does get knocked around a lot but all he needs to do is set up the running game early and the O should score easily.    Rb's- The cards on this one slightly the combo of bouldin and fritz with breaston in the slot should open up holes for the cards rb's with james and hightower having good hands warner can use them in the passing game.    Wr's- Cards pretty easily    O-line- Cards have the type of  o-line the steelers once had it helps when their O-line coach is Rus Grimm (former steelers O-line coach)    D-line STEELERS !    Lb's- STEELERS !    Cb's- It could go both ways for me but in this game I give it slightly to AZ because they don't have to cover bouldin and fritz    Safties- Steelers Polamalu enough said.

AA10161173	It depends on the model of the shifter. Some will work with Shimano derailleurs while others will only work with SRAM derailleurs. If in doubt, you'll have to try it and see what happens or just go ahead and buy the "matching" derailleur also.|`|JSGLKnA4aa	i use sram shift with shimano never had a problem.|`|Cl6KbcAGaa	Yes your friend is correct and since you call him a "super bike Mechanic" then you should listen to him....? You are better off sticking with a grip shifter that is the same make as the rear derailleur since trying to combine Shim. and Sram will not work because of the different gear ratio that each of them manufacture Sram: 1:1 and Shimano is 2:1 on these lower end components. Keep them the same and you will have no problem, or do what you will and who knows?|`|TifUsG4Maa	It is suggested that you use their derailer.BUT,you can use shimano also..I,ve used both,and sram works better.

1jmXT4Vvaa	Aguila .22 super quiet colibri are available from cheaper than dirt.  The round uses no gun powder, only the primer.  Velocity is very low at only 500 fps.  There probably isn't enough oomph to work the slide, so you would have to work the slide after every shot.  These rounds are supposed to be the quietest on the market.|`|U0Rvsabdaa	Yes.

3udSLmgoaa	for our finals in p.e. we had tht too  for the mile, pace yourself and take big strides (not baby steps!) lol  try not to stop cause then you'll need to take more breaths and you'll get tired faster  for push ups, inhale while your going down and exhale while your going up  good luck :))|`|h35tvTR8aa	Well Just Practice At all of your free time|`|Taf5yWUbaa	Push-ups are all about practice..If you can't do one push-ups..You aren't trying.

Gradually build up on your speed as you run along, and remember it's okay to be in the back in the beginning. never start sprinting during the first half of the mile, because you will get worn out, try to save some of your energy for the last 300 meters of the mile. Also, eat a lot of carbs the day before, or even two days before (bread, LOTS of bread and pasta) lol.     for the push ups, i have nothing besides practice your butt off. =X    good luck!|`|NIzZm4b3aa	well for the mile I would suggest running the 1st and last lap and jogging the ones in between. For pull ups pracice makes perfest & try ur hardest.|`|fkqPs9QRaa	for the mile, go a slow pace but jog the full thing, don't try to be a hero and sprint the first lap to be first and tire out for the rest   For the pullups, don't stop to take a break in between them, it only hurts you.|`|C5UUltHtaa	For push ups, (not pull ups lol), I'd start working out with bench pressing. Find a comfortable weight that's not hard to lift and bench press 10 times and increase it each day or each other day. Then add 5 pounds after a week. this will build up the muscles that you need for doing push ups. You don't need to bench press the same amount of weight that you weigh, just work out with what you can lift without straining yourself.    The key to improving your mile run, as I found out, is the jogging work out. I was doing ok (I thought) until a jogged with the star runner. (We were in track) He jogged for a few block (like 1/4 mile or so) then sprinted a few blocks then stopped and jogged in place until I caught up with him. My legs were burning but the main thing is to give it more each time you work out.   When you run the mile, pace yourself to one speed all the way until the very end then go faster just before the finish.  My coach once said long distance runners can improve their time; where as sprinters are pretty much can only run as fast as can the first time. Seems to be some truth to that.  Good luck, hope this helps

3teWTOPqaa	Probably another Jason Williams type of player.|`|BiMkowVMaa	Actually Jay Williams wasn't that good of a player. He was a terrible FT shooter for a point guard (64%) and even worse shooter from the floor 39%. He had the making of bust written all over him and carry on the tradition of Duke players that are bust or injured for most of their careers. So I don't think Jay would be more than an adequate back up point guard. He almost avg a turnover per assist and had a hard time getting use to the speed of the NBA vs. College.    He did have that triple double, but so has Donald Royal... Who? Exactly.|`|PvpbooLXaa	He was a very talented man and he was going to be a multi time all star but that gruesome injury ended his career.

ixKOGishaa	Well grass is the fastest surface in the game and what that means is the ball travels faster on grass courts rather than any other surface. Hard courts and clay are slower with clay being the slowest.Players like Nadal excel in clay courts because they have lots of topspin on their shots.Nadal topspin shots play perfectly on clay because his topspin practically ' grabs' the court making rallies go at different pace so lots of players have a hard time adjusting their game to the pace on clay courts.Also on clay Nadal's weaknesses are diminished.Nadal,being a baseliner often struggle with serve and volley tactics on hard courts because the ball moves so fast that there is no time to react to a fast volley but on clay where the ball moves slower he actually has more time to react therefore perfecting his game on clay.That's why he is the King of Clay.But on hard courts Nadal shots usually jump up high making it easier for experienced players to smash it in but he has surpassed this weakness by flattening out his shots more. Grass being the fastest benefits players who like to serve and volley like federer cause the ball really travels fast on grass courts.|`|fQTOPqruaa	clay courts are better for people like Nadal because heuese a lot of topspin. grass courts are slower because the is more grip and that is why slice is better. hardcourts are the fastest court tehy are designed mostly for flat and hard shots with little topspin and slice. hard courts are faster than grass because there is more gip on grass then there is on hard.|`|2ab86b1d07a4387eb50e37a6fe895233aa	different outcomes  hard court is the ball bounces high and its medium paced  grass court is low bounce and fast paced  clay court is high bounch and slow pace|`|HsVS9Yfzaa	First of all the difference in courts is the way they've been made.   Second of all people play good on different courts. it's what ever they've been playing tennis on.  Hard courts are basically cement with 3 layers of a thin cushion.   It depends if you've been brought up on them.|`|SRF2FiWPaa	-- I played fanatically on clay for about five years ( about 25 years ago ) I was really good if I say so myself. I went into a tennis tournament played on pavement ( covered with that rubberized stuff ) and I got massacred. the balls bounce up faster on a harder surface however if you played all the time on concrete all the time a clay surface expert could turn around and give you a tough time because some times not all the time. but some times to make your hit you have to kind of slide into position if you are moving fast. it is not be deal but just a bit of a knack, would be like playing on a freshly waxed floor wearing your socks. now since the balls bounce off the surface at different speeds if you are a robot like player this will really throw your "timing off" . If you hit a ball with all your strength like I used to well if you are hauling off to whack the ball and the ball is not there yet or is there earlier than you are used to because of the faster bounce,  well it is a learning experience. if you just hit the ball softly back and forth you would probably not notice any difference. but if you are playing a super fast game with you hitting the ball fast and hard and the other person hitting the ball back hard and fast you cannot help but notice a big difference.---- the surfaces make a big difference -- I played another tournament on a hard surface but the rubberized surface was more like plastic ( and super smooth like glass )-- my first game was up against a home boy and this was his home court -- with the ball up a bit I could hit the ball with everything I had and always get it in. --- well this home boy could hit it back but in a neat unique way where his returning ball slid ever so slightly and would only bounce up about 6 to eight inches and I could not hit my super powerful top spin ( the ball didn't bounce up high enough for me to do this ) but had to improvise quickly and my result was a pathetic slicing stroke. --- he simply no how no way would have been able to do that on a surface that was pavement, or on your typical rubberized surface.|`|NPioEHKWaa	Grass - Fast surface. The ball zips across and it doesn't bounce high. It really benefits offensive players.  Clay - The ball travels much slower off the surface and sits up high. A lot of baseline play.  Hard - Fast surface. Perhaps slower than grass but still very beneficial to offensive players.|`|j1BTIYcCaa	Totally different game on all three surfaces.
JV8lgDRCaa	yeah he is good but not a good team. lol|`|KdhNCnEjaa	Al Jefferson is way better than the 3 u have him being traded for combined, plus he is younger|`|rTbKXMMpaa	He is worth much mroe than Marion. This is a monster player on a crappy team. One of the most underrated players int he league. His game is great. Minnesota would be stupid if they did this again. They gave away garnett for nothing before and they better not give away this guy now.|`|lP9kQmRraa	He is a very solid center with a bright future ahead.  He can put up 20 and grab 10 boards each night.  With the addition of Kevin Love, the T-Wolves could have one of the better frontcourts in the NBA over the next couple seasons.      I don't think the Wolves will trade him.  They just signed him to an extension last year.|`|Njom1Wbtaa	Al Jefferson is one of the most consistent player we have today. He can give you 20 plus points and 10 plus rebounds every night. He's like Tim Duncan, though he is not a good shot blocker.     In regarding that Shawn Marion trade, it's so unfair. I mean, Shawn Marion is old, and doesn't put up good numbers every game. Al can give you boost in the paint. I admit Shawn Marion is versatile, but he's not playing a fast pace game right now, unlike when he was on the Suns with Steve Nash.    Al Jeff should be an all-star reserve. The Minnesota right now is 10-2 in 2009. I know that they're not going to make to the playoffs, but Al Jefferson is improving as of now. He will continue to evolve, and I'm pretty sure that the Minnesota will do everything on its power to make him stay.|`|mff1vstNaa	no, not at all. Jefferson is the only reason the KG trade went through. He's going to be the anchor of the wolves. Once Love becomes the starting center, Jefferson will go back to pf and dominate! He's worth more than those three since he's got so much potential. Marion only has a short run value.|`|45e71bc8ca903cd0b9c0e4294eff6f04aa	the trade doesn't make sense and al jefferson is legit.|`|Xbid2OG8aa	i think it would be stupid for minnesota to trade him  he is a great player  young   and he is not done getting better|`|sPPib1TRaa	Being a Celtics fan I was able to watch Al a lot as he progressed into the fantastic player he is today.Yes he is worth it and Minnesota would be stupid to do this.|`|Uyup7lBDaa	that'd be a great trade for Miami, and a horrible trade for Minnesota, Al Jefferson isn't going to lead the talent on minnesota to the playoffs, but he's got a Duncan-esque quality (not saying he's as good as Duncan, but he reminds me alot of duncan when he was younger.)

5PYJYmplaa	its great that you are swimming.    it takes a lot of time to build up endurence. im on a swim team competitvly and swim everyday.  As far as work-outs go, in the beginning of the season we start with doing timed swims.  there is no time for a lap it is just forcing yourself to swim constently for an amout of time around like 10mins working up to like 40 mins.  another good work out is to use a kick board and kick certain laps to buiold up your muscle in your legs.  you can also use a pulbouy, which is a floaty trhat you stick in between your legs, so you work your arms.  another workout can be writing out what you want to accomplish.  give yourself the amount of laps and a time you want to meet (leave time for rest).  this is called a set so for an example: 6 * 100 on a 2:30.  and as far as breathing goes, your lungs need to adjust to the no longer constant supply of oxygen.  i dont know much about asthma but heres what i would do.  when you are swimming laps try to take the least amounts of breaths, breathing every 3rd or 4th stroke instead of every 2nd.  another way once you build up your lung compasitty is kicking off the wall swimming underwater as far as you can.  eventually limit yourself to taking one or two breaths inbetween walls and after practice getting up to taking no breath.    i hope this helps|`|0pOVOziCaa	just try keep doing it and keep going how old are you email me back at vikki.espinoza@yahoo.com|`|1oGBByMIaa	sart runnig

n2O0NwR6aa	I did both.  Gymnastics my freshman and sophomore year, and dance team when I was a junior and senior.  I loved them both, so I know how hard it is to choose!    As someone already said, gymansts do get more respect in some ways.  You can fall off the beam 27 times, and still get your name and picture in the newspaper - because you're an athlete.  It's a lot harder to make the gymnastics team than it is the dance team - so people will respect your ability.  And gymnastics will keep you in awesome shape; the strength, flexibility and coordination you'll develop will give you a huge advantage in any other sport you may try in the future.    Dance, on the other hand, is tons of fun.  It's much less stressful, and less physically demanding.  Dance team is usually much larger than the gymnastics team, so you'll get to meet more people.  And you'll also be more "visible" at school.  Hardly anyone goes to watch a gymnastics meet, but loads of people will see you perform at games and pep rallies.    But here's something to consider.  Let's say you choose gymnastics, and later decide you'd rather do dance.  Your gymnastics will have kept you in great shape, and you'll easily make the dance team.  On the other hand, what if you choose dance now, and then grow tired of it in a year or two.  You'll probably have lost most of your gymnastics skills, and you may not make the team.    So my advice is - if you have the skills to make the gymnastics team, do that now, while you still can.  And if you later get bored with it, you can easily switch over to dance.  That's what I did, and I got to enjoy both.    Good luck with your decision!  =)|`|of049X1waa	You should do gymnastics.  It is more respected as a sport and also it is a lot less common than dance.  If you were trying to get a job as a performer, gymnastics skills would be more valuable than dance and cooler.  Believe me I wish I had stuck with gymnastics--everybody and their mother can dance, while gymnastics is a cool and challenging sport that gives you great talents.    As for the performing alone, that might be scary, but it will get less scary.  It is also a good preparation for life.  When you're an adult, you won't have a team of other girls helping you at work, so it is better to learn to be independant.  Either way you choose, though, good luck!|`|pda0OoXZaa	ok, i had the same thing to choose from. exept its middle school dance team and like yeahh. but i would go with dancing, I did. i fing it a lot more fun and if you competed gymnastics, wow yeahh ik talk about scaryy. and with dancing your in a large group and its less scary. and you have less of a chance of getting hurt! &+ there will prolly be less and not as intence practices! haha.|`|vtR5277laa	i would go with gymnastics- you can be better than everyone else and get more benefits than just being in the front of a formation. Gymnastics is also more of a sport that could pay off in the long run.

CBVlu3Gvaa	I had an  Old timer ( and he would be Reallllly old today) tell me if you are hitting fat your spine angle is off...... I'd be inclined to believe that you may be dipping your back towards the ball on your down swing....Its just a guess....but I've seen a lot of folks that have the same problem doing that a lot.|`|wYGeg0QRaa	There is a difference between a driver swing and an iron swing. An iron swing is steeper than the shallow driver swing. Your troubles could be that you are not playing the ball far enough forward in your stance to get the shallow driver swing set up to work properly. You have been practising your tempo with the medicus and the tempo is pretty much the same with all of your clubs so I doubt if this is a problem for you. Set up with a little wider stance and position the ball up off your left foot to get the feeling that you're going to sweep the ball off of the tee. You'll soon be launching that driver of yours.|`|UdLaFPmZaa	if you swing better with your feet together, then it's definitely your tempo.  I would suggest putting a tee behind your wood when you set up and hitting that tee on the way back just to get some rhythm. or even count 1,2 on the way back then 1,2 on the way down.  good contact with the club is what helps the shot, not how hard you swing.  swinging with your feet together is a great drill to help with tempo, and it sounds like you're on a good path!  good luck!
h7GtCCC7aa	Seriously, I like Hampden when Scotland are playing, it generates a great atmosphere and yeah, I have been to alot worse!    Obviously, I can understand where you are coming from, it isn't great when the stadium isn't packed to the rafters (there was 800 people in it on my last visit!)     If you mean facilities and general cleanliness? Again, it isn't great but far from the worst    Off the top of my head, I have been to...    Old Wembley  Millenium Stadium  Stade de France  Stadium of Light, Portugal (my personal favourite)  Olympic Stadium (Italy and Germany)  Amsterdam Arena (Rab Douglas still gives me nightmares)  Norway, Faroe Islands, South Korea, Iceland to name a few others    Hampden is far from the worst, trust me!    *I have never been to Bradfords ground sadly...|`|CpfFZ9exaa	The pitch condition leves a lot to be desired....when full the atmosphere is great.....but thats not very often is it?!|`|BAlXgworaa	The Olympic Stadium in Rome is a shitehouse, Matty.90,000 CONCRETE SEATS-CRAP ATMOSPHERE-INFLATED PRICES FOR EVERYTHING.Looks far better on the telly than what it is.In fact most Italian stadiums are like this and they make the Coliseum look modern once you're inside them.|`|AA12055870	I have been to a few, but Hampden stands out as among the most soulless single piece of sports architecture to grace our land.

Never would guess that the way people talk though would you? Ill list that below but anyway, its because they claim they are the best fans in the league an they arent.  I live near Pittsburgh an every year you get these fools who go buy Ward jerseys that have NO idea about the NFL, yet they go to the games an everyone says "wow look at those fans, they are great, they follow the team all over".  Yea thats correct, they are FOLLOWERS, not fans.  I live here, I see it!  I was at the DRs office a months ago, this guy in a Steelers hat walks in.  A guy across from me says to the guy "hey who do the Steelers play this week?"  The guy with the Steelers hat on had no idea.  I had to tell them "they play the Chargers".  Im a Cowboys fan!   Thats one reason, plus, they come on here an scream that ridiculous song, here we go.  Ok, we get it.  They play that every single year in all the stores where I live starting in week 1.   So basically every year since Ive been alive, I have gone into stores hearing that ridiculous song and how they are going to go to the Super Bowl EVERY year.  Um, they have won how many in the last 30 years?  1?  They actually didnt even win the one against Seattle in my and millions of other peoples opinions, but I wont get into that.  Another reason......the fans dont give one ounce of credit to any other team in the league.  Real fans give credit where its due.  To sum it all up, dont jump on the wagons, dont sing that ridiculous song an throw it in peoples faces that you have won Super Bowls, and learn the game and atleast know who your playing on Sunday.  Like I said, I live here. Pittsburgh fans are NOT the best fans in the NFL.  To prove my point about what I said in this post, look at the first reply you got to this question.  That pretty much sums up one of the points I made.  Also, the statement was made they dont cheat to win.  That may be correct.  The officials do that for them.  Here is further proof of this in the Super Bowl against Seattle.  Ill list the information below.  Now what REAL fan is gonna say that game was officiated correctly?  There was absolute outrage from all the major networks and sports writers the next day, yet Steeler fans tell everyone to "quit crying" and to "get over it".  Thats real classy ha.  Here is some proof and Ill also provide a link or 2 with some information about Steroids use of the Steelers in the 70s.  That goes highly ignored as well.  Can you even imagine if that was the Cowboys though?  It would be all over the place.    Shortly after the game, Kansas City Star writer Jason Whitlock encapsulated many views when he wrote the day after the game, "Bill Leavy and his crew ruined Super Bowl XL. Am I the only one who would like to hear them defend their incompetence?"    Initially, fans reacted negatively as well. A February 7 online ESPN poll found that, with 103,167 votes cast, 61.7% of voters felt that "officiating mistakes affected the outcome of Super Bowl XL."[2]    Seahawks coach Mike Holmgren himself took issue with the officiating at a celebration for his team on February 6 at Qwest Field, saying, "We knew it was going to be tough going against the Pittsburgh Steelers. I didn't know we were going to have to play the guys in the striped shirts as well.        Calls against the Seahawks    The following is a list of the most oft-criticized calls that went against the Seahawks:    * First Quarter, 2:08 left, score tied 0-0: Seattle quarterback Matt Hasselbeck threw a 16-yard pass that wide receiver Darrell Jackson caught in the end zone, but the play was called back on an offensive pass interference call. Back Judge Bob Waggoner, a Pittsburgh native[7], flagged Jackson for pushing off Steelers safety Chris Hope. Seattle had to settle for a Josh Brown field goal. Critics claimed both Jackson and the defensive player were jostling for position and that officials should not have flagged either player. Michael Smith of ESPN wrote that "Jackson extended his arm, yes, but both players were fighting for position, and he didn't create any separation by doing so."[8] Adding to the controversy was the fact that Waggoner's flag was thrown several seconds after the play ended, which some saw as proof that Hope had lobbied for the call[9].    * Second Quarter, 2:00 left, Seahawks lead 3-0: On third down from the Seattle one-yard line, Pittsburgh quarterback Ben Roethlisberger took the snap, faked a handoff, and dove toward the left side of a pile along the goal-line before being hit by Seahawks linebacker D.D. Lewis. He then extended his arm that was holding the ball to the goal line, though it is unclear as to whether the extension was before or after he was officially down. After first raising one hand (as if to indicate that the quarterback was down), head linesman Mark Hittner raised a second arm to signal a touchdown. The play stood after review, to the considerable ire of Seahawks coach Mike Holmgren, who berated Leavy on the way to the locker room following the first half.[10] The play was hotly debated in the media between those who thought the play should have resulted in a fourth-down-and-inches situation[11] and those who thought the ball crossed the goal line.[12] Roethlisberger appeared on the The Late Show with David Letterman the day after the game and told the host that, immediately after the play, he had told Cowher, "I dont think I got in," but that the team was "ready to go for it on fourth down anyway."[13] He later explained that he was referring to his initial impression only, and believes "the ball crossed the plane."[14]    * Fourth Quarter, 12:35 left, Steelers lead 14-10: Hasselbeck completed an 18-yard pass to tight end Jerramy Stevens at the Steelers 1-yard line. The play was nullified by a penalty against Seattle right tackle Se|`|809ab083a593088984facf46e1b5fcf9aa	Because they dominate the AFC.

The more a team beats another team, and the more successful a team becomes, the more haters that follow.    Every game the Patriots won last yewar, the more fans wanted the the lose the next.    I'm a Colts fan. 3 years ago, i didn't have hate or love for Chargers. But they beat us in that 13-0 season. They beat us in the reg season last year, Cromartie got 5 picks.They beat us in the Playoffs last year. They beat us this year in the playoffs.    The Chargers are as big of a rival to me now as the Patriots.|`|q6NGxNR3aa	I really cant stand the steelers for many reasons like how their fans are always saying their the proudest team in the nfl what makes them so great and what about the other teams their all proud franchises even the lions !

There are a lot of new bandwagon fans, so most NFL fans who've been here the entire season hate these new idiots.     Also its probably Cowgirl fans too with a lot of the hate. THey listen to the media and think its their rite to be in the Super Bowl even tho they have an average team with a lot of cancer on it.    Im I giant fan, but I respect the Steelers. Mostly people probably hate on them cuz they always put together a winning team. When they don't have a good season its usually because of a lot of injuries.|`|6YeexwvAaa	I think teams are hated once they become habitual winners. Perfect example, being from Indy, a lot of people here hate the Pats (because they've beaten us a bit), Pittsburgh, or San Diego.

See - Yankees, Spurs, etc.|`|TiOXmXbsaa	idk its something you grow to do, i mean like i used to like the seahawks, and they played in the super bowl, they beat them( bad), and going for the other team i argued on some calls, like the p[lay where the qb i forgot his name "the said scored" he had the ball behind the line and moved it but anyways, i think some people dont hate them, some are fans, but they have beating popular teams that many people liked and now they want the other team to win for "revenage" so it will seem more fair|`|Yvn6uJC0aa	i hate the steelers, but there an awsome team. i mostly hate them because alot of people bandwagon on to there team because there basically in the playoff hunt every year. its basically like the yankee's on football.|`|LTpBVPwcaa	Because they are jealous a team with good players, without generally all the showboating of the Cryboys, all the arrogance of the Pats, not to mention they don't cheat to win.

So many reasons, and I admit not all of them are rational.  It could be everything from jealously to geographical location to not liking the color of their uniforms.    It's a reflection on people, not necessarily on your team.  Our favorite song is despised by some people.  Some people can't stand our favorite food.  Even the people on earth we esteem the most are hated by someone.    So why should we be surprised when some people hate our favorite team, in spite of all the reasons we think they are great?  Don't waste time trying to figure it all out.  You can't.  Just accept it and carry on.|`|ga4ZWsuZaa	Becoz your fans are @*o!*S

rDmlKoRQaa	Larry Fitzgerald.    Hines Ward's best season was 1,329 yards and 12 touchdowns. Hines has only broken the 1300 yard barrier once, and has had five 1,000 yard seasons in his career.     In his 5 years in the NFL, Larry Fitzgerald has broken 1,400 yards three separate times and had 10 TD's in three times. Anyone who thinks Larry Fitzgerald is "just coming into his own" is an idiot. The only reason he hasn't gotten attention is playing for the Arizona Cardinals. He would have had four consecutive 1,000 yard seasons if not for an injury costing him three games (ended with 976 yds). All of this while splitting stats with another pro bowl receiver.    Granted, Hines Ward will record a few highlight reel hits each season, but in reality none of those hits are game changing evens. They tend to be backside blocks on unsuspecting defenders (great hits nonetheless).|`|qXlBsRLgaa	ward|`|Ah5KDMALaa	ward|`|2DM7ruAjaa	here is a breakdown of these two receivers.  http://www.nfl.com/stats/headtohead?play...

Also, there is no such thing as salary caps or transfer ceilings in English football so the rich keep getting richer, the cycle never ends. Man U are a collossus, its very had to break that cycle.

Anyways My grandparents owned 4 acres of lands in the woods in northern Cal. I spent alot of time there growing up. at least once a month and in the summer I was up there pretty much the whole time. And I started off on a bb gun shooting targets then I started shooting birds and squirrels...I stopped that after my grandpa said the next animal you shoot your eatin it and I didnt feel like eaten squirrel so I stopped. Then when I was 10 I got a .22 rifle for my birthday and was just target shooting. Then I got a shotgun when I was 13 and I did pheasant hunting.   I got into it because It runs in my dad's side of the family. My grandpa was raised that way he passed it on down to my dad and my dad passed it on to me.

If you really want to go to WVU, I would look at that one first. Personally, my next two choices would be Illinois because this is a school that likes quickness and athleticism. My third choice would be Texas A&M because they are a traditional football power coming off a very bad year. Perhaps now might be the time to look into this.

7Ek9YkUhaa	West Coast were equal 16th at the time, Adelaide were 4th. If it was at AMMI it may have been a different story, we have a terrible record there against both Crows and Port, something like 7 wins - 18 loses.    It would have been our worst losing steak in our history, if the boys hadn't have won. I also think indigenous round for Wirras 250th game, made the boys pull together.    I just hate that our bogey team has been Fremantle lately.    EDIT: Blabatha, it was 76 points not 90+.|`|cklqarifaa	I think the crows style of football doesn't match well with that of the eagles, and its because of this they get beaten by them. The crows like running of the half back and hitting up targets through the midfield and up forward with lots of short kicks and hand balls. Perhaps the eagles play a similar style or a style which allows them to close down adelaides run. Sadly i cant remember how the eagles played their football because i didnt see many of their games because they didnt have a flash year and also because the season finished so long ago. Not long now though. Many teams have their bogey teams where their game plan doesnt work against the game plan of another team, and the eagles seem to have the crows number for now.|`|92MSZ54Naa	Yes I agree that the crows lose to WCE all the time.

I cant really complain about the crows loosing to west coast, its what got us into the 2006 grand final.

5573832243a1d5e3f002d23bed5be490aa	you know it all really depends on the pitcher! I have never seen any that can reach the high school pitching speed but I have seen some pretty fast one for their age! Be prepared to jump out of the way because at this age they usually don't have much control over the ball and it is usually all over the place! I hate umping this age group, because you never know what you are going to get! HAHA|`|s4VzPulYaa	The normal speed is about 40 mph, or at least that is how fast my team pitchers pitched. We did come up against pitchers that threw harder though, it just depends on the level of the pitcher, some of them are more advanced than others, and some of them have catching up to do, it just depends on who you play. I am in 16u now, but I don't remember getting pegged with a ball when I was in 12u, maybe it hit me in the head, and now I can remember lol, but yeah, seiously be ready, because at 12 the pitchers are'nt exacly perfectly in the strike zone.|`|cfn8mYF6aa	not very fast. and they are usually out of control.|`|z1mTn6NMaa	It will vary a bit but it is usually but in my experience, it is mostly between 40 and 50 mph.

xQFWjFyZaa	He is what is considered a system Quarterback which basically means he played in an offense(usually the Spread), which is a pass oriented formation that utilizes as many receivers as possible. These types of systems are well known for taking players with average talent, and producing outstanding stats. Unfortunately, the NFL doesn't use these types of systems often, so it exposes the flaws of the QB. Some of the colleges that use the spread as their main formation are Texas Tech, BYU, and Hawaii. Colt Brennan was considered a system QB coming out of college, which is why he went late.    Some other knocks on Harrell are his arm strength and mobility.|`|287ryVgFaa	Because he sucks and won't make it in the NFL, especially after an awful senior bowl...|`|b3qm4ZgFaa	This is coming from a die hard Tech fan since birth, but I'll be honest with you. First of all, it needs to be said that Tech doesnt get anywhere close the same recruits out of high school, so these quarterbacks are good, but they dont necessarily have the best arm strength or accuracy in the nation. Harrell, system or not, should've at least been invited to the Heisman ceremony, but as far as the NFL, he probably will be a back up his entire career. Why? Mike Leach has an amazing offense that can utilize a lack of talent with a spread offense and usually quick open field passes. The shotgun is what Harrell did 90% of the time for 4 years at Tech and the switch to a nearly 90% under the center offense is a near impossible adjustment for these guys. People will trash him and Tech but honestly he was recruited for a certain style of offense and only that. If he couldve put those numbers up from under center, he would have never been to Tech. He wouldve been at USC or some school with a more pro style set. Take Tebow for example. He could win the Heisman twice, with 2 National titles and he still might not be a quarterback. Theres a definite line between great in college and great in the NFL. I hope Harrell can prove me wrong, however....Wreck Em.
4d7b908cfe24bf3f1177a5cca13feb22aa	Outside of either Marga-cheat-o or one of his trainers admitting to it, there will never be conclusive proof of it.    HOWEVER:      I believe that there is some circumstancial evidence that implies as much.     1:  Mosley vs Marga-cheat-o is the only fight in which we are 100% certain that Marga-cheat-o didn't have his wraps loaded with plaster.  It's also the only fight in which Marga-cheat-o's opponent didn't wear down.  It was the worst fight of his career, and, once having been considered the most durable fighter in all of boxing, was KO'd by a blown-up lightweight.     2:  Cotto's face blew up in a way that, while plausible, seemed uncharacteristic for him.  There has been cut-prone fighters in the past that would blow up like that, but Cotto has never done so in the past.  And he did fight Mosely, the same guy that demolished Marga-cheat-o.     3:  Plaster takes time to harden.  I think it's likely that it took Marga-cheat-o's plaster-soaked wraps a good 6 rounds to harden.  Against both Cotto and Paul Williams, Marga-cheat-o surged after round 6.  There was another fight in which Marga-cheat-o was being outboxed against an African fighter (i think), in which the fight had to be stopped due to a freaky cut.  I believe these 3 fights infer that Margo-cheat-o's hands become harder once the plaster sets.     4:  Cotto's behavior.  It's very subjective, but I imagine a fight between a guy wearing 10 oz gloves, and a bare fisted fighter would be very similar.  Cotto simply couldn't find a way to land good shots without paying dearly.  He didn't know what to do, so he tried to reduce the amount of actual fighting with some rather useless side to side movement.  The fact that Cotto quit tells me that he was hurt rather than debilitated.  He had his wits about himself, but he just couldn't handle the pain.  I think that this could be a sign of getting hit with plastered hands rather than a typical hand.  I once sparred an opponent that used 18 oz gloves while I used 16 oz gloves.  I was able to stay in there while the opponent couldn't trade.  It was a very obvious advantage that we didn't realize until we started sparring.  My opponent's behavior was similar to Cotto's.       5: comparative study using similar opponents.  Both Mosley and Margarito fought Cotto.    Mosley and Cotto was mostly a draw.  Cotto and Marga-cheat-o was a wipeout after 6 rounds.  Given that Cotto and Mosley were similar in talent, then both fighters should turn in generally similar performances, meaning close decisions all around.  Mosley blasted Marga-cheat-o.      The difference maker is that Marga-cheat-o didn't have his hardened plaster "kicking in" for him against Mosley like it did against Cotto and Williams.  It explains why he was such a great late-rounds/attrition fighter.|`|I9Y6fxguaa	This will bring boxing down a notch. We have to wait for the results somewhere Feb 10. Investigation is ongoing now. But if hardening matter was in the gauze then Margo and trainer should be banned from Boxing. And perhaps law suits left and right from previous boxers follow up. Especially from Cotto, his face was badly batter.       One fact to point out here is every boxer gets assigned a person from the boxing commission as neutral observant. from the time the boxer steps into the locker room all the way till the final glove is done.  This person assures the proper bandage is placed and no illegal matter is inserted in the gloves.|`|kqP7GwOcaa	I have to grudgingly admit, ElmerFuddstein has pretty much given a flawless answer, and whether you believe the best or worst of Margarito, you cannot argue with Elmer's deductive reasoning,  GREAT answer Elmer, thumbs up.|`|KmzjSnzVaa	Go on to www.eastsideboxing.com there it is clearly discussed. Before we make random accusations we need to have all the facts. The website is currently talking about this. I hope the article clarifies this for you.    http://www.eastsideboxing.com/news.php?p...|`|zr2W7mEWaa	Ofcourse he did but Mexican people will always deny it -_-|`|3d5e83a836ea34fd00d8fe38ccc011a4aa	Great answer Elmer.  I like how you really took your time typing all that.  I just want to add that I watched the Cotto fight again and noticed in just round 2, Cotto's nose was dripping blood and his face was all bruised up.  Remember Cotto was still doing well in the earlier rounds.  After Mosley fought Margo for 8 1/2 rounds, his face looked untouched.  I think to say this is the first time Margo tried to do this is kinda naive, don't you think?  Why with Shane, when Margo is expected to win 4:1?  Doesn't it make sense for him to try to do this to Cotto since he(Margo) was the underdog.  I think only the hardcore Margo fans deny this. I myself is a fan but cheating is just wrong.  Boxers have families, they have to be there for their kids.  The risk you put them through by cheating is extremely selfish and not excusable.|`|NSgSaspAaa	If he used this type of padding against Mosley, he probably used it against Cotto and probably other fights as well. No one can prove it, but my guess is he probably did.|`|Yg1QR4mmaa	I just watched Bloodboxings new video on youtube, and he was saying a lot of things that make sense and I think that everyone should check it out. You don't know all the facts, so don't start trying to tear this man down. With all of the rat bastards in boxing today they just might of wanted an excuse to discredit Margarito win or lose. It is not like the higher ups wanted him to win against Cotto, so they want to make it seem like he cheated. He is not as marketable as Cotto stylistically and he doesn't have the mainstream audiences attention like Cotto. When Margarito beat Cotto, he took away a huge payday for everyone in boxing, because a fight with Mayweather was finally starting to get on the horizon. If they find a way to prove this is right, the loss could be erased and the fight could still happen. All I am saying is in boxing you will never find a clear angle in the controversey. Blood put it best when he said "It is not guilty until proven innocent, it is innocent until proven guilty."|`|KdhNCnEjaa	I must say so, they found plaster, thats horrible, he shud be suspended for a while. If it wasnt professional boxing, if you pack your gloves you get beaten to within an inch of your life|`|pqholNyqaa	I truly think that he did cheat!  I'm pretty sure it has something to do with the hard, and illegal substance that was found inside his gloves.    I am a fan of Miguel Cotto & I really couldn't believe that Margarito beat him. I guess the fight of margarito vs. mosley comes to show that margarito did cheat.     It irritates me so i'm hoping for a rematch so my boy Cotto can show the "tijuana tornado" what it takes to win . . . without cheating.|`|a112fa2d0ccf1099eec1119d4da5e902aa	That could be one of the subjects of investigation.

AA10304847	The Cardinal defense can stand up to the Steeler offense, the question though is can the Steeler scary defense shut down the impressive Card receivers?     The Cards have several edges in this game, not only was Whisenhunt the Steelers tight end coach from 2001-2003 and offensive coordinator from 2004-2006, but Russ Grimm was the Steeler assistant head coach/offensive line coach, Mike Miller the receivers coach , Matt Raich a defensive assistant and Kevin Spencer the Special Teams coach. Talk about knowing your enemy. They know the strengths and weaknesses of alot of the Steeler players. Of course Tomlin knows this, but even so, it's making a Cardinal bet looking mighty good. Whisenhunt should be able to get in Roethlisberger's head to devise a scheme to minimize Hines Ward's impact (assuming he's able to play at 100%).    Consider this: Pittsburgh has played 2 of the top 7 passing teams this season in Indy and Houston and given up an average of over 20 points per game. Both were home games for Pittsburgh where their defense is off the charts, and more importantly, Arizona passes for close to 30 pts per game more than either. For these reasons, i'm leaning on the CARDs to pull it off.     The "us against the world" mentality is the other big edge for the CARDS, used to win the last 3 playoff games.....|`|AA11108627	Please.

MjMkPi0yaa	If I were you, I would reject the Bargani trade first. Since you need assists and not rebounds.

Hope it helped!  Good Luck!!!!!

kjAsuC6Haa	Elliott Sadler. As some people have already mentioned, he can hunt, so he can bring in food and prepare it. He's big and strong and used to play sports, so he'd do well in the physical challenges. He's likable, so he could play the social game well. And I can totally see him eating bugs.    Carl Edwards would be great too, for many of the same reasons. I don't think he hunts, but he's the type of guy that excels at everything he does, so he'd probably master fishing quickly enough. I don't think he'd do as well at the social side as Elliott would, though. Carl's the type that would be labeled a threat immediately. I think he's more of an individualist than a team player. Elliott's kind of the funny laidback Big Tom type that everybody likes, who slides under the radar until the end.|`|88uIjItaaa	Stanton Barrett - Stuntman...

9QiNFjHUaa	Never gonna happen - Border was a leader who did whatever it took to get the best out of his players.  Same with Steve Waugh.

Ricky doesn't have that going for him.|`|wPlfPc0gaa	Too late, mate. Ponting is closer to the *** end of his cricketing career. He does not have the time start it all anew.  Ponting was handed over a very good team by Steve Waugh, and never had to worry about building a team. Now that the cornerstones of the team have been removed, the team looks shaky.  How long will Ponting play? 2 years? 3 years?

Hardy feud, they want to make things interesting.
UrNVuFx6aa	Just my personal opinion, but I would go with something like a .243 Win. round. These are plenty powerful for all except the largest whitetail deer, accurate enough for longer distances (should such become necessary) and available in a variety of rifles from bolt action to semi-auto. They can also be used on sheep and goat. Unfortunately, all firearms make noise (unless suppressed, which is illegal) so you will need to decide how much noise is too much for you. Wear hearing protection and eye protection when you shoot. These also have a fairly light recoil, which some new shooters find more comfortable.  Ammunition is readily available and fairly inexpensive. With a good scope on top you can shoot accurately out to 450 yards, probably farther with sufficient practice. Regardless of what weapon you end up with, practice is very important if you want to be proficient. And always, practice safe firearm handling, for the safety of yourself and others.|`|njRjM0PMaa	22-.250|`|U0Rvsabdaa	I can't help quiet. Rifles are loud, but better for deer. A handgun would put down goats well, but I wouldn't want to take a deer with a pistol. So you see the dilemma?    Maybe a .223 rifle would work.|`|Z8UV6S3baa	Well, if you are looking for a gun to do this, the classic would be a lever action in .30 - 30. 30-30 being the caliber, and the lever action being a type of rifle. Generally, not too expensive, Winchester, Browning, Marlin and others make them.    However, they aren't particularly quiet.     If what you want is quiet and you are looking at shorter ranges, and have a ton of money to spend, try a Swivel Machine Works, pneumatic powered crossbow. Definately generating enough energy to kill goats, deer, and sheep out to 50 or 60 yards. Since the are pneumatic, they don't generate alot of noise. Alternately you can get their version that runs off of .22 blanks which are louder, but much softer than a .30-30.    Or you could look into a crossbow, although in some locales they are illegal to hunt with.    Or you could live with loud.    Thinkingblade|`|hphqiBEuaa	12 gauge 870 shotgun. Not really quiet but very versatile.|`|HdJpc3QDaa	I'm going to agree with the shotgun. If the deer is close and not a distance shot. A Remington 870 Magnum express in 3 1/2" is the most versatile gun on the market. You can hunt anything from doves with  6 shot to a Black bear with a slug.|`|Vakup5Jvaa	Well you have a goat they weigh what? 75 pounds and a whitetail deer they can run 180pounds. So you want one gun for both?     A 12GA shotgun with a slug would be perfect to drop a deer, but it's a bit much for goats. The shotgun also does not have the loud CRACK of a rifle.|`|Ucbnl7VJaa	For putting down sheep and goats a .22 rifle works great. Still loud enough for anyone inside a quarter mile to know a shot has been fired though and you should still wear hearing protection. Just do it from above and behind so you can put it into the base of the brain and they fall down dead. From the front it's a easy miss and a slow death, trust me my friend made that mistake.   For taking deer you will need something with more punch. I'd recommend something like a .30-30 Win.,  7mm-08 Rem. or .257 Roberts. All have plenty of power with light recoil and they don't rattle windows a mile away when you touch em off.|`|rWYp4ekeaa	get a 30-30 win,  some people call it the queit gun

dSagTE1qaa	The blades do have glue on them but I have never had much luck with not adding more glue.  I have a heat gun and I went to Wal-Mart in the crafts section and brought some hot glue sticks and I use that glue and the heat gun to put more glue on the blade buttend and then heat up the shaft and insert the blade.  The acces glue will squeeze out but do not take it all off make sure you use a toothpick or something to smooth it around were the shaft stops and the blade starts to fill the gap then take the access off.  Then after the glue cools off use some sports tape and tape up the shaft about an 1/8 of an inch and down on to the blade about an 1/8 of an ich.|`|JpDs6R9jaa	the blades you get to replace them shoudl have glue on them already
hphqiBEuaa	If in the USA    Buy a gun registered to the ATF before 1986 they are a lot of money cause there aren't that many left. Wait at least two months til the paperwork clears and pick it up at your dealer. Make sure they are legal in your state. If you can legally own a rifle you can own a sub machine gun after paying the 200 dollar tax stamp.  Usually they are ten times the actual retail price if you could go to manufactuer and buy one directly from them.    Become a cop and have your department issue you one. You have to return it upon your retirement or when you leave that agency for whatever reason.    Get a FFL license and  become a legal dealer or a manufactuer. If you become a manufactuer you can make submachine guns at will. If you become a dealer you need to get a law enforcement agency to sign a letter saying that you need to own a certain gun so you can demonstrate it to them. You can keep these guns in your possession until you close your business or loose your FFL.    The cheapest way is to find a NFA dealer and do it as a civilian.|`|yaq7oaH6aa	Yes. There's a special certificate and background check, and   an extra fee involved.|`|xcG5Tasiaa	Yes, in most states.     You require a Class III firearms license,  a background check(of course), and a $200 tax stamp.     You also have to find someone willing to part with theirs. Expect to pay about $20,000 (I'm not joking) for say, an MP-5.     Additionally, no fully-automatic firearms have been allowed for manufacture or import for private owners since 1986, so you WILL be getting a rather old piece.     Thankfully, most of the ones in use are well-maintained.|`|pH9HEmixaa	Legally... No    But Hell, Who Needs A Legal one Anyway???|`|EHP5yo0Raa	Sure. You need to acquire a class three gun permit. Terms and regulations do vary once you have one. For example, It's perfectly acceptable to fire off fully automatic weapons at Machine Gun Shows once you have a class three permit. Or if you're supervised from someone who has one and a federal stamp.|`|Vakup5Jvaa	Ownership of automatic weapons requires a Federal Tax Stamp and federal registration.|`|3e8e34aadabc9c4673b05bc7f3e997a0aa	Yes. Most states in the US allow it and it's not against federal law, but it requires permission. Many of the members of my gun club have full auto weapons and they have one day a month reserved just for them. Texas, by the way.|`|CFm0u13Paa	This is governed by state law. Some states allow them, some do not.     If it is legal in your state you will have some federal paperwork to do but if you can legally own any other type of firearm then federal law will allow you to own machine guns. You'll have to pay a $200 transfer tax to the feds plus whatever fees your state charges.     Machine guns are a lot of fun but they are very expensive to feed! I have chewed through $20 worth of ammo in less than a minute!

tgLrOd0Raa	I know that I'm not using the most reliable source, but if you look at their records on Wikipedia it appears that although Hoad may have been as naturally a talented player as both Rosewall and Laver he was not as interested.    He also had back problems that, most likely together with his disinterest, caused him to retire much earlier than Rosewall and Laver.  As a result he didn't win as many major titles.    So the combination of fewer titles and a shorter time on tour has meant he has a smaller profile.|`|0UBvTITIaa	On his best day Hoad was as good as any of them.When he and Rosewall were at their peak as amateurs in 1956,Hoad won 3 out of 4 Grand Slams,with Ken beating him in U.S. final.

I'm out there some days in -20 Celsius weather and I'm not training for a marathon--and yes a face scarf will work wonders for you as well as a hat.

The Cards have several edges in this game, not only was Whisenhunt the Steelers tight end coach from 2001-2003 and offensive coordinator from 2004-2006, but Russ Grimm was the Steeler assistant head coach/offensive line coach, Mike Miller the receivers coach , Matt Raich a defensive assistant and Kevin Spencer the Special Teams coach. Talk about knowing your enemy. They know the strengths and weaknesses of alot of the Steeler players. Of course Tomlin knows this, but even so, it's making a Cardinal bet looking mighty good. Whisenhunt should be able to get in Roethlisberger's head to devise a scheme to minimize Hines Ward's impact (assuming he's able to play at 100%).    Consider this: Pittsburgh has played 2 of the top 7 passing teams this season in Indy and Houston and given up an average of over 20 points per game. Both were home games for Pittsburgh where their defense is off the charts, and more importantly, Arizona passes for close to 30 pts per game more than either. For these reasons, i'm leaning on the CARDs to pull it off.     The "us against the world" mentality is the other big edge for the CARDS, used to win the last 3 playoff games.....

Hockey skates have no toe picks and will encourage you to lean forward, which is considered a very bad habit in figure skating since you have toe picks on figure skates and need to be upright and centered.  I suggest that you go to a rink and rent (ask for their best pair) hockey skates and try them.  Also, you can usually get better quality skates for your money if you buy them used.

She//he is a specialized defensive player. They go in for a back row player that may not be very good a passing.  The libero is allowed to serve and is not allowed to attack the ball.  They may jump and hit the ball, but only if it is behind the 10 foot line.    As for the rules, they are practically the same as other volleyball rules(excluding beach volleyball). The only difference is that you get 8 seconds to serve in club volleyball but only 5 seconds to serve in highschool.|`|0OsqCShHaa	every thing that they already told u is good but u shouldnt worry they'll teach u at tryouts=] trust me.?|`|RnkOEzGuaa	Great you want to play volleyball! I was introduced to the sport in PE as well and tried out for my high school team and that was the beginning of my story. I'm now a college freshman playing ball at a high D2 school so not too many rules have changed in a year.    The one player that is wearing a different colored shirt is called the libero. They are defensive specialist and play only in the back row and can only serve for one person but can go in for anyone in the back row, they can never go in the front.    What you want to do is learn the basic steps such as the spike approach, block approach, and transitioning side to side/backwards. After that you should start hitting against the wall. Throw the ball with two hands in front of you and reach high to hit the ball, snap your wrist and follow through. Try to continue the repetition until you mess up, helps the foot movement.    For setting just set against the wall. Your head should be like a foot away, hands above your head and just start setting quick little sets to yourself. This will help you warm up and know where to put your hands. As for passing, that's a little more difficult to do by yourself. You should find a friend who plays a bit and start peppering with them. Peppering is just bump, set, spike to each other over and over again.    Rules: There are a ton so I won't get into detail. Main rules are don't touch the net. Don't step over the line when you are serving. Don't carry the ball when bumping or setting. You are allowed to use your head and feet to play the ball. Don't reach over the net when the ball is still on the other teams side, they'll call you for that. Don't cross the bottom plane of the net, they'll call you if your risking another players body. Three hits per side. You only get one chance to serve. If the ball lands on the line then its in.

He had health issues last year and seemed to have finally recaptured his form against Del Potro.

He will win slams again, even if it's not this time at AO. Unquestionably, Federer played superbly against Del Potro. He's possibly the soon-to-be no.1 greatest legend of all time if he keeps his winnings on.  For Nadal-Verdasco match, I think Nadal would win in a very tested high quality match. They have played 5 times on ATP tour main draw before with Nadal winnning all of them. This time, it's rather going to be a surprise for Nadal to face a brand new fighting Verdasco. I'm going for both the Spaniard equally. Even if Nadal does't win this slam now, he will do that in coming years - he's young and fiery.|`|B8Gwxo1laa	Federer is not done.

Day 1 - (ARMS & BACK)  Curls (Hammer or Normal)  Bench Press (Flat or Incline)  AB Lounge  Dead Lift  Clean & Jerk  Row Machine  Bent Weight Lift ups (Bend over to a 90* angle , and lift the Dumbbells up while retaining the 90* angle)  AB Roller      Day 2 - (LEGS & CARDIO)  Squats  Treadmill  Leg Press  Lunges  AB Roller    Reapeat - D1 , D2 , D1 , D2 , etc......    Just Remember , Every 2 weeks , Add about 10-20 Reps. onto what you've been doing , and switch between the Motions of Curls & Benchpress.  ie - Normal Curl to Hammer Curl  Flat Bench to Incline Bench      *EDIT* - The only thing anyone above me has Stated Correctly is that you need to get A LOT of protein in you Diet.  Make sure you get a good 20-40g protein after a Strenuos workout.  Get Carbs , but not a HUGE amount.  And try to limit the Fat intake.    Most Impotantly - Have the desire to Succeed.|`|7f2GSDmqaa	Eat healthy, lift weights|`|poPtRqouaa	Start eating 90% healthy. Vitamins and all that good stuff to gain their physic and be well over 200lbs of 4-6% body fat.    You'll need acting classes, and their wrestling isn't like high school wrestling. As you can tell by Kurt Angle.    Get yourself a trainer. dedicate your life to it and you might have a chance. Don't do anything stupid and illegal with your life|`|h8dHAhxCaa	I would really suggest either moving to Tampa, Florida for FCW or go to OVW in i Kentucky.  For training I would do a lot of cardio and muscle building.  In other words GET RIPPED!!!|`|vTalY5Skaa	http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OcfUxF4J2... THIS IS HEEL HEAT IF YOU WANNA BE A HEEL WATCH THIS PRETTY D@MN FUNNY THOUGH(WATCH THE WORDS IN THE BOTTOM) SORRY FOR CAPS LOCK!|`|8tSbcUj9aa	Well for starters, if you aren't already, you should get in shape and gain weight.  Eat meat with every meal, and drink as much Milk (protein) as you can.  I would recommend an Iron Gym for home, and I also recommend that you  go to a gym 2-4 Times a week, and work in two areas    Cardio: Treadmill, but don't overwork yourself!  you can lose mass this way.  Run almost at a sprint until you are completely out of breath, then stop.  Don't run for elongated periods of time, or else you can actually lose muscle mass. Cardio is fairly important.    Mass:  Presses, Squats, lifts anything to build muscle.  WWE is really not interested in smaller stars for the most part.  They are looking for people over 6' and muscular.  Rey and Evan Bourne, along with Eddie, Shawn Michaels, and other small stars are exceptional.    Eat all carbs before noon and all veggies after noon.  Eat meat all the time.  Read up on the business, and start taking acting classes.  Do drama at school, and for god sakes, go to college!  You do not want to have a dead end future. Good luck!

I woukdn't try to run as much. At least get Colts used to the passing game. Attack Galloway. They will keep doubling him and then you can Bryant, Smith, and possibly Clayton. Don't try to go crazy with blitzing. Bail out and cover. You can't afford to let Wayne, Harrison, Clark, and Gonzalez with too much one on one. Plus, Peyton Manning won't even be afraid. Especially since he has a pretty solid offensive line.|`|KZsdVGJzaa	simulate the game if u win yay good job if u lose then turn ur console off and simulate it again until u win. or u can take auto save off and jus exit then re enter

5v1krJWeaa	microwave them|`|hwTYAGQQaa	I would rinse them in warm water to get the sugar out of them first. When they dry they will be even stiffer, but clean.  I would then give them a couple treatments of Lexol.  They will them loosen up with use.  Assuming that they are made primarily of leather.  I use this stuff on my batting and motorcycle gloves.  It works.
ZKikquiOaa	The Buckeye has holes on the side of the risers already drilled and tapped to accept any type of sight.  The question is what are you going to use it for.  The buckeye has a maximum poundage of 30 lbs, so it can't be used to hunt, even at 30 lbs the Buckeye limbs aren't really the fastest one out there.  You'd be better off getting a $10 ring sight for that bow.  A single ring sight is much better for target shooting than multi pin sights.    Edit  Depending on the poundage of your bow, something like this might do    http://www.lancasterarchery.com/product_...    My bad, I guess prices have gone up, that sight used to cost $10, 4 years ago when I bought a bunch for the range.  With bows higher than 25 lbs, this sight might rattle loose on you and you'll have to get something like the Cartel K sight, even that one might rattle loose from time to time.  There's a joke in the archery community about Cartel, they call those the Rattleist.
e5c347190016113ac012b8aa79ed41aeaa	There are many, many mods for a 98C.    What are you looking for?    You can get barrel, barrel shrouds, hoppers, stocks, trigger systems, HPA/Co2 systems, Front grips, Regulators, Paint jobs, etc.    Here is what I've currently modded mine too:    http://i146.photobucket.com/albums/r274/...|`|htMOl3c4aa	just take out the trigger spring, make it shoot faster.|`|QcmNHRzyaa	response trigger and cyclone feed. than get the X7 hopper for a lower profile|`|CckFjXIPaa	response triggers are great, they shoot really fast  i'd get a viewloader evo 2 hopper, it's 60$ and feeds 17 bps  you can also put on stocks for a better feel.  i'd also get a new barrel, the stock 8 1/2 incher sucks. (14 inchs is perfect)|`|9EZfnIZtaa	They still make them? I played paintball like  8,9 years that was my first gun. Then when to an automag.    Then an autococker ANS GenX  Hell yeaaa
Y4mz8BShaa	8mm is more durable, and will last a good deal longer. I say don't take the chance of a bearing blowout, which, if occurs, will wreak immense havoc on your internals. 7mm will work fine if you're under 400, but I'd say get the extra security for the 8mm.
sHXazyDWaa	I can't begin to tll you what it's worth. Considering there is a guy whos in the HOF on it and at least 1 more who will be, it's certianly worth several hundred, if not thousands of $$$|`|a51AvQrlaa	im not sure but once i went to this store which they had a red sox jersey with all the 2004 team signatures and were selling it for 25,000 i think.  Yours can be worth around 30k since many of those have retired.
e5c347190016113ac012b8aa79ed41aeaa	Accuracy comes from a good paintball and a good paintball to barrel match to where the paintball can be easily blown out of the barrel but not roll out or get stuck.    The best barrel would be a Barrel Kit so you can change the barrel bore to best fit the paintball.    The next best option and not as costly is a Palmers Brass Barrel.  Its unique bore allows it to fit and accurately shoot differently sized paintballs.    Other barrel that you must match the paintballs to the barrel specifically and are good barrels are:    Lapco  J&J  CP|`|gAKUFk1Qaa	j and j ceramic 14in   or    flatline   :)|`|deMTW7ljaa	To be honest getting a flat-line barrel would be the best way to go to get the best balance between accuracy and maneuverability.
AA10304847	The Cardinal defense can stand up to the Steeler offense, the question though is can the Steeler scary defense shut down the impressive Card receivers?     The Cards have several edges in this game, not only was Whisenhunt the Steelers tight end coach from 2001-2003 and offensive coordinator from 2004-2006, but Russ Grimm was the Steeler assistant head coach/offensive line coach, Mike Miller the receivers coach , Matt Raich a defensive assistant and Kevin Spencer the Special Teams coach. Talk about knowing your enemy. They know the strengths and weaknesses of alot of the Steeler players. Of course Tomlin knows this, but even so, it's making a Cardinal bet looking mighty good. Whisenhunt should be able to get in Roethlisberger's head to devise a scheme to minimize Hines Ward's impact (assuming he's able to play at 100%).    Consider this: Pittsburgh has played 2 of the top 7 passing teams this season in Indy and Houston and given up an average of over 20 points per game. Both were home games for Pittsburgh where their defense is off the charts, and more importantly, Arizona passes for close to 30 pts per game more than either. For these reasons, i'm leaning on the CARDs to pull it off.     The "us against the world" mentality is the other big edge for the CARDS, used to win the last 3 playoff games.....|`|dCUOdbEbaa	Steelers by 2388936298326 points|`|SSrsxhllaa	Steelers by 10!|`|zcLhvM83aa	The Pittsburgh Steelers my dude BIG BEN is the ****|`|OFGE01tRaa	It will be a real aerial circus. There is a limit to Steelers capacity to score big. Cards could light up the place with many scores.     It boils down to how easily Pitt can rush the passer. If they can sack Warner regularly, hey win. If not, Cards could pull it off.|`|HfzQoaBoaa	i hope the cardinals!! :)|`|sPPib1TRaa	Steelers 31, Cardinals 17|`|8M7gEMJiaa	I'm in Tampa and all I see are Cardinals everywhere. So I'm going with the Steelers but A LOT.|`|qXlBsRLgaa	steelrs 24-14|`|Ah5KDMALaa	steelers by 21|`|xsLWryq7aa	Alright, first of all there offense isnt that good. It should really be called Larry Fittzgerald, since he is there offense. Sure James and Boldin contribute, but Larry pretty much does all the work. And with with James Harrison and Lamar Woodley putin pressure on Kurt Warner you can expect quite alot of those balls to be off target. I have to say Warner being a true vet does work well under presure but hes still human. Plus with Ike and Ryan clark playin deep on Larry the pass would have to be dead on accurate to make a completion. Even though Kurt just lobs it up most of the time anyway (like in the game against Atlanta) and depends on Fittzgerald to make the completion.    Also, I wouldn't count out Pittsburgh's offense. Yea sure there "inconsistant" but they've been dealing with injury problems since week 3. After Willie messed up his knee, and Mendenhall ended his season after trying to truck Ray Lewis, we had to depend on a running back, who in august wasn't even placed on the roster. And with two offensive linemen out and the recivers going in and out it was hard. But against a healthy Pittburgh team I have no doubts at all.    Steelers Domintate 35-13|`|jRi35KJHaa	go steelers!|`|qh9EOXKOaa	I definitely think it's going to be the Steelers they have 5 superbowl rings (soon to be 6) the cardinals only have 1 plus the steelers are ahead by 7 points...so I definitely think its going to be the steelers that win it... sorry cardinal fans!
CdAE4nXcaa	get some jiu jitsu tapes and a partner and go over basic submissions until you can get into a gym. second you want to do strength and conditioning workouts, don't lift heavy. here is a work out that i have done and believe me it works.     This is Randy Couture's Strength and conditioning work out:     Do all of the listed work outs with out putting the bar down  use light weight to start with i go with 35 lbs on each side of the bar.    Bent rows x8  Upright rows x8  Military press x8  Good morning x8  Lunges x8 (each leg)  Squat push press x8  Deadlift x8     After the exercise is complete rest one minute then go again do at least 3 sets every time you do it and do it every other day.   Here is a link for the video  video.google.com/videoplay?docid=32249...    i also do other strength exercises after this one.    pull ups  plyo push ups for explosive power  sit ups, v ups,  sledge hammer a tire  tire flips about 30 yards down and back  do 3 sets of this along with the couture work out    and just work on grappling with a buddy prefferably one who wrestles or has some kind of experience with grappling.    and work on a heavy bag, double end bag, and speed bag|`|gBO908P6aa	Get a good book like this:    http://www.amazon.com/Training-Warriors-...    7 years of training and you're getting "Tae Kwon Do" wrong?|`|SM6qHDKeaa	first, this isn't a blog space, so i can waste it all i want. second, if you've done tie kwon doe for 7 years, i bet you would have learned that it's spelled tae kwon do. finally, you should google crossfit if you're looking for good conditioning workouts

He's nothing but a punk.|`|cuWV0dLFaa	KG is not a thug at all when he was in Minnesota where I am from he would frequently stop by the all the local Charity's and helped so many people in fact after hurricane Katrina one of my friends who lived down there lost everything and KG bought his and many other family's houses up here in Minnesota|`|IxIj04Biaa	Are you kidding me?

It just really depends on what type of terrain you normally skate and how your foot is made. I recommend going to your local skateshop so you can actually try it on and see how it feels unlike ordering off the internet. Also different brands of skate shoes run in different sizes. Say if you wore a size 8 in a brand like Emerica you might wear a 7 or 9 in a brand like Fallen. So it really all depends on what I said.    Hope I could help. :)

Theres no question about it, hes there hes in your face he has attitude he likes surprises and he interacts with those around him. and when they had him take Wcw and fued with his father nothing boosted rating more!

AA10304847	The Cardinal defense can stand up to the Steeler offense, the question though is can the Steeler scary defense shut down the impressive Card receivers?     The Cards have several edges in this game, not only was Whisenhunt the Steelers tight end coach from 2001-2003 and offensive coordinator from 2004-2006, but Russ Grimm was the Steeler assistant head coach/offensive line coach, Mike Miller the receivers coach , Matt Raich a defensive assistant and Kevin Spencer the Special Teams coach. Talk about knowing your enemy. They know the strengths and weaknesses of alot of the Steeler players. Of course Tomlin knows this, but even so, it's making a Cardinal bet looking mighty good. Whisenhunt should be able to get in Roethlisberger's head to devise a scheme to minimize Hines Ward's impact (assuming he's able to play at 100%).    Consider this: Pittsburgh has played 2 of the top 7 passing teams this season in Indy and Houston and given up an average of over 20 points per game. Both were home games for Pittsburgh where their defense is off the charts, and more importantly, Arizona passes for close to 30 pts per game more than either. For these reasons, i'm leaning on the CARDs to pull it off.     The "us against the world" mentality is the other big edge for the CARDS, used to win the last 3 playoff games.....|`|H7AcXAyaaa	Steelers by 4|`|SSrsxhllaa	Steelers win 31-21|`|jRi35KJHaa	steelers|`|KZsdVGJzaa	i never heard of the cardnials so i guess the steelers win by default|`|hynkDOeEaa	Cardinals!

rDmlKoRQaa	Oh My God YES!    If there is a definition of a quarterback who only manages a game its this guy. With his defense giving him tons of possessions and not requiring that they score very much he has it easy at the QB position.    He does not get rid of the ball quickly, which is why his offensive line looks so bad. No team can block for as long as this guy takes in the pocket. Its also why he takes so many hits.    Also, his 'iron man' tough reputation is garbage. I've seen Troy Aikman and Steve Young have thier careers ended by concussions that didn't get them carted off the field. Also, guys play with injuries all the time, but we only hear about the bumps and bruises on Big [Baby] Ben. Farve played with a broken thumb on his throwing hand for an entire season!|`|MDhI4mBEaa	Everybody always uses the Seattle-Pitt SB as an example of Ben's playing ability. Listen, I'm a Browns fan, but I will defend Ben all the way. As a player, you don't have to play great, you don't even have to play good, hell, you can actually play bad. As long as your team makes less mistakes than your opponent you will win the game. Pitt did that in the SB against Seattle. The refs didn't blow it, Seattle blew it  They had 7 penalties for 70 yards for Christ sakes. 3 for 20 for Pitt. Plus Pitt has never been a passing team, its Run, Run, Run with them. Ben does just enough to keep the drive alive, slowly and methodically moving them down the feild and putting points on the board. There defense does its' thing. And we all know what that is!!!! Ben is not overrated. Ben is a good, not great, good, solid, pretty consistent QB. I'd take him on my Browns any day.|`|xxtvhn5Naa	YES!  I completaly agree with you... He is WWWWWAAAAYYYYY overrated!|`|qxgpXA6kaa	yes by far, philip rivers should of went to the probowl|`|xsLWryq7aa	No, If anything he under rated. He has they 2nd most playoff wins by a qb in his first 5 yrs. Has been to 3 AFC chamionships and won 2 of them. And Now has been to two Super Bowls about to be 2/2 come sunday. Sure he holds the ball too long and isn't consisnt, but give him time to grow. People forget the average time it takes for a qb to become a vet is 7 yrs.|`|auW4Kwxcaa	yes he is waaaaaay overrated|`|v9ny6C8Paa	Who?|`|JnYFLsZcaa	yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes|`|AA11609504	The reason why he's a big deal is because the NFL does not have many studs at the QB position.  Big Ben for the most part had a nice line and run game to protect him.  He also doesn't make as many mistakes as the average QB.  He's overrated, but compared to the entire league, he's in the top half in QBs in the league.|`|VckdHm3Qaa	yes overrated by alot|`|ak44mIy3aa	Well who said that he was great? He is probably just an above average WN nothing else, if it wasn't for the Steelers Defence we would have never win the Super Bowl this year and two years ago.|`|Ar5VHDiBaa	He's no Trent Dilfer!    I found some old scratched up records in my mom's basement that play better than him|`|SSrsxhllaa	That's funny! The only people that think that Big Ben is overrated is Steeler haters! GO STEELERS!!!|`|KZsdVGJzaa	yea roethlisberger isn't special if it wasn't for bad ref calls then the seahawks definitely wouldve won that game. looks like the NFC west is gonna strike back and defeat the steelers on sunday

About a year ago, when I was 14, I started taking teakwondo. Of course, I wasn't planning on being an expert or anything, and I did stop taking it (it was a school thing and I changed schools so..). But the thing is that I also got to train once with 30 or 40 year olds, and they only had blue belts. What I mean is that it doesn't matter what age you are, you can still start practicing anything and be good at it after a while. After all, it could take you from 1 to a couple of years to become a black belt. Try it. You're still very young.    Good luck!|`|Yslq4OYhaa	No it is not too late. Keep an open mind and learn all you can. Find a good instructor and you have found a good art.

69b4203311a371eab3d1c0ebf526270caa	Boarding is called whenever a player viciously checks another player into the boards in a potentially dangerous way. Even if the check appears to be legal, rather than elbowing, cross checking, or other illegal contact, it can be called a boarding penalty if the ref. thinks so.    According to USA hockey rules, if a player gets injured through a boarding penalty, the referee has no option other than giving the offending player a five minute major penalty and a game misconduct.|`|4lcFNsQ8aa	Boarding in ice hockey is a penalty called when an offending player violently pushes an opposing player into the boards of the hockey rink, when the player is facing the board. The boarding call is quite often a major penalty due to the likelihood of injury sustained by the player who was boarded. However, if no injury is sustained as a result of a boarding, a minor penalty will be called. Boarding is usually assessed to a player when the opposing player is hit 4-5 feet away from the boards and hits his head against the boards on the way down. Whenever the hit results in an injury, the player is assessed a game misconduct and ejected from the game, with a suspension occasionally following.|`|Kpnp9ryFaa	It might be different in the NHL, but according to USA Hockey, all that has to happen is the player must be violently thrown into the boards, even if the check is legal.  It the player is hit into the boards while facing the boards, a much more serious checking from behind penalty would be called.  if it was head first into the boards, a major and game misconduct would be called.|`|XlZTvIqvaa	when a player is standing a couple feet away from the boards and a player comes and hits them and they fly into the boards

If something goes wrong, that helmet is designed to stop a head trauma from causing your brain harm.  If you have treated your helmet poorly, it is more likely to become weakened and could fail when you need it the most.  Sitting on your helmet might not cause it damage; but are you willing to risk your life on it?      I don't play football; but I use helmets for downhill mountain biking and motorcycling.  Myself; I always treat my helmets with great care.  A helmet has saved my life at least once; if I had abused it before the crash would it still have saved me?  I don't know; and it's not something I would want to find out.|`|KZsdVGJzaa	i don't kno i would never even attempt to sit on my helmet|`|hS7vM7SDaa	WHY WULD U SiiT 0N 1 ANYW3Z???...|`|rDmlKoRQaa	Yes. If you do it once here or there it will likely be fine, but sitting on it for a prolonged period of time will deform the helmet (not noticeably to the eye). But when the shape is slightly altered it loses its flexibility and can crack on impact.

bjzeWMZ0aa	I have a couple pre-game stretches on the ice I do religiously. Heck, I even circle the ice a certain amount of times before starting them.    First, I stretch one of my legs out to the side with my weight on the heel while I'm on my knee of the other leg. I rest my stick against the leg I'm stretching and switch legs after that.    Then, I do the frog stretch. I lie on my stomach, with my legs spread out and bent, and push of the ice with my arms.    Finally, I end with the Lecavalier stretch. I lean on my stick at my knees and make one arm straight while twisting my shoulder inward and then switch arms after that.    Then I'm off and ready to go!|`|HNEWf7ILaa	I do what TBL does.|`|69b4203311a371eab3d1c0ebf526270caa	- Lift your hockey stick above your head and tilt the top of your body to the right. Keep your feet apart. You should feel the stretch on your left side. Hold it for 10 seconds and then repeat on the opposite side.     - Skate forward with your feet apart and bend forward at the hips. Keeping your knees bent, feel a stretch in the back of your legs. You should hold this stretch for at least 15 seconds.     - Stride to the side. Stand with both feet together and your knees slightly bent. Step out to the side, keeping your knees bent. Repeat by stepping out in the opposite direction.     - Reach to the side. Lateral side stretches help warm up your upper body. Stand with your feet slightly apart. Bend to the side, holding the opposite arm above your head. Avoid leaning forward.     Since you will be doing almost all of these exercises on the ice, make sure that therethere's enough spaceee, (:|`|xzpZNMgeaa	Here's my routine:    Stretch right leg to side w/ left knee on ground.  Do reverse  Stretch left leg back with right knee on ground.  Do reverse  Spread legs apart and move them up and forward (kind of like skating backwards, except both legs at the same time...)    P.S.

Go to Amazon.com and search for "long range shooting".  You will find many books.  All you will have to do is select the one(s) that fit your need.    For something on exterior ballistics, I highly recommend "Understanding Firearm Ballistics" by Robert A. Rinker.  Plenty of math but kept at an understandable level.  For the math involved in long range shooting, try one of the sniper books.  The military sniper training books would be a good choice.|`|Vakup5Jvaa	I like these.  http://www.ultimatesniper.com/catalog_pa...

Sniping is different than long range shooting. Not every long range shooter is a sniper. Every sniper is a long range shooter. If he is not able to hit a target at over 500 yards, I would only classify him as a sharpshooter or marksman. Ex: Most police sharpshooters are not snipers. They will rarely engage a target at over 50 yards.    Long range shooting in itself is a skill (and art) to master. The equipment is highly specialized and expensive. The custom loading of the ammo for the rifle is an exact science. Then you have to have the talent, time and discipline to develop the skill. Even to hit a target at 500 yards is not as easy as it seems. Unless you have been in the military, most shooters have never even seen a target at 500 yrds/meters much less actually fired and hit it.     For a serious long range shooter, the sport combines technology, math and a good dose of Zen.|`|VaxIN5oIaa	i do not recall his name but, a russian sniper made a confirmed kill a mile away with a single bullet from a .50 cal machine gun without a scope in the 1940 or 50. he later wrote a book. not sure what its called either. sorry but do some research and u will find it.

I've played goalie for 42 years so far, and have become quite the equipment whore through the years.    When I've sought equipment for myself, I always tried to find the best deals on the best quality equipment that I could afford. It seems better to pay a little more for equipment that will last more than a season or two (unless you're not sure you want to stay in the sport), than spending more and more on equipment that won't last or be as protective.    Personally, if you plan on playing hockey for the long term, the non-Orient built equipment seems to have better protection, quality and longevity, but is also a bit pricier.     Canada and Scandinavia are steeped in the sport of hockey and produce better quality equipment, albeit a higher price.    Major Brands to look at are RBK (Reebok), Bauer, Mission, Itech, CCM, Easton, Jofa, Koho and Vaughn (exclusively goalie equipment).     These companies are the major players and have the selection of equipment that covers the spectrum from the beginner to the professional. Keep in mind that these companies pro level equipment is usually manufactured in Canada or Scandinavia, with levels below being made in the Far East.    From a goalie standpoint, I've recently went from Itechs (now owned by Bauer) senior level goalie pads and gloves to their Pro versions (from a site mentioned below) and the difference in quality is night and day. The materials are much better, will last longer, and give you better playability and protection. But alas, not everyone is in the market for pro level equipment and its related costs.    However, if you check out the link below, you'll find closeouts, discounts, "blowouts", discontinued models, and some new product lines that are quite interesting. In the link below you'll also find inexpensive hotel accommodations, entertainment ticket access, and hockey equipment deals from Amazon, as well as continually updated eBay hockey listings that end soon!!!

Some people like certain brands because of the way they fit but not everyone is the same so it is really up to you.  I mean I know guys that have equipment and most of it is not even by the same manufactor.  So your best bet is to go try stuff on and see what you like and how it fits.|`|ll2y4YIGaa	shin pads- itech  elbow pads- itech  helmet- rbk  gloves- eagle or warrior  shoulder pads- itech  ice pants- itech  inline pants- mission  ice skates- bauer  inline skates- mission or tour  stick- bauer

3BGJETHYaa	Footwork is incredibly important.  It allows you to control the distance, angle, and time of the attack.  If your opponent has better footwork than you, you are toast.  Watch Lyoto Machida's fights.  He easily has some of the best footwork in the UFC, and it shows- the man almost never gets hit, he gets to choose when and where he attacks, and as a result, he wins every single exchange.  BJ penn also has some pretty nice footwork.    Take a fencing lesson sometime.  Half of fencing is footwork.    You develop it by having a good, well balanced stance and learning not to give that stance up if you can help it.  Different styles and arts have slightly different stances, but the basic idea is almost always this- one (lead) foot out, with your toes straight ahead.  The other foot is back a bit, and is turned outwards somewhat (in fencing it is turned outwards almost 90 degrees, but you lose out in lateral movement in this case)|`|C0sT0PPyaa	footwork can beat any punch    you develop it through shadow boxing and skipping|`|FJNw9eiyaa	try fighting with your shoes tied together, then think about how stupid you sound.  ______________________________________...    well maybe you should have been more specific, doucher.|`|kH4LeoAAaa	Very Importante!

You don't need to block an attack if you have good enough footwork to just move out of the way. This also makes a counter attack INCREDIBLY simple.  just don't let your legs stay anchored. Always keep moving around back and force and switching your stance.  to avoid the legs becoming anchored bounce on the balls of your feet while fighting and shift left, right, in, out.|`|xB4kuGMVaa	if you have no footwork you will just stand there and not mover, you are a sitting duck!!!!  you develop it by practicing footwork, i have some drills if you would like them email me!!  taekwondogibson@yahoo.com|`|vQUb2aT1aa	Footwork is an essential part in all martial art forms.  Footwork serves several purposes such as allowing one to dodge attacks more effectivley, set up for attacks, and putting more force into strikes.  If a combatant remains in one spot, then more than likely they will get KO'd.  Also if one stands flat-footed, the they will take more damage from a strike than they would if they "shifted" with it.  Footwork can be developed via shadow sparring and other response exercises.
AA10304847	The Cardinal defense can stand up to the Steeler offense, the question though is can the Steeler scary defense shut down the impressive Card receivers?     The Cards have several edges in this game, not only was Whisenhunt the Steelers tight end coach from 2001-2003 and offensive coordinator from 2004-2006, but Russ Grimm was the Steeler assistant head coach/offensive line coach, Mike Miller the receivers coach , Matt Raich a defensive assistant and Kevin Spencer the Special Teams coach. Talk about knowing your enemy. They know the strengths and weaknesses of alot of the Steeler players. Of course Tomlin knows this, but even so, it's making a Cardinal bet looking mighty good. Whisenhunt should be able to get in Roethlisberger's head to devise a scheme to minimize Hines Ward's impact (assuming he's able to play at 100%).    Consider this: Pittsburgh has played 2 of the top 7 passing teams this season in Indy and Houston and given up an average of over 20 points per game. Both were home games for Pittsburgh where their defense is off the charts, and more importantly, Arizona passes for close to 30 pts per game more than either. For these reasons, i'm leaning on the CARDs to pull it off.     The "us against the world" mentality is the other big edge for the CARDS, used to win the last 3 playoff games.....

It should really be called Larry Fittzgerald, since he is there offense. Sure James and Boldin contribute, but Larry pretty much does all the work. And with with James Harrison and Lamar Woodley putin pressure on Kurt Warner you can expect quite alot of those balls to be off target. I have to say Warner being a true vet does work well under presure but hes still human. Plus with Ike and Ryan clark playin deep on Larry the pass would have to be dead on accurate to make a completion. Even though Kurt just lobs it up most of the time anyway (like in the game against Atlanta) and depends on Fittzgerald to make the completion.    Also, I wouldn't count out Pittsburgh's offense. Yea sure there "inconsistant" but they've been dealing with injury problems since week 3. After Willie messed up his knee, and Mendenhall ended his season after trying to truck Ray Lewis, we had to depend on a running back, who in august wasn't even placed on the roster. And with two offensive linemen out and the recivers going in and out it was hard. But against a healthy Pittburgh team I have no doubts at all.

Probably jumps, motion technique, dance/cheer/chant skills, tumbling, and spirit. I don't know if you stunt...? For jumps you should practice a toe-touch, double toe-touch, r/l hurkey, front hurdler, and pike everyday. For motion technique work on all your motions like r/l fight, high v, low v, daggers, r/l k, etc...For dance/cheer/chant have good facials ( o face, smile, kissy face, winky face, etc) and be loud! For tumbling you will probably need at least a standing backhand spring...if you have more than that definitely show it off. Spirit ..like you are excited and know how to pump up your team "come on red! let's go big red! number one!" that kind of stuff. Always smile, stand in the front when learning material, and enjoy yourself. Good luck!

You can count them on zero hands.  Just because he died, he became famous.  Also, if anyone else does track and field, Prefontaine is likely to be taken.  And listen to runner158, Prefontain wasn't the first to break the 4 min barrier.    How about Sebastian Coe, he was a famous Brittish middle distance runner (had some firsts in the 800m race), and is almost guaranteed not to be taken because his name isn't a common one when talking about the greats of track and field.    Or Paavo Nurmi, a Finnish runner from the early 20th century, dubbed the "Flying Finn".  He had 9 olympic gold medals, tieing Mark Spitz (the only person with more is Michael Phelps!).    Irishrunner1 has a good suggestion too, I've always been a fan of Jim Ryun.    Personal opinion - If I were writing the paper, I'd go with Paavo Nurmi, you can definitely get 2 pages worth of writing about his career, and he is considered by some to be the greatest track and field athlete of all time.

60c1c3cd65f0c9deb7c8cdbb1a06ba1baa	Shin splints come from muscle imbalance. You need to stretch out your calf and work your soleus! The soleus is the area around the achilles tendon, right under where your calf muscles end. Many people with shin splints just think that it's their shins and their calves, when really, most of it has to do with the soleus. Try spelling out the alphabet by pointing your toes. Ice your shins down AFTER you run (never ice before!). Hip problems can come from a variety of reasons. It could just be a temporary pulled hip flexor muscle. It could be that you need different shoes or orthotics. You could be stepping abnormally with your right foot, making your knee and hip hurt. Make sure you lace your shoes tight before you run. Running with loosely tied shoes can lead to more injuries or problems/aching all throughout your feet and legs. There's a brand of orthotics called Superfeet and I've heard that they worked wonders (my doctor, podiatrist, and track coach highly recommend it). Make sure you stretch out properly before you do any work outs. To stretch your soleus, find a wall or fence. Put your hands on the wall/fence, and keep one leg forward, one leg back, both bent. You should feel the stretch in the area I mentioned. To stretch your hip flexors, get down on one knee. Straighten your back and push your hips forward.|`|GJ7EeVEWaa	well im not sure about your hip, but shins, yeah its probably shin splints. It usually occurs when you just start running. What i did was doing heel walks, which is basically doing a heel walk as a part of stretch, walk slowly and step on your heel, and bring your foot down slowly, and keep doing that.

With your hand covering the wheel pry it back and it should force the bottom bearing off... leaving it sitting on the truck.     Flip it around and do it again on the other side.    If it is really stuck you could try putting some Bones Speed Cream on... it may make it slip out a little easier.|`|8S2KhGwSaa	First, take your wheels off your board. Then once you get your wheels off put half of your wheel on the axel of your truck and have the other half off. Then start pulling the wheel and lifting it at the same time. Requires a lot of strength though.
