20090109211239AAa0y9q	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Is it okay to have a sexy mom?	i am a 15 yr old guy with a sexy single mom. she likes to wear miniskirts and likes showing off her massive fake boobs, as well as wearing lots of makeup and having a thong showing while in public. at first i was sort of ashamed, although now im proud that my mom who is in her forties looks hotter and sexier than most girls in their twenties. i even enjoy watching my friends check her out and flirt with her, knowing how jealous they are that their moms are all fat and ugly, while i have a mom who resembles something of a goddess.is it okay for me to want to show off my sexy mom to other guys, or should i be ashamed that my mom still has an unbelievable amount of sex appeal despite being in her forties.

20090113115722AAzAb2G	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	The role of man and woman in a relationship?	in this society, its typical for a woman to stay at home (whether by choice or due to the inability to secure employment) even if they dont have kids, usually she takes care of the homefront, i.e. cooking, cleaning, laundry, etc (although of course the partner helps as well) while the spouse or partner works.   my question is, if the woman is the sole breadwinner, is it unfair to expect the man to take care of the homefront? would men consider this an insult and think the woman is being rude?    by the way, he has been trying to find a job but has had no luck yet.

I know that he likes me like that but I only see him as a friend (which I have expressed to him in the past) and he knows that I don't want any part of being in a relationship.

20090202210818AAzcYKj	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Why did this happen with my girl during sex?	Alright I'm kind of freaking out here and I would appreciate a lot of serious answers here. Alright I'm having sex with my girlfriend shes 16, and even though shes young shes not a virgin and is experienced because she has already been in a long term sexual relationship with an older guy.      Now this was our second time having sex. And our first time she was on top for most of it. But this time I just started thrusting her hard right from the start, and yea she was so wet and I was fingering her before, but when I pulled out before I came. She told me oh my god don't be grossed out I'm so embarrassed im sorry but you have blood on your penis.      So yea I didn't want to hurt her feelings so I acted really cool about it as I got cleaned up. She told me that I must of went so deep that I popped her cherry. But I would have assumed her cherry had popped already. Like she was not on her period because she has not bled since.      So what is this blood, we are really close even though we have only been dating for a couple of weeks. She doesn't want to talk about it and now shes telling me to use condoms because shes nervous about getting pregnant I guess but it popped out of nowhere because she said she didn't want me to wear a condom in the beginning.      Is she hiding something from me, am I going to get something? She actually got checked out by those special doctors on the day we started seeing each other. And she was all clean.      Anyone know what happened? I was going really deep I don't know if that makes a girl bleed though normally.

Sometimes when me and my man have sex I don't come, and really it bother me that much, sometimes I prefer not to have an orgasm.

20090114211331AAWSuZF	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	I can’t stop thinking about my recently-married ex?	I had a girlfriend way back in high school-a real admirable girl - pretty, smart and God-fearing. What we had was so special. Before high school ends, we separated as we felt that we’re still young. Further, we went to different universities during college. We had communication at first but eventually lost it. Even then, I still thought about her. I had a girlfriend after her and she had a boyfriend too. After college graduation, I had a reunion with high school friends but she wasn’t present. Then I learned from friends that she just bore her child- she got pregnant before her wedding (they instantaneously wed upon learning that she’s pregnant). When I heard the news, I thought I will not be affected but then, it felt like my heart has been crushed. I couldn’t stop thinking about it and until this day I still feel the pain. I tried contacting her now but she doesn’t reply. I know it’s not proper but I just wanted to check on her and make sure that she’s happy with the guy. I think I still wanted her so bad.

20090220204426AAfLUR8	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	I'm Jealous of my Boyfriend's Ex in a Wheelchair?	Okay, I am not lying.. this is a totally true story. My boyfriend used to date a midget. She was about 4' tall and in a wheelchair. They were together for 3 years and he lost his virginity to her. Why am I jealous? Because she was his everything.. the only reason why they broke up was because she cheated on him with another midget in a wheelchair and she's with that guy now. He is into girls who dye their hair funky colors (like she did), and she was gothic-like (which he loves), and she was even in some porn stuff on the internet for people with fetishes (what boyfriend doesn't want to say his girl is so hot people actually pay for pictures of her?). I also feel that she was probably way tighter than I am, because she was so little, and she was so light that they could probably do a ton of freaky stuff together. I'm not fat, but I'm average height and weight.. which is probably heavy to him, after being with her. Am I crazy, or do I have reasons to feel this way? We've been together for a year, and he just Now got rid of some of her things.. after I asked him to. He claims the nude photos of her cant be found, but that means they are probably lurking in his house somewhere for me to find someday.. I've already seen the one's online, but I know there are more. And since we've been together, he hasn't ever wanted to take pics of me like that.. anyway, what do you think?..      ps: I don't want to offend anyone by using the term midget, but i'm not sure what the correct term is, and "little person" sounds really fake..

I don't talk much but we sit next to each other in class and are cordial. Anyway this kid seems to only put people he considers cool or whatever on there and takes people on and off quite frequently. DO you think maybe this kid doesn't want me on their list but doesn't want me to know that they have one so they don't hurt me or doesn't have to deal with me every day, even though I wouldn't dare bring it up. It's just wierd because they don't seem to hate me and don't seem to have anything against me. That's all I can figure, does it make sense? I'm not too worried about it anymore, because he took off one friend of mine off the list a while ago. Maybe this person just blocks people they don't want on the list. But I never talked to this person on myspace at all, maybe they knew I'd send them a friend request.

20070211210522AAsWWld	Family & Relationships;Family	How do I build back a broken relationship with my younger sisters?	I am 26yrs old and I have three sisters, two are twins (25yrs) and one is 10yrs. old. You would think that at this point in my life I would have the best realtionship as a young adult with my sisters who are close in age to me and I would be the "idol" sister to my youngest sibling but that is quite far fetched! I am a pretty nice sister to get along with. I do not complain and fight, and really I just love to live happy and peaceful, however the people whom I want to be the closest to have a hatred toward me and I don't know how to fix that. I try to get along with all of them but we just don't agree because of nasty attitudes that I refuse to put up with. I do not like fake, unpleasant, rude people and well that's the attitude that I'm up against with all three of them, even the youngest sister who has learned to pick up bad habits from being around the twins. She has lost all respect for me as her elder from listening to the twins talk bad about me. I need help to resolve this!

20070219094056AAm4iD9	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	So Should I ASK Him If I Can Come To See Him Or Should I Just Go?	This is in regards to my friend who just lost his son in a fire. I'm being advised by another friend or two of mine that it's appropriate to ask first if it's ok that I fly out to see him to pay respects/show support, as opposed to just showing up unannounced. They said because the guy may not want to be around anyone but close family and friends. I was going to just book a flight and go out there without asking. Because it feels kinda funny ASKING someone if you can come to pay respects to them for their loss of their loved one. But someone's telling me its inappropriate to do it that way and I should ask him first. I am in the dark about situations like this, can you guys set me straight please? The last thing I want to do is anything inappropriate or cause further stress/chaos for this guy, he just lost his baby son. And my intentions are genuine. Thanks, I appreciate it.

Not sure if i should or not...?	im 20 yrs old, muslim and been with my bf who i thought i was going to marry for a year. However, things have never really been that good, we always argue, we are completely different, and now im scared of his temper coz of the heated arguments. i have really low self esteem, i think im  ugly and spend most of my time looking at beautiful girls and wishing i was them. I think my bf could do better, and now i think he realises that. We use to spend lots of time together but now he doesnt bother any more, and hes ignored me for two days now, and we havent had an argument he just hasnt called me. I know all the signs are there that we should break up, but both of us say thats not what we want (he is my first love), but i think its what we actually want. I feel like i need him now, and i get so sad and depressed when he ignores me, but i know we are not right together. I dont want to lose him as i lost my v to him which is very important 2 me,and love him so much. Please help..

20070813164342AA5dK9X	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Do you really think that new reality show "The Pick-up Artist" is necessary for full-grown men?	I don't... No man should be in such a sad predictament with women that he has to go to such an extreme of going to a guy who knows how to get women, who by the way, looks like a rock star with his fur coats. A man who's at least old enough to be a father should never have to seek professional help just to get some occasional action with women. Men haven't done this 20 to 30 years ago in the 70s and 80s, so they sure as hell should'nt have to go to that extreme now. I think some men are just too damn ignorant. All the man has to do is just be himself and have something called SELF-CONFIDENCE, now how hard is that, really?? Why do you think Bret Michaels from "Poison" and Tommy Lee from "Motley Crue" have so much success with women? If they were shy, sweet, and sensitive like some women say they like the guy to be, they would'nt be having success with women, DUHHHH!!! YOU NEED CONFIDENCE!!         I'm a guy, I'm 28 years old, and I know this from experience.

20070630200642AAqiO32	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Boy Problems!!?	I like this guy and he said he likes me back. We met about 4 months ago and on the 4th month we started kissing. Then the day before my birthday he came over and we were making out and stuff like that (hehe). well it was all good until June 29th when I was talking 2 one of his friends on myspace and he asked me what my phone # was..so i gave it to him. but the guy i like(call him Johnny) called me. He sounded a little weird and he said im sorry i led you on but i don't really like you like a girlfriend. WHAT?not even a week ago we were downstairs with the doors locked making out! and i started crying and through tears I said then why did we kiss so much if you don't really like me? and it kind of sounded like he was crying and he said he didnt know. We hung up and i called him back later and I asked if we could still be friends and he said no.I got on myspace again and talked 2 his friend and his friend told me that "Johnny" said that i was just another knotch on his belt. really hurts

Quisiera saber si yo o mi madre puede demandar a mi padre y pedir parte de el dinero que ella ha invertido en la manutencion.

20090227150407AAb5lFv	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	How to get my husband to stop referring to his family by 'baby' names... any advice?	My husband and I are somewhat newly weds and he has a child from a previous marriage whom I adore.        Over Christmas, he stopped referring to his family by their names (when talking to me) and now uses the names that he talks to his daughter with.      Mom:  Nana- not like banana, like nona   Brother: Uncle Jimmy (usually Jim)   Sister:  Auntie Amy (usually just Amy)   ... and many more      We communicate well on most everything but this topic stumps me.  This bothers me because I'm his wife, not his child. How do I ask him to stop without hurting his feelings?

20090309090807AAISPVu	Family & Relationships;Friends	I have a really, really good friend, and...?	We have P.E. together and have lunch together on "A-Days" (When we have P.E.). We can call her Olivia. She usually wears long sleeves or a sweatshirt, which I don't find abnormal because I do the same thing and because it was late February. She pushed up her sleeves and made some kind of gesture with her hand or pointed at something. I saw her wrist, and it was covered in cuts in a cross-hatch pattern. They were bright red and looked fairly new. I've never seen this on her before, and when I thought about it, she ALWAYS has long sleeves or it making an effort to hide the insides of her wrists. I'd known about "Olivia"'s depression, but I didn't know it was this serious that she'd have to inflict pain on herself.       I'm not usually one for drama or one to confront others, but this is one of the best friends I've ever had. I haven't said anything about it to her yet, but I can't stand by and do nothing. Should I brave up and talk to her about it? Should I let her work it out on her own? Should I talk to someone else that can help her, like a school counselor or her mom?

20090227145225AAMJz9d	Family & Relationships;Friends	Friend Seems to be Anry at Me?	Today we had elections for the two consul positions in history class. (We're doing Rome) Well, I won first consul meaning I could veto anything in the class. Well the second consul position was a weird situation. My friend (we'll call her Katie) got the most votes after me, but my teacher gave the position to a student (we'll call her Mary) because Mary had bribed the teacher (we were allowed to and she told us that my affect the positions). Well then a person in my group (we were divided into groups and one member from each group had to run) asked the teacher if I could veto the choice. The teacher said yes. Then I was asked if I would rather have Mary or someone else be consul. I wanted Katie to be consul, but Mary had been so excited when she found out she won that it was kind of hard for me to veto the decision. Now Katie won't email, text, or call me back. I know she has her phone because when I called her once, her phone was busy. I think she's mad at me and I don't know what to do.       Any advice?

20090309091013AAvtp30	Family & Relationships;Family	It is wrong to deport a illegal mexican mother.?	my question is simple. I know there will be sympathy, but if you know a illegal who is doing wrong buy moralities standard. Who will never  be able to get a green card legally. Who collects wic medicaid and food stamps and lives with her american stepfather and one day mexican american mother. The woman is 26 and does not care about nothing about her fun activities. I have started my life over and im very happy. Have a wonderful american girlfriend right by my side. I already have joint custody, but in NC I have to pay child support for 3 years because mother does not have to work. I have already spend 5k on attorneys, and im tired of spending more. She cant drive cant work but I always feel like Im always going to have to support her too. If she got deported and even served a ban, she could go home and learn something get a drivers license. I try to be positive. But I cant see her changing. Stepfather told me if it were not for her children,(she has another daughter  who is 4)she would be gone. Stepfather brought them over when she was 18 on tourist visa, and know she is 26 and has never been back.  It would be cheaper to deport and one headache gone, but she still is my daughters mother. What would you all do. Mother is 26 but acts like she wants to be 16 again. I feel mother will not change. I know im not perfect, But I will live my life for my daughter

20090308232608AAGzcmy	Family & Relationships;Other - Family & Relationships	I am getting so sick of this?	Okay my family really does not like my bf, it use to be that my mom hated his guts, and my dad thought he was okay, but now it's my mom thinks he alright, and my dad hates his guts. I really do not want to choose between the 2 of them. But eventually they are going to lay it to me straight I either stop seeing him or I lose my family. So I guess I'm going to have to break up with him, I really hate how things are right now, it's so bad my dad tells me that if he comes to get me, that I should hurry and get ready so we can get out of his house and so he won't have to see my bf face. I've been dating him for 1 year and a half now, it's always been like this from day 1. My mom don't like him cuz he's fat, and my dad don't like him cuz well... we fight alot but I mean we work through them. My bf almost called the cops on my dad 1 night because my dad kicked me out of the house with nothing but socks and a shirt on, and it was 20 degrees that night. I guess my dad heard me yelling at my bf on the security camera's. Idk what to do I am stuck. His family loves me half to death, I just wish that my family could see it, there always telling me how they will turn there back on me 1 day, and his mom is going to murder me in my sleep, or my bf will. I know they are just looking out for me but idk I just wish I could handle somethings on my own. But I have very overprotected parents. I'm 18 he's 24. What should I do?
20090308172911AAg7JxB	Family & Relationships;Friends	I am breaking up with a friend?	im a senior. we've been friends since the 6th grade.   not super close. im his best friend.    we've never had a fight and im planning on stopping the friendship.   i have more than enough good reasons.   he is super selfish and lazy. whenever we hang out he only wants to do stuff that involves sitting down, or just sitting in his car. he always wants to get high. he ignores me and gets mad when i dont want to get high and tells me im PMSing. im tired of it.   last time i hung out with him, we were eating by his car, and he was throwing his trash everywhere.(he litters all the time) then a person who worked at the restaurant came out and said "can you guys pick up your trash? i always have to clean up your trash, no big deal but it would help me out" then "my friend" looks at me and tells me to clean up his trash. i said "no way, its your trash, pick it up" and he made a big deal about every thing he picked up. urg. so im venting a little too.   he is super clingy and i loathe being around him. i have just pitied him for the past year and a half. he used to be kinda cool...and not super fat and selfish and stupid.      >>i told him i wanted space for a while to set him up for a break up. he thinks this is out of no where.    so how do i do this right? im afraid he's going to vandelise my house or something...how do i stop this friendship ultimatly? last time i stopped being friends with someone it was a lot easier because we were new friends and we were fighting.   i just want to stop being friends with him, and he has no clue.

20090309090756AABeL0x	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	A spouse breaking a promise....?	Let's say you and your spouse had an agreement either before you got married or shortly after. You both agreed to something and both said if the other broke the promise you'd consider it a betrayal. If your spouse broke the promise, how would you feel? Divorce? Stay together? Thanks!! P.S. An example would be agreeing upon 3 children and than your spouse says no only one.

20090227145624AAlfRrH	Family & Relationships;Friends	WHat can I do? (friend problem) Should I be pissed?	Ok so a few months ago me and my friends got into trouble for something we didnt know we could get in trouble for. Then one of my friend's mom said it was mainly our (me and my other friend's) fault and we were bad influences.      Then her mom told her not to hang out with us (but she still does)      but then she keeps on bringing up that her mom says were bad influences and she agrees.      Its starting to piss me off cause it's been several months since that incident.      Then now whenever we talk about our best features she goes like "all your features are bad"      But when we got in trouble it wasnt just me and my other friends fault, but she and her mom acts like we made her do it, when she wanted to.      and she got really pissed when my other friend said "hi" to her infront of her mom      and she scribbled out the faces of people she hated in her yearbook, and blamed it on me and my friend.      i think she and her mom just needs to accept the fact that it was partially her fault she got in trouble, cause she could have said "no"

Her name is Jaime and recently, she's been whining all over me, saying that she hates her name so much and that she wants her name to be something like mine, Sophie. I told her that her name's not that common, so it's good, but she says that it sounds so ugly and that it reminds her of a stupid celebrity who bears the same name: Jaime Spears, I guess?    I've been thinking of suggesting her to change her name or something, but it didn't seem likely at all, cuz all the people in our school have known her as Jaime all their lives and it wouldn't work if we were to change her name all of a sudden. What should I do to make her feel better?

20090309090450AAGT64D	Family & Relationships;Friends	What do i do about a friend that is stealing from the poor?	One of my best friends parents run a homeless shelter in the area. The transients living there hardly see any of the donations once the volunteers are done rifling through it. Her parents use the money donated to go to Disney World and other various vacations. This girl is constantly bragging about all the free stuff she gets and it is making me sick. How would I go about reporting them? I am past the point of feeling bad that she's my best bud. Help me help the poor.

20090227145051AAiP4n9	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Guys do girls who like electronics/technology turn you off?	im honest here. do guys prefer real "girls" or girls who like more guyish stuff?   like, everyone i know who gets the guys is uber girly. ive never had a bf, and im kinda dorky. whenever i go to the mall the only place i can go to for an extended time is the music/dvd or electronics stores...or food court. (as you can imagine my girlfriends hate mall trips with me. XD) and i love computers and stuff like building rc cars, tinkering with things like circuits, or taking things apart to see how they work, or make things out of their parts.   i mean, im girly kinda...i like make up and dressing nice, but detest shopping.   does this suck? could it play a part in my never having had a bf? i am in 10th grade only, tho.

20090227150101AAwaKGE	Family & Relationships;Family	Help. Family is an *** to me.?	I think I just need to vent...   No you do not need to read it. But if you are just going to leave pathetic  thoughts that waste your time and mine, just leave this page now then...   Well..to the whole "Suicidal thoughts" I've been cutting myself for over 3 years (arms,legs, etc.) Mostly about my family being and asshole to me. My parents never let me have a LIFE, sure they let me hang out with my cousins every...YEAR. But they won't even let me hang out with my friends from school once in a while. For example I wanted to hang out with my friends at the park, but when I came home she started ranting about girls getting raped, do i just text all day in class(No I do not text in class), forgetting everything she says, If I have a boyfriend and just wants to hang out with that boyfriend to have sex..(no i do not have a boyfriend. Heck...we didn't even want to hang out with guys. It was all going to be GIRLS hanging out), and something about I was going to hang out with my cousin tomorrow so why **** around and hang out with friends today?      My mom always does this. Takes simple little things and turns them over dramatic. She once thought I was sneeking out the house and that I have my own corner -_-. When I just stay in my room and play guitar. But it always pisses me off that she doesn't know ANYTHING about me and doesn't let me have my own life. She barely lets me listen to the music I LIKE, dress the way I like(pants, normal shirt.) She wants me to wear skirts dresses...all short. So like a slut she wants me to. She rearranges my room without permission. Heck..its like she wants me to live the way she wants. I already do great in school..going to Honor classes. I play music. What else does she WANT from me!?!?!   But all this equals me getting pissed off and ending in a result of suicidal thoughts and cutting.    Do you have any ideas what I should do to stop before I actually die and have a ACTUAL life with my mom being nice at least?   Ps. Talking to her doesn't help. She never listens. She always give me the "silent treatment." And changes the subject about something i don't do.   Pss. I also thought moving out with a friend or having them put me up for adoption since I can't stand them. And they can't stand me :/ Oh and I am 14. I know I am young...just try any age and dealing with this ****.

20090308220506AAGePq0	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	Okay, my thoughts on my soon to be ex-wife are really confusing me?	Long story short, on Jan 29, 2009 my wife walked out on me.  Neither one of us was happy being married to the other and she moved out  live with her Dad.  We'd talked about starting the paperwork for the divorce approx two weeks after she got settled in.  This was not a problem.  I filed for it, she was served the paperwork, and short of waiting to hear back from the courts I pretty much don't think of her.  It's just easier that way.      So...my question is, why is it that during my average day I can keep busy enough and find enough things to do that I don't stop to think of her but if I have even one dream about her I'm an emotional wreck the next morning?  I mean, usually I'm really good at keeping my emotions in check...but that just sets things off.  What's up with that?

20090308231659AAo0xuM	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	What to do in my marriage?	I work full time and my husband was laid off at his job.  He has been stressed out and depressed due to our financial situation.  It seems as though everything fell at once. Foreclosure notice, no refund on taxes, bills piling up blah blah blah.  Anyway, basically I go to work everyday, when I get home...nothing is done....absolutely nothing.  He takes care of our 3 year old when I am at work, and gets the boys off the bus and ensures that their homework has been completed.  But as far as cleaning...nothing.  I don't know how long I can keep it up.  I have tried talking to him, but he just explodes and then completely closes off.  He will not discuss it...too the point of even sleeping on the couch just to avoid talking to me about our marriage.  I have tried everything from asking nicely to ignoring the mess and nothing has worked.  This has always been an issue of ours, but usually I wouldn't gripe so much if it now is him being the stay at home parent.  During our five years together, he has always been the half butt kind of guy, even when I would say "fill the tank up and I will go pay for it", I would get into the car only to realize it was only half full.  There are some very rare times that I will say hey did you get any cleaning done today, and he would blow up and say..."I did a whole load of dishes" or "I put a load of laundry in the washer", he has never cleaned a bathtub, mopped a floor or anything.  Not even the manly stuff, well, sometimes he will mow the yard in the summer, but its rare, we have so much stuff that could be done around the house that would be considered "manly" but he won't do that either...I had to finish a tiling job that he started in the dining room because he didn't finish it.  Same with the wallpaper in the living room.  Please help, I love him so much and want it to work, but at the same time the more I think about how much he's not helping..it just makes me even more upset.  Any advice would be wonderful and thank you for your advice.
20090309053001AAoyBYo	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	My girlfreind of 1 year still tells her ex-husband/child of her son, that she loves him?	I've been going out with my girlfriend for a year now and she was married before and has a 4 year old child. Now she had been going out with her exhusband for 3 years. From what she has told me, he's lazy, never helps out, never seems interested and will never change. Yet they talk everyday either on the phone or on IM. I can understand her talking to him since he's her son's father, but all the bad stuff she's said about him makes me wonder why. One time I even caught them talking, saying how he had gotten a webcam and she said now she can watch him J*** off. I confronted her about it, it actually made my heart drop, and she ended up getting all upset herself saying how she always messes things up and she was just joking to him and I don't know how they joke with eachother.       She swears that I have nothing to worry about, she'll never go back to him, but I still catch her sometimes saying she loves him... she's just f**king with my heart now and I do love her, but she keeps giving me these mixed signals is making it hard for me ..      Is there any logic behind her actions? Confronting her doesn't seem to help anymore, she seems like she gets annoyed when I ask her about it.

20090309080306AAZji5b	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	A little more detail?	thank you all for the advice on my first question.but let me give you a little more detail.We met in 01 cause i was in a dead end relationship(sorta like now) and she was in a abusive relationship...made to be a servant and raped ...We hooked up and basically told him and her to go fuqq themselves.She had a son who was 6 at the time and has let it be know verbally that he wish I would die so that he could have his family back...Fast forward to 03  and she thought I was cheating on her just because she didnt like the fact I had female friends(mind you we worked the same job ,same hours and all that ) but it turned out she was the one in the wrong cause she sent pics of herself to a guy on the internet(naked) and at first denied it till I showed her and she just broke down and said I wasnt there for her(wtf ever that means)...we did the trial seperation and reconciled ..But now it is a problem for her to cook a hot meal for our kids before 9pm or if she does laundry she ends up having to wash the clothes again cause they have sat in the washer(ya know and get that mildew ,sour smell to them)so in order for my household to have clean clothes I do the laundry every sunday..all day ..Her oldest son washes dishes that have been in the sink all week ..My 7 and 5 year old help out by "cleaning" the bathroom..I have to ask her to help out with our house and it is like pulling teeth.Like yesterday i was folding the laundry and she came in from work and was like can you move this stuff so I can sit down and I was like it is your stuff she was like well put it in the room(HER STUFF BUT SHE WANTS ME TOO PUT IN THE ROOM)I just walked away....my brother came over so she decides to go into our bedroom close the door and watch food network(as always) I thought that was rude and called her out on it she said she didnt even realize he was there..Then at 7 I was fixing the kids dinner and get them in the tub and she was like I was gonna cook and I was like when and she was like well you got it back to food network...I asked her what is up and she said and I quote...HERE WE GO AGAIN GUESS YOU WANT SUM OR SHOULD I JUST GET ON MY KNEES....Long story short I slept on the couch.I feel like this marriage is going down the drain and i cant stop it.I did the go out once a week thing...didnt work...try to get her into some kinda counseling but she feels that is putting our business in the streets...my question is how big a part is sex and communication to a relationship and how can I convey this to her?

20090309090601AA1FgMa	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	I fell in love with married Arab women. What to do?	Hi,   I know this is too weird but it's true. I came to one of the arab country and  here I met this Arab girl who works in my office. She is married and loves her husband a lot.   Initially I didn't have any feelings for her and we used to talk a lot. We became good friends. She is an attractive women.    As the time passed almost after 7 months I fell in deep love with her. I expressed my feelings to her for which she had a sympathy for me. I became more nervous for the fact I couldn't get her. I knew she was married but some factor in me forced me to fall in love with her. I almost express my every feeling about her to her. She has become very good friend of mine now.    She is very traditional and conservative. I didn't even touch her yet. She refuses to come out with me. But she talks to me even better than before after knowing my feelings abt her. She texts me and send me lot of emails. She never hurts my feelings even if I cross the limit while talking.   Once i fought with her and didn't talk to her for a week. I was very sad that time and even she was upset. I started to talk to her first. Actually for anything I have to start the communication.   I am in very deep love with her and she knows it very well. There is hardly any time when I don't think about her.      Why doesn't she break all contacts with me? Why she sends me so many mails and messages? Why is she being so nice to me even knowing I love her? Why does she entertain my talk about how much I love her?      Life has become very difficult for me. I am not able to get over the feelings about her. Sometimes I decide not to talk to her but I can't resist it for a long. After a month I will go back to my country.      Please help me.

20090309110149AAY6TM7	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	Men - open for your opinion of sex after marriage. . . .?	LOL - just wondering what your thoughts are on the subject. Originally I posted this for women only and was told I needed to get the mans opinion on the subject.  So here goes.      When we got together over 4 years ago, we broke records for the number of times we would get it on in a day.  I showed him things he had never experienced before.  Let him do things he had only dreamed of.  My husband complains (almost daily) about not getting it enough. I don't have a problem with sex unless it is guilt-ed upon me.  I love him very much and thought we were still on the higher than average side of how often we get it on. He even complains mow when he does get it everyday that it is just not enough. Usually the complaint is because its just not spicy enough, but when I hold out for a couple days, its plenty spicy.  Not to say I withhold sex from him at all.  Maybe we were just too tired or whatever and end up not having it for a couple days.      I just don't get it! He is so confusing. I just want to know how other married couples handle it.  Do men guilt women into having sex?  If so, How do you handle it?      Thanks!!
20090309103139AAWSC8m	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	This guy and I who have great chemistry everytime we talk...there are rumors he has a gf...?!?	This guy and I have been friends for a year, but only because we have all the same mutual friends. We've gone out to dinner and for smoothies and played pool, but it was always in a group. And we've talked a few times on chat and in person, but not very much. Everytime we do see each other or talk though, its this amazing chemistry and its like there is nobody else in the room and we just love talking to each other and he's looking at me the whole time practically. Well, recently his facebook status went to "in a relationship" and I guess he's been dating a girl for a while now, but I've never seen her, he never mentions her, and no pics of them. Is it just one of those jokes you think?? Mutual friends have never mentioned her either...is it ok to keep flirting with him?

20090309103229AAeH2T7	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Guys, would you be mad if your gf/fiance did this?	I've been together with my man for almost 3 years, but last summer we broke up for a few months, during which he had a very short fling (3 weeks tops) with a girl from another state while he was out of town for work. They have not seen each other since then, and that was over 6 months ago. We got back together right after he got back and he wants to get married.       She calls and texts him off the hook. She was facebooking him constantly and he finaly just deleted her. She flipped out and keeps texting and calling. He called her and told her to stop (I was there) I also checked his phone and saw that he hasn't responded to any of her texts (all of which say, Why won't you talk to me? and "I still want to keep talking" and "I hate your gf")       I am sick of it and am seriously considering sending her an email and telling her to bug off once and for all. (I am not as sweet as my bf) If your gf did this, would it make you mad? this has been going on for 6 months and I'm sick of it.

20090309105201AAkO9zV	Family & Relationships;Friends	How can you tell if a friend will be a good housemate?	I chose to live with this girl last year because we were good friends, she's neat and tidy, good with food and her two friends were also moving in with us and they were nice too.      This year she's turned out to be a nightmare. She's very two-faced, always gossiping. No one in the world can possibly be, or is allowed to be anywhere near a good a cook as her. Although neither of us are particularly different, I've just realised there's something about our living styles that's too conflicting.      However, looking back there was no way of forseeing this. I was wondering, how can you generally tell if someone's going to be a good housemate or not, because she was absolutely fine in the two years I knew her?       There are many of my home friends I would happily move in with but after this experience, it makes me think twice.
20090309094342AA7XScJ	Family & Relationships;Friends	I feel so lonely... I need help?	Hey there, this might be long so please bare with me. I'm turning 18 in 2 weeks, I just left my job due to new management, and I'm graduated from school. I was home schooled since I was 15 years old, and it's been hard to meet new people. My brother moved out in December to live with his wife, and I basically feel completely isolated. I don't know what to do anymore, I feel like I'm the only friend I have. I'm having surgery done on my ankle on March 27th, so I can't get a job until after the 3 months recovery, which means I'll be sitting at home doing nothing. I don't feel like there is anyone I can talk to, I can just imagine now, sitting at home for 3 months, waking up every day just to sit there and do nothing but think about how sad my life is.      I feel depressed about this.. most of the friends I had are either locked up, or smoke weed all day and watch TV, they never want to come outside to chill or anything.      I also don't have a girlfriend, which contributes to my loneliness, but what girl is going to want to date a guy in crutches?      Any advice? Thank you in advance..

20090309113516AAraTwO	Family & Relationships;Family	What should I do about my son's father?	My son's father has only seen him once in the last 6 months.  He used to see him every other weekend.  I don't know what has changed or what is going on in his life that he won't see his son anymore.  We don't know where he lives.  He does not have a phone number where we can reach him.  I bought him a trac phone & paid to have minutes added to it so we could contact him, but he lost it in the first month.  It really hurts me to see that my son is so used to it.  My son used to cry when his dad didn't pick him up on the weekends, now he doesn't even mention it.  It's like he knows his dad is not coming.  I don't want to give up hope on his dad, but I don't know what to do. In the past I have had long talks with him telling him he needs to be a better father & keep his word when he says he is going to pick up his son.  But I got tired of the same old speech & him promising he would change & it would only last for less then a week.  Should I just cut him out of our lives & never mention him again or should I try & find out where he is & what is going on that is keeping him from seeing his son.  I just want to do whatever is best for my son.  Please give me your advice.

Recently rejection and i have gone hand and hand and its starting to hurt my self esteem. anyway, i was out at the bars this past friday and i met this girl. she was about to go home, but somehow she ended up staying another hour hanging out with me. i complimented her on her beauty. i asked her why a pretty girl like her would talk to a guy like me, and she said because im nice and im cute. so i did end up kissing her in the bar, and as well as making out with her outside when she was leaving. i did get her number and she told me she would answer if i called and would like to go out sometime. the only thing is, is that she was drinking. and in my mind she is out of my league, although a friend of mine tells me she isnt. so i called her yesterday and she answered, the best part is she knew who was calling and still answered. she was sick though, so i told her i would call her another time, tomorrow... she said ok, but she has to work so if she doesnt answer to definitely leave a message. i told her ok, and that i would call her tomorrow night. how do i go about getting a date with this girl, even if i believe she is too good for me and i think she might see that too. i definitely want to see her again, but i dont want to be rejected yet again. any good advice? could she be interested?

20090309095516AAUcd0E	Family & Relationships;Friends	I got an ex best mate problem. SHES DRIVING ME INSANE!!?	my mate and i met in 4th grade were in 9th grade now. When we first met we were inseparable the best of mates things were fine until 6th grade when i went away for the week and she made new friends i had no problem with that i was so happy for her because she really wanted to be popular but so did i and i didn't have no friends. She went off with them and i was on my own i spent all most every night crying. Then it was the end of the school year. We met in the holiday and we was best mates again as i always liked it. Then in 7th grade  someone close to her died i was there for her all the time then she pushed me away and got into a huge argument with her. I asked my mom for advice and she responded "let her get on with it but if she needs you be there for her" i did that then she got over it. In 8th Grade we were okay But she met more people in out new school and so did i. We were off doing our own thing. Then her mate came up saying i was backstabbing her behind her back. Which i didn't. In P.E she started to shout out "BEAST"  to me and my mate i felt like punching her in the face. I confessed to somebody that she was being nasty. Things were at the usual place at okay. Then all of a sudden she said that she was "ALLEGEDLY" being bullied and took about a year off school. Shes come back but shes changed. When she was off she went on cam and slit her wrists and showed everyone. Also on cam she showed to her mate how she was going to kill herself.  Now shes back everyone of her mates which are my mates hates her and i mean really hates her. Shes threatened one of my mates today and when my other mate got pushed on the floor she got badly hurt. Her leg was cut open and bleeding. Me and my mate who i was walking with helped her up and she burst out laughing shouting "BABY'S" i felt even more mad. Shes been talking about me all day. Shes also being me to me and my boyfriend. Because she fancies him. He kissed me on the cheek today then she pushed me on the floor and then he helped me up and we both waked off. What can i do? Shes so mean? I don't know i told her i had ENOUGH shes not taking it though. if shes homicidal and suicidal i don't want to be round someone like that because my bro committed suicide but i found him in time. He did that because he has asbergus and thought hed come back as a super hero. I found him in time tho. it reminds me of that. What can i do?

And then I was just like, I'm gonna get a drink I'll meet up with you to both of them.      After I got my drink I saw that my shy friend was sitting alone and my crush was with a friend, so I said with my friend.       I guess I sorta blew her off, but I didn't mean to! Is there any way I can un-do what I did? I do this kind of thing all the time, like if 2 people want me to be their partner for a project, I say yes to both of them. Anyways, how can I fix this?
20090309095321AAcDxaL	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	How should I apologize?	So, a few days ago I was teezing the girl I like a lot just as a joke, but I think she might of taken it serously and was offended.  So, I really feel like I need to apologize to her, but I don't know how.        What if she really didn't take it seriously and was just playing?  I don't want to go up to her and be like "I'm really sorry about what I said the other day, I didn't mean it at all!"  and for her to say, "What are you talking about?"      So how do you think I should do it?  I really feel like I ought to and don't want to take any chances by not doing it.  Any pointers?

20090309104633AAjLYER	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Some help here please?	First of all this will be long so please no harassments, judgements and accusations.      Second of all I have a rare disease that prevented me from reaching puberty until age 23. I see an endocrinologist and he put me on birth control pills to produce and maintain estrogen.      I want to go to a missions college and a friend of mine is helping me imrpove a lot in one year so I can be able to go and she said to befriend her husband so he can be a refrence too.      Remember when I said I just reached puberty last summer? I'm 24 now and I am a horny son of a gun. Now please keep in mind I would NEVER get involved with a married man and I am against adultery. I live in a small town where every guy is married. This couple is 40. I'd date single guys 24-40.      Now I don't see that dream of going to a missions college come true because now I'm romantically attracted to my friend's husband. So I'm running away from him, temptation and my church and going somewhere else. I want to go to a missions college but with my raging hormones I can't deal with it and I never act on it but still! The last guy(who moved away) I was first sexually attracted to, everytime he was around I wanted to tear off his clothes and devour him(he was single but now has a girlfriend).      What would you do if you were me? Would you ditch the missions dream and move to a big city and meet single people? Or what?      The husband and wife know because they'll know why I am running. She said I can't keep running everytime I run into a godly guy I'm attracted to. Well yeah I do if he's married!      And I have to have a male friend refrence in order to apply but I can't do that with my raging hormones!   I have a personal relationship with Christ and I pray everyday read bible everyday and do bible studies everyday and give all my problems to him everyday.
20090309091130AAK0SP6	Family & Relationships;Friends	What to do about a friend?	I was writing to a friend who I met through answers when I first joined. This woman is absolutely lovely - I didn't come on for a long time so didn't write to her. It was only limited to yahoo answers and there was nothing in it except friendship. Only I wrote to her again and she answered but I got to sorting other things and didn't reply back. Now I have written to her 3 times and I don't get an answer? I don't know what I have done wrong. What can I do to get this person to write to me again?

I've been with my girlfriend for 8 months.My girlfriend and I went to a party and some other girl wanted to have sex with me so I refused her. Even though my girlfriend and I aren't making love, is what I did right? I have strong feelings for my girlfriend and I love her. I couldn't bear the thought of her being hurt. That's the last thing she need to worry about. I am definitely not going to cheat on her ever.
20090309113634AAh5nTB	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	How do I admit this to my girlfriend?	My girlfriend and I have been together for 8 months already. I'm very much fallen in love with her. I really want to tell her "I love you" but I am scared of her not saying it back to me. It's the way she makes me feel when I am cuddling with her, holding hands, her laying her head on my shoulder when we are sitting next to each other, hugging her, and making her out (me stroking her back also).

20090309092713AAL2yj8	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Why does she find sex so embarrassing?	I was trying to get my friend to come to the cinema with me today (to see watchmen, no less. :) ) , but she has problems going to the cinema. She was telling me that when she gets really embarrassed (to the point where she has to leave the room)  when it appears on tv or in a film. She can't even look at naked bodies and finds sex with her partner awkward sometimes. I don't know what advice to give her, but I just want her to be ok with all this, she wants to get her confidence back in going to the cinema and stuff. And for the sake of her boyfriend.  I think her upbringing may have encouraged this. There's no way she'll see a counsellor or anything. What advice can i give her? Only serious answers, thank you. :)

20090309104133AAH1N82	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	I want her to KNOW that i want her?	but that I'm not gonna just sit here and wait on her.... i mean i seriously beleive that she and I would be great together (and she thnks the same thing) but due to her current situation ( got out of a relationship a few mos ago) she doesnt want to get serious and wants time to herself and "be young" as she put it.  I'm 24 and she is 21.  anyway, I don't want her to take my kindness and patience for granted  and think that I'm gonna just sit here and wait on her.  So anyway, i was wanting to know, how can i communicate to her to " take the time she NEEDS to get her stuff together, but please don't take as long as you WANT"... u know what i mean?  I mean, i thought that if I just stand out amongst the other men, by being more of a gentleman to her and supportive and trusting and what not, that i could win her over.... but after almost 2 months in dating, so to speak, SHE STILL SAYING THE SAME THING! so anyway I love her and she loves me to, we've actually communicated that we're in love with eachother, and she says that she needs this time to be her own woman and what not NOW bc she really cares about me and feels that this will be better for us in the future when we decide to make it official....so anyway i thought that if i could show her that "her putting me on the back burner" is just making me an option for another woman than maybe that'll get her attention??? but i don't want to chase her away bc i really want to be with her... and yes she knows this.  so plz tips advice???

I am not ugly and actually many of my friends think I am pretty. The problem is that I have been single for 3 years now. I have been very patient and when someone seems to be interested in me, I encourage them without being too forward. But nothing... I have some guy friends and we hang out together as a group, but no one seems to be "interested" in me. Well, I am sick and tired, don't tell me to be patient and that love will come when I least expect it because, I have been waiting for so long... Well now, I have been chatting with some people on plentyoffish.com , and I seem to get more people interested in me that way. Well I know that to get to know "real" people is much better than just internet, but I am kind of out of options here. Any good advice? Your opinion is appreciated.

20090309092223AAPbUAd	Family & Relationships;Family	Am I wrong for being upset with my husband?	My husband was adopted sixteen years ago at the age of nine, but when he became of legal age, decided to start a relationship with his biological family.  Because he was adopted at an older age, he remembers his biological family well and forgives them for the mistakes that they have made (which is a wonderful quality about him).  I am due to have our second son in just three short weeks and both of our families (both biological and adoptive) are excited and wish to visit us.  Here is where the problem is... While I see NO problem in having my husband's adoptive father visiting us (as he did with our first son), I see a HUGE problem in having his biological grandmother making the trip.      I do NOT see myself as the bitter wife who hates her in-laws, but I don't see why this woman, whom I have met only one time, seven years ago, deserves to be here.  She didn't show up to our wedding, she didn't visit us when our first son was born and she has never come to "just visit."  On top of that, she, without informing us, purchased a plane ticket and has made plans to stay with us for ONE MONTH, since she can't afford a hotel, to "help" me with the new baby.      My husband assures me that his biological grandmother is very trustworthy and a wonderful person (which I am sure she is), but I don't know her and don't trust her with either of my children alone (as I find her lying to me during many of our phone conversations).  My husband has asked me to "suck it up" and do this for him (as any good wife would), but I can't seem to bring myself into accepting this.  Am I wrong?  What should I do?  Would it be inappropriate for ME to ask her to please cancel her month long stay with us because I don't feel comfortable?

I sent a second email saying thank you for your friendship but if we aren't speaking anymore please stop sending me your junk joke emails. To that she sent me another junk email about friendship and they are here for a season, a reason, or a lifetime but I had to send it to 7 friends in 7 minutes or I would get a flat tire or some other plaque would bestow me. Didn't even have the nerve or take the effort to say yeah you too good times - peace out. What is the most BS way someone has broken up with you!! Lets hear it! Spill it!!
20090309094757AAL74Uu	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Hurt - again and again and again and I'm not even with him anymore. Why?	My ex was verbally and emotionally abusive, in addition to being extremely manipulative and making believe I was worthless, ie. at 30 I'd get nobody else. I left him 7 months ago after a year of enduring this.      I'm able to see that leaving him was the best possible thing I could have done. I feel ashamed that I put up with it for so long and embarrassed at how stupid I was. I don't miss the relationship but I do sometimes look back with 'rose-tinted glasses'.      I was having a nostalgic moment this morning and was thinking of some of the things we used to do together. He used to write blogs online of all the gigs he'd been to so this morning I had a look (though I feel stupid for doing this anyway as I didn't even have fun at any gigs with him generally) to re-read the reviews he'd written of the gigs we'd attended together.      It seems he's been a busy bee and has written new reviews. One was a review of an Alkaline Trio (yuck) gig he'd been to and he'd written that they performed 'Goodbye Forever' followed immediately by 'Emma' with no gap between songs. He then wrote "Goodbye Forever Emma - this has incredible significance for me! Those are the words to live by!" In obvious reference to me...       Why has this hurt me? I feel disappointed in myself for even feeling this way - what the hell is wrong with me?      There's been a spate of ignorant answers lately so please don't comment if you can't refrain from being rude.      Sorry for lengthy question - wanted to be thorough. Thanks in advance...

20090309092955AAViPoV	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Would this be a turn-off to women?	Note: This question is more oriented towards high school/college women.       Would it be a turn off if a guy was getting a college education, but actually not enrolled at a college? For example, the guy is majoring in computers, and has found a curriculum, and a certificate program, and wants to follow that, because he prefers freedom.      So, the guy would be doing the curriculum mentioned above, and earning his certificates, and learning the trade he is majoring in. Would you consider yourself more educated than him?      If it is a turn off, why is it?

20090309102546AA1XQNn	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	My husband's ex-fiancee contacted me to tell me...?	my husband was in touch with her and she thought me and him "needed to talk"...      my husband won't discuss it or anything else. he refuses marriage counseling, he refuses to tell me how he's feeling or why he's shutting me out. i read the email he sent to his ex-fiancee and it said he was lost and can't stop thinking about her and that this was the biggest mistake he's ever made and he never wanted this (i am guessing he meant our marriage) when i confronted him he said i didn't know the context, when i asked him to explain the context he said i'd already made up my mind so there was no point talking about it      i'd like to point out at first i was angry but by the time i actually tried to talk to him about it i had calmed down, i wasn't yelling, i really just wanted to know what was going on...      he's fine now as long as i don't mention it, our fight, or the fact that that night he never came home (he won't say where he was or what he did) but i don't know if i can keep living in the dark like this, he's given me no reason to trust him and i don't know what to do...      i want to save our marriage, i don't want a divorce, i just don't know how to be strong enough to handle his attitude and anger - it makes me irrational and over-emotional and very insecure about our relationship when i find out he's been telling other women he can't stop thinking about them, especially when it's his ex-fiancee...

I want to take antidepressants again because they work for me (I am going to counceling as well, don′t worry) Me and my husband are having marital problems now- for the first time in 17 years btw, and that′s affecting my performance at my job, I don′t sleep well,cry every day and have mild panic attacks...   MY QUESTION: my husband is strongly against me taking antidepressants again because he doesn′t want me "to be drugged"    I don′t even know if we′ll stay togehter and I think the issue of taking antidepresants or not is between me and my doctor, am I right???      the thing is if I do take them again and he finds out he will be furious and might even leave me...I am all for honesty and always have been but in this situation maybe I should take them behind his back? or should I just go ahead (if my doctors agrees) and tell him to mind his own business?????????please tell me your opnion.

I took my little girl to the playground to meet some little friends, and she made a couple, nice little playmates.  My daughter is 15 months, went over to this little boy, and the mother was like, "Don't touch him" to my daughter. I looked down and saw her hands had some dirt on them, from falling.  She said..."He doesn't like dirt." I said, well she was not dirty but fell.  Then she says to my daughter.."So you like being dirty huh?"  What a b*tch.  My little girl is beautiful and sweet, and gentle, AND CLEAN she is very outgoing and goes right up to kids, is not afraid.  But this mother was a stuck up biatch. How would you handle this situation.  I mumbled under my breath, "What kind of boy doesn't like dirt."

20090309101841AAnA74W	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Do I really deserved better than this?	All my life I have been treated bad by people that are the same age as me. Guys throw stuff at me and pick on me just because I have a big head and girls treat me like I don't deserved to live and both of them treat me like I deserved to be treated this way and it is not fair.   I deserved someone that really cares about me and respects me and I could care less what race she is from. I"m tired of being stared at and made fun      I need some advice on how I should deal with these feelings for this girl.These feelings for her are so strong and I don't know what to do.No matter what I do she always treat me like I mean nothing to her   7 years ago people of my school told that this girl liked me and then when I try to talk to her she always ignore, she doesn't say hi or anything. We knew each other since the 4th grade and we supposed to be friends but she speaks to everyone but me. When school is out she always wave good-bye to me. At middle school she doesn't wave to me or talk to me but she does it to everyone. I doubt she is really a friend because friends always talk to each other. Maybe it was a rumor started by her classmates. I feel like I deserved someone better, someone that treats me right and wants to be my friend. Me and her were classmates in the 4th grade and 5th grade but she has never said one to me and I can't believe someone that doesn't talk to me still thinks she my friend. Whats the point of liking someone that pretends to be your friend and always ignore you and doesn't say one word to you period. Maybe having these feelings are a waste of time because I deserved someone better than her. I don't know why I have these feelings for a girls that treats me this   what should I do?   these feelings for her they won't go away   I know I deserved someone better but these feelings for her I just can't get rid of them.   The girls around me are just like her.   They both treat me bad. When girls see me they just treat me like I don't exist. Maybe I should be in a different race and maybe people would stop treating me bad and girls of my race would like me and respect me.

Thought he wouldn't call me back because I slept with him. Lo and behold, he called back!! I told him I thought he wouldn't call back because I slept with him and that is NOT like me.

I know I have heard of “wet dreams” but I thought this was something that happened while going through puberty for boys and he is 34 so well past that point.
20090309101256AA5kRh4	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Do parents eventually come around if you marry without their blessing?	Me and my boyfriend have so much in common and he is everything I want in a man.I am everything he wants in a woman.We want to get married this year.We met late last year. My parents were so suspicious and they are still kind of being too protective just because we met via an online dating service. I am steady telling them that plenty of successful marriages are out there by people who met via internet dating.I am reading some success stories of people who met via the internet who are still happily married. Not everyone online is a sick pervert.My parents are such worry warts just because I'm their only.   We are going to get married with or without their blessing.   They also need to bare in mind that since I'm their only child, that if they want to see their future grandchildren that they need to come around eventually.They are always going on and on about how they want to be grandparents.Well like it or not he will be the father of their future grandchildren.   I'm a grown woman.I'm 27 years old and I am fully capable of making great decisions as I many times do and I have faith in God.   I wanted to hold the marriage off for another year as to not incur their wrath, but this is my life and I'm an adult and I'm not their little girl anymore and they really need to calm down.I'm not going to be single for the rest of my life just to satisfy them and they need to get with the new century and realize that a lot of couples are meeting via the Internet and most of the stories I read and see are successful.   Do parents come around if you marry without their blessing?   And especially since they want grandchildren so bad and I'm the only way they're going to have grandchildren, since I'm their only child?

20090309092421AAgdOYE	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	I had a dream last night, virginity, older man, enjoyed it?	I’m 15 turning 16 in 46 days. I’ve never had sex and to be honest think sexual intercourse in general is just gross, and pointless unless someone is trying to reproduce. I do no a lot about sex even though I’ve never had it, I read a lot of Cosmopolitan (I.e. sex moves, tips, things men enjoy) I’m around my very open mother and sister, movies, music.       I had a dream last night where I was losing my virginity and actually enjoyed it in the dream a lot! If I think sex is just stupid why in my dream was I enjoying it? I was also losing it to an older man who I’ve never seen before, ever… I do find older men attractive; I never think any boys my age or in school good looking and I never fall for those Disney stars, usually I go for celebrities in there 30’s early 40’s, Robert Knepper, Nicolas Cage. (It seemed like I was older in the dream)      Before I went to bed I did watch a movie that had a sex scene in it… would that be the reason why I had that dream? If not than help!

I told her to stop joking and that i am jsut having fun with her, and she told me that she really like me but that she prefers if we didnt see each other anymore, at least for a while.      i was quite angry at her, specially becuase i didnt undersantd her reasons for taking that decision. so i just took her to her house and i havent talk to her or anything for almost one week.       what should i do, should I jsut forget about her ? should i tell her to stop being a striper and that i will pay for her education ( i have a lot of money ) ? or sohuld i just tell her to tell me the truth and i will tell her what i feel and maybe work something out ?.       what shoud i do ?.

Although this makes it easier for me to ask her out, I have no idea what to say to her without sounding completely random. I also don't know when to talk to her, as we only have one class together and it's history, where you don't talk hardly. She's very shy and neither of us has spoken since she found out I like her.

I have knee injuries, shoulder, chest injuries..etc etc. I have ear problems, etc etc. I can walk but sometimes it's hard.      Most normal women, want to enjoy fun times with their mates, they dont want to stay in the house with a guy who can't move much.

I'm shy, and i dont like social stuff or going to public crowded places, which is where people go to have fun.      I'm just a simple man with hobbies and dont like Social outgoing stuff.      Anyways, am I still something women would desire  even if i'm disabled and shy????       Keep in mind,, SHY has also been the reason why I'm not successful and i dont have a good job.      I'm 29 male.

I have told him I don't like doing those things but he continues to watch it on the internet. I don't like it when he watches it on the internet now because then he gets disappointed when I won't do those things and it makes me feel like I can't fulfill he's needs. when I tell him I don't like to do those things he says its okay, but I can tell he's disappointed and he continues to look at it on the computer. what should I do?

If you are married and your friend you have known for 10 years needs a place to lay their head.  Just because your wife or husband say they don't want house guest and you don't have money to give them to get a hotel or so and they don't have no where else to go. Would you tell them no, or would you say yes and listen to the husband or wife mouth later?
20090309093054AAf8iDu	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Does my co-worker like me?!?!?!?	Ok, so my co-worker...we'll call him Bob, we're really good friends. I like him a lot (as a friend) and I just found out he's moving in a few weeks. Of course, I was the last one at work to find out and I was kinda hurt that he didn't tell me to my face. That I had to hear from another co-worker. So when I asked about it... he told me he was moving. I don't want him to go! I Love working with him. We always have so much fun. Now, I'm engaged...he knows that. He doesn't like my fiance for reasons unknown to me. And when I told him I didn't want him to go he said "What do you care?! You have a boyfriend who you supposedly (he did the quotation signs) "Love" So why do you care if I leave?!"    Now this threw me completely off guard. I didn't know what to say or think. When I thought about it..it sounded like he liked me..but I'm not sure?! And I don't want to straight up ask if he likes me because what if I'm completely off?!
20090309092424AAjN95V	Family & Relationships;Weddings	Is this good wording on a save the date cards if my fiance has divorced parents?	I just wrote up my save the date cards. I wanted to go the traditional way and include our parents (since my parents are paying for most of it and his Mom is paying for part of it). But I thought it would be rude if I used my parents, his Mom but not his Dad. So here is how I worded it.      I used fake names for the example!      Mr. And Mrs. John Smith (my parents)   and Mrs. Stacey Brown (his Mom, with her re-married last name)   along with Mr. Marvin Proctor (his Dad)   ask that you kindly save the date of   April 24th, 2010   to share in the joy   of the wedding celebration of their children   Molly Malone (me) and Jason Proctor (my fiance)   in Cavendish, PEI      Invitation and details to follow.      ___________________________      Okay so that is how I wordered it. My parents are still together but his mom and dad are divorced. And I didn't want to put his Mom and Dad together, do you think the "along with" his Dad part gets the message across that they are NOT together? I mean, most of our guests will know this but does it look alright on paper? I also put the line breaks where they will be, like his Mom won't be on the same line as his Dad.      Yes the place is made up too!
20090309103333AAhcsYV	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Should I move in?????????	I have been dating my boyfriend for almost 2 years now. Im 21 and since I have moved out of my parents house I have always lived with my sister. I just recently made the decision to live on my own. I got an apartment not too far from my boyfriends house and I love it love it love it. Its perfect. I enjoy having a place of my own so much!!! I got a puppy and life is good. I would stay at my house during the week and on the weekends I would stay with my boyfriend. The thing is for the past month I have stayed there. I have been to my apartment to check the mail and that is it. I dont want to leave his house. Its not that I dont like my apartment becuase I do..I love being there...I just wish he could be there with me...does this make sense? I am spending 765 a month on rent as well as 100 on cable and aprox 12 on water and electricity on top of that. He owns his house and I just think that moving in there with him...I could be putting all that money into the investment of his home rather then to some apartment company. He is okay with me moving in but how do I know if im truly ready to give up my simply perfect apartment? Not only that but is it worth breaking my lease....HELP. Is there any shame in staying with him yet still paying for an apartment to simply store my stuff and have a place to call "my own"???

20090309113801AAJnwdt	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	To the ladies who goes to the gym?	If you notice a guy who's shown interest in you by eye contact, and you have shown mutual interest by returning eye contact, would you care how he initiates conversation with you?  Assuming it's not any pickup line of any sort, just a simple, "hi" or "having a nice workout?", could you be turned off by anything else he says?  Again, it won't be some pickup line or anything that relates to how she looks.      There is this girl at the gym and we have been trading eye contact for many months now.  I have a feeling she may be feeling frustrated at me for not trying anything as of yet.  Am I just being paranoid, or do girls get mad when the guy takes too long to take the initiative?  Though I rarely see her talk to other guys so it's not like I'm the only one who is intimidated by her.  But yeah, basically, if he's interested and you're interested, is there anything he could say that could turn you off?  Though I dont' plan on asking her out or for her number immediately, just gonna try to be friendly with her for a few days (or weeks).

I told him I couldn't give it and told him to go away because my mum would kill me.. lol   So i end up giving him my other number which i hardly use and my sisters friend is currently looking after it.

However, i never heard his voice since the grocery store when he asked for my number.   he says he wants to divorce her, im worried if he's doing it for me or no. We dont even know eachother. We told him, if he divorces, what will happen to your child, think about your son.      He also says he wouldnt call again, I'm like O.K, then he calls again and on there last conversation he was like you shut the phone i cant.

20090309100032AAvweLX	Family & Relationships;Friends	About a friend... what should i do?	i recently decided to cut ties with an old friend that i feel has gone the extra mile just to hurt my feelings.  His gf was totally rude when we went out one night on a double date and when i told him about it he said that i was a liar trying to start trouble. he later apologized and then questioned her and she lied to him about it  the part that bothers me even more is that when she did right in front of him- he just grinned at me knowing i was insulted.   a few people have told me that i should forget it and be his friend again but how do i get past that-  i feel like he betrayed me and our life long friendship over the actions of an insecure girlfriend.    even if i were to try to be friends with him again i could never trust that it won't happen again and i don't want to go through that anymore.   how can i make my friend understand that i had nothing to gain by telling him the truth but everything to lose by lying to him when it is the opposite for the girlfriend.   i do know that  even if i were to give him another chance at our friendship i will never trust him again nor will i have the same respect but i do want him to understand that as a friend what he did was wrong

20090309102819AA08t0x	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Dating a younger man ?	Ladies have you ever dated a younger man this is my first time dating a boy a few years younger than myself. I am 24 he is 20 not a big difference but maturity levels differ for men and women most of the time anyway when I first met him he was so sweet and innocent acting. Now he tries to dominate the relationship. I myself see this as a challenge because I secretly want to be dominated (won't let him go too far though long as the respect is still shown towards me) Do u find that younger men tries extra hard to be Men if they are dating an older lady...Last night he was supposed to come over but never did he called me today and i missed his call when i called him back he was upset and said fuc* that shyt I asked what's was wrong i should be the one mad that u didn't come in here He responded Nothins wrong in a calm manner Is he playing games or what ? One thing I can say about younger men is that the sex is Amazing When a man knows he's putting it down in the bedroom they tend to feel more confident and dominant in the relationship, but sex doesn't solve any problems he isn't excused in my book
20090309113504AAHjBoT	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Girl's views on love, plz help girls...?	ok so i met this girl that i really really like. we've known eachother for about over a month or so now, only been out togeater for about 4 times. after the 2nd time hanging out she texted me " OMG i think i love you"  and we still havn't ******. but i think i've waited long enough now. but anyway, so the question is, i actually want to make this girl into my gf so im kind of waiting alittle bit and not just hit it and quit it. and she's actually getting me to do cute stuff for her and i can't stop thinking about her.      my question is do you think me doing all these cute stuff like sending her a video of myley cyrius singing see you again and a video of aladin asking of his first wish in the oasis and he's describing jasmin (her name) are going to freak her out? plz i kind of dont want to **** this one up with her.... she's actually what i've been looking for in a girl as far as socially, intelactually and looks too...

20090309093131AAiO5mE	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	Need some opinions on this child support case....?	I'm one of the few fathers that have custody.  I took my ex wife to court for CS and settled on the amount in arrears.  Since the time we got a court order, her amount in arrears has doubled.  She says she lost her job and cant find employment.  Its been close to a year since she stopped paying yet she somehow is maintaining her lifestyle.  Anyways, I got served with a summons saying she was taking me to court to get child support reduced.  Now, I have to go get an attorney, pay him, and then to top it off, shes trying to sue me for her court costs....Is this ridiculous or what?  She is close to $10,000 in arrears, isnt helping out a damn bit, and then has the audacity to want me to cover her court costs when I have to pay my own because her lazy *** doesnt want to go back to work.....Should I be concerned here or will any judge see this as ridiculous as I do?

20090309091900AAf4Wxy	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Spending too much time together?	My boyfriend and I are head over heels in love. We've known each other for three years and have been together (without breaking up) for a year and a half. We spend everyday together and go to the same college. recently we've been getting into silly arguments over dumb things. Mainly just getting on each others nerves i guess. because the next day we don't even remember why we got mad.       I started thinking that maybe we are spending too much time together. the only other person i fight with this much is my sister and we see each other 24/7. We talked about it last night and decided that maybe we should not spend as much time together  but he's taking it way harder and says this could lead to us breaking up..which is the last thing i want.       what are some other ways to fix this? or did I come up with the best thing?

20090309091448AALHiR4	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	Cheating in second life?	so i've been on SL for about a month now, seeing everything and just chatting with people mostly, not really there for any other reason than to burn time. then last night some random chick IM's me and we start talking for about 30 to 45 minuets. during the conversation she tells me that her husband and kid are asleep in other rooms of the house. towards the end of the conversation she starts asking weird questions like is anyone near me at my computer and if i date older women (she was 33 i'm 22 btw) but at the end she was asking if i wanted to go have sex.      now i started a SL because a friend of mine says it's like a big chat room where you can chill and shoot the sh** with people. when you play long enough you realize that sex is a huge part of SL but I never had any intention of "cybering" with random chicks when i'm just tryin to hang out. i told her since it was about 1:00 in the morning that i had to log off, when i told her that she didn't even reply, she just went offline.      what made it worse is the fact that she was married, and had a kid! i'm not the kinda of guy that would help a married woman cheat on her husband in real life, and i'm sure not desperate enough to do it in my second life.       i guess my question is: do lots of married women look for alternate ways to satisfy themselves via games like SL?

20090309092121AAuhYHi	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	I lied to my boyfriend. What do I do?	Ok well I don't know if I could be pregnant (typical story right?) ok but I told my boyfriend that I am a couple days late on my period. Now- he has been through a lot these past few months and I saw how worried he was. He was in a car accident that injured him quite a bit. Then he quit his job and found another one, but he can't work well because of the injuries of the car accident, and I have seen him stressing out and worried. So to not worry him about me being pregnant anymore I told him that I got my period, even though I haven't yet. Was that a bad move to do? Any advice? I know if I am pregnant he will eventually find out but what do I do now?

20090309092206AAaaGcN	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Please help me with my situation?	Okay, so there's this guy that I met at a party, and we really hit it off. I even heard him telling his friend that he thinks I'm cute blahblah... So that night, he asked our common friends for my number and texted me. We talked everyday. He always found a way to talk to me, and he was really sweet and all. It was like all his attention was on me.       After a week, he then asked me to go watch a play with him on Saturday. I agreed, after thinking about it for a couple of days. So from Thursday evening to Saturday, we talked nonstop. And I mean NONSTOP!Even after the play and after he dropped me off and his friends invited him to go out, he still kept on texting me. I told him to stop texting me so he could enjoy their boys night out. After a while, he started texting me again, until Monday (still NONSTOP).       I got kind of bored with him and felt a need for some space, so there were times when I would stop replying, and he would go "hey reply!! :)" so after about half an hour, I would. But then I asked him out (on that same day) as a "return" for the play ticket w/c was kinda expensive, he said, "No, it's ok. I treat everyone this way." And so I got annoyed and told him that I'm formally asking this other guy whom my cousin set me up (who's really good-looking and smart), for prom. I even asked for suggestions (which he would not give). He was pretty quiet after that, but later he was back to normal.       The next day(Tuesday), he stopped talking to me. Sunday night, he told me from out of the blue that the previous night he went to someone's prom (as if I care), and we talked for a while. Wednesday, I texted him and asked if it was our common friend's birthday. He replied twice, maybe too eagerly, and I was really doing my best to act unconcerned, so I didn't reply after he did. We stopped talking after that.      Whenever I see him around, he ignores me. I don't get it. I thought we were friends. I mean, fine, I understand if he doesn't like me anymoe. But why ignore your friend?! Now I miss talking to him and stuff, but I don't want to seem like I care too much. Was I played or something?! Or did he just start thinking that I'm not into him?
20090309092627AAQRL2h	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	Is husband sex addict or just ?	Married and together 15years. In the past I have found he has gone to strip clubs, gotten lap dances. He loves porn and loves women. One woman called me and said they made out. He's tried having profiles on sex and dating sites. I don't think he's had sex with anyone, since I usually find out. He says he gets a high off doing these things and that he feels he can pick up any woman he wants. I questioned him about some pills he was taking (for erections) and he got mad at me and planted a note in his jacket of a "whore site" and name and phone number. He said it was a set up to get me to stop looking through his things. He keeps his life pretty private from me, and sometimes this is the only way I know whats going on.      We've been really happy lately, I still care about him and he says he loves sex and all it entail with me. He thinks I'm pretty, and I always look my best for him, But looking at a checking statement, there is a charge for a dating site for asians. He's said in the past that I could never trust him overseas with these beauties. He's turning 40 this month, and I wonder if this is his present to himself.    ps. his brother, newly divorced, has played out his fantasy of a colored woman already.   I really don't know why he married and had children with me if he wants to "**** the world"

I have moved to another state with him so he could take another job because he was about to be laid off. I am currently not working. Is it possible to divorce at this time? I was told that I would have to have a full time job what would allow me to be independant for at least a year with benefits until everything was settled. He makes all the money and I'm afraid he will empty the accounts if I even discuss this with him. I was also told I would have to freeze checking and savings accounts and take steps to keep him from cancelling my health benefits and auto insurance. What should I do? Please help. Also, I was told I would have to divorce in the state he lives in our house being sold is in another state which is where I would rather be.
20090309092712AATs6Tz	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	How should I talk to my boyfriend (who just broke up with me)?	My boyfriend broke up with me this morning because he says hes not ready for a relationship & hes too broke & hes sorry & all of this stupid stuff...   He did it over a text, if thats not terrible enough.   We haven't been together very long but I like him a lot and I feel like he didn't even try to work things out before just dumping me. I feel dumb getting worked up over a relationship that wasn't even serious but I thought that it would last a bit longer than this...   He deleted me from his friends on myspace and everything, but I'd really just like to talk to him to make sure we're on good terms because I don't want him to hate me :/ and I think that he might think I'm mad at him but I'm not. Now I feel like I handled it like a *****.   I'm afraid to call him because I honestly don't have much to say to him.   How would be a good way for me to send him a text or a message just to talk to him and see if were still atleast friends? Or should I just give him time?

20090309092854AAuopWs	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Who should I be with?	I have a boyfriend, he's amazing and he does what ever I want to do. I have no complaints about that, its just he always looks at me like I did something wrong or I am being a ***** towards him. I didn't mean to be nosy, but when I looked threw his phone there were text messages said things like "if we didn't break up, would we be together now?" From his ex girlfriend to him. He gets really annoying easy and when I tell him that he gets mad at me. His friends like me, I like his friends, we know we have problems and he blames them out on me but he doesn't know that he does it sometimes. And then there is this other kid, and we've been friends for a while, I think I might like him more than my current boyfriend because he is way nicer, and we never fight, we just get along way better. We have a ton of things in common and I would really like to be with him. But when I talk to my boyfriend things just flow right threw like our conversations and when I talk to the other kid, its usually good but we have a hard time either deciding what to talk about or do. I don't know I am just really confused on what I should do. I don't want to hurt my boyfriend, but I really like my other friend.

20090309093042AAAqDea	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Am i completely deluded?	basically i am in Love with my best friend, who i've been sleeping with for a few months, and he says he loves me too, and wants to be with me. only problem is....he has a girlfriend who he's been with for a year!   i know it sounds bad, but neither of us ever planned for it to happen, we're so close and really do talk to each other about everything. it just felt so right. problem is, we really may aswell be in a relationship, we spend everyday together, every night together, we hold hands, go clubbing together (where he tells everyone he's my boyfriend) even underwear shopping together!. my parents love him, and his like me.      the worst part for me in all this is that im even faithfull to him! when we go out if another lad comes anywhere near me, he goes mad! he even gets jelous when he hears about someone i slept with 2 years ago and says it bothers him! it just hurts so much the fact i have no one who will commit to me! it upsets him to see me with random lads. why can't he understand how much it hurts me to hear him tell his girlfriend on the phone that he loves her!! and when i have a bed all to myself feeling so empty inside while he's off with his girlfriend for a romantic weekend.       this weekend he went to see his gf, and had sex with her for the first time sinse we've been sleeping together (his argument has always been that he's kinda faithfull to me too) . he told me about it and i just felt crushed. he also said he found it hard to physically do it coz he was thinking of me the whole way through!!!!! i also got text messages all weekend saying what a crap time he was having (their having problems) and how he missed me, and wished he was cuddled up to me.       i love this guy to pieces and its hurting me so much that no matter how bad things seem to get between him and his girlfriend he doesnt get rid of her and have me! when he knows he can. it gets compplicated as i've got a job in the South of france for 6 months in April and i guess he doesnt want to not have a GF in the country for that long, which i can understand. i just want him to be happy out of everyhting. i tried to put a stop to everyhting last night so he can sort things out with his gf properly and i can find someone who can commit to me. but when i suggested it he broke, he was so upset i couldnt bear it, and we had sex. im so weak when it comes to him lol. i can't bear to loose him as my best friend as that is what we are, when everyhting else is stipped away thats our foundation and i love it and.....i love him, i really do. what is the answer?????????

20090309093236AAPZVva	Family & Relationships;Friends	Why do my "ex" relatives treat me poorly?	I went through a painful divorce about three years ago as my spouse cheated with one of my friends.  They apparently decided that they were "soul mates" and broke up two families totaling 5 children to be together.  I was very blown away at the time.  But, have found that it was truly a blessing!!! My ex turned out to be incredibly cruel, dishonest along with mentally and verbally abuse during and after the divorce as I moved on with my life and remarried.  We were together from the time that we were 15!  We're 38 now.  He has a large extended family that I was pretty close with.  A few of them are still very friendly.  But, my question is about the others that aren't.  Why would they treat me in an unkind way?  I've done nothing.  Their family member cheated on ME.  One particular male nephew whom I was extremly close with will not speak to me.  He was almost like my brother.  I've called before and he has hung up on me!  I don't get it!!! I've stopped trying..but it simply doesn't make sense. The ex did go ahead and marry his "affair".  Why in the world would some of them treat ME this way?

20090309094943AAViOIm	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	How do I quit a project I am miserable at if I also NANNY for the woman who's my 'boss' on said project? HELP!?	Ok.  I work as a nanny for a family, to which the wife is an internet developer.  Awhile back, she asked me if I wanted to get some extra hours doing data entry for one of her projects, and not willing to ever turn down work, I accepted the offer.        From the beginning, it was difficult.  She sent me emails with the most confusing of instructions to a project already easy to screw up - not because it's difficult work, it's actually very mindless - but the attention to detail is crucial as one thing is actually many things in many cases.  Regardless, I worked through the weekend, totaling 20.5 hours, and couldn't have been happier to be done.        Two weeks ago, my boss came to me and asked if I wanted to do some more data entry for the same person -- who after all the trouble now wants to completely redo the site, as she realizes that she assigned me completely ***-backwards directions, and it isn't doing what she "envisioned."        Now, for the real issue.  I work for this woman Monday through Thursday, and as the week went by, no spreadsheets or info were sent to me for this project, and so before leaving Thursday of last week, I reminded her that my only full day to work on this project was Friday, as I was leaving town for the weekend and I don't watch her kids on Friday.  VERY CLEAR.  Friday came and went and at 10:30pm I received the first email, followed by the other two at 11:30pm.  Refusing to cancel my weekend plans because of her, I sat down when I got home last night, only to be baffled by the instructions.  Again.  To top it off, I got an email from her at 11pm last night asking how it was going..really?  I emailed her this morning at 6am saying only "I am starting on it this morning, as my only free time was on friday, at which time I had no information."        I am now trying to get started, but am absolutely frustrated with this and no longer even want to do the project.  I feel like this is justified, as although I committed to the job, it was based on the fact that I had to get it done on Friday.  This is not a job I asked for, but a job that is a favor to her, thus my biggest frustration.        How do I quit this project without a huge tension between her and I as I am the nanny for her two girls and have been managing her household as I've gone through grad-school.        HELP!!

20090309095148AASdJGg	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	How far is too far physically in a Christian dating relationship?	My boyfriend and I have been dating for a year now. We are both 21 and completely in love. We are both Christians and very much in love with God. We go to church together and have fun hanging out together too. We generally love just being together. As we move farther into our relationship, we get more and more physically attracted to each other. Not only that, we are dealing with lust as well. I know that is a common thing in any relationship, but how do I deal with it? We both agree that we are going to wait until we get married to have sex, but we still want to show each other our love through physical means. When it comes to the Bible, it is unclear where right and wrong lie. How do I know if what we do is a sin? I know that sex is not an option, but what constitutes sex? Is there a definite line to not cross when you are in a relationship? I need some help with this issue. We do not want to disobey God, but we do want to be able to show each other our love physically, like kissing or whatnot. We do hold hands and kiss and we like to cuddle up together to watch a movie.  Are there any suggestions?  Is there a line in which we don't need to  cross, in your opinion?      Thanks so much for the help. If there are any questions, feel free to ask.

20090309100020AAeFuqJ	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	What would you call a guy like this?	Okay well I'm 6 months pregnant and I'm a single mother. The father of my son left when I was just 3 months pregnant, he said that he didn't love me no more and that he didn't nothing to do with me. Then two weeks after wards he started dating his NEW GIRLFRIEND shes 17 years old and she also has a baby from another guys.The way that my ex had been bothering me and just harassing me and making my life a living hell I decided to tell him to just leave me alone and to forget about the baby and me and he doesn't even know if its a boy or a girl and I think that's whats killing him inside that he doesn't know anything about the baby. Well he finally decided to leave me alone and stop writing me e-mails... well for a while then one day when I woke up and just checked my e-mail to see if my friend wrote me because we were suppose to go out to eat, then I saw that he had wrote me and that they were pictures and as soon as I clicked on them it was a picture of my ex with a tattoo of his new girls name on him and then the other one was a heart with his name on it i guess that they both got tattoos. When I saw this I started to feel lightheaded and I started to cry a lot and couldn't stop. I mean I haven't done anything to either of them so that they could send me some pictures that I obliviously didn't want to see. I honestly think that its wrong that he wanted to stress me out and the baby, my friend had called him to cuse him out to see what the hell was wrong with him and why is he bothering me with stupid pictures like that? He told her that he didn't send them to me that it was his girlfriend, then my friend told him okay if it was your girl then why the hell is she saying that she knows what armida (me) is going through and that she cares about the baby and her? He didn't say anything and he told her to tell me that he wasn't going to bother me anymore and that he was going to erase everything that he has about me. My friend told him that I called the police to get a protective order against him so that he could finally leave me alone and he told her to tell me not to do it, that it wasn't necessary. Then she called him again to tell him that i got the order and that if he wrote, called, or even came near me that he would get arrested and he just stayed quite for a while and then he said okay (beep) everything I don't want to know anything about her i will leave her alone. She also told him that his girlfriend was really stupid to do what she did. I feel that its my job to keep my son safe and I'm not goiin to let his father or his new girl stress out my lil one anymore because he's the one that suffers too not only me!

Yeah I'm trying online dating again and trying every where I can to really put my self out there since well I love being in a relation ship with a girl I like [too bad all of them here moved away to college]. So I'm trying online dating, I know pathetic right well I have one one here that will even look at me and well I just got out of a relation ship here and said to myself why not try a online one ^_^. Just a girl who likes anime, video games and well some one I  can click with. here is my pic  http://trigun1462.deviantart.com/art/the...

20090309100323AAszkfQ	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Which girl is right for me?	Ok so i went out with these 2 girls who used to be mates and who then fell out. i dated them both one after the other.(that wasnt why they fell out) but basically i dated them back to back. They both had really bad personalities and where so annoying it was untrue, they had no manners, and both where liars, cheaters etc, all things bad, it was actually hard to find anything good. Thankfully i have escaped them lol as they where the worst people ive been out with in my life.No exaggertaion (if you need any examples of their behaviour, i can elaborate in great details!!)      Joking asides. I then joined a dating website and met up with this american girl, she has an absolutely amazing personality and we get on great, thing is, im so not attracted to her and it annoys me..because if i was, she'd be perfect for me. im in no way shallow and will meet her again.but the attraction just isnt there, so it may end up friends..      Im going bowling with a work mate on Wednesday i have managed to arrange this with her in a cunning plot that she brings her mate who i fancy (which she is) i don't know her mate too well and im wondering how i should approach the whole issue of getting a phone number and maybe getting a date out of my work mates friend. i like the look of her alot and would like to see what she is like to be around and what her personality is like...basically she (the girl i like) lives closer to me than my work mate and my own personal mate who are both coming with us...do i drop her (the girl i like) home last after ive dropped the other 2 home (when the night out is over) or do i pick her up first?? etc and when would be a good time to get the number?? i need to prepare this well as it may well be a rare chance to get to see this girl!! I mean just to get this night out bowling with my work mate has took long hard preparation..      I think this girl does like me because since i told my work mate that i liked her mate, she has accompanied her into work each friday nite, when my work mate is in.(never done before, thatd id noticed)      She also appologised to her work mate (for my behalf) when we called round to her house one night to leave something off and she didnt say anything to me and infact acted quite shy..so she said to her work mate that she was sorry and to tell me and that she didnt mean to come across rude!!      Listen guys any advice would be greatly appreciated as id love this to work out for a change after the recent disasters i mentioned at the beggining of this little piece!!

20090309101040AANrXtf	Family & Relationships;Other - Family & Relationships	How do I react to a past crush who tries to apologise?	I had this crush on a guy about 10 years back. Though I never told the guy about my true feelings but V both were friends. He then had 2 leave that city where I stayed forever. I had accepted this fact n never expected anything in return. I always was good to that person & sent him a gift as a token of my feelings but never mentioned my Name on it.   But once he left, a 3rd person whom I happened to help once wanted to repay me n she got hold of my crush's number, called him & told him all about my feelings. Now he came over 2 my place & gave me just 5 mins, in which only he talked n all he talked was how I had been impractical n wrong, how my friend had given him calls & gave me examples of successful people who dont pay attention to being emotional. I didnt react but was deeply hurt. I broke off with the girl who messed up all this 4 me & never again tried 2 contact my crush to tell him the truth. I was punished for something I didnt even do.   Now after so many years 1 day suddenly in a moment of emotion I saw my crush's profile on a social networking site & sent a normal "HI" msg to him but much to my surprise he recognised me, replied n even apologised many times for his behaviour n said he wants to revive the friendship again. I am now committed already to a strong relationship n from his profile I could make out, he is too but I dont know how to react.

Telling her how much he missed her and wanted her body.       We got into a huge fight over it but I decided to stay and work things out. Well fast forward a few months and since we didn't have any trust left, I finally broke things off.

Even though I left him, I still love him. I can't stop thinking about him. He's said time and time again how sorry he is. How he shouldn't have done it. How he wants us to start over and start new. How he only wants to grow old with me.      So my question is should I give him another chance or just let the past be the past?

20090309102650AAFMJ4F	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	What would you say or do?	I've been talking to this guy online for about a year now. He's come over to my house a few times and it was really awkward. We dident know what to say because were both very quite people. I really love him and the person he can be when hes just relaxed. But it dosent seem like we'll be that way around each other so over the past month i've tried telling him that but he's really no good at reading between the lines so eventually I just straight up told him I had alot of stuff going on and I dident think I could give him the relationship he wanted. But of coarse he guilted the crap outa me and we kept talking. But over the past week I just havent written at all thinking I should just cut it off. But I feel like a horrible person. He's such a good guy and I love him im just not in love with him. Is it wrong to kinda just ignore someone? we've gone thru this so many times I just dont feel like I could tell him HEY I dont wanna talk to you lol ya know? thats kinda fucked up..but so is what im doing I guess...so confused..

20090309103049AA22gwJ	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	My sons mum uses hand-overs to cause arguments. can i get prohibited step order?	i have had to apply to court for contact with my son and i now have contact with him Saturdays and Sundays every two weeks. my sons mum has accused me of being aggressive and violent even though i have never even shouted at her. so to avoid any sort of misunderstanding i hardly speak to her during handovers. she asked me a few months ago if she could put our now 18months old son in my car during handovers and i agreed hoping it would make her realise that our son is happy to go with me. but she has used this opportunity to verbally abuse me and always slams the door when she leaves. the reason she does this is because the handover takes place at her parents house so she pretends when i am at the door but once our son is in the car she starts misbehaving (as her parents wont see or hear whats happening). i don't think our son needs to witness such behaviour and even though i told her i didn't want her to come to my car anymore she still does. now i am thinking about getting a prohibited steps order as her solicitor doesn't seem to be able to advise her properly.

20090309103628AA9bHh4	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	I dont know what to iint his situation?	My baby dady and I have recently started talkling on the daily basis again. We sometimes get along and things can be smooth between us. My baby daddy and I was currently in a situtaton and we were arguing back and fprth in front of our 1 year old daughter. I was so frantic and upset. So as we were going back and forth he made a comment and said he swears that he will kick me and this baby out of the car. So i yelled out and saisd, it's not like its your first time doing it(yes he did kick us out of the car when she was about 6 mnths old. And I had to walk home until he came back to get us. Well to amke the long story short. I yelled backa nd said that he wouldnt dare so he pulled over and took my daughter while she was in her car seat and put he out and dragged me out(must i remind u that i am 5 mnths pregnant by him) so all i did was yell and cry. So he just drove off saying, you can now put me on child support *****. From where he dropped me off at my house was about 2 1/2 miles so i decided to walk because i didnt have any cash to catch the bus. I got home 45 minutes later. My daughter was crying the whole time and I couldnt carry her because I am pregnant. 1 week later my baby daddy comes to apologize and i was pissed because of what he did to me let along his baby. He said that I provoked him by yelling back at him and it was his car and at the time he didnt want us in it. So its like i cant get into his head. He never takes up for his faults. I spoke to him a couple of days later and i told him that he needs to get his daughter a new car seat and he said that since i left it, it is our lose... NOW WHAT AM I SUPPOSE TO DO???

20090309104239AAdrWX8	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	If I want to watch my wife have sex with another, am I a pervert or voyeur?	I want to watch her on top of a lover...... Doesn't matter if she has sex with a girl or a guy as long as I can watch her ***. When we talk about it during sex, she really gets off but she says she would prefer it remain a fantasy. When we are apart for months at a time I really get excited thinking she might have sex and then tell me about it. She sends me fantasy emails about her doing it with a girl or a friend of ours to excite me but she still says she won't do it for real. I tell her to please do it and let me watch her on top with the her web camera. She once got so mad, she went into explicit detail how she went to a girls bar and slept with a hottie and now the hottie  tells her she doesn't need me. My wife says she had the best sex ever and now is happy with her new girlfriend for sex all the time. She really doesn't have a girlfriend but I think she wanted me to see a scenario that might develope if I persist with making our fantasy a reality.I don't know why I am infatuated with watching her. I love her deeply and she is my best friend. Am I a pervert or just a voyeur?

20090309104634AA0xO9y	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	He's falling for a whore, I'm falling for him...?	Okay, so I've liked this guy for a long time (even though we're in different schools) For the sake of making things understandable, we'll call him Jack. Jack and I had a friendly/sometimes flirting type of relationship. Then I ran into Jack at a school dance, and he was dancing with a girl I know, who is The **** to Rule All Sluts. We'll call her Sarah. I warned Jack that Sarah was super-easy, but obviously Jack didn't listen.    Three days later, Sarah facebooked me (apparently she knew that I knew Jack) and said that Jack had asked her out. But she was busy and said no. She said she didn't even like him. I told Sarah that she should let him down lightly, which she said she did.   The next dance, I saw Sarah and Jack dancing and spending time together again. Then Jack changed his facebook relationship status from "single" to "it's complicated", which in our school system means "I'm in the stage between single and dating".   I'm really heartbroken, but that's not the only problem. I know Sarah's going to break Jack's heart, but I don't know what I can do about it.   Please help me.
20090309104647AAXTPpU	Family & Relationships;Friends	Am I wrong for doing this?	OKay boyfriend hates a guy that I was friends with... he wanted me to brake up with my BF and I had to cut him off. Okay so I'm texting a friend who found out that I was in town and wanted to hang out with me. I was trying to tell him no in  nice way, my bf thought it was the other guy (idk why?) and told him to leave me the H*** alone. I was SO mad at him. He had no right to tell one of my friends that. So, I did the same to him. Went to his Facebook and deleted a girl he talks to and told her to never talk to him again. Now he's the mad one and changed his passwords. I feel like he doesn't trust me. I keep my passwords the same and he doesn't.  Was he right? What you think? Thanks

I know that he's only going to work and support our family, but I can't help having this daunting feeling like something bad is going to happen to him. I have such bad anxiety about him not coming back to me.    I've talked to him about this and he says he's fine with it (and thinks it's cute, not me), but I really wanna be a stronger person.     I used to be very independent and strong, but now I don't know what the heck is wrong with me.     I refuse to take pills cause I feel I can get past these feelings on my own.

20090309105101AAUAtYG	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	How far to forgive for Love?	How far are we human being willing to go to forgive one another? How far are we willing to go for love? :heartbounce: When we ask for forgiveness, what are we really asking for? To undo damage that could never be undone? If two are in love… Where do you cross the line of forgiving one another? Is there a limit?      To me Delia Guardiola   Forgiveness is making peace without any expectations. Forgiveness is a way of starting things all over again. Forgiveness is something easily said but hard work to get done. Understand that when one is hurt the healing takes time. Taking time comes with making efforts. Making efforts is not buying the other a dozen roses saying you are sorry and a card full of promises…:flowers: Making an effort is using the time you still have, to forgive yourself in order to ask for forgiveness and showing how glad you are to be forgiven. Understanding that it will take time for the hurt to be healed. Willing to heal it together.      No matter how bad someone might have hurt you in the past… No matter how deep words might have cut you… No matter how intense you are in love… They say you can forgive but you can never forget the past! to my opinion: You can ease the pain! And the pain can only be eased with the time and efforts. And one day the scar will be so covered by love that you don't have to think about the past you did forgive!

20090309105321AAd2iBq	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Can you predict how good a person will be in bed sexually by.......?	Can you tell how good a person will be in bed by the type of food they will or won't eat when you go out?      I've been thinking about the women I've dated in the past and which ones were really great lovers and which ones were not so good. I realized that the ones who were limited in what they ate when we dined together were also not so good in bed sexually. I also noticed that women who were open to eating a variety of food and even some exotic foods were amazing in bed. Was this a coincidence? This brings me to my question.      Can you tell by what your girlfriend eats when you go out whether they will be good in bed? The question is not meant to be sexist so if girls want to chime in about their boyfriends I'd like to hear from you too.
20090309105627AAU7s0l	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	Is there something wrong with me? Engaged twice at before 20 yrs old?	My high school sweet heart of all 4 years of high school proposed (I was 17), I said yes. I look back now, and obviously I think to myself that I was way too young. We ended up breaking up at the beggining of my senior year, I decided that I was going to school out of the city, he decided he didn't want to attend college, obviously we wanted VERY different things out of life.      The same year I met and started dating a guy who was 5 years older than me. I ended up getting very homesick and moved back to Phoenix. My mom did not want me to date the older guy so he asked me to move in with him. We were only together at the time for a couple of months. After living together for 6 months (a very disfunctional realtionship) he proposed, I said yes. We had a date set and everything. He became violent on more than one occasion... he hurt my mom's dog while we were house sitting and I decided that was it..... to hurt a defenseless creature was beyong my comprehension. I broke up with him moved back in with my mom. I tried to stay happy single and figure out what I wanted.       Then BAM, I met a marine stationed at Camp Pendleton 6 months later. We casually dated for a few months, then I was his girlfriend, and now 8 months later he's asking me to marry him. I'm not taking it too seriously, there's no ring on my finger.       Is there something wrong with me? Am I sending out a signal that says MARRY ME or something? I work at an elementary school (I"m going to ASU for my BA in education), my friends, family and coworkers would all describe me as caring, nurturing, and cute. I like to cook and bake and scrapbook. I love kids. I've always been able to see myself getting married young, but I'm afraid that people just won't take my relationships seriously anymore....

20090309113048AAjge4T	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	I kissed my friends boyfriend :| :| Please read and answer.?	Hi!   Basically, I became friends with a girl at college because it turns out I work at the same place as her boyfriend, so we became friends through that, me, along with my other friend, were her first friends at college, and she was our first new friend at college.      Anyway, last night she came in to see her boyfriend for a little while but she couldn't stay long, now let me tell you, I have never ever felt attracted to her boyfriend in anyway, but when I said goodbye to him, I don't know what came over me but I kissed him (It wasn't a proper snog, it was just a kiss on the lips) he kind of backed away, looked shocked and just left,      I didn't go into College today because I felt so guilty, and I can't bring myself to seeing her, I'm so worried though that he's going to tell her what happened, and I'll lose her as a friend. Do you think I should tell her, or not say anything and ask her boyfriend not to?      I feel terrible :|

20090309113344AAitHWx	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	To abstain in college, over a serious ex relationship, or venture, your advice?	so i got out of a serious relationship of a year about a year ago because, by slip of tongue, he said that he did't trust me and had accepted that i had probably already cheated on him several times. he was 25 with an adopted nephew (cuz he's that good of a man) and i was 19 in college. still in college now. the breakup was hard but my choice, i had to get out. i actually went to Georgia where my best friend was, the one person i could trust to trust me. my ex had said that sex was something that he needed b4 we started dating. so if i was going to be gone for the summer and he didn't even trust me, i didn't want to be dating him in case he wanted to get laid, i don't need to be something to feed a guilty conscious of his (cuz maybe he's a faithful guy and is distrust wasn't a reflection of his own dishonesty...). i've punched nice guys drunk cuz i felt like they were coming on to strong and they knew i was taken. i was totally loyal, and though its been a year i still can't bring myself to sleep with anyone else. should i try and say i'm sorry or should i take his lack of phone calls as a sign and venture to the sex life of the college scene? is he trying to give me space cuz he knows i'm young? is it worth it? he's slept with other girls and had another gf(after we broke up), only lasted like 2 months though. we're still friends, i want a serious relationship, but i'm curious what my age group has to offer, something exciting, something deep? my ex is a really great guy; i got wound up in him, and still kind of am, and so it really hurt that i was so open with him and he would see me as untrust worthy. he has been screwed over by a 5 yr series of girls and divorced(cuz she cheated). he is the 2nd serious relationship i've had and 2nd sexual partner. the sex with him was pretty awesome for the most part and i got to say i ******* miss getting laid. and my looks guarantee me a good score (not to be cocky or anything). i'm curious, but should i give up on a good guy cuz things took a rough turn and maybe he's given up on me. he also lives 2 hours away
20090309113743AAnjcoU	Family & Relationships;Friends	Does age in friends really matter?	I'm in need of a best friend, and I think I found one. The only problem is, she is twice my age. I really think that she could help me because she's really nice and gives good advice. How can I get her to be my friend without her thinking I'm weird? I need somebody to talk to and I think I finally found that person but I don't know how to approach her about it. Somebody please help!
20090309113456AAUvKmv	Family & Relationships;Friends	Does my friend love me?	I've asked this under another section as well, as I'm trying to get a broader range of answers.         I have been suspicious about my friend's feelings towards me for some time now, and I think that they might fancy or even love me.   First things first I would like to point out that I am also a guy and am straight. Now thats outta the way, these are some of the reasons why I believe what I do;      - Occasionally I catch him staring at me, when he thinks I am not looking.      - If he sits next to be, which is often, he will sit RIGHT next to me, almost on my lap. He once did try to sit on my lap as well.      - He also sometimes lays across the couch so that he his leaning against me. One time he even rested his head on my chest.      - If I sit anyway else in the room, he will make some kind of excuse to sit near me again.      - When I lay down on a bed, he will come and lay right next to me, so that we are touching. Sometimes he will lay down properly, with his head near my chest.       - Other times if I am sitting on the bed, or anywhere else, he will sit with his back and head resting on my legs.      Also he does things which point further to the conclusion;      - I once went camping with him and a few others. He kept stroking my hair when I was trying to get to sleep. I brushed his hands away a few times, but he still carried on doing it. I can tell he wasn't messing around, because of the look on his face.      - When I went on a journey in a car with him once, he put an arm around me briefly, but pulled away when I looked around.      - When we are on bikes, he will hold my arm for no reason at all.      - He trys to get under the covers with me in bed.      Another thing is, whenever he seems to be in a bad mood, he will have a go at everyone but me. He always seems to smile when I am around as well.   So the question is ; do you think that he fancies, or loves me?   Sorry for the wall of text, but I want to clear this all up soon.   Thanks,      -Walsy

Ok so me and this girl have been talking to each other for a few months now and i know she likes me and i like her but the problem is me and her text alot but she also texts other guys which i dont really mind till the other day when i seen on her myspace 1 of the guys she talks to has taken her number 1 spot away from me.      She has at 1 point changed her status to "Love then she put his myspace name there.So it has me worried kinda i mean we just talked last night and she said shes ready to be with me and wants me to ask her out soon but this other guy thing has got me confused out of my mind right now but the weird thing is the guy lives a few states away so maybe its just a good friend she has met online a few months ago.         So what should i do?Maybe ask her about him and risk her getting mad at me before we have even dated or just dont worry about it since the guy lives so far away?

20090309113717AABkl8e	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Friends with benefits? good or bad?	mk so i wanted to know how bad a friends with benefits relationship is. because i cant explain it but i still like the boy, i want to be his friend still at the very least. but i am still physically attracted to him, i just dont feel like i want to commit and have a boyfriend right now since i dont like having to feel like he an help to control my life and such. so i broke up with him.... and he offered me friends with benefits. should i? i dont want to hurt him more but i just want some opinions.    could i date him and have it not be exclusive or would he still have a say in my life then? i just dont like the tied-down kind of feeling... =/ we wouldnt have sex btw... we're still in high school, it would just be like we'd hang out and stuff but we'd kiss and make out sometimes too...

20090309113807AA5TxNp	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	How do I know that I can trust him?	Ok so we've been friends for a year and a half. He's been wanting to take me out but I say no I don't want to date a friend. That is not the real reason I won't date him. The real reason is Im scared because I've never had a boyfriend, never been out on a date, never been kissed, never had any sexual contact with the opposite sex. Im also scared that I may get hurt if I date him. I have never seen a successful relationship. Every man that I know personally has cheated in their relationship, even my own father. And because I've seen all of these unfaithful men it makes me afraid to trust a guy. He's been nothing but a sweetheart, he makes me feel whole, I feel safe being with him, but Im scared to take the next step like making a commitment and going out with him. He knows Im scared but he keeps telling me I can trust him and that I have nothing 2 worry about, I dont know how to act around guys I get all nervous and I feel like a weirdo cause I've never had any type of real relationship. What should I do, How should I act, I mean should I let him take me out, How do I know if I can trust him.

20090309135416AAqppQB	Family & Relationships;Weddings	Do you want friends and family to see your wedding stuff?	Stuff was the best word I could come up with.   I usually like to get EVERYONE's opinion before I buy something, but planning my wedding seems different.  I feel like I want a bit of a surprise when people show up.  I'm so stuck in between.        For instance we just picked out the flower girl dress and I want to show my mom, and my aunts and everyone lol       But then it seems like it would be so much funner for them to see her all dressed up in it at the wedding.  Same with things like the wedding decorations, my wedding dress etc.        How do you feel about that?  Do you want everyone to see what your planning, or want it to be more of a surprise?

Do we love each other on superficial attraction?      Do we love each other on biological stimuli?      Do we have unconscious criteria by which we choose a life long mate?      Or do we have conditions, especially economic, that determine our "catch", in life?      What do you think?  Is love accepting a person for who they are, right now, no matter what?      Or is love, how you feel, how turned on you are, about certain factors?      Candid answers.....honest answers.  Please.
20090309121628AAM3pGN	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	How to ease my husbands fears?	My husband and I both have children from previous marriages. I have 2 and he has 1. We are currently pregnant with our 1st child together. My children were both born big and healthy, and to this day have been extremely healthy kids. However, my husbands 1st child was born at 24 weeks, and was in the hospital for the 1st 5 months of her life because of this. She was born so early because of her mothers unknown condition of having what doctors call "incompetant cervix" which basically means that your cervix is not strong enough to hold the baby in.    But i dont have this condition, and my smallest baby was 8lbs. But still my husband is almost afraid to be excited about this baby because of the experience with his daughter. I have tried to explain to him that i dont have that condition, and I have a proven track record of big healthy babies, but he cant get over his paranoia. He never wants to talk about the baby, talk about names, or anything like that because he thinks if he gets his hopes up, something will go wrong again. He was not like this the whole time that we were TTC, he was excited then. I am starting to feel like he is letting a previous experience give him a reason to "opt out" of this pregnancy.I am nearly 21 weeks, and he has been to both midwife appointments and the 1st ultrasound and is coming to the next ultrasound this fri. results at all have been totally healthy and fine.  If anyone has any idea how i can help ease his fears that this pregnancy is not gonig to mirror his last child, that would be great. Thanks.

Ok, so I'm 14, a freshman in highschool,  I just got home to find out that my mom had thrown out 75% of my clothes because "you have too many things"  When I walked in the door after getting home from track practice, i walked toward my room and opened the door . she was like "Don't get mad".. So then I yelled at her for going through my personal things inside of my room, she started ranting and screaming, like at the top of her lungs, it was quite scary from viewpoint. so then I said "why are you screaming?" and she pushed me down to the floor and started hitting me, hard, I still have very red marks in the spots.   Was I in the wrong or was she?   I have this hang-up about people respectin other's privacy, which I have made very obvious to her multiple times.   Also, is there something mentally wrong with her?   Whenever I am speaking to her, if i ask a question or say something like "so what do you think" her response is always "I tuned you out five minutes ago"   So is she crazy or just really bitchy

See...a co-worker and I used to be involved and I had thought I had gotten over him until yesterday.  We had not been involved in a while and before I had a chance to tell him any thing he started to "mess" with me while we were working on a project together.  I later told him that I was getting married and he seemed happy and even met my fiance before I left work, but we kissed.  I had to know if there was something there and...well...you know.  It wasn't major, it was slight.  And I know all the co-worker wants is the "good stuff", so help. PLEASE!!!!????
20090309133713AA6qHus	Family & Relationships;Friends	My friends keep telling me who I should date?	It's getting quite annoying exactly and I don't know what else to do. They told me to ask out my one guy friend a few months ago but the relationship didn't even last 2 days it was too weird so I didn't even count it. I've been single since october and truthfully my grades are great, i'm more focused on my sports, and I don't even get into any trouble anymore with my parents, I enjoy being single. But my friends are getting on my nerves a lot lately. I don't know what else to do to get it through their head I don't like anyone. Every time I do all they say is "oh you know you do" uh if I did then I would admit it. I'm getting really sick of it and they're getting on my nerves. I can't ignore then cause they're my best friends. I know they want whats best for me but I have to know what's best for me to. What can I do?
20090309120652AAbEAo4	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	I can't tell if he likes me. Can you please help!?	So I met this guy in a conference in January. We both had a great time together along with other people. So one of the nights I was really drunk and we made out. I don't remember making out with him but that's what others told me, but he was not drunk.The next day I apologize to him and tell him that it was not right and it shouldn't happen again...since I am going through a heartbreak. So now the conference ends and we both return to our cities and we both live very close to each other.   Few days after returning we get in touch and meet up again and this time I introduce him to my friends and we have a wonderful time together. Now we have been in touch through phone and he calls me pretty frequently and we talk for hours. We are very compatible in a lot of ways. He has mentioned a few times how he wants a relationship and wants to get married and tells me about the women he is dating on eharmony.com. He has invited me to his apt twice and nothing ever happens...but our conversations are very deep and we love pulling each others leg. Now I am not sure where this maybe going but he wants me to come to his house for Easter and I discovered that his parents/close friends already know about me. He also said that he takes his friends to his parents house all the time. He has several women that are his best friends and also mentions the dates he likes.So I am guessing that he wants me as a friend too...not really sure. I like him but I always have a guard up as how I don't want a relationship with anyone and have repeated it so many times that I think it makes it clear to him that I don't want him. But I actually do. We both have shared things about each others lives that even our best friends don't know about. What does he want from me and what should I do? I am not ready for a relationship but I like him a lot and I think it may lead to something positive coz we are extremely compatible. Not sure if he wants the same.
20090309135139AAVcpVW	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Does she like me..need advice?	I've been eye flirting with this girl in my class for a while now. At the end of the semester, she said hi to me. And i just looked at her quickly and put my head down. She stood next to me, while the professor was giving the correct answers on the lab test. It looked like she was trying to get my attention. When the class was over, some people stayed after while others started leaving. She was looking at me while i was leaving, it looked like she was following me. Does she like me? I'm a girl btw
20090309125944AA3m1xP	Family & Relationships;Other - Family & Relationships	Oh god i messed up big time! please i need some advice!?	Let me start from the beginning, I am 18 and my sister is 21. I just finished high school and my sister is home from college. I guess this year her grades started slipping or something, because I walked past her room and she was crying. I walked inside her room to ask her what's up and she hands me a letter - apparently she's up for review by her college for dismissal. I feel kinda sorry for her so I gave her a hug and one thing led to another and we started making out. This is really weird because I've made out with girls before, but my sister blows them all out of the water. In the back of my mind lies the fact that she's my sister and what we are doing is sick and wrong, but I guess my sister has more experience and it felt SO good.       Here's the dilemma - after making out, Karen started taking her clothes off and she started pulling my pants down. I'm like, hey, what are you doing? She's like, oh come on Jordan, aren't you even a LITTLE curious? I felt bad because its true, my sister is VERY attractive and I always wished that she wasn't my sister. I've even gone as far as to masturbate to thoughts of doing her. She then said "For tonight, let's not be brother and sister. I really need this because I feel like **** right now and our parents won't be back till late and we aren't going to tell anyone.       Please, im so confused! I feel like i want to kill myself! i dont know what to do, i need some advice.

20090309114430AA6mEQB	Family & Relationships;Friends	GIRLS: Plz help! I don't know what to do!!!!!!!!!!!!!?	So I'm re-posting this question,   Here's my dilemma, my best friend is a girl (which is not the problem). Recently she had her period and was acting all weird, and I had no idea what to do or say. I didn't want to hurt her emotionally and she wouldn't tell me what was wrong (understandably seeing as how it's not exactly something we discuss every day.) Our moms talked, and my mother told me what was going on, so that's how I know what it was. My question (mainly for girls), is how should I act around her when she is going through this? What should I say or do? What should I not say or do? Honest answers are welcome, please don't make any rude or stupid comments.    Just some more info, we are very close friends. We have a great friendship and I don't want to hurt her feelings or anything by saying or doing something that would upset her. Thank you so much for posting and helping me out, I really appreciate your help. Thanks.

20090309141414AAXO9aC	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Does he know I like him?	Well my friend Jillian and I were thinking about transversing religion classes to St. Patrick's, because there are two boys we like in there, and because I need to have different days for religion instead of Wednesdays.  Riley- the one that I like, Danny-the one who likes me that i don't like, and Jay-the one who Jillian likes are all this one three some group.  (Jillian used to like Danny)  All three of them go to that church for religion class.  I know that Riley used to like me, but not sure now.   So today Jillian asked all three of them witch church they go to, and they said St. Patricks.  She told them that her and me were going to transfer there for religion classes.  They were all like no!  But Riley said, "Oh Jay, your true love is going to be there!"  Jay said shut up.  Jill said, "Dixie doesn't like him!"  I know they know that the only reason we are going there is because we like one of them.  I think Riley, if he's smart, figured it out and started to look at me the rest of the day, like stare.   Does he know I like him?

20090309140449AAsp2Bs	Family & Relationships;Weddings	Getting FH's input into plans?	Hey -      OK, so we have not set a date yet, but are getting plans together to allow us to budget :-)      The thing is, my FH is not the most 'forthcoming' when it comes to 'shiny things'.      I asked him today what colour schemes he'd like and he said 'summery'.  When I asked what kind of summer colours, he laughed and said 'but honey I don't understand colour schemes'.      I think he is holding off as he knows how excited I am, but I want him to be involved in all the decisions.        Did anyone else find this?  I don't expect him to sit with me pouring over bridal mags and getting excited over the difference between duck egg blue and corn blue, but I also want him to give me his views.      It's important he has his say, but he is so vague!  :-)

You're getting to be good friends, you think she maybe coming around and she might be starting to like you back, after all this time... and then she goes off and tells you that she just got back with her ex...      Something like this just happened to me... I'm so confused and upset. I'm not gonna give up tho, just because of the way I feel about her... She's just so special. The best thing I think is to just stay close...      Anybody else experience a similar situation? I never had anything with her, but I'm a bit heartbroken to say the least.  I thought we might have had something... Things just took about 10 steps backwards.  I'm gonna wait things out a bit, I think, and see what happens.
20090309141958AAs0lQr	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	How do i deal with a guy like this?	Asked this b4 but none of the answers helped...............      I saw this guy about a week ago who i have only talked to about three times.   He's acting really overprotective (for no apparent reason) and tried to stop his best mate and my 4 friends (all girls) from giving me hugs.    He then followed me around for then next hour trying to steal my phone, iPod & scarf, playing with my hair every time I stopped moving and he kept putting his arms around me.   After a while when I realised that subtle hints weren't working, I told him that he was starting to get a bit annoying and he needed to just chill for a while, he got all defensive and asked me what he was doing to which my my best friend told him "You know what your doing now back up or piss off."   He said "I'm sorry I don't think I was talking to you," turned to me and said "now tell me what's the problem coz I sure as hell have no idea."   I have no idea why but I burst into tears turned around and walked off. My best mate followed me and sat outside with me for about 20 minutes during which he sent me about 10 texts asking me what my problem was and why did I run off and saying stupid stuff. Later I went back inside with my friend and his best mate came up to me asked me if I was okay and gave me a hug while my friend went and got me a drink.      This morning i had a text from him saying about last night can we just forget and move on?      I want 2 forget and move on but don't know if i can some of the txts were reli nasty

20090309151139AAfY2SC	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	Need some words of encouragement...?	Hi, about 2 months ago my husband walked out on me and the kids. He text me about a week ago and told me that he's divorcing me.He didn't file. Nothing came of it, so last Thursday I filed for a divorce on my own. I had to do so, because he's only paid me 300 bucks since he left and we can't live on that. I have two boys 14 and 10. My husband has been running out on us for as long as I can remember. My oldest son told me today that he has over heard my husband and his friend talking about divorce. His friend told him that the best decision he ever made was to get a divorce... Well, now my husband is texting my son,  sort of fishing for some information. He keeps telling my son that he's going to get joint custody that he's not going to have to pay alimony and very little child support... I asked him NOT to text, or call my son anymore, but he still is. The kids and myself put up with years and years of verbal, emotional and often times physical abuse from him... My husband earns about 80k a year and I've always been a stay at home mom who home schools my boys. I'm having a really hard time with all of this emotionally. I'm a Christian that never believed in divorce. Just any words of encouragement, or advice would be appreciated. Thanks :)
20090309135141AAfPLrR	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	How do I convince him?	I cheated on my boyfriend over a year ago. It was a one night thing that I regret immensly. We dated for another 10 months, but he never really got over it and eventually broke up with me. Now it's been 4 months since he broke up with me and we are both so crazy about each other, we're desperately trying to work things out. He needs to know what made me do what I did back when I cheated on him and I don't know how to explain in better than I already have. Pretty much I've told him that I was immature at the time, easily swayed by my best friend who didn't like him, we'd been fighting at the the time so I was mad at him and the guy was an old flame from highschool. It is something I hate more than anything about myself. I just don't know how to convince him why it happened, that I'm sorry and that it won't happen again. How do I explain what happened back then and that that's not me anymore?

That the lady who cleaned their house when he was a boy was sexual with him. When he was 8 she would tell him she would show him her breasts if he cleaned whatever task she needed done then from there it got more sexual where she would go down on him have him go down on her and at 12 they had sex. He wasn't bragging at all just being open about what happened. (BTW she was 19 when it all started)      How would this effect a boy, he has always been very sexual as an adult and had fidelity issues when he was a married man.      Thoughts?

20090309121345AAmhi9M	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	Why is my Stepmom withdrawn lately?	It seems like lately she doesn't really want us to be around.  She's been our Stepmom for over 15 years and now has a step-grandbaby.  When we come to visit or stay for the weekend it seems like it's a really big deal even though my Dad is always wanting us to visit.  She also doesn't jump to hold the baby like everyone else does.  When I try to converse with her it feels uncomfortable and short like she doesn't really want to open up and talk.  Other times she is fine and chats away.  I just don't know what to think anymore and my husband and I really feel more like a burden staying with them when we visit.  We pick up after ourselves and help out as much as possible when we visit.  She also works Saturdays and then dives into church projects on Sundays and that takes priority sometimes to even our visits.

When i as little my brother was at boarding school my father was always away on business, so i was pretty much raised by nannies, until i went of to boarding school when i was eight.   I am still at boarding school and termly board, but when it comes to holidays and half term, my father never seems to be around so it falls on my big brothers shoulders, to pick me up and sort everything out.       He lives in London, and works for one of my fathers companies and is constantly on the go. I feel really bad that he has to look after to me, but on the other hand he is so annoying and strict. I was fifteen minutes late home from a friends house over half term, i let myself into the house, and was confronted by my brother, he grabbed my arm and frog marched me to my bedroom, then proceeded to lecture me about time keeping and sent me to bed without supper. Everything i do he seems to have some complaint about, whether it is how i make my bed, or that he wants me to eat more, he even smacked the back of my legs because i called him a loser. I just really want him to lighten up and stop him acting so paternal. What can i do?

20090309143904AA3FzMY	Family & Relationships;Friends	What would you do if someone called you a whore?	I was called a whore, by my "friends." I cried for hours which made me just feel worse. I felt backstabbed and rejected. They told me they thought I dressed like a whore and they told me they thought that I thought I was better than everyone else. I am not like that at all! I was so angry. I hate when people think that when it's clearly untrue. Im a christian girl. Do you think I would honestly want to be noticied as a "whore?" So, I talked with my mom about it and she gave me advice. Then me and my friend Rachel left the people who I used to call my "friends" and went to a different table where I had other friends. But I wish I could have made the other girls feel bad. I know that sounds really bad, but I wanted to show them what they did was retarted and downright unnacceptable with me. What would you have done?
20090309120037AAUh7oT	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Girls Please help quickly  Important  need to know?	This may not sound like a big deal but it is.   This girl that I really really like, who is quiet. ( I am extremely quiet) had her birthday today, So I wanted to say happy b-day while her friends weren't around (or at least 1 other friend) I got a chance to do this at the end of the day , and my friend was all GO! GO! GO! loudly when shwe was walking by and pushed me. I was just about to get the guts to say Happy B-Day but then comes Colin and he says "What was that all about" I would've still had the chance. But then comes Cody! He said "Sam , why do you always fool around, and what were ypu and Nick doing?" Then he looks at the girl I like and here friend, and he says "Ohhhh.... I think I know why" so I said "Cody you are wrong,' and then he walked infront of me , and ruined my perfectly good chance. So now , I haven't said happy b-day      Now, my question for girls is,    Would you still like me , and would it have the same effect if toimmorow I said "happy belated birthday" or "I hope you had a happy birthday"   I really like this girl.

Today I went to the park with my 3 year old cousin, and this older kid about 16, started to swear around her and getting in her face.

I said i didnt think friends was the right word, and she said that we have a unique friendship, and then that we had a different friendship to our friends. This got me quite down, and i was thinking. Does she consider us friends? Or is she too shy to give anything away? I really want to know if im wasting my time.
20090309114311AAs0CgL	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Got my 16 yr old Gf pregnant, im 18?	Hey, So I found out from my gf 2 weeks later than she's pregnant. We have a long distance relationship. She's live in Chicago, I live in Toronto.       To make a long story short, her parents don't like me cause they can't be bothered to take the time to get to know me or even talk to me. Anyways, my gf is making it sound like there going to kick her out of the house. So she'll move in my house with me. If her parents wanted to press charges, would if effect me if I lived in Canada?       I personally don't think they will press charges, because I don't think they would want to make the baby have no dad, and the fact that I can provide for my gf and our kid because I am a qualified electrician.      But the question is, if they wanted to press charges, would it affect me since I don't live in the U.S.?

20090309121603AAxNLZw	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	I don't know if I am in love with my husband anymore and I need help?	I love him, but I don't know what's wrong with me. He irritates me all the time. Everything he does just bothers me. And he likes to bother me. He acts like an annoying teenager a lot of the time. Mainly, he just wont give me space and wants to be around me ALL DAY. He just hovers over me. I'm never alone. I go to work all day and come home and he's there, acting like he's attached to my hip. If I'm cooking dinner, he is seriously behind me on my heels following me, until I say "what are you doing? STOP!" and then he gets his feelings hurt.       I never really want to have sex with him. That's my main concern that I don't understand what the reason is. I think it's because he makes me so closterphobic all the time. He's always all over me. I can't stand it. It's like I can't breath. When I want to go hang out with friends, he gets sad and like always makes me feel bad about it, or if I'm getting ready to go, he is right beside me irritating me about going until I finally say "fine, I'm not going".       We have no money. We are able to pay our bills and buy a few groceries every month, but I would like to have extra to maybe put into a savings account (is that so bad?). I have been actively looking for a higher paying job for a while, but he refuses to even look. Says it doesn't matter b/c we have enough to pay his bills and he's not finding another job. He only gets like 30 hours a week.       I just don't know what to do. I don't know if I should tell him or not? He is so sensitive most of the time. I know he would just get mad and not talk to me. I don't want to leave him, but he makes me so angry just being around him I don't know ho much longer I can take it.

20090309131957AAEQOji	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	I am confused about a situation that I am in. What should I do?	I have a boyfriend who is really good friends with a hot girl friend of mine. I introduced them to each other and they hang out a lot and talk a lot. I am in a different city than the two of them. They both live in the same apartment complex. He does tell me when they hang out and it's never just the two of them.       Lately though, I have started to have some suspicions. He used to always talk about her to me on the phone and I kind of just ignored it at that time. Later on, I told him exactly how I felt about the amountof time he spends with her and that I dont really like it that much. A few weeks after that conversation, he goes out to some club with her and some other mutual friends of ours and I found out that he tickled her. I also found out that she hesitated at first (which I am hoping and thinking that was out of respect of our friendship), but after a while..she gave in. There have been other instances where I have felt that there could be something going on. Since me and my boyfriend live in diferent cities, we dont get to see each other that much. I am alway more than eager to meet him, but he doesnt show any interest in it. I remember one time when he came to visit me,but he brought along some other mutual friends of ours. The girl was there and she had told me that she would call me when she was ready, so that we could all go out. I told my boyfriend that I already talked to the girl, but he still called her. For Valentines day, he dd come to see me, but he asked he girl if she wanted to come too. What in the world is up with that?      Now, I dont have any evidence or proof. I do trust my boyfriend and my (girl) friend. I wuld hope that if there was anything going on, oe or both of themwould tell me. I am just so confused about what to do. If someone could post up some advice, that would be great. Thank you!

I think he may feel the same about me, i am the only friend that is girl he has, we get along so well, and we are always with eachother, i catch him looking at me when he is in conversation with one of his friends and some of the stuff he says to me, gives me hints that he may feel the same, like he directly told me that he likes his girls with waxed legs! (being the gullable fool i did wax mine, ouch!!) i mean he wouldn't say something like that knowing that i like him, when he doesn't feel the same, because he isn't the type to lead soemone on. He has told a close friend of mine he does really like me, but then told other people he just liked me as a friend. As you can imagine this is very confusing!   But another dilemma is that his best friend likes me, his friend knows that i don't feel the same way and that i like his best friend, but i am scared it has effected my chances with the guy i truely do like, because i know he wouldnt want to hurt his best friend. The fact of the matter is we are both really shy, and wouldn't know what to say to eachother if the topic came up, im really confused what to do, any advice you gave me would be greatly appreciated.

20090309142652AADhVjN	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	Am I under any obligation to speak to her?	My husband and I are seperated and most likely divoricing.  My mother in law calls me multiple times a day and if I dont' answer her she leaves me nasty messages.  My husband and I have one child and my mother in law says that she just wants to know how her granddaughter is doing, keep in mind she has never done this before until we decided seperate and she only sees her about once a month if that, and she only lives 15 min away.  Anyway, I feel if she truely wants to know how her granddaughter is she can call her son(my husband) and ask him.  Not to mention that when all this happend she told me that it would be very sad if we ended up getting divoriced and then told my husband that divoricing me is the best thing to ever happen to him because I am crazy and he could do better then me.  Well thank you in advance for the answers.

20090309144034AAaayfN	Family & Relationships;Friends	Should I tell him I how feel?	I have been friends with this guy for about 10 months now. I really care and like him but i'm afraid that if I tell him how I feel about him that it will either scare him or make things weird between us when we hangout. The only problem is that I met him through an ex-fling...he asked me one day If anything happend before I met him and I said yes but it was a long time ago...what should I do? Should I let him go and just remain friends only or should I be patient and see where things may go? But I don't want to keep waiting and still hangout when maybe nothing will come out of this in the end and I may just end up hurting myself? Any advice?

20090309144527AAMb4We	Family & Relationships;Friends	How do I reconcile this situation?	I'm 22 and have recently had a falling out with a friend I've had since high school. It's awful because I feel like fall-outs are for 15 year olds and the whole thing seems so petty.   The problem was when she told me a "secret" and I told my boyfriend. I then told her I had told him and she went absolutely mental. I apologised of course but could not take back what I have done. I tell my boyfriend everything as he has been a better friend to me over all these years than this girl friend has.    She is a very selfish person and has never been there for me, I enjoy going out with her on nights out but it has just happened that we are "old friends"- I don't feel extremely close to her.    I tried to make things up with her but she threw it back in my face saying she "didn't trust me for $h*t" Now I couldn't care less about the friendship but I think at this age it's such an inconvenience to be tip-toeing around especially when we have so many good friends in common. I want to be civil, but I don't want to have to grovel for a friendship that means so little to me.    What do I do?

Lets say you broke up with your girl/boy friend and you were regretting it, upset about it etc, the usual feelings after a break up... If someone who you where friends with... but not VERY close with, asked you what happened, would you tell them?      e.g, they ask you how your feeling, what happened etc, would you tell them this...       If so, why?   If not why?       Do you think it'll make you vulnerable.

20090309150340AAokh9m	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	In love with a girl, but she seems to be interested in my best friend. Help please!?	It all started for 2 moths ago. The girl contacted me by msn and we started to chat. The chemistry was good between us and we talked about almost everything.       Then i felt in love with her. I asked her if she would like to do something one day. She seemed very interested in that, and she wanted to bring her friend (she is pretty shy) and i brought my friend too. We had very much fun and we enjoyed it. At the the end of the "date" i gave her a hug and she seemed pretty comfortable with it.      The following day she tried to reach contact with me tough sms calls etc. I was friendly to her. She wanted to do something, but unfortunately i was busy then.      After that day she has avoided me indirect like being not interested in talking etc. I have tried several times, but she won't open up again. I try as best as i can to, but she seems not interested anymore.       My friend has helped me allot in this situation helping me find subjects and so on talking to her. The problem now is that she seems int rested in my friend atm. and it bothers me allot. Now i feel like both of them have let me down and i feel like ****. I have problems sleeping at night, being angry and so on because of all my thoughts about her.   Now i have invited her to do something one day this week, but i don't know what to do?

20090309151615AAvaE0c	Family & Relationships;Friends	Help Me! This Kid Makes Me Angry Beyond Belief!!!!!?	THE KEVIN STORY:   he used to be my friend when we were little, but over the years hes gotton very bad. VERY bad. i HATE him now. he used to be fine and he got alot more annoying. he has space problems where he has to stand close to people and touch them too much. he also never wipes his nose, and thats not why i hate him but it grosses me out. (and if you tell him to wipe it he says "then dont look!") he also has anger issues and just picks fights and starts stuff with everyone. but hes a weak little flimsy person. he is incredibly mean and annoying and when he gets mad he says "i hope you and your family dies of cancer!" which really gets me mad and hate him that much more. he does stupid stuff like he hates russia just because they shot down a space shuttle in a destroy all humans game. he thinks he knows everything about religion when he knows nothing at all. (i am catholic and i live just around the corner from the church.) well, kevin lives next to the church, but hes the most un-religeous person i know. he always says things like "allah rocks" and things like that. (i have no problem at all with muslims, but kevin makes me mad because he is supposed to be christian, and he lives next to the church.) he also says things like "i am sort of a christian but not really because me and my family don't go to church and obbey all the rules so im sort of not even a christian." he likes to praise buddah too. (spelling may be wrong on buddah.) hes a BIG poser. what really makes me mad is he cries and whines and gets whatever he wants. he hits him parents until he has his way and swears at them. he is 14 mind you. and e still doesnt get yelled at or anything. his parents also go and buy him expensive phones, ipods, and computers. his grandma bought a new SUV just so he can listen to his new ipod touch when hes in the car with her. (its a car that plugs into the ipod.) all just so he can listen to his poser music. you see, the school i go too is a school over run by emos, goths, skaters, punks, and metalheads. i am a metalhead (i also listen to some punk too.) i am friends with mostly everyone in the school. but kevin is a big huge poser. he used to wear like 3rd grade cartoon clothes at the beggining of the year that barely fit him, and all of the sudden about 2 months ago he started wearing this disturbed shirt. now i like disturbed, (not one of my favorites, but not bad. i preffer suicide silence, dimmu borgir, and job for a cowboy, mostly any death/black  metal, or any kind of metal at all. i also like everything down to black sabbath, judas priest and iron maiden.) anyways, where was i? o yeah, he comes to school with a disturbed shirt that is like 10 sizes too big, and his stupid pants he never washes. (he also doesnt shower and he brags about his greassy hair, like "dude i havent showered in 2 weeks!") well, so hes a poser and doesnt even like disturbed, and only knows one song. he also gets all of his music from wrestling and guitar hero games, which makes me very mad. then, 3 days ago he came to school with a a7x (avenged sevenfold) shirt on. i asked him what his favorite song was, if he even listens to them, and if he even knew they were a band. he replied "i dont know" to all three. that infuriates me because i also like to listen to a7x. he today came to school and had a iron maiden shirt on, which yanked the final straw out of the hands of the people in my school. he asked me today "are you mad at me? you seem like it." and i told him hes being a stupid poser. then he started sayng "no im not my aunt bought me this shirt and i found out my favorite avenged sevenfold song was bat country. " and i was like "screw you! you just went home and looked at popular a7x songs. which he did he told his "friend", who also isnt his friend but was a little kid friend to him like i was, but he has to be nice to him despite how much he hates him because unluckily for him their parents are best friends :P. he always takes my friends and my favorite songs, bands, and what have you. hes a huge poser. and its not like hes depressed because people hate him because he deliberatly tries to make people hate him he has told me and my friends. i think he wants to be the cool kid who can beat on people, but hes too immature to do anything. (hes also obbsessed with digimon videogames, cards, and action figures from when hewas like five.) well thats about it thanks for reading this. please tell me what to do about him. i also hate him and do not want to be friends with him. please help!

I am reposting because I didnt get a clear answer last time. So basically, I know that she can avoid going to jail, but the thing is I dont want her to pay the court costs. Thats just a waste of money, the other thing is: Are you guys sure that they wont do anything to me if i lied. I mean I could tell them that the marks were a result of intercourse, and they werent bite marks, but they might ask why did I lie when it happenned!!!!       I fought with my fiance, her dad called the police, I didnt press charges but the state did, how can we dropit?   They took some pictures of the bite marks I had and told me that the state wants to press charges. Now we are back together, how can we drop the case without me saying that I lied about the marks because I didnt, she wants me to do that, but I am afraid that they gonna accuse me of false accusations. Please answer i you know. Thanks      We are planning to get married also. Please answer only if you know, and please save me your advise, such as "Why are you still with her" coz i am not going to leave her

20090309115712AATb6nU	Family & Relationships;Weddings	Wedding Ring Question - what would you do?	My engagement ring has a rectangular center stone that sticks out plus side stones and a regular wedding band won't sit next to it.   I've gone to the jeweler and they've brought in sample bands with cutouts/notches and nothing fits properly.   My fiance is encouraging me to just get the custom-made band, actually he is all for me getting two so the bands wrap around my engagement ring (it does look awesome).  The estimate is $800 to $1,500 per band - which is REALLY expensive and not in the wedding budget.   We are both working really hard to pay for the upcoming wedding without credit and we are on-track, and at the same time I am paying down my pre-marriage debt (trying to payoff my car & student loans early).      I had the idea to buy a regular band and move my e-ring to my right hand, wait until our 5th or 10th anniversary THEN get the custom made bands and maybe we could sneak off for a vow renewal together at that time.  Our wedding rings aren't going to match - so there is no issue there.        I just want to know if I am nuts to keep the cost down now (especially considering the economy) and splurge on a future anniversary for the bands that are right for my e-ring?

20070411215838AAkvIkx	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	How do you get over someone who you're SO emotionally attached to, no matter how badly he's hurting you?	Three years ago, I met this boy. My first year at college was his last, but we've kept in touch through the internet. He's a professional actor, talented musician, and SO handsome. He's very flirtatious and sexual. He makes me feel so special when i'm with him- he's very huggy/kissy/touchy. But then i know he flirts with other girls too and so i wonder how much it really means. He came to visit the college recently and I saw him. It was like he never left; I got butterflies. It felt so good to be in his arms. When I talk to him online, he mostly talks about sex. There was a time I would have done just about ANYTHING for him, but this upsets me. I feel like he's sending me mixed messages, because he's so sweet and SO flirtatious with me yet he dosnt seem to want to move past friendship. I dont get anything out of meaningless sex (no, I havent slept with him), I want an emotional connection. I'm in so much pain over this. I dont want to hurt but the thought of letting him go hurts too!

So, I leave his house to come back home and my brother, sister, mom, and him think I need to suck it up and stay their whether or not who he invites.      I just feel that he could hang out another time with his friends, not when we are with him.      What is your opinion?
20070518132226AAYvWgP	Family & Relationships;Family	I feel torn, please help! Complicated!?	My mom and my aunts and uncles are fighting over inheritance and stuff that happened years ago.  The three of them of the four get along good but my mom is sueing them over dumb issues and instigating things.  I love my aunts uncles and cousins and want to continue a relationship with them and I don't see why not becasue they are nice to me too. They are acting mature about it all.  My uncle invited me to his wedding and my mom got wind of it and is trying to guilt me out of going.  Shouldn't that be her dispute with them and I should not be a part of it?  I am 29.  My Aunts and Uncles treat me like an adult and keep me out of it, mom does not.  What should I do?

I honestly want to go to college and be successful but my parents think I'll just end up like my brother and just think I'm not going to be any better.      I don't know what to do since I feel like a bad son.   I do get pretty good grades in school.

20090309115701AA0daDg	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	Why would he say I seem hard to please?	Is it asking too much to meet a guy that doesn't already have a girlfriend?   Is it asking too much to want someone who will show up on time or at least give the courtesy of a phone call.  Someone who will respect and appreciate me.  Someone who doesn't play games and is really into me.  Someone who is willing to meet me half way and doesn't expect me to do all the work?  Someone with a job and not a lot of kids and baby mama's to look after.  Someone to take me out and have a good time with, is that asking too much?      Why would he say I was hard to please?

20090309115145AAStK3u	Family & Relationships;Weddings	Help with online wedding invitation sites?	Help please!!   Anyone know of good online sites to order wedding invitations from?         I thought I had ours all ordered last night -- got a message today that the site I was using has been having problems with people's orders for several weeks now and didn't get our full info - now very leary about ordering from them. (although loved the invitation and it took alot of time to get the right wording, fonts, colors,etc.)   But looking now for another online site to use.        The websites that are coming up when I google I'm not finding anything similar to the invite we wanted to order, and am running out of sites to look at.        So looking for Yahoo answers help!      Would like sites that people have used previously and have been happy with.      Also --- how long did your invitations take to arrive - whether you ordered online or locally?      Thanks

20090309120156AAyNZdc	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	What purpose does GUILT have...?	when you feel like you have done nothing wrong?   This might sound like a contradiction but I have taken the blame for things a didn't do since childhood. Now as an adult I feel guilty if I speak my mind after someone else has hurt me tenfold. They don't care so why should I...but I do..and I take blame.    I honestly think that if someone in my life just for ONCE would walk up to me and say that they were sorry for what they did, this cycle could be broken.   So what purpose does the guilt I feel have besides just making ME miserable?      I post this in the marriage section bc it's about close relationships.   I appreciate any good approach but please..no rude comments.   Thanks guys.

20070221125436AAZcdo8	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	I look too young for my age and I hate it?	I figured the reason why strangers, my parents and many ppl I know don't take me seriously is b/c I look SO young for my age. I'm 25 but b/c I have a baby face and a skinny, underdeveloped body is b/c people think I'm in my early teens. I try to change my hairstyle, act more mature. When I'm with my daughter, everyone thinks I'm her sister or babysitter and my mom is her mom. I know I'm going to be happy when I get older but it sucks when people talk down to me or ignore me.  I only had one friend in college b/c I look really young.

My husband, who died on 3rd December 2008, always managed the household bills. I still have difficulty getting used to doing this on my own as I have no head for figures. I worry about the possibility of having more money going out than coming in. I only have my state pension coming in every week. I would like to hear from other senior citizens, especially women, who have had to overcome these fears and how they coped. I have no-one to help me.
