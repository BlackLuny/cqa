Well that in essence is what you are doing.  Instead of short changing yourself and your career you should be on forums and on-line writing associations that can not only point you in the write direction but encourage and prepare you for the industry of publishing.  For one thing your age is not listed on any letter you send to an agent or publisher.  My publisher never asked my age AT ALL, NOT ONCE.  In fact if we hadn't become friends I may never have even seen the woman face to face.  I met my agent one time only.  I've never been to the publishing offices, contracts were mailed, I submitted my manuscript by mail did the edits by e-mail.  The little bio at the back of my novels and on my website don't mention my age either.  Age is designated only if you are underage to sign contracts because you are a minor and if it is utilized as marketing 'Youth Authors' need that type of publicity in order to sell.  You are too old to be considered a Youth Author though you may write in the young adult genre.<br>       Honestly go over to the Science Fiction Fantasy Writers Association website and click around there for a few days, bet you'll find stuff on there you've never known before.  You young age is only a disadvantage because you apparently aren't mature enough to be taking your career in writing seriously enough by immersing yourself in the publishing world.<br>     How about Fangs, Fur, & Fey wonderful blog about urban fantasy, or Backspace which quite a few of my author friends hang around because it gets into the BUSINESS of writing.  Romance writers have a NATIONAL ASSOCIATION.  Wouldn't you thing Horror and Thrill have something similar.<br>       Now if your age has been holding you back and you've had this experience already consider it isn't the actual number that is disgusting the people in the industry but your lack of knowledge.  Again think of the lawyer you're going to be by asking a nurse what you should do.  If I were a publisher and you submitted your work without being armed with the appropriate knowledge of the industry I'd ask your age and tell you 'you have time to learn' and then dismiss you.  There is so much more to publishing than just writing well.  And if you don't want to learn any more than you do and you wish to write consider e-publishers who never have to actually see you or speak to you.<br>  You don't hand in your manuscript with your birth certificate or a resume with your birthday on top for crying out loud...<br>  <br>  |`|1oh4BN32aa	Its way too easy to say you won't be. It's possible that you will be. What's of most concern is that you would be cold-calling them by given them an unsolicited manuscript. Publishers don't sit at their mailboxes waiting for good manuscripts to come in.<br>  <br>  Try publishing short work in a fiction journal or entering articles into a magazine first. There's a really good book called The Writers' Market published every year, it gives writers guidelines and contact info for a lot of places looking for fiction, journalism, technical writing, etc. If you get some stuff out there like that, you will have a better shot with your novel.|`|Xc02z608aa	If the writing is good quality, publishers don't care if you are 20 or 200.

In reality if you had other books to show earlier, then that would be a great help irrespective of age. But since you don't seem to have that, the first time you may be a little on the wrong side of the bargain with your publisher (many of them won't reject though). Next time it might be easier. Keep looking for a better bargain - if you keep trying you are bound to get a better deal than your first one (unless you get lucky right at the first shot).<br>  <br>  Good luck.<br>  <br>  [ <a href="http://www.webliterature.net" rel="nofollow">http://www.webliterature.net</a> ]|`|q2D7zpwqaa	The author of Eragon was 16 when he started writing the book.

T85WCEltaa	I enjoyed the book (and movie) of Sense & Sensibility, but Persuasion would have to be my all-time favourite Jane Austen.  The whole storyline revolving around the unresolved, simmering just under the surface love between Anne Elliot and Captain Wentworth is so spellbinding, and the awful Sir Walter and Elizabeth, and selfish hypochondriac sister Mary and the Musgroves are such great characters.  The twists and turns that happen in Anne's life after Captain Wentworth enters it again are great, and the ending is delightful.  I also really enjoyed the 1995 film adaptation, and think Ciaran Hinds made the perfect Frederick Wentworth!  |`|ek8iGsRfaa	Pride and Prejudice <br>  <br>  because it's such a classic story and I love the romance between Darcy and Elizabeth...that story pretty much set the stage for every romance novel or movie that came after it. <br>  <br>  I also love Sense and Sensibility and Masfield Park too though...Mansfield Park acutally deals with some pretty serious issues that were faced during that time period.|`|qEh84eqNaa	P&P.

And also because I was able to imagine the characters and the scenes more easily.|`|GCfQOloCaa	Pride and Prejudice<br>  <br>  It has pretty scenery, the characters are realistic, plus they made tons of movies so it's fun to compare them with the book. |`|REIMVY4Daa	Pride and Prejudice <br>  <br>  It's the only one I've watched/read :)|`|ssoZ33XIaa	Pride and Prejudice is my favorite as well, but since everyone else has already said that, Persuasion is a close second.  I love the main character, Anne Elliot and the man she loves, Captain Wentworth.  Unlike Austen's other heroines, Anne does not fall for the wealthy man of similar or greater social standing, but continues her long-standing affection for Captain Wentworth, who she knew long before he became a captain and made money of his own.  Anne lives in a very restricted social circle, always allowing others to put their needs before hers, and having only one really friend and confidant.  Her father and elder sister are more concerned with maintaining their appearance and rank, despite his having squandered much of his money since his wife's death.  Her younger sister is a bit of a hypochondriac, married to the son of a local land owner (he's possibly a squire?  I forget at the moment).  But Anne is kind, prudent, and constant in her affections.  She is a sad character when the story begins, but in the end she is able to find happiness, love and the appreciation she deserves.|`|tiKEy7uraa	I like better "Pride and Prejudice"<br>  1) for its heroine which is the most witty and outspoken one and is a little more passionate than the others (the worst heroine for me is Emma, I so want to slap her sometimes)<br>  2) because on writing terms her style is at her best (I never liked for example the way "sense and sensibility" was written with small and mechanistic sentences) <br>  3) and because it is the funniest book she has written and I can say also the one where the plot has no great lapses of the exciting (which "mansfield parks" has)<br>  <br>  The second best is "Persuasion" and there are some funny instances on "Northanger Abbey" too.
pt6wIlS1aa	I imagine the Brontes (Wuthering Heights), Jane Austen (Pride and Prejudice), Mary Shelley (Frankenstein), Thackeray (Vanity Fair), Charles Dickens (Great Expectations), Oscar Wilde (Picture of Dorian Gray), Joseph Conrad (Heart of Darkness), D.H.

kUE3Ddktaa	"Coming out," in Austen's time, referred to the point at which a young woman was formally presented to society as an adult woman and thus eligible for courtship and marriage - when she came out, she was making her "debut." It usually involved a formal ball or a party.<br>  <br>  If you are familiar with debutante balls for young women in the very traditional parts of the American South, those are a watered-down version of that tradition. It's also similar to the quinceanera tradition of Latin American societies.|`|Fh2IGTpaaa	Often at that time the upper class society would have coming out parties. It's kind of like introducing a young girl to society who has reached the age to marry. Like a rite of passage she would be formally announcing that she has become a woman and that she is looking for canidates for matrimony. (kind of like a Bar/Bat Mitzvah)<br>  |`|AA10478980	You'd had several good explanations of what "coming out" means.  There are a number of online study guides for Pride and Prejudice.

In other words, it would mean the woman is not eligible for marriage and she has been "brought out" from the corner of her home to the worldly society so that she can mix with men and finally get married.

uPAl4Jb7aa	She was talented. The simple fact that she is still read and regarded widely also elicits what other think. Remember, she was not the only writer or the only romance writer or of her era - and in spite of that is is only one of the very few who are still remembered.

Sure she can be a bit heavy-handed with symbolism and the like, but melodrama is inherently part of the style.  I don't fancy her work, but anything of that nature wouldn't be my cup of tea to begin with.|`|9m896rqXaa	Not sure of all the literary stuff, but I read Wuthering Heights. It was hard to get into, but after Healthcliff came back I couldn't put it down. I read through my sister's softball game and my homework. And I loved it..the story, the vivid pictures and the end
4ilM2hCwaa	Well, seeing as I despise both Plath and Bronte, I will recommend something for you that would be a quite a bit more fun.<br>  The Scarlet Pimpernel by Baroness Orczy<br>  The Murders in the Rue Morgue by Edgar Allen Poe<br>  Around the World in 80 Days by Jules Verne<br>  A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court OR The Tragedy of Pudd'Nhead Wilson by Mark Twain.|`|irPhrsGraa	You could get a lot of information on Tess of the D'urbervilles because there has just been a TV series made of it. Pride and Prejudice is also highly recommended. Wuthering Heights is great. A classic credit to english literature. Another one would be 'Love in the Time of the Cholera'. Its brilliant. Hope this helps!|`|tmGRe2Jraa	I loved Wuthering Heights, but I think some people find it a little dry.  If you don't mind something rather long (and Russian!), Tolstoy's "Anna Karenina" is one of my favorites.  "Les Liaisons Dangereuses" (Dangerous Liaisons) is also pretty nifty, if you can get past the written letter format.  As for American novels, I loved "The Great Gatsby", and "Catcher in the Rye" is also a classic.|`|ALhBWx8Maa	The Bell Jar is a fantastic book!

I think I got a little tired of his work after reading "The Old Curiosity Shop", Nell was just that bit too perfect for me.<br>  <br>  I will be keeping an eye on this question though - I would like to see what other users thought of Little Dorrit and if, in their opinions, it is worth reading.

It is both a gothic novel and a romance for example.<br>  <br>  Wuthering Heights opens with a minor character, Lockwood, moving to a tiny Yorkshire village, where he encounters his cruel and eccentric landlord, a man by the name of Heathcliff. He spends the night in Heathcliff's home, Wuthering Heights, which is haunted by the ghost of a woman named Catherine. Nelly, a long time servant of the family then tells Lockwood the story of the doomed romance between Heathcliff and Catherine. The second part of the novel tells the story of the equally tragic romance between Catherine's daughter, Cathy and Heathcliff's son Linton.<br>  <br>  It is a good book, though difficult to read in places due to Bronte's use of Yorkshire dialect.
bdb1fbb0a6c3f2b002837336162fe1efaa	Aqui v?o as minhas respostas:<br>  <br>  1 - “Quando ouvires os aplausos do triunfo, que ressoem também aos teus ouvidos os risos que provocastes com os teus fracassos.” – (Josemaria Escrivá). <br>  Essa frase quer dizer que, por maior que seja o nosso momento de glória, nunca devemos esquecer dos nossos erros e dos momentos ruins pelos quais passamos por conta dos nossos fracassos. Eu concordo com ela e quase sempre a aplico à minha vida.<br>  <br>  2 - "Passa-se com o homem o mesmo que com a árvore. Quanto mais quer crescer para o alto e para a claridade, tanto mais suas raízes tendem para a terra, para baixo, para as trevas, para a profundeza - para o mau." – (Friedrich Wilhelm Nietzsche).<br>  Essa fra se quer dizer que, quando mais o homem busca crescer, tanto pessoalmente quanto financeiramente, mais ele tante a se tornar uma pessoa ruim e gananciosa. Eu n?o concordo com essa frase.<br>  <br>  3 - “Odeio quem me rouba a solid?o, sem em troca me oferecer verdadeira companhia.” – (Nietzsche).<br>  Esse frase diz que, se uma pessoa n?o demonstra ser verdadeiramente amiga e companheira, n?o vale a pena estar com ela. Eu concordo com essa frase.<br>  <br>  4 - “Jamais afirmarei ser o número um. Mas nunca admitirei ser o número dois.” – (Bruce Lee).<br>  Essa frase diz que n?o devemos nos gabar por sermos os melhores, mas também n?o devemos deixar que os outros passem por cima de nós. Eu concordo com essa frase.<br>  <br>  5 - “Convivo com o medo de morrer e ele me fascina.” – (Ayrton Senna).<br>  Essa frase que dizer que o autor da mesma n?o sente medo da morte, pelo contrário, que isso é uma espécie de motiva??o para ele.<br>  <br>  6 - “O idiota fala. O tolo discute. O sábio escuta.” – (Desconhecido).<br>  Essa frase é de William Shakespeare e a frase correta é "O tolo grita. O inteligente fala. O sábio cala." Eu concordo parcialmente com essa frase, pois eu acho que n?o é uma atitude inteligente gritar para os outros. Uma atitude inteligente é conversar calmamente e expondo argumentos verdadeiros e coerentes. Entretanto, eu n?o acho que seja uma atitude melhor ficarmos calados.<br>  <br>  7 – “S?o como os sepulcros dos mortos. Embora belos por fora, bolor e podrid?o passam por dentro. Nada revelam sen?o a imundície.” – (N?o tenho certeza, mas acho que seja de Augusto dos Anjos).<br>  Imagino que o autor esteja se referindo às pessoas que s?o bonitas, porém maldosas. Concordo com essa frase.<br>  <br>  8 – “Sábio é aquele que sabe que nada sabe.” – (Provérbio Chinês).<br>  Eu concordo parcialmente com essa frase. Acho que uma pessoa sábia é aquela que tem no??o de que sempre há muito a aprender.<br>  <br>  9 – “O prego que se destaca é o mais martelado.” – (Provérbio Chinês).<br>  Em geral, as coisas acontecem assim mesmo. Se uma pessoa comete um erro grave, mas essa pessoa n?o se destaca muito, ela com certeza será menos criticada do que outra pessoa que é mais exposta e que cometeu um erro menos grave. Acho isso muito injusto, mas a vida costuma ser assim. Muitas vezes, por ter um brilho espacial, certas pessoas acabam sendo vítimas de inveja e da maldade dos outros.<br>  <br>  10 – “O importante é ganhar. Tudo e sempre. Esta história de que o importante é competir, n?o passa de demagogia.” – (Ayrton Senna).<br>  N?o concordo com essa frase. é claro que o ideal é a gente sempre conseguir vencer e atingir os nossos objetivos, mas creio que toda derrota serve como aprendizado e nos ajuda a crescer.<br>  <br>  11 – “Quando você n?o está feliz, é preciso ser forte para mudar. Resistir à tenta??o do retorno. Pois os fracos n?o chegam a lugar algum.” – (Ayrton Senna).<br>  Acho essa frase meio contraditória. Ao fazermos alguma mudan?a na nossa vida, em geral a gente refaz uma escolha equivocada, e isso, de certa forma, quer fizer que estamos retornando para desfazer um erro e sermos mais felizes. Eu também acho que devemos ser fortes para voltar atrás em alguns momentos e refazer algumas escolhas que nos trouxeram infelicidade.<br>  <br>  12 – “Quem quiser vencer deve aprender a lutar, perseverar e sofrer.” – (Bruce Lee).<br>  Concordo com essa frase! Quem quer vencer deve lutar e seguir em frente até atingir seus objetivos. O sofrimento é algo inevitável e que faz parte da vida.<br>  <br>  13 – “O homem perde saúde para conseguir dinheiro. Em seguida perde dinheiro para conseguir saúde.” – (Desconhecido).<br>  Gostei dessa frase e concordo com ela. Acho que, o ideal é a gente equilibrar qualidade de vida com crescimento profissional. Assim a gente n?o perde saúde e ganha dinheiro. é óbvio que em certos momentos a gente tem que abrir m?o de alguns hábitos saudáveis para conseguir dinheiro, mas acho que podemos compensar com outras atitudes saudáveis.<br>  <br>  14 – “A justi?a sem poder é vazia. Mas o poder sem a justi?a é apenas violência.” – (Oyama – O Lutador Lendário).<br>  Concordo com essa frase! Eu acho que a justi?a deve ser rígida, porém sábia e flexível também.<br>  <br>  15 – “Fa?a da pedra de trope?o, um degrau de subida. Transforme cada fato negativo, em uma experiência positiva.” – (Bruce Lee).<br>  Concordo plenamente! Devemos sempre tirar alguma experiência positiva de nossos erros e usá-la em prol do nosso crescimento.<br>  <br>  16 – “O vazio n?o pode ser definido. A coisa mais flexível n?o pode ser quebrada.” – (Bruce Lee).<br>  Concordo também! Acho que, embora em alguns momentos tenhamos que ser incisivos e fortes, a flexibilidade é uma virtude muito importante tanto na vida pessoal quanto na vida profissional; pois é ela o que, muitas vezes, nos torna mais resistentes aos desafios que surgem no nosso caminho.<br>  <br>  Obs.: Gostei de quase todas as frases. Espero que tenha gostado das minhas respostas, embora eles n?o tenham sido muito longas. Acontece que eu sou um cara muito objetivo e n?o consigo me prolongar demais e ser redundante.<br>  <br>  <br>  Abra?os!!!!!!|`|5Pv7lMSgaa	Nossa, você poderia dividir a sua pergunta|`|nXNAIAXRaa	1 - Você n?o é onipotente.<br>  2 - Quem tudo quer tudo perde.<br>  3 - Ninguém nunca irá te oferecer a verdadeira face. Ent?o: antes só do que mau acompanhado.<br>  4 - O gosto da derrota é amargo. N?o conseguimos falar depois dela.<br>  5 - O brilho da chama também atrai a mariposa. E ela se queima.<br>  6 - Uma boca e dois ouvidos. Devemos falar ou ouvir mais de acordo com essa propor??o?<br>  7 - Por fora, bela viola. Por dentro... Você é o que você diz, faz e come!!<br>  8 - O técnico do telégrafo foi demitido quando inventaram o computador.<br>  9 - Mais erra aquele que mais tenta.<br>  10 - Os louros da vitória existem há muito mais de mil anos.

Quando uma pessoa recebe algo sem esfor?o, ent?o n?o é sucesso, pois sucesso por defini??o é o contrário de fracasso, ou seja, a realiza??o de uma meta. Portanto, aquele que realmente triunfou, é porque tentou alcan?ar algum objetivo, que por maior parte das vezes, depende apenas dele.<br>  <br>  2- Os pensamentos de Nietzsche s?o bem interessantes. Pelo que eu entendi, ele quer dizer que quanto mais o ser humano busca respostas, recebe conhecimento, procura sabedoria, mais ele perde gosto pela vida, e adquire uma posi??o niilista em rela??o a vida. Aliás em muitos momentos eu me sinto assim.<br>  <br>  3- é como o dizer popular: Antes só que mal acompanhado. E é bem verdade. Amizades vazias e superficiais n?o fazem bem. Amigos que você conversaria sobre a "mina" que ele "azarou" na "balada" ontem, n?o s?o amigos verdadeiros. Um bom amigo é aquele que você pode falar: "Belo trabalho!", mas também pode falar: "Cara, vai se ferrar. Você tá sendo muito idiota." Amizade verdadeira é em essência a defini??o de amor.<br>  <br>  4- Frase muito boa. Bruce Lee quer dizer que se afirmar o número 1 é muito presun?oso, pois tal coisa seria praticamente impossível, já que lutadores inspiram-se nos antigos. E na verdade ser número é uma coisa relativa, ainda mais numa área t?o relativa quanto a luta, onde nem sempre o melhor lutador é aquele que vence. Eu trabalho com música, e vou dar portanto um exemplo prático. Existem por aí muitas listas de: "Os melhores guitarristas do mundo". E est?o lado a lado um guitarrista de heavy metal e um guitarrista de blues! Em áreas onde n?o se pode trabalhar com estatísticas, o termo "número 1" é além de imprudente. é completamente relativo, portanto inexistente.<br>  A segunda frase explica que ele n?o aceitará, n?o se conformará em ser o número 2, ou seja, ele vai lutar pra ser cada vez melhor. N?o melhor que o oponente. Mas sim melhor do que ele mesmo já é.<br>  <br>  Me desculpem mas está muito tarde e eu vou deixar de comentar todas as frases. Mas fica aí o meu ponto de vista, que mesmo que seja um tanto quanto "amador", por assim dizer, mas está ao menos bem organizado.

The text is almost always Hebrew, of course, but in the illuminated pages, they wrote the text as if it were one continuous drawn line, in shapes and spirals -- like drawing a spiral from the outside to the center, or drawing the outline of a rooster or a house, and then filling in the center and details (windows, doors, rows of shingles) with more lines of text.  <br>  <br>  Remember the kids puzzles (challenges, really) to draw from the beginning to the end of a shape without lifting your pencil from the paper even once?  Think of the ones that were the next step up from connect-the-dots puzzles.  Only these medieval artists used text that way.

I'm 14 and i take hip-hop, jazz, tap, company, and lyrical!  You should really join it!  You would have a fun time!|`|WxAjSjj2aa	I'm in the same boat as you.<br>  <br>  I've been in a conditioning class for working on the dance muscles because i can't pay for real classes. That class combined with my older age and perseverance in learning has actually made me a pretty good dancer.<br>  <br>  One of my friends went to a dance intensive called "The Pulse" which has many very famous choreographers who teach it. She came back and taught a dance by Mia Michaels which was an advanced dance that would take a while to teach inexperienced dancers. The entire class was given an hour to teach and practice it (me included) and I held myself pretty nicely. Being older is a nice advantage to learning everything because you have a more mature look at things than when you do when you're little.<br>  <br>  But there is a huge drawback to this. I've been vaguely taught technique and all of that but I still am not able to grasp the real fluid movement that it takes to make a dance look good. That's one thing that will only come with experience that might take you a while.<br>  <br>  Other than that you'll do pretty nicely.<br>  <br>  And don't be afraid to join a lower age class because when you're in there a lot of people that are younger might kind of look up to you as the older person (their adolescent god) and I'm pretty sure they'd be willing to help. If you really try hard and learn to learn (a good skill) then soon enough you'll be able to join your own age group.<br>  <br>  Addressing your last question there aren't really many videos that can help you learn dance. There are some that can teach advanced choreography to advanced dancers but i highly discourage looking at a dance video and trying to learn the dance. Trying to interpret the dance and being taught the dance is extremely different and many experienced dancers have a lot of trouble with it too.|`|loh35vJyaa	Your still young there is No age limit  a lot of schools do offer beginner classes  dont let anyone stop you or get in your way go & have fun  as for dance videos go there are a lot out there one of the best places you can buy them would be a dance supply store or on line or even a mail order catalog that sells dance supplys like dance distributors com or even a local video store in your area should have it as well  I would call the video store first before you go so you dont waste your time  as far as age goes I wouldnt worry  Im glad that you are showing interest to learn hip hop & jazz theres nothing wrong with that  for the average cost to join a class like that  your best bet would be to call up some schools in your area  one thing I want to point out  if a school requ ,s you  to sign a contract dont  walk away  what if you cant pay or what ever the case maybe the school can take some kind of action to collect thats what I mean by dont ever  sign  your safe & best bet is to pay as you go  like I said go have fun &enjoy it

37E2yPGjaa	i just recently got my quadruple piroutte en pointe. What i do to strenghten my weaker foot is have some one sit on my feet while my feet are stretched our in front of me so my toes touch the ground. Also, switching your pointe shoes to different feet each time you go en pointe can strengthen your weaker foot. You can also squat on the ground (but don't put your but on the floor only your hands and the soles of your feet should be on the floor and your legs should be bent.) Then go over your feet like a forced arch. That helps strenghten the front of your ankle. Hope i helped!|`|8ygky5g4aa	When you sit with your feet straight in front of you instead of just pointing and flexing, trace each letter of the alphabet with you weaker foot.

Sua2AJIvaa	The best thing to be sure of is to stay in character. Even if you mess up a line, it is ok. People mess up in real life, and the idea of a good performance is to make it look real. So, improvise, if you trip, handle it the way your character would, if you stumble on a line, just keep going, it will be ok, and you will get a better grade that way than if you fall out of character.|`|BzMQejGxaa	Don't:<br>  - tidy your hair out of the way unless you can do it discreetly in character<br>  - say 'i've forgotten my lines' or go 'um..er..I know this bit!'.

He doesn't want you winking or similing at him.|`|yTJit4U8aa	yes like she said DON'T BREAK CHARACTER!!<br>  also make sure you have fun with your character, make it your own just don't show yourself. that sounds a little rude, but unintended. You're that character, not you.<br>  <br>  Also, be sure to make your blocked moves look natural, don't carry them out in a robotic fashion, that's boring. Make it look real!!<br>  <br>  Another don't: don't look offstage! There was this freshman actress this year in the musical, and after every line she said, she would look offstage nondiscreetly for reassurance from her peers. it was distracting an took away from her character.<br>  <br>  if you mess up, no worries, just improv, that's a thing that a lot of directors look at, is how you handle the stress of acting, then of acting, messing up. Just take it as it comes.<br>  <br>  Personally, I try not to think about my lines at all when i'm not on stage. I am purely getting into character. If my character is mean, I act mean, and angry.

sunEk8NVaa	The Germans were too busy in Europe; they were in the midst of a life and death struggle with the Soviet Union. And plus, the Atlantic Ocean separated mainland Europe from America. If the Germans wanted to attack the US, they had to secure the Atlantic Ocean first. The problem is the British navy was always there to intervene and later on, the American navy came too.<br>  <br>  For the Japanese, they did bomb Pearl Harbor but that was not a prelude to an invasion of the US. The Japanese were not thinking of invading the US; they themselves were stuck in China. The war plan of the Japanese was to bomb Pearl Harbor, destroy the American navy, then conquer the Dutch East Indies and other Asian territories to supply their war effort. To invade the US would be too costly for the Japanese. Remember, they don't have plenty of natural resources. They needed to get their resources from other territories if they wanted to continue the war. To invade the US at that point in time would be suicidal. They needed to secure resource-rich areas first before they could try and invade a superpower. They didn't even want to invade the Soviet Union despite Hitler's continuous demands to do so. Same reason, lack of supplies. By the time, they conquered many places in East Asia, and were already sapping out their resources, the Americans had already rebuilt their navy. Thus, before the Japanese could launch other attacks against the US, they would have to destroy the American navy again, just like in Pearl Harbor. This, they failed to do.|`|AA12095483	It wasn't. The Japanese shelled cities on the California coast, firebombed the cities and forest areas along the west coast and occupied some of the Aleutian islands, which are part of Alaska. The Germans attacked New Brunswick, in Canada -|`|wnkoTEqVaa	Actually the Aleutian Islands were invaded and Japan toward the end of the war would put fire bombs to hot air balloons and they would use the wind and the balloons would travel to America. Only one or two went off one went off in 1945 and the other in the late 50s.<br>  <br>  Also the Germans did land saboteurs on long island and miami. <br>  <br>  The reason Germany could not attack America was because they needed a place to launch an attack. Moving a couple hundred thousand troops across the atlantic would be easily noticed. Also a plan would have to refuel and could not reach America and return.|`|kacLYFrHaa	This is incorrect. For one, the Japanese did attack the mainland. September 9, 1942 the I-25 surfaced off the coast of Oregon and launched an Yokosuka E14Y1 floatplane (the Glen to the Allies) crewed by Nobuo Fujita and Shoji Okuda  on a mission to set fire to Oregon's forests. During the war the Japanese had several sub types designed to carry aircraft, the largest of these was the I-400, the Sen Toku which were the largest subs of the war and could carry three Aichi M6A1 Seiran seaplanes. But smaller carrier subs were designed to carry at least one seaplane (the Type A Modified subs I-13 and I-14 carried two, the only ones outside of the I-400 series to carry more than one). I-25 was a Type B1.<br>  <br>  As stated, I-25 launched Fujita and Okuda (Fujita was the pilot Okuda the observer) on a mission to set the forests of Oregon ablaze. But this was not the I-25's first time to Oregon that year. June 21, 1942 the I-25 surfacednear the mouth of the Columbia River and shelled Fort Stevens with it's deck gun. She returned to her home port July 27th and set out for the mission to fire bomb Oregon's forests August 15th. To do this the plane carried a pair of 170 pound incendiary bombs. Fujita and Okuda did drop both bombs ten minutes apart but the weather had been unseasonably wet and limited the fires to an area of just 75 feet and took only a few hours to extinguish.|`|0RvtrkYOaa	Japan actually did attack the US.  They also invaded Attu and Kiska islands in Alaska.<br>  <br>  However the reason is actually quite simple.  To attack the US mainland required ships.  U-boats would have been poor ships to use in any attack unless it's against shipping.  Their deck guns are too small for an adequate bombardment.  Any invasion of the US was really out of the question, if Germany couldn't attack Britain, how could they have managed an attack against the US.  Distance was the greatest asset to the US and it's allies, creating an unhittable manufacturing base.|`|AA11304025	I don't think Hawaii became an American state until after WW2..<br>  America was too far away for the Germans to attack and the British  were in the way|`|1zfwLsQpaa	well the germans were busy fighting off the british and the soviets and until the japanese came along the Americans and the Germans still had tense, but 'friendly' relations.

1zfwLsQpaa	The North would be the United States of America, the south would shamefully continue slavery well into this very day (they might have under pressure have abolished it but slavery was very important for their industry).<br>  <br>  Ok First the two world wars would happen as they were caused by political turmoil in Europe and the Pacific, However I doubt that the United States or the Confederate States would get involved, probably only the United States but it wouldn't be a world Power. It would be a force to be reckoned with but around world war II nowhere as strong as Germany or Russia.<br>  <br>  The Confederacy and the USA would probably have a tense relations comparable to that of N. Korea and S. Korea. It is possible that in political scenarios that have never happened that the rivalry has led to other wars between the two. <br>  <br>  The Stock Market would crash and I take back what I said earlier, the USA would be a world power but not as strong as today. <br>  <br>  Adolf Hitler would be equally influential and it is possible that the Confederate States would have joined the Axis Powers bringing a North America battlefield (Between Axis Confederates and Allied Union). It would make the war tougher for the United States and it might have changed the course of the war. It is impossible to tell how strong the confederacy would be, but if they were strong enough they could wipe the USA of the map. It could lead to Japan defeating the USA who was fighting a three way war. The vital USA aid in the European war would never get there and Germany would crush the English and as their power grew they would invade the Soviet Union, China, and (yeah backstabbers) Japan. The only opposition being a weakened USA they would invade the Americas, crushing the USA and again back stabbing the Confederacy. Then the rest of the world would have no chance.<br>  <br>  Indirectly, a confederate victory could have in my scenario:<br>  1. Destroy both sides<br>  2. Enslave Blacks<br>  3. Annihalate the Jews<br>  4. Make Hitler a war hero and right|`|DIlNnjf8aa	Personally, I think we'd all be sprechen sie Deutsch and delivering "sieg heils", because a divided US would have lost WWII.<br>  <br>  But here's a long list of almost a thousand google entries on the subject, pick your favorite.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=%22if+the+confederacy+had+won%22" rel="nofollow">http://www.google.com/search?q=%22if+the...</a>
FLAtdWrmaa	Re: the hair:  it looks like you're treating hair only as individual hairs, and drawing it that way.  Maybe try an approach blocking out shapes and whole strands of hair as "solid" objects, filling in the shading next, and finishing with individual hairs as final details?  Maybe you could force your eye a bit, experimenting with drawing hairstyles that are very "sculpted:" put your daughter's hair in a bun and draw that, or try drawing a guy with stand-up spiked hair, or a woman with a chignon or a beehive.<br>  <br>  You also have a problem (but much less of one) with your subjects' eyes -- I'm not sure exactly what, but eyes are really, really hard to get right.  I see what you mean about not quite getting the expressions right, but I'm not good enough at them myself to help you much.  And at least your portraits *have* readable expressions -- well done!<br>  <br>  There is an old artists' trick you might try, though it doesn't work for everyone.  Get a large piece of dull-colored cardboard, and cut a small rectangular hole in the center, just a bit larger that one eye (with eyebrow, of course).  Prop it up vertically, and have your subject(s) sit behind it, close enough for only one eye to be in your view, and lit well.  Draw that.  Over and over.  Switch their eyes from time to time.<br>  <br>  When you feel confident with the looks you're capturing in these drawings, get another cardboard and cut a rectangular hole that lets you see both eyes (but still only eyes & eyebrows).  Keep drawing over and over -- but now you can experiment with a wider range of subjects' expressions.<br>  <br>  All I can suggest for handling either of your difficulties is to practice, practice, practice those elements.  You do keep a sketchbook that's just for practice and experiments, don't you?<br>  <br>  And I have to say, your tones and shading are faaaantastic!  That alone shows what a good eye you have.  I'm so jealous!|`|afc818594423abb198b9222afe9865c9aa	Your definitely better than artists i know that have taken classes. Practice will get you to where you need to be and studying books on drawing techniques will help you get there faster. Try your local library or book store for a good book/s. Being critical helps by pointing out to yourself those areas you know you are weak at and will help push you to do better. Try not to be over critical of your efforts. If you are this good and have only been at it a month, you are on the right track.|`|oHO0XOQVaa	To do hair realistically you have to do it section by section. When you're drawing, just lightly sketch everything out and then add in the shading then touch up with details. (Erase shine into it, put eyelashes with a mechanical pencil etc)<br>  <br>  See how they sectioned out the hair ( <a href="http://fc84.deviantart.com/fs25/f/2008/078/f/e/work_in_progress___gif_by_cyanidetictac.gif" rel="nofollow">http://fc84.deviantart.com/fs25/f/2008/0...</a> )<br>  <br>  When you're doing portraits never become impatient and try to wrap it up. You have to draw everything as carefully and accurately as you can no matter how long it takes. The finished product in cases like this is equivalent to the time/effort you put in.|`|SiPGcBnYaa	oooh very good so far!<br>  yes the hair could be more realistic. adding more highlights by erasing could help too. i switched to charcoal and use white pastel for my highlights, which is a little harder but makes the face smoother and more realistic. charcoal also lets you shade darker and is easier to blend if you use a Q-tip. Whatever works for you...keep practicing!<br>  <br>  EDIT: for the hair i shade first and then add the strands and highlights.|`|d9d7dbffacb9c5256ef7afd69e6023b6aa	Perfection is in the details.<br>  <br>  Some of your features (eyes) are a little too big or too vivid for the rest of the face<br>  <br>  The hair looks like generic 'Anime hair'. Long, light strokes will go a long way to add realism. Dark hair gets a few light highlights, light hair gets a few dark ones.<br>  <br>  The shading on Ava's nose makes it look bent. The edges of shadows can emphasize or de-emphasize shapes. A straight edge down the center of her nose, and a convex or straight one on her cheek would keep it from looking curved to one side.|`|1D5xCOHDaa	Woah!! Great drawings! Yeahh I think the hair needs a little work but but ither than that....they're beautiful.<br>  Good Luck.|`|amcqJkWhaa	I thought this tutorial for rendering hair could be useful for you: <br>  <a href="http://isaiahs.deviantart.com/art/Hair-Drawing-Tutorial-104449054" rel="nofollow">http://isaiahs.deviantart.com/art/Hair-D...</a><br>  <br>  I think your drawing of the first girl with the blonde hair... I think you could fix the direction her eyes are looking at, so her eyes are looking more at you than off somewhere else. Also, I don't know if this is said in the tutorial I linked, but focus on the overall shape of the hair than the strands. Even if there are small strands poking out everywhere, get the big shape of the hair, and you can add the small strands later. But you need to get the basic and essential forms down to make your portrait convincing... details only make it more so, but without a good foundation and hierarchy of shapes, then no amount of detail and polish can cover up mishaps. <br>  Don't be afraid to do multiple sketches. It's the journey that counts, not the end result. Enjoy playing around with things. <br>  <br>  Oh yeah, with the eyes, shade them. Shade the whites. When you look at people's eyes in real life, they're never really pure white. There's some gray shading, or in other cases, yellow tints going on. <br>  <br>  Look, here's Tom Cruise: <br>  <a href="http://www.marcofolio.net/images/stories/art/photoshop/alienize/src/tom_cruise.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://www.marcofolio.net/images/stories...</a><br>  <br>  And here's Tom Cruise with White Eyes: <br>  <a href="http://img23.imageshack.us/img23/5401/tomcruise.png" rel="nofollow">http://img23.imageshack.us/img23/5401/to...</a><br>  <br>  It doesn't look natural or a part of the whole... So with this comparison, you can see some grays and pinks in his eyes, even though predominately they register as 'white'... <br>  <br>  Yes, in regards to "am I being too critical of myself", it would feel better if you applauded what progress you made, and be proud of yourself.|`|2ik6h1cHaa	If you'd like to make your portraits more con vicing you can always do the grid method first than continue onto free hand drawings. Some of your proportions looks a little off. Some of your lines are dark and blunt when they would look more natural and soft if you just used shading. <br>  <br>  I like to use a variety of different grades of graphite pencils. You get different tones and shades just from using a 2B, H, and H2. <br>  <br>  Other than that, they look very successful. The hair doesn't bother me at all either, it's really up to your own personal artistic style.|`|QAHl7jYNaa	they are very good <br>  :]<br>  <br>  i think the best way to draw hair is to just draw a whole bunch of strands <br>  you have to draw it the way it grows and dont shade<br>  if it is darker draw more lines<br>  =D<br>  lighter less lines <br>  <br>  its as simple as that<br>  <br>   <br>  i drew this self portrait and got a 100! yay!!!<br>  <a href="http://i412.photobucket.com/albums/pp209/ix3billkaulitz/PICT0101.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://i412.photobucket.com/albums/pp209...</a><br>  <br>  lol<br>  <br>  i think you have to practice on the shape of the eye a little more but your drawings are amazing =]|`|AexbOuQWaa	I agree that the hair is not a problem.  I think they are all great.  To my eye, though, I think more shading in the mouth area to add depth may be more realistic. I also feel that if you get too realistic, you lose some of the artistic feel. I like the quirkiness of drawings that aren't photo realistic. I love them all.|`|kTa9WV1maa	i think it just the hair that needs work.<br>  but other than that its friggin awesome! <br>  the shading is really good|`|8OHsqwo6aa	i think the only problem you have is that like most people you draw what you know is there not just what you see.  the shadows of a face<br>  are just as important as the light, but in your drawings the shadows have been very down played.  in ava's picture the shadow on the left side of her head is almost non existent  the eye, nose, and mouth would have more definition if the shadow was true to the photo<br>  also the face has specific proportions base on the length of the nose.<br>  from the bottom of the bridge to the tip of the nose is the foundation for all the body's measurements.  the forehead from the top of bridge to the hairline is the same length as well as the length of the eye and the space between the eyes.  the head is 4X the length of the nose.  the corners of the mouth are directly under the center of the eyes.  the body is 7X the length of the head. if you hold your arms straight horizontally from the tip of the middle finger to the tip of the other middle finger is the same length as the body with the chest area being 2X the length of the head.

To give a specific example, I practice martial arts, and have heard that the purpose is to train towards attaining so much skill that you forget everything you have learned.  The ultimate goal is to not see the skills and techniques you have learned as something that you do, but rather, something that you are. <br>  <br>  In essence, how to move your body when you punch should not be a conscious decision, but rather a natural movement that occurs without thought, like breathing.  When you forget what you've learned you become stronger, and gives you a better understanding of the true meaning behind what you have achieved. <br>  <br>  Sometimes we have to think and feel less and simply let certain situations be in order for life to make sense.|`|JPlVt9xYaa	Of course.

Yes there was the stolen generation, but the white-man had well and truly destroyed Aboriginal culture & society well before that became a widespread practice.<br>  <br>  It was important because no past g'ment has ever issued any sort of an apology to the Aboriginal people - the closest was a "personal" apology from the past Prime Minister John Howard, that simply showed how out of touch with the issues he was, and bordered on racism/patron-ism.  And  it was during election campaigning.<br>  <br>  To me it showed that for the first time a white government, did care about the indigenous peoples of Australian.  I saw the apology as also saying that not only white people were Australians, we are lived together, and we needed to move forward together.  I also took, though that the government planned to do something about the severe inequality suffered by the Aboriginal people.<br>  One year on not a lot appears to have changed.  Yes it is hard to tell much after only 1 year, but it appears as if the apology was made and hoped that would solve everything and not a great deal practical has been carried out.  <br>  <br>  Actions speak louder than words.|`|d83d9da8709343b3aaed98bd340e3ba5aa	There is always the first step .The apology is a start of a long journey.|`|8WqTvPBbaa	Very what they did to them was terrible

PTdy6TWRaa	Yes still shoot black and white and process and print but not so much in color anymore. I love digital but there is a quality to black and white silver prints that can't be replicated without a darkroom. Also, when shooting film and darkroom printing each image is a more unique and original piece of art. I might only make a few "perfect" prints of a shot in the darkroom but could make an unlimited number digitally. The fact that the film prints done by hand are more limited can give them higher artistic appeal and may be percieved by buyers as more collectible.|`|TbTO5SXlaa	Yes I have. Every time I pick up one of my Minolta 35mm cameras. <br>  <br>  100% dedicated to using film. Can't wait until Spring arrives so I can start shooting Ektar.

The really good ones that take the clear, crisp pictures that are comparable to my 35 mill. are way too expensive for me to even look at...so I am stuck with a junky, pixillated piece of junk.  <br>  <br>  The only benefit of digital cameras for me is that I no longer have to set aside money to get pictures developed.  But...the pictures I get on the digital are so horrid I can't display them anyway...so...|`|31420ed41c716cbb02addca8d450fc2eaa	personally, I don't want a lot of people to discover film.

My first camera, other than the family Kodak Brownie, was my father's 126 German Exacta fully manual SLR.  That camera, and a hand-held light meter was my introduction to the bewilderment and wonders of photography.<br>  <br>  From there, I moved directly to 2 1/4 cameras and doing my own darkroom work.  I've still got boxes of poorly exposed negatives and stacks of prints, both memorable and forgettable.<br>  <br>  After that I moved from Minolta 35mm SLR's to the Nikons that line my shelves today.  <br>  <br>  Since I went digital a few years ago (due to the requirements of my clients) I've never looked back.  To be honest, there are cameras on my shelves that still have 35mm film loaded in them!<br>  <br>  Would I go back?  Yes, but only when I'd have the time and patience to really master what film can do.<br>  <br>  Until then, digital means immediate (almost) gratification and another world to explore.  With the computer, post-processing programs, and the experience I've gained over the years, I'm just beginning to discover what the new media can do.|`|24a35b004c9e3574a00e5bc75cc210d8aa	I still continue to only use film to this day. I agree that black and white film has a quality that digital still does not have.

II5N7XYKaa	Because by the time the Armed Forces are called to action, the point of negotiation has passed.

egLjl6AUaa	Look online! My VERY favorite acting site is <a href="http://www.abwag.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.abwag.com/</a> . It has tons of information, links, and motivational ideas about acting. It is truly amazing. Find a class, join a play (Still in school? There should be opportunities there.), or join an acting group. <br>  <br>  Break a leg!|`|NjYCvfYGaa	You just decided?<br>  Think about it a little bit more. It took  me a year before I realized acting was what I wanted to do with my life.<br>  It's heartbreaking and cruel. If have any other careers in mind I suggest you go for that because you'd be 10000 times more successful in that job. So when you've really thought about it, assuming you are a teenager? Ask your parents, talk to them about it because legally you have no rights to sign anything at all. Look into local acting schools, join drama at school, take in as much training and experience as possible. Don't overwhelm yourself though, that's how you end up giving up. Once you get your training your acting coach will lead you on from there,<br>  <br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|xnDcmV1xaa	Well, I live in a small town, so I'm not exactly sure what kind of opportunities would be available in New York lol :) but I will try to help!<br>  <br>  It all depends on if you want to be professional (famous), major in it, do it just for fun, etc.<br>  <br>  I act as a hobby, and I started out in a community play. Try out something like that first, or if you go to school, see if it offers Drama as an elective or club. <br>  <br>  If you end up loving it, and you are good at it (or even if you're not), you can take acting lessons. Even the best actors need help on things like cueing, expressions, and other things like that. Some modeling agencies offer acting courses as well.<br>  <br>  Other than this, I'm not really sure what else to be honest.<br>  You can also watch movies, and while you are watching, think about things that the actor/actress does.<br>  <br>  Good luck! :)|`|MHFuJGdGaa	In regards to some of the answers:  There is so much more to acting than "cues" and "lines."  Please do yourself a favor and read some books on the subject, I promise you will become a much more knowledgeable person.<br>  <br>  Consider this:  If I were to be a surgeon, would you expect me to practice medicine straight out of high school?  No.  In fact I wouldn't be allowed to practice medicine until I finished my collegiate studies and many years on internship.  I firmly uphold that this should also be a rule for actors.  If you are interested in acting audition for a community theatre production.  If you like the feeling, do some research as far as acting schools go.  You can look into studying abroad (such as in New York, where schools are generally the most successful) or locally (possibly at a local university).  Keep in mind that everything you did in that community theatre will be wrong.  Professional and amateur acting are separated by a highly developed technique which the actor gains after years of training.  There is so much more to acting than just memorizing lines.  <br>  <br>  In summary: study, and study hard.  If you find yourself not willing to commit to such a task, accept that professional acting is not for you, and continue to involve yourself in community theatre.  Keep in mind that there is nothing wrong with being an amateur: amateur does not mean untalented, it literally means "for the love."  So by all means, if you find any reason not to commit years of your life, countless exercises which push you emotionally and physically to the limit, and thousands of dollars, to acting then find something else.

4wkIOVDoaa	Do you want to play electric guitar or acoustic? I would start out with buying an acoustic get a Yamaha. They have cheaper but good beginner guitars under two hundred bucks. Then learn how to play chords. You don't have to learn to read music notes if you don't want to. Instead of that most of us use TAB or tablature. It's really easy to learn. The lines indicate the strings. Google it. The numbers indicate the fret. You'll only need to learn tab if ur going to play lead guitar stuff. <br>  <br>  If you just want to learn covers start with easy stuff. Learn all the major and minor chords on the first three frets. I would get a guitar teacher to show you some stuff once a week for 45 mins. Then practice for about 30 or 60 minues per day.|`|4xOXiZcNaa	I get so sick and tired of seeing this same stupid question asked OVER AND OVER AND OVER AND OVER.. at LEAST 100 TIMES A WEEK because people are too stupid or lazy to LOOK IN THE ARCHIVES for Answers are READ THE LAST 10,000 ANSWERS for this same question.<br>  <br>  AND..

g7WJrfXLaa	The "world's last night" in Christianity is Judgment Day, probably. Hence the poet's concern with Christ's tongue that might "adjudge thee unto hell." The tension is between Christ's mercy and judgment for the speaker's sins, I would guess. Donne's speaker is weighing the possibility of forgiveness versus uncertainty/condemnation. Christ prayed for those who crucified him, and so the speaker thinks that Christ might have mercy.<br>  <br>  The speaker is either a philanderer or has turned to substitutes for his faith in other things, or both. That his profane mistresses are also beautiful casts some doubt on his later claim that a beautiful form dispenses pity<br>  <br>  If foulness is a sign of rigidity or inflexibility, then perhaps the crucified Christ would be inflexible toward the speaker (being bloodied and beaten beyond recognition), but because the image of Christ crucified is something beautiful for the Christian because of the salvation it represents, perhaps Christ will have pity. <br>  <br>  If you want the key to a sonnet, you can typically look at the last two lines and come up with an interpretation on the basis of them. They usually have the crux of the sonnet.<br>  <br>  So, look at Donne's reasoning in the poem, and whether his speaker seems convinced of the last declaration.|`|EZorC9S1aa	He imagines he is going to die and he does not know whether he will be saved or not.

You can chose from canvas or leather (between $40-$60), but I prefer canvas ones. If you're on en Pointe then you need to get a pair of pointe shoes, I started out w/ Capezios which are the best ($60-$100). To class you should wear a black leotard, you can ask your teacher if you can wear other colors. You also need ballet pink tights. Try bringing a water bottle and some leg-warmers (when you're stretching). Remember to tie your hair in a bun and put in a lot of clips (so there's no little wisps of hair) and put on some hair spary to hold it in place. As for class costs it's roughly about $80-$100/secession (there are about 4 lessons each lasting about 3-4 months)|`|loh35vJyaa	First of all it depends were u buy them I say shop around  check with some dance supply stores in your area & check on line to  one thing I point out make sure you get fitted first any dance supply can do it pick a day & time to go after beeing fitted dont wear them around & dont sew the ribbin on so that incase you may have to return them for some reason this is for your own good  as far lessons cost it depends on what classes you are takeing check with the school  first & one thing I want to point out if a school req  you to sign a contract dont walk a way the reason why I said that what if something came up you couldnt pay or what ever the case maybe  they can take some kind of action against you thats why I said NO contract,s Pay as you go the is best & safest way to go as far lessons go  youll need a leotard & tights & of corse shoes these you can buy at a dance supply store  No street wear  in class hair must be off the face & secured  regardless of level  & be on time for class  in fact you may want to get there early so that if you have to use  the restroom ect you wont enterupt the class|`|eoebXACraa	Soft Ballet shoes, canvas ones, for me, are usually around $20. If you are a beginner, you probably won't be, but if you are on Pointe, pointe shoes can cost anywhere from $60-$100. The best kinds of shoes I would recommend would be Russian Pointe, and they do not only sell pointe shoes. My ballet lessons are $85 dollars for a private lesson, and around $500 dollars for an hour of lessons a week, but I take 14 hours of class a week and 3 private lessons, so it might be more. And for what to wear, DEFINITELY DO NOT wear sweatpants and a shirt into a ballet studio. You should wear a pear of pink convertible ballet tights, which cost around $15, and a plain black leotard, which costs around $25 or $30 dollars, sometimes they can run up to $40 or $50. A black ballet skirt is optional, but don't wear anything colorful or distracting. Also, you should wear your hair off your face and pulled back into a tight ballet bun, which should hold up for however long your class is, and longer. Here are some tips on how to make one:<br>  Pull your hair into a ponytail<br>  Divide it into three parts<br>  Twist one of the parts of your hair and wrap it around your ponytail, putting in a lot of bobby pins along the way<br>  Do the same with the second part, and then the third<br>  Put a hairnet of your color hair around the bun, and bobby pin any extra hairs or pieces of hairnet sticking out and secure the hairnet and the bun to your head with bobby pins<br>  Pin back any loose hairs with either bobby pins or hairclips and hairspray back all the wispys to make your hair look smooth and neat<br>  To make it stand out add a pretty but small hairclip or a flower ponytail holder around the bun<br>  Hope this helps!|`|CrQMHKqWaa	Well it depends on what ype of ballet shoes you are buying and where you are getting them from. For lessons, it also depends on where you are going. How many times a week you are going to go and how many hours you aregoing for. What you need to wear is comfortable clothing. No jeans or anything tight. You should wear sweat pants and a comfortable t-shirt.

8asG4WCwaa	<a href="http://nathanbransford.blogspot.com/2007/02/what-makes-literary-fiction-literary.html" rel="nofollow">http://nathanbransford.blogspot.com/2007...</a><br>  <br>  If you're somewhat familiar with publishing terms, you should like this link about the difference between commercial and literary fiction.<br>  <br>  <br>  Commercial fiction, is of course intended for popular sale (to be enjoyed by the general public).  Not for scholars to analyze to death.  That's a definition I heard, and like.  Public library vs university library kind of thing :-)<br>  <br>  I've heard other definitions, like commercial fiction being the same as mainstream fiction, and which has no particular genre if fits neatly into.  I suppose that can be true. Certainly many book stores have a commercial section separate from the other genres.  <br>  <br>  I've heard that commercial fiction is plot and character driven, and literary fiction is about writing technique and self-discovery of the "human condition".  No plot necessary.  Sounds a lot like a class assigned diary in middle school.  Yuck.  Somehow I don't think literary level work is really that boring.<br>  <br>  I would venture my own opinion, that work defined as romance, sci-fi, mystery, fantasy, etc are subgenres of commercial/mainstream fiction, just like wheat, rye, raisin, and potato are all specific types of bread.  That would make the various types of crackers the equivalent of subgenres of nonfiction, so metamucil crackers are, what, a self-help book?|`|WshwHtk9aa	Any genre.<br>  <br>  There are two meanings.<br>  <br>  One, just means a novel for sale or one that achieves moderate success. For example, authors will refer to their "first commercial novel." It is usually the first novel that made them money or established them as a valid, sellable author. <br>  <br>  In the second meaning, commercial novels are those novels written to lowest common denominators in order to be successfully mass marketed or capitalize on current market trends (like other teenage vampire love stories coming out in the wake of Twilight).

6b2c780c41a3648dc5ae321eec588c0caa	I would guess that consensual means are probably responsible for the lion's share of human kind.  While people can get pregnant from rape the biological conditions involved make it less conducive to fertilization.  The female orgasm and moisture actually helps sperm along their way!<br>  <br>  In all of the societies I've known rape is a big taboo, you just don't do it unless there are slaves or war involved.  Even then it wasn't exactly something to brag about.  <br>  <br>  Of course, if you expand the definition to include consensual sex inside of unhappy marriages, prostitution,  etc you could make a bit of a case for it but I really don't think so. <br>  <br>  They say that 2 in 3 women receive some sort of sexual harassment or assault in their lifetime so it is possible that there is rape in almost every family history but whether or not children resulted is another question.|`|872d5e7c115978540052b672e4c757e4aa	I doubt it.  Surely an unfortunately sizeable amount of pregnancies occur because of rape, but I'm certain that those cases do not make up the majority of pregnancies.|`|nn0bYqXpaa	Its very possible, we live in a society were a woman is raped every 2 mins about 72 per 100,000 according to the US department of Justice stats.  Imagine how many live births would result from these attacks if birth control was not prevelant even considering other factors involved.  Rape victims in any society are generally young and extremely fertile ( fertility rates decline by 1/2 after age 27) further increasing the odds of pregnancy.  <br>  72 per hundred thousand in a free modern relatively educated and wealthy society with liberal sexual views and readily available sexual partners who have virtually no stigma attached....<br>  How many multiples are attached to factors which breed rape; such as war, eslavement, poverty, disenfranchisment, or societal taboos that once lead men to think of women as automatically 'ruined' if left alone in the same vicinity as a male non-relation and so relegated to a class of womanhood that was ripe for sexual exploitation?<br>  I don't know the math, but I can guess.<br>  There is a mutation on the Y chromosome found on 1/4 of male population accross the Eurasian landmass from Northern China to Turkey and throughout the Russian steppes which only appeared in the mid 12th century and is attributed to Ghengis Khan by genetic scientists....<br>  I would say the likelihood of any person alive having been begat of a continuous line of consensual sex is not very.

(5) In his second letter, he defined her in terms which anticipate his concept of the self-expressive "subjective poet" in the 1852 "Essay on Shelley," whereas he described himself as an inferior, dramatic "objective poet" eager to emulate her example: <br>  <br>  For you do what I always wanted, hoped to do, and only seem now likely to do for the first time-you speak out, you,--I only make men & women speak,-give you truth broken into prismatic hues, and fear the pure white light, even if it is in me: but I am going to try.

dpuY0jWiaa	Hi Monica,<br>    Your imagery is at its best when it involves the physical senses rather than abstract and when you allow your poem to be somewhat mysterious and implied, rather than when you try to directly explain it to the reader. <br>  Your quatrains and final couplet are well-rhymed and you have achieved some rhythm in your verse. <br>  For your age your choice of words is admirable, and you have lots to say!<br>  Overall you've done well, and I'd encourage you to include it in your project. <br>  -P.|`|VrBZovBMaa	It's great, but, as I'm sure others will notice, you seem to stick to the rhyming theme.

Glad helpin' ya! Good poem(:|`|CSi3N0HJaa	it's a pretty good poem, i would say that your strength is word choice, on a critical note the subject matter of the poem is deep and dark while the way it is written is playful and juvenile- you spell everything out- your not writing in prose or suggesting anything, your telling a story. and the fact that it rhymes diminishes the seriousness. " those three words said it all is again, a sort of juvenile way to end the poem- it sort of ties everything up- you want to leave the reader hanging (at least a little bit)  But like I said, overall it's a pretty good poem.|`|Eg4RsOPgaa	Amazing. I am a high school english teacher and half of my students cannot even write like this. You have a very wide use of vocabulary for a  twelve year old.

dQdYUFVBaa	Youth these days can be so bloody obnoxious and thoughtless. Being a young one myself, I hang around people like that all the time.<br>  <br>  Schools should reinforce these ideas of caring for the elder. I'm sure they already do; but they should do more. <br>  <br>  But the root of the problem lies within the youth themselves. If they truly lack the compassion/generosity in their heart, no amount of pressure would change anything. They can giveup seats just to look good, but secretly feel annoyed about it. No good<br>  <br>  So yeh, allow schools to emphasise on the point, or let the bus drivers order youths to get off seats when elderlies come on with no seats. If worse comes to worse and the youth throws a stink about it, kick them off the bus. 'Bout time some of them learn to respect others.|`|ftCkbc0iaa	YES

1hvrQYWiaa	Although the Reichstag in pre WW1 Germany had no real power, regular elections were held. The left of centre Social Democrats always got the most votes and had the most deputies; this was also true throughout WW1.<br>   When Hindenburg and Ludendorf realized the war was lost, they advised the Kaiser to abdicate and hand power over to a civilian government (which he did). As the largest party, the Social Democrats therefore formed the first German civilian government.<br>   The Allies were happy enough with this post WW1 - the Social Democrats were committed to democracy as a form of government and, until the Nazis came along, remained the majority party in Reichstag elections.

That is an interesting question I would ask a student if I were a teacher looking at this. You had only read half of the book and you hated her that much? What provoked such emotion? Was it the author's doing or did you relate to it on a more personal level? Could you identify with a character similar to Umbridge in your everyday life?

Since the Hellenistic period, the whole known world including the Romans had to know Greek.  So when the Christians happened to organize their religion, they did it in the common language of the time, which was called "Koine" (= common) and which was Greek.  So when adopting the language, they also adopted concepts especially for organization or for expression.  It is a very vast subject.  Then all this got to be translated in Latin, sometimes with some differences which equaled big mistakes, which is why the Roman Catholics are separated from the Greek Church, which calls itself "orthodox" because they had the "orthos" (= correct) texts, and did not need translations.  It was indeed a very powerful influence.|`|sdeUhMELaa	The first thing that comes to my mind is the use of the Koine Greek language. It was used in all throughout the Mediterranean during the time that the New Testament was written. So then the creation of the Greek New Testament. With the introduction of Greek through the means of the bible, many Western languages have Greek roots in their vocabulary.<br>  <br>  The Greeks are also mentioned several times in the New Testament. <br>  <br>  The Greeks also gave us their gods that the west adopted and named many things after them. Months, days of the week, planets, stars, moons, etc, are all examples of things that the west has named after these gods.
e8f3790b2030170b8a04b70d4523788daa	Nope, Mr. Nabokov did that on purpose. <br>  As Wikipedia says, "Humbert Humbert's first love, Annabel Leigh, is named after the woman in the poem "Annabel Lee" by Edgar Allan Poe. In fact, their young love is described in phrases borrowed from Poe's poem. Nabokov originally intended Lolita to be called The Kingdom by the Sea, drawing on the rhyme with Annabel Lee that was used in the first verse of Poe's work. The part of the beginning of chapter one — "Ladies and gentlemen of the jury, exhibit number one is what the seraphs, the misinformed, simple, noble-winged seraphs, envied. Look at this tangle of thorns" — is also a reference to the poem. ("With a love that the winged seraphs in heaven / Coveted her and me".)"|`|ffS4fTZ0aa	edgar alan poes cousin was this "Anna belle leigh" He married her eventually thats creepy|`|dNGqKZQQaa	OMG I love Lolita xD
miFe45quaa	It's nice. I'd do a bit tweaking though.<br>  <br>  1.) You used the word "faded" twice. I would try another word, like blurred, vanished, dimmed, or disappear. <br>  <br>  2.) "Like a book whose words have faded, Like shoes that lost their shine" <br>  I would turn the simile into a metaphor. In my opinion, it gives more of a poetic feeling. So it would be:<br>  "A book whose words have faded,  Shoes that lost their shine"<br>  <br>  3.) The third stanza, has a lot of repetition. Try:<br>  "Where is the laughter, happiness<br>  Determination and strength?<br>  They used to flow through my veins<br>  But now they have vanished"<br>  <br>  4.) Lastly, I would get rid of "I don't think" in the fourth stanza. <br>  Instead:<br>  "I've changed and<br>  I'm not coming back"<br>  <br>  REVISED POEM<br>  A ghost of myself<br>  I have become<br>  A version we all can't recognize<br>  A disappearing picture of the old me<br>  <br>  A book whose words have faded<br>  Shoes that lost their shine<br>  I'm not myself anymore<br>  I don't think I'm coming back<br>  <br>  Where is the laughter, happiness<br>  Determination and strength?<br>  They used to flow through my veins<br>  But now they have vanished<br>  <br>  Heartbreak's the new happiness<br>  Tears are the new laughter<br>  I've changed and<br>  I'm not coming back<br>  <br>  Hope this helps!|`|eqPFKpVqaa	That poem is really good, and it seem real.. not fake. <br>  you know?<br>  <br>  Great job, keep up the good work hunn!

I like the second stanza when you use the metaphors comparing this person to faded words and shineless shoes. The only thing I could find was that you used the line "i don't think i'm coming back" twice. was that on purpose? cuz if not than perhaps you could change one of them to something like "Forever lost in my deep abyss". which is saying the same thing just with fancier language =)<br>  i really like your poem. keep writing!<br>         ?--poet360.|`|c2010f5458603aa595d704b221ae83c3aa	Seems a normal part of life...we age and die.

I could smell her across the field.<br>  Alice Cullen, Twilight, Chapter 17, p.373<br>  <br>  It’s been almost a century that Edward’s been alone. Now he’s found you. You can’t see the changes that we see, we who have been with him for so long. Do you think any of us want to look into his eyes for the next hundred years if he loses you?<br>  Alice Cullen, Twilight, Chapter 20, p.410<br>  <br>  Bella, how many times do we have to tell you that there’s no danger to us?<br>  Alice Cullen, Twilight, Chapter 20, p.412<br>  <br>  I will always tell you the truth.<br>  Alice Cullen, Twilight, Chapter 20, p.412<br>  <br>  As predators, we have a glut of weapons in our physical arsenal — much, much more than really necessary. The strength, the speed, the acute senses, not to mention those of us like Edward, Jasper, and I, who have extra senses as well. And then, like a carnivorous flower, we are physically attractive to our prey.<br>  Alice Cullen, Twilight, Chapter 20, p.413<br>  <br>  It’s difficult on both sides — the blood-lust on the one hand, the awful pain on the other.<br>  Alice Cullen, Twilight, Chapter 20, p.414<br>  <br>  For everyone else, the pain of transformation is the sharpest memory they have of their human life. I remember nothing of being human.<br>  Alice Cullen, Twilight, Chapter 20, p.414<br>  <br>  Some things are more certain than others… like the weather. People are harder. I only see the course they’re on while they’re on it. Once they change their minds — make a new decision, no matter how small — the whole future shifts.<br>  Alice Cullen, Twilight, Chapter 22, p.435<br>  <br>  Leave it to you, Bella. Anyone else would be better off when the vampires left town. But you have to start hanging out with the first monsters you can find.<br>  Alice Cullen, New Moon, Chapter 17, p.387<br>  <br>  I don’t care whose idea it was. How could you do this to me? I expect that kind of thing from Edward, but not from you. I love you like you were my own sister.<br>  Alice Cullen, Eclipse, Chapter 21, p.465<br>  <br>  You are safe inside your mind. No one can reach you there. It’s no wonder that Aro was so curious about your future abilities.<br>  Alice Cullen, Eclipse, Chapter 26, p.584<br>  <br>  I’m sorry. I can’t really empathize. My first memory is of seeing Jasper’s face in my future; I always knew that he was where my life was headed. But I can sympathize.

I’m not going to be chewed out again.<br>  Alice Cullen, Breaking Dawn, Chapter 20, p.402<br>  <br>  Her fashion sense hasn’t improved as much as her balance.<br>  Alice Cullen, Breaking Dawn, Chapter 21, p.409<br>  <br>  Oh, give her some credit. She wasn’t going to do anything. You’d want a closer look, too.<br>  Alice Cullen, Breaking Dawn, Chapter 22, p.439<br>  <br>  You will do the right thing. She’s Charlie Swan’s only family. It would kill him, too.<br>  Alice Cullen, Midnight Sun, Chapter 1, p.28<br>  <br>  <br>  JASPER-<br>  I can feel what you’re feeling now — and you are worth it.<br>  Jasper Hale, Twilight, Chapter 19, p.404<br>  <br>  You’re worrying about all the wrong things, Bella. Trust me on this — none of us are in jeopardy. You are under too much strain as it is; don’t add to it with wholly unnecessary worries. Listen to me! Our family is strong. Our only fear is losing you.<br>  Jasper Hale, Twilight, Chapter 20, p.410<br>  <br>  Before I tell you my story, you must understand that there are places in our world, Bella, where the life span of the never-aging is measured in weeks, and not centuries.<br>  Jasper Hale, Eclipse, Chapter 13, p.287<br>  <br>  You held out your hand, and I took it without stopping to make sense of what I was doing. For the first time in almost a century, I felt hope.<br>  Jasper Hale, Eclipse, Chapter 13, p.301<br>  <br>  I’ve never seen a newborn do that – stop an emotion in its tracks that way. You were upset, but when you saw our concern, you reined it in, regained power over yourself. I was prepared to help, but you didn’t need it.<br>  Jasper Hale, Breaking Dawn, Chapter 20, p.404<br>  <br>  It’s just been my experience that some kinds of working relationships are better motivated by fear than by monetary gain.<br>  Jasper Hale, Breaking Dawn, Chapter 39, p.749|`|cxip3nA8aa	Alice says a lot of things.<br>  <br>  PS.

XOZ475oQaa	If you really want to improve go to your band director and ask him what he's looking for in a 1st or 2nd trumpet. As to make your sound good make sure you have good air quality---smooth air throughout playing. If you're air isn't constant (or if you are good enough to fake it) your sound isn't going to be as good and neither is you're tone quality. To practice with smooth air try doing lip slurs to different pitches such as concert F to a concert Bb. <br>  <br>  Im telling you what my band director has told the trumpets in my band (Hint: I'm not a trumpet player but i listen to everything he says because some of it can relate to alto saxes as well, what i play!)|`|35GfsJ3Paa	1. Scales - majors and minors. Work with a metronome. Make sure to play very evenly. Practice with several types of articulation. Aim for quarter note = 120, while playing scales in sixteenth notes.<br>  <br>  2. Tuning - especially in the high registers. Work with a tuner. Also, grab a friend and tune in octaves (he/she plays a low C, you play an octave higher. Make sure you're both in tune, then move on to D, etc.) Do this same exercise in thirds.<br>  <br>  3. Rhythm - get either the Kazez Rhythm Reading book or a similar book. Tap your foot and clap the rhythm. Then play it on your trumpet. You can even try conducting which saying the rhythm.<br>  <br>  4. Practice lip slurs and always warm up properly.<br>  <br>  5. Sight reading - practice this daily. Pick up any type of music (doesn't have to be for trumpet). Put on the metronome at a speed you think you can do and read it down.<br>  <br>  6. Good for you for taking lessons! Aim for at least and hour of practice every day.<br>  <br>  7. Listen to a lot of good music - trumpet players, obviously, but also orchestra/brass choir/chamber music/wind band music. Look for Dallas Brass, Eastman Wind Ensemble, American Wind Symphony Orchestra recordings as well.<br>  <br>  8. Get over your obsession with what part you have and get over your indignation at others abilities/lack thereof. Seriously, music is about cooperation and playing TOGETHER.

Ow3O7h4caa	The valvestate amp does indeed produce 150Watts of power and i had to purchase an extension cabinet to handle the amp's full drive.  This is a good amp.<br>   It sounds ok, but isn't nearly as good as other effects units I've used. Overdrive 1 is a far more harsh distortion with not alot of body and power behind it. It's a great bluesy/backing guitar sound but nothing more. Overdrive 2 however, is a good attempt at a violent Nu-Metal-esque power punch! Whack the gain up all the way and it's very powerful indeed, although lacks that "controlled" massive distortion often produced by Mesa-Boogie .<br>  <br>  It's an expensive amp for the features, but there are a few and the amp's been well built! <br>  <br>  As for the MG series, 100 watts of Marshall power, a 12" Celestion speaker, a parallel effects, loop, CD input, Digital Effects, dedicated Digital Reverb and a 2-way LED footswitch for channel switching and DFX On/Off. <br>  It sounds like a solid state marshal. Not quite tube but clear and big.<br>  Overall, its got the real Marshall sound, almost tube-like but not tube-like.<br>  A Crate V Series will blow the MG out of the water in both tone and volume for less than half the price. But for the money, its not bad.<br>  <br>  End result, the valvestate has lots of power to spare. Definitely. The MG, if I would crank it like the valvestate , the sould gets muddy.<br>  Still, I personally prefer the MG for sound and the valvestate for power.|`|YhAdpBo9aa	Nope, I have an mg.

If nothing notable ever happened there, you probably will not find it mentioned.  The same may be true at the library.  If there are any abstract offices in your area, you may be able to find out some of your home's history through them, but I believe they charge for the service.  Those old abstracts can be quite interesting to read, if you can get one.|`|05bddf168eeb3e8ae67ab005844309abaa	Unless you live in a National Historical landmark (or the Australian equivalent), nobody would take the time and trouble to enter the data, so there isn't a web site.<br>  <br>  You will have a harder time that you expect at the library, too.<br>  <br>  This question gets asked once a week here, and the answer is always the same; nothing on-line, and hours of research at the library, which may be inconclusive.|`|65Rzxlv2aa	Go to the court house and ask to see the ABSTRACT for your property.. you won't find that information for FREE on the Internet.. you actually have to GO IN PERSON and LOOK IT UP.. and they MAY charge you for it.. some clerks do.
djA8ITCsaa	there is a series called the blue bloods that is very good|`|5oAU7S9zaa	Need by Carrie Jones-<br>  <br>   Zara collects phobias the way other high school girls collect lipsticks. Little wonder, since life’s been pretty rough so far. Her father left, her stepfather just died, and her mother’s pretty much checked out. Now Zara’s living with her grandmother in sleepy, cold Maine so that she stays “safe.” Zara doesn’t think she’s in danger; she thinks her mother can’t deal.  Wrong. Turns out that guy she sees everywhere, the one leaving trails of gold glitter, isn’t a figment of her imagination. He’s a pixie—and not the cute, lovable kind with wings. He’s the kind who has dreadful, uncontrollable needs. And he’s trailing Zara<br>   <br>  Evermore by Alyson Noel-<br>  <br>  Since a horrible accident claimed the lives of her family, sixteen-year-old Ever can see auras, hear people’s thoughts, and know a person’s life story by touch. Going out of her way to shield herself from human contact to suppress her abilities has branded her as a freak at her new high school—but everything changes when she meets Damen Auguste…<br>  <br>  Ever sees Damen and feels an instant recognition. He is gorgeous, exotic and wealthy, and he holds many secrets. Damen is able to make things appear and disappear, he always seems to know what she’s thinking—and he’s the only one who can silence the noise and the random energy in her head. She doesn’t know who he really is—or what he is. Damen equal parts light and darkness, and he belongs to an enchanted new world where no one ever dies.<br>  <br>  Vampire Diaries by : L.J Smith********<br>  Elena: the golden girl, the leader, the one who can have any boy she wants. <br>  Stefan: brooding and mysterious, he seems to be the only one who can resist Elena, even as he struggles to protect her from the horrors that haunt his past. <br>  Damon: sexy, dangerous, and driven by an urge for revenge against Stefan, the brother who betrayed him. Determined to have Elena, he'd kill to possess her. <br>  <br>  Vampire Academy by Richelle Mead<br>  After two years on the run, best friends Rose, half-human/half-vampire, and Lissa, a mortal vampire princess, are caught and returned to St. Vladimir's Academy. Up until then, Rose had kept Lissa safe from her enemies; school, however, brings both girls additional challenges and responsibilities. How they handle peer pressure, nasty gossip, new relationships, and anonymous threats may mean life or death. Likable narrator Rose hides doubts about her friend behind a tough exterior; orphan Lissa, while coping with difficult emotional issues such as depression and survivor's guilt, uses her emerging gifts for good. <br>  <br>  Mediator Series by Meg Cabot*********<br>  Susannah Simon is 16 years old, a lonely New York City girl who has to move from her beloved East Coast to live with her mother and new step-family in Carmel, California. Traumatic enough for any teenager, this adjustment to a new family and environment is complicated even more by Susannah's natural gift for talking to the dead. Susannah is a mediator, a contact point for the dead who can't (or won't) make it to the other side. The family home is a beautiful old house harbouring its own resident unsettled spirit, which has set up residence in Susannah's bedroom. There is also the small matter of the angry ghost haunting the locker room in her new school, desperate for revenge on an ex-boyfriend, not to mention the discovery that her school principal, Father Dominic, is also a mediator. <br>  <br>  The Luxe by Anna Godbersen<br>  A big, sumptuous tale of catty girls, dark secrets and windswept romance unfurls in this compulsively readable novel of late-19th-century New York City socialites.

Jeb, a sympathetic scientist, helped them escape and, since then, they've been living on their own. The Erasers have orders to kill them so the world will never find out they exist. Max's old childhood friend, Ari, now an Eraser leader, tracks them down, kidnaps Angel, and transports her back to the School to live like a lab rat again. The youngsters are forced to use their special talents to rescue her as they attempt to learn about their pasts and their destinies. <br>  <br>  Marked ( Book 1) House of Night series by P.C.

Her mark from the Goddess Nyx is a special one, showing that her powers are very strong for one so young.

But when a particularly violent ghost haunts her, she gets noticed for all the wrong reasons. Her seemingly crazed behaviour earns her a trip to Lyle House, a centre for 'disturbed teens'. At first Chloe is determined to keep her head down. But then her room mate disappears after confessing she has a poltergeist, and some of the other patients also seem to be manifesting paranormal behaviour. Could that be a coincidence? Or is Lyle House not quite what it seems...? Chloe realizes that if she doesn't uncover the truth, she could be destined for a lifetime in a psychiatric hospital. Or could her fate be even worse...?

58cde5f95f5cad4a921e506917478bc7aa	Time must be measured linearly as that is how we as 3 dimensional beings experience time (4th dimension).  We cannot observe it from out side itself and hence are caught in its motion.|`|mMnRmYvNaa	Yes, the Second Law of Thermodynamics says time flows in one direction only as a progression. The analog to a line is only partly accurate. A line is the shortest distance between two points. But time connects many points with many other points. It's more like a whole space full of points with a whole other space full of points. So if space is 3 dimensional, and time connects one space with another, maybe time would be a 4th dimension. <br>  <br>  This idea was proposed by Minkowski and then by Einstein. It is not false, but if true should be stated with the following qualification. The 3 spatial dimensions are physically and semantically different (not of the same sort) as the time dimension. In terms of mathematics, conecting two matrices, they are operatively similar, as Reimann and Courant have shown, but no self-respecting physicist would say that length, breadth, and height are of the same order as minutes days and weeks. Not the same stuff, you can see that rignt? The Euclidean dimensions and time are different in kind. <br>  <br>  They can, and must, be combined when we represent space/time in equations. So the movement from one space/time point to another space/time point is a movement through four dimensions, but only three Euclidean dimensions. That's why Einstein emphasized the Galilean transformation in the Special Theory of Relativity.<br>  <br>  Fiction novelists, no matter how talented, have no impact on time, it's linearity, or its progression (see also Catch-22)<br>  <br>  You like this kind of thing -- read Jorg Borges -- The Garden of the Forking Paths -- same idea as Slaughterhouse Five.|`|AA10729675	yes.  There is no other way.|`|vMthRkrsaa	No. it's really not linear.<br>     <br>  It's not "space / time" either which makes it a wave, up and down with a central line that can be drawn through it. But it's closer.  <br>  <br>  Then just add "speed" and "mass" <br>  <br>  Energy = Mass times the speed of light squared..<br>  <br>  Then add the fact its  not a "wave", but photons behaving in a wave-like fashion, with spaces between them<br>  <br>  There is your 4th dimension.<br>  <br>   5 is a cool book, but its fictional as far as facts are today|`|jDsoVZK9aa	You do realize, I hope, that that is a fictional story?<br>  <br>  You can measure time anyway you want.  <br>  <br>  Just be on time for supper, as the old saying goes.|`|PFncnta2aa	If you want things simple, yes.|`|AA10286634	yes, you cannot, unbreak an egg.

Maybe a nice pair of jeans with a casual shirt which looks like you've put a bit of effort into picking what to wear but not too much.<br>  DO NOT DRESS LIKE THE CHARACTER!! <br>  The director has his/her own view on what the character is going to look like, so instead of him/her trying to figure out what you're wearing, you want to show him/her your talent instead!<br>  Seriously, what you wear is not at all as important as your talent.

My career adviser says they can get paid up to and over $25/hour. <br>  <br>  Nowadays, you can EASILY blend 2D(I preferred medium) and 3D animation, and blend a great amount of special effects whether 2D,3D, or particles.<br>  <br>  For great info and/or references try:<br>  www.awn.com - Great source for animation jobs, schools, or general info.<br>  www.animationmeat.com - I get my storyboards here.|`|wYF6U6qlaa	They make pretty good money.  Salary depends on what type of animation you do (animation for films? for the internet? for training videos? television commercials?) how much experience you have, where you live and work, and just plain how good at it you are.  There are many different areas of animation. I'm sure if you stick with it, you'll find your place!|`|9byacd9Naa	Computer animation is combination of audio,graphics,text,image etc<br>   so, you can use Jasc Animation Shop 3 software which is dam good.<br>  so check out>><a href="http://www.mdofpc.com/onlinestore/jasc-animation-shop-full-download-p-860.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.mdofpc.com/onlinestore/jasc-a...</a>
TQVbiXtFaa	Chances are you're saving it as either a bitmap (I know nothing of Photofiltre, but this may be its default), JPEG, or perhaps a Photofiltre-only extension of which I am unaware. You need to save it as either a GIF or a PNG (PNG is best, but it takes up a bit of space). This is done when saving: under the area you'd place your desired filname, there should be another box containing a dropdown. That dropdown contains several choices for saving. Pick one of those, okay? :)

I was also wondering that.|`|kz0fRjlMaa	i never new that i don't member then going on the field trip mabye thay did idk|`|daza5A4vaa	Because the movie had more plot holes than the book.<br>  I thought the movie was awful, and they could have done a much better job.<br>  <br>  Did they even go on a field trip in the book?<br>  I don't remember it.<br>  Maybe they did.|`|vrcxxRr8aa	Why is this in the B&A section? You're talking about the movie, so it should be in that section.
IJMyRWp4aa	i really agree with you on this the movie was great but they really could've done a way better job. the books were so amazing and the movie should've been  a tribute to that. i also thought it was cute how klutzy Bella is and how she cooks for her dad. one thing that kinda ticked me off is that in the book Jasper has lines and actually alot of lines but in the movie he barely says anything at all. i love jasper and alice's characters along with all the vampires in the book and would've loved to see more of them. and i'm also in agreement with you on the ending quickly thing. i mean in the book there was a huge series of things the lead her to the house and the airport was completely cut out of the movie and in the book you see more of alice and bella's relationship but in the movie there are barely any of that. the movie is awesome but the books are way better.|`|2wRWkjIlaa	I hated the movie, the book was 5092q83590285390283908290 times better<br>  The movie had horrible directors.

In general no one is fit to play Edward <3. <br>  They skipped the blood typing scene! <br>  Jasper looked too stressed. <br>  From my point of view they didn't explain the story very well.<br>  Ugh.. the kissing scene was awkward, why he hell was she in her underwear...<br>  Alice was great haha<br>  Carlise looked frikin PERFECT! <3<br>  I didn't think that Rosalie looked like the most beautiful person in the world but no one really is but still.<br>  yeah Emmet should have had more funny parts and you don't really get to hear his "Booming Laugh"<br>  EDWARDS ROOM! why is is so MESSY!?!?!? I figured it to be sorta bigger lol.<br>  lol random dancing in Edward's room?!?<br>  Rob had a hair chest!!! I was like oh my god what!??!?!<br>  Lol when Edward "sparkled" he literally SPARKLED it just sorta looked like he rolled in party glitter lmao.<br>  They did have some good quotes from the book but just not enough lol.<br>  They make Edward seem sorta weird and I don't think they captured the whole strong love between Bella and Edward<br>  I don't know I just think that some of the actors were kinda "stiff" I don't really know how to explain it.<br>  Well there's probably tons more but I wont write that much lol.<br>  (okay new moon comments haha)<br>  I know Dakota Fanning only MAYBE be Jane in New Moon, but I don't think she's the right person for the part. Because she'd probably attract more attention because shes more famous and that I heard that Vanessa Hudgends was going to play Leah too.<br>  They better show more Edward in New Moon or else I'll die if hes not there for like 90% of the movie lmao! (no offense to Jacob loverss)|`|uDXt5C9oaa	well i didn't really enjoy the kissing scene....it just seemed not genuine.

MY GOD HES NOT EVEN CUTE<br>  <br>  i see  A LOT of thumbs downs in this answer's near future...|`|0OpHW97Xaa	I loved the movie!! I think your reading way more into it then you should. First of all it's a movie so yeah not all of the parts that we wanted to see are in the movie...life sucks like that but we have to learn how to accept it. As for klutzy Bella I really didn't notice it that much and it wasn't something for me that needed to be made into a big deal...Oh and I think the only reason that they had the audience not hear Edward thoughts was because it was from the point of view from Bella. In the books you didn't hear Edwards thoughts so why in the movie should you. Edward told her what he heard when other people thought it wasn't actually written as dialog. To me it ended wonderfully because seriously when I was at the end of the book it was when Bella was in the hospital and then the dance that quick and I was like is that it?? So yeah I think they did that good. Good things about the movie my favorite part was when Bella and Edward finally got together and they go to school and he drapes his arm around her and Bella says "everyone is staring" and Edward says "Not everyone. Not that guy...oh wait now he is." or something like that. Overall I loved the movie.|`|ZaBGMT12aa	What I most hated was clothes didn't fit. I'm pretty sure Bella's supposed to be a Goodwill fan and all that, but I'm sure she found stuff that, you know, FIT. Also Rosalie's clothes were so small that they made her look huge, and she's not huge. And not huge as in fat. Huge as in... just gigantic. Large. A giant. Her clothes weren't even small in a sex-appeal way. Just a "we had nothing left so we shoved her in these" way.<br>  <br>  It's also unfortunate that they made Nikki Reed dye her hair blonde to play Rosalie. I know most Twilight fans would have gone into cardiac arrest had Rosalie been a brunette, but Nikki Reed is a gorgeous brunette and an unfortunate blonde.|`|cJEP35wuaa	Toottaly Aggread they left a little too much..<br>  They also forgot to show the relashionship beetween Alice& Bella grow<br>  And thats so improtant because in new moon she misses her , but why would she miss her if in the movie it shows shes finds alica weird?<br>  <br>  It did kinda annoy me that they left some really good parts out<br>  <br>  I love the guy who plays emmet<br>  when i saw him, i said EMMET<br>  omglol<br>  ...<br>  I dont really like jenifer and mike at all!<br>  <br>  Dont like the guy who played james either<br>  But i luv the books<br>  but im not an fanatic<br>  they just annoy me<br>  really !<br>  ugh,,,<br>  thats all they talk about<br>  lol-lol

They're received by a Dickensian assortment of sadistic thugs, greasy criminals, and corrupt cops, all hiding something.|`|kdSuwt8paa	One flew over the cuckoo's nest is a good one.|`|NhPSz1kHaa	One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest by Ken Kesey<br>  <br>  books by Laurie Halse Anderson<br>  <br>  <a href="http://books4teensandadults.googlepages.com/recent" rel="nofollow">http://books4teensandadults.googlepages....</a>|`|EtOYeANLaa	Unda a Bridge with Dick an Harry , it starts of about an Aardvark and ends up talking about xylophones or something similar<br>  It is a good read and you learn heaps
ZaBGMT12aa	There are HUGE differences between the two.<br>  <br>  Confessions of a Shopaholic is my preference. It made me laugh out loud because it was funny (as opposed to Twilight, which made me laugh out loud in the wrong places, like when Bella is whining that Edward won't talk to her) and I fell in love with Becky's overreactions. Her compulsive lying is awful, and I was irritated with her more than once, but I always returned to loving her (as opposed to Bella, whom I came to despise). Becky and Luke's relationship is healthy (as opposed to Edward and Bella's, whose is abusive).<br>  <br>  I love adult novels because they have mature humor and use the F-word in highly amusing and appropriate places. They can also have fade-to-black sex scenes without people freaking out, saying, "Oh, is it okay if a 13 year old reads this?"<br>  <br>  Give me Sophie Kinsella over Stephenie Meyer any day.|`|lGF9GpI1aa	Oh gosh, Twilight.

Im not the typical tee-hee teenage twilight fan girl though. You have to see how great Stephanie captures first true love. For that she is brilliant.
eNulfbs7aa	Use the scene from Gone With The Wind..where she picks up the soil..and hold it to the sky and talks about "tomorrow will be another day"  I love that scene..it can be soooo dramatic...if you haven't seen it...get it..you will know the scene I mean..she is dressed in black and holding the soil from Tara up to the sky...it is incredible
YO33Zh9eaa	I don't know. Did you write it??? :D ignore the girl above me. She is just trying  be mean. It's good. Just by giving that poem to someone could boost their confidence. You could really make someone happy and get them in a good mood by giving that to them. You know that? You could go to Google and type in types of poems and pick the one that most sounds like it, or just go to Google and instead of typing in a specific thing, type in your question. It works I tried it. GOOD LUCK! I hope I helped. I bet you know some of these other people too. I answered people about poem questions like that. I bet they're doing the same thing you are. :D

Though the original armiger may have placed particular meaning on a charge, these meanings are not necessarily retained from generation to generation. Unless canting arms incorporate an obvious pun on the bearer's name, it may difficult to find meaning in them." <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heraldry" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heraldry</a><br>  <br>  That said, the arms of Prussia were "Argent, an eagle displayed Sable crowned Or."  But this motif appears in many arms and it denotes different things according to each armiger.  The crest you describe, "A pair of wings (or vol) Or," is just as puzzling unless you know the armiger.  Then you can begin to research the possible design intent..

o3sYIdOzaa	1. "In one of the saddest episodes of our brief history, men, women, and children were taken from their land, herded into makeshift forts with minimal facilities and food, then forced to march a thousand miles(Some made part of the trip by boat in equally horrible conditions). Under the generally indifferent army commanders, human losses for the first groups of Cherokee removed were extremely high. John Ross made an urgent appeal to Scott, requesting that the general let his people lead the tribe west. General Scott agreed. Ross organized the Cherokee into smaller groups and let them move separately through the wilderness so they could forage for food. Although the parties under Ross left in early fall and arrived in Oklahoma during the brutal winter of 1838-39, he significantly reduced the loss of life among his people. About 4000 Cherokee died as a result of the removal. The route they traversed and the journey itself became known as "The Trail of Tears" or, as a direct translation from Cherokee, "The Trail Where They Cried" ("Nunna daul Tsuny")." <br>  <br>  2. Gold was discovered on their land.<br>  <br>  3. "I saw the helpless Cherokees arrested and dragged from their homes, and driven at the bayonet point into the stockades. And in the chill of a drizzling rain on an October morning I saw them loaded like cattle or sheep into six hundred and forty-five wagons and started toward the west....On the morning of November the 17th we encountered a terrific sleet and snow storm with freezing temperatures and from that day until we reached the end of the fateful journey on March the 26th 1839, the sufferings of the Cherokees were awful. The trail of the exiles was a trail of death. They had to sleep in the wagons and on the ground without fire. And I have known as many as twenty-two of them to die in one night of pneumonia due to ill treatment, cold and exposure..."<br>                            Private John G. Burnett, Captain Abraham McClellan's Company, 2nd Regiment, 2nd Brigade, Mounted Infantry, Cherokee Indian Removal, 1838-39<br>  1838 – Seven thousand federal troops, under the command of General Winfield Scott, were dispatched to the Cherokee Nation. Without warning, the troops broke down doors and drug people away to stockades. Those that moved too slowly were prodded with bayonets.   In October, the Cherokees were herded into wooden stockades with no food, water, blankets, or sanitation. Most of them were barefoot and had no coats or blankets, yet they were forced to cross rivers in sub-zero weather. <br>  <br>  They were forced-marched, with army guards, as far north as Indiana, on their way to Oklahoma. Thousands of men, women, and children froze to death, died of starvation and disease. The soldiers forced the Cherokees to abandon their dead at the side of the road. What few pitiful possessions they owned, had to be dropped at the side of the road in order to carry the sick and dying. Soldiers and settlers plundered the ancient Cherokee burial grounds for buried treasure. Family possessions left behind were plundered and burned.  Of the 22,000 Cherokees who started this death-march, some 5,500 died on the way. One thousand six hundred Freedmen walked the Trail of Tears along with the rest of Cherokee. <br>  <br>  At the plantation of Spring Place, the Georgia Guard threw a burning log onto the stairs to smoke out the people that lived there. The man who had won the house in the Georgia state lottery was there, urging the soldiers on to get ‘those people’ out of ‘his’ house. The Georgia Guard drove the missionaries out of their homes and school nearby, and turned it into a brothel for the army.<br>  <br>  A guard (some years later) wrote, “I fought through the War (Civil War), and I saw men shot to pieces and slaughtered by the thousands, but the Cherokee Removal was the cruelest work I ever knew.”<br>  <br>  A traveler from Maine wrote “Aging females, apparently nearly ready to drop into the grave, were traveling with heavy burdens attached to their backs – on frozen ground with no covering for their feet except what nature had given them.  We learned from the inhabitants of the road where the Indians passed that they buried fourteen or fifteen at each stopping place.”<br>  <br>  John G Burnett, a soldier who participated in the Removal wrote, “Men working in fields were arrested and driven into stockades. Women were dragged from their homes, by soldiers whose language they did not understand. Children were separated from their parents and driven into stockades with the sky for a blanket and the earth for a pillow. The old and infirm were prodded with bayonets to hasten them to the stockades. In one home, death had come during the night, a sad faced little child had died and was lying on a bear skin couch and some women were preparing the little boy for burial. All were arrested and driven out, leaving the dead child in the cabin.  I don’t know who buried the body.  <br>  <br>  In another home was a frail mother, apparently a widow and three small children, one just a baby. When told that she must go, the mother gathered the children at her feet, prayed a humble prayer in her native tongue, patted the old family dog on the head, told the faithful creature goodbye, with a baby strapped on her back and leading a child with each hand, started on her exile. But the task was too great for the frail mother. A stroke of heart failure relieved her suffering. She sunk and died with her baby on her back, and her other two children clinging to her hands”<br>  <br>  4. "Removed Cherokees initially settled near Tahlequah, Oklahoma. The political turmoil resulting from the Treaty of New Echota and the Trail of Tears led to the assassinations of Major Ridge, John Ridge, and Elias Boudinot; of the leaders of the Treaty Party, only Stand Watie escaped his assassins. The population of the Cherokee Nation eventually rebounded, and today the Cherokees are the largest American Indian group in the United States.<br>  <br>  There were some exceptions to removal. Perhaps 100 Cherokees evaded the U.S. soldiers and lived off the land in Georgia and other states. Those Cherokees who lived on private, individually owned lands (rather than communally owned tribal land) were not subject to removal. In North Carolina, about 400 Cherokees, known as the Oconaluftee Cherokee, lived on land in the Great Smoky Mountains owned by a white man named William Holland Thomas (who had been adopted by Cherokees as a boy), and were thus not subject to removal. Added to this were some 200 Cherokee from the Nantahala area allowed to stay after assisting the U.S. Army hunt down and capture the family of the old prophet Tsali (Tsali faced a firing squad). These North Carolina Cherokees became the Eastern Band of the Cherokee Nation."<br>  <br>  5. "Samuel Cloud: Samuel Cloud turned 9 years old on the Trail of Tears. Samuel's Memory is told by his great-great grandson, Micheal Rutledge, in his paper Forgiveness in the Age of Forgetfulness. Micheal, a citizen of the Cherokee Nation of Oklahoma, is a law student at Arizona State University.<br>  <br>  It is Spring. The leaves are on the trees. I am playing with my friends when white men in uniforms ride up to our home. My mother calls me. I can tell by her voice that something is wrong. Some of the men ride off. My mother tells me to gather my things, but the men don't allow us time to get anything. They enter our home and begin knocking over pottery and looking into everything. My mother and I are taken by several men to where their horses are and are held there at gun point. The men who rode off return with my father, Elijah. They have taken his rifle and he is walking toward us.<br>  <br>  I can feel his anger and frustration. There is nothing he can do. From my mother I feel fear. I am filled with fear, too. What is going on? I was just playing, but now my family and my friends' families are gathered together and told to walk at the point of a bayonet. <br>  <br>  We walk a long ways. My mother does not let me get far from her. My father is walking by the other men, talking in low, angry tones. The soldiers look weary, as though they'd rather be anywhere else but here. <br>  <br>  They lead us to a stockade. They herd us into this pen like we are cattle. No one was given time to gather any possessions. The nights are still cold in the mountains and we do not have enough blankets to go around. My mother holds me at night to keep me warm. That is the only time I feel safe. I feel her pull me to her tightly. I feel her warm breath in my hair. I feel her softness as I fall asleep at night. <br>  <br>  As the days pass, more and more of our people are herded into the stockade. I see other members of my clan. We children try to play, but the elders around us are anxious and we do not know what to think. I often sit and watch the others around me. I observe the guards. I try not to think about my hunger. I am cold. <br>  <br>  Several months have passed and still we are in the stockades. My father looks tired. He talks with the other men, but no one seems to know what to do or what is going to happen. We hear that white men have moved into our homes and are farming our fields. What will happen to us? We are to march west to join the Western Cherokees. I don't want to leave these mountains. <br>  <br>  My mother, my aunts and uncles take me aside one day. "Your father died last night," they tell me. My mother and my father's clan members are crying, but I do not understand what this means. I saw him yesterday. He was sick, but still alive. It doesn't seem real. Nothing seems real. I don't know what any of this means. It seems like yesterday, I was playing with my friends. <br>  <br>  It is now Fall. It seems like forever since I was clean. The stockade is nothing but mud. In the morning it is stiff with frost. By mid-afternoon, it is soft and we are all covered in it.|`|0741081782691c4bf15f3f43c93552d6aa	I hope this helps.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.powersource.com/cocinc/history/trail.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.powersource.com/cocinc/histor...</a><br>  <a href="http://www.powersource.com/cherokee/history.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.powersource.com/cherokee/hist...</a><br>  <a href="http://www.crystalinks.com/trailoftears.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.crystalinks.com/trailoftears....</a>|`|bPd7llYuaa	1.

Andrew Jackson, the president a the time, stretched his executive powers by putting into law the Indian Removal Act of 1830. This law made allowed the President to move , by force if necessary, all Indians west of the Mississippi River. <br>  3. The journey was tedious, deadly, and long. The Indians that Jackson instructed to leave had already been living on farms and cultivating land and living as another American citizen would have, and they were no longer in touch with Nature as previous Native Americans had been so they were not prepared for the long and treacherous journey. <br>  4.

All my friends were in love with it, and when I finally got hold of the book from the library, I said to myself that it would probably be good since everyone was like, in love with it.<br>  The book was killing me. I mean, I kept on falling asleep. And I'm not exaggerating or anything.<br>  <br>  As for Harry Potter, I have all 7 audiobooks in my iPod and whenever I get bored I listen to them. I've listened to all 7 books at least 4 times each over the past 2-3 years.<br>  <br>  So overall, I think Harry Potter's amazing. It's epic, it's for all ages, and it's not repetitive.<br>  Harry Potter's a classic while Twilight's just a jumble of trash with not a single drop of real literature.<br>  <br>  Peace -I'm 13|`|u0zEutf1aa	A book can destroy people's minds?

VVQYuMO1aa	THESE ARE SCAMS DON'T USE THESE !!!! <br>  P.S. AT THE BOTTOM THERE IS A SITE TO USE I KNOW THIS IS A LOT BUT IT HELPED ME KNOW WHAT SITES !NOT! TO USE<br>  1. Exploretalent- Overcharges for castings that you can find for free ie Craigslist. They also steal breakdowns from legit sites like Actors Access and post it as their own. Most of what they steal are outdated and posted without the original poster's consent. It also was owned by Blake Yoon who had a scammy casting company called B.A.M. <br>  <br>  2. One Source Talent-Similar to Explore talent. They charge you $400 to have a digital comp card on their site with a $30 monthly fee. They tell you to use their photographer that charges at least another $500-800. The only CDs that they work with are reality show ones ie. MTV, VH1 <br>  <br>  3. John Robert Powers-It's a crappy franchise that banks on a famous and DEAD agent's name. They charge a ridiculous price and claim that many celebrities went through the school such as John Wayne, Lucille Ball, etc. NONE of them did!<br>  <br>  4. John Casablancas-Crappy franchise like JRP. Dishonest business practices as well. <br>  <br>  5. Keith Wolfe-Career consultant who charges $400 to hook you up with scammy agencies like Dedicated and Don Gerler(Doug Bennet). False promises. <br>  <br>  6. Hollywood Company/Model One Casting-Charge up front fees for extra work that doesn't exist and management services. They claim that they're sister companies with Central Casting, a legit extras casting service. THEY AREN'T! <br>  <br>  7. Infinitetalent-Same as OneSource <br>  <br>  8. Actorsreps-Scammy agency. Mostly deal with extra work. <br>  <br>  9. EAM Casting/Mediaentertainment1.com-Google "Bill Starkov" and you'll see that this company scammed a lot of people. <br>  <br>  10. Dedicated-Originally Zanuck, Passon, and Pace, one of the scammiest agencies in L.A. When they were ZPP they would make their clients use their photographer and take their classes. They also made you get 10 character shots such as literally dressing up like a doctor, cop, construction worker, etc. You don't get character shots! Dedicated is still up to this scheme. <br>  <br>  11. Michael Zanuck-Split from Dedicated in hopes of bettering his reputation, but still up to the same schemes. He at least makes you get 6 character shots instead of 10. <br>  <br>  12. Doug Bennett of Don Gerler-He makes you get 15 character shots. Wastes your time with multiple 2 hour interviews, consisting of him mostly talking. If you thought the agent movie stereotype was phony, think again. <br>  <br>  13. Sylvia Ferguson-Not state licensed. Charges $140 a year for this bogus casting service called E-Talent files. She entices potential clients into getting the service by saying it will help better their chances. <br>  <br>  14. Talent6-Inferior casting site. They like to send "urgent" e-mails from supposed CDs wanting to audition you in their projects. In order to respond you have to pay the Talent Hunter fee to leave reply messages on the site! <br>  <br>  15. Barbizon-Popular school in the 70s. Now another JRP. <br>  <br>  16. Kevyn Major Howard-Overcharges and underdelivers. Does a lot of things that agents/cds hate with regards to headshots. He's also known to hit on hot girls during photo shoots. <br>  <br>  17. MMPRG- Management company that works with Baron Entertainment. They make you take classes with them for $80 bucks a month. They also make you use their photographer who isn't very good. They prey mostly on people doing extra work in L.A. using bait and swtich tactics. Howard Ferguson (owner) tells people that he's associated with Baron Entertainment, edifies the hell out of them and gets people interested in coming to his management company. <br>  <br>  18. Model Management Inc-Upfront fees. Another ONESOURCE.<br>  <br>  19. Talent Hunter-Another inferior casting site. They post "urgent" e-mails from supposed CDs wanting to audition you in their projects. In order to respond you would have to pay the Talent Hunter fee to leave reply messages on the site! <br>  <br>  20. Actor's Club (they advertise fake breakdowns on other sites and then when you submit for the "project", they tell you to go to the "Actor's Club" site to fill out a profile. Only after you have done all that do they tell you about the fees. PRESTO they have your email and then they SPAM you forever to join their site.<br>  <br>  21. Talent Jug- Like Explore Talent where it takes castings from other casting sites. They also mysteriously get your email and spam you.<br>  <br>  22.ACT-Another JRP<br>  <br>  23. Pinkerton Model And Talent-Not state licensed.

draNVjbkaa	Bring a journal and pen. You want to document everything you learn during your acting career. A journal will keep all of your notes together and it will be of more sentimental value to you than a regular notepad.<br>  <br>  A pencil in case you have to take notes on scripts.<br>  <br>  Come in comfortable clothing.<br>  <br>  MOST IMPORTANT: Bring an OPEN mind! You'll be doing things that you probably wouldn't do before.|`|kiD47XbTaa	They usually tell you if you need to bring something, so I wouldn't if I were you. You usually bring nothing to your first acting class, and at the end of the class your teacher will tell you what to bring to your next lesson.<br>  But, make sure you wear comfortable clothing and bring a water bottle. <br>  But if you're still a bit worried, call the school you're going to and ask them, or you could just bring a pen and a small notepad, but since its your first lesson, you don't have to bring anything.|`|ezT1nsexaa	Eldorado pretty much covered everything. Always bring a large water bottle with you. Lots of talking or moving around will make you plenty thirsty. Water can also keep your voice fresh if you have a little congestion or a dry throat. Good luck and remember to just have fun with it!
EyL6Pic3aa	If you're looking for something comparable to Prismacolor but cheaper, than the Blick brand is a pretty good choice. If you're looking for something better than Prismacolor, (and cheaper) than look no further. Here it is. <a href="http://www.dickblick.com/products/derwent-coloursoft-pencils/" rel="nofollow">http://www.dickblick.com/products/derwen...</a><br>  <br>  Colored pencil, just like any other medium really comes down to the artist's preference. I personally like a very soft pencil. I want to feel like the pigment is melting onto the paper. These Derwent pencils feel like that. Most people think that Prismacolor is the be all, and end all of colored pencil. In the past few years Prismacolor have outsourced they're colored pencil production to a company in china, and the quality has gone down ever since.|`|hUYaaXBvaa	i would go with choice two<br>  while it's not a professional opinion i do draw (i believe i own prismacolors myself- they are nice)<br>  i prefer the softer type for shading<br>  i would ask someone at a craft store, like michaels, or go with whatever one is economical<br>  people tend to send me colored pencils as gifts and the ones in those tins aren;t bad<br>  <br>  have you tried faber-castell|`|Wm24YP6caa	Prisma colors are definitely the best.

8ygky5g4aa	Take them to a professional cobbler or shoe hospital.  You are correct, if the taps are not put on correctly they will poke into your shoes.  Look in the online yellow pages for shoe repair and give them a call to find out if they can put the taps on.  If they are not experienced with putting taps on find some place else!  Also you can call local dance apparel shops and find out who they refer people to to have the taps put on.  Don't do them yourself, it's not worth it!

PDcnXgE6aa	Practice and drawing ur thoughts.........surely within few failure u will learn lots........|`|pDKm9Wmgaa	The reason watercolor seems so difficult to many is because it is painted in reverse of all other mediums. In all other mediums you paint dark to light. In watercolor you paint light to dark. Many artists cannot make that leap. <br>  The best book I have found (and I have several) is 'Everything You Ever Wanted to Know About Watercolor' Edited by Marian Appellof. It was the book used in a Beginning Watercolor course I took several years ago at my community college. That would be another thing to do, take a class. <br>  I also don't recommend using student grade paint, you won't be happy with the results. The pigments won't be as saturated, and the finished paintings won't look quite as nice. <br>  The links below are to a couple of online art supply houses that I have ordered from. I have been extremely happy with both. The men who founded each are watercolor artists, and their watercolor paint is very good. I especially like Daniel Smith's Primatek watercolors and the Iridescent and Duochrome paints. The Primatek are ground minerals, many of them semi precious stone like Amethyst or Tiger's Eye. <br>  Have fun!<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.cheapjoes.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.cheapjoes.com/</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.danielsmith.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.danielsmith.com/</a>|`|41519dcd613e198147ae134a0f6e6e78aa	Start using the brush and colors.

Best of Luck !|`|413ee09d955875dba8ae05421b67f00daa	Watercolor painting is the most difficult, they call it thinking paint, you must think before you apply any color, the best way is buy good book about how to paint watercolor, not so expensive watercolor block, and watercolor paint for student(not expensive). Read the book carefully, and try until you get good result, after that you can try to paint what ever you like, but do not give up because you might have to paint the same picture more than ten time to get it right.  Rome did not built in one day.  Good luck|`|7fvzJIqvaa	Watercolor can be a tricky medium to master.

ThdFMIFUaa	I took dance (about 10 hours a week) and cross country at the same time last fall. I loved both of them!! I was a little short for time sometimes, and I didn't have a lot of time for homework, but it was a great experience and I loved it. <br>  <br>  I only had to pick one over the other twice, and it was only practices, not major things like meets or performances. I highly recommend you do both! I got a little tired sometimes, but I got through it. <br>  <br>  I'm not going to tell you it's easy. It's not, and sometimes you have to stay up really late to do other things like homework. And you may have to give up something like television, or watch it less often. But in my opinion, it was worth it a thousand times over.<br>  <br>  I do track now (with the same dance schedule) and it gets a little hectic, but it's amazing. I have tons of friends from all over and built lasting relationships with my teammates. And plus, I still have time to mess around on Yahoo! Answers.<br>  <br>  :)|`|ybwqYZ1waa	Well, that's really your decision. Which do you feel more passionate about? Now you answer my question.|`|G2mJppm0aa	What do you want to do? <br>  <br>  What would make you the happiest? <br>  <br>  What would you do with it? <br>  <br>  Break dancing is fun, but you have to devote your life to it to become any good. Hip-hop classes on the other hand would do anyone good. You dance at social functions and clubs later in life, and knowing how to dance is great to attract the opposite sex as well as make you look good out there, and improve our coordination.

The rich countries exploited the poor countries and taxed them into poverty.|`|bdnMQnVHaa	There are a number of factors, some include population and natural resources.|`|NYU37jfGaa	I don't know, but I found P.J. Rourke's discussion of the subject fairly convincing.  In 'Eat the Rich', P.J. O'Rourke writes:<br>  <br>  'Why do some places prosper and thrive while others just suck?  It's not a matter of brains.  No part of the earth (with the possible exception of Brentwood) is dumber than Beverley Hills, and the residents are wading in gravy.  In Russia, meanwhile, where chess is a spectator sport, they're boiling stones for soup.  Nor can education be the reason.  fourth graders in the American school system know what a condom is but aren't sure about 9 x 7.  Natural resources aren't the answer.  Africa has diamonds, gold, uranium, you name it.  Scandinavia has little and is frozen besides.  Mabye culture is the key, but wealthy regions such as the local mall are famous for lacking it.<br>  <br>  Government does not cause affluence.  Citizens of totalitarian countries have plenty of government and nothing of anything else.  Plain hard work is not the source of plenty.  The poorer people are, the plainer and harder the work they do.  The better-off play golf.  And technology provides no guarantee of creature comforts.  The most wretched locales in the world are well-supplied with complex and up-to-date technologies - in the form of weapons.'<br>  <br>  In O'rourke's book he discusses why some places flourish while others fail.  One chapter 'How to Make Nothing from Everything' is about Tanzania.  The following chapter 'How to Make Everything from Nothing is about Hong Kong.  Discussing the differences between these two places, he writes:<br>  <br>  'How a peaceful, uncrowded place with ample wherewithal stays poor is hard to explain.  How a conflict-ridden, grossly overpopulated place with no resources whatsoever gets rich is simple.  The British government turned Hong Kong into an economic miracle by doing nothing.<br>    Hong Kong is the best contemporary example of laissez-faire.  The economic theory of "allow to do" holds that all sorts of doings ought, indeed to be allowed, and that government should interfere only to  keep the peace, ensure legal rights, and protect property.'<br>  <br>  I would advise reading 'Eat the Rich' to gain some understanding of why some countries are rich and others poor.  I would however discount what the comment above says about overpopulation.  It is evident that plenty of sparsely populated places (like Tanzania) are poor, while some wildly overcrowded places (like Hong Kong) are prosperous.  The notion that overpopulation and poverty go together is erroneous.|`|vEsSIGfYaa	There are many reasons, but I can think of a few things that have contributed to the "poorness" of Third World countries.<br>  <br>  1.  They make more babies than they or the land and food system can take care of.<br>  2.  They are ignorant and don't have any, or an adequate education system.<br>  3.  Because of this ignorance, they end up with leaders who are, or become, dictators and tyrants.<br>  4.  Their leaders, and their friends and relatives, steal most of the country's income from its natural resources for their own enrichment, and leave the people in poverty.<br>  <br>  On the other hand, the "rich" countries have a literate population, control their birth rate, educate their children, have a democratic form of government that controls or eliminates its leaders and kin from stealing from the people.|`|Bv3Dm11paa	Basically if all the countries had the same amount of wealth the standard of living in the USA and other Western nations would decrease. The Western nations keep the 3rd world poor to maintain their lifestyles. Also we create 3/4 of the worlds waste and only make up 1/4 of the worlds population.<br>  <br>  Good Question!

RXtUaI5baa	Draw from life!<br>  <br>  I learned to draw people and animals doing them from life.  Sometimes you can only get small gesture sketch done, but even if your subject moves right after you begin, if you are filling your pages with little thumbnail-sized gesture sketches of the basics -- frame, limbs, head position, and some basic shadow-shapes -- you will soon learn proportion and form.  You can draw anywhere: on the bus, at the mall, at the park, in class.  Drawing from life is the BEST way to learn.  <br>  <br>  In fact, only after you have mastered drawing what you see directly before you will you be able to draw things "from the top of your head" and have them be convincing.  <br>  <br>  Good question, and good luck.|`|dKrLAJaEaa	First you must learn basic anatomy, Its about how it all comes together. A good foundation will help you draw without models because you will know where everything goes. Even a simple face is easier to draw if you understand how the muscles lay over the bones.

AA11922229	I really like this story. I'm a dad and that story is a parable for me. Children are like that. They are not responsible for their actions, and they have so much admiration for their parents. I spanked my children a few times when I was young and stupid and today after many years I regret it completely. Thanks for sharing that story. Although, I grew up in a family believing in corporal punishment, I now don't believe in it. <br>  <br>  The key is don't react, take a break and respond. Parents need to know they have options to respond after they cool their tempers down. <br>  <br>  I tell young parents today to give their children lots of hugs, attention, and breaks, and they will be the best parents.<br>  <br>  Parenting is not easy.|`|JgDRKLuLaa	Sounds like a stupid myspace bulletin chain.|`|W057fV0Vaa	No is not|`|cJEP35wuaa	doubt it <br>  do you really thik the four year old would care enough?<br>  but if it is aw.... thats cute<br>  :)<br>  I LUV yAh DadDIE|`|UH7fRgyWaa	if i were a kid and my dad had just hit with  wrench, i would be terrified of my dad|`|jzdDF3Ljaa	something like that prolly happened before.|`|2G1vKuZAaa	its a big world, im sure its happened|`|m703KlwGaa	aww. idk but that story is sad but nice? <br>  <br>  sounds like those email things that are never true|`|2ZMlkKCiaa	damn, that kid got owned|`|hJ5lQXehaa	No.|`|Bwws3Ud1aa	omg,that is so sad :(<br>  not sure if it's true though...?|`|KxdDeO8Taa	awwwww... im not sur its true, but thats so sad!!!!!!! :(|`|pX0yPZlyaa	nope 4 year olds cannot write "I LOVE YOU DADDY"|`|Cq2u8K9Iaa	Hell no!

qRx3ynKdaa	“Le Morte d’Arthur” (intended to be translated as “The Death of Arthure”) is the title given by William Caxton to his 1485 edition of Sir Thomas Malory's work, which to judge from a statement almost at the end of this edition was called by Malory “The Hoole Book of King Arthur and of His Noble Knyghtes of the Rounde Table", or something like that. A manuscript version of the work discovered in 1934 is unfortunately missing some pages at the beginning and end so we do not know what the title of the work was in the manuscript.<br>  <br>  I presume by “Geoffrey” you mean Geoffrey of Monmouth (named as Galfriedus Monumentesis in Latin) who wrote no book called “Le Morte d’Arthur” but did produce the first reasonably full surviving biography of Arthur as the most important part of his work “Historia Regum Britanniae”, that is, his “History of the Kings of Brtiain”.<br>  <br>  Geoffrey’s work was relatively short, written in Latin and finished in 1136, and focuses mostly on the figure of Arthur himself and his supposed conquests, which include Ireland, Iceland, Norway, Denmark (Dacia), Gaul, and the defeat of a Roman army which attempted to reconquer Gaul. For a modern English translation of the Arthurian portion of his work see <a href="http://www.lib.rochester.edu/camelot/geofhkb.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.lib.rochester.edu/camelot/geo...</a> .<br>  <br>  Malory's work is rather long and was written in English in 1469 or 1470, and focuses largely on the exploits of Arthur’s knights, notably on Lancelot and Tristan (Tristram), neither of which are mentioned by Geoffrey. For Caxton’s edition of this work in modern spelling and punctuation see <a href="http://www.sacred-texts.com/neu/mart/" rel="nofollow">http://www.sacred-texts.com/neu/mart/</a> . It is also almost the last work which is presents authentic medieval Arthurian tales not found elsewhere. But most of Malory’s sources are well known.<br>  <br>  Arthurian romance tales were mostly developed in French, and vaguely followed Geoffrey’s account. Battles by Arthur against the Saxons were sometimes introduced, though the precise account given by Geoffrey of Arthur’s battles against Colgrinus (Colgrim), Baldulphus (Baldulf) and Cheldericus (Chederic) do not appear in any romances, and either do those characters.<br>  <br>  Also Arthur's followers and allies Cador of Cornwall and Hoel of Little Britain almost never appear in Arthurian romances, though there is a King Hoel of Little Britain in the Tristan romances. And while King Lot of Lothian in Geoffrey later becomes King of Norway and is still fighting for Arthur in the Roman war near the end of the tale, in the romance King Lot is King Loenois (Lothian) and Orcani (Orkney) and unconnected with Norway.  In many romances Lot is long dead, indeed in the Post-Vulgate Arthurian cycle, and thence in Malory, King Lot is killed in an early rebellion against Arthur while his son Gawain was still a child.<br>  <br>  The central French prose works upon which later prose romances were based were the “Prose Lancelot”, the "Quest of the Holy Grail'', and the “Death of Arthur”. In the “Prose Lancelot” there is a single war against invading Saxons, but this is hardly to Arthur’s credit as Arthur falls in love with a Saxon princess who betrays him and imprisons him, and it is Lancelot in Arthur's armor who leads his men to victory and to Arthur’s rescue. However, Geoffrey's story of how Arthur conquered Gaul in single combat with Frollo is included.<br>  <br>  In “The Death of Arthur”, Arthur now goes into Gaul to battle against Lancelot, not to fight the Romans, though a very short account of a war with the Romans is included after Arthur departs from Lancelot and before he learns of Mordred's rebellion. In these works for the first time in surviving literature, Mordred is said to be Arthur’s illegitimate son begotten on his own half-sister, not just Arthur's nephew.<br>  <br>  Malory was in prison when he wrote his work, and was apparently dependent on what sources he could lay his hands on. Which may explain in part why his work includes 2/3 of the second version of the “Prose Tristan” but only some sections of the “Prose Lancelot”. Malory does include a version of Geoffrey’s Roman War mainly from an English poem known as the “Alliterative Morte Arthure”, but places it early in Arthur's reign and provides his own happy ending in which Arthur conquers Rome and then returns home in triumph.<br>  <br>  Geoffrey includes a large number of names in the last section of his Arthurian work, which are generally ignored in the romances, including Malory's. Geoffrey’s characters are often substituted with characters more familiar in the romances, for example, Boso of Oxford and Guerin of Chartes are replaced by Yvain and Sagremor, though Malory replaces them with Bors of Gaunes and Lionel.<br>  <br>  Geoffrey seems to picture Arthur’s nephew Gawain, is seneschal Kay, and his butler Bedivere as Arthur’s best knights. But by Malory’s day Gawain is often a lying murderer and no long one of the best knights, Kay is an arrogant bully and a joke as a knight, and Bedivere is seldom mentioned at all. In the French “Death of Arthur” a knight named Girflet is Arthur’s last companion. But Girflet, though reasonably prominent in French romances, barely appears in English romances, which may be why the author of the English “Stanzaic Morte Arthur” substiuted Bedivere. Although Malory knew the French “Death of Arthur” it was his English poem which was the main source for the end of his romances, and so Bedivere is the name of the knight in “Le Morte d’Arthur”.
xv7YlV29aa	I think we love it so much because they pretend they are teenagers, going to school and the most handsome student that all the girls wants, falls for Bella, a new girl in town who is not gorgeous. She happens to be quite klutzy (which is cute) Most people would think that he'd fall for someone like Rosalie, a girl gorgeous enough to be a model. (NOT talking about the actress, they could of picked someone better then her)<br>  <br>  Its just really cute. Alice is adorable, Emmett is hilarious, Jasper is so nice and has a huge past, Carisle is a vampire and also a doctor....that is kinda weird but cool. Esme is the mother, its so cute that they allow her to be mommy even though shes not that much older then her lol. And Rosalie is the *****. Every story needs someone like her. Jacobs the jealous best friend.<br>  <br>  Stephanie wrote it good. Though I think she should not of wrote Bella's pov for the first 4 stories and waited for number 5 for it to be Edwards pov. Because Edward has a great pov if you ask me.<br>  <br>  Anyway I just love everything about it. The wolves befriending them.....the Voleltri *spelling*<br>  <br>  Its not like interview with a vampire (which is a good story and movie) <br>  its more of a romance. Basically enemies falling in love. <br>  <br>  Yes I would of liked to read more 'hunting and killing scenes' BUT it is in  Bella's POV. She was not a vampire for most of the story, so we could not read it. Thats why she should of 'switched' their point of views if you ask me. Especially in book2 where the vampires are not in the story for at least 3oo pages. Which was annoying lol.<br>  <br>  anyway I'll stop rambling here. I just think its a cute story and love it.|`|5wg7tKc6aa	It's their opinion that matters, not yours... why talk down about a book they enjoy?  You wouldn't like it if they were talking down about Anne Rice and all her amazing books... who cares?  I don't understand how people can be so thoroughly disturbed about others book preference.<br>  <br>  I'm not a Twilight fan, but I am a fan of books... and even though the books not the best, the author did put time into writing it out.  I respect the audience they attract.|`|VHRkgKsDaa	It is a good and well written book. It has everything a book needs in it. Romance, Suspense, Mystery, Its Funny, and you never no what's gonna happen next. For people who haven't actually read the book and just seen the movie, Its not just "Edward and Bella in love blah blah blah" Its more then that.|`|CSysSbnlaa	The fact that Bella found Edward with all of the vampire problems is pretty cool. It's just a love story covered up by the vamire part. In truth it's just a family who meets a girl and the single ends up with her. It's pretty cool but I almost throw up at all the kissy stuff. Eww! Srry. I'm single and broken.|`|IJMyRWp4aa	true twilight isnt really realistic in the way it describes vampires and it really doesnt talk alot about actualy vampire events but its still a great book and i loved it. however i am going to look up some anne rice stuff to.|`|AA10978481	I enjoyed it because the storyline was good and creative. The characters were fairly interesting and realistic. However, I personally thought the writing style was juvenile and not all that create. It had great potential but lacked in proper execution.|`|kz0fRjlMaa	well i love twilight but i will try out the annie rice books but give twilight another change i know its kind of boring but it gets better|`|nsqGHXzeaa	Oh, my goodness. :-) I totally agree! about the twilight thing. I haven't read any anne rice books, but now i want to lol.|`|IGxHbINiaa	OMG IT'S JUST SOO ******* AMAZING I LOVE ******* TWILIGHT IT'S SOOO ******* AWESOME OMFG!!!<br>  haha jk jk I'm just trying to act like a lil whore, but seriously I like Twilight it's iight oh and I'm a dude just for y'all out there.|`|XyBT24DCaa	i don like twilight like that i jus went saw the movie cause every1 was makin a big deal off of it and i don see wat the fuss was about|`|zAN9JV4kaa	geez what is wrong with you!!<br>  <br>  twilight is ahh-mazing!! who doesn't want to read about prince charming. didn't you ever want your life to start out as a once upon a time in a faraway village..., and end with and they lived happily ever after? edward cullen isn't real ill admit it, but as a fictional character he is just beautiful.<br>  <br>  and another thing, have you looked at the book? i dont know what your reading but 550-700 page books are NOT easy reads.<br>  <br>  and hello "supposed to be" a vampire book! <br>  IT IS!!!! holy cow did you even read it!!??<br>  <br>  <br>  okay, im done ranting now|`|K5plVKsPaa	i think people like it a lot because it's a typical story, is it not? i mean the whole clumsy girl sorta' thing is kind of old.<br>  <br>  but i like twilight. i'm not one of those crazy fans you know, but i think it's a good book/series. and besides, its other people's Opinions.  you are entitled to yours and the same for everyone else.|`|nVAhRFG6aa	I ANSWER ALL/MOST OF MY QUESTION IN CAPS SO YEAH ANYWAY I LIKE IT BECAUSE IT WAS A CUTE BOOK FOR TEENS TO FANTASIZE ABOUT, AND A MOVIE PUTS IT THERE FOR YOU TO SEE. IM NOT A "LOVER" IM NOT OBSESSED I JUST LIKE IT.<br>  I THINK BELLA IS BLAND AND IN THE MOVIE SHES NOT EVEN PRETTY.  I THINK PEOPLE ARE OBSESSED BECAUSE THEY WANT IT TO HAPPEN TO THEM.|`|vXzIv8GXaa	I personally like them because its different. in most vampire books they are the cliche. fangs. coffin. allergic to garlic. etc. and also there are different levels of writing. Anne Rice is one amazing novelist. I love her books. The Twilight series is just something new because they are not cliched. It is easy to read but people do feel like they have accomplished something after reading a book that thick. it gives them confidence in some ways for others its just another book to read.|`|0hxK0khKaa	Ahahaha. Yeah, Twilight bothers me too. Want a honest-to-goodness unexpected love story? Read Lolita. 40 something man and 12 year old girl. THAT is unexpected. Read Romeo and Juliet. Their parents hate each other, and they fall for each other. THAT is unexpected.<br>  <br>  The writing is horrible...Sparkly sparkly vampires woooh! I would've liked Twilight more if Bella dumped Edward and ran off with Jacob.|`|a796jDdlaa	Well, I, personally, love the way she set the plot up. <br>  <br>  "Different strokes for different folks..." <br>  <br>  meaning, we all have our opinions..even though they're different. <br>  <br>  <br>  I like it because it's interesting. In my opinion, they are some of the best books ever written and I think they're the best books I've ever read(:|`|DTYeCKAfaa	I've read a couple of book from Anne Rice and they are awesome. I do like Twilight, however. It's a pretty good series that is entertaining to read. I do admit it's not the best literary work,but it's quite amusing.

I also like to read plays because they're short and interesting like A Streetcar Named Desire by Tennesse Williams was a great play. Do you enjoy Harry Potter? If so I'd suggest reading the series if you've never really gotten into it pick one of the more interesting of the books to grasp your attention first then once you're hooked it'll be easier to go through the first few. I read them completely out of order initially. I don't know how old you are but Chuck Palahniuk is a great writer for adults. Only a select few young adults/teens can really put up with his stuff.

The only way I can imagine Harry, Ron and Hermione winning is if they used Avada Kedavra, but again Alice and Edward would know if any of them were going to use it and be able to get out of the way before it hit. Bella might not though, since I'm not sure if her shield works against magic or just other vampires. All Alice, Edward and Bella really have to do is bite to kill them too, they barely even need their powers. So, to quote Bella, I'm betting on Alice (and Edward and Bella).|`|ee5LcXQraa	Hmmm, Harry, Ron, and Hermione are very "goodie", I really don't think they would use the killing spell.<br>  And the vampires are quicker, and stronger, if the wizards could catch them, wizards would win, but they cant use the spell that takes away their wand, they don't have wands.<br>  This could have a very deep explanation.<br>  So much I want to explain, but, don't feel like typing, just think it out!<br>  I think the vamps would win, but I like Harry Potter more, lol.|`|nsqGHXzeaa	Harry Ron and Hermione, because #1- Hermione would know all about vampires and how to defeat them, harry would be powerful in magic spells and take Hermione's advice and win it nearly by himself, and ron... well he'd at least help. <br>  <br>  Not trying to diss on twilight, but harry potter series is like ten times better. lol|`|dNGqKZQQaa	That's SO obvious.<br>  Harry, Ron, and Hermione.<br>  <br>  Nothing beats magic. Harry could just kill the sh** out of Edwad, Alice, and Bella using Avada Kedavra.<br>  <br>  Because the killing curse cannot be stopped once it's been said.|`|YEfW3vI0aa	Harry Ron and Hermione.

AA10438186	The above answers are all incorrect.  Everyone thinks lead was removed from house paint in 1978.  This is NOT ! true.

But don't you think that if the only thing we have to live for, is life itself, that we should put all our effort into it so we can have contentment when our time comes? There is a point to life and i am positive that it is just the begging of well, actually living. Either way, you will live forever. The only question is, Heaven or Hell?

The colors revert to "normal" because of a neat property of the spectrum called "complementary colors."<br>  <br>  Each of primary colors of light, red, green and blue, is complemented by cyan, magenta, and yellow, respectively.

Once you're intimidated, you're done for. Don't put your whole mind towards auditions. If you see competition, just practice more. The thing you should really do is try to have fun.

What you have is a document that airlines filed with the old INS and State of Hawaii when a flight landed in Hawaii. It was filed to declare items that might worry the health department or INS, such as the names of crew members on an airliner or military flight. NASA had to file the document because Armstrong, Aldrin and Collins were taken to Honolulu after they were picked up in the ocean and they brought their payload of moon rocks (a public health interest) onto the island. Your mom did take something important and I'm sure you won't get in trouble for having it. But it would be interesting to hear how she came to holding the document.

I eventually get to point where I don't count and I just do what feels right when it feels right. <br>  <br>  Try this simple technique:<br>  <br>  Pick a count in the choreography where you know you'll be in a particular pose something easy. Make sure that when you dance no matter how lost you get you hit that one count. Try this for places where its easiest to remember the choreography.<br>  <br>  Another technique is to use sound effects. I've taken several dance classes from professional teachers in New York and you'd be surprised how many of them mess up counts or don't use them at all.

mgB9MGBHaa	If you want something mystical and if it's okay if it's a one act, try Limbo by Jerome McDonough. It's an extremely interesting play that takes place when a group of totally unrelated people suddenly find themselves in a "limbo" place so to speak, and they each try to find their way out and end up heading out different doors in the end - one is obviously some sort of "hell" and at the very end the most likable character in the play heads out an opposite door which is obviously some sort of "heaven." the rest of the characters head each out different doors - it is up to the audience to figure out where they went. Separate from them are the Gravediggers, who have a constant air of knowing more than they let on. Each are in their sort of separate reality. It's kind of a philosophical play, but it's very, very interesting and engaging. It will make you think for a long time afterward.

wEEOvu5Waa	I agree with a lot of the posts here. You want to keep your Vamps original, but still in the guidelines of what a Vampire has been based on for centuries.<br>  <br>  Stay away from what Twilight has done to vampires. Shinny vamps who make babies? Yea, stay away from stuff Twilight has done.<br>  <br>  Personally, I think there should be more Vampires like how Anne Rice portrays them. Go for a good old fashioned adult Vampire book. Make the vampires vampires! They thirst for human blood, they adore the feeling of life pumping out from their victim. Not this "I only eat animals" crap.<br>  <br>  They -are- strong, no doubt. But they dont have special mind powers. Turning into mist is an ancient aspect though. You can always give your Vamps a bit of a kick to make them special, but nothing to outragous. Give them that terryifying, yet beautifuly cold deamener of a predator.<br>  <br>  God, now I want to read some Anne Rice >.>|`|cxip3nA8aa	I would say: "You can't write at all, go take lessons from Jk Rowling"|`|dXW9cPWMaa	From what I read on agent and editor blogs, the Paranormal genre, especially Paranormal Romance, is very, very red-hot right now (obviously). However, they don't want the same shtick they've been getting for a few years now - several very popular vampire books have completely worn that one out.<br>  <br>  My advice? Make it fresh and original. Think of new scenarios in which to put these vampires. Make them different, but retain the fundamentals of vampire lore - as much as people complain, a certain famous author of vampire books did basically stick to the lore. She just found other ways to explain some things (i.e. coming out in the daylight).<br>  <br>  There is so much that can be done that has not yet been tapped. Aspiring writers need to just open their minds further and move outside the realm of what's been done.|`|AA11327241	Stick to real vampire lore defined by the master, Brams Stoker.<br>  Many of the more recent vampire tales are full of made up crap. I read a story in which the hero vampire used sunblock will protect himself from the sunlight. Sun block doesn't protect humans how can it protect vampires? <br>  <br>  That scene killed the whole story for me. I'll bet you didn't know that besides garlic, roses are also poisonous to vampires? I can think of several way to use that little known fact in a vampire tale, especially in a tale of lovers. How about you?<br>  <br>  Being a vampire is interesting enough. Go back to the original roots of the genre, explore the limits of what vampires can and can not do and force yourself to write within those boundaries. Your stories and characters will be more believable and you will become a better writer in the long run.|`|WshwHtk9aa	BE ORIGINAL.<br>  <br>  Please.<br>  <br>  No more teen vampires.<br>  No more "vegetarian" vampires.<br>  No more all-happy endings in vampire stories.<br>  No more sparkling.<br>  No more special powers per vampire.<br>  No more weird vampires names (like Spike or Vintage or Bloodwilde or Kane). <br>  No more first person angsty impressions of what the transition feels like.<br>  No more people trying to escape their happy lives to pursue a forbidden vampire love.<br>  No more werewolf wars.<br>  No more werewolf friends.<br>  No more vampire babies.<br>  <br>  Just, for the love of God, be original.|`|vrcxxRr8aa	Stick to the vampire lore, that's what makes vampires what they are. Avoid things like sparkles. An original twist or two is okay, as long as it still leaves the vampires vulnerable and doesn't completely destroy vampire lore.|`|7KcVSB3Uaa	My advice would be:<br>  <br>  1: Try reading another book first. There are others out there...<br>  <br>  2: Don't write your own book based on the fact that you simply don't want Twilight to end.|`|532LT9C7aa	I would say "do your homework." Don't just read the "book-which-shall-not-be-named." Read Bram Stoker's Dracula, and Interview with a Vampire, and everything in between you can get your hands on. Sift through everything that's been done and come up with a new angle. To work, your story has to provide the genre with some sort of innovation, otherwise it's just more of the same. <br>  <br>  And then, once you've come up with your "angle" of how your story and vampires would be different, really think about the characters and what their stories ARE before you sit down to write. It doesn't matter if you have tons of action and blood and romance, if you don't have believable characters that elicit true responses. The reader either needs to care about the characters, hate the characters, or be afraid of them. But one way or another, they have to be emotionally connected or the story is just words on a page.|`|8DwxwhStaa	Write a good old fashioned, cursed, can be killed by holy stuff and stakes, turn into mist and animals, can't see their reflection vampires and add a twist.

Make me wet my knickers and turn the lights on when I read about vampires.|`|Xc02z608aa	I'd tell them that if they choose to write a story involving vampires, to not make vampires the central theme.

rT22hTL0aa	The quick simple version: <br>        An evil sorcerer has turned a bunch of girls into swans and their parents' tears have fromed a lake (this is Swan Lake).  A prince (who has just turned 21 and has to be married soon) finds the lake, learns about the spell from the Swan Queen (named Odette), and tries to break the spell (the spell can only be broken if a man vows his undying love to her).  The sorcerer tries to stop him and trick him.  They battle.   In the end the prince vows his love to the Swan Queen (Odette) and he breaks the curse.<br>  <br>  The more detailed verison:<br>  Okay, basically there is a prince named Siegfried, who has just turned 21, and will soon be married (arranged marriage).  Aware of the responsibilites that will soon be thrust upon him, he takes to the woods with his hunting buddies for kind-of a bachelor night out.  Siegfried gets ahead of the hunting group and arrives (by himself) at a peaceful lake with several swans in it, and one swan wears a crown.  an evil sorcerer, Von Rothbart (who is disguised as Siegfried's mentor) has turned girls into swans, and the lake is made up of the tears of their crying parents.  The only way the spell could be broken is if a man, pure in heart, pledges his love to her.  The prince attempts to do so, but the evil sorcerer, of course, keeps him from being able to do so by making the swans (magically) dance on the lake and shore.  Then the evil sorcerer makes his daughter look like the swan girl from Swan Lake and tricks Siegfried into professing his love for her.  However, the real Swan Princess (Odette is her name) is there, the prince sees her and realizing he's been tricked.  But Odette (the swan princess) heard him pledge his love to the other girl and so she runs back to the lake upset.  The prince runs after Odette and explains what happens.  The sorcerer insists the prince must marry his daughter.  There is a battle between the prince and the sorcerer.  The prince vows his love to Odette and takes her hand and they jump into the lake together and the spell is broken.  Their spirits ascend to the heavens (apparently they die when they jump into the lake).<br>  <br>  Note: Many different endings exist, ranging from romantic to tragic:  (from <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swan_Lake#Synopsis)" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swan_Lake#S...</a><br>  In a version which has an ending very close to the original danced by American Ballet Theatre in 2005, Siegfried's mistaken pledge of fidelity to Odile consigns Odette to eternal swanhood. Realizing that her last moment of humanity is at hand, Odette commits suicide by throwing herself into the lake. The Prince does so as well. This act of sacrifice and love breaks von Rothbart's power, and he is destroyed. In the final tableau, the lovers are seen rising together to heaven in apotheosis. <br>  In a version danced by the Mariinsky Ballet in 2006, the true love between Siegfried and Odette defeats von Rothbart, who dies after the prince breaks one of his wings. Odette is restored to human form to unite happily with the prince. This version has often been used by Russian and Chinese ballet companies. <br>  In a version danced by New York City Ballet in 2006 (with choreography by Peter Martins after Lev Ivanov, Marius Petipa, and George Balanchine), the Prince's declaration that he wishes to marry Odile constitutes a betrayal that condemns Odette to remain a swan forever. Odette is called away into swan form, and Siegfried is left alone in grief as the curtain falls.

Little is known about the job in the community, only that it is supred-dee-duperty important. In the society, nobody sees color, they all dress the same depending on the age group, and they are all given jobs by year 12. Jonas  (the reciever) gets 'training' from The Giver, an old man on the board of elders. He gives Jonas the memories of pain.pleasure,warmth,family,death,and color (something the rest of the community can't see) and yeah... Also they get 'released' if they are defective and unfit in the society. Getting released means getting a shot in the arm that kills you. Blech. It was a good book though. And Jonas wants everyone else in the society to FEEL and SEE colors and BE themselves and yadaaa yadda so he runs away so the memories can be given back to the society.....yeah|`|fEaNKJ92aa	its about a world without color and stuff and they all have certain jobs and things. well this bot, jonah is his name i think, gets assigned giver. this old man is the towns giver and jonah becomes his apprentice in a way and he puts his hands onto jonas' back and gives him thoughts and/or memories of colors and music and things jonah has never seen and it just carries on with konah seeing his world differently but the end isnt really that weird|`|7aZUa6fMaa	perfect world... you aren't you leave (they kill you)... the world is gray|`|B2bDFFolaa	Basically these people live in a world where the government controls their whole lives and they gave strict guidelines of what they wear and learn for each grade level they go through.

When the ceremony comes, Jonas learns that he has been selected for the Assignment of Receiver of Memory, which means that he will receive all of the memories of the world before they converted to Sameness.

The most obvious is the fact it is a painting by  Leonardo Da Vinci.  The facts surrounding his relationship with the painting and the mystery of the woman herself remain intriguing to all who love the art of the Renaissance.  Leonardo worked on Mona for about four years.  He often carried the painting with him when he traveled. Mona was reputed to be the wife of a rich merchant. She is represented in both a curious and repulsive manner by today's standards.  There have been suggestions she is a man or that it is Leonardo himself. There has been some alterations to the original.  She was once sitting on  a balcony.  Now there is just the classical landscape, typical of these types of portraits, but time has faded it and made it seem like some eerie underwater space. She has been parodied so often that it is impossible for us to see her with a fresh eye.  However, to stand in front of her, encased in a bullet proof  glass enclosure usually explains why she is so special.|`|yvHUAHZQaa	It a that it is such an old painting and also the artist who painted it.

Maybe 90 trillion?|`|YorMkZYAaa	*shakes head*<br>  <br>  This is not something that is done "fast" my dear. I am guessing you never bothered with research let alone anything else involving your manuscript. Is it edited? Polished to perfection? If not, you still have a hell of a lot of work to do. And considering your sentence structure in the main question alone, I suspect your manuscript is definitely not up to snuff.<br>  <br>  Pick up a copy of "The Writer's Market" and get to your research. You are going to need to do your homework on agents and publishers who handle children's book. Search submission guidelines, format, how to write a query letter, how to handle editing, and so forth. If you are impatient and don't or won't take the proper effort to go with the traditional route (which; by the way, should never cost you a dime), then you are in no position to publish.<br>  <br>  You theoretically can go the route of self-publishing and drop hundreds, if not thousands of dollars on something that will amount to very few sales outside friends and family. Self-publishing does not make you a published author. It just makes you another writer with an ego that's too big or a complete lack of patience, discipline, and commitment. There are some exceptions, but very few.<br>  <br>  Do your manuscript a favor and invest the time, energy, and dedication to proper research and submission.

Publishing packages are very affordable and investing on getting your book published is a good start.<br>  <br>  Most self-publishing companies have programs that costs about $250 to $12999 and is highly dependent on the kind of services that you will be getting which is why it is very significant to carefully map out your book's budget as early as now.<br>  <br>  Publishing companies now have all the resources to publish books with the same productivity and efficacy as that of regular black and white books. Considering the fact that most books are in full color, you should choose a publishing company whose book’s are of the highest quality, bar none.<br>  <br>  Xlibris Publishing is one of those companies who truly boasts of their book’s top quality as your book is printed on acid-free 50lb library-edition paper. That alone can give your book a longer shelf life and durable pages.<br>  <br>  Self-publishing entirely means that you get to retain full control of your book’s production and that it gives you the option to publish your work and claim authority of the photos that you have chosen to be published.<br>  <br>  Publishing is synonymous to getting that copyright for protecting your book which is why it is highly important to publish it.<br>  <br>  You can get free information sent to your mail here and even try to check the quality of their brochure because it is the same as how they publish books.

But the wealthy Fitzgeralds who live at Ballygrace have little time for village girls, until Madeleine, their unstable, delicate daughter, meets Tara. Tara is everything Madeleine isn't, yet the two girls find themselves becoming firm friends. When Tara meets Gabriel, Madeleine's older brother, she becomes painfully aware of the differences between the Fitzgeralds and the Flynns.

But, ever since Ever was in a car accident which killed her parents and sister, she could hear people's thoughts, see auras, and a person's life story just from touching someone. Thinking she's crazy, she tries to shut herself out from everyone by becoming an outcast at school. But everything changes when she meets Damen Auguste. Ever sees Damen and feels an instant recognition. He is gorgeous, exotic and wealthy, and he holds many secrets. Damen is able to make things appear and disappear, he always seems to know what she’s thinking—and he’s the only one who can silence the noise and the random energy in her head. She doesn’t know who he really is—or what he is. Can she trust him?<br>  <br>  Uglies series by Scott Westerfeld<br>  It's hard to explain but it's about the future, after mankind basically destroyed the earth (global warming, destroying forests, polluting, etc) survivors made a new society where there's no argueing, war, etc. Everyone is considered "ugly" until they turn 16 and have this sugery that makes them "pretty" and they move to this part of town where all they do is have fun and party all day and night. Tally cant wait to turn pretty. She meets Shay who's a rebal and convinces Tally to leave the city for a night to see what's out in the wilderness. Tally learns all kinds of things about being pretty and the truth is.. it's not really pretty. EXTREMELY good, and the sequals are even better. It's full of adventures, cool technologies, romance, etc. <br>  <br>  The Hunger Games by Suzanne Collins<br>  This book is also set in the future and gets pretty intense. It's setting is in Panem, a city that's now in what's left of North America (which has become smaller after global warming and melting of the ice caps). Surrounding Panem are 12 districts where each year, one boy and girl between the ages of 12 and 18 are chosen to be in the Hunger Games where they are put into an arena and battle each other and try to survive until there's only one left and is the winner. There's also some romance in it. One of my favorite books<br>  <br>  Deadly Little Secrets by Laurie Stolarz<br>  It's the first of it's series and is also really good. It's about a girl named Camelia who lives a normal life - dating, has friends, decent grades. But, one day when she was picking an earing that she dropped crossing the street, a car was coming towards her and it wasn't stopping. Suddenly, a hot guy shoves her out of the way, saving her life. He left without her saying thank you or asking what his name was. Three months later, she's starting her junior year in high school and there's this rumor about a new guy named Ben who supposedly killed his girlfriend. Camelia doesn't believe in rumors and when she sees Ben, it's the guy who saved her life. She tries to talk to him but he ignores her at first, but later Ben begins touching her weirdly but Camilia only gets more drawn to him. She later finds out he's not ordinary. He can know the future or past of a person by touching a person and he senses that Camelia's in great danger. Really intense but good with a twisted love triangle.<br>  <br>  Kissed by an Angel by Elizabeth Chandler<br>  Well, it's kind of three books in one. It's suppose to be about this guy, Tristian, and this girl, Ivy, who are crazy about each other. Ivy also has this strong belief in angels (like a water angel, a death angel, etc) which Tristian doesn't believe at all. But one day, they get in a car accident and Tristian dies and Ivy's belief in angels die with him and Ivy feels as if she has lossed everything. But, Tristian is still there, protecting her as an angel. But the problem is, Ivy keeps doubting about angels so no matter what Tristian does to try to help her, he hurts her more and Ivy feels more alone. Tristian soon realizes that their car accident wasn't an accident and whoever killed Tristian is trying to kill Ivy but can he save her im time?|`|wDigwK2maa	I really love Pygmalion by George Bernard Shaw and The Time Machine by H.G.

Not only is the content easy to read and understand, but the author has written exactly right about why women and men collide.<br>  <br>  Please read:<br>  <br>  Being equal does not mean that we have to be the same right? <br>  <br>  Just as women and men should not have to change themselves to be respected and appreciated. Being equal does not mean men and women are the same or should be the same.<br>  <br>  This sounds good, but there is another point of view. Just as women want men to change, men want women not to change. As men cling to old expectations, women are creating new expectations that are equally unrealistic. To various degress, women want a symphathetic partner, eager to talk about the stresses of the day, who will share all the domestic responsibilities and duties. She also wants her partner to be attentive and romantic for her pleasure after solving many problems and emergencies. Most men appreciate a beautiful and orderly home and simply relax. As men cling to old expectations women are creating new expectations.<br>  <br>  A man loses interest when he senses that he can't continue to meet a woman's expectation. He may try for years, but eventually he runs out of steam. When this is the case, a man may suddenly lose interest and not even know why. He is not interested in her, not she's not right for him, but because he is trying to meet unrealistic expectation.<br>  <br>  Men and women don't complain about their partners when they are feeling good. The problem is never just our partner, but our inability to how we can deal with our partner more effectively. Instead of becoming more sensitive, men need to become sensitive to the needs of women.<br>  <br>  On the other hand when a woman displays sensitivity with appreaciation and trust for a man's support, it dramatically increasees his love and sexual interest in her. A woman's sensitivity, which gives her the ability to appreciate the little things in life, is a major turn on to men.<br>  <br>  By: John Gray..|`|R8NY6pDgaa	Yeah...I just read A Thousand Splendid Suns.

By Teresa Medeiros <br>  <br>  Description:<br>  Once, as a girl of seventeen, beautiful, headstrong Portia Cabot saved the cursed life of the dashing vampire Julian Kane—who marked her forever, then left to go in search of his soul. He returns five years later to find the enchanting young girl he left behind grown into a bewitching woman with a woman's heart . . . and a woman's desires.<br>  <br>  Portia quickly discovers that Julian's seductive and forbidden kiss can still make her crave the night . . . and his touch. But the Julian who has returned to London is not the vampire she remembers. His fruitless pursuit of his stolen mortality has reduced him to drunken debauchery. And a recent spate of murders makes Portia fear that the man she has always adored may truly be a monster.<br>  <br>  Julian knows he must drive Portia away—but his passion and hunger for her grow more irresistible every time they touch. For years he has fought the temptation to embrace his dark gifts, never realizing that Portia's love may give him the most dangerous gift of all . . . a reason to live.|`|aeODdMATaa	Vampire Academy<br>  Vampire Diaries|`|d6ANFdZ8aa	Dracula- Bram Stoker<br>  Books by Anne Rice<br>  The Darren Shan books.<br>  :)|`|0cCZkuBOaa	New Moon<br>  Eclipse<br>  Breaking Dawn<br>  <br>  New Book coming out: Midnight Sun|`|Yo3awDQmaa	These are my personal recommendations for books:<br>  (You can find my personal opinion of the one’s I’ve read at my blog CasCanRead.com)<br>  <br>  The House of Night series---It knocked me straight out of my Twilight obsession. Even though I am still hyped about the DVD and New Moon movie. The ending of the last book drove me nuts and I can't wait to find out what happens next.<br>   <br>  Vampire Academy series--I just finished this and I can't wait for the next one! It was awesome and totally made me cry like a million time and make me angry. It sure does keep you on your toes.<br>  <br>  Society of S—This book is very interesting. I believe it may be an adult book, but I’m not sure. It’s about a thirteen year old girl, but her vocabulary and English is advanced. It’s a good read though.<br>  <br>  The Morganville Vampire series—This series is pure amazingness. Love, Love, Love it! It’s really at a tie with House of Night with amazingness.<br>  <br>  Peeps—very interesting (in a guys point of view.)<br>  <br>  Someone Like You by Sarah Dessen—awesome book!<br>  <br>  The Gallagher Girls series is interesting...It's about a girl that goes to spy school. The first book is "I'd tell you I love you, but then I'd have to kill you".<br>  <br>  The two books I actually enjoyed reading in school were Speak and Holes. Speak is a really good book.<br>  <br>  A few other books I have read recently and enjoyed are: Kissing Kate, The Bermudez Triangle, and Empress of the World.<br>  <br>  Vampire Chronicles by Anne Rice.<br>  <br>  Some series that others have told me to read that are in the Young Adult/ Supernatural genre are: The Mortal Instruments series, Darkest Powers series,  Maxium Ride, Vampire Kisses series, The Vampire Diaries, The Uglies series, Chronicles of Narnia, Blue Bloods, Sookie Stackhouse series, and Sweep series.<br>  <br>  <br>  Then these more classical books: anything Jane Austen, To Kill a Mockingbird, Wuthering Heights, Great Expectations, Jane Eyre, Little Women, Odyssey, The Scarlet Letter, and Treasure Island. All of those are part of Barnes and Nobles Classic Collection.<br>  <br>  Any of these books listed can be found on Barnes and Noble to know what they are about.|`|qThmcR1Aaa	If you've read "Twilight," honestly, you haven't read any good vampire books. You read a poorly written teen romance novel.<br>  <br>  Start with Anne Rice's Vampire Chronicles. Or you could go back to the start, with Bram Stoker's "Dracula." Always a classic.<br>  <br>  My wife just recently finished the "Sookie Stackhouse" Southern Vampire series, by Charlane Harris. She enjoyed those quite a bit.

5MW9hfFnaa	The revolution would have happened although the start or fuse would have taken alot longer with out those gentlemen. Half the reason the The Continental Congress started and families began splitting up was because of their literature and with the split gave the Continental Army the man power it so desperately needed.|`|v6AFCH7uaa	The ideas of the Enlightenment and especially John Locke were extremely influential during the American Revolution. The idea that the right to govern came from the consent of the people, and that the state existed to protect certain inalienable rights and property made a huge impact in Europe and even more so in America. In fact, many Enlightenment thinkers believed that the American Revolution was the fruition of the ideals of the Enlightenment. The ideas of the philosophes (particular group of thinkers during the Enlightenment in which Locke was one of them) crossed the Atlantic and influenced the educated Americans, particularly Thomas Jefferson as he wrote the Declaration of Independence. The colonists also already had a highly idealized understanding of English liberties before 1776.  The colonists had come to expect representative government, trial by jury, and protection from unlawful imprisonment. So when King George levied taxes to pay for England's victory in the Seven Year War, the colonists regarded this as tyranny. Under the influence of Locke's theory, they justified rebellion because the people had the right "to alter or abolish" a government that deprives them of their "inalienable rights."  As for Hobbes, he was in support of enlightened despotism or the authority of one sovereign being, as opposed to a representative democracy, so I don't think Hobbes was as influential in the American Revolution.
D9x1QSgiaa	I recommend to anyone seriously contemplating the purchase of a new digital SLR camera to consider these two primary questions:<br>  <br>  1. How much money do you have to spend????<br>  <br>  2. What level of photography do you aspire to "progress to" in the coming years ? (i.e. basic beginner, intermediate, or professional/business use). <br>  <br>  For most beginners to intermediates I usually suggest one of these two manufacturers: Canon vs Nikon<br>  <br>  1. Canon EOS Rebel model XSi. (Also known as the Canon 450D in Britain) <br>  The "kit" package comes with an 18-55mm zoom lens. The camera has pop-up flash, 12.2 Megapixels, and shutter speeds up to 1/4000th, 100-1,600 ISO sensitivity, 7 autoexposure Scene modes, PLUS Shutter Priority, Aperature Priority and Programmed Exposure Modes and Manual. It also has a 3 inch LCD screen, 3.5 frames continous per second max., 9 point AF system, Live View Functioning and the ability to record photos in 3, 6 or 12 Megapixels PLUS numerous other great features found only on more expensive cameras. Wal-Mart is also selling them now for about $799. Sam's Club also has them for $729.<br>  <br>  I bought one of these 6 months ago and use it as my "back up" camera. I absolutely love it. I have gotten some fantastic photos with it and cannot praise it enough. I routinely enlarge my photos to make 8x10's and 11x14 size enlargements with no noticeable distortion or loss of detail in the pictures. <br>  <br>  2. Nikon D-90: If you prefer to use Nikon equipment I strongly recommend the Nikon D-90 which has 12.3 Megapixels, 3 inch monitor with Live View, 200-3,200 ISO sensitivity, 11 point AF system with Face Priority, 4.5 frames per second in continous mode, 5 advanced Scene modes for auto exposure plus Shutter Priority, Aperature Priority, Programmed Auto plus Manual. The D-90 sells for around $900-950. (Body ONLY. The 18-55mm lens cost an additional $150.-175.) Typically, Nikon equipment is slightly more expensive than Canon equipment, but (having owned both Nikon and Canon cameras), I have seldom noticed BETTER quality results using Nikon equipment. <br>  <br>  You might also consider the Nikon D-40 ($499) kit that comes with the 18-55mm lens. <br>  Another great choice is the Nikon D-60 kit ($649) which also comes with the 18-55mm lens. <br>  <br>  These selections are probably the best choices for any beginner to intermediate skill level, offering the most lenses and other accessories, dealers and places to purchase.<br>  <br>  I strongly recommend that ALL beginners buy a good book on digital photography AND take a class or two from a Vocational school or Community Education Center in your area. <br>  <br>  You can learn more about the technical specifications of each of these two cameras at these websites:<br>  <br>  www.usa.canon.com<br>  www.nikonusa.com<br>  <br>  Good Luck|`|BwPmFhkxaa	Are you wanting an SLR or a point and shoot??  My guess is that you want an SLR.  I would recommend Nikon, personally, because that's what I've been shooting.  I have a D90 right now and I've also owned a D40.  The D40 fits your criteria as being a great camera that's fairly inexpensive.|`|DSZTruuqaa	Okay, you need a digital slr.  The price is a little higher, but there are some really affordable options.  Try the Canon rebel.  Good lenses and affordable body.  It is pretty user friendly and it can withstand a bit of a beating :)<br>  Enjoy!<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.usa.canon.com/consumer/controller?act=ModelInfoAct&fcategoryid=139&modelid=9430" rel="nofollow">http://www.usa.canon.com/consumer/contro...</a>|`|iL1tYfJMaa	based on your description, the camera will be at least a canon 40D or Nikon d90...both will be well over 1000 bucks....not something you are going to be dropping !!!!|`|bocePfyYaa	First of all, a DSLR can take normal use. But if you drop it, you are going to break it. It is a precision instrument. The lenses contain glass. If you drop a DSLR with the lens attached, you run the risk of breaking the camera or the lens or the lens mount and possibly all three. Most, if not all cameras come with a strap-DSLRs come with a neck strap and most P&S come with at least a wrist strap. I bought a hand grip strap to use as well with my a700.<br>  <br>  You don't say which features are the most important and you don't mention an exact budget, so it is hard to tell you what might be the best camera for you at this time. So I will give my recommendation based on what I would use like everyone else will.<br>  <br>  As to getting something cheap-you generally get what you pay for. I can't imagine not being required to have an SLR or some kind of camera with manual control for a photojournalism class. So if 35mm isn't required and is out of the question for you, the least I have seen a DSLR new is $500 (Sony a200 with 18-70mm lens). If your budget is lower you will have to look into a used DSLR. Craigslist would be the ideal way to buy a used DSLR because you can handle it and check it out before you buy. But you could get a good deal on ebay if you are careful and patient.<br>  <br>  If you insist on a new DSLR, and I can understand why you would, and if you can afford about $600, I would say go with the Sony a200 with the 18-70mm and 55-200mm (or the 75-300mm) two lens kit for $550 from B&H. No sales tax for non-NY residents and free shipping on most DSLRs. Then add a 4GB Kingston 266x compact flash card for $22.50 and a medium sized camera bag for about $25. You have everything you need to get started for right at $600. As you go, you can add an external flash and nicer lenses. <br>  <br>  As to the Sony a200, it is 10.2MP-much more than enough for a beginning SLR-and has an ISO range from 100-3200, 3fps, self timer and is wireless off-camera flash capable. Sony has also built the stabilization into the body rather than the lenses so even the kit lenses are stabilized. Even the Konica Minolta lenses you can find for a good deal are stabilized. And, even Tamron, Sigma, and Tokina lenses in the a-mount are stabilized. It would be a great camera for your first DSLR.<br>  <br>  Others will say that there aren't very many Sony lenses. This is true. There are about 25 different lenses with the Sony name on them. But there are many older Minolta lenses and there are also Tamron and Sigma making lenses for Sony cameras. Sony has only been in the DSLR business since they took over Minolta in 2004. This means they have released about 25 lenses over the last four years. That is a lot of lenses for that amount of time. And they have some really nice lenses, such as the G lenses and the Carl Zeiss lenses. But there are many other gems from Minolta, Tokina, Sigma and Tamron.<br>  <br>  I switched from a 35mm Canon to a Sony a700 very recently and I also have a Minolta Maxxum (older 35mm SLR) and I really love them. I spent a long time researching before I chose Sony and the a700. Choosing a DSLR is something you need to put time and thought into. And it is expensive no matter which brand you go with and no matter what your intentions.|`|35f126768433fb7bc9a5037cf6657dbcaa	i've had my olympus e-500 for a few years...it's still shooting well.

Find the return key on your keyboard, and don't let your sentences and ideas run on and into each other.  Edit and rewrite.  Cut out the filler.
kgNlSNLqaa	Honestly, it sounds a bit too cheesy. You could convey a very dramatic mood without using the so very cliche phrase "slit your wrists". Usually the best poems are those which do not directly use the theme word. Example: I have read many poems about love, yet not once was the actual word "love" written in it. This just sounds like a typical high school poem that one of those self proclaimed "goths" would compose. Don't get me wrong, though. This has potential, but the omnipresent gore gets old. Space it out. That could even make a gereater impact on your audience. Also, much of the rhyming and vocabulary is fairly elementary. I'm not saying that a poem is "bad" if it doesn't have slightly more advanced wording, but again, this sounds too sad little high schooler who would like to gain some attention. Look at Poe's works. His short stories are not line after line blood and gore. He builds up, creating that final suspense. He also limits dialogue. Many of his pieces spend pages of solid information. In your poem, you use frequent dialogue. Instead of writing out what someone is saying, you could describe the situation to decrease the corny level. i.e. (pure example) "I felt my body weaken by the numbness which washed through me, as he lifted his saber still crimson with fresh blood..."

You can get away with a gambler in Guys and Dolls for the dance sequences or as the "Curly" in the Dream Ballet|`|TcNXsLJ4aa	I think it depends on the role, and the actress.<br>  Also, it's better to have a gender switch like that as an interesting twist instead of just because not enough guys tried out.|`|draNVjbkaa	In the John Doyle version of Sweeney Todd (this is the version where the actors not only sing but play multiple instruments), Pirelli the Barber is played by a woman. Part of the reason that Pirelli is now cast as a woman in this version was because they originally couldn't find a guy that could both play accordian (Pirelli's instrument in the Doyle version) and sing really high.<br>  <br>  So yes, it is possible for women to have roles that are traditionally guy parts.|`|BzMQejGxaa	Would be harder as you'd need the voice, surely, to sing the songs?

I've also known some considered a "genius" in their field.  IQ geniuses tend to take the world with a certain amount of bemusement. Many are socially retarded and really don't have that much experience with the avg Joe. They are lost in their pursuits and uncomfortable in the mundane world. Those with social skills are usually far too busy to worry about what other people are doing. <br>  <br>  When it comes to "geniues" in their field, those people are infuriated to no end with people, especially those in the same field. <br>  <br>  In reality each of us has our talents and abilities. Some are valued more in society than others. Historically those talents have changed.

However, they may not function well in most others. Now, we move to genius, this characteristic may be applied to a person with superior ability on one area or many. Do you see the connection? The big difference is the overall IQ. Generally, a genius is strong enough to rank very high in IQ, but not always. Now, having presented two spectrum's, let me say this. There are more people in this world that fall in these categories than you can imagine. If a person is smart enough they will use their gift while regarding societies limitations. Most of us are gifted in one area or another.

BwPmFhkxaa	Yes, you can.  All colors are derived from Red, Yellow, and Blue.  Mix 2 of them together.  If it's not strong enough, add more of the brighter color.  It might take some experimenting but it is possible.
WxAjSjj2aa	There is no real set amount of time that it takes to reach your splits. It's a combination of natural flexibility (which is somewhat connected to your height, shorter is usually more naturally flexible) and the time you invest in working on it.<br>  <br>  One easy technique is to sit in the splits (as close as you can get to them)  while watching TV or reading a book. It'll help get your mind off of it and watching TV usually passes the time so instead of sitting there bored for 10 minutes in pain, you'd kind of have your mind off of the pain for 30 minutes of a stretch (and switch front legs each commercial).<br>  <br>  If you do this a lot (and by that i mean possibly hours a day) then you'll get your splits pretty quickly actually. Say, a short number of months (this is assumption, it could be much much shorter but i highly doubt it's any longer). Sadly there is no quick way to get splits in a week, if there was I'd be using it right now.<br>  <br>  Oh, and don't worry, you can still sit there with popcorn or something, just anything you can normally do sitting you can do in the splits.<br>  <br>  This isn't really anything that you NEED to do every time when you watch TV, i don't have the initiative to actually do it every time either but if I did i could have had my splits by now. But I'm not that serious of a dancer, if you are then i suggest trying to get it whenever you have free time (maybe when doing homework)|`|SnqsDt1Caa	i am stretching right now on my left but my right i got it down in 1 day =] iv been stretching alll say but its worth it|`|aKqWOEoPaa	There is no set time. It is different for everyone. For some people, they cna do the splits without even warming up, let alone practicing it over weeks, months or years. Take my mum for example. She is 51, the only exercise she gets is some walking here and there. She can basically do the splits, because we are naturally flexible. (I think it has to do with the length of your hamstrings) Other people don't have that flexibility. Some can work at it to eventually reach the splits while others never will. It all depends on your body.|`|G73jI8QSaa	It depends how much you want it really.<br>  It takes some people years to get a split by working hard.<br>  My dance teacher... when she was a student, her teacher told her she had to have her right split be the end of the year. She had all 3 in a month.<br>  <br>  Just keep practicing your splits. You have to hold it for at least a minute to get a good stretch. Try sitting in your splits while doing mindless things like reading, using a laptop, watching tv... sit in your stradle while doing homework.|`|dC7nixE6aa	Depends on how much effort you put into it!!  You should at least everyday try to work on it, stretching really helps!!  It's worth it because it took me 2 weeks of stretching and finally i could do it!|`|G2mJppm0aa	You aren't 'Learning'. <br>  <br>  You are practicing. While Watching TV, just stretch out your legs, and after three weeks or so of doing that, you should be able to do it. <br>  <br>  Also make sure your legs are warm.|`|9j4RX7vYaa	you don't learn to do the splits. being able to do the splits is flexibility. what you should do is to go in the splits position as far as you can take the stretch. hold that position for bout 30 seconds and do that once  day.

I attended HB which deliberately keeps their fees toward the low end of the scale.  Uta Hagen firmly believed that there should always be a place where actors could study and practice their craft without paying an arm and a leg for it.

Mother earth has no husband, mother lode has no mate, and mother vinegar has no apple juice. (just kidding about that last one) We are using characteristics that indicate a power that creates or gives birth. I am sure you can think of a lot of human words that we use to represent an action. Have you ever seen father time?  OK, you made my day, a play on words is what I live for. I write for a living and love every word in the world and how we connect them makes all the different in the universe. (see the metaphors here)|`|AA11818873	Our "ability to recognise" that there is a necessity!<br>  Once our perception is that much deep enough, then ideas will take birth, abilities will accrue and the rest will happen!<br>  There was a 'need' to build a dam, even thousands of years ago. We had to wait till somebody recognised the 'need' to do something about that needless loss of life during floods each year, and then the famine during summer. That recognition gave birth to inventing the concept of building a dam. Till that time, men thought the river is too big for us to handle! Sky is too far for us to reach. No air to breathe, and then the gravity. Bah! Waste of time to think about things beyond our reach. Easier to simply 'resign' to "fate".<br>  <br>  Sorry to lengthen this answer with the following ‘after-thought’…<br>  But I felt that adding something of personal experience would make the answer a bit more ‘credible’ ( So, I am not a big person, nor am I capable of any big invention).<br>  During my early days as a Bank Clerk, I “saw” the need to accommodate the category of depositors who could not assure a ‘regular’ amount for monthly savings into that Recurring Deposit Scheme. However, they could manage some minimum amount. What about that irregular extra amount? So I did not wait for any flexibility in that “fixed” monthly instalment. Also, personally I disliked the charges for any inability to pay a particular instalment in time being called as a “penalty”. How can a depositor be ‘penalised’ ever. In a practical sense, the depositor is the lender and the bank his/her borrower, with better sense of responsibility, trustworthiness etc.<br>  So, I quietly asked such depositors to open several Recurring Deposit accounts for smaller instalments. That way, most of the accounts do not suffer any charges (that stupid ‘penalty for ‘default’ ), and just some of the accounts would yield a lesser maturity value. But the depositor would have definitely ended up saving a larger amount than that single rigid-fixed-instalment-commitment!<br>  Years later, some banks have now thought of allowing prepayment of later instalments to offset delay in earlier ones, to avoid those “penalty”. Yet another bank has now allowed just the kid’s RD accounts with flexible instalments ( as if these computers would protest calculating irregular instalments of other accounts!).|`|otWYoMgdaa	Necessity may be the mother of invention, it’s true, but its father is creativity and knowledge is the midwife.’|`|L5S6rpI7aa	A childish question.

These children's adolescent sexual impulses will be stifled with specially prescribed drugs; at age 12 they will receive an appropriate career assignment, sensibly chosen by the community's Elders. This is a world in which the old live in group homes and are "released"--to great celebration--at the proper time; the few infants who do not develop according to schedule are also "released," but with no fanfare. Lowry's development of this civilization is so deft that her readers, like the community's citizens, will be easily seduced by the chimera of this ordered, pain-free society. Until the time that Jonah begins training for his job assignment--the rigorous and prestigious position of Receiver of Memory--he, too, is a complacent model citizen. But as his near-mystical training progresses, and he is weighed down and enriched with society's collective memories of a world as stimulating as it was flawed, Jonas grows increasingly aware of the hypocrisy that rules his world."<br>  <br>  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Giver" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Giver</a>|`|0xekiwHQaa	The Giver by Lois Lowry!<br>  <br>  I just read it in like, December for my Language Arts class. :)|`|Mf6a3vEFaa	The Giver by Lois Lowry<br>  <br>  I read it a few months ago...a really good book:)

Yo3awDQmaa	These are my personal recommendations for books:<br>  (You can find my personal opinion of the one’s I’ve read at my blog CasCanRead.com)<br>  <br>  I know you said no vampire series but The House of Night series and Morganville Vampires series are both good if you ever deicide to read another vampire series. I also read Twilight and Vampire Academy. HoN and Morganville Vampires are way better. <br>   <br>  <br>  Society of S—This book is very interesting. I believe it may be an adult book, but I’m not sure. It’s about a thirteen year old girl, but her vocabulary and English is advanced. It’s a good read though. <br>  <br>  <br>  Peeps—very interesting (in a guys point of view.) He says the things in it are vampires, but they seem more like zombies to me.<br>  <br>  Someone Like You by Sarah Dessen—awesome book!<br>  <br>  The Gallagher Girls series is interesting...It's about a girl that goes to spy school. The first book is "I'd tell you I love you, but then I'd have to kill you".<br>  <br>  The two books I actually enjoyed reading in school were Speak and Holes. Speak is a really good book.<br>  <br>  A few other books I have read recently and enjoyed are: Kissing Kate, The Bermudez Triangle, and Empress of the World.<br>  <br>  <br>  Some series that others have told me to read that are in the Young Adult/ Supernatural genre are: The Mortal Instruments series, Darkest Powers series,  Maxium Ride, Vampire Kisses series, The Uglies series, Chronicles of Narnia,  and Sweep series.<br>  <br>  <br>  Then these more classical books: anything Jane Austen, To Kill a Mockingbird, Wuthering Heights, Great Expectations, Jane Eyre, Little Women, Odyssey, The Scarlet Letter, and Treasure Island. All of those are part of Barnes and Nobles Classic Collection.<br>  <br>  Any of these books listed can be found on Barnes and Noble to know what they are about.|`|B3uvhA7kaa	Ooh, I wanna read Kissed by an Angel.

Although this seems trivial, the collar, when it was placed in the magic hat, displayed characteristics which clearly defined the angst of man's struggle with his own sense of being. Trevor and his dog, Rover T, could only blush and retreat to the smoking parlor. The real question would then be, "Why did his bike have a burned out taillight?" Only on a full moon could this happen, so his vampire tendencies for the time being, would necessarily have to be suppressed.

BaklEdEuaa	Electric guitars are a little bit easier to learn with, because the strings are closer to the frets, needing less force to push the strings down, which can be a problem for beginers. However, Acoustic has such a nice sound, and wont require an Amp to hear.My first guitar was an Acoustic and I didnt seem to have any problems. If you learn with an acoustic, it means if you switch to an electric, it will be even easier.<br>  But yer, its up to you really, it depends on what type of music he wants to play. If you choose an acoustic, id go with a Yamaha, you can grab their entry level one for liek $200, which is all he needs for starting off, and it still has decent sound.|`|KBBonf97aa	Electric guitars are usually easier for beginners to play, since the action is lower (the strings are closer to the fretboard) and the necks are thinner than acoustic necks.  Those things make it easier to learn chords and move around quickly between them.  But it really depends on the type of music your husband wants to play.  If he thinks he'd prefer acoustic, there are still plenty of very user-friendly acoustics on the market.<br>  <br>  Whether you decide on acoustic or electric, I'd recommend test driving some Ibanez guitars, which are built like rocks, sound great, and are often nicer than guitars costing twice as much.  Also, both Ibanez acoustics and electrics are known for thin necks.  If you decide to go with electric, the Squier by Fender guitars are very nice, reasonably priced starter guitars, though I'd avoid the Squier Affinity series, since those guitars are known for tuning and intonation problems.<br>  <br>  The best thing your husband could do is visit a guitar store and test drive a bunch of guitars, since he's bound to find some just feel natural in his hands.  Each brand tends to have its own feel, so handling the guitars will tell him more than any person's recommendation.<br>  <br>  If you want to do some online research, I recommend having a look around the Musician's Friend website.  You can search by brand, price or customer rating.  Also, people post reviews of the instruments that will provide you with all sorts of information and help you determine which guitars are great players and which ones are better used as decoration.  Here's a link:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://guitars.musiciansfriend.com/" rel="nofollow">http://guitars.musiciansfriend.com/</a><br>  <br>  Tell your husband to trust his instincts, since he'll be able to tell which guitar is best for him after he compares a bunch of them.  And the more comfortable the guitar is, the faster he'll learn.  Good luck!|`|1QpigqCNaa	ELECTRIC!!!!!!!|`|OEMCUtKkaa	well, it depends. many think electric are mor fun and they are. but many also think acoustics are better for beginners. it doesnt really matter though. you just have to remember that when buying a guitar, you cant take an electric with you everywhere, because you'll need electricity, and an amp. which can be a pain to carry around. i presonally prefer electric. they are much more fun. since he wont play much faster than rock, i would go with acoustic. they sound awesome. there are so many different types to buy. one of the nicest brands is Martin. they make beautiful guuitars, and wont be expensive. if you want a nice guitar, dont buy anything under 300 dollars. if its over that price, itll be a prtty nice guitar.|`|zoPyYyXHaa	Get an acoustic guitar with an electric pickup. This way he can play both. If he likes to play a rhythm type style then he will enjoy an acoustic. You can play many of songs just by learning a few chords. As far as a good brand to start out with I would go with a fender or Alvarez or if you want to go a little less expensive then maybe a Yamaha guitar. Good luck.|`|gpON465Iaa	Acoustic, with a lead in case you would ever want to plug it in to amplify or record or mix with other music.  Acoustical sounds better at quieter levels.  Electric really has to be amplified to sound as good.  Headphones are ok, but kind of constraining. My favorite acoustic is the Ovation.|`|UTgz8yNnaa	electric.|`|2by2Ujblaa	Electric Pros:<br>  - Easier to play<br>  - can cover a wide range of genres<br>  - parts can be changed to suit the guitarists wants<br>  <br>  Electric Cons:<br>  - Needs an amp<br>  - Can be loud with out headphones<br>  <br>  Acoustic Pros:<br>  - better for softer music<br>  - tend to travel better than most electrics<br>  - light in weight<br>  <br>  Acoustic Cons:<br>  - harder to play<br>  - requires more maintenance to look after<br>  - scratches & dents will affect the tone more than an electric<br>  <br>  however what I recommend is a Semi-Acoustic like the Epiphone Dot (or Gibson ES-333 if you have alot of money)|`|vEC8s7fhaa	this really really really depends on what type of music he is gonna want to play, if its gonna be something like country the obviously the steel string acoustic but if his type of music is going to be changing over time i.e. if he likes one thing one day then something else the next day, then i would go for the electric because the sound it makes will vary depending on the type of of amp u got. the only problem with the electric is that things can get really expensive really fast but if money isn't really something to worry about then i would go for the electric but if it is a concern the i would go for the acoustic|`|wnBkuzpzaa	They are both great, but if your husband is a beginner, I would go with an acoustic. There are also Electric/acoustic guitars (I have that) where it looks like an acoustic and you can play it like one, but you have the option of plugging it in, and it sounds like an electric.|`|gSmrE8scaa	go with acoustic to start with - easier to practice around without being too loud. if you decide on electric though, First Act do great guitars that you can plug headphones into. This means no-one except your husband gets to listen!! :) They're cheap, have a great sound, and really fun - guitar playing should be fun!|`|z5Yn5pJEaa	you know theres a guitar that is a acoustic for his taste of music and can be plugged in. so i guess its an acoustic electric ^__^|`|hNj3jZItaa	acoustic is better for beginners<br>  you could get an acoustic/electric guitar so he could do both <br>  and i'd start out with a cheap-ish one, just in case he doesn't stick with it, you won't be spending a lot of money|`|q24bYIhSaa	An acoustic-electric hybrid maybe?? Guitar Center sells headphone amps (you plug your guitar into it and plug headphones into it) for relatively cheap...|`|UIgDmhnIaa	acoustic!|`|lsv6wSUzaa	If he is just learning, acoustic is always best. that way he can take it anywhere and impress people with his skills without hauling an amp around. it sounds cleaner and nicer than electric too.<br>  however, they are a bit large and break easier than electrics.<br>  if you get an acoustic i would go for an ovation brand. they are smaller, can be plugged into amplifiers and look awesome :)<br>  <br>  electrics have more frets, so there is more he can play i guess. they look cooler, and if you have the right stuff, can sound incredible.<br>  which means you not only need to buy the guitar, but the amp, a cord for the amp, possibly pedals if he wants to get more advanced.<br>  best electric brand is gibson, but i doubt u want to spend thousands, so go with maybe a peavey, washburn, epiphone, dean, jackson, or BC rich<br>  overall, electric is easier to play, thats what i chose :)|`|QzQ0gU7kaa	Well, acoustic guitars are harder to play, but keep in mind that if you get an electric guitar, you also have to buy an amplifier, will cost probably $150+. Also, what you were saying about plugging in headphones, not all guitars do that without special equipment. You can also get an acoustic guitar with an electric plug, so it can function both ways. Find a local guitar store, and talk to people there about what kind to buy, they always have tons of info and can match you up well. have fun  c:|`|FpSUU7ytaa	I play guitar. And you are supposed to start off using the Acoustic because the Electric strings are easier to press down on so you don't want to get used to playing strings that are easy to press down on and then start playing the acoustic. Your fingers won't be used to it and it will give you bad learning habits. So you should definitely buy him the acoustic and if he sticks to it and likes it buy him the electric!!! Hope this helps!! Good luck and have a great day!!!! :D<br>  P.S. As to what brand....I started on a First Act...They are learning guitars..But I do warn you they have really hard to press down strings so that you can get used to it and the acoustic will seem easy and so that your fingers are strong and it'll just be much better to learn on them. idk. I am not really your "go-to" girl when it comes to what brand. lol. Sorry. Good luck!!|`|k3dsI5KYaa	Electric. No comparison.|`|AA10073006	if he is a beginner, go for an acoustic one|`|2Vp4d1lPaa	u should get an electric.  it is much easier 2 learn|`|wpqwed3faa	I am deciding on a guitar also! If he's 29, I think acoustic - electric. It's a mix in between the 2 guitars. It's more acoustic, though. The mix is that it's basically acoustic, but it has an amp. If you can get one of these, get acoustic. Get nylon strings, not steel strings, because they are easier to press down on and play. I'll list some pros and cons.<br>  <br>  Acoustic:<br>  <br>  Pros - 1. I personally think they sound better and look more professional<br>            2.They help strengthen up hands<br>            3. Louder then electric (without amp)<br>  <br>  Cons - 1. They are bulky compared to electric.<br>             2. They are somewhat harder to play on, just because of how it's made.<br>             3.They usually cost more.<br>  <br>  Electric:<br>  <br>  Pros - 1. They are slimmer than acoustic and easier to play.<br>            2. They usually cost less.<br>            3. Most come with a whammy bar.<br>  <br>  Cons - 1. They are not as loud as acoustic, and if you wanna hear something coming from your guitar, your gonna need an amp.<br>             2. If you want certain effects you must purchase them (pedals, effects boards, etc.)<br>             3. Acoustics or acoustic - electrics are better for beginners.<br>  <br>  Good luck on your choice!         <br>  <br>  P.S. I think Gibson makes the nicest guitars. They are well known and I just love them!

5wF7FOqwaa	The Atherton series, beginning with the House of Power and then Rivers of Fire, by Patrick Carman take place in the future, on the world of Atherton at a time. It's kind of a post-global warming world, though, where our Earth, known in the book as the Dark Planet in 2015, has been ravaged by global warming. The air is filled with smog and cannot be breathed for more than a few minutes, unless you have filters.<br>    <br>    House of Power: "Edgar knows that in his world of Atherton, the Highlands above are forbidden and the Flatlands below are a wasteland. Yet he repeatedly climbs the walls between Tabletop and the Highlands. People think that he does it to annoy his employer, Mr. Ratikan, who controls access to water on Tabletop as it flows from above. Edgar, however, seeks a treasure in the rocky cliff wall. When mysterious earthquakes transform the landscape around his home and bring him closer to the Highlands, Edgar finds what he has been searching for. With this discovery comes a new friend, pasty bibliophile Samuel, as well as new enemies. Scheming Highlanders Lord Phineus and Sir Emerik will stop at nothing to maintain the hierarchy between the levels and keep the truth about the earthquakes hidden. As Edgar's world continues to change, he learns the frightening history of Atherton's existence."<br>  <a href="http://search.barnesandnoble.com/Atherton/Patrick-Carman/e/9780316166706/?itm=3" rel="nofollow">http://search.barnesandnoble.com/Atherto...</a><br>    Oh, and by the way, did you know that the sequel to The Hunger Games, Catching Fire, is coming out on September 1?|`|7KcVSB3Uaa	Terry Brooks' Shannara series takes place in a post-nuclear world.

ceBTTCPwaa	Les Misérables (pronounced: /le mi?ze?abl(?); translated variously from French as The Miserable Ones, The Wretched, The Poor Ones, The Wretched Poor, The Victims) (1862) is a novel by French author Victor Hugo, and among the best-known novels of the 19th century. It has been described as one of the greatest novels ever written in any language.[citation needed] It follows the lives and interactions of several French characters over a twenty-year period in the early 19th century, starting in the year of Napoleon's final defeat. The novel principally focuses on the struggles of the main character, ex-convict Jean Valjean, as he seeks to redeem himself from his past mistakes. It also provides social commentary by examining the impact of Valjean's actions: and it examines the nature of good, evil, and the law, in a sweeping story that expounds upon the history of France, architecture of Paris, politics, moral philosophy, antimonarchism, justice, religion, and the types and nature of romantic and familial love. Les Misérables is known to many through its numerous stage and screen adaptations, of which the most famous is the stage musical of the same name, sometimes abbreviated "Les Mis" or "Les Miz" (pronounced /le? ?m?z/). The story may be considered historical fiction because it contains factual, historic events, including the Paris Uprising of 1832 (often mistaken for the much earlier French Revolution).<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.bookrags.com/Les_Mis%C3%A9rables" rel="nofollow">http://www.bookrags.com/Les_Mis%C3%A9rab...</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.sparknotes.com/lit/lesmis/" rel="nofollow">http://www.sparknotes.com/lit/lesmis/</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.cliffsnotes.com/WileyCDA/LitNote/id-61.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.cliffsnotes.com/WileyCDA/LitN...</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.novelguide.com/LesMiserables/index.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.novelguide.com/LesMiserables/...</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.pinkmonkey.com/booknotes/monkeynotes/pmLesMis02.asp" rel="nofollow">http://www.pinkmonkey.com/booknotes/monk...</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.gradesaver.com/ClassicNotes/Titles/miserables" rel="nofollow">http://www.gradesaver.com/ClassicNotes/T...</a>
KjRQysyZaa	We had to read Dante's Inferno in English class last year. <br>  <br>  From personal experience, I would've liked some background on the people he meets in each level of hell, but if you read it with footnotes or something, it'll be fine. <br>  <br>  I found it pretty hard to read. But keep in mind I was in 8th grade, so we read it but really didn't get THAT into it or anything. If you're just reading it to read it without analyzing every little thing about it, then it's not too bad. <br>  <br>  I found it to be a great read though :)|`|wDigwK2maa	I've only read the Inferno so far so I can't answer all of your questions, but I thought that it was pretty easy to read, but the edition I read provided summaries at the end of each canto which helped me understand everything I read.  There are quite a few cultural references in it, but most editions have footnotes that will explain  them to you.
FLAtdWrmaa	OK, do you want easy, or do you want medieval?   :-D<br>  <br>  What years/centuries does your social studies teacher include in the term, "medieval?"  And only European medieval, I assume?  (Not Middle East, northern Africa, Russia, etc)  And how large does your illumination have to be?  Some illuminated manuscripts were three feet tall!  Some "girdle books" could fit into a man's closed hand.<br>  <br>  If you looked on google and didn't find anything, you clearly didn't have the right search words!!!  There are millions of hits you missed out on. No offence, but you can't have been even half trying!<br>  <br>  Try looking for "historiated initials",  "inhabited initials", "medieval miniature illumination", "medieval illumination", "illuminated manuscripts", "rubricated initials", "grisaille illuminations", and lots more.  Even Wikipedia has reasonable pictures of medieval illuminations you could adapt, and those are enlargeable, too.<br>  <br>  Also, look up specific museum and library sites, and see what they have online in the way of medieval illumination collections.  Start with the Metropolitan Museum of Art's (NYC, that is) Cloisters Museum.<br>  <br>  And then move on  to universities of the world -- they're also big on preserving medieval artifacts, especially books.  Start with the British universites, but go on to places like the US, Australia, South Africa, and New Zealand.  <br>  <br>  Then, if you're really brave, or desperate, try non-English European uni sites and museums.|`|NnF3TUFGaa	I did a report on babyowin (the animals within medieval illumination) back in middle school. here are 3 good reference sites and a link to 2 kits I plan to buy for my own use.

Also, the last word of the last sentence of the second to last paragraph should read "wispy" and needs another color. Perhaps you meant "wispy white clouds" or something of the sort.

A novel can't work with no show and just tell. It gets boring after a while and drones on and gets to the point of, "Huh? Souls? Misconception? A weave? What does this have to do with anything?"<br>  <br>  I don't particularly like whoever is talking.

Unless the authors put their books online somewhere for free, you are probably out of luck.<br>  <br>  Sites that scan copyrighted books and make them available with no payment to the author are inconsiderate to the author, and they're illegal.

But I wish I could covey to you the feeling of wasted time I felt when I graduated school and figured out that my 8 years of torment was just the pressurized environment of SCHOOL, and not a reflection of my real life or even of the people who bullied me. I don't know why schools are such a field of oppression for those of us who fit in less well, but my teachers and administrators could not have been more oblivious to my predicament. I feel for you.

SS9hE8rnaa	Aside from the werewolf question (and the definition of a fable require the use of personified animals) you need to address the mechanics of your writing. Spelling, grammar, word choice and sentence structure.<br>  <br>  There was a forest where a werewolf lived. He didn’t have any friends, because, although he wasn’t mean, the creatures that lived around him still bullied. He didn’t really understand why the creatures insulted him. Finally it got to the point where he moved somewhere more civilized. Days before moving to a nice village just outside the forest he met a fox who was going to live where he lived. The fox asked why he was leaving the pleasant forest and the werewolf told about how he was mistreated. Although the fox didn’t really know the werewolf well, he knew it was wrong to treat the werewolf so rough. After the werewolf’s departure the fox moved in the wooden cabinet. The fox wanted to do something about the injustice that his new neighbors did to the poor werewolf. So the fox decided to go early in morning to see his new acquaintances and tell them that it was incorrect to treat a creature badly without knowing him. Although this mde a bad first impression on the rude neighbors, the fox managed to stand up for what he believed in. <br>  <br>  My changes improve the mechanics some. If you are going to write, you will have to do better at this. It's really the easiest part of writing.|`|NgRiFZ7Baa	I do believe that you shouldn't use werewolves, maybe just a normal wolf.<br>  Foxes are usually intelligent and are a symbol of quick wit - perhaps you should have the fox find a clever way to solve the problem, like a set-up that shows the creatures why they were wrong instead of a verbal confrontation. Use your imagination to get that part - it got you this much.|`|WTXvmcxcaa	Yeah, I agree with the first answer. Why a werewolf? I mean, aren't they vicious, man-eating creatures? Besides the ones in Twilight? Try to be a little bit more creative than that. A plain wolf will do. They are beautiful creatures, anyway. Much better than werewolves.|`|InzHK1rcaa	Fables: No insanely mythical creatures of the night like werewolves. Why not try just using a normal wolf instead?

3ee64ee7ec766828c5143beacd3dc7f6aa	Here's the best advice I know:<br>  <br>  Write only the book that you alone can write; the one story you can't keep yourself from telling; the one no one else has written yet.<br>  <br>  Don't settle for second best in your writing. If you're not happy with what you're writing, re-write, revise, re-think. <br>  <br>  Write so you can see it, hear it feel it, smell it, taste it. You're creating a world for yourself and your readers. Don't cheat them or yourself by falling back on cliches, or using over-familiar phrases or scenes. Don't underestimate your readers. Make them think, Let them use their imaginations rather than giving them over-detailed descriptions of everything.<br>  <br>  Write so that you can't wait to write what happens next.|`|y8cXzvpxaa	sometimes writing at the top of your head works but it can also backfire where you might write yourself into a corner and lose the momentum. you should try writing a general outline of your story so you have something to stick with. then at any time you feel you need to change it then change it. but at least you have something to go by.|`|LfpAXkPhaa	I'm not a writer so I can't speak specifically to the challenges of writing. I am, however, an artist and very much understand the creative process and how difficult it can be to push through the blocks and get that "thing" that you see so clearly in your head, out into the real world.<br>  <br>  For me, one factor is being willing to fail. I've learned more about myself and my work through those pieces that didn't work out than from those that have been a resounding success. I've gained more from the negative critiques of my work than the positive (although it is very good to hear the positive).<br>  <br>  Its also about immersing myself in the process without losing myself in it. I try not to be too fixated on the final outcome, mainly because it tends to evolve and change. At the same time, however, I can't let myself become so over-involved in the process that I become bogged down and a final outcome is never realized. <br>  <br>  As a creative, I'm not a naturally organized person. In my creative process, though, I have to employ a level of organized creative thinking that will keep those things that can run away with me in check. To have a final destination in mind, in whatever form it needs to take, is very helpful in my work.<br>  <br>  I hope this helps.<br>  <br>  Good luck! I can't wait to read it....|`|WTXvmcxcaa	just write and see where it goes. don't worry about editing. you can do that later. write and write and write and write. until you finish. then go back and edit. see if it makes sense. see if you like it, or if someone else likes it. then, if everything is finally ready, try and get it to a publisher. :) <br>  <br>  Good Luck!|`|kbouBTxvaa	Write about financial planning for common men...most books which are best sellers are about managing money smart way/|`|BWtVHgJ8aa	sit down and start writing, then keep writing some more.

In Scarecrow he is in a bounty hunt tho he is the hunted.  All these guys are trying to catch him and lop off his head to receive a bounty of 1million.  The Scarecrow (Shane Schofield) is able to evade everything and save the world from utter destruction.  Its totally awesome.  The only catch is that his girlfriend - also a marine who Shane has been dating in from the previous two books and is the second best character to Shane is caught.  She is then beheaded in a French guillotine.  I cried soooooo much.      This is what I would change.

g92UnU5eaa	This isn't what you want to hear, but it's the truth and one of the many keys to writing a great story.    Your characters should serve your plot, not the other way round. In other words, you need to make up the characters to suit the story, not make up a bunch of characters and then squeeze them into a plot and hope that they fit.    I recommend you keep the Huntre family saved up for another, future story which has room for them. They won't go anywhere.    Good luck x|`|38eb78ef54653766c3ca71d79051901caa	I agree with "helpingu" about the plot holes.    Don't ruin a potentially good story because you want to force your characters to do something.    Let your characters "talk" to you.  If you develop them strongly, they will tell you their story.|`|LQSApB5raa	well if it's your story don't ask for help...figure it out yourself it all seems creative just go with your gut and it will turn out great....keep up the good work!!|`|gRAqTQBPaa	Truthfully, I think that that idea for a story is absolutely wonderful. Its captivating and thrilling at the same time. I think you should continue with your original plot, I'll keep an eye out on the book shelves for that one, its amazing. Your and inspiration. Thanks!|`|AA11586196	What makes this story so complicated to fix is the idea that the war was a long time in the past and things have improved so much that the Cruenti and Restorer children now go to school together? No way I send my child to school with blood sucking parasites! Plus, if the war is over, then someone must have won, which means that the losers were either 1) wiped out, 2) nearly exterminated so that their numbers are no longer a threat, or 3) subjugated into slavery or in some other way dominated.      Ask yourself if it is possible to love someone who feeds off of you--literally! If you can discover a way where that is ok in a relationship, then you have the basis of your love story.|`|oQrIn41zaa	Okay..I think the first plot was much better than the second, but that's my POV. I'm a writer. I write fanfic and I'm writing a couple of novels to publish and talking with some publishers by e-mail, getting tips and stuff, you really should do the same.  Okay, I'm not too much of a planning person when it comes to writing, it's a good/bad thing depending on how you look at it...so I'm not sure I can write you a plot, but I'll try:    Here goes nothing --    Hero Laker. Broden Huntre. The most unlikley of friends who, yet, are the closest of friends.  Hero lives with her grandmother, Cross, who was a Restorer once upon a time, but lost her family in the Cruentiarer War of 238.  Cross had a daughter, Amelai, also a Restorer, with an impossible secret. She had fallen in love with Esphias, one of many Cruenti. One of her enemy.  She fell pregnant and, they went into hiding. The Problem? Cross was a tracker. Cross could find and pinpoint anyone she wished to. Amelai never knew this.  Hero was born, a day later Cross arrived, followed, unknowlingly, by several Cruenti, seeking to kill her, a restorer.  Cross & Hero sheilded by Amelai & Esphias survived. While Hero's parents were lost forever.    Cross & Hero, 15 years later, had taken on a completely new life. Hero attended a local school in the isolated town of Forks, Washington (Sorry, couldn't resist, Forks hasn't been heard of before, but it's probably just as touristy as NY or LA now, since 2005. =D)  A boy in town, a Cruenti boy, called Broden arrived. Cross knew immediatley and asked Hero to befriend him.  Reasonless, Hero did what she was told, and made an unlikley friendship with Broden that led to disastrous consequences....a forbidden love occured. Right under Cross' eyes, her daughters life was replaying, only it was her grandaughters life she had to save while another war was brewing...    Hope that's okay..?    [x]|`|2Od4wzlhaa	Its well written, for sure.  The story itself is hard to understand.  Maybe i am just a little young, and maybe the story is too mature for me, but i had to read the first paragraph a few times, sentence by sentence.   but the way you write it was good. Just add some more detail, you know what i mean?
yOK32PM9aa	Yes|`|oadMJWOCaa	the present is the the ability to think about the past and the future|`|145c8348c6805dffd8ad539dedd6effbaa	Yes.  learn to enjoy the here and now and you'll be a lot happier.|`|PEVkrOVVaa	Yes, cause when something is once done, it can't be undone, it become past, your present changes second by second, and things come to past all the time.  And the future keeps turing into present every second, and there for future really never comes, cause by the time it does, it become present.  so the present moment is all that really exists.  I mean you can die of a heat attack within next 5 min, and all that you planned for your "future" will come to nothing.  So live life, second by second rather than year by year.
VwQkDkMoaa	Good job on the video, it sounds nice..<br>  Have you got a teacher?  I am a piano teacher actually.  I know you think it's easy for us to see what you are talking about because you play and know the tune, and the video is supposed to makes us see it clearly but it doesn't.  I aven't got the time to learn the song you are talking about, all I can do is make a comment.<br>  <br>  You look like you are doing a good job of it personally.  When I jump octaves in the left hand I tend to alternate the fingering (not always use finger one and five).  I try to switch it around between finger 1 and 5, to 1 and 3, or 1 and 4.  It can make the transitions easier.<br>  As for the right hand chords.  Try experimenting changing the inversions so they are closer, not so far to jump.<br>  Failing that, use the pedal more to connect them.<br>  <br>  That's about all I can comment on.  I'd have to see you in the room and play it also to give a better comment.|`|1afbbdf95ac24d4f09b64f9e1a7930afaa	I would play the g# with your left pinky. When you play that note, rest your left thumb on the g# above it, but don't play it. When you make the jump to play the g# minor chord, use your thumb to gauge where the g# minor chord will be. I would use a 1,3,5 fingering. <br>  <br>  I think the most important part is to get so comfortable with the right hand that you don't have to think about it. Chances are its a melody and doesn't jump octaves like the left hand. Memorize that melody. Although the left hand is less important, you'll never be able to play it consistently without looking at it. Learn the right hand so well that all you have to think about is the left hand.
ZLWswKHHaa	How well you reacted to your partner(s) in the moment. Whether you negated or not. Negating means if someone said, "what's that bird doing on your head" and you said, "there's no bird on my head". They offered you something and you threw it away. So, whether you did that or not. Negating is very bad for improv. Also asking questions. For instance, someone hands you an imaginary thing; good improvers will say "this cup of coffee looks yummy, i love starbucks" or whatever, rather than saying, "what is this?" and depending on your partner to make all the decisions. The most important thing is giving your partner pieces of information to work with and add to. To keep taking steps in the scene and giving your audience information about what's going on. I would discuss how well you did these things in your essay. Good luck!

The dual method and other circumstances surrounding the event encouraged rumours that Hitler may have survived the end of World War II along with speculation about what happened to his remains.   Some witnesses later reported hearing a loud gunshot at around 15:30. After waiting a few minutes, Hitler's valet Heinz Linge, with Bormann at his side, opened the door to the small study. Linge later stated he immediately noted a scent of burnt almonds, a common observation made in the presence of prussic acid, the gaseous form of cyanide. The Hitlers were both sitting on a small sofa, Eva on the left, Adolf to her right. Eva's body slumped away from Adolf's. Hitler appeared to have shot himself in the right temple (there was an exit wound towards the top, left side of his head) with a Walther PPK 7.65 mm pistol which lay at his feet. Blood dripping from Adolf's temple and chin had made a large stain on the right arm of the sofa and was pooling on the floor/carpet. Eva had no visible physical wounds and Linge assumed she had poisoned herself.    Several witnesses said the two bodies were carried up to ground level and through the bunker's emergency exit to a small, bombed-out garden behind the Chancellery where they were doused with petrol and set alight by Linge and members of Hitler's personal SS bodyguard. The SS guards and Linge later noted the fire did not completely destroy the corpses but Soviet shelling of the bunker compound made further cremation attempts impossible and the remains were later covered up in a shallow bomb crater after 18:00.
Nldx247Yaa	yup... many times, people don't take the beautiful people seriously. they have this misconception that there are no brains with beauty and they assume that they use their bodies to get them to places they want to go...example: getting a job, people are more likely to hire the attractive people over the unattractive....|`|YmtNel5haa	no.<br>  People go out of their way for beautiful people.<br>  Models get oodles of cash and for what?<br>  Not their intelligence.<br>  Life is so unfair.|`|YupMCYHlaa	Yes it can!  A girl who is very beautiful can never be sure a man loves her for herself.  It's the same with someone who is very rich.<br>  <br>  But also beautiful people are used to special treatment and they tend to be kind of shallow.|`|1XRHUCvtaa	Advantages and Disadvantages are completely relative to your point of view.<br>  If you want to be an actor specialising in ugly old bag-ladies, beauty would be a definite disadvantage.<br>  If you want to find a rich husband who is looking for beauty over brains, it would help to be beautiful.<br>  <br>  Then again, you have to think about the question: What is beauty? Is it dark skin and curly hair? Is it a long neck and earlobes down to the shoulders? Is it pasty white skin and freckles?<br>  Or, is beauty on the inside, in your actions and motivations?<br>  <br>  Never put beauty on a pedestal, because it's an unbalanced object and is likely to fall off and break.|`|AA11488628	yes because then it becomes a a problem with people not looking at the person behind the face and the beautiful person could have a problem with thinking that their worth as a person is all about what they look like. beauty fades with age but a good personality is beautiful no matter how old you are. <br>  being really beautiful is just the roll of the genetic dice and therefore not all that important. it is like winning the lottery. in time the money gets spent and it is what you saved and who you are that matters when the money is gone.|`|yZbJdLyzaa	being beautiful on the outside is a blessing. being beautiful on the inside is a choice. :)|`|pUUyYz4gaa	Most of the time it is.

OtYAkRrRaa	I would suggest taking a trip to the library and looking for a book that talks about how to write a book. Reason being, when you are writing a book and you want it to sell, you want to give your best. If you get a few ideas from people without researching book writing you are missing out on important details that you need to not only make it a good book but make it a best selling book.  Having said that, I know you will want to do research on your topic by seeing what others have written and improving on that/listing your own  ideas.  You will need to proofread it many times for typos, sentence structure etc. You should also have as many people as possible esp. family and friends and people you don't know very well proofread your book. After that you will need to write a query letter to a publishing company. That is also researchable in the library. How to write a query letter?  It's a process and if you want to make money it won't be rushed.

If that is not bad enough they were burned or killed in the gas chamber when they were of no more use. The devil himself, Hitler, was the man who did theses unspeakable things.      Not all people were experimented on. These more than likely were not. If they were Doctors were forced to try experiments  with shocl therapy, deadly drugs...horrifying things.|`|IE9NfLGoaa	Dey turned into vampires >.|`|ZDrXFS2daa	That is how all the people looked in the concentration camps during the Holocaust.

Their heads are shaved so they don't get and pass along lice and other diseases.|`|1DT7OUuHaa	I cry every time I see pictures like that.  I don't know about the children in that particular picture and probably no one really does.  However, statistics say that most of the children that were experimented on were killed usually by slow and deliberate torture. If they didn't die from the actual experiments, they were usually hauled off to a gas chamber and killed that way or by guns in an execution style manner.  It's unthinkable.  Are you sure that these particular children were experimented on though?  Not all of them were victims of medical experiments.   They could have just been starving to death and that's why they look like they are dying.  I'm not even Jewish but I think about what they went through during Hitler's reign all the time and I pray that nothing like this ever happens again.  I wish we could have tortured Hitler and all this cohorts like he did to the Jews. If you want to learn more about the actual experiments that they did, just google "medical experiments in jewish concentration camps" or different variations on that but I myself can't bear to even hear about what they did.

hl4kkvXhaa	I'm not sure what you mean by "if I get in" when you say Ohio University.  Unless they changed the rules since I went there, it is a school that accepts all applicants.  The only thing is, if your ACT or SAT scores weren't high enough, they put you in lower level academic courses for the areas that you had problems (ie. math, English, etc.).<br>  <br>  I'm trying to get into school for Communications studies at the moment too, but not with Ohio University.  Honestly, either Master's program would serve you well.  But, I would recommend the MA in Visual Communications because it will give you a broader scope of communications experience than an MFA in photography.<br>  <br>  But...that may just be me, since I plan on going the other route with an MFA in Creative Writing so that I can work towards an editing career.  <br>  <br>  Your best bet would be to speak to an advisor who will explain what courses and requirements each degree program will need, and the benefits of each program.  I can only say what I would do in your shoes, which would be to get the MA in Visual Communications because you will most likely be able to take photography classes, at least as required electives (since each program necessitates a specified number of electives each year).<br>  <br>  Whatever you decide, I wish you good luck in the future!|`|e185922a05d6a34cd1ab11b31d21af0baa	I am sure you are well aware of the phrase "jack of all trades but master of none". Solidify your interest and experience in photojournalism with the MA.  I am not sure how much you are into fine art photography but it can be quite different than photojournalism though it does overlap at times.  Depending upon the institution with the MA you should be able to teach photojournalism courses as well as give you the flexibility to say teach intro to photo classes in the art/photo department.|`|S8aCj7m7aa	I am an Academic Advisor at a University. If you are planning on working at a four year University in a Visual Arts department as an Instructor, you must have a MFA, if you are planning on working in a Communication Department as an Instructor, you will need a MA, so you have to know exactly what course of instruction you will want to teach. Next point, you will not be able to get into most studio MFA programs without a studio BFA or at least all the courses that equal a studio BFA, so that may help you with your decision.|`|LfpAXkPhaa	If your goal is to be a professor at a University, you will have to have an MFA.

6kue5meiaa	Leather-bound editions are generally more expensive than the more common paper-bound hardcover books, but they also tend to last longer. Book binding is an old and noble art.     Generally the process begins with loose single or folded pages that are stitched (the best by hand) to the spine of the book, so you might have difficulty getting an existing book converted. There are, however, leather book covers that you can purchase, beginning at $20 and going up depending on size and features.|`|hKP5sQewaa	They are expensive for the poor animal that got skinned. :[|`|ajeMVARraa	I am sure they're not cheap, just because it's not a typical binding procedure anymore.

EWMfigrnaa	Ptolemy, who gave Greek astronomy its final form in the second century A.D., did the same--and more--for geography and cartography. His massive work on the subject, which summed up and criticized the work of earlier writers, offered instruction in laying out maps by three different methods of projection, provided coordinates for some eight thousand places, and treated such basic concepts as geographical latitude and longitude.    Perhaps the most significant contribution of Ptolemy and his maps is the first uses of longitudinal and latitudinal lines and the specifying of terrestrial locations by celestial observations. When his Geographia was translated from Greek into Arabic in the ninth century and subsequently into Latin in Western Europe at the beginning of the fifteenth century, the idea of a global coordinate system revolutionized medieval Islamic and European geographical thinking and put it upon a scientific and numerical basis.

DIlNnjf8aa	The name by which the river is predominantly known is the Yangtze, which is infamous for its flooding. Excerpted from the Wikipedia article on the Yangtze:<br>  <br>  "Flooding along the river has been a major problem. The rainy season in China is May and June in areas south of Yangtze River, and July and August in areas north of it. The huge river system receives water from both southern and northern flanks, which causes its flood season to extend from May to August. Meanwhile, the relatively dense population and rich cities along the river make the floods more deadly and costly. The most recent major floods were the 1998 Yangtze River floods, but more disastrous were the 1954 Yangtze River floods, killing around 30,000 people. Other severe floods included those of 1911, which killed around 100,000, 1931 (145,000 dead), and 1935 (142,000 dead)."|`|G7oXjrVmaa	the chang jiang river is the longest river in china and is commonly known as the yangtze river. the difficulties that created the river to have was people were putting wires and bomb to try and blow it up and the animals were dying because of this.

QPPcUyyyaa	I believe it was begun by the Moscow Soviet.  Soviet is Russian for "union."  The first Soviets were not individuals but rather groups of workers employed in similar fields.    The Moscow Soviet had counterparts in other cities - but if memory serves me correctly, the Moscow Soviet played the biggest role.  The revolution was really an isolated event.  These old European countries aren't like modern nations, Russia and France in particular.  Everything radiates out from the capitol.  If something happens there, it can change the country.    I hope that gives you a good start.

Agt5JpTZaa	I def think you should. :] <br>  It sounds to me like you're in love with music as so many others are.<br>  If it gives you that feeling, you most likely are.<br>  <br>  Insecure? You can't be if you want to make it in the performing industry. That's one thing you'd have to work on- self confidence. If you think that everyone else can sing better than you, and you don't truly believe that you can make it, then forget it, because you won't. <br>  <br>  That's the key. You have to believe in yourself. Say for example...let's use acting. Okay, so you're at an audition with tonssss of other actors and actresses that have been trained just as much as you have been. You see them practicing, and it gets you really nervous. You start telling yourself that they're soooo much better than you and you don't have any chance at that role. Then, you go into the audition with less self-confidence, which makes your performance much weaker.<br>  <br>  See what I mean?<br>  Anyways, if you can learn to believe in yourself, and you KNOW that you are good (because you can't waste your time on something unless you know for a fact that you have the talent) then I say go for it.<br>  <br>  :]|`|Rm9mII46aa	Well, when you say "the music industry" do you mean like, an engineer in a studio, or an assistant to somebody, or an agent? There are lots of fields in the music industry. You should look into it more closely. <br>  <br>  If you want to be a performer, then what kind of performer? Do you already play instruments or sing? If so, you'll probably end up doing criminal justice anyway since it's very, very hard to make money at being a musical performer. I mean very hard. Almost impossible, unless you come from a rich family and have been trained since you were young and will be able to be marketable and famous while you are young and still attractive. <br>  <br>  DO BOTH. If you actually love music, you'll get in a band or something and perform after work or on weekends. Or, if you want to get into the "industry" as you say, then go to school for it. Many colleges have programs in sound engineering and stuff. Do some actual research on it. <br>  <br>  My guess is that if you don't know now and have doubts, then you shouldn't do it. People that make it as performers only make it because of 1) Luck 2) Persistence 3) Looks 4) Talent. If you're having doubts before you've even gotten started, it's gonna be rough when you're playing to an empty bar in your home town, or if nobody will hire you to begin with...|`|sr0sczJaaa	I think you should go for it so someday you don't think, what if? If it doesn't work out then pursue your other dream. If the music thing does work out you could always do criminal justice on the side or when your older or even do criminal justice and music on the side for fun.<br>  <br>  what ever happens, do what you want to do and follow your dreams because you obviously only have 1 life to live man.<br>  <br>  good luck

All I can see is what a mess it has made of society and the decreased value it has put on human life. Sure we all have some fancy new machine made things and lots and lots of goodies to buy, but with all those goodies comes lots and lots of trash for our landfills. With more machines to do the job of a man, man has lost purpose. This leads to depression and obesity. When greed from wanting things takes over it is hard to make things right again. All the industrial revolution did was pull people away from farming and self reliance all for the sake of a dollar while completely destroying our planet.

Hn5mGBWuaa	Agreed and it's really sad. The Nanking Massacre was one of the worst atrocities committed in the Second World War. Until this very day, the Japanese government has been weary to apologize, admit the truth and still doctor their school textbooks. The Germans on the other hand, admitted what they did was wrong and were very open about it. Today, Germany is one of the most tolerant nations in Europe. I don't see anything wrong with the Japanese people, especially the new generation. We all are guilty of doing bad things. However, being open helps the healing process of a nation and its foreign perception to the world.|`|xwQ2my6Maa	I'm not sure. Maybe for the same reason the US doesn't apologize for theirs.<br>  <br>  <br>  Hmmm.....Maybe the Japanese don't feel they have done anything wrong that they need to apologize for.

Many POWs in the Battan death march were shipped to Japan and many worked like slaves for mitsubishi and other Japanese companies. Since today none of these companies have apologized for their actions. <br>  <br>  Also a Japanese child book about the conquest in China denies most of the events that happened. Reading books about the rape of china and pows in Japanese control you think that the Japanese had no souls. How could people do that to another human being.|`|DIlNnjf8aa	The Japanese are in denial because admissions and apologies are usually followed up by monetary demands; in this case, the damages are so enormous they would swallow up the Japanese economy.|`|1zfwLsQpaa	Denial is bad.

Germany's response to its war crimes has been largely lauded by the former Allies. The Government of the Federal Republic of Germany (West Germany until 1990) offered official apologies for Germany's role in the Holocaust. Additionally, German leaders have continuously expressed repentance, most notably when former Chancellor Willy Brandt fell on his knees in front of a Holocaust memorial in the Warsaw Ghetto, also known as the Warschauer Kniefall in 1970. Germany has also paid extensive reparations, including nearly $70 billion to the state of Israel. It has given $15 billion to Holocaust survivors and will continue to compensate them until 2015. Additionally, the government of Germany coordinated an effort to reach a settlement with German companies that had used slave labor during the war; the companies will pay $1.7 billion to victims. Germany also established a National Holocaust Memorial Museum in Berlin for looted property|`|1hvrQYWiaa	The Japanese government does not deny these things, nor do they claim that USA started the war against them.Nevertheless, as you state, there has been no apology from any post war Japanese government (unlike those in Germany) for what they did.<br>   Why is this? Presumably, the Japanese are not sorry at all for what they did. The Japanese Emperor is supposedly divine, and Japanese tradition has it that the Emperor can trace his descent back in direct line to the sun (really).<br>   So, perhaps the Japanese see themselves as superior in some way to Chinese,Koreans and so on and therefore see no need to apologize...?|`|8840f90d1236990da5c34043fc11245faa	I don't know why but I don't think they are doing the younger Japanese any favours by deny it learning your countries history even if it isn't pleasant is a right for all citizens.<br>  <br>  I went to the war memorial in Melbourne and was surprised at the large amount of young Japanese tourists there many had tears in their eyes and were very sombre and respectful one said to me he never knew the history of the war until he came over here.|`|c82ecbef231aced5c49891502424aad3aa	They still feel that they did nothing wrong and everything was in the name of the emperor so to them it's alright to kill innocents and soldiers and whoever else they felt like.
ji7WZvC1aa	Read the script and write down what you think the play demands in terms of lighting.  Are there any specialist effects which are needed - a streetlight, a followspot? Talk to the director and find out what they want the lighting to achieve.  Have a chat to the costume designer and wardrobe department to find out what colours they're using for the costumes, and pick some gel colours which will complement them rather than making them look muddy.  The most important thing, and it sounds basic, is to make sure that the actors can be seen at all times.  I've been to too many shows where the lighting designer has tried to be "arty" and you can't see faces - and it's incredibly annoying.  <br>  <br>  It's impossible to be any more specific than that, because we don't know what your set looks like, or what your director wants from the lighting.  Specific questions I can answer, non-specific I can't!|`|kkr8Hemeaa	yes. considering the corny-ness of the set in the rural west, i would definitely go for a bright flooding of the stage for the town numbers, and more moon-shadowlike pools of light for the romantic night scenes.

The answer to your question has an indefinate answer- one that is different for everybody. <br>  A Romantic will tell you that love is the meaning of life. <br>  A realist will tell you that we are put on earth to create and reproduce. <br>  A environmentalist might say that we are put on the earth to take care of the earth. <br>  A musician might say music is the meaning of life. <br>  A religous person...religion. <br>  <br>  It is different for every different human being. It is up to you to decide what you think the meaning of life is.|`|1XRHUCvtaa	Sorry to disappoint you, but you did answer your own question.

The first thing is you have to have a movie filming somewhere near you, OR, as one of my friends used to do -- you can move out to Los Angeles for a few months during "pilot season" (usually in spring, as I recall) when all the pilots for possible new shows are being shot and there's a lot of work for extras and bit actors.<br>  <br>  Most of the time, if there's a movie or show filming near you, they'll be running ads in the papers or TV looking for extras; otherwise, contacting the film office will usually let you know when/if they need people. Generally they will start by giving a day and a location for you and hundreds or maybe even thousands of other people to turn up -- often at a large hotel or stadium or someplace like that --  where they'll do preliminary work (like determining if you look suitable for their needs, recording your measurements in case you require costumes); then if you match their needs they usually call you in a couple weeks and offer you a day/time/place to work, and tell you how much they're paying.|`|9QF6GGyiaa	Its actually not that hard.

NhFRsflwaa	How about inter racial love? Even though it's more readily accepted today than in decades past, in some circles it isn't.

Just a thought.|`|2PDBxlYDaa	You can set the book in any time period because the story of love is so classic. The novel starts with the Bennetts talking about a family that is moving to the town and ask their dad to visit him.

Anyway, they set it at a mormon college and the characters were mormon. <br>  <br>  In another version called "Bride and Prejudice" the girl is Indian from the country India and the guy is an American and its set in the 21st century.

Do not elaborate too much in this paragraph, it is there as an introduction.<br>  <br>  Middle Paragraphs: Elaborate on the supporting arguments mentioned in the first paragraph. Each of the arguments should be separate to each other. Try using linking words such as 'moreover' and 'furthermore' to start each paragraph (from the start of the 3rd paragraph - do not use it at the start of the 2nd paragraph as you don't need to connect the introductory paragraph to the supporting arguments), and use the first sentence of each paragraph as an argument outline.<br>  <br>  Final Paragraph: This is the conclusion and should sum up all the  arguments (from each of the middle paragraphs) you have used to support your main point/argument, then sum up your main argument.  <br>  <br>  TIP: Try not to refer to yourself or the essay in the essay.<br>  <br>  Good luck!

AkSOZ099aa	Well you have come to the right place. Nooo! my fav. book has a hint of romance but isnt too big. is that ok?<br>  Inkheart by Corneli Funke<br>  The book is about a 12-year-old girl named Meggie Folchart whose life changes dramatically when she realizes that her father, a bookbinder named Mortimer (Mo), has an unusual ability: when he reads aloud, he can bring characters from books into the real world. Meggie and Mo's adventure takes them throughout Europe, particularly Italy, and brings them into contact with many unusual characters.<br>  <br>  I also like this book. which dosent have romance untill the fifth book. but its really good.<br>  Artemis Fowl by Eion Colfer<br>  its about a boy whose an evil genius and he stumbles upon fairies and tries to steal gold from them. The author is a genius. seriously you wont be dissapointed with this book<br>  heres some more <br>  Artemis Fowl is a series of fantasy novels written by Irish author Eoin Colfer, starring the teenage criminal mastermind Artemis Fowl II. The series is written in half-serious language, alternating dark moments with humorous ones, a style favoured by a number of popular children's authors.<br>  <br>  Artemis, the main character, is a ruthless and extremely intelligent young criminal whose main goal is the acquisition of money through a variety of often illegal schemes (although his values change towards the 5th book). The author summed up the series as: "Die Hard with fairies."[1]<br>  <br>  also im 14 and im not really into the vampire thing either too many psychos. you know. but yeah. try artemis fowl if you dont want romance.|`|Yo3awDQmaa	These are my personal recommendations for books:<br>  (You can find my personal opinion of the one’s I’ve read at my blog CasCanRead.com)<br>  <br>  ***I took out all of my vampire novel since you asked for none, but if you change your mind you can find my recommendation for them on my blog.<br>  <br>  Someone Like You by Sarah Dessen—awesome book!<br>  <br>  The Gallagher Girls series is interesting...It's about a girl that goes to spy school. The first book is "I'd tell you I love you, but then I'd have to kill you".<br>  <br>  The two books I actually enjoyed reading in school were Speak and Holes. Speak is a really good book.<br>  <br>  A few other books I have read recently and enjoyed are: Kissing Kate, The Bermudez Triangle, and Empress of the World.<br>  <br>  <br>  Some series that others have told me to read that are in the Young Adult/ Supernatural genre are: The Mortal Instruments series, Darkest Powers series,  Maxium Ride, The Uglies series, Chronicles of Narnia, and Sweep series.<br>  <br>  <br>  Then these more classical books: anything Jane Austen, To Kill a Mockingbird, Wuthering Heights, Great Expectations, Jane Eyre, Little Women, Odyssey, The Scarlet Letter, and Treasure Island.

These should be plenty for now.|`|mO1s4pMgaa	Evermore by Alyson Noel<br>  Ever was a normal high school girl living a pretty good life. But, ever since Ever was in a car accident which killed her parents and sister, she could hear people's thoughts, see auras, and a person's life story just from touching someone. Thinking she's crazy, she tries to shut herself out from everyone by becoming an outcast at school. But everything changes when she meets Damen Auguste. Ever sees Damen and feels an instant recognition. He is gorgeous, exotic and wealthy, and he holds many secrets. Damen is able to make things appear and disappear, he always seems to know what she’s thinking—and he’s the only one who can silence the noise and the random energy in her head. She doesn’t know who he really is—or what he is. Can she trust him?<br>  <br>  Uglies series by Scott Westerfeld<br>  It's hard to explain but it's about the future, after mankind basically destroyed the earth (global warming, destroying forests, polluting, etc) survivors made a new society where there's no argueing, war, etc. Everyone is considered "ugly" until they turn 16 and have this sugery that makes them "pretty" and they move to this part of town where all they do is have fun and party all day and night. Tally cant wait to turn pretty. She meets Shay who's a rebal and convinces Tally to leave the city for a night to see what's out in the wilderness. Tally learns all kinds of things about being pretty and the truth is.. it's not really pretty. EXTREMELY good, and the sequals are even better. It's full of adventures, cool technologies, romance, etc. <br>  <br>  The Hunger Games by Suzanne Collins<br>  This book is also set in the future and gets pretty intense. It's setting is in Panem, a city that's now in what's left of North America (which has become smaller after global warming and melting of the ice caps). Surrounding Panem are 12 districts where each year, one boy and girl between the ages of 12 and 18 are chosen to be in the Hunger Games where they are put into an arena and battle each other and try to survive until there's only one left and is the winner. There's also some romance in it. One of my favorite books<br>  <br>  Deadly Little Secrets by Laurie Stolarz<br>  It's the first of it's series and is also really good. It's about a girl named Camelia who lives a normal life - dating, has friends, decent grades. But, one day when she was picking an earing that she dropped crossing the street, a car was coming towards her and it wasn't stopping. Suddenly, a hot guy shoves her out of the way, saving her life. He left without her saying thank you or asking what his name was. Three months later, she's starting her junior year in high school and there's this rumor about a new guy named Ben who supposedly killed his girlfriend. Camelia doesn't believe in rumors and when she sees Ben, it's the guy who saved her life. She tries to talk to him but he ignores her at first, but later Ben begins touching her weirdly but Camilia only gets more drawn to him. She later finds out he's not ordinary. He can know the future or past of a person by touching a person and he senses that Camelia's in great danger. Really intense but good with a twisted love triangle.<br>  <br>  Kissed by an Angel by Elizabeth Chandler<br>  Well, it's kind of three books in one. It's suppose to be about this guy, Tristian, and this girl, Ivy, who are crazy about each other. Ivy also has this strong belief in angels (like a water angel, a death angel, etc) which Tristian doesn't believe at all. But one day, they get in a car accident and Tristian dies and Ivy's belief in angels die with him and Ivy feels as if she has lossed everything. But, Tristian is still there, protecting her as an angel. But the problem is, Ivy keeps doubting about angels so no matter what Tristian does to try to help her, he hurts her more and Ivy feels more alone. Tristian soon realizes that their car accident wasn't an accident and whoever killed Tristian is trying to kill Ivy but can he save her im time?|`|aBh7uZkuaa	Try Harry Potter-fantasy<br>  <br>  or the unfortunate events-average books basically <br>  <br>  neither with vampires!!<br>  <br>  seriously vampires are getting old if you're talking about twilight!!  ugh!! lol!!|`|03sZD5zUaa	I think that Tuck Everlasting is a great book, some parts sad, though.<br>  <br>  I also recommend The Shack and The Last Lecture, boo hoo, very very sad! ,(
1afbbdf95ac24d4f09b64f9e1a7930afaa	Take it to a professional and ask to have it set up. They know what they're doing and can set the right string height, eliminate fret buzz and intonate your guitar. It will probably cost around 50 bucks or so but will be well worth it. You should probably have it done about once a year or so. It will improve the performance of your guitar drastically and will make it sound and feel a lot better. You can also do some research online and learn how to do it, but in my opinion, its not worth it. You would need to buy tools and calibration things and you probably wouldn't be all that good at it for a while. I wouldn't take it to guitar center or sam ash. Go to a guitar shop in town. I'm not sure where you live, but ask other guitar players where they have their guitars set up.|`|hJP9y6kjaa	Even though you didn't change the gauge of the strings, the fact that they were new *is* something different.<br>  <br>  A floating trem depends on the pull of the springs matching the pull of the strings... and new strings have more tension than old strings... so your new strings aren't broken in yet, and have more tension than the springs are set up for.<br>  <br>  You can either adjust the springs to match this (but I wouldn't suggest it, since that might mean having to reintonate the guitar), or you can break the strings in. <br>  <br>  It's normal for it to take a few days for new strings to "settle in" when they first go into a floating trem.<br>  <br>  Bend the hell out of them, smack 'em a couple of times, make them call you daddy.

Eventually, you will find a publisher who likes your book and will publish it (don't get discouraged, this can take a while)<br>  5. Done!|`|8DwxwhStaa	I would recommend consulting this site and corresponding book.|`|UaCqYFKnaa	If you are looking for self-publishing companies to publish your book, I know of a few companies that practically holds court to everything a book needs from getting you your copyright, size preferences, book cover design customization, layout consultation, copyediting and even marketing – at affordable costs.<br>  <br>  The difference with self-publishing is that you happen to send in your materials to the publisher and they will do all the work for you depending on which program you are on. Publishing packages are very affordable and investing on getting your book published is a good start.<br>  <br>  Most self-publishing companies have programs that costs about $250 to $12999 and is highly dependent on the kind of services that you will be getting which is why it is very significant to carefully map out your book's budget as early as now.<br>  <br>  Publishing companies now have all the resources to publish books with the same productivity and efficacy as that of regular black and white books. Considering the fact that most books are in full color, you should choose a publishing company whose book’s are of the highest quality, bar none.<br>  <br>  Self-publishing entirely means that you get to retain full control of your book’s production and that it gives you the option to publish your work and claim authority of the photos that you have chosen to be published.<br>  <br>  Publishing is synonymous to getting that copyright for protecting your book which is why it is highly important to publish it.<br>  <br>  You can get free information sent to your mail here and even try to check the quality of their brochure because it is the same as how they publish books. The cost to publish is also listed in detail and in depth.<br>  <br>  I hope I helped.|`|gAWWyDLhaa	First, write your book.<br>  <br>  Edit your book several times to make it the best it can be, type it in proper manuscript form (visit <a href="http://www.writersdigest.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.writersdigest.com</a> to find out what is needed), consider joining a local writer's group to get feedback from other would-be writers, and get it proofread by someone who knows what they are doing (don't rely just on spellcheck). Edit it some more.<br>  <br>  There are a tiny number of publishers that accept unsolicited manuscripts (those that don't go through a literary agent), so getting an agent first is a really good idea.<br>  <br>  At the library or bookstore is Guide to Literary Agents, published by Writer's Digest, or Bowker's Literary Marketplace (or visit <a href="http://www.agentquery.com)." rel="nofollow">http://www.agentquery.com).</a> Look for agents that specialize in your genre, and are looking for new clients. Read, and follow, their submission guidelines. In those books will be something about writing a query letter, which is what you send to the agent, first. It's part synopsis of your book, and part explanation as to why your book deserves to be published. You have only that one-page letter to wow the agent, so take the time to make it a good one. Expect the whole process to take lots of time, and expect many rejections. When you are accepted by an agent, they will send your book to publishers, not you. The whole process is free, except for postage, until your book is bought by a publisher. That is when the agent gets their cut (usually 15%) of the money which would go to you.<br>  <br>  If you decide to self-publish, then you will pay (potentially up to a couple of thousand dollars, depending on which publisher you choose). Also, the marketing of your book is up to you. <br>  <br>  Good luck!
Yo3awDQmaa	These are my personal recommendations for books:<br>  (You can find my personal opinion of the one’s I’ve read at my blog CasCanRead.com)<br>  <br>  The House of Night series---It knocked me straight out of my Twilight obsession. Even though I am still hyped about the DVD and New Moon movie. The ending of the last book drove me nuts and I can't wait to find out what happens next.<br>   <br>  Vampire Academy series--I just finished this and I can't wait for the next one! It was awesome and totally made me cry like a million time and make me angry. It sure does keep you on your toes.<br>  <br>  Society of S—This book is very interesting. I believe it may be an adult book, but I’m not sure. It’s about a thirteen year old girl, but her vocabulary and English is advanced. It’s a good read though.<br>  <br>  The Morganville Vampire series—This series is pure amazingness. Love, Love, Love it! It’s really at a tie with House of Night with amazingness.<br>  <br>  Peeps—very interesting (in a guys point of view.)<br>  <br>  Someone Like You by Sarah Dessen—awesome book!<br>  <br>  The Gallagher Girls series is interesting...It's about a girl that goes to spy school. The first book is "I'd tell you I love you, but then I'd have to kill you".<br>  <br>  The two books I actually enjoyed reading in school were Speak and Holes. Speak is a really good book.<br>  <br>  A few other books I have read recently and enjoyed are: Kissing Kate, The Bermudez Triangle, and Empress of the World.<br>  <br>  Vampire Chronicles by Anne Rice.<br>  <br>  Some series that others have told me to read that are in the Young Adult/ Supernatural genre are: The Mortal Instruments series, Darkest Powers series,  Maxium Ride, Vampire Kisses series, The Vampire Diaries, The Uglies series, Chronicles of Narnia, Blue Bloods, Sookie Stackhouse series, and Sweep series.<br>  <br>  <br>  Then these more classical books: anything Jane Austen, To Kill a Mockingbird, Wuthering Heights, Great Expectations, Jane Eyre, Little Women, Odyssey, The Scarlet Letter, and Treasure Island. All of those are part of Barnes and Nobles Classic Collection.<br>  <br>  Any of these books listed can be found on Barnes and Noble to know what they are about.|`|SiPGcBnYaa	May-December??? ooh scandalous.<br>  <br>  what?|`|FF9mMlgKaa	when is someone going to say "I've read Crime and Punishment and now I'm looking for books with a damn point god dammit!"|`|nOtGVyTVaa	I'm not a Twilight fan, but the Luxe series by Anna Godbersen, it is somewhat like gossip girl, but it has a lot more substance, and is better written, and it takes place in the 1800's it is FULL of forbidden romances, and I highly reccomend it, the books in order are<br>  <br>  The Luxe<br>  Rumours<br>  Envy<br>  Splendor (the last in the series coming soon)<br>  <a href="http://theluxebooks.com/series.vm" rel="nofollow">http://theluxebooks.com/series.vm</a>|`|FNdsPNrJaa	Tamora Pierce writes some good ones.

Fans of the smart/chic horror typified by Buffy the Vampire Slayer will instantly fall for this new series."<br>  <br>  - Publishers Weekly<br>  <br>  "This urban fantasy series opener spices its fight against evil with sexual tension. Fifteen-year-old geek hipster Clary thought she was just a normal kid, but normal kids don't see invisible people, and normal kids' mothers don't suddenly disappear, seemingly captured by horrific monsters. But like many fantasy heroines, Clary isn't normal, and she's got all the secret parentage, dramatic revelations, and amazing magic powers to prove it....The story's sensual flavor comes from the wealth of detail: demons with facial piercings, diners serving locusts and honey, pretty gay warlocks, and cameo appearances from other urban fantasies' characters....Lush and fun."<br>  <br>  - Kirkus Reviews|`|BAkfz657aa	I read the twilight series too an her other books are pretty good check them out|`|US2C6izEaa	perks of being a wallflower

Whilst King Darius was able to flee with no more than 1,000 horsemen, his mother, wife, and children were taken prisoner".

fbKVq6Znaa	are you asking if theres a picture of ellen hopkin's daughter? ive read the book. and yes it is based on her family's personal battle against ''the monster''<br>  on the very second page, ellen hopkins states:<br>  while this work is fiction, it is loosely based on a very true story-- my daughter's. the monster did touch her life, and the lives of her family.....many of the characters are composites of real people. if they ring true, they should<br>  <br>  but i dont think there is any photo of her daughter posted online or anything and that it is a family's struggle, meant to be dealt with in private. her parents probably wouldnt want their recovering daughter revealed for all of her readers to scrutinize. i know if something like that were to happen to me i would be devastated and embaressed if i was being googled|`|KnaLy83Jaa	:O<br>  MY NAME'S KRISTINA! :DD<br>  <br>  but sorry i actually have no real answer to the question.|`|Ta7snyIoaa	It's not actually a "real" story.

Of course, it's visually stunning and you've got to hand it to them on some level because they've achieved something which nobody would have ever have thought possible - especially to a country as big as America. So on one level they kind of need congratulating, which a lot of people shy away from, which is a very dangerous thing."[22] <br>  The next week, following public outrage at his remarks, he issued a statement through his company, Science Ltd:"<br>  Here is another interesting bit- "In 1999, chef Marco Pierre White said Hirst's Butterflies On Mars had plagiarised his own work, Rising Sun, which he then put on display in the restaurant Quo Vadis in place of the Hirst work.[40]<br>  <br>  In 2000, Hirst was sued for breach of copyright over his sculpture, Hymn, which was a 20-foot (6.1 m), six ton, enlargement of his son Connor's 14" Young Scientist Anatomy Set, designed by Norman Emms, 10,000 of which are sold a year by Hull-based toy manufacturer Humbrol for ￡14.99 each.[20] Hirst paid an undisclosed sum to two charities, Children Nationwide and the Toy Trust in an out-of-court settlement,[20] as well as a "good will payment" to Emms.[40] The charitable donation was less than Emms had hoped for. Hirst also agreed to restrictions on further reproductions of his sculpture.[20]"

AA11219693	This is all about life here, and although this philosophy section, and I am one of the top contributors here, this is not really all about philosophy. It is about people. You can by all means ask purely academic questions the ones that appear to be pulled out some textbook, but the response you will get in return might not be overwhelming.    I personally do not know much about philosophy as academic subject. I know this that philosophy for start to end is all about life, but I do not think I would be able to cope if ideas were not instantiated and supported by instances and examples of realistic happenings of life that you and me live in, that you and me share with countless other people on this planet.     I do not really know what representative realism. It does sound intriguing, I admit. And, yes, why is it so significant in philosophy? I would like to know myself. I would like to know as if it is significant in philosophy then how significant it could be in my life? How can a knowledge and understanding of the concept of representative realism make my life a better, a happier and more successful one?     I do not speak for everyone else but I think this would be the intention of the most of the people present here. I believe most people would come here to talk about their lives, their views and opinions. In this much-troubled world, life is one thing common among all human beings, and we all love life. We are here to enrich our minds, to warm our hearts, by the mentions and concerns of each other. We come here to realise that we are like each other more ways than we are different.     If you could make your questions a little more interesting, and lot more t easier for, for instance me, to relate to, then I might be able to give you a better answer. You can relate to the matter of the question personally first, and then ask question that you come by thereupon.|`|145c8348c6805dffd8ad539dedd6effbaa	A new one on me.
tXUbPw7Faa	Brave New World is definitely better for younger readers--it's easier to comprehend (or to understand the main point).  Anthem is better for those who have a basic understanding of philosophical topics and who have developed higher critical thinking skills.    Like the person above me said, Rand tends to be a bit drier in her writing (although I find I feel more fulfilled after finishing a work of hers).  However, both books are highly worth reading and each holds many important things to say.  So...read both!  But BNW first, then Anthem.  :D|`|73760ec70f62b217eab4a5ab28ce822baa	Brave New World; more interesting and a better read. I find Ayn Rand's writing to be very dry.|`|wHmgVhphaa	Personally I prefer 'Anthem'.  Huxley makes the protagonist a victim who is so screwed up by a screwed up society that he takes what I would consider unhealthy measures to free himself.  In 'Anthem' the protagonist is strong, always maintains his strength (even in the face of some pretty serious opposition) and follows his own strong heart all the way through to the end, making strong healthy decisions the whole way.      Honestly it's just that I prefer Rand.  She's the most inspirational writer I've ever read, and I doubt that will change in my lifetime.

sI3BVNlFaa	Why not do a surreal landscape?  Try adding objects or shapes into the landscape.  For example why not put a profile of a face into a cliff or in a tree.  Have a forest of green pencils or lollipops and an blue tie that morphs into a river...that sort of thing.  It's fun to experiment with different crazy ideas.  It doesn't matter if it doesn't make sense, just be imaginative.    You can also make it as bold or subtle as you like.

WpbpypKCaa	Firstly, as a beginner you don't need Photoshop CS3 !*!*@&!?@!     ...and really it depends on the type of art you want to do,. Photoshop, PRIMARILY is for the manipulation of photos!! (though yes yes, its not limited to this...) but my point is, you might want to do some more research and I dunno maybe check out a demo for say, Painter or Illustrator....also given your example link, I'd suggest you try to scan in YOUR original art / line drawing,. copy it,. doing the outlines, then use your talents to fill in, shading, colours,. etc etc...  ((I would imagine this is a long, slow progress-type of hard work!!)) then post up your results on something like say Deviant Art and get some good peer-assessment-feedback...     You might also want to do some more research via **artists** that you admire or on ***animee/manga-type-dedicated sites***...as I am sure they'd have better advice!!!     Good luck,. enjoy,.    =)
Kl4kv5khaa	From an artist perspective, interesting, but manipulated by society.To understand why Dante wrote the book is to compare life like Bush and the media since 2001. They wished to lead by fear of what could happen so the people would allow those "in charge" to have control and power over them. That is why the church, is linked to hell more than to heaven or even God.|`|x8A8DnpPaa	Fiction|`|SzAihp3Oaa	amazing....reading about the different levels of hell, it is very intriguing! if you have not read it, do so. one of the few books ive read and enjoyed|`|yOK32PM9aa	A divine comedy.|`|db479662109a13fa062d0f7c3ccf7629aa	Technically it's called an allegory.  Dante is attempting to find God but gets sidetracked by people in hell.  I think it's interesting that the Ninth Circle of Hell is ice, rather than fire.  Fire is passionate. Love. Hate.  Ice is cold. Indifferent  Hell is ice.
yE81qpcraa	I completed my AS Photography last year with an A grade and believe me, although technicality is important, A-Levels in general are more theory rather than practical so make sure you do lots and lots of artist / photographer research! Evaluate every image you've used in your research - noting significant points which can be used in your final images. It is very important you make specific links to the artists who have inspired your photographs and explain why. You'll be hitting a gold mine of marks when you do that.    Of course, make sure your final images are presented excellently - but also evaluate them well too! Always make links back to your research.|`|j5Apt8hWaa	Only your instructor can know that.    Most give you the criteria used in deciding grades.    Some grade your work on a 50% for technical excellence and 50% on your creativity.    If there was any outside assignments such as critiquing a photo exhibition or turning in a journal done while completing your photo assignments, the too will be considered in determining your "best mark"    I guess the rule could be, "Always do your best" and remember presentation is key to any visual art's success
AA11712689	The others were correct in their answers, I just wanted to add that with the events that happened over her marriage and exile from Henry the 8th was pretty much the START of the War of Christian Religion (don't go looking up that term, I made it up, but it was a very REAL event. AND I MEANT "WAR" NOT REFORMATION....AS IN PEOPLE KILLING ONE ANOTHER FOR BEING ONE OR THE OTHER RELIGION. "Reformation" was a social, political, academic, and religous event that is really too broad to be discuss w/ a question about Catheirne of Aragon).    It caused the on going animosity between the Protestant and the Catholic Churches, which caused all kind of problems all over Europe.  People all over the world slowly began to stand against the RIGHTS of the Catholic Church that had held this Immense power over the people of Europe for so long. It was a problem that can still be seen today in Northern Ireland.    It was basically the catalyst that began the WAR between England and Spain.    It was also the catalyst that began the on going  "toughest-kid-in-the-neighborhood" between England and Spain.    It eventually forced England, a BROKE country when Elizabeth took the throne, into gear that eventually made it the most powerful country in the world.    Spain and England began to constantly try to out do one another ..... including the BIGGEST outcome of it all ..... the colonization of America! England figured if Spain could go over there and make money, so could England. And the race for colonization of the Americas began.    As we now see, England won.    But it ALL started when Henry the 8th married then exiled Catherine of Aragon.  If that had never happened, we would be a very different world today indeed.  Just goes to show you how one little event can change the world.      EDIT    Folks, alow me to introduce you to Yahoo Answerer BILL P !

He will slip up and Yahoo will suspend him, then he comes back to his little games.....which is to baffle the questioners with PAGE LONG explainations of COMPLETE BS.....all while OPENLY picking out one or two answerers and INSULTING them, question after question after question.  This is the second one in two days from Billy-Boy to me.    He is easy to pick out because he never changes his "game or style", just his "name". He is an expert on just about everything from Cajun History to traditonal Native American meals....even though he has never stepped foot off the island.  He also will NEVER add source references, because he has none.    Don't get me wrong, the kid should be a writer, has an incredible imagination, and a gift of BS that is amazing.    Just keep in mind someone that goes around purposely INSULTING other answerers & never leaves references is a BS artist.    Just don't make the little boy anrgy, he will follow you around like a rabid little leg humping dog until he get suspended once again. Sooner or later Yahoo will simply suspend his account and we will all finally be rid of him.|`|31420ed41c716cbb02addca8d450fc2eaa	The others were correct in their answers, I just wanted to add that with the events that happened over her marriage and exile from Henry the 8th was pretty much the START of the War of Christian Religion (don't go looking up that term, I made it up, but it was a very REAL event).  --------------------------------------...    The person who wrote that knows just enough to mess up a good grade in school.  Henry VIII was not the "start" of the "Christian Religion" (her term), that was going pretty strongly in Germany and Switzerland as well as other places.  Catherine was "exiled?"  She was not allowed to come into the King's court.  She was not sent out of England.      What the writer means is that Henry VIII started the English Reformation, not the Reformation, that was there before Henry ever thought about it.  Basically the cause of Henry's problems with Catherine was that she had been married to Henry's brotherefore he died (though never consumated) something that Henry felt was illegal. Henry sought divorce, but the Pope would not allow it, so he had her confined to quarters and set about manipulations to arrange it so that he could divorce her.    --------------------------------------...  It caused the on going animosity between the Protestant and the Catholic Churches, which caused all kind of problems all over Europe.  People all over the world slowly began to stand against the RIGHTS of the Catholic Church that had held this Immense power over the people of Europe for so long. It was a problem that can still be seen today in Northern Ireland.  --------------------------------------...    I would stand with the concept that the English Reformation might be a root cause of the problems in Ireland,but they happened quite a bit later.  King James I moved protestant Scots into Ireland for the pupose of diluting the Catholic influence in Northern Ireland.  This is the King James I that of King James Bible fame.  He is a couple of monarchs removed from Henry VIII  --------------------------------------...  It was basically the catalyst that began the WAR between England and Spain.

But it ALL started when Henry the 8th married then exiled Catherine of Aragon.  If that had never happened, we would be a very different world today indeed.  Just goes to show you how one little event can change the world  --------------------------------------...  I could suggest a myriad of books for the young lady who wrote one of the replies, but she is not completely right.  This is one of the basic problems when you go to a public venue to ask questions of "peers."  You have no idea who is giving you the answer and whether or not it is partially correct, totally correct, or outright wrong.  You can get better answers for the most part from googling Henry VIII and the Catherine of Aragon.  The English Reformation is a complex issue.  In reality, Henry did little more than both France and Spain had done in the previous century by removing some of the powers of the Catholic Church and basically nationalizing their countries.  Henry set himself up as the head of the Church of England and it follows today that Elizabeth II is now head of the Church of England.|`|NmV5XWlJaa	I would say she's directly responsible for her daughter Mary's attempt to bring back Catholicism to England after the deaths of Henry and Edward. And as you probably know, it was a lost cause.

While she was in favor, she engineered the promotion of her parent's policies in England, had Spaniards and the men who married her friends from Spain elevated, and backed treaties that benefited her family. Once she was out of favor, she became the figurehead of the Pro-Catholic factions in England and most of Europe. Even after her death, Mary I used her mother's image and reputation to promote her own goals - although she didn't seem to have either her mother's famed virtues or intelligence.
AA11712689	Yes, it's true to some extent, the two parties kind of switched their "roles"..... as did the American people.   But you have to remember, what was once CONSIDERED "liberal" is now considered more conservative.  Times change, people change, economies change, therefore IDEAS change and it makes it seem that the two parties certainly did "switch sides".    Let's take the issue of water conservation for instance. Once upon a time water conservation was a radical idea.  Fresh water was everywhere, why worry about it was the idea of the more "conservative" Democrates, they had better things to worry about.  Whereas controling water, building dams, water distribution, keeping that water clean, protecting the rights of the water property, etc was a Republican idea.  A very "Liberal" idea for the people of that time.  If you look closely, some of that stuff DOES look "conservative" showing that the IDEAS of the people have changed.    So, it was just as much a fact that the ideas on what was conservative and what was liberal seemed to have "switched sides" as it was the idea that the political parties of Republican and Democrat switched sides.    That was just a more simplified answer, the biggest changes within the two parties were in states rights, slavery / human rights, commerce, the power of the gov't versus the power of the states as individuals, and later on down the road with voting rights, first with African Americans then with women.  Hope this gives you  better idea.|`|nBGjPwViaa	I believe that, yes, in some ways, the parties have flipped their stands  on certain issues.

1hvrQYWiaa	The main feature of concentric castles was a series of circular walls, each inside another. Circular walls eliminated corners, which were more susceptible to mining and breaching by besiegers, and provided a fall back position - the next wall - if the outer one fell. Many such castles had a large tower in the middle (called a donjon) as a final bastion of defence.<br>   As all castles were built primarily for defence, armouries, workshops, storehouse and so on would have been contained inside the walls. As the Lord of the castle and his family lived there, there were also living quarters (usually in the donjon).<br>   There would also have been a gate tower in the outer wall, flanked by towers and secured by a drawbridge and portcullis. Very often there would be a defensive ditch dug around the outside of the outer wall, and occasionally a moat.|`|H2bFiDNAaa	I had to do a similar assignment about a week ago.

dXW9cPWMaa	I think that there need to be major steps taken to move into the digital age (with the rest of the world), but I think it will take more than a few pushes to make them really fall.<br>  <br>  Do you read agent and editor blogs? Just curious. They address this topic often.<br>  <br>  Even as we speak, though, the big publishers are taking great strides to prevent this. Right now they're having to cut people right and left to make ends meet, which is so terribly unfortunate, but they're going to come back up. We're all learning that there is going to be much more to the book world than physical books in the very near future, and with the advent of ereaders this is becoming an ever-present reality. However, they're starting to embrace this. Ebooks are becoming a new standard for publishers, just as film companies are starting to sell digital copies with the DVDs/Bluerays.<br>  <br>  I predict that within the next two years, we'll see much more digital publishing from the big publishers. They'll adapt, and quickly. It's going to take more than a new way to make oodles of money to take them down.<br>  <br>  It is going to make authors' work different. Publishers are going to have to tackle the beast of making sales when it's so easy to put stories up online.<br>  <br>  I feel melodramatic saying this, but I think everything about the publishing industry is going to change in the next ten years. It's going to get uprooted and turned into an entirely new industry. I'm personally thrilled about going into an industry that's going to have to be on the edge of innovation, and I can't wait to see where it goes.<br>  <br>  EDIT<br>  I hope not to offend, but in my opinion, the publishing industry has desperately held onto the statement that Bolt has made. They insist that real books will always be the standard and that ebooks are a passing fad. I respectfully disagree. Everything is going digital now, as much as everyone, including myself, hates to admit it.<br>  <br>  It would be wonderful if physical books could remain forever, but this isn't going to happen. The older generations will stick to physical books, but even children now are much more interested in technology than in collecting books. I'm only 10 years older than my little brother and he has already mastered the home computer and saved up his money to buy an iPod touch.<br>  <br>  I don't mean to shoot anyone down, honestly, but I just can't agree that books will remain the gold standard for new generations, not with the growth of ereaders. The Kindle 2, while still not ideal, is a vast improvement over the first, and I predict ereaders will become more like physical books and more desirable even within the next year.|`|f4Nn0W1xaa	I'm not convinced that the big publishers will be closed out, at least not most of them. I think it's quite likely that what will happen is that the digital market will continue to grow and many of its early problems will begin to be resolved. As that happens its reputation with both the traditional industry and with the reading public will improve. Once it can be seen as a true competitor then I think the big guys will scurry to catch up. I would venture to guess that most of them are keeping a pretty close eye on the situation even now. <br>  <br>  The minute that some true breakout event occurs in this area, whether that's an epublisher who does everything right and ends up with a massive digital only success (that isn't erotica), or a reader device that everyone not only wants but can also afford, along with the books themselves, or a major author jumping ship, that's the day that Bertelsmann will prove that they've been watching all along.<br>  <br>  I suppose it is conceivable that they could wait too long and find themselves in a position similar to car manufacturers but I don't really believe that will happen because this is a much simpler set of changes for them to make. It isn't as if it has to be a total revamp, from the ground up.<br>  <br>  Personally, I hope they do rest on their laurels a little longer. I would like to see a fresh approach from someone young and unjaded by years of the status quo. I think a shakeup would be a good thing and I'm unimpressed by the way traditional publishing has dealt with recent challenges. I think they're due for a little slapping around and if some new literary stars are born in the process then that's all to the good too.|`|AA10635683	Yeah -- it will be mainly digital, but I see it being done by authors themselves.  Publishers and agents are a de facto screening device, and something's going to have to fill that gap.  Perhaps some sort of review board, with room for appeals.<br>  Lower price, but more sales for that reason.|`|8asG4WCwaa	I know more people who do NOT have an iPod than ones who do.  It didn't become  "the standard" overnight.  Neither did the CD or walkman, or 8track.  People eventually had to adjust to the new technologies as the affordability made it possible.<br>  <br>  As we are already seeing with the internet and self publishing, every nobody out there will be able to epublish, no matter how bad the writing is. The digital publishers will not have much to loose in marketing poor quality work.<br>  <br>  The big publisher have already gotten into digital publishing, as seen in the electronic edition rights of their contracts.  They are stupid.<br>  <br>  I believe that people who really enjoy reading will still prefer books, and quality writing will be well worth the expense.  It will becaome the standard of excellance when a publisher puts your title out in print and those who can afford it, will buy printed books.  It will be the difference between  a fine wine and a corner store wine cooler.<br>  <br>  I also believe, with the tendancy of students to use digital technology, that printed textbooks are likelly to disappear.  Whether or or not they'll be more affordable or not is still a  mystery...
draNVjbkaa	Mavrick is a very good commercial agency in LA. They're in the top 50. <br>  <br>  If you're getting a callback, that means they like you and possibly want to offer you representation.|`|eulMjLtPaa	In LA? It's fairly new.

PTdy6TWRaa	Use acrylic paint as it is fully permanent when dry. Work on a 100% cotton or poly/cotton blend shirt if possible.<br>  <br>  Help the kids cover their hands or feet with paint and then press them onto the shirt to make the print. Practice this maneuver on paper first a few times to get the hang of it.  <br>  <br>  Make sure you have some good layers of newspaper or something inside the shirt so the paint from one side doesn't bleed through to the other.<br>  <br>  Let the paint dry fully before attempting to handle the shirt too much. Leave that paper inside the shirt while it's drying.<br>  <br>  When the paint is fully dry it will be permanent so the shirt can be washed normally.|`|iWJAG8HGaa	Maybe you can also let them paint their name on it 2...

MyUi3Blyaa	It depends on you.<br>  They are great fun but these days the drugs have to get past the sniffer dogs so if you do get any drugs like ecstacy, then you'll be paying top dollar.<br>  I would focus more on the drink plenty of water and take in lollies to keep your energy up. <br>  It's a good idea to eat really well the day before the event and have a decent breakfast in the morning.<br>  When you get in it's time to party. Make sure you get at least one friend to hook up with you at the end of the rave otherwise you will be vulnerable to seedy creepy types.<br>  The promoters should have a variety of entertainment sites as well some outrageous stunts being performed during the event.<br>  Drugs are not the drawcard, the people are and the music. If you have this as your priority you won't be disappointed:)|`|4dgrwFU4aa	Blow pops, those suckers with gum in the center.

Avoid this rave, and all raves. Seriously, if you want to get high or whatever, go cut yourself. Or much better!, find a hobby or something that makes you feel that way, like for me it would be performing:) But I and probably a lot of others are begging you not to go! What if you end up pregnant?! What are you gonna do then? Yeah, think twice about this and look at your future.|`|Qx2QH8MHaa	ok, the most important thing is to have fun! the music is great and it flows through you making you want to dance.

UsTyc0oeaa	Two books by Mark Stolzenberg can help you get started:  "How to Be Really Funny" and "Clowning for Circus and Stage".  He also has another book called "Be a Clown" which is very good.  (I'm not Mark, and I don't get a commission from his book sales!  They're just very good books.)<br>  <br>  Clowning is not all about big shoes and makeup.  Real clowning is all about character development, physical comedy, slapstick comedy, and pathos.  I'm leaving out quite a bit more for simplicity's sake, but you'll get my drift... it's all in those Charlie Chaplin films you mentioned!<br>  <br>  Some of the best clowns in the world wear no makeup.  Other, equally talented clowns, wear full makeup and wardrobe.  But they all have the same characteristics in common.  I could tell you what they are, but you wouldn't lean as much as if you watch them and figure it out for yourself.  It'll be a great excuse for you to justify watching a bunch of old movies and TV shows!<br>  <br>  Good luck!

Tara Flynn by Geraldine O'Neill<br>  It's the 1950s and for Tara Flynn, red-haired, bright and ambitious, Ballygrace House represents everything she hopes for - beautiful, elegant and a world away from the little village where she lives with her grandfather. But the wealthy Fitzgeralds who live at Ballygrace have little time for village girls, until Madeleine, their unstable, delicate daughter, meets Tara. Tara is everything Madeleine isn't, yet the two girls find themselves becoming firm friends. When Tara meets Gabriel, Madeleine's older brother, she becomes painfully aware of the differences between the Fitzgeralds and the Flynns. Without a wealthy family behind her, Tara will have to work her way to the life she dreams of.

You've probably just come across the sarcastic troublemakers and those who honestly hate the books.  Also be careful just because a person is being mean on a Twilight post doesn't mean they actually dislike the books.  A lot of people, even Twilight fans, are getting annoyed because the repetitive and obnoxious nature of Twihard (or twitards as the haters have deemed them) postings.  I'm not a fan of the books, but I can say that you aren't alone.|`|tTLg4u9laa	The English used in the book and entire series is very very poor in quality and the only reason people call it so "great" is the trendiness of an average teenage girl falling in to forbidden love with a vampire.  <br>  There is nothing "great"about this work of fiction.   <br>  Compare it to a truly great work of dark fiction such as, say, Frankenstein, and you will see the difference in language alone separates the two.  <br>  <br>  Too bad this is the level of "greatness" we as a society now judge Literature on.  <br>  <br>  I read through all the books only so I could write a scathing review of just how low the literature bar has been lowered to for such a work.|`|CblODn2Kaa	No.<br>  <br>  Plot- There is none. 90% of the book is devoted to how beautiful and effervescent Edward is, the other 10% is Bella whining about her life.<br>  Grammar- The grammar in the book is horrid. I couldn't believe some of the sentences her editor let through.<br>  "I began to be nervous that we would not make it out."<br>  "He scrutinized for my expression."<br>  SM clearly doesn't know what half the polysyllabic words she uses mean, and it makes her sound stupid.<br>  Lack of interesting characters- All the characters are Mary/Gary Sues, and it's really boring to read about people with cookie-cutter personalities. Bella is supposed to be all plain and boring, yet all the guys at her school like her. Huh?<br>  Anti-feminist tone- This is the one that pisses me off the most. Bella is completely submissive. She does all the cooking and cleaning for her father. Her life revolves around Edward, and she gives up an education, her family, her friends, and any future she would've had without Edward to be with him. The message of the books is- don't worry, you don't need a job with a man to take care of you!<br>  Abusive relationships- Edward frequently reminds Bella that he can kill her. He's controlling and manipulative, and Bella submits to whatever he says (see above paragraph). I wouldn't have a problem with this if the books actually made it seem like their relationship was bad, but instead, their sick, twisted "romance" is made to seem all cute and healthy. It's sick.|`|dXs0A2xlaa	WORST MOVIE/ BOOK OF MY LIFE!|`|6gWtdqICaa	Yes. I have to admit, I do love the Twilight series.

Satanists and many pagan cultures from every corner of the world all throughout history have celebrated this like the Sumerians, Babylonians, Cherokee, Hopi, Chinese I-Ching (confirmed by Terence McKenna), Mayans (Pacal Votan; Chilam Balam of Tizimin, Mani, Chumayel; Jaguar Prophet), Egyptians, Celts, etc. This evil event is called "the abomination that causes desolation" that will be set up in the Jewish Temple's Holy of Holies when the antichrist is imbued with the spirit of satan himself.

With regards to training, a lot of the top commercial agencies want to see a good COMMERCIAL CLASS, IMPROV CLASS, and a COLD READING CLASS on your resume.<br>  <br>  Yes, SAG commercials, especially nationals (shown in the whole U.S.), pay significantlly more than non-union commercials.

uqb7dkBbaa	This is a case where things are not really clear as Jews are supposedly both an ethnicity and a religion. <br>  In most places Jews did not become citizens of the countries they lived in until the 18th century, when Napoleon granted the French ones French citizenship and forced the invaded countries to do the same (those laws were quickly canceled in those countries once Napoleon was beaten but were reinstated later). There were also plenty of laws putting them aside, and they lived in closed communities without trying to mix with outside people. That image of the stateless Jew living aside stayed in the general mindset which made things easier for the Nazis when they went after the Jews in occupied Europe.  <br>    <br>  So in the mind of many people during the Holocaust Jews were not really citizens but both an ethnicity and a religion even though you could not at first look differentiate a German or Polish or French Jew from a German, Polish or French non Jew. You and I would call them Polish, but many Poles at that time would have called them Jews and not really Poles just on the basis of their religion. Never mind that they lived just like them in the house next door. So the Nazis were not going after Poles, they were going after Jews.|`|GdXOjRNmaa	Many Jews killed in the Holocaust were Polish, Jews from all over Nazi occupied Europe were killed in the death camps. To the Nazis, Jews were a race & considered to be subhuman.|`|AA11304025	The jews always kept themselves separate from their fellow citizens in other countries and did not integrate as they wish to keep themselves racially pure.|`|H2bFiDNAaa	just because someone's Polish doesn't mean they can't be Jewish so I'm sure there were Polish Jews. There were Polish Catholics; I know a priest who is Polish if that makes any difference...|`|7lKBt4Mzaa	First understand that Poland should not be defined by a religion.  It was not so heavily Catholic as to be considered a Catholic country, nor was it a Protestant country.  It certainly could not be called a Jewish country.  The Jews had no country until it was created in 1948.<br>  <br>  However, Poland was the first European nation that Germany simply overran and as a result many of its citizens were killed in the Nazi death camps.  If they conformed to Hitler's idea of a Master Race, then they were spared.  Of the groups that were targeted for eradication, Jews and Gypsies did not possess the physical characteristics of the Aryan race, whatever you thought of their beliefs.  They were not blonde haired and blue eyed; they were dark skinned, dark haired and dark eyed (ironically, much like Hitler himself) And intellectuals and homosexuals were eliminated due to their threat to the Master Race's way of thinking and unquestioning devotion to its ideals.|`|PkKxzxwVaa	In all, if you were either you would be killed. The Germans did not just target Jews (but that was the main target). They targeted other such as Gypsies, disabled, and POLISH. So yes, the Polish were included on there list of those they "hated". So it didn't matter. If you were either you would get sent to the concentration camps. <br>  <br>  If you were both.. that's double the hatred. So you would probably be treated even worse. <br>  <br>  And to top off it for your answer. Yes, there was and are Jews in Poland. There are Jews in many places. It's a religion. However, they were a minority unlike to Catholics.|`|2f7881b6eca5299515f3da1bd060562daa	Many Jewish people immigrated to Poland years before WW2...... The Holocaust refers to the jewish race wherever they lived..... a lot of the horrific killings happened to be in Poland. A lot of Jewish people living in Poland do call themselves Polish Jews because They do not want to separate themselves from their country nor their heritage.......It goes even deeper but I am not qualified to answer further.........The whole thing is just a huge blot on mankind ( I know, not on everybody ).|`|RSUYs8Mzaa	The Holocaust specifically targeted individuals of the Jewish ethnicity, killing about six million from across Europe including Poland, which had a substantial number. There is a significant difference between nationality and ethnicity, however; most Chinese people in America would probably report their race as Chinese, but their nationality as American.|`|UZHMxvHWaa	I'm pretty sure it's both.  Just because someone was a citizen of Poland didn't mean they weren't considered a jew.|`|AA11280073	Jewish people are not a race. It is a religion. All Jews were rounded up systematically and were sent to concentration camps where they were murdered.  Even people with some trace of Jewish backgrounds were killed. Some of the worst concentration camps were in Poland and the Polish people helped the Nazis kill Jews. It is a terrible history.|`|94bc2dec827aab848ba69cb5895f7ba6aa	Most Jewish Holocaust victims were Polish Jews.

I usually give them commission or part of the profit for example 10% for every book I sell with their help.. <br>  <br>  it's an easier and fun way of selling books since I'm more secure that the person I'm selling the book/s to won't ditch me since they are people who my friends know personally.. (=<br>  <br>  another option would be a garage sale.. if your neighbors holding one.. try asking them if you can also sell your books there.. A lot of people visit garage sales with cash ready in their pockets.. (=<br>  <br>  good luck selling your books!
