YdXhZka8aa	Here, I changed/added some punctuation.  Some of it is grammatically incorrect but as you didn't ask about that, I left it like it is.    I was slowly pecking while I typed then I got a great email, clicked reply, started answering back and apparently I suddenly was typing faster than a speeding bullet. I was enjoying writing it so much I didn't realize how fast I was typing until from down the hall I heard "holy cow she got excited over something!" after I began laughing I heard "something got her all excited, you got typing so fast your going to blow yourself out the window!" By then i was roaring and it continued "pretty soon her keyboard will be smokin!".
HkMhWvtgaa	First, think about your own life, especially your frustrations.  Take out a sheet of paper and write at the top:  I WANT TO STOP BEING CONTROLLED BY . . .  Then, about halfway down, write . . . SO THAT I CAN . . .    Hopefully, this will inspire you to list what and/or whom you wish to become independent of.  School deadlines?  Peer pressure?  Your parent's expectations?  Your fears of the future?  Name as many as you can, being as specific as possible.  On the bottom half of the paper, write the things you would do, if you were free of the things on top.  Spend more time with your friends?  Develop your abilities?  Travel the world?    Then, read through the text of the Declaration of Independence.  On a different sheet of paper, write down the key sentences from the Declaration, but leave blank spaces where some of the specific issues are written into it. (It is all right to abbreviate, because you will need to rewrite it after you finish.) Read through your rewritten Declaration.  Can you imagine something going into each blank space so that it speaks about your own concerns, instead of the colonists'?  Pick the items off the other sheet that seem to give you the most to put into the blank spaces.  It would be best if you could pick one item from the top half and one item from the bottom half so that the entire sentence says something that is true for you, such as I WANT TO STOP BEING CONTROLLED BY the fashion police at school SO THAT I CAN wear the kind of clothes I like instead of the ones everyone else likes.  Okay, that one might be a little TOO specific.  You might want to use clothes as one example of peer pressure that stops you from being yourself.  Whatever you choose, it should be something that's a real issue in your own life.    Does that help?|`|Irr5ftN7aa	The timetable of events leading up to the Revolutionary War (i.e. Boston Tea Party, Quartering Act, Proclamation of 1763, Stamp Act, etc), were examples of overexerting control and subsequent rebellion. If you think of the American Revolution as a parent trying to restrain an out of control teenager, it will make much more sense...     As the colonies became more self-sufficient, they became less dependent on England. They wanted to make their own laws and have their own sovereignty, but the British weren't going to have that happen.     After the war ended with an American victory, the Second Continental Congress adopted the Declaration of Independence (primarily written by Thomas Jefferson). This declared our Independence from Britain.    I think it would be neat if you wrote your paper declaring your independence from your parents if you are a teenager. State your reasons (you don't want someone watching everything you do, you don't want someone invading your space, you don't want someone charging you more more money for things and putting greater restrictions on your freedom). Even if its not the case, it would be a compelling paper if structured correctly. Just continue to reference the events leading up to the Revolution, and the rebellion of the Colonies against their "parents," the British.    Good Luck!

EeArGfskaa	As you look into more about TFA - you will find out a few things. First and foremost it is for people who already know they want a career in education. They have quite a few filters - and one of them is to weed out people who hint at some of the things you state in your question.    I know this is probably not what you were looking for - but from someone who has dealt with TFA for years - im just letting you know their focus.    Those who have a negative view of TFA in my area call it teach-for-awhile. (Im not one of them) This has been a stinging mark - that the program actively tries to get away from - they weed out people who are looking to do two years then grad school.    So good luck with your future - but I can tell you that I think they are looking for people who want to be in schools for longer periods.

ahjqc9Ifaa	Lots and lots of people go to college without a clue what they want to study, or do with their lives. Others go firmly believing they want to study a particular field and make it their life's work, only to find it's not what they imagined, or that something else was far more interesting.    Go. Be thinking of the future and your need for a job, but also take classes simply because they interest you. A broad-based education never hurt anybody, and a degree in an unrelated field is all it takes to get your foot in the door at some jobs.    I read some interesting statistics only yesterday. Census figures reveal that high school graduates average $27,000 a year income. College graduates average $47,000 a year. Those with advanced degrees average $61,300 a year.    So if you're thinking of your future, you really should go to college even if you don't know what to study there.

0eQt44CLaa	Do a little brainstorming before your interview. Most people have a wealth of transferable skills under their belts that they don't even realize they possess. Transferable skills are just that---skills that are transferable and applicable to what you might be doing in your next job. They are what employers are looking for more and more in potential employees. They are skills that you've accumulated throughout your life in settings such as jobs, education, parenting and childcare, hobbies, sports, clubs, etc.    At the core of transferable skills are three kinds: technical, data, and people skills. Technical skills refer to your knowledge of technology like computer programs or learning management systems, or more practical technology skills like the ability to construct or repair. Data skills refers to things like good record keeping, performing research, organizing a classroom learning system, or detailed analysis-writing. And people skills communication, leadership, coaching and training.     But a broader classification of transferable skills includes 5 sub-sets: communication; researching and planning; human relations; organization, management and leadership; and work survival.     1. Communication skills: writing concisely, speaking effectively, expressing ideas, facilitating group discussion, providing appropriate feedback, negotiating, perceiving nonverbal messages, persuading, reporting information, describing feels, interviewing, and editing.     2. Researching and planning skills: forecasting and predicting, creating ideas, identifying and solving problems, imagining alternatives, identifying resources, gathering information, setting goals, extracting important information, defining needs, analyzing, and developing evaluation strategies.    3. Human relations skills: developing rapport, being sensitive, listening, conveying feelings, providing support for others, motivating, sharing credit, counseling, cooperating, delegating with respect, representing others, perceiving feelings and situations, and asserting oneself.     4. Organization, management and leadership skills: initiating new ideas, handling details, coordinating tasks, managing groups, delegating responsibility, conducting a learning system, coaching, counseling, promoting change, selling ideas or products, decision making with others, and managing conflict.     5. Work survival skills: implementing decisions, cooperating, enforcing policies, being punctual, managing time, attending to detail, meeting goals, enlisting help in a project or learning system, accepting responsibility, setting and meeting deadlines, organizing, and making decisions.     Some transferable skills are more tangible than others. While it may be difficult in a half hour interview to demonstrate your full range of skills, such as your ability to manage time, motivate coworkers, or coordinate tasks, many technical skills are easy to confirm. They look and sound especially nice on resumes and during interviews.     Before your interview, take out a piece of paper and make a mind map of your experiences that helped you develop some of the above skills. When you understand your strengths, you'll feel more confident in whatever is asked during your competence-based interview. Best of luck!
ENJ0bY48aa	It varies on the setting.  Nurses don't always draw blood.    A phlebotomist can draw blood.  That is what they are trained for. The training is very short (usually 1-2 semesters). Medical Assistants can also draw blood.  They can get a 1 year certificate or a 2 year associates degree.  A Licensed Practical Nurse can draw blood.  That is a 1 year certificate program.  A Registered Nurse can draw blood.  That is a 2 year associates or a 4 year bachelors degree.    An RN has the most autonomy, skills, knowledge, and room for advancement.  They care for patients in all areas of medicine and can get a masters degree to be a nurse practitioner.  An LPN is also a nurse but is much more restricted than an RN in terms of what they can do.  A medical assistant typically will do small things in a doctors office in both the front and back office.  A phlebotomist just draws blood and will sometimes take urine and stool samples too.
yBJLYWUuaa	this is a linear system  you can graph both lines and see where the intercept or make an equation for both and then solve it for a point that can solve both equations. I'm going to use the subsitution method    x=steak  y=chicken    x+y=6   17x+14.80y=91     x+y=6  get one of the 2 variables alone on one side. I'm doing it for x  x=-y+6  since thats what y is in terms of x, subsitute that for x in the other equation  17(-y+6)+14.80y=91  distribute the 17  -17y+102+14.80y=91  combine like terms  -2.2y+102=91  subtract 102  -2.2y=-11  divide by 102 now you have y alone  y=5  because before you got y in terms of x you know that x is equivalent to negative y + 6. now we have y (5) so subsitute that in to get x  x=-(5)+6  simplify  x=1  now you have x=1 and y=5. you know y is chicken and x is steak so theres your answer! (1 person got steak 5 people got chicken)  you can plug in x and y in both quations and make sure its right  x+y=6 --> 1+5=6 --> 6=6  that eqaution's true  17x+14.80y=91 --> 17(1)+14.80(5)=91 --> 17+74=91 --> 91=91  both equations are true so your answer is right    hope that helped :]|`|kRlCuvPwaa	x =   of chicken dinners  6-x =   of steak dinners    14.80(x) + 17(6-x) = 91 (distribute)  14.8x + 102 - 17x = 91 (put all x's on same side; simplify)  -2.2x = -11 (get x alone)  x=5    since x=5, the number of chicken dinners is 5.  since 6-(5) is one, the number of steak dinners is 1.|`|UAjgQbHuaa	Where x is the people who ordered chicken, and y is the family members who ordered steak, we know that:  x + y = 6   --> y = 6-x  --> y = -x + 6    Because there are six total members of the family.    We also know that each family member who ordered steak spent $14.80, each family member who ordered steak spent $17.00, and that the total spent was $91:  14.8x + 17y = 91    To solve this, we need to make it so the equation is written in terms of x, so take the original equation (y = -x + 6) and substitute it into the second equation:  14.8x +17(-x+6) = 91  --> 14.8x - 17x + 102 = 91  --> 14.8x - 17x = 91 - 102  --> -2.2x = -11   --> x = -11/-2.2  --> x = 5    To find our y, we plug in x to the first equation:  x + y = 6  --> 5 + y = 6  --> y = 6 - 5  --> y = 1    Since x = 5 and y = 1, five people had chicken and one person had steak.|`|rTgCNmcraa	http://www.algebrahelp.com/|`|jtEk35keaa	5 ppl ordered chicken and 1 person ordered steak.|`|YWA8w7Ndaa	1(17)=17  5(14.8)=74    17+74=91    One person ordered steak.

Ehav49YFaa	For an electric current to flow through   any substance particle of charge need   to be able to flow. In this question we're  talking about the electrons.    In diamonds, all the carbon atoms' electrons  are involved in covalent bonding to other carbon  atoms. There are no free electrons to create  a flow of charge.    The carbon atoms in graphite only involve   3 of their electrons for covalent bonds   leaving one spare. These electrons enable   a flow of charge be induced.              :D

wgFZGMEtaa	Sorry, but no chance for USC.  Your ACT is average, and your GPA just blows it for you.  Maybe, UCSB, but not USC.    SOrry.|`|AA11752525	Hello Jake,                   Your record is commendable and you're demonstration of improvement is unquestionable. You have demonstrated your ability to succeed in any college of your choice.                     My initial comment relates to your willingness to wildly spend your parents money or your school loans in a wastefull and unnecessary manner.                      The education process only begins with your first degree and your competition is international. Sadly, a B.A. or B.S. holds only as much significance as a high school diploma twenty/thirty years ago.                      Both schools are terrific. Between your two selections, I would attend UCSB for its campus ambience and community atmosphere.  You might also want to consider UC Santa Cruz.                        In the present economic light, increased numbers of high qualified individuals are selecting to stay in college in hiding from the job market. I think you would be most fortunate (and unfortunate) to gain admission to either school.                        Cut backs in class size enrollments may likely derail immediate school enrollment in either of your first choices.                      But that is fine!  Your first two years of college  cover general basic course requirments  bearing almost no relation to your selection of college major. You can save time and effort by enrolling first in a Junior College or State University. The costs will be significantly less and any potential graduate school will solely focus on your  last two college years and your major core courses. Graduate schools look only at your undergrad diploma and not your educational course of travel.            Your financial savings will comfortably apply to your second degree be it a Masters or Professional degree.             Surprisingly, you might well find your course work more challenging and intense at your lower ranked school.  Most everyone I know find this true when transferring from A J.C. or Cal-State school to UCLA or USC. USC is a highly theoretical program and I believe less prepares its students for everyday practical employment than continuing further philosophical  education. I graduated 1974 from UCLA and may have some prejudice. Post-grad Loyola-Mary Mount 1977.             Compare your prospective life career path to a baseball career. When you get to the major league your particular minor league path becomes completely meaningless.             Relax and take a deep breath. You are doing well. You will find unexpectedly strong competition at any school you attend. You will need to work effectively at whatever school you attend. And you are by no means any lesser qualified if you do not immediately start at your first named schools of choice.                   You do not need luck because you are more than amply qualified to succeed. Enjoy the education process. Take a broad and wide spectrum of courses exploring new areas and thoughts you never entertained in high school.  Consider living at home to maximize cost savings. Driving will still be generally  less expensive than rent or a dorm atmosphere.                 Do not put pressure on yourself needlessly. Life seems to produce as much pressure as it can without your giving it assistance.                 You are going to have great years ahead of you to enjoy and learn. Much of your college learning is from life experiences for which course credit is not even offerred.                 Your situation is envious. Enjoy!|`|3a827c8f65201304f6aa82c6d68a323eaa	Sorry but I don't see you getting into either.    At UCSB they use a formulaic approach. Your GPA is way under their averagee and ACT just a bit above. Given that they are taking fewer freshmen this year because of the budget crisis, I just don't see it.    At USC where the do a more indepth read and an upward grade trend does mean something, all of your stats are just too low for it to matter.    There's always grad school!

Rose Hill is in the Bronx near the Bronx Zoo and Botanical Garden.  Its a more suburban campus where all of the athletics fields are located.  Lincoln Center is in Lincoln Center, Manhattan.  Its urban with apartment style living and the easiest access to internships as major business are all right there. The facilities like the library and gym are considerably smaller on this campus.  But if you go there, even if you apply to one campus, you can still take classes at the other they provide transport.    There's NYU in Greenwich village.  Urban campus great school, but no grass whatsoever.  It also loses some of its campus feel.  Division 3 and no one really goes to games or plays intramural/club sports there.  Has nice apartment style dorms.    There's also Columbia University in the Morningside Heights section of Manhattan.  It's an ivy league with more of a contained campus.  Division 1 athletics where people actually go to the games.  From the people that i have spoken with that have gone there, they really loved it as there was always something new to do.  Barnard College (an all girls college) is literally across the street and you can take classes there as well if not offered by Columbia.  Barnard is typically thought of as an ivy league as well.    all of these schools have amazing faculty.

meK1OKVvaa	Use PV=mRT.  Fix it into a ratio where P1V1=P2V2. The reason why you don't use the mRT in this one is because the temperature is constant (so it would cancel itself out), and you keep the same amount of gas the whole time (so the mass is constant), and it stays the same type of gas the whole time (so the R constant of the gas would cancel itself out too).  P1=0.756atm  V1=16.7L  V2=7.75L  P2=(P1V1)/V2  P2=(0.756atm*16.7L)/7.75L (the liters units cancel out)  P2=1.629atm

Prelude to Revolution  1763 to 1775     1763 - The Proclamation of 1763, signed by King George III of England, prohibits any English settlement west of the Appalachian mountains and requires those already settled in those regions to return east in an attempt to ease tensions with Native Americans.     1764 - The Sugar Act is passed by the English Parliament to offset the war debt brought on by the French and Indian War and to help pay for the expenses of running the colonies and newly acquired territories. This act increases the duties on imported sugar and other items such as textiles, coffee, wines and indigo (dye). It doubles the duties on foreign goods reshipped from England to the colonies and also forbids the import of foreign rum and French wines.    1764 - The English Parliament passes a measure to reorganize the American customs system to better enforce British trade laws, which have often been ignored in the past. A court is established in Halifax, Nova Scotia, that will have jurisdiction over all of the American colonies in trade matters.    1764 - The Currency Act prohibits the colonists from issuing any legal tender paper money. This act threatens to destabilize the entire colonial economy of both the industrial North and agricultural South, thus uniting the colonists against it.    1764 - In May, at a town meeting in Boston, James Otis raises the issue of taxation without representation and urges a united response to the recent acts imposed by England. In July, Otis publishes "The Rights of the British Colonies Asserted and Proved." In August, Boston merchants begin a boycott of British luxury goods.    1765 - In March, the Stamp Act is passed by the English Parliament imposing the first direct tax on the American colonies, to offset the high costs of the British military organization in America. Thus for the first time in the 150 year old history of the British colonies in America, the Americans will pay tax not to their own local legislatures in America, but directly to England.     Under the Stamp Act, all printed materials are taxed, including; newspapers, pamphlets, bills, legal documents, licenses, almanacs, dice and playing cards. The American colonists quickly unite in opposition, led by the most influential segments of colonial society - lawyers, publishers, land owners, ship builders and merchants - who are most affected by the Act, which is scheduled to go into effect on November 1.    1765 - Also in March, the Quartering Act requires colonists to house British troops and supply them with food.     1765 - In May, in Virginia, Patrick Henry presents seven Virginia Resolutions to the House of Burgesses claiming that only the Virginia assembly can legally tax Virginia residents, saying, "If this be treason, make the most of it." Also in May, the first medical school in America is founded, in Philadelphia.    1765 - In July, the Sons of Liberty, an underground organization opposed to the Stamp Act, is formed in a number of colonial towns. Its members use violence and intimidation to eventually force all of the British stamp agents to resign and also stop many American merchants from ordering British trade goods.     1765 - August 26, a mob in Boston attacks the home of Thomas Hutchinson, Chief Justice of Massachusetts, as Hutchinson and his family narrowly escape.    1765 - In October, the Stamp Act Congress convenes in New York City, with representatives from nine of the colonies. The Congress prepares a resolution to be sent to King George III and the English Parliament. The petition requests the repeal of the Stamp Act and the Acts of 1764. The petition asserts that only colonial legislatures can tax colonial residents and that taxation without representation violates the colonists' basic civil rights.    1765 - On November 1, most daily business and legal transactions in the colonies cease as the Stamp Act goes into effect with nearly all of the colonists refusing to use the stamps. In New York City, violence breaks out as a mob burns the royal governor in effigy, harasses British troops, then loots houses.     1765 - In December, British General Thomas Gage, commander of all English military forces in America, asks the New York assembly to make colonists comply with the Quartering Act and house and supply his troops. Also in December, the American boycott of English imports spreads, as over 200 Boston merchants join the movement.    1766 - In January, the New York assembly refuses to completely comply with Gen. Gage's request to enforce the Quartering Act.    1766 - In March, King George III signs a bill repealing the Stamp Act after much debate in the English Parliament, which included an appearance by Ben Franklin arguing for repeal and warning of a possible revolution in the American colonies if the Stamp Act was enforced by the British military.     1766 - On the same da|`|V6sNY08saa	He should choose one specific event that occurred in the Revolutionary war.

That score is usually enough to get "commended", which is the highest 50,000 scores, although you won't receive any money nor progress further in the competition to a stage where you will be able to get money. 201 is also usually high enough to be semi finalist in Wyoming.

Nin6IawVaa	Just ignore them. Do your job and don't try to make extra effort to be their friend. If they don't like you, they will see that behavior as "someone who clings or annoying"  Give it time.

Give it time!!|`|M3k9GOSsaa	Firstly, be yourself. Girls tend to be a bit standoffish with new young "blood" in an office setting. I would suggest, be polite to them, but don't try to be nice just to make friends. Having friends at work can be advantageous and disadvantageous.    Notice what the girls do outside of talking to one another and strike up conversations not pertaining to the other workers. Compliment a co-worker on her cute shoes but ignore when she snarls at you because you haven't been let into the "clique" yet. Or ask where to find a good yoga class, or place to take out your boyfriend/husband to dinner on Friday night.    AND/OR, Ask one of the girls for help on a project. When one won't help, move to the next one and repeat. Don't lose faith. Eventually, they will see that you are a warm and welcoming person willing to overlook their caddy-attitudes and really just want to play nice for the sake of doing a good job.    It's in girls nature to put on a happy face and play nice, but talk behind each others backs when another doesn't fit in. Don't feed into it. Keep a cool head and ignore bad behaviour when it has no premise.|`|FvVqFFrNaa	the incorrect word in your question is "there" it should be "their problem". did i solve it?

Quality is measured by a factor known as water (the mix of color and transparency in a stone).  Stones are known by first water, second water, third water, and byewater.  There are also other factors used to determine quality such as color, clarity, and optical phenomena.  Some precious stones include diamond, ruby, emerald, and sapphire.  Some semi-precious stones include garnet, lapis lazuli, turquoise, and opal.

Look into them. Since UVU is a newer university, it's programs probably arent as developed. Personally I love USU, but I have a friend that is loving SUU.

YWA8w7Ndaa	what are the rules and guidelines?|`|AA11298074	what will happen if an elastic object such as a rubber band is heated....i bet your mom or teacher or an older sibling would be able to help you with this....  1. Make one cut in the rubber band so that it forms one long, straight strip.  2. Tie the rubber band to a ring clamp attached to a ring stand.  3. Tie a weight of about 100 g to the opposite end of the rubber band.  4. Position the height of the ring clamp so that the weight just barely touches the base of the ring stand or top of the table.  5. Heat the entire rubber band with a heat gun or hair dryer by moving the gun up and down the length of the rubber band. (Note - if the rubber band is heated too much in one spot, it may melt and/or break)  6. Observe the position of the weight. (When the rubber band is heated, it will contract and the weight rises.)  7. Optional: Use a meter stick to measure the amount of contraction of the rubber band by measuring the height of the weight from the ring stand base or table top. You may also wish to try rubber bands of various thicknesses to look for changes in length. However, if you try a thicker rubber band, you will need a larger weight, 500 g to 1 kg, to provide an easily measurable difference in length.    i did one over this in middle school and got third place......good luck

YWA8w7Ndaa	One week is the equivalent of 7 days. So three weeks means 7 times 3. To bring you to a grand total of 21 days.    And, no. You're not dumb. You have no idea how many questions I've posted thinking "Ohmygod. They're going to thing I'm stupid for this..." Hahah.|`|F2bEdu66aa	seriously?  7 days in a week!  times 3 weeks!  21 DAYS!|`|PwgWtkrMaa	well, the obvious answer is 21, BUT being on vacation and being gone are 2 different things.|`|5TmGu6LAaa	21 days because in 1 week there is 7 days so if there are 3 weeks you have 21 days|`|ZUKz3XDvaa	Is that the entire problem?    A lot of word problems have a lot of unnecessary information in there but it's not always what you think is unnecessary so if it isn't the whole problem please post the problem in it's entirety.     If it is:      Think about what is irrelevant:  Who is going on vacation isn't relevant and when he goes isn't because neither affects the thing that you are looking for "how long will he be gone?".  If you knew that Laurie's Uncle always went away for a certain number of days, or that when he vacationed in July he stayed a few days longer because of the nice weather, that would be important.   But since there's no other story or information that connects who or when to the question "how long will he be gone" it's not important.  Ignore it.  Take it out of the question.          The real question is:    Three weeks is equal to how many days?        Or put it in terms of no words at all:    3w = x    w = 7    solve for x        Do you understand the problem better now?|`|8idLIc84aa	There are 7 days in one week.

3a827c8f65201304f6aa82c6d68a323eaa	I hate when kids focus in on Harvard, Yale and Stanford because the admit rate is ridiculously low and it takes an act of god to get in.    There's little that's rational about the process. The majority of kids with perfect grades and scores don't get in, there's so little room.    Your best shot is to become a recruited athlete, have a parent who went there, be born to very rich parents willing to make a large gift or be black, Hispanic or native American. Those kids get in MUCH more easily.    After that the real trick to getting into one of these schools after you have top grades and scores is achieving excellence in one thing outside of the classroom. By excellence I mean being best on a national or international level. An Olympic athlete, an artist who's work is in major galleries, a published author or musician who plays with a big city symphony. That's the sad truth of what it takes today.|`|mfGrpxEAaa	i am sorry to tell you this but.....you are going to need a miracle to get in there.

If you really want to go there take the hardest classes offered by your school, your IB program, and get the best grade you possibly can. But also stay involved in school. keep up with community service, start you own fundraiser if you can.  Definitely meet with your guidance counselor, Stanford is a reach for anyone, don't cross it off your list, but at the same time don't think that its the only school out there it only leads to devastation if you don't get in.  Lastly, cross you fingers and hope.  I wish you luck over the next two years.|`|RTuTQDSjaa	hey..    though i partially agree with all others who said it was really tough getting into stanford but with a good professional degree,one always has a chance..I mean,I've seen class fellows from Pakistan getting admission on scholarships through various programs like USEFP/Fulbright for Ivy League Colleges and Chevening for UK universities like cambridge/Oxford.

Until they begin school the only thing needed is to be able to relate to other adults and have a very rudimentary understanding of sharing and taking turns.  Learning the alphabet and using numbers correctly will come with age and ability and shouldd not be forced onto the child.  A dynamite program will present the academics in a wonderful and entertaining way.  Your child will absorb facts as a fun part of the learning process.  Preschool should be about socialization skills and being able to say "I can do tihis by myself,"  Let your child enjoy being a child.  Thanks for letting me share with you!

Like "here is a picture of the letter C, did you know Cow starts with the letter C" don't expect her to participate in the discussion right away, it's better for her to listen and absorb at first. As for her numbers, it is mostly important for her to be able to count. Start counting everything. When she gets snack, count the crackers as you give them to her.

Therefore, 3x+5y=1  --- 3x = 1 - 5y                  x+4y=11 ---   x = 11 - 4y    If you still don't know what to do from there, ask me|`|8idLIc84aa	To solve a linear system you can use substitution or elimination.  I find elimination to be a lot easier.    Substitution:    It is easy to isolate the x in the second equation, so start there.   x = -4y + 11    Put that in the first equation and solve for y    3(-4y + 11) + 5y = 1  -12y + 33 + 5y = 1  -7y + 33 = 1  -7y = -32  y = 4.6    Replace that y value in the second equation which when you isolated the x earlier was x = -4y + 11    x = -4(4.6) + 11        -18.4 + 11        -7.4    I believe that's the answer.

Able to work week-ends and holidays.   Fluent in English; another language a plus.   Must provide a 10-year verifiable employment history.   Airline/Airport experience is helpful.   Drug screening, background and criminal check required.    These are your 'basic' qualifications for working in any airport system.  You are vague in your request and do not advise what "position" you are applying.  The position you want to work in would be tantamount to the job opening the airport might have available.  In fact, even someone who handles the baggage would have to pass the above qualifications, but other than having the ability to lift certain pounds, would not require too much else.      On the other hand, you might be looking into a  position as a Representative - Customer help at the ticket counter.  Some airlines require that you know the entire job system - top to bottom.      I have a friend who worked for an airlines and had to learn everything from what the service people on the plane did to the service people under the plane.      Hopefully, you have more than a high school diploma which can offer you more opportunities and greater pay.      Note - that because of the economic situation we are dealing with many of the airlines have placed positions on hold.      I wish you the best.

AA10297143	I suppose you wanted only females to answer this but I am having a go at it anyway.  The answer is, I have never stared or struck a female, and I have only rapped the knuckles of a student once.  I have been teaching for over 10 years.    I am truly surprised your question has lasted this long without a troll finding it and having you reported for this question.  You could have presented the question without the vulgar insinuendos.

374eccbf7968ba29755a2dbe3d4e9dc9aa	Don't forget a science, maths and English. You really need them to do anything|`|BGIsuNMTaa	Yeah thats a definate good choice. Drama will boost your confidence for whatever career you decide to take, history backs up the academic side, german is useful as most jobs will take someone with a language on over someone who doesnt and childcare can teaches you how to communicate in the correct manner and can lead on to a wide variety in jobs from nursing, midwifery, teaching, social working and nursery nursing,     Good luck|`|Tfd0z5Xhaa	they are the exact same choices i did at school except for the childcare....i did cookery instead....i enjoyed all of them, then went onto college to do drama...and i still cant cook!!!!!|`|yLmeZMTWaa	I think these seem to be perfect for you! A very good mix which will serve you well when you come to be choosing a job or a university. A language will give you an advantage when you want to get into university (though I warn you now that I took a language at GCSE and I am hating every second of it, although everyone is different and it will help me get into a good uni). Drama will be a fun subject, a bit of relief after the writing subjects, it will also improve confidence and show Uni's that you have variety, of course the fact that you enjoy it is the main thing. History is a great choice because it is important to have a Humanity subject, I took this too and I am loving it! It's easy, interesting and useful.Like I said before though, people are all different and have different opinionss. The way a subject is taught is important too, for example I have a great History teacher.But anyway, enough blabbering about me and back to you! Childcare will also be good because you said you liked children so if you choose a career involving them then you will need this subject, it sounds fun as well! And it's important to try new things!    I think these are really good choices. Good luck in year 10 and I hope you enjoy the subjects!      And just to add as a message to help other answerers, when you go into yr10 you have to take English, Maths and Science etc anyway. You don't have a choice, these are just the options you take on top of that. At least that's how it is at my school, if I am wrong then I'm sorry!|`|YzJP6uyeaa	Yes it's a good mixture :)    Your so lucky!! I don't have childcare at my school :(|`|IGaNw4qDaa	go for it but i would also suggest double award science as this opens many doors in the future
uhYKsDjRaa	These are simultaneous equations. You compare the two and you can find the values for x and y.  Here we go.    3x + 5y = 350  3y = x + 40  put all the variables on the left side leaving the constants on the right  3x + 5y = 350  -x  + 3y  = 40    The goal is to eliminate one of the variables. If we multiply the second equation by 3, we'll have a -3x which will cancel the 3x in the first equation when we add the two equations together.   3x + 5y = 350  -3x  +9y = 120    By adding the 2 equations together, the 3x cancels leaving           +14y = 470   Now divide both sides by 14 and y = 33.57 (usually we expect the answer to be a whole number, but not always!)  Put 33.57 in place of y in one of the original equations and you can solve for x    3x + 5( 33.57)= 350  3x + 167.85 = 350  Subtract the 167.85 from both sides  3x = 182.15   divide both sides by 3  x = 60.71    We can check the answer by putting both answers into the other equation  3y = x + 40  3(33.57) = 60.71 + 40                       100.71 = 100.71    Hope this helps! Most of the time they come out with integer values but not always.|`|1WlTGkMSaa	y= 235/7  x = 985/7|`|LpCDchxRaa	x=3y-40    so 3(3y-40) + 5y =350    9y-120+ 5y = 350    14y=230  y= 230/14    then u can find x urself|`|rseR7Camaa	simple??? thats not simple...  anyway, if you thouht it was so simple, why did you post it here?

AA10481903	October 3, 1965 - that was the day the drunk driver broadsided the car I was in.  He ran a red light at 45 miles per hour.  My dad was driving, I sat next to him, and my friend, Marc, sat next to me in the front seat.  All three of us (no seat belts back then!) ended up in the middle of the intersection.    When I regained consciousness, I realized I was lying in the middle of the intersection (PANIC!).  I RAN to the sidewalk and joined all of the "looky-loos".  My dad soon found me and walked me back to our smashed car to wait for the ambulance.  I had to walk by my friend Marc - the biggest and toughest kid I knew (we were 10 years old).  Marc was lying in the street - crying for his mommy.  His white t-shirt had black tire marks running across his chest.  The drunk driver had literally run him over with his car after Marc flew out of our car.     Marc spent a month in the hospital and 6 more months in recovery at home. He had many broken bones and a punctured lung.    My dad and I have permanent neck/spine/nerve injuries from that day.  My concussion left me with a permanent impairment - I cannot remember names and faces very well.  For a full year after the accident, fear wouldn't let me look out of the window of any car I was riding in.  I still panic (45 years later) whenever I hear "screeching tires".    You may share my story to open your speech, if you would like too.    Best wishes and good luck.|`|04dc0d2596b5e8336fe567281e72fb2faa	I want to read you a letter. "I am so sorry Mom. I miss you and Dad so much. I know I promised to be home on time. And I would have been, if John hadn't had those beer. I didn't think he was drunk. I guess I should have called you......." . And go on like that as if you are a dead teen telling your folks what happened. Then lead into something like "MADD doesn't want your parents lose you like this. That is why they...." It should get peoples attention .|`|0rfojt9Paa	10 easy points huh?    I would start with a statistic for shock value about the death caused by drunk drive either by the ones drinking (there own death rate) or by innocent victims such as the one hit by a drunk drive such as mothers or children who have lost their life because they shared the same road as one who chose to drive home.|`|A5rkUoGvaa	well ill try start with the following: hello everone today i would like to talk to you about a serios case madd there are many things that can happen if you are a drunk driver.....................................|`|d3346d4431bf0f9cc0e6f3b97c6c1778aa	Have you ever heard of "MADD"?  Do you know what it means?  What are all these women mad about?  They have a very good reason for being mad.  MADD stands for.......      .....then go on to describe the initials, how it got started, and cite some statistics for deaths due to DUI in the year that MADD was organized, and statistics for today.  Compare those numbers with the number of drivers today, both overall and for teens.    Make this subject come alive for your listeners.  Find out how many teens have died as a result of alcohol use by drivers, compare it to the   of kids in your school, and reveal how many of them or of their friends are  liable to loose their lives to this very real menace.  Good luck.  Also, cite some statistics about other costs:  hospitilization, burial, car replacements, road repair, insurance, families on welfare because breadwinner has been killed, and on and on.  You can find all this info online.  Your idea to make up a story would not be nearly so dramatic and meaningful to your audience as a review of the reality of the dangers presented by drinking and driving.

Or say maybe you dont need an interview and you've heard they only interview the people they're not sure about, that should shut them up.   But try not to worry too much about that as they'll probably be happier to talk about themselves getting in (or just getting an interview!) than anything else. If you give the impression that you're not bothered they shouldn't be trying to make you feel bad by going on about it. It probably wont be as bad as you think. Something else might happen for them to talk about.|`|FqIuY6Qcaa	Lie and say that you did get in then, then you won't have to hear the fake sympathy.  I can't bear hearing that either.

374eccbf7968ba29755a2dbe3d4e9dc9aa	You don't usually need a specific degree unless you are teaching secondary. However a degree in Education would be a good choice [ B.Ed] as then you will have already covered a lot of the stuff needed for your Post Grad Certificate Course.|`|5e7ae76d63cef0003f897d4f3907586daa	a BEd teacher training degree will make you a better teacher than a specific subject degree with a PGCE. you'll come out with better all round teaching experience.    but, it does mean that that is all you're qualified to do.    good luck|`|7deb425958c53615415ce326bcbf08e0aa	You can either do a BEd in primary or a degree followed by a post grad qualification.    Which you choose is up to you. If you do the degree followed by a PGCE (or GTP or whatever) your subject must have a lot of a national curriculum subject in it, it doesn't directly need to be the NC subject. Eg I know someone who did English PGCE with a degree in Deaf Studies but because her degree had a lot of linguistics in it she was considered a suitable candidate for English PGCE.    Personally I'd do the degree PGCE route for the dimple reason it leaves your options open. Once you have qualified as a teacher you can teach any age group but a secondary / high school are not likely to employ someone with BEd early years.     The other thing you need to look at is APEL (Accreditation for prior experience and learning) you are obviously a mature student so you might be able to APEL some units - talk to individual universities about this.|`|203n3Lopaa	You are best doing a degree that is a subject at school, the core subjects English, maths and science are always good but you will be fine with history, art, pe, music, dt etc.  Foreign languages, particularly Spanish and French will make you very popular as MFL will be compulsary in all primary schools soon and a lot of teachers do not have the skills to do it (me included!)     I have just interviewed potential students for next year and the more work experience the greater the chance to get on the course (there is a lot of competition) I would recommend as much work experience as possible in primary schools as you complete your degree.    Good luck :)    Additional - I guess you have the experience then! You should have no problem :)|`|F80GKhPUaa	I just have to say that I totally disagree with the answer given by V.  Following a BEd course does not make you a better teacher at all. I have mentored both BEd and PGCE students and it always comes down to the individual rather than the course they follow. Such a sweeping generalisation by someone who considers their own training route to be superior is offensive and clearly misguided.     I suggest you choose the route which best suits your personal situation and circumstances and ignore the opinions of individuals with superiority complexes!

b6e3e5765ea9340b4ffd975bfca501aaaa	Teachers generally assume that the break between classes is adequate time enough to go to the bathroom.  They are afraid if they let one, everyone will go and they will lose class control.    You should have gone up a moment later and privately said - "I know you wouldn't let me before, but it is an emergency.  Will you allow me to go to the nurses office and then they can verify that I was there and that it was an emergency when I return."

You should explain this story to your original teacher and get their opinion.|`|xdeWSxJ4aa	That is ridiculous.

No student is to be in the hall after passing periods.|`|xcxMB4Rlaa	I think it's unfair but there's not much you can do about it.  You could complain to the principal or have your parents complain to the principal but unless there are quite a few people making the same complaint, chances are nothing will be done about it.  What I would do is if you're ever in that situation again, you ask repeatedly.  If the sub keeps saying no, after a few times get up and go to the bathroom.  It's not good for your bladder for you to hold your urine for long periods of time, and there's added concern during your cycle (keeping the pad/tampon on too long...).  That part is nobody's business but yours and since he's not letting you be discreet about it, you need to take matters into your own hands.  You shouldn't have to use the bathroom on yourself to get the point across.  But if you repeatedly ask and keep getting a no, just leave.  And when you come back be prepared for the consequences (detention or whatever).  And make sure you complain to the principal about this substitute's actions, and explain that you understand there may be consequences but you had no other choice.|`|TanAU2aAaa	say you have to go and cross your legs and hold your breath. he'll buy it. :)|`|DaH0rOghaa	Maybe next time try to presude him|`|ZhbYrBf7aa	In Calculus my teacher refused me a pass to the bathroom and I relieved myself in my chair.

Ao5aSAWiaa	Oh darn I left my precalc book in my locker, but it explains it well there aha.    Cos^-1 = secant.  You can do that on your calculator, but if you are like my teacher and doesn't let us use calculators, here's how to do it:    If you want to find the secant, you make the triangle against your unit circle.    Say in the 2nd quad:    hyp. comes out from origin, sec = oppo cos = R / X    r = hyp.  x = adjacent    cos is adj/hyp. sec is hyp/adj.    In a 30-60-90 triangle, lets say your reference point is 30.    therefore, x-axis = x (radical)3.  y-axis has your x.  hyp = 2X.    sec of that triangle is 2X/ X(radical)3.  Cancel your X's.  2 / (radical)3.  You cannot have radicals in your denominator.  Multiply both by (radical)3.  Your answer is 2 (radical)3 / 3|`|uhYKsDjRaa	There is likely a function key on your calculator that shows as   Cos ^-1.   Cos ^-1 is just the inverse of Cos or Hypotenuse/adjacent

9EdJHqKHaa	catch the audiences attention. I usually use personal experience, something to suck the audience in. You cant do this in all types of speeches because some are supposed to be fact based information only. But in a speech where you can use personal opinion, which seems to be the type of speech you are writing, it is always good to use something to catch the attention of the audience. For example, pick a gripping part of the book, and explain it in a way that makes the audience feel they are actually "in" the story. For a favorite food, explain in detail the smell, feeling, taste of the good. Explain it in a way they can actually taste the food themselves. After this intro, the audience will be more in tune to your speech because they feel they are a part of it.|`|SAgCy83Oaa	Old tradition says to start out the speech with a funny anecdote, even a simple joke, as long as it "fits" somehow with the speech.  It "breaks the ice" a little.  But you need to be a decent joke-teller and it has to be to-the-point or it will cause more damage than it helps.   Simplest way to present a speech is the old adage:  Tell 'em what you going to tell 'em  Tell 'em  Tell 'em what you told 'em    Also remember another useful adage for speechifying:  Stand Up - Speak Up - and Shut Up   (Brevity is the Soul of Wit)    Keep in mind the potential value of a visual aid.

There's fruits, vegetables, bread, desserts and cereals.  Sometimes, it's hard to pick your favorite.  For me, I like______(put your favorite food here).  Next put your thoughts about the food, why you like it, when your favorite time to eat it is, and if it's popular for a lot of people.  Then you could add anything else you want to about the food.  When organizing the speech, think of subjects you might say, then organize them in whatever order you think they should be in.  It's actually quite simple when you get the hang of it.       For a book, this is what you should say: Books are very popular in my house.  There are children's stories, short stories, novels, fiction and non-fiction.  I like to read______ (Put what genre of book you like and why). My favorite book is _______ (Put in favorite book and why.)  Next, give the name of the author, why you like him/her, and give a brief summary of the book, encouraging people to read it.  Give a lot, but not too much info about the amin character.

You can do this in several ways:  1. Use a quote  2. Tell a story - for the book, set the scene and incorporate the audience into the story.

This is the decision facing [insert main character's name] in the exciting book [insert title]. Go on to explain that this is your favorite book and give a few reasons why.    3. describe your favorite food make it sound appetizing and appealing. Use words to describe the taste, texture color, smell and sight of your favorite food. Make the audience hungry and then for the body of your speech talk about why it is your favorite.

Your speech must have a structure. First, get your audiences' interest by an opening statement (or statements) that will make them curious on what you will be talking about. A question perhaps something like, "Have you past been haunting you to a point where you have to go back to it?" if you are going to talk about the book Kite Runner. Or something like, "Have you experienced an explosion of cultures and tradition with a spoon?" if you are to talk about your fave food. Then slowly build up to the "climax" of your speech - which is the body. The closing of your speech must get you back to your opening statement, or answer the opening question. Don't forget the necessities of speaking - eye contact with your audience, hand gestures, intonation to stress on the mood of the statement, projection and intensity of your voice (but not shouting). Good luck.

IGcS9K62aa	I'll just start at the top. It's is a tad bit hard to proofread over the internet. I'd say as it sits it's probably a C, C- paper.    Introduction:  I'd get rid of the first sentence, you don't want to make broad generalizations. I combine sentences 2 & 3. I'd also make a clear definition of "junk food". Are you talking about vending machines? Soda and chips on lunch carts? Pizza available for lunch everyday? Allowing candy sales on campus? Or is it food that looks junky? I know common knowledge dictates most know what junk food is, but you really need to make it clear. If you decide not to change the intro, at least change acceptation to exception. Refine your thesis slightly... more like 'The distribution and consumption of junk food can lead to obesity, hyperactivity, and increased debris around campus."    Paragraph 1:  Get rid of 'believe it or not'. If you could find a figure (percentage) for that statement it would help. Google it and make sure you put a citation at the bottom, whatever form your teacher wants. You need to develop your idea. Make sure you are correct that the school does not healthy options (it could be students just don't pick them, which is more often then not the reality of the issue). You stray away from your point. You need to focus on obesity, not the lack of healthy food. The lack of healthy food contributes to obesity. Also add why obesity is bad, especially childhood obesity. Again google it. I'm sure you can find a government site, NIH or something that would strengthen your argument.    Paragraph 2:  Change your first sentence. "Most junk food, especially soda and candy, contain high amounts of sugar. Sugar is a known cause of hyperactivity." Also you might what to put in the other side, when you kids come down from the sugar high they're often lethargic and comatose. Include, too, that the effects of sugar aren't just bad for the kids and their education but for the teachers who give it to them.    Paragraph 3:  Again, not a great first sentence way too negative and informal. "Litter is already a problem on campus. Most of the debris is candy wrappers, chip bags, and soda bottles." Is junk food litter different than healthy food litter? Maybe its availability makes it that way? Can you get it any time? In class? Between classes at vending machines, not just at lunch? Is that what makes it more messy? Group like ideas together. If you're talking about the campus being a mess keep it with the same topic, don't stick what students do with candy in the middle.    Conclusion:  Get rid of 'in conclusion'. It's obviously the conclusion. Also get rid of "without a doubt". Make your statement clear, like "The sale of junk food in schools should be limited." Repeat the refined thesis. Don't say "I would say" leave yourself out of it. Your idea here is a good. Limit the sale of junk food to once a week. Offer healthy options, like a salad bar, the four other days. I honestly really like your idea, just make sure when you suggest it don't say "stop" the sale because you make the suggestion to limit it.        Well, there ya go. I suspect that's the most help you'll get on here. Hope it works out well! Good luck!

AA11815754	The "gifts" that the Nile gave to the land and the people living in it's banks are: the annual flood, food, transportation, papyrus, and water.    The flooding of the river banks along the nile deposited rich soil the people then used for farming. Crops really depended on the flooding of the Nile every year. The better the annual flood, the higher up the bank rich river soil was deposited which meant the larger the crops grown could be.    Food is a given. The Nile is rich in fish, edible grasses, and other animals that depend on the water source of the Nile.    Transportation is also self explanatory. Building ships to float up and down the Nile allowed different tribes to trade with one another, and kept the Upper and Lower kingdoms connected.     Papyrus is the first known paper. Google papyrus, you'll get all the information you could possibly want in a click.     Finally water. Water for watering crops, drinking, washing yourself and your clothes.

The Nile is the only source of water in Egypt for drinking and planting.  The Nile is the oldest highway in the world, it was used to travel and transport goods to and from every part of Egypt since all cities and towns are located near the Nile.  It taught Egyptians to settle in one area, have communities, governments, laws and forced them to watch the stars and invent the calendar to predict the time of flooding. It taught them to write so that they mark down their observations, to calculate and measure lands, in short it is the root of civilization.

janeqyBHaa	2000(1.08)^(4*8) = $23474.17    (8 years is times by 4 because the interest is compounded quarterly, 4 times a year)|`|1Q9ldcWSaa	You need to use the formula FV = P(1+i/n)^(nt), where:    FV = future value  P = amount of initial principal invested  i = NOMINAL annual interest rate compounded n times per year  n = number of times that interest is compounded per year  t = number of years    So FV = 2000(1+.08/4)^(4*8) = 2000(1.02)^32 = 3769.08.|`|UKFL4wNVaa	Figure out 8% of 2000.   Then add 2000 + % = year one  Figure out 8% of year one = year two  Then add year one + year two     --- repeat for each year.    compounding interest is when you don't take out the interest, you 'roll it over' in the investment and the extra money earns more interest.     So I think the answer is this :     $3701.88    but please check it yourself.

Ic6Fyszgaa	Is it still an option for you to withdraw from some of your classes?  I'm going to guess that your school's policy on academic probation is that if your semester GPA is below 2.0, you'll be suspended.  If you can withdraw from a class or two, I would suggest you do that to preserve your GPA.  Talk to you adviser about what your options are.  Also, talk to your professors about what you can do to pass the class at this point in the semester.      For next semester, if you don't have to be full-time, don't register for a full load.  Take this summer to re-evaluate and re-commit yourself to your studies.  If you determine that college is not for you right now, don't waste your time or your parents' money if you aren't willing to commit yourself to school.  You can always get a job then go back to school at a later date.      Best wishes to you!|`|2gstVBcMaa	Obviously you are not in a place in your life right now where school is a priority.

So take a year off...its not going to kill you and go out in the real world...my guess is that it will motivate you to get back into school and take it seriously.|`|aa9fa110a20e70922d00a7a8b77dd863aa	what do you expect us to say?    you don't go to class, you fail.  understand that and maybe you can pull yourself out of this hole.

(i forget what those people called themselves.)|`|9hNgWQlsaa	I HAD TO WRITE AN ESSAY ABOUT THE SAME THING!!!!  (ours had to be a diary entry though)  Dear Diary-    It has been several months since the plague hit our little town, however from the eyes of an outsider it looks as though several years of damage has hit. I cannot even begin to describe the chaos that I have seen however I will attempt to do so.     I believe the plague spread through contamination. The water and air became polluted. Through contact with the poisoned substances people became violently sick with the bubonic plague. Their entire bodies would become swollen. Within a matter of days, the diseased be covered with black spots and boils. The victims would have high fevers and would be extremely nauseous. They would die very suddenly, and only a couple of days after being diagnosed with the illness.   To prevent the disease the people burned the clothes of the victims. They believed the disease was caught in the garments and tried to kill it with fire. They also tried to burn Jews. Some believed that the Jews got the plague and were spreading it to Christians. When a person caught the black plague, the door to their house would be nailed shut by the people of the town for fear of further spreading the aliment to others. Dead victims were thrown out of city boundaries so the sickness wouldnt jump onto healthy citizens. In Milan, the people blocked their ports so no people carrying the disease could bring it in.    Almost as bad as the Black Death itself was how the people began acting as a result of it. Family members of the sick simply abandoned their relatives for fear of getting sick themselves. Once the diseased died, they were thrown into ditches. No religious ceremonies were preformed and nobody was honored. The death bell wasnt rung because there were too many deaths.    Survivors and those who had not yet caught the plague thought it was the end of the world. They thought that they would die either way so it no longer mattered what they did.  Nuns and Monks didnt follow their codes and principals. People gambled away money, hunted, drank and caught birds. People no longer treat each other well and thought only of keeping themselves alive and enjoying what time was left.   I have not yet caught the plague, however some of my siblings have. My sister was the only survivor out of my six brothers that caught it. After the first two deaths I stopped felt a monotone. I knew I should feel worse then I do about them passing on; however it seems that all my recent thoughts have been occupied on keeping myself and my remaining family alive and well. I sense that the doctors have started to give up. Many of them have a variety of ideas, such as dressing up as giant birds with large beaks to scare away the illness. However none of these seem to have much effect. There have been several outbreaks of the Black Death in past years, however none as bad as this one. I pray it will soon be over and for all the sick to get healthy once more.|`|qMhLcn8Gaa	Typically, in a traditional 5 paragraph essay the last paragraph is a "summary and closure" paragraph.

XN0cYCATaa	Christianity is not properly represented by the Inquisition and the Salem Witch Trials. Though these things happened in the name of "Christianity" it does not mean that this is what Christianity teaches. Instead, Christianity professes conversion by love not by torture.  Those who you used coercive means did so against the Christian scriptures.    Matt. 5:43-44, You have heard that it was said, You shall love your neighbor, and hate your enemy. 44 But I say to you, love your enemies, and pray for those who persecute you."   Rom. 16:19, "For the report of your obedience has reached to all; therefore I am rejoicing over you, but I want you to be wise in what is good, and innocent in what is evil."   Col. 4:5-6, "Conduct yourselves with wisdom toward outsiders, making the most of the opportunity. 6 Let your speech always be with grace, seasoned, as it were, with salt, so that you may know how you should respond to each person."   1 Tim. 3:7, "And he must have a good reputation with those outside the church, so that he may not fall into reproach and the snare of the devil."        There have been times in the Christian church where those who have claimed to follow Christ have done horrible things. They have done these things not because Christ teaches them to, but because they have not listened to the word of God. As is frequently established in history when anyone comes into complete political and military control that abuse almost always follows. The Inquisition was a Roman Catholic invention intended to root out all sorts of "heresies." The Inquisition used torturous means to force confessions out of people. Thousands were killed mercilessly and unjustly. The Protestant Reformation distances itself from the Catholic Inquisition. However, it has its own sordid history and the witch trials we had here in America among some Puritans is an example.  They allowed their paranoia and ignorance to overtake reason and scripture.  As a result, many people were killed because they were accused of being witches -- and they weren't.       Again, this does not mean that Christianity is false anymore than the police force is false because one or two cops did bad things in the name of the law. Instead of looking at the two cops, the whole of the police force, its goals, other cops, and its history of sacrifice and protection must be examined as well. The same as Christianity. It has a great history of helping countless people, establishing orphanages, building shelters, helping famine ravaged countries, and seeking to aid the downtrodden.       If anyone wishes to condemn Christianity because of the failures of its members, then will they also look at its successes and approve of Christianity? It would only be fair to look at the whole of Christian history and more importantly at what the Bible actually teaches, in particular the New Testament, from which Christianity is derived.       Believe in Christianity because Jesus Christ claimed to be God in flesh, died for our sins, rose from the dead, and has given us the New Testament. Believe in Jesus because He performed miracles in front of eyewitnesses and He said that He was the way the truth in a life (John 14:6). Believe Christianity because of who Jesus is, not because of what some so called Christians did in error.|`|SDDgbtQ4aa	There was a combonation of things that lead to the Salem Witch Trials -economics, politics, religion, imaginations and fears of the people.    Much later, the theory was presented that ergot poisioning could have been a major contributing factor to the hysteria as well.    The bottom line, there was no *one* cause that can be proven.  It is more likely that multiple factors were involved.    http://www.salemwitchtrials.com/faqs.htm...    http://www.hbci.com/~wenonah/history/erg...|`|3149d8c79c2c2fd573c8fb1acb44e350aa	I would say hysteria and superstition.  http://www.law.umkc.edu/faculty/projects...  http://www.salemwitchtrials.com/salemwit...

Remember even in relatively recent times mass hysteria can still take place, even in a modern western society.  The notorious Orson Welles radio dramatisation of 'The War of the Worlds' is evidence of that.  The theory that they could have been because of an outbreak of Ergot poisoning from infected rye is a modern one by Linnda Caporael, dating from the 1970s, but is no more than that, a theory.  Read up what Linnda Caporael's thoughts are, but form your own opinion.  There is an undoubted link between Ergot and LSD, but that is in the field of Bio-chemistry, not theorising about historical events.  I hope this helps.  I've given no links, but Googling 'Linnda Caporael' should lead to more in depth explanation about her theories.

AA10691226	You may want to review your essay with the idea of condensing it a little. One way is to find phrases that repeat the same idea just mentioned and cut them out.    Another thing that might help is to decide whether you want to speak as one person ('I') or as the reserved plural ('we') as I see these forms mixed in the piece. Since it is about a personal topic, it might be better to use 'I' instead of 'we' for the entire effort.    The tone of this essay is friendly and light which is appropriate for the topic.  Good job!

TNTFomKeaa	Well, it's not exactly the same, but my sister had to repeat her first and second years. She got funding for the first year but not for the second time. I understand that the rule is that you can have the number of years of your degree plus one extra year, which she used up the first time she failed. This year she has to support herself but when she makes it into third year she will get loans again. We're in the UK. I don't know how much difference that makes.  I guess the only way you will know for sure is when you apply. It will probably make a difference if you just failed first year or if you went all the way through the course before failing finals.   I know you said you've been through all the websites but would it be worth calling your LEA and talking through your application?  Good luck. I hope uni goes better for you second time round (I'm a mature student too, three years late, and it makes a huge difference to how you do in your courses. I'm so glad I'm at uni now I'm ready for it and not when I was 18 as I would probably have failed too).  All the best.|`|ab2c491e6bca420e2c45c21f91d16208aa	okay my understanding of the money is that the lea do a 3+1 so you can get up to four years funding, so if you did one year when 18 you had one years funding so are entitled to three more full years funding. however even if you have messed up and had more funding you are still entitled to the maintenance loan so even if you are asked to self-fund at all you can manage. good luck this time around i am sure you will find it a much better experience this time around.    based on the extra information you will probably only get the maintenance loan and have to self-fund which means that you may have to consider going part-time but that has its own bonuses because you can have a life and study during the day on your days off, and if funding changes or improves you can always up it to full-time later on.

But the abbreviation, OK, came first.|`|IIKwBSrxaa	I asked the same question.  Here was the answer I chose for best answer.<br>  <br>  OK is a quintessentially American term that has spread from English to many other languages. Its origin was the subject of scholarly debate for many years until Allen Walker Read showed that OK is based on a joke of sorts. OK is first recorded in 1839 but was probably in circulation before that date. During the 1830s there was a humoristic fashion in Boston newspapers to reduce a phrase to initials and supply an explanation in parentheses. Sometimes the abbreviations were misspelled to add to the humor. OK was used in March 1839 as an abbreviation for all correct, the joke being that neither the O nor the K was correct. Originally spelled with periods, this term outlived most similar abbreviations owing to its use in President Martin Van Buren's 1840 campaign for reelection. Because he was born in Kinderhook, New York, Van Buren was nicknamed Old Kinderhook, and the abbreviation proved eminently suitable for political slogans. That same year, an editorial referring to the receipt of a pin with the slogan O.K. had this comment: "frightful letters ... significant of the birth-place of Martin Van Buren, old Kinderhook, as also the rallying word of the Democracy of the late election, 'all correct' .... Those who wear them should bear in mind that it will require their most strenuous exertions ... to make all things O.K."|`|FKXhyjMQaa	It is used to indicate the affirmative or "all correct" <br>  <br>  OK is the shortened form of probably an african slave dialect where it was used to reply to a "massa" (master) in the affirmative of "kay massa" and has evolved in early english to okay. <br>  <br>  Another thought was the election of Martin Van Buren and his nick name of "Old Kinderhook"  or OK.  Vote for OK became the theme for the election.|`|yMRY5cgxaa	Go to below web address|`|R9nGOyC2aa	O.K. doesn't stand for anything.  It's like a shortened version of okay.  It's a colloquial term. <br>  <br>  Wikipedia:<br>  <br>  "The origins of OK are not known with certainty, and have been the subject of much discussion and academic interest over the years. As an interjection, it has been borrowed from English into many other languages."|`|Y0lIikmYaa	O.K. stands for oll korrect. Its a conspicoius misspelled all correct.

YupMCYHlaa	In 1606 there was a plot to blow up Parliament in England.  Barrels and barrels of gunpowder were found in the basement of the building (It is called 'The Gunpowder Plot').  The plotters were Roman Catholics who planned to restore Catholicism to England. Guy Fawkes was caught guarding the gunpowder, and he was executed. Every year in England they have bonfires on November 5 to commemorate Fawkes.  And there is a river named after him in Australia!   8^)    Google 'Guy Fawkes' or 'The Gunpowder Plot' and you'll get all the details.

1rMw79dXaa	First off, you should make sure you are able to focus. Too much studying can lead to space outs and a failure to retain information. If you find your self unable to focus on what you are trying to remember, take a break. As far as actual memorization goes, Try a few techniques until you find one that works well. Sometimes it may depend on the type of information you are trying to learn. Some things will work with some information, while other work with other bits. <br>  <br>  I personally use my photographic memory to my advantage. If you learn the words that are important, you can then start learning the order in which they were read while you were studying. That may be too hard for someone without a photographic memory however. <br>  <br>  Another method would be to use words easy for you to remember in relation to those you need to know. instead of learning everything word by word, simply teach yourself other words that will remind you of what you need to know.<br>  <br>  I porbably confused you but I tried!|`|9HTtnl43aa	if you are trying to expand your vocabulary, the best way is to read a lot. this way, you can learn new words in context and they are much easier to remember if they are attached to an idea. <br>    flashcards are a good aid, but if you try to remember words in isolation, it just "won't stick" in your mind. <br>    if you must use flashcards, take the word you are trying to memorize and use it in at least 3 sentences and, this is very important, read the sentences out loud. good luck|`|oeXnhiPWaa	It sounds boring but I find the best way to learn something is by writing it out. seriously, my notebook looks like something out of the Shining with page after page f the same thing. Also, I put post-it notes on my computer screen with short facts, so that every time I see them I remember them. Or as a more fun alternative, you could make up a game about facts, or whatever whereby you have to match up two things (say you were studying biology, you could have the organ and you would have to mach it up with it's function).|`|vtTUn0zcaa	Its good to study in intervals, the brain can only retain the first 30 minutes of information. flash cards would be good. also try studying in groups, you can help out each other. also, after u study put your head between your kness and leave it upside down for about 5 minutes. this helps the blood flow to your brain to better help you retain information.<br>  <br>  Hope i helped . =)|`|82oTjLCAaa	according to what is interesting....|`|UofhMpy9aa	lets play an online game of scrabble :D|`|9524d7997ff36a533388d8296b96a218aa	If you are attempting to learn vocabulary for a test -- for example the 15 words that will be on the science test next week -- I would try any of the suggestions that sounded good to you that have already been posted.  If you don't feel those are working, here is another one:  try association.  For example:  in math, I could never remember the difference between the quotient and the dividend.  One day, I came up with the following phrase "big, big bottom" which I associated with the word "rear-end" which is close to dividend which helped me remember that the dividend is (usually) the big number on the bottom of the division symbol.  See how that works?|`|44eaCT4Zaa	word association is the best way to learn new words.  Take the word and meaning you are trying to learn - associate with something you already know.  Sometimes it helps to break the word down into syllables and use the word association with each syllable.   Worked for me in learning medical terminology.  Hope this helps.<br>  <br>  As for study techniques, study right before you go to bed.  Scientific tests have proven that college students retained more material when studying and then immediately going to sleep without any other activities in between.|`|vVka4ZA0aa	When I took French, I did very well.<br>  Maybe it was because of the way my teacher taught...<br>  But we did that helped me was we would learn the word(s), then use them in sentences.

And then use them in sentences with the teacher.<br>  If you have someone to study with, definitely try texting/IMing/emailing/speaking in the other language as much as possible.<br>  If you do not, you may benefit from a tutor or a program that had audio.<br>  <br>  So once you learn a word, say it out loud. Use it in a sentence. Then write it down in a sentence. Basically treat it like your first language, when most people learn slang, they just naturally incorperate it into their everyday speech, well, use the same concept with the new word in your 2nd language.|`|8Ypkfr7jaa	If it requires memorization, you should be in a quiet place alone where you can say the words out loud.<br>  <br>  Care to answer? <a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;_ylt=Ah762dAE9KNFTESR.240eUnsy6IX;_ylv=3?qid=20090225080654AAuMzld">http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;...</a>|`|f1006988bdbdd7ae5e5276623f046308aa	I read books a lot.

ZUKz3XDvaa	EDIT:  Redone in re added "details"         1    First step is to figure out how much that money gets her.  This is basic math.  With $6.00 Charmaign can buy 10 comic books.  Or she could buy 5 superhero cards.    This is basically the same theory as the other problem.  You want to know a certain number of outcomes.  Where is she most limited?  The superhero cards.  She can only buy up to five.  So she has six options, 1,2,3,4,5 and of course, not buying any superhero cards.    Now, figure out how much money she has left depending on what she spends on the superhero cards and how many comic books it gets her.  The key in problem solving is to find some known limitations and work off of those.  In this problem, the limitation is the number of card packages she can afford.  There can't be more solutions than that plus 1 (allowing for not buying any card packages).         2  In your second problem, you HAVE to use four numbers.  They HAVE to be even.   The smallest number you can use is 2. If you use the smallest number three times (assuming you can repeat numbers), you find the biggest number you have to use.    2 + 2 + 2 = 6  24 - 6 = 18  18 + 2 + 2 + 2 = 24    You've ruled out anything larger than 18, and you know that you are using even numbers so the next number is 16.    16 + 4 + 2 + 2 = 24    then 14    14 + 6 + 2 + 2 = 24  14 + 4 + 4 + 2 = 24    this is just basic math at this point.    If there is also the limitation of not being allowed to repeat numbers, then the smallest numbers you can use are obviously 2, 4 and 6.    2 + 4 + 6 = 12  24 - 12 = 12    12 + 6 + 4 + 2 = 24  The next number is 10.  And so on.        EDIT:    I'm just removing my previous answer from before you added the additional details.  This is ridiculously long and the theory is the same and stated above.|`|3Phq56pCaa	3

7kMuF2rZaa	It could be interesting to compare and contrast what we now consider the 'cheap seats'. In the original Globe, the standing room closest to the stage was for the commoners, with the upper-class seated above in boxes, thereby avoiding the smell and detritus below.  Now the exact opposite is the case.  I would recommend starting the essay with a bizarre or overlooked fact about the theater itself, and find a way to tie it to the current theater. The wood used in construction, the distance people traveled to attend.   Alternatively, you can take a common assumption about the theater or Shakespeare and open with an assault upon this idea from an opposing viewpoint. For example, the speech and word usage in many of his works was antiquated even during his time. Therefore, much of his prose made audience member scratch their heads back then as well. You could brazenly mock this technique, (or perhaps gently chide...your choice) and use this stance as an opener. At the very least your perspective would be different and attention-grabbing.  Here's a title to start you in that mildly sarcastis direction:  Down In Front: How The Globe Theater Reinforced Social Disparity.    Best of luck.

vHxauOyeaa	just look up definitions and you'd be fine.<br>  <br>  I can give short ones though: <br>  Addiction: The body's physical or brain's psychological need for some thing. When speaking about drugs the body  wants or brain needs the substance. <br>  <br>  Withdrawal Symptoms: you get these when you stop giving your body the substance that you have developed a dependence on. They vary depending on the type of drug. If you are on heroin and stop you might get Delirium tremens where you shake and likely hallucinate. If you quit smoking cigarettes you might just get irritable or a compulsory need to eat or have something in your mouth. <br>  <br>  Tolerance: is about intake and abuse. In most cases the more often and higher amount of a substance that you abuse, you develop a tolerance which means that it will take more of that substance to get the high that you got when you started doing it.

So Basically people in the far corner of the Austrian Empire were Serbs who wanted Bosnia to leave the Austrian Empire and join with them (Serbia) so they could have their own lil Empire thingy.    At the Scene:  As the Archduke and his wife were driving along the riverside a bomb was dropped, but just misses them. So then the leader of the gang (Gavrilo Princip) that was trying to kill the Archduke thinks he's lost his chance and can't kill him anymore, so he goes and gets a sandwhich from the shop =] and then the Archduke and wife's car makes a change of route and goes down one of the side roads with that same sandwich shop!! so then he comes out the shop and is like "WOAHH" and he grabs his gun and shoots them both before shooting himself in the head.

You skipping detention was not right. Your Teacher has a right to give you detention after that. Your Teacher was over reacting by giving you the other punishments, you can easily tell that your teacher has no understanding of kids what so ever. If I had to go to detention for what the other students did, I would complain to my parents because I know they will do something about it. Your punishment was not fair, you have to take action to get things straight.|`|ea2c09a93f92d7f85f71f746000cb318aa	I would have my parents talk to the teacher, I know it sucks and everything, but teachers love to pull that, "one kid screws up and everyone is punished" thing.  I'm out of school, but I had teachers that did that all the time.  Have you tried apologizing to the teacher for forgetting to come to the detention, that might do a world of good.  Teachers want respect of their students and you showed disrepect when you didn't bother to show up, even though it was just an accident.  Things will get better, just play things strait for a while and you should see improvement.  Good luck!

There are other groups that will check your current qualifications and see if you have the required background and then certify you based on past experiences.<br>  <br>  The fastest way to get one of the "top" certifications is by studying and then taking the American Society for Quality (ASQ) - Certified Six Sigma Black Belt exam - <a href="http://www.asq.org/certification/six-sigma/prepare.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.asq.org/certification/six-sig...</a>   The ASQ has a number of local section who offer refresher course in this and other topics if you want more help.  You can contact the ASQ National group at 1-800-248-1946 to find out where the nearest Section / Chapter is to where you live.  You do NOT need to become a member of ASQ to take the exam!<br>  <br>  The ASQ also has a Green Belt that would be an easier exam to take depending on if you really need a Black Belt or just a recognized certification in Six Sigma.<br>  <br>  Either way, I would also suggest finding some reference materials (ASQ has full handbooks on both Black Belt and Green Belt) that you can use to start studying now.  There are many books and websites available - one good basic book that I have is: Six Sigma for the Shop Floor published by ASQ.  It is relatively inexpensive as Six Sigma books go and it covers all of the basics and talks about how to use the tools (versus just what the tools are).  You should try putting together a couple of Six Sigma projects on your own at your company so you can use them toward your certification.<br>  <br>  There is a lot more to all this, but hopefully this will get you started.

0HYfFZKVaa	You should definitely dress professional. Wear a suit with a jacket. Black, grey, or blue colors are great. Stay away from yellow, red and loud colors. NO PINK AND GREEN OR PEARLS. Be sure to wear earrings if you have ears pierced (studs no dangling jewelry) and If you would like a thin necklace with a small charm or no charm. Be sure to have your hair in check no crazy hairstyles, just something simple. A body wrap, curls or even and simple ponytail as long as it looks good. If you have polish on your nails make sure that they are all covered no chipped nails. Do this and you should be fine. GOOD LUCK!!!|`|t37BCTGvaa	I'd wear slacks or a pencil skirt, a blouse or sweater, and heels.  No sweats, jeans, or sneakers.

As children are always learning they will pick up the different objectives and udnerstand killing.<br>  But since this is in a safe environment, the worst a child can pick up is violent beahviour in the game, or stress related difficulties with the game itself.<br>  <br>  Deep psychological abnormalities have been known to be caused by exccive use of a violent game under no monitoring of a parent or carer. This can have a very strange affect on the child, as they will believe that killing is the right thing to do when in a similar situation.<br>  Leading to deep psychological problems, and violence towards others.<br>  <br>  It matters upon the age of the child, and the game's explicit content.<br>  As the child is older, they will udnerstand more and will have a higher risk of falling violent or seeing killing as the right thing to do.<br>  <br>  As age increases, so does the risk.<br>  I hope this helped

oZ39bLSkaa	I used Konos years and years ago. Unless they have changed it dramatically, it does not offer math or language arts, though you would be able to incorporate writing, using the topic studied as the jumping off point and a program such as Excellence in Writing to give you guidance on how to do this.<br>  <br>  Other LA topics not covered are grammar and spelling.<br>  <br>  Math can and is sometimes incorporated into unit studies but more as a supplement than covering the topic thoroughly. While it might be okay to approach math this way with young children, eventually one has to buckle down with something a little more formal.

If you are not already doing this. The cost of going to these schools is usually less than both a private institution and a state university. <br>  <br>  What many young people are doing now is to attend the first two years at a community college (to get their Associate's Degree & pay less), and then transferring to a college that grants four year degrees. Many private institutions offer scholarships for transfer students that have already earned a two year degree. If this option is available to you, you may want to consider it.

oqK4ADssaa	I think it depends on you, your family situation, and the laws of your state. For us it works. For others it doesn't. You need to look at the laws in your state before you and your mom make this decision. You can find them at www.hslda.org <br>  <br>  There are home school groups you can join for socialization, as well as sports teams, clubs, and classes that you can take. Just because you are "home schooled' doesn't mean you are ever at home.  <br>  <br>  For Sarah S: you are obviously a troll who knows absolutely nothing about home school. If you had the slightest clue you would know that home school is a rapidly growing choice in this country and when compared to the horrible education offered in some public schools it is the best option for those of us who can't afford private school. Are we that smart? Not necessarily and we don't have to be. The choice of curriculum that has been put together by teachers and educators is overwhelming. Why does mom need to know everything in order to teach? Do I have to know every aspect to evolution to teach that some believe we evolved from pond scum? Not really. Do I teach evolution? Why yes I do (thanks to publishers like Apoligia) that way my kids have the keys to defeat the world view in arguments and win souls for Christ. Are we all religious nut jobs? No, believe it or not there are even atheists that home school. So before you step where you don't belong try doing a little research and educating yourself with the facts before trying to educate us in your opinion.|`|dx3jXzuxaa	The answer to your question depends on what you want to accomplish. There are literally hundreds of different ways to "homeschool" and it would be foolish to go into a home school situation without a specific game plan. <br>  <br>  You say that you don't have a lot of friends, so I'm guessing that the social interaction issue is important for you. This is another area where you need to decide what you want to do. There are many different ways for you to make friends or get involved with programs that will help deal with just about any issue a 13 year old might need to deal with. <br>  <br>  Decide what your academic and social goals are, then examine the available alternatives, both in a home school setting and in various school settings (public, charter, private, and so on), then decide which path makes the most sense for where you want to go. Discus the possibilities with your mother, and others whose opinions you respect.|`|98a1aa89f409b8433bf738429e4cb1fdaa	My son went to half of the first grade.  <br>  <br>  He has been home schooled ever since.  <br>  <br>  He is now 20 years old, and in college, and has a 3.7 GPA.  His classmates vary from 17 to 50 years old, and he can get along with all of them.  <br>  <br>  Home schooling is so great for someone your age.  You can concentrate on learning, and not worry about stuff like popularity and fads and the rumor mill.  <br>  <br>  You can volunteer, or join a club, or stuff like that, and make some friends.  You don't have to sit home and stare at a book or a screen all day.  Take field trips, discover your local library, <br>  <br>  A good place to start is to research the laws for home schooling in your state.  They vary from "Just don't set the kid on fire" to requiring regular progress reports every so many weeks.|`|1RhiLgmBaa	Why not?<br>  <br>  It's so much more easier, and you don't feel over whelmed.|`|r3rp1zCYaa	A very good decision.<br>  <br>  Homeschoolers typically are more successfull and do way better on tests.  And if you are worried about being lonely, many homeschool organizations have social things of different kinds for the homeschooled kids using their programs.<br>  <br>  Also, many homeschooled kids want to be homeschooled for the same reason as you, so if you go to one of the social things, you won't have a problem with anyone being mean.

AA10770425	Disney program is for people currently in college or the semester after they graduate. Someone already posted the official website. You would either be signing up for a semester or semester advanced which includes the summer. They pay minimum wage which is $7.17 I believe in Florida right now. They take rent out of your pay check, you do still have to pay for food. You are living in an apartment with 2, 4, 6, or 8 other cast members. There is no tuition because it is considered an internship. There a few classes you can take, but I don't recommend them as they take up your time and you'd be rather playing in the parks. Once you are down there working you can go to casting calls for characters. They have them every couple of months. From my knowledge most people start as "fur" characters (example, Pooh bear, Tigger, the ones in full costume) and then become "face" characters (the princesses, the prince, etc) During the college program you are most likely not going to be cast as a character. You will have to go to an audition for that. Most of the jobs for the college program aren't the most desirable, but it's all about the experience you get out of it. Good Luck, It was probably the most fun thing I did in college.|`|mGubEYTRaa	Here is all the information on this website.

LN07HZLsaa	Hi Kristiane! @_@    Be proud you're an UPCAT Passer!    You know, when we had our FWA (Freshman Welcome Assembly) at UP Theater at UP Diliman, the Chancellor of UP Diliman and President of the Board of Regents of UP System announced overwhelmingly that only 11% of all UPCAT examiners are able to pass UP campuses, and only 3% make it to Diliman.    That's why I know how you eager to be on Diliman, despite you made it on UP Manila.    First of all, I want to know what course you passed on UP Manila. You pointed out that you haven't been on the course you applied for. Let me ask you, how do you know that the course you made in Manila is not the one you chose? UPCAT form asked you to write all courses you intended to be if ever you will make it to UP, but how come you had a different course? Suppose you had the right and the power to put you wanted course to your form, it is still doubtful that UP forces you to take that course. ^_^    Maybe you were DPWAS (Degee Program with Available Slots).    Yes, you could transfer to Diliman! Well, UP still like common schools. Unlike common schools, it provide highest quality of education in the Philippines. If you are going to ask the University Registrar in UP Manila, maybe they will never let you transfer out. Here, I may suggest you options to do:    a. Ask the University Registrar (UR) of UP Manila. Ask them if they will let you transfer out to another UP campus even though you haven't started studying there. Remember to say, UP campus, not other schools.    b. Go to UP Diliman OUR (Office of UR). Ask them too if they will accept freshmen transferees that haven't been started school year yet. Do this on summer before the advanced registration.    c. If ever you were DPWAS, look if your cut-off grade satisfies the course you want to apply for (in Diliman, or Manila if you will not be able to transfer) PLUS if there are still available slots for that course. Even though you are a DPWAS, there is no assurance that the course that you will apply has still available slots. Majority of courses have their own quota for limited slots (I think you heard it), and I beg that I can never tell you because even I, I do not know what the hell those courses are (I am a freshman this semester in Diliman).    d. So, I had my friend who passed Baguio has the same problem with you but he passed his course there. He wanted to transfer to Diliman because Baguio is very far (he lives in Metro Manila) and doesn't want to stay in a dormitory. He asked the UR of Baguio to permit him to transfer, but UR refuses, they said that he must stay for at least one semester in Baguio to be able to transfer to UP. And unfortunately, even though he came from the same unit in UP System, not all courses in Diliman is opened for acceptance of transferees.    e. What if option (d) applies to your position? If you are a DPWAS, look for the best possible course that you like that has available slots. Study harder ?most of departments offering cou?rses in Diliman requires good to high grades plus interview, etc. Make sure that throughout the school year, set your goal to your preferred course in Diliman--know when they will accept transferees among others. Try to reach out possible people.    Now since some of the courses do not accept transferees for second semester, if you are already enrolled in Manila but you still want for Diliman, you have to wait for the first semester. In this process, you will assess if "napapamahal ka na" in UP Manila and the course you chosen.    Anyway, UP Manila has the highest cut-off grade, 2.500 (I reckon you know system of grades here, similar to college, students who had 1.000 on UPCAT are usually INTARMED candidates as well as Oblation Scholars), then you must be proud of that you will be on UP Manila! UP Manila has the highest cut-off because it has the most attractive courses on earth (joke! only in the Philippines), BS Computer Science and (though every UP campuses have BS ComSci, but they do not have the blockbuster...) BS Nursing.    Good luck to your college life! Proud to be a Fighting Maroon. Welcome to the University of the Philippines!
xIycylRNaa	Uh... this wasn't hard for me..  last year I came up with an idea that shocked my teacher, and I got an A+.... it was pretty unique..  I did a project about how the environment effects tadpoles.  now, if your afraid of killing a few tadpoles, this is not for you. but really, only like 30 outta 500 died.  what you do is, you get some tadpoles, some still eggs, and some hatched, sort them out into different containers, and put different things in there.  I put, manure, pesticides, oil run-off, anti-freeze run off, & a random one, bug spray (the DEET kills them)..  then monitor how they do each day. actually, for the first day, I did it in hours, so the first 4 hours are crucial.     yah.. you can do that if you want, there are more detials, but its a good project, I learned a lot, plus fun.|`|v1xDXHG5aa	These sites have lots of science fair project ideas:    http://www.usc.edu/CSSF/Resources/Gettin...    http://www.sciencebuddies.org/    http://www.all-science-fair-projects.com...    http://www.ipl.org/div/projectguide/    http://school.discoveryeducation.com/sci...    http://www.picadome.fcps.net/lab/sci_fai...    http://www.scienceproject.com/    http://www.energyquest.ca.gov/projects/i...    http://www.freesciencefairproject.com/    http://www.hometrainingtools.com/article...|`|3149d8c79c2c2fd573c8fb1acb44e350aa	http://chemistry.about.com/od/sciencefai...  http://www.science-ideas.com/middle-proj...

My main message is that you don't have to have some bachelors in education to pursue a teaching credential.  <br>  <br>  What you should do is go to the website of the school you want to apply to for your teaching certificate/credential and look at their Education Department --> Graduate Studies.

This really hurt their brand image.  It was a huge controversy when they pulled Classic Coke from the market- with people demanding it back.

333648a40b57c0c7b0a26b7b121beb0eaa	I'd say you have two basic options: informative or attention getting.<br>  <br>  there are three main points here: the people, the mexican war, and the manifest destiny. find a common thread, like 'change' or some sort of timeline, or anything that will help you move from one of these three topics to the next through your paper. focus the thesis around that. something like, <br>  <br>  "The Alamo and the heroes it involved were crutial in leading the country in a new era of change." <br>  <br>  (or something like that; i dont know the details) the idea is that, once you've set something like that sentance up, it can give you structure for your entire paper: start by talking about the people involved, then mention how they, and the alamo, were responsible for change in two ways: mexican war and manifest destiny, and then you can talk about those two events in whatever order makes more sense for one to have helped cause the other.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  or you could go with something more attention getting. since it's the alamo you're talknig about, there's always the phrase that almost everyone knows "Remember the Alamo!" you could start with something like <br>  <br>  "Remember the Alamo! It's a popular phrase, but not everyone knows the story of the people who staked their lives on that day, or the key changes it brought about."<br>  <br>  and then you can still go with the type of structure I mentioned above.|`|xJoMSkI5aa	Five thousand Mexican soldiers under General Santa Anna lay siege to the Alamo, a mission church in San Antonio, Texas, being used as a makeshift fortress by Anglo-Texan rebels. Thirteen days later, on 6 March, the Mexican forces attack the Alamo and its 189 defenders. Only sixteen women, children, and servants survive. Among the slain are frontiersman and former congressman Davy Crockett (who uses his musket, "Old Betsy," as a club in his final hours), Jim Bowie (inventor of the Bowie knife), and a group of Texan and America volunteers. "Remember the Alamo" becomes a rallying cry for Sam Houston's Texan forces.<br>  <br>  From Shmoop/Alamo/Manifest Destiny and Mexican American War|`|l1xvFbhnaa	On February 23 of 1836, General Antonio Lopez de Santa Anna began a siege against the Alamo, a fort whose ownership was hotly disputed by Americans, Mexicans, and independents alike. Hopelessly outnumbered and unable to receive any additional aid from outside forces after the first week of battle, the fight for the Alamo was recognized by its defenders as a battle to the death. Lieutenant Colonel William Barret Travis, the leader of the fort's defenders, is quoted as having remarked: "I am determined to sustain myself as long as possible and die like a soldier who never forgets what is due to his own honor and that of his country - Victory or Death."

AA10407542	I started at a YMCA preschool and it was an excellent center with everything possible there.  So, to answer your question, it really depends.  I do not think that just because a center costs more that it translates to better care.  YOU will decide this mom.  Its important to visit centers.  Watch how the transitions are, staff ratios, toileting practices, snack etc. etc.  You have special needs that will be met if you find the one that is right for you.   To explain further the difference..<br>  <br>  YMCA is part of the united way which is one of the largest non-profits in the US.  A preschool within the YMCA has a limited budget but still has one.  Program needs are met and typically they are well run facilities.  When you have one of the profit centers, that you mention above, they do have more $ which in turn can translate to newer facilities, higher paid staff, better ratios, etc. etc.  However, this doesn't Always happen.  Sometimes the money is used for profit rather than meeting needs.  For profit organizations are usually better in the PR dept.  They can sell themselves very well and this is why, just like with any decision, you need to investigate the center.  Know this one rule "Each center is different and they all cant meet your needs"<br>  <br>  Here is  great article for you to read that outlines items of what you should look for in what you call a "quality" program.  NAEYC has many other articles that I encourage you to look over.<br>  <br>  Academy for Early Childhood Program Accreditation<br>  NAEYC Home.

c55O7jqXaa	If your child is having a hard time reading it may just mean she is being pushed before she is ready or even being overwhelmed. I suggest going back to the basic. Make sure she clearly understands what each letter sound makes, teach her the phonic rules first and then also the sight words. They have lots of games out there that make sight words fun. <br>  <br>  You can even make them at home. Play Bingo with some of the most common words that you see in books. Do red rover bring the The word over and by the end she makes a sentence and reads it with your help if they are harder words. <br>  <br>  There is no one right way to teach how to read. Some children learn by a mix of phonics and sight and others are purely sight readers. <br>  <br>  starfall. com is great and I have found that click n kid is a great computer program too. <br>  <br>  Abeka also has some great programs on dvd where they actually have a teacher teach them. <br>  <br>  I suggest reading to her, continue to let her pick out the books that interest her at the library. Make reading fun and not a task as so many schools do these days. <br>  <br>  Make sure to have her eyesight checked out, talk to the Teacher on why she thinks she might be having problems, possible dyslexia? ask lots and lots of questions and find out why she isn't wanting to learn or there is a delay. She may not be ready yet.|`|THCOzCW7aa	I don't know of any DVD's for that age range other than the Between the Lions series on PBS, but there are a number of programs on the market you can use to help her.

uhYKsDjRaa	These are called simultaneous equations. You are comparing sets of values to each other. In this case we are going to set up one equation that tells how many tickets were sold, and the other equation will tell how much money was collected. That's the key to solving these type problems. I'm going to use the variables A and C; A is adult    and    C is children  12A will represent the number of Adult tickets sold at 12 dollars  7C   will represent the number of Children tickets sold at 7 dollars   and that combination will make 18,430 dollars  or    12A + 7C  =  18430    The other equation is a little simpler. A tickets sold + C tickets sold = the total tickets sold  or     A  +  C  = 2010    Now we have 2 equations that we can use to compare against each other.    12A + 7C  =  18430     A  +  C  =    2010    The next step is to try an eliminate one of the variables. We are going to multiply the second equation times 12 to get    12A + 7C  =  18430  (first equation)  12A  + 12C  = 24120    Now we subtract the two equations  The 12A is gone and we now have just C's     - 5 C   = - 5690   Divide both sides by -5       C = 1138    Now put the value of 1138 into either equation to find A  A + C(1138)  = 2010  Subtract 138 from both sides  A =  872    The trick is to find two comparisons. Usually one of the equations will have a dollar amount, and the other will just have a quantity amount.

zQZ2uz3Paa	I was thinking the same thing after I saw the movie. But then it hit me: it is actually a reference to Shakespeare's "The Merchant of Venice" (in which this character, Antonio, has to pay a debt he owes. But the person he owes the money to asks for a pound of flesh instead).    So, after Tim kills 7 people in the car accident, he feels he is forever in debt to these people. And the only way he can ever repay them is by giving 7 people each one pound of his "flesh." He knows that, by doing so, he will die. But this is the only way he can repay his mistake (or debt), kind of like Antonio in Shakespeare's play.

S5H0NmEWaa	I suspect the task is to show that you are able to do the things that writers do in the first chapter of a novel, not necessarily to have a whole novel planned.     The purpose of a novel's first chapter is to set the context and introduce the characters, so maybe you should think about a scenario and characters which you think would make the ingredients of a good story, even if you don't know what you would write next. Try picking up a few novels and reading the first chapter to see how it's done and to compare. And you don't necessarily need to have a neat ending - in fact, that's probably inadvisable, because you'd want people to read on at the end of the first chapter.
rYJDsc4Xaa	A little context is useful:    Two households, both alike in dignity,  In fair Verona, where we lay our scene,  From ancient grudge break to new mutiny,  Where civil blood makes civil hands unclean.  From forth the fatal loins of these two foes  A pair of star-cross'd lovers take their life;  Whose misadventur'd piteous overthrows  Do with their death bury their parents' strife.  The fearful passage of their death-mark'd love,  And the continuance of their parents' rage,  Which, but their children's end, nought could remove,  Is now the two hours' traffic of our stage;  The which if you with patient ears attend,  What here shall miss, our toil shall strive to mend.      Two noble families in Verona break out into violence over an ancient grudge. Into these two families is born a pair of ill-fated lovers whose unfortunate and pitiful disasters ended the battle between their houses. The story of their doomed love and the persistence of their parents' anger, which could be ended by nothing but their children's death, is the subject of our play.  If you listen patiently, we will try to fill in all the blanks.

So, 400 J = 1/2*[m*(22.352 m/s*22.352 m/s)]    400 J = 1/2*[m*499.611904(m*m)/(s*s)]     800 J = m*499.611904(m*m)/(s*s)     ANSWER:  1.60124287 kg = m      (2) 35 mph must be changed to m/s, if mph is miles per hour, then 35mph = 15.6464 m/s    KE=1/2[50kg*(15.6464 m/s*15.6464 m/s)]  KE=1/2[50kg*244.809833(m*m)/(s*s)]  KE=1/2(12240.4916J)    ANSWER:  KE=6120.2458 J      (3) GPE=mgh and this time, everything is already using correct units, so    GPE= 120kg*9.8m/(s*s)*78m    ANSWER:  GPE= 91,728 J      (4)  Well, I would like to know if that is 850m/s or mph, but I will assume it's m/s.

Examples  The form stems from medieval French poetry - the earliest written examples are from the late 13th century. The triolet is a close cousin of the rondeau, another French verse form emphasizing repetition and rhyme. Some of the earliest known triolets composed in English were written by the Benedictine monk Patrick Carey, who purportedly used them in his devotions. British poet Robert Bridges reintroduced the triolet to the English language, where it enjoyed a brief popularity among late-nineteenth-century British poets.    An effective conventional triolet achieves two things; firstly the naturalness of the refrain and secondly the alteration of the refrain's meaning.

It would be nearly impossible, let alone cost ineffective, to convert all of our equipment to metrics, so we continued to use our system.    Gradually there has been a shift, where nowadays we have a mix of customary and metric... for example, soda is measured in liters instead of ounces (think a 2 liter soda bottle), and many odometers in cars give both the miles per hour and kph measurements.     Other than familiarity, the US is in a huge recession. Switching over to metrics would cost a great deal of money, not to mention education. As a high school teacher, I know that many science curriculums no longer require knowledge of metrics, nor are high stakes tests including conversions. If it's not tested, it's hardly ever taught. At least that's the direction of education these days.     And it worries me that there is an entire generation of kids that have not had to learn cm, meters, kilometers, etc. I remember it was drilled into my head, but if schools aren't pushing for it, and if manufacturers aren't pushing for it, and our government can't afford to do it, then why fix something that's not broken??|`|skiPYyGDaa	google it

The radius is 1/2 the diameter, right? When you take tests this is pretty common so be careful!)            Area   =   3.14 * 21^2         Area   =    3.14 * 441 and that becomes 1384.74    But they want the answer in sq. ft   Since a foot has 12" a square foot is just 12" times 12 " or 144 square in.

N9cvnMQCaa	I agree with the first answer. Go to the local school supply store and buy a planner. Organize your time and keep in mind when all of your clubs meet. Make sure you have plenty of time for homework, but plan wisely and appropriatly (such as dont put homework around 6-7pm, you know you will eat dinner around then) and keep in mind all of your extracurricular after school activities. Here is an example that may help you. I do not know your schedule so this is approximate.     8:00am-3:00pm: School  3:00pm-4:00pm: Oboe practice  4:45-5:00: FREE TIME  5:00-6:00: Piano  6:00pm-7:00pm: Dinner  7:00pm-9:00pm: Homework    Once again I do not know your schedule so this example may not be great but its just an example and be sure to know about how much homework you have for the night.

Paper Airplanes  http://www.paperplane.org/index.html           A paper plane, paper aeroplane, paper glider, paper airplane or paper dart is a toy plane made out of paper. It is also sometimes called aerogami, after origami (the Japanese art of paper folding). In Japanese, it is called kamihikki (). It is popular in Hawaii because it is one of the easiest types of origami for a novice to master. The most basic paper plane would only take at most six steps to "correctly" complete. The term "paper plane" can also refer to those made from cardboard.    The use of paper airplanes to create toys, is believed to have originated 2,000 years ago in China, where kites were a popular form of entertainment. Leonardo da Vinci is often cited as the inventor of paper planes, although this is debatable since the Chinese invented both paper and the kite. However, he did make reference to building a model plane out of parchment. Arguably the father of model gliders was George Cayley, who built hand-launched kite-like gliders made from linen in the early 1800s. Although these can be considered to be evidence for the modern paper plane, one cannot be sure where exactly the invention originated.    The earliest known date of the creation of modern paper planes was said to have been in 1909. However, the most accepted version of the creation was two decades later in 1930 by Jack Northrop (Co-founder of Lockheed Corporation). Northrop had used paper planes as tests of ideas for flying real-life aircraft.  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paper_plane|`|AA11222724	I reckon you should go into the history of them, see if the ones people made years ago are similar to ones today with illustrations, also imaginative uses- you could throw it open to your audience as i find as a professional artist when i give workshops that interaction engages the audience.

Some uses- 1, filling time out when bored in office, 2, recycling old paper, 3, make one with your most hated celeb on so you can throw it, 4, two make great stilts for ants, 5, a circle of them make a great elizabethan ruff, etc...|`|YNbgnZD2aa	How about talking about flight itself -- lift, weight, drag, thrust, etc.|`|dycC1Lxoaa	If u r trying to fill up space, talk about the aerodynamacy of diff. paper airplanes, or even real airplanes, and then compare them|`|2daf1f643b0222e20fe97c10246019f0aa	Try these:  the shape of the plane and wind resistance, the size of the wings for lift and the sharp paper creases for distance.

rwldhsCqaa	I live in england and in our school we do have extra curricular activities but not so much extra courses.   What we can do is join a club i.e. 'Keyboard club' or 'Art club' and learn/improve skills in those areas.  However i do not think that there is a way to gain any extra 'credit' or marks or grades.  The best thing you can do to find out is ask your tutors if there is anything you can do, Each school is different and yours may have more oppurtunities than others.  If you cannot do anything to gain extra credit but you would still like to do something then further your knowledge in an area your struggling, i.e. spend your lunches revising maths, or learn a new skill like a musical instrument.    However just keep in mind lunchtimes are there for a reason, if you are working none stop you can suffer from mental fatigue and this could worsen your ability in the lessons after lunch. It's all about balance, dont miss out every lunch time but if you really want to do something extra take 1 or 2 lunches a week to do it.    Hope this helped,  Goodluck.|`|qV77sbc8aa	It might be.

There is a lot of very difficult work, and you have to get really good grades at school/college to get in.

NzvXINyGaa	Viewing llearning as a game also helps in teachings. Or a small reward like candy or a break. The reward could be something simple like a hand slap or proving to him that reading is very effective.    KISS "Keep it simple stupid". Is the same application that you should present yourself to the child.     If you can draw, I recommend, (that is if your willing to) doing flash cards with visual learning.    Always smile, and be postive but stay focused on the child because they tend to get lazy and slack if they see you are not paying attention. They are acaully quite smart when your not looking, then again you probably won't be have you back turned when your teaching him/her. That was my experince being a Karate instructor.    Pretend it's not even work, and alwys present the Reading subject as a game. I have approached it like that for years and I have come up with amazing results.    I hope this helps, e-mail me if you have anymore child psychology questions.    shotojojo@yahoo.com    It gets easier with experince.    Hope that helped.|`|ad87d36127978692cfedaa1ad4709a13aa	I don't mean to sound mean, but if you're not a teacher, maybe you shouldn't be tutoring. Fifth grade is a very critical time as far as reading is concerned, you should be teaching inference, cause and effect, and many other topics. If you're still committed to tutoring, go to your nearest teacher bookstore ( Becker's, Lakeshore, etc) and get some good fifth grade reading workbooks. I recommend Spectrum workbooks. They are very good, and aligned with many standardized tests. Good Luck.
0rfojt9Paa	Whom has been dying an agonizing death for decadesyoull notice there are no Whoms in Dr. Seusss Whoville. Many people never use the word in speech at all. However, in formal writing, critical readers still expect it to be used when appropriate. The distinction between who and whom is basically simple: who is the subject form of this pronoun and whom is the object form. Who was wearing that awful dress at the Academy Awards banquet? is correct because who is the subject of the sentence. The MC was so startled by the neckline that he forgot to whom he was supposed to give the Oscar is correct because whom is the object of the preposition to. So far so good.    Now consider this sort of question: Who are you staring at? Although strictly speaking the pronoun should be whom, nobody who wants to be taken seriously would use it in this case, though it is the object of the preposition at. (Bothered by ending the sentence with a preposition? See my Non-Errors page.) Whom is very rarely used even by careful speakers as the first word in a question, and many authorities have now conceded the point.    There is another sort of question in which whom appears later in the sentence: I wonder whom he bribed to get the contract? This may seem at first similar to the previous example, but here whom is not the subject of any verb in the sentence; rather it is part of the noun clause which itself is the object of the verb wonder. Here an old gender-biased but effective test for whom can be used. Try rewriting the sentence using he or him. Clearly He bribed he is incorrect; you would say he bribed him. Where him is the proper word in the paraphrased sentence, use whom.    Instances in which the direct object appears at the beginning of a sentence are tricky because we are used to having subjects in that position and are strongly tempted to use who: Whomever Susan admired most was likely to get the job. (Test: She admired him. Right?)    Where things get really messy is in statements in which the object or subject status of the pronoun is not immediately obvious. Example: The police gave tickets to whoever had parked in front of the fire hydrant. The object of the preposition to is the entire noun clause, whoever had parked in front of the fire hydrant, but whoever is the subject of that clause, the subject of the verb had parked. Heres a case where the temptation to use whomever should be resisted.    Confused? Just try the he or him test, and if its still not clear, go with who. Youll bother fewer people and have a fair chance of being right.|`|GEZNFaFZaa	whom. Its in the predicate and is describing an object or the verb so it is whom.

rwldhsCqaa	Although anatomy is a good subject to have... I would not advice it for what you want to do.   Enviromental science would be good however (depending on which guide the tutor is following) it can be more revolved around the enviroment and plants and photosynthesis and so on instead of animals.  Argiscience will be very much the same.    On balance i would advise you to go for Enviromental science as it's more of a balance, more hands on and it will teach you about the animals habitats and way of life i.e. Diet... Instead of just the insides of that animal (which would be more useful for the Vetenary proffesian) or the life of plants and stuff (more useful for herbolagists)    However the decision is yours, it should be something you are interested in and will enjoy... as they are all sciences (something you seem to like) this shouldnt be a problem =)    Good luck.|`|ODU3TO4Eaa	Any of those would be good, but the best might be Anatomy.

When _______ started the leadership program, my ambition to be apart of grade 8 grew.  Unfortunately, the one thing I didn't think about was how little time I would have to do these amazing things. Now that Im finally in grade 8, I realize my time is short; in about 6 months, I will have to say goodbye to everything and everyone.

laeIWaoxaa	The general term "ice age" or, more precisely, "glacial age" denotes a geological period of long-term reduction in the temperature of the Earth's surface and atmosphere, resulting in an expansion of continental ice sheets, polar ice sheets and alpine glaciers. Within a long-term ice age, individual pulses of extra cold climate are termed "glaciations". Glaciologically, ice age implies the presence of extensive ice sheets in the northern and southern hemispheres; by this definition we are still in an ice age (because the Greenland and Antarctic ice sheets still exist).    More colloquially, when speaking of the last few million years, "the" ice age refers to the most recent colder period with extensive ice sheets over the North American and Eurasian continents: in this sense, the most recent ice age peaked, in its Last Glacial Maximum about 20,000 years ago. This article will use the term ice age in the former, glaciological, sense: glacials for colder periods during ice ages and interglacials for the warmer periods.|`|s7iUaI2naa	The general term "ice age" or, more precisely, "glacial age" denotes a geological period of long-term reduction in the temperature of the Earth's surface and atmosphere, resulting in an expansion of continental ice sheets, polar ice sheets and alpine glaciers.

This article will use the term ice age in the former, glaciological, sense: glacials for colder periods during ice ages and interglacials for the warmer periods.  The idea that in the past glaciers had been far more extensive was folk knowledge in some alpine regions of Europe: Imbrie and Imbrie (1979) quote a woodcutter by the name of Jean-Pierre Perraudin[3] telling Jean de Charpentier of the former extent of the Grimsel glacier in the Swiss Alps.[4] Macdougall (2004) claims the person was a Swiss engineer named Ignaz Venetz,[5] but no single person invented the idea.[6] Between 1825 and 1833, Charpentier assembled evidence in support of the concept. In 1836 Charpentier, Venetz and Karl Friedrich Schimper convinced Louis Agassiz, and Agassiz published the hypothesis in his book tude sur les glaciers (Study on Glaciers) of 1840.[7] According to Macdougall (2004), Charpentier and Venetz disapproved of the ideas of Agassiz who extended their work claiming that most continents were once covered by ice.  At this early stage of knowledge, what was being studied were the glacial periods within the past few hundred thousand years, during the current ice age. The existence of ancient ice ages was as yet unsuspected.      ^^^ Hope this helped|`|bYjercAqaa	It usually sets in about 7 years after you're married........|`|fIkriTAQaa	Go here: http://www.wisegeek.com/what-is-an-ice-a...|`|ME9KuqYIaa	An ice age is a long period, in a large area, of time with the average temperature below 32 degrees F or 0 degrees C.

The University of California, San Diego has ranked in the top 10 for the last few years as well - for undergraduate and graduate study.  New York University has an excellent program, also in the top 10, as does Stanford, the University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, University of California, Berkeley, and, my favorite, Columbia University.  If you're looking for state schools with more reasonable tuition than Harvard, Stanford, Princeton, MIT and Yale, look into U of M (University of Michigan), the entire University of California system pretty much has high rankings in the political science arena (every university in the UC system is within the top 50) and the State University of New York system (I graduated from the University at Buffalo with my undergraduate and I can personally attest that it is an affordable alternative to Yale and Harvard and it still came in the top 50)  What you should be doing is studying the top rankings for the best graduate schools for the political science program on sites like US News and World Report, and looking into those - if they have a stellar graduate program, they have a stellar undergraduate program since the same professors and doctorate students are teaching and TAing there.|`|i8G7nColaa	loves it all the way...|`|cHVsBKCqaa	Harvard.

DCPWT4feaa	This is one of those weird, technical double-speaks, and I'm speaking here not from expertise, but from years of understanding technology intuitively (I was a computer technical support specialist for almost a decade) and parsing out the jargon.    This is a three-phase, double-back phrase like "de-reconstruct," where the action is done, undone, then done again.  So we'll take it in steps.    "Bouncing" is the term for a reaction by an electronic input, like a mouse button or keypad press, that responds both on the depress and the release.  Imagine that if you fired a hand gun by squeezing the trigger too hard, that two bullets fired instead of one - one on the squeeze, and one, ostensibly, on the "bounce back" of the trigger returning to rest.  That's bounce.    In electronics, it means getting two responses for a control instead of one.  This is most irritating with toggle functions.  If you're a computer gamer, I'm sure you've had the experience (during immense, on-line lag) of toggling on a buff spell or ability, and immediately watching it turn back off, triggering an irritating cool-down.  Or tapped that channel change on the remote once, only to watch two channels actually go by.  In the analog world, I have the very irritating habit of walking into a dark room and flipping the light switch on, then immediately flipping it back off again as my hand comes down.  Those are all "bounce" issues.    So, if that's "bounce," then what is "debounce?"  Debounce is any code, circuit dampening, or process that reads the "intent" of the input and prevents it from being over-driven by a second input in too short a time-frame.  The input reads both the "real" and "erroneous" inputs, but detects the second one in too close an interval to the first, making it suspicious and thereby ignoring it.  If it is tested that a click of a mouse button on a particular feature in a video game should not occur more than once every 3/10ths of a second, a second read in 15/100ths of a second (presumably on the mouse-up) will be ignored as input, even though it registers.    So, that's "debounce."  What is "undebounced?"  Well, simply bounce input that either hasn't been screened or filtered by any attempt, or bounce that has been filtered, but was failed to be trapped.    I don't know how often you use Yahoo! Answers, but if you type as much text as I do, and make as many mistakes as I do, you'll find that the backspace key works...MOST of the time.  Then there are moments when something else happens.  A lag, a delay, probably associated with server polling.  Suddenly, backspace doesn't produce any result, so you tap twice.  And after the lag settles, you erase two letters instead of one.  That's an "undebounced" response, largely because the original cause isn't traditional bounce (it is the lag, not the code responsible), and so the bounce isn't being filtered for.    Try it!  Type a huge block of text, then every few seconds try to erase one letter and see what happens!  Congrats!  You've been "undebounced!"    I don't speak German, so I can't help there.  But I know the structure of German, so you're probably looking for something along the lines of "stutter not stopped" or "overkill not prevented" or "extra step (or action) not prevented."    If you're writing a technical manual, there may already be an accepted term for this in German.  You might try a public tech forum, or use the information I've given you to hunt for a localized version of some existing tech manual related to the technology.

Some high schools offer such classes, and they can sometimes help.     If you can bring your SAT score up, I want you to look at the Teacher's Academy at Hunter and at Queens. If you are accepted to that, you'll go to the college tuition free.   http://www.hunter.cuny.edu/school-of-edu...|`|AA12063594	Ive heard that Cuny colleges were quite easy to get into and with your GPA being above average you'll have a foot in the door.

ffAmoqFTaa	Prohibition began on January 16, 1920, when the Eighteenth Amendment went into effect.  During Prohibition, the manufacture, transportation, import, export, and sale of alcoholic beverages were restricted or illegal. Prohibition was supposed to lower crime and corruption, reduce social problems, lower taxes needed to support prisons and poorhouses, and improve health and hygiene in America. Instead, Alcohol became more dangerous to consume; organized crime blossomed; courts and prisons systems became overloaded; and endemic corruption of police and public officials occurred.

Mackenzie had previously crossed North America in 1789 as well, but had turned north at the Continental Divide, also becoming the first European to reach the western Arctic Ocean.      Louisiana Purchase and a western expedition     Front of the sculpture showing Meriwether Lewis, William Clark, Sacagawea, and her baby Jean-Baptiste Charbonneau in Kansas City, Missouri.   Back of the sculpture commemorating Lewis and Clark's stop on the bluffs in Kansas CIty, showing York and the Newfoundland dog "Seaman."   The famous map of Lewis and Clark's expedition. It changed mapping of northwest America by providing the first accurate depiction of the relationship of the sources of the Columbia and Missouri rivers, and the Rocky Mountains.In 1803, the Louisiana Purchase sparked interest in expansion to the west coast. The United States did not know just what it was buying, and even France was unsure how much land it was selling. A few weeks after the purchase, President Thomas Jefferson, an advocate of western expansion, had Congress appropriate $2,500 for an expedition. In a message to Congress, Jefferson wrote:    "The river Missouri, and Indians inhabiting it, are not as well known as rendered desirable by their connection with the Mississippi, and consequently with us.... An intelligent officer, with ten or twelve chosen men ... might explore the whole line, even to the Western Ocean..."[1]    Thomas Jefferson had long thought about such an expedition, but was concerned about the danger. While in France from 17851789, he had heard of numerous plans to better explore the Pacific Northwest. In 1785, Jefferson learned that King Louis XVI of France planned to send a mission there, reportedly as a mere scientific expedition. Jefferson found that doubtful, and evidence provided by John Paul Jones confirmed these doubts. In either event, the mission was destroyed by bad weather after leaving Botany Bay in 1788. In 1786 John Ledyard, who had sailed with Captain James Cook to the Pacific Northwest, told Jefferson that he planned to walk across Siberia, ride a Russian fur-trade vessel to cross the ocean, and then walk all the way to the American capital. Since Ledyard was an American, Jefferson hoped he would succeed. Ledyard had made it as far as Siberia when Empress Catherine the Great had him arrested and deported back to Poland.[2]    The American expedition to the Pacific northwest was intended to study the Indian tribes, botany, geology, Western terrain and wildlife in the region, as well as evaluate the potential interference of British and French Canadian hunters and trappers who were already well established in the area.    Jefferson selected Captain Meriwether Lewis to lead the expedition, afterwards known as the Corps of Discovery. In a letter dated June 20, 1803, Jefferson wrote to Lewis    The object of your mission is to explore the Missouri river, and such principal stream of it as by its course and communication with the waters of the Pacific Ocean whether the Columbia, Oregon, Colorado or any other river may offer the most direct and practicable water communication across this continent for the purposes of commerce.[3]    Lewis selected William Clark as his partner. Because of bureaucratic delays in the U.S. Army, Clark officially only held the rank of Second Lieutenant at the time, but Lewis concealed this from the men and shared the leadership of the expedition, always referring to Clark as "Captain".[4]      Journey  See also: Timeline of the Lewis and Clark Expedition      Route of the expedition   Meriwether Lewis and William Clark meeting at the falls of the Ohio River; statue at the Falls of the Ohio State Park in Clarksville, Indiana (across from Louisville)"Left Pittsburgh this day at 11 o'clock with a party of 11 hands 7 of which are soldiers, a pilot and three young men on trial they having proposed to go with me throughout the voyage."[5] With those words, written on August 31, 1803, Meriwether Lewis began his first journal entry on the epic Lewis and Clark Expedition to the Pacific Ocean.

goP5E0Kxaa	Yeh well problem solved. You are learning math from the tutor, that's life you aren't going to get along with everyone.    Even if not rational people usually have their reasons for their feelings, actions though, just get through the class, don't make it worse for yourself and get her fired up...    Don't go to the principal complaining unless you want to be presented in your claims, support them, argue them standing right next to the teacher....    You are not there to start a war, waste time fighting court battles, and challenging someone who grades your papers...the smart thing to do is get tuttoring, show up for class, and then graduate..    ...move on with your life, and its a happier ending .    The school stands up for the teacher/ professor|`|etrLu8Xnaa	get on their good side maybe offer to help out around the classroom that always works. get her presents for teachers week or her birthday maybe bribing will work :]|`|C2sZREuAaa	Are you sure its not your attitude towards the teacher.

But if you and your classmates frustrate her... hey you still risk geting an "F"    Then good luck in try to expalin to your parents:     We found out that our teacher went to college to become a PE teacher and got stuck with us. She knows nothing about algebra!!    They won't believe it and if you get a "D" your future counselors will also not believe it...     eventhough I believe you...|`|MZPuDifYaa	Talk to your principal about it.|`|sX0dKXzRaa	Tell her she sucks at her job and needs to find another realease for her anger? or talk to your headmaster, which ever one works out|`|LiTMU2Dhaa	Talk to the principal and tell her what the teacher is doing.  Don't worry about the teacher not liking you.  It doesn't sound like it's you she doesn't like, it sounds like she's just a mean teacher with problems that she takes out on everybody else.|`|1Q5XZgoiaa	it's just not her forte to be teaching math. you can't keep asking her for help is she keeps saying she doesn't know it. tell your parents to bring it up with the school district to hire an accredited math instructor, or switch to a different teacher.|`|9FW0XcCuaa	That's like me and my GCSE English teacher (God I hate her)  Just ignore it and stick to your tutoring lessons. Complain to the principle and he/she may be able to get you into a different teachers class.    slagging your teacher to your friends always helps me lol.|`|a6rTFPgdaa	right, first of all it sounds to me like the teacher dont really caqre about the students future and it needs sorting out.  Teachers are there to teach, and thats what they should be doing teaching, if not then something needs to be done about it.  You need to speak with the head teacher about it, if you get no joy, then write an anomous letter to you local newspaper explaining what the problem is! as a last resort you need to try and get in touch with the High Commissoner of Schools and Colleges! again you could write a letter to them anomously or summit!    Hope you get this sorted out  Good Luck|`|INibnzgNaa	It sounds like you need to go higher up.  I would get your parents and other parents of students in the class to write a letter and/or give the principal a visit.  If you fall behind at this level it will be very difficult to catch up later.  Other then that I would try getting tutoring from older students who are good in algebra.  As for your personality conflict with the teacher your parents may want to get involved with that as well.    Good luck!|`|L2ngturyaa	She's probably not a bad PE teacher, just got stuck in a job she isn't prepared for and that makes her miserable and insecure. She is responsible for teaching and obviously isn't planning very well. Talk to the old algebra teacher and ask her to help the class by tutoring the new teacher. Give her a year or two to find her way. She didn't ask for this job. She wanted to teach PE, but got stuck.|`|VELnLnIKaa	possibly cuz she has seen your grammar lol   hired the old teacher to your home doubtful if your story is true have your parents go up to the school talk with principal|`|TanAU2aAaa	Get a tutor from a high school that had the same teacher as you and he/she can teach you what you need to know.

Doing what you're doing right now (the web design stuff) is a good start, but, even then, you're going to be working your way up. Maybe you could try and get a job that might have some beneficial connection to web designing.

n0VqtKIOaa	In college, it is recommended to declare your major in something biology related since most of your pre-requisites when applying to optometry school are biology courses.  You're required/recommended to take organic 1 and 2, gen chem and biology, physics 1 and 2, and anatomy and physiology.  Your degree will be something like Applied Biology, Biological Science, Life Sciences, etc with a concentration in pre-optometry.  Pre-med and pre-dental students are in the same situation as they typically major in the same bachelor degree but attach a concentration in pre-dental/pre-medicine with it.    You will take an optometry admission test while trying to get your bachelors degree.  It will cover gen chem and bio, physics, organic, english, and math.  The OAT is out of 400 points and you will need above a 330 to get a good chance of getting in.  You also want to keep your GPA above a 3.5|`|qYvhw8UKaa	DUDE optometrist is basically biology all you have to take is mainly chemistry and biology and maybe physics that all just do good and when you get into University major in BIO its doesn't matter what type of BIo just once you take BIO 1, 2 BIO chemistry, Genetic , all basically all those bio stuff that's is recommended by the department.  I go to a college where they let you start Optometry in the 3rd year once you have a GPA ova 3.2 and finish 3 years later but you have to pay still medical tuition because indeed you are studying at a Medical institution off campus   soo if getting out of medical school early as possible look out there and you find some
y02PZj22aa	According to Douglass' official biography, Frederick Douglass sought to embody three keys for success in life:        * Believe in yourself.      * Take advantage of every opportunity.      * Use the power of spoken and written language to effect positive change for yourself and society.     There are significant differences in their origins and upbringing.  However, both men share certain characteristics:  Personal charisma, great ability to use language to excellent effect, ability to focus on a goal and work diligently toward it, and a fine sense of right and wrong as well as justice.      You might want to read more about Douglass' background and try to imagine how he would have responded to President Obama's inaugural address as well as to the fact of his inauguration.|`|EJOJy3qVaa	He would be proud on how much progress the world has come to accepting African Americans as equals.|`|0c7ff2733514381d048fdc22049ffd46aa	He would throw his fist in the air and say, "That's right brother man." Ask your parents if you don't understand.      Seriously, Fredrick Douglas was able to converse with white men which was extremely frowned upon in his day.  In a way President Obama (show respect and use his title when you refer to him) he is going through the same thing.  What Douglas did was never done before.  What President Obama is doing has never been done before.  Both men are pioneers and are breaking new ground.  You can expand on that.  Do your research!!

5Z61kXjGaa	im not really sure to be honest. but i want to be a lawyer or a journalist so im taking    History  Geography  (german but that wont help but it will help you get into universities because they look at if you know another language )    you need history because u need to no history of the past laws and things that have happened in the past    i think you need to take geography to no the places and the type of atmosphere but no that much    and mayb citinzenship for you because that may help ( not sure how)      hope that helped|`|ToztjpAsaa	History, geography, French/Spanish, maybe art.  Avoid "soft" subjects.|`|meLGAZLcaa	It wouldn't matter at this stage. A level subject choices would be more important towards your career.    I would however choose History, it is a subject very respected at Universities.
RJkYRaccaa	according to about.com:    How fast does the earth spin?  The speed at which the earth spins varies upon your latitudinal location on the planet. If you're standing at the north pole, the speed is almost zero but at the equator, where the circumference of the earth is greatest, the speed is about 1,038 miles per hour (1,670 kph). The mid-latitudes of the U.S. and Europe speed along at 700 to 900 mph (1125 to 1450 kph).    in other words, the "speed" of the earth is variable based on what location you are referring to. It "spins" faster along the equator than mid latitude because there is a greater circumfrence at that point|`|WSif0xUzaa	google it...it doesnt hurt and if u have the time to ask this and check on yahoo then u have time to research....stop bein so lazy...|`|OsFJNHn2aa	3,963 miles per hour|`|kM2HNuziaa	Well that one is very easy, well if u lisin in class. lol k um it spins 25,000 miles a day! and 1000 miles per hour, so number 1!!!! hope that helps you!

She doesn't talk anymore but she sang until 105 years old, i love her. my wife and son always listen to her in the car and my son's room is filled with pictures of her in the wheelchair and on stage (in a wheelchair). she was-words can't express her talent..... does your friend listen to Margareta by any chance? good for her if she does!
