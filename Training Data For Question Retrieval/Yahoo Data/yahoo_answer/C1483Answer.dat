AA10283947	This lady is damaged and unless you can remove yourself from her near company you are in danger of taking the same route.<br>  You say you are 23 years old, then be your age and stand away... building your own independent life , if your mum misses you, visit but be assertive, do not allow her to bring you down, all individuals have a right to a fair life, if you fear abuse at such a visit then go with a friend, or, stay away.|`|CUMdhfKzaa	You don't sound too bright yourself.<br>  <br>  Maybe you should try to clarify things before you go on a rant about your mother.|`|ce9d90af4bd252d25ce81377df2eecc6aa	This has made me feel very sad to read your email and my thoughts and support go out to you!<br>  I think it maybe difficult for people to answer on yahoo, as its an extremely sensitive subject.<br>  My opinion of this situation is, I think that you should try and be unambiguous with your mum and tell her exactly how hurt and upset you are about how she is behaving towards you..<br>  I grew up without my dad and I have never met him.. I have such a wonderful mum and so feel blessed that I have at least the rest of my family.. Do you have your father that you can speak to, for support?<br>  I think that you should say a pray to God and ask Him for his support.. ask from your heart. You see there was a time when I felt so alone and unhappy.. I said a prayer and I met someone who helped change my life forever.. It was a friend that entered my life and supported me so much that I know in my heart, that I seeked God and He came to my need..<br>  Don't feel alone because you are not.. you have God looking after you.. even if others may not give you the love that you desire.. God will always be there!<br>  I am not preaching but I think you need God right now in your life.. so say a prayer and ask for His support! <br>  Its difficult for anyone to help, as its a family matter which needs proper support as it seems a very complex issue!<br>  I hope that your life changes.. God works in many ways and I believe that things will change for you.. Just have hope and trust in Him!<br>  God bless you|`|XVVkrlnTaa	You know what...the truth is that she will never change and never be the person you want her to be. Maybe you should just accept it and try to move on with your life. Taking your own life won't make it better or make it go away. I know this is very hard for you. Try to keep her at a distance.|`|tKTE2xxpaa	i dint get get|`|ME2Skf8jaa	drugs or u|`|d1f4428d3bd66886014cedd35e30d605aa	Either you need to write more better, or you need to put your mum out of your life, or indeed get something else to concentrate on. That way your mum will come to your way of thinking, if not, you have done all that you could of, and that is all you can do!<br>  <br>  Love yourself first, and if no one else does, you are always in the knowledge that no one can hurt you anymore.|`|BRISyG77aa	tell her straight, its me or the drugs.<br>  i mean if she was any sort of mother she'd hear you cry for attention & love & give it up no matter how hard it is.<br>  <br>  if it doesn't work do something to grab her attention.<br>  just dont do something stupid.<br>  like take drugs yourself<br>  & dont listen to anything she says when she's intoxicated beacuse 98% it'll be lies.<br>  <br>  hope all goes well x|`|a6j7Bu9daa	I dont understand. Heard of paragraphs, capital letters, punctuation and a spellchecker before?|`|0Wmb5SDuaa	Erm... I'm 14 and I have the same problem. Sometimes my mum will agree with me, but most of the time, she just scolds me for everything. I have a younger brother and an older sister. You don't know how hard life is being in the middle. My sister can do what she wants on the basis that she is old enough. My brother can whine like a spoilt brat and also get what he wants. As for me, if I tell my parents that my brother is misbehaving or anything, I get a scolding. However, I think I can live with it. I always go and listen to some music when I am down. Try that. If I (a 14-year-old) can survive, so can you (a 23-year-old).<br>  <br>  Hope this helps.<br>  <br>  Don't worry you're not the only one with this problem.

j1BTIYcCaa	There are too many religions already, no one wants another one.|`|WyICbuPqaa	What is your hit/miss ratio?  Joseph Smith had a hit miss ratio of about 95%.  That puts him squarely in the category of most Old Testament prophets.<br>  <br>  It's easy to predict that congress will give themselves a raise, or that the world will become more polluted.  Can you tell us specifics about the next major war, and where it will start?  Joseph Smith predicted the Civil War 30 years before it happened, and said it would start in South Carolina.  He also predicted that the two sides would call on other nations, which they did.  Then he predicted that the nations of the world would make treaties with each other, leading to a world war.  <br>  <br>  He has set the bar for all prophets.

oR8yQXnpaa	Being from Humboldt County(for those of you who doesn't know where I'm talking about)-Upper N/W California,THE GOVERNMENT recycles it to the market.Now don't get me wrong,not all the police are bad,but the Government{especially the D.E.A.}is the biggest mafia in the USA.They do burn a lot of it,but they aren't by no means eradicating it.They need to just legalize it and tax it, just like the very health cigarette and alcohol corporations that's legal.Also there are many things that can be made by the hemp weed.Does anybody realize that the Model T originally ran off hemp?|`|mskRMhrgaa	ROFL.

1Mc6BOvKaa	First I'll tell you whilst you're still reading to stop now, because you'll get caught and have the book thrown at you, for reasons I'll explain now. Think of the poor postmen who have to deal with it, the poor people who get dirty mail.<br>  <br>  <br>  Its a criminal offence to interfere with the passage of mail. I'm pretty sure that taking a leak into a post box comes under that. I believe that there's also a crime along the lines of "damaging Royal property" (which is what postboxes and mail in transit is - if they call it Royal, it legally gives it an elevated level of protection). The "interference" crime carries a fine and a prison sentence (depending on severity) of up to two years, and the "Royal" crime probably carries more.<br>  Not only that, but its also illegal to urinate in public anyway, and you can be given a fixed penalty notice (in some parts of the country, the police also make you clean it up).<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  You say you are an anarchist with no regard for public property (am I right in thinking that "disregard" is a typo?). If you are a true anarchist, you'd have no notion of any private property, instead going on the basis that everything you come across is public property, as in available for all of the public to use. But I digress.<br>  <br>  You say you are an anarchist, but I assume you are a human being with normal human emotions too. Whilst you are doing it, you probably don't think about these things, but please, next time, remember:<br>  <br>  - That box contains other people's love letters, birthday cards, and other personal mail (business mail isn't put into boxes). You're causing them upset with something frankly disgusting.<br>  - Its not pleasant to walk down a street and find the stench of urine coming from a doorway, alleyway, or even a postbox.<br>  - Some poor postman will have to collect from that box. Its extremely unlikely that they'll have any gloves in the collections van. This is obviously not pleasant, and its a health hazard. Then some other postmen will have to go through each item and individually wrap it in plastic bags and write a covering letter to apologise to each person with any mail addressed to them in that box. <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  I'd stop now if I were you (although I'm intelligent enough even when drunk not to have started). Once a trend is noticed, the police and Royal Mail Investigations Branch will begin to monitor postboxes, either by camera or in person, and you'll be handed your fine and court summons. I probably shouldn't have said that - it'd be more satisfying if you're caught - but I feel the need to say that for the benefit of any people who read this and think that you'll continue to get away with it.|`|f2AWSb48aa	Yes it's illegal, just like putting a hose in there would be, it's vandalism and damaging other people property.|`|7c73d357ee89c177275de5c2d1c35fd2aa	Consider how hilarious it is when it is done to you, how much you'd love to receive letters with other people's urine on them.<br>  <br>  Interfering with the Royal Mail is actually treasonous and although you are not likely to suffer beheading, the punishment you will get if you are caught will be extremely severe.|`|FW0iLLKXaa	It's alright, you can't help it, you suffer from what's called mental incapacity or otherwise known as retardation. Do your so-called friends record this for their own entertainment because people with down syndrome are often humiliated like that.|`|2BEMSGPdaa	Well they used to be close to the ground.

In Old English, the three genders were spread across all nouns but, as language changes, nowadays most inanimate objects and lower animal forms (insects, etc) are neuter and masculine and feminine genders usually (but not always) correspond to the sex of animate beings: exceptions are the common use of "it" to refer to a child, or "she" to refer to an aeroplane or boat.<br>  <br>  Even without these irregularities, it is wrong to assume - just because you are a native English speaker - that English is necessarily "simpler" than other languages in its use of genders.<br>  <br>  Some languages have no grammatrical gender at all - Basque, Turkish, Hungarian, Finnish, Quechua, to name but a few of them. Others have only 2 genders - French, Spanish, Italian, Portuguese, etc, and our use of a third grammatical gender - neuter - with the corresponding pronoun "it" often proves very confusing to speakers of those languages. Modern Dutch and Swedish - as well as Danish and the standard Norwegian of Oslo - also have 2 genders - common and neuter; many nouns are neuter but many are also of "common gender". Because of other linguistic devices that exist in those languages, however, there is far less likely to be confusion about what you are referring to than there is in English with our word "it" to refer to practically everything under the sun.|`|AA11570675	Most languages don't have a neutral gender form, therefore there is no option but to use either the masculine or the feminine form. <br>  It appears a bit silly though, as parts of the body that occur in just one sex may be referred to with the gender form of the opposite sex. So that indicates that the masculine & feminine forms are really regarded as referring to the word, not the object the word is describing. They are really variants of the neuter, rather than strictly male or female. <br>  In fact, as you hint in your question, the gender forms are really there to distinguish between 2 uses of the same word for totally different objects, be it written or verbal. In English we have more words than almost any other language, so the meanings are apparent without needing to allocate a gender to the word. Using the same word with a different meaning given a masculine or a feminine form immediately doubles the amount of things you could refer to with a limited number of words.|`|s92cftVAaa	in my mother tongue we also make differences, it was quite hard to understand that english do not. but if you ask me "why?" i would say that in my experience ( i speak four languages) we all use the language that we have, and say what this language allows us to say.  it is also a non committed way of looking at things. even in english only things that are "loved" ( or appreciated in some way) get a gender. i still remember the gaze of a woman when i called her dog "it", because in my english grammar book it said that animals are "it".|`|90tPT5nlaa	For some reason they had it in the earliest Indo European languages such as Sanskrit, and kept it ever since. Old English had it too, but thankfully it was dropped to make modern English.|`|6d7m0kWWaa	Some of them aren't really genders, we just call them genders.  A lot of it is based on getting the sounds to go together well, people naturally tend towards certain letter combinations.  Mongolian (which I am studying now) has male and female vowels, and words are constructed based on the principal of vowel harmony (no mixing genders in a word or it's suffixes).  There's nothing "male" or "female" about the letters themselves, it's just a convenient way to label two groups in grammar.|`|sqO80pm9aa	Thank you Phipjf! It is ever so kind!<br>  German has different genders for things as well and the same word might have a different gender in French or German, so it is really tricky. Apart from learning by heart, I cannot see any other solution. I admit it is difficult and much easier in English. But in languages of the same family the gender seems to be the same like in Italian, French and Spanish for example.|`|aa673f8d0b3f8397baf3af4288720b12aa	That's a good question Bob.

When the men were struggling to get it into place they were calling it "she" and "her"  and I was quite astonished. Its a strange one. I don't know if its better or worse.  I'm learning French at the moment and am finding the genders of words an absolute nightmare.

"Gender" is a misnomer applied to a FEW European languages of Indo-European descent.  It is "noun class" and is not related to natural gender except in a historic and coincidental sense in a very small number of languages.  And even "noun class" is not universal.  Swahili and the other Bantu languages have up to 12 different noun classes that are unrelated to gender in any way.  Australian languages typically have a half dozen to a dozen different noun classes including, in some of them, a noun class that marks spiritual beings.  The noun classes in Europe that are erroneously called "gender" are based on whether the stems in Proto-Indo-European ended in a consonant, a vowel, or a sonorant and have nothing to do with natural gender.|`|ME2Skf8jaa	dunno

It's really alarming. Kids should enjoy being kids before they have to deal with the responsibility of adulthood such as parenting, taxes, debt, etc. <br>  <br>  I think it's because sex is so predominant out there in the world and body imagery is being used to cudgel the minds of youth into a malleable pulp.  If more people are getting pregnant, more people need products and services, therefore, more people to pay taxes, more people to train to go to war, more people to "strengthen a nation".  <br>  <br>  Kids are parenting kids.  I agree that sex education needs to be stressed more.  I also think that schools perhaps need to have people shadow a typical single mother's day of one who is still in high school.  Then they see the challenges she has to endure.  I'm not trying to shed a negative view on single motherhood, I'm really not - hey, if a kid in high school WANTS to be a mom, then more power to her!<br>  <br>  I think this has a large bearing on why people are so rude in society.  Kids aren't being raised properly and therefore are perpetuating the same madness. <br>  <br>  Someone said above that the parents need to be more strict.  I don't think that necessarily will work because with the laws nowadays, a teenager can pretty much get away with murder and the parents can do very little to prevent it.|`|5ede303e3f09ef934bb1a71e8b13e26aaa	Yeah, it is a bit worrying.

Many aren't even responsible enough by the time they reach 21.<br>  <br>  This wasn't always the case.  At one time, teenagers frequently married and started families.  One of my grandmothers was married at 12 years old and the other married at the "late" age of 16.  Both were responsible enough to keep a home and raise a family.  They knew the responsibilities of marriage and they knew they didn't have the government dole to fall back on if they shirked their responsibilities.  Both married before the welfare state started with the New Deal.<br>  <br>  I am not saying that I want to go back to 12 year olds getting married.  I am only saying that at one time they were responsible enough to do so.  Since these were not arranged marriages, I am guessing that these girls fell in love.  I would never, ever expect our young people to be capable of anything more responsible than dusting off their xboxes at such an age.  Some of them are capable of cleaning their bedrooms by the age of 15, though.|`|RFGGBtp5aa	council estates and poor parenting mean that this will only get worse.<br>  <br>  you can't stop kids doing it really, as it is now becoming the norm for people to have lost there virginity at 14 (in the uk anyway)<br>  <br>  the only thing that works if you ask me is scare tactics, like showing them how AIDS has spread in Africa or what std's do to your body.|`|3urQfMffaa	I had an idea of what sex was when I was 11 and I'm now 20 and still a virgin. I think if parents dishes out severe consequences of having sex that young, that would deter their kids. Sex education classes can help, but parents play the biggest role. About half the teenagers who took virginity pledges denied ever taking it a few years later. Almost all broke it. I mean, come on. Parents should start deterring such behavior while the child is in grade school.|`|AA11937656	The ambiance of the culture tells them - "this is expected of you"|`|FaNmIRmPaa	I'm 18, and this still worries me too, it's an extremely recent thing. When I was at school, nobody was really have sex until year ten- so about fifteen- but there were quite a lot of raunchy rumours etc during the last two years from fifteen to sixteen. I mean, at the time you don't really think it's that young, you're going your GCSEs and you feel old at school, and there's the ever present peer pressure- however it isn't until you grow up a little and understand the adult world that you realise JUST how young 15/16 is.<br>  <br>  The thought of kids having sex so young is scary, and unnecessary. But then again it is being force fed to them- through advertising etc. I mean even on Harry Potter film promotional posters, on each poster there is a subliminal sexual message- a video explaining this can be found here<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xMjxrKIWTIg" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xMjxrKIWT...</a><br>  <br>  I don't understand what really drives under 15s to having sex, what reasons they justify it with rather than thinking its cool and adult behaviour? <br>  <br>  I saw a group of 13 year old girls yesterday all wearing mini skirts, straightened hair, way too much makeup and with those oversized bags that icons such as Nicole Richie and Paris Hilton wear. I just thought, 'why on earth are girls who probably have only just started their period doing trying to act like 20 year olds?'|`|iqZUd5Fdaa	Its not so much a modern thing, i think interestingly, the opposite is true, children are more childish now, they're allowed to be children, in the past they had to grow up very quickly to get jobs, look after their families, and there's always been some children more than others that are curious from a very young age, and girls used to be married off by the age of 12-14, infact some cultures still do that today. Its just been sensationalised by the media, an example of that is the young fella who became a dad at 13 but looks like an 8 year old, would that really have gotten as much attention if he looked 13, i dont think it would, people would just shrug it off as another chav family, but because he looks really young for his age and they emphasised that, it makes it shocking, which sells them more newspapers<br>  <br>  50 years ago, stuff like this still happened, it was just that people would never imagine wanting to wave it around in the media, it was very much dusted under the carpet. Pregnant girls would be sent away to an aunt in the country so nobody would see her pregnant, and the baby would be brought up as her brother/sister

I am filled with curiosity, however, in respect of what may happen in the Kali age. When morality and virtue will be at an end, what will remain there! What will be prowess of men in that age, what their food, and what their amusements? What will be the period of life at the end of the Yuga? What also is the limit, having attained which the Krita age will begin anew? Tell me all in detail, O Muni, for all that thou narratest is varied and delightful.<br>  <br>  Thus addressed, that foremost of Munis began his discourse again, delighting that tiger of the Vrishni race and the sons of Pandu as well.<br>  <br>  Morality then is said to wait on men, with<br>  only a fourth part of itself remaining<br>  And Markandeya said: Listen, O monarch, to all that has been seen and heard by me, and to all, O king of kings, that hath been known to me by intuition from the grace of the God of gods! O bull of the Bharata race, listen to me as I narrate the future history of the world during the sinful age. O bull of the Bharata race, in the Krita age, everything was free from deceit and guile and avarice and covetousness; and morality like a bull was among men, with all the four legs complete. In the Treta age sin took away one of these legs and morality had three legs. In the Dwapara, sin and morality are mixed half and half, and accordingly morality is said to have two legs only. In the dark age (of Kali), O thou best of the Bharata race, morality mixed with three parts of sin liveth by the side of men. Accordingly morality then is said to wait on men, with only a fourth part of itself remaining. Know, O Yudhishthira that the period of life, the energy, intellect and the physical strength of men decrease in every Yuga!<br>  <br>  Wedded to avarice and wrath and ignorance and lust, men will entertain animosities towards one another, desiring to take one another’s lives.<br>  <br>  O Pandava, the Brahmanas (Brahmins) and Kshatriyas and Vaisyas and Sudras, (in the Kali age) will practise morality and virtue deceitfully and men in general will deceive their fellows by spreading the net of virtue. And men with false reputation of learning will, by their acts, cause Truth to be contracted and concealed. And in consequence of the shortness of their lives, they will not be able to acquire much knowledge. And in consequence of the littleness of their knowledge, they will have no wisdom. And for this, covetousness and avarice will overwhelm them all. And wedded to avarice and wrath and ignorance and lust, men will entertain animosities towards one another, desiring to take one another’s lives.<br>  <br>  And Brahmanas and Kshatriyas and Vaisyas with their virtue contracted and divested of asceticism and truth will all be reduced to an equality with the Sudras. And the lowest orders of men will rise to the position of the intermediate ones, and those in intermediate stations will without doubt, descend to the level of the lowest ones. Even such, O Yudhishthira, will become the state of the world at the end of the Yuga.<br>  <br>  Of robes those will be regarded the best that are made of flax and of grain the Papalum frumentacea will be regarded the best.<br>  <br>  [Note: The word in the text is Kora-dushakas, supposed by Wilson to be the Paspalum frumentacea (vide. Dict.)]<br>  <br>  Men will live on fish and milk, goats<br>  and sheep, for cows will be extinct<br>  Towards this period men will regard their wives as their (only) friends. And men will live on fish and milk, goats and sheep, for cows will be extinct. And towards that period, even they that are always observant of vows will become covetous. And opposed to one another, men will, at such a time, seek one another’s lives; and divested of Yuga, people will become atheists and thieves. And they will even dig the banks of streams with their spades and sow grains thereon. And those men, who are devoted to ceremonial rites in honour of the deceased and of the gods, will be avaricious and will also appropriate and enjoy what belongs to others. The father will enjoy what belongs to the son; and the son, what belongs to the father. And those things will also be enjoyed by men in such times, and enjoyment of which hath been forbidden in the scriptures.<br>  <br>  And the Brahmanas, speaking disrespectfully of the Vedas, will not practise vows, and their understanding clouded by the science of disputation, they will no longer perform sacrifices and the Homa. And deceived by the false science of reasons, they will direct their hearts towards everything mean and low. And men will till low lands for cultivation and employ cows and calves that are one year old, in drawing the plough and carrying burthens. And sons having slain their sire, and sires having slain their sons will incur no opprobrium. And they will frequently save themselves from anxiety by such deeds, and even glory in them.<br>  <br>  And the whole world will be filled with Mleccha behaviour and notions and ceremonies and sacrifices will cease and joy will be nowhere and general rejoicing will disappear. And men will rob the possession of helpless persons of those that are friendless and of wisdom also. And, possessed of small energy and strength, without knowledge and given to avarice and folly and sinful practices men will accept with joy the gifts made by wicked people with words of contempt. And, O son of Kunti, the kings of the earth, with hearts wedded to sin without knowledge and always boastful of their wisdom, will challenge one another from desire of taking one another’s life.<br>  <br>  And the Kshatriyas also towards the end of such a period will become the thorns of the earth. And filled with avarice and swelling with pride and vanity and unable and unwilling to protect (their subjects), they will take pleasure in inflicting punishments only. And attacking and repeating their attacks upon the good and the honest, and feeling no pity for the latter, even when they will cry in grief, the Kshatriyas will, O Bharata, rob these of their wives and wealth.<br>  <br>  And women, living uncontrolled,<br>  will slay their husbands and sons.<br>  And the women will always be sharp in speech and pitiless and fond of weeping. And they will never abide by the commands of their husbands. And when the end of the Yuga comes, sons will slay fathers and mothers. And women, living uncontrolled, will slay their husbands and sons. And, O king, when the end of the Yuga comes, Rahu will swallow the Sun unseasonably. And fires will blaze up on all sides. And travellers unable to obtain food and drink and shelter even when they ask for these, will lie down on the wayside refraining from urging their solicitations.

wywdxhBAaa	Evolution is "conjecture", which is to say it is a "great big guess".  It uses "circular reasoning" from different disciplines to artificially cross-support itself and its imagined tenets, which are severe misinterpretation of the data reaching erroneous conclusions of events that never transpired.  The so-called "evidence" they point to in the Fossil Record was laid down SUDDENLY by the Noachian Flood, because fossilization occurs via the process of entombment in mud and hydraulic processes.  This means the Fossil Record and the Geological Column have been entirely misinterpreted by the Evolutionary Model; hence, it is total misconjecture.  I call it "SCIENCE FICTION" because not a shred of it is true.  LOL!!!<br>  <br>  So to answer your question, these people who believe in bogus evolution are easily swayed by the spoon-fed dogma that science fabricates and do not have enough sense to think on their own and to question the propaganda of the Leftist Scientists who have an anti-Christian and anti-God agenda.|`|rFFYCmOGaa	Sounds like the only thing you know about evolution is how to spell it friendo...<br>  <br>  Evolution is the single most unifying principle in biology--the best idea in the field in last 200 years.|`|XN0cYCATaa	Consider this<br>  <br>  The Origin of Man by Dr. Duane Fingerprints of Creation<br>  <a href="http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=5725394906886443944" rel="nofollow">http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=...</a><br>  Gish<br>  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3FZDysZKFQ" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3FZDysZK...</a><br>  <br>  The Origins of Life<br>  <a href="http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=3181822797567477581" rel="nofollow">http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=...</a><br>  <br>  Creation In The 21st Century From Where did these Layers Come (From) 1 of 3 (Global Flood)<br>  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZyoXQJ5Al0" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZyoXQJ5A...</a><br>  <br>  Creation in the 21st Century - Overwhelming Evidence 1 of 3<br>  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o226umqLdsU" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o226umqLd...</a><br>  <br>  Skull Fossils - As Empty as the Evolutionary Theory<br>  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Yu5jN897kM" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Yu5jN897...</a><br>  <br>  Neanderthals - Smarter Then We Thought<br>  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xxL636n3w2o" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xxL636n3w...</a><br>  <br>  Dinosaurs: Those Terrible Lizards<br>  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVvGByvp13Q" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVvGByvp1...</a><br>  <br>  Our Solar System: Evidence For Creation<br>  <a href="http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=-2535369046252590943&ei=_aqlSOe3MYOm4QLPkeki&q=creation+evidence&hl=en" rel="nofollow">http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=...</a><br>  <br>  Birds and Flight: Evolved or Designed? <br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I4_HxphCtjA" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I4_HxphCt...</a>|`|23033d499769542e5e7910234a60e4f7aa	No evidence = No belief<br>  <br>  Evidence = belief<br>  <br>  There is abundant evidence of evolution..

God can not be proved with any thing but belief. <br>  <br>  A lot of people are not religion due to the way religion is taught.  When you have people who state that they are religion and do things that are against the teaching of the religion, it turns people off.  I.e., Jesus taught tolerance of others, but the Catholic church teaches their way or the highway.  If you get a divorce, then you are no longer in the church.  But even Jesus forgave sinners.  Mary Magdalene for example.  <br>  <br>  But is it possible that God used evolution as a tool to create different things in the seven days that he created.  And what is a day to God?  24 hours is a day on earth, but on Mercury one day = 58 days on Earth.

Isn't it possible it is both?<br>  Ever heard the saying "God moves in mysterious ways - His wonders to perceive"?   Well this planet we live on is millions of years old and most things that have ever existed have become extinct and given way to different life forms over so much time it aint funny and climates and land masses have always been in a State of change and there have been catastrophic events (like an asteroid hitting around the Gulf of Mexico 65 million years ago wasn't it?) and wiping out lots of the dinosaurs but not all life on earth and gradually other animals getting a new foothold in their changed environment.   We ourselves have evolved too into what we are today and you do not have to rule out a God setting things going in an evolutionary way.  Viruses evolve so why can't we??  It is all about Natural Selection and Charles Darwin was "on the money".  There are evolutionists out there who also believe in God.<br>  Well the Earth and it's lifeforms got going somehow either by "Nature" or by a Superior Being and whatever way you look at it either way is amazing.   The story of Adam and Eve does not have to be taken literally - there are many examples in the Bible where Imagery is used - like symbolism etc.  So to make a long story short:  Evolutionary ideas do not dismiss the possibility that "Something/Some Entity?" got it all going and sat back and watched it all unfold just like one does when watching stuff re evolution/how birds are the descendants of dinosaurs on National Geographic.

Rather, the true existence of existence is through life. Life is the light of existence, and consciousness is the light of life. Life is the summit and foundation of everything. Life appropriates everything for living beings; it is as though it makes one thing the owner of everything. Through life, a living thing may say: “All these things belong to me. The world is my house. The universe is my property, given to me by my owner.”<br>  Just as light is the cause of things being seen, and, according to some, of the existence of colours, so is life the revealer of beings; it is the cause of their qualities being realized. Furthermore, it makes an insignificant particular general and universal, and is the cause of universal things being concentrated in a particular. It is also the cause of all the perfections of existence, by, for example, making innumerable things co-operate and unite, and making them the means of unity and being endowed with spirit. Life is even a sort of manifestation of Divine unity in the levels of multiplicity, and a mirror reflecting Divine oneness.<br>  Consider the following: a lifeless object, even if it is a great mountain, is an orphan, a stranger, alone. Its only relations are with the place in which it is situated, and with the things which encounter it. Whatever else there is in the cosmos, it does not exist for the mountain. For the mountain has neither life through which it might be related to life, nor consciousness by which it might be concerned.<br>  Now consider a tiny object like a bee, for example. The instant life enters it, it establishes such a connection with the universe that it is as though it concludes a trading agreement with it, especially with the flowers and plants of the earth. It can say: “The earth is my garden; it is my trading house.” Thus, through the unconscious instinctive senses which impel and stimulate it in addition to the well-known five external senses and inner senses of animate beings, the bee has a feeling for, and a familiarity and reciprocal relationship with, most of the species in the world, and they are at its disposal.|`|Vmt7ylcuaa	Life is a period since somebody in her or his mother's pregnancy until born, carry on living and ended when his or her soul taken apart from his or her body.<br>  That is for me, for you may be  multicycles of above, depend on the good deeds you do during your life and you will be in a better  or worse body (human, animal, etc) each cycle of life ( for those who believe in reincarnation)|`|n1eXQr5oaa	Life is the state of living|`|NqfUPKiSaa	Life is death of a seed, where a sapling comes out|`|OWpeAy2Taa	‘What is the meaning and purpose of life?’  This is, perhaps, the most important question that has ever been asked.  Throughout the ages, philosophers have considered it to be the most fundamental question.  Scientists, historians, philosophers, writers, psychologists and the common man all wrestle with the question at some point in their lives.<br>  Is Reason a Sufficient Guide?<br>  <br>  ‘Why do we eat?’  ‘Why do we sleep?’  ‘Why do we work?’  The answers we would get to these questions would be similar.  ‘I eat to live.’  ‘I sleep to rest.’  ‘I work to support myself and my family.’  But when it comes to what the purpose of life is, people are confused.  We see their confusion by the type of answers we receive.  Youths may say, “I live for booze and bikinis.”  The middle aged professional might say, “I live to save enough for a comfortable retirement.”  The old man would probably say, “I’ve been asking why I’m here most of my life.  If there’s a purpose, I don’t care anymore.”  And perhaps the most common answer will be, “I really don’t know!”<br>  <br>  How, then, do you discover the purpose of life?  We basically have two options.  The first is to let ‘human reason’ - the celebrated achievement of the Enlightenment - guide us.  After all, the Enlightenment gave us modern science based on careful observation of the natural world.  But have post-Enlightenment philosophers figured it out?  Camus described life as “absurd”; Sartre spoke of “anguish, abandonment and despair.”  To these Existentialists, life has no meaning.  Darwinians thought the meaning of life was to reproduce.  Will Durant, capturing the predicament of postmodern man, wrote, “Faith and hope disappear; doubt and despair are the order of the day… it is not our homes and our treasuries that are empty, it is our ‘hearts’.”  When it comes to meaning of life, even the wisest philosophers are just guessing.  Will Durant, the most noted philosopher of the last century, and Dr. Hugh Moorhead, a philosophy professor at Northeastern Illinois University, both wrote separate books titled ‘The Meaning of Life.’[1]  They wrote to the best-known philosophers, scientists, writers, politicians, and intellectuals of their time in the world, asking them, “What is the meaning of life?”  Then they published their responses.  Some offered their best guesses, some admitted that they just made up a purpose for life, and others were honest enough to say they were clueless.  In fact, a number of famous intellectuals asked the authors to write back and tell them if the purpose of life was discovered!<br>  Let the Heavens “Speak”<br>  <br>  If the philosopher has no definitive answer, perhaps the answer can be found within the heart and mind that we ourselves possess.  Have you ever looked at the open sky on a clear night?  You will see an incalculable number of stars.  Look through a telescope and you will see gigantic spiral galaxies, beautiful nebula where new stars are being formed, the remnants of ancient supernova explosion created in a star’s final death throes, the magnificent rings of Saturn and the moons of Jupiter.  Is it possible not to be moved by the sight of these countless stars in the night sky shining like diamond dust on a bed of black velvet?  Multitudes of stars beyond stars, stretching back; becoming so dense that they appear to merge into delicate wisps of sparkling mist.  The grandeur humbles us, thrills us, inspires a craving for investigation, and calls for our contemplation.  How did it come into being?  How are we related to it, and what is our place in it?  Can we hear the heavens “speak” to us?<br>  <br>  “In the creation of the heavens and the earth and the alternation of the night and the day, there are surely signs for all who are endowed with insight, who remember God when they stand, and when they sit, and when they lie down to sleep, and reflect on the creation of the heavens and the earth: “O our Lord, You have not created this without meaning and purpose.  Limitless art You in Your glory…” (Quran 3:190-191)<br>  <br>  When we read a book, we accept that an author exists.  When we see a house, we accept that a builder exists.  Both of these things were made with a purpose by those who made them.  The design, order, and complexity of the universe as well as the world around us are evidence of the existence of a supreme intelligence, a perfect designer.  All the heavenly bodies are controlled by precise laws of physics.  Can there be laws without a lawmaker?  Rocket scientist Dr. von Braun said: “The natural laws of the universe are so precise that we have no difficulty building a spaceship to fly to the moon and can time the flight with the precision of a fraction of a second.  These laws must have been set by somebody.”  Paul Davies, a professor of physics, concludes that man’s existence is not a mere quirk of fate.  He states: “We are truly meant to be here.”  And he says regarding the universe: “Through my scientific work, I have come to believe more and more strongly that|`|MTi7r9l6aa	life<br>  noun<br>  1. the condition that distinguishes organisms from inorganic objects and dead organisms, being manifested by growth through metabolism, reproduction, and the power of adaptation to environment through changes originating internally.|`|prpuiJCgaa	My opinion is that "LIFE" is that part of God that He shares with us.

Homosexuality has also been shown to be linked to genetics, as is eye color.<br>  <br>  Discover Magazine has shown that "Two of the most convincing studies have proved conclusively that sexual orientation in men has a genetic cause."<br>  <br>  New Scientist has shown that "geneticists may have explained how genes apparently linked to male homosexuality survive" and "Mothers' genetic skew linked to gay sons."<br>  <br>  LiveScience has shown that "The arrangement of a mother's genes could affect the sexual orientation of her son, according to a new study."<br>  <br>  Scientific American has shown that "Having Older Brothers Increases a Man's Odds of Being Gay."<br>  <br>  WebMD has shown that magnetic resonance imaging studies reveal key differences in the brains of gay and straight men and women that could add to the understanding of the biology of homosexuality.|`|H39nT287aa	There is no evidence to show that homosexuality can be caused by changes in hormones. There are plenty of guys who have excess oestrogen (the hormone your cousin had surplus of), who are completely straight. Homosexuality is not a disease, and no there is no way to reverse it. If you are gay you are gay.|`|WmQlkCL9aa	Yes, it actually is hormonal imbalance. They've done several tests and found that gays and girls react in their brains differently to pictures of guys than straight guys.<br>  <br>  But then again, this hormonal imbalance does not mean that the individual is more/less a sexual being, their orientation strays from the "norm"<br>  <br>  And nope, you can't cure gays!

I had a bad dad, bro, uncles, friends and other examples. I don't feel like sex is the issue... I love who I love. I have yet to see a good man out there that, in my opinion, really deserves a good woman. But that's just me!

Don't let people tell you that.<br>  <br>  Even if it was, I wouldn't care, and I doubt homosexuals would care. They just have to be free and happy with their sexuality. It's a social problem, not a scientific matter.
s6GKHKccaa	It's the way time zone borders are set up. Time zone borders run North to South, so in order to cross a time zone, one has to travel East or West. That's why you find yourself to be in the same time zone as certain parts of Canada. All time zones are the same throughout the world. They all run North and South from the North Pole to the South pole.<br>  <br>  Also, depending where you're at in the midwest, you could be closer to Canada than New York. Michigan is a good example of a State in the Midwest that actually borders Canada.|`|XKhNw221aa	the world is very big and it spins at over 200mph.

So it's closer to Michigan, Wisconsin, Montana, ext.|`|KfM8ApsKaa	Canada is as wide from coast to coast as the United States. I have no idea how their time zones work, but since ours in the US run East and West just like the Earth spins, how far north or south isn't relevant to the time. So, if someone in Canada is directly north of where you are, the time is the same there.|`|napgiSmXaa	Hello Im Mixed 19 & a Proud Virgin<br>        Don't quote me I'm no expert but as I understand it.  The World is divided up into various time zones, to compensate for the fact that the Sun, rises at different times in different parts of the world.  Therefore, as Canada and certain parts of the Mid West, are in the same time zone they share the same time settings.<br>        I hope that helps.  It's all a bit of a mystery to me as the song says.<br>        God Bless.

Abraham was a pagan (from Ur) that heard the word of God and founded the monotheistic religion as described above. Each step brought those people to a new understanding of God as defined by God Himself. (Read Torah) And then Jesus comes on the scene to bring the Jews to a whole new place of understanding what God has called us too. It started out as a Jewish cult, the Jews rejeced it fully and it became "followers of the Way". The Way of Jesus Christ. After a couple hundred years it's doctrines were fomalized into "Christianity" which was founded as "Catholicism". <br>  Again, after 1300 years, the doctrines were found to be so corrupted and flawed that the Reformation took off into the Lutheran Protestant religion. And then it exploded into what you asked above. <br>  Faith is what God wanted and man-made religion is what we've got. Sorry, that's the only way we can set a definition of HOW to do faith. I was raised Methodist and found it the most hypocritcal thing ever. Maybe not the religion, but the people! If one follows the tenants of that religion, FAITHFULLY, one would be around for a month or two and then fall away. I switched to Catholic for 16 years and liked the ceremony - couldn't stand the hypocrites standing next to me. I bounced through baptist, pentocostal, lutheran and settled back into an evangelical church that seems to fit. <br>  One has to realize that ALL are sinners and no one is righteous! Religion sets the foundation for the basis of righteous living for that is what it is called to do. Not one person can follow ANY religion to the letter.

As the prosecution will demonstrate these morally bankrupt, spiteful, malicious, eternally damming, only 2 souls on earth defied the Lord God Almighty by refusing to follow the only law set before them!  They were in the garden of eden - paradise and all they were asked to do was follow just  one and only just this one law- Thou shall not eat the fruit from the forbidden tree of knowledge!  Yet Adam and Eve could not find ample good apples from thousands of trees!  The court will demonstrate their will full act of disobedience by their miserable defense in front of this judge and jury - Oh yes, the devil made me do it!

"<br>  How does that sound like  they wouldn't have known until after they ate from the tree? No, they knew exactly what they shouldn't do, but they ignored what they knew and went against what they were told, its not as if they were hungry and were not allowed to eat anything God told them they were allowed to eat to satisfaction, they were just to leave one tree that God wanted them to leave without eating from it. So no it isn't at all logical to believe that they only knew after they ate from the tree. And they did have the best the justest and the most honest judge they possibly could have had.|`|ygGr1nX7aa	Not to mention that without the knowledge of good, they were just as virtueless as they were sinless before eating... like animals, really.<br>  <br>  It does seem odd that a benevolent God would give humanity the gift of curiousity, then say: "Okay, the one thing you must never ever ever do is eat this fruit which I'm going to put just here where you can see it, well within your reach.  Bad things will happen if you partake of its knowledge.  Seriously, don't do it.  Are we cool?  Okay, you kids have fun."<br>  <br>  If only in works of fiction, it's fun to play with the idea that maybe He intended this all along, to make sure his children had the true gift of free will- including the freedom to suffer consequences and learn.<br>  <br>  (I look at this from the position of someone interested in the story and its tradition, rather than a believer of course; I mean no disrespect, but don't see the harm in asking questions.

Think about it.  God made Adam because he was bored.  God already had Satan and all the other Angels to entertain him, but he wanted to create something really messed up to make him feel even more superior so he made Adam.  Adam, the poor simple minded creature that he was, was perfectly happy running about the bush and milking his own lizard.  When God got tired of laughing at him he said, “You know I need to make this fool a companion,” so he created Eve.  <br>  <br>  Notice that God took one of Adam’s ribs instead of part of an organ or some other appendage.  You may think it is because the Historians of that time had limited knowledge of the human anatomy and a “rib” was the only thing they could come up with, but that isn’t true.  See, God actually thought about making Eve with half of Adams brain.  Adam would never have noticed half his brain was missing, but God felt sorry for him and knew that if Eve was made out of nothing but brain cells, Adam would still wind up milking his own lizard.<br>  <br>  So the true serpent in the Garden of Eden is the desire for companionship: Loneliness.  Can’t have paradise without companionship and get thrown out of paradise with companionship.  Sucks doesn’t it.|`|EczLqAIKaa	Except it was the tree of knowledge of good and evil, not all knowledge.

It will be a veritable paradise. Perfect mankind will no longer need a high priest to intercede for it before God, since all traces of Adamic sin will have been removed and the last enemy, death, brought to nothing. Christ’s Kingdom will have achieved God’s purpose to create one world with one government. At this point, Jesus “hands over the kingdom to his God and Father.”—1?Corinthians 15:22-26; Romans 15:12.<br>  <br>  Under the rule of Jesus Christ and his heavenly corulers, peace and happiness will prevail in all the earth. (Psalm 37:9-11) Those in God's memory will be resurrected and will enjoy perfect health. (Acts 24:15) By their faithfulness to God, obedient mankind will be granted what our original parents lost—everlasting life in human perfection on a paradise earth.—Revelation 21:3, 4.<br>  <br>  In the Bible book of Isaiah, we get a preview of what life will be like in the Paradise earth. No inhabitant of Paradise will say, "I am sick." (Isaiah 33:24) Animals will pose no danger to man. (Isaiah 11:6-9) People will build beautiful homes and inhabit them and will plant crops and eat to satisfaction. (Isaiah 65:21-25) Moreover, God "will actually swallow up death forever, and the Sovereign Lord Jehovah will certainly wipe the tears from all faces."—Isaiah 25:8.<br>  <br>  It is now time for a final test. Will that perfected world of mankind, in contrast with the first humans in Eden, stand firm in its integrity? John tells us what happens: “Now as soon as the thousand years have been ended, Satan will be let loose out of his prison, and he will go out to mislead those nations in the four corners of the earth, Gog and Magog, to gather them together for the war. The number of these is as the sand of the sea. And they advanced over the breadth of the earth and encircled the camp of the holy ones and the beloved city.”—Revelation 20:7-9a.<br>  <br>  How will Satan’s last effort fare? He deceives “those nations in the four corners of the earth, Gog and Magog,” and leads them to “the war.” Who could possibly side with Satan after a thousand years of joyful, upbuilding theocratic rule? Well, do not forget that Satan was able to mislead the perfect Adam and Eve while they were enjoying life in the Paradise of Eden. And he was able to lead astray heavenly angels who had seen the bad results of the original rebellion. (2?Peter 2:4; Jude?6) So we should not be surprised that some perfect humans will be enticed to follow Satan even after a delightful thousand years of rule by God’s Kingdom.<br>  <br>  The Bible calls these rebels “nations in the four corners of the earth.” This does not mean that mankind will have been divided once again into mutually exclusive national entities. It merely indicates that these will separate themselves from Jehovah’s righteous, loyal ones and manifest the same bad spirit that the nations show today. They will “think up an injurious scheme,” as did the Gog of Magog in Ezekiel’s prophecy, with a goal of destroying theocratic government on earth. (Ezekiel 38:3, 10-12) Hence, they are called “Gog and Magog.”|`|bTA5ndeMaa	First resurrection happens just before Babylon the Great is destroyed, and the last living saints get changed in an instant once the Great Tribulation has finished (1st definition of Matthew 24:29-32)<br>  <br>  The harvest is also the judgment of all the living at that time, it is Armageddon. (Luke 13:39)  This judgment continues unbroken into the judgment of the dead.  These receive the second type resurrection into Paradise on earth.<br>  <br>  That this is so, please verify by reading this scripture carefully:<br>  Revelation 11:18, DRC,  And the nations were angry, and thy wrath is come, and the time of the dead, that they should be judged, and that thou shouldest render reward to thy servants the prophets and the saints, and to them that fear thy name, little and great, and shouldest destroy them who have corrupted the earth. <br>  --<br>  Here we see the "nations were angry."  This obviously refers to Armageddon.  Right thereafter comes the judgment of the dead.  So we see that as soon as Armageddon is finished and the Kingdom reign of Christ has become global, the judgment of the dead begins.  These then receive their reward, be it eternal death, be it the resurrection of life, or the resurrection of judgment.<br>  <br>  We should not forget that the ones that survived Armageddon is a great crowd of righteous ones.  These together with the resurrected ones and of course the ones born during the millennium are the ones Satan shall go and try to deceive.<br>  <br>  We know from several scriptures and from Jesus himself, that he stated that in heaven he would neither eat nor drink; instead, when he returned to earth in kingdom power he would use this new occasion to drink again.  (that doesn't mean he would be living on earth)<br>  <br>  Luke 22:18, DRC, For I say to you, that I will not drink of the fruit of the vine, till the kingdom of God come. <br>  <br>  That they are in the flesh we can see from the fact of this scripture:<br>  <br>  Luke 22:30, That you may eat and drink at my table, in my kingdom: and may sit upon thrones, judging the twelve tribes of Israel.<br>  <br>  Matt 8:11 And I say to you that many shall come from the east and the west, and shall sit down with Abraham, and Isaac, and Jacob in the kingdom of heaven.<br>  <br>  --------<br>  If anyone has questions as to what 8:11 refers to (where) ask.|`|c2fc70c8196fb6665f4605b33bcc57a4aa	If the earth was desolate, what purpose would a wait of a thousand years DO?<br>  No, the thousand years is to let the people who wish to obey ALMIGHTY GOD, via Jesus, grow to perfection...They have already been granted the promise at Revelation 21;4...no more death and no more sickness...And they are working to being the earth back to the PARADISE, that God wants the earth to be.<br>  And all this without the bad influence of satan and his demons...they are locked up. <br>  (Revelation 20:3) And he hurled him into the abyss and shut [it] and sealed [it] over him, that he might not mislead the nations anymore until the thousand years were ended.

Furthermore, Jesus will descent and kill the Antichrist, break the cross, and kill the forces of Magog And Gog by praying to Allah for his aid.<br>  <br>  The goal of life is to worship Allah, because he has such astonishing mercy to let Adam and Eve live, even though they ate of the tree.

The thousand years of living without death, has been, gone and almost past.  The eighth day is arriving, and God is gathering his angels for his Sons return, which is closer than most will ever believe.<br>  <br>  Jesus himself said, that he was about to bind Satan, and his crucifixion and resurrection did just that.   That is why his resurrection is more powerful than his crucifixion, yet, the world clings to Jesus as a God and worships him over the Father.<br>  <br>  The sabbath that we are to keep sacred has been upon us since that time.   Gods true church of the firstborn was established as Christ is the cornerstone.<br>  <br>  Upon his death and resurrection, the old world passed and a new heaven and earth emerged, which did away with all rituals, and ways of man.<br>  <br>       All worldly churches are of naught and yet, as man expands his knowledge in the world, Gods church continues in growth and truth, as his invisible church spreads throughout the world as unseen by worldly eyes, for they believe in the visible and understand nothing of the invisible.<br>  <br>  Gods chosen and those, who've lived a thousand years without death, are amongst us, yet the world knows them not, while at the same time, the world condems those who belong not or follow false prophets.<br>  <br>  When all are gathered, before the second coming, they shall be descendants from all 12 tribes, yet, the world will not see or believe, such truth, for such truth is not taught by men, but by God, through his Son, Jesus Christ, the firstborn of his church.   There are many sons, of God today, but the world knows them not, for they war or argue with no one.<br>  <br>  They are the coveted people, which God calls his people, and they call him their God. They shall be given the name of new Jerusalem, as revealed in Rev. 3-12, yet the world knows not this for they follow Satan, as the Pharisees and Scribes did in Jesus's time.

5qjxyb0jaa	Check out Luke 6:43-45<br>  43 “For there is not a fine tree producing rotten fruit; again there is not a rotten tree producing fine fruit. 44 For each tree is known by its own fruit. For example, people do not gather figs from thorns, nor do they cut grapes off a thornbush. 45 A good man brings forth good out of the good treasure of his heart, but a wicked man brings forth what is wicked out of his wicked [treasure]; for out of the heart’s abundance his mouth speaks. <br>  <br>  I do believe these scriptures can be applied to both those from the outside trying to lire you aw2ay from the narrow path & those inside the congregation who also may have their own agenda.|`|YhYFUMO5aa	The scripture deals with the fruit in our lives. We are the trees that produce good fruit or bad fruit. The commentary is saying that bad fruit comes from the fleshly desires in us, which are contrary to God. The context is that of false prophets, the fruit being teachings and doctrines. Good doctrine comes from the Spirit of God and is to be cultivated, Bad doctrine comes from man, and must be removed.|`|5MVQrmMfaa	Contrast that with:  <br>  <br>  "You can't judge a book by it's cover..."  Bo Diddley 1:45|`|bTA5ndeMaa	It would seem that the singular tree is a singular individual.  Verse 20 indicates that there is going to be a group of such similarly good fruit bearing trees.<br>  <br>  This is clearly again related to the field of wheat and weeds.<br>  <br>  The commentary is quite identical in sentiment to the ear tickling scripture in 2 Tim 4:<br>   3 For there shall be a time, when they will not endure sound doctrine; but, according to their own desires, they will heap to themselves teachers, having itching ears: 4 And will indeed turn away their hearing from the truth, but will be turned unto fables. 5 But be thou vigilant, labour in all things, do the work of an evangelist, fulfil thy ministry. Be sober.|`|a12162a4de146505074aad130a63826daa	Yes the commentary is correct. <br>  I would also advise you to read Galatians Chapter 5: 19-25 <br>  [When you follow the desires of your sinful nature, the results are very clear: sexual immorality, impurity, lustful pleasures,  20  idolatry, sorcery, hostility, quarreling, jealousy, outbursts of anger, selfish ambition, dissension, division,  21  envy, drunkenness, wild parties, and other sins like these. Let me tell you again, as I have before, that anyone living that sort of life will not inherit the Kingdom of God.<br>     22  But the Holy Spirit produces this kind of fruit in our lives: love, joy, peace, patience, kindness, goodness, faithfulness,  23  gentleness, and self-control. There is no law against these things!<br>     24  Those who belong to Christ Jesus have nailed the passions and desires of their sinful nature to his cross and crucified them there.  25  Since we are living by the Spirit, let us follow the Spirit's leading in every part of our lives.  26  Let us not become conceited, or provoke one another, or be jealous of one another.]<br>  <br>  Here the fruits of the Holy Spirit are explained. It helps you to understand and distinguish between 'good' fruit and 'bad' fruit.<br>  <br>  Also, as a follower of Christ, there are times when we make mistakes. So we need to understand and pray to God for guidance as even sometimes preachers also make mistakes as they are also human. As we pray to the Holy Spirit for guidance, He will lead us into understanding the truth. <br>  <br>  These verses refer to all faiths including Christianity. You can understand this from the letter of St John (reference 1 John 2:20-22) <br>  [20  But you are not like that, for the Holy One has given you his Spirit, [20]  and all of you know the truth.  21  So I am writing to you not because you don't know the truth but because you know the difference between truth and lies.  22  And who is a liar? Anyone who says that Jesus is not the Christ. [22]  Anyone who denies the Father and the Son is an antichrist.]|`|q6H2ru3waa	In The Gospel of John, it speaks about The "True Vine".  which is Jesus Christ. which will shed some light on a tree bearing "good fruit".  you will find this in 1 John 15:1-7; I AM the true vine (geniune).........cont' to read thru v 7.  These versus refer to anyone who repents and believes that Jesus Christ died for our sins it does not matter what denomination they are affililated with. There' s only one true God.(True Vine).  I agree with the Commentary, because being "carnal" is not bearing "good fruit".  Galatians 5:22-24; But the fruit of the Spirit is love, joy, peace, longsuffering, gentleness, goodness, faith, 23) Meekness, temperance: against such there is no law. 24)And they that are in  Christ's have crucified the flesh with the affections and lusts. 25) If we live in the Spirit, let us also walk in the Spirit.|`|j0gtbpS1aa	It is saying that anything that is contrary to the words of Christ are anti- christ and those that profess them are false teachers and therefore anti christs.

Please buy a Bible , read it and join a good Church where you can learn more and understand about Jesus Christ who came to earth to save men from their sins. Read it and ask God to guide you to understand His truth.<br>  <br>  Satan tries to divert our attention from reaching out to God through lies, fear , deceit, wrong company. Satan himself was an angel who rebelled against God and was condemned to spend eternity in hell. So Satan tries to prevent mankind from believing in God who sent His only Son Jesus to redeem man from the burden of sin. <br>  If you sincerely come to Jesus, repent of your sin and accept Christ as your savior and live out the rest of your life in obedience to Christ with the discernment of the Holy Spirit, Christ will assure you a place in heaven for all of eternity.

Hope is not wishful thinking. What I believe you should do is consider walking with Him.

Find out who has contributed and their back ground. There are notes on each page that suggest what is going on in the scripture. As you read, you too will have thoughts and your thoughts come from your background. If you don't understand something, pray about it and move on. You won't understand everything you read, but you will understand more. Keep walking with God as you would walk with a mentor. God won't tell you untrue things.<br>  <br>  Test everything with openness and don't shut down something you're unsure of. God will meet you where you are.<br>  <br>  In the Old Testament, God may seem Harsh. I believe He is just. I believe the people who felt His wrath choose to be disobedient.

Sudras, fallen Brahmanas and members of the higher castes who have given up the Vedic courses of conduct and Mlecchas will rule over the banks of the Indus and Chandrabhaga rivers, the city of Kaunti and the territory of Kashmira.<br>  <br>  These kings, O Parikshit, who will all be contemporaries, will be no better than Mlecchas (in their course of conduct) and will be given over to unrighteousness and mendacity, illiberal and furious ways. They will kill women, children, Brahmins and cows. They will covet other people’s wives and other people’s wealth. They will experience vicissitudes of fortune in quick succession and will be poor of strength and courage and will be short lived (too). They will cease to perform purificatory rites, will be devoid of righteous actions. Being dominated by Rajas and Tamas and being Mlecchas in the garb of Kshatriyas, they will suck the blood of their own people. The people ruled over by them too will acquire their habits, ways of life and mode of speech and, oppressed by one another as well as by their rulers, will go to ruin.<br>  <br>  Sri Suka continued : (Discourse 2) Thenceforth, day after day, by force of the all-powerful Time, O king, righteousness, veracity, purity (of mind and body), forgiveness, compassion, length of life, bodily strength and keenness of memory will decline. In the Kali age wealth alone will be the criterion of pedigree, morality and merit. Again, might will be the only factor determining righteousness and fairness. Personal liking will be the deciding factor in making the choice of a partner in life, and trickery alone will be the motive force in business dealings. Capability of affording sexual delight will be the (only) criterion of masculine or feminine excellence and the sacred thread will be the only mark of Brahmanhood.<br>  <br>  External marks will be the only means of knowing the Ashramas or the stages in life (of an individual) and the only guide in determining the mode of greeting which people should adopt when meeting one another. Justice will have every chance of being vitiated because of one’s inability to gratify those administering it, and voluble speech will be the (only) criterion of scholarship. Want of riches will be the sole test of impiety and hypocrisy will be the only touchstone of goodness. (Mutual) consent will be the sole determining factor in marriage and it will become acceptable practice to have toilet and bath (combined) in one place. A distant water reservoir or pond will be the only holy resort for bath etc., and wearing (long) hair will be regarded as the sign of beauty.<br>  <br>  Filling one’s belly will be the (only) end of human pursuit and audacity of speech will be the only criterion of veracity. Skill will consist in supporting one’s family; virtuous deeds will be performed (only) with the object of gaining fame; and when in this way the terrestrial globe will be overrun by wicked people, the person who would prove to be the most powerful amongst the Brahmanas, Kshatriyas, Vaisyas, and Sudras will become the ruler. Robbed of their wealth and of their women by greedy and merciless Kshatriyas, behaving like robbers, people will resort to mountains and forests and subsist on leaves, roots, meat, honey, fruits, flowers and seeds.<br>  <br>  (Already) oppressed by famine and (heavy) taxation, people will perish through drought, (excessive) cold, storms, (scorching) heat of the sun, (heavy) rains, snowfalls and mutual conflict. In the age of Kali men will be tormented by hunger and thirst, ailments and worry and their maximum age will be only twenty to thirty years. When through the evil effect of Kali age the bodies of men get reduced in size and become emaciated, the righteous course laid out by the Vedas for men following the system of Varnas (caste system or grades of society) and the Ashramas (stages in life) gets lost, when religion is replaced by heresy to a large extent and rulers mostly turn out to be thieves. When men take to various pursuits like theft, mendacity, wanton destruction of life and so on; when members of the three higher castes are mostly converted into Sudras and cows are reduced to the size of she-goats and begin to yield as little milk. When people belonging to the four Ashramas mostly become householders and the connotation of relationship will extend only to the relatives of one’s wife. Annual plants get stunted in growth and trees are mostly reduced to the size of a Sami (a small tree). Clouds will mostly end in flashes of lightning (rather than pour rain) and dwellings will mostly look desolate (for want of hospitality to strangers).<br>  <br>  In this way, when the Kali age, whose influence is so severe on the people, is well-nigh past, the Lord will appear in His divine form (consisting of Sattwa alone) for the protection of virtue. Lord Vishnu, adored by the whole animate and inanimate creation and the Soul of the universe, appears (in this world of matter) for protecting the virtue of the righteous and wiping out (the entire stock of) their Karma (and thereby liberating them). The Lord will appear under the name of Kalki in the house of the high-souled Vishnuyasa –the foremost Brahmana of the village of Sambhala. Riding a fleet footed horse named Devadatta (because it will be presented to Him by the gods) and capable of subduing the wicked, Lord of the universe, wielding the well-known eight divine powers (Anima and so on) and possessed of endless virtues and matchless splendour, wearing the insignia of royalty,<br>  <br>  will traverse the globe on that swift horse and exterminate with his sword (weapon) tens of millions of robbers.<br>  <br>  Now when all the robbers are (thus) exterminated, the minds of the people of the cities and of the countryside will become pure indeed because of their enjoying the breeze wafting the most sacred fragrance from on the person of Lord Vasudeva. With Lord Vasudeva, the embodiment of strength in their heart, their progeny will grow exceedingly strong (as before). When Sri Hari, the Protector of Dharma, appears as Kalki, Satyayuga will prevail (once more) at that time and the progeny of the people will be of a Sattvika (virtuous) disposition. When the moon, the sun and Jupiter rise together in one zodiacal house and the Pusya constellation is in the ascendant, then it will be known as Satyayuga.|`|uO0knmZOaa	It is indeed mother of all jokes to say Islam is a religion of peace.

3sKU83sPaa	It's all in the sparks. It depends on who you spark with. It's not that important to declare your sexuality - because you may find that you spark with just about anyone. But the spark is important. Lots of people get in relationships when there is no spark - usually because they want to get married, start a family or just want the security of a relationship.<br>  <br>  But sparking with someone - that's sometimes rare and difficult to come across. I've sparked with three people in my lifetime - all women. <br>  <br>  By sparking, I mean a few things. First, we got along really, really well. We didn't have any problem keeping a conversation going, laughing together and finding things in common. Next, I couldn't get them off my mind. Then, I wanted to spend all of my time with them. That's a good spark. The excitement part fades later on, but that spark is usually what lets you know that you'll be able to tolerate this other human being for a considerable amount of time. <br>  <br>  If you're looking for advice: Wait for the spark. In the mean time, have fun and don't stress about it.|`|rjtEYwMXaa	bisexual = loves girls AND boys<br>  generally, the people who seem to be kissing both. this one is pretty hard to tell, cuz you cant really tell unless they're cheating on a girlfriend/boyfriend.<br>  <br>  homosexual = <br>  for boys, some of them have a lisp. they are also very proud of being homosexual<br>  for girls, ionnoe, maybe if they start kissing?<br>  <br>  heterosexual = whatever people who dont follow the top categories|`|c41b490f74a1bde4b423d733767821a9aa	straight is great jk its not offensive tho, i am bi-curious whatever that really means idk|`|ZII6YCk1aa	They will usually tell you.|`|4SFHGHyfaa	If they like men, women or both

It might even be wishful thinking on my part!<br>  <br>  Just look around the world and see, you are on a loser.  Look at Russia - how communism fell and now the old Orthodox faith is back in there, along with Islam and others.  Look at how many countries Islam controls, then look at how many are into Roman Catholicism.  Then look at the USA, and see how many 'fundies' there are and Southern Baptists.  Even the President, and the one before him, claim Christianity!<br>  <br>  Then, of course, there's the spread of New Age (aka New Spirituality) among those who weren't very 'spiritual' before, making 'converts' to Hinduism and Buddhism, as well as the occult.  Then, there's the spread of Wicca (witchcraft) and Paganism - oh yes, it's going on, full steam ahead!<br>  <br>  Seriously, it's not going to happen.  Sorry to disappoint you, but can't you see that religion - whether good religion or bad, whatever - is growing throughout the world.  I suppose because people need something to cling onto, when everything is being moved out of its place.  And they are seeking spiritual 'kicks'.  Well, that's my explanation.<br>  <br>  Not only that, being a student of Bible Prophecy, I know what the Bible says about the future and - guess what? - it's going to be more religious than ever!  For the Bible predicts a One World Church - made up of all of them combined - with (most likely) the Pope as the head.  Just thought I'd tell you that.<br>  <br>  Now, if it helps, I don't like this anymore than you, but from a Christian point of view.  However, even I have to see that it's happening increasingly - even teaming up with government - whether you or I like it or not.

Satan hates this as sabbath is Gods seal and mark of his authority which is why the catholic church enforced sunday worship in 321 AD constantine, and killed millions who kept biblical sabbath. History is rapidly repeating itself and we dont have long left with the blue laws for sunday already there and are gaining power already in places like canada and croatia. everything in the governernment is placed and controlled by satanic leaders (illuminati and jesuits)

But, in reality we are not at all satisfied with whatever we have.Be it out of necessity, or envy, or greed, we want more.when one enters spirituality realms, one realizes (and he preaches to others) that the body in which we live is mortal, all that we should be concerned should be of the spirit within us, that will go to heaven or hell for eternity.here also, those who are shrewd pretend to be religious for personal gains. But the real religious person takes pleasure in helping the underpriviledged, takes care of the helpless, sharing his/her resources with the needy people knowing that this riches will not last or useful for his/her after life..So, one is basically said to attain peace thru' spirituality. Now it is another matter as to which religion preaches true peace. As for me, Iam peaceful with The Prince of Peace, my LORD and savior JESUS CHRISt, who surrounds me with peace.<br>  Thanks.|`|tJqG2q9uaa	1 freedom from disturbance; quiet and tranquility : you can while away an hour or two in peace and seclusion.<br>  ? mental calm; serenity : the peace of mind this insurance gives you.<br>  2 freedom from or the cessation of war or violence : the Straits were to be open to warships in time of peace.<br>  <br>  So how do you get peace? I take it thats the second part to your question. Buddhists believe peace is the cessation (stopping) of desire. Christians believe this too in a way but for different reasons. All faith sets that offer peace have desire as the opposite to peace when it boils down to it which is why we equate peace with spirituality. Buddhists believe that stopping all desires - the want of anything be it good health, relationships, material possessions - will ultimately lead to a state of ultimate peace if practised consistantly (nirvana.) its quite complex but thats the simplified version. Christians believe that peace comes from knowing that while its okay to desire and can be a great thing ultimately your fundamental needs will be met in jesus  and you will receive a 'peace which transcends all understanding'. It makes sense that to stop desiring will bring you peace because when you think about it you're not at peace when you want something that you dont have. The thing to ask is do you want to stop desiring? What do you put your trust in? Where is your hope? when you answer these questions you'll be able to discern what makes you unpeaceful. So if you want to be financially secure money will theoretically bring you peace (how much is enough is a good question to ask realistically!) If you want significant relationships what happens when they falter? Which is why spirituality is equated with peace - its outside human boundaries so theres a chance you'll find it. The trick is you will only find peace if what you believe you are certain is true. otherwise you'll always second guess yourself. Having studied at length i believe jesus does bring ultimate peace - its up to you to look at the different answers and decide for yourself. Good luck - i really hope you find what you're looking for.|`|JXMpZiwxaa	Spirituality leads to true peace, a peace which only God can give. A person can have peace in his or her home by practicing the Devotion to the Seven Sorrows of Mary.  See promise #1 below:<br>  <br>  The Seven Sorrows of Mary are as follow:<br>  <br>  1. The Prophecy of Simeon<br>  2. The Flight into Egypt<br>  3. The Loss of the Child Jesus in the Temple<br>  4. Mary Meets Jesus as He Carries His Cross<br>  5.

Jesus is Placed in the Tomb.<br>  <br>  Mary wishes for us to pray one Hail Mary while meditating on each of the Seven Sorrows, for a total of seven Hail Marys.

First, the Muslim should make their intentions for purification, then wash the private parts. Then make wudu like the wudu done for prayer, then pour water on his right side, then the left side. Then water should be poured on his head, covering the entire body with water. It is also reported in the sunnah that the washing the feet should be delayed until the end of the ghusl. As is reported on the authority of A'ishah (May Allah be pleased with her) who said that the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) when performing ghusl from janaba used to wash his hands, then wash his private parts with his left hand. After that he performed wudu like that for prayer. Next he took some water and ran his fingers in the roots of his hair until he used three handfuls of water on his head. He would then go on pouring water on the rest of his body and wash his legs. (It was reported by Muslim #479.) In the narration of Al-Bukhari it states that he (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) then turned aside and washed his legs.<br>  <br>  Allah knows best.

MUkC93kUaa	I don't know who came to my last dinner party, because I kind of excused myself awkwardly before anyone arrived, and didn't come out again until everyone left.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  I am good host!|`|CMms2lGoaa	Christmas. Family and friends. And actually, my family is not that rich. My adopted cousin has special needs, and my uncle and aunt and Nana are taking free food in because they don't have enough money to buy enough for their family, and they also have another newborn baby. And guess what. My uncle is barely getting through cause his back and legs and he is taking allot of medicine and hurting allot. So you would think that we would be doing a good deed by inviting them in for Christmas dinner.|`|NMaCcyeKaa	No one.  I don't have dinner parties.|`|YUAegpPoaa	Spiritually speaking, just my wife. Any time I cook and do not burn something we can call it a party.<br>  <br>  She isn't as spry as she used to be but I wouldn't go as far as lame - and while I wouldn't classify her as blind either she seems to love me so you be the judge.|`|AA11212224	I've never had a dinner party, so...<br>  <br>  But if I did, I couldn't invite the poor, crippled, blind, and lame folks I know, because that would be inviting friends.

I cooked for all of them. <br>  ;D<br>  <br>  <br>  Luke 14:12, "DO NOT ASK YOUR FRIENDS, YOUR BROTHERS"<br>  Clearly this is not to be taken as an absolute prohibition against inviting friends or relatives to a meal. Christ employed similar hyperbole in v.26:<br>  <br>  "If anyone comes to Me and does not hate his father and mother, wife and children, brothers ans sisters, yes, and his own life also, he cannot be My disciple." <br>  (Luke 14:26)<br>  <br>  Such language is common in Semitic discourse and is used for emphasis. His point here is that inviting one's friends & relatives cannot be classifed as spiritual act of true charity. It may also be a rebuke against those prone to reserve their hospitality for "RICH NEIGHBORS" who they know will feel obligated to return the favor.<br>  <br>  Luke 14:14, "REPAID AT RESSURECTION": <br>  (with treasure in heaven)<br>  <br>  "So whne Jesus heard these things, He said to him, "You still lack one thing.

h3gMzNS3aa	All humans are biologically and mentally wired to fear death. Even saying "I don't fear death" is a defence mechanism against the fear of death. I'm comfortable with a resurrection if it's a positive experience; from what some religions say it's fine while what some other religions say it's negative, so really depends who's in control of it.|`|Ve18FAnGaa	atheistic views really are rarely about things like ease or comfort.  umm, i guess i see it as a positive thing but that would be because i'm just kinda "working with what i've got." ya know?  When you mention the idea of resurrection, i stopped and thought about it.  it gave me some interesting ideas (i don't know specifically what view of resercetion you are taking, nor if its even one i am familiar with) that seamed appealing and even fun.  Thats the nature of imagination though.  i can think up the things that will be the most reassuring or pleasing for me of anything in the world or the scariest and most horrible.  When i look at what i see as reality i try not use those filters, just what's there.  so with that in mind, fading out of existence after death is, for me, just something that will happen.  i can use it to motivate myself, but no matter what i do its like the seasons.  its just inevitable for me.|`|7J69CQvTaa	I still don't get what basis people have for an afterlife.<br>  <br>  All your so called "external outputs" are wired into your brain. Your feelings, thoughts,sensations etc. Once you die the brain shuts off. The body rots. What is left of your identity/consciousness?<br>  <br>  Do you seriously believe there is an invisible force that lives inside your body that continues your consciousness after you die? Give me a break.<br>  <br>   I simply don't get how afterlife is even feasible.|`|NrzxtivLaa	everyone on the planet is resurrected in a certain fashion......we're all composed of elements that've been recycled continuously since the earliest epoch of the universe|`|4qA9Y7m9aa	Err...what would the positive side be?|`|AA10367694	The Resurrection refers to a Life  after the life on Earth. Matter can not be destroyed. The human body too would not be. We all, even the religious, tend to be forgetful about resurrection, hence we commit sins. This forgetfulness is the human nature. The Altars keep reminding the humans of the lessons which we tend to be forgetting..The conscience may keep pricking, we tend to be neglecting..|`|cygtJLBuaa	There is not negative. Because when you die its over with. if you lived a good life and affected many people then you led a good life and hopefully changed the course of time. and you can lay to rest. so all i see is positive. <br>  <br>  and why would i want to come back? one life time is enough.|`|kksq9BtOaa	Positive and negative have no meaning unless your talking about magnets.<br>  <br>  Im gonna die and stay that way, i managed to come to grips with that by the time i was six unlike many religious people who want to live forever.|`|VcM9zyikaa	i see the positive in everything, no matter how bad it is|`|GGGmoyNeaa	I accept facts as fact. I don't engage in wishful thinking.|`|MTi7r9l6aa	Uh, yeah, I'm pretty sure I wouldn't want to be a zombie.|`|9m2LvlWdaa	Resurrection has no basis in reality.

fc9205d542b3f8b1281ff1f85cc2e6f9aa	Yes.<br>  <br>  But so far it seems that it only happens to women. There's Cynthia Nixon (actress-Miranda on Sex &the City). She was straight had kids and then she met a woman and fell in love with her and now she's with this woman.<br>  <br>  I think Cheryl Swopes, female basketball star, was also straight and then fell for a woman.<br>  <br>  So it is possible. Love is love right?<br>  <br>  But I haven't heard of this happening to straight men, but that might be because they'll just hide and  bury their feelings rather than just going for it. Women don't seem to have that problem.<br>  <br>  I think that if you can find someone to love you and you love them back, and you feel alive and happy, who cares what gender they are. Don't let them get away, cause then you'll live your entire life with a longing that can never be filled. Not good!|`|F0ung66zaa	love is love man....<br>  <br>  love does not know numbers, color, ethnicity or gender, only you set your limits on love<br>  <br>  orientation is only a limited area of your sexuality, in which you are active during your lifetime, and you can't break it, sorry...|`|AA12006309	Allow? You make it sound like there are rules and laws governing love. There aren't.  You love who you love, no matter how in denial about your sexuality you may be.|`|EagkCeNHaa	lol wut?|`|eX9UAPMXaa	Well say 2 apparently straight guys fall in love then their orientation just changes it doesn't break the barrier.|`|HvpkjTB2aa	Yeah|`|ctfSsZBhaa	well thats what we call a homosexual i think yes?<br>  u can love anyone of any orentation. jesus lover.|`|S2mTsV1vaa	Well, that's kind of what's happening with me and Nick...Although, I'm almost 99.9% sure I'm Bisexual. |`|N26qrTd3aa	Yes, I think it is possible because everyday you are growing and learning new thingss about yourself, so sometimes your orientation can change,that'ss why its better not to use labels.

When he (pbuh) went back down Musa (as) asked him how many times his followers are too pray and when he heard then he told Muhammad (pbuh) to ask Allah to decreased it cuz the people wouldn't be able to do it. And it kept going like this until the number reached 5 and even then Musa (as) asked to decrease this more but the Prophet felt ashamed to ask again. So it stayed 5 times a day.<br>  <br>  3) 6236 or 6346 ayat (wa Allahu alium, used google :p) and words 77,473 ;) bonus?<br>  <br>  4) 2.5% <br>  <br>  5) Last aya of Surah Baqarah, 286<br>  <br>  Allah does not burden any human being with more than he can bear. Everyone will enjoy of his deeds and suffer of his wrongdoings.<br>  (the believers say) "Our Rabb! Do not punish us if we forget or make a mistake. Our Rabb! Lay not on us the kind of burden that we have no strength to bear. Pardon us, Forgive us, Have mercy on us.<br>  You are our Protector, help us against the unbelievers."<br>  <br>  6) According to a hadith a companion of Prophet Muhammad (s.a.w.) came to him one day and asked him "What is the thing that Allah (s.w.t.) loves most?" Prophet Muhammad (s.a.w.) replied "The thing that Allah (s.w.t.) loves most is when his people pray salah on time."<br>  <br>  Fun.. need more of these <br>  Jazaak Allahu khairun|`|nS7koC7Oaa	1- Al-Alaq<br>  2- If it werent with wudu', you can pray as much as you can.<br>  3- 6236-6666<br>  4- one fourth of the tenth 2.5% <br>  5- Al-Baqara 286, the last Ayah<br>  God charges no soul save to its capacity, that is, what it is capable of bearing; for it is what it has merited, of good and its reward, and against it is what it has earned, of evil and its burden: no person shall be requited for another’s sin or for what he has not earned, even if he was tempted to do it. Say: Our Lord, take us not to task, by way of chastisement, if we forget, or err, by straying from the right path unknowingly — as You used to take to task those before us: God has lifted this [burden] from this community, as reported in hadīth. The petition here, then, is a way of acknowledging God’s favour; our Lord, burden us not with a load, an affair which we cannot bear, such as You did lay upon those before us, namely, upon the Children of Israel, as for example, the killing of oneself in repentance, the paying of a quarter of one’s property for alms, and the severing of the impure part. Our Lord, do not burden us beyond what we have the power, the strength, to bear, of obligations and trials; and pardon us, effacing our sins, and forgive us, and have mercy on us, with mercy added to Your forgiveness; You are our Patron, our Master and the Guardian of our affairs; so grant us assistance against the disbelieving folk, by establishing definitive proof [for us] and victory over them in battle, for it is expected of a patron that he assist his clients against their enemies. In a hadīth it is stated that when this verse was revealed and the Prophet (s) was reciting it, after each word it was said to him, “Granted”.<br>  <br>  6- The messenger of Allah PBUH said: “Order your children to pray (meaning teach them and help them pray) at the age of seven and punish them if they don’t do it at the age of ten and separate them in their beds”|`|MhbEQoJYaa	1)Al- Alaq'<br>  2)50 times a day I think<br>  3)6236 Ayahs<br>  4)2.5% of annual income<br>  5)Al- Baqarah<br>  6)??

However others are overwhelmed with the sorrows of this present time, be not you so. Christ's disciples, more than others, should keep their minds quiet, when everything else is unquiet. Here is the remedy against this trouble of mind, Believe. By believing in Christ as the Mediator between God and man, we gain comfort. The happiness of heaven is spoken of as in a father's house. There are many mansions, for there are many sons to be brought to glory. Mansions are lasting dwellings. Christ will be the Finisher of that of which he is the Author or Beginner; if he have prepared the place for us, he will prepare us for it. Christ is the sinner's Way to the Father and to heaven, in his person as God manifest in the flesh, in his atoning sacrifice, and as our Advocate. He is the Truth, as fulfilling all the prophecies of a Saviour; believing which, sinners come by him the Way. He is the Life, by whose life-giving Spirit the dead in sin are quickened.

En determinado momento se les dice: "?No!

Pero tenemos que mantenernos firmes a las promesas del Se?or y respetarlos, quererlos y aceptarlos, no solo como padres espirituales, sino como humanos y con todos sus defectos.<br>  Tenemos que trabajar en renovar la fe verdadera y conservar el culto que aprendieron nuestros padres y los padres de nuestros padres hasta llegar a los apóstoles.

No puede cuestionarse que él es el sucesor de Pedro y por tanto cabeza de la Iglesia por quienes profesamos la fe católica, pero no por eso lo vamos a aceptar incondicionalmente. Tiene que ganárselo. Y le va a costar muchísimo trabajo. Más cuando a escasos meses de su elección, se le ocurre leer textos del siglo XII donde se les da con todo a los musulmanes, y que estuvo a punto de ocasionar un pleito con ellos.

Es innegable el carisma de Karol Wojtila y el papel que jugó en el derrumbe del bloque sovietico. Sin embargo el estuvo atrapado por los juegos de poder que desgarran a la iglesia, principalmente la lucha entre la facción masónica de la logia P-2, instigadores del asesinato de Juan Pablo I y la facción neonazi y ultraconservadora encabezada por el opus dei. Juan Pablo II fue llevado al poder por el opus dei y, aunque trató de mantener un equilibrio entre ambas facciones, fue incapaz de eliminar las luchas internas que tanto da?o le han hecho a la iglesia (por ejemplo, el escándalo del banco ambrosiano). Juan Pablo II no liberalizó la iglesia e inclusó siguió persiguiendo a personas inteligentes como Hans Kuhn, Euge Drewerman, Monse?or Gaillot  y Leonardo Boff. Obviamente detrás de un papá enfermo y manipulable estaba el maquiavélico Ratzinger, presidente de la congregación para la doctrina de la fé y miembro del terrible opus dei. Con su llegada al trono pontificio la iglesia se ha hundido en una crisis mayor, pues se ha declarado totalmente a favor del opus dei, cerrando así la puerta a iniciativas de gran necesidad para la superviviencia de la iglesia, como la aceptación de la anticoncepción, el otorgamiento del sacerdocio a las mujeres (hasta el 361 la iglesia católica tuvo sacerdotisas y obispas), el celibato opcional para los clérigos (tal como fue hasta el a?o 1054), etc., etc. Aunque hay que reconocer que Ratzinger ha mantenido una mayor dureza en el combate a la criminalidad dentro de la iglesia (corrupción, pederastía) que la que tuvo Juan Pablo II, esta es claramente insuficiente.<br>  Actualmente la Iglesia Católica para sobrevivir requiere de un papa más democrático, menos machista, más honesto, más solidario con los pobres y menos tolerante con los atropellos de los poderosos. Pero lo que más requiere son fieles más críticos y activos, un cuerpo de la iglesia realmente más cercano a las ense?anzas originales de Jesús.<br>  <br>  Pax tibi!!|`|eba4ad19d30dfa323d7c9d63d14ad3e2aa	vete al pepino a quien le importa eso

Lj8wd2cTaa	Los nombres de DIOS según el antiguo testamento y la teología son los siguientes:<br>  1o Jehová.<br>  2o Yavé.<br>  3o Alá.<br>  4o Elohim.<br>  5o El.<br>  6o Emmanuel.<br>  7o Santísima Trinidad.<br>  8o Adonai.<br>  Saludos.|`|47ae702c0d2ab3c901aa7879a28431dbaa	Bueno, llamarlo Yavéh o Jehová es una falta de respeto para denominar al D-os de Israel.<br>   Lo correcto sería llamarlo:<br>  <br>  Adona-i<br>  Elohim<br>  HaShem<br>  El Altisimo<br>  El Eterno<br>  El Todo Poderoso<br>  <br>  ?Saludos!|`|8539a17770498d93dd848566dda165caaa	En castellano, la palabra ?Dios?, a diferencia de otras lenguas indoeuropeas, viene indirectamente del griego Θεο? -Theos- (Dios), forma genitiva de Zeus, a través del latín. Esta palabra por su parte tiene una radical que deriva en Dev(a) Pitar -"dios padre"- en sánscrito y Jupiter en latín. La raíz de estas palabras es la misma que la de la palabra "día", palabra que en su etimología hace referencia al cielo despejado y luminoso.<br>  <br>  Al latín la palabra griega Theos fue transcripta como Deus, y de él derivan, entre otros, Déu (catalán), Dieu (francés), Dio (italiano) y Deus (gallego y portugués). La palabra Dios en castellano es un resto de nominativo, por provenir de Deus (nominativo) y no del acusativo Deum, que sería lo esperable, como muestra la conservación de la -s final.<br>  <br>  Hay una serie de nombres de Dios en las lenguas indoeuropeas que se interpretan como derivadas de una única forma original, protoindoeuropea, Dyeus. éste habría sido el nombre del dios dominante del panteón protoindoeuropeo. Encontramos una forma próxima a la original en el sánscrito antiguo: deiw-os. El nombre aparece sistemáticamente asociado en la mayoría de los casos a p′ter, que significa padre. En el sánscrito tardío esta forma ha evolucionado a Dyaus pitar. Entre las diversas derivaciones tenemos el griego Zeus pater (la ortografía castellana es enga?osa, porque la Z se pronuncia como Th en inglés, casi como una D) cuya forma latinizada es Iupiter (Júpiter), y también la expresión latina tardía, nuevamente derivada del griego, Deus pater, que en espa?ol evoluciona a Dios padre. En las lenguas germánicas la evolución de pater lleva a formas como Father y Vater, pero la palabra Dios ya no aparece, sino que se su lugar lo ocupa la germánica God o Gott, originada en una raíz de la que derivan también nombres de pueblos como los godos. El nombre Yahvé es semítico, no indoeuropeo, y no guarda parentesco con ninguna de las formas indoeuropeas de designar al dios supremo.<br>  <br>  <br>  [editar] Uso de la mayúscula<br>  Cuando en castellano nos referimos al dios del Judaísmo, el Cristianismo, el Islam y, a veces, del Hinduísmo, lo hacemos con letra mayúscula: ?Dios?.<br>  <br>  Esta costumbre deriva del arraigo de la fuerte influencia que el cristianismo ha tenido sobre nuestra cultura, pues se usaba la mayúscula para diferencia de otros dioses paganos.<br>  <br>  Todos los pronombres y adjetivos que se refieren a Dios se mayusculizan también, y se tiende a usar el género masculino para ello. Así por ejemplo, se habla de ?El Se?or?, ?él?, ?Su?, ?Tú? o ?Vos?, etcétera.<br>  <br>  <br>  [editar] Los Nombres de Dios<br>  El vocablo "Dios" es en castellano el utilizado para referirnos a la deidad suprema de las religiones monoteístas. Sin embargo, no siempre se traducen los nombres que en otras religiones designan al mismo Dios, o a un concepto semejante, sino que se citan en la lengua del país de origen. Algunos nombres que se refieren o se pueden referir al mismo Dios:<br>  <br>   <br>  YHWH, el nombre de Dios o Tetragrammaton, en fenicio (1100 BC a AD 300), Arameo (Siglo 10BC a 0) y caracteres hebreos modernos.Allāh (árabe; ha dado Alá en castellano), en el Islam. Aunque se suele creer lo contrario, no es un nombre propio sino la palabra "Dios" en árabe. Con esta palabra, los arabohablantes (sean musulmanes, cristianos o judíos) se refieren al Dios único de las religiones monoteístas (véase 99 nombres de Dios). <br>  Cao ?ài (vietnamita), en el caodaísmo. <br>  Yavé o Yahweh (YHVH (????) en hebreo) es otro nombre usado por las comunidades judías y cristianas. Suele traducirse como "El que es" o "El que vive". En el culto judío este nombre no se pronuncia aunque aparezca escrito en los textos religiosos, diciéndose en su lugar adonai. Algunas confesiones cristianas utilizan para referirse a Dios el nombre Jehová, otra posible traducción del hebreo Yahveh. <br>  Elohim (del hebreo también), usado en la Biblia. <br>  Santísima Trinidad (abarcando al Padre, al Hijo y al Espíritu Santo), representa a Dios en casi toda la fe cristiana. <br>  Ayyavazhi en el sur de La India. <br>  Waheguru es el término del Sikhismo para Dios. <br>  Anu es el dios supremo de la mitología sumeria. <br>  Jah es el nombre de Dios en el movimiento Rastafari. <br>  Igzi'abihier (literalmente Se?or del Universo) en la Iglesia ortodoxa de Etiopía. <br>  Jaungoikoa (literalmente Se?or de las Alturas) en euskera. <br>  Ngai es el nombre Masai de Dios. <br>  Niskam para los Micmac. <br>  En la Surat Shabda Yoga Dios recibe los nombres de Anami Purush (Anónimo Poder) y Radha Soami (Se?or del Alma). <br>  <br>  <br>  Espero tener ayudado!<br>  Saludos!|`|RzEF7l6caa	Dios padre<br>  anciano de dias<br>  Juez<br>  Creador<br>  Redentor<br>  Dios Hijo<br>  Dios espiritu Santo<br>  Cristo<br>  Jesus<br>  JesuCristo<br>  bueno ahi tienes nombres de toda la trinidad divina.<br>  suerte|`|i7ofsrLtaa	Yavehee es la antítesis de Jehová, yavhee, era el alma gemela de Jehová,  y se revelo ante jehová, hoy es un ángel caído, lo mas critico que el cardenal de  Los ángeles, California Bautizo a la catedral de Los ángeles en honor a Yhave,|`|fbcd01cb8da58dee42ea172034a439e4aa	Algunos le dicen dios, otros Dios, alá, marilyn manson, jehova, javhee, quetzalcoatl, amor..yo le digo MENTIRA|`|6QREuMawaa	Shaddai<br>  Adonai|`|1575327efdf4614a14a1f651d4edeb28aa	en Hebreo:YWHW (EL YO SOY), en espa?ol, Jehová<br>  Adonai, en Arameo.|`|257070287441810e9047bfef7939f0c7aa	Diosito y Edonay|`|5d0d74fd5f6ed203b0f5ade44d1da232aa	todos los nombres de las diferentes religiones..... es un Solo Dios con todos los nombres.|`|86eb6c6fde9456771a9b233a0af9a85daa	Nadie sabe el nombre de Dios.

c9a1b864f1a97925067a5a7737860ac4aa	Genesis 4:17 says, "Cain lay with his wife, and she became pregnant and gave birth to Enoch." Who was his wife? It is implied in the biblical text that Cain married one of his sisters. Several facts lead us to this conclusion.<br>  First, it is clear that Adam and Eve had a number of children. Genesis 5:4 says, "After Seth was born, Adam lived 800 years and had other sons and daughters." Since Adam and Eve were the first man and woman, and since God had commanded them (and their descendants) to be fruitful and multiply (Genesis 1:28), it seems reasonable to conclude that Cain married one of his many sisters. It is also possible that he married a niece or even a grandniece.<br>  One must keep in mind that in the early years of the human race there were no genetic defects that had yet developed as a result of the fall of man. By the time of Abraham, God had not yet declared this kind of marriage to be contrary to His will (see Genesis 20:12). Laws governing incest apparently did not become enacted until the time of Moses (Lev 18:7-17; 20:11,12,14,17,20,21). Hence, there was no prohibition regarding marrying a sister (or niece or grandniece) in the days of Cain.<br>  <br>  Gen 20:12 Besides, she really is my sister, the daughter of my father though rot of my mother; and she became my wife.|`|RZetcwalaa	So why are all humans cursed if there were already humans on the earth, original sin is not only hereditary but also contageous now as well?|`|5IhMq5o6aa	This is very baffling.

Cain and Abel as their sons.<br>  Original sin was from that point of disobedience to G-d.<br>  Generational sins and generational curses differ too.<br>   The reference of "all  in Adam die and all in Christ are made alive" is one of change as we accept Yashua/Jesus as our Lord and Saviour. We can pray about generational curses from the family lineage, Or even ones we adopted as unbelievers, athists or agnostics.<br>   Being alive in Christ empowers to be forgiven and have the restoration made to G-d through Messiah.<br>   Being trabsformed to the glory of G-d and his likeness are steps of a new direction.|`|MXX2q4aWaa	If you believe evolutionists, we are all descended from one woman (Mitochondrial Eve) and one man (Y-Chromosomal Adam).|`|qq2iAUC6aa	only if your stupid enough to take the bible literally|`|TK8q5Ngbaa	if u believe the christians we are all inbred|`|ea1cfca049c6e7d32f123d6a2a594c1eaa	Thank you , that is a very good question.I've alway's wonder but never really asked.|`|tmKBO4Hcaa	yes, this has to be true if you believe the christians<br>  <br>  and who does|`|56fe1840e334cd88069f2645ba55ecd6aa	I think the Adam and Eve story is supposed to be a metaphor, though I'm sure many people take it literally.<br>  <br>  Supposedly Adam lived very long (900 years or more), so Adam and Eve could be said to be genetically perfect.  If you were to take the story literally, you could argue our modern short lives are due to genetic deterioration due to excessive inbreeding.  Also, where did all the different races come from?  <br>  <br>  Adam and Eve's son Cain,  supposedly found a wife somewhere, and Adam and Eve were supposed to have many other unnamed sons and daughters, even though the bible only mentions Cain, Abel and Seth by name.   There had to be incest or God forgot to mention the other people he created!|`|jg5Ii27Vaa	it also states that Adam and Eve had many other children. his wife was his sister. not Eve.|`|bUWWeT0Xaa	I am not sure if the Bible makes it clear how many children Adam and Eve had together.

I get it that pretty much that there was a line from Cain and one from Able, but because Able was the first murder victim that line was from Seth.

Pra quem n?o acredita e acha que é besteira, desses eu tenho mta pena, sua almas seram consumidas|`|d5b7bc606fafcbb88e97a56cc11cf805aa	Quem é o Homem 666?<br>    <br>  Sugiro que imprima para facilitar seu estudo e anota??es pessoais, vamos tratar de profecias bíblicas encontradas no livro de Daniel e no Apocalipse. Estudaremos especificamente o capítulo 7 de Daniel e os capítulos 12, 13 e 17 do Apocalipse.<br>  Primeiro, devemos entender os princípios de interpreta??o que se encontram em Daniel 7. Nesse capítulo encontramos quatro “bestas” que se levantam do mar: um le?o, um urso, um leopardo, e uma besta terrível e espantosa com 10 chifres. O le?o representa a Babil?nia, o primeiro império mundial na época de Daniel. O urso representa o segundo império mundial: a Medo-Pérsia, e o leopardo representa o terceiro reino mundial: a Grécia com Alexandre, o Grande. O leopardo tem quatro cabe?as. Estas cabe?as representam os quatro generais que dividiram o império de Alexandre após a sua prematura morte. <br>  Devemos ter presente que estas cabe?as pertencem ao corpo. Quando estudarmos em Apocalipse a besta com sete cabe?as, nos daremos conta de que estas s?o reis ou governantes que também pertencem às bestas ali representadas, tal qual as quatro cabe?as do leopardo representam os reis ou governantes descritos nesta profecia de Daniel. <br>  A quarta besta terrível e espantosa com 10 chifres, representa Roma como sendo o quarto império mundial. Os 10 chifres s?o o resultado da divis?o do império romano em 10 na??es. Ao dizer que estes chifres s?o o resultado das bestas (impérios) ali representado, confirma-se ao estudar o Apocalipse, onde encontramos os mesmos 10 chifres. Em Daniel 7, três dos dez chifres foram arrancados. Mais tarde veremos a quem representam estes chifres.<br>   <br>  Apocalipse 17<br>  Por hora vamos ao Apocalipse 17, come?ando com o versículo 1: Veio um dos sete anjos que tinham as sete ta?as, e falou comigo, dizendo: Vem, mostrar-te-ei a condena??o da grande prostituta que está assentada sobre muitas águas;<br>  No Apocalipse 17:15 temos:  Disse-me ainda: As águas que viste, onde se assenta a prostituta, s?o povos, multid?es, na??es e línguas.<br>  E no Apocalipse 17:2 diz: com a qual se prostituíram os reis da terra; e os que habitam sobre a terra se embriagaram com o vinho da sua prostitui??o. <br>  Aqui vemos a “mulher” em uma alian?a espúria com os reis da Terra. Na Bíblia, o vinho representa doutrinas e verdades. Aqui nos diz que a mulher embriaga os habitantes da terra com as suas falsas doutrinas e falsas verdades (vinho prostituído).<br>  Ent?o ele me levou em espírito a um deserto; e vi uma mulher montada numa besta cor de escarlata, que estava cheia de nomes de blasfêmia, e que tinha sete cabe?as e dez chifres. Apoc 17:3<br>  Jo?o também nos diz em Apoc 12:6 que a mulher:  E a mulher fugiu para o deserto, onde já tinha lugar preparado por Deus, para que ali fosse alimentada durante mil duzentos e sessenta dias.<br>  Também, em Apoc 12:14 nos diz que: E foram dadas à mulher as duas asas da grande águia, para que voasse para o deserto, ao seu lugar, onde é sustentada por um tempo, e tempos, e metade de um tempo, fora da vista da serpente.<br>  Esta combina??o de 1260 dias, a encontramos nos livros de Daniel e Apocalipse 7 vezes. Cada vez que é mencionada tem por objetivo descrever o período de tempo do chifre pequeno de Daniel 7 e da besta do Apocalipse 12 e 13. <br>   <br>  1.260 dias<br>  Em Daniel 7, encontramos uma data (pista) de início para esta profecia de 1260 dias proféticos ou anos. Recordemos a quarta besta “terrível e espantosa” com 10 chifres de Daniel 7. Esta besta, como vimos, representa a Roma pag?, o quarto império mundial ou quarto reino que dominaria a Terra.<br>  Esta besta terrível tinha 10 chifres, os quais representavam as 10 na??es que resultariam do império romano. Em Daniel 7 nos diz que 3 dos chifres foram arrancados. A História nos conta que três das 10 na??es se negaram a estarem debaixo da autoridade dos bispos de Roma, ou seja, estar debaixo  do poder papal. Os 3 poderes (reinos) que desconheceram a autoridade do bispo de Roma foram:<br>  ?         Os Vandalos <br>  ?         Os Hérulos <br>  ?         Os Ostrogodos <br>  Este último povo foi vencido no ano de 538 d.C. pelo imperador romano, Justiniano.  <br>  A partir desta data (538 d.C.) foram totalmente eliminados os três poderes que resistiam à Roma Imperial, permitindo assim que o papa controlasse a Europa.<br>  Justiniano firmou ent?o um decreto neste mesmo ano de 538, no qual ele outorgava ao bispo de Roma, autoridade final sobre as Escrituras e autoridade total sobre os assuntos civis dos reinos do continente (Europa). Estava estabelecido assim um sistema político-religioso (igreja-estado) através de um decreto, surgindo assim o papado.<br>  Em 1798, exatamente 1260 anos depois, Napole?o se disp?s a conquistar a Europa e mandou o seu general Berthier para capturar e depor o papa Pio VI.<br>  Napole?o decretou a extin??o do papado e como n?o foi mais eleito nenhum papa, o mundo pensou que este fosse realmente o fim do poder papal.<br>  Portanto, vemos que os 1260 anos proféticos come?aram em 538 d.C. e continuaram até o ano de 1798. <br>  Quando Jo?o, o revelador, viu a esta mulher sentada sobre uma besta no deserto, estava contemplando os 1260 de poder absoluto do papado. Nestes dias, nem mesmo um príncipe assumia o seu reino se n?o fosse com a autoriza??o do papa. Se bem que Carlos Magno (Inglaterra) tentou mas, ludibriado, aceitou pedir permiss?o (bên??os) ao papa. <br>   <br>  Um dia / um ano<br>  Apocalipse 12 relaciona duas vezes o período de “um tempo, e tempos e metade de um tempo”. Quando a mulher foge para o deserto, repete-se novamente, no capítulo, este período, porém como sendo 1.260 dias. Em interpreta??o profética se aplica a norma de que um dia (profético) representa um ano (literal) conforme Números: 14:34 e Eze 4:6. Portanto, 1.260 dias representam 1.260 anos. <br>  Um “um tempo” em termos judaicos representam “um ano judaico” (360 dias). A palavra “tempos” (plural) representa dois anos, ou seja, 720 anos proféticos. Já a frase “metade de um tempo”, portanto é meio ano judaico, ou seja: 180 anos proféticos. Portanto, “um tempo, e tempos e metade de um tempo” resume-se em 360 + 720 + 180, o mesmo que 1260 dias proféticos ou anos literais... <br>  Ent?o ele me levou em espírito a um deserto; e vi uma mulher montada numa besta cor de escarlata... Apoc 17:3. Esta mulher existe na mesma época que a besta, já que está montada sobre ela. <br>  Esta besta “cheia de nomes de blasfêmia”. Cristo foi acusado de blasfemo quando afirmou poder perdoar pecados. Esta besta é religiosa em sua natureza, pois também afirma ter o poder de perdoar pecados. Aqui sim, caracteriza-se blasfêmia, pois é apenas um poder terreno.<br>  “Tinha 7 cabe?as e 10 chifres”. Recordemos que em Daniel 7, as cabe?as pertenciam às bestas ali descritas. As 4 cabe?as no leopardo representavam os quarto governantes que governariam a Grécia após Alexandre. <br>  Aqui no Apocalipse temos, portanto, 7 cabe?as que representam 7 reis ou governantes. Todos, fazendo parte da besta escarlate, ali representada. Ao desenrolar do nosso estudo, identificaremos quem é esta besta escarlate. <br>   <br>  Mulher / prostituta<br>  Em Daniel 7, os chifres em uma besta, s?o resultados ou conseqüências advindas da besta ali representada.<br>  Quando identificarmos a esta besta escarlata, veremos que os 10 chifres s?o, portanto, fruto ou conseqüências dela.  <br>  A mulher estava vestida de púrpura e de escarlata, e adornada de ouro, pedras preciosas e pérolas; e tinha na m?o um cálice de ouro, cheio das abomina??es, e da imundícia da prostitui??o; Apoc 17:4 <br>  Diz-se  na Bíblia que os pecados s?o escarlates (vermelhos) e ser?o esbranqui?ados como a neve. E que a cor vermelha (escarlata) representa o pecado. Deus nos diz, que esta “mulher” está “vestida” em pecado. A cor escarlate é também a cor oficial deste poder que descreveremos.<br>  ...e na sua fronte estava escrito um nome simbólico: A grande Babil?nia, a m?e das prostitui??es e das abomina??es da terra.  Apoc. 17:5.<br>  Deus compara na Bíblia, o Seu povo (a igreja) com uma mulher. Deus compara muitas vezes na Bíblia, Sua rela??o entre Ele e Seu povo com o matrimonio, onde Ele é o esposo. Sem equívoco, no Apocalipse encontramos duas mulheres. No capítulo 12 encontramos uma mulher pura, com uma coroa de 12 estrelas (apóstolos, cf Dan 12:3) e, no capítulo 17 encontramos uma mulher prostituída montada sobre uma besta escarlate com sete cabe?as e dez chifres. Deus chamou a Israel como sendo uma mulher prostituta (leia Oséias) e como um marido amoroso, implorou para que ela voltasse a Ele. Deus usa esta palavra “prostituta” para representar ao Seu povo em rebeli?o ou a um estado de apostasia. A prostituta, portanto, representa este povo de Deus que se encontra em apostasia e rebeli?o (Cain?).<br>  A “m?e” das prostitutas aqui mencionada, é a “m?e” da cristandade: a igreja romana... Uma “m?e” que tem muitas filhas e que também se chamam de prostitutas. Estas s?o filhas da “igreja m?e”, as igrejas advindas da reforma protestante e que se encontram em rebeli?o e apostasia contra os ideais de seus reformadores, ou melhor, contra o ideal divino registrado nas Sagradas Escrituras. <br>  E vi que a mulher estava embriagada com o sangue dos santos e com o sangue dos mártires de Jesus. Quando a vi, maravilhei-me com grande admira??o. Apoc. 17:6. <br>   <br>  Besta / poder político<br>  Historicamente, sabemos que a igreja Católica Apostólica Romana eliminou a milh?es de autênticos seguidores das Escrituras e que, portanto, n?o compartilhavam de suas doutrinas – durante a idade média. Recentemente, Jo?o Paulo II reconheceu isto e pediu perd?o ao mundo (e a Deus?) pelas atrocidades cometidas no passado.  <br>  Ao que o anjo me disse: Por que te admiraste? Eu te direi o mistério da mulher, e da besta que a leva, a qual tem sete cabe?as e dez chifres. Apoc. 17:7.<br>  Portanto, sabemos que esta mulher representa à igreja Católica. Vimos em Daniel que as bestas representam poderes políticos, e esta n?o é uma exce??o. A besta escarlata que está cheia de “blasfêmias” (julga-se semelhante a Deus). A igreja católica romana  é singular entre as demais igrejas; sua estrutura é dupla em natureza: é um poder religioso e também um governo (Estado do Vaticano).<br>  Ent?o, a mulher montada sobre a besta representa a igreja, e a besta, representa o governo de Roma regido pelos papas. O poder papal é uma monarquia que já teve 265 papas, os quais usaram 79 nomes papais ao longo de sua história.<br>   <br>  3 fases do ministério da besta<br>  A besta que viste era e já n?o é... Apoc 17:8. Jo?o viu à prostituta montada sobre a besta no deserto, matando milh?es de crist?os. A passagem que Jo?o viu, encontra-se no passado. Porém, devemos observar que Jo?o foi levado adiante no tempo, até o tempo em que Napole?o decretou “morto” o poder papal em 1798.<br>  Jo?o viu à mulher montada sobre a besta escarlata “no deserto”, o qual representa os 1260 anos proféticos que Deus determinou ao papado, desde o ano 538 a 1798 de nossa era. Foi dito a Jo?o que isto aconteceria no passado pois o anjo usa a frase “era”. E isto sabemos que assim sucedeu com esta primeira fase do poder papal, encerrando-se em 1798 d.C. <br>  A besta que viste era e já n?o é; todavia está para subir do abismo, e vai-se para a perdi??o; e os que habitam sobre a terra e cujos nomes n?o est?o escritos no livro da vida desde a funda??o do mundo se admirar?o, quando virem a besta que era e já n?o é, e que tornará a vir. Apoc. 17:8.<br>  Aqui s?o descritas três fases do ministério da besta escarlate.<br>  1.- "era".<br>  2.- "já n?o é".<br>  3.- "tornará a vir". <br>  Como vimos, a primeira fase terminou em 1798, quando Napole?o decretou o fim do poder papal, levando cativo Pio VI (Apoc 13:10). A segunda fase: “e já n?o é; todavia está para subir do abismo, e vai-se para a perdi??o...” descreve um período em que a igreja se recuperaria do seu colapso em 1798. A terceira descreve o regresso do novo poder, tal qual possuía antes de 1798. <br>   <br>  Sete reis / sete monarquias<br>  Aqui está a mente que tem sabedoria. As sete cabe?as s?o sete montes, sobre os quais a mulher está assentada; Apoc. 17:9. E o verso 10 diz:  ...s?o também sete reis: cinco já caíram; um existe; e o outro ainda n?o é vindo; e quando vier, deve permanecer pouco tempo.<br>  Jo?o recebeu a vis?o em uma perspectiva no tempo dos sete reis, já que se diz que a primeira fase do poder papal já passou (era). Devemos, portanto, colocar estas 7 cabe?as ou 7 reis durante um  tempo posterior a 1798. <br>  Em Daniel 7 aprendemos que as cabe?as em uma besta representam a governantes ou reis e que s?o provenientes destas bestas (fazem parte dela – o que descarta a interpreta??o mais aceita de que estas cinco cabe?as que caíram seriam os impérios de Babil?nia, Medo-Pérsia, Grécia, Roma Imperial e Roma Papal). Aqui s?o apontadas sete cabe?as, sete montes, sete reis. Em vista de que o poder papal é uma monarquia e que já teve 256 papas e que já usaram 79 nomes (títulos) papais diferentes, devemos identificar quantos nomes papais foram usados depois de 1798.<br>  Segundo o registro oficial do Vaticano, encontramos os seguintes nomes depois de 1798: Pio, Le?o, Gregório, Benedito, Jo?o, Paulo, e Jo?o Paulo. Sete nomes papais desde 1798.<br>  Em Apoc 13:18 encontramos a mesma frase usada em Apoc 17:9 (Aqui está a mente que tem sabedoria) como uma conex?o com o número da besta 666: Aqui há sabedoria. Aquele que tem entendimento, calcule o número da besta; porque é o número de um homem, e o seu número é seiscentos e sessenta e seis.  <br>  Aqui em Apoc 13 diz que devemos “calcular” o número da besta. Observe que um dos 7 nomes papais usados desde 1798 até hoje é Jo?o Paulo. Calcular o número da besta, consiste em somar o número (posi??o) do seu nome. Por exemplo: Jo?o Paulo I e Jo?o Paulo II seria igual 1 + 2 (o primeiro + o segundo) = a 3 (três). <br>  Se contarmos todos os papas na história que usaram estes nomes papais que surgiram após 1798 até os nossos dias, obteremos uma soma total de 665 (incluindo-se Jo?o Paulo II, que é o sétimo nome papal usado desde 1798).<br>   <br>  Como calcular<br>  Vejamos: O primeiro nome papal que foi usado depois que Pio VI foi levado cativo, morrendo no exílio, foi outro Pio... Isto significa que devemos incluir em nossa soma, o nome de todos os papas que usaram o nome “Pio”, mesmo o daqueles Pios que viveram antes de 1798, pois também fazem parte da monarquia dos Pios. <br>  Existiram 12 papas que usaram o nome “Pio”. E a soma do número do nome destes seria a seguinte: 1+2+3+4+5+6+7+8+9+10+11+12=78.<br>  O segundo nome usado desde 1798 foi Le?o. Existiram 13 papas que usaram este nome. Somemos: 1+2+3+4+5+6+7+8+9+10+11+12+13= 91. <br>  O terceiro nome papal usado desde 1798 foi Gregório. Houve 16 papas com este nome... Somemos: 1+2+3+4+5+6+7+8+9+10+11+12+13+14+15+16= 136.<br>  O quarto nome papal usado desde 1798 foi Benedito. Houve 14 Beneditos que somam: 1+2+3+4+5+6+7+8+9+10+11+12+13+14= 105.<br>  O quinto nome papal usado desde 1798 foi Jo?o. Houve apenas 21 papas que usaram este nome: 1+2+3+4+5+6+7+8+9+10+11+12+13+14+15+16+1... 231.<br>  [Obs. Embora tenha havido Jo?o XXII e Jo?o XXIII, nos registros do Vaticano constam apenas 21 papas com esse nome monárquico. Na seqüência oficial, saltaram Jo?o XVI e Jo?o XX. Assim, de fato, houve somente 21 papas "Jo?o". O papa Benedito X também n?o é considerado. Mas o cálculo é feito somando-se os valores da ordem correta dos papas, desconsiderando-se os números constantes nos títulos oficiais.] <br>  O sexto nome usado desde 1798 foi Paulo. Existiram 6 Paulos. Somemos: 1+2+3+4+5+6=21.<br>  E o sétimo nome usado desde 1798 é Jo?o Paulo. Só existiram 2 papas com este nome – Jo?o Paulo I e Jo?o Paulo II e, portanto a soma seria: 1+2=3.<br>  A soma total destes “7 nomes papais” desde 1798, ou seja, sete reis, como se descreve na Bíblia, dá o seguinte resultado:<br>  1.      Pío, total: 78 <br>  2.      Le?o, total: 91 <br>  3.      Gregorio, total: 136 <br>  4.      Benedito, total: 105 <br>  5.      Jo?o, total: 231 <br>  6.      Paulo, total: 21 <br>  7.      Jo?o Paulo total: 3 <br>  Vejamos: 78+91+136+105+231+21+3=665 com Jo?o Paulo II, o sétimo nome papal desde 1798.<br>   <br>  Um novo nome papal!<br>  ...S?o também sete reis: cinco já caíram; um existe; e o outro ainda n?o é vindo; e quando vier, deve permanecer pouco tempo. Apoc 17:10.<br>  Como vimos, Jo?o recebeu a vis?o representando o tempo do sexto rei (Paulo) pois foi dito: um existe...; significa dizer que representa o momento histórico do papa Paulo, o sexto nome usado desde 1798, já que cinco (nomes) já haviam caído naquele momento da vis?o. Os primeiros cinco nomes papais usados desde 1798, como vimos, foi Pio, Le?o, Gregório, Benedito e Jo?o. O anjo disse a Jo?o que estes cinco já caíram, significando que estes nomes n?o mais seriam usados depois de Paulo, o sexto nome papal desde 1798. Reafirmamos: Jo?o estava vivendo a sua vis?o na perspectiva histórica do sexto nome papal – um existe. E só houve um papa que desde 1798, usou este nome: Paulo VI. <br>  Por que Jo?o contempla a vis?o da posi??o de Paulo VI, o sexto nome papal desde 1798? Paulo VI, o sexto nome desde 1798, é conhecido na historia do Vaticano como o papa que iniciou o movimento Ecumênico para unir os protestantes com a Igreja Católica. Mais tarde veremos, em outro estudo, como os protestantes ir?o se unir aos católicos para “fazer guerra” ao povo de Deus, no final dos tempos.<br>  No momento em que Jo?o vê a vis?o, se diz que o sétimo nome papal desde 1798, ainda n?o havia vindo. Este nome que ainda n?o havia vindo era Jo?o Paulo, um nome nunca antes usado e toda a história papal. <br>  ...e quando vier, deve permanecer pouco tempo. Apoc 17:10. Todos sabemos que o nome Jo?o Paulo   que há permaneceu menos tempo no poder papal foi Jo?o Paulo I que durou apenas alguns dias e o  se sucessor, Jo?o Paulo II, está no poder há cerca de 25 anos (e tudo indica que está por pouco o seu pontificado).<br>  A besta que era e já n?o é, é também o oitavo rei, e é dos sete, e vai-se para a perdi??o. Apoc 17:11<br>  Foi dito a Jo?o que o oitavo nome papal desde 1798 proveria do mesmo poder que “era”, esse mesmo poder perseguidor que Jo?o vira matando aos santos. Diz-se da besta que “já n?o é” no momento em que ele está vendo a vis?o, haveria sete reis durante esta fase (do já n?o é) do poder papal. S?o, portanto, os sete nomes papais utilizados durante a segunda fase (após 1798) do papado.<br>  Vimos que com Jo?o Paulo II, o sétimo nome papal desde 1798, que a soma destes nomes totalizaram 665. Isto significa que só faltava um NOVO nome papal para completar o número 666! O oitavo nome papal desde 1798, deverá ser o sucessor de Jo?o Paulo II. (No caso Bento XVI)<br>  O próximo nome seria um novo nome papal nunca antes usado em toda a historia após 1798, o que 1 em nosso calculo do número 666. ESTE SERá O HOMEM 666!<br>   <br>  O Homem 666<br>  Este homem restabelecerá as persegui??es que existiram durante a idade média, em que milh?es de crist?o foram mortos pela chamada “santa inquisi??o”.<br>  Os dez chifres que viste s?o dez reis, os quais ainda n?o receberam o reino, mas receber?o autoridade, como reis, por uma hora, juntamente com a besta. Apoc 17:12. <br>  Aprendemos em Daniel 7 que os chifres s?o uma decorrência da besta que os possuem. Nesta passagem do Apocalipse temos um besta de cor escarlate que representa o Vaticano – o poder perseguidor dos 1260 anos – e que estes reis n?o s?o os mesmos de Daniel 7, já que aqueles n?o possuem reinos.<br>  Já que a besta do Apocalipse 17 representa o governo da Igreja Católica Romana, os dez chifres devem ser conseqüência dela, a igreja romana. E, as únicas decorrência desta igreja s?o as igrejas protestantes . Esta é, portanto, uma profecia sobre o mundo protestante (as filhas) que dever?o reconhecer o poder papal – ecumenismo – ao fim dos tempos.<br>  Estes combater?o contra o Cordeiro, e o Cordeiro os vencerá, porque é o Senhor dos senhores e o Rei dos reis; vencer?o também os que est?o com ele, os chamados, e eleitos, e fiéis. Apoc 17:14<br>  Estes 10 reis se unir?o ao poder papal para fazer guerra contra o povo de Deus (Apoc 14.12). Só se mencionam dois períodos de tempo em que esta guerra ocorre. O primeiro é o seguinte:<br>  Também lhe foi permitido fazer guerra aos santos, e vencê-los; e deu-se-lhe autoridade sobre toda tribo, e povo, e língua e na??o. Apoc 13:7<br>  E a segunda oportunidade é o que lemos: Estes combater?o contra o Cordeiro, e o Cordeiro os vencerá, porque é o Senhor dos senhores e o Rei dos reis; vencer?o também os que est?o com ele, os chamados, e eleitos, e fiéis. Apoc 17:14.<br>  Note que na guerra durante o período profético de 1260 anos. A besta vence aos santos, porém no Apocalipse 17, é o Cordeiro quem vence a besta...<br>  Disse-me ainda: As águas que viste, onde se assenta a prostituta, s?o povos, multid?es, na??es e línguas. Apoc 17:15<br>  Esta passagem nos diz que esta exercerá um controle sobre todos os povos do mundo.<br>  E os dez chifres que viste, e a besta, estes odiar?o a prostituta e a tornar?o desolada e nua, e comer?o as suas carnes, e a queimar?o no fogo. Apoc 17:16.<br>  Deus nos mostra a decep??o que gerará a prostituta; o mundo se dará conta que foi enganado e se  voltará contra ela. Esta é uma profecia sobre o povo matando aos líderes do erro e da decep??o; aqueles que s?o os causadores de sua perdi??o. Turbas furiosas cheias de ira, tal e qual ocorreram durante a revolu??o francesa, quando milhares de sacerdotes foram assassinados em suas casas...<br>  Porque Deus lhes p?s nos cora??es o executarem o intento dele, chegarem a um acordo, e entregarem à besta o seu reino, até que se cumpram as palavras de Deus. Apoc 17:17.<br>  O protestantismo apóstata (filhas) se uniu ao poder papal para fazer guerra contra o povo de Deus. Deus permitirá que creiam em seu erro até que ela mesma (a besta escarlata) mostre a sua apostasia (II Tes. 2:11). Porém será tarde demais... já estar?o perdidos, ent?o se arremetem cheios de ira contra estes líderes do erro e da decep??o.<br>   <br>   <br>  Havíamos mencionado antes que a besta se uniria com 10 reis para fazer guerra. Esta guerra se descreve no Apocalipse 13. Vamos à este capítulo.<br>  No Apocalipse 13, encontramos duas bestas: uma que saiu do mar com 7 cabe?as e 10 chifres e outra besta que surge da terra com dois chifres “como de cordeiro”. Historicamente, os protestantes interpretam que o chifre pequeno de Daniel 7 e a besta do Apocalipse 13 representam o poder (governo) papal. A Igreja Católica, porém protesta contra esta interpreta??o.<br>  Vemos em Apoc 13:5 que a besta que saiu do mar com 7 cabe?as e 10 chifres, reinaria por 1.260 anos proféticos. Esta diria grandes palavras contra o altíssimo e blasfemaria  contra Deus. E foi dado o poder por 42 meses, ou seja, os 1260 anos proféticos, que equivale dizer, o período compreendido entre o ano de 538 d.C. (o ano de ascens?o do primeiro papa) a 1798 d.C. (queda do papa Pio Vi e conseqüente perda do poder absoluto do papado).<br>  Se alguém leva em cativeiro, em cativeiro irá; se alguém matar à espada, necessário é que à espada seja morto. Aqui está a perseveran?a e a fé dos santos. Apoc 13:10 <br>  Chegou um momento na história em que a besta foi capturada e morta à espada pela guerra. Como vimos, em 1798, Pio VI foi capturado, morrendo a seguir no cativeiro francês. John Wesley, um reformador, fundador da Igreja Metodista, entendeu este conceito. Ele percebeu que o período profético dos 1260 dias entre os anos 538 a 1798, e em 1750 escreveu uma interpreta??o que dizia que este poder papal findaria em 1798. Também predisse a ascens?o de um novo poder do papado (restaura??o).<br>   <br>  Surge outra besta<br>  No verso seguinte, Jo?o, o revelador, descreve outra besta; uma com chifres de cordeiro que se “levanta da terra”. Veja:<br>  E vi subir da terra outra besta, e tinha dois chifres semelhantes aos de um cordeiro; e falava como drag?o. Apoc 13:11.<br>  Justamente depois que Pio VI foi capturado em 1798, Jo?o vê levantar-se outro poder, porém n?o do mar, mas da terra. A palavra grega traduzida como terra, nesta passagem, significa uma área deserta, n?o povoada. Sabemos que na Bíblia, o cordeiro representa a Cristo, e aqui vemos a descri??o de um poder que se levantaria por volta de 1798 em uma área n?o povoada do mundo e que seria crist?o (cordeiro) em sua natureza...<br>  Este poder n?o pode ser outro que os Estados Unidos da América do Norte! Aqui foi profetizado que este país, outrora baluarte da liberdade de consciência (civil), falará e legislará sob o domínio de Satanás. Já n?o est?o os Estados Unidos, falando como o drag?o? Saddam Hussein que o diga, n?o é?<br>  Também exercia toda a autoridade da primeira besta na sua presen?a; e fazia que a terra e os que nela habitavam adorassem a primeira besta, cuja ferida mortal fora curada. Apoc 13:12<br>  Os Estados Unidos se converter?o em um poder semelhante ao poder papal – perseguidor – (um sistema igreja/estado), tal qual foi o sistema papal na Europa. Prediz-se também que os Estados Unidos impor?o ao mundo a adora??o semelhante ao sistema papal. <br>  Esta besta tem chifres semelhantes a um cordeiro, o que vale dizer que é “crist?” nominalmente e imporá – por decreto – uma adora??o do tipo crist?o. Os Estados Unidos da América impor?o o primeiro dia da semana, o domingo, como o dia oficial de adora??o. Nesse momento, a ferida infligida ao poder papal em 1798 estará totalmente curada...<br>  Isto acontecerá durante o mandato do oitavo nome papal, desde 1798, o sucessor de Jo?o Paulo II, a quem muito bem sabemos estar por pouco dias (governando e mudando algumas coisas)... Pois o penúltimo papa se foi devido a sua idade avan?ada e sua saúde.<br>   <br>  Imposi??o do domingo<br>  E operava grandes sinais, de maneira que fazia até descer fogo do céu à terra, à vista dos homens; e, por meio dos sinais que lhe foi permitido fazer na presen?a da besta, enganava os que habitavam sobre a terra e lhes dizia que fizessem uma imagem à besta que recebera a ferida da espada e vivia. Apoc 13:13-14. <br>  Vemos aqui o mundo apóstata crist?o fazendo milagres procurando demonstrar que deus está com eles, quando na realidade é Satanás quem realiza esses milagres para enganar o mundo. Temos aprendido, através deste estudo, que o poder papal recobrará sua supremacia perdida quando os dez reis do Apocalipse 17 se unirem ao poder papal. Vimos também que o protestantismo apostatado dará a sua autoridade e poder ao papado para fazer guerra contra o povo de Deus. Aqui também se demonstra  que os Estados Unidos da América do Norte formar?o um sistema de igreja/estado (uni?o) em que o dinheiro público será usado para financiar as atividades religiosas (persegui??es) tais como se sucederam na Europa sob o poder papal. <br>  Note-se também que esta “imagem” da primeira besta (a papal, antes de 1798) fará com que o mundo adore a nova besta pós-1798. E isto incluirá a imposi??o do dia do domingo, indo de encontro ao sábado bíblico, como o dia de adora??o religiosa, mediante uma lei, a lei dominical...<br>  Foi-lhe concedido também dar f?lego à imagem da besta, para que a imagem da besta falasse, e fizesse que fossem mortos todos os que n?o adorassem a imagem da besta. Apoc 13:15<br>  Todos aqueles que se recusarem a adorar este falso sistema político-religioso, ser?o sentenciados à morte. Aqueles que se recusarem a obedecer a lei dominical ser?o assassinados sob o aval da lei deste sistema Igreja/estado.<br>  E fez que a todos, pequenos e grandes, ricos e pobres, livres e escravos, lhes fosse posto um sinal na m?o direita, ou na fronte, Apoc 13:16<br>  Em Apocalipse 14, Deus também coloca uma marca nas frontes de Seu povo. Esta marca é o chamado “selo de Deus”. Portanto, esta outra marca (da besta) é o oposto à marca ao selo que Deus coloca em Seu povo. Em Israel, o selo de Deus é sétimo dia da cria??o, o Sábado, um sinal entre Deus e o Seu povo. Note-se que a imagem que a besta obrigará a ser adorado, será um falso dia de repouso, o dia de domingo, já t?o aceito pelo mundo protestante, em desacordo com a Bíblia e em apoio ao pretenso poder legislador do papa.<br>  ...para que ninguém pudesse comprar ou vender, sen?o aquele que tivesse o sinal, ou o nome da besta, ou o número do seu nome. Apoc 13:17<br>  A Igreja Católica Romana afirma que, como sinal de sua autoridade, ela trocou o quarto mandamento da lei de Deus (êxo 20:3-17). Os papas modificaram o quarto mandamento, colocando o primeiro dia da semana, o domingo, em lugar do sétimo dia da cria??o, o Sábado, como dia de adora??o. Os papas mudaram a lei de Deus! Na página oficial do Vaticano, na Internet, no documento Dies Domini, podemos ler que Jo?o Paulo II deseja impor, mundialmente, a adora??o do domingo com puni??es para os “hereges”.<br>  Aqui há sabedoria. Aquele que tem entendimento, calcule o número da besta; porque é o número de um homem, e o seu número é seiscentos e sessenta e seis. Apoc 13:18<br>   <br>   <br>  Como pudemos ver neste estudo, o número 666 representa o último bispo de Roma (papa). Sob este oitavo nome papal desde 1798, reviverá a persegui??o e será aprovada a lei dominical. Com penalidades para quem n?o a cumprir. Estes enfrentar?o finalmente um decreto de morte. Quem viver, verá!<br>  Vamos ler agora Apoc 11:18 que diz: Iraram-se, na verdade, as na??es; ent?o veio a tua ira, e o tempo de serem julgados os mortos, e o tempo de dares recompensa aos teus servos, os profetas, e aos santos, e aos que temem o teu nome, a pequenos e a grandes, e o tempo de destruíres os que destroem a terra.<br>  Esta é uma descri??o da segunda vinda de Cristo para dar a recompensa aos Seus santos...<br>  Abriu-se o santuário de Deus que está no céu, e no seu santuário foi vista a arca do seu pacto; e houve relampagos, vozes e trov?es, e terremoto e grande saraivada. Apoc 11:19<br>  A Arca do Testemunho contém os Dez mandamentos. Deus mostrará a Sua Santa Lei no céu durante sua Segunda vinda a esta Terra (Mat 24:30). Todos levantaram para ver e contemplar o quarto mandamento: Lembra-te do dia do sábado, para o santificar. Seis dias trabalharás, e farás todo o teu trabalho; mas o sétimo dia é o sábado do Senhor teu Deus. Nesse dia n?o farás trabalho algum, nem tu, nem teu filho, nem tua filha, nem o teu servo, nem a tua serva, nem o teu animal, nem o estrangeiro que está dentro das tuas portas. Porque em seis dias fez o Senhor o céu e a terra, o mar e tudo o que neles há, e ao sétimo dia descansou; por isso o Senhor aben?oou o dia do sábado, e o santificou. êxo 20:8-11.<br>  Deus aben?oou o sétimo dia e o santificou. O Sétimo dia, o Sábado é o selo de Deus... O oposto é a marca da besta.|`|dd5327a1efbfe69407ace2bb59f4ef74aa	Sim. <br>  Que você está lendo 999 de cabe?a para baixo.|`|tJDYdbzdaa	quer dizer que o numero 6 nesse caso eh trigemeo..shauhsuahsu|`|puyIV9J6aa	Dizem que é o numero da besta.|`|2b62ef3c16db2518ad309086994d8474aa	os numeros romanos se escrevem do maior para o menor.<br>  <br>  e s?o eles (apenas os primários)<br>  <br>  I V X L C D (na época da bíblia, o no mil era grande d+ e pouco conhecido...<br>  <br>  logo, se colocados na ordem decrescente...<br>  <br>  DCLXVI (que eh 666)...<br>  <br>  na bíblia diz que esse é o número do homem, é preciso calcular, pois é o número da besta...|`|de23a20bb28332a29d4d9540fea2dd7faa	zaan<br>  <br>  Indica o nome de um homem que é a Besta Apocaliptica.<br>  <br>  Porém, verdadeiramente n?o se refere a um só homem, mas  sim a uma dinastia de homens.<br>  <br>  Todos eles sustentam três títulos, a saber:<br>  <br>  VICARIVS FILII DEI<br>  <br>  VICARIVS GENERALIS DEI IN TERRIS<br>  <br>  DVX  CLERI<br>  <br>  Somando-se isoladamente cada um dos números romanos contidos em cada título, obtemos o número 666.<br>  <br>  No nome, que designa SATANáS, em grego, que é TEITAN, encontramos também o número apocaliptico 666.

Deste modo, o autor de Apocalipse, S?o Jo?o Evangelista, estaria associando o uso da marca da Besta a uma forma de escraviza??o desta Besta.<br>  <br>  No sistema de numera??o romano, os números s?o compostos por múltiplos de 1 e 5, que perfazem 6, nas unidades, dezenas e centenas. Assim, a marca do império romano provém da simples utiliza??o dos números I, V, X, L, C e D; respectivamente 1 + 5 + 10 + 50 + 100 + 500 (666), dando origem a uma série de supersti??es.<br>  <br>  <br>  Segundo as Sagradas Escrituras surgirá um líder que governará o mundo por 7 anos. Revolucionará a economia e a política mundial através do seu governo. Influenciará de tal forma a humanidade que todos que o aceitarem ser?o marcados com um número: o 666 (Apocalipse 13:16–18 ). O livro de Apocalipse o chama de Anti-Cristo. Uma das maiores justificativas para seu número ser o 666 é a seguinte:<br>  <br>  6 é o número do homem porque ele foi criado no sexto dia por Deus; <br>  3 é o número de Deus porque Ele é uma Trindade (Pai, Filho e Espírito Santo). <br>  Logo, como 666 é o número seis repetido três vezes pode-se dizer que o Anti-Cristo será um homem (o seis como número do homem) que desejará e se declarará Deus (representado pelo número de três vezes que o seis é repetido).<br>  De acordo com as ramifica??es do Cristianismo há diversas interpreta??es sobre o significado do número.<br>  <br>  Diversos ramos defendem que 666 se relacione ao nome ou título de uma pessoa específica.<br>  <br>  Alguns textos católicos e historiadores defendem que 666 se relacione com Nero César, imperador romano sob a qual o apóstolo Jo?o teria sido exilado. Esta cren?a é baseada no seguinte argumento:<br>  <br>  Nero César (em hebraico ???? ???, Nrwn Qsr "Neron Qesar") assume o seguinte valor no alfabeto hebraico:<br>  <br>                 r    s    q     n   w    r    n <br>         666 = 200 + 60 + 100 + 50 + 6 + 200 + 50<br>  Outra vers?o para o nome de Nero ??? ???, Nrw Qsr (que é a forma latina):<br>  <br>                 r    s    q    w    r    n <br>         616 = 200 + 60 + 100 + 6 + 200 + 50<br>  Ramifica??es evangélicas vêem o valor de 666 associado ao papado, que ostenta em sua tiara VICARIUS FILLIS DEI que equivaleria a 666.<br>  <br>  De acordo com os ebionitas, em hebraico escrevemos 666 com as consoantes T-R-S-W ou TARSO. A tradi??o ebionita defende que 666 designa Paulo de Tarso, que para eles é o responsável pelo surgimento da idolatria crist?.<br>  <br>  Na atualidade, muitos levantam a tese de que o número da besta poderá estar associado ao código de barras ou à tecnologia de chip que seriam implantados nos seres humanos por medidas de seguran?a e controle governamental. Os defensores dessa tese sup?em que haveria o desaparecimento da moeda e que as pessoas para poder comprar ou vender precisar?o ter acesso ao comércio eletr?nico através de uma marca implantada em seus próprios corpos.<br>  <br>  Eu acredito, é a mais pura verdade... e aquele chip q fizeram para identificar onde está a pessoa é o inicio do fim dos tempos, esse chip é para o anticristo rastrear a pessoa...<br>  <br>  SAIBA MAIS SOBRE ESSE ASSUNTO EM:<br>  <br>  <br>  VALE A PENA CONFERIR!!!|`|d90bacd4b19357bfb00699e5740d006daa	Crendices é coisa de povo ingênuo e ignorante.

Y uno de los primeros presidentes estadounidenses, Thomas Jefferson, dijo: “La razón y el libre examen son las únicas armas eficaces contra el error.?[...] Son los enemigos naturales del error”. Si buscamos de corazón la verdad, ‘ponderaremos y evaluaremos’, y recurriremos a “la razón y el libre examen”.<br>  <br>  Sir Hermann Bondi, científico británico, se?aló por qué es esencial tal actitud: “Puesto que no?puede haber más que un solo credo verdadero, se deduce que los seres humanos son muy dados a aceptar de buena fe y a pies juntillas las falsedades en el campo de la religión revelada. Cabría esperar que este hecho obvio nos hubiera inducido a tener cierta humildad y a pensar un poco en que, no?importa lo profunda que sea nuestra fe, es concebible que estemos equivocados”.<br>  <br>  Entonces, ?cómo podemos determinar si andamos en ‘el camino estrecho que conduce a la vida’? Jesús ense?ó que hay que adorar a Dios “con verdad”. Por ello, la razón dicta que si hay dos doctrinas opuestas entre sí, no?es posible que ambas sean ciertas. Por ejemplo: o el ser humano tiene un alma que sobrevive a la muerte, o?no. O Dios va a intervenir en los asuntos humanos, o?no. O Dios es una Trinidad, o?no. Quienes buscan la verdad desean respuestas objetivas a estas cuestiones trascendentales. Los testigos de Jehová creen que Dios nos las proporciona en su Palabra, la Biblia.<br>  <br>  Puesto que “toda Escritura es inspirada de Dios”, la mejor manera de examinar la validez de una determinada ense?anza es compararla con lo que dice la Biblia (2?Timoteo 3:16). Si así lo hace, usted ‘probará para sí mismo lo que es la buena y la acepta y la perfecta voluntad de Dios’ (Romanos 12:2). ?Puede ‘probarse a sí mismo’ que sus convicciones se fundan en la Biblia? Es importante poder hacerlo, pues Dios no?desea que usted sea extraviado junto con “toda la tierra habitada” (Revelación [Apocalipsis] 12:9).|`|XwuKQIHiaa	La religiones el problema de la frase que usaste.. porque todos se fijan en las religiones en la iglesia, y no se centra en la relacion de Dios con el hombre.. veras igual que todo cuando el hombre dirige algo, obviamente nunca se pone deacuerdo con nadie..<br>  asique no es que la religion nos ense?a que esta bien no entender la vida.. sino que Dios nos explica que debes buscarlo a el y todo lo demas se te a?adira..|`|a4840562850e1b87ef6c12e17a99d706aa	Esta respuesta es exclusiva, para despertar el intelecto, pura metanoia, para mi amiga Sol...<br>  TEMA: PECADO ORIGINAL<br>  Quiero ayudarte a buscar la verdad, esto que te diré dificilmente te lo diga otra persona.<br>  Te contaré una historia bíblica de Genesis c2 y te la narraré según mi particular punto de vista, de manera de desmitificarla y ponerla en téminos entendibles para nuestra cultura, ok?. Sucede que Adan y Eva recibieron la vida para trabajar en Edén (como siervos o sea mano de obra barata, por la comida, ni siquiera ropa les daban), donde habia mucha riqueza, especialmente mineral y era un lugar idóneo para la explotación de estas riquezas porque estaba rodeado de rios lo que permitia eliminar lo desechos sin problemas ecológicos. Los adanes debian trabajar para extraer piedras preciosas, oro de muy buena calidad y ?piedras de fuego! ?uranio??carbón mineral?. Cuando Satán le hace notar a los adanes que no necesitan de Jehová para enviar y vender estas riquezas a toda la creación, sinó simplemente asociarse con el mismo Satán y los insta a apoderarse de la ciencia y tecnologia necesaria (el árbol del conocimiento del bien y del mal). Los adanes impulsados por sus mujeres profanan estas instalaciones (pecado original) y descubren la verdad, el negocio de su amo y su socio Satán. Esto provoca la ruptura entre Jehová y los adanes y también con Satán ( en Ezequiel al príncipe de Tiro o sea Satanás: la multitud de tus contratos y ventas envaneció tu corazón y pecaste) o sea traicionó a su socio por ambición. En definitiva los adanes por su transgresión (pecado original) son expulsados de Edén, no sin antes recibir algunos implantes genéticos como el gen del envejecimiento prematuro (consecuencia del pecado original), y a sus puertas se disponen un sistema de detección de la presencia de seres vivos (un ojo que gira y mira hacia todos lados) y dos dispositivos (querubines) que lanzan rayos mortíferos sobre quién supere los limites permitidos por Jehová. <br>  Resulta obvio que quién generó la posibilidad de existencia de nuestra raza humana lo hizo con un potencial bien distinto a la biología que dispone nuestro organismo hoy día. Nuestro material genético fué alterado y mutilado para castigar la supuesta traición y por temor a que el hombre pudiera apoderarse también de los conocimientos necesarios para prolongar su vida indefinidamente (Arbol de la Vida).<br>  Es una obviedad decir que este da?o que hemos heredado lo recibimos de la única manera que se puede heredar un castigo sobre una especie, a traves de su ADN, por ello se hereda de generación en generación y no se puede revertir por la aplicación de agua sobre nuestra cabeza. No es esta la promesa que nos deja la escritura, sinó que nos será restaurado un cuerpo diferente al que tenemos y mas parecido al de los adanes (cuerpo glorioso) y que seremos integrados a un orden cósmico mas justo y equitativo del que tenemos en esta planeta. Cual es la condición de acceso? creer que esto es así y aceptar formar parte de una comunidad muy diferente a la que estamos acostumbrados (el Reino de lo Cielos), preparandonos bajo sus reglas y principios, condiciones que apuntan decididamente a nuestra formación espiritual .

La religión hace personas conformistas, autosatisfechas y que agradecen al dios, lo mismo si manda calamidades para "purificar el alma, castigar o reprender" que si "manda" peque?os regalos para agradecer que seamos sus "hijos".<br>  <br>  La religión no nos ense?a a estar satisfecho con nuestra ignorancia del mundo, sino que es una creación cultural que en un principio tuvo la finalidad contraria, es decir; los primeros dioses trataban de explicar la existencia del universo, de la naturaleza y del hombre en términos aceptados como lógicos por las sociedades primitivas.  <br>  <br>  Conforme avanza la humanidad, los dioses dejan de cumplir una función meramente "explicativa" y  bajan a la tierra a convivir con los humanos y a darles una legislación. Esto respondía muy bien a las necesidades de una sociedad en donde los sacerdotes empezaban a tener preeminencia en la toma de desiciones.  Cuando la religión aborda temas morales,  filosóficos, jurídicos y políticos, crea un dios o dioses que sirven de banderas a los pueblos: las guerras sirven para prestar servicio sagrado, lo mismo en Roma que en Israel o Egipto.

DIOS no tiene por que perdonarte, por ejemplo. Si te perdona significa que estuvo un tiempo enojado contigo (enojo=actitud humana).<br>  <br>  Si DIOS (entiendase DIOS como lo infinito) es perfecto e infinito, lo es porque no varia su esencia (es decir, es inmutable, no se enoja y se arrepiente de sus enojos, como los humanos). El es infinito porque es el poder supremo, la sabiduria eterna, la inteligencia activa, la belleza espiritual, la justicia eterna, la misericordia infinita, la victoria eterna sobre el bien, la eternidad del bien y la fecundidad de ese bien.<br>  <br>  Lo que algunas Iglesias nos hacen creer son las sombras de esos principios, las cuales son el despotismo o absolutismo del poder, la fe ciega, el dogma que se pretende inmutable y que es fatalmente progresivo, la venganza divina, el sacrificio voluntario, abnegacion y despojo voluntario, el infierno eterno y el celibato y la esterilidad.<br>  <br>  Simplemente por el hecho de ser infinito y eterno implica que en virtud de su infinita misericordia no guardara rencor humano contra ti, pero como es eternamente justo impartira esa justicia eterna. No es que se enoje con una persona, por ejemplo.|`|a14c497f259e212762edecb5af3a805eaa	A un verdadero creyente no sólo le lavan el cerebro, lo lavan todo, manos, pies, mente, corazón y esto solo lo hace la sangre de Jesucristo y ninguna religión lo puede hacer. Y estas en un error, esto no es un proceso que lleva mucho tiempo, Dios lo hace en un instante, soy testigo de ello. Y no olvides que la misericordia de Dios es solo para lo que le temen, y los que le temen se apartan de sus maldades para no volver a hacerlas.  No te quito tu ilusión, pero solo estás emocionado, cosa que no va a durar mucho, necesitas ser serio y tomar decisiones serias y radicales en cuanto a dejar tus pecados y buscar que Jesús te de una nueva vida, (lo que él llamó un nuevo nacimiento) Es decir ser una persona totalmente libre de tus pecados y con una manera distinta de ver la vida, en donde la diferencia reside en que ya no eres egoísta sino alguien que ama incondicionalmente.

In a city of 18 million, it is wildly improbable that the handful of Jews there were chosen at random.<br>  <br>  Despite the religious declaration of the surviving gunman and the claims of responsibility for the violence by the Mujahideen, giving credit to Allah, the New York Times predictably refused to call the mass murder spree an act of Islamic terror.  The BBC even took it a step further by actually declining to label the gunmen as terrorists (stopping just short of calling them community activists, apparently).  <br>  <br>  Clearing Islam of blame in circumstances such as these is certainly the stuff of which Dhimwits are made.

An increasing number of networks and newspapers have religion reporters or advisers. However, since its main drivers (market share and maximization of profits) are media coverage, it is "predestined" to be unbalanced or biased.<br>  <br>  The emphasis on "headline events" often means a predominant focus on the negative, sensational, violent. The "dark side" of religion predominates over coverage of religions more transcendent and transformative aspects. This is reflected across the religious spectrum. Mainstream evangelicals are eclipsed by the preferential coverage given to more militant and strident evangelicals like Pat Robertson who can be counted on for provocative sound bites. Warith Deen Muhammad, leader of the majority of African American Muslims has often been eclipsed by the more combative Louis Farrakhan. Much needed coverage of the pedophilia problems of the Catholic Church were rarely complimented by stories that also show the faith that informs the lives of most Catholics. <br>  <br>  Most glaringly in recent years, Islam and Muslims have come to be viewed primarily through the lens of religious extremism and terrorism. Media tend to focus disproportionately on this dangerous and deadly minority who threaten global security and offer minimal coverage of the faith and lives of the mainstream majority of Muslims. Prominent media commentators use Islamophobic (anti-Muslim) language and make outrageous unsubstantiated charges that responsible editors allow regarding Judaism and Christianity. There is a growing propensity in the media in the name of balanced coverage of Islam and Muslims to have a "counter voice" on virtually any story. Especially favored are ex-Muslims, those who publicly repudiate Islam and like some prominent non-Muslim ideologues do not distinguish (as they would when talking about other faiths) between mainstream Islam and religious extremism but rather see the religion of Islam itself as inherently flawed and dangerous. <br>  <br>  "Balance" has come to mean that any discussion of Islam and Muslims include someone who is a "militant critic." Yet, we don't expect that every discussion of religion include an atheist, that every discussion of the meaning of Passover or Easter include someone who will deny the historicity or relevance of these beliefs and rituals, that every panel on some aspect of Jewish or Christian faith and belief include "critics" with preference given to those who have rejected the faith and are often not experts as much as "professional critics," that is, make a career of slamming their former faith. While criticism and dissent are important and must be heard, they are not necessary or relevant to every story or report. <br>  Most glaringly in recent years, Islam and Muslims have come to be viewed primarily through the lens of religious extremism and terrorism. Media tend to focus disproportionately on this dangerous and deadly minority who threaten global security and offer minimal coverage of the faith and lives of the mainstream majority of Muslims.<br>  <br>  Notably absent in the mainstream media is coverage of Islam and Muslims is coverage of the erosion of civil liberties. While stories on global terrorism and domestic threats are important to us all, at the same time how many stories have gone one step further and focused on the thousands of Muslims indiscriminately arrested, detained, monitored and interviewed and not found guilt or released for lack of evidence; the number of Islamic charities shut down but despite the passage of years not successfully prosecuted; the continued detention of Muslims like Prof. Sami al-Arian, whose jury verdict as well as the post-trial agreement forged by Justice Department and Defense attorneys were ignored by the trial judge. <br>  <br>  Since 9/11, I am constantly asked (or the charge is made): "Why don?t Muslims in America and globally speak out against religious violence and terrorism?" To which my response is that the absence of such statements is either due to the fact that Muslims do not speak out or that, as is the case, the media too often does not find these stories "newsworthy." I then refer them to internet sites like Beliefnet and others where these statements may be found. <br>  <br>  Inadequate media coverage is compounded by the fact that many, though certainly not all, reporters come to stories with little or no background on religions and the very topics they cover. This was a major reason why after 9/11, I wrote the book, What Everyone Needs to Know About Islam.<br>  <br>  Is there more media coverage of religion today than in the past? Yes. Are there reporters and stories that make an important contribution to better understanding? Yes. However, are there serious and substantial problems resulting in a dangerous bias in the coverage provided by many media outlets? Most assuredly, Yes. We still have a long way to go in a world in which in many societies, religion has become a more pronounced presence|`|EXurNsB4aa	Umm I'm not a fan of Islam or anything but US media creates a negative racially based image connected to Islam that I'm not fond of.|`|Qyue0Ykgaa	They need an independent regulatory body! instead of Regulating themselves.

En la edición de la revista La Atalaya del 1o de junio de 1982, (en inglés, 1o  de  diciembre de 1981) el enfoque que se indicó fue que ciertos errores que la Sociedad había cometido en el pasado realmente no eran errores en lo absoluto sino que se deben considerar como dar “pasos” hacia un entendimiento apropiado.  Que al ense?ar estos errores en el pasado, la Sociedad iban a navegar “voltejear” hacia la verdad.  <br>  <br>   <br>  <br>  Uno de los ejemplos explícitamente mencionados en esa Atalaya fue los cambios en la comprensión de Romanos 13:1-7. Se afirman que: “Al principio los Estudiantes de la Biblia entendían correctamente que las “potestades superiores,” o “autoridades superiores”, eran los gobernantes de este mundo.”1   Pero su punto de vista tuvo un punto débil, que la Sociedad lo contiende ahora. Basándose en esa visión: “llegaron a la conclusión de que si a un cristiano se le reclutaba en tiempo de guerra, tendría que servir en el ejército, ponerse el uniforme y salir a la batalla.”2   Rectificando ahora esta obvia equivocación, el más reciente artículo de La Atalaya dice: “Por un tiempo los del pueblo de Dios se apegaron a ese punto de vista.”3  Este cambio vino en el 1929 4 y fue, lo que ahora La Atalaya reclama para beneficio de los Testigos: “durante los dificultosos a?os de la II Guerra mundial”. 5  Sin embargo en 1962, hubo una ambivalencia en cuanto a eso que se pensaba, y se volvió al punto de vista sostenido antes del 1929.  Una vez más las  “autoridades superiores” volvieron a identificarse como “los gobernantes de este mundo”.  La Sociedad enfáticamente manifestó, qué lo sucedió fue, que un nuevo elemento se le había agregado a la comprensión original, y este nuevo elemento hacía equivocada la posición que se sostuvo entre el 1929 y 1962 lo que fue en ese entonces parte del “entendimiento progresivo”. <br>  <br>   <br>  <br>  La doctrina presente de la Watch Tower ense?a que a diferencia de los primeros Estudiantes de la Biblia, los Testigos de Jehová comprenden que someterse a los gobernantes mundanos tiene un limite: <br>  <br>  <br>  Felizmente, en el a?o 1962, Jehová condujo a su pueblo a un entendimiento del principio de la sujeción relativa. Se pudo ver que los cristianos dedicados tienen que obedecer a los gobernantes seglares como las “autoridades superiores,” y reconocer de buena gana que éstos son “ministros de Dios,” o siervos de Dios, para beneficio de ellos. (Romanos 13:4) No obstante, si estas “autoridades” les pidieran que violaran las leyes de Dios, ?qué harían los cristianos entonces? Hasta ese punto los cristianos han obedecido el mandato registrado en Romanos 13:1: “Toda alma esté en sujeción a las autoridades superiores.” Pero dicha sujeción está limitada por lo que Jesús dijo, según está registrado en Mateo 22:21: “Paguen de vuelta a César las cosas de César, pero a Dios las cosas de Dios.” Por eso, cuando “César” pide a los cristianos que hagan cosas que son contrarias a la voluntad de Dios, ellos tienen que poner la ley de Jehová antes que la de “César.” 6<br>  <br>   <br>  <br>  La reclamación del gradual entendimiento progresivo de Romanos 13 se se?alo más específicamente en 1973: <br>  <br>  <br>  Por otra parte, puesto que Romanos 13:1 se había interpretado con el significado de que a los gobiernos del mundo tenía que dárseles obediencia incondicional, los Testigos interpretaron que las “autoridades superiores” mencionadas allí aplicaban a Jehová Dios y Jesucristo. Sin embargo, un examen más cuidadoso del contexto reveló que Romanos 13:1 realmente se refiere a los gobiernos políticos de este mundo. Pero al comparar este texto con otros, como Hechos 5:29, que declara: “Tenemos que obedecer a Dios como gobernante más bien que a los hombres,” se discernió que la “sujeción” que se menciona en Romanos 13:1 tiene que ser una sujeción relativa, no incondicional. Es decir, los cristianos han de estar en sujeción a los gobiernos de este mundo mientras éstos no pidan que los cristianos obren de modo contrario a las leyes de Dios. 7<br>  <br>   <br>  <br>  Todo esto suena bastante razonable, esto hasta que los hechos sólidos son considerados. Lamentablemente, la presentación de la Watchtower de este asunto no es históricamente correcta. Mientras es cierto que los primeros Estudiantes de la Biblia “entendían correctamente” que las “potestades superiores” en Romanos 13:1 “eran los gobernantes de este mundo”,  no es cierto que ellos sostenían que a estos gobernantes deberían dárseles completa obediencia y por consiguiente el punto de vista de ellos necesitó corregirse.  No es cierto que los Testigos modernos han llegado a un entendimiento sobre las “autoridades superiores” que los primeros Estudiantes de la Biblia no conocían.  De hecho la “sujeción relativa” a los gobernantes mundanos no es una nueva ense?anza en la comunidad de los Testigos como la Sociedad Watch Tower nos quiere hacer creer.  Sin embargo las implicaciones de los sucesos debido a que no hubo justificación alguna para el cambio de doctrina que la Sociedad llevó a cabo en 1929 son tan grandes que se hace fácil ver por qué los líderes de la Watch Tower suprimen la verdad hoy en día. <br>  <br>   <br>  <br>  Permítanos examinar los hechos. Charles Taze Russell, el renombrado fundador y primer presidente de la Sociedad Watch Tower, claramente y de forma consistente ense?ó que la sujeción a las “autoridades superiores” debería ser relativa. En el Volumen I de Estudios en las Escrituras {El Pan Divino de las Edades}(1921 edición espa?ola,), Russell explicó cómo Jesús y los apóstoles se sentían sobre el asunto, al tiempo en el cual mostraba cual era la posición cristiana. él afirmó: <br>  <br>  <br>  Todos ellos ense?aron a la Iglesia a obedecer las leyes y a respetar a los que se encontraban ejerciendo autoridad, a causa de su oficio, aun cuando personalmente no fueran dignos de estima; ense?aron que se pagaran las contribuciones, y que no se opusiera ninguna resistencia a las leyes establecidas, excepto cuando estuvieran en pugna con las leyes divinas.  (Hech. 4:19; 5:29;  Rom. 13:1-7; Mat. 22:21).  8<br>  <br>   <br>  <br>  Siendo que los Estudios en las Escrituras era una norma dentro de la comunidad de los Estudiantes de la Biblia, los puntos de vista que contenían pueden tomarse como la representación de todo el movimiento. Que ellos entendieron la sujeción relativa a las “autoridades superiores” se hace aún más evidente en el artículo titulado: “Es Menester Obedecer a Dios Antes Que a los Hombres” como fue publicado en la revista The Watch Tower [La Atalaya en inglés] del 15 de enero de 1916. Russell, el editor de la revista The Watch Tower y autor del artículo en cuestión, afirmó: <br>  <br>   <br>  <br>  La Biblia dirige a los seguidores de Jesús a estar en sujeción a las potestades. (Romanos 13:1-7; 1a Pedro 2:13-17) Pero mientras se busca obedecer en todo respecto las leyes, los cristianos deben reconocer que hay todavía una ley superior y todavía una autoridad superior, y deben estar en sujeción a los poderes mundanos sólo bajo la ausencia de una advertencia contraria por la autoridad superior - de Dios. 9<br>  <br>   <br>  <br>  De modo que los primeros Estudiantes de la Biblia entendieron “el principio de la sujeción relativa” tan bien como la entienden los Testigos de Jehová desde el 1962. Cuando la Sociedad se revirtió a la posición original sostenida antes del 1929, ellos ciertamente no habían estado “voltejeando” para buscar el punto de vista correcto como ellos oficialmente ahora reclaman. Los hechos que en verdad sucedieron fue que en 1929 sus líderes rechazaron la correcta exégesis de Romanos 13 a favor de un totalmente falso e innecesario punto de vista.<br>  <br>   <br>  <br>  En el 1962 ellos retornaron al entendimiento completamente correcto original del asunto. Pero, para no perturbar a los miembros en sus filas que eran inteligentes, la Sociedad astutamente se inventó el cuento de que ellos habían llegado a un entendimiento más completo del que tenían los primeros Estudiantes de la Biblia. Así el punto de vista incorrecto que fue publicado en el 1929 podría justificarse como dar un “paso” en la dirección correcta.  ?No obstante, como hemos visto, sencillamente ésta explicación no sustenta la verdad!<br>  <br>   <br>  <br>  ?Pero no es verdad que los primeros Estudiantes de la Biblia, cuándo fueron reclutados en tiempo de guerra, realmente utilizaron a Romanos 13 para excusarse de servir en el ejército? Aún cuando eso fuera así, no les excusaría rechazar la exégesis correcta de Romanos 13 que se sostuvo oficialmente por la comunidad de los Estudiantes de la Biblia. Si algunos fueron a la guerra, eso no podría culpársele a la interpretación oficial de Romanos 13 por la Watch Tower, qué claramente declaró que la ley de Dios era superior a la del hombre y por consiguiente, la sujeción a los poderes mundanos, tenía sus límites. La perspectiva de los primeros Estudiantes de la Biblia sobre Romanos 13 no era más responsable por el hecho que algunos Estudiantes de la Biblia participaron en la guerra, entonces se trata del punto de vista después del 1962 el hecho que esporádicamente un Testigo se une al ejercito. <br>  <br>   <br>  <br>  En el 1904, Charles T. Russell aconsejó a los cristianos que si ellos fueran obligados a “servir en las líneas” y disparar sus armas, ellos “no necesitaban sentirse obligados a dispararle a su prójimo”.10  Sin embargo luego él tomó una posición más firme contra el servicio militar. En la revista The Watch Tower del 1o de septiembre de 1915, [La Atalaya en inglés] él publicó un artículo de dos páginas titulado: “Christian Duty and the War” (Deber cristiano y la Guerra) del cual se cita lo siguiente: <br>  <br>  <br>  En los ESTUDIOS de las ESCRITURA, Vol. VI., hemos presentado una sugerencia que los seguidores de Cristo deben buscar todos los medios apropiado para evitar participar en la guerra. Allí nosotros sugerimos la posibilidad, que en caso de ser reclutados los seguidores del Se?or deben usar todas sus influencias para obtener posiciones en los cuerpos de Hospitales o en el Departamento de Provisión del ejército, en lugar de ir a combatir. Sugerimos además que si fuera imposible evitar ir a las trincheras, todavía no sería necesario violar el requisito divino, “No matarás”.  <br>  <br>   <br>  <br>  Nos hemos preguntado desde entonces, si el curso que hemos sugerido es el mejor. Nos preguntamos si tal curso no significaría transigir.  Reflejamos que para volverse un miembro del ejército y ponerse un uniforme militar implica asumir los deberes y obligaciones de un soldado como se reconocen y se aceptan. Una protesta hecha ante un oficial sería insignificante – ya que el público en general no sabrían nada de ella. ?Un cristiano realmente no estaría fuera de su lugar bajo tales condiciones? <br>  <br>   <br>  <br>  “Pero”, alguien contesta: “Si uno rehusara usar el uniforme y el servicio militar a él se le dispararía”.  Le respondemos que si la presentación fuera propiamente hecha podría haber alguna clase de exoneración; pero si no, ?no sería eso peor que le disparen a uno debido a la lealtad al Príncipe de Paz y rehusarse a desobedecer su orden a que le disparen a uno bajo el estandarte de estos reyes terrenales y al parecer dándoles apoyo y, bajo la apariencia por lo menos, de transigir las ense?anzas de nuestro Rey celestial? De las dos muertes preferiríamos la anterior – preferimos morir debido a la fidelidad a nuestro Rey celestial. 11    <br>   <br>  <br>  Refiriéndose a la firme posición que ahora él recomienda, Russell en conclusión expresó lo siguiente:   <br>  <br>   <br>  <br>  No estamos insistiendo en este curso. Nosotros meramente lo estamos sugiriendo. La responsabilidad le pertenece totalmente a cada individuo. Nosotros estamos descargando nuestra responsabilidad hacia muchos Estudiantes de la Biblia que están inquiriendo de nosotros respecto al sentir del Se?or sobre este asunto.  Previamente le expresamos nuestras mejores consideraciones, pero ahora tememos que fuéramos demasiado conservadores. 12 <br>  <br>   <br>  <br>  éste fue el punto de vista maduro de Russell que él nunca dejó. él claramente logró ver que la participación en la guerra era incompatible con la cristiandad. Reconociendo que la sujeción a “las potestades” era relativa, él no vio ningún problema en los textos de la Biblia que hablan de la obediencia a los gobernantes terrenales. Su última exposición del asunto admirablemente demuestra esto. En la revista The Watch Tower, (La Atalaya en inglés) del 15 de julio de 1916, él escribió lo siguiente en el artículo: “Militarism and Conscience”  [“Militarismo y Conciencia”]:<br>  <br>  Mientras a los cristianos se les ordena a estar en sujeción con “las potestades” —los reyes, gobernadores, magistrados, etc.— no obstante esto no se entenderá como que significa renunciar de nuestra fidelidad al Rey de reyes y Se?or de se?ores. él es nuestro Soberano Se?or. Nuestra obediencia a los se?ores terrenales, poderes y sus órdenes está meramente dentro del espacio donde ellos no entren en conflicto con las órdenes de nuestro Soberano Se?or.  Los judíos renunciando a Jesús manifestaron, “?No tenemos ningún rey sino a César!” La posición del cristiano es, “dad á César lo que es de César; y lo que es de Dios, á Dios.”  Siempre que César y sus leyes entren en conflicto con los requisitos divinos, a todo verdadero soldado de la cruz no le quedará otra alternativa. 13<br>  <br>    <br>  <br>  De modo que no hay manera alguna que los líderes de la Watch Tower puedan utilizar la postura de los primeros Estudiantes de la Biblia como excusa para sus posteriores puntos de vistas erróneos sobre Romanos 13.  La comprensión de éstos Estudiantes de la Biblia era suficientemente adecuada y no necesitaba ningún cambio. Las razones reales para éste cambio innecesario en el 1929 nunca se ha explicado por la Sociedad. Aquí es suficiente decir que la Sociedad en el 1929 estaba “voltejeando” en rumbo contrario a la verdad, y no hacia ella.   La desorientación que este cambio causó no pasó reservadamente sino que estuvo acompa?ada por una fuerte condenación fastidiosa contra todos esos reconocidos cristianos que se negaron a ser enga?ados sobre éste asunto. Todos esto no podrá sino traer graves consecuencias para la Sociedad Watch Tower.|`|95e32930374b5709667c4f431ade26ffaa	Apoyaría las guerras, solo si mandan a todos loa maras salvatruchas, que ellos son los que deben de ir a la guerra.|`|9d1834dab3333280486699bf95a7892aaa	En esos casos los muy hipócritas se les olvida el NO MATARAS como quien olvida cualquier cosa.

Tenemos que admitir que podrían haber tendencias heredas, lo cual no hace que en algunos individuos la homosexualidad sea "involuntaria". En estos momentos, no existe prueba para apoyar esa conclusión, pero en casos específicos, no podemos descartar esa posibilidad. <br>  <br>  La homosexualidad también puede resultar de la presencia o ausencia de "degeneraciones" hormonales que típicamente ocurren antes del nacimiento. <br>  <br>  Es más probable que lo que muchos llaman "tendencias heredadas" estén relacionadas con uno o más de los siguientes factores:  <br>  <br>  1- Confusión de papeles en los padres, incluyendo, pero sin limitar, el dominio de la madre y la debilidad o la ausencia del padre. Madres que son el "hombre" de la casa o padres que no pasan tiempo suficiente con sus hijos, donde el hijo o la hija ve claramente definido el papel del padre y de la madre en el hogar. <br>  <br>  2- Seria disfunción de familia que hiere y da?a al ni?o. Discuciones constantes, maltrato físico entre los padres o hacia los hijos, infidelidad matrimonial, divorcio, etc. <br>  <br>  3- Abuso sexual a temprana edad. <br>  <br>  4- La influencia de un homosexual mayor de edad durante el período critico de la adolescencia. <br>  <br>  5- Una experimentación homosexual, tal como la masturbación por parte de otro chico del mismo sexo, o por el uso de métodos "autoplacenteros", así como la introducción de objetos por el ano, etc., a temprana edad en la adolescencia. <br>  <br>  ?Cómo éstas y otras influencias interactúan en circunstancias individuales? <br>  <br>  No sé, y creo que nadie sabe. En cambio estoy seguro que la homosexualidad no resulta de influencias irresistibles genéticas, como algunos creen. Primero, si esto ciertamente fuera un rasgo genético, entonces todos los gemelos idénticos o fueran ambos homosexuales o fueran ambos normales. Sus genes son exactamente idénticos, por tanto todo lo derivado específicamente de su DNA expresaría con certeza su individualidad. Pero la realidad indica que en estos casos, como uno de los dos gemelos es homosexual y el otro es normal, el que es homosexual decidió ser homosexual y el que es normal decidió no ser homosexual. Uno de los cinco factores anteriores pueden haber jugado un papel sumamente importante en esta "decisión", en el caso del gemelo que ahora es homosexual. <br>  <br>  La homosexualidad y la Evolución <br>  <br>  La evolución sostiene que a través del paso de generación en generación se pierden características genéticas que "son nocivas para la mejoría de las especies". Pues si la homosexualidad fuera genética, ya los homosexuales y lesbianas no existirían, pues como en la población ellos se reproducen con menos frecuencia que los heterosexuales (personas normales), habría un decreciente número de personas en la población con tendencias homosexuales. Los homosexuales serían una aberración del proceso de "perfeccionamiento continuo" de las especies, por lo que algún "proceso natural" ya habría desechado a seres con tendencias sexuales que no cooperarían con la continuación o la supervivencia de la raza humana. Sin embargo, no hay ninguna prueba que indique que sus números están en descenso. Todo lo contrario, si la evolución fuera cierta, dentro de unos mil a?os, basándonos en las tendencias actuales, no existirían suficientes hombres y mujeres heterosexuales como para continuar procreando otros seres humanos. ?La gran mayoría de nuestros descendientes fueran homosexuales genéticos, y aunque quisieran, no tendrían otra alternativa que extinguirse!  <br>  <br>  Pero regresemos al mundo real, al Creacionismo y a la historia de la que sí existe evidencia. La Biblia se refiere a las epidemias de homosexualidad y lesbianismo que ocurrieron en culturas especificas. Además de los ampliamente conocidos casos de Sodoma y Gomorra, tenemos otros casos. En Romanos 1:26-27 el apóstol Pablo describe tal hecho en la ciudad de Corinto: <br>  <br>  "Por esa razón, Dios ha dejado que esa gente haga todo lo malo que quiera. Por ejemplo, entre ellos hay mujeres que no quieren tener relaciones sexuales con los hombres, sino con otras mujeres. 27 Hombres con hombres cometen acciones vergonzosas, y sufren en su propio cuerpo el castigo merecido por su perversión…". (Note la mención de las enfermedades venéreas e infecciosas transmitidas entre lesbianas y homosexuales… ?hace dos mil a?os! <br>  Si en verdad la homosexualidad fuera heredada, seria constante a través del tiempo y de cultura en cultura. No habría epidemias como el SIDA y demás enfermedades venéreas. Ya el cuerpo humano habría desarrollado una capacidad para mostrarse renuente a estos tipos de enfermedades, como las que se mencionan en Romanos. <br>  <br>  Dios es infinitamente justo. No creo que él hablara de la homosexualidad en las Escrituras como un pecado abominable y enumerara entre algunas de las conductas humana más despreciable si más tarde cambiaría de parecer. Lo que fue pecado para Dios hace 4,000 a?os, en los tiempos de Abraham, lo continuó siendo en los tiempos de Pablo, hace 2,00 a?os, y lo continúa siendo hoy, 2,000 a?os más tarde. <br>  <br>  Mientras que la homosexualidad y el lesbianismo no son rasgos hereditarios, es importante enfatizar lo que a menudo ocurre a aquellos que no lo eligieron. Algunos individuos están viviendo un estilo de vida homosexual, pero no es que ellos hayan decidido ser homosexuales, sino que algunas de las influencias o factores que mencionamos al principio de este artículo los han inducido.  <br>  <br>  Pablo ense?ó que en la tierra existen 3 fuerzas. Una que siempre quiere el bien: Dios. Pero existen 2 que siempre quieren el mal: la carne y Satanás. Muchos han decidido ser homosexuales. Lo han hecho porque han dado riendas sueltas a sus deseos carnales. <br>  <br>  Finalmente debemos mencionar que otros han sido víctimas inocentes o han sido inducidos a convertirse en homosexuales. Fuerzas demoníacas luchan una batalla campal diariamente en la mente y el corazón de estos últimos. Ambos tienen esperanzas de ser libres, ya que si deciden venir al Se?or, el Espíritu Santo limpiará su casa de demonios y la carne tendrá que someterse al dominio del Espíritu.<br>  <br>  "El espíritu siempre está dispuesto, pero la carne es débil" Mateo 26:41<br>  Finalmente lea estas palabras donde el Cristiano más famoso de todos los tiempos, el Apostol Pablo muestra la inmensa influencia del pecado y de nuestra carne en lo concerniente a nuestras deciciones. La última oración de la porción bíblica que mostraré a continuación es la clave: <br>   <br>  "Nosotros sabemos que la ley viene de Dios. Pero yo no soy más que un simple hombre, y no puedo controlar mis malos deseos. Soy un esclavo del pecado. La verdad es que no entiendo nada de lo que hago, pues en vez de lo bueno que quiero hacer, hago lo malo que no quiero hacer. Pero, aunque hago lo que no quiero hacer, reconozco que la ley es buena. Así que no soy yo quien hace lo malo, sino el pecado que está dentro de mí. Yo sé que mis deseos egoístas no me permiten hacer lo bueno, pues aunque quiero hacerlo, no puedo hacerlo. En vez de lo bueno que quiero hacer, hago lo malo que no quiero hacer. Pero si hago lo que no quiero hacer, en realidad no soy yo quien lo hace, sino el pecado que está dentro de mí.  <br>  Me doy cuenta entonces de que, aunque quiero hacer lo bueno, sólo puedo hacer lo malo. En lo más profundo de mi corazón amo la ley de Dios. Pero también me sucede otra cosa: Hay algo dentro de mí que lucha contra lo que creo que es bueno. Trato de obedecer la ley de Dios, pero me siento como en una cárcel, donde lo único que puedo hacer es pecar. Sinceramente, deseo obedecer la ley de Dios, pero no puedo dejar de pecar porque mi cuerpo es débil para obedecerla. ?Pobre de mí! ?Quién me librará de este cuerpo que me hace pecar y me separa de Dios? ?Le doy gracias a Dios, porque sé que Jesucristo me ha librado!" <br>  Romanos 7:14-25|`|af5a71ad45acbc49950e73f833477293aa	No es el Papa, es la Biblia.

They believe in his divinity and deity.|`|HLdV3PWKaa	the mormans do not belive in the 'bible' as all other divisions of christainity do. they have thier own vesion of the bible, the story of god and jesus christ. to some christians mormonism is the same as budism, a different, some may say wrong, 'god/ idol'|`|ifvHIpZ8aa	It's insecurity of faith.

It falls outside the pale of orthodoxy.|`|0aN1xIxfaa	It's important to distinguish between individuals belonging to various denominations, and the denominations themselves. Nobody can pronounce judgment on an individual; that they are not a Christian when they claim to be one. We may have our doubts, but it is not our place to insist they cannot be a Christian just because they belong to a certain denomination. Yet there absolutely are some denominations that proclaim a false gospel, a false Christ, and a false set of scriptures or other writings.<br>  <br>  Any group that claims to be Christian and the exclusive way to God is automatically false because Jesus is the only way to God. No organization can put itself alongside Christ as the means of salvation without exposing itself as anti-Christ. Salvation has got nothing to do with belonging to a denomination - one has to belong to Christ. That's what the Bible states: "You, however, are controlled not by the sinful nature but by the Spirit, if the Spirit of God lives in you. And if anyone does not have the Spirit of Christ, he does not belong to Christ." (Romans 8:9).<br>  <br>  Some Christians don't consider the Mormon denomination to be Christian because it teaches myriad gods; that Elohim created Jehovah God who then became the man, Jesus. That Elohim created Michael the Archangel, who then came to earth as Adam, bringing Eve with him (one of his wives). Mormonism teaches 4 levels of salvation; that man has a pre-existent life before he is born as a human baby.  The Mormon take on the deity of Christ is completely different to the Christian Trinity doctrine, nor do they attribute the qualities of Almighty God to the Holy Spirit. The Mormon gospel is about  and angel telling Joseph Smith new teachings and depends on his writings (in the 1800s). A false gospel is condemned by God: "I am astonished that you are so quickly deserting the one who called you by the grace of Christ and are turning to a different gospel - which is really no gospel at all.... But even if we or an angel from heaven should preach a gospel other than the one we preached to you, let him be eternally condemned!" (Gal. 1:6-9)|`|Eo7KcX3Waa	From what I understand is that the Mormon leader rewrote the bible , and the Christian bible, the Word of God states in the last book of Revelation not to take nothing from or add nothing to the bible...<br>  Christians do not accept the Catholic bible as the Word of God either, because there are books added to it...there is a list of them in this link<br>  <a href="http://www.nkcofc.com/BulletinArticles/Volume1Number21.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.nkcofc.com/BulletinArticles/V...</a><br>  We can put blindfolds on and act like it is not so, or we can accept the truth and the truth will set us free...<br>  God wrote His Word through the Holy Spirit just the way that He wanted it to be, not for us to change it up...|`|vxSXsn59aa	What, are you new here? Lots of these good christian folk don't even consider some other members of THEIR OWN cult to be christian enough. Religion for them is all about divisiveness, despite claims to the contrary.

We should be more concerned about our own relationship with God . I also believe that running someone else faith down is not the way to spread the what ever you believe to be the truth.|`|3sKU83sPaa	There are a few answers to your first question.<br>  <br>  First, I will mention something that has already been mentioned - most denominations of Christianity (Such as Catholicism, Baptist-ism?-, Pentecostalism, Lutheranism etc...) do teach that any other faith, any other denomination of faith and any major variance to their code does put you at great risk of Hell.<br>  <br>  A definition:<br>  Protestant Religion: Any non-Catholic Christian religion that believes in the deity of Jesus christ and the salvific power of the cross and repentance. They reject any books aside from the Old and New Testaments and generally tend to follow the New Testament.<br>  <br>  The Catholic bible includes several books that were purged from the protestant canon (compilation of books that make up the bible). Catholicism also has the Catechism, it's own interpretation of the meanings and rules in the bible.<br>  <br>  The Mormon faith rewrote much of the bible and changed much of the meanings.<br>  <br>  Jehovah's Witness did the same.<br>  <br>  I was raised as a Protestant Christian and attended a Protestant Christian Bible College (though I no longer confess to be a Christian), and many, many times in my life, the above three religions have been referenced as cults. Most Protestant Christan religions reject any religion that has a book other than the bible. There is a verse in the book of Revelations that says that if anyone adds or takes away from this book, they shall be sent to hell - hence the reasoning of the Protestants. <br>  <br>  This is the general belief. The reason Catholicism isn't as widely rejected, in my opinion, is because it came first and came strongest. <br>  <br>  I hope this answers your question.|`|yTAXDL5Jaa	because they have a differant God, jesus, satan garden of eden story, end of the world story and everythign is different, I have told the missionaries I am a christian they have told me they are christian still they insist that I need to join their churhc, does this make sence, why convert a christian to christianity???|`|MTi7r9l6aa	I've noticed the same with Catholics and Jehovah's Witnesses.

4qA9Y7m9aa	All you need is evidence.|`|yB0nVXfWaa	Dear Paulio, I don't think you can, either, because an atheist is in love with his own explanations, and it'll take more than any christian arguments to shift him.  That I have observed.<br>  <br>  No, if an atheist is to be shifted from his position, only a movement of the Holy Spirit can do it, for it is the Spirit's job-description 'to convict the world of sin, of righteousness, and of judgment (John 16:8).  Me, I have no power to do anything - unless He, the Holy Spirit, moves.<br>  <br>  So, in speaking and reasoning with an atheist, there is no guarantee that I could 'successfully go about this'.  The Holy Spirit has his own ideas on how to tackle such people, and he doesn't tell me everything.<br>  <br>  What I have found most often works is this, that 'Paul plants, Apollos waters, and God gives the increase'.  So, if I am faithful just to plant, as Paul, or to water, as Apollos, then I will have my reward when God gives the increase.<br>  <br>  Oh, by the way, you seem to think that we are limited if you don't allow us to speak about things like 'the threat of hell' etc.  No, not at all!  Why, only the other day I interpreted a dream which a young girl had.  No-one else had managed to satisfy her as to the explanation, but my answer did, and she was most thankful.  Actually, the explanation of the dream had nothing to do with God, but that young girl now knows that God uses his people to interpret dreams, and that he cares for her.  As I said, 'Paul planted...'.  Who do you think gave her that dream in the first place?<br>  <br>  We christians are co-workers with God.  We can do nothing on our own account, much less convince an atheist!  Don't you know, it takes a miracle?|`|X548yCR6aa	Bring the god along for a meeting.

Whoever shall recite the Rosary devoutly, applying himself to the consideration of its sacred mysteries, shall never be conquered by misfortune. God will not chastise him in His justice, he shall not perish by an unprovided death; if he be just, he shall remain in the grace of God and become worthy of eternal life.<br>  7. Whoever shall have a true devotion for the Rosary shall not die without the Sacraments of the Church.<br>  8. Those who are faithful to recite the Rosary shall have during their life and at their death the light of God and the plenitude of His graces; at the moment of death, they shall participate in the merits of the saints in Paradise.<br>  9. I shall deliver from Purgatory those who have been devoted to the Rosary.<br>  10. The faithful children of the Rosary shall merit a high degree of glory in Heaven.<br>  11. You shall obtain all you ask of me by the recitation of the Rosary.<br>  12. All those who propagate the Holy Rosary shall be aided by me in their necessities.<br>  13.

Where is your backbone.<br>  <br>  Islam's most significant contribution to 2008 was probably the terror attacks in Mumbai, India, in which a dozen Pakistani-trained gunmen managed to massacre members of every other major world faith in one fell swoop, including Buddhists, Christians, Jews and a whole lot of Hindus. <br>  <br>  But of all the bloody stories to come out of the incident, perhaps none were worse than the rape, torture, murder and mutilation of innocents at the Chabad House, including the rabbi and his family. In a city of 18 million, it is wildly improbable that the handful of Jews there were chosen at random.<br>  <br>  Despite the religious declaration of the surviving gunman and the claims of responsibility for the violence by the Mujahideen, giving credit to Allah, the New York Times predictably refused to call the mass murder spree an act of Islamic terror. The BBC even took it a step further by actually declining to label the gunmen as terrorists (stopping just short of calling them community activists, apparently). <br>  <br>  Clearing Islam of blame in circumstances such as these is certainly the stuff of which Dhimwits are made.

SZdVYrSSaa	Don't regret it. I lost a huge number of friends when I came out, I mean like upwards of 100 people I saw on a daily basis for almost 5 years stopped talking to me entirely. This is a reality, he may not be able to handle it at all, and in this case, I do think it is better you said something, because the longer you kept it from him, the harder the blow would have been if he can't handle sticking by you, and eventually it would have come out in the wash, I mean, even if you kept it from him, what were you planning to tell him say, 10 years down the road if you were dating someone and decided to get committed? He really can't stay a close part of your life if he can't accept you, and yes, he may have been a good friend, and a "true friend" but you can't live the next 60-some years of your life behind a mask from someone who is supposed to be very close to you just because you have known him for six years. <br>  <br>  If you can get him to give you some time, try to explain it a little. Make sure he knows that you aren't in love with him or some wild thing like that, and that you really do trust him as a friend and wanted him to know because you felt it wouldn't be right for you to lie to a friend you've known so long, or to have to cut him out of your life in the case that you found someone special. Be sure that he knows how hard it was for you to come to terms with this, and how hard it was for you to tell him. Tell him that you understand if he needs time, and maybe pick up some PFLAG materials for him to read over, they have pamphlets and things that help explain some of the fear or anger he may have to get over. Make sure you reassure him that this doesn't change your friendship with him, or who you are as a person. If you have to, you may need to show a little muscle down the road and ask him to man up and deal with it, but this is down the road. Make it clear that you have known you were gay for a while and that it didn't really make a difference before he knew.<br>  <br>  If there is a dispute of religious nature, it may get more difficult, and that is something you may have to face. Just keep in mind that there is nothing here for you to regret. He would have had to find out about you someday, one way or another. If you loose him as a friend, you would have lost him next year, or fourteen years down the road anyways, and no matter how close he is to you, you cannot become a different person for the sake of protecting one friend, it is just simply not possible, or fair to you.<br>  <br>  You have made the right choice, and the brave choice. The question is weather he will be mature enough to do the same.|`|AYfJWQuTaa	The choice is yours, but being open is far better, you will now find out if your friends are true ones, ok, some may take a little time, but a true friend will accept you for who you are.<br>  Never be embarrassed about being gay, be proud and open always, thank goodness there are laws to stop prejudice which can still exist in some places even now.<br>  I hope you find your 'shocked' friend will still remain a buddy.|`|7aK81hsbaa	you did the right thing, how he handles that is his issue. it takes courage to come out i kno, did it long ago.sometimes you get that kind of reaction. had a guy i thot was a friend threaten me when i came out.<br>  we  ended up being better friends than ever but it took time.|`|hy3q2iWaaa	i used to have the same feeling but when you get used to it, you'll just ignore the fact that some people are just not comfortable with gay people. If your friend will stop treating you as his friend, its his loss, not yours. But I think your friend is right, give him time, once he get used to the idea, things may go back to what it used to be between you guys but I think he might be conscious about body contacts, and don't talk to him about homosexuality unless he started to.|`|AA11096726	If this is even true there sure aren't many people like that around, where do you get your friends?|`|3RQkgTSOaa	You cannot control how others react or feel. Ignorance may be bliss buts it also means floating through life, unaware and completely clueless about one's surroundings. I'm sure my Mom felt the same way when I told her I was gay. "Oh! I wish you hadn't told me!"<br>  <br>  Here's the thing about that: many people look at homosexuality as something to be ASHAMED of, gays and str8's. This is why we have so much trouble coming out in the first place. However, some people have SO internalized the shame that when they find out someone ELSE is gay, they now must bear the burden of that "awful secret." It's almost as if they, THEMSELVES, are gay.<br>  <br>  Now depending on HOW you told these people of your orientation will determine a LOT about their reaction. If you did this in the secretive "I have something to tell you" way, the message you sent was that you, yourself, are not quite yet comfortable with your sexuality. So in essence you passed your secret on to others. You let them know unconsciously that your secret is now their secret, a burden they may not have wanted. I'm not saying you should be obnoxiously casual or flamboyantly open about your sexuality, but if you let them know that it's NO BIG THING, they will be more relaxed about it. If they see that it really doesn't matter to you who knows, they will adopt the same attitude. Well, they MAY adopt the same attitude if they aren't really hung up about it.<br>  <br>  And, yes, give him time. How long did it take you to come to this realization and tell others? Allowing him 5 minutes to come to terms with your sexuality is not fair. He may require just as long as you did. But DON'T obsess over it. Do not keep asking him "I'm gay. Are you OK with that?" That's like picking at a scab. You've said your piece. Now let it be. Let him process it. Let him come to YOU if he has questions. Don't push it anymore than you already have.<br>  <br>  He may never fully accept you but he may be able to adjust his frame of reality to fit you into his life. And that's all ANY of us can ask. We can't demand anyone accept and love us. We just have to hope that they see THROUGH the label and see US.<br>  <br>  Good luck.|`|810513944bc1fc28c514a617993b162faa	My brother told my family he was gay a few months ago and whilst me and my family accepted it and were happy that my brother could finally tell us, my dad had a similar reaction to your friend. Its still rocky between them, and he came out a few months ago. When somebody is told all their life that homosexuality is wrong and disgusting, it takes a lot for them to change their minds.<br>  <br>  I think now its out, you should let the chips fall where they may. <br>  Your friend will either accept it or he won't, and if he does he may take some time to get over his prejudice. <br>  <br>  You shouldn't be tempted to hide who you are :)|`|7qF6R7d5aa	He's been hit by the flu real bad..i think just dont treat him differently,  i mean it's very evident that he's got homophobia all over him and maybe the friendship u both have would ultimately be the remedy..|`|cZnjkHKKaa	he will be fine. good for you for coming out. you should be proud of yourself. and when your friend has calmed down and gotten over the shock he will be to|`|ZFF33hIgaa	...just let him manage his own disbelief!!  u have made a big leap by letting them know the real you.. congrats!! BE YOURSELF, ACCEPTANCE WILL FOLLOW LATER!|`|YGYMocGRaa	he just didnt expect such a situation. hell get over it eventually. 1st times can always be confusing|`|oEoFMzgDaa	maybe he didnt know.take some time|`|EEmVX6C9aa	Yes, "ignorance is bliss". <br>  <br>  As in you can go along your happy way people lieing to you left and right just to make you happy. But what happens when suddenly all that you knew fell apart? Your world collapses in around you, when you find out one lie, you find out that pretty much all your friends where in on it?<br>  <br>  I would hate finding out that one of my good friends had been lieing to me about a huge portion of their lives, just to make sure I would remain their friend. <br>  <br>  He might have reacted differently had you told him 6 years ago, its been a truth in his life now for 6 years that you were straight. So yes he probably needs some time.<br>  <br>  Imagine your parents had divorce/split up when you were young. Your mother had full custody of you and you never seen/heard from your father. Your mother telling you nasty things about him like he was heavily into drugs and slept aorund and that he walked out on you uys never turning back.<br>  When you get older you want to know about your father, maybe confront him? Who knows, you find out where he lived go to his house and after you start you screaming and yelling at the front door he moves to where you can see his living room and above the mantel is an 11x14 picture of YOU as a baby. he shows you Ups and Fedex reciepts of packages he had sent you though the years, told you about teh hundreds of letters he sent, how he tried so hard to see you.<br>  <br>  imagine that lie.... to find out he was none of the things your mother told you for all of your life? I know its not the same but as you describe it you just uprooted what he knew, now hes probably wondering what other tidbits of your life you are keeping from him.<br>  <br>  Just wait I'm sure he will come around.

Those chosen will understand that God is not to blame, and that blaming Him for evil is human nature; it is rebellion against Him. Those who are chosen will want to know Him, and His promise to them is that they will have peace in Him only.<br>  <br>  The world will not understand any of that.|`|NMaCcyeKaa	God is not an active participant in the living world.  He created the world for us.  How we treat each other, our problems, and what we perceive to be problems are manifestations of our own free will.  Babies die because they are lucky enough to go to Heaven right away instead suffering on this dirtball planet of ours for decades.  <br>  <br>  For people of faith, the purpose of life is not being alive.  Those who believe have an eternity in the afterlife they are looking forward to.  Therefore, living and all of its hardships and struggles are merely a test of our mettle to see where our souls should go afterward.

I would say he's uncaring, because I have already experienced a miracle His Son, and our Patron Saint, Saint Peter, has done for me, so that made me believe in him all the more. <br>  <br>  I may not get all the things i pray for, but I do know that he's there. As Jesus said in the bible, [trust me, i don't read the bible or any other holy book, my mom just told me this] People who haven't seen Him but believe in Him are lucky. I don't really know what that means either, but i know i'll be able to understand it when i get older. <br>  <br>  In regards to religion killing more people than conflict, i think i can relate that to the middle east. the sunni and shiites, yes? they are both muslim, yet they continue to wage war against each other. they are both muslim, and the slight differences in their religion is i think the reason why they're in war. the sunni want shiites to believe in what they believe and the shiites want the sunnis to believe in what they believe.
lZ3INiojaa	Okey,I did not change your style, but looked at spelling, grammar and sentence structure, here you go: <br>  <br>  Sydney, the state capital of New South Wales, is the biggest and oldest city of Australia.<br>  <br>  In this city, there are a lot of activities to embark on, like doing sports or going sightseeing. Y In the sports centers of the city you can do sports like cricket, tennis or football. If you like outdoor sports you can go to the beaches and play volleyball or go surfing. If you like sightseeing holidays there are monuments to visit. <br>  <br>  One of the monuments that you must visit is the Sydney opera house, it was built in 1973 and it is one of the world's most distinctive 20th century buildings. Another famous building is the Sydney tower. If you go up, you can see the entire city and the suburbs. So, usually there are a lot of people waiting to go up.<br>  <br>  If you like animals, you can go also to the Taronga zoo, there you can see animals from Australia such as the platypus, koala or kangaroo.<br>  <br>  After a marvelous day you can go for dinner at the Fish Face Restaurant, this restaurant is in the centre of the city and offers a typical Australian food. <br>  <br>  But, Sydney has negative things too, in the summer time fires are a danger, they start in the national parks. <br>  <br>  Despite, the pollution and fires I think that is a beautiful city to visit, so I expect going to Sydney like a millions of tourist.|`|VxoDtwqVaa	ez dut tutik ere ez ulertzen ingles ,agur.|`|YQxxVdLNaa	Sydney, the capital of New South Wales, is the largest and oldest city in Australia.<br>  <br>  In this city there’s so much to do.

Cada um desses 12, depois de instruídos, estar?o aptos a fazer mais 12 discípulos, e assim sucessivamente. Na prática é como se cada um se tornasse Cristo e tivesse 12 apóstolos. Mas Deus n?o quer quantidade e sim qualidade.<br>  <br>  Como tudo que parece bom o homem consegue transformar em maldi??o, muitos notaram que o sistema era capaz de captar mais pessoas para a igreja e conseqüentemente aumentar a arrecada??o. Com isso alguns mal intencionados come?aram a implantar esse método em suas igrejas. Houve várias rupturas, pois os mais piedosos consideravam isso charlatanismo, só mais um meio de ganhar dinheiro.<br>  <br>  Para piorar ainda mais a situa??o, algumas igrejas come?aram a introduzir no seu discipulado encontros isolados em sítios, que duravam 3 ou 4 dias, e que o que acontecesse por lá n?o deveria ser falado com ninguém. Absurdo isso. Como Deus n?o permite que se oculte as coisas erradas, foi descoberto que introduziram a prática de regress?o. Como é isso? Regress?o a vidas passadas? N?o, uma regress?o mental, em que a pessoa era orientada a voltar no tempo e relembrar todos os seus pecados, até chegar ao útero de sua m?e.<br>  <br>  Ocorre que isso trouxe sérios problemas psicológicos à algumas pessoas que disso participaram. Os psicólogos sérios condenam a regress?o justamente por causa dos "efeitos colaterais". Hoje o movimento G12 está dividido entre os que praticam tal coisa e os que n?o praticam, entretanto ainda há vários pontos obscuros nesse movimento, grande parte dele está contaminado, por tenho minhas reservas quanto a isso.<br>  <br>  O suposto ministério do Diante do Trono, me parece estar contaminado com doutrinas n?o bíblicas, como a un??o do le?o, feito este praticado pela Ana Paula Valad?o num show deles e que deu muito o que falar.<br>  <br>  Cuidado! Examinemos as escrituras cautelosamente e n?o nos deixemos levar por interpreta??es literais ou humanas, sen?o seremos alvos fáceis de pessoas mal intencionadas.

In a city of 18 million, it is wildly improbable that the handful of Jews there were chosen at random.<br>  <br>  Despite the religious declaration of the surviving gunman and the claims of responsibility for the violence by the Mujahideen, giving credit to Allah, the New York Times predictably refused to call the mass murder spree an act of Islamic terror. The BBC even took it a step further by actually declining to label the gunmen as terrorists (stopping just short of calling them community activists, apparently). <br>  <br>  Clearing Islam of blame in circumstances such as these is certainly the stuff of which Dhimwits are made.

1680de8ab7d0f5d20f5b73ba98b5a13faa	Dear friend, like you my native language is not English and I would be pleased if some of the things I tried could be useful to you.<br>  <br>  First of all concentrate on thinking before speaking. I mean when ever a non-english (UK/Brit/Aus)  is making a conversation in English he/she has to work a little extra due to the thought process that goes just before speaking.Typically I would think in my native language then translate the thought in English (mentally) and then speak OR write.<br>  Particularly while speaking , my process would be longer than the respondent (fluent in english) .This would give me a complex forcing me to speak as quickly as I could leading to mistakes. Hence the first thing I tried was to take my own time in speaking, allowing the process of translating in mind adequate time.It assured me that even though I was slow in speaking, I was speaking correctly.It boosted my confidence.<br>  <br>  Other thing that helped was to work for increasing vocabulary, and I found Page 4 of Times Of india , Mumbai a valuable recource for the same.You may be possibly locate a similar resource near to you.<br>  <br>  Reading english was of immense help. Please do read lots of  magazines, novels, classics etc etc as per your liking and taste.<br>  <br>  Listen to news in English on BBC or any radio channel of your choice, I remember listening to  SLOW news on AIR was of great help.<br>  <br>  Finally, love the language and speak with confidence.I am sure  it is very easy for an Italian  to master speaking in English.<br>  <br>  All the best ! ! !|`|EIrdLq6Zaa	Buon giorno Danielle,<br>  <br>  I've been to Italy 4 times in the past ten years. I wanted to learn how to speak enough Italian to get by. Although I knew in the bigger cities they speak English, I still wanted to learn some Italian; just the basics, "Hello, goodbye, thank you, where is, I would like etc..." I used audio tapes in my car. I tried discs at home but found that I wasn't disciplined enough to do that. Since I drive 40 minutes each way for work, tapes worked best for me because I could rewind a sentence over and over to make sure I understood it and spoke it clearly. After I got many basics, the pronunciation, the grammar and felt comfortable to move on, I went to the library and took out children's books in Italian. This helped me with colors, numbers, animals etc... I also practiced my Italian with friends who speak Italian. Additionally, I would look at restaurant menus. If I saw the word in Italy "funghi" I knew it had mushrooms. Since you need this by June, I'd go to the library to start off with since you do speak some English. Other than "grazie and prego, I knew no Italian at at all.<br>  <br>  Buono fortuno.

You can NOT become better ONLY in one area e.g. speaking, you MUST improve your skills in ALL dimensions of the language!<br>  <br>  Learning language well requires being as active as possible and making the learning fun for yourself. Taking lessons is always important, but equally important are these:<br>  <br>  1) Listen/watch: Listen to internet radio stations like BBC, watch TV shows in English (use only subtitles, NOT voice dubbing!), etc.<br>  <br>  2) Write/communicate: Try to find discussion forums from the web about things that you find interesting (music/various artists, hobbies, etc.) and start communicating there with other people using English. Start using instant messaging systems in case you find some new friends or start emailing them.<br>  <br>  3) Buy yourself a proper dictionary, and each time when you see a strange word that you do not understand, look it up.<br>  <br>  The main point in ANY language learning is to make it as fun as possible for yourself. Try to find topics that interest you, read online newspapers, listen to BBC/NBC and other radio stations online, if you find a discussion forum for e.g. your favourite hobby or your idols in music do participate there, etc. <br>  <br>  I'm sorry there is no easy way out with this, you must develop your skills in ALL these language "levels" or dimensions in order to reach better language skills!! <br>  <br>  Last but not least: NEVER EVER use ANY online translators, they are nothing but utter rubbish!!<br>  <br>  Good luck!

719261d758e0cebf5beeb6101b21166faa	My parents never gave me grief about how I raise my kids and yours have no business doing so. Since they won't obey your wishes, withdraw their welcome. Tell them they have two choices. Agree to quit preaching to the kids or not see their grandchildren at all and make it clear that one breach of their word to you means no second chances and mean it. If you are not resolute they'll know and keep abusing your tolerance.|`|X8LNbaKQaa	Explain to your children that some people have been convinced that terrible fairy tales are true and they can't help being scared of what they believe.   They mean well when they try to pass these tales on to others, but you can just listen politely and know that what you are hearing is something they are mistaken about.  No need to argue about it.  You can even thank them for their concern and love for you without believing as they do.  No need to turn the kids against their grandparents, though you can discuss what the grandparents are imagining, but when they aren't around.  Just explain that they can't help thinking what they think.   They have literally been scared out of their wits.<br>  <br>  Your kids (or, at least the 13 year old) should be old enough to deal with this reasonably and with some empathy.<br>  <br>  -- <br>  Regards,<br>  <br>  John Popelish|`|urIm4YaBaa	Tell them that their religion doesn't come through your door. If they need to stay outside with it instead of seeing their grandchildren, they're welcome to do so. If they try it one more time, ask them to leave. If they refuse or argue, tell them to either leave, or that you'll call the police to have them forcibly removed if necessary.<br>  <br>  The thing is, they don't want to argue about the relevant facts--such as proving that a god exists in the first place. They just want their way. Show them that you aren't going to give in just because they demand that you do so. In your house, you make the rules. If they want to insult your lack of faith, including the result that you apply a different standard to raising children, then they have no right to be in a place where you're in charge. <br>  <br>  Be clear that you gave them a fair chance to have normal relations, and they blew it by overstepping their bounds. Tell them that, when they demonstrate that they're willing to respect you as an adult, including your right to disregard their faith, that you'll consider letting them see their grandchildren, but not a minute sooner.|`|qbelhflAaa	Tell both of them to f*ck off.<br>  <br>  And refuse to let them in if they come to your door. And don't answer their calls.|`|7gHnVJpyaa	Sounds like your parents are behaving like zealots, and I have learned, from this site as well as many other places, that there is not much you can do to make such people see reason, or respect other people's rights to believe as they wish.<br>  All you can do is make sure that your kids understand that there are a diversity of opinions on spirituality, and religious/philosophical beliefs, and that it is up to the individual to decide what makes sense for them, when they are ready. You can share your own views with them without insisting that they follow or adopt them. In the meantime, you can simply try to maintain a good and respectful relationship with your parents, for everyone's sake.|`|vrcxxRr8aa	Well, to keep from getting your kid traumatized, show him information on many religions, whether they are still practiced or not, and show him that old religions are myths. Because myths are not true, and religions now will eventually be myths, he has nothing to worry about. Tell him that his grandparents are just crazy and he should not take anything they say seriously.|`|PPvk105Caa	Tell them to keep their beliefs to themselves unless they are asked about them. They have no right to push religion on people, especially family. If they can't just shut it & be family then they'll have to be family from a distance because they're trying to build ignorance from fear into your kids. It's ridiculous.  I imagine the feeling, I'm going to have to go through the same thing when I have kids. <br>  <br>  Make sure you son knows, there is no hell and that people believe many different things, and those who try and push things on people with fear are the ones on the wrong path. They'll keep trying to bring him down but he's got to be stronger then that other wise, that is the real hell. <br>  <br>  All the best|`|cmoGATT9aa	i think you should follow through with your threats.<br>  don't invite them over, tell them not to contact your kids.<br>  do this for a week or 2. <br>  they have no right to do that to you and your kids.<br>  tell them, if they want to see you and your children, they will stop preaching and scaring them. they're your children, you parent them how you see fit. their visits to your children are a privilege not a right.|`|kKVNzhmQaa	Get an electric fence.<br>  <br>  Seriously though, if they were my kids I would take my parents off to the side and tell them if they ever want to see their grandkids again they will leave their beliefs at the door.|`|yN3fWUCuaa	While I'm a Christian, it is unfortunate your parents are so forceful and do an absolutely * deplorable * job of presenting the gospel.<br>  <br>  Perhaps that is why you are not of faith.<br>  <br>  It's tragic, really.  Sometimes those of the faith are their own worst enemy.<br>  <br>  You know, you could try to turn the tables on them.   They appear to have the fire-and-brimstone part down pat.

I would agree with previous posters here that you should lay down the law here and say either knock off the terrorist tactics or don't show up here anymore. As a former born-again Christian I can understand where they're coming from here and they only mean the best but, seriously, they need to learn to respect your wishes and beliefs and learn to shut the hell up about all that crap. The `truth' of Christianity is that it's taken from more ancient belief systems and there is NO reason for your children to be subjected to the Christian myth of hell. Unless a Christian has read the Bible in the original - or at least has read it in more than one translation - and has explored the roots of the religion said Christian has nothing to say of relevance. Most Christians have not read the Bible at all. Just tell your parents to either respect your beliefs or get lost.|`|nZP6FT1Qaa	I just want to say i am a christian and trying to scare people into believing in God is not christ like. It is the Goodness of christ that leads them to repentance. Sorry  you  don't believe in God, but its this type of stereotyping that  make people not want to believe. I think its time you search for a God yourself , so  you can teach them the proper way  to lead people.  This is just my opinion and i  truly hope you get this matter resolved. Can u tell us why you  don't believe in God, or is it you just haven't found a need to have God in your lives?|`|WNUP7wsDaa	Your kids should be allowed to choose what they want to do.  They shouldn't be pressured by either you or your parents into believing (or not believing) in anything.  You are in a really difficult position, because your parents are putting a ridiculous amount of pressure on your children.  They should never be scared in such a way, particularly by their grandparents.  Explain to your parents that your children can have the ability to choose what religion they want to follow, if any, and you want it to be their choice.  Tell them that instead of encouraging your son to be religious, they are just scaring him which is likely to lead him away from religion, not towards.  Ask them to only talk to your kids about religion if they the kids ask them about it.  I think that this is a reasonable compromise.  If your parents don't agree with this, then you may want to tell them that they can't come over anymore.<br>  <br>  By the way.  My parents are atheist too and they wanted my brother and me to be able to choose whatever we wanted to believe in, so they didn't discuss religion unless we wanted to and never forced their beliefs on us.  We both ended up being atheist anyway.  So even if you really don't want your children to be religious, give them the freedom to choose, because that way they'll be happy and won't rebel against you by becoming religious.|`|1Y1PBMXlaa	You are right to be angry.  They have no right to frighten your son like that.

Hopefully they'll realize how horrible they're acting and straighten up. Also, and ultimatum helps.

I would do this to the other children (assuming there are others) at a similar age. <br>  Explain what will happen to your parents. Try be kind to you parents and draw on their religious beliefs to be kind and respecting when dealing with this issue and your family.

NScUzbeuaa	reverse racism|`|N9nJWYa5aa	Yes they are being racist, but it does not negate your own racism.  And if they were to do something that would get you into trouble then there is no reason why you could not pursue this.  Racism no matter who it comes from is wrong and should be dealt with.|`|kVcy1VRyaa	You are. <br>  Coincidentally, I read an article in a newspaper recently dealing with something like this (I live in the U.K. so it's a U.K. newspaper; but the idea is the same as what you are talking about).<br>  The article described how a white man was not allowed a job because he was white. Apparently this is perfectly legal in England (I'm not sure about the USA). However, in other articles, where a black person has been denied a job because he is black all hell breaks loose and people left, right and centre are branded racist. <br>  This is ridiculous. Racism is the discrimination against a group because of ethnicity. <br>  If people are not allowed to discriminate against black people; then why are people allowed to discriminate against white people.<br>  <br>  It isn't right to blame the black people for this. In another article that I stumbled across a coloured politician described how the racism double-standard annoys them as well. Because of it, white people believe blacks are getting preferential treatment - when they never asked for it. This is sparking off real racism - not just the kind that is supposedly there every time someone 'plays the race card' as it were - but violent attacks. A lot of the coloured community (according to the article) see it as degrading that whites and blacks are not equal in this respect and that they have some 'special' rights. They have lived in the USA or the U.K. for many, many years in relative peace - so why introduce controversial laws that will generate attacks and more hate?|`|a0cb768a2bcdc7a915356d5a5db75704aa	Turn those people who are being racist in. You don't have to put up with there ignorance. Something like 60% of Obama voters were white anyways. I hate that double standard. For instance there was a movie put out a few years ago called "White Girls", starring two black guys dressed up as white girls. White people could never do that. NEVER! Stupid.|`|0fuF2sHbaa	You're the one saying it's not racism.<br>  <br>  Just because people think that black people can't be racist, doesn't make them right.<br>  <br>  Isn't that obvious?|`|vd1YIMbaaa	yeah thats racist on both counts. if one generalizes about a group of people that's racist.<br>  everyone has freedom of speech, say what you want<br>  |`|ncdTxID9aa	Blacks can be just as racist as Whites.|`|uqMK3rUZaa	It became so important to protect blacks that sometimes everyone else's rights and liberties are overlooked. In trying to make everyone equal, something went wrong, and blacks have some extra legal rights. Though the principle was good, the laws got a little screwy. In trying to strike a balance--in anything--often things go wrong. Right or wrong, that's just the way things are. At the very base of it, why bother saying hateful things? It's just not nice. You know, the Golden Rule, treat others the way you want to be treated. Ok, so that doesn't mean you're *going* to be treated the way you would like. Instead of making it a black and white issue, why not make it an issue of respect?|`|e0lfV7skaa	You're not legally forced to keep your thoughts to yourself.  But your attitude certainly suggests you're a racist.<br>  <br>  And white people already have civil rights - the minority doesn't punish the majority.  That's so clear anyone can see it - unless they're a racist.<br>  <br>  But keep up the attitude.  You'll go far.  *smirk*|`|AA12333871	It's racist all ways around. You have a problem with it, speak about it to them! Don't keep your mouth shut!<br>  <br>   Sure, black people have been and still are treated badly.<br>  <br>   However, this does not make it fair or "RIGHT" for them to speak badly about other races.

I totally agree with you though.  Racism, sexism, any ism in this since is wrong.  Two wrongs don't make a right.  As a black man I don't talk ill of any race, but I have friends of all races who have their moments. Many African Americans are just giving back what they have experienced in the past.  White people are often the butt of our jokes, just like behind closed doors blacks, gays, latinos, and other minorities are the butt of yours.  The only difference is we will say it to your face and dare you to do it back.  Is this wrong, yes it is.  Don't read to much into it.  Many times our culture is misunderstood, or even sometimes misrepresented by the few.  I feel it is the same about many whites.  Don Imus and many other bigots give you all a bad name.  I feel if you give you should be able to receive it.  Don't mistake empowerment for racism, and vice versa.  And for the lady who was talking about Black College, and Black shcolarships, and BET, all these entities were developed by us to put ourselves on a even playing field.  For years we were not able to go to college, because whites wouldn't let us.  This is not racsim, it is educating and empowering our own race in a positive way.  It is not the same empowerment the KKK and Skin Heads preach.  All we are doing is giving our selves a chance to succeed, and learn about our culture which is often over looked in history books.  My father has his Masters Degree from Tuskgee University.  He went there in the 60's because he was not allowed to go to other schools.  One more question, is the WE channel sexsist? I think not.  Is CMT a rasist station?  I never see blacks on that station. Come on listen to yourself, educate your self on the history of these things before you talk about them.  I am a wealthy black male 26 years old, with two college educated parents from the south.  This may never have been possible for me or my parents if it wasn't for schools like Tuskegee.  So lets talk about equal rights.  Things are better now, but look were they came from.|`|FxcQ5STcaa	Well there's a difference then speaking badly and saying stupid white people. I'm mixed race and if someone said stupid black or spanish people it wouldn't bother me much. But if you said all blacks are stupid, all blacks are ... etc. That's racism you are generalizing and that's not good for any race, culture, religious group, gender etc. African america's always joke around and if one says all white people are... then you have every right to be mad. The reason why we get so touching when white people say anything about us, because of the bad history. You see hispanics say *** to other blacks to say hello but if a white person does it, it's NOT okay. That's because of the history. If the world was the other way around then you would be the same. I never paid attention in class during the history listens of slavery or was absence from the approval of my parents. I'm glad they did this because I didn't grow up bitter and I didn't have to watch those horrible movies. I think we should have the option of what we want to know and for the school to stop reminding us. We should just forget it, it does no good.<br>  <br>  Lol b_cunnin there's lost of movies that make fun of us. Like malibu's most wanted, Ali G, just to name a few. It's funny stop being so serious!!

That's rude to the rest of us.|`|WyICbuPqaa	Sure - just as soon as someone comes up with a reasonable theory that explains the existence of the Book of Mormon.  So far, the most reasonable theory is the one told by Joseph Smith the Prophet.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.jefflindsay.com/BMEvidences.shtml" rel="nofollow">http://www.jefflindsay.com/BMEvidences.s...</a><br>  <a href="http://www.the-book-of-mormon.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.the-book-of-mormon.com/</a><br>  <br>  And then there is the little problem of prophecy.  Joseph Smith prophesied of many things, most of which came true to the letter.  How did he know the future?  If he could make so many accurate prophesies through the spirit of God, then why not every ancient prophet?<br>  <a href="http://www.jefflindsay.com/LDSFAQ/FQ_prophecies.shtml" rel="nofollow">http://www.jefflindsay.com/LDSFAQ/FQ_pro...</a><br>  <br>  And then there is the problem of healing.  Joseph Smith seemed to have some sort of authority from God.  He commanded the withered hand of Mrs. Johnson to be made whole.  She had not been able to use it for years.  It was made whole on the spot.  Several people who knew her attested of the facts.  She wasn't even a member of the church.  This was just the first of many healings.  If you think this is just coincidence, try going up to someone who is severely handicapped, and command them to be made whole.  It is apparent that Joseph Smith had more than just chutzpah.  He had real power, and he knew it.<br>  <a href="http://en.fairmormon.org/Joseph_Smith_healings_and_miracles" rel="nofollow">http://en.fairmormon.org/Joseph_Smith_he...</a>|`|UutLVO2Laa	Yes.<br>  <br>  Move it over to the Mythology and folklore section.<br>  <br>  Actually we should petition Yahoo, and have it moved.|`|DZ5jSsMvaa	I've did that a long time ago.<br>  And I'm glad to see, that it is becoming a generally accepted attitude.<br>  They waste too much money and manpower for the next to nothing the do for society.|`|NMaCcyeKaa	No.  There is no proof of their failure, only proof that people have failed to live up to their teachings.|`|QVKWVValaa	Yes.|`|gFqeMs22aa	LOL<br>  <br>  at least two :) <br>  <br>  now have a fight to decide which one... oh... actually that's what's going on.|`|GoRFRY2naa	Definitely.

DapNp1Kxaa	My husband thinks he is a comedian, and whenever we buy canned cat food for our kitty, he makes a comment at the checkout stand about the great deal we're getting on the 'sandwhich spread'. Most of the clerks just look at him weird, but one girl, without missing a beat, said, 'yeah, I know. My dad eats it too.' My husbands eyes about popped out, and he said "Really?!!" She looked up at him, and snickered. "Nah! Just kidding!" Served him right.<br>  Also, my son, when he was a teenager, used to go to the store with his freinds, and they would do what they called 'shopping for others'. They'd go by an old ladys' cart, and put a pack of comdoms in it, or a big, burley guy would get up to the checkout, with a package of tampons in his cart. It was kind of funny, but I made him stop, at least while he was with me. I told him that he might be costing people money they didn't have if they didn't catch it. He swore that he always watched to make sure they did catch it. ???|`|Cs6aBBrJaa	When I was in my early 20's, a friend suggested that I try multivitamin supplements so I went to the supermarket.

Then I pick up another apple / pepper, juggle for 30 secs then do it again. I tend to get comments from "Hey, pretty good!" or "Showoff!".

Hjwp1yGWaa	A Civil Union is a legal agreement between two parties that claim they share each other's assets 50/50, it has the legal benefits of marriage with the exception of State and Federal aid.  A Marriage is a rite of the one true God, a sacred covenant with our Creator, and in the past the State and Federal Governments gave "benefits" of Marriage, instead of leaving the religious rite alone, and now it is desired by the secular community beyond the church, instead of just living in sin like they used to have no problem with, now they want acknowledgment and equal time with other married couples. as well as State and Federal benefits.|`|LT8blW3Oaa	no homo isnt correct, the difference with the two is that with a marriage  you can claim your spouse and also be on each other health insurance  but with a civil union, has no benefits at all and no legal binding like a marriage license does|`|47NUnFXJaa	as for rights- they are the same- the difference is one can be done in a court, whereas the other, ideally is done in a church or temple.  marriage was, in it's original form, a religious ceremony, ordained by God and binding through His holy law.  a civil union gives one the same legal rights, but does not bring God or faith into it.|`|eoCRWlrvaa	The word "marriage"<br>  Thats about it.<br>  A civil union is the same as marriage if the state makes it that way.
KiN3KVihaa	Yes, sometimes the 'u' sound in 'suki' is barely audible.  It's not the preferred way or 'street talk,' it is just what happens when people are speaking fast sometimes.  Same thing happens often when the last syllable is 'su' (as most often seen in 'desu'--but even this 'u' is often dropped even if they aren't talking fast). But when the last syllable is 'ru' the 'u' sound is usually audible.<br>  <br>  And I would recommend watching Japanese movies to get a more accurate representation of what "real world" talk would sound like.|`|d2vENVGlaa	yaah. . . the 'u' sound is most of the time is short, especially when you say 'desu'.  the best way to get the hang of it is to just talk and listen to japanese people speaking, or watch/listen japanese entertainment (who says you can't learn from anime?).<br>  how do you pronounce the 'u' sound atm?<br>  ---------------------------<br>  you get grief from anime/manga/eiga? how so? i reckon it does help with pronounciation.|`|AA11593134	wih the "u" is the proper way of pronoucing the words...

The NDE certainly affected me and helped to shape my beliefs over a period of years.

For all we know of things electric and mechanical, we know so little about what really fuels and operates the mind and why we might know something that doesn't make sense to be of use in our life - like feeling certain affinity to a different time, or being able to seriously envision an unrelated event.<br>  <br>  This is where I come from:  I often think that we experience too much coincidence.  Too many million-to-one, billion-to-one events.  Like it or not, natural order is present, works better than anything humanity builds, and we do not have every answer for it.  It was only in recent centuries and decades that we were able to get the first meaningful answers to what are inevitably going to be found basic and simple in scope later.<br>  <br>  Science doesn't answer it all, and religion doesn't provide living and currently present, tangible proofs to satisfy the other side, or those within willing to discern.<br>  <br>  Look at your own day-to-day. . .Too often, something arrives right when it was most important - something that we desperately need but don't expect.

I started my journey to gain enlightenment in 1997 after brain surgery and an extended illness after<br>  that lasted 2 years.  I was tired of being sick and confused about why these things were happening to me.  So I started looking for answers.  I was open to hear everything and then I would try what felt right.<br>  <br>  One of the things I did was take a class on energy healing at the University of Wisconsin.  I loved the class and the teacher.  I was seeing the merits of what he was teaching until one day when he said he wanted to discuss past lives.  I remember thinking, here comes the crap.  He started talking about it and then I got this flash.  I saw this older white man in a farm field.  I kind of jumped like I got a shock.  The teacher asked if I was alright and I told him that I just got a flash of this man, but it felt like a memory.  My impressions of him were of sadness, bigotry and a hatred of farming.  I got all that in an instant.  I wanted to know more.<br>  <br>  A few months later, I saw a flier about past life regression.  So my daughter, who was 14, and I decided to go.  I didn't think it would work, but it was worth a try.<br>  <br>  There were ten of us in this room in the back of a metaphysical store and we all looked pretty scared.  The lady started by getting us relaxed and doing some visualization.  Then as we were going through the process, we ended up at a door that we had to walk through.  On the other side of my door was a wheat field.  Then I went to my house and to my surprise I saw this big red barn.  The thing is that in this lifetime, my neighbors had a big red barn that I would alway looked at from my family room window.  It gave me comfort before it burned down.  To see this barn during my regression was so fimiliar.  Then I saw my wife and kids.  Then I was asked to go to a traumatic time and I saw my father beat me and then I flashed to beating my wife.  It was so upsetting that I got sick to my stomach.  I feel I was an alcoholic.  Then we were asked to go to our death.  I had throat cancer and I was dying.  My wife and kids were by my side.  I remember the feeling of rising up out of the body and looking back and feeling that they really loved me.  So I vowed to be more loving.<br>  <br>  In this lifetime, I was born black, female and I had an abusive father.  I am overly loving and I really hate smoking and drinking.  I don't allow it in my house.  Until the regression, I didn't know why I hated it so much.  In this life I have had a couple of tumors on my throat.  I have a scar where I saw the scar on the past life me.  My husband loves to garden but I hate the thought of being in the garden.  I was so glad when my husband gave it up.<br>  <br>  This would be entirely too long if I told you of my daughter's experience.  I'll just say that her best friend ties into her story in a major way.  It was thrilling.  They had spent many lives together.  It wouldn't seem that remarkable but for the fact that my daughter was born in Hawaii and she found this one girl after all the moving around we did.<br>  <br>  From my experience, reincarnation is how we work through complex problem and evolve as energy beings.  It is all about energy looking to express itself.  Yes, there is a collective we are all connected to and we are just trying to figure everything out.|`|6v8YrAlVaa	Well in order to answer that we have to answer "how do humans work'. The human brain is for all intents and purposes a biological computer. It operates off of small pulses of electricity. Billions upon billions of pulses per second operating in the same way as a computer uses 0's and 1's. I know that the soul is the same even though we cannot 'prove' there is a soul. It is more metaphysical and religious, but it is still who we are.If I was to use again the context of a computer, the brain is the HD with the operating system installed. the soul would be the programs that we put into it afterward, (ie games, pictures, etc) the stuff that makes us an individual.  Some of us are more connected to the past or by definition being anachronistic, (using computers again ...prefering windows 98 over Vista because it runs better). MInd you that this is the most SIMPLE of views. I have met people and to be frank I am one of those, who thinks and prefers to some extent or another the old way or a different way. Everyone has met someone who you would think be better off in a different time. If we are the blending of two people and we inherit the mother's eyes and the fathers nose...etc. Then I think it is most likely that we inherited some of their ways, thoughts on the most base level. So I guess to answer your question....yes in a way. We are the results of blending generation upon generation and they do live on. I guess that also it is possible to see more of yourself in someone in your past family tree.|`|AA10730174	Sounds possible. That would explain how a number of individuals almost have similar recollections of certain events. Although such an event would typically be "earth shattering" versus "common place".<br>  <br>  However, it would seem as likely that as a "collective" (in the manner of which you speak) we'd be almost all be inclined to have a certain affinity for a certain period. <br>  <br>  Either way, the fact that there's no "tangible proof" (in Scientific terms) of a "Spiritual" side is what causes doubt for some people.|`|Ayn7TqLRaa	everything, both on this planet and in the universe, gets recycled. <br>  <br>  The water you drink has been recycled on the planet for millions and millions of years. The 4 basic elements we're made from: Carbon, nitrogen, oxygen and hydrogen were formed in the centres of long dead stars and the heavier elements (heavier then iron) were born in the explosions of supernovas. Tie in the with the law of "Energy can neither be destroyed nor created" and it would seem to point that "soul recycling" would be quite normal and in line with how the universe works.<br>  <br>  Some spiritualists believe that we choose to return in a physical form because only can we learn lessons (cause and effects) in the physical world and not in the spiritual realm. However they do state about a three generation rule ~ eg you cannot re-incarnate until 3 generations have died, so you cannot become your own grandchild. Interestingly when people have been regressed they usually seem to have last born in the mid to late nineteenth century which would confirm this point.<br>  Also they state that any birth marks on your body are a result of how you died in your previous life.<br>  <br>  It would answer why some young people seem to have "old heads on young shoulders" (old souls), and there are some really stupid old people (young souls). Another indicator of the age of your soul seems to be how much trauma you have in your life and how you deal with it. Young souls choose to have fairly simple trouble free lives, whilst older souls go for the really hard demanding lives (they need to push and test themselves)<br>  <br>  it could all be poppycock but it does seem to have a grain of truth to it|`|a86b00a34071a148706217d85f7cfcedaa	I shall not read the other answers until I send mine to you.  <br>  Of course there is an afterlife..this is the reason we Christians so bemoan atheists and agnostics denial of God.  <br>  We do not hate you all, we want you to share in heaven with us.  There are two choices for the soul, heaven or hell.<br>  Scripture says ( regarding reincarnation) It is appointed for man but once to live , then comes his judgement...this absolutely negates any coming back or living again thoughts.<br>  Ok, knowing this I have my own theory pertaining to dejavue...I believe it is collective memories.<br>  In this mysterious brain..with talents inherited, looks, characteristics, even gestures..is it so improbable that memories could be passed on as well?<br>  What about child prodigys?  What if a bunch of memories just dumped on them in the womb?<br>  And I think that when man was starting to populate the earth these inherited memories were very important to survival.  As was ( to me) the seventh sense, one of intuition...today called psychic.  I think it was vital for people to be able to sense when not to go somewhere or when to go.  <br>  Most everyone I know can "pay attention" to this intuition and develope it within their own minds.

Read the question over@!!<br>  <br>  In general the bible has nothing to do with transsexuality. It was not known at that time that this is a form of birth defect not some aberration of sexual orientation. Is it wrong for anyone to correct a birth defect? No, simply because when the men who wrote the bible, (not Jesus or god) they knew nothing of the future of our world. After all they thought the world was flat and to speak otherwise was hersey. <br>  What is done by a true or primary transsexual is to correct natures error to the best of medical sciences ability and to render them as close to whole as possible. This has nothing to do with the bible and so is a medical issue. <br>  In so far as intersexed individuals if you wish to think of it in a clear way consider that god does not discriminate, he loves us all.

The most important thing about the Jains is that they are COMPLETELY non-violent.<br>  <br>  They have a similar version of Karma to Hinduism, believe in reincarnation (I think) and believe that liberation from reincarnation (enlightenment) is attained by ridding bad Karma through good actions and through extreme ascetic practices (almost self-harm!)<br>  <br>  EDIT: not only <laughs> I didn't mention insects.  I do know that Jains see Karma as a 'sticky substance' that adheres to the soul, which is why one's Karma in one life can affect the next.  Some people see Jainism as another Hindu sect (which I think is unjustified because the Jain god pantheon is different).|`|hzMpdFFBaa	Jainism is a spiritual philosophy that emerged shortly before Buddhism and probably influenced it.  Its principle leader/founder is called Mahavir (Great Hero) and iconographic images of him are often mistaken for images of the Buddha. Elements of the philosophy include strict ahimsa (non-harm) to other living beings. They are strict vegetarians. Jainism technically is atheistic (like Buddhism), which does not mean that Jains or Buddhists do not believe in gods; they do, but their definition of what a god is differs from the idea in western monotheistic religion. They are categorized as atheistic because they do not believe that a supreme godhead  is the cause of the manifestation of everything. They believe in the soul and that individual souls exist eternally and are subject to the law of karma.They share some scriptures with Hinduism.|`|febe0c6287fa510d6fa3bec8bbe5201daa	They sweep the ground in front of them so they won't step on a bug.<br>  <br>  Evolution is a cartload of nonsense and everyone knows it.

Kaballah is about being open to receive gifts from God.  The ultimate gift is 'unity' (becoming one with God)... that's the aim of Kaballah.  Kaballah practitioners try to increase their ego (their sense of 'self', their willingness to accept gifts) in order to be able to receive that gift of unity.  They do believe in reincarnation, they believe that each iteration one becomes 'better' and closer to God until, eventually, they can achieve that goal of unity.  It's similar to brahmanism I suppose, except Kaballah comes from a different region (has its roots with Judaism and can be thought of as a mystic branch of Judaism, although most Kaballah practitioners prefer to see it as a separate religion).  So, summary: aim of Kaballah, increase the sense of ego.<br>  <br>  You also asked about Jainism.  Jains also believe in reincarnation.  They are EXTREMELY non-violent.  Jains believe that Karma is a 'sticky substance' that adheres to their soul (which transmigrates upon death to a new body... reincarnation).  The aim of Jainism is to rid themselves of the sense of 'ego', the sense of 'self' and to get rid of 'negative Karma'.  There are many extreme ascetic practices in Jainism (like starving oneself, burning oneself or otherwise causing oneself harm) aimed at reducing/destroying the ego.  So, summary: aim of Jainism, decrease the sense of ego.<br>  <br>  The two are VERY different extremes in that respect.  I myself go for the 'middle way'.  I am a Buddhist.<br>  <br>  EDIT: looks like the original question is back: <a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;_ylt=AmZtHH8raDuJ9Qn_QapXJlPsy6IX;_ylv=3?qid=20090223035300AAfefHm&show=7#profile-info-s6qgkfLxaa">http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;...</a>|`|t3lDmZLXaa	You should follow the religion called RAISINETTEISM, which will contain all your above stated beliefs.....<br>  <br>  I am in........tell me where to get converted????<br>  <br>  Ha!

So you are probably unlikely to find a spiritual home in any religion because there will always be something irrelevant or with which you don't agree. Follow your own path; you don't have to subscribe to a particular package in order to be religious.<br>  <br>  Having said all that you might want to try the Quakers. Quaker theology rejects written creeds and dogmas on the basis that religion has to be based on personal experience. Quakerism is rooted in Christianity but the more liberal provinces like Britain are very open to religious insights from all faiths and put a high value on personal religious conviction over conformity to specific beliefs or behaviours.|`|ubsq8O8Baa	this is what Jesus preached "love your neighbors as you love yourself". if this is practiced then there is no need to have any kind of religion practice that needs to be followed.|`|WfoirozKaa	Have you investigated the unitarians or the sea of faith people?|`|ukASnhn5aa	I never realize how contorted a human mind can be.<br>  Religion is evolving!

He refers to his followers (in the New Testament manuscripts) as the 'Ebiones' (usually translated as 'the poor' to avoid awkward questions), and Josephus refers to them as 'Essenes'; the customs of wearing white, living frugally in communities, holding money in common, obeying the Torah and following a way of life emphasising spiritual preparation and development are common both to the Essenes and Jesus' followers of The Way.<br>  <br>  In addition, Jesus shows the qualities of a Jain Tirthankara, or 'Keeper of the Way', and demonstrates many of the principles of Jainism, including non-violence ('Ahimsa'), forgiveness of karma ('Samvara'), attention to the causes of Karma ('Asrava'), virtue ('Punya') and liberation from worldly bondage ('Moksha'), which are not part of Jewish tradition (or if they are, they are not widely publicised).

His followers lived by the Essene principles of frugality, cleanliness and having all possessions in common (including their money, looked after by Judas), and despite not being a Pharisee or Sadducee Jesus was recognised as a 'rabbi', a knowledgeable teacher of Judaic law.

0aN1xIxfaa	They've missed the boat, or - rather - the truck. Nessie was an elephant swimming near the Loch side with its trunk raised aloft. It was part of a circus on the move (to Inverness) way back in the 1900s, the convoy having a rest stop on a hot day. The circus owner used the photograph of the elephant bathing to start the hoax, offering a reward, knowing that this would cause tourists to flock to the area. And once they'd wasted a few hours staring over nearby Loch Ness, they'd go to Inverness for refreshments / accommodation, spot the circus and call in. Shrewd business move.|`|m3f0Pa5oaa	I think Nessie's been there as long as the loch, and I hope she'll stay for a long, long time more.  As for cameras and sonar - the loch itself will handle those.  It's so dense there's not much chance of catching anything.  And I'll bet she's got some human defenders there, too, who see that the actual "hunting" is kept to a minimum.  Goodness knows she has quite a fan club around the world.|`|AA11593134	yes, I was wondering the same thing. With the advances in technology, we can at least put 24 hour surveillance cameras everywhere at the Loch... and I know they had sonar detectors that would scan under the water surface... then there is the unmanned submergible devices (remote controlled) and we can equip it with video cameras... or put motion detectors, video cameras underwater??? There are several ways...<br>  then there's the draining the lake... I'm sure they can do that, too... But no one has done any of these yet...|`|K3gEmRc0aa	OMG Nessy!

There was this kid of 21, 22 years who had been around the World on foot- some nonsense like that- from Pole-to Pole- DIED in a mountain climbing accident that managed to kill another stupid *oyinbo* along with him. People live out their lives at the foot of all these mountains, and never once think of climbing them, and die peacefully in their beds. These people are held up as "ignorant." "Dull." "Boring."<br>  <br>  They MINDED THEIR BUSINESS and died of OLD AGE.<br>  <br>  The White race cannot find that there is a new mountain, they have to go climb it, "becausse it's There." if they find that there is a a new, undiscovered animal, they have to send someone out- there is a RACE actually, to find out WHO CAN KILL IT FIRST! The DODO could have been a better food source than the chicken. We'll never know, because the first whites to find them SCOFFED THE LOT.<br>  <br>  JOURNEY TO IXTLAN depicts the dumbest attitude of the White race pitted against the commonsense spirituality of the Red Man. In Chapter 7 "BEING INACCESSIBLE," Don Juan taught Carlos Castaneda how to make a trap, and caught five quail. Don Juan tried to educate Dr. Castaneda by letting three of the quail go. Carlos complained that they would have had a much better feast if they had killed and eaten all five quail. Does anyone remember that he was a Hispanic Roman Catholic? Lapsed, perhaps, but this is the sort of attitude they grow up with!<br>  <br>  Don Juan was aghast, and said that had they committed such an atrocity, they never would have left the area intact. The entire environment, including the quail and the shrubs, he explained, would have militated together to GET THEM. Needless to say, Dr. Carlos Castaneda thought this concept ridiculous.<br>  <br>  Spiritual Persons know that they are Answerable to Higher Powers, and are dependent on Esoteric Principles. The Ignorant just blunder into things any old how, like the proverbial bull in a China shop. They are causing so much gross damage, that they cannot notice the subtletries that are lost, and think their mishaps "normal." <br>  <br>  For instance, the White man gets a headache, because certain attiudes he has led to behavior where he has offended against Spiritual Law- did things against people and animals he KNOWS are WRONG- cheats in business deals, lies to his government, cheats on his wife, is a litterbug, and so on- but does them anyway and the Reaction is trying to KILL him. The headache is merely the first syptom of his beleaguered body's failing defenses. Does he AMEND his life? God forbid! He takes a couple of aspirin, and forgets about it. As the pain increases, he takes more aspirin.<br>  <br>  When he dies younger than he should, or in worse condition is necessary, the doctors will diagnose some stupid "cause," "angina," "coronarary," "heart attack," and such rubbish. This is like saying that accidents are caused by "brakes failing," "slippery roads," or "speeding." When there is an attitude that is the real cause- refusal to check the status of the car, failure to exercise caution. Arrogant presumption that "accidents" only happen to OTHER people, "not oneself."<br>  <br>  Were it ieasy to get to the Loch Ness creature, Whites would have killed it long ago. They have no idea what this being really is, but their opening probe would be to SHOOT it. It has never hurt anything- they could never even get close to it- but they WILL attempt to injure it FIRST. <br>  <br>  NO WAY would they ever CONSIDER that MAYBE this creature, whatever it is COULD EXTERMINATE our arrogant behinds off the face of the Earth? This is a thought too far above the heads of many of our godless cerebrally challenged readers. Let us break it down to a level you could understand: What if it contains a virus that, once it gets into the Human species- some idiot eating it, or making a "vaccine" out of it- like they did qwith AIDS- ANDROMEDA STRAIN extincts us off the Planet? That is not the only way the Loch Ness could fatally affect our race, but it is just one that anyone can comprehend.|`|vBIwaQ0qaa	Like Big Foot, some have seen him, some haven't.

She wasn't.<br>  <br>  Her first time for having sex was after having married Joseph. There is no law against God making anyone pregnant in the Bible or otherwise.  He has the right to do that any time he wants.  Of course, this only was needed one time. <br>  <br>  Since God had caused Jesus' transfer to Mary's womb, and since Jesus in the eyes of all, had Joseph and Mary as parents, this scripture would not apply.<br>  <br>  The scripture above in the AB has this rendering:<br>  "One born of a harlot shall not enter into the assembly of the Lord."<br>  DRC says this: "A mamzer, that is to say, one born of a prostitute, shall not enter into the church of the Lord, until the tenth generation."<br>  <br>  You really want to call Mary a harlot to God, and Christ's face?<br>  You are giving the unforgivable sin, blasphemy of the holy spirit, a good go here, you know.|`|CueEJOVFaa	I'm not surprised that an atheist would slur God by using swear words.

We know that abused children abuse their children and it is possible that it could travel 10 generations. A child needs to be born of love and loved afterwards. This is a warning that parents should love their children. The Catholic church created the marriage ceremony. Before this, people would do a feast or a claim but it was different than today. Jesus was definitely born of love. Take Hitler, he was an abused child and he was a bastard (evil) but his parents were married. See how the word took it's logical course.|`|c2fc70c8196fb6665f4605b33bcc57a4aa	when Deuteronomy was written, Jesus already existed alongside his Father in the heavens...<br>  (Proverbs 8:22-31) “Jehovah himself produced me as the beginning of his way, the earliest of his achievements of long ago. 23?From time indefinite I was installed, from the start, from times earlier than the earth. 24?When there were no watery deeps I was brought forth as with labor pains, when there were no springs heavily charged with water. 25?Before the mountains themselves had been settled down, ahead of the hills, I was brought forth as with labor pains, 26?when as yet he had not made the earth and the open spaces and the first part of the dust masses of the productive land. 27?When he prepared the heavens I was there; when he decreed a circle upon the face of the watery deep, 28?when he made firm the cloud masses above, when he caused the fountains of the watery deep to be strong, 29?when he set for the sea his decree that the waters themselves should not pass beyond his order, when he decreed the foundations of the earth, 30?then I came to be beside him as a master worker, and I came to be the one he was specially fond of day by day, I being glad before him all the time, 31?being glad at the productive land of his earth, and the things I was fond of were with the sons of men.<br>  <br>  The scripture applies to people with two UNMARRIED parents...|`|AA11502346	Apparently you missed the boat on this.

I don't agree. Can you settle this?<br>  <br>  Leviticus 20:20 states that I may not approach the altar of God if I have a defect in my sight. I have to admit that I wear reading glasses.

The Bible God BRAINWASHES his chosen people to kill and cook their own children for dinner...!!!  <br>  <br>  The Bible writers created the story of the Jewish God that is worshipped by gullible Christians today mainly in America. This God forced the Jews to eat their own children for dinner NOT AS A PUNISHMENT, but as an option in times of famine. Not even as an option, but as the “WILL OF GOD!” God NEVER objected about slaughtering and cooking children for dinner. God won’t let the Jews eat pigs, but children YES! The Preachers always cover up anything negative about the Bible God! I dropped out of Christianity and religion after many years serving in the Christian ministry! ANY preacher today has to be very dishonest not to admit any of these facts! The Bible was written to control low IQ religious people who need to pay a 10% (TITHE) crutch to function in this world. Any religion back then was as barbaric as you can’t possibly imagine. The Bible is a hangover from those days... Rather recently America became officially ONE NATION UNDER GOD and IN GOD WE TRUST under Christian pressure after the collapse of the US gold monetary system! <br>  <br>  This Bible God is totally powerless to teach any lesson without FORCING the Jews to eat their own children for dinner. The Bible writers say that Palestine was a “Land Flowing with Milk and Honey” ONLY before the Israelite invasion. The former dwellers used to live in plenty! After the invasion SURPRISE!!! suddenly the “milk and honey” stopped flowing! So now the Bible writers are promising to Israel that “God will make the desert to blossom like a rose!” The perennial carrot hanging at the end of the stick is working!<br>  <br>  God’s sadistic pleasures are the kinkiest ones ever to be imagined! None of the “Godless” dictators in the world EVER thought of forcing his people to eat their own children for dinner...! That is so repulsive that no smut publication is publishing anything like that either, but any pervert preacher can discreetly enjoy reading all about it in the Holy Bible! The rest of Christians are totally brainwashed with the GOD IS LOVE bit! No wonder the Clergy hid the Bible from public view for so many centuries! To their great relief hardly any Christian today pays attention to what they read in the Bible! <br>  <br>  Leviticus 26:29 - (God is impatiently saying) YOU WILL eat the flesh of your sons and the flesh of your daughters* (*without warning of any evil! Christians are trained to believe that no matter how pervert it may sound “if God says it I believe it… and that settles it!”)<br>  <br>  Deuteronomy 28:53-57 - Because of the suffering that your enemy will inflict on you during the siege* (*God is conditioning the mind of the Israelites 700 Bible years into the future! In our society today anybody promoting the idea of any crime like that is put in jail!), YOU WILL EAT THE FRUIT OF THE WOMB, THE FLESH OF THE SONS AND DAUGHTERS the LORD your God has given you* (*God WILL NOT do anything to protect the innocent children, but his chosen people will enjoy eating them…! Praise the LORD! Sweet Jesus… Amen?) Even the most gentle and sensitive man* (*not a sinful homosexual or a Godless atheist, but a CHOSEN CHILD OF GOD!) among you will have no compassion on his own brother or the wife he loves or his SURVIVING children, and he will not give to one of them any of the flesh of his children that he is eating…* (*according to the Bible writers, not sharing is “THE SIN”! Only religious perverts can dream on feeding on their own children for ever!)<br>  <br>  Jeremiah 19:9 I* (*God, NOT SATAN, but GOD!) WILL MAKE THEM EAT THE FLESH OF THEIR SONS AND DAUGHTERS* (This sick God has to FORCE the Jews to eat their own children! During the real historic Roman siege of “Masada” [do Google] all the Jewish families killed themselves before even dreaming about eating their own children!)<br>  <br>  God won’t force the Jews to eat PIGS, but their own children YES! The Bible writers say that when the 666 mark will be instituted Christians won’t be able to buy or sell food without it. Based on Bible precedents, will the heart bleeding Christians of the Westboro orientation eat their own children for dinner? Christians would deny it or say that if God forced the Jews to do it, it was because they were very “sinful”!<br>  <br>  Ezekiel 5:10 - Therefore in your midst fathers WILL EAT THEIR CHILDREN...<br>  <br>  Any secular government would offer its citizens better protection than the Bible God. They would certainly allow them to eat pork instead of children! It took Moses 2 men to carry a single bunch of gigantic size grapes to show Israel how plentiful was the Land of Palestine that they were going to invade (Num 13:23)! Actually that was just another trick in the Bible script to motivate well fed Jews into COVETING* (*the heck with the 10 Commands!) to leave Egypt and to invade the Holy Land. (BTW, there is not a shred of historical evidence that millions of slave Jews ever lived in Egypt or that they ever ate their children!) Now the Jews can eat their own children in the Holy Land for God’s kinky pleasure! Actually, for the pleasure of wanking Bible writers and some freaky Bible readers today!<br>  <br>  Lamentations 4:10 - With their own hands COMPASSIONATE WOMEN* (*GODLY WOMEN…! Not lesbians or atheistic ladies, but “MANY” God loving heterosexual ladies) HAVE COOKED THEIR OWN CHILDREN...!<br>  <br>  Here is a case in FULL EXPLICIT CONTEXT in the Bible that is IMPOSSIBLE for any Preacher to “spiritualize” and make it go away!<br>  <br>  2 Kings 6:26-29 As the king of Israel was passing by on the wall, a woman cried to him, “Help me, my lord the king* (*a God related King)!” The king replied, “If the Lord does not help you, where can I get help for you? Then he asked her, “What's the matter?” She answered, “This woman said to me, ‘Give up your son so we may eat him today, and tomorrow we'll eat my son.’ So we cooked my son and ate him* (*BTW… it came out delicious!!!). The next day I said to her, ‘Give up your son so we may eat him, but she had hidden him!* (*God cursed woman! She cheated!) <br>  <br>  They were all COMPASSIONATE Godly, non-Atheistic, heterosexual women that HAVE SLAUGHTERED AND COOKED THEIR OWN CHILDREN FOR DINNER at the tune of “The LORD is my Shepherd I shall not want” (Psa 23)!<br>  <br>  Isaiah 49:15 “Can a mother forget the baby at her breast and have no compassion on the child she has borne?

The Romans never dressed the genitals of their victims with a diaper! The Christians need to snack his ROMAN SPIT FLAVORED MEAT AND DRINK HIS HOLY BLOOD to go to Heaven when they die!

God the Father forced Israel to eat their children for dinner now God the Son Jesus Christ promised to kill the children in the wrong Churches so they can learn a lesson on WHO IS THE BOSS and to add insult to injury, preachers are getting rich selling books on Jesus’ love for the little children of the world! Today, Jesus Christ would be in jail for bullying about killing any child to favor a particular brand of faith!) Then ALL THE CHURCHES WILL KNOW that I am he who searches hearts and minds, and I will repay each of you according to your deeds.* (*I’m the BOSS says Jesus Christ ON BEHALF OF PREACHERS! Not even the Mafia talks like that in public!)<br>  <br>  Romans 15:4 (Saint Paul says) For EVERYTHING that was written in the past* (*Old Testament) was written to teach us* (*Christians!)<br>  <br>  Today Christians don’t believe that! Christianity is one of the most DISHONEST religions in the world second only to Islam! The Bible is a selection of many books written by wanking perverts! If you have a respectable IQ you ought to know what any religion is all about! I know your first impulse is to REPORT ME! Honest Christians ought to share this post with their spiritual leaders and demand an intelligent answer. Let them be assured that I am not the anti-Christ, or the Devil, or Mickey Mouse, I am just Joe Blow down the street!

Knowing that the words "murder" and "killing" mean two different things makes a difference.<br>  <br>  When God had the enemies of the Israelites killed, it was done justly. To stop their evil doing. To stop them from killing God's people. To stop them from training their sons to doing evil as they grow up.  Many times we see that God protected His choosen people by sending them to lands were they would be safe and to protect them from murderers.<br>  <br>  It shows me that God is serious about His people and that He'll do anything for them.<br>  <br>  The great flood killed of all men and women except Noah and his family.  They were idol worshippers, pagans, sinners, orgies goers, murderers, etc.  Sodom and Gomorrah were cites full of sexual sinners.|`|NLinPsyhaa	Murder is the taking of innocent life. There is a difference between murder and God's justice. Is murder justified when done in the name of God? Not always. The inquisition is a good example. That was murder. Same with what the radical Muslims are doing. Murder in the Bible is also described as having hatred towards another. But the taking of lives by God is only done by His justice. so now the question is can we know the difference? Yes. Read the story of the Exodus and Sodom and Gomorrah.|`|i6d582PFaa	all phenomenon are characterized as impermanent (nicca), suffering (dukkha), and selfless (anatta). From craving arises all forms of suffering (dukkha). The cessation of craving (nirvana) is freedom from suffering. <br>  <br>  The twelve interlinked chain of causes (paticcasamuppáda) represent the suffering in the material world (samsara). Liberation (nibbana/nirvana) is achieved in two ways: by turning away from the 5 temporal khandas of form (rupa), feelings, perceptions, experience, and consciousness (vinnanna). And turning towards the light (citta) which is one's true self (Attan) and is equal to the absolute (paranibbana/Atta/Samma/). This absolute is the mind and will (citta) liberated (nirvana) from suffering (dukkha). <br>  <br>  The mind and will can be represented as will and power. The will to do something and the power to do it. Without both of these, an objective can not be accomplished. And so with mind and will dependent on each other (vinnanna) the entire field of consciousness arises. Mind and will or cravings upon an object or form (rupa). The mind in this instance is empirical consciousness, but once it turns away from the 5 skandhas is an unestablished consciousness (nirvana). At that point the mind and will (citta) is equal to final liberation (paranibbana).|`|4068ddb702bdc41558e963e223abc40eaa	Not positive.<br>  <br>  The murder comes from distortion of religion, not from the real thing.

KVirP3bsaa	Yes. It is very superstitious to believe any individuals can see into the future.<br>  <br>  It's easy to see their motivation for writing self fulfilling and vague prophecies tho, it brings gullible believers closer to believing "prophets" have special powers/knowledge and that they should accept their other claims. Out of the 2,000 some supposed prophecies in the bible, each with many thousands of possible ways to be fulfilled, based on chance alone some would appear to come true. It's like going to a "psychic", let them cold read long enough and they will get a hit.|`|WyICbuPqaa	There are modern examples of fulfilled prophecy.<br>  <a href="http://www.jefflindsay.com/LDSFAQ/FQ_prophecies.shtml" rel="nofollow">http://www.jefflindsay.com/LDSFAQ/FQ_pro...</a><br>  <br>  My favorite is the prophecy that Joseph Smith gave to Dr. Richards.  He told Dr. Richards that the day would come when bullets would rain down on him like hail, and people would fall on his right and on his left, but that he wouldn't even get a hole in his clothing.  It literally came to pass a year later as a mob of over two hundred men shot their guns into the dining room where Dr. Richards and others were eating.<br>  <br>  Why the thumbs down?  Don't you know that the truth shall set you free?|`|ahOBiGSzaa	Prophecy is not the same.   a prophecy is a prediction of something. There is a prophecy that Jesus will someday return to earth.

AA12006309	There is a very distinct difference between "marriage" and "holy matrimony", by definition.<br>  <br>  The term "holy matrimony" is the term used by the church and religious institutions to connote the union of a man and a woman under the eyes of God.<br>  <br>  The term "marriage" evolved in the fourteenth century as a form of legal contract between two consenting adults.<br>  <br>  The Religious groups do not hold the patent on what a marriage is and isn't.  They did not create the concept, as much as they would like to think they did.  The idea of a union of this type existed long before the Bible was written, long before there were Christians to be so uppity about it.<br>  <br>  I'm putting links to an article below from Newsweek that puts the argument better than I ever could. I hope you enjoy it.|`|wSeOxs7Jaa	Civil unions never grant all the same rights as marriage. If you compare the rights granted by civil unions in any state that has them there are literally hundreds or rights that married people have that people in civil unions don't. And if you were to make them legally identical then whats the point of having different names for them? Why single out one section of the population like that? Marriage is a civil institution not a religious one. And what about religious denominations that do believe in gay marriage? Why are there beliefs less important that those of anti-gay religious people. Everyone should have the same rights, period. And as far and asking for less so we don't make religious bigots angry - well you don't get a whole loaf by asking for half of one. You don't even get half a loaf.|`|aYVVwjBXaa	i agree, civil unions are just as good as marriage and don't infringe on the non-secular rights of religious groups.<br>  <br>  i also think civil unions should be made legal for straight couples too, since not all of them are religious.|`|aHLnNrOGaa	Haven't they tried 'Separate but equal' in the past... and it didn't work?|`|h7Uz7oN5aa	That's right, marriages and civil unions are not the same thing.  Since civil unions are only granted and, for the most part, even recognized in the state they occur in at least 1,049 legal protections and responsibilities are not granted from the federal government.  I mean we're talking taxes, social security benefits, Family and Medical Leave Act benefits, the right to make medical decisions for your spouse, etc.<br>  <br>  Even if civil unions were granted in all states and federally-recognized, those people who entered into it would still consider themselves maried and would refer to the other person as their spouse (husband/wife).  It would be exactly the same thing as what heterosexual couples have, so what are we really arguing here?  I mean if heterosexuals would "allow" gays to have a civil union which mirror marriage in every way except the body parts of the individual involved then what are those people really arguing about?  Who has the "right" to use the word marriage?  So be it.  Seems petty to me but, hey, if the ends justify the means......<br>  <br>  “What's in a name? That which we call a rose<br>  By any other name would smell as sweet.”<br>  <br>  William Shakespeare|`|uLHCY6Qmaa	What an excellent question! I'm an old queen. I don't think it makes any difference as long as there really is no difference between the two things civilly. But some folks just got to have the word marriage to describe it. They won't call it anything else. Isn't it time to re-define these "words" as exactly the same thing civilly? Let's think up something new to call them! One word to describe both! (That's a whole other question, but I ain't gonna ask it! lol)<br>  Auntie Kookoo|`|CqddTJKfaa	Because there would be no point in naming it something else if its the same as marriage.<br>  <br>  Marriages don't HAVE to be religious.

Once happy feelings become the purpose for living, how can we limit it to not hurting others if hurting others brings pleasure?  Once we put feelings in control, reason is no longer in control.  If reason is in control, we're not hedonists.

So did our solar system space its full of high energy stars so I think the big bang is a theory of how a solar system originally starts to form not life in all of the universe.   <br>  <br>     Religion has proven to be Dangerous and the abandonment of illogical beliefs is the key to human survival. I watched something with Kirk Cameron called The way of the master its a religious group with a notion that claims evolution has no merit and scientifically a creator is much more likely or factual. They use lame examples like they called an airline asking if they could bring a relative on the plane and of course he was a oranguatan they airline said we couldnt bring animals in flight but they rebuddled with but he is my cousin my relative, see my point? You see we just are smarter we use logic think about things and are motto is we dont know everything but the most probable conclsuion is that their was no creator of any living thing on this planet.<br>  <br>  I ask any religious figure this one question why do they promote moral teachings with fear tactics? Even that program The way of the Master<br>  used fear tactics for example. The came out as they have proof science is wrong and it used rational explanation to explain themselves but.. Then they went on about being saved how many people out there  arent currently saved thats crazy. Religion uses fear tactics if you have ever looked at a women with lust told a lie your a sinner and need to be saved thats a joke. If we have an agenda its to make people realize religion is a lie they use reverse physchology teach love thy neighbor dont steal but fear god! This makes people think about what their doing in life living in fear of god on a everyday basisis isnt sane. Most beleivers devote their Faith to religion just like the Lottery if you dont believe you will not be saved so might as well play it safe right. So in the lotto you cant win if you dont play its just a dollar. In fact the lotto touts if your  not in you cant win see the similarietes  here?|`|HLdV3PWKaa	i belive it is based on fear of the possible, people fear god may be real, he may be the begining and the end. they are afarid that if they belive in god all the things they feel bad about that they have done in their lives will will send them to hell because they refused god and jesus in their lives|`|gg2NFlNZaa	there is no hate in atheism.

We accept Jesus/Yeshua as that sacrifice and covering of sin,<br>   Chapter 9 of Hebrews explains the blood further, the veil and offerings of sin.<br>     We escape the world to make tribute and seek the Lord. Thge blood covering gives us grace and the poresence of God at times when we ask of the Lord to apply the blood of Christ.<br>    We do not eat of the blood but by the wine symbology and complete translation.|`|VHa5PIfpaa	It already HAS been lifted and already HAS been made new.  All things have been made expedient unto people for eating. Gentiles are now able to be saved through the grace of God and the blood of Jesus Christ shed at Calvary...

Jesus took care of all that and made it sooooooo dead easy to get to HEAVEN that only the stupid and the set in their ways should ever even CONSIDER going to Hell!
CueEJOVFaa	It seems to refer to Gentiles. What you said about Gentiles never hearing Jesus' voice is actually not true; the Gospels say that Jesus performed some healings and taught a little in Gentile territory (e.g. the feeding of the four thousand in Mark 8; the healing of the demoniac in Mark 5; the healing of the Canaanite woman's daughter in Matthew 15). While the people of Israel were Jesus' focus during his earthly ministry, that doesn't mean that he never ventured out into Gentile territory.|`|hQDapmICaa	you are confused. Jesus was referring to the Gentiles. Please don't confuse yourself and others.<br>  <br>  Peace!<br>  <br>  <br>  Luk 10:16  He that heareth you heareth me; and he that despiseth you despiseth me; and he that despiseth me despiseth him that sent me.|`|AA12147519	It wasn't indians (or anyone else) in the Americas if that is what you are wondering.<br>  Yes, I believe He was referring to the gentiles.  In Matthew 15:24, Jesus was speaking to a woman from Canaan.  He rebuffed her but she persisted and Jesus granted her request for healing of her child.  She was a gentile and Jesus helped her.|`|GJS3hTK5aa	People other than Jews.|`|ceebbd5b347bf3b3c44701e742d76f97aa	Ok, here are some excepts from an online study guide.<br>  <br>  The "other sheep" are the gentiles. Matt 15:24 only points out that Jesus was originally intended for the Jews. <br>  <br>  My interpretation is that Jesus was not meant to spearate Jews into Christians but to save the Jews.<br>  <br>  God Bless<br>  ---<br>  John 10:16 Study Guide<br>  5. (16) Jesus speaks of other sheep.<br>  <br>  "And other sheep I have which are not of this fold; them also I must bring, and they will hear My voice; and there will be one flock and one shepherd."<br>  <br>  a. Other sheep I have which are not of this fold: These "other sheep" are Gentile believers, not of the fold of Israel.<br>  <br>  b. There is one flock and one shepherd; but Jesus calls His sheep from more than one fold (group of people).<br>  <br>  c. There will be one flock: The early Christian Bible translator Jerome, when translating his influential Latin version mistakenly translated one fold instead of one flock in this verse. His Latin Vulgate reading is the erroneous foundation for a doctrine of Roman Catholic exclusiveness.<br>  ---<br>  Matt  12:24 Study notes <br>  2. (23-28) Jesus heals the Gentile woman’s daughter.<br>  <br>  But He answered her not a word. And His disciples came and urged Him, saying, "Send her away, for she cries out after us." But He answered and said, "I was not sent except to the lost sheep of the house of Israel." Then she came and worshiped Him, saying, "Lord, help me!" But He answered and said, "It is not good to take the children’s bread and throw it to the little dogs." And she said, "Yes, Lord, yet even the little dogs eat the crumbs which fall from their masters’ table." Then Jesus answered and said to her, "O woman, great is your faith! Let it be to you as you desire." And her daughter was healed from that very hour.<br>  <br>  a. I was not sent except to the lost sheep of the house of Israel: Jesus defined the focus of His mission of to this Gentile woman, and makes it clear that He was not sent to Gentiles like her.<br>  <br>  b. Then she came and worshiped Him, saying, "Lord, help me!" The woman provides another picture of a dedicated intercessor by her persistence.<br>  <br>  c. It is not good to take the children’s bread and throw it to the little dogs: When Jesus called her one of the little dogs, He used little as a term of endearment. This softened the traditional Jewish slur towards Gentiles, which called them dogs in the most derogatory sense.<br>  <br>  d. Yes, Lord, yet even the little dogs eat the crumbs which fall from their masters’ table: The woman responds with great faith. She admits her low estate, and did not debate the issue when Jesus called her one of the little dogs. She asked Jesus to deal with her on her own low level - and so she received from Jesus. No wonder Jesus said, O woman, great is your faith!<br>  <br>  i. We need to see the power of coming to God as we are, and let Him make His promise true to the weak and unclean.<br>  <br>  ii. We read of nothing else that Jesus did during this time in Tyre and Sidon. His only divine appointment was to meet the need of this woman of faith and her sick daughter.|`|zBkaqIWcaa	Gentiles, non jew.<br>  <br>  First, some gentiles do had the opportunity to hear the message directly from Jesus, not in great numbers, but some did:<br>  * Romans centurion : Mathew 8, Luke 7<br>  * Samaritans, first a woman, later the whole town.  John 4<br>  * Greeks John 12<br>  * Gentile woman from region of Tyre & Sidon Mark 7<br>  <br>  Who can be sure that in the multitudes that followed Jesus and participated of His message and miracles there were not some non jews.<br>  <br>  Check Mathew 12:15-21 (especially verse 21 but start from verse 15 to get the context.  Jesus fullfilled that prophesy from Isaiah including "And in His name Gentiles will trust."<br>  <br>  Jesus (through the Holy Spirit) sent Philip to preach a goverment official from Ethiopia.  He also leaded Peter to preach to Cornelius, and called Barnaby and Paul to preach the gospel to greeks, romans, etc.  Peter and Mark also traveled up to Babylon, Mathew went down to India.  similary others went to gentile lands to preach the gospel to everybody.|`|kWz0nEdBaa	Notice this verse in John 17:20-21when Jesus prayed for His disciples: "I do not pray for these alone, but also for those who will believe in Me through their word; that they all may be one, as You, Father, are in Me, and I in You, that they also may be one in Us, that the world may believe that You sent Me."|`|B7pxO9dDaa	The Nephites|`|ebRmVByOaa	There are multiple times in the Bible when the Lord would take righteous people and move them somewhere else to escape harm, as a blessing, etc. Some examples are those Moses led out of Egypt (Exodus 3:8), and one might include Noah in this as well (Genesis 6:18). There were others, such as from the Tower of Babel , and before Jerusalem was conquered again around the time of King Zedekiah, when a few of the righteous were led away from the wicked.<br>  <br>  Some were led to the western hemisphere, a "promised land," which explains so many similarities and parallels in ancient western civilization to the cultures of the middle east in those times.<br>  <br>  Not only are there stories in both Native American and hispanic histories that tell of a Great White God visiting the people, but legends passed down through the centuries since then relate that He said he would one day come again, and they still await his Second Coming.<br>  <br>  I don't know how to include a link, but I will put some references below.

There is a pony tail palm tree in a basket hanging off a rafter. An old cast iron bell with a rope hangs from the roof line, and a set of wind chimes with long metal tubes tuned to the key of C hang from the ceiling between the porch and the carport. Under the chimes a potted birds nest fern sits in a stand. On my left I see two metal chairs with big cushions and an oddly shaped table made of a slab of cypress (picked up at a garage sale). There are several bromeliads, air plants, and orchids hanging from the posts and sitting on the table. Sidewalk chalk, two small balls, bubbles, and a Frisbee with an LED light in the center sit waiting to be played with. LED party lights line the rafters on the porch.<br>  <br>  Stepping off the front porch several small lizards, anoles, scurry away from my path. There is huge, 45 year old live oak tree in the front yard. A small patch of grass, which is wilted and brown from recent freezes and lack of rain. A patio covered with flagstones is just below the front porch. A metal table with four chairs (with seat cushions) sits on the patio. There is a 7' metal palm tree with LED rope lights next to the patio. Our habanera pepper bush has two bright orange peppers on it, our other peppers are blooming. The azalea bushes that line both sides of our property are in full bloom; hot pink, light pink, and white blooms abound. The beds of plants and bushes are looking a bit overgrown, but the hodgepodge of plants is interesting. There is a bird feeder hanging from a metal pole in one of the beds and a small concrete bird bath next to it; there is a Cardinal in the feeder and a dove in the birdbath. I can see several other houses from my front porch; along with plenty of trees, people walking their babies or their dogs, cars passing on the street, small planes and helicopters taking off or landing at the general aviation airport 2 miles away; and dozens of birds and bats depending on the time of day.|`|g0gMQUCVaa	The desert and hills.

There is the landscaping I worked so hard on with rocks as border that we spent hours picking up in the fields here on the farm.  Further out in the yard is another small area that I landscaped with a huge rock we dug up at a neighbors farm.  Beyond that is the entrance into our driveway with Pompass grass on each side of the drive and large rocks we've dug up through the years.  (Do you get the feeling that we like rocks at our house?) Across the road is an 60 acre field just waiting for spring planting surrounded on the southern edge by woods.|`|aaCMNSB2aa	A concrete path, between the house and stones, that hooks a left to the driveway. I see the stones with an assortment of shades, all the same color of red on the desert round. There's a tall young tree lightly swaying to and though as if slow dancing with the wind. The sky is filled with dark storm clouds and it's beginning to rain. Little sprinkles are seen fall on the side walk; the water drops quickly vanishes as the parched desert earth absorbs it into the ground. Children are playing in the street; the little girl is spinning around trying to catch rain drops in her mouth. It was the first rain in months.

AA10024451	NOBODY is saved right now. What the Bible teaches on salvation is "he who endures to the end is the one that will be saved". Since the end has not  yet come, there is nobody in a "saved" state, and NOBODY can make a legitimate claim to being "saved". It's that simple. <br>  <br>  But people can, and have, turned around and denied Christ after having been a loyal follower. It happens. It depends on what you mean by "deny Christ". The Bible speaks of an unforgiveable sin, and that is blasphemy against the holy spirit. For individuals guilty of that there is nothing that they can do to repent from it.|`|ewWUFWyWaa	NOT ONLY DENY, but trash Jesus! Flush Jesus down the toiled, too!

Paul mentions this.<br>  <br>  Philippians 3<br>  18?For there are many, I used to mention them often but now I mention them also with weeping, who are walking as the enemies of the torture stake of the Christ, 19?and their finish is destruction, and their god is their belly, and their glory consists in their shame, and they have their minds upon things on the earth. <br>  <br>  <br>  Paul also wrote to the Hebrews this warning.<br>  <br>  26?For if we practice sin willfully after having received the accurate knowledge of the truth, there is no longer any sacrifice for sins left, 27?but [there is] a certain fearful expectation of judgment and [there is] a fiery jealousy that is going to consume those in opposition. 28?Any man that has disregarded the law of Moses dies without compassion, upon the testimony of two or three. 29?Of how much more severe a punishment, do YOU think, will the man be counted worthy who has trampled upon the Son of God and who has esteemed as of ordinary value the blood of the covenant by which he was sanctified, and who has outraged the spirit of undeserved kindness with contempt? 30?For we know him that said: “Vengeance is mine; I will recompense”; and again: “Jehovah will judge his people.” 31?It is a fearful thing to fall into the hands of [the] living God.<br>  <br>  So, it would be unusual for someone who has gone to these extremes to repent.

God bless.|`|1ec32bd76f3584208ce83bf42928a21faa	No.  When you were saved it was the Holy Spirit who helped you to confess in faith that Jesus Christ was your Lord and Savior (1 Corinthians 12:3).  Just as in the natural birth once you are born you cannot make yourself to be unborn.  It is the same in the spiritual birth.  The Holy Spirit will not help you to deny Christ or to do anything detrimental to yourself.  We indeed have a very good God.  Of course if you have not been helped by the Holy Spirit to confess faith in Jesus Christ you are not truly born again.

In that respect`, we are not honoring God's preference.<br>  <br>  There's grief when a loved one has left, but we can only hope that that person will be resurrected to glory with us saints later on.

God does not hear every prayer, Dear. <br>  <br>  Secondly. NO one, I repeat no one can confess and repent for another person. Dead or alive. Our walk with the Father is OUR walk.<br>  <br>   You can not pray to God to redeem another person. Either when they are alive, or when they are dead.. Whatever They did with the Lord is on their shoulders. You can not come back after the fact and repent for another person. You can not come back after the fact and do anything to make another persons walk with the Lord any different. Each person will stand before God and explain themselves, ALONE. And you won`t be there to explain for them.. <br>  <br>  Each persons relationship with Dad is personal and private. We are responsible for what we do in life and no other person can pray for anyone else to be saved after they have passed on. THEY ARE ALREADY WITH THE FATHER............ They are already before him. It is too late and certainly futile for you to think you can do anything to change it.. <br>  <br>  The Bible tells us that we are all in need of forgiveness from God. We have all committed sin. Ecclesiastes 7:20 proclaims, “There is not a righteous man on earth who does what is right and never sins.” 1 John 1:8 says, “If we claim to be without sin, we deceive ourselves and the truth is not in us.” All sin is ultimately an act of rebellion against God (Psalm 51:4). As a result, we desperately need God’s forgiveness. If our sins are not forgiven, we will spend eternity suffering the consequences of our sins (Matthew 25:46; John 3:36).<br>  <br>  <br>  The 1st Prayer that God hears from you is the Sinners Prayer.. If the person you are praying for does not know God here. He doesn`t know them there.. <br>  Jesus says many call me by my name, and I know them not..<br>  <br>  Jesus Himself tells us why: “For God so loved the world, that he gave his only Son, that ***whoever believes in him*** should not perish but have eternal life. For God did not send his Son into the world to condemn the world, but in order that the world might be saved through him” (John 3:16-17). God saw us as we were, dead in our sin. That’s why Jesus came. God is a forgiving God whose love and patience call all to repent of their sins.<br>  <br>  If they did not believe in Jesus, they are not covered under his blood. They are not saved unless they believe. You can NOT believe for them.. You  can not make them righteous. You can not save them. You can not pray them to be saved. It doesn`t work like that..|`|FFqWeIX7aa	But you claim that he does not accept prayers for departed spirits; he does not like us to submit prayers through saints; he does not like us honoring and remembering saints and he does not like us to baptize children to unite them with Jesus! <br>  <br>  REMEBER, IN BIBLE, SAUL ARE CURSED BY GOD BECAUSE CONTACTING SAMUEL by telepathy...<br>  <br>  Isn't it like Muslims claiming that God can not become a man and Jesus can not be crucified? <br>  <br>  =Nothing related=<br>  <br>  While the truth is, everything done with true faith and love are accepted by God and apart from love, nothing can influence God. No true human being can desist himself from praying for his loved ones who have departed from this world. Since he does not know their after death state, how can he deny his urge to pray for them? Is God so selfish to turn his face away for such sincere prayers made out of love? I recommend you to use your common sense a little.<br>  <br>  Catholic are the one who didn't use common sense, <br>  Do you think God will accept people praying through the saints and idols?<br>  <br>  Excuse me, the saints are "living idols", and God FORBID idols. <br>  <br>  There is no difference btwn those who pray through Saints and Pagan Arab that pray through their Latta, Uzza, Manat (Saints too)...<br>  <br>  <br>  =)
ZRuJFoUIaa	I couldn't agree with you more, Evolution is not just an attack, But a specific attack on the God of the bible, And the religious fervor in which believers in evolution defend their religion  /philosophy is a very good indication of that, Think about it, Any good scientist, Welcomes opposing view points or new information, That's the very means by which science advances, But with evolution for some reason, They seem to refuse any new information or opposing view points, Defending it the way a mother hen defends her chicks. God bless.|`|iXI7n6Gmaa	Well in Islam, although we strongly reject that Man originated from Apes, however it is not completely rejected that there were stages of evolution for some form of creations. Also Islam does not negate the idea that there were certain creatures who had similarity to the Humans in certain ways in the past very old history.<br>  Because when God told the Angels that He is going to create Man, Angels were concerned why would God create Man that will cause corruption on Earth. It seems Angels have been aware of previous similar creatures that made corruption.<br>  Also Islam does not believe in the exact six days creation principle, but these were periods as day in the Semitic tongue means period, wrongly translated in the western tongue for many generations, and it could have been as long as necessary. The Prophet told that no one knows how long it was between his great grandfathers and Noah as it was many generations only God knows.|`|13c36f0b8ad9a3e212bb0604e034744aaa	I do not believe in teh god of the bible, but the majority of my friends and colleagues do.

As far as I am aware, in interpreting the bible, the 6 days was never meant to be six 24 hr periods, but merely an indication of some time that has elapsed.

The Church has never come out against it. It was hotly debated in the early years, but no decision was made. In my lifetime it has always been taught that there is no problem with it. The Church  has always been against the application of the theory in the form of eugenics.|`|OeAfpIZAaa	Only idiots interpret the Genesis-account literally.

So, after many years of tenacious and unyielding opposition the Roman Catholic church, in an abrupt and somewhat dramatic about face, relented and endorsed the theory of evolution.<br>  <br>  In the face of the huge and growing body of scientific evidence supporting evolution the church had no recourse but to concede defeat.|`|NMaCcyeKaa	I don't believe Creation is literally truth.  I believe Creation is an allegory meant to explain our origins to people that lacked the basic knowledge to understand what really happened.  As such, I believe in evolution and the God of the Bible.  They are not mutually exclusive beliefs.|`|AA11935435	Nope Certainly not, it's either one or the other it can't be both, you can only be right or you can be wrong you can't be both right and wrong at the same time and it can't be right to believe two things are right when they contradict each other!|`|r1IRcrMPaa	What I really find hard to believe is that man was made of dirt and the woman out of his rib.

dcWGYBfYaa	American society seems to apply the one-drop rule to Native Americans.

Those people share the same issues, concerns, struggles, successes and pride in the achievement of their people.<br>  <br>  It’s belonging that makes us Native American not the blood. <br>  .|`|a841c5ab77bb35fb792282f811028661aa	the "one drop" rule was a government word or ruling, that was used to discriminate against ppl of color. natives included...it basically meant a person's blood lineage was tainted and not pure, or less anglo.<br>  <br>  i'm not sure i totally understand your question in applying that rule to natives with more than 1/4 blood degree quantum. could you explain?<br>  <br>  as a native person, i understand why there is a 1/4 or even 1/8th blood degree quantum required for tribal enrollment. to keep tribal blood ties strong. and the enrollment requirements are set by individual tribes, and vary from tribe to tribe. <br>  <br>  if one were to go to a reservation where they think they have ancestry, and state their blood degree as less than the required degree for enrollment, they'd prob. not be believed. esp. if family members cannot be traced to any living rez relatives. <br>  <br>  and non-rez indians are not as respected as those who have kept their ties, or were not raised on the rez. that's just the way it is.|`|QnlIF1Cfaa	I would because your part of that culture I'm mix too.(I'm mix with black,white,native american,and japanese.)I look more black then I do the others.It doesn't matter if you one drop.It's all about traits.Lats say if you have child.With an white girl.Your child can come out looking more native then you.Like my sister she looks more japanese then me.So the one drop rule does count for anyone who is mix.If your wonder I got the black and native from both parents.And the white and japanese from mother.|`|Mzvp1LPFaa	Appearance is a lot more important than theoretical percentage.

Rg2ERXAtaa	sometimes compliments are used for ulterior motives,in this case you don't need to feel obligated by ettiquette to thank someone for rude,or demeaning comments,just tell them to fcuk off,    politely of course<br>                               or<br>  or you could tell the offending party that he makes you feel uncomfortable when he makes comments like that<br>                               or <br>  just hold up a whistle like your about to blow it when the approach you<br>                               or<br>  ignore him compleetly,it's not rude to ignore someone like that|`|jcL7gDMKaa	Of course you don't thank him for it! I would slap him and walk off or just ignore him. We say thank you when someone has said something or done something for us that we WANT them to do. There is also general politeness but you should be able to use your own discretion to decide when you want to be grateful or thankful for it.|`|xMF4CUbLaa	Thank you is the polite thing to say if the compliment is polite. How you say it will convey the unstated obvious just as his leery eyes will.

Then.................raise hell publicly..!!!! <br>  Of course when I'm around, I punch him. Problem solved.|`|SxgOy9uPaa	You getting bored girl,you've asked before,now you twisting it up a bit..IF you find the comments offensive,or you don't appreciate the way its delivered to you..THEN suggest he F**K off,go tell your mother she wants you or perhaps a handy freeway where he can go play dodge..   Get real personal specially if you got a bit of a crowd,,say if my dog looked like you,i'd shave it's butt & teach it to walk backwards..That usually slows them up a bit..Stay well & strong..Good to hear you again..Hope i helped here..|`|1c1f532d0b7b25b3aae753390d6e60b8aa	I was under the impression that you say "thank you" when you appreciate something that has been done or said to you.<br>  <br>  If you don't like his comments tell him to **** off and keep his lecherous opinions to himself as they make you feel uncomfortable.|`|yuBuNoPDaa	No. In that situation - say nothing. I've been there. I just look away. You are not obligated. You could nodd or vacate. The men have to know that they are acting inappropriately.|`|AqXYZb9iaa	Why are we taught its polite to say thank you? It is the right thing to say to someone who has taken the trouble to be good to you by actions or words.<br>  <br>  In the case that you mentioned, though depending on the degree of indecency shown, the man should be reprimanded.<br>  I rather agree with the person above me.Good to stay polite, but sometimes public humiliation will cure them for good.|`|ybexjS2Paa	How about you'll tell him that his compliments make you feel uncomfortable and they are not appreciated. I would, actually I did a few times. You don't have to say thank you if you don't feel like there's anything to thank for.|`|8OREBeRdaa	Giving thanks is overall the polite thing to say to someone who has taken the effort to do something for you.  i.e. give you a gift, help you jump start your car when it won't start, carry your groceries to your vehicle, loan you money, give you a cup of sugar from a neighbor,etc. - you get the idea.<br>  <br>  You don't thank someone for acts or statements that are offensive or unwarranted.  You wouldn't thank someone for having their dog crap on your lawn would you?  Now, it's some lecherous pervert, you don't have to take that.  I think you could go about the situation in one of two ways:<br>  <br>  1) When the old perv leches on ya - don't say "Thank you".  Instead, say "Excuse me, but those comments aren't appreciated and in fact they are very insulting. Please go away." Or something to that affect.  There's no need to cuss out the guy, because that's just sinking to his level.  Be a lady - there aren't enough of those in the world. <br>  <br>  2) Yell, "DIRTLY OLD MAN!" at the top of your lungs, take out your mace and spray him.  When he falls down, lay the boots to him and take his wallet and look for cash, all the while saying "DIRTY OLD MAN! DIRTY OLD MAN!" Then run away.

3RQkgTSOaa	Promises that you keep for yourself can be a sign of integrity and strength of character. However, depending on WHAT those promises are, they can keep us from moving ahead and living our life as we were meant to.<br>  <br>  "Sitting in the shadows, waiting..." does no one any good, you or the world. I understand that you feel the world is dark, cold and lonely because of this person who may or may not notice you. But have you considered that you may be withholding life and inspiration from others who you don't even know who are waiting for YOUR light to touch THEM? It is your choice to pull back from society, to not be involved. But that's not living; that's waiting to die.<br>  <br>  Forgive me for being a bit moralistic but if your avatar is actually YOU, you are VERY young and have a lot to offer the world. This person upon who your "life hangs in the balance" is just one of hundreds, if not thousands, you will meet in life. The chances of CJU being "the one" are slim but not infinitesimal. I find it hard to believe that within this wide world, nature would be so cruel as to confine itself to a "one only" rule. There are others out there but without the SLIGHTEST amount of effort on your part, life will not afford you the break, the chance circumstance, that 1/1,000,000 split-timing encounter of meeting someone ELSE.<br>  <br>  I realize how you feel. After being with someone for 10 years, only NOW--three years AFTER the break-up--am I feeling REMOTELY like getting back into the dating scene so I GET the darkness. I GET the loneliness. I GET the self-imposed isolation. BUT... deny it as you may, you are a human passing through time and things WILL change. But as you and your environment change, you have to know when to LET GO of CJU so your growth and change can happen. I know you don't want to do that now. I know you want to hold on to that forever. But know that you CAN hold onto that AND move forward at the same time. This is what all self-aware humans go through, It's what imbues us with the ability to be sympathetic and empathetic.<br>  <br>  May you find your peace.|`|ox4tmOpJaa	People almost always feel they are right no matter what. And they feel they need to act on things because they can. The trick of it is to know who to trust and who not too. In your life about 90% of what you are told will be wrong or become wrong. What is right for today may not be for tomorrow. What your “friends” say may have a conscious or subconscious subtext that you don’t know about. Your family may be well meaning, but not have a clue how to live your life. And others may just be jealous and lie at every chance they get.<br>  <br>  But then there is always that 10%, the ones that never lie to you and really do care for you. The ones that would never give you bad information just to get something for themselves. And those that think out their words. Sometimes we hurt ourselves without knowing we are doing it. Other times we just don’t care. It is at those times to find the 10%.<br>  <br>  Maybe within that you can find your answer.|`|l8c2kTlvaa	They are telling you what they think, everybody has rights for an opinion even if you don't want to know or don't care.<br>  Forget about it, people are always going to be telling you what they think you should do. It is just one of those things that people feel like they need or they just want to do.<br>  <br>  What you do is your choice, in the end it's up to you. they can point you in the direction you should go or they think you should go, but its up to you whether you take that path.<br>  <br>  And humans are always looking for others support, guidance and approval. You care about what this person thinks because it is a natural thing for us to do, just tell yourself that your mind is made up and your doing what you want to do, what you think is right - even if they don't think the same, let them tell you what they think, that doesn't mean you have to listen :)|`|stWGfFeTaa	u should make attempts to let it go. f.t.w. , go for it i guess. the person who said that stuff, just remeber ur above them as long as u dont say anything like that back. u get the satisfaction, but if ur feeling mean, u can destroy them to, if ur popular enough it should be easy. dreaming about revenge brings nothing, just more anger that builds and builds and it makes u lose ur self esteem more and more. i know it as easy as let it go. but after a while it will. i know ud like to think not tho.
E5iFR6BJaa	I'm actually sexually attracted to both manly and feminine guys. My preference changed over the years.<br>  <br>  Somehow, the idea of a feminine turns me on when I was imagining things like how small and sweet they would and how they are probably pay attention more to me than any masculine guy could........<br>  <br>  thinking about it, turns me on right now.|`|cf6ad6a3adfe8d8e9ce6e9966f1a624caa	to  each his  own. i like  guys  who  look, act and  smell like  guys.<br>  <br>  but  i can  see the  beauty in  some  of  the  more  androgynous  types. i  certainly  wouldnt  kick one  out  of  bed for  spilling  crumbs.<br>  <br>  i  dont  go  for  the  ultra femmes however.  as  you  say  i'm  gay. if  i  wanted  a woman i would  date  a woman  and then  i wouldnt  be  gay. but  i would  never  judge anyones  choice. <br>  <br>  bi guys  seem  to  go  for  that  look  a  bit  more  i thnk  but  there  are  no  hard  and  fast  rules.|`|HKtxjWV1aa	A lot of guys today are more feminine than girls, it gets confusing...you can't really blame a guy for being bi can you! lol, not that i am, except maybe a tiny bit, but i respect those that are courageous enough to be true to themselves.|`|rKXf85ipaa	I like the look of feminine men more, but I always get more emotionally attached to more masculine men.  They make me feel safer and that's more important to me then looks, also I like being the "wife".|`|uLHCY6Qmaa	While I'm attracted to all men, I sometimes gravitate toward more manly guys. I'm just an equal opportunity slut, I guess...<br>  Auntie Kookoo|`|XlNPNMz3aa	NOt Me!|`|oVeGMNsLaa	I'm not a man- sorry!- but I thought I'd answer and share my perspective on why I like feminine men.<br>  <br>  I like femme men for the same reason I like masculine women: they are rare, gorgeous, exotic creatures to me. Everywhere I look, there are masculine men, a sea of regular Joes, of "men's men". And then, my eye will glance over a femme guy, and he'll stand out in the crowd like he's glowing, like an angel I've been allowed to see. They're rare and fleeting and different, and I love that. Femme guys catch my eye.<br>  <br>  What's more, there's something incredibly natural to me about femme guys. And I know that's odd, because a lot of people feel that femme men are the epitome of fakeness, of "trying to be like women". And maybe that's true for some. But to me, a femme man's femininity is the most genuine thing in the world- especially when compared to women's femininity, which I often feel is the product of socialization, something expected and fake and tired. But when a guy is femme, he has to actively counter what is expected of him (to be stoic, flat, strong, silent, butch), and what results is so inherent to him, an extension of an inner femme . . . the product is just gorgeous. Plus, I find it incredibly empowering and inspiring to see a man defy gender boundaries, to not let himself be told that boys do not wear eyeliner, or boys do not have loose wrists, or boys do not speak in soft, high voices. It takes strength to walk in the world as a femme guy, inviting- and then bearing- attacks from the gender-policing world and the homophobic. And that, to me, is one of the most attractive things about femme guys.<br>  <br>  Also, there is something incredibly sexy about femme men, that has nothing to do with the way they look, but in the attitude- it oozes sexuality. Femininity is, in some ways, about selling your body, about being sexually open and alluring and unashamed of it, and femme boys have that up the wazoo. Whereas manly guys are allowed to shave, gel their hair, and maybe spritz on a dash of cologne in order to be sexy, femme boys fully embrace their sexuality. They preen. They flaunt their bodies and adorn them. They are experts at flirting. I like that openness, that sense of hedonism and delight and comfort in his body that you get from a femme guy.<br>  <br>  I don't know if that has explained it very well, but I tried. I guess there is something alluring in the mixture of maleness and femininity- it's hardness against softness, blending and melting. All I know is that when I see a femme boy, all I want to do is invite him into my bed.<br>  <br>  Hope that helps!<br>  <br>  EDIT: I am, indeed.  But when I find that my answer works for both questions, I don't see why I should retype all of my thoughts.

It is like a spreading wildfire.<br>  <br>  Islam's most significant contribution to 2008 was probably the terror attacks in Mumbai, India, in which a dozen Pakistani-trained gunmen managed to massacre members of every other major world faith in one fell swoop, including Buddhists, Christians, Jews and a whole lot of Hindus. <br>  <br>  But of all the bloody stories to come out of the incident, perhaps none were worse than the rape, torture, murder and mutilation of innocents at the Chabad House, including the rabbi and his family. In a city of 18 million, it is wildly improbable that the handful of Jews there were chosen at random.<br>  <br>  Despite the religious declaration of the surviving gunman and the claims of responsibility for the violence by the Mujahideen, giving credit to Allah, the New York Times predictably refused to call the mass murder spree an act of Islamic terror. The BBC even took it a step further by actually declining to label the gunmen as terrorists (stopping just short of calling them community activists, apparently). <br>  <br>  Clearing Islam of blame in circumstances such as these is certainly the stuff of which Dhimwits are made. Yet, the Washington Post managed to outdo both the NY Times and the BBC by blaming Jews for the carnage (along with the US and India): <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  Where are the world wide protest from Muslims for the Murders of these innocent people in the last 2 days . . .<br>  <br>  Across the globe, from Thailand to New York, the Religion of Peace has been racking up one to two beheadings a day.

In the world of faith, no one is a non-believer except those who declare themselves as non-believers of One Alone GOD, by act or by word.<br>  <br>  To understand faith, you must understand love. Love is a feeling which keeps on decreasing & increasing or shaking & shivering. Sometimes it is minimized and sometimes it is maximized. To get balanced feeling, one needs to say “I love you” to the loved one to express love and all those who are in love, keep on saying ”I love you” to assure their love, time to time and moment to moment as much as the feeling demands and feeling depends upon the potential of ones own love.<br>  <br>  As you know, just saying “I love you” cannot cause peace of heart but much more is desired to convey love and to gain peace & satisfaction. Then gifts to show love are given to the loved ones and then time and services both are rendered to the loved ones to prove loyalty of love.<br>  <br>  If you understand what a real sacrificing love is, then you can easily understand the real faith in GOD because faith in GOD is same as one’s love and to balance the soul & body everyone needs to perform the same things which are performed in love to show love & to prove loyalty such as by saying:<br>  <br>      “There is no god but One Alone GOD, our Lord.”<br>      “No one is good but One Alone GOD, our Lord.”<br>      “There is no one who is our savior but One Alone<br>      GOD, the savior of all.”<br>  <br>  <br>  Even that is not enough, one must keep on sacrificing each & every thing for GOD sincerely and keep on thanking GOD, Praising GOD, Serving GOD and Worshipping GOD with all of one’s heart, with all of one’s soul, with all of one’s energy and to prove one’s loyalty, one must follow the commandments of GOD our Lord. If one will do all for the faith in GOD what is required in real love, one will be declared as the real servant of GOD and all acts of one must prove that one honored one’s GOD and that is what one requires for salvation according to Great Commandment in which GOD used the word “LOVE” for “FAITH” to tell that the real faith in GOD is equal to the real love of GOD.<br>  <br>  Please keep in mind:<br>  <br>  1- Those who act against the commandments of GOD are sinners.<br>  2- Sinners do not honor their GOD their Lord.<br>  3- Those who do not honor their GOD their Lord are enemies of GOD the Lord of all.<br>  4- Enemies of GOD will be punished here and hereafter according to the judgment.<br>  <br>  Beware please, the devil calls towards sins and unreal saviors, a way not shown by the GOD through commandments.<br>  <br>  God says in the Torah:<br>  <br>  "I__AND I ALONE AM GOD, ALL OTHER GODS ARE UNREAL.<br>  I KILL AND I GIVE LIFE. I WOUND AND I HEAL AND NO ONE CAN OPPOSE WHAT I DO."<br>  (Duet 32:39)<br>  <br>  Krishna Jee said to his father:-<br>  <br>  ‘Leave worship of all demi-gods and worship One, Alone God Only. Who is the Great Master and to serve whom is the duty of the slaves of God.’<br>  <br>  <br>  Jesus preached:-<br>  <br>  1.HONOUR GOD<br>  2.WORSHIP GOD<br>  3.SERVE GOD<br>  <br>  And in Quran God says:-<br>  <br>  “I__AND I ALONE AM THE NOURISHER OF THE UNIVERSE.”<br>  <br>  And, the word GOD means:-<br>  <br>  1.G___ FOR GENERATOR OF THE UNIVERSE<br>  2.O___ FOR ORGANIZER OF THE UNIVERSE AND COSMOS.<br>  3.D___ FOR DESTROYER OF EVERYTHING.<br>  <br>  All Holy Books tell us, that everything will be perished and nothing will be left but The One, Alone God to resurrect all whom God created for the judgement. All the messengers sent to mankind by the Great, AlMighty God__ died but the true religion of the God lives. So, to be the one nation of God:<br>  BELIEVE IN ONE ALONE GOD___ PERFORM GOOD DEEDS___ BELIEVE IN THE DAY OF JUDGEMENT AFTER RESURRECTION.|`|dq0L2jsAaa	to shows our humbleness.

With the rapid pace that Japan's technology is growing, a lot of people can feel awed at that.<br>  <br>  Also, when the Europeans arrived during the end of the Tokugawa Period, they were surprised that majority of the Japanese population were already well educated.<br>  <br>  From that, it would be an expectation to see something 'big' to come out of Japan when they began to modernize, and so far they have fulfilled it by taking in our ideas and recreating with their own values and quirks to it or, as my teacher would say, make it "Japanese".<br>  <br>  Following that - and to answer your question - Americans in general aren't preoccupied with Japan as it is almost surrounding us and basically an every day thing (e.g. sushi bars, karaoke, karate, manga), but it is the current young generation that is, as we are more open-minded with new ideas about their culture and our ability to accept other cultures much easier.<br>  <br>  Oh, and one more thing: Japan is unique. Until I find out otherwise, Japan is the only country that has accepted the western culture and integrated it into their own, but they still keep with their own values and tradition. In short, it means that they are a modernized nation, not a westernized nation. This simply only builds an even more fascination about the country.|`|BAlntsndaa	You answered your own question - it's fashionable. And fun! Something different and interesting.

Other users are correct that this is because of cartoons in part.

Things come and go, but Japan is a country recognized as being sophisticated yet quirky and interesting, so naturally people are curious.

mrMkKFqNaa	JWs are discouraged from pursuing higher education or from seeking careers and promotions that would take away from Watchtower activities.<br>  <br>  In 2008, the Pew Forum conducted a survey of religions in the U.S.  The survey found that JWs are the least educated and second-poorest (second only to the historically Black churches) religion in the U.S.<br>  <br>  So, yes, there are some JWs who are educated and have, as you put it, "proper jobs."  These make up a very small minority of the overall JW community<br>  <br>  This is because the Watchtower/JW leadership has taught for over 100 years that "the end is right around the corner."  (see the 1920 Watchtower book titled "Millions Now Living Will Never Die" as but one example).<br>  <br>  If "the end" is really "right around the corner," then the JWs reason that it would make no sense to pursue a career.  Thus, we've had generation after generation of JWs forego education and career opportunities in anticipation of something that never came.<br>  <br>  Fortunately for those elderly, disappointed, broke JWs who thought they would never die "in this system of things," some of us work for a living and pay taxes so that they can survive on government benefits.  You're welcome!<br>  <br>  ====================<br>  A brief response to young Mr. Oberon.  Glad to hear you're pursuing an education.  Keep up the good work.<br>  <br>  Now, I fail to see how your unverified anecdotal evidence somehow makes me "look foolish."  If you read my response, you can see that I cited a survey done by a reputable outfit showing that JWs as a whole are the least educated American religion.  <br>  <br>  Did the survey say there are *no* educated JWs?  Of course not.  But these educated JWs are a small minority.  And it is clear that the JW religious leaders discourage University education.  If you need me to provide cites to WT literature proving this, I can do so.  But I have a feeling that you are familiar with it.<br>  <br>  And to your point about Jesus and his disciples.  You're missing one important thing.  The end DID come in their lifetime...that is, the end of the Jewish system of things (in 70 A.D. at the hand of the Romans).<br>  <br>  IIRC, your religious leaders even teach that the destruction of Jerusalem was the "first fulfillment" of the Matt. 21/Mark 13/Luke 21 prophecy.  So of course there was a sense of urgency back then...the end came about 37 years after Jesus predicted it (within one generation...hmmm).|`|crJ0fHZhaa	Hi there I am one of the JWs.

I have actually had the privilege of working for him a few times.<br>  <br>  6) Another owns his own plumbing business.<br>  <br>  7) Another owns his own drug store.<br>  <br>  8) Another works at a bank.<br>  <br>  9) Another friend and a brother at my Hall actually has a Doctorate in Chemical Engineering, and his wife is an RN who has worked in hospitals and in ambulances.<br>  <br>  And I could go on an on...<br>  <br>  But put simply, your question reeks of bias and is unfairly attacking this group because many of them choose to invest their time in spiritual pursuits in service to their God, in imitation of the evangelizing work of first century Christians, rather than pursuing money and wealth and material things in imitation of the rich man in Luke chapter 12.<br>  <br>  You display a very unspiritual and myopic view by posing this question. Do you even believe in God? You really think it more worthwhile to use your life and energy acquiring money and wealth and a career instead of pursuing spiritual things first? This life is really all there is to you anymore is it? How sad and shortsighted.<br>  <br>  "So it goes with the man that lays up treasure for himself but is not rich towards God." (Luk 12:21).<br>  <br>  And just in case Jorge has forgotten...Jesus and the Disciples also taught the the end was "just around the corner" and allowed rumors to circulate about the nearness. (Luke 21:34-36; John 21: 21; Acts 1:11; Rom 13:11, 12; 1Thes 5:1, 2, 6; Heb 10:36, 37; Rev 22:20; ect..). That sense of urgency is obvious to anyone who reads the "New Testament."<br>  <br>  So how about Jorge condemn Jesus and the disciples as well to be balanced? Does he not risk exposing his biased and slanted view of Witnesses by not doing so?<br>  <br>  If Jesus had come right out and said,“The Kingdom will come in 2000 years, so go therefore and make disciples” I don’t believe that would have created a sense of urgency. <br>  <br>  This would leave one to conclude that believing (and even teaching) the kingdom will come before its time is something that is acceptable to Jehovah, dare I say even allowable. This is what both Jesus and the Apostles did.|`|Ztiy3jjwaa	Im acquainted with a Japanese Jehovah Witness, who held a high payed managerial position.<br>  However he took a step down as his life revolves around doing Jehovah ministry.<br>  He has taken a humble part time job and is happy to spend the rest of his time in Christian ministry.<br>  He says that there is nothing better and the found happiness, in doing the good of Jehovah ministry during his life.|`|UPgLy0Ahaa	So, what do you do for a living?<br>  <br>  I couldn't see you having a career as a writer, professor, teacher, etc...because your grammar is terrible. <br>  <br>  You wouldn't make it as a counselor of any kind because you're rude instead of being empathetic or sympathetic. Do I make my point?<br>  <br>  My sister had a baby that was delivered by a friend of ours who is a doctor. Also, there was a doctor in our congregation for years until he moved. We take our dog to a friend of ours that just happens to be a vet.<br>  <br>  Now, if Jehovah's Witnesses stole on the job as many if not most people do that would be a different story. Or if they 'loitered' at their business you would have reason to complain as you are in fact doing. (Romans 12:11) <br>  <br>  Just to let you know that my husband and I owned and operated an accounting business for close to 25 years. Also, we were in real estate and owned 7 homes. We were also in the full-time ministry together until health problems became a concern. <br>  <br>  We have made alot of money over the years, but our spiritual blessings have outnumbered any material blessings. We prefer it that way. (Mal.3:10  Ps.145:16)|`|3aVxJYf6aa	I am Structural Engineer.....I do structural design for Architects....one of my Client in a JW who is Architect...and one of the elder in my congregation is Electrical engineer.<br>  <br>  Blood and Doctors are not necesary related.....despite of the blood doesn't assure you nothing....and the spread of new viruses ara increasing the group of people who reject blood as  JWs do.|`|AT4idiuPaa	There is always a hierarchy in any organization, The top people financially are not often the top people spiritually (given priveleges)|`|AA10024451	Most of us do have jobs. What are you implying is a "proper" job?<br>  <br>  Many, if not most, of Jehovah's Witnesses work secularly to care for their needs as well as the needs of their families. The type of jobs we have vary greatly, much like it does for everyone in general. Some are janitors, some are owners of their own business, some are big company executives. It has no real effect on the time we use in preaching the Bible's "good news". Obviously nobody would want to have to work secularly, and that includes us, as we'd rather have as much time as possible to give to the Kingdom preaching work. <br>  <br>  The encouragement the Bible gives in areas of money and caring for one's needs is to be "content with sustenance and covering" and to "keep on seeking the kingdom first". So while we work jobs designed to help us to have homes, food, clothing, and other necessities of life, our encouragement is not to make it a major goal in life to "climb the ladder" of success if so doing would require putting in longer hours and taking away more time from caring for our spiritual needs or the needs of our family. Also I know of people who have had very lucrative careers and gave them up when they became Jehovah's Witnesses so they could focus on their basic needs and devoting more time to the Kingdom preaching work. Others have decided to stay in their current jobs rather than seek promotions because they know it would involve their doing things that would disrupt their spiritual routine. <br>  <br>  Yes, there are members of our faith who work in the medical field. There are a number of people who are doctors in other avenues that never have the blood issue come up at all. Pediatricians, for example. Podiatrists, for another. "Ear, Nose, & Throat" doctors for another example. And I'm sure there may be some who could work in emergency medicine and may have saved lives....WITHOUT using blood (which is becoming more increasingly common in hospitals the world over).|`|AA11025703	Sure there are "professionals" among Witnesses.  In my area allot of the sisters and brothers are Dental Assistants, Physical therapists. Doctors, Nurses, Pharmacists, Lawyers.  One brother in North Georgia is a Computer Tech, used to work for Delta, now works for IBM, and is also a Writer.  The General Contractor who handled finding me a roofer, and who also has done, and will do, repairs on my home, is a Witness.  My Dad, along with others, was an Electrician, a an Electrical Engineer, a Teacher at the local IBEW.  I know sisters and brothers who are Teachers, School Bus Drivers.<br>  <br>  Honestly, I'd probably be able to give you quite a nice list, Except for one important detail.  When they walk in the Hall, I don't care if they flip burgers, or flip houses, they are my brothers and sisters.  One's corporate standing Does NOT matter to me.<br>  <br>  None of us walk around with income badges on our chests.<br>  <br>  As for giving BTs, in the Douglasville area of Georgia, I'd imagine it's less of a concern as now you have to sign a consent form to receive blood, instead of the old days when we had to sign forms to refuse.  Ultimately, ALL doctors have some procedures they aren't comfortable with.  It's a matter of medical opinion, and consciencious choice.<br>  <br>  My Grandmother had a doctor who didn't want to operate on her Anyerism (I don't think he was a Witness).  It was his choice.  She could've found another Doctor, who probably would've done the procedure.<br>  <br>  As for a "proper" job, my mother always said/says, ANY job that's honest is a good job.  I rather agree, and have heard other sources (non Witness) say the same thing.<br>  <br>  I am currently on Disability, and am looking into becoming a Medical Transcriptionist.<br>  <br>  As for the silly comment about Non Witnesses paying Taxes to cover Witnesses.  Being a Witness by NO means renders a person exempt from having to pay taxes.  So just as Non Witnesses are covered by Taxes paid in part by Witnesses, Witnesses are at times in part covered by Taxes paid, in part by non Witnesses.

Yes all of the ones you named will be in heaven if only with their last breath they accepted stick boy aka jesus as their savior.<br>  <br>  Really neat isn't it?  You can murder, rape and steal all you want and still go to heaven.<br>  <br>  All you have to do is accept him as your personal savior and the slate is wiped clean.<br>  <br>  And xtians wonder why few want xtian judges and politicians!<br>  <br>  Take Care.|`|1qwTMCm9aa	well first off=] not everyone goes to heaven...that is not what Christians believe; We believe that God chooses to take those to heaven who have been faithful to him. People who are in foreign places and have never heard or been introduced to Christianity dont automatically go to hell, God decides based on their moral decisions throughout their lives whether or not they go home to him. Second off, its not "ok" that those people like Hitler and Stalin..and whoever else u said did what they did, they broke one of Gods 10 commandments; a given one...you shall not kill...and they had free will, they CHOOSE to murder millions of innocent, and unless they seriously repented, thats a mortal sin and they most likely wont go to heaven. But then again dont get me wrong...im not GOD.lol so i cant know for sure if thats the truth, God works in mysterious ways=]<br>  and thirdly, Christians are people who have been " so good and sinless" the point is that Christians mostly are people who just like any other people, have been through some really crappy times, and probably gotten involved in some bad stuff too. but we recognize that we need something more than the crap the world throws in our face, and thats faith in a Lord who loves us unconditionally, no matter what bad decisions we've made. No bodys perfect, but God is, so we should strive to be like him.  I look at it this way...because sometimes i admit that i have questions about God and if he exists...but i figure that its easy just to say...screw it, Gods not real, my life sucks. but its hard to have faith in something you cant physically see, and im not one to take the easy way out......lol and besides look at how long this faith has been around....<br>  haha i know this probably a much longer response than wat u expected...but i hope it helps=]<br>  God Bless,<br>  sarah|`|y8XVhhmmaa	There are three different parts of Heaven. People like Hitler, Jack the Ripper, and Ted Bundy will be condemned to the lowest part, which is comparable to Hell.|`|a4crNiGdaa	they wont go to heaven|`|4sUek7ugaa	You make heaven sound like it should be a reward for not giving in to your desire to commit mass murder.|`|AA10024451	First, it is not a Christian teaching that "everyone goes to heaven", so you're starting off on the wrong foot with your question. Secondly, for vile, evil people like the ones you mentioned, the safe assumption is that they would have no hope of living in heaven, and they would have no hope of being resurrected to live here on the earth. But, it is all dependent on God's view of them. He alone can read people's hearts and see what's in it as well as their potential ability for change. Remember, even King David did some terrible things including adultery and then murder (having his adulterer partner's husband killed in battle), and God was able to examine his heart and forgive him. <br>  <br>  Good thing it's not our call as to who lives and dies.<br>  <br>  (God NEVER ordered the rapes of anyone. Where'd you get that nonsense from?)

gDr6c4hraa	Praise be to Allaah.<br>  <br>  The free woman who has attained the age of majority is obliged to cover her entire body during prayer, apart from her face and hands, because all of her is ‘awrah. If she prays and any part of her ‘awrah becomes uncovered, such as a shin or foot or all or part of her head, then her prayer is invalid, because the Prophet said: <br>  "Allaah will not accept the prayer of a woman who has started to menstruate, except with a khimaar (covering)" (Reported by Ahmad, Abu Dawud, Ibn Maajah and al-Tirmidhi, with a saheeh isnaad)<br>  <br>  Abu Dawud reported from Umm Salamah that she asked the Prophet about a woman who prayed wearing a dir’ (chemise or upper garment) and a khimaar (head cover), but no izaar (lower garment). He said: "The woman is ‘awrah."<br>  <br>  As for the face, the Sunnah is to uncover it during prayer, so long as no non-mahram men are present. According to the majority of scholars, the feet must be covered; some scholars allow uncovering the feet but the majority say the opposite. Abu Dawud reported from Umm Salamah (may Allaah be pleased with her) that she was asked about a woman who prayed in a khimaar and qamees (dress or gown). She said, "There is nothing wrong with it if the dir’ (chemise) covers her feet." In any case, it is better to cover the feet, to be on the safe side. As far as the hands are concerned, there is more leeway: there is nothing wrong with either covering them or uncovering them, although some scholars think that it is better to cover them. And Allaah is the Source of strength.|`|mOa7cGlAaa	for woman's not compulsory<br>  but he can't uncover his foot (up and down that sticking on ground) for the non mohram mans ( also in praying )<br>  and it is ok to uncover it while praying.|`|Rb84jDiEaa	if ur a girl, then yes ur feet need to be covered :<br>  <br>  *looks for source* brb i just need to find it<br>  <br>  ok the darn link isn't posting!  rofl brb i need to find a dif one<br>  <br>  kk sorry but i'm gonna copy and paste what the link from IslamQA said : <br>  ~~~~~~~~~~~<br>  So it is essential to wear something that covers the entire body apart from the face. The scholars differed as to whether it is obligatory for a woman to cover her hands and feet when praying. <br>  <br>  With regard to the hands: the majority of scholars are of the view that it is not obligatory to cover them. Two views were narrated concerning that from Imam Ahmad. Shaykh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah was of the view that it is not obligatory. It says in al-Insaaf: That is the correct view. <br>  <br>  With regard to the feet: the majority of Maalikis, Shaafa’is and Hanbalis are of the view that it is obligatory to cover them. This is also the view stated in a fatwa of the Standing Committee for Issuing Fatwas (6/178): <br>  <br>  Shaykh Ibn Baaz (may Allaah have mercy on him) said: <br>  <br>  The entire woman is ‘awrah when she is praying, apart from her face. The scholars differed with regard to the hands. Some of them said it is obligatory to cover them, and others said it is allowed to leave them uncovered. The matter is broad in scope, in sha Allaah, but it is better to cover them so as to avoid an area of scholarly disagreement. As for the feet, it is obligatory to cover them when praying, according to the majority of scholars. End quote. <br>  <br>  Majmoo’ Fataawa Ibn Baaz, 10/410 <br>  <br>  Imam Abu Haneefah, al-Thawri and al-Mazani were of the view that it is permissible for a woman to uncover her feet when praying. This is the view favoured by Shaykh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah and by al-Mardaawi in al-Insaaf.<br>  <br>  Shaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymeen (may Allaah have mercy on him) said in al-Sharh al-Mumti’ (2/161): <br>  <br>  There is no clear evidence on this matter. Hence Shaykh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah was of the view that a free woman is ‘awrah except what appears of her when she is in her home, namely the face, hands and feet. He said: Women at the time of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) used to wear chemises in their homes, and not every woman had two garments. Hence if menstrual blood got onto her garment, she could wash it and pray in it. The hands and feet are not ‘awrah when praying, or with regard to looking. Based on that, there is no solid evidence on this matter, and I follow Shaykh al-Islam in this regard; this is how we understand it, but we cannot be certain of it, because even if a woman has a garment that reaches to the floor, when she prostrates the bottom of her feet will appear. End quote. <br>  <br>  See: al-Mughni, 1/349; al-Majmoo’, 3/171; Badaa’i’ al-Sanaa’i’, 5/121; al-Insaaf, 1/452; Majmoo’ al-Fataawa by Ibn Taymiyah, 22/114.<br>  ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~|`|NlQhkgFCaa	No, I don't think so|`|47i1KYEsaa	Salam Alykom<br>  it is not compulsory at all. the only compulsory thing when female praying is to cover everything except the arms & the face.

isll2Uqnaa	you cant STOP sinning. we are all sinners by nature. this is why Jesus' sacrifice was necessary. however, as Christians, we root ourselves deep into the Word of God and this alone will minimize our sinning. read the Bible. pray. ask God for help. God will not condemn His children; everytime we fall He is always there to pick us up, brush us off, and give us strength to continue our walk with Him. <br>  <br>  being Christians does not mean we are perfect. we still stumble. stay strong in your faith and God's love will guide you. God bless you!|`|hR7OsqtRaa	You cannot stop sinning completely, by becoming Christian. It is difficult, hence you should always pray for God to guide you and if you sin unknowingly, then you can ask him for forgiveness. Read the Bible daily. It has very useful guidelines on how to lead your life.<br>  <br>  In John 8:58 "I tell you the truth," Jesus answered, "before Abraham was born, I am!"<br>  <br>  The above verse speaks a lot about who Jesus really is.<br>  <br>  All about Jesus and the Holy Trinity explained in the below website.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://jesustrinity.blogspot.com" rel="nofollow">http://jesustrinity.blogspot.com</a><br>  <br>  Lots of videos, sermons, songs are also present, along with all of Jesus miracles, his parables, and questions on his birth, crucifixion, resurrection are answered.<br>  <br>  Many major questions on Christianity are answered with lot of examples that cannot be denied by anyone, such as,<br>  <br>  1) Did Jesus really exist? Is He God? Why did He suffer on the Cross?<br>  2) What is so special about Jesus? Why cant I just view him as an ordinary man or a teacher or a prophet?

It is part of the human condition that we are tempted and we sometimes give in.<br>  <br>  Paul states precisely this in one of his most famous texts from his letters. He says that (like you) he wants to do what is right, and not do what is wrong, and (just like you) he says he is powerless to do it.<br>  <br>  However, we Christians affirm that our sins are forgiven. That doesn't mean that sinning is OK, of course not. It just means that you are forgiven.<br>  <br>  You don't have to stop sinning in order to be forgiven. Not at all.<br>  <br>  "Then why be good at all?"<br>  <br>  Because it feels so good? Sure! That's one thing a lot of folks just don't get, but also, because you're grateful, you might want to do something -- not fearing death, but out of a grateful desire to do the best that is in you, because that's what we are all meant to do.<br>  <br>  You will sin. And you will experience the consequences of that sin. And it will pain you greatly. But you are forgiven.<br>  <br>  So you see, it's really quite simple.You just have to accept the fact that you are forgiven, and nothing, but nothing will ever be able to make God stop loving you. It's hard to accept because it seems absurd, and very unfair. But God is radically absurd and "unfair." Remember the story of the laborers. They all got their wages, in full. Even those guys who went out into the fields for a half hour of work got a full wage. That's the absurdly wonderful Kingdom of God.<br>  <br>  Get a Bible with a good commentary, and start reading it daily, and start learning. The New Oxford Annotated Bible is very good, because it's text is one of the best on the planet, and the scholars writing the notes are the very best.<br>  <br>  Go for it!|`|kWz0nEdBaa	Cheer up, you are not alone.  We are not yet perfect because God is still working in us and through us.  There is a promise though, "He who began a good work in you will complete it in Christ Jesus..."<br>  As for stopping yourself from sinning, there is no substitute for praying when you are tempted to sin.

Gc49JgoQaa	Necrophilia.|`|E870WbAsaa	In the play, “Romeo and Juliet,” by William Shakespeare, a pair of teenagers from enemy families face death for their forbidden love. Throughout the story, both lovers struggle to maintain their secret relationship from their parent’s opposition. Ultimately, their love is tested to the point where both choose to take their life. The passion between Romeo and Juliet is demonstrated through the use of light and dark imagery and the theme of life and death.<br>  Romeo expresses his eagerness to see Juliet through light and dark imagery. One example of Romeo’s strong desire for Juliet is found in the lines, “With love’s light wings did I o’erperch these walls; /For stony limits cannot hold love out, And what love can do, that dares love attempt.” (2. 2. 73-76). Love is personified as wings. Romeo refers to love as his deep resolve that he will use to climb the rocky balcony at night to see Juliet. In addition, by saying that his love can do and dares attempt, he is declaring that despite the danger involved between the two families, he will still risk it all for her anytime. Light and dark imagery is also apparent in the lines, “A thousand times the worse, to want thy light! /Love goes toward love as school boys from their books; /But love from love, towards school with heavy looks.” (2. 2. 172-174). School boys are eager to leave their books at their home. Romeo refers to their meetings as anxious and full of anticipated timing. Romeo doesn’t want the light to appear because then he’ll have to depart from his Juliet. In addition, by saying towards school with heavy looks, he is symbolizing how they are separated lovers who feel sad like boys departing for school in the morning. Therefore, Romeo’s feelings of eagerness to see Juliet are presented in these passages and are displayed through the use of light and dark imagery.<br>  Juliet shows her selfless dedication towards Romeo through light and dark imagery. One example of how Juliet proves her devotion to Romeo is found in the lines, “It is the lark that sings out of tune, /Straining harsh discords and unpleasing sharps. Some say the lark makes sweet division; /This doth note so, for she divideth us. Some say the lark and loathed toad changed eyes; /O, now I would they had changed voices too, /Since arm from arm that voice doth us affray, /Hunting thee hence with hunt’s up to the day! /O, now be gone! More light and light it grows”. (3. 5. 27-35). The lark is the bird whose singing indicates the morning’s light. Juliet originally wants Romeo to stay with her a little longer but as soon as Romeo mentions the possible danger, she desperately asks him to leave. In addition, she warns him that the lark’s chirps will rouse up people in the morning who would hunt him down. Light and dark imagery is also clear in the lines, “Or, if I live, is it not very like /The horrible conceit of death and night, /Together with the terror of the place /As in a vault, an ancient receptacle /Where for this many hundred years the bones Of all my buried ancestors are packed; where bloody Tybalt, yet but green in earth, /Lies fest’ring in his shroud.” (4. 3. 38-45). Despite the possibility of waking up and going crazy around the dead at night in the family morgue, Juliet chooses to take the poison so that she can be with Romeo. In addition, she faces the fear of laying down next to her rotting cousin, Tybalt, during the hours she may be awake just to be with Romeo. Therefore, Juliet’s dedication to Romeo is evident in these excerpts and demonstrated through light and dark imagery.<br>  In conclusion, William Shakespeare displays Romeo’s affection towards Juliet through the use of light and dark imagery and the theme of life and death. Romeo’s love for Juliet strains his patience due to his longing for her. This shows how every moment away from Juliet causes him pain. Juliet’s selflessness goes to great lengths to reunite with him. This shows that she chooses her love’s safety over her deep desires. The point is that both of them had a strong bond of love. Perhaps if their parents didn’t interfere, they would have a happy ending.   :)|`|iX0CoNkXaa	Jesus loves us so much that He was willing to face the cross to we can have an opportunity for eternal life in heaven with Him.|`|wE7lLCHSaa	Golf clap for Ethan|`|EXurNsB4aa	Ethan, I lol'd.|`|VcM9zyikaa	by your mind

rV1uAtt3aa	The baby.  <br>  <br>  If humans had been created fully formed, as some believe, they would have been adults (Adam and Eve.)  <br>  <br>  If humans evolved (which is what I believe), then they would have been born of proto-humans; another species that was nearly human.  We started as humans, but the line that leads up to humans includes such nearly-human ancestors as homo habilis (tool-using man) and homo erectus (upright man.)  If you never heard of these species, I wouldn't be surprised; religious groups have spent a lot of money to keep evidence of man's ancestors out of high school text books.|`|YZv8Ub3Haa	Each generation is very very very slightly different from the previous one.

It doesn't work that way. Evolution is a very slow, gradual process that takes thousands of years to show minor changes. It isn't that one day we just appeared out of nowhere as humans.|`|C1SOqQSkaa	You misunderstand evolution. If you looked at every individual from the first ape-like human precursor to modern day, you would never see a change from one generation to the next. <br>  <br>  The changes are tiny, and incredibly slow.<br>  <br>  Same with giraffes: their neck size increased minutely over thousands of generations because each tiny increase provided a tiny advantage.<br>  <br>  One animal doesn't simply give birth to another. It if did, there would be nothing for the new animal to mate with. Such creatures are mutant monsters. They die.|`|q6H2ru3waa	do you have baby pictures of yourself?|`|QVKWVValaa	Obviously the babies. The parents would be normal representatives of whatever species that was about to undergo the evolutionary step. The offspring - or baby as you put it - would be the one who would exhibit the evolved characteristic. <br>  While the offspring is still in the womb, all it takes is a few, or even one, incorrectly replicated - or mutated - DNA and VIOLA! We have upright apes instead of hunched apes. All that is then required is for nature do determine if that mutated DNA offers a benefit somehow to the species. <br>  Evolution is not rocket science. It doesn't take an advanced degree to figure it out. All it takes is seeing your own parents, or children, looking different from you. What slight mutations might exist in your own DNA that may someday allow humans to have a better chance of surviving?<br>  <br>  EDIT<br>  Yes, there always was, "... a younger generation of whatever humans evolved from." They are called proto-humans. However, many of them were highly specialized and unable to adapt to environmental change. Inability to adapt to environmental change - whether brought on by climate change or being driven off their territory by other, more adaptable proto-humans - has lead to those younger generations going extinct. Their extinction is similar to what is happening to many species on Earth today. <br>  To use a non-human example, feral cats are destroying natural ecosystems all over the world and causing the extinction of several species. Competing predators that are not as capable of hunting as the feral cats are starving, or in some cases falling victim to the cats themselves. Also, prey species not adapted to the cat as a predator are entirely wiped out. Those same kinds of things would happen when one band of proto-humans encountered another. One would out compete the other and drive it to extinction.<br>  Those proto-humans are the fossilized remains we find today. And we don't have a complete history of all stages of human evolution. There are gaps. Try finding a needle in a hay stack and you will get some idea what it must be like to try to find one set of bones on the planet Earth. <br>  Fortunately, when we find one of these proto-human bodies, we are able to extract DNA and use it to compare to other DNA samples we have. We can then get a better idea of the mutations that have occurred that brought us about, get a better idea of how many generations have passed.|`|N8QLKpCMaa	such brilliant Q !<br>  <br>  Dear 1st of all an adult being was evolved then it started breeding , 1st man & woman in adult ages then kids , first hen then egg.<br>   until a living being doesn't have adult & productive stages they can't reproduce. there is no self reproduction, right ! <br>  until there is no productive complete being , there is no next generation.<br>  there is no self evolution but adult complete being to a baby !|`|p18BmlIxaa	Well see, first it was a baby, then after fifteen some-odd years (or however it took to reach sexual maturity), it became an adult. ;-)<br>  <br>  The thing you're overlooking here is that lines between species are fuzzy and arbitrary.  <br>  <br>  It's like looking at a continuous spectrum of all the colors, and asking you to pinpoint exactly the spot where red changes into orange.  You can't.  You can look at two separate swatches, one red and one orange, and tell the difference between the two, but on a continuum, it is impossible to say precisely where the line between the two is: where the definitive change from red to orange happens.<br>  <br>  It's like that with evolution.  It's not like one day a homo erectus suddenly gave birth to a fully modern homo sapiens.  It's a continuum of tiny, tiny changes, You can look at prototypical examples of the two and tell the difference, but in between is a whole spectrum of individuals that are intermediary, and you can't pinpoint exactly where the line between the two species is.  Scientists only draw arbitrary lines between species for classification purposes.<br>  <br>  Does that make sense?|`|yu53u5TFaa	No. The way it works is generation 1 has certain characteristics. Generation 1 begats generation 2 which is mostly the same. Generation 2 begats generation 3 which is mostly the same now more different from 1. Generation 3 begats generation 4 which is only slightly different from generation 3 yet very different from generation 1.

The environment is diverse, so different traits will help the species have an easier time surviving and reproducing in different places. As the separated species continues to be reproduce in their own locations, they continue to become less like each other. This process takes MANY generations. Think chihuahua and great dane, but instead of humans selecting who breeds with who or who breeds at all, the environment does.<br>  <br>  The first would technically be babies, as everyone starts out as a baby.

You'd first have to answer at what point our ancestors could be considered "human"... which characteristics separate us from other primates, or even other mammals?  It couldn't be complex emotion, cause that's a trait we share with our fellow mammals. How about the ability to reason? Use tools?

Sorry I am an older AMerican woman and don't understand Black slang either.<br>  There are several words that Black people use among themselves. If you're white you need to not use their words.  <br>  ****** is extemely offensive and if you aren't Black you don't use it. If we have to use the word, we refer to it as the 'n' word because it has such a hurtful, hateful origin. There is also ***** which I think is also a Black only term.   <br>  I would never use any words I did not understand fully with  Black people because they are already sensitive (rightfully so) to our (whites) name calling. <br>  Hope you find the exact meanings you want.|`|qlmcVAIpaa	a hood *****--a black person that she can hang out with.

No.  From some countries, yes.<br>  3) I do not believe in any gods.  On some issues I am conservative, others moderate, and some liberal.<br>  4) I do not approve of marijuana for non-medical uses.  I don't want the fellow driving the bus my girls ride on or the airplane I'm flying in smoking marijuana.<br>  5) I do not agree with all cases of abortion.  I like the laws as they stand today.<br>  6) I certainly believe in the First Amendment.  I do not believe we are less free today than in the past, but I do believe that people do not appreciate the value of our freedoms as they should.<br>  7) I think both the Israelis and the Palestinians are acting like children fighting over a sandbox.<br>  8) I like BBC World, dislike Fox, and get most of my news on the Internet these days.<br>  9) Speaking against the government is not unpatriotic.  We have an obligation to police our government, as it represents us.<br>  10) As a proponent of equal rights, I believe there is no good reason to deny the right of marriage to my homosexual neighbors.  Those who don't agree with same-sex marriage should not marry someone of the same sex.|`|AEAxZEveaa	1. people should be politically correct. Sometimes it gets a little silly, but it's important to be sensitive.<br>  2. I have no idea. I wish I did, but I don't have all the answers.<br>  3. I believe in God, consider myself moderate. Very liberal in some areas, more conservative in others. Neither side has it all right.<br>  4. It's not immoral, but I don't believe that drug use is compatible with life. Take this piece of advice from someone who has been sober for 4 years. The urges never go away.<br>  5. No. I believe abortion is wrong. Certain cases are less wrong such as if a woman's life is in danger.<br>  6. I agree with it. I think we take for granted the freedoms we have. <br>  7. I really don't know. I wish there wasn't war, but I have no idea.<br>  8. BBC world. Fox is so biased.<br>  9. Hmm, it's not black or white, but I think making fun of the president is in poor taste. That's probably not a very popular statement, but I think you should take a stand against certain issues and work to change them. Just being mean isn't going to change anything.<br>  10. I do believe they should have the freedom to be married. Conservatives should have the right to their beliefs as long as they don't interfere with someone else's rights as an american.|`|M3sVQm2Maa	1. Racism is worse.<br>  2. We should have an exit strategy in place for Iraq. We should not bring troops home from ALL other countries, as long as we are peacekeeping. We have military installments in many countries.<br>  3. I do not believe in any gods, and I guess I'd be considered liberal.<br>  4. I've never smoked it, and I think it can be a problem for some just like alcohol can be. I think the laws against it are too strict. I definitely think medical use should be available.<br>  5. I agree with all cases of abortion which were the woman's choice. I don't agree with coerced abortions.<br>  6. The 1st amendment is crucial to this country. <br>  7. I think as long as their claim to the land is religiously based, the fighting will never stop. I think both sides are guilty of religious violence.<br>  8. Fox is the worst. I'd rather watch BBC than that any day.<br>  9. Speaking against the government is VERY American. The ability to express dissent is our right. <br>  10. I believe gays should be allowed to be married. Conservatives can keep their beliefs, but their religious beliefs shouldn't keep others from their constitutional rights.|`|mAZi1eH7aa	1) Political correctness vs racism. Which is worse?<br>  A: Both are bad, however, thoughtlessness and indescretion and not considering other's feelings and beliefs are even worse things.<br>  <br>  2) Should we bring our troops from all other countries?<br>  A: No. No western nation can isolate themselves from the travesties of other nations. It is a duty to assist, but not invade.<br>  <br>  3) Do you believe in God? Are you conservative, liberal or moderate?<br>  A: I do believe in God. I am Conservative on some things, Liberal on others and moderate on some.<br>  <br>  4) What do you think of people who smoke marijuana?<br>  A: To each their own, but do not do it around others. It can and does effect other people. Second hand is as bad as first hand during drug tests. So some consideration is required.<br>  <br>  5) Do you agree with ALL cases of abortion?<br>  A: No, but I do believe in the right to have them. There is a difference.<br>  <br>  6) Do you truly believe in the 1st amendment of the constitution? Do you believe we are a less free country these days?<br>  A: I am Canadian, so your constitution does not have any bearing on me at all, but with freedom comes responsibility and the necessity to protect the freedom. The US, as with all Western countries has had to take measures to assure the freedom of citizens. Freedom can be used for both good and bad.<br>  <br>  7) Israel-Palestinian issue. Whose side are you on?<br>  A: Both. They both deserve a better life and better security and to live well.<br>  <br>  8) BBC World vs Fox/any American channel. Which is better?<br>  A: I prefer CBC, CTV, and BBC<br>  <br>  9) Do you think speaking against the govt is anti-American?<br>  A: It is not anti american, but it is not justified to do so unless you can offer (as an individual or group) an educated and well thought and studied alternative to the situation you are against, and be willing to work at it yourself. Blindly being against something is neither reasonable, responsible or justified.<br>  <br>  10) Do you believe gays should be allowed to be married, and the conservative beliefs should be stifled?<br>  A: Yes, gays should be allowed to marry. Everyone has the right to happiness or whatever comes from it.  I do not believe that the conservatives should be stifled though. Everyone has the right to their own beliefs and opinions. If there is never an attempt to compromise then there is dictatorship. Good government comes when the compromise is reached between opposing opinions and beliefs.|`|2jwWYKbQaa	1) Equally bad.<br>  2) Yes.<br>  3) Not necessarily.

I am fiscally conservative, yet socially liberal.<br>  4) I don't smoke anything, marijuana or tobacco.  I don't care what other people do as long as I don't have to inhale second hand smoke.<br>  5) I allow pregnant women to decide what they want to do with their bodies.<br>  6) Yes, I agree with the Bill of Rights.  I believe we are a free country, but not as free as some others.<br>  7) I support Israel.<br>  8) BBC<br>  9) No.<br>  10) Yes, I believe in equal rights for everyone, homosexuals included.

I think you need to stop wiping your @ss with dried corn cobs.|`|7J69CQvTaa	1) Racism is worse.But PC is bullsh*t as well. Everybody has the right to freedom of speech.Censoring words is not something a free country should be doing.<br>  <br>  2) Yes<br>  <br>  3) No. And I am libertarian<br>  <br>  4) I don't think anything of them. Individuals may alter their own bodies as they wish.It's their choice.<br>  <br>  5) Only those done in the first trimester<br>  <br>  6)Yes and yes<br>  <br>  7) Neither side is correct.

Which is worse?<br>  Well neither are really any good but trying to be politically correct like like reverse-racism. I'd say racism is worse but politically correctness is just dumb.<br>  <br>  2) Should we bring our troops from all other countries?<br>  Unfortunatley we got into a situation that prevents us of just saying see ya and leaving. We have to gradually move out. We should have never been there in the first place.<br>  <br>  3) Do you believe in God? Are you conservative, liberal or moderate?<br>  No I don't and I am very liberal.<br>  <br>  4) What do you think of people who smoke marijuana?<br>  Honestly I don't even care. I for one won't ever because it is still harmfull and stuff but it certainly isn't as harmfull as some of the LEGAL stuff. Legalize it.<br>  <br>  5) Do you agree with ALL cases of abortion?<br>  No. Abortion os okay by me but I can see it being exploited and abused. I should still be legal though.<br>  <br>  6) Do you truly believe in the 1st amendment of the constitution? Do you believe we are a less free country these days?<br>  Yes of course I do. Whether or not we are still "free" is hard to say. I am only 17 and the world has been basically the same since I started to care. It's really all I know. The Patriot Act is bullshit, but it was created in times of fear and will be removed. I do still understand that war is a bad time for anyone.<br>  <br>  7) Israel-Palestinian issue. Whose side are you on?<br>  Neutral.<br>  <br>  8) BBC World vs Fox/any American channel. Which is better?<br>  Well they're both biased. I would like a news channel that isn't biased but it's never going to happen. Fox is pushing it though.<br>  <br>  9) Do you think speaking against the govt is anti-American?<br>  Speaking out against the government is the most American thing. The only reason America exists was to give old England the middle finger.<br>  <br>  10) Do you believe gays should be allowed to be married, and the conservative beliefs should be stifled?<br>  Yes they should. Rights outweigh beliefs anyday.|`|V610w8EXaa	1) Political correctness vs racism. Which is worse?<br>  <br>  Political correctness is worse ... everyone is a racist, to some degree.<br>  <br>  2) Should we bring our troops from all other countries?<br>  <br>  No ... but we need to be more selective in where we send them.<br>  <br>  3) Do you believe in God? Are you conservative, liberal or moderate?<br>  <br>  No.  Socially liberal, fiscally conservative ... and I want to deport ALL of the illegal aliens ... NO EXCUSES.<br>  <br>  4) What do you think of people who smoke marijuana?<br>  <br>  Drug-head losers.<br>  <br>  5) Do you agree with ALL cases of abortion?<br>  <br>  No ... shouldn't be allowed after 10 weeks but under really limited circumstances ... that's plenty of time to cancel out your decision to be a "whore" ... <br>  <br>  6) Do you truly believe in the 1st amendment of the constitution? Do you believe we are a less free country these days?<br>  <br>  Sure, I believe in the First Amendment ... but I also believe in being able to bash in someone's teeth with a bat if they have an opposing viewpoint.  A "less-free" country?  They shut down the Loompanics Unlimited bookstore ... 'nuff said.<br>  <br>  7) Israel-Palestinian issue. Whose side are you on?<br>  <br>  I think we need to nuke BOTH of them ... who gives a rat's azz about EITHER one of those shyt-hole countries?  Not ME.<br>  <br>  8) BBC World vs Fox/any American channel. Which is better?<br>  <br>  BBC World probably gives a more unbiased view ... but you can't put "Fox" in the same league as any other American channel ... because FOX NEWS SUUUUUUUUCKS BIG TIME.<br>  <br>  9) Do you think speaking against the govt is anti-American?<br>  <br>  Definitely not ... but as we saw in Waco in 1993, in can be dangerous to your health.<br>  <br>  10) Do you believe gays should be allowed to be married, and the conservative beliefs should be stifled?<br>  <br>  Why not let the gays get married?  Who is it hurting?  Like hetero marriage is some kind of "nirvana"?  You don't have to stifle the conservatives ... they make themselves look silly enough as it is.|`|5a2969878efc1ea28cb5f1d0e5c13b07aa	1. racism<br>  2. no<br>  3. no<br>  4. nothing<br>  5. no<br>  6. yes, yes<br>  7. neither<br>  8. bbc<br>  9. no<br>  10. yes|`|b9fa55c39cc9291237dc7e9acd8e7119aa	1) Racism simply because it's fueled by hate.

In a city of 18 million, it is wildly improbable that the handful of Jews there were chosen at random.<br>  <br>  Despite the religious declaration of the surviving gunman and the claims of responsibility for the violence by the Mujahideen, giving credit to Allah, the New York Times predictably refused to call the mass murder spree an act of Islamic terror.

QYu8KrXTaa	Hi, my prepared article is below. BUT THE BIBLE HAS BEEN CHANGED!!<br>   Yes the words have been changed but the message is still the same. Archaeologists who<br>  dig up old texts even of the Old Testament find near 100% the same message when they<br>  translate to today’s language.<br>  This is why the translation has been updated and corrected. It was written mostly in Old<br>  Hebrew and Greek and has to be translated into our languages. But our language changes. How<br>  would you like to be reading “charity” when it means “love” or “unicorns” when it should have<br>  been “wild bulls”? The first common translation, the King James Version (KJV), is in<br>  Shakespearian English. The KJV is a perfectly good Bible which has taken the Gospel almost<br>  to the ends of the Earth but it contains these words we don’t use today or that have changed<br>  their meaning. So the changes are to put God’s message into today’s words. This is what was<br>  done when the KJV was translated to the language of the day so that the common people could<br>  read it. Now there are many people and committees who have studied the texts and translated<br>  the Bible. This is not only to English but is now in more languages than any other book. As<br>  well as language update archaeologists and linguists have found more evidence on the meaning<br>  of the old mostly unused languages. So one place where KJV said “unicorns”, the new versions<br>  correctly say “wild bulls” solving a criticism that the Bible talked about fictional animals. The<br>  problem was an error in language not in the original. So the statement can be made that we are<br>  reading exactly what the prophets and apostles wrote and exactly the 66 books selected by the<br>  early church leaders as canon (rule) or inspired. Of course translation always involves the risk<br>  of bias. This is a small problem and even the worst versions still basically contain God’s<br>  massage. So read one or more and see what it says. It is the instruction manual for life and is<br>  the most life changing book we have. Its message affects eternity and so is different to any<br>  other book on earth. 2 Timothy3.16 All Scripture is God-breathed (inspired) and is useful for<br>  teaching, rebuking, correcting and training in righteousness, 17so that the man of God may be<br>  thoroughly equipped for every good work. NIV. The Bible also has the highest record for<br>  accuracy of transmission of text, and the oldest copies are closer to the dates of the original<br>  writings than any other ancient literature.<br>   If you are seeking the truth read the Gospel of John, “Sanctify them by the truth; your<br>  word is truth”. The book of Acts and Genisis. To be saved you need to believe Jesus died on the<br>  cross for your sin and ask Him into your life. Be willing to turn from sin with His help. Now<br>  live for Him by worshipping God, learning of Him in His word and owning Him before others.<br>  May God bless you as you seek the TRUTH. nev r email welcome|`|kWz0nEdBaa	I lean towards the King James Version but you are right in stating that [art (second sentence).

You have the Catholic version, the KJV version, the various Protestant sects' versions; in fact there are more than 50 versions of the bible. <br>  <br>  The bible has been written by various men. The original texts (as revealed in the original languages) of the bible no longer exists. The versions that exist today in various languages have been grossly misrepresented in the process of being translated. Not only that new things have added, whilst other things in the original version had been dropped. So much so there evolved so many contradictions in the translated bible.<br>  <br>  If you want originality, the Quran is really your answer. The Quran has superseded both the Taurat (Torah) and the Injeel (New Testament).  The Quran has maintained its originality ever since it was first revealed (in stages over 23 years) some 1,416 years ago. The Quran contains the truth and it is the most accurate divinely revealed scripture still in existence today.

tZF64L7yaa	I can't hate my exes, because I truly loved them...and couldn't stop loving them, no matter what they did to me. My mom always told me to cut ties with people after a breakup, but I never could. She always said you can't stay friends, but I never wanted to give up on someone. I think it is because I have had other people abandon me in my life, and so could not fathom doing that to another person. I could really put myself into another person's shoes, and feel what it would be like to have someone totally not love me anymore. My father had abandoned me, and I knew that it made me really sad. I didn't like the thought of that feeling. I was sent to a Catholic school as a kid, and even though I do not practice a religion, I still see the value in the philosophy of treating others as you would want to be treated, so there is value to the basic idea. I think you are just a person with a lot of empathy, and you can't treat her in an unkind manner. Now some people would tell us that we have low self esteems or that we put up with abuse because we fear future abandonment, or that we therefore have a personality disorder, but I don't believe that. I believe that we are mature in our treatment of others, and are not selfish, and that we are willing to do anything to help someone else. What a beautiful thing. I would not worry about your inability to hate her. If she doesn't love you, it truly is her loss, because she's missing out on a really kind person who obviously cares about her. She is obviously a bit immature. Maybe she will grow up over time, or maybe she won't. I'd just answer the phone if she calls and be nice to her. You can still date someone new, if you'd like, but you don't have to hate her or throw her memory in the trash... you'll always be there for her. You're what they call a real, true friend.|`|NQUhVnGPaa	Where I come from there's a saying: "who doesn't love , has never loved"<br>  <br>  So since it works backwards  I'd say you loved her and so you cannot hate what you once loved. It is not possible.<br>  <br>  But she doesn't seem to love you.|`|So1ROzM4aa	You can't hate her because you still love her. You don't want to hate anyway, it's a waste of time. Hang in there and hopefully the love will fade to indifference, which is much healthier and less destructive.|`|wSeOxs7Jaa	You don't need to hate her but you do need to get over her. Next time she call you up for some loving or anything else you need to start saying no. You're not going to find someone else until you move on from her and you need to keep your distance to do that.|`|fdkegbwgaa	hating is not the answer but you do need to cut the strings.  I know exactly where you are coming form because I was like this with my ex on and off for 2 years, now I have cut the cords, but I don't hate her, it is a waste of time and effort to hate.  you need to start saying no to her. Go on some assertiveness training it help me, and will boost your self esteem, block her number if you need to so that you are not tempted to help her for a while.<br>  You are not a door mat and you have needs too.|`|AA12082232	Set your boundaries.  What do you want?  Setting limits means being prepared to make sacrifices like losing friends or lovers who refuse to respect your limits.   Until you make clear to yourself and her where you stand, be prepared for her to walk all over you and of course, for more heart ache.<br>  <br>  Also, while hate might not be helpful, feeling your anger can help.  It's a warning sign that your boundaries have been violated.|`|c2YcBbXyaa	hating her won't do you any good....but you should stop letting her use you....move on with your life and tell her she should do the same....|`|aYVVwjBXaa	why would you want to? how will that help you?|`|3EZfZ8gwaa	Because you still love her... simple

SZTm6mwmaa	This is an interesting question. I suppose a new or immature Christian could believe parts of the Bible contain errors because of there background. But they can not disagree with the main doctrine or who Jesus Christ is, Truth about Salvation, I think you get my train of thought. As they mature in Christ they should be changing their mind & heart about the Word of God. That it is infallible and without error. <br>  <br>  A person can know the bible inside & out and not be a Christian also. In order to have a personal relationship with Jesus Christ , you must yield your heart , not have a mind full of bible text.|`|yqUgRG2raa	Do you not understand, look, in science, if you want to send a rocket UP into space you must use a DOWN ward force.

There are some exaggerations and some of the stories my be lessons rather than true stories, like the book of Job.  The book of ecclesiastes is based on opinion so it is not perfect truth.  If you believe everything in the bible is true then that's OK.  I used to believe that too.  The bible doesn't contradict itself in my opinion.  It just tells different sides of the story.  I am a Christian.  I think that the word of God is living and active.  The word of God is Jesus.  It's not just a bible which doesn't cover even a fragment of God's true word.  Yes you can be a Christian who doesn't believe that the bible is perfect.  All things on earth are imperfect.  The men who wrote the bible were inspired by God but that didn't make them or their writings perfect.

kkRCFT6Faa	Catherine of Aragon married Henry's older brother Arthur in 1501 when she was about 16. Arthur died about 6 months later and Catherine was betrothed to Henry. Henry's father wanted to keep her dowry but didn't want a Spanish alliance and so kept her in near poverty for 4 years until Henry VII died and the young Henry the VIII married her.<br>  As she was unable to produce a male heir he applied to the Pope for an annulment but this wasn't going to happen because of Mary and Anne Bolyen was already pregnant, so he rejected Catholism and the Pope and divorced poor Catherine instead. She was made to give up her title and position in court and was made Princess Dowager.|`|KCpGsN2faa	Don't listen to that moron. Anne wasn't Henry's freakin daughter. They had a daughter together, who became Elizabeth I but thats it. And there was never any conclusive proof that Anne slept with her brother George. She couldn't produce a male heir, Anne had no friends at court, so she was beheaded so Henry could marry Jane Seymour (who was like 6 month pregnant at Anne's execution) who bore his son Edward. Henry was obsessed with having a male heir, thats one of the reasons he married so many times. I would highly recommend you watch "The Other Boleyn Girl" with Natalie Portman and Scarlet Johanssen.

When Henry was going to marry Catherine, they claimed her marriage to Arthur was never consummated, therefore Henry could marry her. But the real reason was Catherine did not have a son, or at least one that lived past very early infancy. <br>  <br>  When Henry fell in love with Anne Boleyn, he claimed Catherine and Arthur had consummated the relationship, therefore she could not legally be his Queen. I think he just used it as an excuse, whether Arthur and Catherine had been together or not had little to do with the divorce. <br>  <br>  I did not see the show, but I don't know he felt guilty about the marriage, maybe about leaving his wife and daughter, or maybe not.|`|EpWvrL6Yaa	Is the Tutors a new T.V programme about teachers?<br>  <br>  Edit......I apologise,I was being facetious.It was as the other contributor,Trouble,said.She was married to his brother and he conveniently felt guilty about it when she couldn't produce an heir.|`|bda465ikaa	The concept of "incest by affinity" exists.

He wanted to keep his options open. However, he never remarried. <br>  ---------<br>  As far as I know in real life Henry the 8th had no problems marrying his brother's widow. He was always interested in her as a teenager. It was only after the marriage failed to produce a male heir that he raised it as a problem.<br>  ---------<br>  As an adult, Catherine claimed that her first marriage to Arthur was never consummated. It seems unlikely since they were both healthy 15 year old teenagers, They were also watched during their wedding night.|`|NYU37jfGaa	Henry and Catherine didn't have a son, and Henry worried that it was because God was displeased with him for marrying his brother's widow, even though he had a dispensation from the Pope for doing this.  And the Bible is in any case somewhat contradictory on the subject, since in one passage it says aman should not marry his brother's widow, and in another passage it says he should.  All rather confusing really.<br>  <br>  He then met and fell in love with Anne Boleyn, which gave impetus to his desire to annul his marriage to Catherine.  However, Catherine was not willing to be annuled, which led to a lot of trouble.  It is a pity in a way that Catherine could not have gone quietly, because if she had done we might not have had the Reformation and a lot of suffering could have been avoided.  But Catherine was not willing to be shunted aside like that.  she had a lot of spirit.<br>  <br>  There is absolutely no truth in the rumour that Henry was Anne's father.  For a start, he would have had to have been extremely young when he slept with Anne's mother, and in any case he always denied having anything to do with her.  When he was thinking about marrying Anne, he got a dispensation from the Pope because he had slept with Anne's sister Mary, and if he had slept with her mother as well I am sure he would have wanted a dispensation for that too.  He was, in his own peculiar way, a very m oral man.
WyICbuPqaa	No on both counts.<br>  By the way, priests in our church are about 16 years old.  Perhaps she talked to a Bishop or High Priest.<br>  <br>  To get married in the Temple, both the groom and the bride have to be interviewed and found worthy by their Bishops and by their Stake Presidents.

t2X5Oj42aa	oh hun,<br>  you sound confused.<br>  <br>  well, here's my answer.<br>  Jesus died for all of us. simple right?<br>  and that's the only reason why Jeffery Dahmer is able to go to heaven.<br>  The only reason. on other.<br>  <br>  I'm very sure your grandma was a wonderful person. Even so, if she did not believe in Jesus as her Savior or that He died for her sins or believe in the trinity ( i do not know if she did) she would not be able to go to heaven.<br>  See what I mean? It does sound unfair. that's why Christians are trying to hard to tell EVERYONE about what Christ did for them, so that no one misses out on hearing this and accepting His salvation for us.<br>  Jesus has paid Jeffrey's sin, IN FULL, when He died on the cross centuries ago.<br>  Jesus in the ONLY way we can go to heaven. no matter how many good deeds we have achieved on earth, it's all uselss usless we accept Jesus. Because we can't save ourself.<br>  <br>  I hope my answer helped. Thanks for letting me voice out :)|`|RGMnbDPNaa	The only way to get to heaven is to believe that, jesus died on the cross for us,and believe that he is our saviour. we can't get to heaven by doing good deeds or living a sinless life, jesus paid our way to heaven by dying on the cross for our sins..... did you Grandma believe that jesus died on the cross for her, and accepted him as her saviour.<br>  God bless|`|CBmizuGwaa	...Look !

In any case, <br>  whatever you believe or do not believe, we can all agree on one thing, that is: if,<br>   hypothetically speaking or otherwise, there is a Being so powerful to <br>  have created the universe, his creations (that's us) would not be able to understand all of his actions and motivations. We want salvation to be based on merit, yet that is not what God decided.<br>  <br>  It is central to Christian belief to not judge other people, but leave <br>  that to God.I do not know your Grandmother's heart, or indeed what part of Jesus she may have accepted after all, being a Jehovah's witness. Also, I do not know Dahmer's heart or how genuine his acceptance of Jesus was.<br>  <br>  You are however correct, it is possible for people who by the looks of it<br>   did a lot of good and yet not end up being saved. And it is possible for <br>  people who did mostly bad (or evil), and yet be saved because they truly repent and accept Jesus. The point of the Bible is that nobody really deserves heaven anyway. God opened this path to salvation out of grace, not merit. I know that belief does not go down well today, where self rightiousness is high fashion. Yet that is what the Bible teaches, and it does not change according to what is popular at a given age.<br>  <br>  The good news of this is as long as you live, it is never too late. See also the answers of Syntache, Tammie and Lauryn. Also Truthteller (repentance must be genuine).|`|93galWG1aa	Is the question is this fair or right?<br>  if so only people who reject God and work for evil go to hell.<br>  The catholics know of a place called Purgatory where one purifies self because of the sin and mistakes.<br>  God is known for his Great Mercy.|`|8OeulLkmaa	How do you know Dahmer is in heaven?  People are generally "sorry" when they get caught.  They are filled with regret because they are caught.  Only God knows whether or not he Truly repented.  I find it highly unlikely.  He can't repent unless the Holy Spirit brings conviction.  That's why the Bible says to seek the Lord while he may be found, or in the window that He approaches you.  Which in Dahmer's case, was probably BEFORE anybody was murdered.  Nobody can come to the Father unless the Holy Spirit draws them to him.  You can't be "born-again" through your own will because YOUR WILL has to be surrendered.|`|kWz0nEdBaa	A man cannot be saved by good works or anything gained by personal merit, such as merely joining a religious service. Notice the Old Testament saint, Abraham.  The New Testament says of him "For if Abraham was justified by works, he has something to boast about, but not before God.  For what does the Scripture say? "Abraham believed God, and it was accounted to him for righteousness."<br>  What God says about His Son is true. You probably heard it : For God so loved the world that He gave His only begotten Son, that whosoever believes in Him should not perish, but have eternal life.|`|HMteUyRdaa	Dangermint, how the heck do you know your grandmother went to hell? Do you really think that you know the mind of God? How do  you know that Dahmer is in Heaven? You can not presume to know the mind of God, that is very prideful on your part.<br>  <br>  Love,<br>  Kate|`|fOfJz9OMaa	Merely saying so is meaningless, but only with sincerity of heart; and repentance, which only God knows whether the person was sincere or not.  As for affiliation, God is no respecter of person; but they that fear Him, and work righteousness are accepted with Him.|`|eYs8DpbBaa	Christians have negated hell with their dogma. Their belief is Jesus died for the sins of all mankind. Since all sins are forgiven and paid for, no one has to go to hell.

But sometimes people have strong feelings about there beliefs and will defend them, as what has been already mentioned. Like for example this 'just trying to care' guy. I don't Know about you but what he says about helping people to see the light and other stuff, etc frustrates me and probably other people too. This is what causes people to retaliate to defend their beliefs whether they are christian, athiest or Jewish, etc. I do know that some people do go on yahoo answers to frustrate religious people, majority being atheists but it'll never change while we live in a world like this. I think your a good person to respect other peoples beliefs. I'm in the opposite situation where I have some really cool friends who are religious, when Im a athiest. We live in a hateful and harmful world, and its just how it is and I believe will always be.

There's entrenched positions, making it impossible to get a hearing in some quarters especially, when you try to present a reasonable argument.  I'm sure it can't be like that in other Answers sections, because they're more to do with simple facts, but not so here!<br>  <br>  Don't get discouraged.  It's clear that Christians are trying to make a reasonable impact on R&S and they are doing, but everyone will, in the end, take his own.  I started off a bit savage, but I have learned to be kind, so you do learn a lot as you keep at it.<br>  <br>  It's difficult, when people ask 'what do you think about ...' and you know that you believe that thing is wrong.  They are asking for a straight answer - well, sometimes.  However, those are generally not the best kinds of questions, I've found.  As you say, there are a lot of questions which one can answer and thereby prove, without a lot of contending, that your God and your faith are worth considering.<br>  <br>  Basically, I reckon it's best to let people condemn themselves out of their own mouths and don't jump in and join them, because if I do, then I'm no better than them, and it doesn't matter who started it.  Scripture says we should speak with 'salt' but also with 'grace'.  I personally find, if you are addressing a genuine seeker, they will recognize when you are speaking the truth, read your spirit and even accept a reproof, because they see you are speaking to edify them and out of concern for their wellbeing above all else.  It's about learning to write so you communicate, and the spirit behind the writing must come through.  As you say, a genuine message of love and a desire to help, but a billious spirit of hate and bad temper cuts no ice.<br>  <br>  There are some folk who post on here who genuinely need help.  It's a pity we have to wade through all this garbage in order to get to them, but there you are.  We shall never do our work without opposition, so better get used to it and carry on regardless, overcoming evil with good!<br>  <br>  Do you remember when Isaac found that his enemies had filled in the wells his father Abraham had dug?  What did Isaac do?  He re-dug them.  What's more, whenever they filled them in again, he re-dug them again.<br>  <br>  Pull out a dandelion often enough and you'll exhaust the root.  If it is our job to 'pull out dandelions' why should we tire of it?  When the Lord, one day, comes for us, let him find us busy about his business.

The Catholic Church has apologized for things done unjustly in the past. <br>  <br>  It is very easy to judge others in hindsight. We all know now the outcome of certain things, that were not obvious at the time. Many of the things we consider "unjust" were meant in good faith at the time. Much of the Church's actions were determined by the society at that time as well. Medieval society was a violent one. All Christians were Catholics, and saying heretical things was a civil offense punishable by death. Its difficult to judge the Church as it existed in a time that no longer exists. The Church has continued but the society is long gone. <br>  <br>  Additionally, the claims of "millions" is exaggerated, mostly by anti-Catholics. There are also mitigating circumstances, that have long lost their understanding in today's world.<br>  <br>  Protestants were just as violent towards Catholics during the reformation. Can we somehow hold the Protestant churches accountable for their crimes against Catholics? What about Rome? The early Christian Church was persecuted and many Christians fed to lions...does someone want to petition the courts to hold Rome accountable? How about Russia and Germany for their atrocities?

kKQ9Jp8haa	She sounds like she's afraid to lose you. Granted, she's lied to you (quite a bit, from the sounds of things) but I can only agree with the reasoning that it was so you'd see her as someone you could relate to. She probably DOES fear that you'll get bored of her, or that you won't feel as close to her if you can't relate to her on that level. Just sit her down and explain that her being honest with you will bring you closer, and that you love her for who she really is more than any story she could make up.<br>  <br>  It also sounds like she was trying to bridge the gap of experience between the two of you so you wouldn't think poorly of her.<br>  <br>  Take it easy on her.

uLHCY6Qmaa	Good question. Everybody has a "hood". It's basically the neighborhood where you were brought up or that you live in. When referring to the "hood" generally in a large city, it usually can mean the "bad" part of town, possibly the poor part of town. It depends, that's the place I would probably head in a city, because it's usually the most fun place in a city, too. Dangerous? Maybe, too... but you only live once!<br>  Ghetto has also been bastardized to mean the bad part of a city or town. However, it used to mean that the same type of people occupied a certain area, such as the German ghetto, the gay ghetto. When used this way, ghetto does not necessarily mean a bad place. (Trust me, I make good money, but would not be able to afford a house in the gay ghettos of e.g. San Francisco or Seattle)<br>  Now, as far as your silly kids go. If they are planning to flit around the "hoods" or "ghettos" in areas of NYC or Newark (!), they had better have their heads screwed on tight before they do so. Street smarts and sensibility go hand in hand when you visit. Tell them to be careful!<br>  Auntie Kookoo|`|CNDdRFR2aa	Technically ghetto is defined as an area where one ethnic group is dominate. Sort of like during the immigration boom in the 1800 and early 1900's, all the Irish immigrants would live near each other and the Italians and so forth. Chinatown is even considered by some it's own ghetto because of the Chinese culture packing together in one part of San Francisco. That's why some people refer to some parts of towns and cities as "WASPy areas" because they are White Anglo Saxon Protestants.<br>  <br>  "The hood" is a different story. You have to explain that "the hood" is a bad part of an inner city community, such as a dangerous neighborhood. If they try to act low lifey even though they live in a good middle to upperclass suburban community, tell them they aren't impressing anybody. Remember, "the hood" will exist as long as there are uneducated people who do not act classy. Not to say it's not fun once and awhile to act gangsta....

Everyone always wishes they could sit with someone they wanted to talk to instead.

They are grown ups so let them sit with who they want to sit with.  <br>  <br>  Have multiple tables and multiple chairs so that some chairs can be empty at each table.  Have a table for the Bride and Groom.  As he has step mom's and dad's who don't get along, don't worry about doing a table for the parents.  Merely introduce them when they walk in as Father of the Groom and his wife, Mother of the Groom and her husband.  Everyone goes to their corners.  As for the childish brother who left his own father off his invite list, it was going to be a topic anyway.  You can't stop that.  But you can give a toast that rather puts them in their place if they have any respect for you.

A little line like that should be able to keep a civil tongue in their head for the 3-4 hours you are asking of them.

5yFnjp56aa	Your question is baseless. Islam being preached in modern days is different from Islam of Baba Muhammad. Mullahs are more behind rat race of converting than advocating qualities in life. Many of them abused children, women, fellow muslims but still they are muslims. Talibans are considered as hard liner muslims and look what they have brought in Afghanistan. Similar story is of Sudan and Somalia. Truth is one. There is one human and one God and different ways to approach him. Do we have christian chemistry or muslim physics or Hindu algebra. If you are keen you can enlighten yourself with virtues from all religions and if you have guts you can also attack meaningless rituals in them. I think all religion but Sikhism clearly says this you do not have to be a Sikh to realise Him who is sitting inside you.<br>  <br>  Edit: Oops I also attack meaningless rituals in Sikh religion and can tell rationale behind them. You either say my points are true or wrong, do not indulge in stupid arguements. If you have any thinking, you should have started thinking why you are claiming as Sikh. You can not think because only a sane can think.|`|lKBoTN7Vaa	Actually the reverse is more factual through not just tidbits they stole but some stolen from Christianity as well .|`|0Mi6AQwxaa	very little<br>  <br>  To understand Sikhism you have to understand Hinduism. Hinduism is not Christianity and Islam which are codified religions, and have a book and a prophet. Hinduism has originated from various rituals tribal customs and social life over the centuries. Hinduism has 1000’s of Gods and Goddesses and various diverse thoughts. <br>  <br>  Predominant amongst these thoughts is a way of life called Sanatan Dharma which more than 60% of the Hindus follow, and this is generally mistaken as Hinduism, and the other thoughts are treated as offshoots of Hinduism. The real truth is that Hinduism means Sanatan Dharma AND all the other thoughts. Sikhism is but one of these thoughts. <br>  <br>  Firstly, the British with their policy of divide and rule, and secondly, political turmoil and hatred between Hindus and Sikhs has put the idea of a separate identity in the mind of us Sikhs. Many of my co-religionists will say – but we have different ideas as compared to Hinduism. Sure - I agree that we are different in ways but there are 50 – 100 major different thoughts within Hinduism and we are BUT one of them. <br>  <br>  Do you understand ? Whereas fundamentalist Sikhs we say that we are 1 amongst 7 great world religions the fact is that there are actually 4 great religions. One - Christianity has various branches - Catholic, Protestant, Methodist, Adventist, etc. Second – Islam has various branches - Shia, Sunni, Ahmediya etc. There is Judaism and finally Hinduism ( which is a collection of various beautiful thoughts like Buddhism, Sanatana Dharma, Sikhism, Jainism, Arya Samajists, Vaishnav, Shaivaites Manbhum, Santhal etc ) <br>  <br>  So Sikhism is born out of Hinduism. Guru Nanak was born a Hindu, he was a traveling holy man who followed a custom of Sant Mat ( or Saint Tradition ) quite popular amongst saints those days. It was a thought he inculcated in his believers and told them to learn it. His believers were called Sikhs as Sikh means – ‘to learn’ We had 9 more Gurus. Yes Guru Nanak also took some minor feedback from Islam but that is the nature of Hinduism – to absorb from everyone.<br>  <br>  EDIT - Steelboy is a sikh fanatic who attacks all other religions and does not understand that one mans meat is another man's poisin. What is faith for one person is meaningless ritual for another. <br>  <br>  When Steelboy says ' if you have guts you can also attack meaningless rituals.......' does he realise that the faith many Sikhs have in keeping our hair unshorn since our birth and wearing 6-9 metres of cloth wrapped around our heads in India's Summer heat is faith to Sikhs but a meaningless - nay abnormal ritual to others? Does he have the guts to call this a meaningless ritual ?|`|1gA07a1Caa	Zero Percent ..<br>  The question should be How Much percent of Islam is influenced by Sikhism ?! <br>  <br>  Islam reveal to Adam passing Jesus  and finally Muhammad (peace be upon them all) <br>  All these messenger of God sent to the people to show the guidance of The Only True God <br>  <br>   you need to read more ..<br>  <a href="http://www.ilovezakirnaik.com/misconceptions/c03.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.ilovezakirnaik.com/misconcept...</a>

3sKU83sPaa	Everyone knows that gays/lesbians are attracted to every single person of the same sex that they come in contact with! We are incapable of committed relationships and like to seduce the straight into our wicked ways!!! Sorry, that one called for a little sarcasm.<br>  <br>  But if you're looking for a legitimate answer, I think they do it for the same reason they have men and women in different dorms. Sex = Drama = Emotional Messes = Unfocused Soldiers.<br>  <br>  Of course, this is just my opinion, it's not based on any facts.|`|SZdVYrSSaa	The common argument used by retired military professionals and republican congressmen is that adding homosexuals to a unit would disrupt the brotherhood between the unit, causing discomforting tension and ultimately hurting the unit's ability to continue operating with machine-like closeness and precision.<br>  <br>  The interesting thing about this, is that it is the very same argument that anti-feminist congressmen and retired military used against allowing women into active military service 30 years ago, and as well, it is also the same rhetoric that was used by segregationist congressmen and retired military to prevent "colored" peoples into the military over 150 years ago.<br>  <br>  And yet, every time the government overturns a separatist ideal in military service, the Armed Forces of the United States becomes considerably larger and more powerful than it was before. <br>  <br>  You think they would have learned by now?|`|V5lxDoIRaa	It would not interfere.

GPZUfFZ1aa	According to Christianity, the Devil is the distilled epitome of evil.  The only problems with this are that first, he was created by God, and second, that his name, Lucifer, means Light Bringer.  By Christian definition, he is evil because he delights in misery etc.  For me, this kind of evil is a bit lame - a tad two-dimensional.  Like, when he takes over the universe and subjects all things to his diabolical will, what then?  Sit back with a bowl of cheezels and watch porn?<br>  <br>  According to Islam, the Devil defied God and in that he was evil.  When Allah demanded all things to bow down to his creation of "man" Lucifer refsed, saying that he was a subject of God and God alone.  For this he was cast away from Paradise, so I am not sure if the Islamic Devil would quite correspond with my notion of evil.<br>  <br>  Another slant on the idea is that of evil being a matter of choice.  If we are indeed created by God, then do we really have a choice at all in what we do?  I like animals, and I do not like suffering, so I am kind to them, but only because I want to be.  If I found pleasure in being mean, I would be.  It is a long-winded argument, but basically, morality is a subjective, relative thing.|`|y8XVhhmmaa	The devil is as evil as it gets. He rebelled because of selfish amibition.<br>  In the pre-existance, he presented a plan that would take away man's agency and demanded that he be rewarded with the glory of God for<br>  saving our spirits by not letting them choose between good and evil.<br>  His plan was rejected and he rebelled because of his own lack of <br>  humility.<br>  (Jesus had already been chosen, and it had already been decided that<br>  man would be given the right to choose and that some would fall and<br>  not reach exaltation, though most will recieve salvation.)|`|chmzBaiTaa	it was said that, Lucifer's greediness drive him evil.|`|A6ej3lQWaa	its the devils greediness and selfishness that drove him to hell and evel.|`|9KeaTUh6aa	I would suggest you familiarize yourself with the Bible. I'm an atheist and I have read pretty much everything canonical from Torah to Quran to teachings of the Buddha to the Bahagavad Ghita. The scriptures portray the character in a number of ways using multiple names. The Torah's conception is the closest to what you are suggesting. Ha-Satan is the character in the story of Job who insists, with God's permission, that Job be punished physically after he submits to God's will. The confusion began somewhat before and then became propagated by early Christians, who mixed conceptions of Ha-Satan with Lucifer (Latin for "morning star"). His story is an amalgam. Basically, Lucifer is an archangel (like many other archangels) who is subservient to God. When Lucifer aspires to rise above God, he is cast from God's presence and forced to dwell in what became the conception of Hell. Of course, Hell in an early Christian and Talmudic sense is Sheol, the place where one is not in the presence of God. This is the ultimate punishment for an angel, for the angels are meant to be subservient to Big G. The other section comes form Isaiah, where the passage actually refers to a Babylonian king who seeks to rise above God and is punished for his treatment of God (and thus the Jews).<br>  <br>  Rebel leaders, in my opinion, aren't rebel leaders unless they have a totalitarian to rebel against. Or at least a bunch of X-Wings.|`|AA10729675	Yes, the devil is evil.|`|stAeoUeSaa	You are NOT an atheist in any way shape or form.<br>  Satan is more evil than you know and most people have underestimated him severely as they will soon find out since the Tribulation is at hand:<br>  summer 2009 -summer 2016|`|x7qtyglzaa	He committed treason against his own creator and he always do a lot of bad things.

AA11047076	A Beit Midrash is simply a place where Torah is studied.  Frequently multiple sessions are happening at the same time- groups will cluster around a table analyzing and discussing some specific aspect of Jewish law, studying a section of the Torah or Talmud or discussing philosophical and ethical issues.<br>  <br>  Sessions are most often interactive- there will often be one person who leads the discussion and debate, but that is not always the case.  You will also find groups of two- known as chavrusas, where the two study together on a regular basis and often spend a lot of time on a specific section in order to learn, and understand it properly.<br>  <br>  Since this is often all in a large hall like room, with the different groups seperated only by being at a different table, it can look, and sound, quite chaotic.|`|qs8qPhEUaa	The Beit Midrash is where the men learn torah.

e0eb82b689e1db392eb51c89982ed115aa	I was raised a STRICT Wisconsin Synod Lutheran. I went to the private schools and all. My parents were task masters when it came to religion. Despite it all, I grew up as an atheist unbeknown to my parents. I still am a little spiritual (more that the earth has a spirit rather than a "god") but I don't believe totally in a structured religion. So when I met my Significant other I was fine with him being a Hindu. He was insistent that I be respectful and tolerant of his religion and that I can do with no problem. Though I dont believe in it, and I dont think he really does to an extent, he however DOES respect it because it was how he was raised, culturally. Hindu is a MUCH more lenient and forgiving type of religion and more tolerable to me. He has never demanded I BECOME a Hindu but that I just observe it... thats how a relationship should be and should behave if you choose to be with someone that does NOT believe the same as you. If you choose a partner solely for love and not for compatibility you are in for a heart break every single time.|`|FAx5XNE3aa	If you have adopted a new religion since meeting your partner then it is likely that you have also changed.  For example if you were a polytheist when you met and are now a monotheist, or if you were an atheist when you met and are now a polytheist then your worldview has changed and this new worldview will inform the decisions you make or the actions you take.  It is not possible to change religion without changing elements of who you are.  Your change in belief has killed the person that your partner fell in love with so it is immaterial if you still love them because you are now a different person.  Sad though it is if you truly believe in the religion you have adopted and the new person you have become is not the person your partner wants to be with you must split.  If you can just give up your religion then you don't actually have belief in it so you may be able to find the person you were by leaving the faith.  Either way I would suggest that if it has come to the point where you need to ask this question then your relationship is dieing if not dead already.  Sorry.|`|ce060a29a8e7cbb3f7cdc004ec90adc3aa	A partner who couldn't love me for who and what I am is NOT the sort of partner that I would want to spend the rest of my life with. I wouldn't make such a demand upon them, their Faith is a part of what sets them apart from all the rest sp, why should I want to change that aspect and risk changing everything else about them? Additionally, any partner that would be weak willed enough to make such a change based on my say so would not be the sort of partner that I would really want any way.<br>  <br>  Love is supposed to be unconditional. The type of love which your question suggests is a selfish kind and not the basis for a healthy relationship in the first place. If your partner wants YOU to change your Religion then have him or her change theirs as well and BOTH of you find a THIRD Religion to follow. If you are Wicca and he is Christian then BOTH of you convert to Islam or Buddhism. If YOU must change then so must your partner. If your partner can't because of his/her strong Faith then that is the same reason that YOU can't as well. Any Faith that is so weak as to be able tobe dropped in favor of the Faith of your partner would be just as weak in your partner's Faith as well.<br>  <br>  As you can see, this is so wrong on SO many levels that it is mind boggling. There are millions of mixed marriages in which each parnter is ble to respect and honor the beliefs and lifestyle of the other. To find yourself in a relationship where there is NO such honor and respect is only doing yourself AND your partner irrepairable harm.<br>  <br>  Brightest Blessings,<br>  Raji the Green Witch|`|bwigyPMTaa	You should have the answer before you get involved. God is your significant one.

Not even yourself.|`|WhQhWWzpaa	Hows this quote " Blessed are the pure in heart as they shall see God"... but then forms....I dont believe any great holy person has ever taught external forms were necessary for salvation. The power of attaining it is within ourselves. We live and move in God. Creeds and sects have their parts to play, but they are for chlidren, they last but temproarily. Books never make religions, but religons make books. We must not forget that. No book ever created God, but God inspired all great books. And nop book ever created a soul. We cant forget that, The end of all religions is the realising of God in the soul. That is the one universal religon. IF there is one universal truth in all religons, I placve it here in realising God. There may be a thousand different radii, but they all converge to one centre and that is the realisation of good. God is within! I hope that kinda answers your question|`|gKwKxJyNaa	well, if he doesn't respect it than he doesn't respect me...so i wouldn't.

They advise their followers to follow their instructions without examination. <br>  <br>  <br>  There are certain rules to be followed in religious research for the safety of any conclusion that may be reached. <br>  <br>  1. Never embrace a doctrine when evidence stands against it, nor should one follow a principle without evidence. <br>  <br>  If God wants a person to believe in a principle, He should make it clear and evident. He is the Most Fair and Just. He knows that belief is not a voluntary thing;<br>  <br>  <br>  2. Never accept popularity at face value. <br>   A religious researcher should not take the popularity of a religious doctrine in his society as an evidence of its truth.<br>  <br>  <br>  3. Inherited religious principles should be examined. <br>   Islam advises every adult to examine the religion which he inherited. Inherited religion, like any other religion, is subject to proof. <br>  <br>  <br>  4. Doubters are not excused. <br>   When a person is not committed to any religion and doubts the whole religious concept, he should not be satisfied with his doubt. It is his duty to protect himself and his vital interests in this world from any harm and damage. Similarly, he has the same responsibility and duty in protecting his spiritual interest from being damaged. <br>  <br>  <br>  5. When you conduct a religious research, let no one make decisions for you. Do not rely on the judgement of any other person, even if he is sincere and highly intellectual. <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  The most rewarding and meritorious attitude, in the eyes of Islam, is to approach religious issues with the spirit of a scientist who welcomes any evidence that may prove or disprove his theory (or a theory to which he may subscribe).|`|AA11466759	if it became a source of contention and not peace, yes<br>  and I have, for those reasons, and others...but that was one of them.<br>  <br>  why someone would do that to another is a complex issue, and one should deport themselves with as much diplomacy as possible.<br>  <br>  If a person is put in spiritual chains, they either escape them or accept them.|`|3RYqo9dJaa	Even if you leave it, it doesn't make you believe in it any less.

But, really since you need to eat while fasting you can eat at a certain time/times of the day. And you can have water. <br>  <br>  Why do it? It's supposed to bring you closer to your god, give you spiritual awakening, value things... <br>  <br>  Wikipedia has all the answers, as always:<br>  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fasting" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fasting</a>|`|ef0612ac6d1a48097cfac198882b948caa	FUEL AIR SPARK TECHNOLOGY .....|`|C9AbiTDdaa	speed<br>  fasting = not having food|`|hE4CXKX2aa	Fast has two meanings in english.  One of the means as in speed, that you are fast runner or your car goes fast.  The other means to go without eating.

Now we know what we're saying(me anyway.)  So in my case it's more powerful in my own language.|`|pnZssBg9aa	No it doesn't make a difference. God knows all languages and can see everything and hear everything, even prayers in different languages. I was like you before. I used to think if I prayed in Latin, God will hear me because I thought Latin was God's language. But nobody said you have to pray in Latin for God to hear you, not even in the Bible. It doesn't matter what language you pray in, God still hears.|`|c2fc70c8196fb6665f4605b33bcc57a4aa	The organisation that insists on using a DEAD language that only university scholars understand...is a DEAD organisation.|`|Hwe4MA6Faa	Especially when praying to Horus or Isis.|`|hQDapmICaa	No, it is more powerful when you pray in TRUTH and in the Spirit.<br>  <br>  Peace!|`|pbsrCPRAaa	No the Spirit is the only person who makes a difference in prayer....|`|nqfgt0BRaa	No.in the letter of John the Bible says-this is the confidence that we have ,that whatever  we ask for according to his will,N/B his will<br>  1.In james the Bible talks of (fervent prayer of a righteous man). then there's faith aspect. it has got nothing to do with a given language .my dear the best way to learn is to give it a trial, please pray now.|`|AA12147519	The language doesn't matter as long as you understand it.  What good is it to do a service in latin if nobody understands anything?  Same thing for praying.  How can it mean anything if you don't know what it means?|`|zQyslfHKaa	Jesus spoke Hebrew, he is probably scratching his head at all these English and Latin prayers clogging up his inbox.|`|nVCf8EC5aa	I do not think it matters what language you use for your telepathic communication.|`|14b43c5bae3d09bf80336812c8aece34aa	If God only understands Latin, then yes, otherwise no.|`|02QPXoS5aa	The answer is no.  God created all languages.  He knows and understands each one.|`|ceebbd5b347bf3b3c44701e742d76f97aa	God hears all prayers. Latin is for those in Rome. :D|`|32ed2884882d13680bd2f9e8ee367fc9aa	it may mean more to the person but not to the lord|`|fKFPiTEiaa	In Christian fantasy, possibly. In reality, it may only cause a variance in how much weight you place on it. In which case, it may affect your Faith. That's the real Ki/Energy/Power. So, maybe. The words we say affect our minds, and our minds affect our understanding, which is linked to our faith. So, it depends on the inner conveyance, and how it bolsters our will/understanding. Anyway, that's the way I think it is! I personally place more weight on Japanese. "Kami Sama," is a phrase you should learn to equate with "Lord God," when you're around me. :) P.S.: I don't place much weight on Latin. I'm more likely to place emphasis on Hebrew. Shalom! Arigato.|`|BwJOeHDEaa	of course, because obviously thats what jesus and the desciples spoke..so theyll be able to understand you...<br>  i dont think it matters, chinese christians pray in chinese, i pray in greek, some people pray in english...some peopel talk in tounges...i think god speaks all languages universally, he did create them didnt he?|`|ihqZX4GMaa	HAHA! Latins only screwed up christian works and killed Christians under Roman power. Then started a church that killed other Christians that disagree with them.<br>  <br>  So I'd say its less powerful.|`|209E8kyVaa	The bible never specifies a certain language to pray in and certainly not latin <br>  no matter what language you pray in God will hear|`|KNpkY3Pvaa	It is more powerful to pray in Latin, then is is to not pray in Latin.|`|3mDvjCa8aa	odGay eferspray igpay atinlay.<br>  <br>  odGay essBlay|`|d21602968207c0c2d97e342c8834fc7aaa	You ever try to play dominos on an omnibus?

Lol (:|`|jcL7gDMKaa	Offer her some body spray or perfume to use , it may cover up the smell to some extent! Poooh!! That would make me gag|`|01f5341d0d029dbc96f058ba056b39abaa	I would have said something playfully,like, "Oh no, your boots are off.  Do you mind? " I would have also considered moving to another free seat where I could do the same.  I've learned over the years that it is either myself or the other person who is going to be miserable and it's OK to speak up politely when in an uncomfortable situation..|`|yuBuNoPDaa	That's so rude. I would have asked her as politely as I could for her to put her boots back on. I would do so quietly. I would say - I'm sorry - I don't want to embarrass you or overstep boundaries but.... I'm getting sick. Would you mind putting your boots back on? <br>  <br>  It's been hot. Feet get sweaty and stinky.<br>  <br>  Hey - do you smell that?|`|8OREBeRdaa	I think I would go to the bathroom and ask the flight attendant if they could switch me seats and explain the situation.  If that didn't work, I would ask the person like this<br>  "Excuse me miss, I'm really, really sorry - but would you mind putting your boots back on? I'm very hyper-sensitive to the slightest of aromas and I'm feeling very nauseous right now" .  You could even start reaching for the air sickness bag.  <br>  <br>  I realize this is a lie of sorts but such a situation could be really sensitive for the woman and I think, as gentlemen, we need to take a little extra effort to try and be a little more accommodating for people's feelings. She may not even be aware. As gentlemen, I think we need to be resilient, but I also don't think we need to put up with a lot of stuff either.|`|xpD1PTbCaa	get up as if to go to the bathroom or whatever and tell a steward/ess and they'll handle it. then the woman won't overhear u saying it and she'll never know for sure it was you that said it, it could be anyone within a three seat radius.|`|H39nT287aa	IMO, you have every right to tell her to put her sweaty bettys away. You could ask the air hostess, but I doubt they would do anything. People who have paid good money to go on a plane should not have to put up with bad odours. If a dude sitting next to you on a flight, whipped his thing out and started masturbating, would you just sit there and accept it? No! So next time make a fuss.

I work in retail (and massage therapy) and Im amazed at how stupid and lazy the majority of customers I see are. They ask how much something costs with the price tag on a 3 foot sign in front of them....they want you to explain every little detail of how everything in the store works, they want you to put batteries in things for them because theyre too lazy to look at which way they need to go in and theyre too lazy to read directions on anything. They also think that if they shop somewhere expensive that it means the products are higher quality. I work in a high end retail store where everything is made in china and sold about 10 times higher than it should be. The same stuff can be found at walmart or target for a quarter of the price, and probably better quality. People are dumb. They also dont listen.....in the retail world customers will ask if theres a discount or the price of an item several times thinking that eventually youll slip up and tell them something different or if they ask enough times youll eventually cave and give them a discount. <br>  Oy. Stupid shoppers. But yes...outside the retail world people are stupid....they dont know how to think for themselves. They just go with the crowd, with the media influence...with whats popular instead of using their brain to learn and find their own answers.|`|aY6EjDwjaa	all people are stuid in some aspect.<br>  take me for example, i lie compulsively to my friends to stop them finding out about things each other do.<br>  (bitching basically)<br>  i know soon enough it will all come bac to me, but for now its all gravy.<br>  anyway people are stupid for selfish reasons. there is no such thing as a selfless act, you always get something out of it (pride, a sense that you've helped someone e.t.c )<br>  everything anybody does, they do for themselves.|`|sxX3Lh6caa	Wizards First Rule!<br>  <br>  People are stupid!<br>  <br>  Given proper motivation, almost anyone will believe almost anything. <br>  <br>  Because people are stupid, they will believe a lie because they want to believe it's true, or because they are afraid it might be true. <br>  <br>  People’s heads are full of knowledge, facts, and beliefs, and most of it is false, yet they think it all true. <br>  <br>  They can only rarely tell the difference between a lie and the truth, and yet they are confident they can, and so, are all the easier to fool!|`|jVUEohsNaa	I guess we are all stupid, it is just that some of us are also self-aware.|`|84oMDZiLaa	"Smart" is not an attractive quality.
FJPKtZN5aa	its important because with out it societies would fall apart.  granted that some laws are not necessary but some are tho
Rb84jDiEaa	yea lol i see what ur saying, and i applaud u for being one of those who say ppl are sometimes prejudiced against muslims :)  and ur so true, just imagine what will happen if that article did actually say "jews" then i think that there would be a riot.  <br>  <br>  To be honest its just really sad how people think nowadays.  just cos of the 9/11 and 7/7 ppl are against muslims.  <br>  <br>  There is this really nice example, when u see someone on the telly say they're pakistani, or sudanese and theyve just done something wrong and then ppl go "omg what have those paki's or sudans done now" but why are they hating on the nation?  The nation haven't done anything wrong :-\ its the PERSON. Why do u think God judges us as individuals?|`|7608d8bbef666e373ac9050db58b0ce9aa	It is glad that there are large number of people belonging to other communities who feel that there is prejudice against Muslims in USA. Even though USA is a democratic country, there is prejudice against Muslim women wearing hijab (veil) in schools.  Prejudice is not only against Muslims, there is racial prejudice against the people from Asia and African countries.  But, by and large people of USA do not have prejudice against Muslims and other racial minorities.<br>  <br>  The words of Angel "I've also seen some state they hate Muslims, but mostly the non-Muslims state that they hate Islam, not Muslims" shows the general attitude of a section of people of USA.|`|d1i3ac5baa	i find it hard to believe that anyone hates muslims. i do not find it hard to believe that people hate islam. muslims are the victims of islam more so than anyone. muslims just imagine that that a holy book read like this; quran 9:5 slay the muslims wherever you find them  9:28 believers! know the muslims are unclean  9:73 make war on the muslims be harsh with them  9:123 murder the muslims  8:12 terrorize and behead those who believe in allah  2:191 slay the muslims wherever you find them. now! these are just a few of the hundreds like them. do you like the sound of these? do you believe non-muslims should hold a book that calls for their death in high re-guard?|`|45b7d0c80d5b3ba262ca6be3b06edc05aa	Prejudice of any type isn't OK.<br>  <br>  Whether it is against muslims, male, white, jews, gay, old, black, christians, young, left wingers, asian, female, right wingers (cept for Rush Limbaugh, that's allowed).|`|RLQpyK3Jaa	The 1930's is good example because you will find more Black men leaving the churches and embracing Islam. In Islam, men and women find a peace that can't be stripped away from them, insha'Allah.  The same negative and ugly things that is said about Muslims now was said about Blacks then, to wit, even now. Case in point- the New York Post (a newspaper in NYC) is still calling Blacks monkeys AND condoning White police officers shooting Blacks (I'm referring to cartoon about chimp w/ stimiulus reference in cartoon) <a href="http://www.latimes.com/news/nationworld/nation/la-na-ny-post-cartoon19-2009feb19,0,2898604.story." rel="nofollow">http://www.latimes.com/news/nationworld/...</a>  The rhetoric is designed to scare Black people away from Islam and keep them pacified with alcohol, drugs and prostitution. <br>  <br>    The bottom line is this- Adversaries can not do anything to a Muslim unless it's allowed by Allah subhana wata'aala|`|AaBPvQ4Eaa	i think your friend told to that so your article would be more acceptable to the many americans who prefer the jews than to the muslims. <br>  it's not because it is ok to hate muslims, it's only for publicity. However, on the other hand, there could be negative acceptance from the muslim side.|`|v5kPzd0Jaa	Its because of all those dumb people that are killing each other CLAIMING that islam (my religion) tells them to. since the media sees all this they take advantage of it and spread bad news. for example, if a muslim man kills someone, its a "muslim" murder, but when some crazy dude chucks his kid off the west gate bridge, he is just a "man" who chucked her off. our reputation is ruined on this|`|Qyue0Ykgaa	Pride is Prohibited in Islam, everyone is equal, be he black or white, pink or yellow, specially Man and Wife, for they were created equally of the same material, however, a man has a degree of advantage over his wife, to protect her, and care for her.|`|GcI2SPmPaa	Yo, I'm feeling this guy's ( ??? ???? ??? ?????? ) answer-|`|Ep6Nf5BHaa	Oh get over it, you're such a sook.

Islam is a religion.<br>  <br>  Being a Jew frequently is about ethnicity...not just religion.<br>  <br>  There is no such thing as the "Muslim race."<br>  <br>  Therefore, hating Muslims (which is wrong, by the way) is not racism...it is being prejudiced.  There is a difference.<br>  <br>  Islam is an ideology---a system of beliefs.  Just like Nazism, Fascism, Communism, etc.|`|iMplzgBtaa	It isn't okay to hate Muslims, but it is okay to hate the religion they believe in if one thinks it is a false religion.  Muslims can't really help what they believe because they've been taught it for generations.  The same goes for Christians, Jews and any other religion.  I've seen many here who have stated how  much they hate Jews and Christians, but they are in the minority.  I've also seen some state they hate Muslims, but mostly the non-Muslims state that they hate Islam, not Muslims.  In my opinion it is stupid to hate anyone.  Regardless of our race, religion, nationality, etc. we are all God's children and should treat each other as we would like to be treated.  Maybe then there wouldn't be so much hate in this section and in this world.

AA10657034	Uhuh...|`|NMaCcyeKaa	They seem kind of vague.  Almost any age could argue the end times are coming.|`|373KJjiOaa	Utter nonsense. Like all end of the world predictions that are derived from any religion, they can apply to any time period if you really want them to.<br>  <br>  I am a Christian, but this would be my answer if a Christian were to post a similar question about end-times as derived from "Christian" sources. The truth is that we cannot know when the end of the world will occur, so all such claims are utter nonsense.<br>  <br>  edit:<br>  <br>  To address your addition,<br>  <br>  - the kids being filled with rage,<br>  <br>  This has always been the case and parents have always been complaining about it. Take a look at the 70s and 80s for a period where the "rage" was greater than it is today (at least in the West)<br>  <br>  - people walking in public with their thighs exposed,<br>  <br>  From the beginning of time, people have been going nude. Most African cultures are this way, and scant clothing was always the norm (with the exception of the ultra religious periods that Europe went through and that the Islamic world still appears to be stuck in)<br>  <br>  - smog appearing on top of cities,<br>  <br>  Ever hear of how London was during the beginning of the industrial revolution?<br>  <br>  - people dancing late into nights,<br>  <br>  LOL. What can I say, there is nothing new about that.<br>  <br>  -singers and music becoming popular,<br>  <br>  Music has always been popular. There hasn't been a single period in human history when some form of music wasn't popular. In the past it may have been Haydn, Telemann or Mozart, today it is Britteny or some other generic pop singer, but this basic fact hasn't changed.<br>  <br>  Sorry to disappoint you, but that is the truth.|`|nkFHk9dNaa	As a Christian ; as much as I respect Islam. These predictions are not very specific.|`|ue1WpA39aa	Humans have been living that way since they evolved. no one needs a damn silly book like the koran to tell us that<br>  <br>  lol|`|LVMpbm6aaa	Interestingly,today there is a movement that calls itself Salafi. They try to live as the first noble companions did and take only from Quran and sunnah or prescribe to any particualr madhab,however these muslims are cursed by many others for being to strict.Cursed for acting like the companions.<br>  <br>  However I don't think were quite there yet.One thing Ive noticed is that time moves very quickly in the Quran.Its quite likely that the period between the death of the prophet and the actual end day could be considered the end of days.It seems like a long space of time to us but not to Allah.Things are probably going to get much much worse.

Do not tip the valet who takes your car - only the person who brings it back (in good condition) for you.  Housekeeping I always leave something every day - it seems to make them clean a bit more because they know they are being tipped and aren't waiting until the end of the stay for the tip (or no tip) - give them about $3/day.

I'd tip the person who delivers your car, also $1.00.  I used to tip housekeeping on the last day, but I've read that isn't fair because  you can't assume the same person cleans your room every day, and so one person would get the entire tip, and maybe they didn't clear your room each day, so someone else got stiffed.    So now I leave a dollar or so daily, so the person who cleans that day get the tip.|`|qE64aNFhaa	I have many friends in the restaurant business and this is sort of a sore subject for me. I believe for someone to deserve a tip they have to do an exceptional job. They don't have to wait on me hand and foot, but come on people, you would never tip anyone if it was not expected of you. I think these establishments should pay their employees better wages and stop relying on the patrons to supply these peoples income. If you get stiffed, think about what you did that caused it and try to correct it. If you did a good job, and didn't get anything, maybe that person just doesn't have the income to do so. I say down with tipping all together. Who's with me?

I'd highly recommend doing an intensive mindfulness retreat, and seeing just how rich and deep one's experience can be doing that practice.<br>  <br>  Having said that, there are concentrative practices in the same tradition as Buddhist mindfulness that inculcate "altered" states that are quite amazing (called "jhanas"); they are taught occasionally in the U.S. You'll typically want to have done a few "regular" mindfulness retreats beforehand, in order to have experience in collecting the mind sufficiently to generate jhanas.<br>  .|`|LjsRfaskaa	The whole point of the breathing exercise is to help you switch off your internal dialog with yourself.

Transcendental means that this sound does not have anything to do with the material world. It is not a concoction by a human or gathered from the actions and interactions of any material elements. Transcendental sound is handed down via disciplic succession and originates from the spiritual realm. Of all transcendental sounds the most potent are those that directly relate to the Supreme Personality of Godhead. And especially for this fallen age of Kali, hearing and chanting the holy names of the Lord is recommended for rapid spiritual advancement and achievement of perfection in spiritual consciousness. <br>  <br>  I have been chanting the holy names -- hare krsna hare krsna krsna krsna hare hare, hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare for over 30 years. As this point I find that I am not at all attracted to material sense enjoyment and control of the mind is very easy. The Lord's holy names are empowered with all the spiritual potency of the Lord Himself so that anyone can easily clear away all the misconceptions of material life from his consciousness. Once free from all misconceptions and illusion, the soul can see his pure self and the Lord and revive his eternal relationship of pure love with Him. Once having achieved this that there is nothing more to be gained by any spiritual or material endeavor.|`|xDDutHCnaa	I've been trying to achieve different effects through Kundalini yoga for years, it's a certain type of meditation where if you practise it long enough, you can get high without drugs, just purely on your mind and mind set.

All goals targets and that sense of achievement will gradually fade to a point of non-importance. The profound sensations felt during meditation sessions will come and go. I remember when I first started a number of years ago. The sensations where euphoric, and felt like I was softly stepping into divine light, where a weightless lightness suffused my body. <br>  <br>  However, it is all to very easy to fall into believing that we are doing something wrong, when we do not experience those euphoric sensations in proceeding sessions, and sometimes we find our selves trying harder to focus and end up coming away frustrated.  There are many valuable techniques, I do a breathing mediation, and simply pause, acknowledge each thought, with an almost silent word, "Thinking", as they arrive, and then let the thought go and return back to my out breath. You also gain a sense of oneness with the breath, and can totally lose yourself in it, which is very blissful. <br>  <br>  What is important is to find one that your comfortable with and stick with it, all meditation will cause you to become more aware and in tune with life. It has certainly helped my ability to express my thoughts and feeling through my writing. But you must stick with ONE. <br>  <br>  Bless you! And may you find perfect oneness.

423b37222c9aecc6d4e09218cb231a06aa	The Holy Quran (68:4) says:<br>  <br>  "Certainly, you have highest morals". <br>  <br>  A continuous and abundant flow of Allah's grace and mercy always surrounded the Holy Prophet from all sides in every moment of his life. It was a reward not like an earthly reward that is used up or depleted, but one that was interwoven as part and parcel of the very core of his being which enabled him to do that which was right and proper in any circumstances. <br>  <br>  He stands on a most exalted standard of character and his life is an incomparable living illustration and explanation of the Quran. It is more appropriate if said that the Quran is a mirror of his most honoured being. His life pattern is now the standard for his followers. <br>  <br>  The life account of the "mercy unto the worlds" cannot be reported in few pages. In the light of the recorded events of his life, even the worst enemies of Islam, accept the fact that no man better than him ever lived on the earth. <br>  <br>  Refer to the commentary of Baqarah: 190 to 193 to the answer to the criticism; based upon prejudice and conjecture, by the enemies of Islam. The sublime moral and spiritual excellences of the Holy Prophet manifested in every aspect of his private as well as public life. He lived among the people without making known his ministry for forty years in order to first establish his truthfulness, reliability, kindness, highmindedness, tolerance and wisdom, so that when the announcement of his prophethood would be made, they should have no hesitation in accepting the invitation given by him to worship one God, but those who called him al amin and al sadiq vehemently opposed his mission. Al amin bears a comprehensive range of meanings. Al in the Arabic language denotes exclusive distinction and refers to the person who alone owns the quality mentioned after it. Amin refers to a person who can be trusted beyond any suspicion in whatever he does or undertakes to do. So it was a divine plan to bind the people with their own judgement. The Quran is the only scripture which asserts that its teacher is the perfect model or ideal for the whole mankind, therefore the people must believe in the message he has conveyed to them. See commentary of Ahzab: 21 and 22. Since he was the last prophet, perfection in every aspect of life, material as well as spiritual, was illustrated in him. Refer to the commentary of Ali Imran : 81, Baqarah: 253 and 285, and Bani Israil: 1, to know about the superiority of the Holy Prophet over all other prophets of Allah. See commentary of Baqarah: 2 and Ya Sin: 12 to know that the Holy Prophet and his Ahl ul Bayt are the reflection of the Quran or the Quran is the reflection of their lives. Refer to the hadith al thaqalayn on page 6. Also refer to the commentary of Baqarah: 143; Nisa: 41; Ahzab: 45 and 46 to know that the Holy Prophet is a witness over all other witnesses.|`|gDr6c4hraa	Praise be to Allaah.   <br>  <br>  The Prophets are the best of mankind, and the most noble of creation before Allaah. Allaah chose them to convey the call of Laa ilaaha ill-Allaah to mankind, and Allaah has made them the intermediaries between Him and His creation in conveying His Laws. They were commanded to convey the message from Allaah, as He says (interpretation of the meaning): <br>  <br>  “They are those whom We gave the Book, Al?Hukm (understanding of the religious laws), and Prophethood. But if these disbelieve therein (the Book, Al?Hukm and Prophethood), then, indeed We have entrusted it to a people (such as the Companions of Prophet Muhammad) who are not disbelievers therein”<br>  [al-An’aam 6:89] <br>  <br>  The Prophets’ task was to convey the message from Allaah even though they were human, hence the issue of infallibility may be examined from two angles: <br>  <br>  1 – Infallibility in conveying the message<br>  <br>  2 – Infallibility from human error <br>  <br>  Firstly: With regard to the first issue, the Prophets were infallible in conveying the message from Allaah. They did not conceal anything that Allaah had revealed to them, and they did not add anything from themselves. Allaah said to His Prophet Muhammad (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) (interpretation of the meaning): <br>  <br>  “O Messenger (Muhammad)! Proclaim (the Message) which has been sent down to you from your Lord. And if you do not, then you have not conveyed His Message. Allaah will protect you from mankind”<br>  [al-Maa'idah 5:67] <br>  <br>  “And if he (Muhammad) had forged a false saying concerning Us (Allaah),<br>  <br>  We surely would have seized him by his right hand (or with power and might),<br>  <br>   And then We certainly would have cut off his life artery (aorta),<br>  <br>  And none of you could have withheld Us from (punishing) him”<br>  <br>  [al-Haaqqah 69:44-47] <br>  <br>  And Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): <br>  <br>  “And he (Muhammad) withholds not a knowledge of the Unseen”<br>  <br>  [al-Takweer 81:24] <br>  <br>  Shaykh ‘Abd al-Rahmaan ibn Sa’di (may Allaah have mercy on him) said in his commentary on this verse: He is not stingy with that which Allaah has revealed to him, concealing some of it. Rather he (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) the most trustworthy of the inhabitants of heaven and the people of earth, the one who conveys the message of his Lord, the faithful conveyor (of the message). He does not withhold any part of it, from rich or poor, from ruler or subject, from male or female, from city-dweller or Bedouin. Hence Allaah sent him to an illiterate and ignorant nation, and he (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) did not die until they had become knowledgeable scholars, steeped in knowledge…<br>  <br>  End quote. <br>  <br>  So with regard to conveying the religion of his Lord, the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) did not make any mistakes at all, whether major or minor, rather he was infallible and under the constant protection of Allaah. <br>  <br>  Shaykh ‘Abd al-‘Azeez ibn Baaz (may Allaah have mercy on him) said in Fataawa Ibn Baaz, 6/371: <br>  <br>  All the Muslims are unanimously agreed that the Prophets (peace be upon them) – especially Muhammad (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) – are infallible and protected from error in that which they conveyed from Allaah. Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): <br>  <br>  “By the star when it goes down (or vanishes).<br>  <br>  Your companion (Muhammad) has neither gone astray nor has erred.<br>  <br>  Nor does he speak of (his own) desire.<br>  <br>  It is only a Revelation revealed.<br>  <br>  He has been taught (this Qur’aan) by one mighty in power [Jibreel (Gabriel)]”<br>  <br>  [al-Najm 53:1-5] <br>  <br>  Our Prophet Muhammad (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) is infallible in all that he conveyed from Allaah, in word and deed and in what he approved of. There is no dispute on this point among the scholars.<br>  <br>  End quote. <br>  <br>  The ummah is agreed that the Messengers are infallible in their conveying the message. They did not forget anything that Allaah revealed to them, except for things that were abrogated. And Allaah guaranteed His Messenger (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) that he would remember it and would not forget it, except for that which Allaah wanted him to forget, and He guaranteed to remember the whole Qur’aan in his heart. Allaah said (interpretation of the meaning): <br>  <br>  “We shall make you to recite (the Qur’aan), so you (O Muhammad) shall not forget (it)”<br>  <br>  [al-A’la 87:7] <br>  <br>  “It is for Us to collect it and to give you (O Muhammad) the ability to recite it (the Qur’aan).<br>  <br>  And when We have recited it to you [O Muhammad through Jibreel (Gabriel)], then follow its (the Qur’aan’s) recitation”<br>  <br>  [al-Qiyaamah 75:17-18] <br>  <br>  Shaykh al-Islam [Ibn Taymiyah] said in Majmoo’ al-Fataawa, 18/7]: <br>  <br>  The verses which point to the Prophethood of the Prophets indicate that they are infallible with regard to the message that they convey from Allaah, so what they convey from their Lord can only be true.

You should know that Khums is a religious duty, which Allah ordered:<br>  <br>  "And know that whatever you gain, a fifth of it is for Allah and for the Apostle and for the near of kin and the orphans and the needy and the wayfarer, if you believe in Allah and in that which We revealed to Our servant..." (Surah Anfal 8:41)<br>  <br>  The above ayat was revealed on a particular occasion. However, it’s command extends to all the times. And it is that Muslims must pay one-fifth of the profits (Ghaneemah). Secondly whatever they get without making efforts. For example, the spoils of war. The profits of business is known as ghaneema of business, etc. So how can we say that the ayat restricts khums only to the spoils of war?<br>  <br>  It is clearly mentioned in the traditions of the Prophet of Allah (a.s.) and his Household (a.s.) that a person asked the Messenger of Allah (s.a.w.s.) to explain to him the articles of faith and he (s.a.w.s.) replied,<br>  <br>  "Witnessing that there is no god except Allah and that Muhammad is the Messenger of Allah. Establishing the prayer, paying Zakat, fasting in the month of Ramadhan and paying one-fifth (khums) of profits." (Bukhari chapter of Khums)<br>  <br>  In the same way it is mentioned in the letters that the Holy Prophet (s.a.w.a.) sent to tribal chiefs to invite them to Islam. As mentioned in his letter to Yemen after they accepted Islam,<br>  <br>  "The Governor should take the Khums of Allah from the booty. He should also take the Sadaqat which are wajib on Momeneen."<br>  <br>  Sulaiman: If the paying of Khums is so clearly established in light of Arabic grammar why do the Sunni scholars not prescribe Khums other than on spoils of war, as an obligatory act?<br>  <br>  Ja’far: Of course! Some of the esteemed scholars from our Ahle Sunnat brothers do prescribe khums for the mined wealth, and gold and silver. It is possible these people depend on the traditions recorded on this topic. Shias also give verdict on the Khums being wajib from the excess of profits every year. According to them it is based on authentic traditions. From the interpretation of Quranic Ayats too, khums is wajib.<br>  <br>  Sulaiman: I would like to learn about the details of Khums.<br>  <br>  Ja’far: Khums means 20% of religious tax that a Muslim pays on profits as mentioned in the Islamic shariat. Or the wealth of mines and whatever extracted in raw, etc. Also the wealth of the sea like pearls and coral. The land that is sold to Kafir Zimmi from a Muslim and that property that is earned from Haraam but not obvious and those mined (metals). On all these after the expenses are deducted, Khums is payable on the balance amount. Total profits of the year minus the yearly expenses also qualify for khums.|`|Rb84jDiEaa	Surat Al-Anfal Verse 001:<br>  YUSUFALI: They ask thee concerning (things taken as) spoils of war. Say: "(such) spoils are at the disposal of Allah and the Messenger: So fear Allah, and keep straight the relations between yourselves: Obey Allah and His Messenger, if ye do believe."<br>  <br>  I thought that was only for war or a battle?

(Ibid: 203)<br>  <br>   Mullah Baqir also writes: After hearing some women talking about Ali (R.A.) Fatimah (R.A.) complained about her husband's features: "He is a man with a big stomach. His hands are high and his bones look suppressed. He has a receding hair line, big eyes and shows his teeth all the time. He has no wealth either. (Jilalul Uyoon: 58, in the chapter on Fatimah)<br>  <br>   The very same Mullah Baqir comments about a dream that Fatimah had and establishes that the devil came to her: 'The dream Fatimah had was from a devil whose name is Uhaad.

e1d737ecf0f11ed65f51b189ae2f0b03aa	Boy do I!  My mother-in-law was wonderful.  She died in 1993 and I still miss her.  I’m no longer married to her son, but to me she’s still mom.<br>  <br>  Altha was born in 1913 and raised in south Florida in the everglades.  Her mother was a prim English woman who married a fun loving alcoholic Irishman.  Her dad would love to fish but her mom would make him cook them outside.  Altha and her brother would take a boat on the river to school and often never made it to school because there was too much temptation.  Sometimes they would stop to harrass a crocodile.  (She said the only time it was really dangerous was if they had young) She described tying a rope in a tree above a mama croc and swinging over her kicking her in the head and avoiding her mouth.  Once she and her bro were climbing on a train trestle.  He stuck his head through the slats, turned his head and saw the train coming, then panicked and couldn’t get free.  She was above, ran over, stomped his head and dove into the water just in time.  If her mother had known.......<br>  <br>  There were sad stories too.  Her parents felt it was important to marry a daughter off before they “got in trouble and shamed the family” so married her at 15 to her dad’s 45 yr old drinking buddy.  She didn’t know anything about sex, On the wedding night she was raped.  She had a son, then a set of twin girls who died in her arms at 4 months old when mom was 18.  She had three more children by this man then left him in her mid 20’s.  She hated men so much at that point that she felt sorry for her sons because they would grow up to be men.  Altha began studying the Bible with Jehovah’s Witnesses and learned her marriage had not been what Jehovah had planned for man and woman.    She loved the truth.  She took seriously her commission to preach and included her four children in the full time work while also working ssecularly to support them.  This was right before and during WWII, a volatile time for JW's.  She had many stories about that time. <br>  <br>  Later she met and married Eric.  A big beautiful Swede who adored her.  They were such a cute couple.  Dad called mom his little buttercup (she was about 5’ 2” tall, he over 6’)  They seldom argued but she told me about a time she was so mad at him that she just HAD to hit him with a cast iron skillet.  She had to get on a chair and call him over to do it, though.  Foolish man, he came!  If she ever raised her voice even a bit, she'd say "now you done heard what I whispered."  It was part apology, and part emphasis of what she'd said.<br>  <br>  They had three sons.  The oldest Eric Jr. went on to be a missionary in Hong Kong, and I married the youngest, Jim.   When Jim, our three kids and I moved to northern California the folks came with us.  Dad had retired from driving cab in Las Vegas and they couldn’t bear to be apart from the kids.  Mom would make bacon for my son, Jason who was about 4, so he had the strength to beat grandpa at checkers.  In their later years they had a home where they had separate bedrooms (dad snored like a hurricane)  Eric Jr. was concerned and talked to mom about wifely duties etc.. She laughed and told him "thanks for your concern, honey, but don't you nevermind"  then she came to me and told me that dad still came to visit her room sometimes.  I said "mom, that's none of my business!"  She said I just wanted you to know we're normal, and sometimes the old rooster still crows.  :)<br>  <br>   We loved having a dozen years with them living nearby before they died.  We can’t wait until the resurrection to share happy times with them again.  Mom always looked forward to having a chance to raise her little twins.  Jehovah is so good to us.|`|6bd448d1483e653d688bb93e5adfeea3aa	yes|`|QVrEEmFHaa	Oh man, that's really funny haha, but then again most stories involving enemas are.. haha!<br>  <br>  I don't have a mother in law, but my ex boyfriend's mom... One time me and my boyfriend were at the store buying some condoms, and I went to get them while he went to look at something else. So I have them in my hand and I go to find him, and I walk around the corner and see his mom right there. I didn't think she saw me, so I turned back around and set the condoms down and then went back, and we talked to her for a few minutes. Then she says, ' Ash I think you dropped your Trojans back there, maybe you should get them before somebody takes them.' Oh my god, I was so embarrassed. I was just kinda like, oohh, yeahhh, thanks... and went and picked them up and stood there awkwardly holding them until she walked away... They were mint ones too :-X We passed his mom and dad in the car on the way home too and his dad was laughing, so I'm sure she told him... I didn't go over to his house for a while, haha.|`|JZxZ8mKRaa	My mother-in-law, who died in 1990, had a little bit of an unusual habit.<br>  <br>  She could not drive and talk at the same time. By that I mean that when she was driving, and she began to talk, she would get slower and slower and slower, till it became noticeable to her and she would floor it and your body would hit the seat like 3 g's worth.<br>  <br>  This was ALL THE TIME. I don't care if it was a short trip, a long trip, who was in the car, etc.<br>  <br>  We live in Kentucky and my in-laws lived in Florida. Now, we lived in rural Kentucky, quite rural. BUT their part of Florida was in the center, the sand dune wilderness. And the houses are more like summer camp cottages, little boxes. There are NO ROADS, NO MARKERS, just "paths" of sand that get overblown and you can't see them unless you know where they are.<br>  <br>  On this trip to Kentucky, my mom-in-law wanted to "go to town". That was about 5 miles away to the edge of town. I volunteered to drive. No, she would. I volunteered to drive her car. No, she would.<br>  <br>  All I could think of was to keep conversation to a MINIMUM, no matter what. Just yes and no answers, if that.<br>  <br>  We started out OK. We actually made a half a mile with no words. Then here it starts and here the car starts slowing down, down, down.<br>  <br>  No body behond us. Wham! Off we go again. Another quarter mile, wanted to know directions to store. Said keep driving. I'll tell her when we get closer. Looked in side mirror. Here comes a tractor. Good, it goes slow all the time. Won't be a problem. So I thought.<br>  <br>  Mom-in-law insistent that I begin to give directions. As I do, we get slower, slower, slower. Soon I could tell we were going slower than the tractor wanted. Next thing I see is the tractor passing us, mom-in-law oblivious till he gets up to the left front fender.<br>  <br>  As he pulls around the front of us, she get all flustered and said the tractor driver must be crazy to pass a car, and that he was going to make us late getting to the store. So here we LEAP out to the left and pass him with the foot to the floor. <br>  <br>  In front again, she starts complaining about the driver and slowing down. Till we were at the tractor speed again. I could see the driver throwing up his hands in exasperation, probably thinking that this was all meant for him.<br>  <br>  But no, this was my mom-in-law's dreaded driving. My dad-in-law would tolerate her helping drive about 30 or 35 miles on the trips, just long enough that she thought she really helped out. And then he would quickly take over again for the rest of the driving.<br>  <br>  I'm sure I will see my mom-in-law in the resurrection, just from a distance. And I hope if there are cars, that her driving improves, or that life will be at such a leisurely pace that it won't make a difference for her or anyone else!|`|siHW10dCaa	Allot of kids experimented this way back in those days.

And how lucky you were to have a mother-in-law whom you loved and who loved you right back!<br>  <br>  Dinners at her house must have been full of mirth and merriment--especially when she served duck...I can just see it now...her saying, "Did I ever tell you about the time..."<br>  <br>  Thank you for sharing a delightful story and brightening my day!<br>  <br>  BTW, my mother-in-law is a sour-puss...and even though she hated my husband's first wife, who left my husband after their baby was four-months-old, telling him she only married him to "have a blond-haired, blue-eyed baby and a support check each month"...my M-I-L told me at our wedding that she was grateful he had chosen, in me, a "sensible woman"...but the way she choked on the words made "sensible" sound like "trollop"....I think they were afraid we would sue for custody of the little boy, and we lived across the country from them, the ex & the child....so the fact that he was settling down was scary....<br>  <br>  Now, perhaps I should have given HER an enema that day--that would have set the tone for our relationship, don't you think?

They lived in a small central Pa. town. One day she was out with one or two of her sisters hanging clothes when a yellow convertible  squealed around the corner and kept moving at a rapid pace.

c9a1b864f1a97925067a5a7737860ac4aa	To say that we must be baptized in order to be saved is to say that we must add our own good works and obedience to Christ's death in order to make it sufficient for salvation.<br>  Baptism cannot be a requirement for salvation. To make it such is an attack on the sufficiency of the death and resurrection of Jesus Christ.<br>  Ephesians 2:8–9 (NIV)<br>  8 For it is by grace you have been saved, through faith—and this not from yourselves, it is the gift of God— 9 not by works, so that no one can boast. <br>  <br>  If baptism is necessary for salvation, why would Paul have said, "I am thankful that I did not baptize any of you except Crispus and Gaius" (1 Corinthians 1:14)? Why would he have said, "For Christ did not send me to baptize, but to preach the gospel - not with words of human wisdom, lest the cross of Christ be emptied of its power" (1 Corinthians 1:17)?|`|2BBKHggeaa	The non-Jews or Gentile nations were not in a dedicated relationship with God as the nation of Israel had been up till 36?C.E. They were in no national covenant with the Creator of heaven and earth. Thus when the way to God’s favor was opened up to them in 36?C.E. they had first of all to conclude in their own minds that they wanted to dedicate themselves to God to do his will. They had to make request of God for a clean conscience. Therefore, they had to dedicate themselves to God, or set themselves unreservedly aside for the doing of God’s will, and then when they were immersed or baptized in water such baptism appropriately symbolized their becoming dead to their previous course in life and their becoming alive to God’s will for disciples of Jesus Christ. So they henceforth set their heart, mind, soul and strength to do God’s will in fulfillment of their dedication of themselves. Thus they are dedicated to God unconditionally, for him to do with them as he pleases according to his Word. Water baptism became an apt public declaration of such dedication. Water baptism, then, is a necessary step for a believer who wishes to enjoy the salvation of God through Jesus Christ. This salvation comes to believers of the Word of God and doers of the commandments of God.—1?Pet. 3:21.<br>  <br>  NOTE<br>  An important point to remember is that it is the knowledge of what God requires of you that brings accountability. “If one knows how to do what is right and yet does not do it, it is a sin for him,” says James 4:17. Ezekiel 33:7-9 shows that a person who is told God’s commandments and instructions is responsible to carry them out. So the question is whether one has a sincere love for God and a real desire to please him. A person who truly has such love and wants a special relationship with Jehovah God would not hold back from freely dedicating his life to him. Baptism is but an outward symbol of that dedication. It is a necessary step toward salvation. Genuine believers get baptized.—Acts 8:12.|`|Bi1W5U35aa	You can't rationalize a prophet away When the prophets left, everyone was left to go his own way. Book of mormon Prophets were told that baptism was necessary. It was a commitment to the Lord that you would walk a new path. When the Lord restored His church with Apostles and Prophets, He told Joseph Smith that baptism was a requirement to show the Lord we would change our ways.(mormon.org)|`|VHwM54iUaa	I'm still a little confused about this subject.  Thank you for making it clearer for me.  I would say that baptism is not necessary for salvation.  <br>  <br>  Okay, do I have this right?  Baptism is meant to be a public act of repentance and declaration of our choice to follow Jesus.  John the Baptist said repent and be baptized, and Jesus was baptizing followers too.  I feel like I am missing something.  And how do we keep that balance to prevent it becoming an empty ritual?|`|cIZS6Wr2aa	Amen.   Baptism in not necessary to be saved.  It is a physical enactment of what happens spiritually at the time of conversion.  The thief on cross was to be with the Lord Jesus in heaven without having been baptized.  Enough said.  However ......... I would not scoff at the ritual of water baptism.  I myself felt the urge to be baptized and I was.  But we are talking extenuating circumstances here.  For the bible tells us if possible we should be baptized with water and the Holy Spirit.|`|3m00lxxuaa	Then my answer is #1. no|`|GtazNrplaa	That is only the start of it all as you will then have to devote the rest of your life working it out.|`|tManvxfQaa	For salvation....NO  !!<br>  <br>  Necessary....Yes !!

We were therefore buried with him through baptism into death in order that just as Christ was raised from the dead through the glory of the Father, we too may live a new life. If we have been united with him in his death. We will certainly be united with him in his resurrection. For we know that our old self was crucified with him so that the body of sin might be rendered powerless, that we should no longer be slaves to sin—because anyone who has died has been freed from sin. Now if we died with Christ, we believe that we will also live with him." --Romans 6:3-8<br>  <br>  Q: Where did Jesus die? <br>  A: Christ died on a cross.<br>  <br>  Baptism is when we become united with Christ and are crucified with Him. And those that resist the Scriptural teaching of baptism, resist the message of the cross:<br>  <br>  "For the message of the cross is foolishness to those who are perishing, but to us who are being saved, it is the power of God." –1Corinthians 1:18<br>  <br>  And it is impossible to separate the message of the cross from the biblical teaching of baptism. The two go hand in hand. The message of the cross is gut wrenching enough, let alone it now becoming when WE, ourselves must personally decide to be crucified with Christ and become unified with Him in His death—which was on the cross!<br>  <br>  The work of the cross is God’s offer of life…<br>  <br>  Baptism is our acceptance.|`|fAn14yGSaa	NO Baptism is NOT necessary for Salvation.

KwG1wOGQaa	The "brown things" you see stuck on the outside are actually seaweed (usually "nori"--like the seaweed used in maki and sushi dishes). Onigiri are rice balls flavored with a little vinegar and salt, and sometimes filled inside with bits of meat, pickled plums, more seaweed, sweetened fruits, etc. It's usually packed as a lunch box item since it's very handy. I don't know if there are traditional side dishes associated with onigiri, though.|`|505oVIRyaa	Onigiri often have fillings. The fillings are sometimes very small pieces of meat. So the "brown things" could have been chicken or steak. In Japan, I found that there is almost always meat in food, but it's often little tiny bits, like in onigiri. I'm not sure what else would be used as a side with onigiri though. It's a snack food so...

q2JmOFGLaa	I suppose it depends on the definition of strength.  Women are probably offended because they have to suffer the pain of childbirth and the pain of their time of month which no man has had to experience.  That tolerance is a kind of strength.  Strength against the historical oppression of men over women has also made us more sensitive.  I don't think that statement is sexist, but it does make me annoyed.  I dislike generalizations that compare men and women because it implies one must be better or worse than the other.  I think both genders are amazing in their own ways.<br>  <br>    "Like the standard of the grade "A" for P.E. in middle schools and high schools for female students are less than male students because of this"   I think there are more factors in these statistics than are taking into account.  For example, boys of that age place more importance on their physical prowess where as girl may be more likely to be focused on grades and emotional connections.  <br>  <br>  The statement itself isn't sexist as a hard fact but it's implications could be offensive.  like everything, it depends on how the sentence is presented, who says it, and how it is taken.  Historically oppressed  people are more likely to be sensitive to phrases like this.|`|Ftp0Q4SQaa	etiquette is the perfect category to put this because it really boils down to etiquette.

Many people have committed suicide over the way they're treated for being gay, to say they choose it is just stupid. How can something you don't choose be immoral?<br>  <br>  The bible does not "clearly" condemn homosexuality. First off, the whole line about men laying with other men was in the OT, which is completely disregarded now because it also has many many other laws that are broken every day. Secondly, the only bits in the NT where homosexuals are brought up, are very controversial, since the words translated into "homosexual" aren't truly understood and are different to the words that would normally be used in those times if referring to homosexuals.<br>  <br>  The bible was written 2000 years ago.

I disagree with you about belief in a deity, but that's not the issue at hand.  I don't feel insulted or attacked when you challenge it.  Ideas are open to criticism.  Where critique becomes hate (although that's usually far to strong a term) is when the criticism is ad hominem.  Saying Christianity is incoherent is not the same as saying that Christians bad people.  It is not debatable that a lot of criticism is cast in emotive language that crosses the line.

k03dYskYaa	I agree. It is an extreme assertion.<br>  <br>  Besides, regardless of how far spaceships might venture into space, humans could never expect to see God, either with their literal eyes or by means of man-made cameras. They speak as if God were a man, made of flesh and blood, but the Bible says, “God is a Spirit.”—John 4:24.<br>  <br>  Actually, things caused by forces unseen to the human eye are happening around us all the time. While you are thinking about what you are now reading, complex thought processes are going on in the more than 10,000,000,000 nerve cells of your brain. Advanced technology can measure brain waves, even represent them to the human eye by projections made on a screen or a strip of paper. But WHAT you are thinking cannot be made visible. Every word you speak, every conscious movement you make, is the result of a process invisible to the human eye. On the basis of this observation, what would be the logical consequences of sticking to the principle: “I believe only what I can see”?|`|C1SOqQSkaa	Do you feel the same scepticism about the assertion that Zeus, Ra, the Tooth Fairy or Santa do not exist?<br>  <br>  The evidence is very compelling in all cases.|`|AA11282654	Being that God is so magical and outside the realm of our understanding, not at all.

There have been thousands of gods all throughout human history that man has created to explain life, the universe and everything. Zeus at one time did it all. Ra at one time did it all. Odin at one time did it all. All had millions of people who had the utmost faith in them and knew it in their bones they were real. They're are all myths now.

It makes perfect sense however to assert that the Judeo-Christian god is mythical.  Clearly the xtian bible was plagarized by the hebrews from much earlier sumerian and egyptian myths.  (king sargon becomes the moses myth, gilgamesh becomes the noah myth, babylonian creation of man from clay becomes the genesis story).  Further the complete lack of any historical footing for most of the bible--allows us to say--if there is one--it sure aint the xtian god.|`|oBmLIDHtaa	I do not believe in any 'god(s)', so I am an Atheist.<br>  <br>  However, I do not claim to have the necessary knowledge to be able to state categorically that 'god does not exist'.

So many people say this on R&S too.  I also find it a bit extreme for any human to claim to know exactly what God wants of all of us.  But so many folks state such things as fact, as if they have all the knowledge of God.<br>  <br>  Based on what evidence?  A book?  The Bible, impressive in its own right being its popularity has survived as long as it has, is still just a book that contains many stories that cannot be proven to be fact.

Certain things can be proven not to exist using only logic, provided that the thing you're looking for is described as having two or more mutually exclusive traits.<br>  <br>  For example: I don't have to search every cubic inch of the Universe to say with certainty that there are no "square circles" or "married bachelors" residing in it -- it's impossible for any entity to have both of those traits simultaneously.<br>  <br>  In a like vein, there cannot be an "infinitely merciful and just God" who plans to torture people forever and ever -- thus neatly disproving the existence of the Judeo-Christian God.|`|z4Yeofq8aa	Yes but very few people fall into the trap of making that statement. Most atheists say they don't believe God exists due to the lack of evidence.<br>  <br>  Edit- You are using another logical fallacy if you imagine millions of people believing in something makes it a valid belief. Millions of people used to believe the earth was flat. In a philosophical debate it would be correct to compare belief in God to belief in any other supernatural phenomenon given the lack of evidence for God.|`|D66i4HMVaa	Yes, it is extreme. The claim that "God" existing being solely the responsibility of the person who believes in the existence thereof is equally extreme. Many who make these statements claim to base their lives and beliefs on "proof" and therefore equally share the burden to prove the nonexistence.<br>  <br>  There are many beliefs that have been proved and disproved over time along with the partial proof being found in both directions. Being as people and societies tend to lean toward the extremes, based on limited abilities to understand this argument will be around for a while longer. For those who need to be able to have physical proof, they are equally as narrow minded as those who blindly accept the teachings given to them without question.<br>  <br>  Science has not yet advanced to a point in which a clear cut answer can be given as to validate either side of the argument however there has been some new advances in Quantum mechanics and particle physics that theoretically both support and disprove aspects of interpretations of there being no "god" and the beliefs of major religions. The ideas that may be found in the old traditional shamanic view of multiple dimensions and realities does parallel the concepts and theories that are being studied. At this point it would be premature to claim any solid factual results and until more advancements can be made, we would be better to accept that all ideology is based on interpretation and not on solid evidence.<br>  <br>  <br>  Edit; @ Val, your statements are directed at follower of the Bible and not about the existance of "god" with respect to other viewpoints or understanding of what "god" is but at the same time you post "practicing shaman" along with "quantem physics rocks." If you look at quantem physics, some possibility of intelligence beyond that which is currently available through evolution is possible. Aside from this, being as a "shaman" is differientated from others being as they are believed to have the ability to shift their spiritual exixtance beyond the physical plane into the spiritual realm. This is as subject to persecution as fundamental belief in any other religion and practices. Or is it that you are one of the neo- shamans that would fall into the catagory of "Playgan" being as there is no deep commitment or ability. I do not intend to be insulting. I would like an answer as to if you are able to alter your conscious awareness beyond the normal reality and communicate with nonphysical beings or not. I ask for your personal viewpoint being as your statement in effect does claim not only your acceptance of somesting beyond this existance but also the ability to access it. I would not ridicule your claim if in fact you are a shaman, I would be honestly interested in your experiance. I have met with and spoken to others who were serious as well as others who made the claim for attention so I am open to the possibility of it being real.  Thanks in advance.|`|5LP8FyzAaa	And maybe he doesn't. And is why making absolute statements regarding this is ridiculous. God cannot be proved nor disproved, conclusively. Just as you cannot disprove that a magical pink unicorn isn't standidng next to me.|`|DDwecKakaa	I don't argue against any gods existence just the probability of said gods existence as it relates to me and mine. But, I want people to leave me alone while I talk to my invisible friend and stop calling me crazy. Just because you can see him does not mean he is not real. Oh and don't worry, even though he told me to kill for him, luckily for everyone we are not 'That" tight....yet. Of course he keeps saying that it would prove to him that I really believe in him and our talks are not just lip service.|`|bVHnNqzBaa	G-d is hiding in the attic of the home of Easter Bunny and Tooth Fairy. Shh, don't let the police hear him when they come searching.|`|S4XUl7qWaa	It is not extreme to say, "There is no verifiable evidence for your particular deity, or any others for that matter."|`|P1Sl55Coaa	Yup, there are a lot of them here.  God calls them fools.  I just think they are a bit misguided, and very angry at God.|`|PM9MQHjRaa	GOD(YHVH) does exist.|`|XOZiYqgUaa	Seriously man...if you think that's extreme. You need to get out more. God doesn't exist.|`|rO4acyb4aa	Yes, it is. Humans now days are trying very hard to disprove the existence of God...their own creator! Look where it's gotten them to. The world is becoming more corrupt by the second. God is there. If you look for Him, you can find Him. Just because we can't see God with our physical eyes doesn't mean He doesn't exist. We can see Him with our souls, our hearts. Atheists are just too blunt to believe in anything they cannot see with their physical human eyes, they don't understand that humans can see with their hearts as well. Besides, there's a lot of evidence that prove Gods existence...but the disbelievers just turn a blind eye to it.|`|wE7lLCHSaa	It may also be extreme to assert that the Easter Bunny doesn't exist, or that there doesn't exist an elephant in front of me.  I mean, I guess I can't know with 100% certainty, right?  But at least I can say that I have no evidence of their existence, so I might as well operate on the assumption they don't.  Otherwise, I'd have to throw wide open the doors of possibility and accept all kinds of crazy things exist.<br>  <br>  By the way, don't Christians happily assert that Vishnu, Thor, Odin, Aphrodite, etc, don't exist?  Isn't that a bit extreme?<br>  <br>  Oh, millions of people believe in him therefore he exists?  And you're making fun of other people's logic?  Wow.  Just wow.  A whole lot more people believe in Buddhism and Taoism, so I guess that makes them "truer" than your religion.  Great logic there.|`|LjsRfaskaa	And if there is a god why is there no proof, no evidence what so ever. What are you basing your faith on exactly. The mad ramblings of mistranslated book from the belief system of another belief system. <br>  <br>  You say there is an omnipotent invisible sky being that has nothing better to do than watch over our shoulders 24/7. That supposedly loves everyone unconditionally, but will burn you in eternal torment in the fires of hell for all eternity, for not fawning. <br>  <br>  Ok excuse me while I laugh my head off. Ridiculous unprovable statements of this nature deserve ridicule. One does not need knowledge of everything to spot gibberish. <br>  <br>  Practicing Shaman.. quantum physics rocks.

0fRsWy05aa	I think so since you're a Christian. I could be wrong but you don't need any association with evil. Just my opinion. @~|`|eO2rnf7yaa	Your avatar is something you intentionally display.  <br>  It has meaning.  <br>  It is a message that,  according to you,  contradicts who and what you really are.  That seems to me to be dishonest.<br>  <br>  I read an answer that says others should learn to be less judgmental.  I think people should take seriously the name and image you apply to yourself and present to others.  You picked an avatar that has an obvious meaning.   If the obvious meaning is misleading, and others are led astray by your willing misrepresentation,  that is not the fault of other people.  It is your fault.   <br>  <br>  If you were to demand that others not evaluate you by your avatar and user-name,  that would be to demand that people disregard what you say.   You picked the avatar and user-name.   If the image and name you have chosen to use are misleading,  then  you can fix the problem by choosing a better avatar (or no avatar)  and a username that is not misleading<br>  <br>  <br>  Peace be with you.|`|bgA9wLD0aa	the only christians i take seriously are the ones who show respect for other people.  i'd start there if i were you.|`|7d49ddbf3b36edeb5a77c20235621a44aa	It's doesn't hurt being a little more plastic, sticking to the pat answers widely accepted by christians, avoiding the devil's advocacy and all rational scientific knowledge unless it's pseudo science or given special explanation. put on your mental straight jacket you are a Christian. good luck with the self restraint.|`|AhJaRRlbaa	I had no idea you were a Christian!

a0ea30926acdfeb82a6d6f9ca13bcc69aa	No.  Mulatto isn't a bad word to use.  It's actually very accurate.  I've used all of the words you listed to describe myself except multiracial.  That one just sounds odd to me.<br>  <br>  I disagree that any of the words indicate that a person has little respect for themselves.  I have plenty of respect for myself and I'm not going to nitpick over terms.  I'm not a PC kinda person and find it amusing when people get offended because I'm "supposed" to get offended by words they don't care for.  I figure it's their problem--not mine.  I find it amusing that the people who seem to get the most upset about these terms are not mulattoes anyway.  I fail to see why it's any of their business.<br>  <br>  I grew up in a community of mulattoes and the phrases "half breed" and "mutt" were the common words we used to describe ourselves.  Half breed once meant a mix of native american and white but when I was growing up it included us too--plus many of us had native american ancestors too.<br>  <br>  I've found that very few of the mulattoes that I've known have been obsessed with race.  To us, skin color is about as important as hair or eye color.  I just don't understand why so many people are so interested in the subject..|`|JLayHNZCaa	Insults are what you make of them.  If it doesn't bother you, don't let anyone else tell you how to feel about it.  You may find, it really depends on who says the words and how they say them, than what they say?|`|4S6V4sb4aa	mulatto is the proper term for someone who has a mix of black and white.. nothing wrong with it,, It's just as wrong as calling you a female..|`|b1233d2957b6685f6644485ce17a6f62aa	It's based on a word for "mule", so I think it's derogatory.|`|gLXzVbm8aa	it used to be bad back in the days but not anymore|`|So1ROzM4aa	From your little list there I would say Mulatto one of the least offensive. Half Breed? Mutt? The fact you see nothing wrong with referring to yourself in such a way is the reason people say mixed people are messed up. If someone referred to my kids like that I'd tear their eyes out. Have a bit more respect for yourself.<br>  <br>  EDIT: You may not  mean it in a derogatory way but the fact is my kids have to grow up in this world and if a white person referred to them like that, as I said, I would be livid. So lets not give bigots a reason to use these words and take them out of the vernacular all together. The 'n' word can go with them too.|`|nYjVW8Fbaa	we are all of mixed blood, what bothers me though is that the nation cheers because we have our first black president, isn't he mulatto.  my black friends tell me that he is more white than black because he has a white mother.  if his features were white would the media be saying we have our first black president.|`|HPqCRBq8aa	People are too damn sensitive these days.

Btsctjydaa	Yeah, I always get weird looks when I go out in public with a strap-on on my head. I don't understand it either. Don't feel bad.|`|283tO9j9aa	Heh, I have purple hair and all the weird clothes and the way I react depends on the facial expressions and behaviour of whoever is looking at me. I don't have any extreme piercings or tattoos but unnatural hair (it used to be black and bright pink) and gothic/metalhead clothes do get some looks in rural England. If someone looks at me like I'm dog poo on their shoe I'll glare right back. But if you do look different, you have to accept that people will be interested. I'm quite happy for people to look, and I can't understand why anyone would get so angry- in fact, since I don't give off that "I hate everyone, don't stare at my green dreads" vibe, people have come up to me and told me how much they like my clothes ^_^ That makes me so happy, because although i wear things because I like them, it's nice to get compliments.<br>  <br>  From my experience of being part of the alternative scene, some people- especially women- want everyone to look at them and then make a fuss when it happens for the simple reason that making a fuss means more people turn round to look. I think that if your only reason for expressing yourself through clothing and body modification is so you can get as much attention as possible, that's a sad way to live your life.|`|1EHmi2Y1aa	What you and I might call a unique form of expression and welcome it, most other people look "down" upon anything at all that is just a little different from them. Please, people watchers just love to make fun of the fat people and stare at the skinny ones in lustful awe!. Smart skinny girls can read "I see you see me as a sex object only". What the hell, guess most would go for the dumb ones, right?<br>  <br>  If you really care maybe you should tell your blue haired friend you love that shade of color and give an honest smile!|`|Kl1h5dCaaa	Would you like to be ogled??<br>  <br>  I often get ogled in public, and it isn't a nice experience. I sometimes feel like I am wearing a sign saying *LOOK AT ME I AM A CIRCUS FREAK*.<br>  <br>  My style is unique, at times I do have rad hair styles, but I still don't feel comfortable about being ogled. Even I have bad days.<br>  <br>  Adam, I've been ogling you for weeks, but you don't seem to like it much ;)|`|mJbwemH8aa	They just dont like people taking stuff and pictures, they wish everyone else act normal and leave them alone.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  .|`|m2jeeo4Laa	I never understood that either.  I've been yelled at for sneaking a second peek at someone that stood out on purpose.  I really have no problem with what another does with their body...if they are making an artistic expression, why not enjoy others reactions, good or bad.  To answer the question, I think the lot of them are insecure to begin with, believing that they cannot fit in the "normal", and do these shocking things to stand out, but still insecure despite the "I'm cool" attitude.|`|8OREBeRdaa	I wonder the same thing.  For example, I was out for a meal with my buddy last night and our server had a bunch of facial piercings.  Both my buddy and I took notice.  She obviously felt a little apprehensive about the whole thing and asked "You guys ok?".  My friend (who is really outgoing) says "That's a lot of hardware on your face." She replies "Yeah".  My bud says "Well, it's just different, you don't see that very often."  <br>  <br>  Now, that may not have been the best answers but my friend and I both agreed that, our opinion, that she didn't need that much jewelry and she probably would've looked better without it all. BUT, we resolved to just shrug and say "Each to their own, live and let live, etc., etc."<br>  <br>  If you're going to stand out from society, whether it be tattoos, piercings, wild hairstyles, you're going to have to get used to people doing double takes and not get offended.  And you're going to have to get used to people treating you a bit different.  I know that I work in an office environment and we wouldn't hire someone if they had a lot of facial jewelry and wild hair during an interview.  We have a dress code for a reason. <br>  <br>  I guess what I'm trying to say is that if you insist on wearing all that sort of stuff, I guess one should expect to say a lot of "Would you like fries with that.?"<br>  <br>  For the record - I did date a woman who had purple streaks in her hair.  It looked good on her.|`|65e0c93e39fac0974cefe1be5c93b58daa	What is the point to body art if nobody is supposed to look at it?<br>  <br>  If you're going to be out in public, its pretty selfish to have an attitude of "you can look every direction except mine", if you don't want looked at, for whatever reason, you should cover up!  Just like anybody has the right to dress and look however they want, those of us with eyes have the right to use them in whatever direction we want in pubic.<br>  <br>  And yes, Charli, I do want to be ogled.
drxspOUwaa	I have seen Brokeback. It was a touching film. I will say, it seemed as if the two men were forcing themselves - the couplings were so violent.I don't know if that was because of the heterosexuality of the actors or because the film called for it due to the setting.<br>  I will also tell that the images were, for me, disturbing because they fall outside what I consider to be natural.  But the story was good, and it deserved the kudos it received.|`|AA10471679	Tell me why on earth I'd want to.<br>  <br>  Movies about gay characters interest me about as much as Michael Jackson, Icelandic insurance adjusters, American Idol, and the five men and two women Paris Hilton slept with in the past 24-hours.<br>  <br>  Is it because I have completely closed my mind off?

D66i4HMVaa	To believe in Satanism, one first needs to accept the Bible. Many of the self worshiping, self serving and socially deviant people who are categorized by others and occasionally themselves in reality have no connection to Satanism at all. An Atheist does not believe in God and therefore does not accept the one of the Bible and in turn cannot be a Satanist.<br>  <br>  There are the Satanists who accept and follow the Bible as basically being true aside from their belief that in the final battle between God and Satan, the one that is triumphant will be Satan. Generally they live a life that parallels the ideology of Christians. They do however hold themselves to a heightened degree of responsibility being as they do not foresee a forgiveness of their sins. To them sin is more a failure to be responsible for their actions. They also hold society responsible to take care of nature, the planet, animals and people with respect and dignity. This type of Satanism has existed in Europe for centuries.<br>  <br>  The common Satanist as known today is generally founded in the ideas of Anton LeVay with his founding of "The Church of Satan" in 1966 and as published in his 1969 book, "The Satanic Bible."|`|wTmNCQhcaa	The first definition isn't misused to make atheists look bad....it's atheists who call themselves Satanists in the first place. <br>  <br>  As for the second definition, this one is a bit more complex. Spiritual Satanists (the ones that worship a particular being which is almost never the christian Satan) never sacrifice virgins or chop up animals. They don't believe in god, jesus or the bible. Different ideas of Spiritual Satanism exist, but most would hold to the idea that mainstream religion is a lie and that the rightful gods have been vilified as demons. Either humanity forgot about it's true gods, or maybe the "real devil" is the entity called god by most religious people. Depends on the Satanist you're talking to. In a way, one could consider Spiritual Satanism in line with neo-paganism. Though Satanists would avoid the "fluffiness" generally associated (perhaps falsely) with most neo-pagans.<br>  <br>  In either sense, Satanism is about invoking the "darker" aspects of human nature. Not that it promotes criminal acts such as murder, theft and rape. But rather so-called "sinful" acts such as lust, pride, anger etc. Where as traditional religion says you should deny yourself your own nature and feel shame, Satanists say you should embrace your true nature and be proud about it.<br>  <br>  <br>  P.S. I would fall under the "Spiritual Satanist" category.|`|baQodlHWaa	Pretty much it's a way to cause more conflict.

So you can have contact with the opposite sex at work, university, school or in the market place but this does not mean that you can begin to go out to lunch with a work colleague(opposite sex) or begin talking about personal issues/life.<br>  <br>  You are right, Islam is a religion of ease and was introduced to liberate people, especially women. If the opposite sex has been given the impression that he can flirt with you, talk to you about his or her personal issues, then you should review the type of approach you are using with such people.<br>  <br>  The best advice is to grow your contact list with the same sex whilst maintaining an appropriate level of contact with work/student colleagues.

Verily, it is Fahishah (immoral sin) and an evil way."<br>  (Quran 17:32)<br>  <br>  Allah says, forbidding His servants to commit Zina or to approach it or to do anything that may lead to it: (And come not near to unlawful sex. Verily, it is a Fahishah (immoral sin)) meaning a major sin, (and an evil way.) meaning, a terrible way to behave. Imam Ahmad recorded Abu Umamah saying that a young man came to the Prophet and said, "O Messenger of Allah! Give me permission to commit Zina (unlawful sex).'' The people surrounded him and rebuked him, saying, "Stop! Stop!'' But the Prophet said, (Come close) The young man came to him, and he said, (Sit down) so he sat down. The Prophet said, (Would you like it (unlawful sex) for your mother) He said, "No, by Allah, may I be ransomed for you.'' The Prophet said, (Neither do the people like it for their mothers.) The Prophet said, (Would you like it for your daughter) He said, "No, by Allah, may I be ransomed for you.'' The Prophet said, (Neither do the people like it for their daughters. ) The Prophet said, (Would you like it for your sister) He said, "No, by Allah, may I be ransomed for you.'' The Prophet said, (Neither do the people like it for their sisters.) The Prophet said, (Would you like it for your paternal aunt) He said, "No, by Allah, O Allah's Messenger! may I be ransomed for you.'' The Prophet said, (Neither do the people like it for their paternal aunts.) The Prophet said, (Would you like it for your maternal aunt) He said, "No, by Allah, O Allah's Messenger! may I be ransomed for you.'' The Prophet said, (Neither do the people like it for their maternal aunts.) Then the Prophet put his hand on him and said, (O Allah, forgive his sin, purify his heart and guard his chastity.) After that the young man never paid attention to anything of that nature.|`|ORbFRn4oaa	Another MISTRANSLATED and ABUSED verse.<br>  <br>  The term translated as "Adultery" is "Fahisha". The Quran uses SPECIFIC words. The INFLUENCED translators translated two terms with the same word i.e. Zina and Fahisha with Adultery.<br>  <br>  In the Quranic terminology: <br>  <br>  1-  Zina is Adultery committed by married person.<br>  2-  Fahisha (not just in Quranic terminology) means immoral and bad behavior. <br>  <br>  Now adultery / fornication may be committed even by singles as well as married people. Also Adultery is just one of the immoral and bad behavior. In verses 4:15 and 16, we find that the same word has been used for Sodomy. And the same word has been used for the nation of Lot. Since we are dealing with Quranic verses, therefore with the perspective of Quranic terminology, this verse is NOT pointing to just adultery/fornication between opposite sex, but it is more apt to Sodomy or homosexuality. This does NOT mean that Sodomy is a gross sin and adultery is not. <br>  <br>  Segregation of sexes is NOT a solution to preventing adultery / fornication. Experience shows the results are more devastating and opposite to the expectations. Nor does the Quran state that a segregation is to be enforced:<br>  <br>  Ref. 33:33<br>  You shall settle down in your homes, and do not mingle with the people excessively, like you used to do in the old days of ignorance. You shall observe the Contact Prayers (Salat), and give the obligatory charity (Zakat), and obey GOD and His messenger. GOD wishes to remove all unholiness from you, O you who live around the Sacred Shrine, and to purify you completely.<br>  <br>  -----------<br>  The verse constitutes instructions to the wife of prophet Mohd. It is pertinent to note that the wives of prophet Mohammad had to comply more strictly. They were NOT an ordinary case. The following rules were exclusive for them:<br>  <br>  1-  They were NOT allowed to marry any other person after prophet Mohammad.<br>  <br>  2-  The punishment for their deviation was double the punishment of the same crime committed by an ordinary believing woman.<br>  <br>  -----<br>  In the verse above we see that :<br>  <br>  "and do not mingle with people EXCESSIVELY".<br>  <br>  Even in this instruction a complete prohibition is NOT inflicted. IT is restricted to necessity and moderation.<br>  <br>  Therefore gender segregation is an abuse of the verse and unjustified.|`|H8WqMK1eaa	Adultery happens when a marriage is not healthy.<br>  <br>  Segregation is not going to stop it from happening.

Gender-segregation prevents a lot of bad things between non-related men and women. Imagine you don't have to worry when your husband goes out that he isn't staring at half-naked women and probably fantasizing about them such as is the case in Western countries.<br>  But then there are the people who become really curious about the other sex in a gender-segregated country to the point where they are MORE lustful towards them because they are "taboo".

Following bukhary and co books,Does Not mean following Prophet ,Not at All.<br>  Quran is THE JUDGE over all the Books,Judging Quran through bukhary and co books is UTTER KUFR,<br>  majority Judge Quran and follow verses if hadith books permits it,other wise hadith is upheld over Glorious Quran.<br>  the example of dog is a shameful example of majority's belief,they still believe that dogs are Najis. <br>  <br>  [39:23] GOD has revealed herein the best Hadith; a book that is consistent, and points out both ways (to Heaven and Hell). The skins of those who reverence their Lord cringe therefrom, then their skins and their hearts soften up for GOD's message. Such is GOD's guidance; He bestows it upon whoever wills (to be guided). As for those sent astray by GOD, nothing can guide them. <br>  <br>  majority Religiously and shamelessly Believe that Quran is Incomplete,as it doesnt have Rakahs ! there is NO single hadith which tells you how to pray what to pray and how many Rakahs !!<br>  <br>  Questioning the truthfulness of Allah Allmighty and Quran is again an Utter Kufr.<br>   <br>  6:114 ????? ???? ????? ???? ??? ???? ???? ????? ????? ????? ?????? ??????? ????? ?????? ??? ???? ?? ??? ????? ??? ????? ?? ????????<br>  <br>  ????? ????? ,means Detailed Book ! if one doesnt believe in this then one is rejecting Allah's Words .<br>  <br>  they bring verse " Obey allah and Obey Rasool" to their defence <br>  now Obedience to Allah and Obedience to rasool are NOT two separate Obediences,these Obediences are ONE,<br>  <br>   So, what is the meaning of "Atee-‘ullah –wa- Atee-‘ur-Rasool" (obey Allah and obey the Prophet)? Since there are more than twenty verses in the Quran on this topic, its importance cannot be overemphasized. For example:<br>  <br>  "Yaa ayyuhal lazheena aamanu atee’ullaha wa attee’ur Rsoolahu wa laa tawallau ‘anho wa antum tasma’oon" [O you who believe! Obey Allah and His Messenger, and turn not away from him while you are hearing.] (8:20)<br>  <br>  In this verse the pronoun used for Allah and the Messenger is singular (‘anho). If the reference had been to two separate obediences then, according to Arabic grammar, the pronoun should have been ‘anhuma (for two). <br>  <br>  and yet another verse they bring,from Surah Hashr<br>  59:7 Whatever God provided to His messenger from the people of the townships, then it shall be to God and His messenger; for the relatives, the orphans, the poor, and the wayfarer. Thus, it will not remain monopolized by the rich among you. You may take what the messenger gives you, but do not take what he withholds you from taking. Be aware of God, for God is mighty in retribution.<br>  <br>  Read carefully the above Verse what is Prophet commanded to give ! hadith followers would quote only part of the above verse and that is " You may take what the messenger gives you"<br>  <br>  read few verses above 59:7 and below the message becomes very clear,what Prophet is distributing among the people <br>  <br>  we are left with only ONE option and that is Follow Quran Alone<br>  <br>  Yes verse 2:143 explains that we dont have to follow sunnah of Prophet and the way of salaf<br>  <br>  [2:143] We thus made you an impartial community, that you may serve as witnesses among the people, and the messenger serves as a witness among you. We changed the direction of your original Qiblah only to distinguish those among you who readily follow the messenger from those who would turn back on their heels. It was a difficult test, but not for those who are guided by GOD. GOD never puts your worship to waste. GOD is Compassionate towards the people, Most Merciful.|`|3E2EQH12aa	25 26 says alkafireena AAaseeran--- those who deny the truth|`|02I8uxdpaa	1) Blue eyed Muslimah is correct. It is those who deny the truth. It does not matter whether it is disbeliever, misbeliever, unbeliever, they all mean the same thing.<br>  <br>  2) Somewhat, you don't necessarily become a disbeliever, but it is wrong to deny God's word in exchange for something else.<br>  <br>  3) Everything the Hadith forbids is in someway related to the Qur'an. The hadiths just elaborate on what the Qur'an forbids. For example, eating with the left hand is not haram cuz there is nothing similar to it int the Qur'an. Qur'an has already forbidden many things: Adultery, shirk, murder, etc.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  Love for all, Hatred for none|`|m3YC7Jcyaa	Salam<br>  <br>  Bismillahi Al Rahman Al Raheem<br>  Ouzibillahi Mina shytan Al Rajeem<br>  <br>  You have to go back to ayat 21 to 26 to see the revelation correctly<br>  <br>  Start here<br>  25:21<br>  And they who believe not in a meeting with Us say : 'Why have not angels been sent down to us?' or 'why do we not get to see our Lord?' Verily they think highly of themselves and are hence utterly disdainful of others! <br>  <br>  According to the Quran, we come face to face Angels only twice : once at the time of death when they come to gather our souls and then on the Day of Resurrection when they greet the righteous and remonstrate the sinful, both unsavoury occasions for the disbelievers which is why they wish for an invisible barrier to be erected between them.<br>  <br>  After 26 to this context<br>  On that Day the true Sovereignty would belong wholly to the Beneficent! But for the disbelievers, it would be an opprobrious Day! <br>  * * *<br>  Context of Revelation : The following verses were revealed when a prominent member of the local community become a Muslim at the behest of the Prophet, but renounced his new faith on the advice of his friend who refused to embrace Islam and had carried on opposing the Prophet. <br>  <br>  InshAllah Amin<br>  Khair inshAllah<br>  Ma Salama

Apparently you have not studied the history or socio-anthropological construct of religion. Yet you have a cute little opinion about it anyway.

And it isn't "politics" either although wars are started in the name of religion. It is a system of morality and behavior; wars come about in the name of religion because one group of people want other groups of people to believe in their religion and when they don't, they start fighting.<br>  <br>  To read that you think that "religion is a hobby that got out of hand" is insulting and shows your foolishness and lack of respect.|`|a3ffZgRsaa	Because people who memorize a book and constantly recite verses and act parts out are usually called nerds,<br>  like when a group goes out and acts out lord of the rings<br>  <br>  Religious people are just more...<br>  Pig-headed|`|bZA3TntMaa	i guess just because people ran out of things to argue about, so they brought religion into it.|`|1Y1PBMXlaa	Ain't dis abitch?
ox6ESqzjaa	Yes it does. The first person I ever kissed was, ironically, a girl. It never actually felt "Right" when I kissed women (I've kissed a total of three girls).<br>  <br>  However, when I first kissed my boyfriend (We weren't boyfriends at that point, though), it was the most magical feeling! I can't really explain it with words, but it felt so RIGHT!<br>  <br>  I liked him so much, when I kissed him it was incredible, passionate, and simply amazing. I feel the same way even to this day.<br>  <br>  I hope I explained it well enough so you can understand what I mean. Hopefully when you kiss the person you really like it'll be the same for you!|`|nXBPXVnkaa	You always remember your first kiss, but that doesn't mean the following kisses are any less special.

My first real kiss was probably nothing special... but it was amazing to me and made me feel wonderful (and she felt the same).<br>  <br>  The next time I had my first kiss with someone new, it was almost better than the first, because I knew a little more about what I liked and what to do with myself.|`|kjWqxBPXaa	yes its really special xx|`|n8rrhg7Taa	there are always those people that give you the spark and then those that are just awkward or pushed.

In all likeliness even if you have kissed hundreds of people before if you find that special person then you can have a great kiss with that special spark.|`|uiWEZJN6aa	Yes.<br>  My first kiss didn't feel very special at all. It was awkward and uncomfortable and just not great lol.<br>  <br>  But my 1st kiss with my current girlfriend was really special even in the 1st kiss I knew I wanted to be with her forever. <br>  And even now nearly 2 years on every kiss feels as special as the 1st..<br>  <br>  =)|`|UOLtJocMaa	It depends on the person.

It is just how you feel about the moment and person that makes it that way.
FJYuMpfoaa	Islam will regain it's glory and Muslims will be victorious when they stop imitating the western way of life and stop loving this materialistic world and return to their religion. Inshallah Islam will be victorious and there is no doubt about that, but that too will happen when Allah decrees. Al-mahdi and Jesus will come and spread peace and give victory to Islam.

But most of what you listed is overwhelmed by the opposite. Real indicators that justice is coming and something is improving in our ways of doing things will be practical. Markets will open up and value will circulate in the economy again. Rich and poor won't be permanent labels. As it is, value only goes one way. Things like that...there's no need for interpretation of cloud formations, etc.<br>  <br>  1. Which version of Islam is the fastest growing? Are the converts committed people of sound understanding? Anyone can say Yes in a poll.<br>  <br>  2. See answer # 1.<br>  <br>  3. Afghanistan does what it's told, or else. Invasion, Taliban and opium production aren't helping.<br>  <br>  4. See answer #3.<br>  <br>  5. If you say so. Yet the Muslims report Muhammad married a six year old girl, called for stoning apostates, homosexuals and adulterers, assassinated his critics, imposed a permanent tax of non-muslims in Muslim lands, etc. These things are shirk.Accepting clergy words over the Qur'an. The Muslims insult the messenger much more than any Danish newspapers. They've taken a Book as revelation over the Qur'an. (Hadiths)<br>  <br>  6. Nothing's collapsed. This is just another resource grab. Devaluing paper money (debt currency) and constricting credit is very profitable.<br>  <br>  7. The signs of the increase of military might far outweight two accidental collisions.|`|dtRkn4Jlaa	Assalamoalikum, <br>  I don't think so. Past glory was due to unity, true faith and complete belief in Allah, his commands and his promises. Nowadays, muslims are not united, their faith is so weak, a little wind breaks it, and their believes in Allah and his commands are so weak. They believe in those commands that lets them control others, or order others or justifies their acts, but they do not agree with commands that require them to sacrifices their desires, to give up what they like to do for e.g backbiting, lying, taking advantage of others, spending too much, clothings etc. <br>  <br>  Just because so many people are accepting islam does not mean islam will regain its power. You have to first follow each rule and command of Allah, follow Muhammad SAW's sunnah. Be a true muslim, love all beings, love all muslims and most of all each muslim in whatever country they are or wherever they belong they be united and be one. And until that happens muslims will not regain any glory or power or even respect. There are billion muslims in this world, can you say for a fact, that all billion of them follow islam to the last drop. No, you can for a fact say 80% of those muslims do not follow islam but can't say the opposite. So lets all first improve ourselves and unite and than say now our past glories days have returned. I am a muslim, but seeing muslims around me, it makes me sad that we are so far away from islam and people who are converting to islam are better muslims than us. When the converting muslims and born muslims are the same, believe in the same and are united, no glory will come to anyone. <br>  <br>  Sorry for offending any of my muslim brothers and sisters, but our first step toward change is only when we admit to our faults. May we all be guided. Amen.<br>  <br>  Wassalam|`|rWqrN7Apaa	I hope not, Islam quite possibly has the most violent track record of any religion.|`|N8QLKpCMaa	Wow ! a big wow ********* !<br>  it's truly great & meritorious facts, Islam is the universal religion & going to take place perennially , yes, all world is observing its blessings.<br>  yes, islam will sooner achieve its past glory back with whole dignity !

How can someone ask for something like respect of races if their not willing to give it in the same fashion in which they would like to receive..

You have no idea, in which marvellous manner the Lord showed me the truth about the BoM.<br>  You do not ask for it, I do not tell it.<br>  But I testifty to you, the book of Mormon is true and has nothing to do with the writings of Paul or his students, who wrote in his name.<br>  <br>  @Frosty: No,I have not learned it from birth. I asked God about the eternal life, when I was 19 years old and had never heard before of the LDS or Joseph Smith, but the Lord heard my prayer and led me to the Mormons, let me know his guidance and I hardly can express my thank for the Book of Mormon.|`|FyBNITUlaa	Frosty many members are converts, so that answer is really not very self standing.  I believe in the BOM because the Holy Ghost testified its truthfulness unto me.  Weather you believe that to be true or not means nothing to me and does not make make what I believe to be untrue.  I really have never read any scripture anywhere that states that once God has said it that you should not test that to know with a surety that it is true, over and over in the bible Christ has said to prove him, in other words to test His words to know within your heart that they are true.  It is very contradicting to think that God wants us to believe in his words just because there is scientific evidence to back it up, because if that is how it is supposed to be then what would be the point of faith?  God wants us to exercise our free will as well, to search these things out, to ponder all scripture to know for our selves the truth in all things proclaiming to be true.  We believe that God is the same today as he was yesterday, so if he spoke to his profits yesterday then he speaks to them today, if you don't believe this then you know nothing about God.|`|AA10644435	For me it is because I took Moroni's Challenge in Moroni 10:3-5.<br>  <br>   3 Behold, I would exhort you that when ye shall read these things, if it be wisdom in God that ye should read them, that ye would remember how merciful the Lord hath been unto the children of men, from the creation of Adam even down until the time that ye shall receive these things, and ponder it in your hearts.<br>    4 And when ye shall receive these things, I would exhort you that ye would ask God, the Eternal Father, in the name of Christ, if these things are not true; and if ye shall ask with a sincere heart, with real intent, having faith in Christ, he will manifest the truth of it unto you, by the power of the Holy Ghost.<br>    5 And by the power of the Holy Ghost ye may know the truth of all things.<br>  <br>  IOW I believe the Book of Mormon to be the word of God because I have been given a testimony of it by the Holy Ghost.

The Holy Ghost testifies of its truth repeatedly in my heart & life today as well.<br>  <br>  Secondly, the book of revelations reference to no additional scripture is clearly ONLY for that book, since this same reference is FOUND in 2-3 other places in the Bible too.  I doubt that you want to disregard the ENTIRE bible and yet,  you want to use this reference to discount any additional TRUTH That God chooses to provide for mankind.  Now your logic isn't very clear in my opinion.<br>  <br>  We happen to believe Jesus when He spoke of His "OTHER SHEEP" and that they, like His followers in Jerusalem also knew of His coming and keep sacred records like the Bible, of their own religious history and people.  TO think that God only knew, cared about and spoke to His children in Jerusalem and NO WHERE else in the world is rather narrow, shallow and just plain silly I think.  I believe that He loves ALL HIS CHILDREN and that He didn't STOP speaking to us when Christ left this earth.  He continues to speak to us today - through Modern day Prophets.  <br>  <br>  The Book of Mormon stands as a second witness of Jesus Christ.  If you have never taken the time to read it, that might be a good place to start before making grand assumptions about it.

That's why most Mormons don't believe the Book of Mormon is from God just because Joseph Smith said so.

In thus pronouncing the canon of revelation closed, our friends in some other faiths shut the door on divine expression that we in The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints hold dear: the Book of Mormon, the Doctrine and Covenants, the Pearl of Great Price, and the ongoing guidance received by God's anointed prophets and apostles. Imputing no ill will to those who take such a position, nevertheless we respectfully but resolutely reject such an unscriptural characterization of true Christianity." <br>  <br>  Jeffrey R.

"If any of you lack wisdom, let him ask of God, that giveth to all men liberally, and upbraideth not; and it shall be given him."  James 1:5<br>  <br>  Near the end of the Book of Mormon, the final ancient author of the many that wrote in it, admonishes the reader to do the following:<br>  <br>  Behold, I would exhort you that when ye shall read these things, if it be wisdom in God that ye should read them, that ye would remember how merciful the Lord hath been unto the children of men, from the creation of Adam even own until the time that ye shall receive these things, and ponder it in your hearts. <br>    4 And when ye shall receive these things, I would exhort you that ye would ask God, the Eternal Father, in the name of Christ, if these things are not true; and if ye shall ask with a sincere heart, with real intent, having faith in Christ, he will manifest the truth of it unto you, by the power of the Holy Ghost. <br>    5 And by the power of the Holy Ghost ye may know the truth of all things.     Moroni 10:3-5<br>  <br>  So in other words, it is not what Joseph Smith says that really matters.  It was what the Holy Spirit comfirms that does.

The more you examine real evidence rather than popular opinion & media hype, the more you realise that the balance of evidence does not point towards evolution, in fact quite the opposite. However, the evidence we have doesn't "prove" the biblical creation account & timescales either. <br>  Many people take the Genesis account too literally rather than asking themselves what it's really meant to tell us. It sure isn't meant to give us a scientifically accurate account of process & timescale, but it sure is far more than a poetic or stylised prologue to the Bible which really begins in Exodus.<br>  As for evolution, the only evidence we have is adaptation within species. The fossil record shows a sudden explosion of species after the "snowball earth" which put an end to most previous life-forms such as dinosaurs. If evolution were true, then we would see a gradual diversification of species over time. This certainly doesn't happen. In fact we see a gradual diminishment in the number of species over time.<br>  Whatever happened, it sure wasn't evolution as taught, nor is the Biblical prologue an accurate scientific account. However, there is more evidence in support of something along the lines of the Genesis account than there is for evolution.<br>  On this basis, people who really have the facts available tend to favour the genesis account as even with all its flaws it is a better fit for the available evidence.|`|B6cOlFU9aa	Some people have very strong faith. You shouldn't criticize them, you wouldn't like it if someone made fun of yours. Its alright if they want to believe that God made the world.<br>  <br>  A teacher once said to me: "The bible says that God made the world in seven days, but who decides how long a day is?

But I have decided to leave the church that I've been a member of for 20 yrs to join one a few miles away that is orthodox. Where the priest isn't afraid to talk about sins, hell, and repentance instead of being good and nice to others.<br>  <br>  If you are thinking of converting to a different religion, then that's a bigger subject. Talk to your priest/pastor/minister about it. Join a Bible study group to find out what you might be missing or to learn what you don't know.

But is your husband a person that spends alot of time making up his mind? Is he one of those people you can see all the reasons on both sides equally? If he is he may never be 100% sure because that is just the way he rolls. Personally If I were in your situation I'd say Honey, you are going to do God's will wherever you are, I feel better at this other church, why don't we change and if we ever feel we have made a mistake we can move back to our first church. Some people just need you to be a tiebreaker. I ask God to reveal his will to me and I trust that he will keep satan from interfering. Good luck and God Bless.

For many people there is just no desire to come to terms with that.|`|JTD3M8Ziaa	Because people are unable to accept that when they die they simply cease to exist.

Deal with it.|`|QVKWVValaa	As a crutch. The meaningless nature of life scares them. So does death. People need religion to feel that they were somehow special.

AAGW4kAhaa	I think you're just being honest with yourself and thinking logically.  God is not logical.  God is God.  Things that are written are believed by faith, not logic.  I would pray for understanding, because I believe you believe in God, it's just that you don't understand how any of these miraculous happenings could occur.  God will reveal what He needs to reveal to you in the time that is right. At least you're honest enough to admit that you have doubt.  Many people pretend to believe what they don't. Keep praying!<br>  <br>  Also, note: It wasn't a whale that swallowed Jonah, it was a giant fish that God prepared.|`|LjsRfaskaa	There is more external evidence for the lost continent of Atlantis than for Jesus. Christianity has no festivals of its own, all of them are plagiarized from the northern Celtic traditions, dates and all. All they did was substitute Jesus instead of the sun as the messiah. <br>  <br>  Christmas, 25th december is the birth of the new sun, after dying by dropping below the horizon in the winter. By dec 25th the sun is clearly above the horizon again signifying his birth.<br>  <br>  Easter, the spring equinox and the sun is in the centre of the Cross constellation, ie as per the Celtic Cross. Signifying the resurrection of life, as it tends to do at that time of year. <br>  <br>  All the elements of Christianity are not original to their faith. The bible was the invention of an insane despot, desperate to regain control after the plague killed off 50% of the population. The last emperor of Rome, Constantine. He ordered the libraries of Alexandria to be burnt setting mankind back millenia. He made a pact with the Visigoths to sake Europe in its weakened state specifically so Rome could regain control. <br>  <br>  The history of Christianity is not a pretty sight.<br>  <br>  Practicing Shaman... quantum physics rocks.|`|FmazIF6Maa	My opinion is... the Bible is mythology, just like Greek myths and Hindu myths.<br>  <br>  <br>  That's not meant to be a put down. Mythology has always been mans way of explaining what they believe about the Higher Power. It contains wisdom, the symbolism and analogies speak to our subconscious, our souls even, in a way that literal explanations never could. <br>  <br>  But if you compare the Bible to other myths of it's time, and one's that precede it, in that part of the world, you'll find it has a great deal in common with them. <br>  <br>  Personally I am religious and I believe in living mythically, I just don't believe in taking myths literally.|`|8zelZj3Aaa	You have to ask yourself, "do I believe in God"? If you do then you must believe He is the Creator of all things. If you believe this do you think He would have any problem with a large fish, or the parting of a Sea or helping Moses. These miracles were used to help convince the people that He is the one true God. Today we have the Word, the Bible, to teach and convince us, they did not. If you don't believe, that's another story and I certainly would not judge your goodness or your badness. Being good or bad is relative in this world, but He will know.|`|C1SOqQSkaa	You appear to be cursed with the ability to reason logically. This is frequently the end of faith-based thinking.<br>  <br>  I wish you well. You have access to information that others in your position in earlier decades never had. Read, learn and enjoy. Good luck.|`|AA11282654	You are not a bad person for this. Keep wondering. I agree it seems very much like a fairy tale.|`|3EudCWEuaa	My friend:<br>  <br>  Doubt is not the opposite of faith, it is a part of faith. We all have them. Even some of the most influential people in the world had doubts. The apostles at times had doubts, Moses had doubts, etc.. Do not fear you doubts, explore them in the light of God and you will come to a greater truth.<br>  <br>  Whales are adequately large enough to hold a man in them. Many of the stories of Exodus can happen scientifically and have been observed before (such as the swarms, boils, sea turning red, etc.). If God can create a universe, couldn't he also change a rod into a snake? God controls all matter. <br>  <br>  Don't ever doubt that God uses science, but God is the force behind all things scientific.<br>  <br>  When you face your doubts, you must keep your mind and heart open, and view both sides of the argument (don't just listen to atheists). Keep an open mind and see if any of them are scientifically feasable, and I think you will find that they are. There are very few instances where it can't immediately be explained scientifically, but we must have faith that the creator of this universe can do all things.<br>  <br>  You will ultimately take 1 of two paths when you have these doubts: <br>  <br>  Path 1: You will explore them deeply, and view all of your doubts in the light of God. You will seek answers to these tough questions, and find that with God all things are possible, and many of those things can actually happen scientifically. In this path, your faith will grow strong, and you will have a higher level of truth. This is the narrow path that many people do not follow.<br>  <br>  Path 2: You will let your doubts corrupt your mind. They will confuse you and you will just reject God without giving them a hard look or seeing if there is any possible way it could have happened. You can blindly accept atheists arguments without hearing the religious side of them. Never forget that Satan's first attempt to corrupt the mind of Adam and Eve started with a question. He caused them to doubt God. In this path, it leads to misery, sadness, and rejection of God. This is the wide path that many follow, but yet it is the incorrect path.<br>  <br>  Asking questions is great. You may become one of the most intelligent people in the world. Don't fight the questions, answer them! You may even find the answers to most of these common questions people have and become a great spiritual leader some day. Billy Graham too started with doubts, but he became one of the most influential evangelists we know. But look at doubts with objective eyes, and keep God in your heart.<br>  <br>  I wish you the best. If you ever have problems or tough questions, let me know! God bless.|`|t44168wJaa	no you are not a bad person you are trying to learn. yes those things did happen if god can create the universe and every living thing on it i think he could make a staff become a snake and the reason these things don't happen anymore is because no one would believe it they would say it was magic or trickery and that would defeat the purpose back then there wasn't magic so the people had to believe it was from a higher power, god bless|`|8UP6iQ5Zaa	You are looking for signs. Yes, the Bible is God's word, and it is all true, but the outward displays of God's power are rare today, mostly in divine healing (not healers) through faithful prayer of the saints....and that is rare also. It is clear..."the just shall live by faith." Will you trust God's word and God's will for your life without seeing the miracles of the past. Keep in mind that many who witnessed them in the past did not follow Christ later on. They always wanted more.|`|wxBFZ41Taa	You are not a bad person, it is normal and encouraged for you to ask questions...but don't assume your reasoning is infallible and perfect.<br>  <br>  God tell us to seek him, and if we do we will find him.<br>  <br>  God is the same yesterday, today and tomorrow, but we are not. We changed and so how we relate to God changes. That is what you see over time. The Bible teaches us on many different levels, to know and understand God.|`|uIxqtzsYaa	it is according to your faith. i believe these thing really did happen.as i saw miracles in my life i saw what God really can do.i had to develop a personal relationship with God for myself to really come to know the truth and believe.people can tell you and help you learn about these things, God will confirm them.|`|MF9YknDYaa	There is no god,it's a stupid story.If you told people that you saw some film star in a local shop most will not believe you(but it's possible),tell them that bible stuff about people coming back to life etc and they believe you!!.|`|oen1tuyTaa	Well done and welcome to the real world.<br>  You only gotta look at JAWS....Did anyone survive after being in his stomach?

You would have spent most of your life preparing and pursuing it.  I'm not saying you don't have a "calling" on your life Josh, because I don't know you well enough to determine that.  <br>      It's O.K. to question and doubt God's Words as it was men who wrote them and blotched them up.  But you can put God's sincerity to the test if you haven't already done so Joshua.  If you notice your life going to "pot" and  spiraling downhill, because you've grown distant from God, and each time you get in HIS Word, you notice how well you lives grows and prospers, that's also the same God you doubted.  This is a good way to know that God is working in your life Joshua.

bf4cc388616ba9cb48357f54373c609eaa	Loren S provided the answer that I am most familiar with. Wild Texas Longhorned Cattle were worth about three dollars per head down in South Texas in the Brush Country right after the Civil War. If they were driven to the railhead at Abilene, Kansas they were worth twenty-eight to thirty dollars per head. When you got your herd to Abilene they were fatter and in better shape than when you left South Texas if you were a good trail boss and knew your stuff. Abilene, like other towns that served as shipping points, were wild and wooly and full of fleas. <br>  When cowboys and wranglers and cooks and even some  trail bosses got the herds to the railheads, after sixty to ninety days on the trail, they were paid all back wages and had more money in their pockets than they ever had before. Many cowboys and wranglers spent most or all of their pay in the town where they were paid. Many trailbosses kept back trainfare back home so the young and inexperienced could get back home.  Many outfits turned south with the chuck wagon and returned using the same mode of travel that had brought them north.<br>     O K, time for recess.

I think rules like "Don't hurt little kids" are more important than "thou shalt have no other gods before me".<br>  <br>  Maybe I should stop being just atheist and admit that I'm basically a Satanist. The only thing that is stopping me at the moment is the fact that I dress kind of metal/goth and I listen to heavy music- I don't want to give off the impression that I'm some stereotype. Stupid people need all the help they can get to learn that Satanist doesn't = goth/metalhead, I don't want to undo other people's hard work.<br>  <br>  Remember kids, not all forms of Satanism involve an actual solid red guy with horns.

Lucifer was Gods favorite angel, at one time.  With that, don't be fooled.  A true atheist is indifferent, a true Satanist believes there is a Satan (or Lucifer), therefore believe there is God.<br>  <br>  Insofar as a religion that pushes self indulgence here on earth, and that there is no afterlife, realize the creation of earth and the laws of physics which it is bound to makes for the creation of obstacles and the trials and tribulations that develop what's called 'consciousness'.  Without them we'd be vegetables.  Another reason for these trials and tribulations is to test us for obedience.  And if you question the existence of an afterlife, I'd suggest speaking with a physics professor.  More than likely they will set you straight on that (the consciousness is made up of energy developed by these trials and tribulations on earth, and cannot be destroyed even if the body dies).

They accused him of blasphemy and breaking the sabbath. However, they could not, under the Roman occupation, carry out a death penalty, but the Romans could, so they took him before the Romans and changed the charges against him to treason and sedition against the Roman government.  Pilate didn't buy it, but was forced to capitulate to the religious leaders of the Jews.<br>  <br>  As Jesus said:<br>  <br>  But this cometh to pass, that the word might be fulfilled that is written in their law, They hated me without a cause. - John 15:25<br>  <br>  .|`|H8WqMK1eaa	The Romans wanted him dead for treason...the possibility of stirring up rebellion amongst the Jews (since he said he was the king of the jews.)<br>  <br>  The teachers of the Jewish Law wanted him dead for blasphemy...since Jesus continually made reference to his divinity.|`|hQDapmICaa	I am not sure, but this may be the answer:<br>  <br>  Lev 24:15  And thou shalt speak unto the children of Israel, saying, Whosoever curseth his God shall bear his sin. <br>  <br>  Lev 24:16  And he that blasphemeth the name of the LORD, he shall surely be put to death, and all the congregation shall certainly stone him: as well the stranger, as he that is born in the land, when he blasphemeth the name of the LORD, shall be put to death. <br>  <br>  <br>  Joh 19:7  The Jews answered him, We have a law, and by our law he ought to die, because he made himself the Son of God. <br>  <br>  <br>  Again here:<br>  <br>  Mar 14:61  But he held his peace, and answered nothing.

Well, what was Jehovah God's penalty for Adam if he sinned? Was it not death? (Genesis 2:16, 17) "The wages sin pays is death," wrote the apostle Paul. (Romans 6:23) Adam paid for his sin with his own death. He was given life, he chose to sin, and he died as a penalty for his sin. (Genesis 3:19) What about the condemnation that the entire human race came under because of that sin? A death was needed to atone for their sins. But whose death could justly cover the transgressions of all mankind?<br>  <br>  The original sin created a very critical problem for mankind. Adam began life as a perfect human. Therefore, his children could have enjoyed perfect everlasting life. However, Adam sinned before he fathered any children. The entire human race was still in his loins when he received the sentence: "In the sweat of your face you will eat bread until you return to the ground, for out of it you were taken. For dust you are and to dust you will return." (Genesis 3:19) So when Adam sinned and began to die as God said he would, all mankind was sentenced to death along with him.<br>  <br>  Consider the solution God laid out in the sentence he pronounced on Satan the Devil. Jehovah said to Satan: "I shall put enmity between you and the woman [God's heavenly organization] and between your seed [the world under Satan's control] and her seed [Jesus Christ]. He will bruise you [Satan] in the head and you will bruise him in the heel [Jesus' death]." (Genesis 3:15) In this first prophecy of the Bible, Jehovah alluded to his purpose to have his heavenly spirit Son come to earth to live as the perfect man Jesus and then die—be bruised in the heel—in that sinless state.<br>  <br>  Adam's death had no value; he deserved to die for his sin. Jesus' death, however, had great value because he died in a sinless state. Jehovah God could accept the value of Jesus' perfect life as a ransom for obedient descendants of sinful Adam. And the value of Jesus' sacrifice does not stop at paying for our past sins. If it did, we would have no future. Being conceived in sin, we are bound to err again. (Psalm 51:5) How grateful we can be that Jesus' death makes provision for us to gain the perfection that Jehovah originally intended for the offspring of Adam and Eve!|`|j6GVLXgDaa	blasphemy I think, but keep in mind he's still alive|`|iAXmdQOEaa	The jews wanted him dead.

They consider him one of the greatest of God’s messengers to mankind.  The Quran confirms his virgin birth, and a chapter of the Quran is entitled ‘Maryam’ (Mary).  The Quran describes the birth of Jesus as follows:<br>   (Remember) when the angels said, “O Mary, God gives you good news of a word from Him (God), whose name is the Messiah Jesus, son of Mary, revered in this world and the Hereafter, and one of those brought near (to God).  He will speak to the people from his cradle and as a man, and he is of the righteous.” She said, “My Lord, how can I have a child when no mortal has touched me?” He said, “So (it will be).  God creates what He wills.  If He decrees a thing, He says to it only, ‘Be!’ and it is.”  (Quran, 3:45-47)<br>  Jesus was born miraculously by the command of God, the same command that had brought Adam into being with neither a father nor a mother.  God has said:<br>   The case of Jesus with God is like the case of Adam.  He created him from dust, and then He said to him, “Be!” and he came into being.  (Quran, 3:59)<br>  During his prophetic mission, Jesus performed many miracles.  God tells us that Jesus said:<br>   “I have come to you with a sign from your Lord.  I make for you the shape of a bird out of clay, I breathe into it, and it becomes a bird by God’s permission.  I heal the blind from birth and the leper.  And I bring the dead to life by God’s permission.  And I tell you what you eat and what you store in your houses....”  (Quran, 3:49)<br>  Muslims believe that Jesus was not crucified.  It was the plan of Jesus’ enemies to crucify him, but God saved him and raised him up to Him.  And the likeness of Jesus was put over another man.  Jesus’ enemies took this man and crucified him, thinking that he was Jesus.  God has said:<br>   ...They said, “We killed the Messiah Jesus, son of Mary, the messenger of God.” They did not kill him, nor did they crucify him, but the likeness of him was put on another man (and they killed that man)...

ALQuQaLGaa	Hi,<br>  <br>  I am proud of you for wanting to learn a new language! :)<br>  Interaction is important in learning any language.  I don't want to discourage you, though... I know that Indian Punjabi isn't as ubiquitous as Spanish or French, but even if there are no Indian Punjabi speakers in the neighborhood... there's the internet... it's so neat to have the whole world eh??<br>  <br>  I have a website for you.  It's a language exchange forum.  You set up a profile/account and find a language partner, you share your native language with them and vice versa.<br>  <br>  www.Sharedtalk.com<br>  <br>  There's also a lot of software available.  Rosetta Stone is expensive but it's probably worth it... there are other programs.  Berlitz is very respected as well.  They sell books and CDs and I am sure they also sell computer programs.<br>  <br>  When I started learning Spanish a million years ago, lol, the very first thing I learned was the Spanish alphabet.  I don't know if that is the case for non-romance languages.  The next thing we did was memorize a list of infinitives (to make, to do, to talk,etc.)  As a Spanish teacher I'm using a different method.<br>  <br>  It's a good idea to make some flashcards.  <br>  <br>  The important thing to remember is not to get overwhelmed because there's so much to learn.  You CAN learn the language but don't get discouraged by trying to learn too much at once.  Learn a little bit each day.  Even a little progress brings you closer to your goal.<br>  <br>  Everything is hard before it becomes easy.  That's what I tell my students.  <br>  <br>  Spanish, for some reason, always came naturally to me.  I'm not sure why.  I'm learning French and I get overwhelmed but I tell myself that one day, French will come naturally to me. :)  <br>  <br>  Bonne chance!!|`|vY0ScgeXaa	you need speaking environment.<br>  <br>  you need to be exposed to either a population or some major environment that has the language you wanna learn as its native language.<br>  <br>  for example, if you wanna learn english, the best way is to go to either aus, united states, uk or canada, and attend a language school, finally go to college, grad school, get a job there, and live there for the rest of ur life. that way you can learn english well.|`|rLCx5ljQaa	Practice practice practice.<br>  <br>  Go on Punjabi websites, listen to Punjabi music, talk to people that only speak this language (if u can).<br>  <br>  the best way to learn is within the cultural context - if you learn in some western classroom with a half trained teacher u probably wont even learn it properly.<br>  <br>  Even if you dont know the words the style of the language will become familiar and you will learn it much easier.<br>  <br>  Learning a language takes YEARS and isnt something to be taken lightly. i'm guessing you already know this though.<br>  <br>  and dont try anything gimicky like the old 'one word per day' approach...things like that dont work.|`|DaKOec8aaa	always take your note in anywhere you go.....when you hear a new  word  take down on your note  soon as you can ,,,,,know the meaning  of it , and also don't forget  to know  the "opposite" meaning  at the same time ......means  1 new new word will be  2 new words  to  know at the same time .....knowing also the passed,present and future tense is very important ...........good luck!!!|`|KFX3dTwZaa	hum... its gonna be hard as its not a language that use the same script but what you could do<br>  <br>  1. make flashcards<br>  2. start using small words in your everyday vocab (eg: spoon, bread etc...)<br>  3. the best thing is to move and stay somewhere where you will be bombarded with the language. in a few months you'll be fluent im sure|`|95279c3e886c01fd779498ebe313bee8aa	Sabai de mai teerak good luck learning your new language :)|`|8RZTpFeHaa	My spanish teacher says the only way to learn a new language is to say it and destroy it and keep destroying it in til we get it right and so far its been more then half a school year and we know more then what a text book says.|`|3dfZhJwLaa	This site has great tips on learning a language<br>  <a href="http://www.socyberty.com/Languages/Learning-a-Language.530279" rel="nofollow">http://www.socyberty.com/Languages/Learn...</a>

I understood that when he was first starting out in NYC and doing a play he fell for one of the Dancers in his show (male) it was well known back then that Tom was Gay.  Yet as soon as he got to Hollywood and image makers got a hold of him it flipped and thus he went through his string of marriages.  Each one he entered were "contractual"  Mimi Rogers was quoted as saying (Tom's first wife) that his sexual habits were not was she was use to.  That marriage ended rather abruptly and she had to retract that statement within 24 hrs.  Nicole Kidman, Cruise's second wife was a nobody and the moment she got her first Golden Globe for Moulin Rouge she left Cruise under the guise that he left her.  He then went on to date other hollywood starlets who have played "beards" for lead hollywood men.  Then came time to find another starlet to make famous.  He shopped several and the story lines are there till finally landing upon Katie Holmes who it was said entered into a financial and career contract with him.  Cruise has spent an enormous amount of money either suing folks who claim he is gay or taking out entire page ads proclaming his hetereosexuality.  His religion, Scientology is also well known in Hollywood for hiding their sexuality. I.E. John Travolta and numerous others.  I for one have always felt that when thou does protest to much you have something to hide.|`|ZIG2332Faa	I agree with jmanoh, it really doesn't matter. <br>  It is about time we take people for their values as individuals and performance and not their sexual orientation.<br>  Then again, like you mentioned, it could be wishful thinking from the part of those interested in it to be true or it could be that those who think homosexuality is degrading, want to bring him down.|`|AA11615514	Does it really matter if he is or isn't?

It also proves he wasn't very bright, since all trees have a growing season, and expecting fruit out of season is unreasonable. Also, trees stop producing fruit when they get old. But a god would have known that, too. Condemning a fig tree to death for not having a fig for him when he wanted one is just nutty.|`|V0oc22ryaa	Wouldn't you cut down an apple tree that didn't give you any apples and it was cold and you could use it for firewood instead?, I would.|`|ngew4AWSaa	Well that's not very nice, is it.<br>  <br>  And I don't hate fig trees, damn it.|`|AA11466759	Yeah, and what does Nathaniel have to do with it?<br>  (That's what I'd like to know)|`|2d3c0dd80f2737f4fd6ec8f62b612c70aa	At Luke 13:8,?9. Jesus gave an illustration about a fig tree, he had already been preaching for three years, endeavoring to cultivate faith among members of the Jewish nation. Jesus intensified his activity, “fertilizing” the symbolic fig tree—the Jewish nation—and affording it an opportunity to produce fruit. The week before Jesus died, however, it became evident that the nation in general had rejected the Messiah.—Matthew 23:37,?38.<br>  . While traveling from Bethany to Jerusalem four days before his death, he saw a fig tree that had abundant leaves but no fruit whatsoever. Since the early figs appear along with the leaves—and sometimes even before the leaves develop—the tree’s lack of fruit showed that it was worthless.—Mark 11:13,?14.<br>  <br>  Like the unproductive fig tree that looked healthy, the Jewish nation had a deceptive outward appearance. But it had not produced godly fruitage, and it finally rejected Jehovah’s own Son. Jesus cursed the sterile fig tree, and on the following day, the disciples noticed that it had already withered. That dried-up tree aptly signified God’s forthcoming rejection of the Jews as his chosen people.—Mark 11:20,?21.|`|c64d6c7caaa6ff5455c25c84c0d7cbc8aa	LOL ur a man without understanding.THis is the reason atheist are stupid to me they are quick to judge.The death of the fig tree symbolizes Jesus death.When a fig tree dies it leaves fruits which represents the disciples.Obviously this is alll spiritual.|`|0YQRbq9faa	I always thought that the lush fig tree that was bearing no fruit, but gave indications that is was fruit bearing; is a picture of phony religious people who talk the talk but don't walk the walk of the Christian life as clearly taught in the Bible.|`|zQyslfHKaa	Not to mention all the mango, avacado and money trees he withered that weren't mentioned.|`|XJ9oSR2daa	IF you read the story you would understand the metaphor behind it.|`|pOP0Jt0Qaa	He wants us to walk around naked.|`|g4AAZRuxaa	Jesus was looking for fruit and could not find any.|`|TjwgBFCzaa	Fig trees I thought it was an apple tree!!!!!<br>  <br>  Walks away mumbling
ZzYy2szvaa	Remember that most parents 1st priority is the safety of their children.  It seems to me that they have clung on to all the bad stories they hear about gay people (getting beaten up everywhere, being  raped, drugged etc), but not all that stuff happens to everyone.  Granted, once your open you WILL need to be more cautious about it (because homophobes are a real danger), but you shouldn't have to worry about it now.<br>  <br>  Once you are more open about it, you will learn to care less about those that judge you and you will find a nice group of people who will accept you for who you are.  Stuff those others that don't like it, you can find people who will still treat you normally.  This world has some amazing people in it.<br>  <br>  As far as coming out at work goes - it's not any of their business.  Do you see straight people putting "Heterosexual" on their CVs?  NO!  A person's sexual orientation is a private matter, so don't worry about future "job" problems because being gay has NOTHING to do with your work.  If it could be a problem (homophobic boss etc), then you could just ask your partner to act as a best friend or something around your workplace, and as someone who really cares about you, he would understand.<br>  <br>  When I say it's private, I mean it is something that you, your family and close friends know - you don't have to tell strangers and you can deny rumours if you want to.  Close family deserves to know - they are the ones that need to be sat down and gently briefed.  As family, they will learn to accept you over time.  With most people, it will take time, but they eventually will reach a point where they realise you are still just the son/brother/cousin/whatever that you were before!  Friends, however painful it may sound, are flexible, and might have to change if they are unnaccepting people. You need to find a group of people that will be positive around you and treat you with the respect you deserve.<br>  <br>  As far as a boyfriend goes, you could meet him anywhere, but obviously if you want to go to an LGBT club, that's fine.  I know many women love accompanying their gay friends to gay clubs, and so in no time, you'll be able to go clubbing with friends.<br>  <br>  Your parents are just showing you their full concern for you.  They will accept it in time.  But please realise that some of their concern is correct, you need to be a little more cautious in strange areas where someone might hold a grudge against you or in a generally homophobic area.<br>  <br>  Sorry that it was so long, but I felt like you needed the reassurance =)  I'm sure things'll be fine!  Good Luck!|`|nXBPXVnkaa	Sounds like your parents are now "in the closet" about having a gay son. They're projecting their fears on to you. Don't let them get to you. Live your life and get out there. You're a 22 year old adult who's free to do as you please. Good luck.|`|UOLtJocMaa	I do not think your parents mean to make you paranoid or frightened they are just trying to protect what they believe is your best interest.  Look it seems odd to you your parents behavior but depending upon where you live and all, you can be harmed because of your openness about your sexuality.  I would say that you should try to find a balance between your parents wishes and your own desires. Maybe focus on your schooling and if a bf comes around then cool but you are in school to learn. I do not really see where your parents are wrong in that regard.  You will have plenty of time to do whatever you want once you get your education and own place. I am guessing you stay with them? If not, do as you wish.  They just dont want people to know because either they are afraid of what ppl will think or they are trying to protect you; maybe both. I say confront them on the issue. But if you are in a losing battle (living with them) do not bring it up any further.  Hey at least you are out of the closet and they didnt disown you.  <br>  <br>  Answer mine please: <a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;_ylt=Aj0.w6PwdTCZOC4W7nqx7Djsy6IX;_ylv=3?qid=20090223055504AAzwM1m">http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;...</a>|`|kc1IBYMRaa	Nonsense.  I know plenty of gay men and lesbian women in the health care field.  It depends entirely on where you live.  At your age, why would you live anywhere that you would not be totally respected as a gay man?  You must live in a red state, and they are fast becoming inconsequential.  I was my districts first openly gay public school teacher more than ten years ago.  If you think health care is conservative, try education!  Now we have gay superintendents, principals, guidance counselors--and many gay ppl in our state govt.  Discrimination against gays is history.  <br>  <br>  Come into the light, my friend, and leave the backwater states in the dust!|`|dL2k6hORaa	Being openly gay is not the problem, one can be gay without making it a point of announcing your personal sexual feeling to the whole world. Best to keep yourself private and the rest of those around you at arms length.  Gay people often get paid at a lower rate.|`|SE2xiEupaa	You have to make the decision for yourself, not for them. You are an adult, and are responsible for your own choices and decisions. Coming out is hard, and many people will not understand. At the end of the day, you have to be satisfied with yourself, and know that you were true to yourself. That is the only way to work toward happiness. You cannot be truly happy unless you are honest with yourself and with those who love and care about you. It gets better, I promise. I have been there. <br>  <br>  You must surround yourself with people who support you. Also, don't worry about getting beat up, I doubt that you will have to worry about that. Just make sure that you have support and love to ground you. Good Luck!|`|UbvglIS6aa	Your parent's fears are based on air.  There is no reason why you can't live a perfectly good life as an out gay person.   There are very few people who get "Beat Up".  Honestly, it's the exception rather than the norm.  You will find a job in whatever field you enter.  And you can have a relationship with the person of your choice.  Relax.  Don't let your parent's unfounded fear keep you in the closet.|`|NYU37jfGaa	Well, if your parents say they have no problem with you being gay, but do have a problem with other people knowing, then clearly they do have a problem with it.  I think you should discuss this with them further.  Ask them what exactly they mean by saying they don't have a problem with you being gay, but then make it clear they want you to keep it a secret.  That doesn't sound to me like they don't have a problem with it.<br>  <br>  And really I don't think it is very sensible of them to say you don't need a sex life at 22.  You are at the peak time when most people do want a sex life, I mean it's one of the things most people do at college, after all.  They really do seem to be in a state about this.  <br>  <br>  I have absolutely no idea whether health science is a 'conservative field' or not, but how much, really, do your parents know about it?  There's no point in pretending there isn't prejudice against gay people, because of course there is, but I do think your parents are probably exaggerating.  Is there some way you could find out for yourself?  Can you talk to your professors at college about it?  I would have thought that if there was any group of people less likely than others to get in a flap about someone being gay it would be college professors, I mean I imagine some of them are gay themselves, and the ones who aren't have probably seen it all.

It is not inappropriate to thank God for the gifts we've been given, to ask for his intercession. He may even pray that God's will be for him to win or he may be praying that no one be seriously hurt. It would only be an issue if he failed to continue to pray after the result was not what he had wished for. In this arena there will usually be a winner and a loser, regardless if both sincerely believe and pray for God's will to be in their favour, it can not be that both win, inevitably God's will, will be done.<br>      ps.

d9fb2acd20fb4c3590182dc9f4470d89aa	Jesus said this once when a religious leader came to see Him:<br>  <br>   "I tell you the truth, no one can see the kingdom of God unless he is born again." <br>  "How can a man be born when he is old?" Nicodemus asked. "Surely he cannot enter a second time into his mother's womb to be born!" <br>  Jesus answered, "I tell you the truth, no one can enter the kingdom of God unless he is born of water and the Spirit. Flesh gives birth to flesh, but the Spirit[b] gives birth to spirit. You should not be surprised at my saying, 'You must be born again.' "  (John 3:3-7)<br>  <br>  I was raised Catholic. I tried to do the right thing, but I was a much better sinner than a saint. I became very disillusioned with God as a teenager and thought He was a big screw-up - so I fired Him - told Him to get out of my life.<br>  Much to my surprise, He did, for a while.<br>  All the joy and meaning went out of my life. Everything became drab, colorless, hollow; I lost the ability to laugh or smile. Every time I heard laughter it was as if the world was laughing at me. I felt I was sinking into a bottomless pit.<br>  Then one day something happened which was totally unexpected and I did not even know was possible. I came home, and in a state of despair, fell on my face and started crying, when a voice spoke inside my heart this word: "Maybe Jesus really did die for your sins"<br>  Suddenly a great change came over me, and I felt I was lifted from the lowest pit to the highest mountaintop. A flood of love and peace and joy and acceptance and understanding filled me, driving out the darkness and meaninglessness - and for the first time I knew that God was real, and that He had really forgiven me, and that the Gospel was real, and I had an inner assurance that when this life was over, I had a place reserved for me in heaven.<br>  I became a changed man that day, and started to live a different life. It was a year before I realized from reading the Bible that what happened to me was that I was born again, born of the (Holy) Spirit.<br>  I have lived with God now in my life for over 38 years, and learned much, but the one lesson I learned that day was that God was, in the Person of Jesus Christ come down from heaven, crucified for sinners - and especially for me - and raised from the dead, now to give the gift of eternal life to all who call upon Him in faith, and live a life of love, as He commanded.|`|UinOWcMUaa	Know Jesus and you shall Know Heaven...<br>  No Jesus.. No Heaven :)<br>  <br>  Heaven is described as being a place that if you tried to put into words it's beauty it would be a disgrace.. translated -- beyond words :)<br>  <br>  If a sinner accepts Jesus.. into their life by faith, believer's and is baptized and truly repents, is born again.. then sinner you will go to Heaven ! Wen we get to Heaven we get a grand tour of the place, and praise God almighty for everlasting life.<br>  <br>  A sin is considered anything that misses the mark or against God's righteousness and standars.. sin, as defined in the original translations of the Bible, means "to miss the mark." The mark, in this case, is the standard of perfection established by God and evidenced by Jesus. Viewed in that light, it is clear that we are all sinners. <br>  <br>  The Apostle Paul says in Romans 3:23: "All have sinned and fall short of the glory of God."|`|q6H2ru3waa	Those who believe that Jesus Christ died for their sins will go to heaven.  John 3:16 confirms the way to to get to heaven.  Heaven is what God promised ,Rev 21:4; And God shall wipe away all tears from their eyes; and there shall be no more death, neither sorrow, nor crying, neither shall there be any more pain: for the former things are passed away. Once repent you are saved,  you are no longer considered a "sinner" you are a new creature, in Christ, old things are passed away and all things become new. A sin is disobedience to The Word of God.|`|AEAxZEveaa	I don't have an answer for you. But an interesting note on the subject is the fact that the Jewish faith doesn't really focus on heaven and hell. I don't even think it's mentioned in the Torah. From my reading on different religions, it appears that Zoroastrianism influenced Christian beliefs when it comes to heaven and hell. That's not what you were asking, but I think it's good to know. <br>  <br>  Personally, I call myself a christian, but I think christians should draw closer to the Jewish way of thinking, which is that life should be more focused on making the world a better place, instead of avoiding sin. I don't really believe in heaven or hell. Maybe heaven, but not hell. I think God loves you no matter what. I consider sin to be hurting people, yourself included. But that's just me, lots will disagree with that.|`|AA11466759	who gets to heaven:  only me.<br>  who gets into hell:  no one else exists, but for my pleasure<br>  what do I think heaven is like?  whatever I make it out to be<br>  accepting icyce:  no one else exists, so that's moot<br>  what happens in heaven:  whatever I want.<br>  <br>  <----not much of a Christian.<br>  <br>  oh, and what is sin?  anything that gives me extreme displeasure.

The Holy Bible says that we all as human beings will have to stand before the Judgement seat of Christ Jesus at the time appointed by the Heavenly Father. (Holy Bible 2 Corinthians 5:10)<br>  <br>  If a human being accepts Jesus Christ as his Lord and Saviour, the person will be guided by the Holy Spirit of God to repent of all disobedience in the sight of God Almighty the Heavenly Father and ask God to be washed by the precious blood of the Lamb of God shed on the cross at Calvary to be righteous in the sight of God Almighty.<br>  <br>  1) If we are loving God we will not be worshipping false gods or bowing down before idols.<br>  2) If we are loving our neighbors in the human family and society, we will not be murdering them, lying to them, committing adultery against them, or coveting material things which belongs to them.<br>  <br>  Sin is disobedience to the commandments of Holy Eternal Heavenly Father God Almighty. <br>  <br>  If you repent of your sins to the Heavenly Father and ask to be washed by the Precious blood of the Lamb of God shed on the Cross at Calvary, you will be forgiven and become righteous in the sight of the Holy Eternal God Almighty in Christ Jesus.<br>  <br>  Eve the wife of Adam was deceived by Satan to disobey God Almighty.

However, the true answers are in the Bible so you should read it although sometimes its hard :p. Well, Going to heaven or hell is all decided upon if you accept Jesus as your personal savior or not. If you believe you go to heaven and if you dont you go to hell. Although no one has gone to heaven and come back to tell the story, the Bible says that heaven is a place of no sadness. Sometimes, a place with no sadness and always being happy sort of sounds wierd and fake if you know what i mean, but that is only because we as humans have gotten used to this broken world and dont know what true happiness is. Hell is like the opposite. There will be constant suffering and gnashing of teeth and will be unbearable. If someone accepts Jesus as thier savior and sins, they still go to heaven, because that is the exact reason Jesus died for us. To simplify it, God is perfect and he cannot be with people like us who are imperfect, but God loves us so much that he sent his Son Jesus so that he can take our place and face the consequences of sin by death on the cross. Therefore, we are able to go to heaven even if we do sin. Also, you may have already noticed, but almost all christians still sin. Hahaha, i have yet to see a christian who has not sinned. Lastly, the definition of sin is disobedience from God. Anything that you do that God does not want you to do is classified as sin. For example you may already know that murder is sin, but sin can also be as simple as just the thought of hate.|`|3KD6RRhPaa	Jesus made it pretty clear in John 3:3-5 in what we must believe in to enter heaven. He told us many times that if anyone rejects His water baptism by John the Baptist and His death on the Cross then you will not be going anywhere other than hell.<br>  <br>  No sinner can enter heaven but only the righteous. And this original gospel makes those who believe in it holy and righteous.<br>  <br>  So if someone accepts Jesus as their saviour with a distorted gospel, then that person not only mocks God but makes Him out to be a liar (1 John 5:6-11).  And sadly, many have already done so.|`|vA7Iq6FSaa	1. Those who believe that Jesus Christ died for their sins and believe that they are a saved person. <br>  <br>  2. Those who don't believe that Jesus Christ died for their sins and do not believe that they are a saved person.  <br>  <br>  3. Heaven is perfect, I have no idea what it will be like, its going to be completely different from earth though. Hell will be awful, because with the absence of God, there will be absolutely no order, plus you are in a pit of burning sulfur so....<br>  <br>  4. If someone accepts Jesus as their savior, they can die having an orgy with 40 people, and they will still go to heaven.  <br>  <br>  5. I have no idea what will happen when I get to heaven, and I don't care, I just trust that God has made the place pretty nice.  <br>  <br>  6. What do I consider a sin? It would be a sin to give you an answer, for who am I too judge? However, the Bible gives us the Ten Commandments and other clues, and from there we can form a guideline for what we think is and is not a sin.|`|9PA4f19gaa	Actually as a Christian I worship God the Father.  My faith in Jesus fills me with the Holy Spirit which will lead me away from sin.  God knows your heart and if you've really accepted His son as your savior. Your conscience will let you know when you've sinned.  The closer you are to God through reading His word the more you will recognize your sins.  Heaven is more than man can imagine.  Hell is worse than man can imagine.|`|ceebbd5b347bf3b3c44701e742d76f97aa	If you don't know, there is a very Good Book with all kinds of answers in it.... jk<br>  <br>  Ok... Heaven = close to God/ with God<br>  <br>  Heaven was described in the Bible, but my understanding is that it mostly poetic and symbolic. I think of heaven as just like earth, but where everything thats broken here actually works the way it was meant to in heaven. No tears. Nothing physical, so nothing breaks down or can be corrupted.<br>  <br>  Hell is being unmade. I don't think the Bible mentions hell as a place of torture. I think that concept came later. I would beleive God is all for concequences, but torture doesn't add up. If the threat of eternal punishment is supposed to be a deterant it doesn't seem to be working very well. I'm not sure I really understand all that being "unmade" entails, but I think it has to do with God's ability to wipe away all tears. Kinda above my pay grade. <br>  <br>  Believe and Receive ( Grace that is)<br>  <br>  Humans aren't perfect, but God loves us anyway because we are his creation. It's a "problem" of free will. God created us perfectly but gave us the choice to turn bad. Once we choose to be bad, by definition we are separate from God. God's law requires resistution to pay for sin. The problem is our sin, separates us from God... the punishment for that is to be unmade. <br>  <br>  So, enter Jesus. Because Jesus walked as a human and defeated temptation, he can intercede on our behalf to God, like a lawyer. Grace is God's forgiveness, free to everyone, but you have to be humble and ask for it. <br>  <br>  Even if you sin again and again, if you ask for forgivness, and mean it... God will forgive you again and again. That is what Christians mean when they talk about "God working salvation out in you".<br>  <br>  I think once you are heaven you are happy because you are with God, the source of all goodness.<br>  <br>  Oh, and Sin. The Bible is pretty clear on that one too. Here is my intrpetation. This is mostly the biggies. Don't be shy to read the original tho.<br>  <br>  Don't worship anything else besides God.<br>  Don't call on God for your vanity's sake.<br>  Take time to rest and reflect on God (Sabbath)<br>  Respect the correction of your elders<br>  Don't commit murder<br>  Don't commit adultery/ sexually immoral<br>  Don't be a thief<br>  Don't give a false testimony or report<br>  Don't give in to jealousy of things|`|y5DAfNtHaa	Religions are for people who are afraid to go to hell..

dhs9QBMoaa	I understand your point, but I'm always a little curious about the need for "evidence" in issues that involve the cosmos.  I'm still trying to wrap my head around cosmology.  From what I've heard, scientists came up with a formula that was supposed to give us a rough estimate of the mass of the universe.  When they applied the calculation to their observations and maps of the cosmos, they found that their formula only accounted for a tiny percent of the mass that they had expected.  They came up with a second formula, but still fell below what they believed they should have found.  To explain the missing mass, they proposed the notion of "dark matter" - mass that was out there, but that we haven't yet discovered or been able to detect.<br>    We accept the existance of dark matter today, though we have never experienced any sensory observation of it - whatever it is.  For some reason, it's okay to accept this phenomenon that we can't "prove", but we can't accept UFOs.  For the record, I believe that there probably is something to the idea of dark matter, and I believe that there is probably life elsewhere in the universe.  If this life is much older and more highly advanced than we are, then I suppose it is possible that they could come here and observe us and we'd probably never know it.  The truth is that there is a lot that we don't know about space.|`|155e47baf8efe28f58e95f4efe9cf546aa	No evidence? prove it there are thousands of cases some which could be tall tales or hallucinations but i believe a proportion are genuine cases . We have the cases of experienced pilots who are told to keep quiet about what there seeing in our skies are they all liars or fantasists ?. Yes there are some dodgy photos but also there are images which have been thoroughly checked by experts and passed. I think you should read books by Jacques Valle ( Inspired the character Lacombe played by Francois Truffaut in Close Encounters)  or Timothy Good  in my opinion the best research on the subject. UFO simply means a object or objects which can not be identified it could be  a strange natural phenomena or black project or maybe a craft belonging to a extraterrestrial intelligence or inter dimensional intelligence the theory being proposed by Valle a race called Fairies or Elves or Shining Ones by the ancients there are many similarities with them and close encounters today could be there have always been here and have been influencing mankind.

They are pendulums, and the heaviest is swung gently, and the experimenter observes the effect of that gentle swinging on the other pendulums. <br>  <br>  All the other pendulums start swinging, but the one most profoundly affected will be the one whose length is nearest to that of the heaviest pendulum. This is due to the wave phenomenon known as “resonance.” A wave force  has the greatest effect at its own wavelength  and at its own frequency.<br>  <br>  If a resonance effect can be induced upon the cells of a living being, it can be used to enhance or corrupt those cells’ performance.

For They are Life unto those that find Them, <br>  and Health to all their flesh.<br>  23. Keep thy heart with all diligence; <br>  for out of it are the issues of Life.<br>  24.

I call Heaven and Earth <br>  to record this day against you,<br>  that I have set before you Life and Death, <br>  Blessing and Cursing: therefore choose Life, <br>  That both thou and thy seed may live:<br>  20. That thou mayest love the LORD thy God, <br>  and that thou mayest obey His Voice, <br>  and that thou mayest cleave unto Him:<br>  for He is thy life, and the length of thy days:<br>  that thou mayest dwell in the Land <br>  which the LORD sware unto thy fathers,<br>  to Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob, to give them.<br>  <br>  The Bible God issues directives designed to preserve the lives of His faithful followers.<br>  This is His Gift to the Human race- the Knowledge of how we can enhance and preserve our lives.<br>  This is what GOD has given us. What does SATAN give to HIS followers?<br>  <br>    JOHN 8:42-53.<br>  <br>  42. Jesus said unto them, <br>  "If God were your Father, ye would love me: <br>  for I proceeded forth and came from God; <br>  neither came I of myself, but He sent me.<br>  43. "Why do ye not understand my speech? <br>  even because ye cannot hear my Word.<br>  44. "Ye are of your father The Devil, <br>  and the lusts of your father ye will do. <br>  He was a murderer From The Beginning, <br>  and abode not in The Truth,<br>  because there is no Truth in him. <br>  When he speaketh a lie, he speaketh of his own: <br>  for he is a liar, and the father of it.<br>  45. "And because I tell you The Truth, ye believe me not.<br>  46. "Which of you convinceth me of sin? <br>  And if I say The Truth, why do ye not believe me?<br>  47. "He that is of God heareth God's Words:<br>  ye therefore hear them not, because ye are not of God."<br>  48. Then answered the Jews, and said unto him, <br>  "Say we not well that thou art a Samaritan, <br>  and hast a Devil?"<br>  49. Jesus answered,<br>  "I have not a devil; but I honour my Father,<br>  and ye do dishonour me.<br>  50. And I seek not mine own glory:<br>  there is One that seeketh and judgeth.<br>  51. "Verily, verily, I say unto you,<br>  'IF A MAN KEEP MY SAYING,<br>  HE SHALL NEVER SEE DEATH.' "<br>  52. Then said the Jews unto him,<br>  "Now we know that thou hast a devil.<br>  Abraham is dead, and the Prophets;<br>  and thou sayest,<br>  'IF A MAN KEEP MY SAYING,<br>  HE SHALL NEVER TASTE OF DEATH.'<br>  53. "Art thou greater than our father Abraham,<br>  which is dead?<br>  and the Prophets are dead:<br>  whom makest thou thyself?"<br>  <br>  To the best of my Knowledge, Satanists know little or nothing about Life Enhancement.<br>  As a Pentecostal Christian, I have been required to examine testimonies of people who claimed to have met the Satan entity in person. For instance, DOREEN (From Witchcraft to Christ) IRVINE became Wiccan Queen of Witches for a year, because she met “Lucifer” in the presence of witnesses walking in fire. WILLIAM (Lucifer Dethroned) SCHNOEBELEN met Lucifer in an installation apparently in Planet Saturn- was returned to Earth like Kal-El of the comic books- the ground was burned where he landed. For all the extreme Knowledge these people gathered, they were NOT told THE TRUTH about life enhancement. Bill Schnoebelen was taught that he could gain life energy from young boys by sodomizing them. This is very important to know. If ageing men were brainwashed into thinking that THIS was THE ONLY WAY to renew their Life Force, it would account for the prevalence of the sick Satanic Ritual Abuse crime rings that keep being discovered|`|AA10589890	Satan is 'Adversary' in Hebrew. Literally, bad guy. <br>  <br>  A devil is an enemy, whether spirit or mankind. Not a good guy. Obstacles to development.

Usually in war the winner decides how the loser is portrayed so... Also since his name is Lucifer, something akin to bringer of light, it is generally agreed that it can be seen to mean bringer of knowledge, or the one who gave man knowledge. I personally like knowledge so I'm inclined to like him, but then again the Bible claims that part of the fall of man was, they became aware of themselves and their nakedness, or they got knowledge, and that was a bad thing. Anyway fortunately it's a story and a representation of ideas rather than fact, so it's pretty irrelevant.|`|lOZF75iWaa	Satan is the Accuser, an archangel I think. His role is that of truth.  "Is that true? Are you being true to yourself and others in this world? Show me, practice what you preach". An angelic challenge to develop and grow. Given the rampant hypocrisy in organised religion, he scared the life out of priests who made a living out of fear and lies. So, he was demonised instead of men facing their own evil.  Nifty little tool for the exploiters, easier to blame than facing yourself.|`|bMaa3bk2aa	Being brought up a Catholic, I know the history behind all this.<br>  [ill put it as simply and short as I can for you :D]<br>  Well, it started out as Lucifer being the MOST beautiful angel in heaven, and well, seeing as everyone liked him, he decided he was BETTER than God, so he went up to him and decided to just basically take control of Heaven.<br>  He was vain to just START with.<br>  God didn't like that, so he cast him out of Heaven.<br>  Lucifer brought a few people, they became his followers, and are most likely demons now.<br>  In the Bible, God says the earth is the Devil's home.<br>  It is.

Now when John had heard in the prison <br>  the Works of Christ, he sent two of his Disciples,<br>  3. And said unto him, <br>  "Art thou he that should come, <br>  or do we look for another?"<br>  4. Jesus answered and said unto them, <br>  "Go and shew John again those things <br>  which ye do hear and see:<br>  5. "The blind receive their sight, and the lame walk, <br>  the lepers are cleansed, and the deaf hear, <br>  the dead are raised up, <br>  and the Poor have The Gospel preached to them.<br>  6. "And blessed is he, <br>  whosoever shall not be offended in me."<br>  <br>  THIS IS THE WORK of Jesus, which is described thusly:<br>  <br>  ACTS 10:36-38.<br>  <br>  36. "The Word which God sent <br>  unto the Children of Israel, <br>  preaching Peace by Jesus Christ: (he is Lord of all:)<br>  37. "That word, I say, ye know, <br>  which was published throughout all Judaea, <br>  and began from Galilee, <br>  after the baptism which John preached;<br>  38. "How God anointed Jesus of Nazareth <br>  with the Holy Ghost and with Power:<br>  who went about doing good, and healing <br>  all that were oppressed of The Devil; <br>  for God was with him."<br>  <br>     1st JOHN 3:8.<br>  <br>  8. He that committeth sin is of the Devil; <br>  for the Devil sinneth From The Beginning.<br>  For this Purpose the Son of God was manifested, <br>  "That he might destroy The Works of The Devil."<br>  <br>  THE JEWS did not go about healing those who were oppressed by The Devil because THEY DID NOT CARE ONE WHIT about the oppressed. Even when they were THEIR OWN CHILDREN, they preferred to call JESUS to come and heal them FOr them, rather rthan seek God themselves. Therefore they were ALL unimpressed by Jesus' Healing every sort of "impossible" healing. Even raising the dead did not impress them. Does it impress YOU? No.<br>  <br>     MATTHEW 13:19.<br>  <br>  19. "When any one heareth The Word of The Kingdom, <br>  and Understandeth it not, then cometh The Wicked One,<br>  and catcheth away that which was sown in his heart.<br>  This is he which received seed by the Way Side."<br>  <br>     MARK 4:15.<br>  <br>  15. "And these are they by the Way Side,<br>  where The Word is sown; but when they have heard,<br>  Satan cometh immediately, and taketh away The Word <br>  that was sown in their hearts."<br>  <br>      LUKE 8:11-12.<br>  <br>  11. "Now the Parable is this: <br>  'The Seed is The Word of God.<br>  12. 'Those by the Way Side <br>  are they that hear; <br>  then cometh The Devil, <br>  and taketh away The Word <br>  out of their hearts, <br>  lest they should Believe and be saved.' "<br>  <br>  THE WORDS OF GOD feed us constantly, and how we utilize them determines our present-time condition. Our state of health is determined by whether or not and how thoroughly we assimilate the Word programming our health. If we are particularly stupid, the Devil species can remove as much of this Divine Word to impair our cellular integrity. Obviously, YOU were not born with some terrible painful ailment. OTHERS WERE. Satan, The Devil is responsible, our parents and their parents bear responsibility. WE bear responsiblity.<br>  <br>  GOD HAS GIVEN US THE MISSION TO SAVE THESE PEOPLE.<br>  If they are not eager to BE saved, I don't have to be concerned I am not believed! But when people say, "Satan's actually a Nice Guy...!" that is WAY out of line!<br>  <br>  WHAT did Satan ever do FOR YOU?<br>  When he told people how to pleasure themselves in defiance of God, HE WAS FEEDING OFF OF THEM AND KILLING THEM!<br>  If people do not care about this, and prefer to throw their lives down the Devil's Gullet, GOD TOO, is NOT all broken up about it, either.<br>  <br>  I have heard fools who did not KNOW whom they were talking about, nor to whom they were speaking say, "Jesus is BEGGING YOU to REPENT!" What INSANE drivel! As if Jesus has so little to offer, and is so LONELY, that he REALLY has to SCRAPE THE BOTTOM OF THE BARREL and PLEAD with the DREGS of Humanity, who PREFER DEATH, to come and live with HIM, PLEASE?<br>  <br>  The Kingdom of Heaven involves the hardest work a man ever did in his life. It involves WAR. No one can be FORCED to fight in this war. You either VOLUNTEER, or you are not wanted. The warriors who fight in this war should know going in, that THIS IS A THANKLESS JOB, and only those fighting alongside us will even TRY to appreciate what it is we do.<br>  <br>  EVERY EVIL THING SATAN HAS DONE ON EARTH, IT IS OUR JOB TO UNDO. So far, I have seen NO ONE willing to answer Jesus' call to arms. Even supposed Christians prefer to lay down and DIE than carry The Battle to The Devil. I like this line from LOST IN SPACE: "Never leave an Enemy stronghold intact!" <br>  <br>  Are there any of The Devil's diseases that Christians have shut down in 2,000 years, through their Faith? Of course not. there is all this confusion and mis-direction caused by the Devil and his minions.<br>  YOU would probably PREFER things this way, because YOU do not have some bedfast relative in a back room, whom you haven't the MONEY to treat, whose existence is virtually unknown by the outside world. Whom only YOU care about. <br>  <br>  THAT is the sort of life THE DEVIL has handed out to some people.|`|FmazIF6Maa	Satan means "adversary"... the idea that Satan is a specific entity comes entirely from Christians, and fairly later.<br>  <br>  In the Torah, there are devils and satans, there is no Devil, or Satan.<br>  <br>  The Bible barely mentions "The Devil" or anything about Satan. Most of the stories have been elaborated through fiction, like Milton's Paradise Lost. <br>  <br>  <br>  Some people look at the Abrahamic God, who kills children and innocent people when punishing the guilty, is egocentric and vain in the way he demands worship, etc., so they see the figure of Satan (either literally, or mythologically) as more of a hero who rebelled against a tyrant and has been unfairly punished and blamed for it.|`|921232792e8ae7c34c7818c953169f6caa	Sure?<br>  Look in the real world.<br>  Decode this lyrics " Knowing me knowing you"<br>  Trace it back in the TV news reels and in news prints on people, places and events in time.<br>  Luke 21.30-33<br>  With living examples on how Lucifer the great Satan alive himself in "All Blacks" being reincarnated from the Book of the Dead with oppression of "Alley Oop" and slavery as "The Chain gang" after checking into "Hotel California" in the East in idol worshipping the dead Mummy who was Mr.Look-see-here the dirty old man in "All Blacks" with self lack of knowledge and total loss of IQ in messing up and roughing up the head of someone else little children against the wall with blood all splattered red on his hands in hitting them all hard on the head with the Book of the Dead from someone else graveyards in nailing them all back into the coffin alive "Dying inside" in their youth like "Romeo and Juliet" at loss with the "Eternal Flame" to keep them burning alight in kicking the butts of God in not worshipping God  without being aware of it being expose in own backyards in time.<br>  Luke 6.39-40,41-45,46-49<br>  What do you think?|`|2vzj65Kfaa	Mythology is a wonderful thing, the stories, people, and cultures all influence each other over the centuries.<br>  <br>  Is Satan evil?  depends who you ask.<br>  <br>  In Christian mythology, it is an unequivical yes.<br>  <br>  There seems to be some evidence that points to Satan being derived from a pre-biblical entity known as "Shatim" roughly meaning "adversary" - kind of like a 'Devil's advocate' if you forgive the expression.<br>  <br>  This sort of relationship between Satan and God might be seen in the book of Job where Satan and God use Job in a sort of 'gentlemen's wager' to test the man's faith.<br>  <br>  Certainly, most modern interpretations of Satan protray him as a prince of lies - more than just an adversary, but a high trickster deity capable of turning men's hearths and minds with deception.<br>  <br>  A modern Satanist of the Levay ilk might tell you that there is no Satan, and they use the image of Satan as a representation of man's animal desires.|`|dFBccLExaa	I wouldn't be surprised if that's teh case.

I would suggest that if you're not drawing the anger and condemnation of your own community / church / class, you're simply not doing it.<br>  <br>  And I would ask one more question, for the contemporary world, where many of us in the west live isolated from people in need: How wide does the road have to be, before it's OK to walk by on the other side?<br>  <br>  Edit for Martie P: Well done.

There are so many products on the market to help your face from skin care products to cosmetics but nothing in a bottle will help your body so I think that..my man anyway...appreciates how hard I work to keep my body fit and I'm diligent about my skin care as well so I am happy with my whole look and so is he.

But if what your looking for is a way to concrete a loving relationship by sharing intimacy inside of holy matrimony, then being open and honest even about the things you dont like about yourself is important and therefore I would suggest that you don't hide them. However exercise and proper eating will help with the baby belly and there is a whole market out there for creams that will help with the stretch marks.<br>  <br>  Just a thought for your additional information-<br>  Well if he loves you and you love him, marry the guy!<br>  Your first husband was obviously a pathetic coward, and abuse was a good reason to leave him, however is he a good reason not to marry this guy who you love?<br>  Marriage does make things better having a GOOD father in the house has proven to help children (keep them out of jail, help them succeed) and if you are running the risk of having another child (Having sex) then you should consider that potential new child in your decision making.|`|XxSj6AsBaa	If you are in a married relationship, your husband will love you unconditionally.

It was not the ancestral religion of the Goths, which would have been some form of Indo-European paganism.|`|LjsRfaskaa	The emperor Constantine made an agreement with the Visigoths to sake Europe.

XsTJPMHqaa	Yes, you can.<br>  <br>  The process is RCIA, if you're not familiar with that already, and is available at your local Catholic Church. If anyone were to be rude to you about your pregnancy, then they need to get over it. What's happened in the past is done, but honestly, I doubt you'll get much 'flak' for it. Catholics love new converts, and love babies. True, when you get to your first confession you'll have to confess to pre-marital sex, but just think of that day when your baby is baptized by two Catholic parents, and led through life with two parents who are on the same page, spiritually.|`|f7fcb6877caa0ad4f41dd9af2258ee0aaa	Of course you can.  That has nothing to do with it.  Get in touch with your parish priest and arrange to get into an RCIA program, which will prepare you to become a member of the Church.

I am also praying for the well-being of your baby.<br>  <br>  The Catholic Church is definitely open to you.  If by some remote chance you encounter a priest who tells you otherwise - which I very much doubt,  please call the diocesan bishop in your area.

The Catholic Church has been around for almost 2000 years... it's not like this hasn't happened before. :0)<br>  <br>  Converting to Catholicism can be scary, and a little intimidating but Look, Catholics aren't stupid. The Church teaches that premarital sex is a grave sin...but it is also fully aware that people do it anyway. I mean it would be kind of hard not to NOTICE that in today's culture, don't you think?    You work in a pro-life ministry for a while, you are going to have seen it all.<br>  <br>  You will be embaressed, but Trust me, this will NOT be the first time the priest will have dealt with this. <br>  <br>  Good luck.... ...but stick with it, it will all pay off.|`|QE77Oxtqaa	Yes.<br>  A friend of mine did, and she had a two year old with the guy she married.
Ve18FAnGaa	"Battery" explained it well.  let me add; most Rastafarian will cut their dreads and facial hair but try to maintain the bound hair as an hommage to god and they will keep a form of cover over them while outside also as a form of respect.  <br>  To "Cassie T:"  though you've seen stereotypes of Rastafarian on tv, don't be fooled.  Jamacia has an extremely violent and nationalistic culture.  Violence and hatred are condoned in churches, public forums, and especially in the music. there, to be anything except a "normal Jamaican" could get you beat to death.  just last year a Jamaican born u.s. football star was hacked to death with a machete for being openly gay.  i am not trying to bash Rastafarian's.  Most Jamaican immigrants i've known have been good people, just like everyone else. but do not make the mistake of assuming that one culture is somehow particularly different then any other.  Rastafarian beliefs are rooted in Christian beliefs, and they are grappling with the same issues as any Abrahamic religion.|`|P7M7eco3aa	Rasta is not so much of a religion but a social movement, although religious beliefs are a part of the movement, that encompasses a strong African pride and African unity. The hair issue is one that is more rooted in both the religious and social aspects of Rasta. The hair is grown long to reflect the natural state of man and for the biblical reason stated above. Rastas were once held in disdain in Jamaica and the West Indies and wore their hair long out of recognition for each other. Many Rastas, in the early days, were forced by the communities to cut their hair often under the strong arm of local gangs. As far as Rastas being a "peaceful" people this has changed a bit as many Rastas are now involved in crime and have formed mafia type gangs.|`|57695d6cd2bdf46926c92c61db0be293aa	i was told thatthey cut there hair when a rasta dies.....<br>  i knew to kids who we fostered, one was a rasta kid, kinda, his mum followed i think through there dad.... he may of been, i think he died or something and the lad who was only young had his hair cut, i think his mother did it... spooky things happened in the house when there dad died.... not sure if that bit is related.|`|EpWvrL6Yaa	Because they dread the thought.|`|jBZJkSjWaa	...i have no idea at all.....|`|5tMCDu8gaa	You just stated the reason. Because their religion says so. And to people who are religious, apparently that's reason enough, even if it makes no sense.<br>  <br>  But you know what? I'm prepared to deal with that. 'Cause I don't hear of Rastas killing people. We have far more villainous religions to deal with right now.<br>  <br>  EDIT: Some religions are more important than others because some religions slaughter millions of people.<br>  <br>  You posted in a public forum. You asked for my opinion. Deal with it or don't post.
ZB9zkbxxaa	According to tradition (the Inca left no written records), the founder of the Incan dynasty led the tribe to Cuzco, which became their capital. Under the fourth emperor, they began to expand, and under the eighth they began a program of permanent conquest by establishing garrisons among the conquered peoples. Under Topa Inca Yupanqui and his successor, the empire reached its southernmost and northernmost extent. By the early 16th century the Inca controlled an empire of some 12 million subjects. They constructed a vast network of roads, their architecture was highly developed, and the remains of their irrigation systems, palaces, temples, and fortifications are still in evidence throughout the Andes. Incan society was highly stratified and featured an aristocratic bureaucracy. Their pantheon, worshiped in a highly organized state religion, included a sun god, a creator god, and a rain god. The Incan empire was overthrown in 1532 by the Spanish conquistadores, who made great use of the Incan road system during their conquests.|`|a6f5efb2cbade02a525b433574402dc8aa	<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inca_Empire#Expansion_and_consolidation" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inca_Empire...</a>|`|KOecCLjLaa	the usual way, through a lot of sex, and a few people at the top trying to control everything while everyone else struggled to stay alive

You read the Onion, don't you?  Remember when John Paul II died, they ran a newpaper article saying the greatest comedic genius of our time died.  Think about, the Catholic Church got aroud to admitting Galileo was right 500 years after he was killed.  How ridiculous, on the internet, a head of a Chruch can finally admit planets go around the sun and not the other way around.  That is so absurd, it is unintentially hilairious.  I guess in the year 3000, after Africa has been wiped of the face of the planet, they will admit that condoms are different from killing a living fetus, and thus allow it.  <br>  I think the good thing about Christianity is in a troubled time, Jesus came around and criticized everything the "religious" people were doing.  And made a lot of enemies.  And eventually got himself killed.  Were he to come back as before, I'm pretty sure he'd roll his eyes and  use the word "hypocrite" just as much as he does in the new testament.|`|dhs9QBMoaa	Your question asks if "overly" religious people scare me.  The answer to that is yes, because I believe that faith is a personal thing.  "Overly" religious people try to force their faith on others, which creates an awful mess - including the wars that you mention in your question.<br>  By the end of your question you've removed the word "overly", and claim that "religious" people scare you.  That I can't agree with because I've known plenty of people who maintain a faith, yet they've never tried to force their views on anyone.  They live their lives by their own moral and ethical codes (as per their faith), and simply try to coexist in this world of ours.<br>  Also try to remember that the faith itself isn't always the real reason behind conflict.  It's the excuse used by a person/group to justify their own political or material gains.  Faith is the most powerful force known to humanity.  If you can make people believe that they're serving their faith by following you, then you have an army of soldiers willing to give their lives at your command.  People will do anything for their faith.<br>  And one last thing.  The Vatican has covered up for some priests who've done some terrible things.  I won't deny that, nor should we accept it.  With that being said, which Pope molested young boys?  The Vatican is guilty of covering up, but I don't know of any specific cases of the Pope molesting anyone.|`|tcvQwTa5aa	I have read that love is God and God is love,basically.I am not involved in organized religion because there's too many of them and they all claim to be the correct and true religion.I gave up trying to figure it all out.There are many people who use God as an excuse for their undesirable behavior.And there are those who go around doing all manner of evil and then say,"I'll be forgiven."What they are really saying is God is some sort of fool who will forgive and let me get away with anything and I won't be held accountable for any of it.That is just disgusting.People can be so nuts,I swear,look what Hitler did!I am not afraid of religious people.I just choose to let them believe what they want and I go about my business.I would agree that the closer you are to love,the closer you are to God.I do not mean that as a religious sort of statement,either.|`|ueWVf6Y1aa	Drugs, murder, rape... that isn't God's doing. God created a perfect world, and man ruined it. We now have to live with it until we die and, if we are Believers, have eternal life with Jesus Christ.<br>  <br>  Satan, the doer of evil, is a fallen angel. God created angels but Satan wanted to be better than God and thus is now the Devil. Satan takes pleasure in your troubles.<br>  <br>  In the beginning, God created the heavens and the earth. And the earth was without form, and void; and darkness was upon the face of the deep. And the Spirit of God moved upon the face of the waters.<br>  <br>  For God so loved the world that he gave his only son so that whosoever believes in him shall have everlasting life.|`|zhaHc4FAaa	With all due respect, atheists do the same things that you have mentioned which have nothing to do with God.   Killing, murder, molestations are not of God.   There is good and bad in every single person, no matter what race, religion, age, or nationality.  Unfortunately, these people commit these horrible crimes under the guise of christianity...and they falsely represent Christ, but every single one of us has failed to represent Christ the way we ought to at some point in our lives.   I am a Christian and I have not lived a perfect life...I have let myself and other people down.

Obviously those are not all the religious people, but only the fanatic ones, and I hope that they are only a small part...<br>  <br>  Another thing that annoys me is the religious interference in politics that is more or less present in a lot of states (included in countries that theoretically are lay), for example, in my country the interference of the Catholic Church is very present :<br>  <br>  -No to euthanasia<br>  -No to artificial insemination<br>  -No to gay wedding or civil union<br>  -No to the stem cells<br>  <br>  Moreover it is fighting against the law on abortion...<br>  <br>  This is the problem to live in the state which gives hospitality to the Holy See -_-...<br>  <br>  However I have to say that a part of the fault is of politicians too in fact a lot of them are incompetent people who follow blindly the Pope rather than defense laicity...|`|LjsRfaskaa	I agree. Especially knowing that they do not even have any of their own festivals. All of them are plagiarized from us northern Celts. They could not convert us so they took our festivals as their own. All they did was substitute Jesus in stead of the Sun as the messiah, ie as per the Celtic Cross. The sun in the Cross constellation in the spring equinox. <br>  Christmas and the 25th dec is the birth of the new sun. After dying in the winter by dropping below the horizon, by the 25th dec, he is now just above the horizon again. <br>  We take our festivals back and practice the ancient truths in honesty, not hiding behind a false religion. :)<br>  <br>  Practicing Shaman... quantum physics rocks.

Obsession is sickness of mind,a warp and when a thought is given energy it becomes the word, the word spreads and the words soon becomes actions.  This is why you should be ever watchful of your thoughts and the need to control them.  It is even more important to control the words you speak, because without self discipline these words will become the most horrendous of deeds.<br>  In Buddhism they recognise this chain reaction, thus try to propogate ;<br>  <br>  Right thought, right speech and right actions<br>  <br>  To say that God told them to do it, is just self justification, it is not god talking but an over inflated ego.<br>  If for one minute they did listen to god talking the message will be of universal love - the language of the universe|`|0NOiAlJOaa	Because they are spiritually discerned, being ignorant of the Laws of God, they thrust aside law, ethics, morality and peace.

(The damned whore, Reason).<br>  <br>  "Reason is the Devil's greatest whore; by nature and manner of being she is a noxious whore; she is a prostitute, the Devil's appointed whore; whore eaten by scab and leprosy who ought to be trodden under foot and destroyed, she and her wisdom ... Throw dung in her face to make her ugly. She is and she ought to be drowned in baptism... She would deserve, the wretch, to be banished to the filthiest place in the house, to the closets."<br>  Martin Luther, Erlangen Edition v. 16, pp. 142-148<br>  <br>  "Reason is the greatest enemy that faith has; it never comes to the aid of spiritual things, but -- more frequently than not -- struggles against the divine Word, treating with contempt all that emanates from God."<br>  <br>  "Reason must be deluded, blinded, and destroyed. Faith must trample underfoot all reason, sense, and understanding, and whatever it sees must be put out of sight and ... know nothing but the word of God."<br>  <br>  "There is on earth among all dangers no more dangerous thing than a richly endowed and adroit reason... Reason must be deluded, blinded, and destroyed."<br>  Martin Luther, quoted by Walter Kaufmann, The Faith of a Heretic, (Garden City, NY, Doubleday, 1963), p. 75<br>  <br>  "Reason should be destroyed in all Christians."<br>  <br>  "Whoever wants to be a Christian should tear the eyes out of his Reason."<br>  <br>  "To be a Christian, you must "pluck out the eye of reason.""<br>  <br>  "People gave ear to an upstart astrologer [Copernicus] who strove to show that the earth revolves, not the heavens or the firmament, the sun and the moon. Whoever wishes to appear clever must devise some new system, which of all systems is of course the very best. This fool wishes to reverse the entire science of astronomy; but sacred scripture tells us [Joshua 10:13] that Joshua commanded the sun to stand still, and not the earth."<br>  Martin Luther, "Works," Volume 22, c. 1543<br>  <br>  "We know, on the authority of Moses, that longer than six thousand years the world did not exist."<br>  Martin Luther, "Lectures on Genesis"|`|zQyslfHKaa	Seems to me that the bible is pretty clear about defining the children of God by thier fruits.<br>  <br>  Martin Luthor wrote a book called 'On the Jews and thier Lies' -1543<br>  <br>  <br>  He was an INCREDIBLE antisemite, and also wrote against the poor.  <br>  <br>  That should pretty much destroy his 95 thesis alone.|`|64515c9dd3f1d42fce2093056b18e17aaa	saint.<br>  <br>  he's only a heretic because knowledge is a sin. lol.<br>  <br>  flamers should read about the man before posting nonsense.|`|pOP0Jt0Qaa	Human|`|64d4893f2b5ad37e1908f80ec7b0c4c2aa	Neither.

AA10543909	No, you should hire the best person for the job as there are advantages and disadvantages to both youth and age.  Again in terms of firing, you should get rid of the person who contributes least, regardless of age or any other factor.

zhaHc4FAaa	As a Catholic,  I do confess my sins to a priest...why because it's biblical.    Christ said confess your sins one to another...why?, because of the poison it leaves on the soul.   I feel like a weight has been lifted off of my shoulders when I tell someone...otherwise it just eats away at me.   There is healing that takes place when you openly admit fault....because there is a true repentance...a turning away so to speak....just like an alcoholic goes to AA the first step is to admit openly that he has a problem...why can't he do that in private...because he could stay in denial.....when we openly admit we have a problem...we are accepting accountability for our actions or behaviors.   We don't cover up, hide, or run away from our sin.    This is why confession is necessary.   <br>  <br>  Confessing to a priest is an open admission to your fault or guilt.   The priest acts as a spiritual counselor.   We confess all sorts of sins to paid counselors but when it comes to our spirituality we shriek and state that the priest is a mere human....sure he is human...but who better qualified about spiritual matters than a priest.   We pay big bucks to get counseling about our issues and we tell our whole life story to a person we know absolutely nothing about.   A priest is a person who just sits there and listens to you without passing judgement.   <br>  <br>  Honestly, what is the difference between anyone on R&S telling you to say the sinners prayer and telling you that God forgives you your sins.   This is exactly what a priest does.   He tells you that God forgives your sins and then asks you to say a prayer.   Absolutely no difference in the advice that other members would give you on here.<br>  <br>  <br>  No matter what you have done....God knows your heart and he knows  a truly repentant heart.    <br>  He loves you in spite of your failures and weaknesses.   <br>  <br>  On another note, if your child stole $50.00 from your parents...are you going to tell your child that he/she should go straight to God to deal with his/her sin....after all who are you to judge their sin or who are you to tell them that they need to apologize...isn't that the job of God?....see what I am saying.   You teach your children to apologize becasuse it shows a repentant heart.   You make them openly admit their fault to show by example.   Confessing your sins to a priest is the same way....we are all part of a flock and the priest is our shepherd.   When we stray away from God our father it is the shepherds job to help us find our way back to God.   God entrusted the priests to our spiritual care and so therefore we go to him for our spiritual needs and concerns.<br>  <br>  I hope this answers your question|`|JCjCllmraa	There are no such thing as sins, but you must understand that what ever you do in your life will have repercussions, whether they are helpful or hindering to yourself. Do what ever you like, as long as you would be satisfied with the results of your actions.<br>  <br>  Give someone a cookie if you would be happy with being without one.<br>  <br>  Murder someone if you feel it worthy of being imprisoned for the rest of your life for.<br>  <br>  Do what ever you like, but expect repercussions.|`|n1sxDwvgaa	Confessing sins to priests for forgiveness is unbiblical unless you have done something to that particular priest that requires restitution.  Jesus Christ went to the cross to bear the sins of the world " to all who would believe"  so that we may approach God's throne of grace in His name by His shed blood to ask forgiveness for ourselves.   There is no other way to be forgiven.|`|a9efAneVaa	I don't know what contrition is but I do know that no 'man' can forgive sin.  Only God can and Jesus IS the ONLY way to God.  I don't confess to anyone except God, through the Lord Jesus.  A priest is only 'man' and therefore does not have power over sin!|`|mFGyonmTaa	Say the word "contrition" 10 times real fast....|`|wxBFZ41Taa	Yes, the reason we have confession is that we can't experience perfect contrition. <br>  <br>  As for your follow up question - Jesus is the one who instituted the sacrament of confession. He is the one who gave the authority to forgive/not forgive sins to his Apostles. Ask yourself why Jesus would give an unnecessary authority? Obvious answer is "he wouldn't." Obviously this authority was important and still is. In order for the Apostles to forgive/not forgive sins...they would need to hear them first. This continues today in the successors of the Apostles, our ordained priesthood. Jesus continues to use his chosen earthly authority to absolve us of our sins, and help us come before Christ in humility and love.<br>  <br>  Your first question helps answer your follow up question. Going directly to God with our sins and asking for forgiveness would require us to have perfect contrition. We don't and can't. Therefore we need the sacrament of confession, and the absolution of sins through Christ's own chosen servants. If you go directly to God you must be perfectly contrite and absolutely never commit that sin again. <br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.scripturecatholic.com/confession.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.scripturecatholic.com/confess...</a><br>  <a href="http://matt1618.freeyellow.com/confess.html" rel="nofollow">http://matt1618.freeyellow.com/confess.h...</a><br>  <a href="http://www.catholic.com/library/Confession.asp" rel="nofollow">http://www.catholic.com/library/Confessi...</a><br>  <a href="http://www.orthodoxresearchinstitute.org/articles/liturgics/bassoline_confession_bible.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.orthodoxresearchinstitute.org...</a><br>  <br>  ADDED: To those who say "no man can forgive sins" -- why is it then that Christ gave "men" the authority to forgive sins? The Apostles most definitely could forgive sins and they were men. Their authority is passed on, in the Bible, to others to carry on the work of Christ. No where does the Bible indicate that the authority that Christ gave his Apostles died with them.<br>  <br>  ADDED: I found this and thought it was good:<br>  <br>  Really, only God knows whether what you have is perfect or imperfect contrition. I have heard that perfect contrition is quite rare, since one must be motivated solely out of love for God. Imperfect contrition is any mix of sorrow for love of God and fear of hell. At any rate, what really matters is that you are going to confession, and either perfect or imperfect contrition, when married with the sacrament of reconciliation, are sufficient to have your sins forgiven.

etcMARCAaa	It's the other way around.  West Africans were brought to work in the Caribbean during the colonial era (slaves), their religions mixed with Christianity and became Voodoo, Hoodoo, Obeah and several others.  The original West African belief was more of a shaman type thing and they got devils from the Christians.  Before they met Christians its was animalism and spirits mostly.  Even now they don't exactly worship the devil as a rule.  Some do and some don't.  The practitioners are like sorcerers who call on a spirit to power their charms.  Sometimes its demonic or diabolical but not always.  Obeah has traces of Christian belief or often more than traces but main stream Christian belief doesn't have traces of Obeah. Some Christian belief in the Caribbean Islands probably has some traces of Obeah.|`|tcvQwTa5aa	This is the reason why I am not involved in organized religion.There are soooo many religions and every one of them think that they are the correct one and all the rest are wrong.I decided to have faith in the idea of one God/Creator who created all things.You'll save yourself alot of grief if you don't listen to or agree with the people or ideas that cause you so much fear and worry.The mind is a powerful thing you know.Stop looking for the boogey man.No insult intended.Calm down,take care.|`|6f0e45a91719820a0d453b3ba6acce13aa	Wikipedia is flawed and incorrect.<br>  All the factsd of the Christian faith can be found in the Bible, and only the Bible is trustworthy.<br>  2 Tim. 3:16|`|fE4GBpmAaa	No. There can not be anyone who worships God cannot also worship the Devil.

DfDss68haa	Naw, as long as you don't pay attention to people who adher to the "tragic mulatto" stereotype. <a href="http://www.racialicious.com/2008/08/14/freakonomics-the-plight-of-mixed-race-children/" rel="nofollow">http://www.racialicious.com/2008/08/14/f...</a><br>  That idea is based on some belief created by slavery and segregation that blacks and whites are too different to breed so their children will be messed up physically and in the head. I was just a kid, any difficulties came from outside sources. There was racism but that was from people who saw me as black. Racism solely becuase I am biracial is rare. It might have been slightly harder to take becuase all that seperating me from the white people hating on me is one parent and not two.  I have heard of biracials going through identity crisis but it was never that bad for me. I am not EA (ethnically ambiqious) though, so I can't speak for them. I have always looked more black than white (or at least I have obvious African admixture which has always been pretty much the same thing in America). I have mostly white friends, I never felt accepted by most black kids but that is a nerdy problem not a biracial problem. I do have some black friends now. Overall my life growing up was not horrible (and certainly not becuase of race issues) My parents def. made some mistakes that I would hate to see you repeat though.<br>  <br>  1. If at all possible, do not send your kids to schools or places that are all one race. This is not good for any child really, everone needs to know how to get by in a multiracial world these days. But for a multiracial child it is doubly important becuase we are more than one race.<br>  <br>  2. Especially not if the school is primarily white. Chances are, your child will have a black phenotype and hair texture more so than a white phenotype. Perhaps the world has changed somewhat with President Obama's election but when I was a child I was seen as black. I am 21. I then identified as black becuase I looked black. But I went to a majority white school and was surrounded by people who didn't look like me. None of the white guys would date me, at the time this was very traumatizing at the time and I would hate to see your daughter/son go through that. But then again, it's different for mixed boys. Little white girls will go crazy for him. :-)<br>  <br>  3. Their hair. I hate to say it, but I have seen many white women walking around with mixed babies with some jacked up hair becuase the man does not get involved and the woman usually has straight hair herself and has no idea how to manage the hair. I have helped many parents of biracial kids though. Their hair does not need relaxers. <a href="http://biracialhair.org" rel="nofollow">http://biracialhair.org</a> is a good site. Also, I had a black mom but I have heard of biracial girls who grew up with white mom's who had some self esteem issues. <br>  <a href="http://nappyme.wordpress.com/afro-denial-and-ethono-ambiguo-hostility-syndrome-got-that/" rel="nofollow">http://nappyme.wordpress.com/afro-denial...</a><br>  It's bad enough for little black girls to be bombarded with images of white beauty everywhere but it can be doubly so when their mom is white. Every little girl wants to look like her mom. You can get past it though.<br>  <a href="http://www.afrobella.com/2008/11/23/a-doll-for-baby-z/" rel="nofollow">http://www.afrobella.com/2008/11/23/a-do...</a><br>  <br>  4. It is very important for kids to be surrounded by people with their phenotype or at the very least to be taught that there is nothing wrong with how they look. Look at the study that ended segregation where little black kids always picked the white doll. There are now some really great multiracial dolls. And movies and programs and neighborhoods. Try to let them know both sides of their family, I was never really accepted by my white dad's family but they are horrible people anyway so that's all for the best.<br>  <br>  5. In the end, though the best thing you can do is relax sometimes and let them just be a kid and give them love. Don't emphasize race. There will be people who will want to try to put them in the middle or say they got the worst of both "sides" but for the most part it didn't really touch me. Don't freak about it, there have been multiracial people for millions of years, though people like to pretend race mixing is some new invention. Going through identity issues or racism from others is pretty common. I went though it and I got through it fine and healthy and whole.<br>  <br>  7. Be prepared for the fact that they may identify as black for the reason I stated above, if they look black. I do not see this as rejecting your white side but it is important to make him proud to be biracial and proud to be black. The sad fact is that it won't be his white side attacked constantly but his black side. My dad never understood that, he wanted me to write white on applications. I don't look white or feel white though and it would just be silly. I respect my Italian heritage. Try to be supportive with the identity they may choose and realize that it isn't about them hating you or being ashamed of you.|`|DGqeGQoIaa	my son is mixed,and i just try to teach him about both races.and also teach him to treat all people respectfully and if someone says something he doesn't like to ignore them because they are ignorant and have no understanding.so far he hasn't had to deal with any negativity.but he has friends and family of both races and is accepted well.hope this helps.|`|vAdtlZDpaa	I think it is always difficult growing up different from the norm - whatever the norm is. However, interracial families are much more accepted now than they were just 20 years ago. Look at our new president! <br>  <br>  I know lots of interracial families, and the kids seem no worse or better off than children from same race families. I think that proactaive parenting and having a supportive family and community are really the most important influences in a kids a life. So, for example, having racist grandparents could make it more difficult for kids than not having racist grandparents!|`|LklBuVAXaa	My kids are mixed (white/black).  Anyways, I can't actually speak for them but it appears to me that they are accepted by everyone.  I found the most problems came from the parents of mixed children.  As far as upbringing and parenting styles.<br>  <br>  My wife was raised with time outs and going to your room.  I was raised with spankings.  So being too liberal and being too stern were major issues.|`|GPznIhzMaa	I have a few mixed cousins and friends. They seem to have less of an identity struggle than I did growing up as a pure-blood Chinese-American. They're accepted by peers of both races. They have that exotic look that grabs attention and curiosity. Just make sure to teach your kids to embrace both cultures.|`|Dv5HiSSraa	Just go with your heart. You KNOW what's the right thing to do.|`|TAGsuqu2aa	It isn't difficult in my community since it is so diverse here. Many different ethnicity's, it's a small melting pot. My nephew and niece are half African American and they are doing well as would any other children would in our community. It would be a little more different if we were to be living in the East side of our city because in those areas it is more rural and predominately full of Caucasians, many who aren't as open minded as people who were raised in our community. I feel country folks aren't used to sharing or living around different folks as people in the city would. Territorial, or they were just raised that way, who knows.|`|lgoz4bxfaa	How is it tough? Who told you that?<br>  <br>  They are acting like mixed kids are some alien from out of space. <br>  <br>  My mother (who is black) married a white man and they had kids (my younger siblings) and they are raising them normally like any other kid.|`|IxLkAEA3aa	just look at mariah carey... shes mixed and perfectly fine... obama is too...|`|HzjeKsDJaa	no its easy. as long as you are supportive parents|`|So1ROzM4aa	I am mixed race and never felt any conflict or inner turmoil, I love my looks and skin tone. My kids are also mixed and we did have a bit of a blip when we moved from London (which is really mulicultural) to Northampton (Which is really white lol) and my daughter was saying she just wanted to be like her friends but I think if she'd have been ginger or worn glasses that would have been the case. I think when kids are in any way different they want to conform but when they're older they appreciate that their differences are what make them unique and stand out from the crowd. If you do have kids, just tell them you love them every day and if doubts do creep in, remind them of how beautiful they are!<br>  <br>  BTW: Don't worry about your parent's views. Mine were similar until they met their new granddaughter. Now my girls are the apples of their eyes! My Dad loves taking them out and always says 'I wait for the day when someone says someting negative about them, there will be blood!' Quite funny and heartwarming really. I think having kids of mixed race is the best cure for generational racism there is!|`|jYwSKzg1aa	I'm a parent, auntie, cousin and friend of mixed kids.  The level of acceptance for your relationship does still depend on where you live, though things are much more reasonable now than a few decades ago.<br>  <br>  The good thing is that most people in most places embrace mixed kids as the beautiful people they are.  Some folks in the older generations still tend to hold out and stare/comment, but remember -- the rude old farts will be gone soon anyway, and you'll love your kids so much they'll never even notice.<br>  <br>  The challenge for raising mixed kids tends to come from a different direction these days.  People are excited and openly curious.  Take a single-race kid out in public, and people say "Aw, how cute!" or just smile.  Take your mixed kid out and people stop you to look at the beautiful child and ask a million questions.  "Does he speak Spanish/Chinese/Farsi (your husband's language)?"  "What do your in-laws think?"  "Which race do you think she looks more like?"  You'll get a lot of specific advice from folks of your hubby's race as well.  How to make certain special foods.  How to celebrate holidays.  As a white mom of a black/white child, you can expect advice on taking care of your little one's biracial hair.  Graciously answer what questions you can and gratefully accept the advice.  It will be easy to ignore the few rude ones who have comments.<br>  <br>  Your children will grow up accepted and loved because this modern society will accept them and you will love them.  The color lines have never been more blurred than they are now, and it's only going to get better.<br>  <br>  In your parents' minds, they have a valid concern trying to keep you and your family from being hurt.  But even if your parents are holdouts now, that will all disappear the first time they hold their first grandchild.  Don't worry about it.

If you're asking whether you can get in trouble with the government for clicking on the "I'm 18" box when you're really not, the answer is no. That box is there so the site can protect itself from lawsuits. THEY'RE not legally allowed to provide you with porn, but YOU can't be charged for simply looking at it.<br>  <br>  It's perfectly natural and normal for a guy your age to be interested in porn.

She knows her stuff in the bible. I on the otherhand, can see past the horizon, realize that sure there's a lot of stuff out there, but we are human, we make mistakes and God loves us anyway.

OK, that is not completely true. I am not an atheist. I am not a believer. I am not an agnostic. I am none of these because the answer to g-d's existence is unimportant.<br>  <br>  I am what I am and what I am needs no excuses!<br>  <br>  People ask what would convince me that g-d truly exists. While I am not sure, I am certainly open to any tangible evidence. What evidence would convince you that g-d does not exist? Do you see the conundrum?<br>  <br>  Bible passages are not evidence of g-d's existence to me. This is my standard of proof, not yours. However, if proof were proffered that convinced me g-d exists, I would change absolutely nothing in my life or my behavior. Existence or not of g-d does not matter.<br>  <br>  What if evidence were produced that convinced you g-d does not exist with certainty (evidence according to your standards of proof)? What would you change in your life?<br>  <br>  - Would you stop evangelizing?<br>  - Would you start sinning more?<br>  - Would you run amok?<br>  - Would you stop helping those less fortunate than you?<br>  - Would you feel that life is meaningless?<br>  - Would you lose your Raison d'être?<br>  <br>  Atheists such as myself have real moral values perform mitzvahs not for the sake of salvation, but because moral codes and performing good deeds and helping those in need is the right thing to do. <br>  <br>  Many (not all!) people choose Christianity for the reward of salvation or to avoid the punishment of hell. That's known as Pascal's wager. I don't consider these folks Christian or religious at all. To me, a true Christian would accept Christ without regard to salvation, would not crow about being saved, would not condemn others, and would even take that John 3:16 oath of allegiance knowing that g-d might hypothetically punish them.|`|9q95w6vyaa	Who says I don't have faith?

Also, Christians in general have recognized the overall benefit from just having a time where people attempt to treat each other nicer and have adopted the celebration at times.<br>  <br>  Also, the majority of the United States was Christian of one form or another for the most part, as is evident from may things in our government in general and so it is common for most people to celebrate.|`|9dNPN9CSaa	The sheer joy of being saved from eternal conscious torment -(Matthew 13 & Revelation 20) <br>  <br>  We can only be by the grace of God, thru faith in the atoning sacrifice of Christ - (John 3, John 14:6, Acts 4:12, Romans 3 & 10, etc)<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.BibleGateway.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.BibleGateway.com</a><br>  <br>  All the signs that the Bible forecast show that Jesus is coming back soon - see especially Matthew 24 'birthpains'<br>  <br>  Get ready<br>  <br>  Don't miss the instant airlift Rapture rescue of all who love Jesus, before the worst time ever comes - Matthew 24:30-42 & 1 Thessalonians 4:13-5:11 etc<br>  <br>  Don't be LEFT BEHIND - google it - to face Revelation 6, 8, 9 & 16-19<br>  <br>  Must go|`|sowS7KW2aa	christmas is the birth of our lord Jesus Christ, and  Jesus , he is the one who saves the sins of the world|`|35ccc8ce58bda98ad049f1093b5a126aaa	Because the early Christians hijacked a Pagan midwinter festival.|`|05c303357af20eb836625946a34349b2aa	It's a nice wee mid winter break between halloween and oister.|`|9xgGd9praa	Because mass consumerism says so.|`|1bb29480284b74b7e53f51936d85c768aa	birth of christ|`|58e95a5bcb9b3b1cb28831601a8bb259aa	Some people made up a story about Jesus and all the holy people.

ZtzKsVjdaa	I HATE that so much!  My friend has the same issue.  She is constantly texting when we're together.  Here's what I did.  I told her it bugged me (politely of course).  Explain to her that it's extremely rude and insulting and tell her that it's as if she values the other person more or something along the lines of that.  Tell her that she should have hung out with the other person if she can't handle being off the phone and away from them.  If she doesn't accept it, next time, just text or call her while she's on the phone and say, "I guess this is the only way to get your attention."  Then get up and walk away, leaving her to the phone she values oh so much.  Refuse to speak to her unless she is willing to give you the common courtesy of not using the phone when in the presence of others!  If you're together and she whips that thing it, just walk away and talk to someone else.|`|8OREBeRdaa	Don't toss the friendship but do let them know that you don't appreciate it.  You could always make a bet out of it that they can't go through an evening hanging out with you without being on their phone. <br>  <br>  I honestly hate that crap.  If it happens another time, I would not hang out with that person until they got the hint.|`|bfc067ab537555ada57edd464a8dfb97aa	My daughter does that but she knows it annoys me so unless I am part of the conversation or its an emergency she makes her talks very short<br>  .btw that person you are talking about is NOT your friend and you need to make new friends who aren't wired to their cell phone.|`|RWgjnwl9aa	Friendship is a 2 way street I would tell her the truth about her being on the phone when you both are out maybe she doesn't realize it but a good friendship also needs boundaries & respect for each other so you have a choice tell her or put up with her rudeness|`|y0iXEYkvaa	I had a friend like that. Emphasizing the had lol. She was always texting and talking on her phone. Just like you I was very bored. So I decided to tell her and she got mad. She said I don't say anything when you text,blah,blah...Anyways she was selfish in more ways than that for example I always had to go to her house,she came to mine a total of 2 times. I always had to call her first before she called me or she would text and say are you mad at me cuz you haven't called. She moved right down the road from me with some man I never heard her talk about and she didn't tell me. I called her one day right after she drove past me and I was gonna ask her did she want to come over since she was in the area and she said she said she was  just going home. I was like home when did you move and she said 2 months ago. Well that pretty much ended it for me.So to me when someone is that selfish there is more than just the phone issue usually. I would definitely examine the whole relationship not just the phone issue hon.|`|PhIpfgRvaa	no dont drop the friendship cause can be really good mates if you didnt have the interuptions all the time xx maybe get someone to ring you next time you are out and let her see how much it is annoying and maybe she will understand a little more then what you have told her xx some people need to be shown rather then told xx hope this helps xx and remember im you let go off a friend then it is harder to find another as good as the one you had xx|`|AA10205447	Some people just don't get how rude it is to talk on a cell phone when its not needed.

Your church bulletin should explain the rules of fasting and abstinence.|`|pCLC481qaa	I am not Catholic. But it seems you are suppose to leave it on your forehead<br>  <br>  In the Western Christian calendar, Ash Wednesday is the first day of Lent and occurs forty-six days before Easter. It falls on a different date each year, because it is dependent on the date of Easter; it can occur as early as February 4 or as late as March 10.<br>  <br>  Ash Wednesday gets its name from the practice of placing ashes on the foreheads of the faithful as a sign of repentance. The ashes used are gathered after the Palm Crosses from the previous year's Palm Sunday are burned. In the liturgical practice of some churches, the ashes are mixed with the Oil of the Catechumens[1] (one of the sacred oils used to anoint those about to be baptized), though some churches use ordinary oil. This paste is used by the priest who presides at the service to make the sign of the cross, first upon his own forehead and then on each of those present who kneel before him at the altar rail. As he does so, he recites the words: "Remember (O man) that you are dust, and to dust you shall return."|`|N89HLv92aa	Dont eat meat on Ash Wends.  You are allowed one meal and two snacks.

If you live in a residential neighborhood that has a homeowners association, give them a call and let them know (anonymously) that you think your neighbor has a violation.<br>  The person in charge of the organization will do a drive by and if your concerns are valid, they will leave a note on their door without saying who called it or reported them.<br>  You're right, unsightly properties affect the entire neighborhood, and if there are legitimate reasons for the authorities to be called, this can also be done nameless and takes little time or effort on your part. <br>  Hope this helps!|`|WneD1JMRaa	I cant stand sloppy neighbors!

iPNOVR6Gaa	Yes.  As you may know, when countries are at war or in rivalries with each other, they ascribe all manner of negative personality traits to their enemies.  Centuries ago, when the British were fighting the Dutch for naval superiority, one of the things they said about the Dutch people was that they were cheap.  Although it's not considered a negative term now, "going Dutch" started off as an insult to the Dutch people.

First, I'm sure you're a great person and only want the best for him and yourself.  But, what if you guys do wind up falling in love?  Then there will be problems with the wedding.  Your parents may want a church wedding, or you might want one yourself.  He will feel pressured and uncomfortable, even though you may have little or nothing to do with it.  Remember, when you get married (or in a serious relationship) you wind up with the whole family, not just the person.  He really is protecting you and himself from more psychological harm, not to mention the future happiness of his yet-to-be-born children.  <br>  <br>  I say move on and find yourself a great guy who has the same religous beliefs as you do.

He is trying to protect himself. If you are someone who values church, especially over relationships (like compromising), it can create riffs in the future, regarding everything, from sexuality to raising a family and jobs. I'm not saying that's the kind of person you are, but I can relate to him. I won't date anyone who is a Christian because my beliefs are that certain religions hurt more than they help and I cannot reconcile that belief. I have it this way because of the prospects of marriage (religious ceremony? sex before marriage?), how to raise children (in a church? without religion? gender roles?), and how I am- a bit selfish, but down to earth and a die-hard realist. The difference can cause riffs that do break up marriages and relationships- when the religious partner does not see a problem with their religion whereas their partner does- and the pain can be awful, so I can see where he is coming from. It's a lot harder to get out of a relationship with someone you've grown to love and created a family with yet cannot live with rather than someone you don't know very well.|`|c64d6c7caaa6ff5455c25c84c0d7cbc8aa	What you believe is what makes you.If you get married youll start understanding.|`|a3ffZgRsaa	Develop common sense and realize that religion doesnt really answer anything
zQyslfHKaa	The standard is found in evolving human empathy.<br>  <br>  Believers like to claim that there is a higher moral code that God creates, completely ignoring his specific code written in the old testament.  Clearly we can read it now and recognize that stoning a rape victim is wrong, or that slaughtering an entire race of people because they worshiped a different God is morally wrong.<br>  <br>  However believers like to pretend that thier God didn't do those things or order those things, or that he isn't planning on torturing a majority of mankind for eternity like he said he would.<br>  <br>  That shows us that morality, is not infact a absolute from God, but in reality an evolving thing that humanity has been developing for thousands of years.<br>  <br>  Morality is NOT absolute, however, we as a species have done pretty good in forewarding what it means to be moral since biblical times, and even over the last 100 years.<br>  <br>  100 years ago racism was not only accepted but encouraged, but believers and non believers alike.  Now we see it as morally wrong.  Thats moral progress.<br>  <br>  Christians specifically cannot agree, because Jesus predicts that the world will morally regress, so instead of seeing the increased tolerance, democracy, reduced casualties in war, lawful society and increase in burocratic solution to conflict as a sign of progress, they look at homosexuals and claim a moral decline, its simply dishonesty, caused by expectation and hope in jesus.|`|GJS3hTK5aa	Jesus said "Love others like you love yourself".

Religion after all in it's essence is only a prescription to a better way of life a guidance system for heart and character replete with motivation. It's just not obvious as progressive as it should be and it's doctors or priests and preachers need higher standards in method and scrutiny to keep up with civilization. for instance when looking for a clergyman of one choice it should be publicized whether they have a degree in psychology ,credentials in comparative religion and religious history . far too many unqualified bible thumpers out there.|`|02QPXoS5aa	No, religion is not the real root of all evil.  The root of all evil is Satan/devil.  The devil is the one who wants to kill and destroy people and their lives.  He has many tools he uses on all of us, all of the time.  Some of his tools are temptation and trickery, lying, cheating.  Everything he does is contrary to the Bible and God.  Do not be a follower of the devil.  Go to a good bible based church and go to Sunday school.

When you let religion/morality become an excuse to vent your judgmental attitudes, then yes.<br>  <br>  Most religions are about morality and tradition.  When you throw that out, and just start brainwashing people to say or do things that are counter to morality and basic human decency, then you can make stupid things happen. <br>  <br>  Example:<br>  <br>  Religion says "All people are God's children.  Love them all equally. It is reserved for God to judge."  <br>  <br>  Then some nut dressed as a deacon or priest says "No, you can't love these people because they're gay, or those people because they haven't tithed enough, or those because, because, because..."<br>  <br>  End of example.|`|3KD6RRhPaa	Yes, absolutely for it was created by man seeking after some god to serve.<br>  <br>  One must NEVER think Christianity in its pure form belongs to religion, for it comes from heaven.|`|Wn64Oxxyaa	Absolutely the best tool to perpetrate evil on the planet.|`|sJegUB11aa	No.<br>  Selfishness and territorialism are the roots of all evil.|`|XS3PexPIaa	Greed for power is!

But I also think it's pride.  There are evil people in religion no doubt.  But there are equally non-religious people who are evil.  So what group can call themselves any less evil than another group?  This begs the question, is man inheritantly good or inheritantly evil?  If man has evil intent, what can save man?  If man is inheritantly good, why isn't our society improving?<br>  <br>  But at this time, I think the love of money is the root of all evil.  Look at our econcomy.  Madoff, Stanford, Thain, just to name a few recent names.  Swiss bank account with thousands of tax evading accounts.  Where do I stop.<br>  <br>  If you want religion to be the root of all evil, put on some red shoes, close your eyes, click your heels three times, and do your chant.<br>  <br>  Sorry for the sarcasm.  It's late.  And it gets tiresome seeing people wanting to blame anything else, especially something easy like religion, for the problems of the world, instead of pointing the finger at themselves.  Unless you're not blaming religion.  Then my sincerest apologies.  Hope you get a good answer.  I've finally reached 250 points, and can finally star people with good answers.<br>  <br>  By the way, do you also see the intent of the people?  Seriously, what's the percentage of good answers one receives?  It's very low.  If people are inherantly good, then why aren't there more answers to spur one another on toward good deeds and spirits?  Something to ponder about.|`|doOoIKK9aa	No many things besides religion cause evil things to happen like money, resources, anger, hate, jealousy, mental illnesses, unbalanced prosperity in the world etc..

SZdVYrSSaa	I've done it. I won best supporting actor at the Dubai Film Festival a few years back when I first started acting, and I threw in a line about how I thought it was unfortunate that a place like Dubai could have such an amazing convention of artistic talent but refuse to let their own children express or even talk about sexual and artistic diversity. <br>  <br>  I think it was a perfectly well made speech, and very tasteful in the choice of words and timing spent on Prop-8 talk. Humor, Humility, Pride, Politics, and Slightly-Less-Than-Genuine Spotlight-Sharing... the very components that make Hollywood such an interesting community. I mean, everyone else on the planet talks about American politics, why shouldn't a well-educated, award winning, and elegant actor be allowed to speak his mind? I really think the stigma that actors shouldn't mix with politics is a little overblown, a large number of the people nominated in that room hold master's or doctoral degrees in Literature, History, and Psychology, and often have contributed more money and support to some rights and special needs groups than most of our administration and congressmen.<br>  <br>  Well done, Sean|`|3YzXWHwbaa	I think he didn't harp on it and his movie was about the same general subject so it seemed to be appropriate.<br>  The political presidential statement was more out of place than the prop 8 statement.

f8dz0ffFaa	The following are only some of the traditions about Imam al-Mahdi which Sunnis admit to their authenticity and existence: <br>  <br>  The Prophet (PBUH&HF) said: "Even if the entire duration of the world's existence has already been exhausted and only one day is left (before the day of judgment), Allah will expand that day to such a length of time, as to accommodate the kingdom of a person from my Ahlul-Bayt who will be called by my name. He will fill out the earth with peace and justice as it will have been full of injustice and tyranny (by then)." <br>  Sunni References: <br>  <br>  Sahih al-Tirmidhi, v2, p86, v9, pp 74-75 <br>  Sunan Abu Dawud, v2, p7 <br>  Musnad Ahmad Ibn Hanbal, v1, pp 84,376; V3, p63 <br>  al-Mustadrak ala al-Sahihayn, by al-Hakim, v4, p557 <br>  Jami' al-Saghir, by al-Suyuti, pp 2,160 <br>  al-Urful Wardi, by al-Suyuti, p2 <br>  al-Majma', by al-Tabarani, p217 <br>  Tahdhib al-Tahdhib, by Ibn Hajar al-Asqalani, v9, p144 <br>  Fat'h al-Bari fi Sharh Sahih al-Bukhari, by Ibn Hajar Asqalani, v7, p305 <br>  al-Sawa'iq al-Muhriqah, by Ibn Hajar al-Haythami, Ch. 11, section 1, p249 <br>  al-Tathkirah, by al-Qurtubi, p617 <br>  al-Hawi, by al-Suyuti, v2, pp 165-166 <br>  Sharh al-Mawahib al-Ladunniyyah, by al-Zurqani, v5, p348 <br>  Fat'h al-Mugheeth, by al-Sakhawi, v3, p41 <br>  Kanz al-Ummal, v7 P186 <br>  Iqd al-Durar Fi Akhbar al-Mahdi al-Muntadhar, v12, Ch. 1, <br>  al-Bayan fi Akhbar Sahib al-Zaman, By Ganji al-Shafi'i, Ch. 12 <br>  al-Fusool al-Muhimmah, by Ibn Sabbagh al-Maliki, Ch. 12 <br>  Arjahul Matalib, by Ubaidallah Hindi al-Hanafi, p380 <br>  Muqaddimah, by Ibn Khaldoon, p266 <br>  and also in the works of Ibn Habban, Abu Nua'ym, Ibn Asakir, etc. <br>  Also: <br>  <br>  The Prophet (PBUH&HF) said: "al-Mahdi is one of us, the members of the household (Ahlul-Bayt)." <br>  Sunni reference: Sunan Ibn Majah, v2, Tradition #4085 <br>  <br>  It is evident from the above traditions that Imam al-Mahdi (AS) is from the Ahlul-Bayt of Prophet Muhammad, so he can not be Jesus (the Messiah; al-Maseeh). Thus, al-Mahdi and Messiah are two different personalities but they come at the same time, al-Mahdi as Imam and Jesus as his follower. The following tradition clearly mentions that Imam al-Mahdi is one of descendants of the daughter of Prophet Muhammad (PBUH&HF): <br>  <br>  The Prophet (PBUH&HF) said: The Mahdi will be of my family, of the descendants of Fatimah (the Prophet's daughter). <br>  : | | . | : : ||<br>  4_o_D |_9 ]_| q . _o _, _,_c . _o ]_8_o_||<br>  / (_) (_S / (_) (_S <br>  <br>  Sunni references: <br>  <br>  Sunan Abu Dawud, English version, Ch. 36, Tradition #4271 (narrated by Umm Salama, the wife of the Prophet) <br>  Sunan Ibn Majah, v2, Tradition #4086 <br>  al-Nisa'i and al-Bayhaqi, and others as quoted in: <br>  al-Sawa'iq al-Muhriqah, by Ibn Hajar al-Haythami, Ch. 11, section 1, p249 <br>  Also: <br>  <br>  The Prophet (PBUH&HF) said: "We the children of Abd al-Muttalib are the Masters of the inhabitants of the heaven: Myself, Hamza (RA), Ali (AS), Ja'far Ibn Abi Talib (RA), al-Hasan (AS), al-Husain (AS), and al-Mahdi (AS)." <br>  Sunni references: <br>  <br>  Sunan Ibn Majah, v2, Tradition #4087 <br>  al-Mustadrak, by al-Hakim, on the authority of Anas Ibn Malik <br>  al-Daylami <br>  al-Sawa'iq al-Muhriqah, by Ibn Hajar al-Haythami, Ch. 11, section 1, p245 <br>  The Prophet (PBUH&HF) said: "The Mahdi will appear in my Ummah.

He is one of the signs of the Hour. Among these ahaadeeth are the following:<br>  <br>  1. Abu Sa’eed al-Khudri reported that the Messenger of Allaah (Peace & Blessings of Allaah be upon Him) said: "At the end of the time of my ummah, the Mahdi will appear. Allaah will grant him rain, the earth will bring forth its fruits, he will give a lot of money, cattle will increase and the ummah will become great. He will rule for seven or eight years. (Mustadrak al-Haakim, 4/557-558; he said: this is a hadeeth whose isnaad is saheeh, although it was not reported by al-Bukhaari and Muslim. Al-Dhahabi agreed with him, and al-Albaani said: this is a saheeh sanad, and its men are thiqaat (trustworthy), Silsilat al-ahaadeeth al-saheehah, vol. 2, p. 336, hadeeth 771)<br>  <br>  2. ‘Ali (may Allaah be pleased with him) said: "The Messenger of Allaah (Peace & Blessings of Allaah be upon Him) said: ‘The Mahdi is one of us, a member of my family. Allaah will guide him in a single night.’" (Musnad Ahmad, 2/58, hadeeth 645, edited by Ahmad al-Shaakir, who said: its isnaad is saheeh; Sunan Ibn Maajah, 2/1367. This hadeeth was also classed as saheeh by al-Albaani in Saheeh al-Jaami’ al-Sagheer, 6735). Ibn Katheer said: "This means that Allaah will forgive him, grant him help, inspire him and guide him, when he was not like this before." (Al-Nihaayah, al-Fitan wa’l-Malaahim, 1/29; edited by Taha Zayni).<br>  <br>  3. Abu Sa’eed al-Khudri said: "The Messenger of Allaah (Peace & Blessings of Allaah be upon Him) said: ‘The Mahdi is of my lineage, with a high forehead and a long, thin, curved nose. He will fill the earth with fairness and justice as it was filled with oppression and injustice, and he will rule for seven years.’" (Sunan Abi Dawud, Kitaab al-Mahdi, 11/375, hadeeth 4265; Mustadrak al-Haakim, 4/557; he said: this is a saheeh hadeeth according to the conditions of Muslim, although it was not reported by al-Bukhaari and Muslim. See also Saheeh al-Jaami, 6736).<br>  <br>  4. Umm Salamah said: "I heard the Messenger of Allaah (Peace & Blessings of Allaah be upon Him) say: ‘The Mahdi is of my lineage and family, from the descendants of Faatimah.’" (Sunan Abu Dawud, 11/373; Sunan Ibn Maajah. 2/1368. Al-Albaani said that it is saheeh in Saheeh al-Jaami, 6734)<br>  <br>  5. Jaabir (may Allaah be pleased with him) said: "The Messenger of Allaah (Peace & Blessings of Allaah be upon Him) said: ‘‘Eesaa ibn Maryam will descend, and their leader the Mahdi will say, "Come and lead us in prayer," but he will say, "No, one of them should lead them as an honour to this ummah from Allaah."’" The version narrated by Muslim says: "… Then ‘Eesaa ibn Maryam (Peace be upon him) will descend and their leader will say, ‘Come and lead us in prayer,’ but he will say, ‘No, some of you are leaders over others as an honour from Allaah to this ummah.’" (Reported by Muslim, 225)<br>  <br>  6. Abu Sa’eed al-Khudri (may Allaah be pleased with him) said: "The Messenger of Allaah (Peace & Blessings of Allaah be upon Him) said: "He is one of us, behind whom ‘Eesaa ibn Maryam will pray." (Reported by Abi Na’eem in Akhbaar al-Mahdi. Al-Albaani said it is saheeh; see al-Jaami’ al-Sagheer, 5/219, hadeeth 5796).<br>  <br>  7. ‘Abdullaah ibn Mas’ood reported that the Prophet (Peace & Blessings of Allaah be upon Him) said: "The world will not come to an end until the Arabs are ruled by a man from my family whose name will be the same as mine." (Musnad Ahmad, 5/199, hadeeth 3573. Another version says: "… whose name is the same as mine and whose father’s name is the same as my father’s." Sunan Abi Dawud, 11/370).<br>  <br>  The ahaadeeth concerning the appearance of the Mahdi reach the level of Tawaatur in meaning (tawaatur refers to a hadeeth which was narrated by so many people through so many isnaads that it is inconceivable that they could all have agreed on a lie). The imaams and scholars of this ummah have stated this, and a few of their comments are quoted below:<br>  <br>  1. Al-Haafiz Abu’l-Hasan al-Aabiri said: "The mutawaatir reports from the Prophet (Peace & Blessings of Allaah be upon Him) describing the Mahdi are very many. They state that the Mahdi will be of his family, that he will rule for seven years, that he will fill the earth with justice, that ‘Eesaa ibn Maryam will emerge and help him to kill the Dajjaal, and that he will lead this ummah in prayer and ‘Eesaa will pray behind him."<br>  <br>  2. Muhammad al-Barzanji said, in his book al-Ishaa’ah li Ashraat al-Saa’ah: "The major signs and the signs that will be immediately followed by the Hour: these signs are many, of which the Mahdi will be the first. Know that the ahaadeeth that have been narrated about him in various reports are numerous."

To oppose him, a luminous individual called Muhammad Mahdi of the Family of the Prophet will come to lead the people of sainthood and perfection, who are bound to the luminous chain of the Family of the Prophet, and he will kill the current of dissemblers, which will be the collective personality of the Sufyan, and scatter it.<br>  The Second Current: A tyrannical current born of Naturalist and Materialist philosophy will gradually become strong and spread at the end of time by means of materialist philosophy, reaching such a degree that it denies God. A savage who does not recognize the king or accept that the officers and soldiers in the army are his soldiers ascribes a sort of kingship and rulership to everyone and to all the soldiers. In just the same way, the members of that current, who deny God, each ascribes dominicality to his soul like a little Nimrod. And the greatest of them, the Dajjal, who will come to lead them, will manifest awesome wonders, a sort of spiritualism and hypnosis; he will go even further, and imagining his tyrannical, superficial rule to be a sort of dominicality, he will proclaim his godhead. It is clear just what foolish buffoonery it is for impotent man, who may be defeated by a fly and cannot create even a fly’s wing, to claim godhead.<br>  At that point when the current appears to be very strong, the religion of true Christianity, which comprises the collective personality of Jesus (Upon whom be peace), will emerge. That is, it will descend from the skies of Divine Mercy. Present Christianity will be purified in the face of that reality; it will cast off superstition and distortion, and unite with the truths of Islam. Christianity will in effect be transformed into a sort of Islam. Following the Qur’an, the collective personality of Christianity will be in the rank of follower, and Islam, in that of leader. True religion will become a mighty force as a result of its joining it. Although defeated before the atheistic current while separate, Christianity and Islam will have the capability to defeat and rout it as a result of their union. Then the person of Jesus (Upon whom be peace), who is present with his human body in the world of the heavens, will come to lead the current of true religion.<br>  Hadiths:<br>  Narrated Umm Salamah, Ummul Mu'minin: The Prophet (peace_be_upon_him) said: The mahdi will be of my family, of the descendants of Fatimah.

(Surah Anbiya 21:105)<br>  <br>  There are numerous traditions about Mahdi (a.s.) and these traditions have been recorded by most of the respected scholars of Ahle Sunnat. For example:<br>  <br>  Samarqandi in his book Tohfatut Talib, Sharani in Al-Yawaaqeeto wal Jawahir, Kwaja Parsa in Faslul Khitab, Ibne Hajar Asqalani in Al Qaulul Mukhtasar, Muhammad ibne abi Talha in Matalibusso-oul, Shablanji in Noorul Absar, Sawaidi in Sabaekuzzahab. All of them have mentioned regarding Mahdi (a.s.) that he is Muhammad the son of Hasan al-Askari (a.s.), and that he is alive and present like Isa (a.s.). He will remain so till the Almighty permits him to reappear like He would allow Isa (a.s.) to descend.<br>  <br>  Some of the Ahle Sunnat scholars have described the characteristics of Mahdi (a.s.) that he will be from the Ahle Bayt (a.s.).<br>  <br>  Al Bukhari in his Sahih in the Chapter of ‘Descension of Isa (a.s.)’ mentions a tradition from the Holy Prophet (s.a.w.s):<br>  <br>  "What would your condition be when the son of Marium descends amongst you and your Imam will be from you?"<br>  <br>  Muslim in his Sahih (Vol. 2) also records a tradition from the Holy Prophet (s.a.w.s):<br>  <br>  "There will be at the end of my Ummat a Khalifa. He will collect unlimited wealth. Which cannot be calculated."<br>  <br>  Tirmidhi and Abi Dawood remark, "This Caliph is Al Mahdi." (Tirmidhi, Vol. 2, Pg. 270, Sunan Abi Dawood Vol. 4, Kitabul Mahdi)<br>  <br>  3.and 4. Abi Dawood in his Sunan and Tirmidhi in his Sunan write that the Messenger of Allah (s.a.w.s.) said,<br>  <br>  "This world will not come to an end till a man from my Ahle Bayt has not ruled upon it. His name shall be same as mine. Even if a single day remains from the tenure of this earth the Almighty will prolong it so much that a man from my Ahle Bayt (a.s.) rises and fills it with justice and equity in the same way as it would have been filled with injustice and inequity."<br>  <br>  Abi Dawood has recorded this tradition with the additional words,<br>  <br>  "He will rule for seven years."<br>  <br>  Abi Dawood says that this hadith is authentic and Tibrani has quoted it in his Mojam; other scholars have also mentioned it. (Sunan Abi Dawood Vol. 4, Kitabul Mahdi).<br>  <br>  Ibne Tayyimiyah writes in his book, Minhajus Sunnah:<br>  <br>  "The traditions of Mahdi are well known. They are mentioned in the Musnad of Ahmed Ibne Hanbal, Sunan of Sajistani and Tirmidhi and other books of traditions."<br>  <br>  However the people who do not believe in Mahdi are very few, and they disbelieve due to ignorance or false pride. Because the majority of the scholars have admitted to the authenticity of the belief of Mahdi.|`|MhbEQoJYaa	Yes he will.|`|KqiiT1WSaa	YES.<br>  <br>  The lineage of Fatimah (RA)

664ef7ac282ab7a5fe638caafbfb05b3aa	The reason they reject/rejected General Evolution is because they have/had more than a superficial understanding of the theory, causing them to realized the theory is unsupportable, OR they lacked the blind faith that many Darwinist cling to because they are so desperate to deny the likelihood of an Intelligent Designer.<br>  <br>  Think about it.

HGPxEhMSaa	I have many stories about restaurants . If you have seen what i have seen even in high class restaurants you would eat at home. I can not eat at any restaurant i have ever done work for but that is off the point.<br>  <br>  I was working in a Chinese restaurant doing a cockroach treatment . How a days we use a Gel , bait but in those days we had to powder the cracks & crevices to flush the cockroaches out then spray .<br>   Now with a crack & crevice treatment you have to powder ever possible hiding place (harborige) gentle with a hand held puffer to get the dust to float in to flush them out , it can be a long slow job .<br>   Whilst i was doing the dusting this old Chinese man said NO, NO NO that,s not how you do it , snatched the puffer from me & started to fill the kitchen with poison dust . I quickly run to my truck refilled the puffer put on a mask then restarted & he again done the same thing so i put the puffer away , grabed the sprayer gave a quick spray then demanded payment .<br>   Once i got the money from him , I told him he must clean down the kitchen because of the poison dust everywhere , If someone got ill it was my licence at risk not to mention fines & reputation . I also told him I would make a written report of what happened to protect myself , he did not sound to worried .<br>   Now I can speak a little Chinese as I walked away (sorry if spelt wrong) I say under my breath Ne Sarguar ma , which basic means are you stupid ? <br>   Well he heard it He picked up a knife & was screeming at me , I just jumped in my truck & left , when I got back to the office my boss sacked me but he calmed down after hearing my side of the story .<br>  <br>  I have many other storys about a restaurant who used to cut up there meat on the floor , dead rats every where or having cockroaches running all over me or the smell of one restaurant that had me throwing up from the smell of rotten food .|`|py39L7Wraa	this one is actually about my dad. he went into this restaurant and ordered chicken. so while attempting to cut it, flew out of his plate and landed on the ground. i laughed a lot and he said: "if you know you can't with knife and fork properly then order something simple." there was another time he had to go to a dinner in Hilton hotel for his work. so one of his co-workers after having much difficulty eating with a knife and fork threw it down and called the waiter for a spoon. he declared loudly that he wasn't able with "this knife and fork stupidness, just give me a d**n spoon to eat with".|`|u4af7B2Iaa	My family and I went to Applebee's one night and we had a large group, so we had to pull two tables together. We ate and laughed and had a great time and then we all got up to leave. Well, what I didn't realize is that the table I was sitting at wasn't really designed to be there, so when I stood up, my head hit a stained glass lamp.

She didn't understand and thought his request was weird. But at his insistence, she decided to honor the customers request.<br>  <br>  Then he said, "Now I'm ready to order."<br>  <br>  "What would you like then sir?"<br>  <br>  "Well, my wife said I could have anything on the menu, so ..."<br>  <br>  .........................................<br>  hmmm seems some did not appreciate this story & gave it thumbs down. However, it is a true story that was told to my wife and me by a waitress in a restaurant in Barryville, NY

Being religious is trying to be good enough or paying some priest to make you good(perfect). God says all have sinned. The only way to heaven is by accepting that He will make you good enough. This is why he died on the cross as a substitute.   If you are seeking the truth read the Gospel of John, The book of Acts and Genesis. To be saved you need to<br>  believe Jesus died on the cross taking the blame and the punishment for your sin and ask Him into your life. Be<br>  willing to turn from sin with His help. Now live for Him by worshipping God, learning of Him in His Word the<br>  Bible and owning Him before others.

Everyone can choose his/her belief. This is the right for everyone. No matter what they believe, we can't say or think they are not good because they are not the same religion as yours. No one will go to hell if they do nothing wrong seriously, like killing many people by purpose.|`|qcEzJDY6aa	Hell is not literal, it is the actual living in this unfortunate earth no one to save you but by believing in Jesus, He can raised up anybody to life again and live a good life.

l3L28h3Paa	i myself do not believe i am wiser or more mature than non smokers.  But as with anything people know things that others do not.

It was a habit and a habit can either be good or bad. Not once did I think I looked cool while smoking. I did not care about how i looked while doing it. I have been smoking since I was 12 and I am 26 now, I didn't start it to be cool and I didn't continue it to be cool. A habit and an addiction attacks people who are vulnerable to it and when I began I was vulnerable and now I have to deal with the damage to my body accordingly.<br>  <br>  I am also not dumb!

Im an idiot for smoking and I should quit as soon as I can. To me, smoking is not a sign of being wiser or more mature, smoking is bad.|`|zhk8o514aa	I'd take dumber and immature over stinky hair and yellow teeth at any day.|`|tGAt3ZKkaa	no but they think they are cool.<br>  I tell ya what, anyone who smokes is doing more damage to second hand smokers than themselves.<br>  So they are selfish, stuck up and smelly people.
Leda2ha0aa	You have badgered him enough and I would not count on him for the letter.

If a question is asked in a polite manner, I'll answer and share my opinion, since I believe that there is a good exchange of ideas on this sight at some points.

f93b40ae4fafa8ae7f952e520841e697aa	your right!<br>  As already stated Christ (the Greek word) and Messiah (The Hebrew word) means "anointed one"<br>  He became that at his baptism in 29CE. When God's holy spirit came down from the heavens and settled upon Jesus after coming out of the water. He the was anointed with holy spirit. Appointed to a special position. Matt 3:16,17.<br>  <br>  Most people don't know much about the name of God either.|`|9ed79b2c402a7fe054faaa860538c607aa	Yes I know, Christ means Son of God, or Savior. We just say Jesus Christ to add that He is our Lord, God, and Savior.<br>  <br>  A lot of atheists don't have a clue either.|`|9qUnD0sBaa	That is so funny,  I thought it was his last name too when I was about 7.  Actually it was probably Jesus son of Joesph the carpenter of Nazareth, or something of that effect.|`|Rn4GXoJAaa	Actually, that is not entirely true. Surnames began as attachments after the first name to distinguish a person from other people of the same name, for example john the baptist, mary magdalene, etc. Jesus was a common 1st century name, so to distinguish him as Jesus the Anointed, is in line with this. All surnames began this way, for example my last name is Johnson, "son of john". <br>  <br>  What you are thinking of is "family names" which developed much, much later.|`|879EON0taa	yes, and there were many christs occurring in other parts of the world prior to the myth of Jesus. it was a common theme in pagan myth/religion. the "annoited" son of ___ (god of whatever) who was born on Dec 25th, of a virgin, had to die for humankind, was resurrected on the spring equinox, etc. if you weren't afraid to know, you would also find that the book of Genesis is a nearly word for word copy of older Arabic mythology...but hey, learning is voluntary.|`|AA12194228	Actually, to say "Jesus, the Christ" would be correct. Like the angel said "unto you will be born a savior, and he shall be "Christ the Lord".|`|uFAoq4idaa	Yes, because Christ means "The Messiah" or "The Promised One." So it maybe said it this way; Jesus the Messiah or Jesus the Promised One.|`|PWankIUpaa	Of Course I know it it is His Title ! He has many <br>  Christ or in Hebrew Messiah (Christ simply means Messiah in the language of His day and Christians mean Little Christs being His followers)<br>  His many Titles include <br>   The Word of God<br>  The Word made Flesh <br>  Elohim (which is Inclusive of Himself and the Father and the Holy Spirit)<br>  The I Am in both the Old and New Testaments and many more.|`|Ve18FAnGaa	then was his middle name really "H?" <br>  <br>  a little tidbit for you; most people these days have last names that where given to their ancestors as a way to describe what they did for a living.  this was a way for people to identify people they met. the rich got other names, us peons just got reminders of our lot in life|`|QVKWVValaa	Yeah. I love that fact. Biblical scholars think it was bar-Yosef (son of Joseph)*.<br>  Did you know Jesus wasn't his real name either? It was more likely Yeshua. <br>  It's also very likely he never really existed.|`|V8Lyc2Jlaa	In fact, since the new testament was written in hellenistic greek, I'm surprised they didn't come up with a Jesus Josephopoulos or even Jesus Godopoulos name! :-)|`|lVAe2SLXaa	And "Jesus" wasn't his first name, either. His real name was Yashua ben Yusef. The name Jesus Christ was a Greek/Roman translation that stuck due to poor translating skills in the middle-ages.|`|7fGgQ88Qaa	Of course I know that. <br>  Christ is another word for the messiah,<br>  and Jesus was the messiah.<br>  <br>  <br>  They didn't even have last names back them.|`|bI3areCsaa	I never knew anyone believed that!Of course He does not have a last name!|`|QGuxbItCaa	I thought it was Jesus Claus. Sometimes he uses his first name...Santa|`|3a9f326d01ff48571ab8b07403c16d21aa	Do you know that Jesus' name is Immanuel but he was called Jesus. Do you also know that Jesus never told anyone his name not even Mary or Joseph. People just called him Jesus as fulfillment of the prophecy<br>  <br>  That is how you know jesus was the real thing. All the false Christ always tell you that they are Jesus. That is clue number 1 that they are false. Jesus never told anybody who he was. he always used Son of Man for himself|`|Wd1vUx3Vaa	Jesus is the anglicised word for the original name.<br>  So even Jesus isn't what they called him<br>  Muslims call him Easa , Jesus, similar sounding words.<br>  <br>  As a muslim, we all love Jesus. The only difference we have from you is that we do not believe he is God's Son but only a man and wise prophet|`|0WuoC5xIaa	The word Christ came from a greek word Khri·stos, which means anointed one.

I remember one time during the day when I was home alone I heard the front door open an close an some footsteps going up stairs, I was at the time in the back of the house I went to the bottom of the staircase an called up thinking my Dad had popped home while working in the area to use the loo an grab a cup of tea. I got no answer so went half way up the stairs an called again an still got no answer, thinking this strange I went all the way up to the top an saw the bathroom door was open an nobody there, i then checked all the bedrooms and again no one was there. I went to the main bedroom front window an looked out there was no car parked there an going back down stairs I looked around an found no one in the house. Other members of my family had similar experience's at times an not all of them were home alone. None of us ever felt scared or frightened from our visitor an we all feel it was a kindly spirit. It was not just family members who had such experience's as a guest also had the experience an has never forgotten how starnge it was yet none of us had ever said anything.|`|TjrnVFVRaa	Of course, silly, ghosts are real. <br>  <br>  They are spirits who are making the transition to the next plane of existence, and are off on a wonderful journey. Sometimes they have left behind some unfinished business here in this world, and they may need our help before they can complete their journey. <br>  <br>  If you ever do experience a "ghostly" encounter, banish any fears from your mind and think calm soothing thoughts. Open your mind to the spirit and they may contact you with a message.

Im 22 now. I dont know weather it was real, or just a dream, but it sure did seem real. I was lying in bed with the lights off. The door was open and I could see directly into the passage where there was light. All I recall one night was a lady just standing there. She had a black raggedy dress, long black hair, and her face was pale. The dress was like that lady from the adams family, I forgot her name. Anyway, she stood there and there seemed to be wind blowing on her. She was really pretty as well. I think she was trying to tell me something but I was too scared so I just crept under the blanket. I wish I could recall more, but I was very young. It could qualify as a dream, but Im quite sure it was real. I dont think I will ever know.|`|zEoRcL91aa	I think people are haunted, not always places.

And when I was young, about 5 or 6, I had this horrible experience with a ghost at home. I woke up, and I could hear my parents sleeping, so I just sat with my back to the headboard of my bed and started to look around my bedroom, because suddenly I felt something wrong. The lamp beside my bed started to levitate, and I got paralyzed by the situation, I only could manage a whisper: "mummy..." Then suddenly, the lamp gave me a blow at the back of my head and I started crying and yelling: "MUMMY, MUMMY!!" When my parents ran into my bedroom, the lamp dropped and I was crying like mad while i was saying: "Mummy, daddy, the lamp, it was the lamp...!" I can't forget that day. It was the weirdest day in my whole life. I can remember every single detail, I can even remember the light coming into my bedroom, the silence, the smell...everything.|`|chmzBaiTaa	yes I believe on them not because I've seen them. Even so in my childhood years, I have not seen ghosts personally but I do still believe on them. Now that I'm old enough, I still believe on them and I actually saw one. I could still remember that night.<br>  <br>  There were 3 of us (2 classmates and me). We were heading to the canteen for some refreshments after posting some articles on our bulletin board. (we actually finished posting on our bulletin at 6:30-40 in the evening) Though we are the only students left in the school we didn't feel any fear. When we arrived at the canteen, I literally look on the highschool department building which is adjacent to our canteen. I could clearly see the corridors and rooms very dark but I noticed a light. I hardly see the face though it has figure of a lady. I could sense that she's looking on us from the building. I did felt that I was gonna faint but I got hold of the iron bars on the canteen. I quickly told<br>   my classmates .(but the other one didn't bother to look back coz she's scared) my other classmate also saw her and I could tell that she's shock too. We run as quickly as we could till we arrived at the guard's house. We were so scared bout the figure on the building. There were also rumors that there are many hauntings on that same place. I even spotted one ghost in the photo on that same building.|`|vBIwaQ0qaa	I have had so many encounters with my mom, my husband and even my grandmother who I never met.

XqrjFYgIaa	I live in Houston, Texas, and I'm aware of a clinic that offers support services (including group and individual therapy, as well as "coming out" support groups) geared specifically toward GLBT community members. It's a safe place where GLBT individuals and allies can go to obtain information, have open discussion, and connect with people who share similar experiences. I think if you do a simple google search of your city, you might come across some important community resources that are nearby. Also, university counseling centers are often good sources of information for students and the public. If they don't offer the services you're interested in, it's very likely that they can give you referrals to community organizations. <br>  <br>  Here's the link to the GLBT counseling center in Houston. Hopefully they can help to connect you to resources that are available near you. <br>  <a href="http://www.montrosecounselingcenter.org/" rel="nofollow">http://www.montrosecounselingcenter.org/</a><br>  Good luck, friend. :)|`|hhJrwRNdaa	Look in the Yellow Pages..|`|TWE4AKX5aa	School counselors are usually very good to talk to.<br>  I, personally, speak with my high school crisis and intervention counselor, not because I think of it as a crisis -- I just trust him more than any other counselor in the school.|`|LT8blW3Oaa	that all depends on how old you are really, i personally spoke with my high school guidance counselor other than that i cant say other than look around online you may find some place

But in the East, Easterns believe the younger you die, the better you were, the greeks invented the phrase "Only the good die young", So going along with the belief of reincarnation, you will die (or leave your body) when you have learned your lessons and reached your goals for that particular life, whether it's age 7 or age 87.

OKPFeBtYaa	It would be like in the Simpsons how Bart calls his father, Homer.   Good kids usually address their parents Otoosan, and mother Okaasan. Calling your parent by his her given name would be really rude, or using more brusque ways of saying "you," like annta, o-mae, or the dreaded "teme," which would be like calling your dad a cvcksucker.  <br>  To disrespect mom, I would say speaking in the above mentioned ways would suffice.  Using "o-mae" to anyone other than close friends is quite rude, and even I can't imagine saying to my mother, who isn't my favorite person in the world.  Good luck with your story!

All you Roman Catholics that have committed atrocities, apologize now!<br>  <br>  <br>  2) I am referring to the Church. Not necessarily each and every member.<br>  <br>  Well, it seems reasonable that the church should apologize to those individuals on whom it has perpetrated atrocities.  What's that?  They're all dead?  To whom, then, should the church (as an organization) apologize, and for what atrocities?<br>  <br>  This seems odd.  Are you going to apologize to the world for the atrocities of humanity?  As a (fill in the blank), are you going to apologize for the atrocities committed by all (fill in the blank)s throughout history?<br>  <br>  The "church" cannot really apologize and repent.  The church is made up of individuals.  Repentance on an organizational level *can* be seen by the enactment of policies that attempt to remedy whatever wrongdoing was committed.  So (for example), if you are speaking of the inquisition, such is no longer allowed in the Roman Catholic Church.  That's as close as you can get to repentance for deeds committed by an organization against those long dead.  The church can't even come that close to apologizing, though - only individuals can do that.<br>  <br>  Jim, <a href="http://www.bible-reviews.com/selector_rc.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.bible-reviews.com/selector_rc...</a>|`|lNtwpzpOaa	Sheesh, this must be Catholic bashing day.<br>  <br>  Please state your "atrocities" because the Church has apologized for things in the past, but remember hind sight is 20-20.

And still does.  The Church, through the centuries, have apologizes for things it needed to apologize for. Other things were justly done and ordered by God. God sent His Spirit to guide the Church. When a pope did something wrong, God saw to it that that pope was no longer pope in order to stop his sinful lusts. Some died shortly after they sinned (read the papal history). Pope John Paul II and Pope Benedict has both apologized for the way priests were handled with the molestation charges.  <br>  <br>  I don't think the Church has anything more to apologize for (for now). Remember, history of the Holy See shows us that when unjustly things were done, God took care of it.   And all humans can be sinners.

What about the Puritans (fundamentalist Christians) who killed witches (something non-existent)?  What about the Church of England (Anglicans/Episcopalians) who killed hundreds of priests and nuns (raped them too) and stole their monasteries and convents?  What about all the communists who murdered Christians because they were Christian and still do so today?  What about the Northern Ireland protestants who believe it is blessing to kill Roman Catholics...even today?  What about the Mormon church....its members slaughtered a wagon train back in the 1800's and blamed it on the Indians (Mountain Meadow Massacre)?  And what about the Hindus who are currently killing Christians in India while the world lets them do so with impunity?  And the muslims who kill in the name of their god?  Oh and don't forget anti-semitism by everyone!<br>  <br>  And why stop at religion?  For many centuries women and children have been oppressed by men....and non-whites have been oppressed by whites.  And what about the rich oppressing the poor and the robber barons oppressing the labor movement?<br>  <br>  I think you get the idea....there have been lots and lots of atrocities over history...some relating to religion and some not.  Atrocities have NOTHING to do with God (whether the church is Roman Catholic or Mormon or Muslim)!!!  Atrocities are the product of flawed human nature...the consequence of unchecked power and greed, with a dash of arrogance and sadism!<br>  <br>  And...when we start apologizing for "past" atrocities...where do we start and end...why do we limit it to only the Catholics?  Every one of us has skeletons in our past.  We need to let go of the past which is over and done with (ie. why visit the sins of the fathers on to the children of today?) and focus on making sure that for today and tomorrow, there are no more attrocities.

You are my slave and My Apostle, and I have named you Al-Mutawakkil (one who depends upon Allah). You are neither hard-hearted nor of fierce character, nor one who shouts in the markets. You do not return evil for evil, but excuse and forgive. Allah will not take you unto Him till He guides through you a crocked (curved) nation on the right path by causing them to say: "None has the right to be worshipped but Allah." With such a statement He will cause to open blind eyes, deaf ears and hardened hearts.'  (Sahih Bukhari-Book 60, Hadith 362).<br>  <br>  Malik related to me that he heard that Isa ibn Maryam used to say, "Do not speak much without the mention of Allah for you will harden your hearts. A hard heart is far from Allah, but you do not know. Do not look at the wrong actions of people as if you were lords. Look at your wrong actions as if you were slaves. Some people are afflicted by wrong action and some people are protected from it. Be merciful to the people of affliction and praise Allah for His protection."

These teachings are known as the Seven Grandfathers. <br>  <br>  — The Seven Grandfathers<br>  <br>  Nbaakaawin -– Wisdom: To cherish knowledge is to know wisdom. Wisdom is given by the Creator to be used for the good of the people. <br>  <br>  Zaagidwin -- Love: Love must be unconditional. When people are weak they need love the most.<br>  <br>  Mnaadendmowin -- Respect: Have respect for all that is. All of creation should be treated with respect. You must give respect if you wish to be respected.<br>  <br>  Aakdehewin -- Bravery: To face a foe with integrity. To do what's right even when the consequences are unpleasant. <br>  <br>  Gwekwaadziwin -- Honesty: Always be honest in word and action. Be honest first with yourself, and you will more easily be able to be honest with others.<br>  <br>  Dbaadendizin -- Humility: You are equal to others, but you are not better. <br>  <br>  Debwewin -- Truth: Speak the truth. Do not deceive yourself or others. <br>  .|`|8Nqq7tkwaa	i may agree with them (and do) but they are not part of my people's teachings.|`|BKyFxjeBaa	There is NO "native american way" for one.<br>  There are over 711 FEDERALLY recognized tribes, and roughly the same number WAITING to be recognized. and EACH one is different.

BzrUWCsDaa	I love this chapter & could spend ages discussing it but I'll try to be brief :)<br>  <br>  We learn quite a few things from verses 21-23<br>  <br>  One is that it isn't enough just to say that you believe in Jesus Christ because notice he says that certain ones will come to him & claim to have been following him,,, even "done many wonders" in Jesus name. He says to some "I never knew you, depart from me" <br>  We would never want that to happen so what is the key lesson here?<br>  He says ..."Not everyone who says to Me, ‘Lord, Lord,’ shall enter the kingdom of heaven, but he who does THE WILL OF MY FATHER in heaven"<br>  So, we need to find out what his Father's will is... & then do it<br>  <br>  Simply believing in Jesus is not enough. After all, Satan & the demons believe in Jesus yet they won't be saved.<br>  <br>  Verses 13 & 14 mention two roads (or gates)<br>  One is broad & spacious leading to destruction. It's easy to be on this road where the majority are. There are no restrictions & travelling on it is easy. However, it's leading to destruction. There are two ways it leads to destruction. <br>  Firstly, the fruitage we reap while on this road is bad. The relative freedom we experience reaps a lifestyle that is detrimental to us (physically & spiritually) We can make our own choices against God's guidelines but the fruitage we reap could be sexually transmitted diseases for example.<br>  More importantly, it leads to our everlasting destruction for God will judge adversely those on this road.<br>  The narrow road on the other hand is cramped & sometimes difficult to be on. It takes effort because of our inherited imperfections. Only those who are sincerely striving to stay close to Jehovah's laws will stay on this road. It's not about intellectuality or stamina but heart condition. Those with the right heart condition will do their utmost to stay on this road. And Jehovah will help them. We can't stay on it without his help & guidance. - Isaiah 48:17<br>  He's there for us to help us & we look to his word for guidance. He also tells us to meet together to strengthen one another to stay on this narrow road to life - Hebrews 10:24,25<br>  & to pray incessantly - 1 Thess 5:17<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.watchtower.org/e/20060515/article_02.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.watchtower.org/e/20060515/art...</a>|`|isll2Uqnaa	there are many people in this world who call themselves Christians, but their hearts are far from Him...many who proclaim themselves to be Christians will be shocked at the end when Jesus tells them "I never knew you." they look like the world, do the things of this world, and believe going to church will save them. <br>  <br>  a lot of Christians forget that past the narrow gate is also a narrow path..you cant enter the narrow gate by salvation and then live as the world.

In reality, they are actually not doing these things in God's name at all; instead they are building their own selfish empire.  This includes seeking praise for themselves, using people to obtain money ultimately largely for their own selfish use.  In reality these people will be shunned by God, as they never really knew Him, instead they only used His Name, to advance their own selfish desires ambitions. The never really sought God's will or His authority.<br>  <br>  This scripture is saying it's not just about what you have done in your life, but how and why you have done it.....what is your real motive?<br>  <br>  7;13-14 The narrow gate shows us that walking on God's path is focused, simple and straight forward, yet will be hard.  You have to simply trust, obey and keep to what God is saying, rather than being tempted and deceived by going through the wide gate of deception that leads to destruction, which seems easy and appealing at the time.<br>  <br>  7;15-20 The trees are simply that you will know whether someone is truly following God, by how they conduct their lifestyle.  A person who is following God can only produce good things in their lives, and will be know for doing these things. Someone who is falsely representing God, will clearly be living a lie, and only pretending to be good, in order to try and deceive people.  When you look closely at what these deceivers are really doing, they are secretly doing all kinds of wicked or ungodly things.<br>  <br>  7:31-23 is saying that people may outwardly profess to being religious, however if they are not obeying God then it is meaningless.  <br>  <br>  In essence, this scripture is simply saying that God knows who is fake and those who may have deceived other people (and maybe even themselves), they will not permitted into heaven, simply because they have falsely represented God during their lifetime, yet never really obeyed or know Him personally.<br>  <br>  It's a reality checker and warning to everyone who is genuinely wanting to seek and do God's will.  All of us have the potential to become proud, self-seeking, and disobedient to God if our own ego gets the better of us.  If we always give all the glory to God and are humbled by His awesome majesty, then we can be assured that we are walking through the narrow gate.|`|yB0nVXfWaa	There are many who are coming in the name of Jesus today who, quite honestly, are false prophets and 'wolves in sheep's clothing' of which the Lord tried to warn us 4 times in Matt.24 - the Olivet Discourse.<br>  <br>  The problem is not from without, but from within and there are lots of scriptures about this : Acts. 20:28-31, Gal.1:6-10, II Thess. 2:3, 9-12. I Tim. 4:1-3, 6:3-5, II Tim. 3:1-9, Jude 3-4, 8, 10-13, 16-19.<br>  <br>  Interestingly, it will not be whether we did 'signs and wonders', prophesied in his name, nor even cast out demons, that will cause the Lord to own us - no, it will be, after having received the gift of his righteousness, whether we have then cleaned up our lives and pursued holiness.  For we have been saved in order to live our lives so as to give Jesus a good name.<br>  <br>  There are so many who think they can receive the free gift of Jesus Christ and thereafter do what they like.  If that is so, then Jesus is not their Lord.  And, if he is not their Lord, and they mock him in this way, do you think he will own them at the Judgment?  For if, whilst professing his name, they actually drag it in the mud by their evil deeds, then how can they say they belong to him?<br>  <br>  This word 'lawlessness' is interesting, for many say that they will not have to obey the Law when they are saved.  Maybe not the Law of ordinances and blood sacrifices, but the Ten Commandments - the moral law - yes, indeed.  For Christ did not abolish that Law, he came to fulfill it, to make it bigger, even, and to establish it, and gave us the Holy Spirit so that we can obey it, when we couldn't before.  So, being a Christian is not a licence to live lawless - quite the opposite.  For the Law was given by Moses, Christ kept it, and we also will do, if we love him.<br>  <br>  Also, the word 'practice' is interesting, too.  It is those who habitually live in sin, who are just not getting clear and following after holiness, who will be condemned.  Christians aren't perfect - otherwise there would not be the need for repentance along the way (which there is) - but God wants to see that we are at least grappling with personal sin, or are we following after the charismatic 'thrills and spills' of personal power?<br>  <br>  Power belongs to God.  It is not our personal plaything and we certainly should not center on it and lust after it, in order to build our own little empires and be called a 'great man of God'.  I have seen much of this in my life, and I have come to the conclusion that personal holiness is where it is - that, and calming down and obeying the Word.<br>  <br>  It is not good to follow after every so-called 'new move of God' for many of them are worse than will-o-the-wisps - teasing timewasters at best, dangerous heresies at worst.  Many people, who will no longer put up with 'wholesome doctrine' are now running after these things in the Church, and letting a multitude of false teachers fleece them not just of their time and money, but also of their biblical faith.|`|AA11232725	you who practice lawlessness!’<br>  <br>  John 3:3  Jesus answered and said to him, "Most assuredly, I say to you, unless one is born again, he cannot see the kingdom of God."<br>  <br>  Romans 8:8  So then, those who are in the flesh cannot please God.  9  But you are not in the flesh but in the Spirit, if indeed the Spirit of God dwells in you. Now if anyone does not have the Spirit of Christ, he is not His.<br>  <br>  1 John 3:7  Little children, let no one deceive you. He who practices righteousness is righteous, just as He is righteous.  8  He who sins is of the devil, for the devil has sinned from the beginning. For this purpose the Son of God was manifested, that He might destroy the works of the devil.  <br>  <br>  9  Whoever has been born of God does not sin, for His seed remains in him; and he cannot sin, because he has been born of God.  10  In this the children of God and the children of the devil are manifest: Whoever does not practice righteousness is not of God, nor is he who does not love his brother.|`|ewWUFWyWaa	It is very tricky to go to a place that only exists in the Bible!<br>  <br>  Almost anybody can be a Christian the Clergy and the Preachers have a way to make you a Christian in no time, but Jesus was telling everybody that only very few of them will make it into Heaven... the rest will sizzle in Hell for ever and ever.  You must remember that “salvation” is a fair weather deal in the Bible. It is not applicable to anybody in peril of his/her life. To be “saved” in the Bible involves a well defined personal effort accepting the claims of the person doing the salvation. In real life such a person in peril of his/her life may not be in condition to answer questions or to cooperate in the least with the savior and the savior must do all the work of salvation if he/she is serious about “saving” anybody!  NOT SO IN THE BIBLE STORIES!!!  <br>  <br>  Matthew 7:13-14 (Jesus said) "Enter through the narrow gate. For wide is the gate and broad is the road that leads to destruction, and many enter through it. But small is the gate and narrow the road that leads to life, and ONLY A FEW FIND IT.<br>  <br>  Jesus NEVER made it easy for anybody to find the small gate and narrow road. And of the “ONLY FEW WHO FIND IT”… not all of them will be able to get in... Good conduct has nothing to do with “finding the narrow door” to Heaven! <br>  <br>  Luke 13:23-24 (NIV) Someone asked him, "Lord, are only a few people going to be saved?" He said to them, "Make every effort to enter through the narrow door, because MANY, I tell you, WILL TRY TO ENTER AND WILL NOT BE ABLE TO* (*Isn’t God the Son Jesus Christ a first class teaser?). <br>  <br>  The few who find the small gate and narrow road to Heaven need to hate their own family and everybody else in the world to follow Jesus! Never mind that the 10 Commandments say, “Thou shalt honour thy father and thy mother!”…   <br>  <br>  Matthew 10:34-37 niv<br>  "Do not suppose that I have come to bring peace to the earth. I did not come to bring peace, but a sword. For I have come to turn <br>         “'a man against his father, <br>         a daughter against her mother, <br>         a daughter-in-law against her mother-in-law— <br>  your enemies will be the members of your own household.' "ANYONE WHO LOVES THEIR FATHER OR MOTHER MORE THAN ME IS NOT WORTHY OF ME; ANYONE WHO LOVES A SON OR DAUGHTER MORE THAN ME IS NOT WORTHY OF ME.<br>  <br>  Luke 14:26 (NIV) Jesus Christ said, "If anyone comes to me and does not HATE* (*Greek=”miseo”=to abhor!) his father and mother, his wife and children, his brothers and sisters--yes, even his own life--he cannot be my disciple."<br>  <br>  Luke 14:33 (NIV) In the same way, ANY OF YOU WHO DOES NOT GIVE UP EVERYTHING HE HAS CANNOT BE MY DISCIPLE.<br>  <br>  Most Christians today don’t stop like Saint Peter did to reflect on the possibility that they might be phony Christians… <br>  <br>  Mark 10:28-30 (NIV) Peter said to him, "We have left everything to follow you!" "I TELL YOU THE TRUTH,"* (*duck!) Jesus replied, "no one who has left home or brothers or sisters or mother or father or children* (*the SOB Bible writers are promoting the total neglect and rejection of child support!) or fields for me and the gospel will fail to receive a HUNDRED TIMES as much in this present age [RIGHT NOW!!!] homes, brothers, sisters, mothers, children and fields--and with them, persecutions* (*from former abandoned wives and children! Spiritually speaking, of course! Hard core Christians ignore a lot of Jesus’ rules that they need to follow to go to Heaven when they die!)  and in the age to come, eternal life. (TRUE! Most preachers are making a considerable fortune preaching the Gospel…! The rest are the “dedicated” more gullible not so lucky ones just content to make a living on it!)<br>  <br>  Plus…<br>  Matthew 18:8 (NIV) Jesus Christ said, "If your hand or your foot causes you to sin cut it off and throw it away. It is better for you TO ENTER LIFE maimed or crippled than to have two hands or two feet and be thrown into eternal fire."<br>  <br>  Apparently, there isn’t going to be any cripple person in Hell! Not only that, but according to God the Son Jesus Christ many Christians ought to consider plain castration for the “kingdom sake” (Check “castrati” on Wikipedia!)…  Sweet Jesus recognizes such efforts and hints his approval in spite of the fact that God the Father in Heaven said that no eunuch will come near him! So there will be segregation in Heaven, but what the heck Jesus is that counts!<br>  <br>  Matthew 19:12b (KJV) (Jesus said)…and there be eunuchs* (*castrated guys), which have made themselves eunuchs for the kingdom of heaven's sake. He that is able to receive it, let him receive it.  <br>  <br>  Nobody beats the Bible writers at Jesus making political promises payable in this lifetime if you wish to follow him! The acid test comes when Jesus finds out that you are neither hot nor cold and he pukes you out of his Holy Belly (Rev 3:16).  Just to make sure that you understand that this opportunity of going to Heaven is a one shot deal, the Bible writers are saying that only a dog goes back to eat its own vomit! But what the heck! Christians are trained to love Jesus, anyway!<br>  <br>  Most preachers today poach verses here and there to make Christianity palatable to everybody.  All that you hear now is that Jesus wants to make you rich and healthy so the rest of the Bible is ignored! Christianity is a multibillion dollar business, too!|`|NLinPsyhaa	what it means to me is that He is talking about false teachers and prophets doing what they claim is in the name of the Lord, but not doing the will of the Lord because they have no love for Him.

Many will plead that they had done miracles, and preached or prophesied much, and will demand an entrance into heaven. The power of working miracles had no necessary connexion with piety. God may as well, if he chooses, give the power of raising the dead to a wicked man, as the skill of healing to a wicked physician. A miracle is a display of his own power through the medium of another. An act of healing the sick is also a display of his power through the agency of another. In neither of these cases is there any necessary connexion with moral character. So of preaching, or prophesying. God may use the agency of a man of talents, though not pious, to carry forward his purposes. Saving power on the mind is the work of God; and he may convey it by any agency which he may choose. Accordingly, many may be found in the day of judgment who may have been endowed with powers of prophecy, or miracle, as Balaam, or the magicians of Egypt; in the same way as many men of distinguished talents may be found yet destitute of piety, and shut out of his kingdom. See Mark 9:38 Luke 9:49 1Corinthians 13:1-3. In this last place, Paul says, that though he spoke with the tongue of angels, and had the gift of prophecy, and could remove mountains, and had not charity or love, all would be of no avail.

a7364c50b7e6712ee3c77218a3232b45aa	Have only had time to glance at article but it appears to be a small minority of schools who are promoting anti-Western views - it's a pity they wouldn't comment to the Telegraph. <br>  <br>  The chairman of Muslim Schools UK comments on the need for social cohesion but appears to criticize only the report's authors in compromising trust and harmony instead of making his views on the extremist schools clear.

S5H0NmEWaa	All believers should be agnostics. Agnostic means "not knowing"; the nature of God is that he is not provable, otherwise it's not an act of faith to believe in him. I'm a Christian and a Quaker and I happily identify as an agnostic because I cannot *know* for absolutely certain that there is a God; if I could prove that there was a God then my religious beliefs would be pretty much on the same basis as my belief that there is such a place as China, even though I've never been there.<br>  <br>  Of course, my way of thinking is less conducive to those people who are really religious because they want to be tribal, bossy, powerful or special, so it probably won't catch on.|`|VcD1Q6cUaa	I will just tell you my own belief; that the order of the Universe is so amazing, so profound,  that it couldn't have just come into existence without a Creator that made it all possible.

AA11047076	Kabbalah is not  religion- it is Jewish mysticism.  So lets explain what it is.<br>  <br>  To start with- lets build a foundation to make what follows clear:<br>  <br>  Moses received the Torah on Mt. Sinai from God.  The Torah consists of two parts<br>  1) The written part, the Chamishe Sifrei Torah (the five books of the Torah- Five books of Moses) <br>  2) The oral law, Mishnah, which was written down after the destruction of the second temple so it would not be forgotten or altered through inaccurate transmission.<br>  The rest of the Tanach (Torah, Nevi'im(prophets) and Ketuvim(Writings)) came later.  The origins of the Kabbalah are in there- the description of the heavenly chariot is considered one of the major mystical portions- and from which a lot of Kabbalah is learned, and some claim that the entire book of Job is one of Sod (literally secret and referring to Kabbalistic meanings).  Later, the Sefer HaYesod was written- which was then complemented with a far more complete work, the Zohar.  But these books are not complete- somethings are not written down.  These form the basis of what is known as Lurianic Kabalah, named after Rabbi Isaac Luria (Ha'arizal) who is considered one of the greatest Kabbalist in history.  A competing school of Kabballah is based around the teachings of the Ba'al Shem Tov, the originator of the chassidic movement, and summarised in the Tanya, written by Rav Schneur Zalman of Liadi- the founder of the Chabad Lubavitch movement (Chabad literaly stands for "Chochmah, Binah and Da'at- the three main sefirot in the tree of life as taught by the Ba'al shem tov)<br>  <br>  When Jews study the Torah- it is looked at in various ways- and in each way, a word, or even a letter can mean something different or teach something different.<br>  1) Pshat- this is the plain, easily understood meaning (yeah right- sometimes even this is difficult!)<br>  2) Halachic - the legal interpretation- so taking the legal definition of a word rather than its straight meaning. This is really just a subset of pshat since they are both plain meanings though what is learned may differ.<br>  3) Remesh - the alluded to meanings. This is where you get the alluded to meanings and the oral law meanings of the passages. Some of these are aggadot- more like morality stories or fables- though always meant to teach, others are halachic and give guidance on the laws.<br>  4) Sod- secret. This level of study is the most difficult and is not common. studying at this level is usually only done by a student and teacher in an one on one session and is not taught in large groups or classes. The reason for this is that the teacher has to make sure that the student fully understands what is being taught, or the student may be led astray. A story in the Talmud, masechta Chagigah, is told of Rabbi Akivah, one of the greatest sages who, using kaballah from the lessons derived from the vision of the merkava (divine chariot), ascended to view the world to come, with four students- each a great sage in their own right. One student who was pure, did not guard himself and died from the view, a second went mad, a third died and the fourth became an apostate and started his own religion, dualistic in nature. The Talmud brings this story to teach 1) that this should never have been done in a group and 2) as a general warning that studying Kaballah is not for everyone.<br>  <br>  So let us now look at Sod- the area in which Kaballah is found. <br>  a) The earliest written work of Kaballah is generally stated as being the Book of Job. The Rabbis do not view this book literally but rather as an allegory in which many Kaballistic insights are taught.<br>  b) The earliest oral source of Kaballah is stated as being the Sefer Yetzira, which tradition states was authored by Abraham and passed down orally until it was written down around 200CE since it was in danger of being corrupted or forgotten.<br>  c) The vision of the divine Chariot<br>  d) The Zohar - Tradition states that this was a compilation of lessons that Rebbe Shimon Bar Yochai collated and organised while he was hiding from the Romans around 200CE. Because it is in the realm of Sod- people were always reluctant to write down- but it was finally written down around the 1600s.<br>  <br>  Who studies it?<br>  Basically the majority of Orthodox Jews accept Kaballah as worthwhile studying, though there is a rule that we never alter the halachah (Jewish law) because of what is found in the Kaballah. The Torah, written and oral, takes primacy.<br>  <br>  However, Judaism is focussed on action- not belief, in doing, not in studying for the sake of studying.  As such, the focus has always been on learning the Torah first- together with all the laws and how to perform them properly, before studying anything to do with the Kaballah.  Thus for a long time no Kaballah was written down- and it was only directly taught by teacher to student in an one on one fashion.  Even today- the written works of the Kaballah do not contain everything- their are major elements that are only taught  teacher to student in an one on one fashion.  Even today- the written works of the Kaballah do not contain everything- their are major elements that are only taught by teacher to student.  As such- finding a teacher is paramount- and it is not easy to do,  Generally, a teacher will only take a student who is married, has children, has studied all of shas (the complete Jewish law) and is living an observant Jewish life style.  Studying Kaballah outside of Judaism is a bizarre concept- much of Kaballah is direct commentary on the Torah and Tanach (such commentary is "remesh" and refers to the hidden meanings in the verses as opposed to the p'shat (direct) meaning.  Other major sources of learning remesh are the Midrash Rabbah, Sifrei and Sifri.  The commentaries of the Ramban and Ba'al Haturim are largely based on remesh as compared to Rashi who exlictly went out to only give the p'shat meaning of the Tanach. )<br>  <br>  So Kaballah can be genuine- but most of the time what is taught is far from genuine Kabalah.  The Kabalah centre of Philip Berg is a scam and cult.  (I don't refer to him as Rabbi since the place he claims to have gotten ordination from states he never got ordination!  Considering what he is doing, I believe them- not him!)  Red strings, holy water, reciting verses without understanding them are all nonsense.  The other people teaching Kaballah out there are just as fake (though not all of them are as destructive as Berg's cult).  Madonna might be happy there- good for her, but what she is studying is just something made up by someone with a very superficial understanding of but a few issues- and then elaborated on in a huge labyrinth of fakery to part people from their money!<br>  <br>  Edit:  The links to Kabbalah.info not to genuine kabbalah learning but to Kabbalah as understood by a non-Jew whose expertise in kabbalah is from Moscow university and a PHD from there- hardly a source or font of Jewish learning!  He is not a Rabbi (and to his credit does not claim to be) though his students call him Rav.  He is not as destructive as Phillip Berg, at least he isn't peddling holy water, red strings and other nonsense, but his version of Kabbalah is fake and is not genuine-  how could it be whenhe tries to turn it into a science and divorce if from its core which is solidly based on Judaism?|`|d0f93ace5169bf1fc1696345cdb101c2aa	So far, only emma has really given the right answer.

You may notice words in Judaism and Kabbalah to be similar but after looking more into Authentic Kabbalah you may begin to notice the meaning and interpretation behind the familiar words are completely different. The wisdom of Kabbalah is not a religion, but a science. It is not related in any way to religions, faiths, mysticism, red strings, holy water or clairvoyance of any kind, not even to Judaism. In our times Kabbalah is open to anyone who wants to study regardless of age, race, nationality, gender, culture, etc and not at all restricted to a small circle of people.

It says there that God made a body from the elements of the earth, breathed into it from his own spirit, and the results was a living soul.<br>  <br>  If you look at how the body and the soul relate, you get a good understanding of the soul.  The body has contact with the physical realm (it sees, touches, hears, etc.) and passes that information on to the soul.  It is there that the soul (or mind) makes decisions based on that information, and determines what the body does.  <br>  <br>  The spirit is similar to the body, in that it has the part that sees, touches, hears, etc in the spiritual realm.  It passes spiritual information on to the soul, and the soul then makes moral decisions based on that information.  <br>  <br>  The Bible refers to the soul as the "conscience", which technically means a place of "two knowledges".  It is the part of man that process the information from the physical and spiritual and makes the decisions that determin what you do.<br>  <br>  In Hebrew 4:12, it says that the word of God is able to separate between the soul and the spirit.  It says that it is the difference between "the thoughts and the intends of the heart".  In your spirit is where your "intends" or "motives" are found.  In your soul is where the thoughts or decisions are made based on those "intends".<br>  <br>  In 1 Thessalonians 5:23, it speaks of keep the "whole spirit, soul and body blameless before God".  That is because that is the process by which a person grows as a Christian.  At the time of their rebirth through faith, the spirit within them is reborn.  The "motive" of their heart is changed to one that wants to follow God.<br>  <br>  But it can take a while for that information to reach the soul (mind).  IT takes a time of renewing the mind (see Romans 12:2) to teach it to make new decisions based on the new information coming from the reborn spirit and its new contact with the spirit realm.  The body takes the longest to change.  Until the mind (soul) as been renewed, and starts telling the body to do things differently, it is not going to change.<br>  <br>  So the spirit is the part of man which contacts the spiritual realm, gets information, and sends it to the soul.  The soul is where decisions are made based on that information.|`|GAHFiIqSaa	We often apply many names to the same thing.<br>  <br>  The soul is a spirit incarnate (in a material body). <br>  <br>  The spirit is outside the material body.

Go to www.watchtower.org for more info and answers to even the hardest questions. Answers will come from the bible...which is where they should come from ;-)<br>  <br>  “Soul” and “Spirit”—What Do These Terms Really Mean?<br>  <br>  WHEN you hear the terms “soul” and “spirit,” what comes to your mind? Many believe that these words mean something invisible and immortal that exists inside us. They think that at death this invisible part of a human leaves the body and lives on. Since this belief is so widespread, many are surprised to learn that it is not at all what the Bible teaches. What, then, is the soul, and what is the spirit, according to God’s Word?<br>  <br>  “SOUL” AS USED IN THE BIBLE<br>  <br>  First, consider the soul. You may remember that the Bible was originally written mainly in Hebrew and Greek. When writing about the soul, the Bible writers used the Hebrew word ne′phesh or the Greek word psy·khe′. These two words occur well over 800 times in the Scriptures, and the New World Translation consistently renders them “soul.” When you examine the way “soul” or “souls” is used in the Bible, it becomes evident that this word basically refers to (1)?people, (2)?animals, or (3)?the life that a person or an animal enjoys. Let us consider some scriptures that present these three different senses.<br>  <br>  People. “In Noah’s days .?.?. a few people, that is, eight souls, were carried safely through the water.” (1?Peter 3:20) Here the word “souls” clearly stands for people—Noah, his wife, his three sons, and their wives. Exodus 16:16 mentions instructions given to the Israelites regarding the gathering of manna. They were told: “Pick up some of it .?.?. according to the number of the souls that each of you has in his tent.” So the amount of manna that was gathered was based upon the number of people in each family. Some other Biblical examples of the application of “soul” or “souls” to a person or to people are found at Genesis 46:18; Joshua 11:11; Acts 27:37; and Romans 13:1.<br>  <br>  Animals. In the Bible’s creation account, we read: “God went on to say: ‘Let the waters swarm forth a swarm of living souls and let flying creatures fly over the earth upon the face of the expanse of the heavens.’ And God went on to say: ‘Let the earth put forth living souls according to their kinds, domestic animal and moving animal and wild beast of the earth according to its kind.’ And it came to be so.” (Genesis 1:20,?24) In this passage, fish, domestic animals, and wild beasts are all referred to by the same word—“souls.” Birds and other animals are called souls at Genesis 9:10; Leviticus 11:46; and Numbers?31:28.<br>  <br>  Life as a person. Sometimes the word “soul” means one’s life as a person. Jehovah told Moses: “All the men who were hunting for your soul are dead.” (Exodus 4:19) What were Moses’ enemies hunting for? They were seeking to take Moses’ life. Earlier, while Rachel was giving birth to her son Benjamin, “her soul was going out (because she died).” (Genesis 35:16-19) At that moment, Rachel lost her life. Consider also Jesus’ words: “I am the fine shepherd; the fine shepherd surrenders his soul in behalf of the sheep.” (John 10:11) Jesus gave his soul, or life, in behalf of mankind. In these Bible passages, the word “soul” clearly refers to life as a person. You will find more examples of this sense of “soul” at 1?Kings 17:17-23; Matthew 10:39; John 15:13; and Acts 20:10.<br>  <br>  A further study of God’s Word will show you that nowhere in the entire Bible are the terms “immortal” or “everlasting” linked with the word “soul.” Instead, the Scriptures state that a soul is mortal, meaning that it dies. (Ezekiel 18:4,?20) Therefore, the Bible calls someone who has died simply a “dead soul.”—Leviticus 21:11.<br>  <br>  THE “SPIRIT” IDENTIFIED<br>  <br>  Let us now consider the Bible’s use of the term “spirit.” Some people think that “spirit” is just another word for “soul.” However, that is not the case. The Bible makes clear that “spirit” and “soul” refer to two different things. How do they differ?<br>  <br>  Bible writers used the Hebrew word ru′ach or the Greek word pneu′ma when writing about the “spirit.” The Scriptures themselves indicate the meaning of those words. For instance, Psalm 104:29 states: “If you [Jehovah] take away their spirit [ru′ach], they expire, and back to their dust they go.” And James 2:26 notes that “the body without spirit [pneu′ma] is dead.” In these verses, then, “spirit” refers to that which gives life to a body. Without spirit, the body is dead. Therefore, in the Bible the word ru′ach is translated not only as “spirit” but also as “force,” or life-force. For example, concerning the Flood in Noah’s day, God said: “I am bringing the deluge of waters upon the earth to bring to ruin all flesh in which the force [ru′ach] of life is active from under the heavens.” (Genesis 6:17; 7:15,?22) “Spirit” thus refers to an invisible force (the spark of life) that animates all living creatures.<br>  <br>  The soul and th|`|CugCzH9iaa	People have a soul.

I felt so bad and so unloved that I would have done anything to feel love. it ended up in a Circle of meaningless sex. basically, I didn't value myself and as a 30 years old woman, that is the main thing I regret. I had also confused love and sex. So, I think that is why you ppl do it. that want love.

Then he added: “But you have been washed clean, but you have been sanctified, but you have been declared righteous in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ.”—1 Corinthians 6:9-11.<br>  <br>  True Christians today should stand out for their distinctive way of life, just as they did in the first century. Accordingly, Jehovah’s Witnesses strive to adhere strictly to the precepts established by the first Christians. Their efforts to pattern their lives after the teachings of the Bible are noticed by others.<br>  <br>  True Christians are zealous evangelizers, as they were centuries ago<br>  <br>  For instance, the New Catholic Encyclopedia acknowledges that Jehovah’s Witnesses are known as “one of the best-behaved groups in the world.” The Deseret News of Salt Lake City, Utah, observed that Jehovah’s Witnesses “promote strong family ties and develop productive and honest citizens.” The newspaper added: “Members believe in a strong moral code. They believe smoking, overdrinking, drug misuse, gambling, sexual promiscuity and homosexuality are spiritually damaging practices. They teach honesty and good work habits.”<br>  <br>  The Witnesses also take to heart their responsibility to be zealous evangelizers. Commenting on this the New Catholic Encyclopedia says: “The fundamental obligation of each member . . . is to give witness to Jehovah by announcing His approaching Kingdom. . . . To be a true Witness one must preach effectively in one way or another.”<br>  <br>  Clearly, true Christianity is much more than membership in one of the many religions of Christendom. Jesus himself foretold the rise of counterfeit Christians. (Matthew 7:22, 23) Jehovah’s Witnesses invite you to learn what Jesus taught and put it into practice. That is what it means to be a Christian. Jesus said: “If you know these things, happy you are if you do them.”—John 13:17.|`|f8mLpPXlaa	Not sure what kind of evidence you're looking for.

Sin is any action or attitude that falls short of God's perfect standard. Every one of us has the problem of sin (Romans 3:23). And the Bible teaches us that there is a consequence to sin - sin separates us from a holy God (Habakkuk 1:13). In fact, the Bible tells us that end result of sin is death (Romans 6:23) and that there is nothing that we ourselves can do to solve the problem of sin. <br>  Second, the Bible says that there is a solution to the problem of sin, and that solution is the person of Jesus Christ (Romans 6:23). The Bible tells us that God loved us so much that he sent Jesus, His only Son, to die in our place (John 3:16). Jesus paid the penalty of your sin so that you would not have to be forever separated from God (I John 4:10). The Bible also tells us that Jesus is the only solution for our sin problem (John 14:6). <br>  Third, the Bible demands a decision. It is not enough to just know about Jesus Christ and His death on the cross for you. You must choose to put your trust in Christ, to receive this free gift of salvation that God offers (John 1:12). <br>  All of us have the problem of sin. There is only one solution to the problem - the person of Jesus Christ and His death on the cross for us. Every one of us must decide... <br>  What will you do with Jesus Christ? <br>  You must make a decision. What are your options? There are only three possible answers to this question: <br>  1. To say yes, to accept God's free gift of salvation by putting your trust in Jesus Christ. <br>  2. To say no, to reject God's offer of salvation. The Bible says that those who make this choice will spend eternity separated from God in a place called Hell. <br>  3. To say maybe, to try to put off the decision to a more convenient time. The Bible does say that God is patient, wanting everyone to come to the point of accepting His gift of salvation (II Peter 3:9). But none of us is promised that we will be here tomorrow, and because of this "x-factor" of death, trying to put off our decision by saying maybe automatically puts us in the "no" category. <br>  So, in reality, there are only two answers to the question, "What will you do with Jesus Christ?" To accept His free gift of salvation or to reject that gift. <br>  Let me ask you, "What have you done with Jesus Christ?" If you have never accepted God's offer of eternal life, I can think of no better time than right now (II Corinthians 6:2). If you would like to say yes to Christ, you can do it right now, wherever you are, whatever you are doing. Join me in our prayer room to talk to Him and invite Him into your life. <br>  The invitation is open - you can accept the gift of salvation and get rid of the sin in your life. It doesn't matter what you're doing or what you've done. The offer is open to everyone. <br>  If you've come this far, you probably realize you're about to make the most important decision of your life. <br>  Jesus said, "Come to me, all you who are weary and burdened, and I will give you rest." He also said, "whoever comes to me I will never drive away." <br>  So if you ask Him, you will be accepted. <br>  The way believers talk to the Lord is through prayer. Your prayer should be your own, from your own heart to His. If you're not in the habit of praying, though, you may need an example. <br>  An example of such a prayer may go something like this: <br>  Father in Heaven,<br>  I know that I am a sinner<br>  and need forgiveness.<br>  I believe that Your Son Jesus<br>  died in my place,<br>  to pay the penalty for my sin,<br>  and rose again for my salvation.<br>  I want to turn from my sinful ways,<br>  so I now ask you,<br>  Lord Jesus, to come<br>  into my life as my Savior<br>  and my Lord.<br>  In Jesus name I pray, Amen.<br>  The Bible says, "Everyone who calls on the name of the Lord will be saved." So if you have asked Him into your life, and believe He died to save you, you are a Christian, bound for Heaven.|`|JCjCllmraa	By being discriminative to blacks and homosexuals, and running in fear from atheists and pagans.|`|ubsq8O8Baa	Jesus said "forgive your enemies and pray for them". that's what i did and am proud to be called christian after doing so.|`|AA11849917	Jesus said, "They (meaning the world) will know you are my disciples when you show love one for another."

Jesus was not a Christian he died a 100 % Jew... Saint Paul is the one that invented Christianity the way we know it today...<br>  <br>  Almost anybody can be a Christian the Clergy and the Preachers have a way to make you a Christian in no time, but Jesus was telling everybody that only very few of them will make it into Heaven... the rest will sizzle in Hell for ever and ever.  You must remember that “salvation” is a fair weather deal in the Bible. It is not applicable to anybody in peril of his/her life. To be “saved” in the Bible involves a well defined personal effort accepting the claims of the person doing the salvation. In real life such a person in peril of his/her life may not be in condition to answer questions or to cooperate in the least with the savior and the savior must do all the work of salvation if he/she is serious about “saving” anybody!  NOT SO IN THE BIBLE STORIES!!!  <br>  <br>  Matthew 7:13-14 (Jesus said) "Enter through the narrow gate. For wide is the gate and broad is the road that leads to destruction, and many enter through it. But small is the gate and narrow the road that leads to life, and ONLY A FEW FIND IT.<br>  <br>  Jesus NEVER made it easy for anybody to find the small gate and narrow road. And of the “ONLY FEW WHO FIND IT”… not all of them will be able to get in... Good conduct has nothing to do with “finding the narrow door” to Heaven! <br>  <br>  Luke 13:23-24 (NIV) Someone asked him, "Lord, are only a few people going to be saved?" He said to them, "Make every effort to enter through the narrow door, because MANY, I tell you, WILL TRY TO ENTER AND WILL NOT BE ABLE TO* (*Isn’t God the Son Jesus Christ a first class teaser?). <br>  <br>  The few who find the small gate and narrow road to Heaven need to hate their own family and everybody else in the world to follow Jesus! Never mind that the 10 Commandments say, “Thou shalt honour thy father and thy mother!”…   <br>  <br>  Matthew 10:34-37 niv<br>  "Do not suppose that I have come to bring peace to the earth. I did not come to bring peace, but a sword. For I have come to turn <br>         “'a man against his father, <br>         a daughter against her mother, <br>         a daughter-in-law against her mother-in-law— <br>  your enemies will be the members of your own household.' "ANYONE WHO LOVES THEIR FATHER OR MOTHER MORE THAN ME IS NOT WORTHY OF ME; ANYONE WHO LOVES A SON OR DAUGHTER MORE THAN ME IS NOT WORTHY OF ME.<br>  <br>  Luke 14:26 (NIV) Jesus Christ said, "If anyone comes to me and does not HATE* (*Greek=”miseo”=to abhor!) his father and mother, his wife and children, his brothers and sisters--yes, even his own life--he cannot be my disciple."<br>  <br>  Luke 14:33 (NIV) In the same way, ANY OF YOU WHO DOES NOT GIVE UP EVERYTHING HE HAS CANNOT BE MY DISCIPLE.<br>  <br>  Most Christians today don’t stop like Saint Peter did to reflect on the possibility that they might be phony Christians… <br>  <br>  Mark 10:28-30 (NIV) Peter said to him, "We have left everything to follow you!" "I TELL YOU THE TRUTH,"* (*duck!) Jesus replied, "no one who has left home or brothers or sisters or mother or father or children* (*the SOB Bible writers are promoting the total neglect and rejection of child support!) or fields for me and the gospel will fail to receive a HUNDRED TIMES as much in this present age [RIGHT NOW!!!] homes, brothers, sisters, mothers, children and fields--and with them, persecutions* (*from former abandoned wives and children! Spiritually speaking, of course! Hard core Christians ignore a lot of Jesus’ rules that they need to follow to go to Heaven when they die!)  and in the age to come, eternal life. (TRUE! Most preachers are making a considerable fortune preaching the Gospel…! The rest are the “dedicated” more gullible not so lucky ones just content to make a living on it!)<br>  <br>  Plus…<br>  Matthew 18:8 (NIV) Jesus Christ said, "If your hand or your foot causes you to sin cut it off and throw it away. It is better for you TO ENTER LIFE maimed or crippled than to have two hands or two feet and be thrown into eternal fire."<br>  <br>  Apparently, there isn’t going to be any cripple person in Hell! Not only that, but according to God the Son Jesus Christ many Christians ought to consider plain castration for the “kingdom sake” (Check “castrati” on Wikipedia!)…  Sweet Jesus recognizes such efforts and hints his approval in spite of the fact that God the Father in Heaven said that no eunuch will come near him! So there will be segregation in Heaven, but what the heck Jesus is that counts!<br>  <br>  Matthew 19:12b (KJV) (Jesus said)…and there be eunuchs* (*castrated guys), which have made themselves eunuchs for the kingdom of heaven's sake. He that is able to receive it, let him receive it.  <br>  <br>  Nobody beats the Bible writers at Jesus making political promises payable in this lifetime if you wish to follow him! The acid test comes when Jesus finds out that you are neither hot nor cold and he pukes you out of his Holy Belly (Rev 3:16).  Just to make sure that you understand that this opportunity of going to Heaven is a one shot deal, the Bible writers are saying that only a dog goes back to eat its own vomit! But what the heck! Christians are trained to love Jesus, anyway!<br>  <br>  Most preachers today poach verses here and there to make Christianity palatable to everybody.  All that you hear now is that Jesus wants to make you rich and healthy so the rest of the Bible is ignored! Christianity is a multibillion dollar business, too for the smart preachers and they don’t have to be guys in the closet advising our National Leaders!|`|AA11220299	According to the Bible the evidence of a Christian is one who lives a righteous life.<br>  1 John 3:10     By this the children of God and the children of the devil are obvious: anyone who does not practice righteousness is not of God, nor the one who does not love his brother.|`|AA10192697	I show it by my actions and words.

SZdVYrSSaa	You will be very much helped by psychology. <br>  <br>  Here are a few things to remember. Firstly, your psychologist must maintain a doctor-client privilege with you by law. Unless you tell them you have a bomb or a gun and are plotting to commit some horrible crime, there is no situation in which they can repeat anything you tell them unless you ask them to, even if you are a minor. <br>  <br>  Psychology only works if the doctor has the whole truth. Tell them EVERYTHING, every detail, no censorship. That means, if you want to have sex with someone, don't just say you do, tell them how, if you want to be tied up to the bed and covered in come, then say that. It will only help them help you. They are not there to judge you, for anything, and they are not there to hurt your life. They are there to be the friend you can tell anything to, the person who will help you no matter what you need, the person you don't have to worry about offending or hurting. When you go in, establish that there are portions of your life that are secret and that you don't want your parents told about what goes on in the meeting between you, and that if this is violated, you will not see them anymore. They will agree...<br>  <br>  Secondly, make sure you are seeing a psychologist, councilor, or psychotherapist. DO NOT go to a psychiatrist, they will just give you corrective drugs, and for depression this needs to be a LAST RESORT. You can tell your doctor this, simply say that you are there for depression, and that there is a lot on your mind, and that you want to talk it out. Be VERY clear that medication is not something you are interested in unless they feel that there is NO OTHER option. At Yale, the first thing we learned about depression is that treating the cause of it will be almost impossible if you medicate the patient, because the drugs will prevent them from feeling out the problem and correctly being able to tell you what they think is wrong. It will not help you in the long run.<br>  <br>  Seriously, I rarely speak like this on here, but my advise is very solid in this subject. You are young, and if your doctor is suggesting you see a therapist, then you will regret not getting help in the future if you decide not to do it. <br>  <br>  Be clear, be honest, get EVERYTHING off your chest that you can think of, even if you think it sounds stupid. This may be one of the only people I can say this about, but you can trust this person with your deepest secrets, and I mean that. You will feel 100% better once you deal with what is going on, and working closely with someone impartial, who knows this field well, can only benefit you. <br>  <br>  Please give it a lot of consideration, and I know you'll make the right choice. Best of luck, and feel better, kiddo!|`|hPvXdd7raa	I'm guessing your parents are unaware your gay. I would recommend letting them know - but I'm not really sure of your current situation...<br>  <br>  You should be able to visit a Psych without them knowing, but that is depending on the freedoms they allow you. You can always say things such as study groups, hanging with friends, sports, etc.<br>  <br>  But don't keep it bundled up inside, that won't help anything.<br>  <br>  Good luck dude.|`|Q6UQ5BbZaa	If your doctor recommended it then you should probably go.|`|tZF64L7yaa	A therapist can help some people, and then others...not so much You have to make sure the person you're talking to is gay friendly, for example, or that they understand what you are going through, otherwise it can make you feel horrible about yourself. But go to a psychologist only if you do go. Try to find them through a gay friendly reference online. Psychiatrists notoriously try to put kids on meds.<br>  <br>  I am not a medical expert. but..You know, I'd really stay away from psychological medications. Like antidepressants. They can have unpleasant side effects, but mostly the people I've known who took them...they just seemed...worse. They get on these coctails of antidepressants and anxiety drugs, and maybe...maybe there was nothing "wrong" with the individuals to begin with. Maybe it was truly everybody else. Maybe the kids' parents really did treat them like crap, or their parent abandoned them. Maybe the kids' friends really did abandon the kid. Maybe the kids at school really were mean. Maybe the person really did have a crappy life. Why is it always the patient who is considered having the problem. Is it not normal to be miserable if confusing, scary, or sad things occur in your life. Of course people are going to feel awful when stuff happens. I think it just means you have feelings...and that's a good thing. <br>  I hated when they medicated soldiers. There was a girl my sister knew who was in Iraq. She got depressed because of an incident with a kid and a weapon and the soldiers had to kill to protect people and the kid died. Of course the soldier girl was depressed. She had to participate in killing. She wouldn't be very human if she was able to do it without feeling bad about it. So, why the hell did they medicate her for a normal human reaction?<br>   Why do psychiatrists give kids a multiple choice test and talk to the kids' lying parents and then try to make the kid take pills based on barely even talking to patients. You can tell I don't like Pschiatrists.<br>   The best thing to do is to accept being gay. It's awesome. Watch cool shows with gay characters. Like old Will and Grace reruns. Or other programs or movies with gay characters. Try to think of being gay as a normal thing. Try to enjoy who you are. You are different and beautiful and special. Why does society have to try to make you feel bad about yourself just because you think men are attractive. I am bi and think that all people can be beautiful and can understand both sides. I think you need to go to a GLBT center and take part in activities or volunteer and work with other gay people so you see it's good and wonderful. Help fellow gays, too. If your town doesn't have a Gay Center, when you're 18 in a few months, move and go to a town that does. Life's too short to be so miserable. <br>  Oh, and If you are sick, then keep bugging the doctors to figure out what is wrong. The squeaky wheel gets fixed. Sometimes being depressed can give you physical symptoms. Try walking or light jogging if your health allows it, exercise is good for depression.<br>   Get blood tests. Make sure you go to an internist, not just a general practitioner. My friend got sick as a teen and he was getting fatigue, joint and muscle pain, and it turned out he had a genetic autoimmune disorder, Lupus. It was rare in men, but some of those autoimmune disorders are tough to diagnose. Do you have bad allergies or asthma? High blood pressure? There are so many things that are treatable, but they can make you feel pretty sick. I've had mono twice, and felt horrible for months both times. I've had recurring strep throat that made me feel terrible. Some people get vitamin deficiency and get bad symptoms, iron deficiency can happen if you're a vegetarian, or you can get vitamin d deficiency if you never go outside. some people get horrible migraines, or even silent migraines that just leave them with odd symptoms like vision loss in an eye, or tingling in their heads or dizziness. Make sure you're eating properly. You didn't really mention your symtoms, but sometimes anxiety can even be the result of a side effect if you're taking medicine for something else. I can't take Zyrtec or Allegra (allergy meds). They make me feel all anxious. I have to take Benadryl instead. Sometimes decongestants can cause problems. I used to take em a lot when I was young, but they were speeding up my heart rate. Also, acid reflux problems or stomach spasms from anxiety can make you feel bad.

lqP9ayLKaa	Some people reject evolution for no other reason than their pastor told them that the theory means they came from monkeys and challenges the inerrant word of their god. These people are not used to learning things, or questioning authority, so haven't realised that none of this is actually true.<br>  <br>  Evolution makes no claim on source of life on earth. It is about the "descent" of species not the origins of life. Evolution is not the same as the big bang theory. Evolution is consistent with all the laws (and theories) of physics including string theory and chaos theory - if anything chaos theory adds a massive amount of support to evolutionary theories. To date nothing has been discovered that falsifies the theory of evolution. Nothing had to "evolve fast" to support ecosystems. Natural Selection is not "deductive" and how on Earth does SR/GR disagree with evolution? The idea that any other branch of science would prove evolution wrong but is ignored is just insane.<br>  <br>  Equally the idea that reciprocal altruism is not supported by evolutionary theories is insane and can only be put forward by people who know nothing about evolution or the behaviour of animals. Interestingly, the most vehement opponents of evolution are rarely altruistic outside their closed groups...<br>  <br>  Quotemining (without context) from 20+ year old articles is misleading. Years ago, before fundies polarised the world view, people were looser with their terminology. Feel free to show the "growing number" of evolutionists who think that evolution is not a scientific theory. <br>  <br>  Creationism is not a scientific theory. It makes no testable predictions (which evolution does, and has) and it answers nothing in a better manner than any other scientific theory. It is not the "alternate" choice for evolution. Even if evolution is ever falsified, creationism would still be unscientific. Creationists have nothing positive to bring to the party and rely on nothing more than fear, uncertainty and doubt.|`|baQodlHWaa	Well if you accept theories until proven false, I'm guessing that those who follow creationism are going to follow that theory until it is absolutely proven false as well.

Remember that the book of Genesis was written a few thousands of years before the advent of modern science. Therefore, the Holy Bible has no real "science" in it.

Scientists do not know how that happened.”—The Enchanted Loom: Mind in the Universe (New York, 1981), p. 19.<br>  <br>  Evolutionist Loren Eiseley acknowledged: “After having chided the theologian for his reliance on myth and miracle, science found itself in the unenviable position of having to create a mythology of its own: namely, the assumption that what, after long effort, could not be proved to take place today had, in truth, taken place in the primeval past.”—The Immense Journey (New York, 1957), p. 199.<br>  <br>  According to New Scientist: “An increasing number of scientists, most particularly a growing number of evolutionists .?.?. argue that Darwinian evolutionary theory is no genuine scientific theory at all. .?.?. Many of the critics have the highest intellectual credentials.”—June?25, 1981, p. 828.<br>  <br>  Physicist H. S. Lipson said: “The only acceptable explanation is creation. I know that this is anathema to physicists, as indeed it is to me, but we must not reject a theory that we do not like if the experimental evidence supports it.” (Italics added.)—Physics Bulletin, 1980, Vol. 31, p. 138.<br>  <br>  Above all, I believe the Bible to be the inspired world of God and I trust it's creation account of 6 creative periods, not 6 24 hour days. 2 Timothy 3:16|`|1c76cd87771103aee19c4f7d36a36a65aa	ok well i believe that things improve over time, the only thing i dont agree with is that we came from monkeys, im sorry it just sounds stupid to me, id radther beilievee in the creator and his word|`|czdCtTvWaa	Do you accept all theories?<br>  <br>  Edit: Well does the theory of eveloution state how life first came to existance?|`|FhHklqkhaa	rev talks about intolerance yet he's ok with hanging whole groups of people|`|Hwe4MA6Faa	I dont 'believe" in it and I have a right to be skeptical of it, as a truly inquisitive scientific mind should be.<br>  <br>  Some problems I have is this, plants had to evolve fast enough to supply oxygen to animals for them to survive and thrive and evolve, this means trees and forests had to be around long before oxygen breathing organisms could be successful so the atmospheric air ratio could be right for them. <br>  I have questions as to how DNA could add traits when Natural selection is deductive of pre existing life forms and the stability of Earths atmosphere for 6.5 billion years or less for us to evolve from single celled organisms had to be pristine.<br>  Why are there only four human like fossils which we can take as evidence of evolution from, shouldnt there be more?<br>  <br>  To believe this wholeheartedly would be to reject the chaos theory, string theory, abd theory of relative and special relativity.   <br>  That's my opinion.

Even Jesus in the garden of Gethsemane was quoted to have asked for that which he knew he could never have...  and then said, "Not my will BUT THINE be done."  Why?...

Am I to count you as a believer?”<br>  <br>  The atheist looked directly into the light.<br>  <br>  “It would be hypocritical of me to suddenly ask you to treat me as a Christian now, but perhaps, could you make the BEAR a Christian?”<br>  <br>  “Very well,” said the voice.

wnSvjwWuaa	I understand where you're coming from, thanks for expounding on your points quite succinctly.<br>  <br>  You are right, of course, that even if homosexuality WAS a choice, no gay person should be persecuted for choosing that choice. After all, when a gay man falls in love with another man freely and willingly, and both are adults, no one should give a flying fig what goes on between them, period. And thank you, for adding the "cough, cough" to the notion that America is the "land of the free"...to which I will add a "wink, wink".<br>  <br>  The strength of some of homophobia's staunchest arguments is rooted in the "choice" argument, because they liken choosing homosexuality in the same vein as choosing to murder another human. Logical persons can easily see through the faultiness of this logic - the only logical comparison should be that straight people also choose their orientation - but unfortunately, fear, ignorance and religious indoctrination seem to put a low premium on logical thinking and reasoning, hence they liken gay people to rapists and murderers.<br>  <br>  And in their own warped logic, they assume (from the wrong assumption) that if you "chose" to be gay, you are choosing "evil" or choosing "to sin".<br>  <br>  Hogwash.<br>  <br>  What we need are scientific facts, cooler heads and massive education initiatives to truly inform the public as to what homosexuality is truly about. It's nothing more than a sexual orientation, it is inherent in people (just like being straight is), it shouldn't be a major factor in deciding where to work, who to hire, how to conduct oneself, and it certainly is no excuse to harass, antagonize and even kill people, on the basis of the fact that "they're gay, they deserve to die".<br>  <br>  Facts are what we need.<br>  <br>  Science has been clear about this: There is NOTHING wrong with gay people. (Just go to the American Psychological Association website for papers and research in this area.)<br>  <br>  When are we going to stop mulling over the insignificant things?|`|7aK81hsbaa	i agree with you. what if it is a choice? so what??????? that doesn't make it wrong to me. and i'm ts les! choice or genetic, who cares?  it's OK!|`|syIp6d2Naa	It takes time for people to change the way they view things. Just telling a person something doesn't mean they will accept or believe you. How long has it taken to have finally come to the point that we have a president that has black heritage as well as white. People normally don't like change it disturbs their patterns and the unknown is scary to them, so they fight against it. Then add on the teachings of the different religions and you are now facing people who have been programed for years that this is wrong. I happen to be an ordained minister as well as being a lesbian and do not feel we are going to "burn" for being true to ourselves. God don't make mistakes, if it were a mistake there might be one in a million. There are to many of us to be a mistake. I think God has his plan for us as well and that if you lead a good life, one of honesty, truthfulness, service to those in need, faithfulness to your partner, belief and faith in Him he will not turn from us. Now add to that the fact the government would come out ahead financially if they would go ahead and make gay marriage legal it leaves you wondering what the real agendas are in Washington.|`|FtVRYkI4aa	I think it is changing little by little... more people are accepting the gay community lately.<br>  <br>  I think the reason is that straight people may think that it is a choice because they don't feel what a LGBT person feels, so we have to explain to them.|`|425ca8dc150991adaf3ef229478796cdaa	Many Christians also insist that their understanding of Judaism is superior to the Jewish one.<br>  <br>  Go figure.

In fact, it's not proven you're born with homosexuality either, and in my personal opinion, I think that's also not the case. Personally, I believe people get accustomed to the gay lifestyle or develop feelings for people of the same gender overtime. I'm not trying to say anything offensive here. I merely believe it is a lifestyle accommodation because for example, I'm straight, but I do not know of any genes that made me straight. Growing up, I was basically accustomed to a straight lifestyle, and thus found myself being attracted to guys. Sure enough, true homosexuality isn't chosen as a majority because you can't train your body to simply be attracted the same gender overnight, however, that doesn't mean it isn't possible. The reason why I doubt one isn't born homosexual is because no genes exist based on what we are attracted to. For example, it has been documented that some people have arborphilia, which is a sexual attraction to trees. I highly doubt it would be in a person's genes to be sexually attracted to trees because for one, we are mammals, not plants and therefore, we cannot reproduce with them anyways. <br>  <br>  Well, the same could be said for homosexuality. *Sure enough, our body could provide us with the organs needed to reproduce and the natural hormones to get into the mood TO reproduce, but the body doesn't necessarily have a requirement as to what person, object, or etc, is needed TO get us in the mood. Therefore, my 'accommodation' opinion is supported. * As for homosexuality being a choice, it's possible because my cousin for instance was a prostitute, and she felt she had to do things with females to make more money. Eventually, she got accustomed to her actions, and thus became bisexual. As for your question, well, no one said they were supposed to defend themselves. It's only a natural reaction. For instance, if someone made fun of you for the clothes you wore, you may say something in return, whether it's about their clothes, or 'shut up.' That's natural defense. Thus, when an entire group is insulted, they naturally defend themselves. In America, the 1st amendment entitles freedom, therefore, also allowing others to criticize certain behavior. Merely because we have many rights doesn't mean it would be all flowers and roses, especially considering this country's history.<br>  <br>  EDIT: To the person that thumbed me down, please explain, what part of my answer do you disagree with?

I mean who would know better than the people who are actually ARE gay, right?"<br>  <br>  THANK YOU! THAT'S WHAT I'VE BEEN SAYING! I can't stand it when homophobes insist that it's their "opinion" that gay people choose to be gay. Like they think we're all lying to them or something. Or that they know us better than we know ourselves, which is somehow even more aggravating. Its is so gratifying to hear a straight person acknowledge that!<br>  <br>  But anyway, there's a good reason to emphasize the fact that homosexuality is inborn. If it was a "lifestyle choice," we wouldn't deserve protection from discrimination anymore than, say, Goths. Does it sound ridiculous for a Goth to sue an employer who fired her (let's say a family restaurant) just because she showed up for work in pancake makeup, black lipstick, and tons of leather? Of course, because the Goth can always take off that stuff and dress normally during the workday. Because being a Goth genuinely IS a lifestyle choice - they can choose when and where to express their aesthetic tastes, and so can't claim discrimination.<br>  <br>  To someone who believes that being gay is a "lifestyle choice," it's the same thing. To point out that homosexuality is a state of being is to point out that we're gay 24/7. It's more like being black. We all acknowledge (well... the majority of us, anyway) that people shouldn't be discriminated against based on the color of their skin, because that isn't a choice and it has no influence on the quality of a person's character. When we gays insist that we're born with it, we're stating our case for equal treatment and equal rights, building on the now-accepted principles established by the Civil Rights movement.<br>  <br>  This is why it's equally important to drive home to people that it can't be changed, because in the 50's, when homosexuality was thought to be a mental illness, gays were given electroshock treatment and even lobotomies to try to change their orientation. Even now, there are "ex-gay ministries" which I'm sure you've heard about. They use gentler treatments today, but just the act of telling someone that an intrinsic part of who they are makes them sinful and wrong is psychologically damaging.
muX5G72Vaa	Sometimes I speak a bit of Spanglish, yes. lol|`|hvIrXa9Gaa	I do it sometimes with German, but it's more on purpose.

But wait a minute... there are other prophecies far more pressing than a hand out from the anti-Christ...<br>  <br>  According to the Bible writers, ONE SUREST SIGN of Jesus coming back and the Rapture? is the slaughter of innocent children in the end of days! The Bible writers made it into a pattern that before any major event in Bible stories innocent children get slaughtered right and left! This is a primitive trick to scare the heck out of religious people into catching their attention! They wrote that before Israel was liberated from Egypt (there is not a trace of historical evidence outside of the Bible that the Jews were ever slaves in Egypt, but what the heck!) God had ALL the innocent first born children of Egyptian parents slaughtered on the spot without any mercy! When Jesus was born in Judea ALL the innocent male children 2 years of age and under got slaughtered in a way that not even God the Holy Ghost was able to comfort the grieving mothers! It was a massacre of humongous proportions unlike Hitler’s holocausting the Jews! (Mat 2:18) So it will be when Jesus comes back a lot of the wrong Churches will loose ALL their CHILDREN… The Jewish Messiah Jesus Christ will have them slaughtered not in Babylon, but in the Churches! Christians are brainwashed into believing that Jesus doesn’t do that! As far as sadistic religions go not even Islam can match Christianity! It is all in the Bible! Now Christianity survives picking on new make believe “sins” like abortion, equal sex marriages, stem cell research, etc. Even the new President Obama honors most Christian and Catholic clergy dogmas damning gays, equal sex marriage and so on!<br>  <br>  Revelation 2:23 (NIV) (Jesus says in his apocalyptic REVELATION NOW for the last days) “I WILL STRIKE HER CHILDREN DEAD”* (*Abortionists deal only with the fetus when necessary so they can’t beat Jesus at killing babies! Jesus is doing the killing of the innocent children to announce his expected return and at the same time teach everybody a lesson on WHO IS THE BOSS! In our society today Christians are very selective in what they want to believe from the Bible! Their political “PRO-LIFE” stand is only an attempt to disassociate from this kind of Jesus’ REVELATION…!) Then ALL THE CHURCHES WILL KNOW* (*Bully Mafia talk!) that I am he who searches hearts and minds, and I will repay each of you according to your deeds.<br>  <br>  I’m the BOSS says Jesus Christ the LORD and I take it on the kids in the Churches! This make believe Bible Jesus is promoting the killing of children of the wrong Christian brand to set an EXAMPLE! All Christians claim to be of the right faith! Most of them will be up for a big surprise when they find out that thei children have been mysteriously slaughtered! Jesus infanticide mania comes from way back when the Jewish Bible writers had God the Father highly favoring anyone killing the innocent children of his enemies! <br>  <br>  Psalm 137:8-9 (NIV) O Daughter of Babylon, doomed to destruction, happy is he who repays you for what you have done to us* (*Israel) --he who seizes your infants and dashes them against the rocks.<br>  <br>  That is why Jesus Christ knows that the enemies of TRUE Christianity (whatever that is) ought to be killed in their infancy when it is easier to get rid of them! In Bible times hardly anybody practiced abortions because it was easier and much safer to “dash the infants against the rocks” after they are born than having them aborted. Unwanted children were put out without any accountability to anybody right after they were born like it was done in Egypt to the willing Hebrew ladies. Christianity is not much of a civilized religion at all! <br>  <br>  Luke 19:27 (NIV) (Jesus is very excited telling this story… most Christians prefer to ignore, although the Clergy and the Westboro class Christians love it!) But those enemies of mine who did not want me to be king over them–bring them here and kill them in front of me.<br>  <br>  I'm telling you what the HOLY BIBLE writers say...!!! ESPECIALLY IN THE NEW TESTAMENT… that is strongly believed in Christianity today...!!!!<br>  <br>  The Bible writers made Christianity into a very violent religion. “Turning the other cheek” is a joke! They have Jesus suggesting the slaughter by drowning of anybody causing a Christian who is a moron in the Faith to stumble (Mat 18:6)… The shedding of body parts to make it into the Fairy Kingdom of Heaven! (Mat 5:29-30), INCLUDING male castration (Mat 19:12). The carving out of the female clitoris today is still widely done by the local butchers and practiced almost exclusively in Islam! Christian ladies in America are very lucky! BTW virginity and male castration is forbidden in God’s Law “Be fruitful and multiply,” but what the heck! Nunnery stuff is a Heathen sourced idea of the Early Church Fathers. Most Christians today don’t pay attention to Jesus’ gory suggestions, but throughout history many Christians got castrated for the “Kingdom Sake.” See Wikipedia “castration”. Christians are very gullible and willing to do anything that their preachers tell them. Christianity survives today only because it is disregarding most of the primitive and uncivilized pronouncements of the Early Church Fathers. Now the Clergy promote the be good, get well, get rich quick, pay your tithes and offerings on time and when you die you go to Heaven to be with Jesus! In fact, Christians are promised that at the moment that they will see Jesus they will be transformed to be like HIM!!! Like this children killing JESUS! Please give me a break!|`|564d359090a6d360bec9ee3849107a51aa	Obama is not the antichrist. The antichrist comes after Jesus raptures His church/bride.

We've no doubt by now, seen all of your ungodly posts just to stir contention within the masses. None of us are fooled and Armageddon will certainly be a wonderful day indeed for no more wicked ones including those that love mocking God will exist after Armageddon, and those that love him will inherit the earth forever.<br>  <br>  Now you're saying that Obama "NEVER WENT TO THAT CONTROVERSIAL CHRISTIAN CHURCH FOR 20 YEARS"... Now he's Anti-Christ??? Make up your mind, slanderer.<br>  <br>  ANTICHRIST<br>  <br>  This word means “against (or instead of) Christ.” It occurs a total of five times, singular and plural, all of them in two of John’s epistles.<br>  <br>  The subject was not new among the Christians when John wrote his letters (98 C.E.). First John 2:18 states: “Young children, it is the last hour, and, just as you have heard that antichrist is coming, even now there have come to be many antichrists; from which fact we gain the knowledge that it is the last hour.” John’s statement shows that there are many individual antichrists, though all together they may form a composite person designated “the antichrist.” (2 John 7) The use of the expression “hour” as referring to a period of time, either relatively brief or of undetermined length, is shown in other writings of John. (See John 2:4; 4:21-23; 5:25, 28; 7:30; 8:20; 12:23, 27.) <br>  <br>  He thus did not restrict the appearance, existence, and activity of such antichrist to some future time only but showed that the antichrist was then present and would continue on. (1 John 4:3).<br>  <br>  Identification<br>  <br>  Although there has been much effort in the past to identify “the antichrist” with an individual, such as Pompey, Nero, or Muhammad (this latter person being suggested by Pope Innocent III in 1213 C.E.), or with a specific organization, as in the Protestant view of “the antichrist” as applying to the papacy, John’s inspired statements show the term to be broad in its application, embracing all those who deny that “Jesus is the Christ,” and who deny that Jesus is the Son of God who came “in the flesh.” <br>  <br>  Anyone who denies Christ or his existence is the anti-christ (1 John 2:22; 4:2, 3; 2 John 7; compare Joh 8:42, 48, 49; 9:22)<br>  --------------------<br>  <br>  You are ANTI-CHRIST.

Normally it requires lot of patience and time, which every one can not afford while living in this world. <br>  So bhang and other psychedelics, which act as short cuts for achieving temporary detachment from worldly emotions, are being used by many cultures and countries all over the world, to feel the lightness and blissfulness associated with it.

His victory was not just a victory for gay... In 1977, Harvey Milk was elected to the San Francisco Board of Supervisors, becoming the first openly gay man to be voted into public office in America. His victory was not just a victory for gay rights; he forged coalitions across the political spectrum. From senior citizens to union workers, Harvey Milk changed the very nature of what it means to be a fighter for human rights and became, before his untimely death in 1978, a hero for all Americans. Sean Penn stars as Harvey Milk under the direction of Gus Van Sant in Milk, filmed on location in San Francisco from an original screenplay by Dustin Lance Black, and produced by Dan Jinks and Bruce Cohen. Milk charts the last eight years of Harvey Milk’s life. While living in New York City, he turns 40. Looking for more purpose, Milk and his lover Scott Smith (James Franco) relocate to San Francisco, where they found a small business, Castro Camera, in the heart of a working-class neighborhood. With his beloved Castro neighborhood and beautiful city empowering him, Milk surprises Scott and himself by becoming an outspoken agent for change. With vitalizing support from Scott and from new friends like young activist Cleve Jones (Emile Hirsch), Milk plunges headfirst into the choppy waters of politics. Bolstering his public profile with humor, Milk’s actions speak even louder than his gift-of-gab words. When Milk is elected supervisor for the newly zoned District 5, he tries to coordinate his efforts with those of another newly elected supervisor, Dan White (Josh Brolin). But as White and Milk’s political agendas increasingly diverge, their personal destinies tragically converge.|`|VLv3Vzjnaa	It's a movie about the dangers of homophobia and how they lead to the destruction of individuals and society.
acbqsZZbaa	The grapes interpretation comes from a book written in 2000 by language expert Christoph Luxenberg (a pseudonym adopted for reasons of self-preservation!).

This verse invites our attention to the date and to grapes, saying, “For those of intelligence, there is great proof, argument and evidence of the Divine unity in these two fruits.Each vine branch the thickness of a finger will hold twenty bunches of grapes, and each bunch will in turn contain hundreds of sugary grapes, each like a litle pump emitting syrup. To clothe the surface of each grape with a fine, delicate, thin, and colourful protection; to place in its delicate and soft heart seeds with their hard shells, which are like its retentive faculty, programme, and the story of its life; to manufacture in its stomach a sweetmeat like the helva of Paradise, a honey like the water of Kawthar; to create an infinite number of such grapes over the face of the entire earth, with the same care and wisdom and wonderful art, and at the same time and in the same fashion - this proves in self-evident fashion that the one who fulfils these tasks is the Creator of the whole cosmos, and this deed, requiring as it does infinite power and limitless wisdom, can be only His deed.<br>      Yes, blind and stray, disorderly and unconscious, aimless, aggressive, and anarchic forces, nature and causality, cannot have anything to do with this most sensitive balance, this most skilful art, this most wise scheme.

This idea stems from a mistranslation: the Quran says martyrs going to heaven will get “hur,” and the word was taken by early commentators to mean “virgins.” But in Aramaic, hur meant “white” and was commonly used to mean “white grapes,” which the Quran compares to crystal and pearls, and contemporary accounts have paradise abounding with fruit, especially white grapes.|`|joZFuLEwaa	Instead of grapes did you mean to type cherries?|`|YZv8Ub3Haa	In fact, they are raisins.<br>  <br>  Discussion here:<br>  <a href="http://www.abovetopsecret.com/forum/thread434122/pg1" rel="nofollow">http://www.abovetopsecret.com/forum/thre...</a>

She had a little yellow parakeet named Cookie, she told me how the preacher came over one day  and Cookie said "damn" in front of him, she was raising my teen-age half-sister and she would say it sometimes. I remember how she chuckled when she told me that story.      The last time I got to visit my Grandma and Grandpa, my Grandpa took us fishing on a sandbar stream. I don't think we caught anything that day, but remember seeing hundreds of all colors of goldfish swimming in the shallow stream.  We went back to the house and ate watermelon.

However this would mean consequences for your actions and thus judgment and that's what most educators try not to do be judgmental, however they are judgmental in everything else they do they judge what car to drive what is killing the earth and I could go on forever but as you can see, without God You can only believe man can fix things and it's not true. That's why I can't believe they teach evolution which was responsible for racism among the Germans and hitler and killed with no guilt as if they were animals, if you believed in God then you would know all men and women are created equal and that part of our history would not have had to happen. Go fugue. Who is more confused the believers or the non believers?|`|wnsFO3GCaa	Education doesn't preach anything. The preaching is left up to religious institutions. In the UK Religious Education is compulsory in all state run schools. A variety of religions and their histories are studied, analysed and interpreted. Nothing is preached about religion in school and no one is forced to choose faiths or even believe in one. A daily collective prayer is also enforced in school where children from all faiths pray together.<br>  <br>  From your question I assume RE isn't taught in American schools. More Americans believe in God than British do and we are taught about it. At the end of the day it comes down to personal choice and the amount of brainwashing or indoctrination a person is subjected to.<br>  <br>  Also I don't understand your link between nonbelief and arrogance. Everyone has the right to choose. Your opinion that everyone should have the same beliefs as you makes you the arrogant one.|`|LcURWscBaa	There is no correlation between education and arrogance, and educators educate, they don't preach.  You are confusing some very different ideas and words.  And just because the few college students you have met may not believe in God doesn't mean college taught them to think that way.  And humanities has nothing to do with religion either.|`|TAGsuqu2aa	I as well noticed that most college students these days are to busy with school or their social partying life to really be bothered by religion. Only through rough times then maybe a prayer will be said, but it seems as though only when one needs something will they think of him.|`|yyvcryrbaa	college students think they are better than non college students. i go to college there fore i'm smarter than you are. they also think the laws  don't apply to them.|`|KJaa8ya1aa	Most of the college students i know and knew were Christians and  believed and God.

However, it is a fact that there is a direct correlation between education level and religiosity.  The more educated a person, the less likely they are to be religious or believe in God.|`|uuQrhnJ4aa	Education does not preach arrogance. Arrogance is learned from familial & societal ties long before college. <br>  <br>  As for college students' belief in God, there's not a huge difference now vs. 25yrs ago. A belief in God does not mean a person will not be arrogant. There are plenty of arrogant hypocritical believers. <br>  <br>  Education teaches tangible/intangible in all subjects. Humanities do have correct answers; otherwise, tests would not be possible.<br>  <br>  Moreover, education teaches critical, rational, analytical thinking which enables a person to determine fact from fiction. Many ppl are able to discern myth/superstition that their parents or grandparents fell for (no, I'm not talking religion). <br>  <br>  Biology, physics, physical science informs us how our bodies and the world works. Scienctists have learned about many illnesses that have lived in the realm of superstition in years past (like the common cold & cold weather)...not to mention the work in atoms.<br>  <br>  Humanities teach the abilitiy to question & see differing perspectives at the very minimum. Not everything is absolute.|`|IS7Xubkfaa	Education does not preach arrogance.<br>  Go to a bible college and you will find plenty of arrogance and ignorance.

Do you think that people who live on food stamps don't smoke pot? Sheesh. Our Native Americans have a culture all of their own that the white man came along and took it away from them in their own country. I think they should all be very pissed off.  They stay on the reservation in order to remain a tribe. I give them credit. They do try to find ways of making a living while on the reservation which is not easy because they were given the poorest of land which was already there's to begin with just like the land your living on right now.  Read some history on this subject.|`|XVZMXBwNaa	What is it with you, do you have something against Indian's?<br>  Remember they were here first. They got shafted by the Government, and still are.

What do our Native Citizens have to celebrate!!!|`|ZCh0OHuhaa	If they have a perscription for pot it's legal.<br>  <br>  I'm not saying there are not any Indians that abuse the system, what I am saying is that the Indians I know do not ask a ding dang thing from the government.

n9b1Q8boaa	No it makes you lover of retards. That guy is odd!|`|tZF64L7yaa	I started laughing so hard I fell out of my chair. Pauly Shore was so funny. He was so 90s. Oh man, remember Encino Man, and Bio Dome, and In the Army Now, and what's that other one where goes to the farm...uh...son in Law. Pauly shore was awesome. the weasel. anyways. yeah, you aren't gay. I had a friend in college who lived with this black guy, Herb. Ok, now Herb was FLAMING gay. He had man bodies all over his walls. Real nice guy actually, but one day we went to use the VCR and hit play and there was a VHS tape with something massive going into a.. well, anyways, the guy was definitely gay. He also had a white cowboy boyfriend, and this was before that gay cowboy movie, so anyways, Herb had a huge picture of Janet Jackson with her boobs mostly visible next to his bed. Now Herb, as we've established, was gay, but he had the most humongous crush on Janet Jackson only. And could not like any other lady. Otherwise, it was cowboys for him, you know? So what I'm saying is, if you like girls and have one celeb crush, it doesn't necessarily mean you're gay. Just like...Herb was not straight just because he loved Janet. See? <br>  <br>  Or, it is also possible that you are bisexual and like both men and women. That happens, too. I wouldn't worry about it too much. People really worry to much about labels. If you meet someone attractive and you like them, go out with them. And if Pauly Shore makes your fantasies fun, well, enjoy them. Problem solved.|`|Ao52XHjCaa	I believe you have fallen off the spectrum and get your own category.

It turns out that I had beat him and his brother up real bad, where their mother came out and threatened to call the police. We were both 10 years old at the time.

Whoever shall faithfully serve me by the recitation of the Rosary shall receive signal graces.<br>  2. I promise my special protection and the greatest graces to all those who shall recite the Rosary.<br>  3. The Rosary shall be a powerful armor against Hell, it will destroy vice, decrease sin, and defeat heresies.<br>  4. It will cause virtue and good works to flourish; it will obtain for souls the abundant mercy of God; it will withdraw the hearts of men from the love of the world and its vanities and will lift them to the desire of eternal things. Oh, that souls would sanctify themselves by this means.<br>  5. The soul which recommends itself to me by the recitation of the Rosary, shall not perish.<br>  6. Whoever shall recite the Rosary devoutly, applying himself to the consideration of its sacred mysteries, shall never be conquered by misfortune. God will not chastise him in His justice, he shall not perish by an unprovided death; if he be just, he shall remain in the grace of God and become worthy of eternal life.<br>  7. Whoever shall have a true devotion for the Rosary shall not die without the Sacraments of the Church.<br>  8. Those who are faithful to recite the Rosary shall have during their life and at their death the light of God and the plenitude of His graces; at the moment of death, they shall participate in the merits of the saints in Paradise.<br>  9. I shall deliver from Purgatory those who have been devoted to the Rosary.<br>  10. The faithful children of the Rosary shall merit a high degree of glory in Heaven.<br>  11. You shall obtain all you ask of me by the recitation of the Rosary.<br>  12. All those who propagate the Holy Rosary shall be aided by me in their necessities.<br>  13. I have obtained from my Divine Son that all the advocates of the Rosary shall have for intercessors the entire Celestial Court during their life and at the hour of death.<br>  14. All who recite the Rosary are my sons, and brothers of my only Son, Jesus Christ.<br>  15. Devotion to my Rosary is a great sign of predestination.<br>  <br>  Our Lady has 117 titles.

759ae5ae6e1570ab62326b25526ef339aa	I watch some of the news, the History channel, "I Don't Have Enough Faith to be an Atheist" at 8 PM EST (tonight) on Direct 378, but not much else.<br>  I am not trying to be so unrighteous; the other stuff does not interest me. TV and the movies do seem to be control of the ungodly.|`|T6SWGhOjaa	That is so true. Little wonder considering Satan is the prince and power of the air (Ephesians 2 v2, KJV) and the god of this world, (2 Corinthians 4 v,KJV).<br>  <br>  Regarding watching TV, we are in this world but luckily  have free choice. <br>  <br>  Also we can't bury our heads in the sand, we need to be aware of what's happening, in fact we can learn from what we see and read, and think on what is good and true, not what is promoted as desirable.<br>  <br>  I watch TV News and docos, sometimes a movie or DVD and choose carefully, and when anything off comes up I use the remote to get off the AV for a bit, or switch to the AV channel if it's on TV, if you know what I mean. I don't need ugly.<br>  <br>  I prefer not to watch much TV , but when I do it simply reinforces my belief that we are making God cranky, and  these are the beginnings of our sorrows.|`|xR2wnheVaa	Nicole,<br>  <br>  I too have noticed much on TV that isn't beneficial. We are told to "...watch over of heart (mind, knowledge, thinking, reflection, memory) with all diligence..."<br>  <br>  Many of the shows today tend to drag us in the wrong direction, so we choose not to corrupt our minds. The shows we watch are either educational of more like how to type shows. The library has seen much more of us lately and we have purchased older shows on DVD that promote wholesome living. Also, we talk about the bad things if we witness them, things that go against God's Word. And build ourselves up.|`|tqQIcLb5aa	Mostly everything yes. So Christians should content themselves to the minority of programs that do not else be very conscious of what they're watching and keep in mind that was is being portrayed is false (this however is very difficult to do).|`|QIf3E3SKaa	Well you are using the Internet after all.

fmVHpkwoaa	From what i have heard and known<br>  Hitler was beaten by his dad alot.<br>  And his father was jewish(stepfather)...so that is why Hitler killed so many jews...i also believe that is why Hitler hated jews..because his dad was a jew..(stepfather)<br>  and not only did his dad beat him, he also beat hitlers mother.<br>  <br>  The only reason hitlers mother married the stepfather  was because she could not support her self, she was desperate for help.  So she married this man who was a military person i believe, but it was not a good turn out because he abused Hitler and Hitlers mother.|`|qcQm8eIbaa	No, I think his rise to power had everything to do with a disgruntled nation that was so desperate for a way to make their life better, that when someone charismatic said that they had the answers...<br>  <br>  Well, they believed him.

And if you're really going to give guitar a try, also try learning power metal, as it is usually fast paced (Iron Maiden, Iced Earth etc)<br>  <br>  If you think it will take too long to get good enough you might be surprised. I'm a completely self taught guitarist and less than 1 year into playing I was playing Slayer. i bet one could play Iron Maiden after about 4 months of playing guitar. If you have a teacher probably less.|`|mRLYY14Yaa	Try to act kind towards people anyways. Always try to be polite whenever possible (even if you don't like them inside), show them that you are the better person.

You may not know it, but maybe the kindness will come back to you. Isn't that called karma?|`|J9yKiFu9aa	Give up the judgmental attitude. It's not up to you to decide who is worthy of living on this planet.  People have value to others, to the world that you may not see. What are you doing to make yourself worthy?

Other than that, just try not to go insane.|`|7q9gpQpEaa	You find the few good ones and stick with them. <br>  <br>  No point in becoming one of the people you hate; just trying to be a good person yourself encourages other people to be so.|`|Mwhclezaaa	Agreed.  surround yourself with more worthy individuals.|`|HqpIfE3caa	Depends.

Smart people wait and choose to have children - or at least... they don't get pregnant at 15... and smart people don't have a million kids who can then go on to give their genetic "smarts" to future generations. They just have 2, maybe 3... who will hopefully breed with someone smart... to secure more smart people for the future. Not nearly at the same rate of procreating as the stupid people. Stupid people will flood the earth, and smart people will die out... <br>  <br>  Watch "Idiocracy" - it's our future.|`|ce9d90af4bd252d25ce81377df2eecc6aa	Perhaps it is your life circumstances that has caused you to think in this way. What we receive from life is usually how we become. So perhaps it is because you have met the wrong people or been in the wrong places.<br>  Don't be bitter about people.. Love thy neighbour..

You have taken a scripture out of context, and attemped to make a "'doctrine" out of it as so many others have, in various other ways. This scripture was given for the  apostles and early believers to help establish the Christian way, and was fulfilled at that time.<br>  If you want to know more, it will require you to study as we who are true believers do. <br>  Blessings to you.<br>  <br>  From Barnes Commentary on Mark 16:17-18<br>  <br>  Verse 17. And these signs. These miracles. These evidences that they are sent from God. <br>   <br>  Them that believe. The apostles and those in the primitive age who were endowed with like power. The promise is fulfilled if it can be shown that these signs followed in the case of any who believed, and it is not necessary to suppose that they would follow in the case of all. The meaning is, that they should be the result of faith, or of the belief of the gospel. It is true that they were. They were shown in the case of the apostles and early Christians. The infidel cannot say that the promise has not been fulfilled, unless he can show that it never occurred; the Christian should be satisfied that the promise was fulfilled if these miracles were ever actually wrought, though they do not occur now; and the believer now should not expect a miracle in his case. Miracles were necessary for the establishment of religion in the world; they are not necessary now. <br>   <br>  In my name. By my authority, and using the power that would in such cases, if bodily present. This was done: and in this they differed essentially from the manner in which Jesus himself wrought miracles, He did it in his own name. He did it as possessing original, underived authority. See the account of his stilling the sea, (Matthew 8:26, etc.) of his healing the sick, Matthew 9:5,6; of his raising Lazarus, John 11:1. The prophets spoke in the name of the Lord. The apostles did likewise, Acts 3:6, etc. There was, therefore, an important difference between Jesus and all the other messengers that God has sent into the world, He acted in his own name; they in the name of another, he wielded his own power; they were the instruments by which God put forth the omnipotence of his arm to save. He was, therefore, God; they were men of like passions as other men, Acts 14:15. <br>   <br>  Shall they cast out devils. Matthew 4:24. Comp. Acts 16:16-18. <br>   <br>  Shall speak with new tongues. Shall speak other languages than their native language. This was remarkably fulfilled on the day of Pentecost, Acts 2:4-11. It existed also in other places. See 1 Corinthians 12:10,18. <br>   <br>  (*) "in my name" Luke 10:17, Acts 5:16, 8:7, 16:18, 19:12 <br>  (*) "speak with new" Acts 2:4, 10:46, 1 Corinthians 12:10,28 <br>   <br>  Verse 18. They shall take up serpents. When it is necessary for the sake of establishing religion, they shall handle poisonous reptiles without injury: thus showing that God was with him, to keep them from harm. This was literally fulfilled when Paul shook the viper from his hand. See Acts 28:5,6. <br>   <br>  Any deadly thing. Any poison usually causing death. <br>   <br>  Shall not hurt them. There is a similar promise in Isaiah 43:2. <br>   <br>  They shall lay hands on the sick, etc. See instances of this in the Acts of the Apostles, Acts 3:6,7, 5:15, etc. <br>   <br>  (*) "serpents" Luke 10:19, Acts 28:5 <br>  (*) "they shall lay" Acts 5:15,16, 28:8, James 5:14,15 <br>  —Barnes' Notes on the New Testament|`|AA11613315	Well, I speak in tongues, I have laid my hands on the sick and they've been healed, I've been eating peanut butter since who knows when and I'm still fine.

The bible did teach me alote it gives you nowledg and stranths in your smarts, it helps you deal with problems normal people can't deal with, there is power in the bible, it depends on how you choose to use it or take it, Every one is afriad to believe in the truth, it is much more easyer just to be a follower, then to take the hard road, I do not call my self a christian, because i feel like doing so im calling my self saved, meaning im safe from hell, witch can't be the truth, every one is weak and it takes one second to screw everything up around you, when you say your saved thats what your saying, but when you meet people and find out wow what they been doing on the side or sinning, that are christians these are the same people who warship the same god, so for me to be with them and agree that im saved it's weird.

A person cannot prove he is a true Christian believer. IMHO, a true believer has no need to prove it. The Bible says: Walk by faith and not by sight. If you are still trying to *prove* Christianity, pray for faith and the simple ability to accept Christ and  understand the real meaning of His sacrifice for you on the Cross- without so many strings attached. The enemy is keeping you busy blowing smoke and spinning your wheels, exactly his purpose. The message is just too simple for some people to grasp, don't make it harder than it is. In complete opposition to the world view, in Christ, victory comes through surrender. Christianity is all about relationships, and not just between you and God, but you, God and everyone.|`|vBfbwwuDaa	Techaniclly to prove " your Faith " is like proving the meaning of life. impossible. you just have to make a convincing argument. i being atheist belive nothing... dnt need to convince anyone.. but i have read the bible, book of mormon, karan... so you cant say im ill educated in this feild...<br>   thank you|`|7mhRDbvsaa	is saying "holy bible" good enough proof

Ne9rXERpaa	"Hit our planet"?!?!<br>  <br>  You DO know that other stars are TRILLIONS of miles away from us...right?|`|PwHQSAxvaa	How chaotic and random it is depends on how large an area you view. If you look over a large enough section, particles, atoms, stars, planets, galaxies etc, all seem to be distributed with great evenness.<br>  <br>  To the two who mention the estimated 5 billion years of life the sun has left : it is estimated to have 5 billion years left as a yellow dwarf, with a small increase in size, but a vast increase in temperature as the hydrogen is turned to helium. It started off life as virtually 100% hydrogen, but is now about 75% hydrogen, 25% helium (not exact, there are trace metals there too). After this period she will spend about a billion years as a red giant. Vastly bigger than its current size, greatly hotter. But the increased size does not represent gaining mass, so from here what happens to earth is disputed. It will definitely end life on earth due to the heat. The sun's size will increase into our orbital path. Some think the earth will be consumed by the sun, and some that the earth will find a more distant orbit, though still be lifeless, something like Mars is now. As for the sun, after the red giant stage, she will collapse into a small, cool, white dwarf, burning helium. There is no prediction of a supernova stage for the sun, as it is widely believed she does not have the mass required for this.<br>  <br>  The other said we won't be here to see it. Don't bet on it. WE won't be here, but maybe someone will figure out a way to escape the earth and populate another planet. So far, some 300 have been found orbiting other stars. The nearest of those could take 20,000 years to reach using today's technology. But we have 5 billion years to fathom out how to get there, either taking generations of people living and dying on the journey, or maybe inventing a faster way to travel. My money is on humanity outliving the earth.<br>  <br>  EDIT - the whole solar system has been passing through a supernova for thousands of years, and won't exit it for another 20,000 years (interstellar cloud of the local bubble of the Orion Arm of the Milky Way Galaxy). The temperature of the cloud is 6000C, and has done the earth no harm, for possibly the last 100,000 years.

In any case, they did not want God’s representative around.<br>  Elisha endured their jeers and taunts for a limited time. “Finally,” the record says, “he turned behind him and saw them and called down evil upon them in the name of Jehovah. Then two she-bears came out from the woods and went tearing to pieces forty-two children of their number.” How the parents of those children must have wished that they had disciplined them and taught them to respect their elders!

They are much worse than that refuse to believe that their God brainwashed his chosen people forcing them to slaughter and cook their own children for dinner!<br>  <br>  The Bible writers created the story of the Jewish God that is worshipped by gullible Christians today mainly in America. This God forced the Jews to eat their own children for dinner NOT AS A PUNISHMENT, but as an option in times of famine. Not even as an option, but as the “WILL OF GOD!” God NEVER objected about slaughtering and cooking children for dinner. God won’t let the Jews eat pigs, but children YES! The Preachers always cover up anything negative about the Bible God! I dropped out of Christianity and religion after many years serving in the Christian ministry! ANY preacher today has to be very dishonest not to admit any of these facts! The Bible was written to control low IQ religious people who need to pay a 10% (TITHE) crutch to function in this world. Any religion back then was as barbaric as you can’t possibly imagine. The Bible is a hangover from those days... Rather recently America became officially ONE NATION UNDER GOD and IN GOD WE TRUST under Christian pressure after the collapse of the US gold monetary system! <br>  <br>  This Bible God is totally powerless to teach any lesson without FORCING the Jews to eat their own children for dinner. The Bible writers say that Palestine was a “Land Flowing with Milk and Honey” ONLY before the Israelite invasion. The former dwellers used to live in plenty! After the invasion SURPRISE!!! suddenly the “milk and honey” stopped flowing! So now the Bible writers are promising to Israel that “God will make the desert to blossom like a rose!” The perennial carrot hanging at the end of the stick is working!<br>  <br>  God’s sadistic pleasures are the kinkiest ones ever to be imagined! None of the “Godless” dictators in the world EVER thought of forcing his people to eat their own children for dinner...! That is so repulsive that no smut publication is publishing anything like that either, but any pervert preacher can discreetly enjoy reading all about it in the Holy Bible! The rest of Christians are totally brainwashed with the GOD IS LOVE bit! No wonder the Clergy hid the Bible from public view for so many centuries! To their great relief hardly any Christian today pays attention to what they read in the Bible! <br>  <br>  Leviticus 26:29 - (God is impatiently saying) YOU WILL eat the flesh of your sons and the flesh of your daughters* (*without warning of any evil! Christians are trained to believe that no matter how pervert it may sound “if God says it I believe it… and that settles it!”)<br>  <br>  Deuteronomy 28:53-57 - Because of the suffering that your enemy will inflict on you during the siege* (*God is conditioning the mind of the Israelites 700 Bible years into the future! In our society today anybody promoting the idea of any crime like that is put in jail!), YOU WILL EAT THE FRUIT OF THE WOMB, THE FLESH OF THE SONS AND DAUGHTERS the LORD your God has given you* (*God WILL NOT do anything to protect the innocent children, but his chosen people will enjoy eating them…! Praise the LORD! Sweet Jesus… Amen?) Even the most gentle and sensitive man* (*not a sinful homosexual or a Godless atheist, but a CHOSEN CHILD OF GOD!) among you will have no compassion on his own brother or the wife he loves or his SURVIVING children, and he will not give to one of them any of the flesh of his children that he is eating…* (*according to the Bible writers, not sharing is “THE SIN”! Only religious perverts can dream on feeding on their own children for ever!)<br>  <br>  Jeremiah 19:9 I* (*God, NOT SATAN, but GOD!) WILL MAKE THEM EAT THE FLESH OF THEIR SONS AND DAUGHTERS* (This sick God has to FORCE the Jews to eat their own children! During the real historic Roman siege of “Masada” [do Google] all the Jewish families killed themselves before even dreaming about eating their own children!)<br>  <br>  God won’t force the Jews to eat PIGS, but their own children YES! The Bible writers say that when the 666 mark will be instituted Christians won’t be able to buy or sell food without it. Based on Bible precedents, will the heart bleeding Christians of the Westboro orientation eat their own children for dinner? Christians would deny it or say that if God forced the Jews to do it, it was because they were very “sinful”!<br>  <br>  Ezekiel 5:10 - Therefore in your midst fathers WILL EAT THEIR CHILDREN...<br>  <br>  Any secular government would offer its citizens better protection than the Bible God. They would certainly allow them to eat pork instead of children! It took Moses 2 men to carry a single bunch of gigantic size grapes to show Israel how plentiful was the Land of Palestine that they were going to invade (Num 13:23)! Actually that was just another trick in the Bible script to motivate well fed Jews into COVETING* (*the heck with the 10 Commands!) to leave Egypt and to invade the Holy Land. (BTW, there is not a shred of historical evidence that millions of slave Jews ever lived in Egypt or that they ever ate their children!) Now the Jews can eat their own children in the Holy Land for God’s kinky pleasure! Actually, for the pleasure of wanking Bible writers and some freaky Bible readers today!<br>  <br>  Lamentations 4:10 - With their own hands COMPASSIONATE WOMEN* (*GODLY WOMEN…! Not lesbians or atheistic ladies, but “MANY” God loving heterosexual ladies) HAVE COOKED THEIR OWN CHILDREN...!<br>  <br>  Here is a case in FULL EXPLICIT CONTEXT in the Bible that is IMPOSSIBLE for any Preacher to “spiritualize” and make it go away!<br>  <br>  2 Kings 6:26-29 As the king of Israel was passing by on the wall, a woman cried to him, “Help me, my lord the king* (*a God related King)!” The king replied, “If the Lord does not help you, where can I get help for you? Then he asked her, “What's the matter?” She answered, “This woman said to me, ‘Give up your son so we may eat him today, and tomorrow we'll eat my son.’ So we cooked my son and ate him* (*BTW… it came out delicious!!!). The next day I said to her, ‘Give up your son so we may eat him, but she had hidden him!* (*God cursed woman! She cheated!) <br>  <br>  They were all COMPASSIONATE Godly, non-Atheistic, heterosexual women that HAVE SLAUGHTERED AND COOKED THEIR OWN CHILDREN FOR DINNER at the tune of “The LORD is my Shepherd I shall not want” (Psa 23)!<br>  <br>  Isaiah 49:15 “Can a mother forget the baby at her breast and have no compassion on the child she has borne? Though she may forget, I* (*God) WILL NOT FORGET YOU!* (*I’ll make her eat the child! Hey, not even Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde is that scary! God must have a serious psychopathic disorder and ought to see a shrink!)<br>  <br>  The last bunch of Bible writers claim that God the Son Jesus Christ was beaten to a pulp thoroughly tenderized and heavily marinated in Roman soldiers’ spit to become the dignified “Lamb of God” grotesquely nailed totally naked to the Holy Cross. The Romans never dressed the genitals of their victims with a diaper! The Christians need to snack his ROMAN SPIT FLAVORED MEAT AND DRINK HIS HOLY BLOOD to go to Heaven when they die! (John 6:53) The eating of children is part of the BIBLE tale so the forever snacking on the Jesus Christ in the Holy Communion is not half that bad!<br>  <br>  God also promotes the killing of children to get rid of future enemies!<br>  <br>  Psalm 137:8-9 - O Daughter of Babylon, doomed to destruction, HAPPY is he who repays you for what you have done to us* (*Holy Vendetta! The heck with “giving the other cheek!”) --he who seizes your infants and DASHES them against the rocks.<br>  <br>  The Bible writers say that God’s enemies ought to be killed in their infancy when it is easier to get rid of them (Amen?) Needed abortions today are for VERY HUMANE reasons! Notice HUMANE vs GODLY. Godly requires that the fetus be born into a child before he/she can be dashed to pieces against the rocks, or eaten for dinner! <br>  <br>  Isaiah 13:16 (KJV) Their little ones also WILL BE DASHED TO PIECES before their eyes; Their houses will be plundered And their wives ravished…. (Only a few pervert ladies would wish to be ravished? But their children must be DASHED TO PIECES – Praise the LORD!)<br>  <br>  God the Son Jesus Christ is hardly any better than his Daddy God up in the sky!<br>  <br>  Revelation 2:23 (In his apocalyptic “revelation” Jesus Christ says) I WILL STRIKE HER CHILDREN DEAD* (*No abortionist can beat Jesus at killing babies --not fetuses, but children! God the Father forced Israel to eat their children for dinner now God the Son Jesus Christ promised to kill the children in the wrong Churches so they can learn a lesson on WHO IS THE BOSS and to add insult to injury, preachers are getting rich selling books on Jesus’ love for the little children of the world! Today, Jesus Christ would be in jail for bullying about killing any child to favor a particular brand of faith!) Then ALL THE CHURCHES WILL KNOW that I am he who searches hearts and minds, and I will repay each of you according to your deeds.* (*I’m the BOSS says Jesus Christ ON BEHALF OF PREACHERS! Not even the Mafia talks like that in public!)<br>  <br>  Romans 15:4 (Saint Paul says) For EVERYTHING that was written in the past* (*Old Testament) was written to teach us* (*Christians!)<br>  <br>  Today Christians don’t believe that! Christianity is one of the most DISHONEST religions in the world second only to Islam! The Bible is a selection of many books written by wanking perverts! If you have a respectable IQ you ought to know what any religion is all about! I know your first impulse is to REPORT ME! Honest Christians ought to share this post with their spiritual leaders and demand an intelligent answer. Let them be assured that I am not the anti-Christ, or the Devil, or Mickey Mouse, I am just Joe Blow down the street!

Certainly not us. But this is the very heart of God and that is "love". We do not really know what love is. We usually push it more to a sexual thing, but that is not love at all. When we are created in "God's image" (imago dei) we are being created with God's ontology of this love. (characteristics) <br>  The Problem of Pain (C.S.Lewis) is the core of your question. Why would God create beings that would not / could not fulfill the very essence of what was designed into us in the first place? Why pain? Why sin? Because God does not want us to be mere puppets - He wants us to have RELATIONSHIP with Him and in this open relationship He has given us free-choice to choose our own way in life. We can choose to accept Him or reject Him and God allows it. He will never walk away from us. It is us that always walk away from Him. <br>  The problem of pain flies in the face of Christian Theology and is the source of much consternation within the doctrines of Christianity.

He doesn't want us taking off and disobeying him.  When you disobey God, you are making a choice to follow Satan and live a life of sin.  There is no sin in God.  If we sin, that is the choice we made on our own.  It all comes down to choices.  Make the right one and be saved, or make the wrong one which will anger God.  Hope I've helped you.

There was war in Heaven and the Angles fought the evil that had grown and cast them to the end of where his light shown and they were in darkness. There he had to put an end to the ones who fell with Lucifer and a way was set in motion and has been going on ever since. This is Satan’s kingdom and we were deceived to follow him and all he wants for you is death and pain. His seat has ruled the kingdoms of the earth and his final stand is coming where all who won’t bow down to him will be put to death and all who do will die with him in hell.<br>  I believe that we are the fallen angels from Heaven that followed Satan in his quest for his kingdom. Most of us were deceived but as He planted the seed into His best friends and loved ones it grew into a massive vine the encompassed the whole universe. The war in heaven we lost and were cast out and as Jesus my redeemer was planted into the womb of a woman so are we. Jesus says that He knows us before we were born and I believe that this and other scriptures prove that we were before we were born. We spent countless years millions upon millions billions upon billions of years in the paradise in Heaven. We were betrayed by Satan into thinking that He was a God and we wanted to worship Him. There is only one true God and He says that He will show us mercy and let us see what Satan’s world would be like and give us a chance to serve God of our own free will or be destroyed by Fire as the Lord God Almighty purifies His Universe.<br>   I believe that as we find the will of God for us we should step forward and let others know what is going to take place in the next 15.2 years. According to the word we are now into a time prophecy that begins this October and proceeds into the next 3.5 years. The two of them go hand in hand in the last 3.5 years. With the take over of all American land mass the Beast is now set and the last General in place. I believe that these are Great among His followers and do what the word says and kill the masses of people through out the world and only use those that will bow down to the Beast and His image or be set to be killed. Before this time the word says that He will destroy or make away many pleasantly. I used to wonder how this could happen until I read the Pandemic Preparedness and Response Act now the prophecies fit together and the time of the end will start just as God has proposed it and the time of trouble will come upon the whole earth just as Lord God Almighty said it would and that He will blow the final Trumpet and declare the Jubilee of His people the seventy Sabbath years has ended and His word is fulfilled.<br>  The Lord God Almighty says that He will save all that would serve Him instead of another created being that He Himself by Himself through His Son Jesus Created Him. Why would we serve him that only wants evil and death for us instead of the Loving kindness us a Wonderful God? <br>   We find that testing is now going on all over the world as we see another outbreak of this and another outbreak of that. In 2010 the PPRAct will be fully functional and all operations go. As it is written so will it happen, the powers of the world have one goal and that is to destroy all people that they don’t want and those who live will be slaves. I feel like a slave now working to build the earth and His kingdom instead of serving our Gracious God and help bring people to know Him better. Now that I see what is happening my soul burns not only for the souls of others but also the ones that are deemed for death. I pray for those, right hear and now. Remember that we will have ten years of tribulation and it is during this time that the masses will die. All over the world places will be quarantined military will be ordered to maintain all within the boarders and they will destroy us and The Beast orders it as the word says.<br>   It won’t matter what religion or race you are they only need service people and as long as trade goes good and there isn’t a slow down then things will go slow at first but pick up speed. People will be fleeing all over the world. Death decrees will be set every day and as they move upon the face of the earth the destroyer will visit every city and they will kill all that? Who knows you’ll have to read the report and decide what you choose for you and your loved ones. Things are already set in motion the minds of the people are on the world crises that they created as a diversion so we won’t think anything out of the usual. <br>   I think on the fact that the Beast just acquired the land masses of the United States and distribute the bonuses to all its card holders in plain sight and I didn’t see a thing on the internet.

AA12006309	Because it's not, and Christians are mistaken in the idea that they invented and somehow hold the patent on marriage.<br>  <br>  The term "marriage" wasn't even coined until the fourteenth century, which described a "legal contract", not any religious ceremony.<br>  <br>  ALL marriage should be a legal contract, devoid of religious trappings.

It is a legal institution, not a religious one.<br>  <br>  How is entering into a legal contract "participating in what shuns me?"

We are trying to get civil marriage. All couples are required to apply for a civil license for marriage regardless of where it is preformed or by whomever it is officiated. Religious and civil marriages have all the same rights under the individual state laws as well as the federal laws because a religious marriage is a civil marriage granted by the state in which you received the marriage license. <br>  Civil Unions are a completely different thing. They are not recognized by the federal government nor do they transfer from state to state. There are also same sex partnership registries in different cities throughout the USA but they don't even apply to state marriage rights nor are they recognized by the federal government. If you look into marriage rights you will find each state grants over 100 rights to married couples that are not granted to couples that don't have that piece of paper in their hands. <br>  Imagine your partner becoming ill and not being allowed to visit her because you are not a blood relative nor do you have a marriage license. What if you choose to have or adopt children ( which by the way many states do not allow same sex couples to do ) and you can't pick up the child from school when they become ill and the bio parent isn't available. You can't file taxes as a couple to receive tax breaks, you can lose everything you and your partner own if they die without a will or if the bio family contests the will. <br>  There many things automatically granted to married couples that are not available to you simply because you want to love and commit to someone of the same gender. <br>  We are fighting for marriage for many many reasons, one of which is to be treated equal to everyone else. Recognizing our relationships as equal to heterosexual relationships is the right thing to do. Our country has already proved that equal but different is never equal or fair. Our being treated as second class citizens is no less wrong than any other minority group being considered second class.

However with the movement made in the name of Jesus shortly after his death and the people inspired by Jesus I think it's kinda silly to think that a man named Jesus did not exist. In fact it was a very common name. It's estimated that 7-9% of males were named Jesus in the first century. The question of the divinity of Jesus however is another matter.|`|hR7OsqtRaa	Who created Humans.? People may say The Big Bang. Then Who Created the Big Bang.? Particles ? Who created the particles ? I can keep going on and on.<br>  Answer : Humans are not real since there is no evidence of their evolution.<br>  Would you accept the above argument. ?<br>  If I tell you Who Created God, then you would say Who created the one who created God and it would go on and on.<br>  We know God is real, since we are real. If you deny God, then you have to deny your own existence, which is impossible. No matter how knowledgable or intelligent you are, you cannot deny that there has to be a supernatural force that has created our planet and our body and, that creator is God.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  In John 8:58 "I tell you the truth," Jesus answered, "before Abraham was born, I am!"<br>  <br>  The above verse speaks a lot about who Jesus really is.<br>  <br>  There are a lot more chapters and verses mentioned in the below website along with music, speeches and praise and worship.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://jesustrinity.blogspot.com" rel="nofollow">http://jesustrinity.blogspot.com</a><br>  <br>  Jesus is God.

The apostle John says that Jesus was , "...calling God His own Father,<br>  making Himself equal to God," (John 5:18)<br>  6.

And you'd have to admit that the Bible has a rather strong reason to claim he did exist.<br>  No contemporary historians wrote about a person named Jesus Christ. Some historians wrote about a Christ, but at that time in history many people were running around claiming to be the Christ (and none of the historians mention the name Jesus as being that Christ). Other historians wrote about someone named Jesus so of Joseph, but that is like writing about John son of Steve today. Too many other people match the same profile. Also, those historian didn't call Jesus son of Joseph a Christ.<br>  There are disputes about the authenticity of the Shroud of Turin. There is the Church of the Holy Sepulchre, but nothing of Jesus actually remains of him in there.

iXI7n6Gmaa	this is the biggest misunderstanding I found ever in the western minds that they try to repeat, why?<br>  maybe it touches their inner thoughts and inhibitions (wink).<br>  <br>  The Quran does not Specify 70 virgins or anything.<br>  Quran mentions that the bliss of paradise is unlike anything humans know of.<br>  even food though described in a similar manner but it tells that is similar but different.<br>  even our bodies would be different no secretions (no urine, etc) of any type (but a sweet smell of sweat); some people even say those parts are not needed either.<br>  So there will be special women and special children in the Paradise. but the focus was do that what gives you the highest degrees to be as close as possible to God as to see God more often because seeing God is the greatest pleasure ever that can be given in Paradise some people see him multiple times every day and others once a week depending how pious they were in this life.<br>  <br>  the number 7 is a symbol of multiplication for every repeated matter just like a week 7 days that keep repeating. 7, 70, 700 is a multiple is used for rewards.<br>  <br>  this story of of 70 hurees is not in the Quran it is an explanation by the prophet to one man who asked him will there be women in paradise (that is what this person is concerned about) he loved them and he was wondering how many can he get.<br>  <br>  well is not paradise about getting what ever you love what ever you wish what ever you enjoy, so the prophet told him yes you  will get even as mush as 70. (this even could be more).<br>  <br>  So my advice to you is to make sure and be good and loving and faithful so that you attain the highest degrees in Paradise so yo can get what ever is in your mind. (if you attain the highest understanding as an educated person knowing what you want then it will be seeing God in Paradise more than one time and you will have no time to think about anything else) but if you are a faithful with a simple minded then you count how many virgins yo would wish to have, that is ok.|`|febe0c6287fa510d6fa3bec8bbe5201daa	Yeah right. . .<br>  <br>  Islam's most significant contribution to 2008 was probably the terror attacks in Mumbai, India, in which a dozen Pakistani-trained gunmen managed to massacre members of every other major world faith in one fell swoop, including Buddhists, Christians, Jews and a whole lot of Hindus. <br>  <br>  But of all the bloody stories to come out of the incident, perhaps none were worse than the rape, torture, murder and mutilation of innocents at the Chabad House, including the rabbi and his family.

But Muhammed just added some extra things, like, God thinks it is fully OK if a muslim rape his slaves, and some other clever things -like, Muhammed had the right to marry 40 women, including a nine year old (tops), 'cause he was so holy. Things like that. Oh, and the stuff he added seems to have changed a lot of the message.<br>  <br>  Islam is not persecuted, but it is a religion which persecutes others. But you will know others on your self, so the Muslims will naturally feel others are after them. But if you look at the facts: try going to Pakistan, preaching about Jesus. You will be killed. Are muslims preaching about Islam killed? No, they just try making you think so, to turn things upside-down.|`|5sMZrmqjaa	1.   Islam means peace.<br>  <br>  <br>  Islam comes from the root word ‘salaam’, which means peace. It also means submitting one’s will to Allah (swt). Thus Islam is a religion of peace, which is acquired by submitting one’s will to the will of the Supreme Creator, Allah (swt).<br>  <br>  <br>  2.   Sometimes force has to be used to maintain peace.<br>  <br>  <br>  Each and every human being in this world is not in favour of maintaining peace and harmony. There are many, who would disrupt it for their own vested interests. Sometimes force has to be used to maintain peace. It is precisely for this reason that we have the police who use force against criminals and anti-social elements to maintain peace in the country. Islam promotes peace. At the same time, Islam exhorts it followers to fight where there is oppression. The fight against oppression may, at times, require the use of force. In Islam force can only be used to promote peace and justice.<br>  <br>  <br>  3.   Opinion of historian De Lacy O’Leary.<br>  <br>  <br>  The best reply to the misconception that Islam was spread by the sword is given by the noted historian De Lacy O’Leary in the book "Islam at the cross road" (Page 8):<br>  <br>  "History makes it clear however, that the legend of fanatical Muslims sweeping through the world and forcing Islam at the point of the sword upon conquered races is one of the most fantastically absurd myth that historians have ever repeated."<br>  <br>  <br>  4.   Muslims ruled Spain for 800 years.<br>  <br>  <br>  Muslims ruled Spain for about 800 years. The Muslims in Spain never used the sword to force the people to convert. Later the Christian Crusaders came to Spain and wiped out the Muslims. There was not a single Muslim in Spain who could openly give the adhan, that is the call for prayers.<br>  <br>  <br>  5.   14 million Arabs are Coptic Christians.<br>  <br>  <br>  Muslims were the lords of Arabia for 1400 years. For a few years the British ruled, and for a few years the French ruled. Overall, the Muslims ruled Arabia for 1400 years. Yet today, there are 14 million Arabs who are Coptic Christians i.e. Christians since generations. If the Muslims had used the sword there would not have been a single Arab who would have remained a Christian.<br>  <br>  <br>  6.   More than 80% non-Muslims in India.<br>  <br>  <br>  The Muslims ruled India for about a thousand years. If they wanted, they had the power of converting each and every non-Muslim of India to Islam. Today more than 80% of the population of India are non-Muslims. All these non-Muslim Indians are bearing witness today that Islam was not spread by the sword.<br>  <br>  <br>  7.   Indonesia and Malaysia.<br>  <br>  <br>  Indonesia is a country that has the maximum number of Muslims in the world. The majority of people in Malaysia are Muslims. May one ask, "Which Muslim army went to Indonesia and Malaysia?"<br>  <br>  <br>  8.   East Coast of Africa.<br>  <br>  <br>  Similarly, Islam has spread rapidly on the East Coast of Africa. One may again ask, if Islam was spread by the sword, "Which Muslim army went to the East Coast of Africa?"<br>  <br>   <br>  9.   Thomas Carlyle.<br>  <br>  <br>  The famous historian, Thomas Carlyle, in his book "Heroes and Hero worship", refers to this misconception about the spread of Islam: "The sword indeed, but where will you get your sword? Every new opinion, at its starting is precisely in a minority of one. In one man’s head alone. There it dwells as yet. One man alone of the whole world believes it, there is one man against all men. That he takes a sword and try to propagate with that, will do little for him. You must get your sword! On the whole, a thing will propagate itself as it can."<br>  <br>  <br>  10.   No compulsion in religion.<br>  <br>  <br>  With which sword was Islam spread? Even if Muslims had it they could not use it to spread Islam because the Qur’an says in the following verse: <br>  <br>  "Let there be no compulsion in religion: <br>  Truth stands out clear from error"<br>                                  [Al-Qur’an 2:256]<br>  <br>  <br>  11.   Sword of the Intellect.<br>  <br>  <br>  It is the sword of intellect. The sword that conquers the hearts and minds of people. The Qur’an says in Surah Nahl, chapter 16 verse 125:<br>  <br>  "Invite (all) to the way of thy Lord<br>  with wisdom and beautiful preaching;<br>  and argue with them in ways that are<br>  best and most gracious."<br>                                [Al-Qur’an 16:125]<br>  <br>  <br>  12.   Increase in the world religions from 1934 to 1984.<br>  <br>  <br>  An article in Reader’s Digest ‘Almanac’, year book 1986, gave the statistics of the increase of percentage of the major religions of the world in half a century from 1934 to 1984. This article also appeared in ‘The Plain Truth’ magazine. At the top was Islam, which increased by 235%, and Christianity had increased only by 47%. May one ask, which war took place in this century which converted millions of people to Islam?<br>  <br>  <br>  13.   Islam is the fastest growing religion in America and Europe.<br>  <br>  <br>  Today the fastest growing religion in America is Islam. The fastest growing religion in Europe in Islam. Which sword is forcing people in the West to accept Islam in such large numbers?<br>  <br>  <br>  14.   Dr. Jo|`|bloGqdBqaa	cause we're fed up on the benefits you people take.

This, of course, is not just restricted to Islam, many religions have their zealots who claim that God is behind them and everyone else is wrong.<br>  <br>  There are many in the PC brigade, that are causing disquiet among the general populace by making claims, for example, that Muslims would be offended by card makers using the word Christmas on Christmas Cards. I have many, many Muslim friends and they have NO problem whatsoever with Christmas and in fact many celebrate it for their childrens' sake. Remember to that in Islam, Jesus is accepted as being one of the prophets of God. To the ordinary working man in the street such a statement simply gets their back up and we then get people saying things like 'This is a Christian country, and if they don't like that fact then why don't they bugger off back to where they came from?'

People (non-Muslims) want democracy, freedom, a different way of living.  People dont want to pray 5 times a day and if they're female nor do they want to dress the way some Muslim women do, or have their husband having more than one wife. Nor do they want their children akcnowledging a prophet who married a young girl not his age. Nor do women want to be told by the Koran that their husband can beat them lightly. One bad day and he can even kill her.<br>  <br>  Islam has caused upset in society of the past years. Many people feel annoyed that muslims state too much they belong to ''the religion of peace'' but their protests about issues dont show that, they way they treat women dont show that. Their inability to see their wrong dont show that. The fact that there are more Muslim bombers dont show that. Spending more time protesting about those who hate allah and not against Islamic terror dont show that.<br>  <br>  We say ''you're getting violent'', we give them proof, and they say we're ignorant, idiots, anti-muslim and all sorts.<br>  Recall the Muslim response to Danish cartoons, Gaza, 7/11 and other cartoon related incidents. You would have thought as 'peaceful Muslims' they'd peacefully protest. But nothing of the sort.<br>  The Danish embassy in Beirut was burned to the ground. There were death threats against the cartoonists and the editors of papers that published the cartoons. (In London, protestors held signs proclaiming ''Those who insult Islam should die'' and ''Europe is a disease''. ''Islam is the cure.'' They say.<br>  <br>  The blatant lie: ''Islam is the fastest growing religion '' It is yes because of high birth rate amongst Indian and Pakistani Muslim families. Not rocket science.

0aN1xIxfaa	This is a literary device to describe the effect that would have been seen from the point of view of someone standing on earth observing the days of creation. Of course, we know nobody was physically present because the first man had not been created. The description is God's way of informing the first people on earth of what they need to know about their place in the created order of things. It isn't a scientific treatise because it has only been in the last few hundred years that we have come to understand enough about science to produce a scientific vocabulary. If God caused a record to be written that spoke of photons and nuclear fission, then we might have been interested today, but nobody prior to us would have had the foggiest what God was on about! So we have this astonishing economy of words in the Genesis creation account.<br>  <br>  God had created light (singular) on Day 1. On Day 4 He organised and differentiated between degrees of lights (plural). God's separation of light from darkness was a gradation, not a switch being flicked on and off! A celestial dimmer switch, perhaps....|`|1Vih78dZaa	It's really very simple: Genesis (like the rest of the bible) is myth, so it doesn't have to make any sort of logical sense.<br>  <br>  Believers can obfuscate by suggesting the language used in antiquity was inadequate to describe the processes we know now to have occurred during the creation of the universe, Earth and the life on it, but it seems like an omniscient Being wanting to be worshipped would have been capable of saying to his devotees: "First, I made the stars and there was light. Then I made the planets and there was darkness as they rotated. Then I made simple organisms from which I crafted plants. After a very long time, I made animals which got more and more complicated until I finally made mankind," rather than the nonsensical gibberish we read in Genesis.|`|spjDVZgzaa	I think that just means that He created the light.  Without the light, there was only darkness, or maybe he created the darkness as well.  Remember, this is God's world and all things He created, so we know not from where He started.  Think of it as if you we're to create something.  Are you a part of your creation?  Do you have to live by the same rules as your creation?  No!  You make the rules and live free of the rules, because you set the rules in place only for your creation.  That's the way God has set this world in motion.  He lives outside of time, space, light, and the rules that He created for this world.|`|v20S8oSJaa	im no christian!<br>  im a vamp-wolf! im condemed 2 hell for gods sake accordin to dem!<br>  <br>  XXX naomi XXX<br>  <br>  ps. i am a muslim :)|`|0lwGsRNqaa	I can't separate light from dark, but that's because i'm not a god.|`|2337cf819caf07da00ae5d1603695358aa	but not only did he make stars he made them in the dark, thats just showing off!!|`|LpSfwoYfaa	I can flip a lightswitch.

Talk loud enough for the person to hear you. If they decide to play music, yell over to their cubicle that you love that song and ask if they'll turn it up, and then sing along. A little immature, yeah, but hopefully they'll get the hint and buy some ear phones. <br>  <br>  Or, you could buy a whole bunch of [cheap] pairs or ear phones, and then put them all over his cubicle when he's not there.

I think it's okay to speak in general terms about sex to a 15 year old. Because you are not his biological parent, it is your responsibility to discuss all issues you become aware of with this teenagers dad.|`|HH90Eghaaa	Simple when he asks who is the girl, tell him: "since I last checked we are both guys! Unless I'm missing something?"<br>  That should either shut him up or have him ask you in a proper manner!<br>  That's when you tell him its a private matter!<br>  <br>  Next question: Be honest! Just tell him sometimes sex can hurt! Like all relationships we take steps to avoid it!|`|syIp6d2Naa	Your in a bad spot, you need to sit down with your partner and tell him that the odds of his son being gay also is very slight, his curiosity though is creating a problem. If his realistic questions are not answered he will begin to view your relationship and having something wrong about it. I'm not saying answering things like who's on top, that's a private matter. If you can't get your partner to at least considering having a talk with his son, then your only response will have to be that you respect his fathers wishes and can not answer or discuss the questions he has. Being truthful is much better than just ignoring him.|`|FJPKtZN5aa	if he's curious tell him, at least he comes and talks to someone. like if its to private dont tell him, but the "Ryan, is it hurt to have m2m anal sex?" is just curiosity theres nothing really wrong with answering that. <br>  <br>  <br>  but if he feels comfortable coming to you, then you should happy because alot of teenagers would not talk to there parents about stuff like that, so it wouldnt be bad to answer his question|`|bAY9j21Paa	he is 15 years old what do you expect?!  of course he is curious he is a 15 year old teenager. You should privately tell your partner that his son asks you MANY questions about being gay and ask him what he thinks you should do.. make sure he doesn't say anything to his son because his son is coming to you in secrecy and he needs to know he can trust you. My husband had a crack head mom who hung around gay men all the time when my husband was about 15 and he told me how he would ask them tons and tons of questions about it and they answered them all, but low and behold my husband is QUITE  bisexual.. i would say gay however he is marries to me, a girl, and some would beg to differ his gayness. So maybe he is leaning? Just answer the poor boy but ok with his dad first.|`|nisfxpXHaa	It's pretty clear that your partner's son is curious about sex. He is a normal 15 year old boy, he is curious about all things related to sex both straight and gay.<br>  <br>  You are correct that it is inappropriate to tell him about his parents sex life, and you don't need to tell him about your sex life in order to teach him proper sex education. This is also the time that a parent needs to articulate to their child the sexual morals that he expects his son to adhere to.<br>  <br>  You need to have a discussion with your partner about the importance of teaching his child basic sex education.<br>  <br>  This is never an easy topic for parents, there are many great books that your partner could get to help him become comfortable with the subject matter. I'm sure that deep down he knows that educating his child will not influence his sexual orientation. He just isn't comfortable with the subject matter.<br>  <br>  What is most important here is that this child be given accurate information regarding sex, that he learns about the risk associated with sex, that he learns about safer sex, that he knows he can rely on his father to help him navigate puberty and to answer his questions openly and honestly.<br>  <br>  <br>  Good luck!<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  L|`|AGKxNYBeaa	He shouldnt be asking questions that personall to you i.e 'who's the girl...' it sounds like he's trying to get a reaction out of you, anyone knows that's not something you ask.

Don't let him know the answers from other people who might just turn his curiosity into confusion...<br>  <br>  <br>  He deserves a good answer.<br>  <br>  (Don't you think his son might be gay, too, that is why he's very curious about homosexuality....?)|`|82bMFhs4aa	your partner has no reason to get mad..you might as well explain things to him now rather than later..<br>  -good luck|`|W1zxRTUJaa	Well, as a 15 year old, it makes sense for him to ask these questions as they're probably floating around in his head!  Personally, I think you should have this kind of talk with him as chances are, as a teenager, if he doesn't get answers from who he thinks really knows the answers he's looking for, he might go try and get some answers first-hand, if you catch my drift.<br>  <br>  If it would make you feel more comfortable, talk with your partner about it.  In any case, it has to happen, and you and your partner really shouldn't be sheltering him from this kind of thing, especially when such an action could lead to possibly disastorous results.  He's going to be moving out of the house eventually.<br>  <br>  Best of luck with it.<br>  <br>  EDIT:  Excuse me, I probably should mention something about the "Who's the girl?" question.  It really just depends if you're comfortable in answering the question or not.  As he is somewhat you're son, it's probably kinda discomforting, so really its up to you.  Just let him know whats alright to ask, and when too far is too far.|`|fFSad2QJaa	For one his dad undersatnding what it was like do be diff.at an early age "if thats the case" should be understanding and open minded if his son is  wanting to know these things and you should bring up the fact if his son is already asking, better it come from him than someone els.<br>  That would probably give him the wrong answers that you probably dont want him to recieve like for example" you have to choose your partners carfully now a days more closer than usuall because std's <br>  are spreading more freely now than ever too many diseases are even being discovered as we speak so I think its best to at least "you" start out talking with the dad and eplaining to him the situation and why you wouldnt feel right telling him it would be alot easier if he did and would mean more to his son as well that way it makes it sound like he is the key holder and his information is alot more informative than anyone ...streatch that and make it grow on him he will come around and start explaining without punnishing ..besides no parent should want their children afraid to come to them for advice or info,..do we???<br>  cause all that will do is take us out of the loop of whats going on with our son or daughters mind,.. life period ..make them distant in the end i know from experience im not gay but  I do have an open mind if my son or daughter came to me with these questions i would try my best to answer them without judgement and hope i can give them some knowledge on the situation to better help them as human beings and to influence on some level to make the right choices in life and thats all we ..as parents can do,.. love, charrish and understand with a hint of guidence. Well i could go on ,...lol but that should be enough ..lol..so i hope this helps..<br>                                      <br>                                                                             Jack

Anyway it is a very normal attitude specially when it comes to the things of God in relation to some of unbelievers.<br>  <br>  You see, Sir, Christians are not ashamed of the gospel, because they believe it is the power of God for the salvation of everyone who believes.  Christians are sinners too, just like everybody else, but they admitted it, confessed it and they were forgiven of their sins through faith in Jesus Christ.<br>  <br>  They felt the love of God in their lives when they realized that God is not willing that anyone should perish but come into the true knowledge of God. Initially, before becoming  Christians, they realized that all are sinners and they too are qualifiers for punishment in hell. But it was not the reality of hell that pricked their hearts but the fact that the very God, who created man, paid the price of sin of man with His life. It was the love of God that brought them into salvation.<br>  <br>  "For God so loved the world that he gave his one and only Son, Jesus, that whoever believes on him shall not perish but have eternal life."<br>  <br>  "But God demonstrates his own love for us in this: While we were still sinners, Christ died for us."<br>  <br>  "Yet to all who receive him, to those who believe in his name, he gave the right to become children of God."<br>  <br>  Would you like to have assurance of eternal life?<br>  Have you accepted Jesus?<br>  Then pray this prayer:  <br>  <br>  "Lord, I know I am a sinner. I believe Your Son, Jesus Christ, died on the Cross for my sins. Please forgive me of my sins and I open my heart now to receive Him as my Lord, God and Savior and make me a new person. I commit my life to You today. Amen"<br>  <br>  If you prayed this prayer, record today's date and rest assured in the assurance of spending eternity with God.  You can find a Bible-believing and Christ-centered church in your area and you can start fellowshipping with them as you grow spiritually. Do not forget to pray and study your Bible everyday.<br>  <br>  God bless you.|`|po62AbPqaa	why would you want to...think of all the fanatics and loons you would have to deal with if you did <8(   }~~~|`|KNpkY3Pvaa	I guess your not as bad as you pretend to be. you have something against little children?

That depends.  If you're asking straight up penetration, or foreplay, or both?  I think from foreplay to climax would be anywhere from 30 minutes to 2 hours?? I know I can't last much after I climax from penetration.  And the person penetrating me can't last long after they climax from penetrating me either.  That's when sometimes we'll mix it up using toys or other things.  <br>  <br>  So this is a hard question to answer unless you're looking for a specific aspect of sex.  Are you asking JUST about anal penetration or an entire sexual session from beginning of foreplay to the end where you're both too exhausted to continue even though one or both partners may have reached orgasm earlier?? That makes it difficult to answer your question. <br>  <br>  That's why I just said "until both of us are satisfied" because that can be various times and various methods for all kinds of people.

So I don't add random people on my friends list like I do on myspace. If you get on you'll see the difference. If you don't want a facebook, don't get one it's your choice.

Children look to others for clues in how to act, so a very young child might think it funny to take a knife or gun or cannon and use it without understanding the pain it can cause. Repeatedly seeing violent acts makes a child accept this behavior as normal or fun if presented in an animated concept.
AA11135281	What good does God's forgiveness do for those whom we have harmed?  Confessing one's sins to God is a cop out.

NO! Jehovah is not guided by mere sentiment. His mercy has limits. He will by no means forgive those who hardheartedly practice willful sin, not showing any repentance. (Hebrews 10:26) On the other hand, when he sees a contrite heart, he is ready to forgive.<br>  <br>  Hebrews 10:26 For if we practice sin willfully after having received the accurate knowledge of the truth, there is no longer any sacrifice for sins left, <br>  <br>  Jehovah promised regarding those in the new covenant: “I shall forgive their error, and their sin I shall remember no more.” (Jeremiah 31:34) Does this mean that when Jehovah forgives he is unable to recall sins anymore? That could hardly be the case. The Bible tells us of the sins of many individuals whom Jehovah forgave, including David. (2?Samuel 11:1-17; 12:13) Jehovah is obviously still aware of the errors they committed. The record of their sins, as well as that of their repentance and forgiveness by God, has been preserved for our benefit. (Romans 15:4)  When God says “their sin I shall remember no more,” he is assuring us that once he forgives repentant sinners, he will not at some future time act against them because of those sins. (Ezekiel 18:21,?22) Jehovah thus forgets in the sense that he does not bring our sins up again and again in order to accuse or punish us over and over. <br>  <br>  We cannot sin with impunity. Paul wrote: “Whatever a man is sowing, this he will also reap.” (Galatians 6:7) We may face certain consequences of our actions. This does not mean that after extending forgiveness Jehovah causes adversity to befall us. When troubles arise, a Christian should not feel, ‘Perhaps Jehovah is punishing me for past sins.’ (James 1:13) On the other hand, Jehovah does not shield us from all the effects of our wrong actions. Divorce, unwanted pregnancy, sexually transmitted disease, loss of trust or respect—all of these may be the sad, unavoidable consequences of sin.|`|3KD6RRhPaa	How is it possible to just say your repentance prayers and be instantly forgiven???   How many sins did you commit just today and can you remember them all??? Repentance prayers brings the whole atonement into mockery, for the sinner says to God that He did not do  a good job and must return from heaven and do this whole atonement over and over again.....what madness!!!<br>  <br>  Its like you have a benefactor that came and paid off your huge debt which would have cost you your life, and now you do not owe not even one dime, but then you the very next day just carry on telling people you are still in debt?????

I’m in one such group.<br>   Indians know how to deal with these things. I'm not Indian even but when in India, do as the Indians. Because I am foreign I can afford to feed people and street cows etc. But plenty of Indians do this daily. These kids can't get educations so there are few way that they can make money.

Now faith is being sure of what we hope for and certain of what we do not see," (Heb. 11:1). Now have you seen someone possessed by demons? (so called: psychiatric/ mental problems)- Have you seen how demons vanish and tremble by hearing the name of Jesus? it's reality..there is a spiritual world.

60303894b298b261e863d683d3b7c896aa	It is important that we worship God in the way that he approves. Many people believe that all religions are pleasing to God, but the Bible does not teach that. It is not even enough just to claim to be a Christian. Jesus said: “Not everyone saying to me, ‘Lord, Lord,’ will enter into the kingdom of the heavens, but the one doing the will of my Father who is in the heavens will.” To have God’s approval, therefore, we must learn what God requires of us and do it. Jesus called those who do not do God’s will “workers of lawlessness.”|`|1ec32bd76f3584208ce83bf42928a21faa	No.  As New Covenant believers we only worship our Father as Jesus said in John 4:23,24   "But the hour is coming, and now is, when the true worshippers will worship the Father in spirit and truth; for the Father is seeking such to worship Him.  God is Spirit and those who worship Him must worship in spirit and truth."  God is to be worshipped as Father by His children in spirit and in truth.  This means only those who are born again of the Spirit can worship Him (John 3:5,6).  God bless you.|`|E8v4nbR6aa	As long as it doesn't require your free thought and opinion, then yes.|`|0WuoC5xIaa	No.<br>  <br>  Jesus' words at John 4:24 tell show us how we should worship God.  It says: “God is a Spirit, and those worshiping him must worship with spirit and truth.”<br>  <br>  It means that we should allow ourselves to be guided by God's spirit in worshipping Him.  Worshipping God in truth means that our form of worship must conform with his standards set out in the Bible (the truth).  Long before God has hated use of images in worshipping him. (Exodus 20:4; Acts 17:29)  Using those means in worshipping him is not worshipping God in truth.  God also hates worship done out of pretension.  During the Bible times, God has also hated sacred service rendered by his people who does not observe his standards. (Isaiah 1:11-17; Jeremiah 6:20,21)God also requires faith (Hebrews 11:6).  <br>  <br>  From here we can see that God has certain requirements in worshipping him.  Why would God give these certain requirements IF all forms of worships are acceptable to Him?  Clearly, NOT ALL forms of worships are acceptable to God.

XN0cYCATaa	Is masturbation wrong?<br>  The Bible does not discuss masturbation at all.  This seems a little odd since it is such a strong and prevalent human event.  And, given that Leviticus has so much to say about sexuality, one would think it natural that the subject would be covered.  But it isn't.  Masturbation is not specifically declared to be sinful.  Nevertheless, we must be cautious to pronounce something to be sinful or not sinful when God has not discussed it.  Therefore, we have to derive principles from scripture on related sexual issues and see if we can wisely apply them to the subject of masturbation.|`|hiCSVwchaa	Masturbation is sin for men, since they are spilling their seed.<br>  <br>  But, the same argument cannot be made for women...<br>  <br>  ETA:  Women can masturbate without lust, as long as we have batteries.

MV6pc1omaa	No, I was named for my atheist grandfather and his first name was a Christian name. I carry his name with pride and endeavor to emulate his many fine qualities. He was a major factor in his community during the Depression and helped many people save their homes and find them jobs. He always told my mother "we could be next so help while we can."<br>  <br>  I would never insult my parents either. They gave me the name for a reason, to honor my mother's father, whom my own father admired.|`|wwdllMzYaa	it does<br>  and no|`|9m2LvlWdaa	My eldest son's name is a biblical name.|`|PDJjy0bPaa	My name does have a religious meaning.

Typical black and white world view held by religionists.<br>  My names had and have meaning to my parents. That's all there is to them. I quit using my first name (an apostle) when I went to college, choosing instead to use my grandfather's name, which I was fortunate enough to have been given. It wasn't a decision that had anything to do with my opinion of religions.<br>  Read Bertrand Russell's essays, especially "On Religion." <br>  I dare you. It's only fair, after all. I've read the Bible.|`|GGUDvicaaa	Of course not. My name is derived from the word Christian.  My mother thought it was pretty name and I would NEVER insult my sweet dead mother and change it!|`|NrzxtivLaa	moot point, I already know my name has no religious meaning|`|3lMujNUZaa	No.<br>  The origin of your name is immaterial.|`|EXurNsB4aa	No.  And I would probably giggle and make fun of people who do.|`|4qA9Y7m9aa	Of course not.|`|TBjIJnWvaa	No|`|dqZrq7Zeaa	I was named for a pagan goddess and I like my name so NOPE!|`|751e8eda4be2fcdef4baeb51cb78a69aaa	I once tried to do just that...but faced vehement opposition from my parents!<br>  <br>  Thereafter, I quit the idea. But I also guess that its very hard to find a name which doesn't have any religious meaning to it.<br>  <br>  From another perspective, changing one's name is also a stupid idea. If somebody's name has a religious connotation to it then he/she may try N O T living upto his'/her's name; the way that I have!|`|oen1tuyTaa	It wouldn't have religious meaning to it would it if we didn't believe...Why is it so difficult for others to believe that atheist don't believe in the book of horrors...so call me Mary, Joseph...whatever..Its just a name...<br>  Joseph was the founder of the Mormons wasn't he?<br>  He was also the bloke in the bible...SO WHAT!!|`|Ve18FAnGaa	neither first nor last name has a religious background to it.  my middle name however (as was (is?)common) was given to me as my "christian" name. while i do particularly like having a name with no meaning, i am not at all bothered by my middle name.  if anything it is just a sign of my roots.  doesn't matter if you agree with your roots or not, they aren't going anywhere.|`|Ne9rXERpaa	Not so far...and I was told once by an Episcopalian minister that "Jason" (my name) is what Jesus' name translates to in Greek.<br>  <br>  And I even came THIS close to naming my own son "Christian" (although it would have been a reference to "Cyrano de Bergerac", not Jesus).

After all, the meaning of our own names are defined by ourselves.|`|P6P3oUgdaa	Me neither,<br>  <br>  Unless my name was a very popular name in  Latin America  (jesus).<br>  <br>  But a name like Daniel or Samuel, nah, i would not change that.<br>  <br>  (okay, another bad name for me for would be Elisha :)

Aaaaanyway,<br>  <br>  most Americans think that Ireland is the most beautiful green place on earth, with perfectly manicured hills, a few awesome looking castles, a country filled with songs and lots of great history.<br>  <br>  When we think of Irish people, we think of drunk Catholics always getting into fights, we think you are somewhat coordinated dancers - but we do hate you for giving us the river dance.  (Maybe the drunk part comes from observing American Irish).<br>  <br>  O Danny Boy, When Irish Eyes Are Smilin' are our favorite songs even among us non-Irish Americans.

Like with a lot of "straight" guys, they always just say things like they think its gross or not natural or whatever.  Okay thats fine, but thats a personal opinion.  Like I dont want to watch extremely obese people having sex so you know what?  I dont.  Nor do I think about it or imagine every time I meet someone who is obese.  <br>  And thats the other thing.  Its not all about the sex yet thats what they seem to concentrate on so much.  Like these body parts dont fit with those.  You have got to be kidding me.  There are so many exceptions to that rule in the hetero world.  Just face facts, some people simply like to try to suppress others cause it makes them feel more powerful, superior, "normal".
FiDcOMgxaa	How to Learn a Foreign Language<br>  Learn a Foreign Language<br>  1) Spend the time!<br>  <br>  By far the most important factor is how much time you are immersed in the language. The more time you spend with the language, the faster you will learn. This means listening, reading, writing, speaking, and studying words and phrases. This does not mean sitting in class looking out the window, nor listening to other students who do not speak well, nor getting explanations in your own language about how the language works. This means spending time enjoyably connected to the language you are learning.<br>  <br>  2) Listen and read every day!<br>  <br>  Listen wherever you are on your MP3 player. Read what you are listening to. Listen to and read things that you like, things that you can mostly understand, or even partly understand. If you keep listening and reading you will get used to the language. One hour of listening or reading is more effective than many hours of class time.<br>  <br>  3) Focus on words and phrases!<br>  <br>  Build up your vocabulary, you’ll need lots. Start to notice words and how they come together as phrases. Learn these words and phrases through your listening and reading. Read online, using online dictionaries, and make your own vocabulary lists for review. Soon you will run into your new words and phrases elsewhere. Gradually you will be able to use them. Do not worry about how accurately you speak until you have accumulated a plenty of words through listening and reading.<br>  <br>  4) Take responsibility for your own learning!<br>  <br>  If you do not want to learn the language, you won’t. If you do want to learn the language, take control. Choose content of interest, that you want to listen to and read. Seek out the words and phrases that you need to understand your listening and reading. Do not wait for someone else to show you the language, nor to tell you what to do. Discover the language by yourself, like a child growing up. Talk when you feel like it. Write when you feel like it. A teacher cannot teach you to become fluent, but you can learn to become fluent if you want to.<br>  <br>  5) Relax and enjoy yourself!<br>  <br>  Do not worry about what you cannot remember, or cannot yet understand, or cannot yet say. It does not matter. You are learning and improving. The language will gradually become clearer in your brain, but this will happen on a schedule that you cannot control. So sit back and enjoy. Just make sure you spend enough time with the language. That is the greatest guarantee of success.<br>  <br>  Best Way To Learn A Foreign Language <br>  <a href="http://www.articlegarden.com/Article/Best-Way-To-Learn-A-Foreign-Language/69171" rel="nofollow">http://www.articlegarden.com/Article/Bes...</a><br>  <br>  Also,see this>><br>  <a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;_ylt=AikY4IWussXQlrJxuheMHVjsy6IX;_ylv=3?qid=20090203111831AA6Yid9">http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;...</a>|`|m4nKkFDUaa	I'd start off by reinforcing your grammar, especially for English, as it's so complicated! At the same time, try reading books in English and watching movies (with subtitles in your own language) that you're familiar with in your own language already. I'm learning French and Italian, and I find that doing this has improved my language skills already, however little I've done! Another thing to consider is going to the UK or America. Chances are, no one will speak your language (unfortunately, English speakers tend to be like this because English is spoken worldwide and we have little need for foreign languages, on the whole.), so you'll be forced to use English.|`|mJbwemH8aa	Yeah that depends on where do u live and what available schools near yr area, but if u really want to do so, date someone that knows English very well, or Marry someone, thats the best way if u cant travel to UK or US.<br>  <br>  <br>  ..|`|g2R7e2eVaa	your teacher is correct. You have to learn the language, then speak it everyday with someone who is fluent.|`|ksENd3Laaa	What your teacher told is correct. However, I would add another factor that I consider quite important: motivation.<br>  <br>  If you have motivation, materials (or people) and time, you might learn languages in short time.|`|3dfZhJwLaa	The best way to learn a language is to immerse yourself in it so that you hear it everyday, even if you're not actually sitting down to learn it<br>  Check this site for tips:<br>  <a href="http://www.socyberty.com/Languages/Learning-a-Language.530279" rel="nofollow">http://www.socyberty.com/Languages/Learn...</a>|`|URP0nFQXaa	rosetta stone|`|hexzaIGgaa	Your teacher is correct.

Which most christians would stay away from most atheist.<br>  Your Christians friends are praying for you daily, I'm sure.  Only God can do the rest.<br>  <br>  turn OR burn|`|QIf3E3SKaa	why don't you ask them this?<br>  and why do you care?<br>  <br>  something tells me you're not really an atheist but more on the agnostic side.|`|hR7OsqtRaa	You need to turn yourself to God, if you want to be saved. Christians can only show you the way. Its upto you, if you want to follow or not.<br>  <br>  Who created Humans.? People may say The Big Bang. Then Who Created the Big Bang.? Particles ? Who created the particles ? I can keep going on and on.<br>  Answer : Humans are not real since there is no evidence of their evolution.<br>  Would you accept the above argument. ?<br>  If I tell you Who Created God, then you would say Who created the one who created God and it would go on and on.<br>  We know God is real, since we are real. If you deny God, then you have to deny your own existence, which is impossible. No matter how knowledgable or intelligent you are, you cannot deny that there has to be a supernatural force that has created our planet and our body and, that creator is God.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  In John 8:58 "I tell you the truth," Jesus answered, "before Abraham was born, I am!"<br>  <br>  The above verse speaks a lot about who Jesus really is.<br>  <br>  There are a lot more chapters and verses mentioned in the below website along with music, speeches and praise and worship.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://jesustrinity.blogspot.com" rel="nofollow">http://jesustrinity.blogspot.com</a><br>  <br>  Jesus is God. He is alive forever.<br>  <br>  The questions usually asked are:-<br>  <br>  1) Did Jesus really exist?<br>  2) Is Jesus God?<br>  3) If Jesus is God, then why did He keep praying to the Father in Heaven? How can the Father and Jesus be one God? Why did Jesus have to suffer on the Cross?<br>  4) What is the Holy Spirit?<br>  5) What is so special about Jesus? Why cant I just view him as an ordinary man or a teacher or a prophet?

Jesus is God in Heb. 1:8<br>  3. John the apostle states that Jesus was the Word which was God that became<br>  flesh (John 1:1-14)<br>  4. The phrase "Call upon the name of the LORD" (Hebrew, YHWH, i.e., Psalm<br>  116:4) used only of God on the OT, and translated into the Greek in the LXX as<br>  "Call upon the name of the LORD (greek, KURIOS)," applied to Jesus in the NT<br>  (1 Cor. 1:2) Jesus is God in flesh<br>  5. The apostle John says that Jesus was , "...calling God His own Father,<br>  making Himself equal to God," (John 5:18)<br>  6.

9923f578763ad24193648aeb065ca022aa	My fiance bought me a dozen roses and cooked me a fabulous dinner of steak, twice baked potatoes, asparagus and fresh bread. For dessery we had champagne and chocolate covered strawberries and we enjoyed a movie. <br>  <br>  It was a perfect day <3|`|T9WjlLYKaa	I'm Single ;) :)|`|E2crbIVdaa	he holds me he lets me knoww the im hes that nothing is going tocamee between us and that|`|3xsqDUgkaa	I don't have any husband or a boyfriend. :P
nkFHk9dNaa	Yes ; the lamb is Jesus. Only joking. The Mary in that Nursery Rhyme has no connection to the blessed Virgin Mary, and the lamb, is just a lamb.|`|6bC1HnyHaa	NOOOOOOOOOOOOO,he is our prophet|`|oen1tuyTaa	LOL<br>  Mary had a little lamb, its fleece was white as snow and everywhere that Mary went the lamb was sure to go..<br>  I like that.|`|Qyue0Ykgaa	Yes.|`|CMms2lGoaa	not in that nursery rhyme. but in real life yeah.|`|ubsq8O8Baa	there are millions with the name Mary, i think u need to go back to nursery
jDY8KsvTaa	Let's analyze this using Christianity as the benchmark:<br>  <br>  Most Christian faiths will tell you that they are the best at helping you "develop a personal relationship with Jesus".  They will add that this relationship is necessary in order to gain access to heaven, and that the alternative is an eternity of torture in hell.<br>  <br>  Let's say a church has a regular congregation of 50 people for their sunday service and that these people earn an average of 50K per year.  As the churches will stipulate, followers are expected to tithe 10% of their income.  This means that the church would have an income of $4807.69 per service.  <br>  <br>  Assuming only one service is held per week, that the service is approximately 2 hours long and that approximately 4 hours of preparation is required for the sermon; the average hourly income equals $801.28.  This is equal to an yearly income of $41,666.64 for working less than one full day per week.<br>  <br>  This is the best scam ever.|`|NrzxtivLaa	as the late George Carlin commented, "Religion is the biggest bullsh*t story ever told!"|`|AA11717111	No.|`|E8v4nbR6aa	Yes definitely, I know people who go to an adventist church. They give 10% of there earnings to that church. I don't Know how much it is for other churches, but it'd be alot of money in total. It has been like this since the medieval times, the church had full control over what the people did and I think they owned peoples land, etc. It'd have to be the most biggest and longest scam EVER!|`|ZRuJFoUIaa	Most of your Churches and missionaries live on a shoe string budget just barely meeting their obligations, So no, The evidence does not support that . However that's not to say there are not those out there that take advantage of others in the name of Christ. God bless.|`|dqZrq7Zeaa	I think it serves many purposes... and feeding greedy liars is one of them.<br>  Sadly the people giving the money are often the ones LEAST able to do so.|`|5acf40d2aa61e65eff15834add1f7bd5aa	YES|`|NVqmnFuUaa	nope, religion is what you have if you don't have money at all.It is not started as entrepreneurial endeavor but long before the recorded history started as  record writing begins.The inner feeling deep within you is no merchandise,that is where religion can really help you and exclusively free of charge.If among the numerous religious denominations around are getting richer,it has nothing to do with "religion",<br>  because in christianity ,the investment of man is not money  but avoiding the sins in this world.|`|aF4mFlJiaa	Jesus said: (Matthew 10:8) .?.?.YOU received free, give free.?.?.<br>  ONLY a religion that does not have a paid clergy could even even be considered as possibly being correct.|`|x36uIvAmaa	Maybe some people actually believes that they are doing good, who knows? If they don't waste money on building useless places of worship etc. and are actually helping people as they should, then maybe it's a good thing after all.|`|MTi7r9l6aa	Obviously. (Of course, I'd have to specify that this doesn't apply to ALL religions)|`|FN8meC6taa	yes, that is correct!|`|G9h1VZ4Iaa	yes|`|TWsxP46Qaa	yes

Don't you know that the new favourite date of the end-time supporters is 2012?|`|AeV8KYL2aa	shut it|`|AA10997286	No one knows except God. A lot of scientists and mathematicians like Isaac Newton and Albert Einstein stated predictions, but we can never be too sure. The end of the world can happen very suddenly.|`|G0wGbdENaa	o thats nice so the partys bin put forward to 2010, and there was me hoping to see the olympics, . . . . o dam . . . lol|`|kksq9BtOaa	You ask couse the date of the end of the world is common knowledge to the RnS community?|`|dSMb8JDvaa	The world end is when you were Dead...I don't know which year, it depends on your destiny.|`|CMms2lGoaa	No.|`|X3QBqLSHaa	nobody knows|`|6bC1HnyHaa	Only God know|`|TGu0LTQTaa	Nobody knows when is the end of the world. The bible also says nobody knows when is the end of the world. Only God know. The bible only says that there are sign of the end of the world such as earthquake, volcano activities, wars, uprising of nation, fights against each others, countries against countries, someone suddenly disappear, plague of disease, false prophets, miracle, sky changes colour and so on. All of these seems to be happening now. During the world war I or world war II, people taught it is the end of the world, so as the Gulf War. So, I don't think it is the end of the world not even 2012 as the mayan calculation someone indicated.|`|fE4GBpmAaa	No one knows when the return of Christ will be here (He will come like a thief in the night) The only one who knows is God so don't put your trust in man (God is not man he shall not lie) You just make sure you have your life right with the Lord so when he do return you can go back with Him.|`|j5rHgDSkaa	The world is going to end whenever God decides. It may be in 2010 it may be in 3019. We really don't know. Just don't worry about it because whats going to happen will happen, so just enjoy what you have now.|`|nkFHk9dNaa	If it does, it does. I highly doubt it though. Many people use the end of the world to scare people into purchasing books ect. The bible tells us that no man, not even Jesus; knows when the world will end.<br>  <br>  So, ask me in 2010.|`|Qyue0Ykgaa	Allah said that no body knows the exact date that the world will end.|`|wR9UyNzDaa	Only God knows and we don't. But there is going to be a war between the Muslims and the Israeli, and no not this war. It is going to be a big war.|`|0b3616bc18c7ed1ab77b6e4d1c2eaa02aa	Yes.  You must get rid of all your wealth to become pure and go to heaven.  Please contact me for help doing this..<br>  <br>  (This is now my standard answer for people predicting a date for the end of the world)|`|cMsC5a14aa	Dec 21 2012|`|VlnxVZSNaa	In 2010 Italy will win the world cup yet again.|`|uUJXS3nsaa	noooooops buddy!|`|jfOSVSQkaa	No|`|N58YMuuxaa	no but all the planets will line up cooooool!|`|sAvqCBvVaa	i'm not telling <br>  <br>  just you wait & see like everybody else|`|OywIJxobaa	what does he know?
pfke6Jieaa	loll....oh trust me girls love em. when i was dating i had a really hard time because all the gay looking dudes got the girls while the more masculine guys got whatever they could. it kinda pissed me off that a girl would rather go for a boy who looks like a girl than someone who is not girly looking. i guess ur probably in a smart area...lol.|`|283tO9j9aa	Well, I'm sexually attracted to big Viking dudes, but they're all wimps on the inside.<br>  <br>  You know, although I can't imagine being romantically linked to a guy who was a crossdresser, I don't really have a problem with it. If I was in love with a guy and then found out he liked girls clothes I wouldn't break up with him for it, I would deal with it. I could certainly be friends with a girly guy. Mind you, I'm 21 so I'm a lot older than the girls you see at school and probably a lot more mature about this sort of thing too.<br>  <br>  I think you might like to read about this guy:<br>  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eddie_Izzard" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eddie_Izzar...</a><br>  Eddie Izzard is a famous comedian and he wears womens clothes on stage. He says he's a 'male lesbian' because he likes girls but he also likes their dresses.|`|3e6a7b1f3e03a56ef0cc271441e2531daa	It's built into their biology.  Girls are weaker than men, and they need to be protected.  That means they need to feel loved by a man who will defend their honor, and protect them from everything evil.  Biology tell them they will have children and their children will also need to be defended.  They also need to love a man who they can respect and honor.<br>  <br>  Here is a little story of how girls view the world.  When I was very little I wanted my father to pull me around the neighborhood in a little red wagon.  But before I would let him pull me, I had to dress up as a princess and that way I could pretend to be pulled by my gallant knight.  I would sit in the wagon viewing my royal kingdom as my father pulled and pulled.  At one point we would pass a house with a big dog.  One day the big dog was out in the yard and he came barking, and barking and looking fierce.  All the time my father would stand between me and the dog that I feared.  I knew that I would be all right.  I knew that my father would protect me.  I knew that my father was big and strong, and my world was entirely happy and secure.  <br>  <br>  Now as a grown woman what kind of man would I be attracted to?  Of course, one like my father - strong, loyal, and secure.<br>  <br>  This does not mean that I couldn't be friends with a wimpy cross-dressing male..  but don't expect me to be in love with such a person.  He just doesn't meet my needs.|`|yV1jZkqGaa	i'm attracted to nerds. serioulsy. like no joke.<br>  <br>  <3 theres this one guy who's so awesome. he was shorter than me for 3 years then suddenly shot up dammit. and he's super skinny, i cuold crush him like  tooth pick :( and he's quite.. feminine. no wait. sensitive :)<br>  <br>  gawd i love him.. :(|`|4TtPUHwzaa	You got some serious issues!<br>  I like my man 6"2, tall, dark and handsome, <br>  (A proper man)<br>  Cross dressing is for fools only. <br>  You not just short and weak, you cross dresser as well. That is not very appealing to girls.|`|8lNWNxmQaa	When has weakness ever been attractive? If we wanted to date a shemale, we would be gay|`|YFXmO2Xqaa	girls like a the oppiste of who they are.big strong buff guys.if they wanted a sissy they would be with a lipstick lesbian.if you like girls try finding a website that meets your needs.and don't listen to bozo's that got nothing but stupid answers.you are who you are.nothing wrong with that
TGu0LTQTaa	It is built in nature of human being. The world will be very dull if there is nothing to talk about. There are some who are very good at gossiping and it is this type of people we should rather not talk to them too much. Too much of gossiping is very disturbing especially those talk secretly behind the back of people and also for untrue stories.|`|QjIhIFnPaa	It gives people a talking point.<br>  <br>  i think humans have a natural instinct to be inquisitive.<br>  We like to know about things, and how / why they happen.<br>  <br>  Although sometimes gossip can go further in such ways as really talking down about other people. It goes further then just the simple 'Oh did you know Johnny and Tina broke up'.<br>  <br>  I find that sometimes when people go that step further and actually put people down when there not around and such can simply be a couple of things.<br>  <br>  Either they want attention.<br>  <br>  Or could be jealous of someone which makes them talk about them in a bad light.<br>  <br>  But who knows really!!|`|G2wDSJJFaa	IT'S LIFE|`|dSMb8JDvaa	curious, human is very curious.|`|gg2NFlNZaa	people have an inquisitive nature and have a thirst for knowledge. They love to get together to talk and exchange their life's stories and it becomes addicting. It isn't just because people are nosy, but people love hearing about other people's lives. this gives them a guage on their own lives and sometimes, depending on the story, makes them feel better or worse about their own situation.|`|s6GKHKccaa	People who tend to gossip find other peoples lives more interesting than their own. It kind of runs the same as people who are obsessed with celebrities. <br>  <br>  I personally like to keep my hands clean of other peoples business.|`|5uySCrYUaa	coz they just want to, their own fetish

AA11047076	Most will- but there are parts of the world where they will not allow anyone they don't know in.  In many EU countries even Jews visiting a city will need to notify them ahead of time and submit various details to the security team in order to be allowed in.  Its a precaution no one wants- but due to the attacks on Jews and Jewish communal facilities an unfortunate reality.  To avoid dissapointment I would phone whatever synagogue you are planning to visit and ask them- if they have security requirements they will tell you and you will be able to organise beforehand, instead of being turned away because you haven't discussed it with them.<br>  <br>  As for what we believe:  We believe in one, unique, indivisible G-d who gave Moses the Torah (both written and oral ) on Mt Sinai after he had redeemed the nation from slavery.  We believe in the laws as put down in the written Torah, expounded on in the Mishnah (oral Torah) and explained by the Rabbis down the ages,|`|AA10054998	Most wouldn't have a problem with it but it would probably be a good idea to call the Rabbi ahead of time.  I was raised in a small synagogue in the south and we had non-Jewish visitors from time to time.  Usually no one had a problem with it but its always good to call the Rabbi in case their are any particular minhag (the tradition of the synagogue) that you may need to know about.|`|cECRv4NMaa	Yes, I think though you need to ask permission. It would only be right as well as polite. That would also get you in good with them too.|`|dqZrq7Zeaa	Yes|`|f0f91b1f61307e94f9c53fd86e2c1295aa	Yes. I'm not a jew but was interested in knowing their beliefs and attending a shabbat service. They welcomed me with open arms. I went for The jewish new year services, Yom Kippur and more shabbats than I can count. They were very very friendly. I think you should go ahead and do it.<br>  <br>  If you want to convert to Judaism though, know that its not easy and may take months if not years (depending on they congregation you go to e.g. orthodox, reform etc) & when you go to a Rabbi about conversion its his religious duty to do all sorts of things to try and discourage you, like being rude, not coming for appointments etc. They do this to make sure that you really are committed to becoming a jew.<br>  <br>  For what jews believe just look up judaism on wikipedia, <a href="http://www.wikipedia.org" rel="nofollow">http://www.wikipedia.org</a>  <br>  <br>  Good luck|`|AA11992885	absolutely<br>  <br>  just don't preach about some other religion once there<br>  <br>  if you go to an Orthodox Synagogue, don't speak about anything other then Orthodoxy, if to a reform, don't speak about anything other than reform<br>  <br>  and certainly, do NOT speak about any branch of christianity, especially not messianicism|`|Hwe4MA6Faa	You may have to take off your shoes and wear a round thing on our head.

Snakes are not a symbol of evil, they are of knowledge, personal electro-magnetic power and sexuality. The neck is to do with creativity, responsibility, innocence and speaking your truth. Vishuddha - purity.

Is the snake actually hurting her, or just wrapping around?  The snake in a circle is a classic symbol of eternity (think of the picture of the snake swallowing it's own tail).  In that case, the dream likely symbolizes her desired level of commitment from you.<br>  <br>  However, if the snake is hurting her, she's afraid of being hurt by you.  She's likely either afraid of commitment, or wants it but doesn't think that you want it, as well.

It was thought that if the shade of a dead person did not have a fare, they would be left stranded in the world of the living, haunting people as ghosts.|`|2vzj65Kfaa	The copper coins were to pay Charon the boatman to ferry the corpse across the river styx into the underworld.<br>  <br>  They had the practicle value of keeping the corpse's eyelids closed during services/wake.|`|vHIu0QL8aa	The gold coins are very important. When someone dies they are supposed to enter the afterlife. Upon death they arrive at the river Styx. The boat man is there. They give the boatman the coins and get a ride into the afterlife. Those who dont have coins are cast into the river for all of eternity.|`|LBAh1tPoaa	They aren't gold coins. Pay attention.

bda465ikaa	The phrase is "King, de jure uxoris ".<br>  =======<br>  Hamlet is fictional and it set in an unclear time period. The implication is that it is not contemporary to the time that it was written (400 years ago).<br>  ----<br>  By current British law, Claudius would be behind Hamlet in line to the throne. The implication is that Claudius usurped the throne while Hamlet was away. It's just one more reason why Hamlet hates him.<br>  ======<br>  In Britain the husband of the king is not "entitled" to any title. However, he is usually given one. At the time of Prince Philip's marriage to Elizabeth he was given the style "His Royal Highness" and the peerage "Duke of Windsor" . He was not made a prince until five years after Elizabeth became queen (nearly 10 years after they were married).<br>  --------<br>  Queen Anne's husband never got any titles except Lord High Admiral. Albert was not made "Prince Consort" until he was married for 17 years and had 9 children with her.He never renounced his German title, largely because they would not give him a British one.|`|Ku3A8kkzaa	Elizabeth II is married to Phillip.<br>  <br>  Phillip gave up all his Greek Royal Titles before marrying the Queen.<br>  He was no longer royal when he was married he didn't have to be given any title at all, He was only made duke of Edinburgh out of courtesy.|`|X6rFPI2laa	I think you are mixing apples and oranges here.  First, Claudius and Gertrude were fictional characters in Shakespeare's play "Hamlet", and the play was set in Denmark.  And by the way, Queen Elizabeth II was not Queen when she married Phillip, but was Princess Elizabeth, the heiress presumptive.  She could have made him King Consort upon her accession, but did not.|`|Iqp3ZUAlaa	Elizabeth was only a princess when she married Philip;when she ascended the throne,the laws had undergone many changes.Victoria had started the precedent for a reigning queen's spouse to become a prince consort;this was many centuries after the fictional characters of Claudius and Gertrude,from Hamlet,and Claudius,by the way was ELECTED king and did not become king upon his marriage!|`|KCpGsN2faa	Because he was royal by birth. Elizabeth is queen of England by her birthright, that is, her family has been the queens and kings of England, whereas Gertrude just married a king.|`|kc2i8LiDaa	Someone stated that HM Queen Elizabeth II could have made her husband the "King Consort"; there is no such thing or title.   And back to the original question, you have mixed fact with fiction so your question as presented can't really be answered.

MtDEf9zxaa	I don't know the answer to your question.  Personally I think your crazy, but that doesn't mean I don't take you seriously.  My husband is the same way (believes in ghosts, personal experiences) and I call him crazy too.  Its all in good fun though because I am actually intrigued by the subject of ghosts.  I am very interested and I want to believe.  However, I am a chemistry major and so I take things from a scientific perspective and so I just cannot believe that they are real.  I need an explanation or proof.  So I'm still waiting for the day I have my own experience and have proof.  Until then, I call you crazy.|`|F4IjI9qaaa	I don't know what you'd call any of it but I'd like you to know - you're not alone. My husband and I both saw and heard ghosts in our old house. They are there if we care to listen.|`|49516892a30256a05c73d42ba16ec24eaa	I'm not sure there is a word for only being able to hear them...but when you do hear them it's called auditory evidence...|`|vBIwaQ0qaa	I am a very firm believer of spirits and haunting's. I have had many encounters with my mom. She has been gone for almost 24 years now. I have heard her call my name and touch my shoulder. I turn around to see her but she's not there. At first I was petrified but got used to it after a while. <br>  <br>  I also have had encounters with my late husband. He's been gone 11 years. I once had an encounter with my grandmother who I never met. She passed away when my dad was only 7 years old.<br>  <br>  I have submitted my stories to a few paranormal web sites too.<br>  <br>  So, makes me a believer, for sure!
RQfLKOPQaa	I'll play devil's advocate here. I don't believe in ghosts, so your story sounds to me like a movie plot. But to give an impartial opinion I'll consider options assuming everything is true.<br>  Option 1. You are hearing ghosts, in reality what you are doing is feeling them but instead of feeling them as an image, you are feeling them as a sound. I assume nobody else can hear these noises? Therefore it's one of your traits, you should look for people with similar gifts so that you can try to control your senses and be able to live a normal life or if you chose to, be more efficient contacting ghosts.<br>  <br>  Option 2. You Think you are hearing ghosts, it might be that you have a mild form of schizophrenia, and hear sounds that aren't there, of course there are a lot of other symptoms, and there are a lot of mental conditions that might fit this, so you can consult a psychiatrist and see if everything alright with you.<br>  <br>  <br>  Option 3. Others ear what you ear but they don't think they are ghosts, it might be that you are highly impressionable or are subject to a high level of stress, You need to chill and relax, maybe do some therapy.<br>  <br>  Option 4. Others don't ear what you do, but you definitely hear noises, then you might have an ear deficiency, you should consult a specialist.<br>  <br>  Bottom line: I won't rule out ghosts, and let's consider that you are crazy only if everything else fails. The two things I would do is is check the facts:<br>  Do other people hear those noises or some similar noises? This is the main question, if it's a 6th sense it can't be perceived through your ears, unless the structure of your ears is different. So it has to be perceived through the mind. If others hear it, it's not a sixth sense, it's your imagination. If others don't hear anything the question you have to ask is:<br>  <br>  Is everything alright with my hearing? If you rule this out, then you can pursue the paranormal area or the psychiatric area, depending on what you want to do first. <br>  But the fact is NOBODY will take you seriously if you don't rule out plausible scientific non paranormal explanations first, and only then a lot of nonbelievers- like myself- would say that it's your mind that's playing tricks on you. It takes a lot to persuade a skeptic.|`|d3VV4b6vaa	hearing actually is a 6th sense. seeing is not just a 6th sense. sensing them and feeling/smelling them is also 6th sense. EVERYONE has this ability, but they're either 1. afraid of it. 2 feel the don't deserve to have it 3. fear they will be punished if they use it. between 2-3 is the msot common time for ghosts to visit. I know, this happens to me as well. it can be called "clairaudience", to hear any paranormal things such as ghosts. seeing them is clairvoyance, clairsentience is to feel them, and claircognizance is knowing they are there.|`|Run7dyraaa	I know. I have had experiences also. So has my mom. So has my sister. The only way to keep them away, especially the bad ones, is God. That is the only thing that saved me. One night I was visited by this tall, dark, evil entity. He stood at the side of my bed. Drained all the energy out of me.<br>  <br>  I couldn't scream for help, get up, run away. All noises stopped around me. Only thing I had control of was my brain. And inside my brain I repeated the "Our Father". I told him to "be gone, in the name of the Lord". And he went. Because no entity can come up against the power of God.|`|onOZ76esaa	you arnt.<br>  my boyfriend does.<br>  its actually rly scary sometimes.<br>  your actually lucky you dont see them.|`|HzjeKsDJaa	its called auditory 6th sensed|`|9V1kO3sVaa	idk the answer but man that freaky!!! that is down right scary call the ghost catching people you probably be on tv lol.|`|x8DoOgEoaa	I don't know what's it's called but you should look up paranormal professionals in your area or ghost hunters or a medium and get to the bottom of it.  I don't know that I'd be able to live with the ability you have.  Say your prayers and keep Rosary Beads on your bed post.  God will protect you but you also need to protect yourself.|`|AA11558296	You need to undrstand that this all a trick. Satan some times make syou hear or see things that make you run away from God.

Maybe it's jus a thing of your mind(sorry....ear)|`|AN3aE1Scaa	Clairaudience - Intuitive<br>  This is a person who will pick up a thought and hear it. This persons mental or intellectual understanding is very important and they can make good leaders. We all know someone that we would say was a mental person, always having to understand mentally. They carefully think things through. If this person were to become enlightened they would have the ability to become a medium, someone who channels information from entities who have passed over, because their most heightened sensitivity is to hear.<br>  <br>  Clairvoyance- Visionary<br>  This is a person who will pick up a thought and see it. This person has the ability to transform a thought into a vision, symbol or in colour by using their mind's eye. If an artist, a decorator, a creative person, someone who mainly uses the right side of their brain were to become enlightened they would have the ability to read auras, our chakras, draw guides and this is how they would channel what they received because the ability to see images is their most heightened sensitivity.<br>  <br>  Clairsentience - Prophetic (1)<br>  This is a person who will pick up a thought and just knows it. This person is sensitive to precognition and has hunches, dreams and knowings and this person usually deals with the future or present and how it will affect another. If you were to meet an enlightened Prophetic you would be able to get some information about your 'line of probability', tomorrow is not set in time remember. This could be a person who has a dream about something and that dream turns out to happen in reality. They have the ability of prediction because they 'just know' and can tune into and understand their hunches.<br>  <br>  Clairsentience - Feeler (2)<br>  This is a person who will pick up a thought and transform it immediately into a feeling. This persons life can revolve around how it feels to them. Their sense of touch is well-developed and they have the ability to know people by feeling what they feel. After enlightenment, this is someone would have the ability to practice psychometry. The ability to put something belonging to someone in their hand and read the energy. Depending on their other gifts, they could tell the past, present or future from the energy. They have the ability to feel how others feel but only on the emotional level. They will be able to not only empathise but experience their pain, loss, grief etc. For instance, if they were to channel energy from a persons past life they would experience the pain and hurt that that soul experienced in that past lifetime.<br>  <br>  The one you feel standing by your side is your spirit guide. They are there to help. Try meditation...|`|TjrnVFVRaa	It could be that a ghost, which is actually a restless spirit, is trying to contact you. Th reason for this is that the spirit is trying to move on to the next plane of existence, but yet may have some unfinished business in this world keeping them form completing their journey onward. <br>  <br>  It sounds to me like you are more receptive to sound than vision and the spirit is using what works to try to contact you. <br>  <br>  Next time this happens, try to think calm and soothing thoughts, relax and do not fear. Close your eyes and look in the direction of the manifestation, then open them and clear your mind of all thoughts, open your mind to the spirit. You may receive a message for you to do a simple task that can help this spirit move on!<br>  <br>  What a great thing to be able to do!|`|wGCCMjVsaa	well i do believe you, the only peple i dont believe are the ones that try amke money off it, ive had a few experiences when i was little, once my little brother who was 3 came in the room with a light bulb from the ceiling, how the **** did he reach, its the litle unexplained fings that convince me, i was walking upstairs once in the dark and the light just turned on on its own, the funny fing is my grandad used to say eee by gum yul brek ya bluddy neck son lol he was from lancashire haha, the answer is a unexplained and always will be

So if somebody writes "*bats eyelashes*" then this should be read as "I am batting my eyelashes". <br>  <br>  This should never appear in any printed matter.|`|524ae26534ddf801aecd5122aa2ed234aa	This is a way of writing about an action that cannot be seen by the person who is reading. <br>  <br>  It is actually NOT grammatically correct, but placing stars has become popular when writing quickly about actions in e-mails, when you want to seperate it from the rest of your words. However, it is lazy writing and you should not copy this style!<br>  <br>  Your friend is saying to you that he is sipping coffee. Obviously, you cannot see that so he is just describing the action of sipping coffee literally.|`|diggYEPlaa	They are telling you they are sipping coffee but because you can't see it in an email so  they show they are doing it by putting '*' stars around it|`|Jv1dMGuWaa	When someone does an action in real life, they put stars around it to show it's an action, instead of part of their sentence. Sometimes the person is actually trying to be funny, by saying *eats a giant cookie*, or something like that. You actually seem to have fairly good English skills, don't give up. English is one of the hardest languages to learn (Actually, I find Japanese hard too ><)|`|aEeCCHVlaa	To sip coffee could mean to drink it slowly, not drink it down all at once.  To cry generally means actual tears.  It is hard to understand what meaning they could have without seeing the entire sentence.  Once the entire sentence is read, it becomes a little more easy to understand what is being said.  I am sorry I cannot be of more help.
W1zxRTUJaa	While firstly, I don't think it entirely wise that you displayed yourself as Gay on your myspace if you didn't want others to know, but its happened.<br>  <br>  In the situation you're in, I would say first of all, don't kill yourself.  You're going to get out of this one way or another, and death isn't really the answer.<br>  <br>  Secondly, ignore your family for the moment.  If they're going to be assholes to you, well.. lets just say "Honor thy mother and father" really applies when they along with the rest of the family ends up honoring you.  If they're going to yell at you and demand you get "healed" at church, just ignore them, and if you find yourself at church, just be sure to point out to the rest of the family the reverends bulge in his pants whenever he looks at you or any of the other boys in the pews.<br>  <br>  Thirdly, if your uncle is doing all this, flip him the bird and go to your school counselors, principal, whomever, and tell them how uncomfortable you are in your home and that one of their staff members, whom thanks to them, is receiving a state salary and benefits for teaching their students in what is supposed to be a SAFE and COMFORTABLE learning environment, isn't doing his job very well at all.<br>  <br>  Finally, I would say find a GSA (Gay-Straight Alliance) in your area and ask them about what to do from there.  We have experience, but they have professionals whom are willing to listen to whatever you say and not hold anything against you.  There, you're treated equally.<br>  <br>  In case of emergency, there is the police.<br>  <br>  Best of luck.|`|VjkDIvezaa	don't kill yourself.

It may not seem like it right now, but deep down your family loves you. They want what is best for you, and sometimes they don't know how to express those feelings. They come out as anger or hurt. I would just lay low for a while and give them some time to come to terms with the situation. If they don't come around, and they stay angry, at least you will know that you were true to yourself. Sometimes that is all that you can do. People won't always understand us, but we must always be true to ourselves. I would make sure to keep supportive friends close. They will make sure that you take care of yourself, and they will help lift you up when your family makes you feel this way. Just hang on, it gets better I promise. Good luck.|`|lqSlPnDAaa	Don't kill yourself, hun. If your family can't handle it, then pay no attention to them. I know it's hard, only being 15. I'm 16 right now, and I can't wait to get out of my house and just come out to anyone who will listen, but by waiting, it'll be more rewarding to just tell your family to screw off :]

Here are names and some attributes and family guides;<br>  <br>  1.Zeus (Son of Cronus and Rhea. King of the gods. Ruler of Mount Olympus. God of the sky and thunder. His symbols are the thunderbolt, eagle, bull, and oak. Son of Cronus and Rhea)<br>  <br>  2.Hera (Daughter of Cronus and Rhea. Wife and older sister of Zeus. Goddess of women and marriage. Cow and peacock were sacred to her. And she was pretty jealous and vengeful)<br>  <br>  3.Poseidon (Son of Cronus and Rhea, elder brother of Zeus. God of the sea, and earthquakes. Often pictured with a trident and dolphins. In modern times he has been portrayed as a mer-man but that is infact confusion with his son and messenger Triton)<br>  <br>  4.Demeter (Daughter of Cronus and Rhea, elder sister of Zeus. Goddess of grain and fertility. Nourisher of the youth and the green earth, the health-giving cycle of life and death, and preserver of marriage and the sacred law)<br>  <br>  5.Ares (Son of Zeus and Hera. Often seen as god of warfare but is god of bloodlust and slaughter. Symbols quadriga – a chariot drawn by four gold-bridled fire-emitting immortal stallions. Among the gods, was recognized by his bronze armor; he brandished a spear in battle. His sacred birds were the woodpecker, the eagle owl and, the vulture.) <br>  <br>  6.Hermes( Son of Zeus and Maia. Messenger of gods. Patron of boundaries and of the travelers who cross them, shepherds and cowherds, of thieves and road travelers, of orators and wit, of literature and poets, of athletics, of weights and measures, of invention, of general commerce, and of the cunning of thieves and liars. His symbols include the tortoise, the rooster, the winged sandals, and the caduceus)<br>  <br>  7.Hephaestus (Son of Zeus and Hera. Blacksmith of gods. God of technology, blacksmiths, craftsmen, artisans, sculptors, metals, metallurgy, fire and volcanoes. He was lame, which gave him a grotesque appearance in Greek eyes.)<br>  <br>  8.Aphrodite (She was born when Uranus' genitals were cast into the sea and so is sort of an Aunt to Zeus his brothers and sisters. Goddess of love and beauty. Myrtle, dove, sparrow, and swan are sacred to her.)<br>  <br>  9.Athena (Daughter of Zeus and Metis, and Zeus' favorite child. Shrewd companion of heroes and the goddess of heroic endeavour. Patron of Athens)<br>  <br>  10.Apollo (Son of Zeus and Leto, and has a twin sister, Artemis. God of light and the sun; truth and prophecy; archery; medicine and healing; music, poetry, and the arts; and more (Depending on place and period). Often portrayed with a lyre and the snake he killed, Python)<br>  <br>  11.Artemis (Daughter of Zeus and Leto. Twin to Apollo. Goddess of forests and hills, child birth/virginity/fertility, the hunt. Often depicted as a huntress carrying a bow and arrows. The deer and the cypress were sacred to her. In later Hellenistic times she assumed a role in aiding childbirth. She was later associated with the moon)<br>  <br>  12.Hestia (Daughter of Cronus and Rhea, elder sister of Zeus. Goddess of home and the hearth, of the right ordering of domesticity and the family. Received the first offering at every sacrifice in the household.)<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  Just so you know, question is way too open. The greek pantheon changed with time. The most well known gods were the 12 olympians; Zeus, Hera, Poseidon, Demeter, Ares, Hermes, Hephaestus, Aphrodite, Athena, Apollo, Artemis, and Hestia.<br>  <br>  However on some occasions, Demeter, Ares, Aphrodite, Athena, Artemis and Hestia were replaced with Alpheus, Cronus, Rhea and the Charites,<br>  Sometimes even Heracles and Dionysus were included and Ares and Hephaestus were left out, notably at Kos.<br>  Hebe, Helios and Persephone are also sometimes inculded among the twelve olympians. <br>  <br>  Considering the amount of inconsistency about who should be placed on the list of twelve, you can imagine how many gods and goddesses actually exist. I mean aside from the olympians there were plenty of other gods, and ofcourse the children of gods like Asklepios were themselves gods, not to mention many of the children of gods and man like Heracles or Dionysus were themselves gods. <br>  <br>  Oh, and let's not forget the original Titans, although many of them were killed, like Ouranos (Uranus) and most of them lost their dominion with the end of the Golden Age. Most of them were imprisoned in Tarturus, but many of those who did not take part in the war took an active role when Zeus and his kind took over, like Mnemosyne, Rhea, Hyperion, Themis, and Metis. Also there were the children of the titans who (unlike Zeus and his brothers and sisters) were themselves titans; Helios, Eos, and Selene, the daughters of Coeus (Leto and Asteria), and the sons of Iapetus (Prometheus, Epimetheus, Atlas, and Menoetius).<br>  <br>  There are very many Greek gods and many of them are trapped in Tarturus or killed, or chained to rocks (like Prometheus) or condemned to carry rocks (like Atlas).

wB3AbJyLaa	Like its views on polygamy, Mormon views on race were also overturned when church leaders determined the time was right. Wikipedia: "He was killed while jailed in Carthage, Illinois on charges relating to his ordering the destruction of facilities producing the Nauvoo Expositor, a newspaper whose first and only edition claimed Smith was practicing plural marriage and that he intended to set himself up as a theocratic king. While Smith was in jail awaiting trial, an armed mob of men with painted faces stormed the jail and shot him and his brother Hyrum to death. Latter Day Saints view Joseph and Hyrum as martyrs." In other words, the local press published a story about Smith and the church's multiple marriage policies. Smith and his brother Hyrum, along with fourteen others, retaliated by rioting and destroying the newspaper office. As a result, Smith and others were arrested and put in jail.|`|2wUvFmrhaa	The first Mormon prophet, Joseph Smith, was arrested and convicted in New York and was found guilty of being a con-artist, an impostor.<br>  <br>  He was a necromancer and a charlatan.

Hopefully it has changed lots of times.  We believe in revelation and that the windows of heaven are open, and that regular frequent communication is going on between God and the prophets.   Continuing revelation certainly implies that God is in charge and governing his church.<br>  <br>  The church after Christ's crucifiction "changed" regularly too, as revelation was received by the apostles.    Peter received a revelation that the Gospel would no longer be exclusively preached to the Jews, but should go forth among the gentiles too.<br>  <br>  The first part of your question is false.  While Joseph Smith was accused many times, he NEVER was convicted of any crime.<br>  <br>  Did not all of the apostles, ie Peter, James, John, Paul in their day, get accused of being a true Christian and were martyred?   Yes, they were.  Seems that the Lord's anointed have had to give their lives for the gospel of Jesus Christ.

It's not right that a hardworking, say, hospital porter on ￡14,000 a year has to pay taxes so that a workshy, wannabe rabbit with 10+ sprogs rakes in ￡35,000 +.<br>  If these chavs had to pay out of their own pockets for every new sprog they produce, you'd be surprised how quickly they'd learn to read the instructions on a condom packet.|`|TrBoPj92aa	i do feel for those were contaception is not an option,<br>  <br>  personally i want to have 4 or 5 children, currently i have 3 girls aged 9 , 6mos and 6mos and both me and my partner would love a little boy we haven't started trying for another one yet though as we wouldn't be able to manage 3 children under 2.<br>  <br>  I think personally as look as the parents are able to spend quality time with each of the children, and they have enough money to support each one then they should have as many as they want baring in mind they can give each child a great, happy, loving life if they can't then they've gone to far.<br>  <br>  My mum has 5 children and she is a single parent although growing up we didn't have alot of money we were all very happy and healthy children we all had a good life and are mum did a good job.

nS7koC7Oaa	They are using Taqiyyah right now, dont waste your time,,|`|U5zcbHuZaa	Well, let's take number 3 above, "The Imams have knowledge of past and future; and nothing is hidden from them."<br>  <br>  That (as well as number 1 and 2) suggests the 12 Imams should have been able to tell everybody everything about their own lives and what would happen to them the next day and in such case would never have had to fight to protect a following. If there were a person such as this around, every person would follow them.<br>  <br>  Number 6, I think is actually right, but is specific to emergence of Imam Mahdi who will demonstrate proof of prophecy not just from his own existence, but other parts of prophecy and the science that proves them coming true. If Mahdi can demonstrate the proof of the prophecies coming true to prove prophecy is true, to prove Muhammad was true prophet, to prove others were true prophets, then Mahdi will also be demonstrated scientific evidence for Allah's existence. If you prove the prophecies and prophets are true, you also prove God is true.<br>  <br>  "Infallible" should be interpreted not to mean the Imams could not make mistakes, but that despite their mistakes, they will succeed anyway -- infallible means incapable of falling, but it does not mean incapable of stumbling or having equilibrium problems that you can quickly recover from. Mahdi is ordinary human being, will make mistakes, stumble and maybe almost fall, but he won't fall. Allah is holding him up so long as he is true to Allah.|`|gyrihMqhaa	The Only authentic Book Is Holy Quran <br>  <br>  And after Holy Quran Nahajul Balagha And The Hadith Which are Narrated By Our Imams Which they are The Decedent Of Prophet <br>  <br>  <br>  And from among you there should be a party who invite to good and enjoin what is right and forbid the wrong, and these it is that shall be successful. <br>  <br>  'Al-i-'lmran, No. 3, verse 104<br>  <br>  <br>  Shia 4 Life <br>  <br>  <br>  Live Like Ali (as) <br>  Die Like Hussain (as) <br>  <br>  Thanks Allah That we are not Following Sahih Al Bukhari ?<br>  The Blind Man

Dear neighbor,  In person I would like to welcome you to the neighborhood but never seem to run into you.  We are always happy to have new neighbors. We have lived here since 2002 and all the neighbors have always respected each others privacy and space. We would really appreciate it if you could soften the sound of your stereo in the evenings. Maybe you do not realize how loud it is but it is so loud that we cannot even hear the evening news on our TV. I hope we can get to meet you soon and that we can respect each others space. Thank you.|`|WneD1JMRaa	I would approach them and let them know that the music they play is very loud even in your own home. I would ask them if they could turn it down a notch very politely. If nothing seems to change I would try to make friendly with them. Then I would pop in with a gift. A good set of earphones! You can pick them up fairly cheap. I would be very friendly about it and joke around. They would definately get the point and because you are being so kind to them they should build a level of respect for you. If this doesnt work out I would make a complaint to  who ever owns the building or to the real estate it is rented through. Things could turn sour here but its the only thing you can do after trying your best to be nice! Hopefully you will get a new set of quiet renters!

'There will be signs for true believers and among the signs - In my name they shall cast out devils, they shall speak foreign tongues, new tongues, they shall take up serpents - And if they drink deadly poison, they shall not be harmed - And when they place their hand over the sick, they shall be cured.' This is a scientific test - In scientific terminology, it is known as the 'confirmatory test' for a true Christian believer. In my whole life, I have personally interacted with thousands of Christians, I have not come across a single Christian, who has passed this confirmatory test of the Bible. I have not come across a single Christian who took poison not died. And in scientific terminology, this is also called as the 'falsification test' That means if a false person tries and does this test... takes poison, he will die. And a false person will not dare attempt this test - If you are not a true Christian believer, you will not dare attempt this test. Because you try and attempt the falsification test, you will fail.

5iXcXlMeaa	Nice Question bro!<br>  <br>  As Muslims we should all enjoin the good and forbid the evil as for how many of us actually do this it is a different case. For shias this is one of furoo el deen ( the branches of religion) it is very important in our sect and in Islam in general. This has nothing to do with shia and Sunni but as Muslims we should enjoin the good and forbid the evil to become a stronger United Ummah.<br>  <br>  I will edit soon Inshallah:)<br>  <br>  YA ALI MADAD!<br>  <br>  Amr bil maroof literally means to enjoin the good i.e. encourage the doing of good deeds for the sake of Allah etc…<br>  Nahi anil munkar literally means to forbid the evil.<br>  It is very important in Islam to encourage the good and forbid the evil especially in Shia Islam as it is one of ‘furoo-ul-deen’<br>  <br>  It is mentioned in the Quran in the following verses.<br>  "Those who follow the apostle, the unlettered Prophet, whom they find mentioned in their own (scriptures), - in the law and the Gospel; - for he commands them what is just and forbids them what is evil; he allows them as lawful what is good (and pure) and prohibits them from what is bad (and impure); He releases them from their heavy burdens and from the yokes that are upon them. So it is those who believe in him, honour him, help him, and follow the light which is sent down with him, - it is they who will prosper."<br>  <br>  Another verse:<br>  Let there be people among you, who invite to the best [in religion]; and command that which is just, and forbid that which is evil; and they shall be happy<br>  <br>  The prophet Muhammad pbuh&h said: “My umma ‘Islamic community’ shall be in good condition they enjoin that which is good, forbid that which is wrong, and co-operate in righteousness. If they hesitate, they shall be denied bliss, be dealt high-handedly with each other, and will have no helper on the earth, nor in the heavens!”<br>  This hadith shows the importance of ‘amir bil maroof wal nahi anal munkar’<br>  <br>  Imam Ali a.s has been quoted as saying, “Do not abandon the obligation of enjoining right and forbidding wrong. If you do, your bad folk shall reign supreme over you, and then you will implore God’s grace, yet your prayer would not be answered”.|`|QHo7Cw7uaa	How come the group who is calling others to wards naday Ali (RA)<br>  <br>  O'Ali Help.<br>   <br>  can be the one you mentioned .<br>  <br>  that group is itself missguided <br>  So the group will call others towards Allah not humans .<br>  <br>  so the group who is calling towards Allah 's tawheed and prophet's sunnah is the group mentioned here|`|U5zcbHuZaa	I believe this is referring to the emergence of the final sect under Mahdi, which will include true followers from Shia, Sunni, the other sects and from other religions, as is prophecy.|`|Rb84jDiEaa	A group of ppl called Muslims, they obey Allah ta'ala and His Messenger, Mohammed (pbuh)|`|KNV7oPr3aa	i am a sunni follower of Islam, pray five times a day and follow the sunnah of prophet muhammad (s.a.w)|`|F69CNuYeaa	Asalamu Aleykum.

I'm going to assume this is for a school essay of some type.<br>  <br>  Dying is, by all accounts, a rather scary and unpleasant experience. I haven't died, but I've been VERY close a couple of times, and it was NOT fun. <br>  <br>  Being dead also carries with it several unpleasant side effects, namely that you don't get to do a lot of things in the future. Dead people rarely get invited to the really good parties, (even Heath Ledger had to have someone else pick up his Oscar (tm) for him),  they don't get to go to their kids weddings, they have trouble voting (except in areas where the Democratic Party is strong) and Disney will not admit them to any of the parks under any circumstances.  They also suffer from that whole unpleasant "zombie" stereotype ("Un-living American" is the politically correct term) it severely limits your future employment possibilities, and dead people can't get married (except in Vermont and parts of California). <br>  <br>  Seriously though, the bottom line is everybody has to die sometime. It's not fun, it's not pleasant, you don't get a lot of choice in the matter, but at some point it has to be done. So as long as you are stuck with it, one might as well manage to accomplish something by it. <br>  <br>  A good example would be this <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HMS_Birkenhead_(1845)" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HMS_Birkenh...</a><br>  <br>  That is a good way, and reason to die...so that others may live.|`|GQk0UNjfaa	why?|`|NQnOw4Qbaa	Neh, we all do it sooner than later reason or no reason.

Teenagers often commit suicide to punish their parents, or others.  <br>  <br>  Mass murder/suicides, such as Columbine or Virginia Tech are often rationalized as an effort to punish society for its perceived failure to be "fair" or "just."  <br>  <br>  Addendum:  I sincerely hope you're searching for a literary motive for a paper you are writing, or something like that.

He wrote it that way on purpose, and calling something fiction doesn't make it okay.

However, there is more then one way to end a nightmare. I was really not very interested in living growing up. Death seemed so much easier then life did. I never thought I was going to make it to the age of 21 much less 41. I joined the Army so I could die a hero and make Mom and Dad proud while making my sneaky exit from this hell hole we call life. Well... I made it through that. It was little pen holes of light in my life later that kept me hanging around just to see what happened next. Eventually I decided to kill myself, but not physically. I literally gave up all claim to my life and handed it all over to GOD. I was really sick and tired of myself anyway. It was a really weird concept. I was very serious though. If GOD didn't want me then I could always blow my brains out later. Things started to get real different, and eventually things got better.Later on I met Jesus and from that point on my life was totally turned upside down. And for me that upside down was right side up. Every moment of every miserable day I lived is worth it for one simple reason.<br>  I got to share it with you right here right now. <br>  If I get to look you in the eye one day in Heaven, I would go through all that crap again!<br>  <br>  We need you.<br>  The world needs you. There will be more coming, just like you and me.|`|S4XUl7qWaa	It's the only life you get, so make the best of it. Think of your friends and family, and remember, we have direct influence on 60 different people at any given time, many of them we don't even know!<br>  <br>  Please get help. Life is worth living. You just need some help to see your way through.|`|CugCzH9iaa	PLEASE seek help!!!<br>  <br>  There has to be some good in your life!!!  Perhaps you have a bad habbit of only seeking the bad?  Is it possible for you to find some good to be thankful for?  Even if it is a small thing, it could help you to start trying to see positive things.  Try to daily find just two things to be thankful for, or even just one.  It might save your life.|`|D4LnRg2Daa	In answer to your last question William yes life is worthy and when it bites we bite back.  We need to talk.  I will give you my personal E-mail site.  brothertrucker48@yahoo.ca   You need a friend.  We all do.  Love Kent|`|XBI9ekydaa	You sound clinically depressed.

Your entire tirade here focuses on *your* sorrows.  These sorrows seem to be tied to interactions with other people.  You want other people to interact with you and make *you* feel important.  That, my friend, is not what you ought to be looking for.  If you take your sad self and depend on everybody else to make you happy, you're never going to get there.<br>  <br>  Here's what I'd recommend.  First, seek medical and psychiatric assistance.  If your problems are biological, that will go a long way towards lifting the stormcloud parked over your head.  Secondly, try seeking to be the true friend to others that you want others to be to you.  Volunteer.  Help those who are less fortunate than yourself.  Build houses for people who aren't lucky enough to live in them.  Donate some spare cash so that people can afford to heat their homes and feed their families.  Work in a soup kitchen or food pantry.  Make some lives better.  *That* will go a whole lot further towards a fulfilling existence (and finding some friends for you) than moping that life isn't exactly as you would like it to be.  Pardon my bluntness, but grow up and start thinking about people besides yourself.|`|OB1fa0vjaa	Do you have something precious to you?<br>  You need to go on a WALKABOUT to find your self.  <br>  You need to know that you are not the only person in the world who have this problems.  As I am an outcast I have sinking into the darkness because of what I learn of my loneliness.<br>  But all the sudden all the rules change when I met a friends who haves the same problems.  Suddenly I became Happy and have my moments in life where there are this beautiful memories I don't want to loose. <br>  I know so much your feelings, but as you fight for the dream your purpose in life, you become stronger and live for those persons who are precious to you.                                      It so hard to gloom...|`|Qu1nTLz4aa	At the most difficult times in my life, when I felt overwhelmed and hopeless, I made a goal. Then, every day I made a list of things, even small things, that I could do to achieve my goal. I did something every day, and as I crossed the things that I had done off of my list, I felt less hopeless and helpless.<br>  <br>  I think that the person who suggested a martial arts class was right on.<br>  <br>  Here's the list I think that you should start with.<br>  <br>  1. Live one day at a time. That's all you can do. There's no sense in freaking out about a future that isn't even happening right now.<br>  <br>  2.  Talk to your therapist about your meds. Make the appointment today. <br>  <br>  3. Enroll in a martial arts class.<br>  <br>  4. Take an online test to see if you have Asperger's Syndrome. I know that's a long shot, but hear me out. People that have a hard time making friends and relating to people sometimes have those problems because of AS. If that's the problem, there are other people who have it. As it turns out, they're smart, funny, and interesting.<br>  <br>  5.  Make another list tomorrow.|`|gL8EwNt8aa	First off find things that interest you, don't just do something to gain the approval of others, do something for YOU. For example, if you like art explore a local art museum, if you like the outdoors go on a hiking trip clear your head and get some air, maybe get a dog to keep you company, and last but not least don't go to a therapist, they're only going to tell you what you want to hear and charge you sky high fees; don't take medications....wat are you (no pun intended) crazy?...No medication is going to help yo overcome your "depression" just go out and get some WEED if anything, and then go on a period of self discovery it's not going to happen overnight but it will happen trust me, it's the best medicine.....Hope my advice can help...|`|xR2wnheVaa	William,<br>  <br>  How good that you seek help. Your words... "I know I'm worthless compared to everyone else. I'm like something that should be discarded."<br>  <br>  Satan would like you to think such things. He takes great pleasure in our destruction, or trying.<br>  <br>  Know that God compares you to no one. His value of you is one you should know and seems to be missing. Jesus is the cure giver, but I will walk with you, if you would like to contact me.|`|joZFuLEwaa	Hey sounds like you just made two new friends.  Add me to your contacts as well.  I am now your friend.  Life is difficult for all of us.  Trust me we all struggle.  <br>  <br>  Add me to your list....    :   )|`|2Hot9EJiaa	You should get some help- it seems that you are chemically depressed.  That said, there is ONE person that could release the shackles that bind you- and that person is Jesus Christ.  You asked this question in the religion section, so I know that God is calling you to a personal relationship with Him through Christ.  I am a Christian, and I can tell you my life is not easy either- actually , if you have been on this site for very long you would know that- there are many things that are going on in my  life, for many years that I wish was not there- however with Jesus those issues are not as hard to bear.  It is still not easy. I am not saying "come to Jesus and all your problems will go away"- that is not true. What I am saying is "You can cast your burdens upon Him, and He will help carry your load." You are not worthless in the the eyes of your Creator.  He thought you worthy enough to give you life, and then save you through the shed blood of Christ.  PLEASE do not take your life- call a suicide hot line- so that they can help you as well.  What you dream for your life, may one day come true, but if you take your life you will never know- and believe you me, what dreams God have for you are better than anything we could dream up for ourselves. Please do not do this!

That to continue your insurance out of your pocket. Unless you have a horrific medical issue it's not worth it.|`|URO3gDXcaa	cobra is an extension of insurance you can purchase after you leave a job, up to 18 months in most cases.  you pay 102% of the cost.
2fW267GMaa	I can relate to what you are saying for sure.  I wouldn't say I was desensitized from reality but rather I am more in tune with the natural world around me.  You can definitely sense the energy in objects and people when tripping.  At least I know I can.  Now whether or not these sensations of energy are in fact legitimate and not just a trick the drug is playing on the mind I cannot say.  I know that I trip not only for recreation but to sort of defrag my mind from all the crappy loose ends that develop from living life.  I feel more focused and appreciative of anything and everything after wards.  It is very therapeutic for me.
