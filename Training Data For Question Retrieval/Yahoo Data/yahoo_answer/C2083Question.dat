20090223025721AAFE9qy	Yahoo! Products;Yahoo! Answers	Anybody amused...or even upset at having what appeared to be an innocent question banished from the Y!A page?	Just discovered a question, which I asked on Saturday, concerning the confusion of Britons who still argue that 'it's a free country, innit' while the current government is sticking on the all-catching 'anti-terrorist' laws to apprehend 'crimes' from taking pictures of police on duty to vague laws which enable Labour to arrest anyone for almost anything. Looks like the 'anti-terrorist' skank is being called into use whenever anyone does anything that Labour finds embarrassing, or the police find inconvenient. Just wonder what would have happened if someone had successfully took pictures of Jean Charles de Menezes on the day of his death?     Of course, I will just have to accept there are people on this site who  will get all spiteful when facing a question/answer they do not like (or even the composer), but amazed at how the Y!A 'courtroom' deals with such complaints.

20090223053622AApuQ65	Yahoo! Products;Yahoo! Groups	Help   want to find a different doctor?	Hi, I'm so glad to find this webpage and people with the same trouble I've been though. I've been diagnost with AS Sep 2007. My daughter was born June 2007 and after that I had 2 D&C within 3 month to remove my placenta pieces. I had a hysteroscopy in oct 2007 and got hormone pills to reabuild my tissue. Nothing worked, I haven't had my period and went to a diffrent doctor, he tried to look in the uterus but couldn't get in there. So I had to have another surgery on Jan 8th 2009. Now I had my first period in years, which exited me since we wanted more children. But he also told me that one of my tubes is closed shut by scare tissue and it dose not look much better in my uterus. I've seen this Dr 5 times now and I have a uncomfortable feeling with him.   Can anybody give me a adress to a difrent Dr in the AL or GA area.   Fabien

When i first met my boyfriend 2years ago i managed to fall pregnant twice as result of using no protection.I had the first pregnancy terminated andf the second i had a miscarrage. now a year and abit on it dosent seem to happen. i went on the pill for 13days before stopping it and had sex on my most fertile days, a couple of times a day for a solid 5days. a few days after i started a period. not sure if it was just the bleed that follows stopping the pill but im confused. before something like that would be all it would take for me to get pregnant and now, nothing. im confused could i maybe be infertile?please could i get as many answers as possible because it plays on my mind all the time.are there any tests you can have done? im 19 by the way and my boyfriend is 30, he smokes tobbaco and marajuna and has done for many years and is also diabetic which i am aware can eventually cause impotence.this never stopped me getting pregnant before, could it now be a contributing factor?

20090223073821AAmkAuL	Yahoo! Products;Yahoo! Messenger;Problems with Service	Yahoo Messenger Keeps CRASHING. How do I fix it?	I just recently installed the new Yahoo! messenger on my boyfriends brand new computer two days ago. Yesterday I was using it and it worked fine for about two hours and then just crashed, siad it was having a problem. Every time I tried to re-load it, it'd boot up for about 20 seconds and then crash again. I gave up, since I had to leave anyway, and figured a restart would fix it.  However, I tried again this morning after the computer had been off all night - still crashed. So, I uninstalled and tried again. Still crashed when I loaded it. So I uninstalled and tried AGAIN. And now it is still crashing anytime I try to load it.  PLEASE help. This is incredibly frustrating because it's a brand new computer.
