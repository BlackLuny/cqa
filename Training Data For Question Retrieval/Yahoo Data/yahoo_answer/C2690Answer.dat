DyEIc0K8aa	I am so sorry for you and your dog.... sound like the only thing you can do is wait and see if your dog get better or drive 50 mile to the vet. If it was me I'd be on the way now, but my dog is worth about $1500 to $2000 and is a family member.. Good luck.|`|PM23RDycaa	There is nothing you can do you are either going to have to have her put down in the shelter or make the drive to the vet.|`|Cfk1kr8Daa	The best thing you can do is get her into a crate in the car, and get her to the vet as soon as you can.  There really isn't much you'd be able to do at home, and even if she didn't make it, you would have tried.<br>    I'm sorry there really isn't anything else that comes to mind.|`|54UnlRQnaa	YOU HAVE TO DRIVE THAT DOG TO THE VET AS FAST AS YOU CAN. If the vet cant help you ether have to put it to sleep or let it suffer.<br>                   sorry thats the truth.<br>  <br>  <br>       I would cry to, i never had to do that.|`|Vk6s6VTAaa	Sounds like Canine Vestibular Syndrome. Look it up.|`|8584e0329fb17c662606d5a6a8650ee2aa	I'm not a vet, but your dog has symptoms of vestibular syndrome, which is a bad case of vertigo.  It looks terrible and has symptoms similar to a stroke but the tilted head and darting eyes are classic symptoms.  Most dogs recover from vestibular syndrome.  It is often related to inner ear infections.  Your dog may need supportive care such as fluids to help prevent dehydration.<br>  <br>  Call the vet 50 miles away and get some advice.  I have had a dog with vestibular disease before and this sounds a lot like it.  They may be able to get you some advice to help your dog until you can get your dog there. It may not be life threatening but your dog does need care.|`|UwQw7jyVaa	you need to make that drive i dont think he has a stroke but if thats his sythoms he can pass away hope your dog makes it. dont you have a friend or somthing that can take her there, yeah so just find a way to take her there soon.|`|lPK7Lh4gaa	that does not sound like a storke it sounds like you dog got into posion you need to drive the dog the 50 miles to the vet or it will probably pass away...i hope your dog makes it...good luck|`|kbLcAZYgaa	You have no choice but to go to the vet.  You have to take her quick.  She can make it just give her hope.  <br>  <br>  I pray to God to keep her alive.|`|467868d6bbd75f78eb0f8d83a7f81326aa	This happen my dog and we put him to sleep.

Um8osMNuaa	The yellow foam is bile, caused by a build up of digestive juices when the stomach is empty. <br>  <br>  lf your dog hasn't eaten or drank all day then he will be getting dehydrated, plus being lethargic isn't a good sign, it would be an idea to at least give the vets a ring.|`|8Y583Fluaa	hes fine..he is feeling sick like children do..when he is throwing up yellow and hasnt eatin then it is called dry heaving...we do it to<br>  csr..should shut up..i love animals and have worked with them...yellow foam is dry heaving...i have many animals<br>  EDIT:hmmmi was right..millie gets thumbs up for the exact same thing..im glad your dog is o.k.|`|EWXzNyk8aa	The yellow foamy stuff he is throwing up is caused by him not eating. His stomach is empty so that is all he has to throw up. Not sure why he is throwing up though? Try getting him to eat, if you have to - put food in his mouth and make him eat something. He needs to have something in his stomach. If he really refuses not to eat you need to take him to the vet, there is probably something going on with your little guy.|`|vAH98IE2aa	REVISE_Do NOT Listen to Polly Snider or Gsdluvrr They have NO Business answering questions and if they love animals should stop answering question they have no clue about, as their answers if listened to could KILL your pet.

Save a life quit answering questions on Pet health!<br>  Please give me more information...<br>  Has your dog recently been vaccinated?<br>  Has he had normal bowel movements?<br>  Have you seen any blood in vomit or stool?<br>  If you push slightly around his abdomen is there any sign of pain?<br>  Has he had access to any other area's such as neighbors-parks-etc.?<br>  Is there any sign of liquid sneezing or drainage from the eyes or nose?<br>  You said 7 hours ago When did he become lethargic?<br>  These are all questions that need to be answered before any one can accurately help you as there are Many reasons a dog or cat vomit and when they become lethargic it is not a good sign especially when the animal is not retaining food or fluids they can rapidly become dehydrated and and increase toxicity levels.  This sounds very serious it can be anything from poisoning, toxic ingestion-Toad, mushroom or such- digestive disorder- to liver problems and more.. Please get this little guy to the vet ASAP... Thanks Little House of Furry and Feathered Friends Rescue Center...|`|0le6RYndaa	If you had a child and they were throwing up yellow foam, weren't eating or drinking, and were acting lethargic....what would you do?|`|Cfk1kr8Daa	This is a tiny dog with a serious problem.<br>    Take him to the vet, before your dog has 'run his course'.|`|iDEMzrNhaa	A dog would not throw up yellow if it had eaten grass.  It would be green!  <br>  <br>  He could have parvo.  Animals that get it don't eat or drink and act very tired all the time.  That is a very serious disease in a dog and since he is so small it really isn't good.  Dogs and humans are nothing alike and dogs get different sicknesses then humans.  <br>  <br>  I would worry if I were you.  Take him to the vet ASAP.|`|AOCwkR7caa	Did he by any chance eat grass?

zRyGcN6yaa	The Shiba Inu is really ok. I have one, and she was like that when she was a pup. Dont worry. She just has to get used to her surroundings. She might not trust everything quite yet. And im sorry. i dont know anything about corgis.|`|gwUMipsUaa	She'll eventually come out of her shell.  Only have her in the crate for potty training purposes and when you can't watch her.|`|tPGxPDvBaa	It can take them quite a while time comfortable in their new surrounding. They are more of solitary dogs & aren't  really outgoing esp. depending on their breeding. Unfortunately they have gotten popular & there are now many poorly bred ones.

She may have an oral fungus, or a bad tooth infection. If you have just never looked, and if it's flat, and not swollen and sore looking, it's probably just natural coloration. There is an old wives tale that if your cat or dog has a dark roof on their mouth, that they are extra smart. I dunno about that. But I have had many animals with dark spots on the roofs of their mouths with no problems at all.|`|5ee0364dd7d0159e953e987902e16956aa	Maybe she's getting on in age.

h7Z4cMGFaa	Chickens will not over eat.  Tractor Supply Company has feeders and waterers that would work.<br>  <br>  What you could use for a water is A) an open container full of water BUT it will get very nasty and require cleaning often or B) get a "jug" or "bell" type drinker - they are typically red.  It has an automatic watering mechanism in it and as long as there is a constant flow of water to it - via a water hose - they will have water.  If you cannot find one of these the "poultry fountain" from TSC would work too.<br>  <br>  Feeders are a little bit more difficult because depending on the form of feed you are feeding it may get stuck in the feeder and not fall very well.

8OvTtGiZaa	Tell people they taste good.|`|tPGxPDvBaa	I doubt you would do much business on-line. You would do better trying to sell them at vet offices, grooming shops & small pet stores. We had ppl who buy cutesy treats for their dogs as a special treat after being groomed & if they knew it benefited dog charities, they would be even more inclined to buy them.  The same would apply to vet offices also. So try these places first, it cost a lot for shipping/handling to be sure they don't get broken.  Be sure to make different varieties in cute or odd shapes - ppl like that better than just plain bone shaped ones.|`|lTsDwY9Paa	Package them in resealable bag if you're selling them several at a time or in cling wrap if you're selling them individually. Contact your local vet offices and shelter and see if they'll sell some for you. An ad in the paper could help too. Ebay and craigslist could work but you have to be 18 to set up an account so your parents would have to help and you run the risk of not getting your money. I've considered doing the same thing for a little extra money.|`|Cfk1kr8Daa	This sort of business requires a lot more than you think - you would need to have a kitchen inspected by the board of health, and professional insurance, as well as probably a vendor's license.<br>  <br>    This isn't stuff you can really 'just do' - you could get in a lot of trouble.<br>  <br>    I would suggest you try petsitting in your neighborhood, or making bandannas and dog clothes - something that doesn't involve food.<br>   <br>    You're a great kid for wanting to help and being willing to work for it, though!

In 40 years I have never known a pig that didn't love fresh grass.  For those who are worried about grass, remember that hay was grass before it was hay and we all feed loads of hay!  Grass is a good addition to the selection of fresh greens that you use.|`|11Vgs45Naa	^Feeded meat? First off, it's fed, and second, they are strict herbivores, NO meat whatsoever.<br>  <br>  <br>  You should not feed your guinea pig grass regularly, or replace his diet with mainly grass. Every other day is a little bit much.

It's kind of expensive (well, I think so!), but well worth it for many people.  Your vet will know all about that, too.

tPGxPDvBaa	If your pup is ill, then his poop will smell worse than normal.<br>  <br>  Ppl who don't have dogs, they will smell more to them cuz they aren't used to the odor & probably your mom isn't happy about having a pup messing in the home. Be very careful with what you are cleaning the dog's crate with. Your dog could be getting ill from the chemicals & many dog are sensitive to the chemicals & will break out or have skin problems. Same applies to using a bunch of sprays right around your pup too.  He doesn't need to be breathing in all those chemicals. Use either vinegar or bleach to clean then rinse very well.<br>  <br>  I use a candle warmer in my home. They are cheap to buy($5) & you can use any jar candle.  You don't have to worry about flames & get plenty of scent. Place one nearby(not where pup can reach it or cord) & buy $1 candles & use to help cover odor.|`|3p6wp7DYaa	First of all, the smell from a sick dog is much worse than from a normal dog. So get him to the vet asap and have him looked at and diagnosed. Second, all dogs smell a little, just like every human does, except we are all so used to it that we don't smell it anymore. So I think in a couple of weeks your mom will get used to it too, as long as the dog is not having diarrhea in his cage anymore.<br>  <br>  Another important point is to avoid using all of those harsh chemicals around a young, sick dog. This is dangerous. Using those cleaners in his cage is an extremely ill-advised idea, as puppies chew on everything. You need to get him a new cage or make sure the chemicals are 100% gone from it, which I wouldn't know how to do. <br>  <br>  And take the puppy out to go potty every hour to avoid having him mess up his crate. Dogs loathe to sleep where they toilet so he might be very uncomfortable with this situation. Besides, he probably can smell his waste even after you clean it with all of those products and he will be much harder to house break if you get him to associate the crate with going to the bathroom. Use a specially formulated enzymatic cleaner available at pet stores to eliminate the odors.|`|IEsudy2xaa	to be fair all poo smells and if the pup has diarrhea then it is goimg to be even stronger be careful when you are washing his cage out puppys like to lap everything up and pups should not be washed to often unless they are properly dried and kept warm anything with lemon in it usualy takes smells away such as lemon flash hope the vet can advise you and help with his diarrhea all the best|`|HXt3R4cQaa	do not put him in a cage!!!

For that, take it to a professional groomer to really get him clean.  And yes, diarrhea smells worse than normal poop.  So find out what is wrong with your dog.<br>  Then go to antiickypoo.com  This stuff is expensive, but if it works it is worth it.  I have 4 dogs and 2 cats and one dog has been peeing for some unknown reason in the house. And on wood floors!|`|IZz6mkOFaa	yes to that question on the diarrhea...that could be affecting his smell....probably his breath and everything about him...his food could also be doing it, along with being a siberian husky for their coat is oily and does carry an odor to it.   Growing up and being outside more will make it subside some.  But maybe your mother has a real sensitive nose also and his smell might always bother her...please tho quit using the pinesol and all of the other chemical cleaners..that might have given him the poops...try looking for a natural cleaner to clean where he plays and sleeps...remember they lick their feet and even if you rinse and rinse some might still get on his feet and than he licks even if you let the floor dry before you let him back on it<br>  Good luck|`|AVsh5aJUaa	before the dogs comeback from the vet go to sams club if you have one and the have a dog wash that get rid of the smell in the kennel and if you don't have a sam's club find something with citrus in it......and if the dog has parvo yes there poop will smell  like death warm over
c4363680d99aa97b5b90edd1a11e17a2aa	Are you using it in your home to stop cats using a spot for peeing? If so, I had this problem and I used Citronella pure essential oil neat on cotton wool balls and placed them in the areas effected. It is also useful in deterring cats outside in your garden. Add a couple of drops to used teabags and place around the garden for a completely natural and biodegradable solution that won’t harm or distress pets/animals or children. The oil will need to be re-applied every few days or after heavy rain. Hope this helps
px27V5N9aa	I would let mine soak overnight to be ready for the AM feeding (about 16 hours) and from the AM to PM feeding it was about an 8 hour soak (or less).<br>  During the hot months you don't want it to soak all day in the heat.  It's best to not let it sit longer than 4-6 hours in a hot barn.  Our grain room was cool so we kept the bucket soaking inside of a covered tub so it was cooler plus out of the flies reach.<br>  <br>  You only need to soak it long enough to soften it. If you use hot water it will only take about 10 minutes!  I like to have an electric tea kettle on hand for these purposes.  No long soaks.|`|RUzBDX6Jaa	however long you want.  The more sugarbeat, the more time to soak.  Both are right.  Basically anything works.<br>  EDIT<br>  If you are worried about mould, just soak it for 24 hours.  If you have lots of horses to feed then just one week is good.  longer than that, it'll mould.|`|5QG9Zrjaaa	Beat pulp should be soaked at least an hour for a single serving size.  When keeping it, it will depend on the temperature where it is kept.  In the summer, 12-24 hours is max here where it gets to 100F; after that, it gets sour smelling.  When it smells sour, it is fermented and should not be fed.  When fermented, it is turning into a type of vinegar or beer.  Horses really don't digest that well.<br>  <br>  In the winter, you can keep it longer as it doesn't turn sour as fast.|`|7p8spyFHaa	I soak ours in hot water for 30-40 minutes. It's warm then and the horses love it- especially our 28 year old Appy!
YnCUyvK7aa	Yes they do.  I own 2 of these.<br>  <br>  I'm not sure what the *motor wheel* would be, maybe the same thing?  <br>  <br>  But if it's trickling, something must be moving the water.  Have you tried the flow adjustment at the top of the U tube?  It can about shut off the flow too.<br>  <br>  ADDED  It seems like they're must just calling the impeller a motor wheel.

I have dealt with many resource dogs in my time and I am here to tell you your family did their best...you were fighting not only demons you don't know (past issues) but if the dog was beaten and had seizures many health issues could have been the perpetrator of the growing aggressive behavior.  <br>  I believe that you dog was a sweetie deep inside...the picture shows that hon...but past issues are so hard for them to battle.  It is like people who have post traumatic stress disorder...people can talk and reason things out but dogs do not have that privilege.  I have worked with many some respond after 6 months - 1 year...some just can't.  It's not that they don't want to...they just don't have the ability that it takes to trust any other commands than the instincts they have of their own.  People have failed them and sometimes the wounds infect the entire fiber of who they are and cannot be erased.  <br>  I am sorry for your loss love.  But I am sure that your dog knew he was your best friend...and I am sure he loved your family...he just couldn't trust enough to let go of the past.  It's not your fault, or your families fault, nor was it your dogs fault.  It was a past full of brutal treatment which invariably stole the ability he would have had to live a normal, healthy life with you.<br>  What a kind a gentle person you are to care still to this day.  I hope you get another dog sometime when you are ready...that dog will have a wonderful gift of a great family.  <br>  Tolerance for children - many are fine with children - I believe it is how we train them when younger on how they respond to children, other dogs, environment.<br>  I wish you a life time of happiness.  You deserve it.|`|ad9efc98eb0fbeeae6b6c4abfd63046caa	if he was locked in a bathroom for most of his life that is abuse and the previous owner s should have been prosecuted and taken to court no wonder the poor little thing went the way he did shame on them and god bless your family for taking him in|`|teDI6RQ8aa	Sounds like the dog developed neurological problems.  The dog should have seen a vet.  If this couldn't have been fixed, the dog should have been put down at that time it was starting it's aggressiveness instead of yet being bounced to another place a few years later.  But that's in the past.<br>  <br>  Edit: As for the kids issue, Young kids and small dogs really are not a good match.<br>  <br>  Edit: But the problem wasn't getting fixed, and when problems aren't being fixed, you either see another vet and/or have the dog put down.   You were a kid, so you didn't have any control over this.  I would not have let it go on, and then given the dog away.  I would have either done what I could to fix it, and if it couldn't be fixed, I would have had the dog euthanized.

Not a huge high powered one, but just a little one and every-time your cat goes anywhere, or does anything you don't want them to, just give them a little squirt of water and at the same time say no, and naughty in a firm distinctive voice! Keep on doing this at every moment you need to stop your cat from being, but in your eyes naughty and soon your cat will associate the word NO with getting wet and be a good kitty in future... <br>  <br>  Another technique when your cat is doing, or going somewhere you don't want them to, and that's to give your cat a very gentle finger flick behind the ear!.This wont hurt the cat, but will make them learn that they are not doing what you want them to do..Remember to say No and naughty at the very same time.<br>  <br>  Another technique especially for slow owners and fast cats who are too fast for a squirt of water or clip behind the ear..To do this, all you will need is a couple of tin pots.Give them a big bang together when they jump on the table and they will soon learn! <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <a href="http://i244.photobucket.com/albums/gg18/cuteaddiction/kittycups.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://i244.photobucket.com/albums/gg18/...</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://images.marketworks.com/hi/50/49711/AHFramed0124-620.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://images.marketworks.com/hi/50/4971...</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.storeappeal.com/images/CUTE_KITTENS023.JPG.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://www.storeappeal.com/images/CUTE_K...</a>|`|aPwsYXlraa	Here are a few sites of pics of kittens hope it helps:)<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.kitten-gro.com/photo_gallery.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.kitten-gro.com/photo_gallery....</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.kasiakatz.com/photo_gallery.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.kasiakatz.com/photo_gallery.h...</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.magictails.com/cutekitties.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.magictails.com/cutekitties.ht...</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://cats.about.com/od/catpictures/ig/Just-Kittens/" rel="nofollow">http://cats.about.com/od/catpictures/ig/...</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://pets.webshots.com/album/551997485BJtYPT" rel="nofollow">http://pets.webshots.com/album/551997485...</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.cats-central.com/cat-pictures/cute_kitten_pictures_gallery.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.cats-central.com/cat-pictures...</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://kittens.sytes.org/" rel="nofollow">http://kittens.sytes.org/</a>|`|yVbguDvbaa	You are welcome to go to my myspace page and look at my cat pics.

Im44orotaa	yes dogs are pack animals so they like to be around other dogs... but as someone previously pointed out it does depend on the animal. Cats are solitary but some cats love other cats.<br>  <br>  Also you should do some research on breeds because it does vary breed to breed.<br>  for instance some breeds do much better with a companion.|`|P85LVLCTaa	well my dog doesn't get along with most dogs, but sometimes he does,|`|x3RBy8Ljaa	Dogs are pack animals so the answer is yes they like to be around other dogs.<br>  <br>  Cats are solitary so no, they don't necessarily like to be around other cats.

39a2d5e9bc3c417cbdc5ba33cb6386bbaa	Get a water test kit.  API master liquid test kit for freshwater is a good one.  That way you can test everything yourself.  I don't really know why it would smell really bad.  Your tank is obviously going through a bacterial bloom since you added two fish and didn't cycle first.  There is probably an ammonia spike and that could be the cause of the smell.  Keep doing small water changes and get a test kit so you can make sure ammonia doesn't get too high.  Soon the ammonia should turn to nitrite and then to nitrate, which is safe under 40 ppm.  Ammonia and nitrite on the other hand are toxic and can kill or at the least stress out your fish.  Lastly, the pleco is going to out grow the 10 gallon. <br>  Test kit <a href="http://www.drsfostersmith.com/product/prod_display.cfm?c=3578+4345+4454&pcatid=4454" rel="nofollow">http://www.drsfostersmith.com/product/pr...</a><br>  About the nitrogen cycle  <a href="http://www.drsfostersmith.com/pic/article.cfm?c=3578&articleid=1165&category=266" rel="nofollow">http://www.drsfostersmith.com/pic/articl...</a>|`|sNsdERusaa	First of all, you should NEVER put fish in a tank until it is already cycled. Best thing to do is take the Betta and Plecostumus and clean the tank, gravel, ornaments, thermometer and filter REALLY good. Then, put more water in it, set the temperature at about 75 and get the pH at about 7. Let the tank run for a week without the pH and temp changing. After that you can add your fish to the tank. I wouldn't recommend a Betta in a community tank, though. While waiting for your tank to cycle, see if a friend can take in the fish.<br>  <br>  Here is some more detailed info on starting a Freshwater Aquarium...<br>  <a href="http://www.fishlore.com/Beginners.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.fishlore.com/Beginners.htm</a>|`|BFTjTpy9aa	Plecos CAN'T be in a 10 gallon!!<br>  he'll grow and u'll stunt his growt<br>  (don't worry I made the same mistake)<br>  And you need to research the NItrogen cycle<br>  It's the pleco food that smells<br>  what i advise youfirst take back the fish to do go to this link<br>  <a href="http://70.151.72.168/SDLocator/DealerLocatorStart.php" rel="nofollow">http://70.151.72.168/SDLocator/DealerLoc...</a><br>  and see who sell stabitity (this will grow good bactiria to get rid of ammonia)<br>  PLEASE DON"T MAKE THE SAME MISSTAKE I DID!|`|xarKlp0Oaa	I just got a new fish tank 5 weeks ago and this happened to me too. Go to  a walmart and get clear water in the fish section and it totally works along with taking out 50% of the water and putting new in first.

IxuMTGd4aa	Hmm ... are you SURE your ready to breed AGs?<br>  <br>  That is the most popular bird for "abandoning their chicks" because they are so emotional, intelligent, and smart birds, the SLIGHTEST thing or too much interaction can cause them to abandon their babies, and I've had a few pairs KILL a mate.<br>  <br>  African greys are the most hardest birds to breed (other than macaws and a few other birds) and these are birds you actually NEED to research! AGs aren't popular, are a emotional wreck, you most likely need to hand feeed, and these are budgies and cockatiels!<br>  <br>  Budgies and cockatiels are easy to breed, and most of the time, people don't even research but they have healthy babies. But AGs, they are a totally different story!<br>  <br>  But it depends on the basement. <br>  <br>  Is it large enough? <br>  Is it sound proof? <br>  Is it warm enough? <br>  Do you have any windows or mirros?<br>  Is the basement finished?<br>  Air purifiers?<br>  Is the basement used often?<br>  Does it have any cracks? <br>  Any drafts or heat waves? <br>  Is it bird-safe? <br>  Are there any other birds in the basement?<br>  <br>  - AGs need a VERY large breeding cage to breed. It may even take up half the basement, and all the supplies might take up a closet. You need to have room, and plenty of it!<br>  <br>  - The birds get L-O-U-D when they mate, feed, and just plain talk to each other! Plus the babies screech, and your neighbors might not appreciate that. If ti isn't sound proof, then don't. The people around you and in your house might suffer because of the noise! You might be able to sound proof it by insulators, but that's not one hundred percent safe.<br>  <br>  - They NEED to harm a warm place! It doesn't have to be warm, per say, but ti needs to be at least a little wamr so that you could go down their naked without feeling cold! < Don't really do that, just to prove a point and give you an idea.<br>  <br>  - If it has cracks, snakes, insects, CATS, and Lord knows what else can get in! Not to mention drafts, the cold, dirt, bacteria, rats/mice, and anything else that could get in and harm your bird. Fill the cracks with cement, or insulate it. It isn't safe at all to have open cracks.<br>  <br>  - If it is used often, the idea of breeding them in the basement just flew out the window. As stated before, these birds are very intelligent and emotional, and they will feel threatened with people going near their babies, cage, and nesting area. Plus this is the reason most AG pairs mutilate their babies.<br>  <br>  - Do you have any windows, or mirrors there? If you do, that's bad. When the babies start to fly (fledge) they will fly into windows and hurt themselves, or fly into mirrors. Plus the parents will feel threatened by the 'other' bird by them. Make sure all doors are closed, too! If you DO have any mirrors or windows, just cover them up by a blanket, or remove the mirrors.<br>  <br>  - Make sure the basement is finished! Like make sure it is dry-walled, has carpet, wamr, good enough to LIVE in, has heating,has some perches and furniture here and there for them to perch on, things like that. Oh! and if you DO finish the basement before breedings, props to you! But make sure you wait seven days to let the paint dry and the fumes to go away.<br>  <br>  - Air purifier? The babies do STINK, and they make nasties! I call the babies poop pasties, don't know why, just do. And they paste A LOT in the nest box, and this can cause respiratory infections. Make sure you have a bird-safe air purifier to get rid of the stinkies and clean the air.<br>  <br>  - Well, duh, it should be bird safe! The babies are very wreckless, and so are the parents. Make sure you have no windows (that are covered up), mirrows, breakable things, sharp things, poisonous things, food, water, or anything they could get trapped or lost in. This is a very important factor, too!<br>  <br>  - If there are other birds there, don't! The AGs will fear threatened, harassed, and won't have privacy, and will be very stressed with other birds around. They will even try to KILL the other birds, and the other birds will do the same, but vice versa. This puts a lot of stress on the parents. Oh! And most of the time, the other birds in the basement will try to hurt the new birds, or n00bies.<br>  <br>  As you can tell, there are a TON of things you need to think about! So think about this carefully, and please do the right thing. If you have ANY questions, email me.<br>  <br>  Email : CockatielLover1998@yahoo.com<br>  <br>  Wow, do you KNOW how long that took me!?|`|cfblRvE3aa	African Grey's are temperamental so be careful.and mold is very dangerous.but read up on breeding you can not throw a male and female together and hope they breed they.you should get an already prove pair.breeding pairs are not pets they will be aggressive and not like you much.and you may spend allot of time and effort for nothing.|`|6KxBqnstaa	Would not recommend the basement as a place to breed birds.

R.= CORRECT AND SMART!|`|K5IOSGXAaa	Birds need several hours of natural sunlight a day and the adult birds will not want to breed if they don't have this to stimulate them. I don't know how you are going to accomplish this in a basement. Plus all the other things the previous poster put in her answer.|`|qeOlkRM0aa	Assuming you've met all of the conditions listed above, do you have any idea how many years this can take?

3EaFjsA8aa	A 10 week old puppy is still just a baby.  They can not "hold it" like an adult dog.<br>  <br>  Puppies pretty much eat, play, poop and sleep.  Until he is at least 4 months old don't expect him to hold it for long periods of time.<br>  <br>  You need to have him on a schedule.  Eat and 15 minutes later go outside to potty.  Always, stand in the same place and give the same command... "go potty" or whatever you want to say.  Make sure not to play with him until he goes potty.  Once he potties outside make a HUGE deal about.. "oh good boy. good boy"  The more praise the quicker they learn.<br>  <br>  The throat thing???  That I don't know about.. did you get him from a Pet Store?? Sometimes the dogs are thrown around by the millers that sell the dogs to the pet store and by the pet store employees.  They just grab them around the neck and toss them from one cage to another.  They could have hurt his neck.  I have seen that before...|`|gwUMipsUaa	Potty training takes a couple months.  As for throat noises, all dogs make snorts and whatever else.  Puppies do sleep a lot.<br>  <br>  Schedule an appointment with your vet as well.  It's always best to do that shortly after getting a puppy or dog.|`|s4OtfZ7Gaa	you really need a confined area or crate to keep him in when you are not able to supervise. when the dog is out roaming around your house he needs to be under total supervision this way you can tell when he starts to 'sniff around' and get him directly outside. if he has an accident and you dont catch it, it's too late to correct, and the more that happens the harder it's going to be to house train him. if you correct him after the fact he will only hide from you the next time he has to potty. when you do take him outside, encourage him to go in the same area every time. if you catch him actually having an accident, make a loud noise and get him outside immediately. when he goes outside, keep treats handy and tell him good boy and give him a treat when he is done. dont say good boy when he is using the bathroom, as this may cause him to not finish going. the key to house training is to keep a consistent schedule and to keep him under constant supervision when he is inside. <br>  as for the sleeping, it's perfectly normal for a young pup to sleep most of the time. and i doubt the noises are anything to worry about.|`|nBehRANyaa	Take him outside, to the same area, when he wakes up, before bed, after he eats, and every hour in between.  Praise and give him a treat whenever he 'goes' in the right place.  When he's inside, watch him closely and be ready to rush him out if needed.  You can attach his leash to you so that he has to stay near you and can't sneak off to do his thing.   When you can't supervise, confine him to a small, easily-cleaned room.  Walk him before confining him, and don't leave him for more than an hour or two at a time.  <br>  <br>  The more consistent you are, the quicker he'll be trained.  It shouldn't take months to train a pup.<br>  <br>  Puppies do sleep a lot, in between bursts of playful energy.|`|rEGSK0m8aa	the first thing to remember about house training a puppy is there ability to hold themselves is limited. a rule of thumb is they can hold "it" usually 1 hour for each month of age. 2 months old = 2 hours, 3 months old = 3 hours, etc. when your puppy wakes up (morning, nap, whatever) the pup has to go, right then! take the pup out. when the pup eats or drinks, it has to go, take the pup out. after exercise (play), take the pup out. when the pup does it's thing outside praise it. a lot. tell the pup how good, how smart it is. you have to pay attention to the pups "looking for it's spot" behavior. when you see that behavior indoors, whisk the pup out. if you catch the pup in the act, simply tell it "NO!" and whisk it outside. if you find a puddle or pile after the fact, clean it up with an enzyme cleaner (pet food store) get a newspaper and hit.... yourself in the head and say "i should have been paying more attention" daytime training they get pretty fast. night time training is easier if you crate train the pup. also remember the one hour/one month rule. you will have to get up through the night to take the pup out. good luck|`|IZz6mkOFaa	I have been raising these littkle DEVILS for 30 some years...and they are one of the hardest to housebreak but dont let that get you down.  The best way is to confine..DO NOT let him have the run of the house..even after he has relieved himslef outside...hey have a very short attention span so relaly dont start remembering much til they are at leat 6 months old...do get him neutered for they are notoriuos leg lifters....I can let my young boy right now run the house while I watch everything he does for about an hour..and half way trust him..he is 9 months old.   They are a wonderful breed but most of the time they outwit their owners and so end up finding new homes for the owners do not know how to cope.

When we trained our pup he was limited to one room, the family room.  We watched him like a hawk and we had a time schedule for when he needed to go potty.  His feeding and water was also given the same time every day.  Since your puppy is so small, you may want to attach the puppy to you using a leash.  Once the pup has an idea where to go and where not to go he should earn more freedom.  I strongly suggest bell training.  We have a bell hung on the back door that our pup now rings to alert us when he needs to go out...no more scheduled potty breaks needed once he understands what to do.  To do the bell training I would say "outside" while ringing the bell and open the door, he would do his business and would be praised.  Once he saw the connection with the bell ringing and the door opening...he began ringing on his own.  Sometimes I would put treats in the bell at the beginning for more encouragement.  But he was always taken outside for a potty break if that bell rang.  Make sure you really praise when your pup potties outside...and only scold with a "no" and scoop rushing puppy outside when puppy is caught in the act of doing pottying inside.  They have great training videos on www.petfinder.com|`|AVsh5aJUaa	what a mini pin and at 10 weeks they should be play eating pooping and playing and sleeping unless depressed or sick be consistent when training call your vet and ask about the noise with the throat
aCqSF87Raa	If dad can't talk to mom about it or if they can't reach an agreement, then it isn't time for your family to have a dog. This is something THEY must decide TOGETHER.

Ask dad to talk to her again. Ask them if there is anything you can DO to show them how much you want to help out - get a job, volunteer at a shelter, pick up more chores.

Since the journey to most stars take light years, the NASA's concept is to cryogenically  freeze the astronauts and then thaw them out at the end of the journey.<br>  <br>  <br>  The problem with the goldfish idea is that when you put the goldfish in the freezer it takes  long period of time to actually freeze the body, By this time the animal is dead and parts of the body has already decayed. <br>  <br>  Cryogenic freezing is when the animal is frozen instantly so that the animal never die and the organs are still functions when thawed out. <br>  <br>  Good question.<br>  <br>  <br>  -rds|`|yE2vM76naa	Actually - freezing is a method many people resort to as euthanasia precisely because it does kill....|`|IrdZKYT3aa	Why?

Put the warm water on your hamster, then the soap with water, and leave the soapy mix, on for a few minutes, you will see the fleas Dying, carefully rinse your hamster- watch out for his "NOSE" and eyes. this drys out his skin- as condition should be applied- leave that on a couple minutes- then rinse him, CAREFULLY- <br>  AND SLOWLY, watch his NOSE !! <br>  <br>  Dry him in a Face cloth Slowly and Gently ! Keep him WARM  the whole time !! <br>  <br>  You will need someone else to clean OUT his ENTIRE CAGE- with HOT SOAPY Water- use Palmolive- to Kill all the FLEAS and EGGS in His Cage !! Put his cage (else where) so they can Not return !!<br>  <br>  You will need to De-FLEA your Home- and bring in a Professional. He can NOT be there @ the time- or he will DIE from the Toxic- Chemicals. Bring him Out of the Home on this day- and he needs to Stay OUT of the home- about 12 hours after it was sprayed.

G0KKfXMUaa	I'm going to go about it as if you rode english. Though, same pretty much goes for Western besides the posting.<br>  <br>  From trot to walk-<br>  <br>  Sit up tall and think of when you want to stop. Once you want to slow to a walk, stop posting, sit the trot deep, and gently pull back on the reins and say a low "Woooahhh". If he doesn't stop, pull back on the reins a little harder and then release when he stops. If you keep persistent with this method, the horse will learn your cues for when you want him to stop, and all will be smoother.<br>  <br>  From canter to trot-<br>  <br>  This is a little more difficult, especially if your horse is bouncy. As you're cantering, and want to stop, remember to sit up very tall with your shoulders back. Keep your heels down and your leg secure to the horse and saddle. Sit deep, say a low "woahh" and pull back and be prepared to begin posting. Once he goes into the trot, post. After you trot a few strides, prepare to walk. While wanting to slow or transition down from the canter, I can't stress enough on sitting up tall though.<br>  <br>  Good luck =)<br>  <br>  Edit-<br>  <br>  Okay, good. So if you ride English, all of the following advice was for that. Just remember, lots of practice.|`|iiNAJfGCaa	A half halt, when done correctly, will steady your horse and "recollect" them in order to achieve a smoother transition. Make sure you are sitting back during the downward transitions as well.|`|JFuVm9k5aa	work on all your trasition son a daily basis. <br>  <br>  halt to walk<br>  halt to trot<br>  halt to canter<br>  walk to trot<br>  walk to canter<br>  trot to canter<br>  walk to halt<br>  trot to halt<br>  canter to halt<br>  <br>  etc. do them all over and over and by doing ALL your transitions over and over it will improve your seat, legm and hands and improve your horses stifles and "wake them up" a little to your aids. it will also become so much easier once you can suceesfully do all of them. if you can do a canter to a halt then doing trot to walk will be easy as pie!<br>  <br>  do all the transitions, you and your horse will improve at least 30% in all other areas of your ridiing because your horse will be more awaree of you and what you may ask during a ride. <br>  <br>  of course you wont be able to do all of these over night but you get the point.<br>  <br>  alo, when doing up ward transitions never lean forward because you are "helping your horse instead of encouraging them to create their own energy and bring themselves up and forward. make sure you have even contact on your legs and have connection through the horses mouth but not too much of course. <br>  <br>  when doing downward transitions, never lean forward (duh) make sure to sit deep, keep your hands quiet and bring the horse down with your seat not your hands. dont throw your legs forward and make sure to keep your legs at the girth and consistant. dont just stop ridig or take your leg off because you are coming down a transition. you should always have contact with your horse.<br>  <br>  hope i helped!|`|KuBDXQTlaa	Lots of practice. When I first started riding horses, my transitions were really sloppy. I kept practicing until I got better, and better. Now, since I practiced a lot, and since I practiced my transitions, I got 1st place ribbons and reserve champion. Hope this helps, and good luck!|`|Nh3ZDjwhaa	Collect your trot and then slow it down then go to a walk. From canter to trot, slow down your canter and body motion.|`|NArS7hYEaa	try to slowly change from walk to trot, or from canter to trot. just be very calm with it. have plenty of space.|`|EqHlogAJaa	i know it can get frusterating, but you just have to do it again and again and again. repetition is how i've been taught and our transitions have drastically improved!!
Um8osMNuaa	Dogs should only be bathed at the most once a month, and then only if it is absolutely necessary. <br>  You are stripping his skin of essential oils, that's what is causing the dry skin, which will cause scratching and can lead to skin infections and cause even more problems.<br>  Why would gravel be a reason for needing a bath? l've got a gravel patio area and paths in my garden, they don't cause the dogs to get dirty, and l've got three dogs.|`|80S8U7Edaa	Best shampoo for itchy or dry skin:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.gingerpuplane.com/p89/comfy-dog/product_info.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.gingerpuplane.com/p89/comfy-d...</a><br>  <br>  Excellent moisturizing conditioner treatment:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.gingerpuplane.com/p87/fur-butter-or-fur-worse/product_info.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.gingerpuplane.com/p87/fur-but...</a>|`|tPGxPDvBaa	Puppies tend to have dry or flaky skin to begin with & over bathing is making it worse. Brushing your pup is more important than bathing & yes even short haired dogs need to be brushed.  It doesn't matter if he is getting into gravel & sand, both brush out easily from the coat & doesn't need to be bathed. Try adding a fish oil capsules a day to his food & stop bathing to no more than once a  month. Dogs smell & get dirty, it's all part of owning one. They don't need to be bathed every time you think they are a lil dirty or smelly that will only destroy their coat & skin & mean more vet bills for you.|`|3p6wp7DYaa	First of all, try not to bathe the dog so much. Even if there is dirt outside, maybe you should just try to brush it off and wipe off the debris with a moist paper towel. When you do bathe him, use the shampoo recommended by the vet and avoid hot water.<br>  <br>  Another point is that dry skin can be caused by poor nutrition or allergies. Since you don't say what you feed the dog it is impossible to make an assessment. Some dogs are allergic to corn, wheat, soy, dairy, chicken, beef, and other things. Some dog foods do not have the proper amounts of fatty acids needed for healthy skin and coat. And some dogs are allergic to flea saliva, to dust, pollen, mold and other environmental substances, which can cause constant itching and scabbing.|`|Lq4LXs7kaa	ya u probably do mathe him toooooo much ur suppose to only once a month if very necessary......u can look at a pet store and find some moisturizers and creams for dry skin|`|WYItM0YTaa	our dog trainer said you can also mix raw egg into the food every now and then

I don't think you'd need insurance either, especially if you are donating your products to charity.  I'd suggest donating the treats to the charity and letting them sell them, or donating them and you sell them under the name of the charity.  Then you don't even need any sort of business license.

It's not usually a problem anyway as compared to other rodents their waste is very dry and doesn't smell much.<br>  <br>  Be very wary of exercise wheels too - great for hamsters, but can be dangerous for gerbils if the gaps are big enough for them to get their tails caught, as they have bones in their tails. Solid wheels with no gaps are best.
GaSK15Kpaa	it was 3 weeks for me but that was because i was scared.. my hammy has never ever bit me and ive had him 6 months now.! He rules!!

Hope I helped you at least a little bit.|`|oNHtVHzsaa	it sounds like he already is. it is different for each hamster, but if you do it right usually about a week. u must have done really well : ). good luck.|`|mL0BjDQWaa	well depends on the hamster and how good you are with hamsters can take from like an hour to 2 weeks. any longer is just being lazy and not trying to tame it lol<br>  hope this helps|`|c96L56jJaa	about a week or two|`|5UQiaSq1aa	I had the same situation with my black bear Syrian hamster, and I got her 5 days ago. On average it takes around one-two days. You are one of the lucky ones, with your hamster being fine already. Some hamsters, including mine, are like that, and aren't afraid of people.
2Ku4DuvCaa	If you bully him, things will only get worse. It's hard to undo any damage you do to the bonding process because these little guys have surprisingly good memories. They don't forget things, and they have a hard time forgiving, too.<br>  <br>  Tell him to stop holding the bird by force, as that's only going to indicate to the cockatiel that hands are not to be trusted. <br>  <br>  What you need to do is slow down and calm down. Offer him treats, talk to him softly and sweetly. Smile at him when you do! He may not understand your words, but he will understand your tone and your expression! <br>  <br>  He will warm up to you when he's ready to. Bullying him will only make him dislike you. There's lots of good information out there on cockatiels, do yourself a favor and do your research!|`|K5IOSGXAaa	OMG do NOT bully the poor little thing, take your time and be gentle or the bird can die from fright.

You have to be patient and not hurry the bird. Let it do thing in it own time. And if you man can't do that find the bird a home that will.|`|RUIceUBbaa	First things first, you have to let the tiel get used to you!  I have had my new male about 3 months and he still will not allow fingers near him!  You have to let them come to you!  As far as pressuring the bird, this could lead to mental harm in the future to the bird, making him associate hands with panic and confusion.  He is making alarming sounds because as babies they make these sounds to attract their parents in hopes of the parent coming to defend them, it is a defense mechanism they use.  BY NO MEANS DO YOU BULLY A BIRD INTO LIKING YOU...mental abuse can lead to a VERY aggressive and socially handicapp cockatiel.<br>  Give him time to get used to you!  Eventually he will see that the "evil hands of doom" are there as friends and not foes.

Under 4" they carry a disease called 'salmonella'. So you must wash after every handling ANY size turtle.<br>  <br>   ***And my pictures don't lie. All ages and all sizes get along as long as their is allot for swim room and plenty to eat! They can become cannibalistic if you have 2 or more turtles and a small environment. They will kill off the smallest and then fight for the tank for themselves.<br>  <br>  You need a heater...set at 80 degrees. If water is cold they will stop eating! <br>  Sliders, westerns, cooters , midland, painted, map, yellow bellied all are basically the same and require the same basic care. <br>  They NEED calcium and protein they get it from the fish meat and the fish bones.

Oh, the UVA bulb will not do anything for turtles- they want UVB.|`|vS1Z0inOaa	It depends on what kind of turtle you get. Turtles like red-eared and yelow-bellied sliders, diamondback terrapins, cooters, musk and map turtles generally do well with water that is 70 to 77 degrees and a basking area that is 90 degrees. 70 to 77 degrees is room temperature during the day for mos people, and as long as it doesn't drop below 65 at night you should be fine. Alligator snappers appreciate their water quite cool--around 68 degrees or a little cooler. Turtles like the reeve turtle, snail eaters, chicken turtle, malayan box turtle, and a few other tropical species need their water to be 80 to 85 degrees and the basking area at 95, so turtles like these likely wo't do well with your cool water fish. Another thing to keep in mind: turtles LOVE to eat live fish! So are yu sure you want to put one in with them?|`|jDPULfjKaa	no. turtles are a warm water species and would never be able to survive in cold water, room temp is much to cold for them to tolerate. The temperature they need is 75-82F. And besides a 26 gallon is much too small to house ANY turtle, let alone most turtles are omnivorous and will take bites out of large fish. So definitely not.

1zbMEJIzaa	Hello.<br>  Most of small bird ( finches , canaries , parakeets, lovebirds , cockateils )  can be mature when they are 9 _ 12 months old . But usually the experts advice to breed them ONLY when they are about one year old or a little older , to ensure their health ( they may have eggs when they are 4 _ 9 months, but mostly the eggs are infertile ) and to make sure the female does not have egg bound problem (  females can be killed when have this problem ) <br>  The medium birds ( quakers , conures , other parrots ) can be mature to have fertile eggs when they are about 3_ 5 years old . Hope this help . TM.|`|IxuMTGd4aa	Well, for one, you should EVEN be breeding them at four months! If you are going to do that, give them to a home who can properly care AND love them! That is way too young for them to breed.<br>  <br>  They are mature at six months, but you shouldn't breed until they are a year old. No younger, or you could encounter SERIOUS medical and health problems, with both the babies and parents.|`|KWsVJAuoaa	are you serious! come on you cant breed any bird at such a young age M.R.R is right and who gave the thumbs down she is right!

Amkmles0aa	time just need time|`|9iNCQkWlaa	Eventually the dog will get the message that cats have very sharp claws and that cats love to sink them into dog's noses...this alone should settle the issue for the dog.|`|O0lb4Kcnaa	How do you know that they aren't accepting each other and it's their way of playing? <br>  <br>  When my daughter was given a kitten I had a 7 year old chow mix.  At first the chow and kitten weren't getting along.  But then the chow slowly accepted the kitten, which actually became HIS kitten until he recently passed away in Nov. at 12 yrs old.  He'd chase her all over the house, she'd swipe him and try to hang on him. <br>  <br>  Two and half years ago we introduced the house to a German Shepherd puppy, 8 weeks old. The now grown cat hated it!  She'd squeal, hiss and smack and etc.  **the chow also didn't like the GS. The cat would take off and hide.<br>  <br>  In November we introduced the house to a cockapoo.  Cat wasn't sure of him, German shepherd wanted to eat him.  The Chow, now being old and sick thought that the pup was his.  After a few days the cat played for only a couple of minutes with the new pup, ignored the chow and still hated the GS. But the puppy would go up and chase the cat, the cat would smack him on the head a few times and then jump up so that the puppy couldn't get to her. <br>  <br>  Almost 4 months later, the chow is gone, the cat preys on the cockapoo to get him going, lets the GS at least sniff her and watches the 2 dogs play. <br>  <br>  Eventually your cat will accept and get along with your dog.  They could be getting along now, is the cats tail swaying while she's swipping?|`|wA7kqXfRaa	Go slow. Animals need time to get to know each other. They are much more likely to fight or be unhappy if you try to force them together suddenly. <br>  Praise your dog for friendly behavior around your cat. If you have a dog that barks whenever the cat comes in, make it so that when the cat comes in it's enjoyable. Say, "Oh, look, Puppy, Kitty's here! Yayyyy!" and sound very happy and give the dog a small training treat. Your dog will soon learn to associate pleasant feelings with the cat. <br>  Provide your cat a place where she can get out of reach of your dog. Cat's will generally attack a dog only when backed into a corner with no way to avoid the dog. <br>  Hold your cat in your arms until she is calm and relaxed. Then ask a family member or friend to slowly bring your dog into the room. Gradually bring the dog closer in small steps, waiting for your cat and dog to both settle down as each step of the way before getting closer. <br>  <br>  <br>  Tips: Try not to play favorites. Sometimes these fights are triggered by jealousy. If the dog notices that the cat is getting more attention, it'll respond negatively. <br>  <br>  Warnings: Until your pets are relatively well socialized together, don't leave them home alone together. You don't want to risk one or the other being hurt when you're not home. It's easy and much safer just to close your cat or dog into a room by itself while you're gone.|`|KsLm8qg3aa	It may not ever happen.  Usually one just learns to avoid the other.  I would definitely punish the dog for chasing the cat, that's a big no no for me.  It's natural for the cat to be viewed as the prey so it is very tricky to make sure your cat doesn't get hurt.  I would watch some cesar milan or ask a trainer for help, it IS possible for them to live together.|`|rTaaIXSuaa	I really didn't do anything.<br>  Believe me, that cat will lay down the law. When I got my cat, my dog would constantly torture my cat until one day my cat had enough and lost it. He gave my dog a real smack down where it actually made my dog whine. <br>  Needless to say, they are best of buddies and my dog since then never bugged him again.|`|R93qp2Zxaa	Well...it's too late to properly "introduce" them, so they may have started on the wrong foot.<br>  <br>  The first thing you need to do is train the dog that it's bad to chase the cat, and good to sit still when the cat goes by.  Positive reinforcement, treats, and possibly the use of a leash even in the house during the training process may be required.<br>  <br>  Make sure the cat has a "dog free zone".  A high cat post, a room with a too-small cat door (maybe with the litter in it -- your dog doesn't try to eat the kitties presents, does he?  Don't ask why I ask that) are all possibilities here.<br>  <br>  Also feed the cat where the dog can't get it.  Preferably somewhere higher in the house (landing, shelf, counter or table).  The cat usually can fend for itself in the end (declawed?  Maybe not then) but it needs to feel like it doesn't have to if they're going to be friends.  And the cat really needs to be the main supporter of the "friendship" -- the nicest dog in the world won't be able to befriend a cat that hisses when it walks into the room.|`|YfXQxJdyaa	I don't have an answer for you, but I'm in the same situation.

Nh3ZDjwhaa	Well, I dont think your ready for any type of horse right now if you could get rid of your mini so easily. A horse or any type of animal is a life time commitment. You cant just go and sell your horse b/c you think you see something better. Your mini isnt an old toy that you can toss in the trash. Its a living thing thats your responsibility. If you werent devoted in the mini then I dont think you should have gotten him, but... I think you should keep the mini and if you really want to ride, take lessons and ride the lesson horses.|`|iiNAJfGCaa	Huh? Horses can't be traded in/sold on a whim.

itiJVgRsaa	the same thing happened to my dog about a month ago. people are going to be mean to you and say take to a vet. but a dogs natural defense to foreign things is to dispell from the body, hence diarhhea. the diarhea can get so bad that it causes blood from straining to poop. it's not serious. just make sure he stays hydrated because he can become dehydrated quickly from the diarhea. i can't spell. lol. anyway, also give him 1/2 teaspoon of Kaopecte for every 10lbs of weight 2 times a day. don't give him any food for 24 hours so he can heal. when you start to feed again do it slowly. try boiled chicken and white rice as a blander diet at first before putting back on reg. dog chow. remember......slowly ok. so as not to cause diarhea again. it will pass. I did this and my dog healed fine. she is a lhasa apso/ chihuahua mix and she has a tiny tummy. good luck.|`|eDySIDPQaa	Hi Erin.<br>  .<br>  If a bad case of worms, can cause blood in the stool<br>  It could be Parvo<br>  It could be the dog got hold of something and ate it and is causing internal bleeding and will cause blood in poop,but would also cause blood to come from mouth and nose if internal bleeding.<br>  <br>  is the dog eating and drinking okay, or is it just kinda laying around and does not want to move........pls call a vet <br>  <br>  Hon, you need to call a 24/7 vet, if Parvo, you do not want to wait, it needs to see a vet now....And yes dogs do eliminate to get rid of diseases in their system, but not with blood, that is not normal by any means.....<br>  <br>  but, a vet is the only one that can tell you what it is....<br>  <br>  and no one on here is being mean by saying take your dog to the vet.....no one on here is a vet, and all we can do is give you our best guesses and opinions, I would not risk my dogs life on an opinion.....<br>  <br>  We are helping, no one is being mean or rude to you....so don' t think that for one minute..<br>  <br>  What someone says happened to their dog in the past, does not mean this is what is wrong with your dog.....and it is not normal of animals to pass blood to wart natural defenses...<br>  <br>  blood is an indication of a problem...plain and simple|`|Nhje1U06aa	Did eat something - plastic toy tooth  brush etc... have you changed his food or treats recently?   <br>  <br>  I know it sounds gross but is it dried blood fresh blood A lot of it or a little? My dog has hemorrhoids he gets a little blood when he has  an upset stomach and keeps pooing..<br>  <br>  call your vet make sure he doesn't get dehydrated  take a poo sample with you !<br>  <br>  you can also give him imodium just a teaspoon every 8 hr it helps!!|`|hdlzF6f2aa	If your dog is lethargic it can be many of things.<br>  If it is a puppy under the age of two without it's shots it might have parvo.<br>  If the dog is older I would take it to the vet for cautious reasons.|`|IEsudy2xaa	i think you should take him to the vets no use guessing anything with blood is not good i do hope everthing will be ok and the vet will know what is wrong and it wont be to serious all the best|`|WYItM0YTaa	he could have a parasite. take him to the vet|`|3p6wp7DYaa	First of all, telling you to take the dog to a vet is not a "mean" answer. Your vet, although expensive, is the best choice when your dog has a health issue. <br>  <br>  That said, it could be lots of things. If this is a vaccinated young dog, probably nothing too serious, but still needs to be taken care of. The most common causes of bloody diarrhea are parasites. Worms and other parasites will not just going to disappear without intervention. Your vet will prescribe you a mild anti-inflammatory for the irritation causing bloody stools and some other drug to kill the parasite.<br>  <br>  Another cause could be related to diet. If the dog has recently eaten something different such as a new type of kibble, garbage, or even something considered inedible. This type of diarrhea usually lasts only a while, and you may consider waiting before going to the vet if you know for sure that your dog ate something off and that is the most likely cause of the diarrhea.|`|pc7ZjexJaa	this happend when Meri got a wooden gate. it was really really bad<br>  <br>  ask your dad if he can take Jarrett to the vet tomorrow<br>  <br>  let me know whats going on....we need to have a playdate some time.<br>  <br>  I've been shadowing an obedience instructor! its sooo fun....<br>  <br>  I can't wait for Alaska!!<br>  are you taking Jarrett to the kennel in shannon? I guess I could just text you to ask I guess
B6zl0AJDaa	First of all are they up on their worming?  Have you rotated their wormers, because if you haven't, some worms build up an ammunity to the wormers and that's why you have to rotate them.<br>  <br>  I'm in California and if I have a horse who's starting to look a bit "ribby" or I've purchased some rack of bones,  I go out and buy a 50LB sack of A&M (Ground alfafa and molasses) (In the mid west they use beet pulp BUT I've been informed that you HAVE to add water to it or it will swell in a horse's belly causing colic), dump it into a tub or feeder in the horse's stall, then top it with some rolled barley corn that is mixed with corn oil and apple cider vinegar. (I feed a 3LB coffee can of the barley corn mixture once a day.) The horse will normally devour the first couple of bags of A&M, but then they will slack off as they get used to it (Never had an issue with colic or founder)...<br>  <br>  I haven't fed oats or any mixed feed in decades, basically because I've had running horses and TBs I'm trying to keep quiet, so I feed the rolled barley corn mixture to them for weight, NOT heat.<br>  <br>  I also give my horses a hot bran mash twice a week with a 1/2 CUP of apple cider vinegar and corn oil (I can mix the barleycorn into it.).  I feed 1/2 a 3 LB coffee can of red wheat flakey bran and add enough water to it so that it looks like oatmeal in consistancy.<br>  <br>  I make sure that they get 2 flakes of alfafa hay per feeding.|`|iiNAJfGCaa	If you have noticed a significant weight loss over the past few months it is probably due to:<br>  <br>  A) worms <br>  B) teeth/health problems <br>  C) not enough quality roughage (hay).  <br>  <br>  High quality hay is more important than any grain. I doubt switching from equine senior to vintage senior made a difference -- I am not a big fan of commercial feeds to begin with. Too much sugar and added vitamins/minerals. I feed all of my horses (even my extremely hard keeper OTTB) oats which are, contrary to popular belief, the lowest energy feed of all the cereal grains. They are inexpensive, digestible, high in protein, and much healthier for the horse than commercialized feeds. <br>  <br>  Get the vet out to check your horse's teeth. You can also have a fecal done for worms. Increase your horse's hay. I like round bales, but make sure it is high quality hay (not cow hay) and it is protected from the elements. You can also supplement your horse's grain with rice bran (1 cup AM/PM) which will give them extra calories and is good for their coat.|`|Ky3rQ3fYaa	There are a great combo of answers here.  I would def start with the teeth and rotation of wormer.  Did you switch to a new feed gradually?<br>  <br>  Is she spitting out alot of her hay or just chewing it for what seems like forever?<br>  <br>  We have a 30 yo ap female and have always had a hard time keeping weight on her.  We get our feed from our local Agway here in NY and feed her a senior feed, about 2 quarts and almost double that of hay extender after putting 2-4 gallons to it.  We have not had weight issues since trying this at the advice of our vet in like 5 years and now she is actually kind of overweight.  <br>  <br>  Before making any huge changes tho, I would def start with the worming and teeth.|`|UIUMrurEaa	Just today, I had the vet come out and examine my horse.  She has lost a tremendous amount of weight over the last couple of months.  First and foremost, he said her teeth were a big problem.  After he floated her teeth, he suggested feeding her Strategy or Equine Senior for older horses.  I also purchased a supplement called Weight Builder 4000.  But the vet said if I hadn't already purchased the supplement, I could have used 1/2 cup of CORN oil on her feed for the same results.  So I would suggest that if you are up to date on her worming schedule, you should have her teeth floated.|`|Nh3ZDjwhaa	Some OTTBs at my stable are also like that. Its hard to put weight on them. I would feed them a scoop of grain 3x a day. And give him more hay than usual. Also buy some molasses treats at your tack store, give them carrots and apples. Just maybe let them rest and feed them more. The senior feed also helps put on weight. Try a different kind.|`|7p8spyFHaa	We feed our senior horses Beet Pulp Shreds that have been soaked in warm water for 30 minutes.You can mix in the senior feed right as you feed it.  It's good for their body condition and they love it! You can buy it at your local feed store and it's inexpensive!!|`|QcV28KsSaa	give them a 1/2 cup veg. oil daily with feed
TM2uTrfXaa	simply put companionship! did the new cat have litter mates still? It sounds that way.... it could be just new buds and may settle down some soon. glad they like each other so well and everyone is happy!|`|ad9efc98eb0fbeeae6b6c4abfd63046caa	i am happy for you and you are so lucky i would love a cat are ragdolls easy to keep grooming wise i would love to know as they look so cute|`|XCHoHCrnaa	Awww its cause they are best buds lol.<br>  <br>  I have 2 cats and they sleep together, eat together and play together.

Eg1G2mvVaa	Try letting your wife take over all of the feeding and walking of the puppy.  Once she becomes the primary provider for the dog it's attitude may well change.|`|hdlzF6f2aa	You're dog is jealous of the wife, she feels as if she should be the only thing you love. I honestly do not know how to fix the problem, but looking up dog jealousy on Google should.|`|q9v13GoIaa	the dog is jealous of you wife|`|VsSI1Rc9aa	she might just be jealous but mabey when you're gone you're wife might not treat her right???<br>  u never kno?|`|MYEEK4dcaa	Your wife may treat the dog the same way you do, but the dog senses that she does not have the calm, confident energy you have.  She sees your wife as lower in the canine ranking system than she is, and she is exercising her "authority" over your wife.  All the training in the world won't help if your wife isn't calm and confident - assertive, even, but never aggressive toward the dog.<br>  <br>  It might help to have your wife read "Be The Pack Leader" by Cesar Millan and Melissa Jo Pelletier.  This book talks about the energy a person needs in order to be the leader the dog really needs.<br>  <br>  When your dog mistreats your wife, correct her immediately.  Be stern but not mean to her, and make sure she understands that any mistreatment of your wife brings about your immediate and unqualified disapproval.  Don't correct her if you don't see the misdeed, however, because dogs don't understand what they did when it comes to connecting the behavior with the correction.<br>  <br>  Good luck!<br>  <br>  Apacapacas|`|SIY379V5aa	Your dog feels threatened by your wife. She feels as if she has to show her dominance to your wife and for you. I like the idea of letting your wife be her primary care giver cause that may work. You can also read a little bit about obedience and let your wife teach her new tricks and your basics sit stay lay roll jump fetch etc etc etc. This may help show your pup that your wife is dominant. Once the pup learns your wife is the "master" so to speak it will calm down... <br>  <br>  Ex. I just got remarried. I have one male and one female dog. My male listens to me and my female will listen to my hubby (even tho my female is three and I have had her since she was 6 weeks old and she has only known my hubby for a year.) She still listens to him an not me. She will sit and lay beside him and when it comes to me she will sit ON me to show she is dominant over me. Your wife just has to take control to show her who is boss! Its just a dominance thing... Male over female and then the strongest female is next. Dont let your pup be next.|`|fFvXahMUaa	Your wife should spend some time alone with your puppy, trying to get to know her better. This should work if if your wife give lots of attention<br>  to the puppy.<br>  <br>  Hope this advise is useful :)

GaSK15Kpaa	Hi<br>  All hamsters poo quite a bit but their poo is these tiny pellets around the size of a grain of rice. maybe smaller.<br>  To play you can get a ball, or let them on your bed or get a pen or just put lots of toys in a empty bath with a towel down and let them run around for a while.<br>  They like to eat hamster food from pet shops and also like carrots, apple, cheese, tomato, lettuce, a 1cm square of ham or other cooked meat.<br>  They will decide where they want to sleep in their cage aslong as you put in some of the paper strips bedding they will move it to where they want it.<br>  My hammy likes to go on my shoulder. Make sure the cage isint in direct sunlight as they can get heatstroke.<br>  I would recommend a wire cage - i have the hamster heaven metro it is amazing! I have had a rotastak and an aquarium and i hated them both.<br>  You can either look into a breeder near you or just go to the local pet shop they range from ￡6 - ￡12. <br>  Just feed them a heaped teaspoonful of hamster food a day and clean their cage once a week. Try and handle your hammy every day, and let them out for a run in a ball.Also feed them a 1cm square of cooked meat once a week as they are omnivores and need some meat in their diet not alot though. This also helps them not to bite you as it settles their carnivorous cravings :D<br>  <br>  Hope this helps<br>  Luci|`|g6ENt03Oaa	robo hamsters do have fur that might be your main concern.<br>  They poop but all animals do and they are tiny. Userally they will hold it on you but not always. <br>  They eat hamster food brought from a pet shop. You can get a starter kit from a pet shop for about ￡20-￡30 depending on what size of cage you get (the bigger the better for the pet). They userally cost about ￡7.50 but can be a bit more or less. If you look in the right places you can get them for free. They will need an excersise wheel and lots of the middle of toilet rolls or small boxes that fit in their cage. I'd definatly surgest a cage like rotastak or habitrail or crittertrail which you can expend on for them as you have the money. The babys may be that small but robo hamsters can get to be 4 1/2 inches when fully grown. I would put the cage anywhere out of dirrect sunlight (don't want to get them dehidrated) and in a quite room as most hamsters like to sleep in the day or at least for part of it. There are lots of toys you can buy my gerbils (which like the same type of thing) have a round thing that moves when they step in it that they love.<br>  You will need wood chews or their teeth can get too long and kill them. You need a mineral lick for them and a water bottle. Also sawdust or litter and cotton wool or shredded bedding. They need a box like area to sleep in.<br>  Hope that helps.|`|cNluUqKfaa	You can't really play with them.... they are really small and really fast. They can be very controlling around other hamsters so putting them together is impossible.  Other than that however, they are just like other hamsters.|`|DMt0posYaa	It's very hard to play with dawrf hamsters since their so small, you can just hold them and watch them go around in their ball. You take care of them by giving them sand baths,feeding them,cleaning their cage daily, and make sure you pay a lot of attention to it.  They like to eat nuts,seeds, etc, once in a while you can give them vegetables , but make sure you don't give them too much vegetables or else they will get sick and start having green crap. They like to sleep in dark places, Don't place your cage near the light, they dont like it. <br>  <br>  They are very cheap, they cost 5-10 dollars. You can get them at petsmart, petland, any pet store. But think hard about getting one they are a lotta work to take care of i have a hamster. They are very boring in my opinion.

R93qp2Zxaa	Tough, especially with an older cat.<br>  <br>  Time.<br>  <br>  A certain amount of forced nearness...you say it always stays outside.  That's just giving it a way to avoid getting used to the dog.<br>  <br>  Using yourself as a buffer (petting both at once -- so it needs to be near the dog to be near you).<br>  <br>  Puppy training.  Chances are he will be bigger than the cat, if he isn't already.  He needs to understand his size and what kind of playing is too rough for the cat, or the interaction won't be a positive one and the cat will just dislike it more.<br>  <br>  Honestly, a lot of older cats don't even like younger cats, much less younger dogs.  Chances are they'll never be "best buds" and you shouldn't entirely expect or force it.  If the cat seems happy with the situation and they can at least co-habitate...let the res go I'd say.|`|XhirXRkpaa	You can't force them to like each other, but I did read somewhere that when you get a dog after you've had a cat, you should feed the cat above the dog.  In other words, if you have an upstairs or a landing, feed the cat at the top of the stairs.  This helps both animals understand their hierarchy/pecking order in the household.|`|Im44orotaa	getting along with the dog is up to the cat... but i did some things in my home to make the introduction of my puppy to my 11 year old cat go more smoothly and they have seemed to work.<br>  i created a dog free zone so my cat would feel safe there.<br>  got a cat tower so he could observe the puppy and feel safe.<br>  and made sure to give him lots of love and attention so he didn't feel abandoned.<br>  <br>  the first month was rough but now they both sleep on my bed with each other.<br>  <br>  Good luck.|`|wIHlVT2Paa	you can't exactly FORCE them|`|D1fC7f48aa	My older cat was fine until we got another cat.  I figured because both cats came from the same mother (we aren't sure if they are from the same father, we think so but different litter) they would get along fine.  They didn't and ended up fighting all the time.  It took months before they got along.  <br>  <br>  Then we got a feisty wiener dog.  The older cat to this day absolutely hates the dog.  I've tried everything to get them to get along.  I put them both in a small room and actually I think it made it worst.<br>  <br>  Most of the time the wiener dog just wants to hump the cat.  I'm still trying to figure out how to make that stop.  The second cat gave up and just lets the dog do his thing and then go away.<br>  <br>  I wouldn't think it is likely gonna happen.  Especially if the cat didn't grow up with the dog.  Good luck though.

3sB49YNnaa	Lighten up Chewy.  The way you learn is by asking.  An asker has the right to not be abused by someone answering!  Also, do some math.  12x16 is 192 square feet.  Divide that by 4 square feet per rabbit and you get 48 rabbits!  Even if you mean a space 4'x4' (16 square feet) you still get 12 rabbits in the proposed run!<br>  <br>  Are the rabbits you will be housing in this run all neutered?  If not, you will need to consider separate housing.  Unbonded, unneutered rabbits of the same sex will usually fight and unneutered rabbits of opposite sexes will mate.<br>  <br>  Personally, I think you are better off with individual housing and exercise time in your run in groups that you know get along and which won't mate|`|3zwDWO3faa	cool!!!!! i want 7 rabbits...<br>  but i already have too many critters. yes, it would be fine.|`|wEiHz1Llaa	Oh k- you are NOT sure on how many rabbits you have ?? what kind are they ?

Of course bigger tanks usually have more fish, so they need more filtering.<br>  <br>  If you stuck just a betta in a 20gal with that tiny filter, it would still be perfectly happy. But most people put 10 or 20 fish into that size tank, so they need the bigger filter.<br>  <br>  Ian|`|pcvcMePXaa	you could just i wouldn't recomend it though not enough filtration, and your tank would become dirty much faster so i suggest you get a bigger filter maybe an AquaClear Mini or an AquaClear20 would be good|`|dE5fs9yzaa	Sorry..not powerful enough to handle a 5. Thats why they rate them so you know which filter to use.

It's part of training them to clean themselves better as far as I can tell, though it may be a dominance play as well.  Anyway, it is normal, it isn't necessarily related to gender, spaying or lack there of (though it is about time to spay her) and it isn't really something you need to intervene on, even though it may seem unpleasant or harmful to you.|`|KsLm8qg3aa	My cat will tackle anything just to lick it.  Feet, dogs, cats, you name it.  I'm not sure what it is, I don't think he's hurting her, she's just frustrated that she can't get away.

He may just be overly affectionate.|`|wIHlVT2Paa	because he is a vampire! and, he likes grapes|`|uaxliXB3aa	I think it's because the female is a kitten, so maybe the male is feeling like a parent and is trying to act like a dad to the kitten.

TdrgZwnoaa	If the cat has scratched and bitten family members then it is now a threat instead of a nuisance. Neighbours be damned; call the animal control people and a the Health authorities and have them remove the cat. That is your right as a property owner. You are under no obligation tp consult with the owners of this animal.|`|uaxliXB3aa	You could try to tell the owner of the cat that it keeps going in your backyard. Maybe they'll put up a fence or keep it indoors. If that doesn't work, you could try telling them that if their cat does keep going into your backyard, you would get some cat traps and set them. They won't hurt the cat, just trap it inside. Then you can safely carry it over to the owners house. If you have to resort to that and it still doesn't work, then you could try calling animal control to see what they have to say about it.
LAXxaxAZaa	You have to desensitize him.<br>  <br>  Step 1: Bring the hose as close as you can without him throwing a fit. <br>  Step 2: Keep it there for a while.<br>  Step 3: Move it closer, until he gets a little nervous.<br>  Step 4: Keep it there until he calms down. If he doesn't calm down, move it back a little and start again.<br>  <br>  Repeat steps 3 and 4 until you can have the hose as close to him as you need it.|`|23fe729840a0e15dbc1476704bdf1dfeaa	I had the same problem with my little arab.<br>  I did pretty much what Mandy R is saying. I would take her in to the washing yard, make her stand quietly and bring the hose out. As soon as she got nervous I took it away. When she was calm I reintroduced it but took it away if she started to get nervous. Eventually she would let me rub it all over without flinching so I turned it on while standing next to her and she was OK with that so I started hosing her down with the hose on a low pressure. She watched me at first but then she got the message that it wasn't going to eat her so she was OK.<br>  <br>  I also made sure that I fed her and groomed her in the wash area so she didn't associate being in there with being washed down.<br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|u4F1OiE4aa	Definitely don't tie the horse up when bathing for the first time because they could flip over backwards when they realize they are tied up. Make sure you have a good lead and hold onto the horse starting with small water pressure applying it to the legs. Move slowly upward and don't make any sudden abrupt changes.a lot of times the scariest part is the sound of the water. they may circle around you but once they are used to it they will stand calmly for it. You will have to repeat a few times before the horse is actually content having it done. good luck|`|ff42beaeb7a8ee5d3b32dd2655c08c36aa	start by using a sponge with water, at the shoulder then work down.  once he is okay with sponging you can graduate to hosing. do not tie him up, as he will tear your barn down if he freaks out.<br>  tieing for baths should only be done with a quick release knot, after the horse is well broke to baths.<br>  place the horse next to a wall, and start at the shoulder with the hose.  he will only have 2 direction to go...either forward or backward.<br>  warm water would be helpful.  many hate ice cold water.|`|Nh3ZDjwhaa	Instead of using a hose, use a big sponge and wash him that way. Put some water and horse shampoo in a buck and then soak the sponge in water and squeeze it out over the legs. I used to do that with a pony I used to lease all the time. Good Luck!|`|zrwqYItJaa	What i tend to do when i hose down my horse is, make sure he is tied up on a short rope and give him a small amount of hay in a hay net, this usually makes him stand still! Hope this helps x|`|3PamELMvaa	I have the same problem with my horse, who seems to hate being hosed. You might have to cross tie him  first until he gets used to it. Start with a gentle stream onto his hooves and then working up his legs. You could keep one hand on his neck, just petting him and talk in a reassuring voice, which is what I do. I just say "bath time, bath time, bath time" over and over again until he settles.|`|KuBDXQTlaa	My horse used to never like the hose either. What I did is I filled a small bucket up with water, and used a cup to pour it on him. He got used to it after doing the same thing for a short period of time. The I started using just the smaller bucket. Once he got used to that, I got a hose attachment that acted as a sprinkler. Now since I got him used to the hose, I have no problem giving him a bath. Hope this helps! Good luck!|`|GksOStrsaa	Start slow. First let him get used to the noise. Then when he stands for that, spray it on his hooves-just a trickle. Then increase the flow, then move to the legs... Gradually, you get it. In the meantime, use a wet towel.|`|BwWFJzD3aa	Try using a hobble on him. Start slow on the legs, then work your way up, and just let the water flow without noises. If you can't use a hobble, you'll just have to tie him up.|`|AA10514087	i think hippiechick says it best and mandy but just make sure not to make it such an unpleasant experience as that will def backfire on you
G0KKfXMUaa	So just a trail horse?<br>  <br>  Well, I consider my trail horses fully trained when-<br>  <br>  1. They give no resistance to leg.<br>  2. Will walk, trot, canter, and gallop with no problem or uneasiness.<br>  3. They can turn swiftly and without pushing their body to the outside or not following their head.<br>  4. They'll halt and back up with no resistance to slight rein pulling.<br>  5. They're used to everyday noises and normally don't spook (paper bags, rustling trees, etc.)<br>  6. They crosstie, halter, bridle, and saddle well.<br>  7. And they have no problem following or leading other horses on trails.<br>  <br>  Those are the basics as far as my standards go.

Other trainers do different methods but the majority that I have known use this rough model.|`|3BMBZtDxaa	I think they're not green anymore when you can throw a rider on them and not worry about them being thrown off or have the horse not understand what he's doing.<br>  <br>  As for a pleasure horse, I would say when they are trained in basics (i.e. back up, go, left, right, stop) and they are reliable to a degree. Like, they may still be spooky, but at least you know that someone can get on them without being severly injured. <br>  <br>  So basically when someone can ride them without a problem and they are considered a "safe" horse. The reason why I put the quotations around the safe is because all horses can be dangerous and everyone can be spooky and rear, but for it to not be green it should be to where you're not thinking about it bucking someone off.<br>  <br>  But then again, that's just my opinion!

If you do have a male, it'd be a surprise if all three females weren't pregnant, they're pretty vigorous!|`|qDQ5uLrSaa	Hi, <br>  There are many ways to sex a Platy (these sexing methods, by the way, can be applied to all livebearers), but there are two that are more widely used than others. The first method is to observe the shape of the Platy, Females will be longer, and also have wider stomachs (even when not pregnant) than males. The second method (and most accurate) involves observing the three fins on the underbelly of the fish. Female Platy's will have three almost identical fins, two a little further up the belly (closer to the front) than the rear, and with a male, the two frontal fins will be the same, but the aft fin will be much smaller, and pointed.|`|HXuQwpaNaa	The female's back fin under where her anus would be (behind the two pectoral fins) will have a fin that is fanned out...The male's fin in that spot is tucked back and you will usually see the gonopodium (penis-like organ) which is just a long straight thing that points backwards. A female with her fin tucked up can look very like a male, but when she relaxes and hovers in the water she will almost always let her fin fan out. It is difficult to sex livebreeders while they are swimming. <br>  <br>  The male sexual organs are also some of the last characteristics to develop, so juveniles suddenly switching from female to male is normal. It's not wise to buy platies or other livebreeders based on sex until they are fully grown.|`|sKs7wM2Saa	see if it has a penis or not. lol :)|`|rKuDDohDaa	females are generally rounder and fatter than the males , which are somewhat skinny|`|BGPG2FaFaa	u might want to look under it

Put yourself in as non threatening an environment as possible perhaps Stand outside of the horse's stall, move on to petting and stroking him and see if you get over some of your anxiety. Than just proceed from there as you feel comfortable.|`|5eu5P1hYaa	First, I must say, yes, it does hurt to be bitten by one, but it's normally our fault.  Why people get scared of horses when it's their fault it happened is a mystery to me.<br>  <br>  But anyway, about your problem, first of all, learn what will make a horse do things, and learn safety rules.<br>  <br>  1st of all, about the kicking. Don't walk behind it, and actually, the closer you stand to a horse, the less likely you can be kicked by it.  Just watch your feet, they don't mean to, at least most of them don't (some like to play games) and they might step on your foot.  It doesn't hurt much if your wearing proper shoes, (my horse is one who LOVES to play games).<br>  <br>  And about the biting.  At first, you don't have to give them any treats if you don't want to, but as soon as your comfortable, you can try.  But remember, keep your hand flat.  They can't see your hand, they can only feel it with their whiskers. they could mistake a finger for a carrot if you don't keep your hand flat and fingers together.<br>  <br>  You should try going to a near by stable that has beginner horses that are trained to be very good with people who haven't been around horses.  Also, try no to be nervous, some horses pick up on people's emotions and could get a little nervous themselves, but most beginner   horses don't do that.<br>  <br>  EDIT: those first three people are idiots, they shouldn't even be answering horse related questions.  They're probably all too scared of horses (for no reason!!!) to give them a second chance.|`|mUNJEh8baa	Ok, first of all, the three people at the top are stupid and have obviously never really loved horses or even been around them. Second of all, to get over your fear, try going to a local stable and ask the instructor if they can take one of the calm horses out of its stall/pasture and tie it up for you. Just go over to it, pet it, talk to it, and don't worry about your fear. Unless the horse is really nasty, its not going to bite you. If you don't stand behind the horse, its impossible for it to kick you. They dont kick to the side, their legs dont go that way =) Once you've been around horses for a long time you wont be scared of them anymore. Good luck!|`|yQFdBj3haa	The only way you can get over your fear is by doing it ie. standing next to a horse. Not all horses bite and not all horses kick and the only reason horses do bite and kick is because they haven't been trained properly or they haven't been trained at all. A horse will only bite or kick you if it has a reason to bite or kick you. You do get some horses that generally have got bad manners and a bad temperament but mainly they're only bad tempered because they've had bad experiences with people or they've not been trained properly. <br>  <br>  Well with horses you have to be confident and you have to just show them you aren't afraid and that you're the boss. I've had my gelding from being 10 months old and he's never kicked me once, he's never even tried. The best thing you can do is just walk up to a horse, let it sniff your hand and try stroking or petting it. Once you've done it once you'll find it easy to do and you'll wonder why you were afraid in the first place, trust me!|`|h3LXI1Wvaa	horses are said to be able to sense a human's feelings, and if you're scared of it, it'll probably know, and that will make the horse nervous. i was trampled, but yet i'm still a horse lover. as long as you know the horse is safe, than you should be fine. bring someone with you when you approach a horse if it seems to make you feel safer.<br>  <br>  horses are great animals (:|`|ymUragNfaa	The first thing that you must understand is that horses are like kindergarten kids and can have 4 different personalities or a combination of more than one. They have no power of reasoning. They also have a peck order. You have to be the head of the peck order to be respected. This doesn't mean that you have to be mean, you just have to be smarter then the horse. You must be the adult in the scenario. If you really want to be a horse person, then find a instructor in your area and take some lessons. They will teach you how to use pressure and release to gain respect of the horse.The horse is only looking for a person that is going to take care of them just like the stallion in the wild herd.|`|8xTKwln2aa	I have been kicked and bitten before. I love horses so much that it doesn't bother me. Even though if they are trained, they are still animals. What i would do if I was scared of horses is just keep going around them. If you get hurt again, which you might, try to get over it. I am sorry that that happened to you but if you keep going around them you might get over your fear.|`|penuzN8jaa	dont worry!! Stressing about this sort of thing will only make matters worse!! I used to be like you, but then I met a lovely pony who I am looking after at the moment and I have realised that she wouldn't try and hurt me for no reason!! Horses only try to hurt people when you are hurting or worrying them.<br>  So, be confident and gentle with horses and if you are grooming around the bum area and are afraid, just talk to the horse and tell him/her what you are doing. He/she will be comforted by your voice and will realise that you don't mean any harm.<br>  Just make friends with a quiet horse at first and overcome your fear.<br>  You will soon realise that horses are very very friendly animals and rarely try to hurt us humans!<br>  Good luck,<br>  Chrissie<br>  xxxx|`|ff42beaeb7a8ee5d3b32dd2655c08c36aa	you could try desensitization, if it is really important to you.<br>  try having someone have a horse in halter and lead line, on one side of a sturdy fence.<br>  see if you can be comfotable standing by the fence, on the side away from the horse.  this should give you security as will having a handler hold the horse.<br>  if u r cool with that , try reaching up and touching his shoulder.  the handler needs to know that this is not the day to let the horse sniff you or put his face around you.<br>  if u can do that , call it a day.<br>  next time, do the same thing, and keep doing that til your comfortable with it.<br>  i have been aorund horses for 40 years and have learned it is best not to mess with their muzzels to much, or hand feed and i keep my face away from thier heads.  if you follow simple precasutions and are with someone gentle and experienced, you should be able to overcome your fears.<br>  it will take consistant work, so u need to decide how imprtant is this to you?|`|BGyxjekKaa	The more time you spend around them the less scared you will be.<br>  <br>  My bf was scared and just starting brushing my old pony, who was a softie, he spent so much time around her over the last 2 years hes now absolutely grand with them and looked after my horse for 2 weeks when I was away :) <br>  <br>  (still wont get on one mind you lol)|`|oFMCWge3aa	Go horse riding at your local stables on one of their ploddiest and steadiest ponies!! then you will see that most horses are calm and friendly with people. <br>  <br>  BTW They can sense tension in you (like a sixth sense really)!! So be calm. RELAX!   They only kick if they cant see you or they are cautious because you are acting strange or you are tense     xxx|`|dPRWWDazaa	OMG evreyones tlking crap like the first three people!<br>  <br>  You will eventully get over your fear trust me its happened to me you gradully take your time and get used to it.

And not two horses kick out if a horse does kick out while you are near them it might just be a fly or if they need too loosen up a little. I think too get over your fear spend some time with a horse or pony nearby. Or even get your own or go to a nearby yard or riding school and you will learn too love them. Good luck x Ps. www.yourhorse.com It is a good way too talk too horsey people too learn about them and horses and their nature|`|7s16Id3paa	Take it step by step. First, look at some in the stable, locked up. Next, Move closer and stand by its head. Then, stand nest to its legs a tail but NOT behind it. Next, pet its nose and its body. Then just sit on one while he's in the stable. Next saddle him up and ride him a short way, then a long way. When you are doing these steps, remember Jesus iswith you and will keep you safe!|`|aqYBECUbaa	just forget the fear, walk right up to the horse and stand there for a few minutes. if it puts its nose near you chances are its just gona sniff you, not bite you.|`|tVrqBT6Kaa	<a href="http://getinfo.knows.it" rel="nofollow">http://getinfo.knows.it</a><br>  A very informative website you can also get much information in website
8i73lpwgaa	Good luck finding anything cheap. xD<br>  <br>  I would ask around your barn or something to see if there are any consignment shops around here.<br>  <br>  Usually, you can find atleast one good pair of riding pants for 20-25 dollars. New ones can start at 60 and then go up. <br>  <br>  For the gloves, I'd look and just get a pair of cheap $4 ones. Its not like anyones checking to see if your /gloves/ are right. As long as they're black and not like mittens or anything, you'll be fine. Make sure they have the little bumpy things on the inside. <br>  <br>  A shirt with collar... You can find some good ones for under $50. If worst comes to worst, buy a sleevless one- they tend to be cheaper, or atleast at my local store they are.<br>  <br>  The coat will be the most difficult. Mine is a hand-me-down, so maybe ask your trainer or people around the barn that are your size if they have any old show coats you could borrow until you get a new one, then pass it on down. Usually trainers will have show coats of various sizes.<br>  <br>  My trainer has two step-daughters that ride, so she has about a billion coats. <br>  <br>  Again, good luck. The price of a show coat can go anywhere from $40 (one on sale) to over $200. Show shirts usually go from $45-$80. Gloves can vary, depending on what material, what they're for, etc. I think I mentioned pants, but new ones usually start at $50 and then go all the way up to over $150.<br>  <br>  Good luck with showing this season! I had my first show of the year yesterday- I have a feeling I'm in for a really great show season. Have fun!|`|EghHVkHEaa	AH god, trying to find anything cheap in this sport is like mission impossible 3. It depends on what you think is inexpensive...but you could try statelinetack.com - maybe. Ebay is defiantly an option but you never know how good of quality this items you get are and then they come and they suck and its only a few days before the show, and your screwed. SO you could try finding some good deals at SLT, even dover saddlery is having some awesome sales right now so check that out too. Omg i love my ariat tall field boots, they are one of the best investments i've made in awhile.<br>  <br>  Good luck, and happy showing haha.|`|E7rHP654aa	ebay or craigslist|`|82AxruXBaa	i would try ebay or craigslist|`|RZPLec5Eaa	<a href="http://chicksaddlery.com/" rel="nofollow">http://chicksaddlery.com/</a>|`|Xobbmd7Saa	doversaddlery.com<br>  statelinetack.com<br>  <br>  Both are great website with reasonable prices that you can order online from and Dover even has some retail stores. Also, check for local used tack sale in your area because I got a how coat for only $10 at one and it was quite nice, lasted 3 seasons, then I outgrew it and sold it for $30 at a used tack sale so after using it, I made $20. <br>  <br>  Also, do not forget about tall boot socks and a belt! I made that mistake at my first show....I borrowed a belt but uh not having the right socks was really painful.<br>  <br>  Got my pants from Dover for $50, gloves for $4 and shirt for 35. Huntcoat was only 10 at used sale!

2kjGc7xvaa	Best to answer your questions numbered.<br>  <br>  1) you need a cycled aquarium because you need beneficial bacteria. When you start a tank there is no bacteria in the gravel, filter pads, ornaments, etc. You need this bacteria for the fish to survive. The bacteria eats ammonia that is produced from decomposing fish waste, decomposing excess fish food, etc. After the bacteria "eats" the ammonia it turns the ammonia into nitrite (less harmful but still lethal). A second bacteria "eats" the nitrite and turns this into nitrate (least lethal of all). Nitrate levels will always be present but water changes are needed to keep them low once the tank is cycled and established.<br>  <br>  2) Cycling can take anywhere from 2 weeks to 2 months. It really depends on a lot of factors and there really is no way of saying. You will know when the take is done cycling when ammonia levels are at 0 and nitrite levels read 0.<br>  <br>  3) Your second question and fourth question are similiar so here is a combo. Cycling with fish or without is a personal choice. Back in the day tanks cycled with fish. Now we have ways of doing it without needing to add fish (adding fish will mean they suffer through the process and have a very high chance of not making it). If you do a cycle with fish basically you would set your tank up add water (make sure you condition the water with water conditioner) then add fish and let it take its course. If you do this you will need hardy fish such as Danios and some tetras. I prefer to do a fishless cycle. To do a fishless cycle is just as easy accept you need to fight the urge of putting fish into an empty tank until it is done. To do this method you would fill your tank with the gravel, decor, water, filter, etc. Once you do this run your filter for 24 hours. This will build the current and get the filter up and running. After 24 hours you need to add an ammonia source. Some say add direct ammonia drops but I don't think adding chemicals is ever good. Instead add a pinch of fish food each day. When the uneaten fish food rots it will release ammonia. Now the last part of this is that yo need to introduce a starter bacteria. Without fish there will be no bacteria introduction. There are many cheap products that you can use (BioZyme, Cycle, etc). Add the bacteria as directed test your water every other day for ammonia, nitrite, and nitrates. Once the first two are 0 you are done. But be aware that this may turn the water cloudy, it is normal and not a problem. Let the water be as that is just a bacterial bloom. Until the bacteria settles and colonizes it will form clouds in the water....it's harmless and temporary.<br>  <br>  4) Cycling means you are creating a biosystem that creates a healthy environment for fish. Cycling creates bacteria that converts ammonia into nitrite, which other bacteria turns the nitrite into nitrate.<br>  <br>  5) Ammonia and Nitrite are most important. The only other things to keep an eye on is the temperature (make sure the temp is at a point appropriate for the fish you are adding) and pH. Do not go crazy over pH, chemicals do not adjust the pH and as long as you are within a reasonable range of 7.0 (6.4 to 7.8 really again depending on species of fish) you are in fine shape.
a075ibDMaa	4-6 months.... my baby rats did this when I first got them so I put the cage on a table in the middle of a room so if they escaped it wouldn't be a big deal. Eventually they grew up. <br>  <br>  Warning however if your rat gets used to squeezing out between the bars it may try when it gets to big to make it fully. I awoke one morning to find my poor Pedro caught dead in his cage because he tried to escape and couldn't fit. :(<br>  <br>  If you can try to find a cage with half inch bar spacing or modify your cage with coated wire mesh so they can't fit between the bars this will solve all your problems and also prevent any horrific accidents.|`|8RRZvkqBaa	they can get fully grown from 4-6 months. they leave their mother at 5 weeks, so you might want to put your pup in a glass tank so that it cant escape. then when it is fully grown (or cant make it through the bars) put it in its new cage! <br>  <br>  I'm talking from personal experience!<br>  dont let the rat get under anything that would crush it (sadly, more experience talking R.I.P Gonzo)|`|BFTjTpy9aa	they get full grown at 6 months

jZGg0gNKaa	She could have a Urinary tract infection. Call and make an appointment at the vet. It's easier to have them collect a sample then you. When we got our last puppy she had a UTI. I didn't realize until i was so fed up with failing housebreaking i was about to go crazy.|`|GSf09ALBaa	UTI.  Urinary tract infection.  Get a fresh urine sample (shouldn't be a problem the way she is peeing) and get it to your vet as soon as you can.  This is very normal in puppies.  Get that cleared up and you can go back to the potty training. <br>  <br>  Right now, she can't hold it at all.
GSf09ALBaa	Dogs are pack animals and almost all dogs enjoy the company of others.  Some dogs don't.  Does your dog like other dogs when you walk him?  If he gets excited and wants to play, then it would probably be a good thing to do if you feel you can handle another dog.<br>  <br>  Finding the right dog is important.  I suggest getting one from a rescue.<br>  The foster home can tell whether a dog is dog friendly.  You will probably need to have a 'meet and greet'.  Try it and see what happens.<br>  Petfinder.com.<br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|GLsCVPCuaa	has he always had this look on his face? What you feel is him looking "sad" may just be his normal look..if you walk your dog daily, feed him, and spend time with him both inside and outside of the house, he should have no reason to be sad....|`|6SeWCfUfaa	That 'sad' look is not sad.  It's a submissive kind of look meant to communicate that the dog views you as being higher in the pack pecking order than he is.  It's a good thing.<br>  <br>  But the dog coming to you and doing these things is communicating something else as well.  It's saying "spend time with me."<br>  <br>  Now you can spend time looking at your dogs "sad looking" face or you can get off your butt and go teach it to play fetch or something a little more active.  I guarantee it won't look so sad if it's doing something fun with you.|`|ULpjTKYDaa	hi!<br>  yes i think your dog maby a little lonley get her another dog one that it can run run round with and play with.<br>  dont worry though loads of dogs live on there own with only the company of a human.he is not sad though my lab used to look this way all the tie and it was the most spoilt little dog he got everything and he always looked sad lol it just the way there face is .i would get another dog but if not your dog is fine if it has company of a human.<br>  hope this helps|`|KTqdwG3Xaa	Are we human? Or are we dancer.|`|fU4pOpeHaa	you should spend more time with him. Show him you love him. You don't have to get another dog unless you feel that its necessary to get one. Adopt another dog if you want one, not because your dog seems lonely. Bring him to the park, run with him, play with him.|`|7tDDXKEOaa	Well, walks are good for both you and him. He may have separation anxiety. This is common in lots of dogs. You didn't state work hours etc, if you're out the house a while etc, so if you are, maybe give him a good kong to play with to keep him occupied. Petting and affection is good, but not if he's in the wrong state of mind. If he's looking sad, cheer him up by getting a toy out the closet and having a little play. If it's necessary that you have to come on the computer, so be it, he will learn that you need your own time and space. If it isn't, then maybe give that compy time up for doggier? I don't think another dog would help. But I don't know alot about your lifestyle. If you are out of the house often, then maybe, but if you are there regularly, then maybe it isn't needed. Good luck.|`|dWK0B5g3aa	You and your dog could play together and train him to making a bit more happier. But if you think that the attention you give him is enough and he is still not happy then I don't see why not, as long as you are prepared to take on another dog.<br>  An older dog more his age and size would be better so that they can play happily as a young puppy can sometimes irritate grown dogs and maybe if you speak to a shelter and ask to 'borrow' a dog as a trial to see if it does make your dog happier|`|Lk4brWmfaa	Yes he can, I suggest that you get another dog because dogs are pack animals also if you leave him alone a lot he will start thinking he is the leader and stop listening to you. Also if he is sick or on any meds you might want to add that in your question.|`|l0ktQUnWaa	Dogs are very social animals. They love attention. If you decide to get another dog, make sure you introduce the two to see if they are friendly, or if the are aggressive! A Lab is probably the most social of all.|`|sy8HIiVUaa	get him a buddy and share the same attention so he wont get jealous but you have to know how to introduce them though also dogs are most happy while in a pack..<br>  <br>  2 is a group and a group to a dog is a pack!=D|`|VPQLoSYFaa	he could just be a lush. he looks up to you for love and attention like most animals. another dog may not hurt but its getting to 2 to be happy in the same home with each other without them biting each others heads off.|`|a1wly9wRaa	My dog is like this too somtimes. So I think getting another dog may help.Feel free to contact me if you have any more questions about animals.|`|MKuDawP7aa	When dogs are domesticated and we bring them our new houses they still miss their old family members. They miss their original "packs" because that is how they feel comfortable. In order for your dog to be a happier pet you need to make sure you spend time with them.<br>  <br>  Now this can be a hard task considering all the work you have to do so here are a few tips. every time you go out even for grocery take your dog alone. Even if your pet sits in the car, he or she will feel better looking at other outside things. Dogs are a lot like human beings they crave attention and want to be with other people at all times. You should try to keep your dog occupied even while you are doing your work at home on a computer, try throwing a ball or cuddling him or her often. You can make them lye near by to your sofa. Make sure you pet them often and play with them. Encourage your family members to play with your dog as well.<br>  <br>  If you feel your dog is not eating properly or has issues that can be a result of the negligence. Spending more time and petting your pet more will make him/her feel better. Whenever you go off to sleep how about you make your dog sleep in the same room as you. Your dog does not have to sleep in the same bed as yours, but anywhere in the room as long as he or she is comfortable. Buying your dog a new treat is another way to lift up their mood. Try buying them a new type of food for their breakfast or lunch menu. Buy them a new ball or anything that makes them feel jumpy. If your dog randomly roams around with other pet's at the street, that is not necessarily good for them, they need your attention.<br>  <br>  Playing with your dog, petting them, caressing them, feeding them will all benefit him. So if you are noticing your dog being blue utilize these tips to make him feel better.
Jis9ipcNaa	I want to ask how large are these water changes? What are your ammonia/nitrite levels at? When you say cloudy do you mean milky white or green?<br>  <br>  If it's green, algae problems which have a number of remedies, the best of which (if you don't have live plants especially) is to turn the light off and cover it for four or five days.<br>  <br>  If it is milky white, I suggest checking your ammonia levels. That color usually indicates a bacteria bloom that needs to settle (meaning ammonia is high).  <br>  <br>  Next thing I can say, maybe do a smaller water change if you are doing a lot, or try doing one less often.

6SeWCfUfaa	Licking is something seen in a lot of animals.  It's not always a stress response, it's a communication thing.  It's meant to communicate a "hey, I'm not a trouble maker, I just want to be friends, I like you, I'm no threat" sort of thing.  Dogs do it, horses do it ... a lot of animals do.  <br>  <br>  In this case, his licking is telling you "yes, it's ok to stroke me, I'm not going to complain about it."

However, I am also inclined to think she is lacking something in her diet maybe. Whenever she sits up on the sofa or our chairs with us she is trying to constantly lick our hands, arms, neck, face...basically whatever skin she can find! She does not lick her self incessantly...just us! What is this all about? Even after washing hands or showering, she is still trying to lick. Any ideas?<br>  She eats well - Dog Chow - 1 - 2 cups per day, plus dog bone treats. She drinks plenty of water. She is very happy and well adjusted. <br>  <br>  -- posted by dadoteen <br>  <br>   Permalink  Print Discussion  Email Discussion  How to subscribe to feeds <br>  <br>  --------------------------------------...<br>  <br>  Top 2.

Joy Butler - lick us to death?!!!! <br>  <br>  In response to lick us to death?!!!! posted by dadoteen:<br>  It's too bad we can't ask dogs why they are so "licky" sometimes. There are any number of theories. Some say it goes back to the mother dog licking her newborn pups to clean and stimulate them. Some say it goes back to pups in the wild licking the mother's lips asking her to regurgitate food for them. Some say it's a submissive gesture. But my opinion is that in most cases, licking is just an instinctive thing for them. They lick to groom themselves and I think they lick each other in a comforting gesture, sort of like a stroke or pet. It could possibly be interpreted as a doggy "kiss." That may be what your dog is doing. If you squeal or laugh when she licks you she could even be doing it for your response or for the attention she gets.<br>  I had a little terrier for 15 years who used to lick the water off my ankles when I stepped out of the shower. I'm not sure why she did that but some dogs don't like to get wet and will lick themselves dry so maybe she was just trying to help me dry.  <br>   <br>   Joy Butler <br>  Feature Writer for Dogs <br>  <br>  <br>   Permalink  Print Discussion  Email Discussion  How to subscribe to feeds <br>  <br>  --------------------------------------...<br>  <br>  <br>  Please follow the guidelines set forth in the Suite101 Posting Etiquette when adding to the discussion.<br>  <br>  <br>    <br>  Guest writers <br>  david perlmutter <br>  dr. franklin house <br>  josh dorfman <br>  julie angus <br>  michael gerber <br>  mignon fogarty <br>  nate cavalieri <br>  robin cowie <br>  more in suite <br>  business & finance <br>  education & career <br>  film & tv <br>  food & drink <br>  health & wellness <br>  history <br>  home & style <br>  mind & soul <br>  music <br>  outdoor & recreation <br>  partners & parents <br>  plants & animals <br>  politics & society <br>  reading & literature <br>  science & nature <br>  sports <br>  technology <br>  travel <br>  visual & performing arts <br>  writing & publishing <br>  Plants & Animals <br>  birds <br>  botany <br>  cats <br>  desert/water-wise gardens <br>  dogs <br>  flower gardens <br>  freshwater fish <br>  horses <br>  houseplants <br>  insects/spiders <br>  landscaping <br>  mammals <br>  organic gardens <br>  pet care <br>  plants & bulbs <br>  reptiles & amphibians <br>  saltwater fish <br>  vegetable gardens <br>  water gardens <br>  wildlife preservation <br>  archive <br>  categories <br>  dogs (general) <br>  dog breeding <br>  dog breeds <br>  dog care <br>  dog shows <br>  dog training <br>  Latest Articles <br>  healthy human foods to feed dogs <br>  cheap toys for dogs <br>  the future of dogs in the technological age <br>  choosing a new puppy <br>  picking out a new puppy <br>  should i microchip my dog? <br>  the overuse of steroids in veterinary care <br>  more articles in dogs <br>   <br>   about us ? limelight blog ? writing jobs ? careers ? press room ? site map ? terms & conditions ? privacy policy ? suite101.de
hFyodb4Daa	It should be fine but try getting a timer on the light fixture since they need light to survive and leaving the light on 24/7 is not an option|`|vZv60NJ2aa	Yes, they will be absolutely fine. But only if you follow some simple instructions.<br>  <br>  Firstly, they need a certain amount of light each day (5-6 hours). So, I think you should invest of purchasing a timer, which allows the tank light only to switch on for a certain amount of time.<br>  <br>  Secondly - feeding. You can buy 7-day feeding block which you simply put at the bottom of the tank, and allows the fish to feed off of the block. This lasts about 7 days, they are a very effective method.<br>  <br>  Finally - water quality. Be sure that you do a 10% water change before you leave for your vacation. This will ensure the water will sustain it's quality until you return.<br>  <br>  Hope this helps.|`|SGwxaTIGaa	They should be fine but they need some hours of light so make sure you have a timer to control the lighting whilst your away.
bfe89b40e0344af279288338e469b235aa	Google dog prey drive - it is a NORMAL psychology  for a dog to chase fast moving things. They have to be TAUGHT that joggers & bike riders are NOT suitable "game".

You just have to relax him a lot and he will come around eventually.<br>  <br>  Hope this helped!|`|MatEdTtOaa	they follow their trainers action fire the trainer|`|lcGriJXiaa	He obviously "hates" bikers or joggers, and it's possible that the reason is that he's been hurt or scared by them.  The more he has "friendly exposure" to this situation, the less he will be intimidated by it.  <br>  <br>  If you have some biker/jogger friends, get them to help you.  When your dog (on leash) tries to "attack" them as they ride/job by, issue a specific command that calls for the behavior to stop and that you will reserve only for that situation.  Then speak reassuringly and calmly to him, stroking him and being close to him.  Have your friend/friends stop and speak calmly to him as well.  Once they have stopped, his imagined "threat" (usually related to the fact they are moving fast) is eliminated, he will probably respond favorably. Then have your friend/friends offer him a treat.  Repeat this procedure several times within a short period of time until he stops "attacking". Then try him out on "the real thing", on leash to see if he still wants to "attack".  If he remains calm, reward him with praise and a treat.  If not, repeat the experience with your friends.  It may take some time, but eventually he should learn that they are no longer a threat.  <br>  <br>  I would recommend having many of these "good" experiences with "the real thing" while he is on leash, however, before letting him run free.  Although he may actually feel more secure off leash (in his mind he can then always run away from the threat if need be), he needs to feel his security from you, on leash or off.  Eventually, he should be trustworthy either way.|`|z4HT4siBaa	You need to teach your dog to trust you and other people around him. You can do this through exercises using attention as rewards. This lack of trust is making him defensive and on attack mode. <br>  Sometimes the best way to calm down an aggressive dog is to show it a lot of love with out spoiling it. Don't show your appreciation for your dog through treats, show it through physical contact.<br>  But a dog that has been abused will often just take a lot of time to become adjusted to a nice life, so just give him plenty of love and show your disapproval through nothing more than a stern voice, and a yank on the lead if he's trying to hurt someone. He'll soon learn to trust people. Especially if it's you who is telling him to not hurt people that he doesn't trust.<br>  Good luck.|`|IddUYNR3aa	Get help from a trainer, preferably in a class with other dogs.<br>  It sounds like he was not socialized much as a pup. The nipping may be because of lack of training, and if he's partly a herding breed, this is natural behavior, but still needs to be controlled.   You need an obedience training class so you learn to be his leader.|`|lqG3SQ40aa	Well maybe take him 2 the vet and see if they have anything 2 say. If not that maybe take him 2 obedience school or something like that.
bnJLKQWMaa	Wellness makes a food for less active or overweight dogs, you should check that out.<br>  <br>  Stay away from Science Diet and Iams and all the grocery store foods.  Most are very low quality foods with lots of fillers, one of which is corn and is not good for dogs at all.<br>  <br>  Google dog food analysis and you will see what is rated as a good dog food.|`|GSf09ALBaa	If you want recommendations on dry food such as Iams and Cesars you are not going to get it here.  The best foods out there are Wellness, Solid Gold, Taste of The Wild, Ennova, Canidae and several others.  You want a dog food that has no fillers, corn, wheat, soy and other junk.  Do some online research.  The better food you feed, the less health issues you will have with your dog and the less vet bills.<br>  <br>  It is a win win situation.|`|GLsCVPCuaa	Ol' Roy<br>  KIbbles N Bits<br>  Purina<br>  Iams<br>  Cesars<br>  Science Diet<br>  <br>  ^^^^^^like giving your dog a cheeseburger every day<br>  <br>  <br>  Blue Buffalo<br>  Canidae<br>  Merrick<br>  Chicken Soup for Dog Lover's Soul<br>  Solid Gold<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  ^^^^^^much better choices, just compare the ingredients between these and the ones mentioned earlier...good luck|`|Fvuq2Nwiaa	Well I don't know what to tell you if you are looking for a garbage brand like Iam's and Cesar's. If by Cearars you mean Cesar Milan that food is mostly grain and costs about $2.25 a pound. Iam's will cost you about $2.00 a pound. The main ingredients are: Corn Meal, Chicken By-Product Meal, Ground Whole Grain Sorghum. All of these are garbage. P.S. In both brands I was looking at the weight control formulas. <br>  <br>  You do not need a formula more special and personalized for Pomeranian. That is a GIMMICK.<br>  <br>  You can get a much better quality dog food for the same price that you would pay for these or less. Such as:<br>  <br>  California Natural Chicken and Rice Low fat: approx. $1.40 a lb.<br>  Diamond Naturals: approx. $0.85 a lb.<br>  Eagle Pack Holistic: approx $1.45 a lb.<br>  Dick Van Pattens Natural Balance: approx $1.50 a lb.<br>  Professional Lite (made by Diamond): approx $1.00 a lb.<br>  Chicken Soup for the Dog Lover's Soul: approx. $1.15 a lb.<br>  Premium Edge<br>  Taste of the Wild: approx $1.50 a lb.<br>  Solid Gold....: appox $1.50 a lb.<br>  ....and many more!!!<br>  <br>  All the foods listed above are good quality and contain no corn of any sort, no by-products, artificial colors or flavors, wheat, and are all naturally preserved.<br>  <br>  Do your research and you will find you can get a way better quality for about what you are currently paying or even less expensive.

They used to give samples on the website so you may want to check that out before purchasing.  Tips*** No table scraps at all.  No treats until they lose that weight.  Get your animal more active.  Play with it, using throw toys, take it outside so it has a more vast area to run & play to get some exercise.  The more it plays the more water it drinks too which will help flush its system out.  Good Luck!|`|YxGyd2yZaa	Well, the food I would recommend gets me thumbs down. Even though I have been using it for over 15 years with my pets. <br>  <br>  Purina One. Our Australian Shepherd that passed away last year (14) ate Purina. Our cat eats Purina. And our current dog, Labrador, (5 months) eats Purina. I find nothing wrong with it, and I do recommend it. <br>  <br>  For a 2 year old Pom, I would feed her.... Twice a day? You would have to look at the back of the bag to see how much you should be feeding her. <br>  <br>  Good luck =)|`|8cWXhZGjaa	Pro-plan|`|On9zqYl0aa	I would look into all natural food. Stay away from things that have ingredients like bone meal, fillers, etc. Look at ingredients and stick with foods that are made of things you can pronounce and know what they are. <br>  <br>  Check to see if you're giving her the right amount. Use natural treats as well and no table food. I have 2 dogs and know it's hard sometimes because they look so cute and you know it would taste good to them, but the fact is they're not made to digest the same foods as us. After they know they are not getting table food they won't beg which is nice. Hope this helps :)|`|OkJp8W4naa	Dog food nutrition directly influences every aspect of your dog's life.

J5hsCONRaa	Long and cliched, overused but ever popular with me - <br>  <br>  "He is my other eyes that can see above the clouds; my other ears that hear above the winds. He is the part of me that can reach out into the sea. He has told me a thousand times over that I am his reason for being; by the way he rests against my leg; by the way he thumps his tail at my smallest smile; by the way he shows his hurt when I leave without taking him. (I think it makes him sick with worry when he is not along to care for me.) When I am wrong, he is delighted to forgive. When I am angry, he clowns to make me smile. When I am happy, he is joy unbounded. When I am a fool, he ignores it. When I succeed, he brags. Without him, I am only another man. With him, I am all-powerful. He is loyalty itself. He has taught me the meaning of devotion. With him, I know a secret comfort and a private peace. He has brought me understanding where before I was ignorant. His head on my knee can heal my human hurts. His presence by my side is protection against my fears of dark and unknown things. He has promised to wait for me... whenever... wherever - in case I need him. And I expect I will - as I always have. He is just my dog." - Gene Hill<br>  <br>  <br>  It really bugs me to when people let it go to a vote.

I tied a small bell to a string, had the dog sit. Holding the string, I would swing the bell to hit his nose and jingle. Then give him a treat. Repeat a few times. Then hang the string to the door handle. Do that every day. After a few sessions, the dog gets the idea and swings the bell in order to gain a treat. But no treat: open the door and have her go out as you do. Treat her only if she goes. One week of this and your problem will be solved.<br>  Another advantage of this method is that you will know when the dog wants to go out even if you're not in the same room and unaware of it.

While people say thats too small even for them, I used to have some in a tank that size, and they were allways breeding. That indicates to me they were healthy and happy enough.<br>  <br>  Goldfish are definately out. While you could actually put a baby goldfish in there, remember it's a baby.

qOiv8d3Laa	Regarding a license, you may not be ABLE TO OWN one where you live.  There is much controversy about the Savannah cat, and SOME states (and provinces, maybe) do not even ALLOW people to OWN them since they are so "close" to their wildness.<br>  <br>  So the FIRST thing you should do is contact your local law enforcement, animal control officer, humane society, town/city hall, and check on the ORDINANCES to see if you are allowed to own one.<br>  <br>  THEN, if it is alright, see the websites the other person has cited.  If you have a family with young children, you might consider not owning one.  The dog and cat you own now... .. depends upon the their temperaments if they will get along with ANY other animal.

3uIOlUo7aa	Do not rely on your dog to protect you.  They can give warning and often people won't bother breaking into a house with a Doberman or other large breed dog in it but it is not terribly likely that you purchased a dog that is capable of being properly trained to do protection work.   I have owned the breed for decades and I have had them protect me without being 'attack trained' - they either have a sound, stable temperament and a strong bond with their persons or they don't.  You need to socialize her well so that she is knowledgeable about and not fearful of various situations and occurrences and take her to motivational obedience classes to learn to train her to be under control but the protecting thing is either going to happen or not.  I had one b*tch that attacked a man that broke into my bedroom one night and she was very loving and playful and even people afraid of dogs weren't afraid of her but when the need arose, she protected.  I have protection trained dogs but I honestly don't think you need to be doing that unless you are already pretty adept at reading and training dogs to begin with.  <br>  <br>  If you are concerned about being broken into, get alarms or any number of items that would make you feel safe but while I have some sense of well being living with five Dobermans, I don't place my safety solely on their capabilities.|`|6SeWCfUfaa	You don't have a teach a dog to attack for it to be a deterrent.  Nobody in their right mind is going to walk into a house with Doberman.  Your doberman comes hard wired to be protective of it's family.  If she's obedience trained and bonded with you, she will naturally be protective when you really need protection. <br>  <br>  And if you really want a protection trained dog, find a good trainer and be prepared to spend thousands of dollars training with your dog.  Be prepared for your trainer to possibly tell you that your dog does not have the right temperament to be trained as a protection dog.  Not all dogs are cut out for that. <br>  <br>  But please, please, do not follow any advice you find on here about turning your dog into a protection dog.  They need to be professionally evaluated and trained to attack on command.  And trying to do it yourself, without the guidance of a pro will probably only result in you have a an aggressive dog, not the protection dog you want.|`|AA11316609	A doberman has a scary bark and that may be all you need to keep intruders away. Teach him to bark on command. <br>  <br>  However, if you want to train him to attack on command, hire a professional dog trainer.  You need to always be in complete control of an attack dog.

pYF9KnNeaa	The important first question is, did your birds come from a reputable breeder or a pet store?  If from a pet store, please do not consider ever allowing them to reproduce.  Most stores get their bird from bird mills, which means they are usually inferior, genetically speaking.  They can be great pets but they are not sound breeding stock.  Also keep in mind that if your birds are pets now, they are not likely to be pets, once they reproduce.  Birds are pets or they are breeders, rarely both.  Also you have to be sure they are old enough to be reproducing. If this is your first experience with breeding birds, there is a lot you probably don't know yet, but must learn before you begin.  Breeding birds is not a simple as putting two birds together and hoping for the best.  You must have gotten some training, hands on, in hand feeding chicks, knowing what to look for so if they get in trouble, you can spot it immediately and know what to do.  It's just not a simple process and to save you and your birds a lot of possible heartaches and health problems, I'd recommend you do a lot of studying first.  If you will go to google, put in "breeding lovebirds", there will be a lot of sites come up that have tons of necessary information for you.  Please read them before making your final decision.
W67WGs8Gaa	If you take her to the vet and she isn't sick, this should be an easy problem to fix. She may be going through a little depression from trying to cope with her new surroundings and not being sure what's going to happen to her. Be very reassuring and comforting to her in the first few weeks in her new home. Make sure to get LOTS of play time in. Try playing soon after she goes to the potty because she will be up and active. Taking her for walk or for a play session in the park to see the other dogs play might get her blood pumping. Buy her a new smelly toy that she can't resist or use one that she has found on her own to bring on the walk. If she plays with it there she will likely play at home. Don't forget lots of treats to coax her into trusting you. And NEVER force her into anything and remember to be the pack leader. Hope this helps.|`|ebAVX2Puaa	I just got a pom puppy about 2 weeks ago and she did the exact same thing. turns out she had a kennel caught virus and that's why she was acting that way.. but it could be that she has low blood sugar. poms can get like that if they dont eat enough|`|yNwSeNbhaa	If you really love her, you need to take her to the vet.

f5a8d99afbb73cd0703df99b87996901aa	Have both the cats fixed ASAP. Inbred kittens can be very sickly or even be malformed.  My vet gives a discount when I bring in more than one cat for surgery.  See if yours does.  If you can only afford to have 1 done, take the female. Chances are she's already pregnant but if you hurry you can still have her spayed.  If you're concerned about taking innocent lives, think about the innocent lives that are on the line in shelters because of pet overpopulation. Young mothers often reject their young due to stress and you could end up having to hand raise the kittens if they survive.  Spay/neuter is the best choice here. Don't delay.|`|Qw7ymfakaa	You get her spayed/fixed Paige !|`|8GeNdCsIaa	keep them seperated ur female is prob pregnant now. should have had him neutered and her spayed.

It is Husky/German Shepherd!<br>  <br>  Beautiful too!<br>  <br>  I work at the SPCA and see tons of Husky/German Shepherd mixes.<br>  <br>  Yours is beautiful.|`|sy8HIiVUaa	it could be an Australian Shepherd mix.|`|xwdyhZA8aa	german Shepherd!!!|`|YVmM9Fanaa	akita german sheperd maybe?|`|26686mOVaa	I like the look of a husky.

His ears are much to hairy to be a Husky mix.
44kEtDvIaa	Phone and ask.  Prices can vary.  Also do some research on these great pets.  Site below has good info and ferrets links.  Worth looking at.|`|xq2J2LMSaa	Get at least two. They don't do well alone.|`|yeumYaGUaa	Im not sure but nice hair. My brother bought a pet ferret and he said it costed about $20-$25. This was at Petco.
x21vLT8Naa	Absolutely - YES!!!<br>  <br>  Lovebirds LOVE to shower, and it's perfectly fine to shower with them. You can even purchase a shower perch that has suction cups on the end so that it will attach to the wall of your shower.<br>  <br>  My only suggestion is to hold off shampooing your hair until your birds are done "dunking" themselves in the shower stream, as your head may end up being one of their favorite spots to perch along with your shoulders and arms.  Our modern shampoos would dry out their skin.<br>  <br>  Lovebirds love to bathe, and should do so regularly.  Strange as this may seem, they prefer the water ICE cold (which I don't recommend in the shower, unless you like to turn blue).  You can cup your hands under a kitchen faucet with the water on cold, and your birds will dip into your hands and have a great time for about five minutes.<br>  <br>  I have a pair of lovebirds that are now 13 years old, and have enjoyed many showers with them.  I hope that you experience many wonderful years with your pets.|`|Ced4C4Ckaa	yes it's alright. But don't stick them under the water, just let them bathe in the steam. But if they get scared, remove them immediately. If they try to get near the water, sprinkle a little on their backs, but make sure that the waters lukewarm, not really hot|`|UxuDuwUWaa	Maybe the chemicals in your soap and shampoo, might be toxic for them|`|09e41Hdwaa	Sure it is.  If they want to bathe hold them on your finger and let the water bounce off your hand or body onto them.  Don't put them directly under because the water pressure will be too strong.<br>  <br>  You can buy a shower perch that has suction cups that stick to the wall, but it isn't necessary.

WzezLBncaa	if it gets worse its ick or w/e if it doesn't its just an old injury (from fighting or maybe a rock or somthing) and its no big deal and can be treated if you find it necessary...idk what the treatment would be, but you can look it up on google.|`|dEtKbDUaaa	is this a male fighting fish by any chance?<br>  I have had fighting fish both males and females and they have little silver dots on their cheeks, when i got my first fighter i treated it for everything and anything... but if you go to a fish shop you will notice that on the red fighters that they have these little silvery white ish dots on their cheeks and under their chin. if you type in male fighter in yahoo or google and search images you will notice allot of the fighters have the spots. go to a reputable fish store please NOT pets at home as i worked there and i watched allot of the staff there selling fish and not knowing anything about them, find a little store that isn't a massive chain. where i live there is a guy who owns a store and hes been keeping and breeding fish for 40 years and i find hes amazing and doesn't sell fish just to make money or sell them to people with inadequate size or type of set ups..|`|25CAIGfeaa	it's not ick its a fungal infection treat it with pamafix.|`|D5wZLk6faa	Can you post a full body picture of ur betta up close?
342b3711423c978836fa192cef3238d8aa	The seizures could very well be from being hit by the car - head trauma did some damage to his brain.  But I can tell you one thing for sure - if any vet told me that seizures are "normal for rat terries and other small dogs" I'd be getting a new vet so fast, he wouldn't see me leaving!  That's outrageously ridiculous.  And is there a valid reason why your dog hasn't been treated for the seizures?  I personally wouldn't let this guy treat any dog of mine.|`|K6fasl6kaa	considering you are paying dearly for vet care, i hope you can wait till tomorrow for professional advice.  i hope he's ok.|`|6SeWCfUfaa	Seizures are pretty typical for the breed and stress can be a huge trigger for the seizures.  It might be that your pup needs some medication for them.  Your vet will know.<br>  <br>  And I don't think the vet meant that seizures were "normal" I think he meant that it's a genetic problem that's see in that breed, and isn't uncommon.|`|jZGg0gNKaa	Seizures are not "normal" for any breed at all! I would highly consider finding a new vet.
zzaN4wG3aa	That's a good size tank.  Assuming it's fresh water, I would recommend:<br>  2 filters -Rena XP2 or Marineland 350B's are my recommendation<br>  A 200 watt heater<br>  If you want gravel, you'll need a BUNCH.  Probably 100lbs or so, depending on how deep you want it.<br>  Glass tops (keeps fish from jumping and slows evaporation)<br>  A light for the top of the tank<br>  A python (water changing hose - you REALLY want this)<br>  An air pump, hose and an air stone (this is not a necessity)<br>  A master test kit for ph, ammonia, nitrite, nitrate (don't buy the strips!)<br>  <br>  Everything else like backgrounds, ornaments, etc, is cosmetic - actually the gravel is cosmetic too.<br>  <br>  I would highly recommend buying all of that stuff (save the gravel) online.  You will get is MUCH cheaper than in stores.  There is a list of online stores here: <a href="http://www.aquariu.ms/onlinestores" rel="nofollow">http://www.aquariu.ms/onlinestores</a> - I prefer Big Al's.|`|hFyodb4Daa	Appropiate size filter<br>  Heater<br>  Gravel/Fake Sand<br>  Decor and Plants<br>  Background<br>  Water Conditioner<br>  Medications<br>  Food<br>  Test Strips<br>  Hood with lights<br>  Gravel Vacuum|`|gG09T0Cnaa	The easiest is to have fresh water fish so you don't have to keep the water warm. We have goldfish. There are 17 of them and they're very hardy. Some of them have been growing in there for 2 years now. I hear goldfish can live for 10 years or more, and they keep getting bigger and bigger as long as there's room. I tried other freshwater fish at first, but if you pay 3-4 dollars, or more, on a fish and then it dies it gets pretty expensive keeping the tank stocked with fish. Now we use "feeder fish". They are goldfish that are mainly used to feed other, bigger fish, and they're cheap -- around 20-30 cents each. Like I said, they're hardy, too. They last a long time.<br>  <br>  All we have in the aquarium besides decorations is a water filter. They cost about $40 at the pet store. I'm sure you could find it cheaper, too. The fish also like light. Our tank has a cover with a light that shines through. The light makes algae grow. The algae makes the tank look dirty, but really the fish love it. They like to eat it. We clean out the tank about once a month because when there's too much algae the water gets cloudy. So I use a siphon and empty out about 2/3 to 3/4 of the water and take out the bigger shells and rocks and scrub the algae off. Then refill the tank with water that's been setting out over night so it's the same temperature as the water they live in (room temp). The water has to have conditioner drops added to it. We get AquaSafe from Walmart. It's about $4 for a little bottle. You only need one tsp/10 gallons, so it goes a long way. <br>  <br>  So, in all, what we have besides the tank is:<br>  decorations<br>  water filter<br>  cover with a light<br>  big buckets to store the refill water overnight<br>  siphon<br>  water conditioner drops<br>  (previous person said you need a heater, but with plain goldfish you don't)<br>  <br>  Have fun! A tank full of fish can look so pretty and add so much life to a room.|`|Sf5WK1Liaa	that size will take 110 gallons you will need some filters plants rocks water conditioner when you put fish in good research check out the site below it will be good for you make sure that you cover the tank if you are spraying  last thing kwas has tanks for sale that size you want ok good luck|`|8S5y8nmYaa	u need 2 get pebbles or gravel and den sme water plants becoz dey 2 d beauty of ur tank as well as provides suffcient oxygen 2 ur fish , and den a filter , fish food , u can also buy sme small toy things like mermaids or sea horses 2 make ur tank luk attractive
qzPZf2XPaa	Bathe him now with a hypo-allergenic NO FLEA shampoo for dogs.<br>  Do it again in 1-3 months time depending on the dog.<br>  If he gets really dirty just give him a warm soak.<br>  Also, i blow dry my animals as well they don't mind as long as it's on warm not hot.|`|tPGxPDvBaa	You can give pup a quick bath with puppy shampoo only & rinse very well. Then you can use a dryer on LOW only, any other setting is too warm & only use enough to get pup mostly dry after you have thoroughly toweled dried. Only bathe when it is necessary & not cuz you think dog smells doggie & lil dingy. Brushing is more important for a dog skin & coat than bathing.|`|ALAmdtZVaa	Don't worry I've asked all sorts of questions today too! Umm I wouldn't bate a puppy very often, only when they need it. their skin is very sensitive, so it could irritate it. Get puppy shampoo, a gentile one, or baby shampoo. Brushing the pup will actually help it stay clean longer!|`|FaPrr8bbaa	Hi neighbor, its Indiana here. Bathed 3 shorthair dogs today, I started early in the day to make sure they were good and dry by nightfall.  Just use a little shampoo and rinse rinse rinse. Do not get shampoo on pups face or ears, use a wet washcloth for that until pup is older.  Use lots of towels to get pups top coat dry, and keep trips outside short.  Too hard of a spray of water can scare a pup, so water should never hit puppy hard enough to bounce off.  Wet towel on floor of shower so no slip and slide, and you get in there with pup so he can have fun. Blow dryer still scares mine but on low heat that would work.|`|WYItM0YTaa	It really depends on your breed and the type of skin they have. My dog is a german shepard lab and the vet said it was ok to bath every two weeks or so. Also when you blow dry use a defuser so the hot air isn't directed to just one area. We use white pearls shampoo. It is shampoo and conditioner but the vet said you could also use baby wash
ad6d41505ed6ef1120c4595134987a31aa	a full cheek snaffle is the one that is nicest for the horse but the o-ring is almost the same except without the cheeky part... you said u already have the full cheek snaffle so i would try the o-ring... also it might not be the bit, he might just not like having the bit in his mouth... i worked withh a horsse like this, and to help with this, when i got the bit into her mouth, i gave her a treat, and  also i would smear the bit with some sweet  feed or carrot/apple juice and the horse was a lot nicer this way.

Mostly becuase of the apple scent and the fact that they are plastic and more comfortable.

iFdhQ9PMaa	It starts with a surface skimmer which is in the tank. this draws the water off the surface and sends it to the filter. Here the water comes in contact with what looks like a very coarse scrubbing pad which filters out the big stuff. From here some people let it go to the bio balls but I add a layer of filter media to filter out a little more and then on to the bio balls and from there the water can be pumped back to the tank or sent to a protein skimmer, ionizer etc. and back to the tank. <br>   Hope it helped.

8584e0329fb17c662606d5a6a8650ee2aa	Check with your vet but if he has completed all of his puppy boosters for parvo, I'd give it a few more days and then you can take walks.  Just to be on the extra safe side, avoid areas where lots of dogs congregate for now - like parks, dog parks and pet stores.  Just take walks around your neighborhood for now.  And if you sign up for obedience classes, avoid ones held in pet stores and make sure they require all dogs to be fully vaccinated to be in the class.|`|RWTIPOfIaa	ask your vet|`|91Yx2MEyaa	thought they only had to jabs one at 8weeks and the next one at around 12 weeks|`|o93EwErKaa	Three sets is enough to build immunity, but your last shot was only given 2 days ago so I would wait another 2 weeks to give the immune system time to react to the vaccine and produce antibodies, especially since the parvo threat is high.  If he is a doberman or rottweiler or one of the other breeds (black and brown) highly susceptible to parvo than I would even consider one more vaccine at 20 weeks, even though I follow a limited vaccination schedule.|`|GSf09ALBaa	Double check with your vet but I would say yes.  Keep him out of wooded areas and off grass.  Walk him on sidewalks.  Stay away from areas frequented by other dogs such as dog parks and beaches.  Don't let him near any other dog feces.  And if you pet another dog, wash your hands with bleach.<br>  <br>  Double check with your vet!
IYd6bw7Gaa	DO NOT take her to the pet store as it just causes her more stress (which is what caused wet tail int he first place).  Keep her in a quiet place in the house to rest.<br>  <br>  If she was fine this morning it isnt too late.... just need to get her medicated.<br>  <br>  There are medications out there that you can buy.  Wet Tail Drops or Dri Tail.  They come in drop form that can be added to her water.  Dont fill the bottle all the way with water or it will be too diluted to help.  It should come with a dropper, give her the drops orally twice a day.  You CANNOT overdose on this stuff so add it too her water as well.  When we get sick hamsters at work this really helps if you catch it in time.<br>  <br>  This medication is also a preventative so in the unfortunate case that this little one doesnt make it, when you get a new hammie give him/her the drops for the first week its home.  <br>  <br>  In the mean time, clean our her cage REALLY well.  You can use bleach just make sure its diluted and rinsed really well.  Anything wood or cardboard, pitch it because it contains the toxic spores.  Sanitze absolutely everything in the cage, dish, wheel, levels, water bottle. <br>  <br>  Try giving her some burnt toast.  The charcoal is a detoxing food.<br>  <br>  This is caused by stress.  Changing environments is alot for such a little animal.  But keep in mind any time in the future it gets stressed, like if you have a lot of people over playing with her, if she gets out of the cage and lost to give her the drops as a preventative again so we tail doesnt come back.<br>  <br>  Best of luck!!!|`|1CrSuWDzaa	before you put her in the cage was it the same cage you had your other hamster in because wet tail is very contagious between hamsters|`|va8xvhthaa	There are some steps you can take to support your hamster. Remove her food. Eating more will just trigger more diarrhea. She may not have an appetite anyway. Dehydration is a danger, and you need to do something about that right away. The best thing to do is to give her some unflavored Pedialyte (made for human infants) from a syringe. Pedialyte is available in most drug stores, supermarkets, and discount stores. Some convenience stores carry it, too. If you can't get any Pedialyte, give her lukewarm water from a syringe. Put it in the side of her mouth. If you put it straight down the throat, it can be aspirated into the lungs. Give her water or Pedialyte about once an hour. Your hamster must be kept warm, so the heating pad is a good idea. Just make sure that it is positioned so she can't chew any electrical parts. It's also important to keep the cage clean. These are all supportive measures, not intended to take the place of veterinary treatment.<br>  <br>  To read more about wet tail:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.hamsterific.com/IllnessGuide...." rel="nofollow">http://www.hamsterific.com/IllnessGuide....</a>|`|Qim0aSKtaa	Give her some oats, for now, take her back to the store.|`|AA11705978	Bacteria from other hamsters that have wet tail is transmitted to the babies when <br>  they eat fecal-contaminated food/water or from chewing on contaminated toys, <br>  wood, cardboard tubes...<br>  Take this one back and get your money back. Go to a different pet store and ask if any of their hamsters have a history of wet tail, before putting a new hamster in the same cage be sure to get rid of everything in it and clean it thoroughly...stress can also cause wet tail, so let your new baby get used to it's new surroundings for the <br>  first three days before playing with him.<br>  <a href="http://www.petshub.com/hamster/wet-tail.php" rel="nofollow">http://www.petshub.com/hamster/wet-tail....</a>|`|CtK04QcVaa	Did you clean everything really well before getting another hamster? Wat tail is very contagious so its possible that your new hamster got it from something the other one touched. <br>  <br>  Did you let her be alone and not touch her for the 3 days after you got her? Did you notice if she was stressed be something?  Stress can also be a cause for wet tail.  <br>  <br>  What are you feeding her? Is it the same as the store? If you change food suddenly that can cause wet tail. Too much seed can also cause wettail. Make sure she is drinking. They can get very dehydrated from wettail. If you are feeding her pet blocks( they look like hard cubes) keep giving those. NO seed. Giving her seed will make her sicker. Don't give her seed until you're sure she is healthy for several days. <br>  <br>  You can either take her back to the store and get another, take her to the store and let them treat her, buy medicine at the store, or go to the vet.  I don't know what store you bought her at but I know Petsmart does not sell different genders. Are you sure the animals at the store are healthy where you got them? You might try a different store. You could also buy wet tail medicine at the store. I've never tried it so I don't know if it would work. They final thing would be to take her to the vet. They will probably give her baytril or pectin. That you will have to give her by mouth everyday for several days. <br>  <br>  Good luck|`|GaSK15Kpaa	Well it could just be that - diarrheoa... because the symptoms for wet tail are - <br>  <br>  Listlessness (ie. not moving for periods of time)<br>  Lack of interest in food<br>  Loss of coat condition<br>  <br>  And then they get the watery diarrheoa which makes their tail area constantly wet. You might be waking her up to early which is why shes never awake when you go sometimes my hammy doesnt get up till 1 in the morning and other days hes up at 6. <br>  <br>  Is it the same cage you had with ur hamster with wet tail - if yes did you disinfect it and clean it first? If no then take her to the vets straight away - NOT THE PET STORE - pet stores rarely know what to do and even though it might cost a bit at the vets theres more chance of her recovering in the vet where they can properly diagnose whats wrong.<br>  <br>  Luci|`|rchaTSI9aa	Maybe she does have wet tail. I don't really know. But I do know that your baby boy had wet tail before. So since he has wet tail, did you ever even wash the cage and all the other things that your first hamster touched? Because if you didn't even clean them, then those germs rubbed off onto your baby girl, and that could have cause her to (maybe) get wet tail. So if she does die :(, and you decide to try one more hammy, make sure you wash the whole cage and all the accessories the first day. Let them dry. The second day, use some cleaning stuff that you can find at the pet shop. And then on the third day, you can get your new hamster. <br>  <br>  I hope everything works out with your baby. :)<br>  <br>  Also, I've heard that rasberry leaves help stop diarrhea, so if you have any on hand, you can give her some of those. And toast, too. But make sure it's whole grain bread. And make sure you give her lots and lots of love. Then take her to the pet shop tomorrow.

I don't exactly know why she asked me to do this, but I think it is a certain task you might want to do for your cat so help encourage it to use the litter box.<br>  You might even want to call the vet or ask someone who knows a lot about pets if this is a good thing to do or why your cat is acting this way.|`|VHa5PIfpaa	You can't really force an animal to do anything... especially something as personal as go to the bathroom.

All you need to worry about is whether or not they had the relevant health checks done, if they have, the breeder should have evidence to show you.|`|o93EwErKaa	When you say Bichon Frise cross does that mean you are looking for a mix and not a purebred?  If so, a mix cannot be registered with AKC so you will not find one;however, the parents could be registered with AKC if they are purebred.  Reputable breeders do not produce mixes.|`|44kEtDvIaa	It is unusual that 2 dogs that have been bred and are Amercian Kennel Club registered don't have the litters registered.  Normally, the litter is registered and you have to finalize it.  Doesn't make sense.  There are times when you can buy a pup but don't get the papers and have to spay or neuter the pet ... this is called pet stock and the price will reflect this.  I'm thinking that if you're finding pup that are not registered then there's something wrong with the parents.|`|4b8fb7d13eab5f34e3a4f0ce4fbb2680aa	Some good reasons for buying a KC Reg. dog is that at least you know that the mother wasn't used as a puppy machine, that she wasn't too old or too young when she was bred from and you have some form of redress if the puppy turns out not to be as described.<br>  The KC does not register cross breeds, so you won't find one. <br>  There is no such thing as a "good" breeder of Bichon crosses - no reputable breeder deliberately crosses 2 different breeds and Bichons are one of those breeds much loved by puppy farmers. <br>  <a href="http://myweb.tiscali.co.uk/hopeuk/bichone_frise_rescue.htm" rel="nofollow">http://myweb.tiscali.co.uk/hopeuk/bichon...</a><br>  Contact the Bichon Frise Club, they may know of a dog in rescue:<br>  <a href="http://www.bichonfriseclubofgb.info/otherinfo.htm#specialneeds" rel="nofollow">http://www.bichonfriseclubofgb.info/othe...</a>|`|yLwKWzIUaa	well usually if a breeder's dogs are registered with the AKC or CKC then their puppies are too. <br>  i would keep looking for registered breeders. in my opinion they're the ones who should be supported as oposed to back-yard breeders<br>  check the AKC/CKC websites|`|Nhje1U06aa	if both parents are AKC registered  usually the pups are.

This is called a designer dog and they are not an actual recognized breed. Parents will be AKC because they are a purebred dog. Good notable breeders do not produce designer dogs.

If you want a dog www.dogbreedinfo.com has a quiz you can take that matches dogs with your life style.|`|ALAmdtZVaa	Mutts! I like German Shepherds, Border Collies, and Labs. And Huskys and Australian Shepherds! Haha I like lots of dogs. I'm not the biggest fan of small breeds, but some can be great too!|`|5j1Uhg2Gaa	A German Shepherd. If you train them right they are very loyal and loving. They are great with kids and mine never harmed another dogs even the small ones. If you get the American line they are not at all like the German line. They are not aggressive and they are smarter too. And they will love and protect you, your family and people they know no matter what. They are also good with strangers too if you socialize them but they will still be weary of those you do not approve. they are awesome animals. this breed is the only one so sensitive enough to your feelings I have ever had.|`|valvULe3aa	Labrador retrievers.

44kEtDvIaa	Since there's 3 of them they do have company so it's not quite as important, but even so they do enjoy and need that human interaction.  You can check the site below for more info on ferrets, plus some good links for other info you may find interesting about the care, handling and health of these great little pets.|`|NJkVyydqaa	ITS not going to harm the animals but it would be best to so it can get a lot of exersice, but take it out every once in a while.|`|AA10684271	Ferrets are curious, playful, and loving, so if you are unable to "let them out" at least handle, talk, and play with them once a day. By this I imply having them in your hands (one at a time if you are new to them) and not setting them down.<br>  <br>  Ferrets are fast and curious so they need to be watched like a human baby or baby animal due to getting into many things. Thus, "ferret proof" the area they are in before "playing" with them in an open area. This means cabinets, openings under doors, animal doors to outside and such should be covered/locked. If you are not familiar with them, don't take them outside. They get loose and you may never see them again. A general rule is a ferret can get any where as big as his head. I lower this by half when dealing with unknown ferrets or known stubborn ones. I have one that can go through a hole 1/2 the size of her head due to this type of stubbornness.<br>  <br>  They need to eat high protein and fat items with little or no sugar due to being "high energy" mammals. This does not mean dog food. Good ferret food has 30-50 % protein, next in line may be a decent cat food if you cann't find ferret food at a store or vet.<br>  <br>  Be careful of them with other animals. Ferrets rarely injure others while other animals do hurt them because they are so different from what dogs, cats, and such normally run into. The warning signs of a scared or protective ferret is a hissy squeek and trying to run to hide. I give them preplanned areas you have thought of for them to hide where they are safe and the other animals cannt get them. Under a couch, in a cardboard box are examples of this, if loose. The ferrets often will come out and play with what they are scared of in a few seconds, so let them "test" the other critters this way. This works for being around small children too. Tell the kids not to grab or move fast and the ferrets will climb and nuzzle on them often times. <br>  <br>  Theres a start.|`|573Q4zCpaa	ok well u seei know just about everything u could now about ferrets so u dont have to let them out of there cages EVERYDAY just atleast talk to them everyday oh and if u do take one out u hve to take them all out becuase they can get jeales and trust me u dont want to deal ith grumpy ferrets the next day WHEW!!! lol anyway make sure ythey have fresh food and water daily and it would be good for them if u took them out atleast 5 times a week AT LEAST if u can take them out more then that then that would be great.|`|8RRZvkqBaa	i know ppl that have ferrets as dogs and they let the ferrets out with the dog (they dont run away). they also put litter boxes around inside their house. it prolly cant be too harmful but they need a LOT of attention.|`|x3ly5oSdaa	No ....... but try to take them out at least 10-15 or 30 minutes everyday or buy toys for them. Honestly think about it ferrets in the pet store never come out to play.

Huskies have a knack for escaping, if he got loose you wouldn't want him to get hurt because he was afraid to come to you. Try getting a group of friends with dogs and walk them together so he see's that walking with you and being around you is a positive experience (because you said he loved interacting with other dogs.)
90c1c20841cf7509e708485e190f2851aa	Rattlesnakes and other pit vipers break fangs in the process of eating many times, and have as many replacement fangs as they need. While removing the fangs wouldn't directly kill the snake (infection from improper removal could, as could just being put under anesthesia to perform the operation) the snake would have to be fed frozen thawed food items, and the snake would have to be monitored to tell when the next set of fangs had grown in... then all the risks involved with going through the procedure again and again and again for the rest of it's (definitely shortened) life.<br>  <br>  There is a surgery that can be done, however, where the venom ducts are destroyed... much like a vasectomy. This is not only an expensive operation, but also difficult to find a vet who is qualified and willing to do it. Again, the snake will have to be fed prekilled food for the rest of it's life as this is a permanent procedure.<br>  <br>  If you're asking this question because you want to keep a rattlesnake, you need to change your mind right now... every snake owner gets bitten eventually (if you don't, you're not in the club), and keeping venomous species makes that inevitable bite all that much more dangerous. Keep a bunch of nonvenomous species alive for their average lifespan and see if that's enough fun for you before you burden yourself with an animal you probably won't be able to get rid of.<br>  <br>  Oh, nearly forgot I was gonna link this in: <a href="http://images.google.com/hosted/life/f?q=rattlesnake+skull&prev=/images%3Fq%3Drattlesnake%2Bskull%26start%3D40%26ndsp%3D20%26um%3D1%26hl%3Den%26rlz%3D1T4ADBF_enUS232US234%26sa%3DN&imgurl=ef3af74cf2f28bec" rel="nofollow">http://images.google.com/hosted/life/f?q...</a>|`|oG5HNFUOaa	If you de-fang a rattlesnake, it's life will NOT be long. It's inhumane and cruel, and I hope you don't have any plans on doing that. The fangs wouldn't grow back, and I'm guessing it would still have poison, but it couldn't inject it into it's prey.|`|2qgg2G8kaa	The fangs will grow back if you pull them out. The snake will still be poisonous because all venomous snakes have poison glands underneath their eyes. The glands are sort of big so that's why those snakes have broad heads. The snake wouldn't die because the fangs would eventually grow back. Doing this to a snake is cruel, all though people still do it. If you take the snake's fangs away it cannot kill it's prey and defend itself.

They are so extremely over & poorly bred now.
azcwMiO8aa	Most worms can be passed on to other dogs and humans by contact.  Even if you don't see worms, the eggs, which infect us, come out of the anal area.  When you pick up the puppy, you get the eggs on your hands; then you swipe at your nose and voila! the eggs are lodged in your mucous membrane and ready to make their way down into your digestive system.  Babies are very susceptible to worms just like puppies are.  If your dog is on a monthly heart-worm preventive, it is likely that it also rids him of other parasites too.  Life's kinda yicky that way.|`|FNX2YlrMaa	First, get him to a vet.<br>  <br>  Second, STOP feeding him human food.  He'll learn soon enough that that food is not for him.

Unfortunately there is no treatment for such viral infections. <br>  Otherwise, Edema (Dropsy) is a condition where the abdomen swells due to a concentration of fluids in the bodies tissues or cavities. If caught early enough treatment may save the fish. If the body is extremely swollen however, treatment usually just prolongs the fish's suffering.

One other is fine, though. Feed them in different regions of the tank, and only feed them when they are at the top.<br>  4 of those white loach fish would look quite cool with the goldfish.<br>  Instead of buying too much fish, you can buy deco:<br>  One Roman castle<br>  A few water wisterias<br>  Bamboo<br>  caves<br>  Driftwood<br>  Interesting rocks.<br>  Cool gravel, or sand.<br>  Some more beneficial equipment includes:<br>  Air Pump<br>  Internal filter<br>  <br>  Have fun buying!<br>  PS: Wash ALL decor thoroughly- especially the driftwood.|`|Yfgf47lBaa	not too many fish... maybe other types of gold fish?!<br>  different colours!?<br>  stones on the bottom, i also have some plastic brightly coloured larger stones on the bottom of my tank, some plants, floating on the top as well as the ones on the bottom. and also a pirate ship for them to swim around and through etc or a bridge maybe?! good luck!|`|fSJrgVU7aa	The three fish you have will be too much for a 55gal aquarium before too long.

Your best bet would be build a pond for both the goldfish and the koi and turn the 55 gallon into a tropical tank were there is a very large variety to choose from.|`|OAzJPUkHaa	Move the koi, a 55 gallon tank is too small for it.  <br>  If it's two fancy goldfish, they're fine alone.  Two common goldfish need a pond or a bigger tank.  Your tank won't "look empty" when the fish grow.
r4Ggo4jJaa	what? they don't breath surface air.<br>  if they are in a big enough tank with adequate filtration they don't need an air pump.  you realize these are pond fish right? not meant for tanks. hope you are prepared to house a 3 foot lng fish|`|SOxdyWQOaa	no since they go to the surface for air|`|t5vQeaSJaa	no if they are in a out side pond, and not over stocked
89c7e5af6668337660a2665976affbf3aa	I asked my vet this about my puppy and she said it'd be best to wait till after the 3rd set of shots, just in case. Better to be safe than sorry you know.<br>  <br>  She said until then, if I want to take him out, I need to either hold him or put him in a pet stroller.|`|AA11101806	make sure the vet gives the pup a Bordatella (kennel cough)  treatment.  This isn't a standard thing with a lot of vets.<br>  <br>  <br>  It can be given as a shot or a intra-nasal drip.  <br>  <br>  Bordatella becomes painful for dogs, and is annoying for the owners.|`|IddUYNR3aa	Wait until all the shots are given, and then wait another week. It takes time for the body to build up immunity. It isn't instantaneous after the vaccination. You are probably safe now, but I'd wait.|`|ZHrR3BQKaa	Just wait until she has had all her shots.<br>  <br>  You can never be too careful.<br>  <br>  I have a dog and we waited until she had them all and she is fine.|`|MUEtjI16aa	hi its okay that ya lll take your puppy's out together as 4 him catching anything as long as hes getting his shots hell be fine|`|erOKvXjHaa	if your dog don't walk just pull him it work for my dog.|`|0QTCiCf8aa	If she has had her parvo shot she is fine! - The other dog has had all it shots there is no problem.|`|GSf09ALBaa	Ask your vet.

They give you insight on specifically what the test calls for and gives you the information that you need in order to pass the test. It provides all of the knowledge and care information as well as the riding portion. It's not a website, but a book, but it will give you more information than the test sheets, it will give exactly what the inspectors will look for in your answers.|`|nuc5DBD8aa	Pony Club website maybe?|`|penuzN8jaa	nope sorry!!
rqIm1Dbyaa	Im sorry for the loss of your dog. It must be very sad. As far as Im aware airedale dogs are a great dog but they can get eye and ear problems quite often so I'd suggest a vet card or insurance. They usually live for around 9-15 years and have an average litter size of 8. They should get 1hr to 1 and a half hours of exercise a day and can grow as tall as 60 cm's. Airdales are known to be good with children so your little sister should be fine. They are friendly, adaptable and courageous dog showing all the terrier characteristics. They need firm handling as they can be stubbern sometimes but they are usually loving and obedient. They are easy to tain and make excellent family dogs because of there playfulness. They are also good guard dogs. They are usually black or grizzle and tan in colour. Some may have a little white between the front legs. An average Airedale costs ￡500- 800 as a puppy and it cost around ￡6 a week for food.<br>  <br>  Hope this is everything you need to know and if not have a look on google and type in Airdale dogs. I hope I helped and good luck xxx|`|EbQPqpf2aa	Airedale Terriers are used to hunt game and are also used for working dogs. They have no problem with livestock but if they are not properly trained, then they will annoy the livestock. This dog is intelligent, strong-minded, and are stubborn but is also a great dog with a sense of humor.|`|UiOZJTgtaa	yes  but they do have A LOT of health concerns like hip dysplasia,eye problems, and skin infection. they live to 10 - 13 yrs they have a non shedding double coat so you will might have to do hand stripping wich means pulling out dead hair by hand their Temperament they are <br>  independent, territorial dog breed. Initially suspicious of strangers, the they make a good watch dog
zdu3gh8jaa	There is a number of reasons why younger dogs and pups do this, from mistaking the poo's as another food source, especially if there is undigested food in it. Gsd's are very fickle stomached at the best of times - wouldn't you think they wouldn't eat stuff that increases this. Anyway, I have heard many people say to feed the dog who's poo is being eaten ( in your case your dog) a few pieces of pineapple with their food and it will make their waste unpalatable. I know a nuber of people who have done thin and found it worked.<br>  I hope it helps and good luck to you in the futue.|`|WBXi14WYaa	hmm..<br>  maybe it gets fascinated, eats it, discovers it is gross, throws it up, forgets, and the cycle repeats!! <br>  lol idk ask your vet|`|JLkUUFV3aa	thats gross<br>  take him 2 the vet!!!  its not healthy!!<br>  for one thing he's eating waste, so that's bad<br>  also when he throws up, there's hydrochloric acid that can burn away @ his throat and teeth  <br>  just dont let him eat it anymore|`|da17c3f6648c6d689a838075ba38d9b1aa	not sure why they do that but i do know that you can buy pills that will make there poo taste bad (like it doesnt already lol)|`|8cWXhZGjaa	Your dog may have pica, take him to a doctor. Dogs eating their own poo is a sign of an illness.|`|Rqb9gPN5aa	What on earth is a shephred?
nFcl0BOsaa	In some breeds, such as Poodles, dog hair does not stop growing. Actually it is more accurate to say the hair has a long growth period.|`|e871c3bc7828a54588e8b88635cfba63aa	People's hair just doesn't stop at the point that most of us prefer.|`|OC2lG1nTaa	Lol, this question made me smile, I have never thought of this one before. Im guessing its because animals shed their hair alot quicker than we do. I think if it was down to genetics like someone said then humans have all the same genetics because human hair continues to grow even after death. I think God is pretty cool in creating animals, cause you cant imagine in the wild, lions and tigers going for haircuts. God is wonderful.|`|ZHrR3BQKaa	Dogs stop growing hair in the summer and start to shed it.  This is because they shed their hair in summer and grow a new coat in winter.|`|IddUYNR3aa	The length is determined by genetics.
kyTBaYFlaa	its just a phase|`|GSf09ALBaa	How long?  If it is more than 24 hours get the dog to a vet right now.<br>  Good grief.|`|Nc7clhzIaa	Obviously there is a problem... First of all, no table scraps.  That can constipate the animal.  As for the no peeing... UTI maybe?  See the Vet, they will have a better answer than any of us.|`|40zewEkMaa	You have to feed him and give him water in order for him to pee and poop.  PET ABUSER!!!!!|`|wDVWnSuIaa	How long? Go to a vet|`|AA10500537	yes its sick call your vet|`|wJdAybRnaa	Take him to the emergency vet NOW. If this has been going on for more than a day, he could kidney failure or god knows what else.|`|EbQPqpf2aa	You shouls take him to the vet immediatley. These could be signs of a serious disorder.|`|qldtwh5Qaa	he might have an infection or some sort<br>  <br>  best thing is to take him to the vet so they can see the real problem<br>  =)
C59bTKO2aa	We had several poultry houses.  Whatever chicks hatched we would keep them all, so there were always several roosters in each house.  I never saw roosters keep a hen from brooding, but we always took the new brood  and mother out once they hatched.  We did that because a new mother would be very protective of her babies even when there was no real threat.  In her excitement, she could step on her brood killing or maiming the chicks.  I don't now how you keep your birds, but I would just run some wire between the two adults until the chicks don't need the warmth of the mother.  That way they can see each other, so when the wire comes down, it's not like suddenly introducing a strange bird.
MKuDawP7aa	First though, when coming up with a name keep in mind a few things to watch out for.<br>  <br>  - Stay away from names that might be potentially embarrassing to both you AND your dog. The name "Stinky" might be cute at first, but once the joke gets old, think of how you'll feel a year from now when you have to call "Stinky" home at night. Embarrassing names could also apply to negative words that might rhyme with your dogs name.<br>  <br>  - There's been a tendency in recent years to give dogs human names. Though there's nothing wrong with this, be kind to your pooch and name him after someone you like. Also, if want to name him after someone you know, better check with that person first to see if it's alright. I'm not sure how much your human friend Max will like hearing, "Get off the couch Max!" or worse "We took Max to get fixed today."<br>  <br>  - If possible, keep the name to one or two syllables. Dogs not only learn it quicker, but it makes them easier to train as well.<br>  <br>  On with the names!...<br>  <br>  In this article I've listed just 3 of the many dog name categories that might help you to think a bit outside the box when coming up with great puppy names. They are...<br>  <br>  Unique Dog Names: Have you ever considered naming your dog after something that you eat or drink? I'm serious. Allow me to give you just a few examples that will hopefully get your creative juices flowing... <br>  Bon Bon: I can see this as a good name for a small black dog. <br>  Caviar: For a dog with expensive tastes. Maybe a good Poodle name? <br>  Jalape?o: A good name for a dog with a sometimes fiery disposition. <br>  Crouton: Another good name for a small breed. Maybe a Chihuahua? <br>  Latte: Possibly a good name for a black dog. <br>  Kahlua: I can see this name on a brown dog.<br>  <br>  As strange as it sounds, many more food and drink related dog names can be as close as your refrigerator, pantry or liquor cabinet!<br>  <br>  Cool Dog Names: The dictionary defines the word "cool" as something that's fashionable, or hip. To me, when it comes to dog names, a name that's "cool" is a name that one doesn't normally hear. One that is creative enough to be memorable. And that perhaps matches that particular dogs appearance or disposition. Here's just a few names from my site that I put into the "cool" dog name category for starters...<br>  <br>  Aspen, Azure, Capri, Charisma, Denali, Java, Mahala, Maui, Mignon, Nirvana, Pirouette, Rio, Sahara, Sierra, Taboo, Tiara.<br>  <br>  Funny Dog Names: By funny, I'm referring to cute dog names that will match it's physical appearance. Here's just a few ideas... <br>  Espresso: For an energetic black dog. <br>  Kisses: For a small affectionate pup. <br>  Brutus: For a BIG dog. <br>  Putt-Putt: For a dog with short legs.<br>  <br>  Here's some additional ideas...<br>  <br>  Big Dog Names: Barbarian, Big Foot, Butkus, Chewbacca, Genghis, Godzilla, Hummer, Terminator, T-Rex, Tsunami<br>  <br>  Small Dog Names: Doodle, Gumball, Kewpie, Laptop, Nibbles, Widget<br>  <br>  For additional funny ideas, think opposites! Peanut for a BIG dog, Moose for a small dog.<br>  <br>  As you can see, it's easy to find unique dog names and considering that your dogs name will be used an estimated 15,000 times during her lifetime, isn't she worth taking a little extra time to pick a perfect name?|`|XnEnelsBaa	I call my Jack Russell '**** for Brains', apparently the JR breed is highly intelligent, this one must be the exception!|`|sy8HIiVUaa	jack<br>  jax<br>  skip<br>  skyden<br>  marley<br>  clouden<br>  nacho<br>  racer|`|YVmM9Fanaa	Jesse<br>  :]|`|T7ds09Vyaa	chester,rosko,jack,topper,copper,snicker...|`|c3ca1809b26e1bf5bee30ba656dfc02baa	Flash the wonder dog|`|ZfKDp7IXaa	Jack<br>  Buster<br>  Ike<br>  Kote<br>  Nate<br>  Ben<br>  Sam<br>  Billy<br>  Will<br>  Joe<br>  Jake<br>  I like Sam best|`|On9zqYl0aa	Sammy<br>  Randy<br>  Jacques<br>  Jamie<br>  Ken<br>  Dana<br>  Bri<br>  Jordon<br>  <br>  Good Luck! :)

You might want to know because you want to breed them, or give them the right name before Jack turns out to be the mother Goldfish! Here are some clues that might help you sort out the Goldfish boys from the Goldfish girls:<br>  <br>  * The female Goldfish are slightly bigger than the males and look even heavier in the abdomen when they are full of eggs.<br>  <br>  * Male Goldfish develop white spots on their gills and pectoral called “breeding tubercles” during spawning time.<br>  <br>  * Males have midline ridges on their undersides beginning from the back of their pelvic fins and ending at their vent opening. This feature can be absent or smaller in females.<br>  <br>  * Males have firm abdomen while in females; the area between the pelvic fins and the anal fins is more pliable.<br>  <br>  * Male Goldfish have longer and pointed pectorals as well as stiff fin ray, while females have more rounded pectorals and shorter, finer front fin rays.<br>  <br>  * Male goldfish have smaller and more oval anal openings and the anal fins are not as thick as that of the female goldfish who has a larger and rounder anal opening with a slight protrude. The anal fin is also thicker.<br>  <br>  * The spawning time is the easiest time to distinguish the boys from the girls. The female opening will look larger and more swollen as the eggs begin to ripen. She would look big and heavier. Since fish reproduce through external fertilization, you can make out when a male is ready by the white breeding tubercles and you can actually push out the milt through his ventral opening by running a gentle finger along his sides.<br>  <br>  * There is one more obvious, but kind of time taking way to make out which one of your fish is male and female. Find out who is chasing who – the chaser will be the male and the chased and tired out one will be the female! It’s the natural tendency on part of the male goldfish to chase and nudge at a female’s rear part.|`|simoTgZ5aa	male bettas are more beautiful they have larger fins and like females they are colorful and females are pretty plain ...i|`|WW6tGWVFaa	Male betas, have long pretty fins, and females have very short fins.|`|a1wly9wRaa	Males are more colorful and have larger fins.|`|ijvWMbxVaa	the males have long fins, the females have short fins.|`|kekaqHESaa	males have huge fins. look up a pic of male bettas on google. they are way bigger and more colorful than females|`|xwdyhZA8aa	its pretty hard but normally the brighter ones are boys and less brighter is girls!

It makes his LESS valuable actually.<br>  <br>  Eyes - Kind, friendly eyes imparting good temperament, intelligence and alertness are a hallmark of the breed. They should be of medium size, set well apart, and neither protruding nor deep set. Eye color should be brown in black and yellow Labradors, and brown or hazel in chocolates.<br>  <br>  Only a BYB would ask something like this of course|`|y0cbLn0Yaa	The ONLY thing that makes a dog of any breed more valuable is the string of titles before and after its registered name.  While the eye colour is not a disqualifying fault, the dog would have to have exceptional conformation to succeed in attaining a Championship title.  Therefore the dog would have to excel in Field Trials, Obedience, Agility, etc to increase its value beyond that of a pet Labrador.<br>  <br>  Your dog may be very beautiful to you, as all dogs are beautiful (and unique) to their owners, but a dog's intrinsic value is how it conforms to the breed standard or its working abilities.  Love your dog and give it the best home that you can but don't try to fool yourself, or others, that it is either rare or unique.|`|Bw18seFqaa	no.<br>  <br>  his eyes may change color yet.  At 7 weeks its too young to tell what his eye color will be as an adult.  <br>  <br>  Color of eyes or coat does not make a puppy any more valuable than another puppy.  Value is based on pet or show quality, and bloodlines.<br>  <br>  Labs are suppossed to have brown eyes.. if his eyes do not turn to brown, he is not show quality.. just pet-quality.  He is worth just as much as any other pet-quality lab puppy.|`|2S0BkT7oaa	Oh goodness... <br>  <br>  No he is not more valuable..|`|tnTxHVO5aa	No it is a fault.

Give him/her  time.<br>   I have had 2 for 37 yrs and they still scatter 75% of the time.<br>  They cannot hear or see well so they feel you coming by the vibrations each foot step take. <br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/29035692@N03/sets/72157612827773738/" rel="nofollow">http://www.flickr.com/photos/29035692@N0...</a><br>  <br>  some advice of 37 yrs and counting?<br>  <br>  Aquatic Turtles are a life long commitment.<br>  <br>  Remember 10 gallons for every inch of turtle. <br>  You need a heater...set at 80 degrees. If water is cold they will stop eating! <br>  Sliders, westerns, cooters , midland, painted, map, yellow bellied all are basically the same and require the same basic care. <br>  They NEED calcium and protein they get it from the fish meat and the fish bones. Drop 20 or 30 or so feeder guppies or small goldfish or minnows they maybe a bit fast for babies at first just drop in the tank and watch them disappear in a few days! The more they eat the healthier the turtle.<br>  <br>  Plus I also feed dried cubed blood worms or tubiflex worms or pellets at least 5 times a week for my five..<br>  They can have garden worms which I collect after a good rain and dump them un the pond, also meal worms, snails, crickets, flies, crayfish small frogs, slugs, tadpoles ,dragon flies and anything that moves, but only as a treat.<br>  They need leafy greens Romaine, Butter lettuce. (Iceberg and cabbage are bad for them, any other leafy greens will do) for vitamin A that they need at least 4 to 5 times a week.<br>  They love grapes and strawberries and squash , apples.<br>  These turtles in captivity do not hibernate.<br>  TOSS in a bird cuttle bone in the water for calcium that will promote better shell growth, it will dissolve real slow and if they eat it that’s fine!!<br>  <br>  Did you know that they need to bask under a reptile light UVA/UVB for up to 8 hrs a day for the vitamin D that they need to grow. <br>  So they need a turtle basking dock. <br>  Gravel larger than they can swallow, allot larger.<br>  Their water needs to be clean otherwise they get sick easily from dirty water cause they poop allot. <br>  You need a GREAT filter system depending on the tank in a 60 gallon my girls were in one, I used two double sided marine or penguin filters…It really helped keep it cleaner! <br>  <br>  They will bite very very hard. Under 4" they carry a disease called 'salmonella'. So you must wash after every handling ANY size turtle..<br>  <br>  ***And my pictures don't lie. All ages and all sizes get along as long as their is allot for swim room and plenty to eat! They can become cannibalistic if you have 2 or more turtles and a small environment. They will kill off the smallest and then fight for the tank for themselves.<br>  <br>  Size for basic aquatic turtle is approx Body length: 5-8" is average for males, up to 12 inches max for females, but average is about 9 to 10“ in captivity. Life span: 15-25+ years plus. Males have the longer front nails and are used in mating. And are considered mature at about 5 yrs old. You can’t start sexing till about 3” across. <br>  Real mating happens in May through June and hatchlings within 90 days. Eggs are laid in soil. If laid in water they will die. Do not cut the males nails!!<br>  They sleep at the bottom of rivers, streams. lakes or ponds or your tank to avoid predators like coyotes, foxes, owls, hawks, possums, raccoons and even some wide mouth bass and us humans.<br>  <br>  ***Some sicknesses they get easily Like shell its actual holes rotting through the shell. * Swollen cloudy eyes comes from lack of Vitamin A. Which we all need for good eyes. <br>  Respiratory sickness, lopsided swimming, coughing, vomiting, blowing bubbles from their nose. .<br>  Fungus white cotton patches on their skin.<br>  <br>  Contact rescues sites…and vets<br>  Red-Eared Slider: <a href="http://www.anapsid.org/reslider.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.anapsid.org/reslider.html</a>|`|KgxgE3hcaa	Probably because turtles live in water and its suffocating|`|CuGT5X6eaa	mine does it....
FvAl3UgQaa	You cannot tell a tortoise's age simply from its size. If he's wild caught then an expert may be able to give you an estimate from looking at detailed photographs, but that is all it would be - an estimate.<br>  <br>  What I can say is that, at that size, if you have just bought a male horsfieldii from a store, he is most likely a wild caught sub-adult, but if he's captive bred then he could have reached that size prematurely (due to overfeeding) and may only be a year or 2 old...<br>  <br>  Sorry to not be more help, but if others do reply and say "at that size he's x-years old" they are only guessing - they cannot know...

V5DON3XGaa	IT'S NOT UR FAULT OTHER PEOPLE KILL DOGS-LET HIM KEEP HIS NUTS!<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  ETA:UR RIGHT, ME AND KiKuSiNgH ARE THE ONLY ONES WHO ANSWERED U WHO SHOULD EVER REPRODUCE!|`|GSf09ALBaa	Because most people are irresponsible.  They don't spay or neuter and they also don't supervise their dogs.  We end up with litters of puppies that end up in shelters.  The over population of dogs and cats is mind boggling.<br>  <br>  If you are a responsible person who will keep your female away from potential pregnancies during heat cycles then that is up to you.  But you have to realize most people are not like you.<br>  <br>  I have been reading a very interesting article about hormone replacement therapy in dogs.  Seems spaying and neutering in dogs can cause problems in the future as it does in humans.  (Mostly women.....)  It also brings about the thought of leaving the ovaries intact and doing a vasectomy on the males.  <br>  <br>  I will be posting a question on this site soon that has to do with this article and what people in the community here think about it.  <br>  <br>  Stay turned.|`|Bw18seFqaa	each heat cycle puts her at a risk for certain types of cancers.<br>  <br>  There are no benefits behind waiting until a female is mature to spay..  there are far more risks associated with heat cycles, false pregnancies, etc..|`|6SeWCfUfaa	The reason people suggest getting dogs fixed so early is to avoid the problems associated with having an intact dog.<br>  <br>  Just as there are pro's to waiting, there are cons to waiting too.  ie unaltered males over 6 months will usually start marking and can have aggression issues with other males.  These things we know for sure.  On the other hand, it's ARGUED that leaving them intact until they're full grown makes for a more well developed dog in other areas.  There is no proof of this however.  Advocates of it, ie the authors of the articles and papers you've been reading that support this, like to say there is proof, but it's actually never been studied.  <br>  <br>  So, they are your dogs, make your decision, but don't imply that others are doing something wrong.  Because the truth is that the benefits of altering a dog early in life out weigh outweigh the cons in most cases and will ensure you do not have any unwanted puppy too.|`|AoSeHXeQaa	If you think there are too many people in the world, then you should definitely not have children. :o)<br>  <br>  Dogs, on the other hand, dont have that option. Animals are purely instinctual, and are driven by their hormones to reproduce, whether it makes sense, or not.  <br>  <br>  Its unkind to keep a dog intact when it will not be allowed to breed, and most dogs should not be allowed to breed, because their puppies will be unwanted and discarded (or euthanized.)|`|qqUvoC5uaa	Leaving until she is 2 years old to spay is pointless and dangerous.<br>  Dogs are generally "fully developed" physically by 15 months old.<br>  <br>  Studies Conducted on the Benefits or Drawbacks of Early Spay or Neuter done by The University of Florida. These extensive studies were monitored very seriously and concluded that the spaying or neutering of an animal, before it has reached sexual maturity, has no known ill side effects. On the contrary, research has founded that early spaying or neutering of your pet can aid in the recovery process, giving your pet a speedy and virtually painless recovery. These studies were conducted on animals ranging from 7 weeks old to 12 months old. Those 7 weeks old did not react any differently than those who were 12 months old. <br>  <br>  If you spay early, the bitches growth will not be stunted, rather she will possibly take longer to mature. <br>  <br>  Spaying a female can actually protect her against mammary cancer and uterine infections. <br>  <br>  Plus, getting her spayed earlier ensures that you wont be creating more poorly bred pups for the world. And spaying early means that you wont have to be so diligently watching her for those weeks she is in heat. <br>  <br>  But hey, to each his own, if you choose to spay later that's you're personal choice.<br>  <br>  Add:<br>  Yes I do agree with you. People should quit multiplying like rabbits, but unfortunately we're not exactly at liberty to control that. With dogs we can.<br>  DOGS are being killed at a rate of 1 dog every 10 minutes every day in North America. HUMANS at least do not get euthanized.|`|wrUsMG4Jaa	Two years of age is fine, thats generally a good idea to make sure that the dog has entirely matured (clearly you know this).<br>  <br>  Dogs should be fixed for a variety of reasons, one of the top being the extreme health benefits. In females it prevents ovarian cancers, pregnancies, estrus disorders, and more. <br>  <br>  I really can't think of a single con to spaying/neutering, minus that your dog can't compete in AKC events, and it can't breed. But other than that, whats the con?<br>  <br>  The mass overproduction of dogs is a serious problem in the United States. Well over 30 million animals every year are euthanized due to lack of homes and overpopulation. Overbreeding by mills, back yard breeders, and uninformed people are causing severe setbacks in the world of dogs. <br>  <br>  If your animal has nothing to offer to its breed community (ie: its not pure bred, isn't standard, doesn't show well, improper temperament, doesn't follow breed specifics, etc)-- why leave it in tact? <br>  <br>  I COMPLETELY agree with the statement that some people should be fixed. Namely the people who have little to no efforts to assist the growth and expansion of humanity. (IE: Bubba Joe with his 19 kids on welfare and food stamps- readily able to work, just doesn't want to). Go eugenics.|`|IRaIxWJKaa	A small breed female dog would be fully mature at a year and a half, but able to be in and out of heat from 5 months of age.  A large breed matures fully with internal organs and bones at about 2 years of age.<br>  <br>  However, when she's in season, she can get pregnant. Are you doing the responsible thing and NOT letting her be outside where mating can occur?  If you are, then fine. But if you are NOT, then who are you going to dump the puppies on?  THAT is where the main problem lies.  <br>  <br>  Pets are flooding the shelters with this economic downturn. That means dogs who could get adopted before the rush now are euthenized because too many are coming in too fast. Something has to give and it's usually the dogs that have been there longest that now get euthenized.  Adding more puppies to the situation is not ethical.  <br>  <br>  As for problems with not spaying, in regards to the dog's body, she will be prone to less cancer if she is spayed. Cancers of the reproductive tract will be eliminated, as will some cancers that depend on cycling hormone levels.  So yes, it is benefitial for the dog. Once a dog does get cancer, you rarely get more than 6 months after diagnosis before disease takes their life.|`|lek4YlNjaa	I'm not going to neuter my boxer he because i dont believe in doing that sutff and plus hes a healthy beautiful built boxer with no flaws and the world needs more healthy dogs and he also doesnt do the thing they say they unneuter males do he doesn't roam even tho i don't have a fence, hes not aggressive, even with other males, hes friendly with every1.

Also, there are so many dogs in shelters, I don't think people should buy dogs from breeders.  They should adopt dogs - those dogs are plenty good enough. My grandpa has an amazingly sweet mutt from the humane society.|`|Q7jLqFZmaa	In my opinion, (I have a girl dog) I don't want to be giving my dog the extra care anf being careful while she is pregnant. I want my dog it run and play and jump and be her wacky self without hurting herself. I also don't want to be taking care of 5 little puppies, and getting attached to them. <br>  <br>          Other's opinions are they don't want to have puppies, and over-population. if you are going to give away puppies, how do you know if|`|bMW1u8DSaa	Mainly because there is an over population problem right now. Not to mention 99% of dog owners DON'T know how to care for and keep an intact dog. Fixing your dog prevents unwanted litters. Fixing a dog doesn't change the dog. There is really no need for keeping a dog intact if you aren't planning on showing her or breeding her. And not every dog born into the world is show or breeding worthy. If your dog is a pet, and serves no other purpose (i.e. showing) there is no point in keeping it intact. Not to mention there are extra risks for certain types of cancers by keeping your dog intact.|`|VkFDAQ46aa	Mainly due to the over population of dogs and the fact that there are thousands euthanized everyday. to put it plain and simple|`|XgaXvUDBaa	I couldn't have my dog spayed because she was a foster for the Seeing Eye.  A female dog in heat is really not fun... for her or you.  For almost three weeks, I had to keep her in a diaper.  I had to change pads a few times a day and wash the diaper because it would still get really dirty.  The poor puppy had to sit in her crate while it was washing and drying.  She also hated the diaper, but it was well made so she couldn't get it off as much as she tried.  It was about $25 by the way.  I of course also had to supervise her outside (but I always supervise her anyhow so for me that wasn't anything too difficult).  Also, starting several weeks before she went into heat she had a lot of behavior problems, and you could tell she just wasn't happy.  During the heat she didn't seem to be in too much pain, but she did seem to find it an inconvenience.  <br>  <br>  Dogs also heal faster when they're younger... another reason why doing the surgery early is helpful.<br>  <br>  But whatever your decision I do not recommend breeding.  Even if you were able to find homes for the puppies, think that each of those homes could have adopted a shelter dog, lessening the amount of perfectly healthy dogs killed every year.<br>  <br>  Also, your dog will be vulnerable to ovarian or uterine cancer if she is not spayed.|`|8xBlKPPWaa	well fixing a dog is good due to over population but it can mess with the hormone's so to do it asap would be good but other than that when it comes to that time of the year keep a close eye on your female. stuff happens when ya don't. then you end up with pups you don't want or if it happens and shes to young then you end up with pups she wont care for cuz she don't know better,or worse yet under developed and physicly cant do it.  hope i helped. git her fixed.|`|NjiM9hQaaa	Because there are to many dogs in the world!

Then again, she was a rescued dog and spent her early days eating anything she could find. Anyway, it is actually sort of bad to feed dogs people food or table scraps. It is okay if it is not frequently but sometimes. If she was fed people food a lot, she would crave it extremely. It might just be the way she is though.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  Hope this helped.|`|tB7QK6BTaa	Never met a Lab who was not food crazed.  Although I'm strongly against self-feeding in all cases, self feeding a lab always results in a fur covered coffee table.<br>  <br>  So in that sense she sounds normal enough.<br>  <br>  I'm am firmly in the camp that says no feeding the dog from the table, no human food etc... she should never have had spray whip cream, mom should not be feeding the dog while carving, if the dog is lying under the table clearly it's been fed from the table...<br>  <br>  I don't allow any of these practices, it's bad for pack discipline and devastating for the dogs health... but that's just me, I strive for a well disciplined, obedient and healthy pack... others want their dogs to be something else.|`|TWsxP46Qaa	never ever give any breed of dog turkey its toxic to their system<br>  <br>  dogs are hardwired to be mad about food,in the wild African wild dogs will go weeks between kills them gorge themselves so much their bellies will drag on the ground,domestic breeds are only about 4000 years in front of them so evolution hasnt gotten rid of the food drive in them yet,its natural but its also easily de-trainable,take her to a decent obeidiance class any good trainer will help you mind her manners|`|RN1wGlWWaa	Most all labs are pretty food motivated and its easy to train them.  One thing you might want to teach your lab because they are food hounds is the command "LEAVE IT".<br>  <br>  That means that if you drop food (no matter what it is) they cannot automatically grab it - they have to wait for permission to take the food.<br>  <br>  We trained our lab, Keno, to do this mainly to stop her from swiping the cats' treats/handouts.  Now you can drop a treat in front of her and she will watch you for permission to take it.<br>  <br>  Comes in handy if you drop hot food when cooking, chocolate chip when baking, etc.

(Or if she's too big to be put in a lab then maybe play a game with her and that other person.) <br>  Whenever I'm at my friends house and they have a dog, I wish I was with my own puppy but I know she'll be just as happy to see me when I come home. <br>  It sounds like she's not trying to get away with things, but she likes to be babied so try giving her a job. Get into field trials (if she's a retriever) do an agility class (which creates a great bond between owner and dog, but it's different than a babying bond.) or do competition obedience and/or rally. <br>  Get into a dog activity and giving her a "job" will make her appreciate spending time with you, but you'll create a different and strong relationship between you two. <br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|AA10500537	dogs love their master and thats the way it is .|`|cJxNY1Ctaa	whenever you go somewhere, leave her with someone else so that she forms a strong bond with someone other than yourself. its really important to have a well socialized dog, because if she worships you so much she will eventually develop severe, severe separation anxiety. ive seen it before and it is not pretty. it stresses the dog, as well as their human, out big time. when you are petting another animal and she tries to shove past, tell her no, ignore her, and keep petting the other animal. dont rush to her and pick her up. she will eventually catch on, even though it may be hard on the both of you at first.|`|K6fasl6kaa	you love your dog and she loves you.  nothing wrong with that.  as long as you reward her anxious behavior with affection, she'll be clingy and not learn to be confident in herself.  so it's really up to you.  i realize it' s going to be difficult.  when you pick up a baby from bed every time they cry, they learn to train you to rock them to sleep at night, but you would be better to teach baby to go to sleep at bedtime, for the baby and parents.  you may have to withhold some of the affection until she is calm. reward her calmness and show of confidence.  i know you understand dogs more than most people and will find a way to do this.
b2df0927cfc00ec0b4a6f61d9c5cd6e5aa	I would take the older dog if i could afford it medication and could give the time for it's vet. as it is already trained and is more then likely just looking for a home to live out the rest of it's life. The puppy would be adopted out faster and the older dog more then likely will not.|`|BRZccvsJaa	the second dog should be put sleep, and out of suffering.<br>  <br>  chances are, if you get the second dog, it will die soon after and the puppy will be addopted by someone else.<br>  <br>  if you get the first dog, you may have a lifelong problems because abused puppies sometimes turn out to be agressive adults. also, nobody else will take the older dog, and it will be put to sleep anyway.<br>  <br>  i would wait for a third dog to come to the shelter.|`|AA12308199	Honestly, I would take the older dog, as long as I was sure I could afford the medication and frequent vet visits.  Puppies are cute but a pain in the butt.  An older dog would be so much more appreciative and loyal.  I took in an older stray and I tell you, he is one of the best dogs ever!  He is very calm and laid back, too.  Look at it this way, the older dog doesn't have many chances left bu the puppy does.  It would do your heart wonders to adopt the older dog.|`|wrUsMG4Jaa	Puppy. <br>  <br>  At this point in time, I can't honestly tell you that I'd have the funds to care for an elderly dog that needs frequent vet visits. The puppy is healthy, likely to bounce back from his previous ordeal and its not difficult to train. <br>  <br>  If it was in the future, and I had the extra funds for frequent vet visits, I'd adopt the elderly dog in a NY minute.|`|tsnpv9whaa	I can see how this is a dilemma! I would probably go with the first dog! I know older dogs need love to but at his age and current health status he'd be a lot of trouble for you! ( The meds and general care could be costly) the shelter should just put him out of his misery!|`|4SQx8smEaa	This is hard...but I think I would take the puppy..but really it would depend on the temperment...<br>  I would feel very bad for the older dog but....they both would need a home..and need a second chance....and I can not save them both, so at least I would be saving one.|`|WYwGrcknaa	The older dog.My aunt toke in an older dog who was pit mixed and was very sick when she got him.

I want to do Agility with my dogs, and some other things, if I were to get another dog any time soon I would be looking for either a puppy that I could train with my own techniques, or a young adult that was trained Agility, and Obedience, and is completely healthy and does not have bad habits, one that I would be able to return if I found out that the dog actually has bad habits.  If I hadn't already had planned what I am going to get next time that I get a dog then I would go for the older dog though.  Like I said a couple times if I could get both then I surely would!|`|Fvuq2Nwiaa	I think it would depend on how much time and money you have.<br>  <br>  The puppy for example as you said will need training. I wouldn't worry too much about it coming from an abusive home. I got a 1 yr old Dachshund from a very abusive and neglected home and he was an AWESOME dog!!! So if you have time for a puppy I would get him/her. You would be giving it a good home, love and it has a long life ahead of it.<br>  <br>  The second dog I think depends more on money. Medications and often vet visits will add up quickly. I also feel kinda sorry for that dog. With all the health conditions he/she has I wonder if it is happy and if it is having a good quality life. It does not sound as though it has a long life ahead of it. Honestly if it is in pain and gets sick often it sounds like a may need to be put to rest for it's own good. You will get very attached and who knows it's condition may deteriorate quickly and you may soon find yourself putting it to sleep sooner then you would think.<br>  <br>  Best wishes :-)|`|tB7QK6BTaa	Training and remedial work for the abused puppy is no big deal, nor is the self-esteem issue, all a simple matter of proper pack leadership.  The older dog has very little future left... not much of a decision for me, the puppy has a home.|`|zEWgUdUEaa	the older dog any one would adopt a puppy theres a bigger chance it will get adopted ... i would be happy to make a home for a dog in its last years of life|`|gwUMipsUaa	I would take the second dog and see about having it put out of it's misery.  Seriously.<br>  <br>  But chances are such a dog would be euthanized and not put up for adoption.|`|tPGxPDvBaa	The 2nd one cuz no one else probably would & from past experiences I wouldn't adopt another puppy & have to go thru all the training & mishaps. I know more about dogs than the general public & could handle the dog needs better.|`|kWwgWSSgaa	Honestly? Without a doubt the second dog.<br>  An older dog, is fully trained, needs daily medication, and often vet visits -- has hip dysplasia and cataracts.<br>  <br>  Why?<br>  I have had a Bedlington with cataracts & there's possible treatment for it. If treatment wasn't an option, I would adapt my life around the dog. In addition I would take the dog to a specialist to examine the dog to determine the optimum treatment plan for the dysplasia. <br>  <br>  It's no more than I would do for my current Dobermanns.|`|9ea79964f4ddad1359a8089c6729bb4caa	Either one would be fine with me.....it would depend on which one I felt would be the best fit for my current dogs. If it were the situation where I didn't have any other dogs at home, I'd likely take the older dog as I am a sucker for an old dog in need.....but I'd take the puppy if I felt it would fit better into my pack at home.|`|54GBWTgoaa	to be honest if i couldn't adopt the second older dog then i wouldn't adopt either...i know a nice family with money and kids would swoop a puppy up in no time, but the older dog.....if i had the time and money i would do it in a heart beat...that's what rescuing a dog really is...a dog who needs YOU and may not have loads of admirers queuing up!!! <br>  i know when im older and in m y own place i would love to rescue an older sibe and there are so many to rescue...maybe before i got my sibe pup..i would have said the first option...but for sure not now...but if i didn't have the money the dog would suffer so it would have to be the right situation.|`|XEbe4Votaa	I'm not big on puppies (or kittens).  They have lots of people looking for them.  I'm more interested in the adult dogs who need me more.<br>  Eventually, I'd like to adopt senior dogs and give them the best life they can have.  <br>  <br>  However, that is a money commitment I really can't make right now.  Also, I am very realistic about medical care and what is right for a dog.  A lot would depend on the severity of the hip dysplasia (cataracts aren't really so much a problem).  If the dog has sever hip dysplasia, I think the best solution might be euthanasia...but all cases are individual.  If the dog needs daily medication, I'd need to know what medication we're talking about here.  (often vet visits is also up in the air, considering I am able to provide a large portion of care that most people have to go to the vet for myself)  <br>  <br>  Whether a dog is trained or not is irrelevant for me - even if the shelter says a dog is "trained", he's not trained by ME which means we're pretty much starting from scratch anyway.  I'm not afraid to train a dog - no matter how old he is.  :o)<br>  <br>  I'm not saying the puppy would be out of the question.  His problems are right up my ally of expertise.

w1lh1INHaa	Whose fun?  Yours or theirs?<br>  <br>  First of all, training a cat takes way more than two hours -- it takes hours a day, days a week, weeks a month.  And lots of treats.   And that is if the cat is young and cooperative enough.<br>  <br>  Most cats don't see doing tricks as fun, and the ones on TV have been trained for a long, long, time by people who know how to successfully train cats, big or little.  The key to making a cat learn tricks is to take what they already do, and expand on it to turn it into a "trick."  A cat that walks on a high wire already likes to walk on banister railings.  A cat that jumps through hoops already liked jumping great distances from one piece of furniture to another.  <br>  <br>  Why don't you spend a little time cruising through YouTube and look for videos showing how to train cats.<br>  <br>  The one "trick" I have taught just about every cat I have had is "sit."  It is a very helpful trick to teach cats, particularly around kitty or human feeding time.|`|NENNHNVPaa	Yes it is possible.  <br>  <br>  However, most cats are not as compliant as dogs are.  You have to be VERY patient in training them.  It'll take much longer with cats than with dogs.  <br>  <br>  Make sure your treat for doing the trick is something the cat really likes. I've seen dogs do tricks just for the love they receive from their owners.  I've never seen a cat do a trick if it didn't think it was going to get some sort of treat after.|`|pd5rERcfaa	Of course its possible!! I've trained my Maine Coon to sit, shake, jump, sit up, and lay down.  Cats are very food motivated, so make sure you have some tasty treats for rewarding positive rewards.  To sit, hold a treat slightly over your cat's head; he should look up at it and eventually sit in order to reach it.  Soon as he sits, reward.  Same with sitting up, hold the treat up in the air and as soon as your cat sits up to get it, reward him.  Look around online for more tips and ideas, and don't worry, training your cat definitely can be done.|`|9LH3Dz5Laa	of course they can but it takes A LOT of patients, i have a cat that is trained to sit on command for a treat like a dog but it took days and days and days to train him and he still doesnt do it all the time so yeah they can but i wouldnt guarantee that the training stays with them|`|54UnlRQnaa	Well I guess you could train them for fun, but not for any dangerous stuff.<br>  Id try to if i had a cat. Id take 4 cat treats and every time it did a trick give 1 to them.|`|x0WZE0i4aa	You should do it for a few minutes at a time over several days, not 2 hours at a stretch!  And using a few treats, or, even better, part of your cats normal ration of dry food if they have some.  Work on one trick at a time.  Your cat is probably currently very confused and bored!<br>  <br>  First of all, does your cat already know tricks?  For example, does it know what 'get down' or 'food' mean?  If it already knows 'get down', why not work on 'get up', by luring it with a treat onto a stool.<br>  <br>  After that, there's a few things you could try.  A useful trick that many animal actors learn is  to go to their 'mark'.  This is something small and hard to spot, like a tidly winks counter.  The animal is trained that if they go to it when asked, they get a treat.  You could start by putting it down and tapping it to get the cats attention.  When he comes over to sniff it, give him a reward.  Maybe move it, tap it and repeat.<br>  <br>  You can also train the cat to touch the end of a pole, then use that to direct the cat.<br>  <br>  Or you could do sit.  Most cats will sit while they are thinking, so on this one you can pretty much give your signal and repeat till they get it.  Then reward... You can also back them up with your hand: again many cats seem to sit when you do this.  Maybe have a treat in your hand to keep their interest as you back them up with it.<br>  <br>  Up on hind legs can be taught by luring with a treat (though watch your fingers...)<br>  <br>  Once you've got the action, you have to work on getting the cat to relate it to the signal.  I find gestures work better with cats than voice commands.  So personally I use a policeman's 'stop' signal (palm turned up, towards cat) for sit, and wiggle two fingers for up on hind legs.<br>  <br>  Couple of last thoughts: you tell a dog, ask a horse, and with a cat you negotiate.  Don't expect to force or boss them into anything.<br>  <br>  And, I was doing some reading recently, and apparently the number one 'skill' for cat actors is to be able to be held for long periods by strangers.  And that's something you can't really train... encourage maybe, but not train!|`|AA11121172	The big answer is Yes!  and its super easy.  If you have a motivated enough cat, you can have her doing tricks as early as her first session!<br>  <br>  First off, remember cats respond best to positive behavior (dogs do to, but dogs are more forgiving).<br>  <br>  My cat knows high five, up, beg, sit, and watch.  Then I got busy and stopped teaching her.  I use a method called "Clicker Training".  Do a google search, and you'll find lots of websites devoted to this.  Don't worry about which species its for, the technique is the same whether its for dog, cat or dolphin (where clicker training was first used)<br>  <br>  What you will need:  1) a clicker, you can buy one in most pet stores, but a pen that "clicks" will work just fine.  2) treats - Use small cut up food treats, or a favorite toy, or even brushing (what I use).  3) a cat who really wants a treat  and 4) a quiet room with little distraction.<br>  <br>  Clicker training works like this.  It reinforces the good, but not the bad, and clicker tells the cat exactly what it is doing right<br>  <br>  Start off with a trick you want to teach.  Usually the first trick is to sit still and watch.  Animals tend to resort to thier first trick when learning a new trick and isn't exactly getting it.  Having the cat touch your hand while trying to teach sit isn't helpful<br>  <br>  So to teach sit still and watch, start by "priming" the clicker.  Do nothing but click, then immediately treat.  Do this until the cat starts waiting for the clicker.  There is no trick right now.  You just want the cat to learn a click means a treat.<br>  <br>  Now the cat knows what a click means.  Now you want to train sit and watch.  The towel is going to be used as a target.  Its easier for a cat to learn when he knows what he is looking for.  When the cat steps on the towel, immediately click then treat.  The cat won't get it at first.  When he steps on it again, again, click and treat.  Keep doing this until he understands touch the towel means a click and treat.  Then go for two paws, then three, then only when he is sitting on the towel.  Once sitting, click once in awhile with a treat so he knows as long as he's sitting on the towel, he will get a treat.  Right now, there's no voice command.  Once he's got it figured out, then add a command.  Something like "Watch".  So as soon as he is sitting down (timing is very important) say "Watch", cat sits, click, treat.  Do this a couple of more times.  Then, when he is off the towel, say Watch, see if he goes to the towel.  IF he does click, then Lots of Treats (he hit the jackpot).  <br>  <br>  The process isn't all that hard.  I had my cat Grendel touching a stick within 10 minutes of starting this.  Timing is so important.  If the cat doesn't link the click to what he does, he won't know if he is doing right.  Think of the clicker as a camera, capturing the action.<br>  <br>  Some resources on Clicker training:<br>  <br>  Karen Pryors website:  <a href="http://www.clickertraining.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.clickertraining.com/</a> - the inventor of clicker training<br>  <br>  A great Yahoo Group devoted to Cat clicker training - some of these members have gotten thier cats to do some very amazing things.  <a href="http://pets.groups.yahoo.com/group/Cat-Clicker/">http://pets.groups.yahoo.com/group/Cat-C...</a><br>  <br>  And You tube videos of Cat clicker training in action:  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_type=&search_query=cat+clicker+training&aq=f" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/results?search_ty...</a><br>  <br>  Good luck and Enjoy!|`|6T3NcrB0aa	Absolutely!

But she won't miss a chance to sleep next to me on the bed most nights.<br>  <br>  Atticus: not sure how old he is, around 4-5 maybe. He's gray and white and we found him as a stray who hung around our house for about a week. He is very strange, clumsy, and pretty hilarious. He lives to stare at/chase Scooter around the house. He also likes back scratches.<br>  <br>  Moon: not sure how old he is either, possibly the same age as Atticus. He's all black with yellow eyes. He doesn't like attention too much (unless it's dinner time or he wants to sleep on your lap) but he's not mean either.<br>  <br>  I love them all to bits :D
3p6wp7DYaa	Try desensitizing him to the camera before you try to take his picture. Some dogs get frightened when new objects that make weird noises and emit weird lights are pointed right at their faces.<br>  <br>  Bring the camera out, let him smell it and look at it while giving him a treat for not running away. Then, after he's comfortable, turn it on and off several times in front of him while feeding him treats, repeat for the picture taking "noise," and lastly, let him get used to the flash pointed at something else before pointing it at him.|`|SKyPhcnqaa	let him sniff the camera and just leave it on the floor or where he can see it so he can get use to it being around and realise its not going to harm him.|`|9f740b1bb3de28f314371e4009f70d67aa	Maybe she hate's the camera so much?

va8xvhthaa	Syrian hamsters are the friendliest, even though I have a Robo, I used to have a Syrian, and it was my favorite. Robos are very fast, which makes it so much more harder to catch them. You shouldn't give them a piece of popcorn, but if you give them bits of a finely chopped banana, they'll stay wherever they are and start munching on it. <br>  My favorite names are:<br>  Honey<br>  Sugar<br>  Mocha <br>  Mochi<br>  Love<br>  Angel<br>  Cotton<br>  Cinnamon<br>  Daffy<br>  Rainbow<br>  Fluffy<br>  Twinkie<br>  Twinkle<br>  Cutie<br>  Syrians cost about $9.00 at PetSmart, but don't go to PetSmart to buy a hamster, nor shall you go to Petco. www.petsmartcruelty.com Even though this website is about PetSmart cruelties, Petco gets their hamsters from the same places, so it's best to adopt a hamster. The cage ranges from $17.99 to about $50.00. Go on www.petsmart.com or www.petco.com to see how much their prices are, but PetSmart is usually cheaper. Don't buy animals from PetSmart nor Petco, but you can buy their items. Good luck!|`|xyPpruSjaa	Hello!!! Right now my hamster is climbing all over me and it tickles so much (NO I'm not naked or perverted) So sorry if I spell anything wrong because my hamster is distracting me LOL<br>  <br>  Hi! You should get a syrian hamster (teddy bear, black bear, golden, honey) it is what's crawling on me right now! They are SO playful and cuddly, as dwarf hamsters are agressive and fast. Usually if you give them a treat (popcorn isn't too good for them, but banana is fine) they find a place to hide and munch on it. I have never seen syrian hamsters at petsmart. I got mine from petco and he is very active and healthy and adventurous! I have to keep pulling him down from my shoulder so that I can type, it tickles so much! Remember to look for healthy hamsters and healthy living conditions in the pet store. I highly suggest you use a glass tank to house your hamster in. They are very inexpensive and super easy to clean. 10 gallon tanks with lids included are usually $22 and 20 gallon tanks with a wire mesh lid are usually $45. Prices may vary by a dollar or 2 according to what sales are going on or where you live. Water bottles on average are $5. And Lab blocks and seed mixes are usually $5-$7. Of course you can't put an exact price on your hamster! They need a lot of activities to do and toys to play with! 150 dollars is MORE than enough for everything! Remember to buy toys!<br>  <br>  Good luck :] If anyone has any questions on hamsters, gerbils, or mice email me at averyrazno@yahoo.com|`|v3dN1sSaaa	ok i would get a syrian hamster and i would get a male as they are more friendly in my experience, i would not give a hamster popcorn but you can give them apple, banana, carrot and green vegetables but not very much because it will give them diarrhea adn they ill also have to have a supermarket food, adn you can give it whatever name you like there are lots out there.|`|269Jcwlaaa	i love Teddy Bear Hamsters (just a fancy name for long-haired syrian hamster)  They are one of the bigger hamsters and all of mine were really cute and playful.  They never bit either.  I never gave mine any popcorn or banana, but i did give them some carrots and lettuce.  They love to run and like finding ways to escape, so you have to keep your guard up.  Names just come to you once you see them.  Most hamsters cost around 7-10 dollars and i only get mine from Pet Supplies Plus, because i got one from petsmart (died from a disease it caught there) and one from Petco (same disease).  I really prefer Pet Supplies Plus.  Good cages are around 30-100 dollars, food around 10-15 dollars, water bottles only like 5 dollars.  You can also find cages that are called "starter cages" they come with food, a cage, and a water bottle (sometimes bedding too).  The only bedding you should use is Aspen. Cedar and pine bedding have chemicals in them that are harmful to small rodents.  Good luck :]|`|IM7nzdjbaa	I have a Russian Dwarf Hamster and they cost around $15-$20; I got mine at PetSmart.  If you get the cage, water bottle, food, and everything else, it will probably cost somewhere around $30-$50.<br>  <br>  Hamsters usually run around/play at at night and sleep during the day.  And yes they like to eat bananas, but only give them small chunks every now and then.  Good luck!|`|deU903Iqaa	Russian is ace :D|`|cdq7Wvd6aa	Well, i've had both syrian(or teddy bear) and dwarf hamsters. Syrians are very friendly and fluffy and come in loads of different colours. Dwarf hamsters aren't as friendly generally and have a reputation for biting, but i think they should be given the benefit of the doubt. They are cute and fun to watch, but you need to get at least two. I got my two for ten pound (yeh, i live in the uk, so i don't really know how much stuff is where you live) but in the uk, i bought quite an expensive cage, and it was thirty pounds, so i'm pretty sure you have enough. They don't eat much, so a bag of food will last ages. If you get a dwarf, a glass tank is best and they are very easy to clean, but syrians prefer comparment cages because they give them lots of room, though i compartment one is fine for dwarfs as well. If you'd like to know any more, just email me with more questions.|`|tEyobcikaa	I had a dwarf hamster, and I really loved her. She was calmer than my fancy hamster, but didn't live as long.  Try this website for hamster names. <a href="http://exoticpets.about.com/cs/namelists/a/namesham.htm." rel="nofollow">http://exoticpets.about.com/cs/namelists...</a> Think of  characters from your favorite show or book. Or, name use your hamsters looks to think of a name. Oreo for a black and white, or butterscotch for a yellow one are some examples. Both my hamsters ran around a lot, and it was hard to keep them still. The actual hamster can cost between about 7-18 dollars, depending on where you buy them. Mine were about 15 dollars each. Petsmart and Petco sell hamsters, but I prefer smaller, local stores. You'll need to buy a cage, bedding, food, food dish, and water bottle, and maybe a few chew treats. Some cages come with these, though. All this cost me around sixty dollars at first, and a bag of food (which you'll need to purchase every few months) could cost anywhere from 3-15 dollars, depending on how big, but the more expensive (and bigger) ones will last you a while. Ask the pet store about fresh fruits and veggies that are safe to feed him. This site will tell you how to take care of one. <a href="http://www.ehow.com/how_6041_care-hamster.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.ehow.com/how_6041_care-hamste...</a> Remember to hold  your hamster everyday, and keep him away from other pets that might hurt him.

DE4tVLgiaa	Do all your chores and be really responsible for a week.  Then start talking about dogs a lot.  Then ask her really really nice.  If she says no, try again, but do even more work, and make sure she knows how responsible your being.  Promise to continue being responsible after you get the dog, and take good care of it.
70878cc978ee2e4a79b3b53284340f9caa	Feed him all of his favorite things ( tiny bites so he can keep it down.) Take him to his favorite places.If there are special family members or  friends that the dog loves,ask them to come and see him.Then when it's time for the vet to give the injection,hold your dog close and tell him what a good dog he has been. Wrap him in a favorite blanket if he has one. Kiss him and pet him and just talk to him until the vet says he is gone.I even talk to mine and stroke them for several minutes after,as hearing and touch are the last senses to go. If you want to,cut off a lock of hair. If he is being cremated,you can ask that he be cremated with a toy or treat. If he's being buried,you can wrap him in a nice blanket or even make him a small casket. Place toys,photos,treats,etc.in the casket with him. You might want to bury him in a favorite sweater or an item of your clothing.These things might sound silly to someone who doesn't have pets,but they really help and give you a sense of closure. I am sorry about your dog.I have three and they are old. The youngest is 8 and the other two are 12 and 16.I have lost many old dogs and cats over the years and it always hurts.

It's Saying Goodbye to our beloved pets.<br>  <br>  Allen and Linda Anderson, authors of Angel Dogs and Angel Animals, have written a powerful and emotionally charged book, Saying Goodbye to Your Angel Animals that's full of great advice. Ironically, the book was sent to me to review for one of my blogs two days after my then 19 year old cat, Prissy, had a particularly bad stroke. She was still in really bad shape when I opened the package to reveal the particular title. While she pulled through the stroke and even celebrated her 20th birthday two months ago (!!!), at the time there was so much emotion running through my body that I threw the book in one of the bottom drawers of a dresser never used. It not only got the bottom drawer treatment - it got the bottom drawer treatment in a dresser I never think twice about!<br>  <br>  I wanted the thought, and mere suggestion, that I could possibly one day have to say goodbye to this beautiful and sweet cat as far away from me as possible. Out of respect to the authors and publisher, I could not bring myself to throw it away - which is, of course what I wanted to do.<br>  <br>  After Prissy healed - remarkably, at that - I rescued the book from its prison and decided to read it. I wanted to be able to share its wisdom and advice with people who were currently going through the hell I was so desperate to delay.<br>  <br>  Saying Goodbye to Your Angel Animals is a perfect little book, with a cover so beautiful and peaceful that you find yourself staring at the scene. This book is all about finding comfort after losing your beloved pet.. I have had varying combinations of cats, dogs, rabbits, and hamsters since I was 3. The only constant has been cats. I have always, always had at least one precious cat. Currently I have three and they make my world a much sweeter place with their presence. Since I have always been surrounded by animals, I have had my experience with the sick feeling that comes from losing one.<br>  <br>  Most pet lovers understand what you are going through when this happens, but there are some people who, while you are grieving (and yes, it is grieving) look at you as if to say, "So, get another one." While they, honestly, do not mean to be insensitive, it does hurt for someone not to understand your pain.<br>  <br>  That is one of the things I love most about Saying Goodbye to Your Angel Animals. The authors completely understand the pain - completely and totally. Their words are as comforting as a hug and their advice is right on the money. I wish I had this book during my previous pet losses, it would have been so comforting to have felt that hug!<br>  <br>  This book offers comfort for those who have lost a pet to death as well as to those who have lost a runaway or "disappearing" pet. I know, from experience, that in a lot of ways, the second category is even worse. When you just do not know - the pain is excruciating - and you find yourself, helplessly, watching for days that turn into weeks and even weeks that turn into months.<br>  <br>  Did I mention I have been there?!?!<br>  <br>  Because of my ancient little Prissy, I have to admit that I read this book with tears running down my face. I did, however, find great comfort in knowing that others have walked the path I'm currently on as well as the one that is ahead, that I still cannot bring myself to think of. This is a very helpful and important book for every pet lover to have, especially if they are no longer able to avoid this path.|`|ld2vmypNaa	..just love him and remember all the good times you had together.<br>  You don't say good-bye..you say we will meet up again one day..<br>  <br>  I love this poem.When I lost my dog end of Jan 07 someone sent me this..<br>  <br>  <br>  I stood by your bed last night, I came to have a peep.<br>  I could see that you were crying, you found it hard to sleep.<br>  I whined to you softly as you brushed away a tear,<br>  "It's me, I haven't left you, I'm well, I'm fine, I'm here."<br>  I was close to you at breakfast, I watched you pour the tea<br>  You were thinking of the many times your hands reached down to me.<br>  I was with you at my grave today, you tend it with such care.<br>  I want to re-assure you, that I'm not lying there.<br>  I walked with you towards the house as you fumbled for your key.<br>  I gently put my paw on you, I smiled and said, "It's me."<br>  You looked so very tired, and sank into a chair<br>  I tried so hard to let you know that I was standing there.<br>  It's possible for me to be so near you every day<br>  To say to you with certainty, "I never went away."<br>  You sat there very quietly, then smiled; I think you knew...<br>  In the stillness of that evening, I was very close to you.<br>  The day is over...

You will have to be content knowing that your dog has no regrets.|`|GSf09ALBaa	I say goodbye to mine by being with them when they are euthanized.  I hold their heads and stroke them.  I feel the heart and wait for the beating to stop.  It is very peaceful.  The dog just goes to sleep.  After it is done, I spend some time, not much, with the animal.  I believe that what is left is not my dog but the shell.  The spirit has gone on and is making it's way over the bridge.  <br>  <br>  I cope by knowing my precious friend is now whole again and full of life with no pain.  And knowing that when it is my time, they all will be there to greet me on the other side.
EJpiaCMQaa	Parakeets should get between 12-14 hours of sleep a night.  Make sure the cage is covered and that the room they are in is quiet.  This will help keep them in good health.|`|Gr6Xe1gGaa	Same thing as Ms. Bell said they do need 12-14 hours of sleep every night for all pet birds. Make sure they are covered and there is no light or noise. If there is light or noise that would make your parakeet not sleep well so if your bird sleeps in the living room and the light is still on or a T.V. or radio is on move your parakeet to a dark, quiet room for a good night sleep. I hope this helps.

o93EwErKaa	Hip dysplasia is so prevalent in Golden Retrievers I would want a puppy from a mom with better scores.  An average is 20 (and average scores should not even be used because of the high incidence of CHD) so she is below average and would not be a good candidate for breeding.  The father has very good scores, maybe you could inquire if there will be another breeding with the father with a different dam with lower hip scores.<br>  <br>  It really doesn't matter if you are just looking for a pet quality pup since hip dysplasia is more than just cosmetic.|`|tPGxPDvBaa	This is the OFA page which tell you what the ratings mean.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.offa.org/hipgrade.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.offa.org/hipgrade.html</a><br>  <br>  If you know the parents names, you can look them up for yourself to verify the scores.<br>  <br>  Sorry left off the score for the female is borderline & probably should not be bred esp. for goldens when they are very many to choose from  & we don't need any more risky dogs.<br>  <br>  Then I wouldn't pay for pup from parents with scores like that.  There are many more healthy others out there.|`|4b8fb7d13eab5f34e3a4f0ce4fbb2680aa	In the UK, the average mean score for the breed is 18, she's only just over that & as she has clear elbows and eyes it wouldn't worry me too much if she was an excellent ***** in every other respect. The hip scores are likely to be better than Mum's and worse than Dad's. Hip scores don't just depend on the pups' parents' scores but on their parents & grandparents too. Some dogs also consistently produce better or worse scores than their own. Deciding which dogs to breed isn't black and white and if you are buying from a reputable, knowledgeable breeder you should be guided by them.<br>  Hip status isn't only controlled by heredity - you have as much responsibility in your dog's future health by ensuring a good diet and the correct amount of exercise while the pup matures.|`|UpHzL14Faa	The higher a hip/elbow score the worse the appearance of the joint. The BVA guidelines for breeding animals with hip/elbow scores is to only breed from animals whose hip/elbow score is well below (ie better than) the average for the breed so as to try and bring the breed average down. The average hip score for a golden retriever is 18, so the mum should definitely not be bred from. The dad is fine.<br>  <br>  There is a definite genetic component to hip and elbow dysplasia, however the hip/elbow score of a puppy cannot be accurately predicted from the parents' scores, only estimated. Think of the scores as probabilities as to the score of the puppy ie a higher scoring adult is more likely to breed a higher-scoring puppy. Not only will puppies from lower-scoring parents be worth more, it is essential to responsible breeding to consider the hip/elbow scores when choosing parents to breed from.<br>  <br>  Advice on the scoring shemes can be found on the BVA website:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.bva.co.uk/canine_health_schemes/Hip_Scheme.aspx" rel="nofollow">http://www.bva.co.uk/canine_health_schem...</a><br>  <br>  Breed averages can be found here:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.bva.co.uk/public/documents/CHS_Hip_Scheme_Breed_Mean_Scores.pdf" rel="nofollow">http://www.bva.co.uk/public/documents/CH...</a>|`|32YfE5Whaa	yes its not good at all that female shouldn't be bred at all both parents have to have good scores in order to breed!what ever you do dont breed her it would be the worst mistake ever
3zv2bbolaa	Clean the cat box frequently so that he can't be an opportunist. <br>  <br>  Use a covered cat box to reduce access for your dog. <br>  <br>  Place the cat box behind a door with a cat sized door in it so that only the cats have access to the box.|`|SaINc1Plaa	wow... just wow|`|AoSeHXeQaa	Put the litter box in another room.  Put up a baby gate. <br>  <br>  That way the cats can reach the litter box, but the dog cannot.
1hciyvKdaa	I had the same problem too, the difference in my children was, the one who got attacked was my youngest, so she may of at one time hurt the cat, but she has ADHD. The cat was kinda iffy in personality. So I dont know if something happend I never saw, but not only our cats while she was growing up, her cat she got later on in life, that was kinda a iffy cat, not always in a good mood also disliked her.
bepZupAfaa	biting your toes is a normal thing for a ferret. they have a foot fetish especially if you are wearing white socks. wearing colored socks helps some but it doesn't always work.<br>  <br>  since your little girl is only about 3-4 months old and am going to take it for granted she is the only ferret you have. she is wanting attention. in fact if you wanted to make this a game she will chase you around the house like a game of tag.<br>  <br>  i have 5 ferrets. 2 of mine will go for the feet. one is 4yrs old and the other one is about 5 months old now. bubbles (5 month old) is deaf so when all her brothers and sisters leave the room she doesn't hear them in another room she comes to where i am and goes for my toes to get me to play with her. wearing colored socks with her doesn't help so i will put my shoes back on.or i just distract her with something else. i hand wrestle with her.she loves to do that.<br>  <br>  when she goes for you feet you need not to move them around because to her you are inviting her to play with them. get her up and scruff her , hiss at her and tell her NO BITE . do this each time she goes after your feet.<br>  <br>  hope this helps and good luck|`|30eSQJE0aa	You're lucky it's only the toes - very young ferrets can be serious biters sometimes,  She'll probably grow out of it rather quickly.  You can always spray bitter apple on your toes, and the taste will discourage her from biting - it works wonders.  Otherwise you can make it a habit to walk around in house slippers until she learns better.|`|44kEtDvIaa	Natural for them to do this.  Gets your attention.  Make sure you don't start making a game of it for them.  Any reaction will get them to do it again ... but they are playful and toes and neat things for them to go after .. particularly when they jump and move each time the ferret nips at them.  Check site below for some info on this and other areas of ferret care and handling.
FewhKlx9aa	Neuter because of-Cancer<br>  territorial marking in the house<br>  Aggression<br>  <br>  Reason not to neuter- MMMMM Can't think of a one<br>  Dogs d/n change their personality that is all a Myth.For the health of the dog and because you don't want them peeing all over the house.The other thing is they are very nervous as all they want to due is run away to find the nearest female in heat.|`|gwUMipsUaa	What happens should your dog get loose?  <br>  <br>  You wouldn't cut your testicles off after you're done having kids, but you would probably have a vasectomy to avoid unwanted pregnancies.|`|0QTCiCf8aa	how can the dog be bred if it has been neutered?  that makes no sense....|`|cJxNY1Ctaa	i used to not have a very strong opinion on spaying or neutering...then i started working at a shelter. we spay/neuter everything that comes through our doors, its a requirement. purely because of the massive number of unwanted, "accidental" puppies/kittens that are put down, killed, abandoned every year. its insane, the numbers. <br>  <br>  yes neutering/spaying can also help quell some behavioral problems, but not always. my males are equally aggressive neutered as they were not neutered. so i think people who give that as their answer are spewing some bs, because that is so not always a quick fix for behavioral problems.<br>  <br>  i 100% think all animals should be spayed/neutered. the only exception being is if you are a reputable breeder.|`|KYC0pmH6aa	Your intentions NOT to neuter are good, and I agree with that. However I still feel its right to fix a dog. Expecially females, that way its a less likely chance she gets pregnant. True, a dog shouldn't be able to go anywhere. But alot of places that are public to your dog, such as dog parks, only take fixed pets. Imagine if your dog gets pregnant at the park, it's not the worst thing in the world, and you wouldn't get rid of her because of it. Then a while later, after the pups are born. She manages to escape, or somthing- she gets pregnant AGAIN. After 2 litters are born it becomes unhealthy.<br>  <br>  Changing the behavior may be a big part of fixing, but we cannot be like those PETA people. Now I'm ok with PETA, I like their view on things; but I would not be TOTALLY obsessed like they are. I mean, true, more people need to thing about the affect on dogs- but that doesn't mean we have to stop thinking about humans totally. A unfixed dog usually (expecially males) will hump anyone or thing is site. i mean its all natural, but it's not fair to your company with a dog on their leg- expecially when it starts to hurt.<br>  <br>  Also, which do you think a dog would perfer to be like...<br>  <br>  dominant, and obsessive with humping, as well as trying to run away all the time? Not to mention not exactly being able to have a decent "friend" with another dog. (on some occasions)<br>  <br>  or more calm dog who MAY still try to run away, but on some occasions not. And one who will eventually be able to be off leash romping around with friends at the beach or park.<br>  <br>  --I say "run away" because I had a stray who did this, and after he was fixed, he settled more to our house.--<br>  <br>  So it's not just taking away apart of them, but helping them have a better life. It's like us humans getting a shot, we dont like it, but it helps us. Or for those who REALLY need it, humans need rehab...at first they dont like it, but it changes their life.|`|VaYjl71Laa	You do realize that neutered dogs cannot breed right?  <br>  <br>  Yeah neutering is lame... I'd much rather come home seeing my house empty with a broken window and realizing that dog laying in the middle of the street was mine.<br>  <br>  It decreases the desire to wander, it decreases cancer, and it keeps the testosterone from pumping through the dog.  <br>  <br>  You can't humanize dogs, they won't miss their testicles.|`|pd5rERcfaa	It is healthier for your dog, prevents agressive and territorial behaviors, and most importantly guards against accidental puppies.  Millions of dogs are killed every year because people don't have their pets altered.  Until there are enough homes for all the puppies that need forever loving families, everyone should neuter and spay their pets.<br>  <br>  Also, neutering doesn't really change your dog into a cat.  It'll still act like a dog, just a calmer and more balanced dog.  An intact male dog who is not allowed to breed becomes frustrated, and frustation easily turns into agression.  Neutering is respsonsible, kind, and one of the best things we can do for our pets.|`|AA12126470	Neutering does remove the desire to procreate and can make the dog more focused on training or what ever the owner is doing with the dog. <br>  If your dog is unaltered and you are out hunting (for example) and there is a female in or coming into season your intact male is not going to be hunting anything other than the female dog. Having him altered would make him more focused on hunting and less likey to be looking for love. <br>  It does not change many behaviors. <br>  It does not change basic temperament or protectiveness. It does not make the dog fat. It does not make the dog lazy. It does not make the dog frustrated. In fact it does lessen that because the dog does not have the hormone driven behaviors.<br>  It can lessen the risk of prostate issues and some cancers. <br>  It is the responsible thing to do.<br>  And most of all there are many dogs who should never be bred because they have genetic or other imperfections that should not be passed on to future dogs.|`|Cfk1kr8Daa	With all due respect, you do understand that a neutered dog can no longer reproduce, right?<br>  <br>   Acquired traits, like removal of body parts, is never passed on genetically.  The genes are not changed, just the part of the bdy that formed at their direction.  Otherwise, Doberman Pinschers would all be born with docked tails and cropped ears.<br>  <br>   Neutering does not always change the personality  of a dog, but it does stop the production of unwanted litters so they don't arrive on earth only to be euthanized.  If you don't understand that part, there's nothing more I could possibly explain. Sigh...stupid people shouldn't breed, in all sense of that statement.|`|BWZ6pBoHaa	Let's see, perhaps it would decrease the chance of testicular cancer, and the chance of your dog being responsible for siring more unwanted pups?|`|EZLuVfKoaa	Shelters are full of unwanted pets because of people that think like you.|`|AA10500537	you should rephrase this question, sorry
GOypfDoqaa	Pigmy leaf chameleon.|`|7be42b69f2b9dd61df940310f2d2e055aa	I have owned Jacksons, Veiled, and Panther Chameleons for over a decade now, and Panthers are the easiest. If you read and understand the care for these animals, they can all be relatively easy to take care of. Panthers are by far the most hearty and docile. They will allow handling better, and I have yet to have one stop eating. Go to screameleons.com and sign up for their 5 day email lesson plan on the care, and then read up on all the care sheets you can. Find a breeder and talk to them and then you should be ready for the real deal. Do not get one because they look cool, but be prepared for constant maintenance of both the animal and its surroundings. Good Luck.|`|uxXLND0Laa	I would look into getting a Veiled Chameleon, Jacksons Chameleon, or possibly even a Panther Chameleon (if you have more cash and more experience with herps). The Veiled will be the cheapest, then the Jacksons, and Panther chameleons are usually a decent amount more then the other 2. All of these are pretty easy to keep, as they really don't need cooler temps or higher humidity. They are pretty tough for chameleons, so they can usually handle some mistakes by the new keeper. I would look into the specifics of these 3 animals, see which will fit you and where you will keep them... then go from there.Whatever you decide to get make sure you get a captive bred animal.
MKuDawP7aa	You have just brought the newest member of your family home, which is a cute adorable puppy, and now the fun begins. Now you are the loving caretaker of this tiny puppy and part of your responsibilities is to make sure your puppy becomes housebroken.  You may think that this will be a long-drawn out process but actually it may not be hard as you think.<br>  <br>  You should always have your new puppy seen by a veterinarian before you set up your housebreaking schedule. They can guide you on when your type of breed of dog needs to be fed and how many times a day. They will also be able to tell you if your pup is healthy and ready to be housebroken.  <br>  <br>  The most important thing is to establish is a routine. A routine will reduce the amount of accidents and will also let you and your pup knows when it's time to go outside. There is a general rule that says: for every month a puppy is old, it can wait one hour to go outside. This means that if your puppy is three months old, he should be able to wait three hours before having to go outside.   That is only a general guideline though and all puppies are different. For the first couple of days you should try to take him or her out every two hours. If you set up a regular schedule and follow some of the tips described below; your new puppy will be housebroken in no time.   Watch for the signs that your pup needs to go outside and relieve themselves. Observe the puppy's behavior and actions and soon you will be able to tell when they need to go to the bathroom. Some of the signs to watch for are: the pup is sniffing at the door, turning in circles while sniffing, and scratching, standing or barking at the door. These are all signs that they are looking for a place to do their business.<br>  <br>    You should always take your new puppy outside the first thing in the morning before anything else and it should also be the last thing you do before you retire to bed. Most young puppies are not able to go all night without having to go to the bathroom. While they are in the toilet training process you should have a small room or area which they can sleep and be contained when you are not there or at night when you are asleep.   Make sure that it is a place that you can clean up easily, such as a tiled bathroom floor. You can lay down newspaper or purchase special puppy pads which are absorbent. Never scold or hit your puppy when they have an accident. When they go outside and relieve themselves make sure you praise them and tell them what a good puppy they are.   You should also try to remember never to leave your pup unattended in the house or outside. If the pup can't be under your watchful eyes they should be contained in their designated room or penned up in an outside area.<br>  <br>  Any place in your home that your pup has messed in needs to be thoroughly cleaned. You should use something that will take away the odour. Dogs and puppies will usually mess again in an area if they can smell the lingering odour of their last accident.   Try to set up a regular feeding schedule and take away any food or water about two hours before putting them to bed for the night. This will decrease accidents and make it easier for the pup to last through the night. Always take the pup outside after they have finished eating.<br>  <br>  Another way that people have found to train their puppy to be housebroken is to use a method called "crate training". To use this method you would put your pup in a dog crate or dog kennel which is especially made for animals. You would put the pup in their crate at night and when you were going to be away for a short period of time.   Most dogs won't mess in the area where they sleep and the crate gives them the feeling of being in a small cave or home. Using a crate is a good way to help your new pup to become housebroken. Dogs and puppies usually like crates because it gives them a special place to be alone and feel secure. <br>  <br>    Remember to have some patience and understanding. The newest member of your family is just learning all the rules and wants to please you more than anything. If you set up a routine and a regular feeding time everything will run smoother and the pup will understand and quickly become housebroken. Soon all the extra time and effort used to help your pup become housebroken will pay off and you will have many years ahead of you to enjoy their company.
Apisf1gAaa	Throw it away.  Painted shells (as I've mentioned in another question you asked) aren't good.  And like Rawshark said, they'll just nibble on it if it sits in the tank.<br>  <br>  If you're short on shells (you need AT LEAST 3 per crab), go to a place like Michael's (or any craft store), Wal-Mart, or Bed Bath and Beyond and ask them for a bag of shells.  They sell large bags for cheap.  And they're all natural.|`|WmgOgA4vaa	You should take it out of the cage so it wont change back into it. He changed from it because it was too small, you dont want him to go back to it.<br>  <br>  If you have some smaller ones that the shell will be an upgrade for then keep it in the cage if not, toss it.|`|OAzJPUkHaa	Do take the shell out.  Even if the crabs don't change into it, they nibble on everything in the tank and paint isn't healthy for them.|`|r0u26SYGaa	throw it out! paint kills hermit crabs and painted shells do too!|`|MhW3pLhLaa	No, you can definitely keep it. Hermit Crabs can change into a painted shell or a natural shell. But, you need to clean the shell by putting it in boiling water for a while and then it is okay to put it back in. :)
jLM4Yo32aa	No they dont. There similar though, very similar...
pvm8wo9Waa	I like the suggestion of riding him with other horse/s.  I would also try to find somewhere you can ride him for practice where you have enough room to either move him well away from the other horse safely or they have room to move away from you and then just ignore his behavior as they pass.  Get him busy doing something else like trotting in small circles. Do this at a long distance from another rider frst and gradually go closer as he ignores them. I would also try to set this up where you had another rider arrange to pass you numerous times and places while out riding.  <br>  <br>  Another thing; it seems to me like he already wants to go with another horse, so if you start only riding with others, he may become very difficult to ride alone (herd bound or buddy sour). So I would also keep taking him out by himself (although it is of course not as safe as riding with others).  <br>  <br>  He may be bored or energetic so I'd also give him more work and more to think about while working to keep both his mind and his body busy when working him.|`|CBVHd3eHaa	he sounds to me like he is buddy sour..i'd just ask for a friend to ride along with you on a trial and have them walk farther and farther away from you every time so that he understands that he isn't going to die wihtout a herd buddy next to him.  my horse sometimes acts a little more jumpy on the trail too when we are all alone, but i have my friend come with sometimes and he's fine(even if he doesn't like the horse, a buddy will help calm them down and enjoy the ride)|`|n2dUmfcQaa	ride in a group, horses are herd animals. if you can get him to spot acting up, slowly tell the herd you are going to leave for a little bit and find a place to meet up (be in yelling dis.) this will help if he knows that he will meet up again!|`|XX03Sd0faa	Yes, take him out in company for a while to build his confidence, and then you can gradually introduce hacking out on your own again, once he's stopped misbehaving. <br>  <br>  An idea might also be to try a saddle on him, as riding bareback can make them sore, since there is much more impact with the horse, especially on it's spine. This is why saddles have gullets - the saddle is built for the horse's benefit, not the riders.|`|iRL3eULWaa	rite this happened to 1 of our horses, get the saddle checked out, because after a while the saddle will change shape, and the horse mite not like this and will get jumpy when it is uncomfortable, and when he sees other horses relaxed or their he mite get exited and wen he moves a certain bit it will hurt! my sis is a vet...<br>  trust me!!!!!!!!:)|`|OUhsp9iAaa	Take him out in company rather than on his own.    It is much safer to ride in company anyway especially if your horse is young or nervy.  You may find as his confidence on the roads builds again in company that he becomes fine to ride on his own.|`|AA11600186	Sounds like you're on the right track... just work more and hopefully it will work out.<br>  <br>  The only advice I can think to offer is to make sure YOU aren't the one getting up tight about horses passing or about potential scary spots on hacks.  I had a huge draft cross mare I used to ride, and she was young and sometimes spooky - she spooked out of the "spooky corner" so hard one day that I pulled a muscle staying on haha.  That's where our downhill battle started.  Even on a good day, she was "more jumpy than usual", and it took a few weeks to realize that I was staring down the scary stuff.  Every time we approached something "scary", no matter how much I relaxed my body, checked my breathing, etc, I was staring at it really hard.  So of course, the mare was picking up on this and spooking more because of it.<br>  <br>  So just check yourself, all of what you are doing, in scary situations.  I was certain to not "act nervous" about scary stuff for the sake of the horse, but I did not even know I was staring at stuff.  <br>  <br>  good luck.

SzW9GmRsaa	Mary, Mary, Mary...<br>  <br>  It's not all about the height, even in America. I think you need to go back to the beginning and work on your position and self esteem.<br>  <br>  I am certain you can be a good rider with the right instruction - but it's not all about how huge the jumps are, and the quicker you realise that the quicker you can start to improve on all levels.

The judge may have said that because you may be harming your horses mouth or otherwise causing problems with poor position.  Mind you the judge didn't say "you can't jump that" he said you needed to work on doing it RIGHT.  people do a lot wrong with horses, you should make it your duty to make sure you do what's good for your horse.|`|UFhrD7DWaa	you most likely have no idea what the freak your talking about judging by this question.

A five year old could not jump 3'5", considering jumps aren't put at 3'5" anyway. <br>  2. Ditto to the 4'7" - not a height jumps are put at, it's either x', x'3", x'6", or x'9". <br>  3. You think height is everything. Big reason why you should rethink how you 'jump' right there.|`|DesVTR26aa	If you can jump 5ft 3 then you should have worked at one point in time with an instructor and if you don't know what your doing wrong then go back to the beginning. And judges don't usually criticize out loud...you just get a reduced score. and it's not all about height hun|`|9kUFMMDeaa	hight means nothing <br>  <br>  if u are jumping that high u would have a proff trainer and a proff horse <br>  <br>  sounds like to me that u need to go back to canter polls and X's to work on ur position and maybe switch trainers cause ur is doing nothing for u apparently|`|WlCvwBFLaa	Maybe if you can post some pictures of you jumping we could help you and critique those pictures.|`|7xOhg2F7aa	Well, just because you can get over it, doesn't mean you have a great position, no offence. I know i used to be bad at jumping but my horse never let me down or knocked a pole. Not that you suck! Maybe just watch a few videos, take some jumping lessons, read or research it. As all horse people know, no one is ever done learning, not even Olympians. They still have lessons!
MKuDawP7aa	Bulldog<br>  <br>  This is a commonly misunderstood dog. Although its name and appearance (and those cartoons that depict fierce bulldogs) suggest that it is not-so-friendly, it is generally friendly and docile. Due to this nature, they get along well with children and other dogs. They love attention and are really loyal creatures. They can also be easily trained. They need daily exercise and overweight bulldogs can lead to health problems related to the heart and lungs. Interestingly, it was used in the 1600s for bullbaiting, but has since lost its aggressiveness after the sport was outlawed.<br>  <br>  Dalmatian<br>  <br>  This is probably one of the most filmed breed (think 101 and you get what I mean) and you cannot miss it with its trademark white coat with black spots. It is believed to be one of the oldest breed around and they are generally free from illness. They usually get sick with old age. Note that Dalmatians are dogs with lots of energy and they require frequent exercise. You should not buy a Dalmatian if you do not have the time to take care of it.<br>  <br>  Siberian Husky<br>  <br>  Originated from Siberia, it has a thick-furry coat and tail. It looks very much like its ancestor, the wolf. They are known to howl rather than bark. Because of their intuitive hunting nature, they make good hunting dogs. They are also stubborn creatures and proper obedience training is needed. Siberian Huskies are very intelligent and are therefore popular with dog shows. They are also used in sled dog racing because of their high level of fitness.<br>  <br>  Australian Shepherd<br>  <br>  It was not originated from Australia as its name suggests, but was brought up on ranches in the United States. It is a popular herding dog, but has slowly made its way into homes due to its obedience and eagerness to please its owners. It is usually a sweet and affectionate dog which is faithful to its owners and is great with children. There are, noticeably, two distinct types of personalities. One is an energetic dog that requires frequent exercise and enjoys doing tricks, while the other enjoys being a couch potato. Due to their herding nature, they bark warnings when they notice anything unusual. Intelligent and good with tricks, they make good pets.<br>  <br>  Poodle<br>  <br>  They are considered one of the most intelligent breeds of dog. They can be easily recognised with very short hair around the body, except for the head, legs and tail (Google for the pictures). Owners can choose to groom their own poodles in any way they like, but I think they look funny though. Poodles are known to be active. They can get bored easily and have been known to create bad mischief. In general, they are eager to please and are easy to train. They make good pets for those families with children.|`|pMMcEvFsaa	Border Collies are intelligent and make good companions<br>  Shelties are also great dogs, except their herding instincts can be stressful<br>  Also, look into Australian Cattle Dog...cute cute cute ???|`|2S0BkT7oaa	Try looking in your local shelter|`|TWsxP46Qaa	cross bred or mongrels make fantastic pets,judge a young dog by the size of his paws in relation to his body size if they look too big he will grow to suit,as for pure bred dogs,you can fall into the pit of vet bills for certain breeds,i always recommend getting a cross from a shelter if anyone asks me,they are just as smart and affectionate as any purebred and less likely to have genetic diseases or problems|`|xU8PhgSIaa	The best dog I can recommend is a Sheltie. We've had one for 8 years. She is the BEST around children, is very loyal and obedient. The are easy to train and have a good nature. They are very gentle. We have never had her snap at anyone. It does depend on how you raise them, also. Train them well, treat them right, and you will not be disappointed with a Sheltie as a family pet.|`|6SeWCfUfaa	I think one of the most friendly and precious and fun loving medium size breeds ever is the Brittany Spaniel.  They're high energy dogs so they need to be active, but they're smart, trainable and so much fun.  And they're not going to get as big as a lab or something like that.|`|DE4tVLgiaa	I would not recommen getting a bulldog because they are really expensive and have health problems.  I'm not sure what you mean by medium sized, but beagles and boston terriors are really nice dogs.  My neighbors have a really friendly schnauzer.  Most medium sized dogs are mutts, so try looking at your local animal shelter.|`|rXgMY4AIaa	I say border collies. They are hyper but i love them. Go to the pound and get an adult dog because they dont have much of a chance to get out. And you will already know their size before you get them. Mix breeds are the nicest and very healthy.|`|rJH9ZCT9aa	Bichon Frieze.  they are the perfect lap dogs.  They are small but not too small.  just the right size.  I have one named Chloee Beth.  she is great!|`|NjiM9hQaaa	Any dog Really. But i prefer shelties! there smart and cute too! LOOK AT YOUR LOCAL SHELTER AND SAVE A LIFE!

yUkFvtudaa	They might not.  My 2 males only go half way, but my female's stand up straight.  Her's started when she was a few months.  Males are 3 and 8 months, so they never will.|`|gwUMipsUaa	Perhaps she's mixed with something else.  This is common for pet stores to sell mix breed dogs as purebreds.|`|lTsDwY9Paa	Her ears should have been up at 8 or 9 weeks. Some Bostons' ears never stand up and some only do partially.
CvIWAjaNaa	sorry that is too confusing for me! <br>  try using like, oh what are they called!<br>  cooking tongs or something and gently move the egg below a sun lamp if you have one. <br>  that's all i got.<br>  hope it helps.<br>  :)|`|80KFJGMZaa	The bird probably died because it went in her territory, so maybe she attacked it. As for getting it out, take a pair of long pliers,scissors, anything you can grab something with from a distance and pull it out using that.|`|54UnlRQnaa	Try this: When the female bird comes out to eat, take her and put her in a different cage, take out the dead bird, and then you can put the female back with the egg.|`|Gr6Xe1gGaa	Apparently, that bird might be dead because the female hurt it hard because it got too close to her and her egg. I hope that dead parakeet isn't her mate or she would have a hard time caring for the egg. Try geeting something long to remove that bird. I think you should take to a vet or breeder for more help my parakeets had never laid eggs.|`|AA11677351	talk about confusing<br>  anyway i don't think the female will die<br>  some birds do that<br>  they stay on the eggs to protect them and don't move off for a long time<br>  although this bird is big, the cassaray ( not sure how to spell it ) does the same<br>  and it survives just fine!<br>  hope that helps|`|rvyvF3KAaa	Maybe the two males fought to the death to see who would be able to mate with the female.|`|FzFMoeSkaa	so wait ur saying u have 1 neset box to 10  parakeets omg thats bad if you have. and that bird thats dead was most likely killed by the hen with the egg because of its trespassing or the dead bird couldve laid the egg but the other hen decided to take it. anythings possible. the male is likely to feed the hen easily. <br>  you need to get that dead bird oout asap cause leaving it there is disgusting and not very hygienic. i advise you to put the birds in breeding cages rather than them breeding together in a aviary
VDP3pNCPaa	You have a turbocharged youngster.  He is asserting that he wants to be the alpha cat in the household.  He has a couple more months of rapid growth, and it will level off.<br>  <br>  You want to escalate the unpleasantness for his misbehavior.  You are giving him a time out, but a whole room is not unpleasant.  But carrying him to a small dark closet while saying NO!, and putting him in it for a time out is not real pleasant.<br>  <br>  You can try clipping off the needle like points of his claws.  If you can get a few at a time, that will help you greatly.<br>  <br>  For his water bowl, you may want to switch to a shallow glass baking dish.  It is heavy, and not easily tipped.<br>  <br>  For furniture scratching, does he have access to those inexpensive cardboard scratchers?  Those are almost universally liked, and used rather than the furniture.  Some cats don't like vertical scratching posts.  You may be wondering what is so special about vertical furniture surfaces, but this is using logic, and he is a cat.|`|EaeEVGZyaa	Has Kiwi (cute name) been neutered? If not, schedule his surgery now.<br>  <br>  Was Kiwi feral when you got him? Has anything changed in the household recently, like you working more hours or playing less with him?<br>  <br>  If his rambunctiousness occurs before and after meals, then you will need to feed him apart from the others in an area that limits his bad behaviors, but has plenty of toys. Leave him there 1/2 hour after a meal. By then he should be calmer.  Every morning I have to play with our 18 month old male, Maui, right after breakfast. I consider it my aerobic exercise for the day. All it takes is 15-20 minutes of varied play that involves chasing, killing a toy on a ribbon, and running up and down the stairs. Then our 12-year-old cat has a fighting chance.<br>  <br>  I also use a time out, shutting him in the basement for 10-15 minutes when he's been bad. "Go to your basement!" is the toddler equivalent of "time out." I always set a timer so I don't forget him.<br>  <br>  You can try loud noises to distract him when he's naughty. I used two metal pot lids like cymbals to condition my female from chewing the Xmas tree lights. It worked, but I had a lot of ringing in my ears! ;^}<br>  <br>  Try some of the behavioral sites for more ideas. He needs to learn now, before he becomes set in his ways.

AA11104893	Advantix or frontline need to be applied every 3 months (if you don't bathe your dog very often. If you bathe it with shampoo, it washes off much quicker.)<br>  <br>  It works fine for mine.|`|gwUMipsUaa	Nah.  Of all five dogs over the period of 15 or so years, I have only found a whole TWO ticks.  Never had a problem with fleas.|`|iVQULHqYaa	I have had dogs for over forty years and none of them have ever had fleas. I have never treated any of my dogs with conventional flea preventative treatments because they contain harsh chemicals . <br>  Vets and the manufactures of flea  treatments will tell you that they are vital, simply because they make a profit. All of my dogs have mixed freely with other dogs and I do take precautions.<br>  There are lots of treatments for killing and preventing fleas, they are full of nasty chemicals and they are expensive. I make up a solution for my dogs which prevents fleas, although it is also said to kill fleas I have no experience of this because my dogs have never had fleas.<br>  At the outset it may be expensive to buy the ingredients, however they will last for years. Use a few drops of Citricidal and essential oils of Citronella, Tea Tree and Lavender. Add this to half a pint of vinegar or water and sponge a small amount onto your dog’s coat. I use this about twice a week.|`|q7i9QZg5aa	Yes, my two are on frontline. Even if they are playing in your yard then can come in with fleas and ticks. Once you get those into your house it is a pain to kill them and have them removed. Prevention is key. This also helps your pets health. Fleas can be in your yard, along with ticks. We put something on our grass that is supposed to deter them from our yard, however we have still seen them. We luckily still keep our dogs on frontline, and have never had a problem.|`|FewhKlx9aa	I d/n use the frontline as I don't like putting a poisen on my dogs.In the oast they have all had allergic reactions to it.I now buy an all natural treatment from the pet store called Natural Defense and this works great.It is all natural oils that go on 1x a month neck to tail and smells good.No poisen and No fleas or ticks.It cost $12.00 for 3 vials.I have 11 dogs and believe me it works|`|8740c9d03300d2d76f91ceaf7a9ffc93aa	Yes and the vet use the best treatment!|`|CEC87KZ7aa	Yes, i have a teacup maltese named Sophie and every month we put Frontline flea treatment on her neck.  I think that it is very necessary to do this because your dog can get fleas anytime, anywhere, and once your dog has them, they are extremeley hard to get rid of.  i know because my dog had fleas last year.|`|6SeWCfUfaa	I don't.  But I live in Colorado where fleas and ticks are not the kind of problem they are in a lot of other areas.  If my dog starts getting fleas or ticks, I'll start using a preventative.<br>  <br>  BUT ... I'm lucky.  With a lot of places, you'd just be nuts not to have your dog on advanate or frontline.|`|Cfk1kr8Daa	Not necessary?  Did you want fleas?<br>  <br>   I use Frontline monthly, as well as Preventic collars every three months to prevent the spread of fleas and ticks, as well as the diseases they carry.  I want dogs, not bugs.|`|wA1dkeWRaa	It's always a good idea to treat for fleas and ticks on a monthly basis. Both Advantage and Frontline are great products.<br>  <br>  Or you could do what I do to my dog......shave him bald.<br>  <br>  lol|`|s7VCRYofaa	We use Frontline.  You can buy it in monthly or every three months.  You can also try a flea/tick collar.  They work great and keep your puppy happy!|`|JH2P2AMsaa	..i have my dog on frontline, i think..otherwise those nasty little fleas start multiplying like crazy!|`|lTsDwY9Paa	I use Frontline monthly for fleas & ticks and Interceptor to prevent heartworms.|`|AA10500537	you should get it from your vet its safer|`|QtIpuKM3aa	my dogs are hairless so no I do not, but I recommend to my clients is Advantex, this last year we found that the fleas where still living after people used frontline and frontline plus that is including have an exterminator in to spray and flea baths for all the pets, they still had fleas after this went on for 3 months they tryed the advantax and the owners have no fleas now.|`|xe0z6zNjaa	We have her on a flea treatment during the spring/summer months.  We use the K9 Advantage (something like that) stuff.  <br>  <br>  I don't think it's necessary to have her on preventative year round when for 4 months out of the year, it's below freezing.  Just my opinion though, to each their own.|`|UiP2WBVmaa	Well, I don't use it but it is a good idea to have it. My dogs are always inside and outside during the day, but nothing has ever happened.|`|G4Lo54Miaa	frontline and/or heartguard plus. the vets sell those or you can get it at 1800petmeds.com|`|KemYbNSKaa	Yes, all 3 Poms get Front Line every month all year long.  Works great.

NlvghuIkaa	Schutzhund consists of three phases: Obedience, Tracking, and Protection<br>  <br>  Before you can start to train for Schutzhund your dog must have earned his BH title. This is basically a good citizen exam dedicate to our lovely dogs. In order to receive one your dog must behave itself around joggers, strange noises, other dogs, vehicles, and crowds of people as well as do basic obedience. <br>  <br>  Then you can train for your..<br>  Sch1- The dog must be 18 months or older. <br>  Sch2- The dog must be 19 months old and already have a Sch1<br>  Sch3 - The dog must be 20 months old and already have a Sch2<br>  <br>  Schutzhund can be as expensive as you make it. I have to admit that it is a little more pricey than your average Agility, but think about the equipment that goes into the sport. Never rush your dog through it otherwise everything will fail upon you. Training for Schutzhund can take hours out of your day. <br>  <br>  A lot of the work does depends on the dogs breeds, drives and itself. There is no point in training a Golden Retriever for protection because they don't have the right nature, nor prey drives. <a href="http://www.schutzhund-training.com/schutzhund.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.schutzhund-training.com/schut...</a>|`|pc7ZjexJaa	prices will vary<br>  <br>  I'll star for my contacts

5TM9P8tsaa	*The monkey was old and I believe had dementia. This can happen not only with people but with animals when they get old. Just like people when animals/people get dementia some get very violent. There were signs that happened before this and they ignored the signs. <br>  <br>  They could have tranquilized the animal. They could have distracted it and coaxed it off the woman with food. When it went over to the food they could have shot it with the tranquilizer. This woman was a friend of the woman who owned the monkey. She stabbed the monkey but it had no affect. The monkey and the woman who got attacked is the victims here. <br>  <br>  Monkeys this large should be in a retirement retreat somewhere to live out the life it has left and not at a zoo on display. With the dementia the zoo would be bad and would add the anger and stress of the animal. That is why there are retirement retreats set up for older animals. They retreat is in a natural setting with areas they can get out of the weather and generally in a warm climate with no bad winters such as Arizona or California.<br>  <br>  Killing the animal was a waste. It was not his fault he was old and had dementia. This comes from police staff and emergency responders not trained in the area of how to handle wild animals that have problems. Had someone been trained they would have know exactly how to handle the situation.|`|Bw18seFqaa	I think that's why people shouldnt own wild animals as pets.<br>  <br>  Monkies and Apes belong in the wild, or at a zoo with trained handlers...  not in people's homes.  Primates can be very aggressive.|`|XI2iylR4aa	The victim had extensive injuries to her eyes, nose, jaw, and hands.  She is lucky to have survived the attack.<br>  <br>  The chimp was shot and killed by the police.<br>  <br>  It just illustrates that chimps and other primates should not be kept in a person's home.  They might be sweet and docile for years, but they are still wild animals. <br>  <br>  The whole thing is tragic.|`|pDSde3qdaa	It's horrible...  The chimp should have never been in a cage in someone's home.  I agree this is why wild animals shouldn't be someone's pet.  Then the woman gave the chimp Xanax which could have been part of the problem as well.  Then after she told Today Show that she later stated that she never gave the chimp anything.  This story just sucks all the way around.|`|x1KRxDuGaa	I think that it is horrible. For everyone. The monkey, the victim and the owner. I can't believe that the animal was shot to death. That is really sad. But I don't think that people should own wild animals, especially older people, because they aren't as strong and as able to control it. I hope the victim gets better.
e9d71d6161e9651bff732ca0ddde54c8aa	You could try "The Canny Collar"  its like a normal collar and then it has a strap that goes round the collar and over the dogs muzzle ! It really does work, its not a muzzle and it won't stop the dog from biting, but it will stop the dog from pulling !!  "The Halti Collar" works well also.<br>  <br>  Invest in one or both of these and then use whichever one you like best, you and dog will then be able to ENJOY your walks !!! Nothing worse than a dog taking the owner for a pull !!!!<br>  <br>  Best of luck.|`|2GhwuXksaa	Have you tried a haltie? (think that's hw its spelt). We had one for ur german Shepherd. its a fabric device that fits over the nose and under the chin where you attach the lead. When the dg pulls, they are pulled back by their nose, they quickly learn its not acceptable. It doesn't hurt then just reminds them its wrong to pull. They are available from most pet shops.<br>  <br>  Good luck|`|wGOtDZ0Uaa	I totally agree with the Halti, it is so much kinder than pulling a dog <br>  about on a choke chain, kinder on your arms aswell, but  I would<br>  just say if you get a Halti buy a keeper to go with it, it just attaches<br>  on the nose ring and clips onto the collar, I only mention this as I<br>  did see a dog reverse rather quickly and managed to slip his halti,<br>  had there have been a keeper used the dog wouldn't  have been able<br>  to do a runner.|`|wtNeMFR8aa	Try a loud whistle, blow it when the dog pulls and stop walking.
wKCgaoZVaa	Its great that your helping out, so I'd offer to help out and do the stables daily, and if you leave then its time to report them mate - you have to think of the horse, even if they're treated well otherwise.

Good luck =)|`|n2dUmfcQaa	1) breaking a horse is a great way to build confidence for horse and rider.<br>  2) most people break at 2-3 but how ever (i think it is better to break at age four, there bones are stronger)<br>  3)same as answer 2<br>  4)if you get a foal you can watch it grow, plus you can train it the way you want to,(instead of getting someone else headache's)<br>  5) when they are first born yes, if they are like 4 months on not so much<br>  <br>   hope this helps!|`|5kUxkun3aa	Sounds like you are getting a head of yourself.|`|zMXDolD9aa	1) They bring good companionship, and it's really the general thing to do with a domesticated horse so that they understand leadership from humans. It brings them challenges and puts them in work so they don't get bored which also keeps them fit and healthy in many circumstances. They often progress and excel in the case of top show jumpers and dressage horses.<br>  <br>  2) Horses are generally rode from the age of three and four. It usually leans towards four as horses are usually broken in and turned away at age 3. <br>  <br>  3) Breaking in varies. Thoroughbreds which are to be used for racing often get broken in at 2 years old so they are fresh and young to race. This isn't always good as it can cause problems later on as they aren't fully developed. On the other hand, horses which are left later on to be broken in - e.g. 6 and 7 - can be difficult to handle as they aren't used to the idea of human leadership and handling.<br>  <br>  4) If you take on a foal then you can start their training from scratch. You can decide the discipline and the way they learn: whether its natural horsemanship or just conventional breaking/starting. This also allows you to eliminate bad habbits when they are young, and you can form a good bond and friendship which may not be necessarily there or be as strong when the horse is older or had a lot of owners. The other side of this is that foals are a lot of work, and you have to wait a good few years until they can be saddled or put into work. You have to be dedicated and commited to the foal and get them used to things. The way they are in the future is affected by the way they were treated as a foal with regards to desensitising them to certain things, like carrier bags, other animals etc.<br>  <br>  5) I wouldn't say they are significantly more prone to illness than other horses but, of course, like children and old people, they do have a somewhat higher chance. This is because their immune system isnt as strong as an older horse, they haven't had as much time to develop it. They aren't able to fight off disease as well.<br>  <br>  Whether or not these foals have a big paddock to run around in, it doesn't make a difference if they aren't in it. A dirty, unkempt stable is a breeding ground for disease. They need a great amount of care as a youngster as horses such as these can often turn into problem horses or "green" projects if training isn't gone about in the right way. Good luck with them and with the owner!|`|36612d416e7176f5335f2b3fb47cf46caa	If you have to ask how old they need to be before you can ride them you don't have enough experience to start them off. At that age and stage it is very easy to ruin them for life.<br>  <br>  They need to be at least 3 years old before you can lunge or sit on them but the training should start when they are only a few days old - you teach them to lead, pick out feet etc.|`|9kUFMMDeaa	a benifit to a foal is you get it from day 1 so it learns all the cues that u use and will not pick up bad habits fomr other riders but it will from you <br>  <br>  normally thye train horses at a year and a half but b4 that they train them to walk on a lead line and to trot around and lunge normally ppl don't jump horses till they are 3 because of bone growth|`|iRL3eULWaa	ok i think you should get a trained breaker person who will teach wat to do for 1 foal then you can pick it up on he second and gradually build up, that's what i did!:) hope this helps!|`|BGyxjekKaa	If you have ALOT of time on your hands to spend with them daily to gradually back them and have help on the ground for when they are to be backed then go for it :)|`|2qREaMmraa	1) What are the benefits of breaking a horse in?<br>  A)The benefits are that it is so much more like an achievement when they are fully broken, and if you compete on them, then you feel so happy because of how far you went with them. They also trust you more because you were the one that broke them in, not just some random person.<br>  2)How old do they have to be to be ridden? About 2 or 3 I think<br>  3)How old do they have to be to be trained or broke? Same probably.<br>  4)What good about taking on a foal instead of a horse?They will know you from when they were small so they will know you more and trust you when they're older.<br>  5)Are foals prone to getting ill rather than other horses? Yeah they are and old horses too because their immune systems aren't as developed.|`|7xOhg2F7aa	1.) The benefits to breaking your own horse is that you know exactly how it was trained, and where its bad/odd or good behavior comes from<br>  2.) Most horses are ridden at around three. However, racehorses are usually ridden and raced at age 2, and Lippazaners aren't traditionaly ridden till they are 6.<br>  3.)You can start training at any age (groundwork that is) but they are broke at the same time as they are ridden (same thing then as question 2)<br>  4. The great thing about raising a foal from an early age is that it is easier to grow a bond with them and way easier to train and break if they are starting training early (being around people, desensitizing)<br>  5.) Yes, foals are much more prone to getting sick because they still have a weak immune sytem. But don't let this discourage you, as long as they are kept fed and watered, have clean and safe areas to play, and they have adequite shelter, you shouldn't have to worry. <br>  <br>  Hope this helped!|`|OUhsp9iAaa	1. Breaking the horse in allows it to be ridden (or if to carriage to be driven) and is a long process.  It should only be undertaken by very experienced people who are used to handling young horses.  The rider needs to be very balanced as well as understanding and calm.<br>  <br>  2. They need to be 3 years old before they are ridden and then at first it will only be very gently.<br>  <br>  3. They can start to be led in halter and basic handling as soon as they are separated from their mums but as above you wouldn't start breaking them until 3.<br>  <br>  4. You can ensure that they are bought up the way you want and you will know much more about their history.  <br>  <br>  5. Yes, as they are not fully mature their immune systems are not as strong.  <br>  <br>  From your questions you do not seem to have experience with young horses so I would say that you would need to be handling these foals under the direction of someone who is used to handling and training young horses.  This is important not just to minimise the mistakes made with the horses but for your own safety as they are generally even more unpredictable than older horses.|`|Czh1fbQgaa	The benefits of breaking a horse are obvious. You can ride them. Horses are no fun as pasture ornaments.<br>  Begin training ASAP get a good horse training book or find an experienced person to do it, you don't sound like you know much about training. Begin backing at 2 1/2 to 3 years old and actually riding at 3 1/2 (or a little later depending on progress)<br>  The cool thing about getting a foal is that they bond to you and you can train them how you want.<br>  Foals are no more prone to getting sick than any other horses. Just make sure they get vaccinations and stuff.|`|vfhKkiSKaa	If you don't know what you are doing and haven't worked with a someone who know what they are doing to learn from:<br>  <br>  1. There are none.  If you don't know what you are doing you have a 99% chance of screwing up the animal for the rest of it's life.<br>  <br>  2.  I wouldn't ride a horse until it was 4 (some start sooner, but I prefer to let a horse be a horse before you start riding it, it allows the horse to grow up and puts less stress on their bodies and I also think it is easier for them mentally.)  This does not mean I would not handle the horse daily and begin teaching it manners.  This should be done when they are very young.  Before you begin to work with them they should be able to be led around, pick up their feet, stand for a grooming, etc.<br>  <br>  3. I would start working with them a 3.  Start by doing a little ground work, and lunging and increase the frequency as they get older.  I would saddle break them right before they turn 4.<br>  <br>  4. Not much.  If you have never done it before it is a bad idea.  I would only start with a foal if you have years of experience or a trainer that can help you (who also has had years of experience).  There is no great benefit from starting a foal.  The whole concept of you "growing up together" is total bs.  You can have the same bond with a horse you get when he is 18 as with a horse you have broken in.  It is just like people.  Some get along better than others.<br>  <br>  5. If properly taken care of (an this is only doable if you again have years of experience and know what you are doing) they will not have any more issues than an adult.  But if you don't know what you are doing the chances of them getting sick is greater.<br>  <br>  Just by you asking these question I know you don't have the experience to own, train or properly care for a foal.  I would go with an older, trained, experienced horse and you will end up with a companion you will love for life.

6SeWCfUfaa	Sometimes you have to put your family in front of a dog.  I'm like you, I views dogs as a lifetime responsibility, but putting your dog in front of your kids and family, is a little ridiculous when you think about it.<br>  <br>  If he's a registered purebred, you can probably find a breed specif rescue.  If not, try an all breed rescue.  If anyone makes you feel guilty for taking care of your family, ask them if they really think keeping a dog is more important than feeding their kids.  <br>  <br>  Sorry to hear of your troubles and I hope things start looking better for you soon.  The economy is being hard on everyone, our pets included.|`|tB7QK6BTaa	Good bet that an hour long walk every day would satisfy the dog, would cost no extra money, would be good for you and the children and the dog.<br>  <br>  That's a real simple no cost answer which allows you to not 'backtrack' on your personal integrity.<br>  <br>  If integrity is important, then that's the kind of change you make when you realize that you are letting your dog down.<br>  <br>  If integrity is not important then you let the dog go, put it down, rehome it whatever, but nothing said here will relieve you of the personal responsibility for whatever decision you make.|`|AoSeHXeQaa	If you can find someone who will take him, or give him to a no-kill shelter, then its a possibility.  If you take him to the pound he will most likely be put down because of his age.<br>  <br>  If there is any way you can keep him, that would be the best choice. At his age such a change will be hard for him. Can your children give him attention, too?<br>  <br>  I understand that your children must come first - I once had to take two of my four dogs to a no kill shelter because I was out of work and could not afford to feed both them and my children.

Put an add in the paper or on craigs list. Most dogs that go to shelters or homes do not get a new home and are killed. Even in a shelter that refuses to put down dogs he will be stuck in a small space, He wont get as much personal attention as he needs if any at all. He will probably be terrified, and surrounded by other strange caged dogs. <br>   If you wont keep him you have to find him a new home.|`|3hBQz33Yaa	You sound like a decent caring person. Your caring and wanting whats best for your dog and you feel you can't do that. By admitting to that and wanting to give your dog the care and love he needs even if its by someone else does not make you wrong or a bad owner.

It sounds like you really care for him, and you really do want what is best.  <br>  <br>  One avenue you could look into is contacting a rescue organization (there are organizations for both purebred and mixed breed dogs) and see talk to them about finding another home for him.  You could possibly even ask them if you could continue to keep and foster him in your home until a permanent home is found.  That way, you can also have part in the decision of his new home.  Either that or find a friend or neighbor willing to take him temporarily or permanently so he can still be in your life and you in his.<br>  <br>  Good luck in whatever you decide to do, I know it must be an extremely difficult decision.|`|KYC0pmH6aa	I think you should.<br>  You sound like a decent person, and a true dog lover to put your dogs needs first.

So what will happen to this dog that has been a part of your life for 8 years - you KNOW what the answer to that is don't you.<br>  <br>  If you really feel like you can't care for him - take him to the vet and put him down.  Bet ya don't like that idea do you - what do you think shelters will do with an unadoptable dog?  If that's what is going to happen to him you need to do it yourself - he deserves to have you with him when he dies.<br>  <br>  If he is whining perhaps he is ill or in pain.  I recognize that times are tough everywhere but would you turn in one of your children to a shelter - I doubt it.  I'm not one to assign human emotions to a dog but in this case he deserves better.<br>  <br>  If he is a purebred - see if there is a breed -specific rescue as that may be his only chance to stay alive.

aBwk1lsFaa	1. Get 2 female guinea pigs. 2 males will likely fight, and 2 of the opposite sex will mate. If you get one guinea pig, she/he might get lonely, depressed, etc, and die. <br>  <br>  2. Make your own cage @ <a href="http://guineapigcages.com/." rel="nofollow">http://guineapigcages.com/.</a> The pet store cages are far to small for 2 guinea pigs, and the bigger the cage is, the happier your guinea pigs will be. My cage is 4 grids by 2 (I have 2 piggies at the moment) Making your own cage will save tons of money, plus its easy and fun. <br>  <br>  3. - Shavings : Don't put in any cedar or pine shavings. They can kill. Use carefresh or aspen shavings.<br>  - HAY! : This is neccesary for their survival. Make sure you put alfalfa for babies, pregnant, and sick guinea pigs, and timothy hay for adults. (6 monthes and up)<br>  - Pellets, alfalfa based for babies, timothy based for adults.<br>  - Hidey houses .You can get them at the pet store, or make your own here: <a href="http://www.guineapigcages.com/toys.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.guineapigcages.com/toys.htm</a><br>  - Water bottle : Make sure its cleaned weekly, and that the water is changed daily.<br>  - Toys.

FQyeGsIyaa	Yes you can and points to you for wanting to take care of your cat.  Periodontal disease is very common in cats and the biggest cause of health problems for them.<br>  <br>  The key is to get the cat used to it gradually.  The link to Cornell University College of Veterinary Medicine has a video that shows the process.<br>  <br>  My 2 1/2  yr old cat had a bit of gingivitis at her last checkup.  I started using CET Rinse on a cotton swab.  She likes the taste of it.  I'm now using it on a cat toothbrush.  She didn't like the flavor of the toothpaste so I'll have to try another one.  She's finicky with her food too so this isn't a big surprise!|`|AA12308199	You can and you should!  Just don't use toothepaste.|`|cesTfRKPaa	Yes, at the petstore they have a special toothpaste or use baking soda.|`|VDP3pNCPaa	Yes, there are special toothpastes that are sold, with either tiny brushes, or even a finger tip applicator.  Often, it is enough to rub the often flavored toothpastes on their teeth, and their rough tongue will do the rest.<br>  <br>  It is often best started when your cat is young.<br>  <br>  My cats had a problem, but I couldn't even get close with several approaches, so I used C.E.T. chews, which they loved.  It is an abrasive chew with enzymes to help them, and it worked.

It's possible she's in heat, there are usually several signs. But as a PP mentioned, she should have been spayed at around 6 months which would prevent you worrying about when she's in heat.|`|b2df0927cfc00ec0b4a6f61d9c5cd6e5aa	At 2 1/2 your dog should have already been fixed, thus allowing you to not have to worry about when she comes in to heat.
DEdtNBBSaa	Yup, I bet its an abscess.  Usually caused by a bite or poke during a cat tussle.  If your cat doesn't break it open on her own when she licks it, she may need it lanced.  Usually they bust them open themselves.  Then get ready.  Its pretty smelly gross stuff and may gag you.  Use a warm, damp washcloth to clear the pus away.  Sometime cats need an antibiotic, but I really wouldn't jump on that right away.  Antibiotics just have too many negative side effects.|`|R3glUmwHaa	it could just be an abscess, try checking petplace.com, they have some really good pet health info.
PM23RDycaa	PETA - hates all pit bulls anyways so it was no surprise when they said it.

They are taught to fight, and can be dangerous to other dogs and people if they get loose. I think they should give the dogs a chance though, but since the dogs are taught to fight and attack, it will be very hard to retrain and have them live normal lives.|`|b2df0927cfc00ec0b4a6f61d9c5cd6e5aa	I hate PETA for one and have for as long as i have been speaking against BSL.

Best Friends is a wonderful Animal Shelter, they help any animals they can, and see potential in every animal. They try to help them, they don't just assume they can't be fixed. They are like best friends, especially to those poor dogs. :)<br>  <br>  <br>  Pits are amazing dogs! Just because they were bred to be fighting dogs everybody hates them, that isn't right. They have great potential, they are strong, intelligent dogs. I'm really glad some people are responsibly breeding pit bulls to bring them back as "normal" dogs. Not vicious ones!<br>  <br>  HSUS, needs help. PETA should just join up with them, and then they should burn to the ground. A lot of people think PETA is so wonderful. They aren't. PETA just wants people to have charges, they don't really "help" the animals. All they do is video tape, etc. If they don't like a certain breed or kind of animal, they won't care. All they care about is publicity and money. }:-(<br>  <br>  <br>  Hope I helped! Thank you, for adding to my list. :)|`|MLC97M1Baa	PETA is an extremist organization who takes things and blows them up.<br>  <br>  However, some of those dogs are dangerous.

Sadly, they are a danger and I have to agree with HSUS, it would be irresponsible to rehome even after intense rehab.|`|XavY3fiWaa	Are you serious?  They didn't even want to give those dogs a chance, that's mean.  I hate PETA and HSUS for saying that, they need to stop BSL.  And when i watched Animal Witness the michael vick case, i heard the lady from bad rap pit bull rescue say that someone said the pit bulls were "ticking time bombs" and "kennel trash", I didn't know she heard that from PETA and HSUS, and the lady from bad rap pit bull rescue is awesome for taking in some of those pit bulls and findind them new homes.  And pit bulls are incredible dogs i love them, and those pit bulls definitely deserved a chance, and i am glad they got new loving forever homes.  And i know they can live the rest of their lives like normal dogs, anyone that doesn't think so i don't care what they think.|`|gwUMipsUaa	My thoughts are that most people don't want Pit Bulls, and that they are hard to adopt out.  <br>  <br>  Why don't these "Best Friends" step in and save all other Pit Bulls?  I'm guessing it has to do with the fact that these were specifically Michael Vick's dogs.<br>  <br>  Edit: Yes, but why didn't they step in and save all the other Pit Bulls from this particular shelter before Michael Vick's dogs wound up there?  They deserved it just as much.  A few of Michael's dogs did have to be put down.|`|TSc8OE4vaa	I agree.  Let's say there are five dogs.  One has huge problems and it will cost $1000 to fix that dog.  The other four have minor problems and it will cost $250 to make those dogs adoptable.  You only have 1000 to spend.  Would you rather help one very troubled dog or four who only have a few problems?<br>  <br>  Money, time, and resources are not unlimited.  Unfortunately in animal rescue it is often necessary to only help the ones with the best chance and humanely euthanize the ones that will take too much time to fix.<br>  <br>  FYI, I do not usually agree with PETA and I am not a fan of theirs.
Dkb2ZR3Daa	My guess would be anywhere around 45-70 pounds(if that's what he is)-but honestly I don't see pit bull.<br>  <br>  Usually you can take the dogs weight at 4months and double it.|`|2S0BkT7oaa	I really don't see pit. Maybe a little, but all I see is Lab. Beautiful dog! Good luck!<br>  <br>  There is no standard weight since it is a mix. Im going to say around 50-60 pounds.|`|wrUsMG4Jaa	No pit bull there.<br>  <br>  You're more likely to have a Lab x Great Dane cross- just from the face.<br>  <br>  The only thing I'm 100% on is the lab mix. He's probably going to have a base weight of 30 pounds, and a excess weight of 90 pounds.|`|gd1uWdLsaa	Well, you have a beautiful mutt. i volunteered at a shelter and have seen al kinds of mutts. It looks like it may be a little long in the snout for a straight lab pitt mix, but there is no telling. i saw a german shepherd rotweiler litter that had dogs that looked almost 100% rot and other litter mates that looked almost 100% german shepherd.<br>  <br>  I does look a lot like a lab though. You can often tell how big a dog will be by it's paws.
AA11600186	I completely understand your need to make money.  Small animal vets usually have a higher salary overall than large animal vets.  Also, it's money you REALLY work for - large animal vets work long and odd hours doing stressful work in order to make that paycheck.  So my advice would be to talk to some local vets about their experiences - every person is different. <br>  <br>  As far as school goes, do your best to bring up your GPA.  From there, try to get your undergraduate degree at a school where they also have a vet school.  It's not a make or break, but schools are more likely to choose you for vet school after your undergrad if you have completed your undergrad at the same university.  Make sure you take the required science courses to go to vet school if you choose a non-science degree!<br>  <br>  Also, as far as getting into college, if your GPA is really questionable, talk to your school counselors about getting your AA from a community college (easy to get into) and after you (assumably) get good grades doing that, you should be able to transfer to a university.<br>  <br>  good luck.|`|RUzBDX6Jaa	Yes!  thats a great carrer choice!<br>  Here is the pay in alberta:<br>  In 2005, Albertans in the Veterinarians occupational group working part-time or full-time earned from $35,600 to $171,500 a year. The average salary was $75,800 a year (2005 Alberta Wage and Salary Survey). More recent data is not available.<br>  EDIT<br>  others are saying that there is more pay in small animals. You could narrrow down your vetrinary abilities to large animals (cattle, feeding animals such as dairy animals, or pigs that will later on be eaten, and horses, ect.)  The link I provided will PROBABLY help you to decide whether or not you want to be a horse vet/vet at all.  It's alot of work in high school (all the highest courses, but it'll be worth it if its something you really want to do!)|`|n2dUmfcQaa	talk to some vets around you, also you might want to look into messages, or farrier!|`|CCyB12Tbaa	I LOVE horses, but I can't imagine myself as a vet. I know you have to have a really good GPA to get into a college, plus you have to go for 8 years I think o.O<br>  <br>  I know being a vet-tech is popular but I'm not sure the pay is all that great. Good luck with whatever you decide:)|`|UFhrD7DWaa	Jockeys actually don't  make that much and aren't guaranteed an exact salary so.<br>  Large animal vets do not make that much money so I would choose another career path.|`|9kUFMMDeaa	it is a good choice but there is more money in Small animals as more people have them and you don't have to go to them they come to you, if you have a practice in a large city you will be overwhelmed by clients <br>  <br>  if you get in at a good place then there is good money Eg an Olympic vet or at a high end EC if you are doing it out of love for horses then yes it is good but if you are looking at it from a money aspect then go with small animals<br>  <br>  Edit <br>  there are tones of coreeres with horses, <br>  you could be a breeder <br>  a trainer <br>  own a EC and offer lessons and boarding <br>  be a Blacksmith <br>  or farrier <br>  saddler <br>  a groom/ stable attendant <br>  an ec for abused horses <br>  ext <br>  hope this helped|`|AA11677351	horses are great and i say <br>  go for the horse vet job i know it pays a lot coz i've seen this program a while a go and a guy who has the same job was on it and he looked pretty comfortable where he was but he did say that it's very demanding.<br>  so good luck!<br>  =P|`|haXKbqwRaa	Veterinarian school requires an high GPA. It's a fine career choice, but maybe not the one for you if your GPA is less than acceptable.
6SeWCfUfaa	If you can't train this dog, what makes you think you can train another?<br>  <br>  No, the dog is not to old to learn.  You do just do not have the experience to train him.  For this reason, I suggest taking some classes with your dog.  Basic obedience is a must, and then you can take things like clicker training, or get your dog involved with flyball or agility.  <br>  <br>  If your dad saw you taking some more responsibility like that with the dog you currently have, he might be inclinded to get you a puppy to train from the ground up.  But prove to him you can train a dog before you ask him to get you another.  Collies are smart and very trainable for most of their lives.|`|aCqSF87Raa	If dad doesn't want another dog, i'm afraid that's that. May not be what you want to hear, but that's a part of growing up: learning that we don't always get what we want.<br>  <br>  Dad is the primary caregiver and he pays the bills. Chances are he's paying for your current dog and will pay for any new dog - that may be an added expense he doesn't want right now. And who could blame him? He's paying over $1500 a month right now for general needs like the home and any vehicles, plus whatever he pays in groceries and clothing and taxes.<br>  <br>  When you have a job that brings in at least a couple hundred a week you can re-visit the option of getting a second dog that YOU can pay for. Until then, be patient and work with the one you have. It's NEVER too late to train a  dog to anything so long as you're consistent with the training and very patient.|`|7vJNHaskaa	1. It's never too late to train a dog. You shouldn't get another dog because you have no experience in training one yet. Take a class to get your dog trained and it will teach you how to do it. Then you can talk to your dad about maybe getting another dog, being as now, you can train it well.<br>  <br>  2. It's your Dad's decision because it's his house. If he says no, just accept it and wait until you move out.|`|gd1uWdLsaa	Don't give up on the dog you have now!!! He probably loves you and would love some additional attention, even if that attention is training.|`|LeXxZKiuaa	well i convinced my parents to get a dog by doing more chores around the house to show how mature i was at being an adult
LPFGUjFAaa	if you have a filter, you should be able to have 10 guppies in a 10 gallon tank.  but if you have a new tank, you should start off with two and work your way up after a week or so.  the bacteria needs time to build up in the water.  the bacteria breaks down the ammonia that the fish release.|`|asXq2cFDaa	Well, you will either have males and females(If you want babies) or all males. First, fishless cycle the tank, this is VERY important to keep your fish healthy!<br>  http://www.cichlid-fo<a href="http://www.firsttankguide.net/cycle.phprum.com/articles/fishless_cycling.php" rel="nofollow">http://www.firsttankguide.net/cycle.phpr...</a><br>  You can use fish food instead of pure ammonia to do the cycle.<br>  If you want all males go for 8, if you want males and females go for 2 males and 3 females. You ALWAYS need more males than females if you are going to keep females. This is because the males always try to mate 24/7 and it can really stress the females.<br>  Good luck with your guppies!|`|25CAIGfeaa	8|`|AA10765424	Well, guppies breed like crazy. The general rule of thumb for freshwater fish is about 1" of fish per 1 gallon of water. With that being said a small school of 8-10 guppies should do fine in your tank. But if you don't plan on having millions of them be careful because they breed like crazy. The more attractive are the male guppies and the plain looking ones are female FYI.|`|OWi8rvn6aa	well with a filter, airstone, heater and ornaments in your tank there should be enough room left for about 6 maximum <br>  <br>  the tank isn't really big enough for a large amount of fish<br>  <br>  good luck|`|B2gdBCBbaa	up to 15. And they should be all males so there will be no fighting
ZP30wbvYaa	Let me ask you a question : <br>  Is the breeder that you are planning to purchase your puggle off of, has he been tellling you that the puggle you are about to buy is purebred? Becuase if he is, you may want to reconsider buying anything from him.|`|q0vKbocHaa	a puggle is not a pruebred. It is a mutt between a Beagle and a pug. So there is no such thing as a purebred puggle.|`|342b3711423c978836fa192cef3238d8aa	Puggles are crosses.  Therefore, there's no such thing as a purebred puggle!|`|66c4680772e4326cd1f9687e39ff7f56aa	Puggles are mutts.|`|GpiRaSvPaa	There is no way you can get a purebred "Puggle" because a "Puggle" is a mixed breed to start with. It's a Pug and a Beagle mixed. These so-called "breeders" just give these mutts a fancy name and call it a "designer" breed so they can trick people into paying as much, if not more, than they would for a well bred, purebred dog that came from a reputable breeder.|`|4SQx8smEaa	Lol!!! This is just funny...first it is spelled PUREBRED...and second there is NO WAY you can purchase a PUREBRED puggle because they are mutts...meaning...two different breeds of dogs thrown together and bred to produce a mix bred dog.<br>  Do not purchase a "PUGGLE" from a so called "BREEDER" for a ridiculous amount of money...you can find the same exact mix at a local shelter or rescue who desperately needs a home.|`|AA12126470	Puggles are not purebreds.<br>  They are a mix of a pug and a beagle.<br>  They are not a recognized breed by any registration.<br>  There fore ever puggle on the planet is a mixed breed dog.|`|v0RsFaAzaa	A Puggle is a Pug and a Beagle Cross. There is no way a Puggle can be a Purebred!|`|AA10400143	Sorry. everyone is right. There is no purebred puggles since they are a cross b/w two breeds.|`|Cfk1kr8Daa	I can assure  you it isn't.<br>  <br>   Puggles aren't a breed - they are automatically M U T T S.|`|5rfnEQnGaa	you can't because they are not, and they don't even purr|`|HiLdXSb6aa	you cant its a mutt|`|EqZyhyRraa	Oh Honey...your some type of stupid.

Sorry to tell you, it is NOT a purebred and there is NO way to make sure it is, if it isn't.|`|xe0z6zNjaa	A puggle is a cross between a pug and a beagle, so any resulting offspring are crosses, not purebred.<br>  <br>  But, why would you pay a BYB money for a mutt?|`|b2df0927cfc00ec0b4a6f61d9c5cd6e5aa	A pure bred puggle?<br>  <br>  Honey the puggle is a mutt any way, there for it is not a PURE BREED. It is a mix between a pug and a Beagle. There for there is not such thing.|`|tB7QK6BTaa	You can't, because it isn't... it's a mutt.  There is no such thing as a puggle, just a fancy name for an overpriced cross... ie...Mutt.|`|WYwGrcknaa	You wanna make sure your puggle is what a PUREBRED mutt...it s is a cross between a pug an beagle and therefore not a purebred|`|Rqb9gPN5aa	Puggles are mutts!  purbread? What is that?  Do you mean pure bred?  Bread is something that we eat.|`|7vJNHaskaa	A puggle is not a breed. It's a mix between two breeds (beagle, pug) so there are no *purebred* puggles.|`|ANnz3Kpdaa	that is a designer breed a cross between a pug and poodle it is not full blood to start with|`|VkFDAQ46aa	if it is a puggle it  is not a purebred in the first place....|`|gwUMipsUaa	You will never, ever find a *purebred*(not purebread) Puggle, or any other mutt purebred.  A Puggle is a mutt.  Beagle and Pug.  Don't ever buy from someone who makes mutts.  There are plenty of Pugs, Beagles, and mixes up for adoption at <a href="http://petfinder.com/" rel="nofollow">http://petfinder.com/</a> Type in either Pug or Beagle, and they'll come up with the mixes as well at shelters in your area.<br>  <br>  See, we have what a lot of people call a Miniature Schnoodle(Schnauzer and Poodle).  He's not a purebred.  There will never be a purebred Schnoodle.  But I don't care.  He was in a rescue and we saved him from eventual execution.|`|0QTCiCf8aa	haha....are you kidding?  a puggle is a snazzy way of saying a MUTT!! there is no such thing as a pure breed "puggle".
xYsCC5UXaa	cute doesn't mean anything for health and temperament.<br>  all it means is that it's a nice piece of eye candy for you.<br>  <br>  if your mum doesn't want to get another dog, then don't get one.<br>  her house, her rules.<br>  pay more attention to the animals you already have, instead.|`|PM23RDycaa	Cute doesn't mean it will be a good pet. If your mother doesn't want another pet stop bothering her about it. Another pet is like having another child and the family finances may not be able to support that.|`|aCqSF87Raa	Depends on the family - how much time can be devoted to exercise? Training? Socialization? Grooming? How old are the youngest members? Who will do the most work for the dog? Any allergies? Any problem with shedding?<br>  <br>  Cute is the least important trait a dog should have. Your whole family should sit down and discuss what everyone - yes, everyone - wants in a dog and why they want the dog. Discuss chores, who does what, etc. Then go to www.akc.org and browse the selection of dogs OR go to a shelter (just remember that the named breed is a GUESS and may not be accurate.)|`|q0vKbocHaa	a family oriented go would be the good ol' Lab or Golden Retriever.<br>  <br>  The best kind of dog though is a rescued one.|`|Cfk1kr8Daa	Please look up the story of The Boy Who Cried Wolf.<br>   That oughtta help your argument.|`|AA10500537	sweet  sheltie would be so nice|`|jpNdMbA7aa	Try an Australian Shepard or miniature Australian Shepard.<br>  They are adorable!<br>  Or try a Puggle they're a mix between a beagle and a pug. I have two of them, they may not have long fur but are still very cute and have a great temperament.<br>  Finally if neither of them do it for you try a border collie. They have long fur, energetic, friendly, fun, and really gorgeous dogs.|`|EqZyhyRraa	If the dog is cute or not should be your last requirment! A dogs looks should not matter if you are just looking for a good o'l family dog. I would go with a Labrador, because they are the best, and aren't too hyper and are awesome with kids. <br>  Furry dogs? The Pomeranian would be my first choice if you wanted a fluffy pooch. That, or a Poodle.|`|lC2II4vPaa	depending on if you want a small breed , medium or large .. <br>  Small breed i would say yorkie or Chihuahua  or even mix breeds make great dogs .,. medium i'd say brittany spaniel or cocker spaniel .. large i'd say golden retriever or Lab ..

dc5579dda31633fb3c2d8612ff7583cdaa	Sand and other particulates that cannot be digested can puncture or clump up and block the intestinal track. Small bearded dragons do not need to be in sand for this reason. When they get older it is fine. We have actually used play sand and had no problems what so ever.  They suggest to use a liner but bearded dragons like to dig and a liner will prevent them from doing so. Sand is okay but to make is more safe run it through a sifter to remove any larger particles to avoid them from accidentally eating that. Bearded dragon do need basking rocks and limbs also. They spend alot of time on those and not just in the sand when they are in the wild. Do not use the calcium sand. It encourages them the eat that. Most products made for bearded dragons are not that safe. Its just a way for you to buy them. You can even used newspaper or toilet paper also.|`|cfblRvE3aa	Sand is bad for bearded dragons if the eat it with their food it will cause blockages in there stomach.also gets stuck under there scales and in ears when they get wet. some alternatives are calci sand which can be broken down alfalfa pellets which smell bad or Timothy hay cut into smaller Pisces.If you want a natural look do a quarter sand with the natural smooth rock fish gravel of descent size grain.Why i dose not effect in wild is they hunt on logs an rocks|`|rrFbQZzIaa	oddly no one has mentioned this but in the wild, dragons DO NOT really live on deep, loose sand like in the saharan desert. They live on more of a hard, tile like surface, a type of hard, dry earth. Sand is bad for dragons b/c it causes a impaction. Calci sand especially will clump in the digestive track and unlike what samantha k says, it is not very digestable and is a common cause of impaction. She works at a pet store so obviously she has no clue by saying they just hunt on rocks. Play sand passes through a dragons digestive track easier, but if the dragon regularly eats the play sand, they still can become impacted by it. Sand is also a breeding ground for bacteria and the cage needs to be changed often as well as the sand.|`|8j7h1ayiaa	i used to have a bearded dragon if your bearded dragon is a baby DONT USE SAND itll get impacted and then youll have to have surgery done but if your bearded dragon is older its i guess okay.|`|LPFGUjFAaa	some types of sand are ok, i avoid them anyway.  if they eat it, it is likely it will stop up their bowels.  it is usually the young ones that end up having problems with the sand.|`|z0gq31Qcaa	cause they inhale it into there lungs and into there food i work ata zoo and we had to top using sand becauseof those reasons|`|Q6osLdosaa	Its not really bad for them its only bad if they ingest allot of it it will clog them up.<br>  <br>  And the sand from the pet shop isn't 100% natural like in the wild.

Cfk1kr8Daa	Don't speak to the breeder any  more - just document EVERYTHING you paid for, and the content, time and date of every conversation and meeting you have had with him.<br>  <br>   Then send a copy with a letter of explanation to the State Vet<br>  <a href="http://www.azda.gov/asd/state_vet.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.azda.gov/asd/state_vet.htm</a><br>   as well as the Better Business Bureau and your state's attorney general.<br>  <br>    Either the state vet's office or the attorney general can explain to you the law in your state - which you may also find online under the Dept of Agriculture (laws pertaining to selling ...).<br>  <br>    You may or may not see your money back, but you will certainly get this guy in a heap of trouble.  <br>  <br>    Also, make sure you notify the AKC as well.<br>  <br>    For now, keep in mind that parvo is a really bad disease that can live in soil for over a year - <br>  <a href="http://www.vin.com/WebLink.plx?BT=1&URL=http://www.sheltermedicine.com/portal/is_parvovirus_canine.shtml#top3" rel="nofollow">http://www.vin.com/WebLink.plx?BT=1&URL=...</a><br>  <br>    And that anyone who would allow a 6 week old puppy to leave its mother - especially a toy breed- is NOT who you want a puppy from.|`|AA10500537	ask  a lawyer it would be well worth it and then they;d track down the rest of the  puppies ,  and they;d all get their money back|`|6SeWCfUfaa	A dog does not show symptom of parvo that soon after exposure.  It takes way more than three days for the symptoms to show.  Normally close to 5-10 days.  It's not likely that the pup caught parvo as quickly as it did while under your care.<br>  <br>  But you know what - I know this is going to sound harsh but you set yourself up for this.  You went to an irresponsible breeder that allowed the pups to leave their mother and litter mates too early, that didn't vaccinate the puppies apparently, and that didn't offer a 72 hour health guarantee.  Good breeders would have done this.<br>  <br>  I think you're lucky to be getting a refund for the price of the pup.  If you didn't have a contract stating specifically what would happen in this type of circumstance, which is sounds like you didn't have, this breeder could easily walk away with that money too.<br>  <br>  It's an expensive and heart breaking lesson for you.  The thing to take away from this is the importance of finding a responsible breeder and reading the purchase contract before taking a puppy home.  <br>  <br>  I'm not completely wiout compassion though.  I feel for you and your family for having to go through this, but sometimes life's lessons don't come easy.|`|AA10400143	If you got the pup on the 17 & she tested positive on the 21, the pup had parvo b/f you got her! The time period they come in contact with parvo is about 14 days! The breeder is at fault this time. Did he give you a health guarantee? If so, he has to pay for the dog & the vet bills. <br>  <br>  Some ppl just should not breed dogs!!|`|ANnz3Kpdaa	i am sorry this happened but i think your only recourse is small claims court ask him to show you the other puppies he won't if you can, make the public aware of his practices and find another provider|`|QtIpuKM3aa	if you have no contract with him you probably won't get anything. But you can scare him into it, first off the law says you are to sell a pup to a new onwner no younger than eight weeks, you get her at 6 weeks, and they should have had 1 set of shots at that age it goes 6 weeks 10 weeks and then 14 weeks those are all the distemper parvo combo's and he probably did not do that if he did he should have given you a paper from the vet unless he did his own shots he shoud have given you a paper with the brand of distemper it should have the date when given then the sticker off the jar. and since it happened within 3 days of the purchase it did not pick up parvo from anywhere but his home. I am guessing he has alot of dogs(puppy mill) I would get a copy of the vet information with the vet saying the dog definatly had parvo and the geststion of the parvo viris to prove she got it in his home the other puppies might have it or trey might not you won't know he will not tell you the truth aand you tell him you met somebody who bought a pup from him who also get parvo and that dog is in the vet hospital right now trying to get better, he won't know. He will then have to be told that he either refunds the $ or you will take him to court you already have a lawyer involved, (he won't know if you really do or not ) if he asks who tell him you will find out when I send you a summons.|`|b2df0927cfc00ec0b4a6f61d9c5cd6e5aa	you could take him to small claims court for your money.<br>  <br>  However, please take this as a lesson. You bought a MUTT from a "BREEDER" thus putting you at risk for an unhealthy dog in the first place. Yes the guy is probably not telling you the truth to you as i've yet to meet an honest backyard breeder. He probably knew his dogs where not healthy but wanted the money and you where the frist person to come alone willing to buy his MUTT.|`|lC2II4vPaa	puppies can not and should not leave their mother till 8 wks of age , and it all depends on if you had a receipt ,  written agreement or health guarantee ... that's more then likely the only way a judge or anyone will make the breeder refund your money.|`|9hBNvAyTaa	First things first I am so sorry for your lost I really am!!  The breeder should of never let that pup go so early.  OK I am going to mention something that happen to me with my new puppy when I brought him home this might make you feel even worse but it is true.  My pup was really sick so I took him to the vet in my town, the vet gave me medicine and the next day which was Sunday, he had gotten worse.  I took him to the local Animal Hospital the next day because it was Sunday and the other vet was not open on Sundays..   The first vet was totally wrong and gave me the wrong medicine that would have eventually killed him.  He is 3 yrs old now and you would never know he was close to death.  I am so sorry to say this but the breeder has to be telling you the truth its his license that is in jeopardy.  I am sorry but I believe the breeder and I believe you should of gotten a second vet.   Again I am so sorry for your loss..|`|gwUMipsUaa	Chances are there was nothing said in the contract about refunds or exchanges.  No contract means you are probably out of luck.  I wish this wasn't the case.  If this wasn't the case, there would be way less puppy mills and back yard breeders due to they'd have to be responsible for what happens.<br>  <br>  Anyone who would sell a mutt puppy to make a profit is what we call a back yard breeder, or puppy mill if done on a large scale.<br>  <br>  Live and learn.|`|PM23RDycaa	Well first mistake was buying a MUTT from a 'breeder'. Mutt breeders are in it for the money.<br>  <br>  Second mistake - No health gaurantee and contract<br>  <br>  All I can find for Arizona only applies to pet store owners, so you pretty much have no legal recourse|`|B7ciNw0aaa	Why did you buy a six week old puppy- and a mutt at that?<br>  <br>  Irresponsible breeders breed mutts, and sell them to people at much too young of an age. I doubt his kennel and home were as clean as they should have been.<br>  <br>  You could take him to court, but the blame may lie on you, depending on what you signed- responsible breeders provide health contracts that stipulate this sort of thing- that puppy wasn't even old enough to finish it's shots!|`|Bw18seFqaa	unfortunantly, thats what you get for buying from an irresponsible breeder..  he sold you a mixed breed dog at 6 weeks..  2 signs that he's not a good breeder.<br>  <br>  <br>  He probably has a crappy 72 hour guarantee for illness..  which means he's not liable to refund you anything.<br>  <br>  <br>  Its a "buyer beware" situation when buying a puppy.|`|Vj13f7zmaa	I hate to tell you this as it is too late, but you never should have had the pup put down.  Very small pups like that are very very prone to low blood sugar which has nothing to do with parvo.  I think it was your vet's mistake and bad treatment.  That said, the breeder should never have sold you a 6 wk pup. Small breeds need to stay with the momma until at least 8 weeks minimum.  Your recourse is small claims court, but he isn't responsible for your bills if he can show that the other pups didn't get it.  However, based on what I know, and I dealt with chihuahuas and other small pups for a long time,  you probably did not have a true case of parvo.  The low blood sugar is the give away.   You said pup acted funny.. was there massive vomiting and diarrhea?  If not, then your pup had a glucose crisis common with the super minis and could have been brought back.|`|q0vKbocHaa	he bred for money, as simple as that. you feel victim of looking a cute puppy and buying it without looking at the conditions, the reason to breed. There isn't really alot you can do about it because you already bought the dog. Why did you buy a not even 6 week old puppy? They should never be seperated from their mother until they are 8 weeks. Again shows how little the breeder knew about breeding dogs and the fact that he was in it for the money.
Dkb2ZR3Daa	Well Lurcher's(sighthound mix) are meant to be very lean. I know that you said your dog has been wormed regularly but have you checked a fecal sample-not all dewormers get everything and giardia is extremely hard to treat/get rid of.  Also bloodwork-can show true problems.. when physical exams show nothing. <br>  Is she spayed? Females that are spayed have a reduced metabolism by 40%.<br>  Puppy food can help- but I would not entirely switch over to puppy food-rather than half and half- and I would recommend consulting your vet first to see if she really needs to put on weight. <br>  <br>  Do not confuse underweight with lean/ideal.-most people tend to be like Italian grandmas and want their dogs to eat and eat!|`|342b3711423c978836fa192cef3238d8aa	Given that she's a lurcher, are you sure she's too thin for her breed?  She's supposed to be thin and sleek with no extra weight at all on her frame.  As long as she's healthy, she's much better off being a little under-weight rather than overweight.  North Americans tend to put too much weight on their dogs anyway.<br>  <br>  But, if you really think she needs more weight, yes, a good quality dry puppy food wouldn't hurt - Innova, Wellness, Timberwolf Organics, Solid Gold, something like that.  Or you could consider feeding her a grain free food like Orijen or Innova EVO.  My greyhounds eat Orijen and are thriving on it - and they're very lean but not underweight. They also eat home-made with raw meat which they prefer.|`|lTsDwY9Paa	Give her a mix of half adult food and half puppy food. Make sure its a high quality food with lots of protein. Nothing you can buy at a grocery store or Walmart is good quality. Wellness is a good food, Wellness Core is even better and can be purchased at Petco. Other high quality foods have to be purchased at specialty pet food stores.|`|tB7QK6BTaa	"has a clean bill of health from the vet."<br>  <br>  So what is the problem?  Clearly she is not underweight.<br>  <br>  Why is it people always want to make dogs overweight, isn't it bad enough that humans have accepted obesity for themselves due to poor dietary choices and excess laziness?  Why insist on compromising the dogs health with fat?<br>  <br>  Sounds like your dog's weight is just fine, clearly your Vet agrees else that is what she/he would say.|`|Rqb9gPN5aa	So, why not have a thyroid panel run? Puppy Chow is crappola.  Take the dog to see a canine internal medicine vet.

My neighbors had a dalmatian and he was okay, but he pretty much just tolerated the children.<br>  <br>  if you want a sweet dog that's purebred, then I'd go for a lab, or a retriever. But it usually isn't a good idea to get a pure bred animal  for several reasons.<br>  <br>  1.) most were bred for hunting or herding, and those instincts never mix well with children<br>  2.) pure breeds are not very healthy, because to get such specific traits, breeders had to originally inbreed the animals. If you google "breed health problems for ______" and insert any breed, you'll get a list. It's quite sad<br>  3.) For an even disposition, it is best to get a mutt.

o93EwErKaa	You don't have to have a tie (being stuck) to result in a pregnancy.  If she is lactating than it is definitely a possibility.  It could also be a false pregnancy since the signs are the same.  At 8 weeks she would be 56 days and within a week of delivery.  At this point, you should be able to see the puppies move and notice a definite weight gain.  It might be that she is only carrying one or two pups with the short encounter so weight gain is not that noticeable.  I would lay the dog down on her side and just spend some quiet time with her with your hands gently on her abdomen.  If you are not seeing or feeling movements for a puppy than she might not be.<br>  <br>  Sorry, you lost your friend.|`|PM23RDycaa	False pregnancies show the same symptoms as a real one. the only way to know for sure is a vet and secondly a pregnant dog needs to be seen by a vet REGARDLESS. And no offense but the vet bills are HER responsibility since she left HER intact ***** outside and unsupervised. <br>  <br>  If she is pregnant there is no guarantee any or all of the pups belong to your dog. If he cold get to her that meant any other male as well. If you want to help with vet bills only offer to pay HALF.<br>  <br>  She probably isn't but a vet is the only way to know for sure. It is never a good thing to be caught off guard by the sudden arrival of pups.<br>  <br>  ADD: If she is 8 weeks along she needs to be seen by a vet or you can just gamble and wait another week and a half (9 week gestation) to see if she gives birth. Guess which option i suggest?|`|KYC0pmH6aa	Im so sorry to hear about your dog. <br>  <br>  It's seems to early to tell, but if she is then that would be a good thing.<br>  I dont really see it neccesary to go to a vet this early, expecially if you dont have the money. Wait a few more weeks and watch the females weight and temper. <br>  <br>  If she is then congradulations, and again. so sorry about your dog.|`|EqZyhyRraa	I understand why you hope she is pregnet, and I am sorry about your dog, but the fact remains that she will be better off if this is a false pregnacy. Having a litter is very hard on a dog, and she probably isn't reg. or has show titles or any of those good things, so her puppies really won't be valuable in a money sense. If you want to get another dog to replace yours, then go check out a shelter.|`|Np3eh4APaa	That suck's

They wouldn't choose to live together of share the same territory like dogs. Mixing two cats can cause a lot of stress if they aren't 100% compatible. <br>  A Male and female combination would be best in my experience. Keep them separate for the first few weeks of adopting the kitten. Make sure they have their own resources and don't have to compete with each other. Resources include littertray, food and sleeping area. Start by swapping their bedding so they can become familiar with each others scent. Once the new cat is settled in, allow the cats to meet but don't just put them into the same room together. Open doors and let them explore themselves, obviously monitoring it though. <br>  Good luck!|`|MJ2UA60Saa	i would get a girl so leo wouldnt get jealous|`|qP8AJ53zaa	its going to be hard to socialize a full grown cat with a kitten. he may get jealous or even harm the cat. bringing a male cat may have territorial problems so its really up to u male female both is gonna be hard to socialize|`|kPJByBaQaa	Go for a girl because all cats should have the experience of being a parent however before you do so make sure you can find suitable and loving homes for the kittens|`|AA11037376	Another male unless you want to be stuck with unwanted kittens a year down the line.|`|BXgfLFVyaa	female|`|8GwE0t6Waa	i think you should get a female cat.

It was a little rough the first few weeks because they didnt know eachother but after she got used to having him around she was perfectly fine! And now they play and sleep together all the time!!

Give your vet a call today, hope your pup feels better.|`|jlz5KxBCaa	My puppy had this same exact problem. The dewormer you have is not going to work. He has a tapeworm and needs to go to the vet ASAP. The dog can die from a tapeworm. He also probably has regular worms he got from his mother. To get the tapeworm he had to have eaten something with it in it. You must take him to the vet and get the tapeworm treatedIMMEDIATELY. If he is skinny he is not getting any nutrients from the food, the tapeworm is taking them all. Form him to though up the worms, he must have a serious infestation that needs to be taken care of. Tapeworms can be killed immediately, but the other regular worms he got from mommy will take a couple douses. The dewormer only kills the adult worms and the baby's live on. Deworming them twice will usually do the trick, but he needs to see a vet for the tapeworm.|`|hYRYO5GYaa	it sounds like tape worms...you only wormed him once right?? after you worm him he should crap out all the worms in 2 days....if he is having watery/gelly diarrea take him to the vet immediatly it could be parvo... it ifs just diarrea with worms it should go away after a few days...u could try giving him some bread just to help firm him up or maybe some soft puppy food|`|EZLuVfKoaa	You need to take the dog to A vet.

Food allergies are very common when feeding dry foods. Rashes, scabs behind the tail and on the chin are all symptoms<br>  The problems associated with Dry food is that they are loaded with grains and carbohydrates which many cats (carnivores) cannot process.  Also, Most of the moisture a cat needs is suppose to be in the food but in<br>  Dry, 95% of it is zapped out of dry foods in the processing. Another thing, most use horrible ingredients and don't use a muscle meat as the primary ingredient and use vegetable based protein versus animal.

IrdZKYT3aa	She'll be fine, and no they won't hatch.  Betta eggs are fertilized outside the females body as she and the male embrace.  With no male, they are infertile.

Some females develop eggs just at the sight of a male, or when they think they see a male.  She could have been stimulated by anything.  It's not harmful for her to produce the eggs, nor is it harmful to release them with no males.<br>  Just remove them and you'll be good.<br>  Best of Luck!|`|c6LKHp54aa	They wont or shouldent Hatch because u have no male ummm to fertalize it so u should be a little carefull because i dont know about beta fish a whole lot but for Samon once they lay the eggs they die so look out for that

They are inquisitive and fun-loving. Just remember the fun that Dorothy had with her little "Toto," in the "Wizard of Oz."|`|AoSeHXeQaa	Terriers in general tend to be independent, inquisitive, and ingenious.<br>  They are not necessarily hyper, but they do have a good amount of energy and they have minds of their own.<br>  <br>  They were bred to hunt rodents, so they do not always get along with other animals (other than dogs), and they may dig.<br>  <br>  I have a Westie mix, and a rat terrier, and I have fostered a couple of terriers, as well.

kWwgWSSgaa	Do you mean the pad? The part of the paw the dog walks on?<br>  <br>  One of my Dobermanns cut a large slice of her pad, so I cleaned it in warm salt water & dressed it in a bandage & canine boot when she needed to go out. <br>  <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/fallonbrooke/2890070928/" rel="nofollow">http://www.flickr.com/photos/fallonbrook...</a><br>  <br>  If it's a large/deep cut, you may want your vet to check the wound.|`|AA12308199	It's not good.  I am currently treating my dog for this same thing.  He go into a fight with my other dog and had his pad ripped up pretty bad.  He needed stitches but can't have them due to testing positive for heartworm (whole other story!!).  He is on antibiotics twice a day and a medicated spray for his foot.  I would call the vet Monday and see what they think.  It's in a spot that can easily become infected quickly.|`|8dCnoh1qaa	Yes it could be, you need to wash it out well.. since dogs walk on it they may pick up debre and in doing so increasing the risk of an infection. just wash it out with water and if you could wrap it so nothing gets into it if not then just keep an eye on it and continue to wash it out once it get dirty|`|c6LKHp54aa	YES ITS REALLY BAD, i suggest u take it to the vet for the wound to be patched up because the wound coud swell if to much pressure gets on it also if like gravle or dirt gets deep into the wound the leg will possebly get amputated!|`|EWXzNyk8aa	What you are talking about is your dog's pad. It's not a good thing for it to be bleeding. You need to make sure that the cut stays clean and stops bleeding soon.|`|u5nYlVMxaa	The 'squishy part' is called the pad of the paw and is important for a dog to be able to keep balance and walk properly.<br>  <br>  Even if the cut is small it may be very painful and problematic for your dog to walk normally.<br>  <br>  Clean the cut as soon as possible with warm water and a little antiseptic, the last thing you want is an infection.<br>  <br>  Also, if there appears to be any gravel or dirt or even glass in the cut, you must take your dog to the vet immediately as this can seriously harm your dogs foot.<br>  <br>  I suggest you give your dog time to rest and heal without letting it have too much strenuous activity as this may further injure it.<br>  <br>  <br>  If the bleeding is quite heavy or takes a long time to stop, take it to the vet as it may need stitches.<br>  <br>  And if you are still worried about your dog or it appears to be in lots of pain take it to the vet. It'll help the dog and put your mind at ease.<br>  <br>  Hope this helps!<br>  <br>  :)
crkGYHWfaa	no it is not completely a safe plan they are much better to keep them in pairs of their own kind i owned 2 and they love love love each other i know they cant live with rats mice or ferrets.. and even though they say its okay to put them with chinchillas like i said its much better to house them with their own kind... good luck and dont forget to do a lot of research on these animals as they are very complicated to own

Try combing through your cat's fur with a flea comb, see if you find any fleas or flea eggs (little white specks.)  Fleas prefer animals, so I doubt you'll get infested, and if you treat your cat for them they'll probably leave you alone.  Ask your vet for the best medicine for your cat, best of luck.|`|BPNAcSpVaa	lol<br>  If your cat has fleas, they can jump onto anything, even your head.|`|BXgfLFVyaa	haha no.<br>  they feed of animals. not humans.<br>  that's lice.|`|Kr9R5Z6oaa	omg yes! i'm turning 11 on april second thank goodness its not april fools day anyways, yes it's okay just spray your bed and stuff it will be ok dont worry!|`|xNkmK0SHaa	Fleas can jump to any part of a person's body - and bite !!|`|0nIwKd5Uaa	Yes they can jump into your hair. I would get a flea spray and spray your bed, and other furniture in the house. Have your parents use a flea remover for the carpet, and get flea preventative for the cat. And a flea comb to remove the fleas off the cat.<br>  <br>  Put all your bedding and pillows through the wash.  If you have a lice comb, comb through your hair to get any other fleas out.

34sidlx2aa	Rats are natural omnivores and will eat almost anything.  However  they should have as a base to their diet properly formulated rat food, this will ensure that they get all the nutrients they need.  Generally you should avoid seed mixes or generic rodent food.  Seed mixes tend to have  lots of things that are not good for rats they will also tend to pick out all their favourite things and leave everything else so you will find you throw a lot away.   Lab blocks are the best option as they make sure your rats get consistently good food. <br>  <br>   You should supplement this with a selection of fruit, vegetables and small amounts of  high quality protein(eggs, chicken, fish etc).  You should avoid feeding them to much dairy product (though small amounts won’t hurt them).  Avoid foods high in fat salt, sugar or other additives.   <br>  <br>  As for toys, I find rats get the most fun out of toys that appeal to their natural instincts. Things they can dig in, crawl through, chew find food in or make bedding out of, will always be popular.  you can find plenty of things round the house to make toys out of to examples of toys that my rats love are digging boxes and pi?atas.  <br>  <br>  For digging boxes fill a plant pot with soil, sprinkle grass seeds on top and water. Leave to grow for a few weeks.  Once you have a little lawn growing in the plant pot, put it in the cage and your rats will have a great time digging.  <br>  <br>  For a Pi?ata get some of your rats favourite treats and rap them in several layers of paper.   Your rats will have a great time tearing through the paper to get at the food.|`|6HhO1Evfaa	They eat many things.  They eat things with grains, organic fruits and vegetables, not too many seeds, not cheese.  They play in rodent wheels, travel balls, enjoy hideouts, and toys.<br>  <br>  Hey you say you want rats eh?  I persuaded my mom and if you contact me I can help.

XX|`|7a8b7995c2d2f60b1b4a6ba83d2a63ccaa	A good mix of packet rat food from the pet shop should be the basis of their diet along with some fruit and veg and occasional meat but you can treat them with pretty much anything as long as it's not too sugary, salty or fatty.<br>  <br>  My girls love hard-boiled eggs, cress, pork pie, black olives, vegetarian sushi and most types of bread.<br>  Yes, I think I spoil them a bit.<br>  <br>  For toys; anything that they can climb on, pots to hide in, wooden blocks to gnaw and strips of torn newspaper. Also let them out of the cage at least once a day to stretch their legs and have a change of scenery.|`|pk8Oemycaa	I feed my rats the blended mix of tropical carnival. It's got all of the foods they need to keep them healthy. Peas, nuts, vitamins, and a bunch of other flavor full treats mixed in. The toys my rats have are never ending. They go through toys and chew toys like it's nothing. I through random things in their cage to keep there imaginations going. Like I through note cards in there so they can shred them and make a bed. I put wood chews, and hanging chews and tissue boxes and tennis balls, and corn cobs and anything I can find that won't harm them. If you aren't getting a rat, I seriously suggest considering getting these little creatures.

EJpiaCMQaa	He may be doing this to get attention from you.  The best thing you can do is to ignore it or walk away when your cockatoo bites your feet.  You don't want to yell "stop it" or something similar to the bird because then the cockatoo will be encouraged to keep biting your feet.  When the cockatoo has calmed down, then you can play with him again and give him some attention.

aCqSF87Raa	It would really depend on the size of the puppy - smaller breeds/dogs tend to have smaller bowels/bladders, so that alone makes it harder for them to learn to hold it.<br>  <br>  Five hours in general isn't too horrible and to be realistic, if you couldn't leave a dog in a crate for lengths of time then nobody would have dogs (or if they did they wouldn't have a social life or a job.)<br>  <br>  I would expect accidents for a while. The general rule of thumb is one hour per month of age for a dog's ability to hold it. So a three month old should be able to hold it for three hours. Adults for eight hours or more (though you shouldn't leave a dog in for that long.)<br>  <br>  Never leave a dog in it's crate for more than five or six hours at a time OR for more than eight or nine on and off throughout a day.

MmRDzhaHaa	Yes sounds like it all the things you mention are the signs,you will know when she is ready to give birth, she will start to look in cupboards and stuff, looking for a suitable nest!  give her a nice and quiet place where she wont be disturbed,and  check with a vet to make sure all is well!|`|BXgfLFVyaa	Yeah she probably is.. take her to the vet if you please|`|fjLluy2baa	well that dirty little tramp...take her to the vet and enjoy the kittens|`|1dfd90ec99e7ca43256c4d9f2f92f46caa	sounds it, take her 2 the vet ?|`|dWK0B5g3aa	It sounds like she's pregnant yes.<br>  You could take her to the vet just to be sure and they could tell you roughly when she's due and give you information of caring for them.<br>  You'll have fun with them :)|`|RN1wGlWWaa	Yes - take her to the vet to be spayed now.  If you let her have the kittens instead, be sure to get her spayed when they are 8 weeks old and keep the kittens for 10-12 weeks before rehoming.<br>  <br>  Also do not let mom outside when nursing kittens - she will get pregnant again.|`|u44twljsaa	Take her to the vet.
AA11992723	Pros: Small size, good in small homes but still need a daily walk, Intelligent, playful, loyal (poodles tend to be a "one person" dog), protective, all size poodles are said to be some of the easier dogs for first time dog owners but the miniature poodle is the easiest out of the 3 sizes.<br>  <br>  Cons: Yappy, small size means you need to take steps for care when they jump down from your bed or couch they will need special pet steps or a ramp, children who don't know how to handle small dogs can easily hurt them, need daily grooming to make sure their fur does not have painful mats, they need a fair and clear leader or they can be aggressive.<br>  <br>  Poodles fur are said to be hypoallergenic, but your mother may still suffer her allergies around them. <br>  <br>  It really depends on your lifestyle so I can't recommend any breed for you! I have heard wheaten terriers are hypoallergenic too but I don't know how true that is. If you want a dog who is small and athletic/energetic, able to learn a great deal of tricks and sports, a toy poodle might still right for you, but weigh in everyone else!|`|KYC0pmH6aa	Sounds like you need a hypoalergenic dog-<br>  <br>  Yorkie- BARLEY sheds, requires grooming unless hair is cut short, cute, smart, fun, a bundle of energy, may be selfish.<br>  <br>  Basenji- They have a very thin layer of fur, so they do not shed as much. Cute, requires excersize, perfers warmth rather than cool.<br>  <br>  Bedlington Terrier <br>  <br>  Bichon Frise- Similar to poodles, cute, smart, perfers cool air. <br>  <br>  Chinese Crested- I <3 these guys, they have hair only on their paws, tail, and top of head. They are sometimes considerd (ugly) but I think they are drop dead GEORGOUS!! Like heat obviously, but durring the winter they may need a small thing sweater on their back...NOT a full body one and NO bootys,<br>  <br>  Coton de Tulear- Similar to Bichon Frise <br>  <br>  Havanese- Similar to Bichon Frise <br>  <br>  Irish Water Spaniel <br>  <br>  Kerry Blue Terrier- Taller, smart, cute, requires excersize.<br>  <br>  <br>  Poodles are very smart dogs, but are NOT hypoalergenic. They have energy and require excersize. TOY poodles are simply a mini of this breed, and usually have more health problems. <br>  <br>  IF you do get a toy poodle, get her FIXED!!! a mini such as herself could easily spread unhealthy genes.|`|HcPJKTlWaa	Poodles make great pets because they are intelligent, hypoallergenic and very versatile. They don't shed in the typical sense but require grooming every 4 to 6 weeks which you can learn to do on your own. I breed poodles with champion lines and also rescue. There are a ton of good breeds out there but poodles have a great personality and since your mom is allergic the poodle is a good fit. Doglover is wrong about toy poodles being a mini of the bred and being less healthy. The Miniature poodle is the mini. Standards are 16 inches, Miniatures over 10 inches and Toy poodles are 10 inches and under. "Teacups" and "Tiny Toys" are considered by the AKC to be a sales gimmick. There is no standard for them and if you buy a poodle the breeder claims is a teacup or tiny toy their papers will be marked toy. It is the "teacup" and "tiny toy" that are more likely to have health problems. Good Luck!|`|lC2II4vPaa	I own a poodle and they are wonderful dog's , they have a great temperament and are great with kids and good listeners .. I also have a Chihuahua and they are also wonderful dogs , the only thing i can say about the smaller breeds is they tend to need alot of attention and you have to be very gentle and careful handling them being they have small bones and are brittle. they also like to shake alot , the vet said they all do that because of their size .. other then that great dogs all the way round .. good luck :)|`|ANnz3Kpdaa	toys are sweet and lively but somewhat delicate and high maintenance it just depends how much you want to spend in grooming costs they are not inclined to breed illness the most i have ever heard is bad knees they are very hardy for their size
FewhKlx9aa	Sit and scratch,lick your paws and roll over.He should get the hint your a dog|`|XIH2oKtJaa	ha, does sound quite a silly question but i know what you mean, i have a rottweiler x dogue de bordeaux and we play fight together like dogs (i'm embarrassed lol) i guess its maybe easier for me though cuz he's so big i just kinda step at him quite fast not dominantly, just playfully. i also grab him and push him round a bit. might not work with yours cuz its so small though. maybe you should give him a playful jab, them move back real quickly..... i dunno lol i sound like a nerd....
4a4b9be516eeab81005bf8f97c61e37aaa	Sweet pea -<br>  <br>  There are a lot of issues here.  #1 NEVER intervene in a cat fight except maybe spraying with water from a distance.<br>  <br>  #2  It is a poor match (kittens with an older cat) and very workable with time and patience.  She has a poor history with humans for her 11 years and has absolutely NO reason to trust you at this point in her life.  Her attack on you has nothing to do with dominance only her stress at being in a new home and having to deal with exuberant young kittens.<br>  <br>  #3 It's not exactly clear to me what space you have available in your home.  Can she stay in your bedroom, separate from the kittens for a week or so?  She needs to chill out right now and do her bonding with you before she has to deal with the kittens.  Locked in a closet is not the best place for a cat - she won't get to know and trust you there nor establish any kind of relationship with the kittens.<br>  <br>  #4.  I would strongly urge you to go to: <a href="http://www.spiritessence.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.spiritessence.com</a> and read about using flower essences with her.  Dr. Jean Hovfe has one called "New Beginnings" (I think she has renamed that one which I have used in the past).  You can tell from the descriptions.  It's only around $22 to have a bottle shipped to you from CO.  You just shake the bottle well and put three to four drops on the fur between her ears four or five times a day for as long as it takes her to adjust to YOU.  If you cannot always reach her you can put the drops on a small cloth or on her bedding.<br>  <br>  You are doing a wonderful thing by giving her a home.  She is not likely to "buddy up" with the kittens and they have each other so it's OK.<br>  <br>  The ONLY reason a cat will attack is out of fear so she needs reassurance that she is safe forever from human abuse.  It may be quite a challenge for you and take a while to accomplish it - you will never regret making the effort.<br>  <br>  The flower essences will really help her to erase past memories and become comfortable in your home.|`|lTsDwY9Paa	Keep them separate for a while longer. It can take several months for cats to get used to each other. Get her spayed and give her some time to relax and realize that she won't be harmed at your house. Let them sniff each other through the door to get to know each other.|`|cJxNY1Ctaa	i wouldnt take her to a shelter. we dont like taking elderly cats because they do not do well with us and alot eventually die from the stress or become sick and have to be put down. give her another week or so and if she continues to try and hurt the babies...i would put an ad in the paper or try and give her to a friend who has no other cats. she needs love and attention. a one cat home would probably be best for her. as far as sticking your hand in the middle of a catfight? bad idea honey. next time use a broom to separate them.|`|BXgfLFVyaa	Uhmm keep them together and they will eventually get used to eachother.. my cats were like that.. and now they clean eachother.|`|J2DeMWAKaa	That happened to me too, sort of. Just get the biggest cat near the kittens and hold it. Next you need to pet the cat to make it forget. This may take a while. Then take the cat and put it away. Repeat it until it gets use to the kittens. You should also try to let go of the cat sometimes. What you shouldn't do is leave the cat alone with the kittens. Hope this works with the cats getting along.
66c4680772e4326cd1f9687e39ff7f56aa	You've done everything correctly. Next, try to find out when the local Pug club will be having their next meeting. Explain that you're looking to get a pug and you'd like to meet some breeders and other pug owners at the meeting. They'll probably invite you. Use that meeting to your advantage to network yourself within the local pug community. It won't be much longer after that that you'll get the dog you want.<br>  <br>  Good luck.|`|gwUMipsUaa	You can get purebreds at shelters as well.  You can also google Pug Rescues.<br>  <br>  I don't understand why people think you can't get purebreds from shelters.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://petfinder.com/" rel="nofollow">http://petfinder.com/</a> Just type in your area, and Pug, and they'll come up with all the purebred Pugs in your area in shelters.|`|Bw18seFqaa	I researched breeders for a few years before I finally got a puppy... not saying it always takes that long, but I researched breeders while I researched the breed.<br>  <br>  Also try shelter or rescue.. you can sometimes find a purebred dog thru there.  www.petfinder.com<br>  <br>  The pug club has a list of breeders...<br>  <a href="http://www.pugs.org/indexbreeder.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.pugs.org/indexbreeder.htm</a><br>  <br>  Be patient..  breeders are often busy with shows, so you may not get a responce right away, expecially if there are any big shows, such as westminster!|`|6SeWCfUfaa	Depending on when you contacted these people you might want to give them some time to respond or write again.  We just had the big Rocky Mountain Cluster dog shows, so .. most every breeder in the state was probably in Denver with their dogs and might be behind or have deleted massive amounts of emails when they got home from the shows last week.<br>  <br>  Be paitent and send off some more emails or make some more phone calls if it's been over a week.  But remember, breeders are usually very busy taking care of their dogs and showing their dogs ... so don't expect a response if it's only been a day or two.  Especially over a weekend when most of the breeders are out training and showing.<br>  <br>  Salt n Pepper:  it's not that people don't understand that you can get a pure bred at a shelter, it's that you can't get a dog that's registered with the AKC at the shelter.  If you want to compete in AKC events, the dog HAS to be registered with them.  The ILP program is not a given.  Even a purebred dog can be denied their ILP with the AKC.<br>  <br>  Rescue all you want, but don't make everyone else feel that they should too.  Because when it comes down to it, they should get a dog that fits THIER needs, not yours.|`|Cfk1kr8Daa	Well, for one thing it was just Westminster week - a lot of the good breeders go to the show, or have a lot to do before then.  It was also Christmas not so long ago, and the reputable people don't produce puppies for Christmas, so they wouldn't have any in mid-winter.  <br>  <br>   Remember also, these people aren't 'professionals' per se, they do other things like work and have families, so there is lots going on that isn't dog related.<br>  <br>   I would pick a time when people are likely to be around and not working, such as a Saturday afternoon, and try calling one or two.  All you need is to get one on the phone, and make contact - they should help you navigate finding someone who has what might suit you, but also tell you who might have puppies in the near future.<br>  <br>    It's easy to think of dog fanciers as business people when you are trying to find a quality puppy and will be paying for one, but in reality, it is a fancy, a hobby, more than anything, and while people take it very seriously - as well they should- we have a lot of other things going at the same time.<br>  <br>    Good luck - and good for you for sticking with this!
FewhKlx9aa	Something is definitely wrong as you have him on an anti-inflammatory med already and he is'nt getting any better.I would make another appt.and get some x-rays as something serious is going on and your dog may become totally crippled if not handled right away.|`|x2Q5Cbbpaa	go see a doctor|`|LtFdsQU1aa	I really think it is nice to have actually cared about it and looked into it. I would suggest you bandage his leg up and for a week or two. And make sure he doesn't walk on it. It might be a broken leg but I highly doubt it.<br>  <br>  Make sure he also gets plenty of rest.
AA11992723	she's a senior dog and it does sound like normal senior dog stiffness to me.<br>  She should be on a daily glucosamine supplement for arthritis pain and stiffness. Not all brands are equal in terms of absorption and dose. I trust Cosequin DS (it's the brand my vet said that the bloodstream absorbs the most medicine from). I have also been researching Ester-C supplement for joint/arthritis. You might want to supplement with ester-c also, but make sure it is in safe doses(ask your vet)<br>  Orthopedic pet beds would also help her with the pain.<br>  <br>  If this is a new problem, feel her leg for heatness and pain, because it could be an injury.<br>  <br>  Add: temperment has nothing to do with physical aging..why not have a vet assess her gait? glucosamine supplements when given daily not only help current arthritis but some research shows it could help prevent or prolong joint pain too.|`|FewhKlx9aa	Yes at that age it most definitely be arthritis.You need to get her in for a checkup to make certain thats what it is and they will prescribe the correct medication for your dog.|`|v0RsFaAzaa	There are a lot of reasons why your dog is limping. She could have injured her leg when you weren't watching, she could have Arthritis, etc. There is no way we can tell you what happened or why she is limping. If she is in obvious pain and not walking so much, then you have the responsibility to take her to a vet. Find an Emergency Vet in your area and take her in to get examined and x-rayed. The vet is the only one who can tell you why she is limping and give her some medication for the pain. Take her in today! It's not fair and it's cruel, for her to have to suffer in pain, when she can get help!|`|EZLuVfKoaa	If It started suddenly it is probably an injury,this has happened to my dogs and they are usually ok in a day or two.You can try giving her a bufferd aspirin it may help.|`|4884c661c8938910239d7729a16fc338aa	Is it cold/snowy outside?

Or maybe she jumped and landed on her leg wrong.  i would suggest taking her to a vet so she isn't in anymore pain and the problem can be taking care of.
Bw18seFqaa	keep her away from males.<br>  <br>  You first need to show her and earn her CH title to proove that she is a good example of the breed.  Showing also helps evaluate so you know what her faults are, and where to improove at.<br>  <br>  While there, find an experienced breed mentor.  He or she can help you research breeding, genetics, whelping, puppy raising, pedigrees, etc.<br>  <br>  Develop a good relationship with your vet.. you will need it when your dog is whelping at 3 am and has a puppy stuck in the birth canal.<br>  <br>  Start saving money.. genetic health tests, stud fees and prenatal care are all costly.  Besides the funds for these, you should also have access to at least $3,000-5,000 for emergency care.<br>  <br>  When she is 2 years old, get her genetic health tests done thru the OFA, CERF, BAER and Optigen, as well as a brucellosis test.<br>  <br>  After you've done all this, your mentor can help you compile a waiting list of potential puppy buyers.. and then help you select a suitable stud.  The stud will be one you've met in the show ring who has traits that compliment your female's faults.<br>  <br>  If you're not willing to do all this, then call the vet and arrange for a spay.  There are lots of dachshunds in shelters and rescues in need of homes..  unless you can be sure you are producing healthy, quality puppies, there's no reason to risk  your dog's life and safety over more pet-quality dogs.|`|l4Qb104Iaa	Most female dogs "go into heat" (estrus) about every 6 or 7 months beginning sometime before their first year of age.  It is best to allow the ***** to reach full growth before breeding her.  Why put the added stress of forming and nursing a litter of pups while her body is geared toward making her own structures?  Always wait until she is fully developed before breeding her, this won't occur until after they are over two years of age.<br>  <br>  <br>  Give these websites a look.|`|lTsDwY9Paa	She's at the right age to go into heat for the first time.

That could be upsetting her stomach and add to her reluctance to eat.<br>  <br>  If there is no physical problem, she *will* eat her dog food.

I used to work for a vet and this is serious. the one vet i worked for would do a whole urinary reconstruction, which is expensive.  if your cat is vomiting, it is not a good sign. weigh your options. if it was my cat, id put him down because this problem will return again if not corrected right away.|`|0zriLTZXaa	I take my cats to this excellent vet and his prices are cheap. His name is Dr. Robinson. His office is 1951 Bath Avenue Brooklyn, N.Y. 11214. The phone number is (718) 256-1900. Tell him why you cannot spend a lot of money and maybe he will lower the prices. He is very nice.|`|JDvf6oIUaa	My cat had something similar...it was actually the food we were feeding him that was making him like that. If they can't go to the bathroom though that'll kill them on their own so you NEED to take him to the vet. It cost me about $300 I think to help my cat. They had to unclog him and we changed his food. Purina I believe was what he was eating. They don't digest it right.<br>  <br>  If you can't afford the antibiotics again though I'd say you should consider putting him to sleep sadly.|`|bd163219e3e28f81a684e8a64f8c8f5caa	One of my cats had recurring urinary track infections and it was from the food i was feeding her. My vet changed it and now she is fine. <br>  If your cat means the world to you, please don't put him to sleep, if the infection is treatable.<br>  Instead, try to find another vet that could be cheaper of put him back into the same antibiotic treatment and tell the vet to change the food. Also, you could contact your local shelter or and explain the situation, they might be able help you.<br>  I hope you can do what in your heart is best for your cat. Whatever it is do it quickly.|`|UvD5Ity1aa	from listening to all the symtoms that your cat is having .. he is in alot of pain ... but  i dont think that you should put him down if your not ready ,, but it would be for your  cats best interest :( <br>  Taylor <3|`|AA11677351	i agree with taylor<br>  i can tell that u really love your cat - i mean - who wouldn't!<br>  but yeah i do think that u should put the poor thing out of his misery.<br>  i don't know how you can bear to watch him suffer.<br>  so, i know it will hurt your emotions a lot but it is the best thing to do.<br>  i had to let my kittens go - though not for the same reason of course. but yeah i cried, but now i'm over it. though i do miss them a lot.<br>  so good luck and i hope you make the right decision
e27a0140d6c769e130a863ab1952f2b9aa	Try feed stores.  I got my daughter's rabbit from one.  Otherwise, gas up the car and prepare for a road trip.  You really limited yourself on this task.  As we get closer to Easter, it should be easier to find rabbits for sale.  Sad as this may sound, but it is a fact.  You could even wait until after Easter and even though you do not want a rescue bunny, you could find a really nice one at the animal shelter after Easter.  <br>  <br>  Pet stores are a mixed bag.  I would stick with one I trusted.  I really do not trust any of them since they are all in it for the money.  I would strongly reccomend the breeder.  You could check the ARBA website and see if there is a rabbit show that is scheduled near your home.  I think some breeders sell rabbits at those.<br>  <br>  Good luck to you, hope this helps.|`|nd2shkoEaa	I got my bunny at Petland.

I foster bunnies for a house rabbit rescue organization and have bunnies of my own. Shelters get many young rabbits in and many times they get babies too. There's a shelter near me right now that has a few litters of babies available and my rescue group has newborns in foster care right now. I also wanted to say that I've fostered babies, young adults and older buns. I kept 2 siblings out of a litter of foster buns I had for a shelter here and one was very outgoing and one was very shy as a baby. They are 9 years old now and the shy one is still shy and they outgoing one is still outgoing. So I'm not sure that raising a little one will make a big difference in it's personality.  If you rescue from a shelter or a rescue, you save a life! <br>  This link <a href="http://www.tampabayhrs.org/Bunny_Stuff.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.tampabayhrs.org/Bunny_Stuff.h...</a> near the bottom of the page has a well written explanation of why pet stores the sell bunnies are not a good thing. www.hrs.org is a great website for bun care. They should normally live 8-13 years in the house. The San Diego chapter has an especially good website, and Florida has a few chapters with good websites. <br>  Hope this helps.
SnAsZapMaa	There's no such thing as a "shephard".<br>  <br>  On the basis of the tiny scrap of information you've given us, for the GSDs all or some of the answers could be yes, or no, or maybe.<br>  <br>  Although there is an occasional GSD with the dominant K^B for self-black, I am convinced that its pedigree includes an unrecorded cross-breeding. All self-coloured GSDs are supposed to have the recessive a^ a^ pairing.<br>  <br>  Whereas self-white is caused by 2 pairs of recessives.<br>  In all breeds tested so far the e^ e^ pairing is one of them, and it "turns off the tap" that puts eumelanin (black pigment) into each hair. The other pairing has not yet been DNA-identified in GSDs, so in the meantime some of us use the c^d c^d coding postulated before DNA reading was possible - we now know that the C series is the wrong locus for the chemical effect required, which is "turning off the tap" that puts phaeomelanin (tan pigment) into each hair.<br>  <br>  The important thing for you to know is that the factor for self-black and the factors for self-white are different genes, at totally different loci.<br>  <br>  The effect is that we have NO idea what pattern & colour genes the white possesses, because ALL its pigment has been turned off.<br>  We know that the self-black is a^ a^, but we don't know whether it is E^m E^m or E^m E^ or E^m e^ or E^ E^ or E^ e^ (it cannot be e^ e^ as that would prevent it from being black). Nor do we know what it possesses at the locus that switches off tan pigment.<br>  <br>  If the white carries an a^ but the black doesn't carry e^ or the other allele (the one we temporarily call c^d), then about half the pups could be black.<br>  If the black carries e^ plus whatever c^d really is, then about half the pups could be white.<br>  <br>  However, based on the pattern alleles that tend to exist in self-whites and in self-blacks, half the pups are likely to be wolf-sables, half the pups saddle-marked, although it is possible that from a quarter to all the litter could be self-black. Just as half the litter could be self-white. Whatever tan colour appears in the pups is likely to end up silvery white on the insides of the thighs and the underbelly and "feathers" by the time they are adults.<br>  <br>  White spots come from yet another gene series. Obviously you can't see them on a white dog.<br>  In GSDs they most commonly occur as a chest spot, but may also appear as one or more white toes or a few white hairs at the tip of the tail - those are regarded as a failure of pigment-cell migration in-utero rather than as a genetic flaw, and can be forgiven provided the nails are black. But if a spot appears on the side or face of the dog, or is large enough to give the GSD a white "sock", that is a fault.<br>  <br>  Your question has been asked many times, as you would have discovered had you used the Search tool.

Black can be either dominant OR recessive depending on the type of black.  Since they are both solid dominant, I will assume that the solid color is dominant, as in laboradors.  This means that there are a few possibilities. <br>  1.) 1  white, 1 black and 2 unpredictable, but probably saddle or sable,, a gene recessive to dominant black, as is most common.<br>  2.) 2 white, 2 black, or<br>  3.) all black <br>  <br>  If the black is recessive, however, which I really doubt, then you will get either<br>  1.) all white dogs, or <br>  2.) 2 white and 2 unpredictable (again, probably saddle or sable, a gene recessive to dominant black, but dominant to recessive black.)|`|qk7J5zDZaa	Solid, by the genetic theory the only change the puppies will have will be seperate solid colors.

And yes - cats allowed to roam free can often end up with litters with more than one more father cat.<br>  <br>  And no, there's no way to find out the breed of cat.  There's no DNA tests for cats.  There is for dogs but only because dog DNA is VERY diverse - just compare the Chihuahua to the Irish Wolfhound.  Plus with it only being a 3% chance of being a particular breed it wouldn't be worth your while even if you could test them.  <br>  <br>  Pedigreed cats are sold by breeders altered unless the cat has been chosen to be part of the cattery's breeding program.

PrZHEy6taa	It depends on the percentage. If the breeder is someone who is knowledgeable on hybrids, they should be able to tell you the answer to your question. If they cannot, then i simply wouldn't get a hybrid from this person as they do not know what they are doing if they do not know the legality of it. <br>  <br>  P.S. Wolf hybrids are wonderful pets.

However, i pretty sure the percentage of wolf does not matter. if it is 10 - 90 % i am pretty sure the law is the same.

They are strong willed, proud and great companions.  <br>  <br>  They do tend to bark and chase lizards but you can address the barking with some obedience training but the chasing of the lizards is in their genes so lizards will be dead.|`|MiKrWuM6aa	A west highland white terrier.

They do require grooming every 6 weeks or so.|`|AoSeHXeQaa	If you look through this site, it will give you an idea of what the different breeds are:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.akc.org/breeds/index.cfm" rel="nofollow">http://www.akc.org/breeds/index.cfm</a><br>  <br>  The "yappy" part has more to do with the owner than the dog. No well trained dog is yappy (I have broken a few foster dogs of the habit).<br>  <br>  Why not go to a local shelter, and see what dogs are available?  If you get an adult dog, you will have a better idea of the size and temperament.  And if you adopt from a rescue organization, the dog will already be neutered and have all its shots.|`|aCqSF87Raa	Hmm... i'm afraid a lot of small breeds (at least in the "Toy" group)  look the way you describe (by sissy and Paris Hilton-ey you mean small and fluffy i assume) mainly because that's what they were bred to do/be: tasteful looking companions. <br>  <br>  There are a few exceptions like: Affenpinscher, Brussel's Griffon, Manchester Terrier, Miniature Pinscher, Toy Fox Terrier, and the Pug. Some, like the Shih Tzu and the Cavalier King Charles Spaniel look fancy but not "sissy" like if you get my drift?<br>  <br>  Toy: <a href="http://www.akc.org/breeds/toy_group.cfm" rel="nofollow">http://www.akc.org/breeds/toy_group.cfm</a><br>  <br>  You might want to look at the "terrier" group on the AKC homepage - some terriers are small but also good looking without looking "sissy."

Excercise and energy levels are something you'll want to keep in mind.  <br>  <br>  OK, nothing yappy and preppy so here goes:<br>  Cairn Terriers (Toto - Wizard of Oz)  GREAT dogs - I've had 2 - but a little high strung.  No Shedding!!  Low Maintenance (brushing)<br>  Poodles are loving dogs but can be yappy sometimes - I had 1 of these also - they don't shed but can require a little more brushing<br>  Corgi's are very cute but I don't know much about temperment<br>  Spaniels make great pets but can have numerous health problems with their ears/eyes - Can be higher maintenance<br>  Bulldogs are awesome in my opinion but they are droolers and often have nasal/breathing problems<br>  Italian Greyhound - adorable, low maintenance but very high strung & full of energy<br>  Basenji - DON'T BARK!

There are a few breeds I urge you to stay away from though.<br>  <br>  Beagles - I have yet to see one make a good inside pet<br>  Jack Russell Terriers - Very stubborn, not eager to please, difficult to train - had 1<br>  <br>  I would also like to encourage you to adopt from your local animal shelter or rescue center.  It can be harder to find what you're looking for, especially a smaller breed but it's worth the effort.  I've owned many dogs and have never been more satisfied than with the one's I adopted from the pound.  It seems as if they realize what it's like outside your home and therefore are more appreciative of you and what you do for them.  Every store-bought dog I've owned has had behavioral problems - running loose, tearing things up, etc. - and they just don't seem to be quite as loving.<br>  <br>  Good Luck to you in your search....|`|woqSJNDiaa	all others are exactly what your asking not to have.<br>  i would suggest a collie or labrador as these are both very loving dogs , medium or small sized and from personal experience having dogs all my life they are not yappy at all and are good working dogs e.g easy to train|`|9WKVmOs1aa	how about a pomeranian. they are really cute and not sissy looking i dont think. it depends on what color you want the dog. also, i kno you want a small dog, but the golden doodles are gorgeous and don't shed. very loving dogs.<br>  good luck :]|`|AA11151792	dont get a yorkshire terrior lol there annoying yappy things lol :P <br>  <br>  jack russel maybe? <br>  i would get it from a puppy tho so its not dangerous wid the cat|`|EzWZIYacaa	my sister just got a morkie (maltese and a yorkie) shes the cutest dog ever :) shes such a good dog too but yorkies take a little longer to pottey train. hooped i helped|`|rXgMY4AIaa	I have 6 yorkies and they arnt yippy at ALL.They are awsome.

He isn't a yappy or hyper dog but is  well mannered and can be a sort of watch dog as well when trained correctly. The only draw backs i would mention are they need the folds of their face washed or wiped with wipes to prevent a foul smell. I also note he sheds more at times then other dogs i have had. I wouldn't trade him for any other  dog.He was extremely easy to house break with a cage while i worked and he held it for 8 hours easy.Another thing i like about him is he doesn't lick his backside or parts[nose to small] as he cant reach them and for me that is a good thing. ha ha ha i wouldn't want  him to give me doggie kisses if he did. Of course he is smart enough to know ''i don't like dog kisses'' but will kiss my hubby.He is extremely loveable and perhaps needy in some ways as likes  to be near me when i am home but i have the time and he gets along fine with cats in the house too.He likes to go for walks and understands many words like walk,treats,fishing, sister, bedtime,come,go,yes,no,etc. he does tricks like the typical sit, up ,stay and will fetch things. I guess it would be easier to say he is smart and very trainable. I dont think you would go wrong with a pug.My guy ''Buddy'' is a little over weight at 25 lbs. most are around 18-20 lbs but i prefer the chubby look.|`|dWK0B5g3aa	If it's a fun dog that your looking for, I would suggest:<br>  Jack Russel Terrier - <a href="http://www.dogbreedinfo.com/jackrussellterrier.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.dogbreedinfo.com/jackrussellt...</a><br>  <br>  Border Terrier-<a href="http://www.dogbreedinfo.com/borderterrier.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.dogbreedinfo.com/borderterrie...</a><br>  <br>  Parson Jack Russel- <a href="http://www.dogbreedinfo.com/parsonrussellterrier.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.dogbreedinfo.com/parsonrussel...</a><br>  <br>  Cocker Spaniel-<a href="http://www.dogbreedinfo.com/englishcocker.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.dogbreedinfo.com/englishcocke...</a><br>  <br>  Italian Greyhound-<a href="http://www.dogbreedinfo.com/italiangreyhound.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.dogbreedinfo.com/italiangreyh...</a><br>   <br>  Field bred Springer Spaniel (my preferred choice because I own one, and she only 16'' and a great dog) -<a href="http://www.dogbreedinfo.com/englishspringerspaniel.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.dogbreedinfo.com/englishsprin...</a><br>  <br>  Or a little mutt from the rescue centre, I also own one and he has so much love to give like all rescue dogs :)<br>  But it depends on what kind of dog characteristics your looking for- <a href="http://www.dogbreedinfo.com/searchcategories.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.dogbreedinfo.com/searchcatego...</a> (at the bottom of the page there is a quiz you can take)<br>  Good look finding a dog|`|fQf4FMbmaa	if you are looking for a small dog that's not yappy like I would look into either a beagle or a ****-zhu dog the ****-zhu even more because they aren't very yappy and very cuddly they like attention and just love to cuddle great with kids if you decide to have any in the future. dogs i would not recommend is a terrier of any kind very noisy but very active loves to run loves to play around also great with kids are very yappy but that can be changed with time and training.

D1beU6MPaa	Moms start to wean their pups between three and four weeks old. This is when they start getting their teeth, and they are now making Mom uncomfortable. Usually this is when they start eating very soft puppy food. I have always bought a good brand of puppy food and add water to it and them mash it up for them. I put the puppy food in big shallow pan and they all gather around it and lap it up. I usualy keep them on a good brand of puppy food until they are a year old, then switch them to an adult dog food.|`|b51294b275ea3556e31d66e62f7ce701aa	We really encourage the mom to help wean them at around 5-8 wks and it varies with each litter. Normally checking to see if baby teeth are starting to break through gums.  You would need a high quality dry puppy chow of the right bite size for the pups. Might have to moisten a bit at first. Pups should continue to nurse until mom decides otherwise and their teeth are hurting her. For the immunities.|`|iu4SOin3aa	At six weeks to eight weeks they should be weaned from their mom, and put on puppy show.<br>  They probably need wet dog food or tiny kibbles, until they get used to eating on their own.|`|N6t1q65xaa	Well, my puppies started chewing random things at 2 1/2 months and already eating (I feed them oats).

vfhKkiSKaa	If you mean the Saddlers Row in Palatine, IL.. yes they are a bit pricey.  In your area I think most places would be pricey.  I know there is Barrington Saddlery (in Barrington), Anne Hubbards (in Lake Bluff), and The Libertyville Saddle Shop (in Libertyville).  I really don't think any those places are much cheaper.  I would go online and check out purchasing stuff there.  Some places will even give you free shipping if you purchase a certain dollar amount.  I know Dover Saddlery has been putting out a catalog that has had some good sales in it lately.<br>  <br>  You can find the bargains out there but you really have to do some searching.<br>  <br>  Can't help much with what you need as I don't know what you have, what the owner of the horse has and what you can use.

51St5GEcaa	It costs very little to feed rats, because you feed them what you eat (if you eat healthily) <br>  <br>  They do need rat food too though. The rat food won't cost much, no matter the brand, and it will last a while because you just give it to them (one or two pieces per rat) once a day. Then for the rest of the day they eat just about anything.<br>  <br>  I give my two baby females kitten food, canned peas, and soy milk. For fresh veggies and fruit, I just give them whatever I have available that week. I also keep a can of mixed nuts for them. They love that.<br>  <br>  Young rats normally wake up and eat two or three times during the day. And they eat through the night too.|`|44kEtDvIaa	Feeding is fairly inexpensive.  And you don't need to get high priced foods from pet stores.  Check site below for more info on rats and their needs.|`|nd2shkoEaa	They eat too much.  Get a hamster.|`|gWlcDZJ6aa	Depends what you're feeding them. i used to feed my rats Kaytee brand rat & mouse food, but then i discovered a homemade food for them that lasts WAY longer than a bag of store bought food. A bag of Kaytee food lasted me about 2 months, and i had 3 rats. With 2 it'll last a bit longer, but not by much. My rule of thumb for how much they're fed is 2 spoonfuls per rat, 1 for small/baby rats. (just a spoon from your kitchen, one you'd use for cereal) But i highly advise the homemade food, it's better for them and lasts a lot longer. i bought 1 bag/box of each ingredient and it made me 3 large bags. i've included the website where the diet can be found, but i shop @ wal-mart so these are the ingredients i found: <br>  <br>  1 bag of unsalted, dry-roasted nuts<br>  1 bag of (unsalted is possible) sunflower seeds<br>  1 container/box of plain oatmeal<br>  1 bag of wheat flakes cereal<br>  1 box of macaroni noodles (like for mac & cheese, but they love the multi-colored swirled ones)<br>  1 bag of rice cereal (do NOT use Rise Krispies cereal. find anthing but that by any means possible. RK has too much sugar in it)<br>  1 bag of dried fruit<br>  <br>  Mix all ingredients in a large bowl then store in plastic bags/containers. It will probably make about 3 or 4 large containers, and last over 7 months for just your 2 girls, depending on how much you feed them per day.
5PsKGss7aa	It depends as first poster has said.if its 2 not neutered males, it may take a while and/or may have to get them neutered.  If one is not neutered,yet the other is, it may be the same as if 2 males cats are not neutered, the not neutered one may take a while to calm down... Though we were fine with ours, we took in a male not neutered cat and we already had a neutered one but they worked out fine with each(both young adults)..  If they both are neutered or not even male, female, then it wont take too long for them to adjust.|`|2YIxnXXyaa	Keep the new cat in one room with the door shut for a few days (Obviously check on her daily).  The two cats will sniff each other under the door, get to know each other and understand that they're not fighting for territory and all that jazz.    In a week or two, if they don't get along, try to find a better home for the new one?    Hope that helps.|`|acf2b6b9818bc9a9c4ec1aa812e142faaa	From my experience I adopted a female cat when it was a kitten.A few months later I got a female cat from my dad. It took them about a week to get along. When my girls were 6 years old I got a male and took about a week also. It is normal for them to hiss and fight some. There trying to be in charge. The good news is they get tired of hissing and fighting and they get along! My 2 girl cats are 10years old now and my male is 6 years old now and they get along great!    PS give them time and show all of them you love them and you don't favor one and in time they will get along!|`|gM7VuCM4aa	If they are 2 males and neither one of them is neutered they may fight all the time. If they are neutered it is just a matter of time.

My dog scratched me in the eye, my chicken pecked me in the eye, my turtle's bitten my cheek almost.  Stuff happens.  If the cat literally ran out to attack your son, then keep an eye out on the cat and if it doesn't start acting better then maybe you should find a friend that can take care of your cat.|`|Ha02Iu5Haa	if the cat does not treat your kid with respect, take them away|`|SfatAG9Gaa	Don't get rid of the cat. Get rid of the kid! Was your son picking on the cat? A cat won't just come up to someone and scratch them in the eye, sorry. I would suggest taking the cat to the vet and having it's claws clipped. Or, another option is going online and finding little cat claw covers. They are rubber pieces that glue over the nail to keep the cat from clawing and tearing up furniture.|`|FfBll2n8aa	It's possible the cat was at fault, and possible your son was, but regardless of that, as a mother, this must have scared you quite a bit.  I wouldn't get rid of the cat unless it has the tendency to attack. This may have been an accident.  What I would suggest is NOT declawing, but trimming your cat's nails. The good thing about cat claws is that you can easily see the quick, and cut the claws to a nice, blunt point. This at least will avoid any serious injuries to anyone. It will also mean you cat is unable to climb very effectively, so be aware of that if you let the cat out unattended.  One point I will make though, is that when you clip a cat's claws, as they grow back, they grow from the inside, which means the new growth is very fine and VERY sharp! Make sure you clip them regularly!! If your cat doesn't like it, try to do it when it's relaxed, and maybe just clip one or two at a time at every opportunity you get. If that fails, wrap him firmly in a towel and get them done as quickly as you can without injuring the cat.

I have been asked by more friends to name their pets and children that I'm happy to help out. First, let's talk about the name "Teddy." It has 3 countries of origin, England, France and Greece.<br>  <br>  <br>  In England, Teddy means "wealthy guardian."<br>  In French, it means "prosperous protector."<br>  In Greek, it's interpreted as "God Given."<br>  <br>  The most famous Teddy, of course, is this country's 19th president, Teddy Roosevelt - a man beloved by many.<br>  <br>  I like the name and somehow you gravitated to it...so I take that as a kind of "sign" also.<br>  <br>  If you're looking for "bear" names cuz' he's a cuddly bundle, don't forget "Koala." I like that one, too.<br>  <br>  <br>  Let me suggest a few other options:<br>  <br>  You mentioned that he has a sweet voice. I looked up male names that mean "singer," and came up with some interesting options:<br>  Shadee (rhymes with "body".) which is of Muslim descent <br>  Shamsherai (shom-share-eye) from the Bible  <br>  Yaron (yar - just like 'yard' without the 'd' and "own") This is Hebrew <br>  <br>  I couldn't really tell the color of the cat's fur - but you might want to look up a color like "brown" in lots of different languages. I LOVE NAMES THAT ARE FROM FOREIGN COUNTRIES - then your pet will definitely have a unique name. There's lots of translation dictionary websites to consult.<br>  <br>  Also consider:<br>  <br>  favorite musicians<br>  tv, movie, or literary characters.<br>  your favorite athlete (My nephew named his sons Payton (for Payton Manning) and Troy (for Troy Aikman) - he has a WONDERFUL wife!!)<br>  your favorite car (I love the name "Harley" - obviously from a motorcycle and  not a car. I can definitly see falling in love with the names Camry, Celica, and such but I just don't feel the same about Fire Bird or F150...)<br>  one of his fun behaviors  <br>  <br>  <br>  Good luck - whichever you choose will be perfect because YOU picked it.<br>  Barb from Cleveland OH
pjOW1Qi3aa	1) Theres no telling why the kitten died. It could have been from a birth defect.<br>  2) You can take it to the vet and have it looked at. If it also has what killed the first kitten then it will probably die as well. Lets just hope it doesn't.<br>  3) a female cat can come back into heat before she wings her litter of kittens.|`|R93qp2Zxaa	1) Not enough info to find out but a vet might be able to check for you.  Newborns are prone to just about anything...you don't know that it's not a birth defect, but you don't know that it wasn't a virus.<br>  2) It's hard to say for certain.  Without knowing the the answer to the first you can't know the 2nd.  It could be that they were simply early and and theirs nothing you can do.  Again -- the vet may be able to help there.<br>  3) A few times a year, a female cat goes into heat.  This attracts the males to her to impregnate her (just like on the discovery channel).  Then, just like any other mammal, they gestate (about 2 months for a cat) and then birth.<br>  Though I highly suggest that unless there's some sort of professional breeding involved, you get her spayed instead.  There are too many kittens in the world without homes already.
TSc8OE4vaa	If you don't go that often, don't waste money on breeches and boots.<br>  <br>  -Any shirt is fine, just dress for the weather.  Obviously nothing too low cut as the bouncing of the horse may cause a problem<br>  -Pants, jeans are fine as long as they don't have a flared bottom, like bell bottoms or flare cut jeans.  Skinny jeans are best if you own them.<br>  -For shoes, make sure they have a small heel.  This will prevent your foot from sliding through the stirrup and causing a problem.  Not "high heels" per say, but don't wear something like converse where the bottom is entirely flat.  Flat bottomed shoes are dangerous to ride in.<br>  <br>  General tips... just make sure you are holding your body upright (not slouching at all), make sure your heels are down and most importantly ALWAYS look forwards/where you want to go.|`|Czh1fbQgaa	Wear shoes with small heels or riding boots. Any shirt is fine just as long as your stomach isn't showing (not like people wear those anymore).|`|6JE0mcrLaa	Depending on the weather where you live, it's hard to say. Wear a shirt you don't mind getting dirty, and bring a sweatshirt along if it's cold. Jeans are great pants to wear. With shoes, it depends on whether you're riding English or Western. With English, you'll want a shoe with a small heel, but with Western, you'll want a deeper heel. If you don't have shoes like that, tennis shoes will have to do. If it's really cold where you live, I suggest wearing long johns underneath your jeans, wearing a long sleeve shirt, and wearing gloves.|`|Xobbmd7Saa	Skinny jeans are probably your best bet because they can go inside your shoes and won't ride up. If you have boots with a low heel, that is the way to go, but for a simple trail ride, sneakers (preferably with ankle support will do. Shirts do not matter to much but if you have a light pair of say, biking gloves, wear those or fingered gloves would be even better if they are of a similar material.<br>  <br>  Good luck and be confident on that horse :)|`|Nh3ZDjwhaa	For just trail riding, anything with a heel, like one inch. Bring a jacket just incase you get cold. Also I would wear comfortables jeans, not skin tight but jeans that you can stretch in to get on the saddle lol Also WEAR a helmet! And pretty much just wear anything that you dont care if it gets dirty. Hope that helped! Have fun and good luck!|`|3wIZiZA5aa	A long sleeved flannel shirt would be good and definaltly leather boots.|`|hJjTs5a5aa	First off a good pair of boots, then shirt wise you can basically wear any kind as long as you dress for the weather. my suggestion is to layer up because if you get hot you can always take layers off. Another thing is a sports bra they are a lifesaver lol, um in general riding sit up straight with heels down and be aware of your surrounding such as things the horse could step on ( garbage, barb wire, and holes in the ground) and also potential hazards like cars, motorcycles etc. so the most important thing is to just pay attention to your horse more than anything that can save you alot of trouble. hope that helps|`|PYzsOctRaa	I RIDE ALOT N JUST WEAR JEANS  A SHIRT  SOME BOOTS AND BRING A JACKET  NOTHING SPECIAL

You also need an emergency fund.    All of the stuff you listed is absolutely, hands down THE cheapest part of horse ownership.      The "begging' (beginning?) part of horse ownership is super cheap.  All you have to pay for is the horse itself and all of the little items you mentioned like brushes and tack.  It's the upkeep that is costly.|`|j45Q2ipRaa	Linz did a great job on the list, but you will also have to add to that list worming.  Depending on the situation and as cheap as it is, you will need to worm your horse on a schedule of every 6-8 weeks max.  Depending on the horse etc. this can be as cheap as $60 a year to a few hundred.|`|i25ZcHnbaa	Saddle: Anywhere between $200-1000  Saddle Stand: It depends they range from $20-100  Girth: Anywhere between $10-90  Breastplate: Optional I personally don't use one.

I by from there all the time. But for the leather products I would reccomend finding a reputable saddler in your area.  I would reccomend getting the stable rugs and sheets for www.smartpakequine.com  The total cost would probly be $1500-2500 total and thats not counting the horse. Hope I helped  I forgot you will have to get a farrier and pay for the vet wich will add another $1000 on per year. Also you dont need to get lead ropes,halters, brushes , and new saddles and bridles every year.|`|rpA9y3Wuaa	Go to horsetackinternational.com & bigdweb.com  they have great prices and big d has free shipping if you buy more than $50 worth of stuff|`|L2rivPUWaa	Depends on a lot of things, like if you own your own property, what the horse will be used for. I hope this website helps:  http://www.horserides.org/buying-first-h...|`|IhjFjoKDaa	If board is $200 per year you'll need to buy hay and grain. I spend $40 per month on grain for my horse and about $50 in hay. Figure $100 per month to feed your horse - maybe more depending on the area. I know some people who spend more like $200 per month on feed and hay.    Used Saddle or new cheap one: $200-$400  Girth - $30  Bridle with reins - $40  Bit: $20-$50  Curb Chain: $5-$15  Halter and Lead Rope - $30  Stable Rug - Minimum $50  Stable Sheet - Minimum $35  Brushes - $25 will get you a good variety of face, rubber curry, sweat scraper, bot knife, and so on    The horse is the cheap part of this endeavor.    You also need to figure in $100 every other month for shoes and trimming. You'll need veterinary care which pends on the horse's condition and age. You may also need special licenses to own the horse in your area, or unexpected expenses.    My saddle stand is a wall one that is stationary - $20  You don't need a curb chain for all bridles so this will pend on your horse.  What the heck are you doing with a crupper? Unless you're riding a mule leave this one off.|`|4mmTyMglaa	I just got my horse at the beginning of January and have spent around $6000-$7000 so far ($2800 was for the horse & shipping it to me).    In addition to the horse, I have bought:    Saddle (new but on sale for half price)  2 Bridles (1 for really cheap on eBay--for dressage, the other new for jumping -- both came with reins)  2 Bits - decent quality snaffles  Saddle pads  Breast plate (she has a weird body and the saddle slides back without it)  Stirrup leathers  Stirrup irons  Girth  Lunge line  Lunge whip  Side reins (not needed depending on what you are doing)  Grooming supplies  2 Halters (always like to have a spare, just in case)  2 leads  Helmet  Boots    Still need to buy:  Dressage saddle  Fly sheet (for when the sun gets worse---she's a grey)  Winter blanket (I have been using a spare from the stable)  Farrier bills (should be in a couple of weeks)  Vet bills (regular visits and any emergencies that arrive)  Insurance  Probably a lot of other things    Also:  Board every month.  You have a good rate, but hay/grain is not included for the price so you will have to calculate that in.  I think hay is $150-$200 a month right now.  I'm not sure about grain.  (I have full board so I don't need to worry about that)|`|iiNAJfGCaa	Plan on spending $10,000 - $15,000 per year.

If a horse is well-cared for vetting usually includes spring shots and floating the teeth annually.  Farrier visist should occur every four to six weeks (bare foot trims or shoes, length of time between visits and costs vary).  You should learn to worm your horse yourself, which should be on a wormer-rotation basis every two to three months.  Hay and grain add up.  So, if it is within your budget to not only purchase the horse and pay the $200.00 per month boarding, but keep up with the other costs got go along with having a horse, then don't miss out on the experience of having a horse.  If this is your first horse, I highly recommend the book, "True Horsemanship Through Feel" by Bill Dorrance.  I live by it.  Also, try investing in a few good DVD's by good horsemen to get a more hands on look at the best way to handle your horse.|`|WxACyBbgaa	Well if you keep your eyes open you might can find a really good deal on a used saddle like I did.I just bought me my first horse,and saddle,bridle,saddle blankets,and bit for $200.Although mine was western you still might can find a really good deal.Every thing I got was in great condition,and if you have family and friends to help you look it might make it easier or you to find something.|`|j2yLjm6Naa	Alot!! horses are not cheap animals to own.

Amkmles0aa	us cats like it cold|`|RN1wGlWWaa	NO - cat's don't need milk (warm or cold) after they are weaned.  It can cause more tummy problems.  Fresh water available at all times is the best.|`|Rw7gi86Naa	Water is just fine for cats. They don't need the vitamins and nutrients in milk like human's do.<br>  <br>  Milk Intolerance, in spite of the customary image of a cat with its face in a dish of cream, cats must acquire a taste for dairy products. Although some cats obviously enjoy cow's milk, many cats do not. It's important to remember that cow's milk differs from the milk kittens get from their nursing mother. Cat's milk contains almost three times as much protein as cow's milk. Orphan kittens fed only cow's milk will not survive because they are not getting sufficient protein in their diet. If you find yourself in the position of surrogate cat-mom, make sure you feed the little ones a nutritionally adequate diet. Consult your veterinarian or feed the kittens one of the commercial products designed for this purpose. Cow's milk can occasionally be a problem for cats that do enjoy it. Some adult cats cannot effectively digest cow's milk, (lactose intolerance) which can result in diarrhea. The diarrhea should stop after you remove milk from your cat's diet. But if the diarrhea persists, lactose intolerance may not be the problem, and you should consult your veterinarian.<br>  Here’s an example of a good alternative… artificial cat milk, great for adult cats and kittens, it can be bought at a pet store: <a href="http://www.terrificpets.com/pet_supplies/cat/health-care/replacement-milk/" rel="nofollow">http://www.terrificpets.com/pet_supplies...</a>|`|VDP3pNCPaa	Don't give regular milk, as cats, once weaned, usually become lactose intolerant.<br>  <br>  My cats drink room temperature water, but in the summer I sometimes add an ice cube, and several of them really like that.

lTsDwY9Paa	Send him a check in the mail. He probably wants deposits to help pay for the costs of the puppies until they're old enough to leave their mother, 8 weeks. The deposit will guarantee you a puppy, just make sure you get a contract saying you made a deposit.|`|JsBb732Maa	Talk to him and see if a nonrefundable deposit. Mail it if you don't want to see the puppies first. Ask for a written receipt saying what sex and breed of puppy you are getting and the age you expect to pick it up and any warranties that come with the puppy. I expect half the asking price on a puppy deposit.If he's taking deposits now they could all be sold if you wait until they are three weeks old. If it's just a two hour drive I'd want to see the puppies first and the conditions they are being raised in, you can use a anti germ wash on your hands and dip your shoes in a water/bleach solution to disinfect them.|`|y0cbLn0Yaa	Is this a refundable deposit where, if when you actually get to view the puppies and decide against one, that it will be returned.<br>  <br>  I wouldn't be sending a deposit for a sight-unseen puppy.|`|FewhKlx9aa	Wait till  they are 3weeks old to go look and see which puppy you want as the temoermant should be showing by then.Also male or female, the runt or the biggest one.Always take a look first to see how these pups are doin and are they vet checked.I would take the 2 hr.drive to go see them as this is a 15 year commitment.If the pups are gone then it was'nt meant to be,I can't see that there are that many people in this economy making a run for the boxer puppies.Read up  in the meantime on this breed and see if it's good for you,do you have the time and money to spend on this type of dog.|`|GK57zwmSaa	Don't put any deposit down on a puppy you haven't seen. Boxers especially if the breeder hasn't done any testing on parents than you may be in for more than you think. Is this person a registered breeder or just someone who happened to have a litter of puppies just for the money. If you do decided to go ahead and make the deposit make sure there is a contract between you and the person selling there pups. Some offer none refundable deposit if you choose to change your mind. Most breeders that are not within the buyers area as for a money payment by sending money order or sending it western union.|`|8584e0329fb17c662606d5a6a8650ee2aa	I personally don't believe in paying a non-refundable deposit for a puppy that I can't see, where I can't see the parents or the living conditions.  There are ways to protect the puppies from disease and still let you see them. Once you see the puppies and like what you see, a deposit is appropriate. Unless she lets you see the dogs, I'd shop elsewhere.  The only exception is the purchase of a puppy from a top show dog and top breeder and the distance is exceptionally long.|`|VkFDAQ46aa	More than likely you will have to drive to where he is at to pay your deposit. make sure you see the pups and the parents before you give him any money. also make sure there are no health problems with any of the dogs. i would wait until the breeder wants you to see them before i gave him any money. also make sure you read carefully and sign a contract showing that you have paid a deposit.|`|xe0z6zNjaa	We did our deposit over the phone, with my credit card.<br>  <br>  You can always send him a check in the mail.

However, most people take despoits BEFORE puppies are sold, and a desposit is NOT first come first served.<br>  <br>  You should have seen the parents before sending in a deposit, asked for proof of OFFICIAL health clearances (not "My vet said they're fine, but proof from OFA etc), asked about health issues in the dogs lines, longevity, health of the breed in general.<br>  <br>  If these Boxers have not been OFA'd or Holter Monitored, you don't want one of these puppies.  Cardio is a huge issue in the breed, and they've been known to drop dead at 4 or 5 due to heart trouble.<br>  <br>  Edit:  Clearly those of you who don't believe in non refundable deposits on unseen puppies have never dealt with a reputable breeder.<br>  <br>  My next puppy will either be from Pennsylvania or Texas. ....I'm in Wisconsin.  I may go down to pick my puppy up, but going to see the parents etc is unlikely to be possible.  That said, I've been talking to these breeders for quite a long time, and I've talked to others that have bought from them or had dogs imported for them by these people.  Good reviews.  Of course there is a negative review every now and then, but that's part of business.<br>  <br>  Part of going to a responsible reputable breeder is allowing the breeder to pick your puppy AND to send you what you asked for in temperament, conformation, and personality without you having really "seen" the puppy.<br>  <br>  Certainly they send pictures through e-mail (some even e-mail or snail mail video!), but seeing in person tends not to be an option.<br>  <br>  I will say AGAIN, that a responsible reputable breeder will give you the right puppy, and they're unlikely to let you pick out your own, because THEY know the puppies personalities, not you.<br>  <br>  Don't buy a puppy out of convenience of location.  Buy for quality.|`|AA11244754	DO NOT pay him anything until you have seen these puppies in person and have picked one out and you know for sure that he is going to actually reserve one for you.  If you get a bad feeling from this guy then save your money and run, not walk away from him.  I wouldn't decide on a dog whose pic I've seen online unless and until I have talked to the person about the dog myself OVER the phone.  For all you know he could have found some pics of puppies online and said that they are his dams puppies and this could all be a scam.  I think it's fishy that he is wanting deposit money now but won't let you see them until they are 3 weeks old.|`|o93EwErKaa	You could mail the deposit, but I don't think it would be a wasted trip if you are able to see the parents and how the dogs are being cared for.  If the environment has a lot of dogs or it not clean, than you probably don't want a pup form this person.  I personally would wait until they were 3 weeks and drive down then.<br>  <br>  The last deposit I mailed turned out to be a very bad situation when I drove the 10 hours to pick up the puppy.  I would have to write 10 pages to tell the whole story.  I wanted a refund, but they didn't have it to return.  The puppy had a severe umbilical hernia so I ended up getting the dog without paying the remainder (but I have paid more than double that in vet bills).  I wish I had driven the 10 hours to pay the deposit and I would have never left one after seeing the conditions.  By the way, I am an experienced breeder, but got taken on this one.  The dog can't be bred because of the hernia, is poor quality, has hypothyroidism, is allergic to all grains.  I am not 100% sure she is even purebred even with the AKC papers.|`|PM23RDycaa	While I am not going to say go to a shelter I am going to say don't buy from this guy unless he is a reputable breeder. Are you getting a two year guarantee for their genetic health? Have the parents had genetic testing and clearances? Are they registered with the AKC or UKC? Limited registration? Tails and dewclaws done?<br>  <br>  As for the deposit you can if he will accept it write him a check or pay in cash/money order. MAKE Sure you get a receipt. Just because you go there doesn't mean you will actually be around the pups. You can pay him through paypal even. If you have questions about how he wants to handle the deposit ASK HIM.<br>  <br>  A deposit on a pups now means you actually want a puppy and that he has one less home to find. <br>  <br>  However until you get answers for the above questions DO NOT put any money down.
EghHVkHEaa	I am an aspiring vet but i don't know what i want to specialize in yet... But i do know that i want to be a vet for sure, nothing else seems fun at all. From what i've looked at you need to have pretty good grades in high school and lots and lots of experience w/ animals. I sort of already have the schools i want to go to lined up - that is if i can get in ha ha. After i get out of high school i want to go to Sweet Briar College in VA (it's all girls, but its also a riding school too, where you can board your horse, go to shows, ETC) to get my pre vet. Then hopefully if i can get in i want to go to Ross University School of Veterinary Medicine in the Caribbean - all the graduates can practice vet med in all 50 states, in 10 provinces of Canada, and in Puerto Rico.<br>  <br>  From the people i've talked to they say that you won't make much money being an equine vet unless you specialize in the legs. Obviously if your going into equine then you are probably going to have to re locate depending on what area of the country you are in. Because some places are just more in need of horse people than others you know? haha.<br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|suTye2m2aa	Go for being a vet.<br>  They make excellent money and are always needed.<br>  <br>  A breeder or trainer isn't going to be a super stable career. <br>  Training can be, but you have to work yourself up from nothing and get well known in your area before you can start charging more money and have more clients.|`|BGyxjekKaa	I recon go for the chiropractor its the best paying and you get very good education and knowledge from it.|`|uNIHqmH8aa	I would go for being an equine vet, yes it is hard work but It comes with good rewards! Plus you would have many customers which in tern, would make you a good sum of money. There is a Shortage of large animal vets at the moment, in fact mine is no longer taking new customers and trying to refer theirs to new people.<br>  <br>  -Nov
ld2vmypNaa	YES ..they still can get calcium from the bones and protein from the meat..Fresh live feeders is better protein for the turtles.<br>  Plus fruits and veggies ..They can have garden worms which I collect after a good rain and dump them un the pond, also meal worms, snails, crickets, flies, crayfish small frogs, slugs, tadpoles ,dragon flies and anything that moves, but only as a treat<br>  Beause ,<br>  ***Some sicknesses they get easily Like shell its actual holes rotting through the shell. <br>  Respiratory sickness, lopsided swimming, coughing, vomiting, blowing bubbles from their nose. * Swollen cloudy eyes comes from lack of Vitamin A. Which we all need for good eyes.  .<br>  Fungus white cotton patches on their skin.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/29035692@N03/sets/72157612827773738/" rel="nofollow">http://www.flickr.com/photos/29035692@N0...</a>|`|ywFPm8Qlaa	Yes think of it like a cuttle fish for birds they have them for the calcium.|`|IRaIxWJKaa	If the dried fish contains the bones ground up, then yes.|`|vS1Z0inOaa	Yes they do if the bones are still in them. I have used dried whole fish cat treats before. However, if you can get your hands on live feeder fish that's really better because you lose some of the nutrients like water-soluble vitamins and vitamin E and K that are stored in the fish liver when you dry it. All of the calcium and alot of the other stuff is still there though so some dried WHOLE fish is OK. If it's dried fish MEAT (sort of like a can of tuna) then there's likely no bones and no benefit aside from some meat (which, if you're not feeding any live food, your turtle needs some of that anyway).

nb9Ky2Draa	yelp loud and high. its a sound they understand to be that they hurt you. its an idea that worked for my pup.|`|DE4tVLgiaa	Try spraying her with water in the face when she bites if she doesn't like water.  When she jumps on the kids, tell them to put their knees up and knee her - not too hard, but enough so that she won't do it again.|`|guVczXfUaa	It IS as simple as turning away, unless she's drawing blood.  <br>  The reason dogs jump is to get your attention.  If you cross your arms and look away (turn your whole head, so your pup cannot mistake your gesture), they quickly get the idea that they can't get your attention that way.  It provides very clear body language for the dog.  <br>  <br>  There are several things you may be doing wrong if this isn't working for you:  <br>  1.)  You may not be waiting long enough.  If you stop ignoring her before she stops jumping and acting excited, then she's won.  She will get tired eventually, though with a terrier it could take a little while.  <br>  2.) Lack of consistency.  If you EVER pet her when she's jumping, you have set her training back by weeks.  You need to ignore EVERY TIME she jumps, the entire time.  You may walk away from her, but do not look at, talk to, or touch her until she is calm.<br>  3.) Someone is reinforcing her excited behavior.  If anyone gives her attention when she is excited, they are amplifying that state of mind, and your efforts are for nothing.  So, make sure your entire family is clear that excitement is NOT happiness, and shouldn't be rewarded.<br>  <br>  Also, don't allow strangers to approach her without first explaining that she is in training, and asking that they only pet her when she is sitting down.  It helps to keep a supply of her favorite treats handy, so you or the other person may reward her when she sits down and doesn't jump.<br>  4.)  This is the most important one, and the one almost everyone gets wrong:  EXERCISE!!!  80-90% of dog behavior problems are directly related to pent up energy.  Especially with a high energy terrier, you need to give her a way to release that energy.  She should walk every day, long enough to make her tired, and at your side, not out in front of you.  <br>  She'll need mental stimulation as well, to prevent boredom.  A ten to fifteen minute daily training session will do wonders.  Make sure to always end on a positive note (her doing what you want her to do, and you giving her praise and a treat).<br>  <br>  Below I posted a link to my favorite dog training website-- Ed Frawley has some amazing pointers on dog training.  I strongly recommend the new puppy, and obedience training videos.  They did wonders for me and my dog.  Also, if you're able, watch Cesar Millan's show "The Dog Whisperer."  Not all of it will apply to you, as he frequently deals with aggressive dogs, but you can learn a great deal from him if you watch his body language with dogs.  He always conveys a calm, authoritative energy.

bud9Yw7Vaa	If possible move them to another tank. Paradise fish are not true tropical fish and only need a temperature of 66-70F/20C. Best way of sexing these fish is to look at the dorsal fin (the one that runs along the top of the fish) In males this tends to be longer than females also the females tend to be more rounded. The gill flaring could be two males showing aggression or conversly could be male displaying to female. For breeding this fish i suggest a seperate tank with plenty of plants Some plants on the surface as well. Hope this helps and GOOD LUCK|`|Amkmles0aa	see a vet|`|v2ut95Wzaa	I don't understand?
GLsCVPCuaa	depends on how responsible of a person you are..how much experience you have with bully breeds..and if you are able to provide firm but fair training...then the staffy can be the best dog you have ever owned<br>  <br>  they are terriers, so they need to be stimulated both physically and mentally, about an hour of exercise per day..they love to be around people, so it would not be a good idea to make him an "outside" dog..staffies love to please their owners..they have a high prey drive and should be socialized with other dogs at a young age...|`|zLXmOXkBaa	It's all about how you raise them. They will be aggressive bully dogs if you let them, or abuse them, or raise them as fighter dogs. <br>  <br>  If you can't discipline them, then don't get one. Like the other person said, you need to be firm yet fair with them. They are awesome dogs if you raise them right, but you have to be hard on them to tame them when their young.|`|OIDJKOM4aa	staffies have a reputation for being vicious which is not the case. they are naturally very loyal happy and gentle pets and have been call the 'nanny dog' as they are so good with children. a dog is only as aggressive as its owner trains it to be.

5UQiaSq1aa	I have a black bear Syrian hamster, and I got her from petsmart. She is perfectly fine, and never once bit. She is my angel. I don't see why you can't get one from there, the employees are nice and friendly, so don't listen to whoever told you otherwise. For My Syrian hamster, I use a ten gallon tank. It is a good size, and you could add anything you'd like to it. I personally don't like cages, because my hamster has escaped from one, a crittertrail. If the ten gallon tank seems to small for your hamster, get the next size up. It really depends on how large your hamster is. Mine is a little 4 month old baby, so a ten gallon is good for her, Clowie.|`|0bvjQtyhaa	they say that because the hamsters are  slow. example their dad may also be their uncle and they also say that beacause they  abuse their  animals but if they are abusing them its stiil like rescuing a hamster from bad owners|`|mD4od8xRaa	I usually follow the rule when it comes to choosing a cage for my hamsters.The rule is 24 inches by 12 inches and it should be 13 inches tall.I usually buy a cage the size of that or larger.<br>  <br>  I got my cages from a pet store nearby.If you want,you may get a tank(aquarium) with a minimum of 10 gallon(for only ONE hamster.The bigger,the better).I suggest you make it as a mixed cage.An aquarium below and then you add a wire cage of top.It is hard to find or make but it's the best type of cage.<br>  <br>  People do not expect anyone to buy from chain pet stores like PetCo or PetSmart simply because some of them mix up the Syrian hamster in the same cage,which shouldn't be done at all.Syrian hamsters are meant to be solitary and should be separated from each other.They WILL fight to death if this has been done.The pet stores you mentioned mix them up in the same cage,ignorant of the fact that they may breed with one another(as the sexes are also mixed) or fight.<br>  <br>  It is good to buy from an EXPERIENCED breeder.Some people may fool you into buying from them but usually the hamsters are of low quality.You should buy a hamster from a good and experienced breeder nearby your area.<br>  *

(you could de-claw it if you're really worried) You might have to watch your sister though, cause she might carry the cat around all the time, which might get it irritated. <br>  As for the asthma, you can get a short-haired cat (like a tabby) and then it shouldn't be too bad.|`|yxJKgf9Faa	if you get a cat as a kitten and give it love and attention then it shouldnt hurt your little sister unless the cat is being constanlty aggrovated also the cockatiels may not be such a good idea with cats.....my cat killed my budgie :( and shedding shouldnt be a problem if the cat is combed regulary and a cat shoudnt cause people to get asthma but a cat may set off the symptoms so in the long run a cat may not be the best pet for you <br>  <br>  hope this helps x|`|jGN2OoSuaa	It really depends on what kind of cat you get. They all have different degrees of allergens and the all have different personalities. Cats do not harm small children as myth has it, I have a 5 month old and 7 cats that love her and are even protective of her. If you get a short haired cat you wont have to do much brushing and they make a rub in ointment called allerpet that comes in a white bottle you can buy at feed supply stores. Siamese are a good breed for people with allergies (I have allergies and breed Siamese). Below is my web address if you wish to see.
lDXh0jRVaa	At about 2 years old your dog will be fully grown. He may continue to put on bulk (though not too much) until he's 3. By 1 year he probably has almost all the height he's going to gain. He won't start acting like an adult until he's around 3 years old.

sddddotPaa	Yes, they can live togather most of the time. Although sometimes you can get two that don't want to live togather and will kill each other. But most of the time they can live with each other with no problem<br>  <br>  To answer your other question, yes! They can live by themselves without feeling lonely and will be just as tame as syrians. Just make sure that you play with your hamster or hamsters very often!|`|Dxrnvvjbaa	I think it would be okay to put 2 Chinese dwarf hamsters in the same cage, just in case have a backup cage in case they fight. Or if they do fight try blowing on them. Another great idea is get tube connectors. Connect them to 2 cages. That way they will have their own cage but can switch back and forth. And they each can have their own wheel.

K10p1Lsoaa	1) SHOCK COLLARS ARE NOT BAD. Look, people, you overestimate. It shocks the dog ONCE if it tries to cross over the line. It's just training, plus it doesn't hurt them. It's just a big tingle. <br>  2) Your dog is a puppy, and a great dane at that. I've never heard of "the perfect great dane" who doesn't fool around. <br>  3) Spending a lot of money on your dog isn't going to bribe them into behaving good. Maybe instead of spending the money on toys, save your money, invest in a leash and walk her.<br>  <br>  Don't give up.

Try to take her to a dog trainer that you think is good and reasonably priced. Maybe Try some dog social skill take her to the park and stuff let her run around and play with the other dogs that should ware her down for a while. Maybe you should take most of her toys away and give her 1 very special brand new one( that's quiet) and maybe she'll get occupied with that for a few hours. Ohh and as for the peeing in the house when you catch her half way throught peeing take her head and shove it in her pee she will really not like this and finally stop peeing in the house if you do it every time, but it's no good if you only find it a few minutes after you have to catch her in the act or she'll not understand why shes being bunished and think your cruel. Hope I Helped in some way.|`|Dkb2ZR3Daa	First of all you have had her since she was 5weeks old which is bad on the breeder and your part for getting her so young... She missed vital parts of socialization and "puppy"hood. <br>  You cannot expect the world from a 14week old puppy, and to be honest maybe its you who is not ready for the work it takes to raise a puppy!<br>  If you want to keep her and actually PROPERLY raise her, you need to enroll her in puppy classes and start obedience training asap.<br>  <br>  As far as the shock collar-there is absolutely no need to use one on a 14week puppy...<br>  Crate training takes consistency and she was probably whining cause she missed her littermates/mom and needs to go out potty-(she's pretty young to ask her to make it all night.)<br>  <br>  They make things that make the poo taste nasty(even though I can't imagine it tasting great in the first place) or even cleaning up your yard-easy solution. Potty training is easy once you make a schedule for yourself and her. She needs more exercise-it can give her something to do thats mentally and physically stimulating.  <br>  <br>  Honestly from reading your question you are not ready for a puppy-try an older dog that will need less training and give this one to a family who can do right by her.<br>  <br>  Edit: I don't care if the puppy is 60pounds-it's plain wrong and nonsense!|`|IZz6mkOFaa	the one person that said to you that shame on the breeder is 100% right ..this puppy never got the solization it needed from the mother .....and at 14 weeks old to even think about putting a shock collar on is totally unthinkable..they do HURT....you need to confine her to a spot of the house..do not let her have full reign of the house..take her out every hour.....exercise a lot..she is a BIG dog...and find a better breeder for that is who you should be taking this question to...a good breeder would be doing everything in their power to help you.  It is their fault.|`|XIH2oKtJaa	you've only been trying to train her for 9 weeks! training takes time and patience, expect to be training her for at least 6 months, and always reinforcing training with POSITIVE methods. shock training a 14 week old puppy is abhorrent, you should be ashamed! shock collars are not necessary unless the situation is extreme - ie attacking other dogs/people. take her to training classes or better yet give her to someone who has the patience and knowledge to care for her properly. also how do you know you've been good at training her? clearly you haven't as she wouldn't be a 'naughty girl' and you wouldn't have used the shock collar. puppy's usually eat poo - are you feeding her good quality puppy food? and do you take her out after every food or drink? also how long do you leave her alone? digging holes is natural behaviour for a dog. and there is no need to spend 200 dollars on a 14 week old puppy, as long as you dedicate your time and energy into her she will not need all these treats and toys.|`|cNqOYNQpaa	Oh my, you need to develop puppy patience. Puppies will regress in their training - some days they do soooo good and do everything that you've trained them to do, other days you think that this is not your dog.<br>  First off,  get into a routine. You are a grown-up raising a new baby. My husband and I got a 10 week Olde English Bulldog. We got up every 2 hours during the night and let the little guy out of his kennel to go potty. Oh and buy some earplugs, works wonders. <br>  By week 12, he could make it 3 hours and was still whining a little when we tucked him in at night, but settled down quickly.<br>  By week 14, he could make it 4-5 hours and is zonked out immediately when we put him in the kennel at night.<br>  He's now 16 weeks. He's upgraded to a doggy bed in the bedroom, and he goes to bed the same time as us. He usually jumps half up on the bed and licks my face if he wants out now. If he doesn't wake up, we let him out after he's been in bed for the night 6 hours. I'm sure he could last longer, but we don't want to have accidents in the morning.<br>  Dog eating poo note - ours did that once at 10 weeks only cause I wasn't paying attention to him. The next time he was going for his poo, I just slightly jerked back his collar and firmly said "NO!" We haven't had an issue since. Pay attention after he poos - make him interested in something else. <br>  Violence isn't the answer! Show your pup that you are the patient one in control of the situation and give him a routine that he can count on.|`|rLDf1gGGaa	Shock collars are CRUEL. <br>  Shock Collars<br>  <br>  Dogs wearing shock collars can suffer from physical pain and injury (ranging from burns to cardiac fibrillation) and psychological stress, including severe anxiety and displaced aggression. Individual animals vary in their temperaments and pain thresholds; a shock that seems mild to one dog may be severe to another. The anxiety and confusion caused by repeated shocks can lead to changes in the heart and respiration rate or gastrointestinal disorders. Electronic collars can also malfunction, either administering nonstop shocks or delivering no shocks at all.<br>  <br>  A dog experiencing an unpleasant shock to the neck 'out of the blue' will associate the sensation with whatever the dog happens to be focusing on at the time. Used incorrectly, this could be an area, object, another dog, the owner or even a child. Unwanted side effects could easily occur when the dog being shocked becomes afraid of being in that area, or it could become afraid of, and as a result, potentially aggressive towards owners, children, other dogs or strangers. <br>  <br>  Number 1; Reason you having problems with her is she was REHOMED at a 2 younger AGE. Puppies shouldn't be rehomed until 8weeks at the earliest! She missed out on essential interation with her littermates and parents and other humans. You pup was too young to receive vacinations.<br>  <br>  Number 2; Puppies are NAUGHTY, you are expecting a puppy that was removed from her parents at a far too early age to act like a well behavied adult. <br>  <br>  Number 3; All puppies go through a period of poo eating, peeing in the house-FOR goodnesss shake she only 14week old! They DON'T have bowel function! You are expecting a puppy to behave like a Trainned adult.<br>  <br>  Number 4; All puppies dig, and all dogs dig! You have to teach the dog and appropiate area to dig in!<br>  <br>  You are expecting far too much from your 14week old pup.<br>  <br>  Puppies need lots of CORRECT trainning to become well manner adults, Big breeds are generally naughty for quite a while-up to 2-4years old, using a shock collar on 14week old puppy, isn't going to get your puppy to love you-in fact, it will stress a 14week old puppy out-no wonder she running away-She downright terrified of it and downright TERRIFIED of YOU.<br>  <br>  Dogs DON'T LEARN A THING FROM SHOCK COLLARS. You will have MORE problems using this method of trainning!<br>  <br>  Remove the shock collar<br>  Start trainning all over again, use food reward.<br>  When you pup receive all his vacinations<br>  Enrol in puppy school-<br>  Once she receive her vacinations<br>  Start socialising with people and other animals<br>  <br>  Again we know and understand how big a 14week old great dane pup is! They are 40pounds+ But what your not realising is that 14weeks is a young pup! you expecting a 14week old puppy to behave like a 5year old Adult-Calm, well trainned and well manner. Well manner only come with trainning and socialising, it take time and patience and More reward, then punishment<br>  <br>  PUPPIES LEARN nothing from consist punishment, THEY ONLY have a short attemption!<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.hsus.org/pets/pet_care/our_pets_for_life_program/dog_behavior_tip_sheets/puppy_chewing.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.hsus.org/pets/pet_care/our_pe...</a><br>  <br>  Training pup sit<br>  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AO7wMwn_ITY" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AO7wMwn_I...</a><br>  <br>  Train pup to lie down<br>  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McC2Ih8ufQo" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McC2Ih8uf...</a><br>  <br>  Teach your pup to stay<br>  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TA5ra25aRJs" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TA5ra25aR...</a><br>  <br>  Teach your pup to come<br>  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=js-qfr9lB6w" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=js-qfr9lB...</a><br>  <br>  Train your pup to heel<br>  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hUgFR4MBw7I" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hUgFR4MBw...</a><br>  <br>  i also had the same problems with my dog-she was former petstore puppy-Sadly my parents thought they came from loving family homes-Not true, they come from cruel puppy mills. I love her, but boy she was very hard to train due to the fact she removed from her parents way too early.<br>  However now after repetive trainning, she now a well manner adult at 10years and 6month old.<br>  Great Dane<br>  Since you have to minimize their exercise, young Great Danes can be very rambunctious. They will romp with uncoordinated gawkiness all over your house. You need to substitute extra quantities of companionship and supervision. Otherwise, left alone, young Great Danes become bored and destructive -- and their powerful jaws can literally destroy your living room.<br>  <br>  Providing enough socialization. Most Great Danes have protective instincts toward strangers. They need extensive exposure to friendly people so they learn to recognize the normal behaviors of "good guys." Then they can recognize the difference when someone acts abnormally. Without careful socialization, they may be suspicious of everyone, which could lead to biting. Some Great Danes go in the opposite direction -- without enough socialization, they become fearful of strangers, which can lead to defensive biting.<br>  <br>  Animal aggression. Some Great Danes are dominant or aggressive toward other dogs, especially of the same sex. Some Great Danes have strong instincts to chase and seize cats and other fleeing creatures. If anything goes wrong in the breeding, socializing, training, handling, or management of this breed, it is capable of seriously injuring or killing other animals.<br>  <br>  The strong temperament. Great Danes are not Golden Retrievers. They have an independent mind of their own and are not pushovers to raise and train. Some Great Danes are willful, obstinate, and dominant (they want to be the boss) and will make you prove that you can make them do things. You must show them, through absolute consistency, that you mean what you say.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.yourpurebredpuppy.com/reviews/greatdanes.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.yourpurebredpuppy.com/reviews...</a><br>  <br>  If you find a pup not co-operating or breaking their collars-great dane, labrador, and golden retriver are well known for breaking their collars as puppies,<br>  <br>  try these alternatives when walking<br>  Halti Headcollar<br>  Gentle Leader Head collars<br>  Or Sporn Training Halter<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.raot.org/information/10_reasons_to_adopt_an_older_dog.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.raot.org/information/10_reaso...</a><br>  <a href="http://www.hollysden.com/say-no-to-shock-collars.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.hollysden.com/say-no-to-shock...</a><br>  <a href="http://www.greenacreskennel.com/pages/Articles/ART_No_Shock_Collars_Train_with_Your_Brain_Not_Pain.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.greenacreskennel.com/pages/Ar...</a><br>  <br>  a Puppy is stil a puppy from day 1 when its born, til 1year old when they are no longer considered pupppies, they are considered young adult.

But she's STILL a puppy...mentally she is an infant and you are expecting her to behave like a full-grown dog!  It doesn't matter HOW big she is, she's still a baby and YOU are not considering that.  So she's 40lbs, so what.  My german shepherd was 30lbs at that age...and still very much a baby.  You say you've spent hundreds of dollars on toys and treats...have you tried actually TRAINING your dog?  Funny thing, TRAINING, actually going to classes, consulting a trainer, and working with the dog has been proven to solve ALL of these issues (except maybe the poop eating...some dogs just do that and there isn't much you can do other than pick up poop right away so that they don't get a chance to have access to it).  At 14 weeks old you can't expect her not to have any accidents in the house.  Forty pounds or not she's still not physically capable of holding her bladder for more than 4 hours or so and in order to successfully house train her you really need to give her more opportunities to get it right.  Don't leave her alone and unsupervised in the yard.  Bored dogs dig holes.  Supervised dogs that have enough mental and physical stimulation don't.  <br>  <br>  The "naughty" things you are describing are all 100% NORMAL dog behaviors that come NATURALLY to all dogs.  It's YOUR job to train her so that she knows not to do these things.  You can't blame her for your inability to communicate...it's not her fault that she's following her instincts.<br>  <br>  Putting a shock collar on a 14 week old puppy, regardless of size, is tantamount to abuse.  What you are doing is creating a fearful dog, not a well-behaved dog, and that will lead to some serious behavioral problems later on.  You think she's bad at 40lbs, just wait until she's 120lbs+ and still acting the same way because you've confused abuse with training.  There was a study released just this past week in Science Daily that links aggressive training techniques (such as shock collars and other punishment-based methods) with aggressive dogs.  Dogs trained using these harsh techniques are far more likely to act aggressively towards people in general and familiar people (ie owners) in particular.  The fact that you've had her since she was 5 weeks old also tells me that this dog is already set up for some potentially serious behavioral problems later in life (those last 3 weeks with mom and littermates is EXTREMELY crucial in a dog learning how to interact normally with other dogs and people and cutting that time short has been proven through multiple studies to result in unstable adult dogs with a high tendency towards behavioral problems such as aggression).  <br>  <br>  Throw the shock collar in the garbage and hire a REAL trainer to guide you through this puppy stage.  Either that, or do both yourselves and the dog a favor and re-home her and seriously consider not getting another dog again ever.  Or at least stick with something of a more manageable size.<br>  <br>  Whether or not shock collars are in and of themselves cruel is beside the point here.  Personally I see no reason to use them when more positive methods produce more consistent and better results.  But regardless of how you feel about them personally you have to face the fact that they were NEVER intended to be used on puppies, they are intended for use on ADULT dogs ONLY.  The police aren't allowed to tazer a two year old for OBVIOUS reasons.  Shock collars should never be used on puppies, regardless of how physically large they seem to be, for the SAME OBVIOUS reasons.|`|Mkl0bBmbaa	Shock collars are cruel , so you know what it feels like put it on your self and turn it to highest setting and shock your self . It hurts !|`|4vrUbRujaa	shock collar isn't really that cruel, but it doesn't work. my friend tried a shock collar, and i was retarded enough to put it on myself i got shock; it doesn't hurt really much, but tickles.... anyway it doesn't work because the dog didn't learned anything but hate the collar (any kind even normal collar). <br>  well 14 weeks old pup isn't old enough to use a shock collar not because too small, but it's easy to teach. Actually 14 weeks pup is the best time to start the obedience training.<br>  don't give up keep trying (well not with the collar lol)<br>  shock training collar is something for a very old hopeless dog and lazy owner.<br>  <br>  and about ur $200... people always spend far more than the cost of the puppy itself, that happened to me too...|`|GaL66jbQaa	Well she shouldn't have left her litter until 8 wks so  her personality might be a result of an irresponsible breeder because no responsible breeder would ever let a puppy go until they had their first set of shots at 6 weeks at the very minimum but even that is super sketchy. Puppies need the socialization with their litter and in most cases are still feeding off of their mom.  Also she's still a baby.  You wouldn't expect a human to behave perfectly at a year old would you?  Try obedience class you may think you're doing a good job training but there's a pretty good chance you're missing something and it's helpful to have feedback from someone more experienced than you.<br>  <br>  you can find your local training club here if you live in the United states<br>  <a href="http://www.akc.org/events/obedience/training_clubs/" rel="nofollow">http://www.akc.org/events/obedience/trai...</a><br>  <br>  This is a Great free downloadable book about puppy training<br>  <a href="http://www.siriuspup.com/beforebook.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.siriuspup.com/beforebook.html</a><br>  <br>  Danes are very intelligent sweet dogs and I would take a good long look at yourself before saying it was the dogs fault.<br>  As a mastiff owner I'm fully aware of their size.|`|aCqSF87Raa	I agree - shock collars are NOT appropriate training devices for puppies. Or for anyone who hasn't consulted a trainer. They can be misused VERY easily and that can make the problems you are trying to fix even worse.<br>  <br>  An e-collar will work on most problems, but ONLY in the right hands, with the right dog, with the right set of behavior problems, and with the right trainer.<br>  <br>  Ditch the collar and start going to obedience classes. You have a PUPPY. These behaviors as TYPICAL for puppies. This will BE a puppy for another year OR MORE. If you weren't ready for this, why did you get a pup in the first place? <br>  <br>  PS - Not an expert but the fact that you got the dog four weeks TOO EARLY could be a factor.|`|nBehRANyaa	A shock collar is not appropriate for a puppy!  Enroll in a good puppy-training class instead.  Your puppy is 'naughty' because you either haven't been training her properly, or you're expecting too much of her at her age (or both).  For instance, how is she able to dig huge holes in the yard?  A puppy shouldn't be left in the yard unsupervised.   A good trainer will help you to figure out how to teach her effectively and what to expect of a puppy.|`|bwHWizWyaa	<a href="http://www.dogfather.tv/" rel="nofollow">http://www.dogfather.tv/</a><br>  <br>  I saw this man on PBS Chanel 9 and I thought his method of training was humane.  <br>  <br>  I am not in support of shock collars.<br>  <br>  P.S. go see Marley and Me, it was a good movie and I think it will help you see the humor and struggle of raising a dog like yours.  <br>  Praying for you all<br>  Lisa|`|mRevWUxlaa	OMGosh!!! Sounds like my situation with my pit bull girl.... alot of people have told me that I need to walk her an hour a day in the morning and give her alot or interaction outside. (Play with her) It is crucial that you do this. She is going to get better.... trust me. The shock collar is, from what Ive heard, just for frustrated owners. If it isnt working, then maybe you need to change tactics. But exercise is going to be your key to happiness. Good Luck!!! =)|`|3b5aeacf5a033dd688f9dd10dbb61115aa	I have owned 2 Great Danes, why on earth would you need a shock collar? They are CRUEL and not needed. Positive training with a firm voice will do the trick. Or if needed take her a licensed trainer.|`|okAYAGvXaa	Shock collar on 14 wk old pup? Dearie, it's you who needs one!!!|`|1Is7u1wUaa	Shock collars should never have been invented!! Do not use one, especially on a 14 week old pup!!! Omg do you realise what sort of damage you will be doing to her, how scared she will grow up to be. And for goodness sake she is 14 weeks old, do u really expect her to be house trained yet and be behaving? Come on! Seriously get a professional trainer coz you obviously have no idea how to train! Of course your dog is going to be howling in her crate if you havn't introduced it slowly and properly to her. Give her a break!|`|6SeWCfUfaa	Wait ... she has all these horrible bad habits, but you think you've done a good job training her?  Sorry, no you haven't done a good job training her and a shock collar isn't going to help.  A very good trainer/behaviorist might be able to help you, but if you're convinced you're doing a good job and the dog is just not learning, don't bother keeping her.  <br>  <br>  You got her too young and she missed out on some very essential learning from her litter mates.  This will make training her more difficult.  She's a large breed dog and will be getting bigger and bigger by the day.  So getting her under control soon is important.  <br>  <br>  The way to do this is to find a very good trainer, someone that will work with you and the dog privately at first and have group classes you can graduate on to and get yourself and the pup into training.  And yes, it's probably going to mean laying out 400-600 dollars initially.<br>  <br>  But if you're not willing to do that, please get the pup into a breed rescue NOW before you screw her up any further.<br>  <br>  And if you get rid of this one, don't get another puppy or dog.  You're not suited to own one.|`|wrUsMG4Jaa	A SHOCK collar on a baby?<br>  <br>  Yeah, thats a great idea if you want to scar her for the rest of her life.<br>  <br>  1)  She eats poo. So, CLEAN IT UP. Gosh that was a hard one..<br>  <br>  2)  Pees in the house? LET HER OUTSIDE. Clean it up when she goes, scold YOURSELF, and let her outside more often.<br>  <br>  3)  Digging is natural. If you didn't want an animal with dog-like behaviors, WHY did you get a dog?<br>  <br>  She'd be better off with another owner who understands puppy behaviors and doesn't so readily turn to an overly painful way of training so quickly.<br>  <br>  ETA> Weight does NOT constitute for an irrational way to train a PUPPY. This is NOT an adult dog, regardless of size.

5KKW7LMBaa	a lot of school horses get "sour" after they have been ridden by lots of different riders each with different levels of ability. he has probably just had enough and needs a holiday (who could blame him!).<br>  <br>  his gaits have probably gotten worse as a result of poor riding, or he could have an injury (but you'd see some kind of lameness then). <br>  <br>  it could also be you that has changed - if it has been a year and you have been riding somewhere else and on other horses your idea of what a "good" horse is might have changed. <br>  <br>  it doesnt sound like you are very happy at this riding school, and you dont seem to like the instructor either, why are you still there?? or why did you go back? maybe you need to change barns....  and take poor old Red with you!|`|xbvxmepGaa	Perhaps the horse has an injury.  This would account for him bumpy gates.  It would also explain why he doesn't seem happy to be out riding-it might hurt.  <br>  I would reccommend switching barns or instructors.  Some people do well with an instructor who uses negativity to teach.  I was never one of those people, and prefer a kind understanding instructor who will explain instead of yelling.  Ask around your area and try a new instructor!|`|4ZcLC6fSaa	He may be getting abused if your trainer yells at you just for riding imagine when their by themself and riding him. I would watch for any signs of the abuse and if it is bad report him. Too many horses are getting abused and none of them deserve it.
RN1wGlWWaa	Many reasons.  I have very healthy cats, and yet Charlie got one!<br>  <br>  I think food with too much fish in it, or too much dry, and not enough drinking of water are the main causes.<br>  <br>  He's on a special Royal Canin for Urinary dry and selected kinds of canned food and has not had any more problems for almost 2 yrs.|`|w1lh1INHaa	The biggest culprit for urinary and bladder problems is a diet of dry food.  There is little moisture in dry food, for one, and as the digestive tract needs moisture to digest the dry food, the lack of moisture being processed by the kidneys and bladder stresses these organs causing an imbalance which causes crystals and/or infection.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.littlebigcat.com/?action=library&act=show&item=whycatsneedcannedfood" rel="nofollow">http://www.littlebigcat.com/?action=libr...</a>|`|o5Tb8ZQ0aa	my cat used to get them all the time.<br>  the doctors said it was crystals building up in the urinary tract. caused by genetics and antagonized by two things, 1.dust in litter, and 2. ash content in the food they eat. If it gets too bad and the crystals aren't broken up to be passed with medications, the cat could have kidney failure and die. change the type of food and litter you use and keep it very clean. and water fresh daily.|`|lTsDwY9Paa	Dirty conditions and/or a poor quality diet.

Im schooling Joker(Jokes On You) 2'6 now and doing 2'  courses and w/t/c at shows. Ive also been riding for 4years. I hope to do 3' with him by summer. Ive already done 2 shows with him, but more with other horses. I just need my pony to get experience and were both learning together. My parents understand and money isnt an issue with them. My dad thinks this sport is dangerous but still supports me, and my mom loves horses so she is always there with me. But both my parents show up for my horse shows. Tell your dad that you just want the show experience and it would be great for both you and the lesson horses to learn your ways around the horse world. So idk just tell your dad you appreciate it that he is letting you do one horse show and maybe if he knows you are thankful for letting him do one show, he'll consider letting you do the other one too. Anyways good luck!|`|yNHBBQ6faa	if you pay for the entries and do all the work your self there's no reason why you shouldn't!<br>  explain how each show helps to improve your riding and confidence and the more shows you do the more chances you have of getting placed and the morse you get placed, the more experience you can add to the horse...so if you were to sell him you could bump up the price with the showing experience!!!|`|j45Q2ipRaa	You are very fortunate to have the priviledge of going to a show.

If your parents can't afford it, it should be a closed issue and pick the one you want the most.|`|uNIHqmH8aa	Do what you father says. Choose one. Horse shows are stressful, and they cost a good sum of money. Not only for the people in them but the people who run them. I'm running two in March myself.

Not good, dude.|`|VkFDAQ46aa	oh lord.... People like you are one of the main reasons pitbulls are banned in alot of areas. training a dog to jump and hang on to something is training your dog to be more aggressive. this is not a good thing to do.|`|dZCsMyjXaa	He's way too young to be doing that. Wait until he's at least a year old; he could hurt himself badly.
L1EccMeZaa	No, please don't use the needles to hometest your cat. That would be dangerous to her.<br>  <br>  What kind of glucometer are you using? Maybe try getting one that needs only a very small amount of blood.<br>  <br>  I use the Freestyle glucometer because it requires the smallest blood sample in the world, I think it's 0.3ml which is about the size of a pin head. It's great because I can't get much blood out of my cat's ear either. The real problem is that the test strips are really expensive, about $80 for 100 strips. To me, it's worth it, but it also depends on how much you can afford. If you do decide to switch to a Freestyle glucometer, I would suggest the Freestyle Freedom or Mini. I have both the Freedom and the Lite, the Lite being the newest one. I always found the Lite to read about 4 points or more higher than the Freedom, and my Freedom is accurate with the one my vet uses. One good thing about the Lite is that it doesn't require a code.<br>  <br>  Always warm the ear before testing so the blood can flow. After I warm my cat's ear, I very gently rub it in an upwards motion which seems to help. Try to get the vein that runs on the outside of the ear. Do you use a lancet device, or just poke with the lancet itself? If you use a device, you may have to put it on a higher setting. I have my device on the highest setting. Just make sure it's doesn't puncture too hard or you may poke right through your kitty's ear! <br>  <br>  I'm sure you already know how important it is to test your cat before you give him/her insulin. I also suggest you try going to this board: <a href="http://www.felinediabetes.com/phorum5/list.php?8" rel="nofollow">http://www.felinediabetes.com/phorum5/li...</a> It's a huge community of people with diabetic cats. They helped me with my cat. He is in diabetic remission right now, (no more need for insulin), and I probably couldn't do it without the help and support of the people on that board.|`|GduRpnn0aa	You should rather check with your vet about this as they might be able to suggest a better way to do this. However, I did want to suggest that you look into buying Mellit. It's a herbal supplement that helps to control the symptoms of diabetes by balancing blood sugar levels and improving insulin bio-availability. It also aids circulation, promotes healing and strengthens and protects a cat's vital organs. I use it for my cat and always tell as many diabetic cat owners as I can!

ZH4N6Xdtaa	chinchillas themselves are very clean and do not smell. If their cage is not cleaned out weekly (at least) then that is what will smell as with all small animals.<br>  <br>  They need daily dust baths to keep their coat clean and they will also groom themselves.<br>  <br>  Get a cage which has a caged bottom and trays that slide underneath (a proper chinchillas cage or a very large parrot cage) and put cat litter in the trays, you will find they wee in one corner and all you have to do is pull out the tray and empty into a  bin bag, they dont really wee that much so that is the smelliest part but you dont notice it as long as the tray is cleaned weekly.<br>  <br>  They pooh constantly but it dry hard pellets which are the same size as a grain of rice, I use an unused paint brush to sweep their shelves in the cage daily and the pooh is easily vacuumed.<br>  <br>  Chinchillas definitly are not smelly but they are hard work to look after.. google chinchilla care and do your research before you buy!|`|KIABW81waa	i don't think so.

Consider if your own dogs went missing - you'd want somebody to turn them in and not just keep them.|`|28834ea3162329035a24ce080e7020edaa	First you can call the shelter, even leave a message on their answering machine letting them know you found a dog. Just in case maybe smeone reports her missing, like you said she might have a home (we know how curious puppies are). <br>  <br>  You can also take the puppy to a vet to see if it has a microchip. A shelter can scan as well, so to save you that trip I would see if you can go drop her off at the shelter since she doesn't get along with your other dogs.|`|AoSeHXeQaa	Call the local animal control, and notify them that you found the dog.<br>  Have the dog scanned to see if he has a microchip.<br>  Put up fliers.<br>  Advertise the dog as "found" in the local newpaper (my local paper will run the ad for free).|`|bJh1MesQaa	Put up fliers around you neighborhood and around grocrie stores. Maybe put an ad in the paper that says found dog and describe the puppy. Hopefully your dogs will work it out with the puppies. Good Luck!|`|1Is7u1wUaa	Take it to the RSPCA!!! You don't know anything about this dog and someone out there might be looking for their dog they have lost. You don't have the right to keep it unless no one claims it and then you can ask the RSPCA if you can adopt it, but as it fights with your other dogs I doubt they would let you have it and I dont think its responsible to keep it anyway in that case.|`|CyWCSy45aa	well you can advertise on craigslist.com that you found a puppy and put pictures of him/her up there i would suggest to ask for a re homing fee so that you know some psycho isn't going to come and get a free dog to do whatever with. if not you can call the humane society and see what they suggest.|`|cfKCR4Reaa	If it has a collar then call the number on it, or you can bring it into a shelter so they can see if it has an ID chip inside of it's body, you could put up fliers, look for fliers to see if it's owner put any up, or just bring it into a shelter for good. Good Luck!|`|Re8MqVNkaa	put up fliers and hope for the best, if nothing comes up all u can do is put them in the animal shelter and hope they get a home :( cause u really cant do anything if it's mean to ur dogs|`|RJOvm2Hmaa	PUT UP POSTER'S TO SAY ANY ONE MISSING a puppy if no one <br>  comes to get him in 2 week's  keep him or give him to some one you know|`|a1wly9wRaa	I think it would be best to separate 'em.|`|LR1YOwuBaa	i will take him! take him to your local shelter they will find a good home for him|`|PZYOTy2Haa	Ring the police. that is normally the 1st place people ring if they can't find their pet, we did.|`|yQiC58bHaa	First off, I would take the stray to the vet you take your dogs to and have them scan the puppy for a microchip. If it is microchipped then the puppy does indeed have owners. You'll be able to get their information from the chip and return their dog to them. <br>  <br>  However, if the dog doesn't have a microchip then I would suggest printing out fliers with pictures of the puppy on them and hope that their owner sees the fliers and comes to claim their dog. <br>  <br>  I wouldn't take the puppy to a shelter unless it's a last resort. Call around to friends, family, neighbors, co-workers, anyone you can think of that might be looking for a puppy. If there is, however, no one that is willing to take the puppy and you can't keep it, then your only option is to take it to a shelter. <br>  <br>  If I were you, however I'd check online for any no-kill shelters that aren't too far away from where you live. Give them a call and see if they have room to take the puppy. Most won't turn down young dogs and cats, seeing as they're often the easiest animals to place.|`|AA11244754	look online for now for a no-kill shelter and then if you can keep it just for tonight, maybe in another room or outside away from your other dogs, call them and let them know that you have found this stray puppy and see if they can send somebody out for him or if you have to take him to them.
VkFDAQ46aa	I agree.there are way too many people that just go out a purchase a puppy or dog simply because they think it is cute and have no idea how to raise, train, feed ect.. there dogs.|`|7vJNHaskaa	Yeah that'd be nice, there are too many people that think buying a dog means that it comes already trained.|`|DgMFQRuHaa	Yeah,<br>  And all the animal abuse in this world is absolutely awful.<br>  It disgusts me.|`|PM23RDycaa	Honestly I wish some of them would just google breed information. Instead they go out buy the dog and THEN ask what the breed is like. How much sense does that make? That's spending hand over fist on a high performance motorcycle without knowing how to ride the damn thing.<br>  <br>  Puppies - UGH. They get them when they are cute and then wonder why the puppy who is in a NEW environment isn't as playful as it was at the breeder's or the shelter. Or why it's nipping at them or tearing up the potty pads.<br>  <br>  I don't know who's worse the adults who should know better or the kids who want advice on changing their parents' minds when they have been told no on several occasions.|`|FewhKlx9aa	I sure do,especially when there is a question on her I just answered as to why the dogs tail won't move after he smacked the dog on the butt.I swear some people the way they treat their animals or want one and then can't afford a vet.They will get a dog even though they don't have a job or any means to support it.I was on a roll but I have to stop.|`|XavY3fiWaa	Definitely.  There are too many bad dog owners, because people just decide to go buy a puppy without learning about training, socializing and all you need to learn about before getting a dog.  Then they realize owning a dog is alot harder then they thought, and then they usually end up getting rid of the dog or dropping it off at a shelter.  So i agree with you 100%.|`|AA11244754	I know.  I think so too.  At least I dont' come running here to ask about every little thing that I can find out from using that thing called the search bar and to keep trying Google doesn't tell you EVERYthing that you may want to know about, sometimes you have to use like wikipedia or just type stuff in the search bar different ways until you get what you are wanting and just don't give up after 1 try or not even try!|`|zhrGiQsKaa	yes, but that should also be the same way with children, because many people aren't even fit to have kids.|`|FrmKbM8waa	NO WAY!!!

5M57TTfpaa	the rabbit cage would be perfect, my hedgie lives in an old guinea pig cage. as long as it is not wire bottom, it is ok. it needs to be solid because their little feet can get stuck in the holes. make sure you can put a wheel in it though, most hedgehogs love to run, and need the exercise to keep themselves in shape.<br>  <br>  they are not real fragile... mostly its how fragile is the person holding him? lol. hedgehogs can look after themselves, when they get scared they roll up into a ball, sticking their quills out. its painful, but you get used to it for the most part. if you handle your hedgie daily, he shouldnt do this.<br>  <br>  im not sure about this one, im pretty sure they should stay in cages, except for playtime. thats kind of like saying, since your hamster is litter trained(which is possible as well), he might be able to roam the house all the time unsupervised. i dont think that would go so well... esp with other animals.<br>  <br>  i have not had probs with mine chewing on anything when he is let out, or even anything inside his cage.<br>  <br>  my hedgie was scared of my pets at first. she rolled into a ball, and made little hissing noises when my pets(cat, 2 rabbits) took turns smelling her. she also made jumpy movements, poking my curious cats nose a couple times. my cat knows not to mess with her. all my rabbits and my cat and hedgehog can all roam around without disturbing the other now, they usually just lay back and watch eachother lol. i would introduce her to the dog by letting your dog sniff her. she will probably react the same way mine did. it depends on your dog, if they can have a friendly relationship, but it is possible.  <br>  <br>  i kinda like manic|`|e49a7ba7ee0a7801e1dfd7dd6a87e67baa	If the rabbit cage has wire flooring, consider covering the bottom with some plastic or wood, so your hedgehog won't fall through. As for fragile, well, you don't want to drop one, but do be cautious because a scared hedgehog will roll up and be very uncomfortable to touch.<br>  A hedgehog will chew, so get it something like wood blocks and toys that will divert that.<br>  A dog might try and eat it, but supervised play may be alright.<br>  And Manic is a good name, or Mephiles :)|`|ZH4N6Xdtaa	hedgehogs should not be kept with other animals especially dogs as they will attack them.<br>  <br>  A large rabbit cage is the next best thing after a actual hedgehog cage which isn't any different!<br>  <br>  It will take a long time but they could be trained to live in the cage, I would suggest that when you are not home it is  kept in the cage because you never what wire it manages to get hold!<br>  <br>  Yes they will chew things, ensure your wires are covered and get a spray to make the wall corners and wooden edges of furniture to taste nasty to put them off chewing! Ensure their are plenty of toys and chews around to distract them.<br>  <br>  Hedgehogs are very timid not really any more fragile than any other small animal.|`|q1vcRgDRaa	yeah the cage should be alright i've seen pygmy albino African hedgehogs in little hamster cages which is ridiculous considering they want 200 euro for them <br>  I've only had a wild hedgehog which wasn't to fragile considering he climbed on top my cupboard and fell off<br>  I wouldn't recommend keeping one without a cage there quite easily lost as I found out<br>  it takes alot of patience and cleaning but with tame hedgehogs its easier<br>  I never experienced chewing on wires but on my cabinet<br>  I don't recommend it as they would probably end up damaging at least one of them as those spikes are sharp and if there any way stressed there in a ball<br>  Manic sounds cool|`|44kEtDvIaa	Rabbit cage would probably work and they are fairly resilient creatures.

b88691c1425e641c73274dcb27f8a891aa	I agree with the others on trying to feed the snake a smaller sized mouse. Also, I strongly suggest that you DON'T FEED her for a full 10 days or so. This may seem like a long time, but as long as you supply her with fresh water in her tank, she will be fine for the time being.<br>  <br>  When a snake regurgitates its food, the stomach lining and all the important enyzmes and healthy bacteria are thrown up also. Your snake needs time to build its stomach lining back up in order to properly digest its next meal.<br>  <br>  I strongly suggest this, because if you continue feeding your snake too soon after regurges, it will eventually die from it.|`|ovsmZX1yaa	you should try feeding her smaller mice. Normally with cornsnakes, they can take in larger mice than the can digest, if the pinkies you buy at the store are too large, I suggest getting your own breeding stock, day old mice are alot smaller than pinkies|`|Tb2wZ2QTaa	Sounds like an internal problem to me and you should take it to a vet ASAP. If possible an exotic specialist.|`|sSJ8zfebaa	dont listen to the first idiot-snakes dont eat bugs.`is the mouse the right size.should be same width as snakes widest point or in your case maybe smaller to get it eating|`|8i90ov0Gaa	First, check your temperatures. The most common cause of regurgitation is temperatures which are too low. I keep mine at an ambient temp of 75 with a hot spot of 85 to 88 degrees. If the temps are fine, check with a vet for any possible illnesses. They do not eat bugs like brock12497 says, who clearly knows nothing about snakes since corn snakes are carnivores and hatch with a full set of teeth.|`|rrFbQZzIaa	brock124 had the worst answer I have ever seen on yahoo. Not one thing he said made any sense. Corn snakes only eat meat, they don't eat bugs and a cut on a throat? they also have teeeth when born. It's people like him that make yahoo answers a dangerous place to get help.<br>  At 7 months, if you're feeding your corn adult mice, they might be a little too big, which could be a reason. If you're feeding appropriate sized mice for it's body size then obviously that's not a problem. <br>  Have you checked the heat in the cage? That could be a problem as well. make sure you have a warm and cool end for the snake to regulate it's body temperature.<br>  Also it may be some kind of internal problem. If your temps are fine and you're feeding the appropriate sized mouse, you may want to consult a local vet for advice and if necessary, a visit.
8e13291b33ff9fcfc620b014d57ead81aa	First off you need more litter boxes.<br>  For 2 cats there should be 3 available.<br>  In each litter box you should offer different litter choices until you find out which litter the cat prefers.<br>  Research tells us that cats prefer unscented,sand like litter that does not clump.<br>  <br>  The cat who is not using the litterbox probably has FLUTDs which is feline lower urinay tract disease.<br>  He likely experienced pain while eliminating and is now associating the litter box with pain.<br>  Until you correct the pain problem he will not return to the litter box.<br>  He needs a urinalysis and culture and sensitivity to rule out urinary tract infection.<br>  If it is negative I would recommend using cosequin sprinkles and omega fatty acids to decrease inflammation that may take care of the pain.<br>  So in order to get your cat back in the litter box you need to get more litter boxes in the house and take the cat to the vets.<br>  Purchase some cosequin and omega fatty acids and add it to the cats diet.<br>  Quality canned food is excellent for males as it helps to keep them hydrated.<br>  The vet may tell you he needs a therapuetic diet and if thats the case follow the vets advice.<br>  Also feliway diffusers can help decrease the cats stress which may curb inappropriate elimination|`|KELBedyiaa	Are they sharing a litter box?<br>  <br>  Each cat ideally should have their own box at least, an extra one on top of that isn't a bad idea.<br>  <br>  Is Leo fixed?  If not he could be marking his territory.|`|KsLm8qg3aa	Leo may not like sharing a litterbox.  You could try getting him another one.  It could be too dirty for his liking sometimes.  It never hurts to move their food as long as you show them where it is.|`|lTsDwY9Paa	He may have a urinary infection. The pain can cause a cat to stop using the litterbox and start using softer places. Take him to the vet and get him checked out.

MmRDzhaHaa	Yes its the start of kidney failure,very common in elderly cats get her to the vet as if caught early, it can be controled with tablets and a special diet(low protein)my cat had the same at 15,so don't delay get to a vet asap.|`|IRaIxWJKaa	That fit was a seizure and she should be checked over by a vet. These can be very dangerous. They're also confusing for the cat and she'll be scared.  They often come in multiples, so she could be having mini-seizures as well.  <br>  <br>  Get her in to the vets tomorrow and tell them what happened.  The weight loss is important, that means your cat has medical issues that are definately established. By taking care of them before they go too far you can still treat the cat.  Wait too long and things progress to where they can't be handled.  He needs to do a urinalysis to see how the kidneys are functioning, a blood test for organ function, and a general checkup WITH emphasis on a close look at the teeth and mouth for ulcers or other problems.  Please don't wait a week to get her in.|`|7zYJbOqKaa	My mom has a 13 year old cat who has somewhat had these issues. She brought him in for some blood work at the vets and he was tested for feline aids and for cancer. Neither showed up but those could be possibilities. It turns out though that he has kidney and liver damage. Kidney failure in cats is verrry common. If they begin drinking an excess in water it could be that, especially if when he/she urinates and its a large amount. <br>  <br>  I would definetly bring her into the vets for a checkup.|`|DEdtNBBSaa	I'm glad you asked.  Some of her symptoms are sounding like kidney disease or even a feline urinary tract infection.  Whatever the case, your cat is in distress.  If she stops urinating altogether, you have an emergency on your hands.  When a cat (or dog) doesn't pee, that means she has a urinary blockage.  Urine can't be expelled, then the toxins build up in her blood.  She literally had about 72 hours to get unblocked or she will die. She will also experience severe trauma from the pain she is in.  Call your vet first thing and get her checked out.|`|dnuqzo5oaa	if the fit was running around and going really fast the cat just wants to play.if not check it for ticks.but if this isent the case get it checked for rabies.and the water thing is normal the cat is getting old!!!!|`|s6BcDmNtaa	When you say she had a fit, what do you mean?  Please describe what the fit looked like. Was she on the floor having some sort of convulsions-that would be a seizure?  Did she race around the house at a high rate of speed?

vS1Z0inOaa	Your turtle has shell rot. If you don't treat it now, it will eventually eat away all of his shell or lead to a blood infection like septicemia and cost him his life. Treat it now though and he'll be fine, but there'll likely always be some cosmetic defects on his shell from it.<br>     First, let's address the cause. RES need to be able to dry off completely regularly or they WILL get shel rot. Do you have a basking area for him and is it completely dry? I mean COMPLETELY dry; he needs to dry the bottom shell also. Also do you have a hood over the tank? If so, it's likely not allowing water to evaporate and is keeping the air humidity too high which would mean he's not drying off when basking. Keep the tank open or use a screen top instead. The second cause is inadequately filtered water. To keepthe tank clean, you need about 5 gallons of water per inch of turtle if its under 4 inches long and 10 gallons per inch after that. Then your filter needs to be rated for 2 to 3 times that amount of water. So for your 3 inch turtle, the minimum would be 15 gallons of water with a filter rated for 30 to 45 gallons. On top of that, the water needs to be changed out every week. You should be feeding him in a separate bowl, NOT in the tank. Feeding in the tank means letover food dissolves into his water and spoils there, and no filter is going to properly clean that up.<br>     Now, to treat his condition, you will need to dry dock him. That means taking him out of the water so he is dry at least overnight if not for most of the day. At least for the first week, he probably should not be in the water more than 2 or 3 hours a day. You also need to clean his shell regularly with a soft toothbrush and betadine or hydrogen peroxide diluted 1/10. Rinse it once a day with silvadine or novasan. Within a few days the dead part of his shell should starts sloughing and you should try to help CAREFULLY worry it off (no pulling!).<br>     Do NOT stop dry dockig until all of the yellow/dry parts have sloughed off and ONLY healthy bone is left. It will likely take him a long time to heal, but as long as you're providing a good dry basking area and clean water the shell rot should not come back.|`|ld2vmypNaa	<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/29035692@N03/sets/72157612827773738/" rel="nofollow">http://www.flickr.com/photos/29035692@N0...</a><br>  <br>  Contact rescues sites…and vets in your city,state, or country.<br>  Red-Eared Slider: <a href="http://www.anapsid.org/reslider.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.anapsid.org/reslider.html</a><br>  <br>  'Austinsturtlepage.com'  for all info and care on all turtles!!!<br>  <br>  <br>  Have you been doing any of this...<br>  They NEED calcium and protein they get it from the fish meat and the fish bones. Drop 20 or 30 or so feeder guppies or small goldfish or minnows they maybe a bit fast for babies at first just drop in the tank and watch them disappear in a few days! The more they eat the healthier the turtle.<br>  **** If these are hatchlings a 1” and a tad over they may need to have their live food half dead by leaving the fish out of water for a few minutes (10minutes) and put in the tank. That way the baby can get the meat he needs and the fish can’t out run the baby turtle.<br>  Plus some leafy green and vitamin A fruits cut up a few times a week<br>  Plus I also feed dried cubed blood worms or tubiflex worms or pellets at least 5 times a week for my five..<br>  They can have garden worms which I collect after a good rain and dump them un the pond, also meal worms, snails, crickets, flies, crayfish small frogs, slugs, tadpoles ,dragon flies and anything that moves, but only as a treat.<br>  They need leafy greens Romaine, Butter lettuce. (Iceberg and cabbage are bad for them, any other leafy greens will do) for vitamin A that they need at least 4 to 5 times a week.<br>  They love grapes and strawberries and squash , apples.<br>  These turtles in captivity do not hibernate their eating may slow down some but they will not hibernate. They cannot hear or see well so they feel you coming by the vibrations each foot step take. And in the winter their appetites slow down some.<br>  TOSS in a bird cuttle bone in the water for calcium that will promote better shell growth, it will dissolve real slow and if they eat it that’s fine!!<br>  <br>  Did you know that they need to bask under a reptile light UVA/UVB for up to 8 hrs a day for the vitamin D that they need to grow. <br>  So they need a turtle basking dock. <br>  Gravel larger than they can swallow, allot larger.<br>  Their water needs to be clean otherwise they get sick easily from dirty water cause they poop allot. <br>  You need a GREAT filter system depending on the tank in a 60 gallon my girls were in one, I used two double sided marine or penguin filters…It really helped keep it cleaner! <br>  <br>  They will bite very very hard. Under 4" they carry a disease called 'salmonella'. So you must wash after every handling ANY size turtle.. ***And my pictures don't lie. All ages and all sizes get along as long as their is allot for swim room and plenty to eat! They can become cannibalistic if you have 2 or more turtles and a small environment. They will kill off the smallest and then fight for the tank for themselves.<br>  <br>  Size for basic aquatic turtle is approx Body length: 5-8" is average for males, up to 12 inches max for females, but average is about 9 to 10“ in captivity. Life span: 15-25+ years plus. Males have the longer front nails and are used in mating. And are considered mature at about 5 yrs old. You can’t start sexing till about 3” across. Real mating happens in May through June and hatchlings within 90 days. Eggs are laid in soil. If laid in water they will die. Do not cut the males nails!!<br>  They sleep at the bottom of rivers, streams. lakes or ponds or your tank to avoid predators like coyotes, foxes, owls, hawks, possums, raccoons and even some wide mouth bass and us humans.<br>  <br>  ***Some sicknesses they get easily Like shell its actual holes rotting through the shell. <br>  Respiratory sickness, lopsided swimming, coughing, vomiting, blowing bubbles from their nose. * Swollen cloudy eyes comes from lack of Vitamin A. Which we all need for good eyes.  .<br>  Fungus white cotton patches on their skin, treat by adding a 1/4 of a cup of aquarium salt per 5 gallons to irritate and hopefully kill fungus. The addition of sulfa drugs such as those sold at pet stores under the name "Dr. Turtle".|`|SgKsHxD5aa	i have no clue.<br>  but if you want to make sure its healthy without paying expensive veterinarian bills, take it to a petsmart store. they will find someone there that can help you determine whether or not its healthy.|`|AA10043485	The most common problem here is that the cares and diet have not been good for a while.

wA7kqXfRaa	I have 5 cats and know how it can be. Maybe make the litter box and show it to them and thats all they need. They know its there and will use it when they need it. And maybe clean it out 2-3 times a week. And for food, maybe kit kaboodle, meow mix, or stuff you find at your local market! Make sure you give them attention. Some cats like it if you pet there paw but if they pu;ll it back then they must be sensitive. Maybe scratch them behind the ear or under the chin. And if the are the playful type then buy some toys~ my cats L-O-V-E these balls with bells in them. or mini mice that have that flaovr of cat treats. And I saw you asked for treats. Maybe buy soft and chewy oragnic treats and give them one or two a day. Depends on how big they are.|`|IRaIxWJKaa	They do sound lost, they may have been dumped. Thanks for taking them in.<br>  <br>  Clean the used stuff out of the box as it gets deposited, usually one pee and one poop a day per cat.  Take that to the garbage outside so odors don't accumulate in the house.  Dry food available all day is fine, as is a bowl of water.  They'll entertain themselves but want some petting and talking from you.  You can toss them crumpled paper balls for toys.  They won't need treats but you can share some baked chicken with them (no coating or bones).|`|g36NU81raa	Take them to the vet, they will see if they are microchipped and they will check them over.<br>  Cats are usually self-regualating so just get them some cat food in a bowl and they should eat as much as they need. Clean out their litter box basically whenever they have done anything in it. Hope this helps and good luck!|`|a8I7fXdHaa	You are GREAT for taking in these lost cats!!<br>  I have 4 inside cats and I keep a bowl of cat food and plenty of water available all the time. I also clean out the litter box 2 or 3 times a day, but only change all the litter once a week. Its a BIG litter box!!<br>  Good luck, hope their owner claims them soon.
a8I7fXdHaa	I think Harvey has some pit bull in him. Please don't be concerned, we have a male pit bull and he's loving and sweet. I honestly believe that any breed can be mean, its how they are raised. <br>  I think Harvey is SO cute!! Enjoy him!!|`|mRevWUxlaa	Your Harvey looks like a Shetland Sheepdog or Collie mix..... perhaps with a Chow Chow or Akita???? I dont know but he definitly has Sheltie or Collie markings. Good Luck!!! =)|`|gd1uWdLsaa	looks like a pit chow mix or something along those lines.|`|QDQwKbM6aa	He looks like a Boxer|`|RN1wGlWWaa	Very pretty boy - love the markings.  I would guess a pit bull type or husky type in the background.<br>  <br>  BTW its "Thanksgiving".....lol|`|2O58btqxaa	akita x pit i think he s cute|`|bJh1MesQaa	He is so cute! I want him! I think he looks like a chow/sharpe mix. Even though he doesn't have the Sharpe wrinkles his head is shaped like one. That is an adorable puppy and I loved the video! Good Luck!|`|7vJNHaskaa	The ears say Shepherd and the body/markings say pit to me. He's adorable =]|`|jWKMqNOsaa	I would go with an Akita/Shepard mix, maybe corgi for his coat coloration. He's mixed up whatever he is!|`|FewhKlx9aa	I see akita but on the closeup I also see pitt bull face,cute video
vfhKkiSKaa	Because of their squishy face they are prone to eye problems.  The get a lot of discharge from them and that is usually what causes the bad smell.  Instead of bathing them too often you need to keep their eyes clean.  You can buy wipes specifically for dogs with this problem.  It helps keep them clean and cut down on the smell.|`|MK9g92VPaa	mine smells i thinks it's their ears|`|0k2y3bNgaa	Take her to be bathed and groomed professionally and explain the bad smell to the person who is cleaning her, and ask if they can do something about it :]]]|`|GaL66jbQaa	First of all NO dog should ever be bathed more than once a week.  I had a shih-tzu his face usually smelled like whatever he ate that day.  If it offends you that much you can try doggy wipes but bathing is really bad for their skin if you do it too much.
TuheGzLkaa	It really depends on the personality and energy of the dog. I prefer mutts. But i would have to say a german shepherd. Pure bred dogs have too many genetic problems. But for me it's really how the animal's energy feels|`|bJh1MesQaa	I would rather have a german shepherd. They are so cute. Jack Russells are cute but they are so annoying. Bark bark bark all day long. <br>  <br>  My favorite breed of dog is a border collie. So smart and loyal and most importantly cute!|`|6SeWCfUfaa	Highly trained, I'd take either.  Or both!  Can I have both???<br>  <br>  I don't have a favorite breed.  I own an Aussie right now, but there are plenty of other breeds I could be happy with.|`|5XyBxxYAaa	I love German Shepherds, I have an 11 year old one at the moment.<br>  I don`t like JR sorry<br>  I also love rottweilers which was the last dog I had for 12 years|`|4b8fb7d13eab5f34e3a4f0ce4fbb2680aa	Highly trained JR?? Is there such a thing?<br>  GSD everytime|`|7vJNHaskaa	Definitely German Shepherd, I'm not very fond of small dogs.<br>  <br>  Not sure about my favorite breed...|`|lu7enc3yaa	rather have german sheperd. and my favorite dog is doberman pinsher|`|VR9iC2ykaa	I would rather the GS.<br>  rott<br>  gsd<br>  dobe<br>  yorkie|`|pdLdYCyvaa	i would go with the JR. I find that smaller dogs are just more lovable and great companions that bigger dogs. BuT I guess it really depends on the personality of the dog. I had a cocker spaniel and she was the best dog ever, loving loyal, and just a kind hearted dog (not all that great of protection). And she died last spring. This winter I couldn't stand not having a dog and adopted an australian cattle dog yellow lab mix from the humane society and she's sweet and actually extremely protective but she's not like my first dog. she was 7m/o when i got her and now she is about a year old. She was so much easier to house break then the cocker spaniel and much smarter, but only time will tell. the cattle dog mix does not get along well with other dogs at all, but i'm working with her. I think not knowing her background and being a pet and then being surrendered to the humane society and then coming into my house has had a big impact on her but She's a great dog and i'm looking forward to owning her for the rest of her life. <br>  <br>  My favorite breed is a cocker spaniel, but i don't really think the breed matters too much, but its the actually personality of the dog.|`|QDQwKbM6aa	I have a Jack Russell so of corse I would pick it! It's my favorite breed! They are very hyper though! But it's much more fun to play with and it's small enough to carry in your arms! They are the smartest breed I know of!|`|gd1uWdLsaa	German shepherd is in my opinion the best dog you can own. You can train them to be anything from a see-in-eye dog to a fierce guard dog.|`|UIueiJnZaa	German Shepherd. They are one of my favourite breeds of dogs. I would hands down get a German Shepherd every time.<br>  <br>  My favourite breeds are Chow Chows, German Shepherds, and Rottweilers.|`|dR8B5AfIaa	i would like either. they are both friendly cute dogs .<br>  My favorite breed of dog is ...... well i like   pugs, and cute little dogs|`|rtt7Vn1Baa	I have 2 JR Pug mix, sisters, i would go with what ever breed fit my situation and we just got lucky as we rescued our girls from the RSPCA they were still very young.|`|eiJOdPgxaa	Would have to be the GSD every time - fab wonderful dogs! And I can't stand small dogs anyhow?!|`|fghatY1waa	My favourite out of the two is the german shepherd, and my favourite three dogs are pomeranians, miniature bull terriers and bull terriers :)|`|FewhKlx9aa	I have owned and trained German Sheperds for 40 yrs and I would'nt compare a JR with a sheperd.I have to say for the large breed dog this is my favorite.|`|W0ZQQK4taa	German Shepherd definitely.<br>  <br>  My favorite breed is Bernese Mountain Dog and German Shepherd Dog. :D|`|qqUvoC5uaa	I would go for the GSD. <br>  Simply because I prefer larger dogs. <br>  Although I do love both breeds.|`|2O58btqxaa	jrt s i have 2 they are Intelligent and loving
xyPpruSjaa	Natalie B: You must be confusing hamsters and gerbils. Gerbils rarely ever fight with eachother!<br>  <br>  <br>  Hi! It is highly recommended you get two! As you probably already learned, they are very social animals and it would be great for them to have a companion and someone to eat, sleep, and play with! Although they do fine on their own. If you plan to have one, make sure you give them a ton of attention and love and give them lots of toys to play with. If you can't devote enough time to a lone gerbil and you have too much to do, you should get two. That way while you're out or doing something, they still have someone to play with. Not all gerbils take being alone too well though, some can develop depression and get very stressed. They can even get sick. I would buy 2 just to be safe, but it's all up to you.<br>  <br>  Good luck! If anyone has any questions or needs any help on gerbils, mice, hamsters, or rats email me at averyrazno@yahoo.com!|`|1YtcGLHraa	wow there is no chance of me getting best answer but here i go! i think you should get 2 gerbils tht grew up together because they can be territorial sometimes and thats why they fought probably but like you said they will do fine alone but they will do better in pairs! i hope i helped|`|xBNhWa6Zaa	Gerbils, unlike many of their cousins need the social interaction of other gerbils in order to live. If a solo gerbil is left alone in the cage it becomes depressed and will die. Introducing new gerbils to an established cage can create territory problems, so getting at least two in the beginning will keep them alive, happy, and friendly. Besides you can only run on a wheel so long before it gets boring.|`|AyFgGoq4aa	Welll.... gerbils do tend to fight when there together.... unless you see them in a cage together as babies, then i wouldn't. Especially if they're different breeds, gerbils hate that. Hop you find the perfect gerbil or gerbils<br>  -Natalie B|`|qfI0aKsDaa	you should get tow because it gives them company,and in the future if u try to put another gerbilin their the first gerbil u bout will attac the new gerbil.|`|UcxNeGeKaa	I too would highly recommend getting a pair, preferably siblings of the same sex. The points 'Beyourself' and 'shygurll' raised were perfect examples of why gerbs love another to live with :3|`|BKJEqaT1aa	You don't need two .<br>  one is fine. i have had one and it was fine, but when i had two ; they had two litters of babys.|`|3hZuYNs2aa	Gerbils are highly social and do not like being alone at all. If you're getting gerbils you must get at least two. Lone gerbils have been proven to live shorter, less healthy lives, and are often overweight and not too happy. They also tend to be harder to tame and less friendly overall. Even if you are home all day, and playing with them constantly, this does not make up for the fact that they must sleep alone, eat alone, and have no one to groom them. So a companion is essential. Both females and males will get along happily with a companion of the same sex, especially if they are siblings or kept together from the age of six to eight weeks old.  it is recommended that the average gerbil owner stick to a pair of gerbils, as the chance of fighting increases with larger groups. Never mix gerbils from two different clans (tanks)!  Should you choose to get two gerbils two different clans (tanks) introduce them through the split cage method.  If they're from the same one make sure they are the same sex as they will mate if not and that is incest.

The poor thing would be much happier in a house where she's free to run and explore.  They're smart and are very easy to litterbox train, so theres no reason to keep her locked up in a cage.|`|pDPSaL37aa	I just got my first rabbit, Shady (about 8 months old), in December and I have 2 cats already, Nala and Salem (10 and 8 years old). The rabbit scares the cats, believe it or not. Shady wants to play and run around with them, but he's too pushy and shoves his nose right in their face, so they run away. Keep in mind it all depends on your cats personality. Some are more aggressive than others. I've also read some stories online about rabbit's attacking the cats. So be careful when introducing them.|`|m32Oq4cfaa	It really depends on the animals themselves.<br>  <br>  I have two cats and two rabbits who live in an open top pen.  One cat couldn't care less about the rabbits.  The other one jumps in the pen and hangs out with them occasionally.  For the most part they ignore one another.|`|28834ea3162329035a24ce080e7020edaa	Yes, you can. I suggest getting a bigger rabbit so that it might be a little safer around cats. As long as they aren't like jumping on its cage or whatever it should be fine. I have barn cats and rabbits, they are all fine.|`|54UnlRQnaa	Yes you can have a pet rabbit and have a pet cat. All you have to do is make sure the cats arnt trying to get him/her.<br>  If you dont know how to take care of rabbits id be happy to help!!|`|m0Tckh3Naa	Yes, you can have a rabbit and the 2 cats but you have to train them to live together. There are a few books and websites that could tell you how to let them live together. Even if they seem to be able to get along with each other well, never leave them alone together. If you're going somewhere and no one can take care of the pets, keep the rabbit somewhere out of the cats' reach.|`|gNDlUxj1aa	Yes, you can have a rabbit with cats.<br>  I would advise keeping the rabbit somewhere the cats cannot get just in-case. Make sure that you monitor the cats while they are around the rabbit, and within a few weeks if everything goes ok, you should be able to trust your cats enough. If a fight were to break out I would suggest keeping the rabbit away from the cats and try not to let them have eye contact with the rabbit. Try to divide your time between them ALL so the don't feel the need to attack the rabbit because your giving it more attention. It also depends on what kind of personality your cats have. Also the rabbit! My friend had a rabbit which used to chase cats.<br>  If your cats have a sort of dominant personality, please dont risk putting the rabbit with it. Good luck!|`|q1vcRgDRaa	Unless you brought the cats and the rabbit up as youngsters in the same place I don't recommend it all it want be fair on the rabbit|`|BGyxjekKaa	My cats LOVE my rabbits.

Ka3fbxszaa	I have a kitty with urinary tract problems. I have researched this topic myself and found a few things that help. Cats aren't typically "big drinkers." Canned food adds extra hydration...I even add a little extra water mixed in. I did invest in a cat fountain which ran about $50. at Petsmart but was worth it for my situation. Here is a site with a few more tips that may help.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.peteducation.com/article.cfm?c=1+1399&aid=1061" rel="nofollow">http://www.peteducation.com/article.cfm?...</a>|`|f5a8d99afbb73cd0703df99b87996901aa	Cut out any dry food.  Feed your kitty a high quality wet food instead.  Try giving some unseasoned chicken broth served lukewarm to enhance the flavor.  You might try using a fountain type water dish or letting kitty drink from the faucet.  Just play with different things till you find what your cat prefers in terms of drinking.|`|256891400379bbbbbce12396d37ae520aa	make sure cat has plenty of fresh water on hand change it twice a day also try some milk twice a week if it does not bother him or her also try juicy can meat,s.|`|KsLm8qg3aa	You could give his dry food with some water in it, that's what I do for my cat.  Wet food given once a day can help, I feed my cat twice a day and he gets wet food in the afternoon.  Chicken broth blocks, I forget what exactly they're called, can be put in a separate dish of water than her regular.  If she has constant water available she shouldn't be dehydrated really bad.  You can tell if she is dehydrated by pinching (not painful pinching, but pulling) the back of her neck.  If the skin doesn't go right back to normal against her neck she's dehydrated.|`|pjOW1Qi3aa	theres really nothing you can do. Just make sure you cat has plenty of water. It'll drink when its thirsty.|`|Qw7ymfakaa	You have got to find out WHY your cat is dehydrated.<br>  What were the other problems your vet found ?|`|IRaIxWJKaa	My 18 year old cat needs extra water for his kidney issues (CRF) so I encourage extra drinking in him.  This means watering down the canned food a little (not too much) before he eats it.  Pouring a cup of water in the bath tub where he likes to dabble, he'll drink some there.  Setting MY water mug down so he can slide his head into it and drink while he doesn't think I see him (our glasses always are more interesting than the water bowl), setting a bowl of water down in the corner of a room that never had one before, anything to get him interesed in doing a littlemore input.<br>  <br>  Pull up on the scruff of your cat's neck. If the skin doesn't snap back in 3 seconds, and stays up a bit, then yes she's dehydrated.  <br>  <br>  You can also get a needle-less syringe from any pharmacist (I got mine free), pull up a half syringe full of water and put 1/4 tsp at a time in the side of her mouth. Not enough to choke her, but enough to make her swallow.  You'll have to scruff her to do it, and don't take a long time doing it,or she'll struggle, but it does help get some more fluids into them.<br>  <br>  I wouldn't recommend giving 2 tablespoons of milk, as that causes diarhea in a lot of cats which would worsen the hydration in her. But if milk doesn't get any bad results from her, you can try a little of that.|`|RN1wGlWWaa	I usually add hot water to my cats' canned food to be sure they drink plenty.  Mine are good drinkers anyway, but its just a little extra.<br>  <br>  Adding a little chicken broth would work too.  I don't think cats would really drink "flavored" water as a normal thing.|`|w1lh1INHaa	Usually, the easiest way is to add water to wet food to make it more gravy-like.  If you are feeding dry, then this is probably one of the reasons for dehydration not to mention a number of other issues, so try switching over to wet food.<br>  <br>  There may not be too much you can do right now, as the dehydration might be the result of one of the other "issues of greater severity."  Not knowing the issues, some of the other recommended ways -- adding a teaspoon of tuna juice or milk to water, a few laps of yogurt, etc. -- might not be appropriate,  so stick with adding water to the wet food.  <br>  <br>  Good luck.
9kceDOTraa	They are not supposed to change color.  Blood Parrots are one of the few true Parrot colors out there.  The ones you see changing in color are those that have been dyed, and usually that dying process tends to have bad health effects and causes those dyed Parrots to live a shortend life.  Those that buy these off colored Parrots only support that practice further as if there is money to be made doing it, then people will keep dying them.
81675c7bcc2aa81478472216e01229f7aa	Urinating when approached is called submissive urination.  The aggressive issue is because she is in heat.  Generally dogs become more aggressive during mating time.  Everything should go back to normal after spaying.|`|54UnlRQnaa	Yes its normal for some dogs. Some dogs just act that way that's all.

If your mother has said NO to getting a dog let it go. Having a dog is like having a 3rd child all of a sudden. It doesn't matter if you and your sister really want a dog. If Mom doesn't want one you aren't going to get one.<br>  <br>  Her house HER rules.<br>  <br>  ADD: Put yourself in your mother's shoes. She has a rent/mortgage to pay, every other bill generated with having a home, and TWO kids. A dog cost an owner on average not including emergencies and illness 900 dollars and up a year.

You have to buy more than one or they get depressed. You can train them to use a litter box, and they rarely bite. They can also learn tricks.|`|yp0GQz5Laa	If your parents said no, you're right it's because they don't think you're responsible enough to have one.  The right way to prove them wrong isn't mimicking what the situation would be like, had you gotten a dog, but to show them that you are responsible now.  I don't know how old you guys are, but a ten year old girl should think about making sure her homework is done all the time, and her room is clean and her teeth are brushed.  I can't see a reason why your parents would say no if they think you are responsible already.|`|g36NU81raa	I don't know, but if you have any friends that have pets, you should offer to help look after them, your parents might get the idea that you are responsible enough.|`|ODcB4zSdaa	The true secret to that is take up more chores around the house. That is a sure fire way to show your have more responsibility. That would be able to work out better really.
FewhKlx9aa	Might be part wolf, but really it could be just boredom or some neurological disorder from bad breeders'|`|GaL66jbQaa	Boredom or an itchy bottom. Probably boredom.  Try taking him for more exercise running, throwing a ball around, agility, toys that dispense their regular food instead of dishes like the tricky treats ball, buster cube, dog pyramid.|`|MYEEK4dcaa	Because  she's bored out of her skull.  Give her mental exercises like the game of "Find it."  Take her to an obedience class, or teach her the basic obedience commands yourself - give her a good half hour, in 5-10 minute sessions, of obedience training every day.<br>  <br>  Give her physical exercises, too.  In addition to chasing tennis balls, she needs at least one, preferably two good long walks AT HEEL every day. By "long" walk, I mean 5 minutes at a time for each month of her age until she's 12 months old - after that you can walk or run her as much as you like.  <br>  <br>  Give her toys like a size appropriate Kong toy filled with peanut butter, yogurt, or squeeze cheese.  Freeze it and give it to her frozen.  It will take her awhile to work all the treat out of the toy.  Give her Rollios to chew on - the 6" size will take her two or three hours to chew up.  Rollios are rolled up cow cheeks.  Don't give her regular rawhide, though.  I swells up in the stomach and can cause obstructions.<br>  <br>  Give her plush toys to carry around in her mouth if she wants to.  Throw tennis balls for her to chase.   <br>  <br>  It's not necessary to entertain your dog all day every day, because she'll spend most of her time sleeping.  But 2 hours a day for walking, plus 30 minutes a day for training, plus another 30-60 minutes playing with you means you'd be spending at most 3-3.5 hours a day with your dog.  Depending on her age, she'll probably be willing to sleep the rest of the time.  Her kong toy and other toys will help to keep her busy.  <br>  <br>  Good luck!<br>  <br>  Apacapacas|`|mLU3DkTKaa	you would be surprised at what being a marble , instead of a marvel , can do for a person , even if that person is a dog .|`|dZCsMyjXaa	You're not very specific, but my best guess is that he's bored and not getting nearly enough exercise or mental stimulation.

7DblI3Xqaa	Some people have had luck with keeping bettas with ottos but personally, I wouldn't add other fish with them.<br>  <br>  A lot of people, including myself, have had luck with keeping snails with them so you could always try adding an apple snail to the tank but you'll have to monitor your betta for the next week or so to see how he takes to the snail.  Some bettas will try to attack it whereas others couldn't care less.|`|IrdZKYT3aa	Depends on the tanks size.<br>  Rasborras, platy, african frogs, cory cats, snails, otto cats, shrimp, these all make great tank mates.  But you never want to crowd a betta, give them space and they usually get along with safe tank mates just fine.<br>  Things like guppies, tetra, barbs, gourami, angel fish and other semi aggressive should never be kept with a betta male.   Anything with  long fins like a male guppu can incite their aggression.  Tetra, barbs and angel fish are fin nippers, and other semi aggressive fish can be dangerouse for the slower moving betta.  Gourami are a close cousin of the betta, and they will often fight as two  male betta would.<br>  And obviouslly other betta's, male or female, are a bad idea.<br>  What you can have and how many depends on the size of the betta's tank.<br>  Goldfish are a bad idea as well. Thier long fins can trigger aggression, and some goldfish are territiorial and harm the betta.  Their waste production alone is a danger to the betta as well, they are prone to ammonia burns on their fins with the excess amonia.  They also  need different water temps, a betta needs to be warm, like other tropical fish, were as a goldfish needs to be cooler.<br>  And as always, your betta's individual personality and temperment will need to be taken into consideration.  Some are fin with other tank mates and other can't be housed with other free simming fish due to over aggression.<br>  Best of Luck!
51St5GEcaa	They're real smart and easy to train. They do have the potential to become blind though. (Every pure breed has a health problem because in order to get specific traits, breeders had to originally inbreed)<br>  <br>  They're great little dogs, but why don't you rescue a puppy from your local shelter or humane society. It's better to save an animal's life than to support pet stores or questionable breeders. Pet stores often get animals from people who are only interested in profit and mistreat their animals. These types of places are called puppy mills, and they are a real problem.|`|tPGxPDvBaa	Very high maintenance for grooming & I haven't groomed one that was healthy. They seem to have a lot of health issues from a small genetic pool. I haven't seen live one  past 10yr in my area. Expect to pay at least for $1500- $2000 easy & still not be quality. Personality wise they seem to be nice playful dogs.  They are a definite buyer beware type breed & requires a lot of research on your part before buying from any breeder.|`|Cfk1kr8Daa	Havanese are very rowdy dogs, but they can also be a bit tougher than they look.  They are *very* active and barky, and sometimes can be pushy.  A lot of dog in a small package!|`|qpc3VtW4aa	A "good type of dog" is very owner dependent.  Looks like you've already found some of the breed specific websites like www.havanese.org, or maybe the American Kennel Club at www.akc.org.  When I was searching for my next dog (and selected the Havanese which I purchased from a reputable breeder who did all the important health testing), I found www.havaneserescue.com and  dogbreedinfo.com, to be helpful also in answering questions like yours.   Every dog has it's own personality, and one person's experience may not be representative of the breed in general.  My 7-month old Havanese can be very mellow and happily hangout for hours while I'm on the computer.  They do want to be with and near their master for as many hours of the day as possible.  They are not a good breed for someone who is gone from the house all day, or doesn't want their dog to follow them everywhere they go.  Havanese are a delightful, loving, intelligent breed that are ideal for someone who will devote time to their training, grooming, and the pleasure of their company.  Havanese shed very little and are good for allergy sufferers, like me.   Good luck with your dog search! (On a side note, most puppies advertised on internet sites are from puppy mills.  They are more likely to have health problems and be the product of a very sad business practice.)
F3LBgfvwaa	I don't know, but let's do what we can to spread the word that animals are not toys, they are living, feeling beings, and report animal abusers to the authorities!|`|44kEtDvIaa	Maybe the questions should be:  Why does our society allow people that abuse their pets even own pets?  And when found that they abuse their pets, why do we allow them to ever own another pet?  And finally, why arent' the penalties far more stricter for those that abuse their pets?|`|CyWCSy45aa	Probably the same reason people who abuse their children keep them. And I don't mean because they have to because technically they don't. They probably think that they have invested to much time and money into them to just get rid of them. Or when they aren't abusing their pets maybe they have some sick twisted love for them at times.<br>  <br>  <br>  Hope that helps it's the only ting I could think of.|`|NLKVrdIKaa	Many people do that through ignorance and trying to  make pets into something that nature never intended them to be.I have actually seen dogs wearing clothes while being walked by their owners.Many people buy a pet and have not taken the time to research it's basic needs and that borderlines on criminal.|`|0UAAqjY8aa	cuz they are stupid selfish people who just get pets to show off.Once they show it off they just abuse it because they are more important.I hate those types of people|`|GHABogjKaa	sometimes they let go of them

It is extremely violent, and many times the females will be injured. I wouldn't attempt it since you are obviously not experienced.|`|hIyjdXr9aa	Here is how betta fish mate, with pictures:  <a href="http://www.bettatalk.com/how_bettas_spawn.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.bettatalk.com/how_bettas_spaw...</a><br>  <br>  Here is the text from that subpage of bettatalk.com:  <br>  "To refresh your memory, both male and female were introduced at the same time in the spawning tank. Female was placed inside a glass chimney and male released in the tank. The first thing that happens is the male sees the female inside her chimney glass and swims towards her, flaring. <br>   If the female is dark bodied and if she is receptive to the male’s display, she will soon have vertical bars on her body. Bettas get vertical bars when they want to spawn (or if they are scared). So, if your female has bars, you are in good shape. But if she does not, don’t be bummed, there is still a chance she will change her mind later she is after all, female !!! LOL !!!! <br>   Male will then look like he is possessed. Basically the testosterones are up the roof :)) !!! He’ll swim like crazy, darting and flaring and attacking the glass, unable to get to the grand price (yet :) ). Meanwhile she is a bit worried but soon figures out he can’t get to her, so she starts teasing him: “Look but don’t touch!” and might even flare back at him :). <br>   Male gets busier still, alternating his showing off macho attitude with frantic building of a nest. The one to the left was so insanely thick I had to take a photo!! He’ll keep blowing bubbles on one hand and huffing and puffing at the female on the other for the next day or two or even more. But as soon as he has built his nest, or got a good head start on it, you should release the damsel. <br>   Then he realizes she is in reach, and she realizes that she can get her little fishie butt kicked, so a lot of confusion will take over the spawning tank. Some pairs may be gentle with each other, other will beat the crap out of one another. Usually, it is the female that gets picked on and after the first bite from the male she starts running for her life. That is normal. He will chase her around and nip her and she will run away for a day or two or even three. <br>   The female will usually figure out a way to hide from him, usually behind the corner filter, heater and of course the bushy plastic plant you have placed inside the tank for her protection. Her fins will be frayed, but usually she will take quite a bit of abuse before being truly endangered. Some males do kill the females though so you need to be the referee and keep a close eye on the honeymooners :) at all times. <br>   Then, out of the blue it seems, she decides she is not scared anymore and she swims up to the nest, checking it out. If she likes what she sees, she allows the male to get close and if all goes well, they start telling each other they like each other: She swims with her head down (often with her fins closed), indicating she is now submissive. He stops beating her up and instead starts swimming in an S like motion, rubbing his body against her (sheeesh this is starting to get a bit risque!!) :))))) <br>   There she is, with her head down, under the nest, ready to start spawning. He tries to figure out the best angle to approach her for the embrace.<br>  <br>   <br>  <br>   <br>   <br>   They often swim in circle, clockwise or counterclockwise, trying different angles and it often takes a while before they figure out how to do it best (some male NEVER do figure it out! Ha!! ) :P<br>  <br>  To the left, the male is too high and she is too low, hence they failed to wrap, and had to try again.<br>  <br>   <br>  <br>   <br>   <br>   They’ll keep trying over and over again for hours until they finally get it right.<br>  <br>   <br>  <br>   <br>  <br>   <br>   <br>   And finally: BINGO!!!! The male successfully wraps his body around the female’s and squeezes hard, they lock in that position for a few seconds, sometimes sinking both at the bottom, still not letting go of each other (how romantic!) :). First few embraces usually produce no eggs, but that doesn’t stop the bettas from having a grand old time. :) <br>   Finally the male releases her and swims away, usually to the bottom of the tank, looking for eggs. She lays motionless, floating pathetically, paralyzed. I am not sure why that happens, but the advantage is that it gives the male a chance to collect most of the eggs before she has a chance to get to them. Some females eat the eggs if they can get them first, but many more actually help place them up the nest with no intention to harm them or gobble them up :). <br>   Well, for now he didn’t find zip so he joins her again under the nest. I remember this male who got side tracked and forgot to go back up, and so after a while the female swam down, nudged him like she was saying “Hey, what about me, huh?”, and then he followed her back up and resumed the spawning!! I was amazed at how much personality she had!! <br>   Again, they circle each other, but now they have one good embrace under their belt, so it comes back naturally and they seem to be a bit more sure footed (or should I say sure finned? ) :))<br>  <br>   <br>  <br>   <br>   <br>   And abracadabra, another embrace!!<br>  <br>  This time he got her just right and she is able to release eggs. While she releases them from her egg spot, he fertilizes them. The eggs often collect inside a fold of her anal fin, and will that will break their fall until she is flipped right side up again, or...<br>  <br>   <br>  <br>   <br>  <br>   <br>   <br>   They will gracefully fall, like little snow flakes, while the bettas are embracing. Here you see him starting to disengage and swim down, he will try to pick up the eggs in his mouth before they even touch the bottom. The eggs are white, uneven, and look like grains of salt. Every embrace can yield a batch of anywhere from 5 to 50 eggs. <br>   Now he is picking them up. Since he has no basket or anything, he uses his mouth. :)) He is NOT eating them silly! (well, but then again, sometimes he is :(( ). He will pick up to 10 eggs at a time and then swim straight up to the nest where he spits them back out, along with a few bubbles, in a neat little package. They stick to the bubbles, and up they stay, awaiting the arrival of more eggs :)).<br>   <br>   He will do as many trips as necessary to insure that all eggs have been placed in the nest. As I said before, many females will gladly participate in the collecting and storing of the eggs. It is sweet to see them working side by side. Of course it usually takes a while for the female to come out of her temporary paralysis and get to work, so she usually will only bring a few eggs back to the nest. <br>   Then they do it again, and again and again… Every time, a new batch of eggs is added to the previous batch, and the pile of eggs gets bigger and bigger and bigger.<br>  <br>   <br>  <br>   <br>  <br>   <br>   <br>   Up to 500 eggs can be produced that way. If the embrace is tight, like the one to the left, the eggs are likely to be fertile. If the embrace is a half *** job :), then the eggs will not be fertilized properly and will not hatch. They will usually be eaten by the male who keeps the nest clean (see next section). Unfertile eggs will fungus and may infect the good eggs if not removed. <br>   The spawning process can take anywhere from 2 to 10 hours, so when does one know when they are done? It is easy: the female will release less and less eggs (left) and then she will release none. At that point the male figures he can’t get anything more out of her and chases her away (figures!! :) ). (oh, just kidding guys, where is your sense of humor? :) ). She will hide in the far back and if she comes out to the open he will chase her away as though she is the devil itself. <br>   At this point, it would be a good idea to remove the female and put her in a clean jar with some bettamax, to prevent her injured fins/body from getting infected. Feed her well, pamper her and do not spawn her again for at least 3 weeks. Mr. Betta is now king of the spawning tank. He has posted himself under the bubble nest and will not budge from under there for the next few days. "|`|3zg7oBA5aa	You have to feed them a variety of foods, and keep the female in a tank next to the male.  After a few weeks, the male will build a bubble nest ( a bunch of bubbles at the surface of the water ) and the female can be added.<br>  <br>  Usually, you don't leave the female in for longer than a day. After that you take the female out, and the male betta will care for the babies. they will fall from the next, and he will scoop them up and put them back into the bubble nest.<br>  <br>  once the betta babies are free-swimming, the daddy should be removed from the tank.<br>  <br>  the bettas will spawn more than 100 fry.. usually, so you need to be prepared to home each of them, also to be able to separate the male babies once they are aggressive.<br>  <br>  the babies should be fed several different LIVE foods.<br>  <br>  breeding these bettas really shouldn't be something you do on a whim. there are so many petstore bettas, you wont be able to home most of them<br>  <br>  your bettas should be in heated tanks, not little cups. please do research on the fish before you try sticking two aggressive fish into one small, most likely cold tank to get babies.<br>  <br>  if you do your research think about buying a quality pair on aquabid.com  <br>  <br>  also if you don't know what cycling is please do not breed fish until you understand the basic things. <br>  <br>  ok good luck with that|`|drzN1kkuaa	Beta fish fight, so you shouldn't of put them together.<br>  Unless you want one dead.|`|JwDWwgIcaa	.................*shrugs*<br>  <br>  ;D|`|pf5G6ssJaa	you put a girl in a contain floatin in the tank<br>  you let the male swim free<br>   the male will bullie her around flaring and pushin her maybe a bite here and there<br>  then your girl will get verical lines the male will blow a bubble nest<br>  the male will wrape  around the girl nd squezz the babys out  he will place them in the bubble nest<br>  if you have more questions message me|`|SKlG4geZaa	I saw a program describing how they did it and showing it...

There is no reason for our dog to have this.  It is not a balanced diet for a dog at all.  Bread and yogurt???  Your dog needs to be fed dog food, not people food. <br>  <br>  For occasional bouts of diarrhea, you can give your dog Kaopectate - .1 ml per pound.  For example, a 20# dog would get 2 ml.  You can repeat the dose every 6-8 hours.  However, if the diet is poor (which it sounds like it is), you need to change what you are feeding the dog.|`|Xyj4nmFnaa	To start you need to remove food fo 24 hours to get whatever has upset your dog out of its system but always provide clean fresh water then feed small amounts of dried food and build the amount up gradually until back to normal.

Dogs don't need people food, it gives stomach problems and doesn't give them all the right nutrition.
c65cd00cdb08dcd6d402f3bc9dea83d9aa	How much do you know about them? Why do you want one?  Do not just get one because they are cute.  These dogs are very intelligent, will outsmart their owners when given the chance, are stubborn, and high energy.  They are not for everyone.  They require a lot of training, not because they aren't smart.  Well, let me rephrase that.  The OWNER needs a lot of training.  Search for The Misanthropic Shiba, that site tells it like it is, and believe every single word of it, even if it does seem funny.|`|KYC0pmH6aa	Shiba's are amazing dogs.<br>  <br>  Smart, shed moderatly, they do bark but every dog does. And barking can be humanly changed. ((not by de-barking them or shock collars, but by old school training))<br>  <br>  They are loyal, medium sized, and affectionate.|`|6SeWCfUfaa	I find Shibas to be ... stubborn.  They're sweet, and neat dogs, but they're not the easiest breed to train imo.|`|AA10717089	I have an eight year old shiba.  I think they are wonderful!  They typically housebreak effortlessly and do not shed very much, other than when they are blowing coat.  They blow coat 1-2 times a year, and it is A LOT of hair.  Shibas typically do not bark as much as other daogs, however, a lot of them do howl or yodel when they are happy to see you.  They get between 20-30 pounds, and can be stubborn, but are very trainable.  They are runners, so you will have to have a secure yard or plan on keeping them on a leash.  Otherwise, I love my shiba and they will love you very much in return.  Please consider adoption.  I do volunteer work for a rescue and you may contact me if you are interested in checking out rescue dogs.  Good luck!|`|nuFCByKJaa	yess there soo cute and very smartt ;)
IRaIxWJKaa	You're none of you picking up on the signals he's giving that he doesn't want to have that much body contact at the moment, so he has to resort to struggling and biting.  <br>  <br>  Not every cat want's to be loved and squeezed to death.  Not any more than you would want a visiting aunt to grab and hug you and not let you go.  Give the cat a break!<br>  <br>  Talk to him, let him see your hand before touching him.  If he pulls back, don't touch, give him some space.  By not inflicting physical contact on him when he doesn't want it he can relax a little and give you more contact on his terms.  Nobody can force him to  love you, but YOU can work with him to make him more at ease with you and feel better about it.  He needs his personal space too, just like everyone else.|`|yxJKgf9Faa	hiya try not to invade his personal space to much he may simply not like to be picked up spend some time bonding with him you can do this through grooming if he will allow you and also playing with him with toys or string give him treats occasionally to show him you love him.....cats love food! and then when he starts to calm down and enjoy your company then try to pick him up <br>  <br>  good luck and hope this helps x
o93EwErKaa	It sounds more like a false pregnancy, than an actual pregnancy.  Dogs who are actually pregnant do not baby toys, like those dealing with a false pregnancy.  If she is lactating you will have to keep an eye on her because she can get mastitis.  False pregnancies usually repeat themselves and she is at a higher risk of developing pyometra (very serious uterine infection) so it is better to get her spayed.  Also, take away the toys she is mothering.|`|PM23RDycaa	take her to the vet tomorrow and have her examined. Only a vet can tell you for sure if she is pregnant or not.

Every dog is different as to when they start to produce milk. Some may start a week before whelping, some a few days before. Some even wait until they whelp, but 4 weeks is really early. she may either be further along then you think, or going through a false pregnancy. Good luck!
683d3c2192385bf25fb38d1cc4aadeb9aa	First, try to calm down about it - you have to remember that the dog is learning from you and the problem usually isn't the dog, but the trainer. <br>  <br>  How big is the crate? Maybe try a smaller crate and give the dog less room to go potty in the crate and still be able to get away from it. Also, is there food and water in the crate? Toys? Give him a good reason NOT to go in his crate. <br>  <br>  You can also do some searching online for crate training. There are good videos on youtube, too.|`|XagPxe7Faa	It sounds like maybe the crate you are using is too big.  If the dog has enough room to 'get away' from any mess he creates in the crate, then it's too big.

He also probably needs worming badly, which is something that you can do yourself.

1WmDOPGtaa	A Rescue Organization, as opposed to a shelter, would be your best bet.  Mom absolutely must go with the pups, at least until they are old enough to be weened.  Then find a low cost spay/neuter facility in your area and get the rest of your animals fixed.  The rescue could probably point you in the right direction.<br>  <br>  Edited to add: Absolutely do NOT sell or give away these puppies (except to turn them over to a qualified Rescue) until they can be checked by a vet, dewormed, and vaccinated.  You haven't stated how old they are, but if under 7-8 weeks they are too young to be separated from their mother and the rest of the litter anyway.<br>  <br>  Edited one more time: Here's a list of shelters and rescues in Tennessee.

9kceDOTraa	Now additional details come in from the question you asked, but deleted. <br>  <br>  First things first is that South Americans should not be housed with Africans.  In addition to the completely opposite water needs, the size most South Americans grow to cause problems for the smaller Africans in most cases.<br>  <br>  As I mentioned in the question you deleted, and you still do not say the size of the tank you are keeping these in, tank size matters.  I like Marcus's point in that you need a big tank and as I told you before, you shouldn't be trying to keep a stock like this in anything under 200 gallons.<br>  <br>  Moving those Africans in with the Dempsey isn't an option neither.  The Africans belong in their own tank.<br>  <br>  "will the convicts and oscars fight?"  Dude you need to worry about the gender of those 2 Oscars and mention what size tank you're attempting to house all these fish in.  Down the road, once those male and female Convicts pair up and start breeding, they will, as again I said before, be problems even for Oscars.  Those Africans should you leave them in there, since they are Malawi Mbuna and tend to dwell in the substrate are going to get harassed quite a bit as well.  MOVE THEM.<br>  <br>  Hard to say what's going on with these female Convicts without actually being able to see what you describe, but it's not uncommon for female Convicts to  be aggressive even against males.  In your best interest, either get a very large tank for all your South Americans, or begin to seperate them into groups.  And get those Africans in their own tank as well.  Cannot completely answer your aggression issues without seeing what you are talking about.<br>  <br>  I'm not going to have a debate about proper keeping, I'm just telling you for your own good, if you took a 1000 tanks and mixed SA's with Africans, it's not going to work out at least in 750 of those tanks.  Your 55 gallon tank is NOT enough space to hold all that anyways.  You need at least a 90 for an Oscar pair alone, forget about tank mates.  If you aren't going to listen to more experienced keepers that know what they are doing, why you wasting everyones time?  To see some moron tell you what you want to hear as if that will make it right?|`|ur5wDhkMaa	The Oscars will grow an inch per month in their first year. In US gallons your tank is a shade too small for one Oscar in 6 months from now.<br>  <br>  Massively overstocked is your biggest problem. Basically the single Jack Dempsey would be OK on its own. Oscars don't tend to eat Convicts very often, but they can. If you want to keep the labs everything else has to go.<br>  <br>  You need to research each of the fish you have and decide what you want to keep or buy a tank 10 times bigger than what you have.

The domestic shorthair should not be confused with the American Shorthair, which is a Cat Fanciers' Association (CFA) recognized breed.<br>  <br>  Domestic shorthaired cats are characterized by a wide range of coloring and typically 'revert to type' after a few generations, which means they express their coats as a tabby. This can be any color or combination of colors. They also exhibit a wide range of physical characteristics and, as a result, domestic shorthaired cats in different countries tend to look different in body shape and size, as they are working from differing gene pools. DSH cats in Asia tend to have a build similar to a purebred Siamese cat or Tonkinese cat, while European and American varieties have a thicker, heavier build.<br>  <br>  Check out this link for more helpful information and photos: <a href="http://www.mycatspace.com/me/FluffyandRomeo/blog/2009-01-28Cat-Breed-Slideshow" rel="nofollow">http://www.mycatspace.com/me/FluffyandRo...</a>|`|OrBxTe9aaa	It would help if you put a picture or a description we have no idea what your cat looks like so we cant help much.<br>  heres a website with cat breeds and pictures thats all i can do.<br>  <a href="http://www.catchannel.com/breeds/b_landing.aspx" rel="nofollow">http://www.catchannel.com/breeds/b_landi...</a>|`|ZQxCcG6qaa	can you be a little more descriptive about your cat? is it a curly haired, long haired or short hair...color, facial feature? most people have American Shorthairs unless the went to a breeder or found a different breed at a shelter|`|cfKCR4Reaa	Look on Google Images and type in descriptive details about your cat and you are sure to find out.|`|KsLm8qg3aa	A furry one, I'd imagine.|`|nZ4u47ZVaa	can't really answer that w/o a picture... or discription lol
LAXxaxAZaa	Mane n Tail works great, and it's not that expensive. I think it's about 30 bucks for a gallon.|`|RUzBDX6Jaa	vegtamable (vegtable lol) oil.  Add a teaspoon or so to its grain.  The horse won't not eat it, because the smell wont bother them and neither will the taste :P|`|XsBIITFvaa	Veggie oil. Just a teaspoon in their feed everyday and you'll see a big difference. Also, the best thing you can use when bathing is mix the shampoo and water in a bucket, and squeeze some baby oil into the bucket and mix it up good. I do this before every show and I haven't found a better product. It makes them look cleaner than show sheen. So yea, that's the cards up my sleeve.|`|vfhKkiSKaa	Add some vegetable oil to your horses feed every day.  It works wonders.<br>  <br>  Do you do a good grooming on him everyday (not just a quick brushdown)?  The better you groom the softer and shinier his coat will be.  It brings out the oils in their coat.|`|EghHVkHEaa	Vegetable oil does wonders to every horses coat. You can use it in the winter, but i use mine in the summer.<br>  <br>  Add it to their grain.|`|K4bJgTF4aa	clip him. then spend a long time brushing him. bathing him too often only takes oils out whereas brushing him spreads the oils he needs through his coat thus making him look shiny.|`|yY6Aj1xpaa	Make sure your horse has been thoroughly wormed; You'll never have a great haircoat from a wormy horse.  Feed a haircoat/hoof supplement which will improve your horse's haircoat and hoof wall quality.  Brush that haircoat every day.  Keep your horses mane and tail clean and conditioned.

81675c7bcc2aa81478472216e01229f7aa	Yes to both of your questions.  Husky's and Shepherd's shed profusely.  You can minimize shedding by brushing 2 to 3 times a week.  Your dog will need at least 2 hours of good exercise every day.|`|lTsDwY9Paa	I have a Husky mixed with I think German Shepherd. She sheds moderately but with mix it can vary from dog to dog. She needs a medium amount of exercise and can be quite lazy at times.|`|MYEEK4dcaa	Your dog needs two kinds of exercise: physical and mental.  For mental stimulation, take your dog to an obedience class, to an agility class, a freestyle dance class, or any one of a number of other things that will challenge her mentally.  Teach her to "find it."  She tracks things you hide in the yard or house after you give her a chance to smell it and get the scent.  When you're teaching her to do this, be sure to put the object where she can see it.  As she learns, make it harder and harder to find.<br>  <br>  For physical stimulation, take her for at least one, preferably two, long walks AT HEEL every single day.  By "long walks" I mean at least 5 minutes of walking for each month of your dog's life until she's 12 months old.  Some dogs will need longer walks than this; this number is just for the average-energy dog.  <br>  <br>  She'll be a medium-shedding dog - you can brush her every day to help alleviate this problem.  And you'll have to teach her that you're the pack leader.  If you don't know how to do this, there are books on the market that can help.  One that immediately comes to mind is "Be The Pack Leader" by Cesar Millan and Melissa Jo Pelletier.<br>  <br>  Good luck!<br>  <br>  Apacapacas.|`|54UnlRQnaa	NOT AS MUCH AS SOME PEOPLE THINK. THOSE kind of dogs only need 1-2 walks a day. They need alot of attention though. Try playing with him/her. Try the game fetch, or take the dog to the park and run around with him/her. also you could train him/her (bring at 4or  more treats with you if you are going to train the dog)|`|hTT8DhYfaa	oh my gosh yes!! like crazy!!<br>  <br>  yes, they are very active, especially in the winter. if its hot during the summer where you live, he'll shed a TON! husky's are alaskan, so they like the cold and arent used to hot. german shepherds shed normally.|`|IRaIxWJKaa	A huge yes to both of those.  Definately, no question.|`|nBehRANyaa	Yes, I would expect a GSD x Husky to shed a *lot* and need lots of exercise and training.  Both are smart, high-energy, high-shedding breeds.
wq6lfHIBaa	I don't think it has anything to do with his health issues although its a good idea to talk to a Doctor about that, but it sounds like he (your brother in law) is pretty close to the end of his live, let him enjoy his cats while he can, he is going through a lot...believe me i work on a cardiac unit at a hospital and i see a lot of people that are REALLY sick and they still worry about there beloved pets at home...... I wouldn't worry about it much and like i said keep him happy and dont rob him of his life... good luck and best wishes your families way!!!|`|qXciQ9xBaa	Cats can have a parasite, Toxoplasmosis, in the stools which can infect pregnanty women and newborns and cause problems. Otherwise no real risk.|`|IRaIxWJKaa	Cat urine toxic?  No it's not.  Litter boxes won't be either. I'm assuming that someone else is cleaning the boxes, not him.  Just breathing it in won't hurt anyone.  Immersing your hands and feet into cat poop may cause an infection in a cut, but come on, nobody is going to do that.<br>  <br>  A diabetic person is looking at a lot of problems with their body especially if they have restricted blood flow--that often causes foot problems (my dad has that right now and his mother did before him) as well as organ problems.  This is the body doing it to itself with internal imbalances. It would not be a result of litter boxes or pets.  Looking to blame the cats is like blaming the car or the bathtub.|`|51St5GEcaa	don't use clay litter. it hurts everyone's lungs, including your cats. and change litter every day, or start finding homes for at least 18 of those cats.
3120pXzcaa	You should explain everything to the vet and he/she will tell you what they can do to help your cat. she probably will be put down. sorry.|`|KELBedyiaa	She's still very young for a cat.  Are you keeping her litter box clean?  Are their any other cats living with her? Is she fixed?<br>  <br>  As for the food you can buy dry food and wet it with hot water and let it sit a bit (so it isn't so hot) before offering it to her.  The water will soften the food.  It's a lot cheaper this way.<br>  <br>  If you don't want her anymore I would recommend finding a no kill shelter and let them try to rehome her.  She's very young to be put to sleep in my honest opinion.|`|dZCsMyjXaa	Only you will know when your cat's quality of life is no longer very good.|`|FfNjsqGvaa	Well it all comes down to quality of life. I say that it would be time.|`|LuJmGEW1aa	yeahhhh i think so because do you want her to die of like starvation or just being put to sleep i think you should just do what your heart tells you|`|9WMgb4phaa	No|`|8SbKEkBKaa	my mom just went through this last month with her 15 year old cat. she still had all her teeth but wouldn't eat hard food. then she stopped eating soft food. she left her "accidents" all over the carpet. she also became really skinny. i told my mom i thought she had kitty cancer and she should put her to sleep. she seemed to be suffering. but my mom refused. it was about a month later that she died. a vet could run tests to find out what's wrong with your cat. it would cost a lot. being that she's already 11 years old i think it's ok to put her to sleep. although my mom would argue that's inhumane. you'll know when enough is enough and maybe by then she'll pass away on her own.|`|IRaIxWJKaa	Let me get this straight---NO vet trips for the past five years?????<br>  <br>  Eleven is NOT old in a cat. She's got medical issues that you are not taking care of if she's lost all her teeth at this point and it's too painful for her to eat dry food anymore.  I have a cat who has no teeth (stomatitis, they needed to be pulled) who eats large chunk dry food without a problem.  He eats anything, but I do have to cut the baked chicken up for him as he can't slice into that, it won't gum apart for him.  <br>  <br>  Your cat needs her mouth checked thoroughly to make sure there's no mouth ulcers in there. Also as to why she can't eat dry food.<br>  <br>  The pee and pooping are issues that something is not right with her.  IT CAN BE TREATABLE but you won't know this till you get her in for that needed checkup. A vet will not put her down without your permission.  The constant meowing is her trying to tell you she needs help. Get this poor cat in to be checked.  Waiting till she is too far gone and dies is animal abuse.<br>  <br>  Assuming a cat is always healthy is like us assuming we'll never get a cold, toothache, broken bone, cuts & bruises or earraches after one doctor appointment five years ago.  Get real!  Things happen.|`|f2oT96vkaa	This depends alot on how much you feel about the cat.  We've had a cat that lived to be 15 he had very few teeth, smelled awful, and did not look healthy but we couldn't bring him to the vet to be put down because we didn't know how long he would live and he had lived there his whole life and was comfurtable there.  So when he did die he did it in a place that he wanted to die because cats usually seek out places that they like to die. So this is mainly up to you if you feel you cat is suffering and want to put her down the do so.|`|yjKFRBwsaa	it doesnt sound like she is suffering. but if the situation worsens, then i would see what a vet would say, not people who have emotional attatchments to animals. vets do these things all the time, so it would be better to ask him/her what to do.<br>  <br>  hope this helps and i hope your cat does better.<br>  BOB|`|WQuWDPq6aa	hello i was going thew the same probable m but she didn't make it long enough so she died....yes you should but give her a kiss and say goodbye then take her to the vet and get her cremated and get her ashes then you will feel much better and you cat will to..she wont suffer and neither will you!|`|suj2U7j6aa	well to tell you the truth if she seems so miserable than it's best to not let her suffer any longer. the meowing might be cries of pain.it's probably best to say you loving good buys and do whats best for her<br>  <br>  <br>                  good luck|`|GihaDT3Vaa	Do what you think is the best, so she wont suffer|`|SXnaB4iOaa	A vet will put her down.  A few years ago my cat was perfectly healthy, but she then got diabetes.  We fed her soft food with medicine in it and it worked for a while.  Then she got colin cancer and was throwing up all the nutritious stuff and was hungry all of the time which caused her to meow constantly.  If you've taken her to the vet recently and they say she's healthy, then she probably is.  The cause for meowing could be hunger but it could also be that she just really likes the food you are feeding her.  Any animal is going to get excited and want more of something they enjoy.  The peeing and defecating could just from old age.  My cat did the same, but she started as a territorial thing.  If your cat has lost a lot of weight recently and is having diarrhea and is throwing up I would recommend taking her to the vet.|`|Amkmles0aa	no|`|Oo3PC1yQaa	I'd say yes. Especially because of the peeing and defecating on the carpet, which signals a severe kidney problem. I'd put her out of misery.|`|KsLm8qg3aa	Do you know why she won't go in a litter pan?  Our 10+ cats still went in the litter pan as they aged.  Maybe shop around for better wet food.  If you read the ingredients you should only see 1 or 2 non-meat products.  The first 3 however should be meats.  Just because it has a fancy label doesn't mean it's good.  See the vet if you're worried she's not living a quality life.  You'll also find sometimes canned food with crappy labels has better ingredients and is cheaper.|`|xHq5jfNtaa	She sounds in a pretty bad way, although eleven isn't so old for a cat these days. My cat is 17. I recommend taking to her vet for a consultation before resorting to having her put down, as they may be able to suggest something.|`|8584e0329fb17c662606d5a6a8650ee2aa	If your cat has not been to a vet in five years, you haven't been caring for it properly.  She has dental disease because her teeth have not been taken care of and she may have other health problems. Get your cat to a vet for a proper health workup and find out what needs to be done and if there are things that can be done to make her quality of life better.  Your cat would likely be a lot healthier if you had acted sooner - sorry, but what you have done amounts to negligence.  If you couldn't care for her, you should have found her a better home before it came to this.|`|iYzmnIsJaa	NO.  TAKE YOUR CAT TO A VET FOR MEDICAL TREATMENT first and find out what is going on with her.   She may just have a urinary tract infection that makes it painful for her, so she doesn't bother going to the litter box.  Work out a payment plan with the vet if her condition is treatable.  <br>  <br>  You have had 11 years to go to a library and get books on cats, or look information up on the internet.  Shame on you for not attempting to learn about the animal you took into your life.  That is an important responsibility.  You owe your animal good quality food, good medical care, a check up EVERY YEAR so the vet checks teeth, heart rate, etc. and you keep your animal from getting into prolonged serious medical trouble at too early an age.  <br>  <br>  11 is young for a cat.  Get her to a vet, and hopefully your neglect can be turned around so she can have 7 - 9 more years of better quality life.<br>  <br>  If you are too lazy to face up to taking better care of your pet, ask your vet to help you find someone who will.  Contact no-kill shelters.
tT256JQRaa	you could wipe him down with a damp cloth, but not bathe him entirely.<br>  <br>  you also might want to but a tub of sand/chinchilla dust in his house for him to wash himself in - sand baths keep them clean, and my genbils loved it! <br>  entertainment for hours - it keeps them clean and they enjoy digging in it :)|`|xyPpruSjaa	It's not necessary to completely bathe him. Actually, baths aren't good for gerbils. Wipe him with a damp but warm wash cloth. I hope I helped!<br>  <br>  If you need any help or have any questions email me at averyrazno@yahoo.com!|`|CeEnwf9Vaa	DO NOT bathe him!!!! I have asked the vet if it is something that can be done and he said NO WAY so you may just want to take a warm wash cloth that is damp and wipe him clean. but do not try to give him a bath . it might kill him. I do not want you to think I am shouting at you but I don't want you to bathe him . He is in a precarious state right now. A warm damp wash cloth is the best thing for him now.|`|mRevWUxlaa	I know this is a serious question but...... HAHAHAHAHAHAAAAAAAAAAAAAAHAAAAHHHHHHAAAA... That was the funniest question Ive seen on this site in a long time now. Yeah, use a damp cloth with warm water on it and rub the fur lightly. Dont use shampoo or soap. Good Luck and THANX for the laugh!!!!|`|UcxNeGeKaa	The warm washcloth is a good idea, and I wouldn't worry too much if he is not completely clean, he will clean himself throughly later, or his cagemates will :)|`|1YtcGLHraa	ok then but still water doesnt clean butter very well if he is still a little greasy put a little bit of kitten, puppy,, or baby shampoo on a washcloth and then rinse the fur lightly with a warm damp washcloth|`|qfI0aKsDaa	allsoo you can give him a boder bath just sprinca some on him and rub is in do th at fore about 3 days
zWACtmiIaa	Well, first of all-you need to know how to make him stop bucking after he starts. When he bucks ride him in a circle or if for some reason you can't-give him something to do. Go over trotting poles, make zig zags, anything to keep him on his toes. <br>  <br>  Once he is done bucking keep doing whatever it is you were doing. Don't walk if you were trotting-this will only reward him! <br>  <br>  If you fall off get right back on! And if you're too scared to trot or canter again, get someone to lead you around the ring at a trot.<br>  <br>  Just be persistant, and don't let him get away with anything!|`|RUzBDX6Jaa	Show confidence.  Each time he does that, circle him, kick him, yell at him, boot him like crazy!  Do whatever it takes.  He needs to learn some respect!|`|1UKWQytVaa	My horse used to do the exact same thing. I was scared at first, kind of letting him win, almost. But after time, i learned that if he does that, i have got to just lay down the rules to him. When he does it now, (which is not often) i give him a big pop on the shoulder or butt with a whip/crop. Show confidence! Dont Be scared, cuz hes just testing you, i agree wilth your trainer. My horse did it to, and now he respects me. Hope i helped!|`|96InprHCaa	you might check if he's hurting somewhere, my horse once did this, but instead of bucking, she wouldn't go, would just stand there for hours until I finally got off, then the vet checked her up, and her hind right leg had a clot of some kind. Either that, or shes tryin to test u, young horses do that|`|GksOStrsaa	Get a vet check. He could have a back problem or something.  If not, tough it out until he stops but show him you're not taking any sass from him- get mad. If all else fails, get some sort of apparatus(i don't know exactly what you would use) or such so he can't get his head down to buck.|`|ejj2N3uaaa	Pain and issues with saddle fit can definitely cause this behavior, so I would definitely check those areas (a good, thorough vet exam wouldn't hurt) first.<br>  <br>  If that's ruled out, it's very possible he is just testing you. My gelding--also 5, almost 6--has done the same thing, but he's gotten better. If that's the case, forcing him through it is really your best option. If you allow him to stop or walk every time he bucks (or get off and put him up), you teach him that his behavior equals less work. Next time you ask him to trot/canter, if he bucks, push him forward (if that means kick him forward, do so). Don't worry so much about whether he's looking good or moving correctly, just GO. It may mean you have to go faster than usual or his head will be out of place...so be it. Keep going until he'll give you a decent trot/canter without the bucking, then let him walk and praise him. Repeat as needed. I had the bad habit of stopping my horse with every buck (after all, I didn't want to get bucked off) and then starting over. It didn't help. One day I decided I'd just make him do it. We basically galloped a couple of laps around the arena and then he quit, so I stopped. The next day, he started the same way and I repeated the process. It didn't take as long for him to quit this time. The next day he didn't even try it. <br>  <br>  Young horses tend to go through crazy phases that you never thought your horse would go through (ie, him being fine until this month). It's annoying and frustrating but if you can get him through it, it won't last. Good luck!|`|8QuASgEKaa	it sounds like he may be just testing. hut if he isn't....... check his feet. any rocks? do his feet need to be trimmed/ shod again? is the bit pinching his mouth? is the saddle pad too thin, not providing enough support? are there irritating objects on the pad (hay, bedding, ...)? is he confused? getting mixed signals? your position on his body hurting him? is the saddle's tree broken or cracked?|`|xMDBd4IUaa	I'm training a 5 year old too, and he also bucks, but only on grass and wide open spaces, is it just in certain places he does it? i just usually ride through it and keep his head up as much as i can, but sometimes it's not as easy as that, he could just be temper mentall, and as your trainer said "is testing you", hes coming into his 'teens' and will be a bit more of a handful than usual, or he could have a serious problem like a bad back. If it is just him being silly, You could try lunging him before you ride him to get him all relaxed, maybe you could try doing alot of serpentining in walk, it all depends on the horse, some things work on some horses and dont work on others. If it is his back, a vet is needed, he will give you advice on what to do. The old owner of my horse used to get a physiotherapist and acupuncture to relax his back muscles, this could help, but personally, unless the horse really needs it, its a waste of money. Furthermore, i had a welsh who bucked ALOT, and i got a thing called a Grass rein, this is a strip of leather that attaches to the D rings on your saddle and goes up the neck and attaches to the top of the bridle, this means the horse cannot get his head down, and is unable to buck. Its not one of those bearing rein things that makes the horse hold its head high in an uncomfortable position, because its loose enough for movement, just not enough for them to put there head down. i hope this helps, and im sorry if anyone disagrees with my methods. :)
zZsoiKnRaa	I have had a dachshund for 6 years and yes they are very much in the US. I can give you a bit of advise about them but i dont know about the other two. <br>  They are great for a house with a yard OR a smaller apartment<br>  They like to burrow under the covers or pillows or your arm<br>  They can get fat really easy if you let them<br>  They are super great dogs with kids and other people if raised friendly and around people<br>  <br>  Our dog has always been great with our 3 kids and any other animals!|`|I68m0kCraa	Since all 3 dogs are very different, the only person who can make that decision is you.

4b31970139fae7ffcd45274496b0b199aa	Try flushin her eye with some warm water, this may help . Its possible her eye is irritated from hair inside, this often happens to my poodle. If it dosent get better take her to see a vet asap, she may need medicine, or a quick test about 25 bucks to see if she scratched the (cornea) top layer of her eye.|`|IZz6mkOFaa	She might hace scratched it ...so you mudt take her to a vet to get some eye meds for it.  Until than you can put a little triple antibiotic on your finger to warm up and than very carefully place it in her eye...even vaseline will help to take the irritation away til you can get her to a vet.<br>  Good luck|`|Qj6aWfrlaa	is the pink in her eye or eye lid? You can try polysporin for the eyes, just get it at the drug store, I have used it on my dog, works like a charm! If it does not clear up after a week take her to the vet!|`|bTw5gRzuaa	vet right away.<br>  in the mean time, i would put an e-collar on her - those big cone things ( you can get them at petsmart), so she wont make her eye worse.  but go to the vet right away.|`|IEsudy2xaa	take her to a vets asap my yorkie had an eye infection and he scratched so much he lost the hair round his eyes the vet told me it was an allergy but he is as good as new now thanks mrs browne  the vet|`|9de4d4275acc64f60112c7ba0abfd388aa	No but you can by taking her to the vet asap.<br>  <a href="http://pethealth.petwellbeing.com/wiki/Dog_Pink_Eye" rel="nofollow">http://pethealth.petwellbeing.com/wiki/D...</a>|`|1ECm7WYeaa	Go see a docter|`|AA11244754	1) you DO know that when you type in all caps that is considered yelling so stop it!, 2) take the dog to the vet!|`|DU0F48B3aa	try a vet|`|itiJVgRsaa	get a eye cleansing rinse solution like saline and squirt in her eye to rinse. she might be scratching cuz there is something foreign in her eye that she cannot remove. if that doesn't work than go to vet. it's not infected unless it is oozing or secreting stuff. is it? then take her to vet for infection cuz no OTC method is going to help her.|`|p7oi3P06aa	no but you can. take her to the vet.|`|VsSI1Rc9aa	either call a vet or take her to one.<br>  look in the yellow pages or on google to get a place and number|`|SxUKHL6gaa	GO TO THE VET!
rLDf1gGGaa	If a puppy does not teeth on your possesions, it will teeth on you and your children. Rescuers often get calls from panicked parents sure their dog is about to seriously injure their children.  It usually turns out the puppy is just doing what puppies do, i.e., mouth or nip. Parents, too emotional to see the difference, just want to get rid of the dog.  A growing puppy is going to put anything and everything in their mouth. It must be taught bite inhibition. As the puppy grows, the puppy's jaws become stronger and its teeth are replaced by its adult teeth.  The mouthing and nipping it did as a puppy now can have serious consequences.  Far better to get an adult dog 2years + that has "been there, done that, moved on."<br>  <br>  Temperament:   Of the hunting breeds, the Clumber Spaniel is the most low-key and easy-going. They are gentle, sweet, and highly intelligent. A pleasant and well-behaved dog, they get along with other dogs, cats, and other household animals they are raised with. They typically become attached to one specific person in their family. Clumber Spaniels are generally good with children. They do not easily befriend strangers, but are never timid or aggressive. This breed greatly enjoys human companionship and attention.<br>  <br>  Activity:   Clumber Spaniels are equally suited for apartment or residential dwellings. They require daily exercise such as brisk walks, being bicycling companions, chasing a ball, or swimming. Failure to provide sufficient exercise will cause this breed to become overweight, have muscle atrophy, and shorten their life span.<br>  <br>  Adopt and Save a life
k9gC23apaa	Sometimes dogs dogs/pups will eat dirt because they are lacking something in their diet.  If your pup is not on a high quality diet, this may be your problem.  Check foods out like Royal Canin, Eukanuba they are priced kind of high, but great foods.  If on a lower budget try Iams and or Science Diet- good quality food for the buck !  And if you do switch foods, may sure to gradually switch over, meaning First and second day 3/4 old food and 1/4 new food, third day 1/2 and 1/2 , get what I'm saying, After a week you should be transitioned on the new food.  Good Luck !|`|WXCa8zQoaa	either a spray bottle or you pull him away and make it clear to him that's not ok such as raising your voice|`|lTsDwY9Paa	He may be lacking something in his diet. What food do you feed?|`|BfBMRlNNaa	He's just a baby trying different things out. I wouldn't be too worried about it. Just tell him to stop when he does it and try to get his attention onto something else. Chances are he will grow out of it pretty quickly!|`|L0LUGdc3aa	Well the good news is, dirt is not harmful to your puppy unless you've used fertilizer or snail-be-gone on it. :)|`|f17af46bdaf6cbc8a29dc6ea5a56b808aa	<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Op4xCixZrOs" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Op4xCixZr...</a>
o93EwErKaa	A lot of times Chis need C-sections, especially if the Pom is larger.  It would be best to take her to a vet and get an x-ray to determine the number and size of the pups.  Your vet can give you a good idea as to if he thinks the dog can deliver naturally.  If the pup(s) are too big to pass through the birth canal, then you can lose the puppies and the mom in the process.  I would never allow a dog to be unattended, especially a small dog.  Even if she is able to give birth naturally, small dogs tend to panic and run around and just leave the puppies in random places unattended and they will chill quickly and pass away.  If you really love this dog, find the money for a vet, give the dog to a shelter or someone who has the means to care for her properly.|`|PM23RDycaa	Sighs* This is why you get your dog's fixed. Dogs are only pregnant 9 weeks. Hell a c-section WHICH she could need is anywhere from 1-3 thousand dollars.<br>  <br>  NEVER assume your dog can safely give birth by herself. If you can't provide her with proper care and supervision surrender her to a small breed rescue or a no kill shelter.|`|q2CPBbWnaa	No, you don't have to go to the vet. My beagle gave birth to 6 healthy puppies right at home, all you need is a blanket and you let the mother do the work. She will eat the placenta then lick the puppies.|`|Cfk1kr8Daa	Your dog  could easily die trying to deliver these puppies.<br>  <br>   If you cannot afford proper vet care, you should contact a small dog rescue, and hand her over to them, along with your Pomeranian.|`|KXzUgTE0aa	Your dogs should of been fixed.|`|Eejkizedaa	you need to take care the puppies.
