20090222160413AAEiAa2	Politics & Government;Law & Ethics	Circumcision: Do you think that parents have a right to violate the bodies of their male children?	There is a law in the United States that protects the "BODILY INTEGRITY" of females but males don't have that protection. That law was passed to protect females from circumcision.       Yes most female circumcisions are much worse than male circumcisions but the integrity of the child is still being violated for no medical reason.       No matter what people say in favor of circumcision, it has been proven by ALL major medical organizations that there are no significant health benefits and they no long recommend routine circumcusion of males.       What parents are not being told about are the worst possible complications. For a list of these complications including burried penis, loss of glans and loss of entire penis,   http://www.circumcisionquotes.com/compli...  Warning, this site has graphic photos, but necessary to show the horrors of these complications.      There is a good video by Dr. Dean Adell at  http://nocirc.org/       Also on the site is a slideshow history of circumcision in the USA giving the stupid reasons doctors gave for having infants circumcised, when I say STUPID, you'll just have to see for yourself, "cures epilepsy, prevents spinal paralysis, and many more, as late as 1969 as a cure for masturbation and nervousness.   http://www.icgi.org/medicalization/#Page...

20090222160454AAtif6X	Politics & Government;Other - Politics & Government	Can you help with economic question ?	A country with a great balanced economy (Country A) and with a wealth of natural resources decides to suddenly layoff most of its citizens and send their jobs to a poor country (Country B) cause the poor country's citizens will work for slave wages.     This increases the wages of a small percentage of citizens of Country A.  But heceforth, nearly every manufactured good purchased in country A is made in country B.  Suddenly Country B which had a medieval economy suddenly starts building factories left and right and enticing even more jobs to leave country A to come to Country B.  As the income of a few prosperous citizens of country A rise, they are greatly surprised to learn that their taxes have been significantly cut so that these few people get wealthy beyond their wilders dreams.  Meanwhile most of the citizens of Country A are out of work or are forced to make ends meet by doing some sort of fast food work, or some menial service job, etc.. In Country B  meanwhile a middle class is beginning to grow and people that used to have ox carts are suddenly starting to buy cars.      AS we extrapolate this scenario......what does the future hold for these 2 countries when you consider where each country was economically when the changes started happening?

20090222160634AA5VGtL	Politics & Government;Law & Ethics	Children in state cps/dfs custody...help?	In january of last year a my ex husband was able to win a modification of custody and he was awarded primary custody of my daughters.  My defense was that my ex husband was not able to hold a job, a place to live and that he deligently worked to turn my children against me.  During the trial my ex husband told MANY lies and he was caught in 3.  However, due to my children stating that they would rather live with him he was awarded custody.  So, mind you...I was NOT deemed an unfit mother, the judge took what my kids said into consideration and allowed them to go with their father.  In October 8 months later my oldest daughter witnessed my ex husband molesting one of her friends that was spending the night. My daughter told me this and I called the child's mother and told her.   The child victim then stated that on another day he picked her up while her parents were not home and sexually molested her.   The mother called the police and my ex was arrested.  At this time I had my children with me.  When he was released child protection had him sign a safety plan that was valid for one month stating that the children would remain with me.  When the 30 day period was up my ex husband came to take my children back.  I called cps/dfs and told them what was happening.   They informed me that they were no longer on the case and that if I didn't allow him to have my children that I could very well end up in jail.  So, I was forced to give my children back to this child molester.  Not more than 3 days later cps/dfs went and took my children into protective custody.   They have now been in foster care for 1 month. DFS/CPS say that they do not deal in child custody and because of this they can not put my children into my home.     A psycological evaluation was ordered on both of us.   The psycological evaluation and sexual predator evaluation  on my ex husband came back extremely bad.  The G.A.L and family workers now say that reunification with my ex husband is out of the question and that they can not reccommend that the children ever be returned to him and that my children are to remain in states custody until I get custody of my children or a year in which time they can be adopted out.  Now mind you!!! I have NEVER been proven unfit!  I have a beautiful home, a good life, and a very stable marriage.  I am a good mother.   The judge that would handle the custody case is the same judge handling the foster care case and the same judge that awarded custody of my daughters to my ex husband just a few months prior.  I know this sounds paranoid...but I have great reason to believe that this judge does not like me.  When I appeared in court while they were showing evidence of why my children should not be given back to my ex husband.  I asked the judge how I could get my children out of foster care and he yelled  at me and said "we already tried that and it didn't work!"  I really feel that this judge feels responsible for handing my children to a pedophile and now instead of making things right, he is going to keep my children from my custody just to prove that he was never wrong.  I know I sound paranoid.  I'm very scared that my children are going to remain in the custody of the state and there is nothing I can do about it.  Please someone, offer me advice.  I do have a lawyer but I really feel like this small town is corrupt lawyers working with judges and vice versa.  Someone please help me.  I feel as though the state is trying to kidnap my children legally and I am at a loss.

Common Sense lived by simple, sound financial policies (don't spend more   than you can earn) and reliable strategies (adults, not children, are in   charge).      His health began to deteriorate rapidly when well-intentioned but   overbearing regulations were set in place.      Reports of a 6-year-old boy charged with sexual harassment for kissing a   classmate; teens suspend ed from school for using mouthwash after lunch; and   a teacher fired for   reprimanding an unruly student, only worsened his condition.      Common Sense lost ground when parents attacked teachers for doing the job   that they themselves had failed to do in disciplining their unruly children.      It declined even further when schools were required to get parental consent   to administer sun lotion or an aspirin to a student; but could not inform   parents when a student became pregnant and wanted to have an abortion.      Common Sense lost the will to live as the churches became businesses; and   criminals received better treatment than their victims.      Common Sense took a beating when you couldn't defend yourself from a   burglar in your own home and the burglar could sue you for assault.      Common Sense finally gave up the will to live, after a woman failed to   realize that a st eaming cup of coffee was hot. She spilled a little in her   lap, and was pro mptly awarded a huge settlement.      Common Sense was preceded in death, by his parents, Truth and Trust, by his   wife, Discretion, by his daughter, Responsibility, and by his son, Reason.      He is survived by his 4 stepbrothers;   I Know My Rights   I Want It Now   Someone Else Is To Blame   I'm A Victim      Not many attended his funeral because so few realized he was gone. If you   still remember him, pass this on. If not, join the majority and do nothing.      Amen
20090222110743AAWkFpq	Politics & Government;Military	Questions about Air Force Pararescue?	I'm 22 and just graduated college with a Bachelor of Science degree in Chemistry. I have been wanting to join the Air Force ever since I was little but decided to go to college first because my family insisted on it. I did the whole college thing and it was ehh, but I really want to do something more exciting with my life. Anyway, I am really interested in Pararescue. I have read up plenty about Pararescue and it really seems like everything I have ever wanted to do in life. I am aware of how difficult it is to get into but I have a question that I am hoping someone can answer.      Since I have a bachelors degree I know I can be commissioned as an officer. If I am planning to try out for the PAST test for Pararescue once I enter the Air Force, does it matter if I am commissioned as an officer or do I have to be enlisted or does it not matter? What I really want to know is if it is better for me to join the air force as an officer or an enlisted if I am interested in Pararescue.       Thanks so much and also feel free to share anything else about Pararescue that isn't really stated on the Pararescue website.

20090222114626AAEt9Yg	Politics & Government;Military	I am in the USN IRR and I got a mysterious FedEx package from Tennessee (am I getting recalled?)?	Hello, I am in the IRR for the navy, I was a corpsman and deployed with a marine infantry unit to fallujah, Iraq in 05, I got hurt many times  with concussions, anyways, I got out on march 08 and filed for a VA claim, I got my disability rating in December 09 for 80%, on January I got this letter from the IRR saying that I was selected for an annual muster in June and stated clearly that it is not for mobilization or a recall. after I received this letter I updated my info in the nko site and put that I had 80% dis. so the next day a "petty officer" calls me to confirm about the disability.       The same day I called the muster people to find out where and when and so they told me, I also let them know that I had 80% and they said that it didn't matter for the muster, so I agreed to go.      However, someone (unknown sender) from Tennessee have tried to send me a mysterious package (twice now), that require my signature, I did research on it, and found out that the first was delivered from Lebanon, tn, and the second from Nashville, tn. I have requested to send them back because I refuse to sign anything (however I think it is the mil, because only they use my last name hyphenated).      I have heard that the military is very slick in doing this, they send an unknown package, you sign it, and inside the package you get your orders for recall. However I am not sure if this is it.      And if so, what can I do, why are they doing this, what are they hiding?      So does any of you have a clue whats going on?, and if I get orders, should I file for an exemption or a medical discharge?      Thank you

We need to eject this people from our party as soon as is humanly possible.

Would you open up your private medical records to the federal, state, or local government for ANY reason? Do you think anyone should ever be compelled to release their medical records to the government? And please, what is your political affiliation?      I personally would NEVER support the compelling of any person to open their medical records for any reason, even under the most extreme circumstances. I believe every citizen has the right to complete medical privacy.      I am a Republican/Libertarian.  But I think this is an issue most people would feel the same about. I know the ACLU would be up in arms if the government was trying to pull some crap like that.

I voted for Bush and I was not happy at how much he expanded the government. We need to be united amongst ourselves, not divided between the two parties. If we allow the governments and media to create divisions so easily, we need to be careful of what they can do with that power, regardless of who's in office. What are some issues, ideas, etc that everyone can unite for? I sometimes think the governement provokes "in-fighting" among us to keep us distracted from their growing power.

I took the ASVAB a year ago and did poorly on it, then again I did not place myself in the mindset to be prepared to take the test, nor did I study any prior information about the test or spend time with the study guides.  The result:  My AFQT was 42, and the area in which I want to get the highest number in is electronics which I scored a 60 in.  I am really good with fixing computers or anything electronics so that's what I really want to get into.  My dad was an avionics tech in the marines so I want to make him proud since my studies are similar to his.  So, for the past 2 months I have been rigorously studying between 5 different ASVAB study guides in the math, arithmatic reasoning, general science, and electronics information sections.  I am worried that I may not be able to boost my score to 70 (which is the qualifying score for air force electronics jobs).  Lately I've been getting 50% of the practice test questions correct in all 4 areas.  Would you think this is good enough to boost my electronics score to a 70 or greater?  I have some doubts but my confidence is higher than my doubts.  It just seems when I complete a test I'll see another question that I want to study for just so I have a little extra knowledge.  Lots of my friends tell me to just go take the test.. anyone got any thoughts/advice?

20090222182401AA2DP45	Politics & Government;Civic Participation	Will you join me in boycotting companies that raised prices during the gas crisis, but now...?	....have not lowered them in response to dropping gas prices?      This has gotten out of hand. Understandably, we as the consumers are expected to sympathize with the fact that the rising price of fuel put many companies in the position of raising prices, to offset the escalating fuel prices.       However, what about when fuel prices drop? Have those same companies become sympathetic of the customers and the effects of the economic downturn?      The media seems to have adored playing the violin for companies (like insurance companies for instance) in response to the economic crunch, that has been growing, FOR YEARS.       You'd think half the nation was out perpetrating insurance fraud, from some of the stories we've seen.       Though NOT ONE news program has covered the fact that as gas price decrease, there is no decrease to (already previously) inflated pricing of goods and services!      Will you join me in taking action against these companies?   Will you write to them telling them that you will be boycotting their goods and services, until we see a change back to affordable standards that were previously in place!       From packaged food being reduced in size/volume and being priced higher, to ridiculous surcharge from phone companies!      Are you aware that if we move as a single unit we ill be invincible to the machine that attempts to crush us?      Will you join me, or will you simply stand in the field chewing your cud and baaaaaaaing in compliance with the forces that want to exploit your need and fears?

I do, I think the government should ONLY have to be responsible for 1, or 2 children. any beyond that, and the irresponsible parents should be held accountable, financially.I say this because My cousin is pregnant with her 7th child,she has NO JOB. her  husband works as little as possible.and yet all her kids have insurance, welfare and  FOOD STAMPS up the WAZOO. and she wants more.... so she can continue to get more welfare. I work full time, and My husband works full time. We have 2 kids that we are struggling to raise on our own.How is this FAIR?

20090222172908AAWkwcO	Politics & Government;Politics	When will conservatives just cut to the chase and come out for outright criminalization of poverty?	Not to pick on him, but Mr. Bill G, the top answerer in this section, just answered one of my questions regarding UHC; specifically, the cost of ER visits to the uninsured:      "This outrageous theft of service by those who cannot afford the care they steal should be punished as the crime it so obviously is."      Wow. Unless I have misunderstood this (and I don't think I have, as others posted similar comments), according to him, if you don't have insurance and get taken to the ER after an accident, you're a criminal.      Now, since an ER bill is a debt, the implication there is that anyone who defaults on a debt is committing a crime. This stands in direct opposition to the system of bankruptcy put in place by our nation's founders, who were very much against the feudalistic system of debtor's prisons in Britain. But hey, they're entitled to their opinion.      The point is that what Bill G and others are advocating is nothing less than the outright criminalization of poverty. When do you think conservatives will stop with the drug war, opposition to UHC, support for legalized usury, etc., and come out and support making poverty illegal?

As the interstate was coming closer I was slowing down. A cop had pulled over another car and was in midst of  some  investigation and this was 0.4 miles before the ramp. The cop car had flashing lights and  was interrogating the pulled over car. When I  went  past this cop car, the cop threw light onto my car using his torch. I failed to understand his purpose for doing that and could not understand if he wanted me to pull over. So I went a little ahead and pulled over my car. I was waiting for the cop to approach me as I think it is not  advisable to pop out of car. After waiting for like 3 mins I failed to understand what he wanted to tell me as the cop did not approach my car. I thought perhaps he threw the torch light towards me just to ensure that I do not crash into them. Not knowing what to do, I just started my car again at a slow speed and reached home.       What would you do if this happens to you. Would you just continue  waiting or just move along?

Should Omar Khadr Be Released   this is a question that is particularily important in question   if you want backround info on Omar Khadr and what he did look here...       http://davidakin.blogware.com/blog/_arch...       basically he was born in Canada, he joined a terroist group and grenaded US soilders in Afghanistan      he was captured and was sent to Guantanimo      now that Obama is closing Guantanimo down the Canadaian government does not know what to do with him      the reason being is because Canada signed a UN protocal which basically states that anyone under the age of 18 no matter if they are in a terroist group or not are considered victoms      so what should Canada do, should they realse Omar Khadr with nothing at all      or should Canada too should punish Omar Khadr      arguments on release include    1. he was only 15 when he was sent to guantanimo   2. he has been punished enough   3. It was canada's fault in the beginning for allowing the United States deal with Omar Khadr and not dealing with the problem themselves      arguments against his release include   1.what he did was wrong therefore he should be punished   2.There is too much evidence against Khadr to release him   3.Canada looks soft, and should exercise its power to prove that Canada does have restrictions and is not so soft   4.Need to keep good relations with allies (United States)   5.We need to respect the legitament concearns of the citizens of Canada and protect their rights      i know i know these arguments are pretty lame   i just have to make a speech on this at school and would like to hear what people have to say      do you believe that Omar Khadr should be released or not   please give a neutral prespective      if you can add on to any of the arguments i have written plese do.      Thx :)!!!!!!!!!!!

With Obama passing this huge stimulus package for huge government spending, with talk about nationalizing the banks, and with talk about socialized medicine ... is the government overreacting to the private sector?      Shouldn't the government just cut taxes in the private sector and let the recession ride out on it's own?

Can you get in trouble if you sent someone a message on myspace saying that they were a dumb *** hoe and ****** in the head (as in stupid), and they printed it out and and gave it to the principal and one of my teachers? I only said it one time, because what happened was I asked for her phone number in real life and she said that I am never getting her phone number. She thought that I was trying to hook up with her but I wasn't, I was only trying to be her friend and maybe call her everyone once and a while and say whats up. Anyways I wrote that message on myspace and she said that she is going to print it out and give it to the principal and one of my teachers on monday. I am scared because I am on probation and I can't get suspended. Im 14 in 9th grade. Also, I only sent the message once so i dont think its harrassment.
