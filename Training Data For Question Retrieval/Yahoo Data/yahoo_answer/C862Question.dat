I'm asking because I'm trying to decide between buying a $3000 used car and saving to buy a new one in one year or buying a new one with $5000 cash back ('08 suzuki xl 7: paying $23000 instead of $28000) and pay it off in 12 months.      2. what is the best way to get a reliable cheap used car of about $2500 to $3000 that will not need repairs for 3 years.      3. Also, can one buy/finance a home with only two years of credit history, 6 months of employment history with salary of $7000/month, a credit score of 750?      Summary: 'Should I rent an apartment and buy a $2500 used car now and get a new home and car in 3 years or should I just go ahead and get the new car now and home because (a) if I rent an apartment, after two to three years, I would have payed over $20000 in rent (that would have gone into paying for the home) (b) if I buy a $2500 car now, after two to three years, the trade in value will be close to zero, I might as well get a new one now and pay it off in 12 month.   I need suggestions.

I am a 15 year old student (Year 10) living in Hertfordshire, England. And I have started to consider which careers I wish to do when I am older.      I get A* in English, and am predicted A-A*'s in my exams.   I am working at grade B-C level in Maths.   I am also predicted B's-C's in Science.   I also get A*'s in History and Geography.      Although I am doing ok in Maths, it is still my weaker subject. Probably because I do not enjoy it quite as much. I love English, because of the writing and reading involved. I also love History and Geography because I get high grades in my essays and coursework. Writing is my strongest point.      I am really interested in teaching. And am working in a school next week for work experience. However, journalism also looks very good. And I wish to go to university. Which career would you say suits me? I don't mind doing a little maths if it really means I have to. Are there any other careers besides teaching and journalism which would suit me, which I may not have heard/thought of? And what grades the career requires and what courses/paths I will need to take?      Thank you very much :)

We have a great relationship going.  I help out...she knocks off money for rent.  I always pay early.  Very good relationship.       She's been away on business for a few months now and she had an additional roomate move in.  No problem...she said she was looking for another one.  Now that I'm well trusted and stuff, she lets me make the rent deposits for her.  Which I like because I hate having outstanding checks.      But...the roomates first check bounced.  Oops.  And now that I'm trying to make a deposit for February and get everything she owes, she's trying to give me $500 cash now, $500 cash frida and a check for the rest on friday.  Apparently she's having problems with her direct deposit (been the same story every time).        I'm not accepting partial payment unless my landlord says to.  I'm waiting for an email back from her.  But what do you think about this?        Do you think this roomate probably cant affor the rent and we should probably get rid of her?   She's a 60something year old lady.        Any sort of insight or advice is appreciate.  I'm a property manager of 10 years...but not this kind.  Thanks and sorry for the lengthy question!

I'd go through long phases where I explode over the smallest thing. It got me suspended during high school, restricted to online courses in college, lost me some friends, and recently got me fired. A coworker at Wal-Mart said on Jan 4th that she came to a cartful of apparels returns. She thought it was from me, and when I tried to explain it was from the overnight crew, she didn't believe me, so I exploded, verbally abused her, said all kinds of horrible things even though she said it's no bid deal. She went to mgmt about me "harrassing" her. Four days later, I was still unable to get past it, so I punched the pole in the fitting room in front of customers, one of whom reported me. Mgmt said it was workplace violence, accused me of endangering ppl, and fired me. They said ceiling tiles coulda fallen and hit someone and cause serious damage. However, they said I'm eligible for rehire and may apply after 90 days. What are my chances if I do reapply? If I choose to get a job at another company, will I even be considered? I get alot of work done on the sales floor, sometimes more than other depts, where I helped out occasionally. Also, I didn't ask to have an anger problem. I was born that way.

She is in her 40s and she told me that she never trusted pensions. So when she never wanted to contribute to corporate pensions schemes. When she was promoted to management in a previous job, membership was compulsory so she had no choice. The day she left, she withdrew her contributions. She said many of her friends thought she was crazy, she told me 'the idea of giving all my savings to someone or some organisation, telling them I'd see them in 40 years & ask them to return it in tact with a good return doesn't make sense. I never trust anyone with my cash'. I asked her what she does with it..she said 'I have my own thing going on'. Is she a bit crazy or really wise?
20090220105641AAr2Xvw	Business & Finance;Careers & Employment;Other - Careers & Employment	Is this career transition even possible?	I have worked in both technical jobs (10 years as a QA Engineer) and administrative jobs (5 years as a Senior Administrative Assistant) and the administrative career path is by far the best fit for me. I had my resume professionally written to highlight my administrative skills/experience and downplay my technical experience and have posted it to many job sites and have applied to several HUNDRED administrative job postings in my area that fit my skills/experience.      The result is that I had two interviews and in both instances the interviewer looked at me and said "but you are an engineer, why would you want to do administrative work?" After I explained that while I learned a lot from my technical jobs, I received the most job satisfaction from my administrative positions in which I was able to contribute to the success of other people and be part of a team effort.      One person looked at me like I was out of my mind and the other one looked like she did not believe a word I was saying - has anyone ever been able to transition from a technical career to an administrative career?  Any help would be greatly appreciated!      Thanks

20090220120231AAifqVy	Business & Finance;Careers & Employment;Other - Careers & Employment	My boss is holding me back from making career!?	I was in competition with my current boss for the supervisor job one year ago. My strengths were my knowledge of the department and sound decision making. His was supposedly his people management skill. I haven't seen any of it yet.       My problem to this day is that he really is not capable and relies so much on me that every time I tell him I would like to apply for another job within the company he finds me negative points which I haven't. Even worse is that he makes a transfer of his own mistakes on me.      I believe he is afraid for others to see that he is a fraud. For my last review I hold back till the end that I was applying for another job to avoid him coloring my review. I got a very good review until I told him about my prospects. He then came back on his words. The next day I received the written review which did not match our conversation...it turned out negative for my current application. Allegations like "jumps to conclusion too fast" and " lack of credibility" were added while it is completely untrue.      does this sound familiar...what should I do?

20090220072749AAyh95V	Business & Finance;Taxes;United States	Are my taxes being filed wrong?	I made, I think, about $25,000 last year and put $2,000 into Federal taxes and about $450 into State. (my dad didn't finish mine, yet, he's been working on it for 2 months, now. But it's only a single income return with no credits or deductible donations, etc.)   My boyfriend made $11,000 put $1,000 into federal taxes and is getting all of it back.  (his were done in less than a day)      We are both filing as independent.  Neither of us have houses or kids.      For 2007 returns I put at least $1,500 into federal tax and only got back $400. But my boyfriend has always gotten all of his money back, in full. Whereas I am lucky to get 1/4 of it back.      The question I posted previous to this one, the 2 answers I got didn't make sense because they said if you make more than $9,000 then you won't get it all back, but my boyfriend made 11k and is getting it ALL back.      So how come my boyfriend gets it all back, but I only get 20% of my taxes back? And how come it takes him a day to do it on paper, yet my dad does it online and it takes him over 3 months for 5 out of 7 of the people in our family? (I lived in an apartment by myself in 2008 and will move into a different apartment in a couple months, but he refuses to let me have someone else do my taxes.)  He does not claim me as a dependent.  I am filed as independent.

Here's our situation.  My husband, individually, earns more than $75,000.  As a couple we earn less than $125,000.  However, before he and I married I owned a home and sold it a year ago.      How can we get the tax break?  If he buys the house individually, he won't get the break because he earns too much.  If we buy it together, we might not be eligible because I am not a first time home buyer.        Any advice?
