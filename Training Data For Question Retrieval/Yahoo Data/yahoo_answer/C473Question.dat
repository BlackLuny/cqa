Our neighborhood gets power outages on a regular basis, including two this year that were extended (7 days in the summer, and 36 hours in the winter). I never want to go through this again, especially in the winter months. We're building our dream home in a few years and I would like to have the capability to heat our house with wood. We will probably do mostly solar power, but I'd like to have a back up. I've discovered that, when it comes to heating your home, most traditional fireplaces are a joke. I know some people use wood burning stoves for heat, are there any regular type fireplaces that will put out heat? What do I have to know for when I plan my new home? Are there any good websites or books that will help me with this?

Or just tell me how you deal with house work and stuff. I have no clue on how to be a good house wife and one day I will need to know, because I'm getting to that sort of age.

But it has a plug that goes into it that I have never seen before. It looks like a normal plug, but instead of the plugs going up and down, they go side to side with the ground in the middle. Has anyone seen this and do you know what it's called. Can I get an adapter to plug into my generator? Thanks

20090130202021AAdIzi6	Home & Garden;Maintenance & Repairs	Finished Basement under home? Manufactured home already in place? Construction?	I am looking at having a basement put under a 28x56 modular home. I found someone to dig and put up block, but was wondering if anyone had any suggestions. Is there an easier way? And I am sure that there are other things that have to be done to have a finished basement. I am sure the contractor knows what he is doing. I just want to know all of my options before I jump into anything. I do not want to waste alot of money if it will be damp all the time. not get done right, etc.I have tried to look online, but am unable to find an AtoZ or step by step guide with options. ANY help will be appreciated. Thanks
