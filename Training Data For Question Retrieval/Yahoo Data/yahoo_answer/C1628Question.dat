He says that it's easy for an American to hide and disappear in Mexico . . . forever (assuming they got into Mexico legally).  He says it's because the police don't enforce the law very well, and there's alot of deserts and small towns.   I told him it might work for a while, but because tourist cards max out after 180 days, and the fact that you speak english (assuming you don't know spanish that well), you'll get caught being there for too long, and get deported.   Would it be possible for someone to run away to Mexico, and stay there regardless of tourist cards and problems with hablas espanol, and they haven't broken any American laws?

20090227083153AApWCua	Travel;United States;Los Angeles	Looking at becoming an au pair in Los Angeles, is there anything anyone can tell me that would help?	I would like to spend time working abroad, and as I have experience in childcare, becoming an au pair is ideal for me. I have narrowed down the area to California, and as close to Los Angeles as possible, as a family friend lives out there and I could get assistance if I needed it.      As a "non-native", are there any particular pros and cons about being an au pair in Los Angeles? As I currently live in London, I am used to expensive areas, so the cost of living is not a massive consideration at this time. I just would like to know what LA is like to live in if you have never visited before? Are there particular areas that are best to focus on, and ones to avoid? Also, what kind of social life is there in said areas?      Additionally, I need some information about relocation costs. I'm realistic, I know it's going to cost me money for flights and a visa and other costs, but if anyone has done something similar to this, I would be grateful for an average figure as to how much money I might need to get behind me before making concrete plans to go.      Really, anything anyone can help me with would be great, so thanks in advance.

I dont really know what I want to do when I graduate, but I think it would be really cool to travel, whether it be for free, or somehow make money. How would I go about traveling the world, like maybe backpacking and such? Are their any websites that could educate me further, and please dont say google. I know it is dangerous to be trusting people if they let you stay a day or two with them, but I dont really see any other way to do it. Do chores for food/bed. If you know of any jobs, or volunteer organizations that I could join, or maybe a career that would be good that involves travel, that would be greatly appriciated. I am only fluent in English, and I feel I am a very good people person.

20090227100805AA4FwYJ	Travel;Travel (General);Other - Destinations	Why can I only search Travelocity prices on Yahoo Travel?	This is half question, half vent.  I use Yahoo Travel pretty often to compare prices from multiple sites, which I like so that I don't have to have a ton of browsers open at the same time to look up airfare, but today it only lets me see prices listed by Travelocity.  What the hell?  If I only wanted to see the prices for Travelocity, I would've gone directly to their website.      Is there a setting I can change to fix this.        If Yahoo has some sort of special deal with Travelocity, it makes me wonder if I can trust their price comparisons.  I guess it's back to having 5 browsers running at once.  {{sigh}}
