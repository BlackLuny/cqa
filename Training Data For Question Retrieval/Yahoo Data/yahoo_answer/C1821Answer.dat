You can use GIMP (free) for that.  Writing the site is called developing it, and you do that with a text editor.  Some of them make it easier than others (Kompozer, for instance), but you still have to know what you're doing - HTML, CSS, probably some Javascript, the document object model, the difference between server-side code and client-side code - if you're using anything but a "click-and-drag" type of program.  And those will give you a site that looks clicked and dragged.    It *IS* easy - once you know how to do it.  It's not difficult to develop a good-looking site if you don't know how - it's impossible.  Learning is free - there are good tutorials all over the web.  You can get the equivalent of many college degrees by learning how to use a search engine.  But expecting a program to do it all will disappoint you.  The result won't be worth the effort (not to mention the price - a few thousand dollars if you buy all the commercial programs you'll need).    Don't even THINK of using a Microsoft product to create a web page - most of them produce garbage that only Microsoft web servers (the VAST minority on the web) can handle.|`|ed19f781db6070432d50b72c2a862dfaaa	You will need to buy a program to do this for you.

Right click on ''computer'' then ''properties'' it usually tells how much memory you have. 1 GB is equal to 1024 megabytes. Depending on your OS the value of the memory can differ. Vista needs quite a lot of memory to work stable, if your memory is low for your current OS, it's optional for you to install some. RAM is hardware, not software. So you can't download it.|`|iBrlojt4aa	You didn't mention the device but if it's a computer with windows on it let me tell you how to find this. There are 2 ways  1. Go to START and right click on MY COMPUTER icon and click on PROPERTIES. In the GENERAL tab of SYSTEM PROPERTIES you will find the memory as XXX MB of RAM or XX GB of RAM where XXX is the approx amount of memory. For ex. on my computer which has 512MB of RAM it shows 504MB of RAM (NB not 512MB as 8 MB is used by internal graphic card).  2. You could also find the exact memory by going into BIOS settings but accessing bios depends on the computer/motherboard & model you are using. You could go to the support site of the computer/motherboard and get info regarding "how to access BIOS".

SNBG0Y5eaa	Without actually seeing it, it's hard to tell what it could be.   If you can't select, then it's not an object (line drawn on the page, frame, etc.), so it's got to be formatting.  The only other thing you didn't mention was maybe it's a background color.  Select the area and reset the background color and shading to none.    The other thing to try is just reset borders too. Sometimes it doesn't pick up the border setting on the controls if you have the wrong thing selected, but as long as you have the entire area selected, you can toggle it back to none and it'll reset it.

You can create another blog at this address using the Google Account you're currently logged in.

After you delete the blog, all the posts and comments disappear, but the blog's address instantly becomes available.    If you want delete a Gmail account, it's much more complicated. Google asks your password and it doesn't delete the account instantly. What's more, the address can't be reused and you won't be able to retrieve your messages.    For Google, deleting a blog is infinitely less important than deleting an email address, even though they're both ways to communicate with someone. Deleting a blog has many more side-effects for a bigger audience: broken links, broken hearts, less relevant search results, an entire context that disappears.    For the search, google eventualy will take that away, dont woryr it is not inmediate. It can take 3 or 4 days depending on how often google spidered your blog.

The rest of your computer seems to be about the same vintage, actually a bit older :)      It will handle Starcraft, Quake, the Sims, Command and Conquer, Warcraft II etc - most game titles up through maybe 2003. It's got enough horsepower for World of Warcraft... That is, if you can play WoW with just 480mb of RAM.  It's possible that your system is using 32mb for video memory and by installing that card you'll recover that RAM and have 512mb.|`|n68rcu9Naa	Well I have a build that has onboard geforce 7050 graphics. It could max World of Warcraft with high setttings. From my experience with nvidia I have owned a 5500FX, 6200, 8800GT etc.    It should play it good depends how good graphics are. Don't get let down though if when playing Total War it will suck because there is so many units.    You could play games like source engine, unreal engine 2

RMGsv00Baa	No computer in the world is immune to viruses. Some OS like linux or mac do not have viruses simply because nobody makes virus for them. But now linux and mac are gaining popularity, so sooner or later there will be viruses for them too. As for your virtual memory problem, you can solve it by following these steps.    1. Right click my computer, click on properties.  2. Select the performance tab in that window  3. Under the virtual memory panel, click on change  4. Set the virtual memory to any value you like (double that of available ram is a good value, but if you have very little ram, set it to 1024 mb as starting and 1500 as maximum size)  5. Press the set button.  6. Restart if you are asked to.  7. Your virtual memory woes are over.  8. If not you are probable infected by some virus (get rid of them)    As for your harddrive, you can use tools that make use of SMART to asses your harddrive.  a simple tool is http://www.compuapps.com/Download/downlo...  if it says ok, then your hard drive may chug on for some more time.    And 7 years is an awful lot of time for a pc. If the pc was a person i would say he was 150 yrs old...|`|AA11027014	generally, after 5-6 yrs, its  time to start looking for a new comp or new comp parts. if its a desktop, u can simply replace everything inside of it. new hard drive, new RAM, new motherboard, etc. just keep the computer case itself. "building ur own comp" is generally much cheaper than buying a desktop. go to ur local compputer/electronic store and ask them what parts u should buy or just ask a computer nerd friend of urs. but if u wanna buy a comp...    apples are pretty safe as far as viruses go but unless ur like a designer, a filmer, an artist or going to work with a lot of photoshop, u dont rlly need an apple or its outrageous price tag. go with a good pc company, like hp, asus, or dell, for general tasks, games, business, and just about everything. i have an asus laptop and it was such a BARGAIN for its specs. so there u go.|`|5ca75672cdf5c0a56be5e785cba499c8aa	If it's seven years old that a 100yrs.in the age of electronics.It has been a good and faithful servant, but it's definitely time for an upgrade.Now is a good time,the prices are really down now because of our dire economic downturn.Go, now is the time for a very good deal.Be frugal,remember your in the drivers seat here.They don't only want your business....they NEED IT.|`|LpCDltJMaa	Well, it all depends on your needs, if you think that you need better computer resources buy a new one, if your needs for the computer are still the same once you bought the computer 7 years ago, you can still be using it, with some tweaks, like increase of the RAM or new hard drive, since it started grinding means it will not be living long.. And for Apple it is a virus-free environment, but not immune to viruses, you still can catch a virus if you do not have any protection on your computer.. But it is way better than Windows when it comes to security against viruses.    To fix the low virtual memory, just go to start --> run type msconfig and go to the start up tab, uncheck the programs you do not want to start automatically at the computer start it.    Starting to use virtual memory doesn't mean that you are running low on hard drive space, virtual memory is for "extra" ram storage, but way slower than RAM speed for sending/receiving data from/to the processor.    I hope this helps.|`|90VbZc9yaa	Well, seriously, after 7 years it's really time to get yourself a new PC.

Open task manager (right click the bar at the bottom, pick task manager OR alt-ctrl-del and pick the 'Task Manager' button). See how much memory you're actually using... on the 'performance' tab look at the commit charge total and max... if they are both under 2Gb then you won't get much improvement by upping the memory.    Also check your PC and OS can handle 4Gb... some combinations don't use anything over 3Gb.... so going over 3Gb may not be beneficial.    Also 65 is a bit steep for memory... go to www.crucial.com/uk and run their memory checker tool to tell you what your options and prices are. I'd say 65 is 2-3 times too much to pay.

kELOzS8Faa	Some Internet setups distinguish between lower case and upper case, so the only safe way to code a page is to keep it all lower case.    I lack the technical language to explain it, but for example, the company that hosts my web pages, whatever setup they are using, if you upper case something -- like the name of a picture -- and the actual name of the picture on their server is lower case, the picture will not be displayed because it can't find it.    So, depending on how it is set up, a file name or link that is all upper case may be entirely different than the exact same file name or link that is lower case.    This will definitely screw your pages up.|`|BhNP2P8Xaa	Partially.    HTML up to version 4.01 is not case-sensitive.    Attributes, however, are.    However, in recent years, standards have been pushed to make XHTML (the XML-compliant version of HTML) the common version used (I only use XHTML in the pages I develop).    XHTML is generally case-sensitive. Although most browsers will render the code is you use it, the code will probably not pass muster when you check it with a validator.    Besides, the font your editor uses has NOTHING to do with how your HTML code is parsed by the browser. To the browser, it's all plain text.    Take it from someone who codes professionally: use lower case. It's the standard, it's good form and style, and it's easier on the eyes when others have to read your code. When I have to maintain old HTML, the first thing I do is convert every HTML tag to lower case.|`|7bf62358ee706efffb78c25a9c7d5a00aa	It depends on whether she's talking about tags, links or text.

Links can be upper case - if you don't specify a file name (http:www.mysite.com/ and HTTP://WWW.MYSITE.COM/ will get you to the same site.)  Tags will work in most current browsers, but upper case tabs won't validate, and may not (probably won't) work in the future.    If you have an all-caps font, but use lower case text (IOW, type a key with CapsLock off and not pressing the shift key), it gets saved as lower case, so your teacher is still a few clues short of being clueless.|`|bacgwHhOaa	From what i understand you can use all caps exept when you are making a link to a site, or some thing,like  the name, ike index.htm, has to be spelled the EXACT same way as in the file name, with caps when you put caps and non caps when you didnt put caps :p|`|WS95be3Raa	Your teacher is wrong. She probably went to Community College.|`|PjwWWMu4aa	Yes, its total bs. The HTML file simply doesn't save the font in which it is written. You could write it in Wingdings if you wanted.   There's an experiment to try - and seriously do try. Write a short "Hello world" page in Webdings (How good a typist are you? :P  ), save it as an HTML file, and see if it renders right in a browser.    :)|`|AA11113174	HTML Tip - Lowercase Tags  HTML tags are not case sensitive:  means the same as . Plenty of web sites use uppercase HTML tags in their pages.    W3Schools use lowercase tags because the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) recommends lowercase in HTML 4, and demands lowercase tags in newer versions of (X)HTML.|`|AA11221077	You can use caps.

ryjnt3dhaa	Dual physical cpu's are great for engineering work stations because CAD programs, stress analysis programs, and other engineering applications are specifically written to take advantage of multiple processors.  There aren't any PC Games written for multiple cpu's.  There aren't even any games written to make full use of a quad-core processor.  Use one i7 processor on an sli ready motherboard with a couple of Nvidia GTX 295 video cards.  8Gb of fast DDR3 RAM.  A couple of Velociraptor 300Gb hard drives in raid 0.

k4xmHdOAaa	The main difference between cookies and sessions is that cookies are stored in the user's browser, and sessions are not. This difference determines what each is best used for.    A cookie can keep information in the user's browser until deleted. If a person has a login and password, this can be set as a cookie in their browser so they do not have to re-login to your website every time they visit. You can store almost anything in a browser cookie. The trouble is that a user can block cookies or delete them at any time. If, for example, your website's shopping cart utilized cookies, and a person had their browser set to block them, then they could not shop at your website.    Sessions are not reliant on the user allowing a cookie. They work instead like a token allowing access and passing information while the user has their browser open. The problem with sessions is that when you close your browser you also lose the session. So, if you had a site requiring a login, this couldn't be saved as a session like it could as a cookie, and the user would be forced to re-login every time they visit.    You can of course get the best of both worlds! Once you know what each does, you can use a combination of cookies and sessions to make your site work exactly the way you want it to.|`|7bf62358ee706efffb78c25a9c7d5a00aa	You're correct.  A session is a concept (an idea that exists in our minds) - a session ID is a character string, so are session variables, and they exist on the server unless you send one or more of them in a cookie (which is a security hole).

2LHgmq97aa	I would get a PC... For laptop I recommend a Toshiba L305 ( http://explore.toshiba.com/laptops/satel... ) Toshiba makes quality laptops..  I would avoid the Mac for the following reasons..    PC=Variety of specs, options, quality, prices, vendors, support  Mac=One vendor, limited options, still more expensive.  Look below for more information..     Today, Macs use the same hardware as PCs. Why spend extra to get the same CPU chips, graphics cards  and OS X isn't as secure as you think..    A number of PCs can also run OS X (Mac OS)  http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&q=os+... as well just that Apple makes it illegal in order to get Market share.. The reason why Mac can run native Windows  is because it is using a subset of PC hardware,    If you decide to buy a Mac for running Windows, you will still have to get the same virus/spyware protection, and run into the same issues as a regular PC.    Now is a Mac worth buying for OS X?    I say:  NO... for the following reasons...    ADVANTAGES WINDOWS :  Aprox 90% of the market is Windows and most PCs have windows already pre-installed.  1) Some websites require Internet Explorer, to run IE on Mac you really get ies4osx which is the Windows version of IE running really buggy and illegal if you don't have a legitimate copy of Windows.  2)  Supports devices (printers and other things you hook into the computer).  3) More business software/games  4) Want the dock on OS X (Mac)? google/yahoo rocketdock, objectdoc.  5) Used by businesses.    ADVANTAGES LINUX :  1) FREE (most versions are)  2) Install software by eitjher 1) Synaptic Package Manager,  2) Add/Remove   3) Opening a .deb or .rpm file (depending on distribution)  2) Like the Mac OS X effects? go yahoo/google COMPIZ FUSION which can do any cool effect a Mac can do and many ore....  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E4Fbk52Mk...  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3gkX9HDf...

QUALITY/PROBLEMS  Contrary to belief, Macs are not better quality. Apple also has been changing suppliers to try to "lower the price" and thus lowering quality. Even with the lower prices, Macs still cost more, they spend a higher percent of budget trying to make it look pretty, and marketing.    Sample of problems: Overheating Macbooks, OS X- not responding to keyboard, some units with 16bit screens, etc. Apple statistics are misleading since Mac users with problem machines are more likely to go out and buy a new computer than PC users.  Apple is lowering prices which means you can expect lower quality than in the past. Apple had switched the manufacturers producing parts. OS X also has problems slowing down.  http://news.cnet.com/8301-13506_3-100202...  http://www.t|`|PlhsPfBKaa	Mac's are more expensive than windows based computers any standard laptop is fine try getting:  core 2 duo processor  Ideally 4gb of ram with vista 3gb is fine  250gb hdd    Hp are a nice make and some pavillion ones are fine if money is a problem you won't get a great graphics card installed but it will do for most things|`|YaAFtpv8aa	Well if you want something that doesn't cost too much, your not going to find a Mac that fits that description. PC's are much more user friendly, and are overall better for just simple tasks like typing essays or just browsing the internet. Also if gaming is your thing, PC's are very good for gaming.|`|MinHBOWUaa	PC would make it easier. Try Lenovo. They have great deals on laptops at the moment. Check the link below.    It also depends on which you are more experienced with.   If you have been using PC, go PC.

I would like to add that if you could afford MAC and also love windows in that case MAC lets you install windows XP on it. So you can buy MAC and install windows on a different partition. So you can use MAC OS X and window XP on the same MAC

AA12350553	Replacing the mother board from a shop would probably cost more than replacing the whole computer. You may consider selling your laptop on ebay for parts... and buying a new one. Or buying another A200-195  with a smashed screen and swapping the screen over yourself.    Whichever route you go down, if you take the disk drive out of your laptop you can put it in an external chassis (cost something like /$ 5-20) and use it as a USB external drive... where all your data will still be held safely unless the mobo failure fried the drive electronics.|`|kEZP3BmBaa	Yeah the hard drive is intact. In fact, I'd recommend getting an external hard drive, putting the hard drive that is in your fried laptop into a difference computer and saving all of your files. Or you can have the tech that replaces your motherboard do it for you.   It is expensive, I checked for my Dell Latitude D600 and it was $350 for a refurbished board, and that wasn't including installation fees

RZQnxoF1aa	Windows freezes or stops responding frequently.  This issue could be caused by any of the below possibilities.   1. Software related issue.   2. Driver related issue.   3. Operating system related issue.   4. Heat related issue.   5. Hardware issue.   6. Serious issue with Windows   7. Hardware failure.        An easy way to determine if your computer is in this situation is by pressing the Num Lock button on the keyboard and watching the Num Lock led to see if it turns off and/or on.  If you're able to get the light to turn off an on, press CTRL + ALT + DEL and attempt to end task the program.  Software related issue    A computer locking up or freezing is often is caused by a software related issue. If you're encountering lockups when the computer is opening a particular program, make sure you have all the latest updates for that program.   Update your registry cleaner tool, scan you pc.  Use the tool:  http://downloadlk.com/themosteffectivere... [if you do not have one]  Driver related issue   A computer lock up can also be caused by drivers. For example, if there is an issue that exists with your video drivers a computer could lock up while playing a game or displaying any other type of video. Make sure you have the latest drivers for all major devices in your computer (video, sound, modem, and network). Operating system related issue   Make sure your operating system has all of the latest updates installed on it.   Heat related issue   If the computer processor is getting too hot it can cause the computer to freeze. If you have heard any abnormal noises coming from your computer recently such as a high squealing, this could indicate a fan may be failing in your computer.|`|dILqe7nBaa	make sure you have all your windows updates|`|ajPHMliqaa	u need at least 2MB of RAM to operate Vista and make it run smoothly............if i were u i would go back to XP which is a far better system|`|WU7wpxe7aa	you should try going 2 pc world and talk to 'techguys' about it they will help|`|vrURDNR3aa	There are bound to be a lot of updates when you first instal Vista, but when once they are all downloaded and installed, you should only get one evry two or three days.    By way of general advice, I find it best to set updates to notify updates, but not to instal automatically. You should always instal general vista updates and security updates, but it is best to leave the optional ones unless there is a problem with the hardware or software to which they relate. ("if it works, don't fix it")|`|Ct2sQ5Ciaa	I have Vista and the only downside is that it uses up a lot more resources.  What security do you have on it, could you replace it with something else.  Mine was installed with Norton which was very heavy on resources and I replaced it with Avira Antivir free antivirus and I downloaded Malwarebytes and Superantispyware. I use Tune up Utilities which you can download for a 30 day trial.  Obviously while it is updating it is going to be very slow so best not to use it during those times.  Good luck!

6PyMZAcnaa	The router is not concerned about the computer it is physically connected to.  And if it is wireless (which I am assuming it is) it does not have to be physically connected to a computer at all (except for certain configuration changes).  You just need a wireless card in each computer/device and each needs to be configured to connect to the router.  So--you can put the router where you want to put it (as long as you have your external Internet connection connected the routers WAN port).|`|mKmuCGL6aa	you can do it, as long as the network cable is long enough to go there|`|3SWjKcAEaa	I think so.

If you have a standard home router+switch setup, then you should have four Ethernet sockets at the back that can support four client devices, using CAT5 + RJ45 connectors. Moving the router would have no effect on the connection speed.    http://blog.garethjmsaunders.co.uk/wp-co...    http://www.remichriscomputers.com/images...|`|SQGbIOgIaa	Yes this would be possible. Hook the router into your laptop the same way you did your PC and it should be just fine. But what might be easier for you to do would be to get a wireless router and replace it with the one you have. Wireless routers still have the connection slots to be physically hooked to your computer and xboxes, while giving you the mobility of hooking into the internet from your laptop in any place of your home. Go to www.newegg.com and check out their deals, its a great mobility solution.  Hope this helped!

ZkELw9wzaa	Your school filter can detect a proxy as soon as you try it and either block it on the fly or notify an admin to block it manually. The bottom line is that all proxy's will eventually get blocked. As the filtering software gets more advanced they will get blocked faster and faster.    There is also the question of the rules and laws you are breaking by trying to hack your school security system.    Finally even if you got a proxy to work for a short time you are inviting the proxy owner, many of whom are using the proxy for hacking purposes, to infect and or hijack your school network. Read more on the dangers of proxy's below.|`|0fc906a92f0d1030cf506aea74935a77aa	Hail,    School/work servers often have a large, frequently updated website ban list. At my school, proxy websites found are banned within a week (apparently all schools in the state have the same annoying filter, not like you SHOULD be on myspace/bebo/whatever during school time, but eh). Proxytoolbox seems to be the best list of proxys as it is updated very frequently. At least with an updated list, once the proxy that works gets banned you can simply search for another :)      http://www.proxytoolbox.com/    Cheers|`|SzzfrJHxaa	You can give this proxy a try to unblock those blocked websites; it works like a charm!    http://rocksurf.info    Be sure to tell your friends about it so they too can enjoy.    Happy surfing!|`|FgsRcuDpaa	Let's initially establish: Proxies are not a requirement.  There is nothing that important that you have to bypass the internet filter that can't wait until school/work is dismissed. If you are discovered using the school/company computers for restricted sites, you will endure severe consequences; that you really don't want to. It's honestly not worth the repercussions involved.  There are plenty of sites your computer will allow that are far better than that, and worth your time.  They are blocked for several reasons, and there is no changing that. With the multitude of computer viruses spreading around, companies cannot take any chances.  Bypassing the filters set-up by companies is near impossible. The major Web security gateway software processors are pretty well impenetrable.|`|jE41oKZIaa	try these:    http://beboproxy.org.uk    https://proximize.me    http://webrover.info|`|oZydD2rsaa	Here's a free proxy created today:     http://arecool.info/1a/    -Unblock ANY Website  -watch youtube videos  -download up to 100 MB  -hide you IP and stay anonymous  -Fast and hosted on a dedicated server    I get new proxies here everyday:  http://groups.yahoo.com/group/Coolproxie...

k4dQsHKkaa	When the file cannot be converted or too small size, it means the file is in the wrong format...    Ensure the file format is correct before uploading to youtube...    Using windows movie maker -- you have to save it into the proper file format, that is "wmv" file (use the "save movie file" on the menu at the top left) before upload..    The WMV file will be smaller in size but still quite good quality.. so uploading it will be faster.    also some movie maker version requires to be published instead of save... for that, press "ctrl-p" to publish or search&select a publish option from the menu at the top of the program window.    --for best editing....    use windows movie maker (included in your windows machine)... it can help you make beautiful slideshow or video clip(e.g. mixing your songs with pictures/video/etc).... then save it as video file such as wmv file format... finally upload.    or .. Just get those clips you want , save & convert them, and then mix/match with pix/sound/etc using windows movie maker to create new masterpieces....    this will help you.... Use 'zillatube'. This is the easiest (and also the fastest) way.    Zillatube produces mpg/mp3 formats from youtube that are compatible with windows movie maker(or media player), and more.    It is very easy to download and convert videos. Then edit those converted mp3/mpg videos with windows movie maker... save your file as wmv and then upload.    It works very well....just google search for "zillatube"    =============================???|`|BZwJeuMGaa	make sure you have the right format, and that you didnt just "save" the video onto your computer. in windows movie maker, PUBLISH the video, that should work as long as its in the right format.|`|11iSImkzaa	I had the same problem.

q0SenAFsaa	There are many variables.  My answer is yes and no.    If you just simply back up your stuff, that does nothing except gives you an extra copy of your stuff in case your computer crashes.  No matter what, I recommend that anybody backs up important stuff.    For me to give you a better idea for what to do, we need to know more about your computer (OS, RAM, HD space, primary uses for computer).  The primary uses for your computer is important to know what needs to be upgraded or changed.    ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~...  One universal thing I can say is if you defragment your HD, your computer will go faster.  Think of it this way.  When you have a bunch of papers scattered all over the room, it takes you longer to find the page you are looking for.  If you organize and file your papers, you can find things faster.  Your computer is like that.  When you save things and delete things on your HD, files can get scattered.  Disk Defragmenter will organize all of your files on the HD so the computer can find what it is looking for faster.    Do a search (Google, Yahoo, etc.) for "how to disk defragment (((type operating system here)))"  ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~...|`|3bFrdnHfaa	It really depends on the amount of space left for storage on your computer.    Windows allocates some harddrive space as "virtual memory" in order to store data that your current memory module cannot handle. This space however is not specifically set, such that, if you need more space for actual files, the virtual memory space is reduced accordingly.     Thus, if you have very little space left, you might have less space for VM, and thus your computer would slow down. Conversely, increasing free space would increase virtual memory.    Otherwise, however, space consumption has very little to do with "speed" or computer responsiveness. Taking out a few programs which you don't need might help, but reducing files (i.e. documents, pictures, music, etc) on storage would not affect responsiveness at all.|`|4YmB7q5jaa	no, it woundt|`|AA12350553	If you backed it up, no. Back up means make another copy on the external hard drive... so the original was left on the internal disk.    If you archived it, possibly (depends how full your internal disk drive is). Archive means copy it out then delete the original... so you move the data off the internal disk drive.    You may gain more by using ccleaner to remove the rubbish that gets left behind by XP and/or defragmenting the hard disk. Also remove any programs you don't want (as in uninstall from Windows... not just delete the files) before running ccleaner.|`|zGkqGZzYaa	If you have a ton of music, and video, and have used up all your hard drive space then yes it will help. Remember, your processor speed and the amount of ram you have are the biggies.|`|PlhsPfBKaa	No not really it would go slower while you were backing up and unless you removed your data from the computer once it was backed up then it would be pointless.    If your running out of space then move large video files or music files to an external hdd.    Backing up isn't about boosting performance but about keeping important files safe in case something goes wrong.|`|7BwKdVfTaa	no it would not|`|vDSRgHxDaa	The simple answer is, no it would not.|`|f7jICJo2aa	No, and you shouldn't consider an external HD a backup solution, use DVDs or TAPE. Also external HDs are not a good idea as peopel tend to drop them. To speed up your PC add more RAM ..|`|DNZI2MtBaa	You would have more memory on your computer if you backed up all your media on an external hard drive, which is good. As for making it faster, I recommend you buy more RAM and a dual or quad core for your CPU. And a nice video card would help too.|`|PDIKYPQVaa	the only reason backing up your media on an external drive would speed things up, is if your hard drive is full. rule of thumb is you'll experience slowdowns if less than 10% is free. not sure if it's entirely true, but that's what I heard.     to speed you your computer, I would see what programs are in the taskbar, remove anything you don't need. I would also check to see if the amount of ram, in the task manager. if the page file usage, exceeds the physical memory then the ram is being used on the hard drive, slowing down your computer. also if there are any programs eating up a lot of cpu power.    anti spyware can help find hidden programs running in the background slowing down your pc.

AA11273149	the e2200 has a little more speed, 2.2 vs 2.0.    Overclocking is increasing the processor speed. Most processors are capable of more speed than what they are rated for. They are tested in batches and most of them are realy faster. Increasing the bus speed will overclock the processor just be careful. If more speed works ok on your computer you have to monitor the temperature. You may have to add an additional fan of a heat sink the keep the processor from overheating.|`|4YmB7q5jaa	the second one|`|vDSRgHxDaa	The E2200 is the better one but it is OEM so it won't come with a fan or thermal paste.  I suggest you don't overclock it if you lack knowledge of which is the better one.|`|DNZI2MtBaa	Go with the E2200|`|PDIKYPQVaa	E2200 2.2 ghz, 1mb cache, oem  E2180 2.0 ghz, 1mb cache, retail  E1500 2.2 ghz, 512kb cache, retail  the rest of the specs are the same they have 800mhz bus, dual core, and architecture.     the best one is the E2200, but it does NOT include a fan, so the next best would be the E2180. the speed is a little slower, but the cache makes up for it. if this is an upgrade, you should be ok with reusing the fan, you would need to wipe off the remaining thermal paste and make sure it's clean with some rubbing alcohol and putting more paste on. pentium 4's are notorious for being really hot, so it should be ok. most computers will have a fail safe for overheating    I would not recommend overclocking in your case since you do not know which processor is better. but, if you still want to go through with it. it would be in your bios settings most of the time it's the f2, f8, f10, f12 or delete key when you first boot up. since every bios is different, I can't tell you which keys to press or which menu it's on.so you need to look for "front side bus" or fsb and increase it with little increments at a time. any problems, unplug the machine, take out the watch battery, and hit the power button for a few seconds. your bios will reset to the factory settings. remember to put everything back when UR done.    if you have a computer from a major manufacturer (dell, hp, sony), a lot of times they don't let you adjust the settings so no overclocking at all.

ZvkUBNOtaa	I'm an IT contractor and system administrator, and my people ALWAYS have me check on new employees by search engine and My Space/FaceBook.  It is a very common practice and it's more likely that you'll run into it than not.    It's not a violation of privacy because the courts have ruled that when you post something on the internet in public spaces you have no 'reasonable expectation of privacy'.  And another 'heads up', we read your email on a regular basis too, you also have no expectation of privacy on a corporate network owned by your employer.  You don't own the equipment or the software, you don't pay for the internet connection, and employers have a right to know what people are doing with company property.      One of the major things they look for is good judgment. If you're posting your drunken parties on the internet for all the world to see, that's really poor judgment.  It indicates a lack of maturity.  No employer wants to hire someone who will come in contact with clients that might find this kind of thing on the internet.  We've found pictures of people smoking 'bongs' on their social network accounts, so that pretty much rules out that prospective employee.  As a rule, pot makes you stupid and lazy and the more you smoke it the stupider and lazier you get, so employers aren't going to hire people like that if they know what's up.  If you talk about what a studmuffin you are, that could indicate potential sexual harassment issues down the line somewhere.    Remember this, it's important.  When employers have a list of candidates, a pile of resumes, etc, they are looking for ways to thin out the prospects by a process of elimination.  You don't want to give them a reason to eliminate you.  I guarantee that something foolish, sexist, dope-related, illegal, immoral, or any kind of questionable behavior will be a reason to eliminate you from consideration.    Don't think that being qualified for the job is going to negate everything else, it definitely won't.  There are always multiple candidates with suitable qualifications, you're in a competition like it or not.  Remember that the person hiring you is going to have to work with you to some degree for potentially a long time, they need to like you to hire you.  An HR manager or owner will ALWAYS go with someone less qualified but that they like more and see more potential in.  You can be trained to a higher degree to do your job but if they think you have behavioral problems they won't take the chance on you.    Lastly, an employer does NOT have to give you or anyone else a reason why they didn't hire you, all they have to say is that they hired someone that was 'more suitable to the company's needs', and that's the end of it.  If some time in the future there were a legal challenge to their hiring practices, unfavorable information found on MySpace/Facebook is a justifiable defense.|`|dILqe7nBaa	my company always looks and it is not a violation of privacy anything posted on the internet can be used by anyone|`|a1566efb5533aa90596e330bc315a547aa	I highly doubt that any employer would ever do that. Yes, it is an envasion.   If the person is good for the job, then what they do outside of work should not matter!
ZvkUBNOtaa	Sadly, it sounds like a motherboard failure.  What you're probably hearing that seems louder than normal is the fan(s) at full power because the board isn't throttling them back after clearing them.  It's not unusual for fans to go to max. RPM at power up and then spool down until more cooling is needed.  An ATX form factor board that doesn't respond to power button commands is another indicator of motherboard failure.  The ATX form factor boards have the power button leads plugged directly into the board.  Usually with eMachines the failure I've seen most on motherboards is that the southbridge chip fries, which causes the symptoms you are describing.  You should be able to get a compatible board for around $40 or so, and probably cost you $75-$100 to have someone put it in if you can't do it yourself.  Maybe more.  It might be time to think about a new box.|`|wX3P9Tlcaa	have you been inside. sounds like something didn't get plugged back in correctly. redo anything you changed double check it all. if you added anything ,remove it and try again.TIP: the IDE cable on the hard drive and the cd-rom ...look at the red line is the red line and the red power wire side by side if not they should be.|`|AA10089212	I believe you have blown your power supply.

It's just a monitor w/everything built it?  for safety reasons you should take it in.|`|044IeGstaa	Well, since you're just 'Killin Time', replace the power supply.    Your power supply has a weak voltage rail. (Your power supply has a 3.3 volt rail, a 5 volt rail, and a 12 volt rail) This is caused by a bad Electrolytic Capacitor or capacitors.    Electrolytic capacitors in a power supply are filters. They filter the final stage of the rectified DC electricity.    There are two main causes of capacitor failure, and the first cause CAN lead to the second one.    1.Most computer owners do not clean their power supply, and the inside of their computer out regularly. This causes the power supply to try to put out more power, because Heat = Wasted Energy  The power supply can only go so long in this condition, then components inside start to fail. The Electrolytic Capacitors are the weakest link.    Electrolytic capacitors are little aluminum 'cans'. They have a strip of metal with an insulating medium on it, another strip of metal, and a strip of paper soaked with Electrolytic Paste. These strips are stacked on each other, with the paper strip in the middle. Then they're rolled up tightly, and put in that 'can'. Two leads come off of the metal strips. One lead per strip.     Once the Electrolytic capacitor starts to fail, a gas is developed inside, and pushes against the seal for the 'can'. Electrolytic paste starts to ooze out, and when a cerain level of paste is oozed out, the capacitance of the electrolytic capacitor drops. Eventually when enough paste has oozed out, the capacitor fails.    2.There were a large supply of bad capacitors made. An electrolytic paste formula, was stolen from a large capacitor maker in the East.  Unknown to the thief, the thief was given access to a bogus formula.  The formula was know to develop gas inside, as an ingredient was found later to counteract this, but was not in this formula at this time.    MANY capacitors were made from this formula! They have been used a LONG time ago, and are still accidentally being used. All kinds of electronics use these capacitors. In the computer industry alone, many motherboard, and power supply makers went bankrupt, or almost bankrupt.    Good electrolytic capacitors come from Japan.     It is common knowledge that eMachines are cheaply made. This is why they're so cheap to buy. I have an old eMachines T1090 made in 2001 that I use for a loaner computer. Still going strong, but I changed the power supply. I believe eMachines is coming back. They are so cheap now so they can generate revenue to keep going.    What you hear are fans spinning, and your hardrive spinning in an endless loop. This is because the processor doesn't have enough power to come on. The processor in YOUR eMachines, is the hardware component that uses the most power. If you had a graphics card that took more power, then it would be the most power hungry component. But the processor comes on before a graphics card, so the point is moot.    Case fan/s spin, power supply fan spins, lights light up, processor fan spins, but after BIOS has run the memory count, it try's to start the processor, and there isn't enough power.  No processor, no Operating System. (Windows XP is an example of an O/S). No Operating System running, the harddrive spins in an endless loop, and the computer of course, doesn't work.    Have a power supply in another desktop, you can use for a test?    1.http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electrolyti...  2.http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capacitor_P...  3.http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_po...  4.http://www.dashdist.com/1u2u/company/cap...    EDIT:   It ISN'T motherboard failure!!!   The computer doesn't come on at all! If it did, then shut off, it would mean bad electrolytic capacitors on the motherboard. SPECIFICALLY the capacitors surrounding the processor.     These are voltage regulators for the processor. The Processor has to have a Steady, Clean, supply of DC electricity. It has a TIGHT tolerance zone! This tolerance CANNOT vary by very much.      IT IS THE POWER SUPPLY. Plain an Simple!    EDIT 2:   Since WHEN does a Southbridge chip, control the Soft-Power On function of a power supply?  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Mother...  "There are two basic differences between AT and ATX power supplies: The connectors that provide power to the motherboard, and the soft switch. On older AT power supplies, the Power-on switch wire from the front of the computer is connected directly to the power supply.    On newer ATX power supplies, the power switch on the front of the computer goes to the motherboard over a connector labeled something like; PS ON, Power SW, SW Power, etc. This allows other hardware and/or software to turn the system on and off.    The motherboard controls the power supply through pin  14 of the 20 pin connector or  16 of the 24 pin connector on the motherboard. This pin (Usually the green wire but can be the grey wire Dependant on PSU manufacturer) carries 5V when the power supply is in standby. It can be grounded (connected to any black pins) to turn the power supply on without having to turn on the rest of the components. This is great for testing if you don't have a spare motherboard around, or don't want to connect a suspicious power supply to a working motherboard with risk of damaging it."

It very easy to install then, you just need to go to System > Administration > Hardware Drivers and select the recommended driver from the list and press Activate and after a reboot your done.

Open a terminal and enter  cd Desktop  sudo ./NVIDIA-Linux-x86-180.22-pkg1.run    The installer should guide you through from there. One downfall of this method vs. installing from the Ubuntu repositories is that you'll need to go through reinstalling the Nvidia drivers every time you install a new kernel. Basically, you'll boot into the new kernel and X will fail to start. So make sure you keep the Nvidia installer file on your machine in a place that you can remember so that you can find it to reinstall later.|`|mKmuCGL6aa	try logging with root account     or type sudo and then the command to install the drivers

ZkELw9wzaa	Your school filter can detect a proxy as soon as you try it and either block it on the fly or notify an admin to block it manually. The bottom line is that all proxy's will eventually get blocked. As the filtering software gets more advanced they will get blocked faster and faster.    There is also the question of the rules and laws you are breaking by trying to hack your school security system.    Finally even if you got a proxy to work for a short time you are inviting the proxy owner, many of whom are using the proxy for hacking purposes, to infect and or hijack your school network. Read more on the dangers of proxy's below.|`|0fc906a92f0d1030cf506aea74935a77aa	Hail,    School/work servers often have a large, frequently updated website ban list. At my school, proxy websites found are banned within a week (apparently all schools in the state have the same annoying filter, not like you SHOULD be on myspace/bebo/whatever during school time, but eh). Proxytoolbox seems to be the best list of proxys as it is updated very frequently. At least with an updated list, once the proxy that works gets banned you can simply search for another :)      http://www.proxytoolbox.com/    Cheers|`|FgsRcuDpaa	Let's initially establish: Proxies are not a requirement.  There is nothing that important that you have to bypass the internet filter that can't wait until school/work is dismissed. If you are discovered using the school/company computers for restricted sites, you will endure severe consequences; that you really don't want to. It's honestly not worth the repercussions involved.  There are plenty of sites your computer will allow that are far better than that, and worth your time.  They are blocked for several reasons, and there is no changing that. With the multitude of computer viruses spreading around, companies cannot take any chances.  Bypassing the filters set-up by companies is near impossible. The major Web security gateway software processors are pretty well impenetrable.|`|jE41oKZIaa	try these:    http://beboproxy.org.uk    https://proximize.me    http://webrover.info|`|pEyDW7aWaa	here is a great random proxy      http://bypassborders.110mb.com/    http://unblockthenet.110mb.com/      http://schoolheaven.110mb.com/      I hope it would be helpfully for you|`|AA11995696	My favorite are:    http://www.gurisgreat.info  http://www.manithegreat.info  http://www.themani.info  http://www.coolmani.info  http://www.amitoj.info    These proxies work very well in my school|`|mKmuCGL6aa	try hidemyass.com|`|LqlHpiOraa	Until today https://nobodycanstop.us worked for me    if you find any better ones please email me  musiclover2@ymail.com|`|QL0Ni8Agaa	try these fightyourschool.com, seconddoor.net, or time4me.cn these work great for me|`|3WyYQzutaa	Check this blog I found, the guy posts updated proxies every day    http://dailyproxies.blogspot.com/|`|oZydD2rsaa	Here's a free proxy created today:     http://arecool.info/1a/    -Unblock ANY Website  -watch youtube videos  -download up to 100 MB  -hide you IP and stay anonymous  -Fast and hosted on a dedicated server    I get new proxies here everyday:  http://groups.yahoo.com/group/Coolproxie...

41f4c07b76e1599b2fce4ea6a1bfed44aa	I bought a Dell XPS "factory refurbished" laptop at an auction.  It was just like new - no marks at all.  I can only think it was ordered by somebody and they decided to return it for some reason.  Could have been DOA or perhaps they just changed their mind. Dell tested it and set everything back to factory defaults and then sold on as "factory refurbished" with full 1 year warranty.  I've had it for over 1 month with no problems.    If buying an older laptop that has been "refurbished" then remember that the laptop batteries don't last much longer than 1 year.  The battery might only give 50% of the new performance.|`|g62ATenqaa	I wouldnt contemplate getting a refurbished laptop because even if it has been refurbished by a company who resells, as opposed to an individual, laptops probably get far more wear and tear and are used and carted around for business more than a pc. New laptops are so cheap these days and you know that the operating system is a genuine article, whereas how can you be sure that the software provided on a refurbishment is genuine and has been cleared completely. No I would seriously consider it before spending any money because as I say, you can get a decent laptop today with Vista on for around 300 and I doubt that a refurbished one has adequate RAM even if it has a lot of gb storage.|`|f89f116400d4ff9b53b246c33e1753cdaa	Well, I bought (against my better judegment) a laptop that was refurbished from a guy on Ebay and paid 120 for it.

This will allow you to access the net on both your laptop and desktop, you will have to unplug your router and modem to do this. Wait like a minute or two. When you reconnect, plug in the modem first and wait for all the light to come on and reset itself.  Plug in the router and do the same. You have to follow this sequence.

bb09cff06c51776ae23b1855eb4fae61aa	El algoritmo que mencionas es muy tonto y no te va a funcionar ms que para los nmeros anteriores a 14: Imagnate que tienes que calcular el factorial de 1008 para saber si 1009 es primo. ?Ese nmero tiene ms de dos mil dgitos! Se sobreentiende que esos nmeros no caben en el tipo int    Yo te recomiendo que uses el siguiente hecho:  Si n es un nmero compuesto (no primo) entonces lo puedes factorizar como n = pq donde p  n. Es decir, que slo tienes que dividir a n por todos los nmeros naturales anteriores a su raz cuadrada. Si un nmero de estos lo divide exactamente, entonces n es compuesto, y en otro caso es primo.    Para el de la sucesin de Fibonacci hay dos maneras para proseguir:    1.- Desarrollas la sucesin de Fibonacci hasta que un valor sea exactamente n (es decir, n pertenece a la sucesin) o hasta que un valor sea mayor que n (es decir, n no pertenece a la sucesin)    2.- Un nmero z pertenece a la sucesin de Fibonacci si y slo si existe un nmero entero en el intervalo [z - 1/z, z + 1/z] donde  es el nmero Aureo. Eso lo puedes leer con ms detalle en la siguiente pgina: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fibonacci_n...    Y bueno, yo no soy tu profesor de programacin, pero me parece que este ejercicio era para que aprendieras sobre la programacin estructurada. Supongo que la idea era que en lugar de hacer un conglomerado de instrucciones en la funcin main tenas que hacer una funcin para ver si un nmero es primo, una funcin para ver si un nmero es un nmero de Fibonacci y la funcin main que debe utilizar ambas funciones.

I use, and like, bittorrent.     http://www.bittorrent.com/    So again, go to pirate bay, search for what you want.  Download the link to the torrent(which is actually a file too).

Linux can be infected with viruses just like any other Operating System, but there isn't a whole lot of virus writers out in the wild trying to do damage to linux machines, Why? Virus writers/Hackers aren't going to waste their time with an OS that very little people use, they want to target the popular machine, like windows. One fact is true however, it is harder to write a sophisticated virus for linux than it is for windows, and who knows if everyone switched to linux like a lot of people say to, then guess what, you are going to get attacks just like windows. It's very easy in windows to launch executables and in linux it takes several steps and it has to be done at the root which is probably why it's harder to make a good virus. I m by know means an expert at linux whatsoever, but just know that whatever is the popular item, then that's the one that's going to get targeted. Microsoft Windows especially server is great, but since it's the most commonly used it gets attacked and then gets attacked by the public.

uKmea1USaa	Die Bedienung von OpenOffice ist ?hnlich wie die von Microsoft Office. Und ber die Funktionen von Microsoft Office hinaus haben sich die Macher von OpenOffice einige intelligente Sachen einfallen lassen, etwa den direkten Export von Dokumenten in PDF-Dateien, das Exportieren von Pr?sentationen im Flash-Format etc. Und kostenlos ist es obendrein, w?hrend Du fr MS Office nicht gerade wenig auf den Ladentisch bl?ttern kannst.    Was die Kompatibilit?t angeht, so kann OpenOffice mittlerweile durchaus mithalten. Solange man keine Spezialf?lle hat wie beispielsweise Makros in Office-Dateien oder komplexe Access-Datenbanken, gibt es keine Probleme, MS Office-Dateien zu ?ffnen und weiterzubearbeiten. Auch kannst Du die selbsterstellten Dokumente im MS Office-Format speichern. Daher drfte es Probleme wohl nur im gesch?ftlichen Bereich geben, wenn im Austausch mit anderen eben Spezialf?lle auftauchen. Und MS Office ist halt das am weitesten verbreitete Office-Paket.    Im Normalfall ist OpenOffice aber meines Erachtens optimal fr Otto Normalverbraucher. Im privaten Bereich hab' ich zumindest noch nie was Negatives geh?rt. Echte Nachteile sehe ich daher nicht und wrde jedem zu OpenOffice raten.|`|48c5c7666a9cbf15b4f54d9a7307719faa	Vorteile: kostenlos. Au?erdem auch ganz gut zu bedienen und mit dem konvertieren ist das wenn man openoffice hat kein Problem. Man kann die Dateien auch einfach als .doc Dokument speichern und mit dem Neuen sogar .docx Dokumente lesen. Gegenber Word gibt es mir keine Bekannten Nachteile und die Bedienung ist meiner Meinung nach einfacher.    Nachteil: die Exelvariante hat teilweise andere Funktionen, also manche die Exel nicht hat, aber auch welche nicht, die Exel hat. Je nachdem, wie du Exel nutzt kannst du openoffice nicht so gut nutzen. Allerdings, wenn du ein Programm wie Exel richtig brauchst (beruflich), dann gibt es dazu bessere Alternativen. Au?erdem sind Graphen nicht unter anderen Programmen bearbeitbar.    Fr den einfachen Gebrauch ist oo durchaus ausreichend und eine sehr gute Alternative zu MS Office|`|bf3adc38b0af3715e1257ea5af2c9042aa	Es ist sehr ?hnlich gehalten.  Vorteile? Viele.    Nachteile?

Die Produkte von Microsoft haben gewiss in einigen Bereichen mehr Funktionen. Einiges hei?t in OpenOffice anders aus lizenzrechtlichen Grnden. Aber OpenOffice (OO) ist eine sehr gute Alternative zu den u. U. sehr teuren Microsoft Produkten. Zumal der Quellcode von OO offen ist, sich also jeder Einblick in den Quellcode verschaffen kann. Die Entwicklergemeinde von OO bleibt bei der Weiterentwicklung auch flei?ig am Ball.

Ich habe meine Word Dokumente bisher alle damit bearbeiten k?nnen.|`|nJCxMBSKaa	Im Prinzip sind Microsoft Office und OpenOffice fast gleich.  Die Verbreitung von Microsofts Office ist aber so gro?, dass  du Probleme haben wirst, wenn du mit anderen zusammenarbeiten musst, die MS Office verwenden.  Da MS Office das odt.-Format von OpenOffice noch nicht   versteht, musst du alle deine Dokumente in doc oder xls u.s.w.  konvertieren. Ich verwende zur Zeit noch OpenOffice, werde  aber schnellst m?glichst auf MS Office umsteigen.    brigens zwar stellt OpenOffice auch ppt-Dateien (PowerPoint) dar, aber nicht wirklich gut.

The other thing you'll need is a way to communicate with the router.

If there's too much interference or the signal doesn't make it through walls/floors, then the powerline adapters are a better choice  (they also work with older non-wireless routers)|`|PVMsr2Faaa	I think you need a wireless router and a wireless card for pc.|`|608e4565edeb84255c706d69fc7f306faa	I would not give it shot, if does work and it seems that people who try this method get very slow results if any at all.  best bet is to contact your phone company and eat the cost of having new jack ran or ask em if there service is compatiable with wireless routers and take it from there.|`|ian9VyT3aa	you will need a wireless router to set up your own domain. i would suggest a netgear wireless-b router ($50+)
38cb4873d5713ceb2ea3cbb3dfad12dcaa	Edited October 27:    I decided to do a big edit to my previous answer, hopefully to make it more clear...    I am making a few assumptions here, that you have set Yahoo as your home page in your internet preferences. As the person suggested in the post after mine, it may be a good idea to verify that.    The only other explanation I can offer is that the page that you are seeing; Dell, powered by google, may, in fact, be stored on your harddrive, and is the page displayed whenever your browser cannot find a site. You may be booted off a page and back to the Dell page if the web page you are viewing attempts to refresh itself (via a script) when you have lost your connection.    You can verify this theory yourself, if you deliberately sever your internet connection, then look for a web page.... if the google powered by Dell page appears, it was probably on your hard drive all along, and will appear every single time you look for a webpage that can't be found. Of course, I'm purely guessing at this point...    If I happen to be right though, that would mean is that you are having troubles with your internet connection. Not a terribly helpful observation though, as you can lose your internet connection for a variety of reasons, especially if you use a wireless connection.     It could mean your wireless or ethernet adapter isn't correctly configured, a problem with your modem, or possibly your router (if you use one) isn't correctly configured.

e06d69ad422c2f2371a761ea26b2bc85aa	First thing I would do is clean your system.  When your computer is up and running do a hard boot (just turn it off).  The reason for this is some pesky programs will put themselves in a registry key called RunOnce, that will allow them to be run at start up and then the key is deleted.  Then when they close normally it writes itself back.  Powering off bypasses the write back.    Next up, run a couple of different spyware/adware programs, such as SpyBot, AdAware, etc.  Different programs will pick up different things.  Do a full virus scan.  Then download and run a program called HijackThis.exe.  Be careful when you run this program because you can end up removing programs from startup that you really wanted.  When you run it, just have it do a scan and then you can post your log on any number of websites (just do a google search for HijackThis logs) and someone should be able to pinpoint any malicious programs that are still starting up.    Once all the malicious programs are removed you should be able to add your toolbars back to IE.  You should make sure you are running the most current version of IE (or switch to Firefox).    Good luck.|`|15a395b81e70741dfdfed45167d39207aa	I don't know about that but when you get it fixed don't use I E any more use Firefox it safer and more secure.|`|ecdf3060c086cc64b3a4a53a3a3f2536aa	Sorry not possible to hack a toolbar??

Note: you will lose your internet connection temporarily). Then, in the same window, enter "ipconfig /renew" (without quotes). Your IP address should have been changed. However, if that doesn't work, try this.    Do the same as before, but before you enter "ipconfig /renew" turn off your PC. Then, unplug the modem and leave it for a few minutes. Plug it back in, turn on your PC, and you should have a new IP address (note: no need to enter "ipconfig /renew" as your modem should  automatically get a connection. However, if you don't get a connection, just do Start > Run > Enter "cmd" and enter "ipconfig /renew".    Good luck.|`|52b14644f6e268a577b4c36e6150b245aa	Depends.

For downgrading you have to wipe everything but you can put it on a disk or external hard drive. Then you need to insert a full (not upgrade) disc of XP then restart your computer and run from the disc.

RAM = Random access memory and is what the computer uses to run programs, it emptys it's self, however shutting the computer down for a few minutes help completely clear it.    The only way to get more RAM is by haveing it installed and that will depend on the motherboard haveing spare slots, or you can just get the single chip replaced by a more powerful chip. alot of places can help you do this, I do not recommend takeing it apart yourself unless you have very good computer tech knowledge.     If your asking about ROM = Read only memeory or hard drive space this is completely different. To get more memory to store video's, music, or programs on your laptop you can go to Add/remove software and delete programs that you no longer use or by deleteing other items directly from your computer. The only other option is buying a bigger hard drive and haveing it installed, they can ghost your old hard drive so that when you turn your laptop on it's the same as you had it set just with more hard drive space. The size of the hard drive and type you can install is also dependant on the mother board.    Most computer places can understand what you want without knowing the "Nerd" language. So either take it to them and tell them what you want or buy a new computer but pay more attention to Hard drive space and RAM.|`|725d1af1fbde17609fa8cc79cc5eb4e2aa	Stop/Uninstall the programs running that you don't need. If you're using xp, go to run and type services.msc then hit enter. You will see all the programs running on your computer. Pick the ones you don't want, right click and select stop. To uninstall, control panel then add/remove programs.    I don't think that'll free up a lot of ram unless you have a whole lot of programs that automatically run when you open your computer. To check that, go to run and type msconfig. Under Startup, it'll show you all the programs that start automatically.    ^^ Like they said, you're better off adding ram. Hope this helps. :)|`|pfebCUsQaa	You can't delete RAM. Just buy a new stick of laptop RAM and install it!     There sould be an extra spot underneath your laptop. Unscrew the door and install.

HbmKVVLTaa	Have you checked other components for problems? Sounds like it could also be a cooling issue. I would also analyze the disk with disk defrag, because it could be really really fragmented. Also, run a virus scan for safe measure, and take a look at your running processes to see if anything is hogging a ton of memory and/or cpu time. Hope I could help, and just message me if you need any explanations or directions!|`|yPqk8diuaa	Can't be certain without actually running tests.  It could be your processor is getting to hot and when it reaches a boiling point it will most likely shut down..you may try to set your operating frequency at a lower rate in the bios and see if that helps.  It could also be that you have a weak power supply, but that would only be the case if you have several hard drives and added internal/external components and perhaps running too many start-up programs at once.  You can check startup by running msconfig.exe.  Then again it could be some kind of huge cpu overload process.  Check task manager for running processes and their power usage.

If you have to, you can instead go into each computer's properties and change the workgroup name to something unique, and make sure ALL computers share that same network name.   Then you will have to share files on each individual computer that you want other users to see.  This is really something best left to a professional, but you can do it if you are willing to spend the time and do some research.|`|fhH1P6VNaa	If  its a small office with like 10 or less people  this will work fine.  Hardware needed:(If you already have this stuff then ignore)  Switch/Hub  Cat5e cable w/RJ-45 connectors (already made, saves time)  1.Connect the internet modem to the switch/hub.  2.Connect the Cat5e cable to the switch/hub.  3.Take the Cat5e cables that you plugged into the switch/hub and plug into the computers.    Computer Setup (will have to be done on every computer)  Go to Start>Control Panel>Network and Internet Connection>  Network Connections>My Network Places> Set Up a home or small business network.    If you don't plan on using the internet, just don't plug in the internet to the switch/hub. You will though have to configure the IP address.   Go to start>control panel>Network and Internet Connection>  Network Connection. Right click on the connection and select properties. select internet protocol(TCP/IP). Click use the following Ip address and enter 192.168.0.1. Click use the follwing DNS server address. the Ip address can't be the same so just change the last number for the other computers.

"Deleting" only allows you to get rid of one at a time and "restoring" puts the files back to where they were before AVG marked them as suspect.      I hope this is right as that's what I've been doing.  If you find out otherwise then please let me know haha    P.S. To test that it actually gets rid of them when you click "empty vault" I clicked "empty vault", did another virus scan and then no infections were found that time - it must work!|`|whbxWMqHaa	you should delete the infections as soon as possible before they can do any damage and watch out for the program called ANTIVIRUS 2009 it is a fake virus program downloaded off of unsecure sites that says you have infections on your computer to scare you into buying its full version and getting your credit card as well as just letting more viruses attack your computer.

If you need them, restore them on your own risk.

The advantage of a vault is restore which means if you find out a file you put there is in fact not a virus you can take it back.

AA10362792	A router is a device that forwards data packets along networks. A router is connected to at least two networks, commonly two LANs or WANs or a LAN and its ISP's network. Routers are located at gateways, the places where two or more networks connect, and are the critical device that keeps data flowing between networks and keeps the networks connected to the Internet. When data is sent between locations on one network or from one network to a second network the data is always seen and directed to the correct location by the router. They accomplish his by using headers and forwarding tables to determine the best path for forwarding the data packets, and they use protocols such as ICMP to communicate with each other and configure the best route between any two hosts.    The Internet itself is a global network connecting millions of computers and smaller networks  so you can see how crucial the role of a router is to our way of communicating and computing.    Why Would I Need a Router?  For most home users, they may want to set-up a LAN (local Area Network) or WLAN (wireless LAN) and connect all computers to the Internet without having to pay a full broadband subscription service to their ISP for each computer on the network. In many instances, an ISP will allow you to use a router and connect multiple computers to a single Internet connection and pay a nominal fee for each additional computer sharing the connection. This is when home users will want to look at smaller routers, often called broadband routers that enable two or more computers to share an Internet connection. Within a business or organization,  you may need to connect multiple computers to the Internet, but also want to connect multiple private networks  and these are the types of functions a router is designed for.|`|rH31CwjMaa	a router is somethin you connect to your modem and it makes your internet wireless so you can use your computer anywerre in the house or even in the garden.|`|f1b6b1b26d3210d42e24c9cb20a453f4aa	a router is a device that allows multiple computers to connect to each other and the internet for the purpose of sharing data.  People who need a router in the home are those with multiple devices that require internet access but don't want to have a separate modem for each one.  A typical home network would be a couple of computer's and maybe a video game console (Xbox 360, PS3, Wii) connected to router either by Ethernet (wired) or wireless.  The router in turn would be connected to a modem which in turn connects to the lines running out of the house connecting it to the internet.  You can also us a router to connect devices like a printer or projector so it can be used by any computer on the network.
maMeeV4caa	So if you use her laptop charger on your laptop, it stays in there tightly? I just want to make sure that the problem is the charger and not internal to your computer.    In any case, if the problem is with your charger, you should probably consider buying a new charger because I would not recommend tampering with the internal things. It might be dangerous.    The price of a charger is definitely NOT going to be $100. If you buy it from Topmic.com, they offer life time warranty to all laptop charger and free shipping for only $58. Of course you can also look through ebay for cheaper chargers, but some of the quality is pretty bad.  http://www.topmic.com/hp-compaq-business...    Best of luck.|`|ffqsWfZtaa	Sorry but sounds like youve bashed the plug while it in your machine and knocked the socket off your motherboard.    It will have to be opened up and re-soldered, or a new motherboard, neither option is cheap.    Otherwise if the batteries are swoppable, just use batteries and swap with your sisters when getting flat if she's agreable.    Charge sockets are one of the biggest problems on laptops these days (short of dropping them), dunno why they dont use right angle flush connectors that don't stick out and get bashed.
6YufKn6Faa	You should put it on a stand with air holes (if you have one)  http://www.gadgetvenue.com/wp-content/up...    You may want blow the fans/ air ducts with compressed air to get rid of all the dust inside the laptop (DO THIS WHILE THE LAPTOP IS OFF-FANS are not ON).     Every 2 hours try to move the laptop to another area (where the surface isn't too hot) then move it back after 2 more hours.    Try not to put the laptop on your lap. (I assume you don't)        Other than that, just buy a cooling stand, they cost 10-20 dollars, not very expensive.     http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.as...    http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.as...    http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.as...|`|Lq56mwWKaa	I use this:    http://www.amazon.com/Targus-PA248U-Note...

You may have some dust build up and that would cause your computer to get hot.  Also try putting your laptop in sleep mode when you are not using it.  but you should definitely look into getting your laptop looked at.  You may have a fan issue and it will only get worse.  18 hours sure is a long time to run it.|`|gSxZNqnKaa	use Heat sink pad for notebook computer.. you can get it from bestbuy/circuit city

PbfkwSmTaa	Short answer: its your local network. Fore more info see http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethernet|`|YvjTJPEfaa	An Ethernet is the name given to locally networked PC's it is also referred to as a LAN (Large Area Network, even if it's just your house), WLAN is a Wireless LAN.    Data is typically transmitted via the TCP/IP protocol (which is the same as is used on the internet). The best analogy is to think of the Ethernet and even the internet as a huge postal system:   Your open your browser and ask for a web page, first off your PC gets the IP address (consists of 4 numbers between 0 and 255, ie www.google.com is 74.125.77.104)  of the web server from your local Domain Name Server (DNS, think of it as the yellow pages)  your computer then puts your request into a TCP/IP packet, think of this as the envelope with the IP address of the web site on it.   You PC then sends out on the Ethernet to your Router (local post office) which then looks first to see if the server is on your local network then as is most likely the case is sends it to your internet service providers Router (Big sorting post office) which then fires it off the to appropriate web server via other Routers.  The web page is then packaged up into several packets (as it would be loo large to fit into 1 packet) and sent back to your PC via the same method.    This is sort of a high level look at TCP/IP communications for more information check out the Wikipedia link below|`|74QEDymVaa	is a high speed internet like a hotels and stuff|`|flEPUzwBaa	Ethernet is a family of frame-based computer networking technologies for local area networks (LANs). The name comes from the physical concept of the ether. It defines a number of wiring and signaling standards for the Physical Layer of the OSI networking model, through means of network access at the Media Access Control (MAC) /Data Link Layer, and a common addressing format.    Ethernet is standardized as IEEE 802.3. The combination of the twisted pair versions of Ethernet for connecting end systems to the network, along with the fiber optic versions for site backbones, is the most widespread wired LAN technology. It has been in use from around 1980 to the present, largely replacing competing LAN standards such as token ring, FDDI, and ARCNET.    We have Ethernet modems and wireless modems and usb modems and...........  Ethernet modems work with an ethernet cable that is connected to pc........in that way you need an ethernet driver for your computer...........realtek drivers usually help............|`|NuP56uk8aa	Ethernet is a family of frame-based computer networking technologies for local area networks (LANs). The name comes from the physical concept of the ether. It defines a number of wiring and signaling standards for the Physical Layer of the OSI networking model, through means of network access at the Media Access Control (MAC) /Data Link Layer, and a common addressing format.    Ethernet is standardized as IEEE 802.3. The combination of the twisted pair versions of Ethernet for connecting end systems to the network, along with the fiber optic versions for site backbones, is the most widespread wired LAN technology. It has been in use from around 1980[1] to the present, largely replacing competing LAN standards such as token ring, FDDI, and ARCNET.        Ethernet was originally based on the idea of computers communicating over a shared coaxial cable acting as a broadcast transmission medium. The methods used show some similarities to radio systems, although there are fundamental differences, such as the fact that it is much easier to detect collisions in a cable broadcast system than a radio broadcast. The common cable providing the communication channel was likened to the ether and it was from this reference that the name "Ethernet" was derived.    From this early and comparatively simple concept, Ethernet evolved into the complex networking technology that today underlies most LANs. The coaxial cable was replaced with point-to-point links connected by Ethernet hubs and/or switches to reduce installation costs, increase reliability, and enable point-to-point management and troubleshooting. StarLAN was the first step in the evolution of Ethernet from a coaxial cable bus to a hub-managed, twisted-pair network. The advent of twisted-pair wiring dramatically lowered installation costs relative to competing technologies, including the older Ethernet technologies.    Above the physical layer, Ethernet stations communicate by sending each other data packets, blocks of data that are individually sent and delivered. As with other IEEE 802 LANs, each Ethernet station is given a single 48-bit MAC address, which is used both to specify the destination and the source of each data packet. Network interface cards (NICs) or chips normally do not accept packets addressed to other Ethernet stations. Adapters generally come programmed with a globally unique address, but this can be overridden, either to avoid an address change when an adapter is replaced, or to use locally administered addresses.    Despite the significant changes in Ethernet from a thick coaxial cable bus running at 10 Mbit/s to point-to-point links running at 1 Gbit/s and beyond, all generations of Ethernet (excluding early experimental versions) share the same frame formats (and hence the same interface for higher layers), and can be readily interconnected.    Due to the ubiquity of Ethernet, the ever-decreasing cost of the hardware needed to support it, and the reduced panel space needed by twisted pair Ethernet, most manufacturers now build the functionality of an Ethernet card directly into PC motherboards, obviating the need for installation of a separate network card.|`|qvl3PjdEaa	Ethernet doesn't have a meaning. It is an object.    An Ethernet Cable is a network cable used to share data between systems or a modem/router (or both) for the internet.    Ethernet connectors are coded RJ-45 and are considerably bigger than the RJ-11 cables (telephone cable) that ADSL uses.    Hope this helped    FX

A browser (eg Internet Explorer) is not a website editor. It's a tool to only view HTML documents.     Now, there are sites like LiveJournal, for example, where you can create an account and have your own journal. So from that point of you, you can edit a site.    The more complex answer is, that some browsers, provide you with some web development tools, which for debugging purposes, let you edit some data on a site. Nevertheless, these changes are temporary: once you refresh the page they're lost.    Oh and another possibility is, to hack the site, but that's illegal and I don't advise doing that.

This is necessary. Your registry holds all the information regarding updates, installs, un-installs etc. Each one of those events produces a key. That key needs your PC's resources and free space. So, if you clean your registry, you make more resources available for speed. Do a registry scan if you got more than 20 errors you should clean it.  http://www.delete-computer-history.com/w...    2. Clear your Windows cache files, this is your temporary file. It can grow up to a large volume and stop your computer from using RAM properly.

Click Start, click "Control Panel", and then double-click "Internet Options".  3. On the General tab, click "Delete Files" under Temporary Internet Files.  4. In the Delete Files dialog box, click to select the "Delete all offline content" check box , and then click OK.  5. Click OK.    3. Manage your startups. Your excess CPU usage is due to too many programs running in the background. You can cut these to barebones by alter your msconfig. Here is how:    1. Open your Start menu.  2. Click Run  3. In the command screen type "msconfig.exe"  4. In the "system configuration utility",click either "service" or "startup" tab  5. Uncheck all programs that your are no longer using.  6.

Some people run into issues when trying to create a dual boot environment on the same hard drive (especially with Vista 64 installed first) ... even though XP is on a different partition.    To avoid any possible corruption and/or issues I suggest adding a second hard drive for the XP installation. You can then choose which OS to boot from via the BIOS boot menu option "F8 or F10".

Most games published in the last year are 32-bit games, and a 64 bit OS has no issues with it...provided you have the patch for the 64 bit OS for the game(s). After all, there are no 64 bit games right now.     Right now, the only games a 64 bit OS can not run are 16bit or older games, and most 32 bit OS's have the same issues with 8 bit and older games.

Lets say you have a diary. in the diary you divide pages and group them for different activities. you keep all your information in there by writing in them. the same way a hard disk is a device that stores all your information in it. it is denoted by the letter C:> which is also called the C:> prompt. if you make partitions in your hard disk you divide the space and each space automatically gets a letter in an ascending order. so the next partition will get the letter D:> and so on. You will be able to see this information through My Computer on your desktop. When every you use any program it will automatically store this information on your C:> drive unless you specify otherwise. You can make directories in there which is like creating a room and putting all the information in that room so that it is easy to find.

Answer:   A hard disk drive (HDD), commonly referred to as a hard drive, hard disk, or fixed disk drive,[1] is a non-volatile storage device which stores digitally encoded data on rapidly rotating platters with magnetic surfaces. Strictly speaking, "drive" refers to a device distinct from its medium, such as a tape drive and its tape, or a floppy disk drive and its floppy disk. Early HDDs had removable media; however, an HDD today is typically a sealed unit (except for a filtered vent hole to equalize air pressure) with fixed media.[2]    HDDs (introduced in 1956 as data storage for an IBM accounting computer[3]) were originally developed for use with general purpose computers. During the 1990s the need for large-scale, reliable storage, independent of a particular device, led to the introduction of embedded systems such as RAID arrays, network attached storage (NAS) systems and storage area network (SAN) systems that provide efficient and reliable access to large volumes of data. In the 21st century, HDD usage expanded into consumer applications such as camcorders, cellphones, digital audio players, digital video players (e.g. the iPod Classic), digital video recorders, personal digital assistants and video game consoles.    If you are using windows operating system, open my computer and you will see the different drives, life "C" drive and "E" drive  You can store in them. by copy pasting or downloading from internet or any tumb drive.    If the computer crashes, to prevent it, you have to take a backup of your system and databackup.    You also have various third party tool to recover them even if they are deleted     eg: getmydataback    - Benny|`|d8600fc00f9c478e4a0f1b80ac800ce6aa	well the best way for me to explane it is to give you my yahoo messinger address.then i can explane in detail.      freetowitnis2002@yahoo.com

Usually there is a price performance break point in the pricing of the parts, so unless you really need the facilities or performance of a particular bit look for this.    Eg dropping from a 160GB hard drive to an 80Gb will not save much but half your starage.

LlFJ1ECeaa	Hi,    I found this to be related to Liveupdate for Symantec products.    have Norton Ghost 12 installed which uses the standalone liveupdate and Internet Security 2009 which has its own built in liveupdate.    The automatic standalone liveupdate is trying to update NIS 2009 which won't happen and hence the error.    I have turned off the automatic standalone liveupdate, I now manually perform and deselect any products that it is trying to update related to NIS 2009 as this will look after its self.    To test run and prove the point, run liveupdate and allow for it to try an update of NIS 2009, then run again and only allow for it to update in my case Ghost 12.    The rcapp.exe is part of the updates installation, it will delete itself after install - I used sysintenals Process Monitor to trace the exe creation and its path as on my vista system I could not find the file either.

m9bRpmN4aa	I assume you have an editing program, yes? :) Such as Photoshop. Because you can't make those graphic texts on the internet, you'll need your own program along with a good solid skill of graphical design and knowledge in that area.    You'll need to first download those certain fonts, from any font website you prefer. If you already have the fonts you want, open up Photoshop (or any other editing program you have, I use GIMP, it's exactly like Photoshop, only it's for free), and write out your text on a blank canvas. From then you can decorate it and edit around with it, using layers and patterns and brushes. It takes a lot of practice and patience and skill. Your friend and many other people with layout sites, must have really good skills with graphical design and Photoshop or any other editing program in general. I have self taught myself to edit pictures and make my own layouts and it's taken me nearly 2 years to even master basic things, like transfering a background behind an image and layering images.    A lottaaa hard work :)  Hope I helped in some way.    P.s: Google tutorials for those text graphics!

Don't forget that later, you'd also have to pay "royalties" for every   single time that somebody clicks on one of your videos that has  "their music".

Checks contain MAGNETIC INK (those account number and bank routing numbers are printed in magnetic ink) which requires special cartridge. So you can't print those on stock paper.     You can get a VersaCheck print kit, which comes with special check anti-forge paper as well as magnetic ink cart, but those ain't exactly cheap.   ---  Kasey C, PC guru since Apple II days  I don't suffer from insanity.

Therefore, it's trivially easy to find out which internet addresses are TOR-relayers, and oftentimes forums / messageboards will block TOR from posting new threads.   There will be a window of time where this information is unknown.     If you have to login using a username / password forums do not block based on IP addresses, they block based on username.

Be noted that the viewer needs to have MSN Plus! installed to view the colored result:-    Bold:    Italic: &  Strike Out: '  Underline: @  Color: $  Terminate: 0    To use the color code you would need to put a color value after the $ sign.    For example to get orange you would have to use $7 as 7 is the code for orange. These numbers ase similar to mIRC Color Codes.    More Examples of Color Codes:  White: $0 (White)  Black: $1 (Black)  Marine: $2 (Marine)  Green: $3 (Green)    Red: $4 (Red)  Brown: $5 (Brown)  Purple: $6 (Purple)  Orange: $7 (Orange)  Yellow: $8 (Yellow)  Lime: $9 (Lime)  Teal: $10 (Teal)  Aqua: $11 (Aqua)  Blue: $12 (Blue)  Pink: $13 (Pink)  Gray: $14 (Gray)  Silver : $15 (Silver)    You can also set a background color.  For that the format will be: foreground color,$background color  So if you want white text on pink ;) background :  $0,13    More examples of background or highlighting:    Black text on White Background $1,0    White text on Black Background $0,1    White text on Marine Background $0,2    White text on Green Background $0,3    White text on Red Background $0,4    White text on Brown Background $0,5    White text on Purple Background $0,6    White text on Orange Background $0,7    Red text on Yellow Background $4,8    White text on Lime Background $0,9    White text on Teal Background $0,10    White text on Aqua Background $0,11    White text on Blue Background $0,12    White text on Pink Background $0,13    White text on Gray Background $0,14    White text on Silver Background $0,15     You can wrap these Color Codes with Bold/Italic/Underline/Strikeout codes.  So if you wanna have a Bold Orange text you put:   $7    Use 0 to terminate a code.    So to have 1st part in Bold and 2nd part in Italic we do:  This is  Bold0 and this is $Italic0    ?OR use a weird maker     http://www.weirdmaker.ws/  http://www.sherv.net/weirdmaker.html  http://www.msgshit.com/weird-maker  http://www.msnletters.eu/  http://www.messletters.info/  http://www.4funnies.com/msn_weirdmaker.p...  http://www.weirdmakers.org/  http://www.weirdmakers.org/    (`?.?(`?.?**?.?)?.?)  .... *. ? .* ..?

a90UOSltaa	Can you connect to your router via ethernet cable?  I would try that first and see if you can get on the internet.    You could try uninstalling/reinstalling the router, sometimes settings get messed up.    Or reset the router to factory settings, look for a small hole at the back of the router and press it down for 30 secs or less i believe.    You will then have to use the IP address to config the settings again.

Fp0jrUtOaa	You didn't explain exactly what you mean by "the internet connection" so let me lay out a couple of scenarios.    If he has his own computer that he is attaching to a shared internet connection, there is not much you can do other than unplugging him from the router.  You could talk to your ISP to see if they have an option.    If he is using your computer (or a shared family computer), you have more options.  First, though, you will need to set up individual accounts on the computer, each with their own logon and at least yours with a good strong password.    Once you've got separate accounts, the easiest way to control the internet connection is to install a parental controls program.  Vista has an okay set of parental controls built in (you get to it through the Control Panel) or there are a number of reputable third party programs you can put on the computer.    All of them will allow you to set limits on when the computer can be used, limit which users can download and what they can download, control sites, etc.  None of them are perfect but they should be adequate to the needs you described.    Since you say that it's your little brother's behavior that you're worried about, I would strongly recommend that you talk to a parent about setting it up.  Even if it's your computer, having a parent install the parental controls can take a lot of the heat out of the dispute.
02FwhyMSaa	To distinctively say one is faster than the other isn't possible. Why isn't it possible? ...because there isn't any specific facts (because there is no way of fairly testing) page loading time. Saying that though, some do argue Safari is faster.    Personally I've grown fond of Firefox because it's everything you need: loads of available add-ons, fast, uses a good rendering engine, is safer than IE (for example) and is an all round good package.    At the end of the day, it's down to personal preference. With the arrival of IE8 (being significantly quicker at rendering pages than its predecessors) it's anyone's game I'd say.

Note that the actual range and performance of any wireless router varies substantially depending on conditions of the environment such as obstructions and radio interference.

iUTY2LR1aa	Yes. If the software you use to upload does not limit the upload speed, but rather uses the full upload bandwidth, your downloads and browsing will lag considerably.    This is because for each received data packet your computer needs to send an acknowledge in order to continue receiving. If your upload bandwidth is fully utilized by your file upload, these acknowledges will not be able to be sent in a timely manner, and the other side will assume you are not receiving all its packets, and therefore will lower its upload speed (your download speed).    If you can control the bandwidth usage of the upload (restrict it to about 80% of your upload bandwidth), that should be a good trade-off. Obviously you can't always do that, depending on what software you're using.|`|aXC7elejaa	Yes. Uploading uses more bandwidth that downloading from mu experience and I'm using Cable internet.

Assuming that the street address is always separated from City by a comma and is always the first comma,    B2 = LEFT( A2, FIND( ",", A2) - 1)    Assuming that your zipcode is always five digits,    E2 = RIGHT( A2, 5)    Assuming that your state is always 2 digits and is separated from the five digit zipcode by one space,    D2 = MID( A2, LEN(A2) - 7, 2)    Assuming the ones above work and that the street address, city and state are separated by both a comma and a space, you can get the city out of the middle by   C2 = MID( A2, FIND( ",", A2) + 2, LEN( A2) - LEN(B2) - 12)    Hope that helps.  ------------------------  Updated answer:  I just tried to replicate your example.  =RIGHT(A2,5) returns 10456 for me.  Unless the formula is somehow pointing to the wrong place (A2 is a blank cell?), I don't know why it would be returning 0 for you.  Unless maybe that cell is formatted oddly - text only?  or number only?  Not sure why.    By the way, Abdul's comment about using Text-to-columns is reasonable if you have consistent delimiters that you can use to sort the columns.  If your dataset already had a comma between the state and zip, that's what I would have recommended instead of the workaround above.|`|SrfLbfwMaa	Here is a full Address separator  http://file1.net/project.asp?id=86    It work just as you requesting    Enjoy it    VBAXLMan|`|MAa4ez4Faa	I suggest u to try the Data > Text to columns rather than formulas.   but ensure u separate it correctly. Like separate NY 10456 as one component using comma as delimiter and then use space to separate  them into NY and 10456. Initially use the comma for separation and then space for further separation. that shall do. Happy Excel . Cheers Abdul

dG4N31Gkaa	After your satellite Internet service has been installed you will be ready to connect your wireless network. Start by connecting your satellite Internet modem to the router. Your router will then send signals to your computer via infrared signals. Configure your router following the instructions that came with your router.    If you are using a wireless network adapter you will want to plug this into a USB port in your computer. If your computer came with an internal wireless card you should receive the signal through the card. If you purchased your router before installation, most installers will assist you in setting up your router. If not, just follow the instructions per the router manual. It's pretty simple!    There is one thing to keep in mind. When two or more people are surfing the Internet at one time, the Internet connection speed is shared. So if you subscribe to a service using 512k speeds, you both could be splitting the speed. With this in mind be selective when choosing your satellite Internet Service plans. You will all then be happier with your satellite Internet service in the end.|`|ffqsWfZtaa	Use a wireless hub or repeater or extender, the satellite probably already has a router.    Basically you need summut with an RJ45 input and wireless output.    If satellite doesnt have a router (or provider is un-co-operative), then get a wireless router (make sure it takes ethernet in on the WAN side), set its wan settings to the same as your PC wired settings, you will probably need to enter username and password into it as well. then set up wireless as per the router instructions, or your personal preferances.    Can take a fair bit of faffing about depending on the sattelite system but some of do try to charge silly amounts to share the connection.

There is no way to get every piece out of there, so you need to replace the whole thing.    Next time, double check that there are no cracks in a CD before you put it in the drive.  A little crack might not seem like much, but when you get it spinning up to speed, then that little crack can suddenly grow and shatter the entire CD.|`|8QWr77YZaa	cd rom?    1)Go to Best Buy    2) Blow 4.99$ USD and buy a new one.|`|uPqtcXHvaa	CD drives are not very easy to clean out.  I'd try removing the drive from your computer case and carefully shaking it (with the drive door open) to dislodge the remaining pieces.  It was very smart of you to reassemble the pieces to find out what what missing!    I worry that the problem that broke your disk in the first place might be inside your CD drive.  CD drive prices have come down a lot, so your safest bet might be to simply replace the drive.  If there is a Circuit City near you, they may have a few left at a great discount price right now, since they're going out of business.|`|7pAXElgSaa	its likely the "exploading" CD damaged the drive so it would be best to just get a new one.

But it still might be shot, so if you do take it apart and it still doesn't work then your going to have to buy a new one.  I'm assuming you have a 52x drive.  If I were you I'd buy a new drive thats slower than a 52x.  It may be rare but cd do break in them, as you have just proven.  Check this out, it a mythbusters clip and it were I found out about the 52x problem, http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v0QT4Y1Y3...|`|gKPSgvuHaa	dont listen to anyone else who answered this question they dont know what they are talking about...    you can easly and safely fix this all you need is a philips screwdriver and a flat head. take the case off of the comptuer, now whether the cd drive is SATA or IDE these steps should be the same. un hook the cddrvie unscrew it from the case, push gethly on the back of the drive. take apart the cd drive. Note you will not have to take the entire drive apart there is a (usualy) gray case that you can take off(with a philips) and there you have it, the inside of the cd drive should now be exposed, you can shake the drive clean, or you can (not really a great idea, but will work the best) use the hose of a vacume and suck the pices out.  then put everything back together and put it back in the computer, it should work again,    when ever working on a computer, make sure that you are grounded, if you do not own a grounding strap work on a surface away from carpet or cloth, (kitchen table on lanolium or tile or wood) is the best place(s) then simply touch somthing mettal(not inside the computer) and you have equalized the charge of your self and the computer.     static is bad for computer components and can(over time) dystroy them.

It doesn't know how to tell Word to use the file as a template rather than as a document because it doesn't use the Windows file association list for the .dot or .dotx file type. It just pulls the file down and hands it to Word.  If Word isn't told otherwise, it opens all files as documents.    Sorry.

4a3e0ab4ecb4787c195a06580c2aa131aa	Some schools and colleges allow their students and staff to produce their own live websites from their servers. Your teacher or IT people should be able to tell you if this is possible on the server you made your pages on.    If not, you need to upload your files on to a web host. These can either be free or paid, some offer server processing (usually PHP or ASP), whilst others don't. There's a good list of free web hosts with the services they offer and reviews at http://www.free-webhosts.com/    Your web host usually dictates your home URL, but you can always get a domain name of your own later and use a redirect to wherever you host your site.    Most hosts allow uploads using FTP, others make you use their online uploader. You dod not usually need to produce your own public_html directory, this is because your "root" directory on most hosts is usually set for you.    There are at least 6 methods of uploading files to a web server, see http://brisray.com/comp/cwbasics1.htm FT... for more details on this.    Good luck with your project. It seems complicated to start but it's really just a matter of transferring files from one computer to another. The rest is just advertising your site.    If you have a spare computer, a broadband connection - you do not have to have a T1 or fiber optic connection - and your ISP allows it you can always host your files from home. If you want to have a go at that see http://brisray.com/comp/cwserver1.htm (Windows) or http://brisray.com/comp/clserver1.htm (Linux)|`|s4rvCoA8aa	To get it online, you either need to upload the page to an online web host, or you need to run a server off of your home computer.

Sounds like what's going on here is that you want to install some programs but your hard drive doesn't have the available amount of space on the drive to do so.    You really only have a few options here. You can buy a new larger hard drive, you can buy an external drive to move extra programs not in use onto that drive, or you can remove programs that only need to be on your drive.

SJM0rzHtaa	No, the power supply isn't too weak.  It's perfectly fine for driving a weak card like a 8400GS.    The 8400GS is a low, low, low budget card.  It has a mere 16 stream processors, compared to 112 in the 8800GT gamer card.  THAT is the reason why your games don't run fast, not the PSU.    Of course if you want a better graphics card you will probably need to upgrade the PSU too.

2arZOZWgaa	When you use the power switch, programs that are running are shut down immediately, including the operating system.  If a program is accessing the hard drive or RAM, this could (though unlikely) cause data corruption, which is a very bad thing.    A server is what you connect to when you go to a website or check your email, it is a special computer that handles these type of requests.    RAM is Random Access Memory, which is the kind of memory in your computer that is lost when you turn off your computer.  The other type is the hard drive which is where the information is not lost, but accessing the hard drive is much slower than accessing RAM.    The CPU is the brains of the computer, handling all of the processing.  A fast CPU plus a lot of RAM is what makes your computer useable for your day-to-day tasks.|`|othezA6Caa	When you are turning off the computer with the "shut-down" button via the system unit automatically shuts down all running programs, which in some cases on be lethal to the computer and cause permanent damage to the systems hard drive.

ebuxHnScaa	This is usually due to a power profile mismatch. That is, your laptop is rejecting every profile offered by the phone, usually because it can't offer the phone enough power.    What has changed recently? Was the phone battery fully charged before and it isn't now? Was the laptop on external power and now it's on battery? Are other devices connected to USB ports on your laptop (leaving less power for the phone)? Are you using a different USB port than you were before?    Providing external power to your phone, to your laptop, or using a USB hub that gets its own power may help.

x35co5F8aa	Microsoft have a great many underhand methods of achieving it's many aims. Making money is only one of these aims - another one is simply domination.    One way of doing this is by confusing issues, perhaps making it easier for retailers to tell people what they should have. They like to hammer smaller users by making them pay more as individuals than 200 individuals say - in a big organisation. It's rather underhand and very unfair.    Behind the scenes, they pay retailers to recommend their products, they also pay retailers to avoid selling other alternatives, and they offer big discounts to retailers that offer no choice - personally I have little knowledge of 'licensing' for office. My Office suite is an easy licence - I have an installer on my flashdrive and can install it in as many computers as I wish, for as many users as I want, and that applies to business and home environments - I use Open Office.    There's a good reason that several governments have opted to go for Open Source software and ditch Microsoft - there's too much FUD and antitrust activity going on behind the scenes.    The most famous licence option for Microsoft is the 'torrent' option - which they tend to completely write off as 'acceptable losses' because their number one aim is (and has been for over ten years) to reach a stage where people assume that WIN32 is the normal platform.    Funny - NORMAL internet runs on linux, and I run linux - it's great, no virus here... (Microsoft ran a lot of linux in the past, I'm not sure how embarassed they got when this information went public, but one famous document shows them telling their people to tell lies to give the impression that their servers are cheaper and better...)    What do you use?    @Pango - just as I said - so they can screw the smaller users for more money than the big corporations|`|AA10326023	So large organisations don't have to fork out a thousand bucks to licence 200 editions of the software. An enterprise licence gives an organisation one product key that can be used say 200 times. This works out to be alot cheaper than paying for 200 individual licences.   However, individual users (you or me) are subject to a different licencing scheme - we only need one key, so that's all we have to pay for.

Their question probably was asked just to be doing something and to see their Avatar and UserName in YA.    I have had Questioners also pick a Best Answer for the wrong reason(s). Some BA's answers were not even correct! Go figure.    Guess it boils down to basic human nature being what it is and the capriciousness of people.

It is then sent to the community for voting, which is a bit silly really as the answer the community picks might not be the correct one for the person who originally asked the question.

5zSSGKBpaa	Lots of questions. Let me try to answer one by one.    1. dual boot; see the first link below how to dual boot. You can use xandros or any distro.    2. Linux can read and write to and from windows but not reliably vice versa. To be able to transfer both ways you should have a partition in windows formatted as fat32, then those files would be accessible easily to both distros.    4. A virtual machine in windows would not be a lot easier.    3. Which version of linux. It is really a matter of personal taste, but before installing I would suggest that you get the live-cds for various linux distros to see which one will work best on YOUR laptop hardware. Some versions of linux have problems with some graphics cards (nvidia seems to work best) and wireless cards. The live-cd will not make any changes to your hard drive, and it will run a little slow because it is running from the cd and not the hard drive. Once it is installed it will run like all your other programs. If everything works with the live-cd everything will work when installed. If for example your wireless won't work with the live-cd if you install it it will need to have some work done (look for and install new drivers, edit configuration files, etc). It CAN usually be fixed but it will take a little work and for a person new to linux it can be very frustrating.  You should go to :  http://distrowatch.com/search.php  and use the search engine to filter which distro would be best for you. You can select a version for beginners, or multimedia, or a special purpose. You can read reviews and articles about each distro. You can select a distro for ease of use, needs little ram  or hard drive space, popularity, most software packages available, amount of  customization,etc.  In the end every linux user has tried several distros before settling on any one. And even after years of use it is not unusual for someone to switch to another distro. It is very easy to switch distros and preserve all your personal files.   Have fun|`|AA11082635	Hi !!     Dual boot is not a bad option you can go for this.now how to do this,install linux as normally we do at the startup after installation you'll have automatic option of selecting OS.dont format your previous Os and also install it on seperate partition.  Yes you'll be able to access file from both OS.I am using MEPIS,Ubuntu,Mandreva,opensus  and Redhat.Redhat is the most popular and also it pays well to know about it.    And yes you can run this on virtual machine as well but it depends upon your requirement.You can also use LIVE CD.IT'll boot directly from your dvd rom without any installation.      If you have any question you can contact me at     www.liveperson.com/irfan    Regards|`|4MYWPD9Yaa	Wow. I have to say I'm surprised you think Xandros is awesome. Well, to each her own, I guess.    A virtual machine would probably be the best thing to start with (save yourself a burnt CD and potential hardware compatibility troubleshooting):  http://www.psychocats.net/ubuntu/virtual...    But after that if you want to step up to a dual-boot, Wubi is probably the best way to go, as it doesn't require repartitioning, and you can remove Linux later easily just as you would uninstall any Windows program:  http://www.psychocats.net/ubuntu/wubi

0FQbkesxaa	When I used to use Geocities (A long time ago), I was pretty sure it had an option to build pages, using HTML, from scratch.  If you go under the "Create and Update" tab, there is a web based HTML editor you can use.  Also under the "Create and Update" tab there is a "File Manager"  where you can monitor all your files that you've uploaded and should be able to directly edit the HTML of your pages.  It all works with firefox and does not need any downloading.      I don't think geocities offers sub domains, but you might be able to use a site such as http://www.no-ip.com to create a custom sub domain that redirects to your geocities page (Also free).  Either way, using free hosting services severely limits your choices.    If you are a university student, you may already have access to free hosting through your university.  You would probably just have to create the HTML in notepad and then upload it to the server.    If you have any more questions feel free to contact me!|`|Vcte2eUtaa	Online, from scratch ?

La noche del estreno, los monitores fuera del cine dejaban salir a todo volumen los efectos de sonido de la pelcula y los gritos de la descuidada vctima, que en este caso es Iliana Fox. Hoy, que el triler da vueltas por todo mundo, principalmente a travs del internet, la cinta sigue prometiendo y parece que cumplir.  Kilmetro 31 es un gran intento de cinte de terror en Mxico. Producida y rodada en Mxico (aunque hay dinero espa?ol metido en el proyecto), no slo se encarga de homenajear a otras cintas de terror, muchas de ellas ya clsicas, en la historia del cine, sino que rescata un gran elemento del cual Mxico se haba olvidado.    Kilmetro 31 es tambin el reencuentro con la antigua leyenda de La Llorona, a la que involucran con toda una serie de extra?os sucesos en el tenebroso Kilmetro 31 de la carretera al Desierto de los Leones. Tomando en cuenta ese antecedente, la cinta sin duda seguir sonando.    Hay que agregar adems, sin entrar al terreno de la crtica, que los efectos especiales, tanto en imagen como en audio, son realmente sorprendentes y que ambos lucen y lucen bien en el triler que ya puede verse en cines y en Internet.

DSOJvIhtaa	Keep it, it'll save you from having to dig for a Windows CD when it asks you.|`|f3bb70dee35ef28e84fcc054691669dbaa	Keep the folder I386.  The folder is used when windows needs certain files, to install windows components and many other things.  If you delete the folder there is a possibility that the computer will not boot properly after installing, reinstalling or uninstalling componets.     If you only have quarter of a gig left on your c: drive then you need to look for installation file then video files, that are not being used in programs and place them on an external hard drive or CD.    You can also delete most log file (not installation logs) just look for log files that are over 10 Mb and you should be fine.  Then look for the music files that you can place on a different drive or CD.  Perhaps you have a large quantity of camera images that can also be moved. (keep your favorite)    Also clean out your temp and Internet folder. Then defrag.  Your goal is to have 1/4 of hard drive space available.

AA11137435	I had the same question not to long ago. Well if the songs you bought off of iTunes are in the window where you put it on your iPod. You can put a CD in the slot and there will be a circle that'll say burn in it. So when you pick the songs and put the cd in the slot you can click the circular button and (it may take a while) it'll start burning. And you'll be good to go!    ~~~Haylea~~~    PS. I burned 5 cds and none of them have poor quality. They all sound like I just bought thtem from the stores.|`|0ruWxOPbaa	you need to burn the cd as audio cd, dont just put the song into the cd. it will be either mp3 cd or a data cd. and normal cd player cant play that. use Nero, and burn the cd as audio cd.|`|Zgn7fgKSaa	No, because itunes is apple based it will put on an mpeg 4 format. The only reason to put songs of iTunes onto a cd is for back up purposes.

krTaNiEoaa	Yes, but there is another way of doing it. Try going to BIOS and make another room in the hard drive, When you install windows make sure you Label the hard drive (room), so you won't replace your current OS. I am running XP and Vista on my PC and I don't get anything error when reformatting the drive. When you reformat one room, it will not reformat your full hard drive, because it done in it room, meaning they can't annoy other rooms. There is no RAM problem for me, cause only your current OS you are running is the only OS that uses RAM.    When you have finished installing windows, at start up it will ask you what OS you want to run|`|rMs4WBfcaa	Save all your files on an external HDD.  Set boot order to boot from cd first, put the XP OS disk in the cd rom drive and reboot.  Follow the instruction on the setup file|`|aZ3UBG5eaa	Try this:    either reinstall XP but select the Preserve files option.  Or install XP on an external HDD or an internal HDD. Then you will be able to access the files on your other HDD.|`|Km4LMsWDaa	Not if you partition your drive. There are many free tools to do so.|`|YESUhp8gaa	I could propley tell you about the repair console, but I would have to know what the computer's error message was.    Anyway when you want to install another operating system on another computer, it is suggest that you put in a separate partition. On the ubuntu there is a partition editor under system> admin (forget exact name) > partition editor    Use that tool to resize a partition and use the unallocated space to put a new partition in it. Preferably the latest ext format, but if you want windows to read it, try NTFS. After that install ubuntu on the partition you made. then reboot the computer, grub bootload will load and put up into ubuntu. You can access your files from there.    I should tell you that you can access the files from the ubuntu cd, as long as the hard drive didn't crash.  Also when you install ubuntu on a computer it is said that atleast 10 gbs are good. Ubuntu is a different OS then windows was, you will notice several differences between the two, and I am not just asking about the space.    Also not that you install ubuntu on the whole disk without partitioning the drive, it will overwrite your files and will be lost. These intruction by differ a bit as I am not on a linux OS right now, and are not made for hard drive failure or when hard drive was reformated    Also about the beep thing, I can not tell you without the knowledge of your BIOS. As beep codes can differ from BIOS to BIOS, such as AMI say's parity failure and IBM say POST error see message on screen.

vL2Ec50Yaa	Sorry to say, but where you went to get the information from - Crucial - well I have had problems with accuracy with them also.    I did a Google search and came up with PC2100  as the speed you should be using.  Check it out: http://www.laptopmemoryupgrade.com/memor...    I would go back to the store that you bought it from and see what they will do for you.  Have them switch out the ram for you or switch it out in front of them.    Hope this helps.|`|1NWjta2jaa	If it works with the original chip, it means the new chip is bad or not compatible. Yes, I know you checked, but what else can it be? If the computer actually worked, but simply didn't recognize additional memory, it would be BIOS settings, but you are saying it will not even turn on.   Have the store install memory for you. The stores that have repair departments charge for the memory (which you need to pay anyway) and a very small amount for installation (some even do it for free.)

Check the connections inside your computer 'box' ... when you 'insert' the drive, you are probably simply pushing just far enough away from your 'internet card' to disconnect it.  When you pull it out again, it reconnects.    2.

Note that you can't really represent EVERY single color with 8 bits. If you increase it to 16 bits or 24 bits, then you can get more shades of colors.|`|9deadd6e8a062fbd9204d1b3f5c12c52aa	The reason why they need 8 bits is because each color is given an 8 digit value. Using only zeroes and ones. For example:  0000000  0000001  0000010  0000011  ... etc ...  11111100  11111101  11111110  11111111    when the computer is counting like this the last number (11111111) is equal to 256 in decimal value. Therefore each one of the 256 colors has a value.|`|AA10049336	Actually, on a computer, a combination of Red, Green, and Blue (much like TV) make up the colors.     Let me preface this answer by explaining that each pixel on your monitor requires memory storage somewhere on your video card  to keep track of which color is displayed (per pixel).  With an average resolution of 1024x768 pixels, using RGB "True Color" (32bit) coloring consumes over 3 megabytes (24 megabits) of video memory.  Keep this in mind later when I discuss early video cards.    IBM PC computers originally only displayed two colors - black and white.  Eventually this was upgraded to 16 colors (4 bits), then 256 (8 bits), and so on up to 16.7 million colors.  However, since the graphics displays were limited in capacity these older systems relied on a palette of colors instead of a RGB value for each pixel.  This kept memory requirments to a minimum.  Some systems defined specific colors on the palette, while others allowed the palette to be customized, but each pixel on the screen referenced a color somewhere in the palette.    This was done for a variety of reasons, but mostly because memory was EXPENSIVE.  In early graphics cards, 64 kilobytes (65546 bytes) of memory was average, 256KB (262144 bytes) was considered HUGE.  A standard VGA montor (640 x 480 pixels - ultra low-res by today's standards) contains 307200 pixels.  Using 256 colors (8 bits or 1 byte) means 307200 bytes of memory on the video card...not possible for early graphics cards.    Later, as graphics progressed and memory prices dropped, video cards kept adding memory and it became much more common to represent the colors using the Red, Green and Blue intensities (0..255), simply because the cards could handle it.  However, today's IBM PC are technically compatible with the original IBM PC of yesteryear and most can still run the original graphics modes.  Hence the 256 colors.    Nowadays, 32MB of memory on a video card is considered TINY but these are easily capable of displaying high-resolution graphics at 16.7 million colors.

RZQnxoF1aa	Windows freezes or stops responding frequently.  This issue could be caused by any of the below possibilities.   1. Software related issue.   2. Driver related issue.   3. Operating system related issue.   4. Heat related issue.   5. Hardware issue.   6. Serious issue with Windows   7. Hardware failure.        An easy way to determine if your computer is in this situation is by pressing the Num Lock button on the keyboard and watching the Num Lock led to see if it turns off and/or on.  If you're able to get the light to turn off an on, press CTRL + ALT + DEL and attempt to end task the program.  Software related issue    A computer locking up or freezing is often is caused by a software related issue. If you're encountering lockups when the computer is opening a particular program, make sure you have all the latest updates for that program.   Update your registry cleaner tool, scan you pc.  Use the tool:  http://downloadlk.com/themosteffectivere... [if you do not have one]  Driver related issue   A computer lock up can also be caused by drivers. For example, if there is an issue that exists with your video drivers a computer could lock up while playing a game or displaying any other type of video. Make sure you have the latest drivers for all major devices in your computer (video, sound, modem, and network). Operating system related issue   Make sure your operating system has all of the latest updates installed on it.   Heat related issue   If the computer processor is getting too hot it can cause the computer to freeze. If you have heard any abnormal noises coming from your computer recently such as a high squealing, this could indicate a fan may be failing in your computer.|`|jmq2i59Jaa	be careful with revo you can wind up taking out useful programs with it

2F5XkiHLaa	Hotmail does not empty inboxes on purpose or by accident. They will empty Trash folders at any time without notice, but NEVER inboxes.    There may have been a glitch in the system, causing the inbox to not display the emails. Or someone may have gotten your password & deleted all your emails. You should change your password ASAP. And don't use just a bunch of numbers, use a combination of letters & numbers & caps. Such as Bgt4Li9hHp. If they allow it, use characters such as  $%^&*+ also  .|`|1504ed0aa41d9367f9e3e5ec6d17284eaa	please turn off ur cap lock --it is unnecessary  thanks|`|6vJQduumaa	send a message to hotmail and write wat is wrong.then they will tell u wat happened and tell u a way to fix it.that's wat i done when it happend to me,and it worked.gd luck|`|THqvEAIxaa	Probably bug with Hotmail. Check your inbox tonight and they might be back. If not then email hotmail.    For now it would be best to do a virus scan then when that is completed change your password.|`|hAFxcxP0aa	Hotmail is a completely scam-free way to send emails, have profiles and chat. For tips and help about your question and problems regarding your account please read the following tips and hints.    ----- It is highly unlikely that someone knows your password if it is random numbers. But if you still think they did keep on reading.    ---- My guess is that you had many emails and it filled it all up. It might just of been the Hotmail team clearing peopels mail boxes so there is room for more or so it does not take up any more space.     ---- I suggest that you ask your friends and family or Yahoo! Answers users consistantly to see if this has ever happened to anyone. They may be able to help you out.     ----Also, change your password three times a week so that you know there is no chance that anyone could continuely guess and hack your password for your hotmail account.    ----Just forget about it. It may have just been an accident by Hotmail. Continue to use the same account and follow the tips i ahve suggested.    ----Or you can just delete this account and create a new one. Notify your contacts about this so they can still contact you through email. If you delete this account, the hacker will no longer know about you new account. This will prevent furture hack ins or accidents and will give you and everyone else a frsh start.    The Hotmail Team will be able to help you the most though. Email them and tell them what is going on. When they contact you, be polite and read what they have to say. Follow their instructions and do what you think is best.    Good Luck with your account and Best Wishes for the future.  Hope i helped...x Em....    PS The funny thing is, since i answered your question so thoroughly, wrote with good punctuation and acted very mature and grown up, it seemed to look like I was a part of the Hotmail team or soemthing. LOL trust me, I am not. I am only a kid under the age of 16, using Yahoo Answers and tryign to help out.|`|6aWLUvuQaa	Very unlikely someone hacked your outlook account, because hotmail uses a very safe encryption protocol to send information over the web. If someone had direct access to your computer or if someone gave you a virus with a keylogger attatched, (a program that monitors all the keys pressed on keyboard) then I could see where you could've been compromised. Other then that like stated its probably a glitch, contact hotmail.|`|pjJlPXWJaa	email hotmail - ask them|`|eMAN4EQMaa	someone's definitely hacking your hotmail.    yeah. they deleted EVERYTHING!!    go solve the mystery!  i solved mine, and i kinda regretted that. but at least i know who did it now :D

Other than that, you're left with the old fake profile trick!  Set up an account and send them a friend request and see what happens, but are you THAT bothered to see it that you'll enter stalker domain?!|`|uttbqGB9aa	As toonz said..lol yes request their friendship or join their network,     I don't know a thing about hacking so my alternative suggestion would be to view their friends, to get more information on them if that is what you wanted, which is kind of stalkerish, so i hope not :p    Some friends of people that are set to private have friends with open profiles.    Happy huntings :)|`|f55mQq7taa	either join their network or become their friend... or hack dat sht!|`|Btt44Vtwaa	can't do it..|`|okedJicKaa	unless the user unblocks you d don't see how.|`|euP23Nkdaa	there is no way to view someone else's info if its set to private. perhaps you could try your hand at some hacking, but i wouldn't advise it. probably could get kicked off facebook or other problems. best chance is just to talk to the person and ask to be taken off private (unless it was for a reason...). sry if thats not the answer you wanted to hear, but it's correct.

uYUGdcfzaa	With regards to previous answers the clue is in the category - Laptops & notebooks. If the HD is in 2 partitions then it will not free up any space as, usually, there is only 1 HD unit in laptops. So the actual answer is transferring files/folders to the D drive which is the disc burner which will free up the space that you desire. Any reputable piece of burning software will have a basic 'drag and drop' system to move your files, just limit it to music/documents/pictures etc. and don't move any system files.|`|KpoR3MiQaa	Unfortunately the only way to do it with programmes is to re-install each piece of software you want and then go onto custom installation (if it is an option) and then set the install folder to your d drive|`|393940f30f6cfc163edbaa3a9238ca9baa	Prodrammes, now that's way outside my expertise...|`|07e1041f41de92a29534cc87d6f3c8d8aa	Data, you just move it (drag and drop).  Programmes have to be uninstalled and re-installed in a new location - if you drag and drop them, lots of the links to the files set up on installation no longer work.    Also, be careful that a few programmes may not want to be installed anywhere other than the C drive, especially some older ones.|`|hXHBm1BSaa	You can not move programs, it breaks all the links set up in the registry. You can copy and paste data to anywhere, but you may need to tell programs where it has gone. some programs will only work with the data in their original location.  After copying over data try renaming the original folder by placing maybe an x in front of the name, and test the programs. If you can get them working with the new location, delete the original files and folders. If not, just rename the folders back.|`|iESkmcEcaa	hi you can move data. eg. my documents. highlight my documents, right click choose properties. you should see a tab called locatation along top of box. click on it. it will probably say C:\users\yourname\documents. if you change the "c" to the letter d   my documents will then be on the d partition.  as for programs that is not worth it as they are stored in program files and they also palce files in different folders and will probably not run.
wQ32Eszhaa	To have the computer's byte code i.e any computer always translates all the data into bits and then stores them as bytes in stacks register.    If you want to know about the codes that any computer works on you need the DATASHEET for that particular processor or CPU  for eg. if oyu want to know how the microprocessor 8086 works you will need a datasheet to understand it. The CPU programming is done in HEX code which is converted in bits i.e 0's and 1's by the processor.

I, however, do not like a design where a called function allocates memory on behalf of the caller. Maybe just a personal preference, but something to consider. <br>  <br>  When you say something can't be done, guys like me see that as a challenge. There's always a way. This may be a bit of a hack, but my example below shows a way to come really close to your desire to return an array. In almost all cases, though, you'll be better off passing around arrays by reference (pointer) rather than by value.<br>  <br>  #include <stdio.h><br>  <br>  #define ARRAY_LEN 5<br>  <br>  typedef struct {<br>  ? ? int a[ARRAY_LEN];<br>  } IntArray;<br>  <br>  IntArray fillArray();<br>  <br>  int main(int argc, char *argv[]) {<br>  ? ? IntArray a1 = fillArray();<br>  ? ? int i;<br>  <br>  ? ? for (i = 0; i < ARRAY_LEN; i++) {<br>  ? ? ? ? printf("%d ",a1.a[i]);<br>  ? ? }<br>  ? ? puts("");<br>  ? ? return 0;<br>  }<br>  <br>  IntArray fillArray() {<br>  ? ? IntArray intArray;<br>  ? ? int i;<br>  <br>  ? ? for (i = 0; i < ARRAY_LEN; i++) {<br>  ? ? ? ? intArray.a[i] = i;<br>  ? ? }<br>  ? ? return intArray;<br>  }<br>  <br>  #if 0<br>  <br>  Program output:<br>  <br>  0 1 2 3 4<br>  <br>  #endif|`|37aaad280fdc157daf059225c312218baa	This is because your array is allocated on the stack (read <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stack_(data_structure)" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stack_(data...</a> ). It is a place in memory where C's functions store their local variables.<br>  <br>  When a function is called a return address is placed on the call stack and its parameters are placed on the stack also along with any local variables which are allocated. However once the function returns to the caller (usually main()) it must clear the stack of local variables and main() will clear the parameters on the stack return address and restore any registers used (not sure if you've been introduced to assembly). If there was a local variable in the function (i.e your array) it is now to contain bogus thus it is corrupted. <br>  <br>  In Java everything (unless not a primitive type i.e int, float, byte , constants etc) is a reference therefore they are placed on the heap (see <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dynamic_memory_allocation)." rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dynamic_mem...</a> So this called dynamically allocated it is done at runtime (when the program is running) so it is not "cleared" in memory until garbage collection is done. These are not placed on the stack!<br>  <br>  However in C you can also return an array it just has to be dynamically allocated, this is done by malloc() I will show you an example.<br>  <br>  /* returning an initialized array of ints */<br>  <br>  #include <stdlib.h><br>  #include <stdio.h><br>  <br>  int * returnArrayBack(void){<br>        int *myArray = malloc(sizeof(int) * 10);<br>        int i; <br>        for(i = 0; i < 10; i++)<br>            myArray[i] = i;<br>        return myArray;<br>  }<br>  <br>  int main()<br>  {<br>         int *allocdArray, i;<br>         allocdArray = returnArrayBack();<br>       <br>         for(i = 0; i < 10; i++)<br>              printf("%d ", allocdArray[i] );<br>        return 0;<br>  }<br>  <br>  I know this is a lot of info to take in at once but read the texts above and check some texts which talk about how computer architecture (stack initialization, parameter passing etc). This is a little low-level but once you understand you will have a good knowledge of how both Java and C operate. <br>  <br>  I hope this helps :)|`|696ef6ca84fa9734c2fd200c2761fbe4aa	Java is a different language with different capabilites.  However, the C++ ability to use pointers allows you to obtain the same result.  Just give the function a pointer to the array that you want and fill that array in your function.  The array then has what you want.

DCXk0bVLaa	Unfortunately recording more than one thing at a time is not a plug and play routine.<br>  To get the best result a multi-track recording/editing program is needed.<br>  Audacity is the best starter app for this purpose.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://audacity.sourceforge.net/" rel="nofollow">http://audacity.sourceforge.net/</a><br>  <br>  You may also need the Lame.enc codec if you want to save your work in mp3 format.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://lame.sourceforge.net/" rel="nofollow">http://lame.sourceforge.net/</a><br>  <br>  You say you have a guitar with input. Do you mean electric guitar?<br>  If you want to record a vocal with guitar at the same time you would need an external mixer (gadget)  to plug the guitar and mic into then the mixer is plugged into the computer.<br>  Using Audacity you can record using the same method as a recording studio without using an external mixer.<br>  <br>  The basic method is you record the guitar track first. You can sing along with it but since only the guitar is plugged in only that is recorded. Tip 1: If the vocal starts at the same time as the first chord play four single notes at the same speed as the song before playing the first chord so you know when it's going to start.<br>  If you've seen a live band the drummer will often use his sticks to do a count in.<br>  Next plug in the microphone.<br>  Click the record button again and you can record the vocal along with the previously recorded guitar track. It's best to use headphones to do this so that the sound of the guitar from the speakers does not get picked up by the mic and get into the vocal track.<br>  This is the way all commercial recordings since the early 1950's have been done. Track by track. They are then mixed down to the stereo tracks you hear on CD.<br>  Tip 2: Record at the highest level possible without distorting the sound. The balance between the tracks is adjusted before exporting your mix to wav or mp3 formats.<br>  There are some effects supplied with the program. These are applied before exporting to the final stereo format.<br>  <br>  If your PC just has the small 1/8 inputs you will need to buy a converter to reduce the size from the 1/4 jack size of the guitar and mic cables.
