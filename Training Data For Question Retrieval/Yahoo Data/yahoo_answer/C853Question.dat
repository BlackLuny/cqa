I'm really just whining here but if anyone has a true answer, I'd appreciate it.  Health insurance companies want to charge me more because I smoke, but non of them cover Chantix, the patch, the gum, hypnosis, accupuncture---nothing!        They charge me more because I am a health risk, possible to cost the insurance company more in the future.  So why not help me pay for things that might help me to quit, eventually lowering theirs and my costs?      WHY????

20090205130340AAZnVBt	Business & Finance;Credit	My Credit Report Has Been Suppressed, What To Do?	I requested the assistance of a credit repair company about 2mos ago. When I went to check my scores I was blown away after discovering that there was no credit information whatsoever. Of course I contacted transuion and was told that there was an alert on my credit and that it was being handled by a "special" dept. Furthermore I was told that the co used illegal practices to raise scores and my information had a freeze on it. According to the representative there's an internal investigation being conducted and until the investigation is complete, my score will remain suppressed! There is no time frame as to when they will be finished conducting the investigation and I'm trying to purchase a home. What should I do? Will lenders allow me to show a previous credit report that displays my progress? Has anyone out there gone through a similar circumstance? If so, how long does it usually take? I would greatly appreciate you feedback.

20090205130025AAxbYJd	Business & Finance;Renting & Real Estate	Renewing lease; possible to negotiate lower rent?	I've been renting a really great house since March, 2008. My lease is up next month, and I need to decide whether or not to renew my lease. Ideally, I would love to renew; however, I'm a bit worried about the rent going up (although I have not been notified that it will or it will not). Rent is currently $850. Since we are in a recession, is there any way to negotiate a lower rent if I sign another 1-year lease? I've been a great tenant...very communicative with my landlord and rarely (maybe once or twice) late on rent. I've kept the house and grounds clean and have done everything my landlord has asked. Also, please note that my landlord is a property manager, and the actual owners of the house live out of state. I'm not sure if that makes a difference regarding negotiating rent. Thanks in advance!

My dad just turned 62 and he has not done his income tax for about 15 years!

20090205130124AAFwNaW	Business & Finance;Taxes;United States	I have a income tax question?	How should I file complete taxes for my niece who is married but did not change her maiden name to her married name?  Her situation is so usual I do not know how to complete her taxes.  She married to a man who has two other children and he doesn't keep a job long enough to keep his child support payment up to date.  Last year his baby's mom receive the whole income tax check.  This year him and his wife have a child to claim.  I am afraid to file them as married filing joint because the same thing may happen again and she will not receive anything for her own child.  I really resent this man she is married to.  So, can I file them as single since she did not change her name?  I can not file her as head of household because there is another family who lives at the same address who is filing head of household.  I could file married filing separate and let her aunt claim their baby since they live at the same address, but then the same situation with her last name not being changed.  So, now what?

20090205130724AAqXeQ2	Business & Finance;Taxes;United States	I accidentally overstated my income on my federal tax return. What will happen?	Last year, I had 3 W2's and 1 1099 to report income. (I'm a writer.)       I got impatient and stupidly filed my federal turn before I got my last (and biggest) W2. I used the information from my last pay stub to input the info. I e-filed.       Problem is, I got the W2 in the mail a few days later and it is about $800 less than what I claimed on the return. I realized I was using the last pay stub from the year 2007.       Because of that, I got an EIC that was a couple of hundred dollars higher than I should have gotten. I have one child.       Anyway, the tax return is now being processed by the IRS. I don't mind paying back the couple hundred extra that will show up in my return if they overlook the discrepancy, but I am concerned it will result in an audit.       Does anyone know what will happen? Yeah yeah- I know I was stupid and this is my fault. I just want to fix it- and hopefully not get audited in the process. Someone help!

20090205135612AAd2Tv3	Business & Finance;Taxes;United States	Haven't Filed for Tax Returns Question?	Okay, here's the deal.      I have a history of being unemployed for long periods of time.  Or at least did. The past 2 years I haven't filed for tax returns because I barely made any money at all during those years.  I did try to file (online) but every time I did it, it apparently never worked because I never got any money back (what little money I would've gotten).  I used HRBlock online, btw.      Now, I've had a good job for the past year.  I want to know if I'll have any problems trying to file for a tax return this year because the 2 previous years have been messed up and they think I didn't file anything.      Also, I don't understand the point of all this.  How can I get in trouble for not filing taxes when THEY owe ME money?  I know THEY owe ME because I DID actually try to file my taxes the past 2 years and was going to get back a couple hundred dollars, but since it was such a small amount, I didn't really care when it didn't work.  So how exactly could I, if at all, get in trouble for not filing taxes the past 2 years?      It is all very confusing to me because my parents suck and don't bother or care to explain this crap to me.

20090205151724AADPqnU	Business & Finance;Credit	Can you file for undue hardship for credit card debt?	One of my very close friends has built a credit card debt of over 4,000. How this happened was she went manic, being she has Bi Polar Disorder, and Schizophrenia, and after racking up 4k in debt, hallucinations, and insanity, she was hospitalized for 4 months in a Mental Hospital. All of this is documented. She receives Supplemental Security Income which isn't Taxable so it cant be considered a asset or income at all. Its Government Money so at least they cant garnish her check. She used to live with her mother, now she lives in a Community Residence. She is Mentally Disabled. She doesn't possess the comprehension to understand credit card interest, she doesn't want to file bankrupt chapter 7 because she believes her credit score will be destroyed for the rest of her life no matter what anyone tells her. I tell her if your just paying the bare minimum payment, your not even touching the debt you owe, your basically paying the interest of your debt. If your debt is 4,000, and your paying 15 dollars a month, plus 15% interest every month, you will never get out of debt. She doesn't understand this. So I was wondering can you file for undue hardship for credit card debt?

Last week, The Today Show aired a segment talking about how people are allowing car and home insurance policies to expire.  This is troubling for several reasons as it places them and others at risk.  Of course, when it comes to car insurance, people are also breaking the law.  Some interesting activities are discussed.        If you missed the segment, here is the link, “Cutbacks you can’t afford to make:”  http://today.msnbc.msn.com/id/26184891/v...

I called them last August @ Member Connect Customer Service and spoke with a lady who assured me I could pay late and she would make a note about it. I had NEVER been late before. Well. I did and somehow the payment has been a month behind even though I have continued to make payments for my regular scheduled time and I though I was paying on time. Apparently I needed to make 2 payments to get caught up. I just found this out a few weeks back because I was going to refinance my house. Suprise!! The Credit Union had been reporting me month after month- 1 month late. My credit score was a 620! That low in a matter of a few months. I never recieved a late notice or anything. I pay the loan online through a transferr and never realised what was going on! Today I made 2 payments to get caught up. How long before my credit score goes back up? Will it go up as quickly as it was lowered??? Thanks!!!

Here is the scenario.    Suppose you are making a device that does Something. The entire prior patent art for this field consists of two issued patents that are still in effect:     001 has 3 claims:       1. A Device that does Something that is composed of Elements A, B and C.       2. The Device of Claim 1 that also has Element D       3. The Device of Claim 1 that also has Element E   002 has 2 claims:       1. A Device that does Something that is composed of Elements A, B and F       2. A Device that does Something that is composed of Elements A, C and F    Another person has invented a new device and submits a patent application with the following claims:       1. A Device that does Something that is composed of Elements A, B, C and G       2. A Device that does Something that is composed of Elements A, C, F and E    Q1. The examiner for this application allows claim 1 but rejects claim 2 as obvious in the light of the prior art.  What would be her basis for these decisions?      I think they allow claim one because there is an element that has not been invented and not claim two because it consists of all elements from both the claims.    Q2. The application is amended as the examiner demanded and issues as Patent  003.  You want to build and sell a product consisting of a Device to do Something that is composed of Elements A, B, C, G and H.  What, if any, licenses do you need to proceed without risk of infringement, and why?      I think you do need a patent in order to not risk infringement.    Q3. In the course of developing your product, you turn up an old journal article in which the authors describe a Device that does Something that is composed of Elements A, B, C and I.  Does this have any effect on your answer to Q2?     I thought you would need one but someone told me you wouldn't because of the journal article. I'm confused...    Q4. You decide you want to improve your product by adding Element E.  Does this have any effect on your answer to Q3?     I don't think it would have any effect.    Any help is greatly appreciated.

20090205122857AAaKjPQ	Business & Finance;Investing	Pay down mortgage or invest in Roth IRA?	I've got a few thousand dollars and I am trying to decide what I should do with it.  I want to be able to access the funds in the next few years if I need to, so a Roth IRA is attractive.   I have a home mortgage at 6.75% -- interest is tax-deductable because I live in the U.S.  If I put it in the mortage, I can always get it back out if I need to by using my line of credit (2nd mortgage) which is at only 4% right now.      Seems to me I should pay down my mortgage, because even after calculating the tax savings, my mortgage interest would be about 4%, and would I be able to find a Roth IRA investment that would return more than that per year over the next few years?

20090205134048AAUxda1	Business & Finance;Careers & Employment;Marketing & Sales	What jobs can my cousin do?	My cousin, Kaylen, is 11. She just turned 11 on January 21st, 2009. She is looking for employment. Her parents can't afford to give her money for an allowance, so that is out of the question. She doesn't prefer to work with animals, and she can't do a paper route becuase in her dangerous town the adults drive around in cars to deliver the paper, and she doesn't want to get an adult out of their job just so she can have money for make-up, a cell phone, spending money etc. She can't babysit or be a mommy's helper becuase people feel she isn't qualified just because she is young. She can't do a bake sale because she is allergic to most baked goods (anything with wheat, flour, milk, eggs, or nuts. Yeah.....). She can't tutor kids because she is not good in school to teach other kids. Finally, she can't do a lemenade stand outside because it is winter time and it is very snowy where she is right now. So how can she get a job that makes money? Thanks in advance.      P.S.- She doesn't have any relatives that own businesses, chains, or companies that she can work at. She doesn't even know anyone who owns a business. Also, she can't do work for neighbors because her neighborhood is dangerous and she doesn't know any neighbors on her street.

I was going to be put on the lease which was a six month, but was not able to show proof of income. So she gave me 3 days to vacate the apartment. upon doing so, she MAY have told the other roommates that she gave me 30 days notice. well there were looking for someone to occupy the room for next month..MARCH for that was when they were thinking  i was going to move out. When they found out i was moving out this month, they were mad. Saying how its my fault for not informing them i was not moving out this month, and not giving them a 30 notice so they could find someone to take my place. I still owe them $50 for utilities, but there holding my laptop as collateral, so i would pay them the 50. they also want half of this months rent for not notifying them 30 days in advance. Now are they able to hold my laptop for the $50 i still owe them for utilities or do i have to pay the 50 as well as half the rent even though i was never on the lease.? is it legal for what they did?  can they really hold it until i give them what they want.?

20070403202738AAoJgJJ	Business & Finance;Careers & Employment	I got accepted to UCD and UCSD. I'm having trouble deciding between the UC's for undergraduate school?	At davis i am in the Biotechnology major (looking at the classes I have to take, this is an awesome major) and at San diego I am doing microbiology. I am interested in using microorganisms (probably bacteria) in replenishing water (especially in dirty rivers) and soil. If I go to UCSD my brother says he can hook me up with a laboratory job with a couple of really cool and crazy smart scientists. But, UCD is closer to home and seems to be more fun. I think I prefer the college town (like UCD) but I might like to go out of my comfort zone so Im not exactly sure. Can you help me with my decision?

20090205143005AAu2YEe	Business & Finance;Personal Finance	T or F; The owners of the Fed. Reserve could have simply written off the paper debt. of troubled banks?	Which was nothing more than interest...not actual money from any services rendered. But because a select few powerful men refuse to relinquish the money that a piece of paper says they're owed...the Government had to create another 800 billion in taxpayer money to bail the banks and other finiancial institutions (who also borrow money from the Federal Reserve)...so in addition to the interest we already pay on a mortgage. (IE: 200K of the 300K you pay over 30 years is total interest, not real money) The owners of the Federal Reserve will recoup all of this money from our taxes as well. So then..was the stimulus money really necessary....could the debt just been forgiven? agree or no?    For those of you without a general understanding of the Federal reserve, there is a link for your convenience.    http://wiki.answers.com/Q/Who_controls_t...
