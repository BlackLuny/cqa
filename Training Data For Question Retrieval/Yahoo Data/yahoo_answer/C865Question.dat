20090203065414AAoFQsp	Business & Finance;Careers & Employment;Health Care	Will the nursing field become saturated with new graduate nurses in a few years? Iam going to go into nursing?	but now Im hesistant to. I always see articles and tv commercials saying how Nursing is where its at and how there is a nursing shortage because older nurses will be retiring. Im seeing on nursing forums how nurses are being laid off, and hospitals are cutting back to save money, and how a lot of new graduate nurses are having a hard time finding jobs. To me it seems as if there probably isnt a shortage. Are there any similar careers that are kind of like nursing? Or should I just stick with nursing? I dont want to graduate from nursing school in the next two years and not be able to find a job because there are too many nurses and not enough jobs.

20090203070917AAvh76Z	Business & Finance;Credit	How to improve my credit?	I am honestly freaking out right now. My score is about a 565, which is awful. Last year it was in the 400's, so it has gone up. Here's the situation. I am 23, and sometime in the near future I may want to buy a house or do something else important...      1.) I have about $18000.00 in student loans. I had them consolidated. I pay them five days early every month now. So it is about 17000 for one company and 1000 from another.      2.) I signed up for a credit card in college but I never used it and left it home. Found out my mom spent the limit and then didn't pay it. It was sent to a collections agency and was finally paid off two weeks ago. Now it was very wrong of my mother to do this I know, but she put most of my student loans in her name so I wouldn't have a huge debt.       3.) When the grace period has ended, the student loan company had sent the bills to the wrong address. So for three months, I wasn't even aware that it was due so of course it shows up as three months without payment even though I pay them on time now.      4.) I have no accounts open besides my student loans. No current credit cards, nothing. Just the student loans.      What can I do to help improve my credit? Right now I am only getting part time hours and I am hoping they will give me full time, but I don't know if that will happen. I thought about getting a credit card, but it's hard to do when your credit is already bad.        http://www.credit.com/products/credit_ca...       The first one listed here seems ok, do you think it is a wise idea?      Any suggestions on what to do? I don't want to rack up debt if I don't have the money to pay the bills, but I need to do something!

What are the chances of me getting a job in, about, oh, 10 years as a Computer Programmer? I'm only in grade 9 at the moment, and I have a dream to become a computer programmer, I already have all my grade 11 and 12 courses picked out for math, taking Computer Science Math (which covers Trig, Calculus, etc), and Calculus & Vectors, etc. I want to get my B.A. in Computer Science, then my Honors, then my Masters in Computer Science. How far do you think a Masters Degree in Computer Science will get you in 10 years? 5-6 years to earn a Masters, I want to go big or go home, I'm going to have more of a chance then the guy with just the 3-year B.A. Or heck, should I even go for a Doctorate? I have looked at the website of my local University, which to taking Computer Programming courses you need to have University Math, University English (Mandatory to every University course) and Calculus is strongly recommended (these are all high school courses), along with a minimum 75% average. Will I.T. jobs in 10 years time be looking for computer programmers? I know no one can predict the future, I'm just curious. Are I.T. businesses in such a need of computer programmers they don't care about Masters and just need people with B.A.'s?      Right now I'm at a 85% average taking all academic courses at my high school :)

I am very underpaid for what I do (the company sells dental implants and supplies) and I have no interest in pursuing a career in sales.        I took the job because it was full time with steady pay (I was temping before and my hours were being cut).

Here's the background:    - Daughter's account (Student account, I am secondary)    - My own account (Just me on account)     - Dad's account (I am secondary to assist w/ bills)         My irresponsible daughter has a student account, which has my name on it.  She is primary though.  She withdrew money from her account (a lot) and has left it at that.  They have been trying to contact my daughter, but never successful.  So she owes the bank loads of money.      I just went to the bank today to try to w/drawl money.  They put a freeze on it.      Oddly, they have taken allll of my Dad's savings too from his account.  I have access to my Dad's savings because I assist him w/ his bills.  But they have taken money from my Dad's account which has nothing to do w/ my account or my daughter's account.        Can the banks do this?  Im worried as my Dad is retired, lives on what he can.  But I just can't believe the bank would take money out of my Dad's savings.  Poor thing.  Is there anything I can do?  I won't be able to talk to somebody until Monday from the bank.  Three seperate accounts, two of them have nothing to do w/ my irrisponsible daughter's account.      Looking forward to hearing any advise.  Thanks.

I told her in advance that clerical skills was not my strong point, but she wanted to try me in the position anyway.  Now that it hasn't worked out she put me in another position but has become nasty and condescending saying stuff like. "Oh, I'll give you something easy to do, this shouldn't be too hard".

Included in the bankruptcy was my mortgage, that I did not re-affirm. Now three years later I have become one payment behind. The mortgage company wants me to sign an agreement to pay back the one month, I am more than happy to do this, but this won't re-affirm my mortgage will it?  Some tricky way to re-affirm? Anyone had this happen? Also, I have recently learned they are reporting the late payment on my credit file, can they do this? Since it was a bankrupt account with no re-affirmation how can they report anything other than "included in bankruptcy"?

20070928085000AA4gtI5	Business & Finance;Renting & Real Estate	Bank costs incurred while holding an REO?	I’m trying to get a concept how the REO process works.      I understand that when a bank initially takes on an REO, the incur these expenses: the loan balance on the property, accrued interest on the property, attorney’s fees, and all other costs associated with the foreclosure process.  And of course when they sell, they have to pay out agent commissions.        So does the bank incur any additional costs over the above while holding the property other than the mortgage payments they aren’t getting?  I’m guessing they’ll have to pay property taxes, but are there other costs?       Additionally, do you think a bank would be more receptive to a loss on a house if the sale occurred at the start of their fiscal year vs. the end?

At the same time, he is pushing the other two accountants to manager as well... However, the job which we are doing now will be the same... I feel very unconformtable about this... is it really a promotion? To me, it looks like a demotion rather than a promotion. I feel very demoralised as compare the amout of hard work and effort which i have put in... i really dun think my boss can justify my colleague promotion. And now, for the sake of restructuring, he is promoting my colleagues yet they are doing something which i did when i was an accountant. I really feel unconformtable about it.. should i voice out my anger? or just accept the fact..

I've got the application filled out and ready. I'm gonna go in and ask for the manager, and hand him the application. How should I do this?      What I was thinking:   I go in, see the manager.   I introduce myself, give him a firm handshake while looking him in the eyes. Then I tell him I'm looking for employment here and then hand him the application.      Is this good? What more should I do? Should I tell him anything else??      Please help. Thanks!

If you have, how was your experience with them?

She did, and this person just told her to fill out the form on that website and that then he or she would call her to get her settled. She didn't fill the form out, she wants to know more information about this company first. And if it is for real or just someone trying to get people's information.

I was paying in monthly instalments here but that is more than I will be able to afford once I go. Would be able to get away with not paying the rest back?

We have paid our rent on time every month and she has failed to fix anything that has broken in the house. It says on the lease that she would do repairs, but we went for a month and a half without a water heater because she wouldnt fix it, and eventually we had to pay 200 to refill the propane tank and another 200 to fill it again a week later because there was a leak. The heating and AC unit have been broken since we moved in. I have an 18 month old son and I had to boil water on the stove in several pots and then wait for it to cool just so I could give him a warm bath in the middle of winter. We paid a deposit and we told her that we were going to move out in two weeks because my husbands finished his job and now he's going to start a new one somewhere else. We asked her to take the half a month's rent out of the deposit and she said that she already spent the money and she wants us out of the house in 72 hours. Can she kick us out that fast? Its not an eviction because I think she has to go through the courts for that. Should we just pay the half a months rent? She wont answer any of our phone calls... So Im not sure what to do. The place we're moving to is 4 hours away and our move in date was the 15th and I'm not sure that the current resident is out yet. Help!

20090220165523AAYGCrH	Business & Finance;Renting & Real Estate	Rightful Eviction Case?	Ill make this as short and detailed as possible. This is a serious case though, so please no sarcasm, jokes, etc. Ok, so my husband and I live in Ft Drum being that he is in the army and we are forced to live here (unfortunately). When we moved here we lived in Gouverneur and signed a lease w/ a military clause (that lacks some details and I found some loop holes through it) and we hated living so far from base but we dealt with it. Then one of his NCO's told him his unit would give him (fake) orders so that we could move on base given the military clause we signed in the lease. We thought it was weird, but its his NCO so we went with it. We applied for on base housing and now have moved on base. The NCO never followed through with the Deployment Papers (of course) and now two of his Sgt's are involved and realize its not our fault that we had to break the lease, since we never planned on breaking the lease until we were told we would get the papers from his NCO. Now, the army is involved and further complicating things, of course, and never gives us an answer and our landlord is bipolar/insane so you cant even talk to him about anything if its not an attorney or his Sgts.       Now we are being sued for eviction, but we never had proper notice. They gave us the notice for cure the day after they had already applied for the court eviction. The notice for cure was given to us on Feb. 12th, and they said if we dont have a decision by Feb. 13th they would begin the Eviction Process on Mon. Feb 16th. However, the court papers were dated as Feb 12th, which means we didnt have proper notice. Not only that, the eviction papers were not sent to us at all.. They were sent to my husbands SGT through EMAIL (not by officer/summons) The SGT never told us he received our eviction papers THROUGH EMAIL (illegal to send thru email, even more illegal the landlord/owner didnt send us our confidential documents)       Also, the Sgt told us the landlord was willing to break the lease and just let it go, thats why we waited so long because were just waiting for the finalized papers and now we find out were being sued out of nowhere.       What should I do, what are my chances of winning the case?       Plus we have CRAZY financial problems because I (the wife) cant find a job because Ft Drum just happens to be in the middle of nowhere, NY.      Any help would be fantastic. 10 points x 100000
20090220165745AAqGi9u	Business & Finance;Renting & Real Estate	Questions for first time home buyer.?	I had a few things I wanted to see if anyone could help Me with. I've been trying to build My credit for the last couple years. Finally got My credit score up to 731. When I was 18 and first got a checking account I screwed up, and bounced a couple checks. I thought My bank took care of them, but I guess I was wrong. So I ordered a chexsystems report. I have 2 checks in there. They'll go off of there in 1 more year. I was wondering if that would affect Me getting a home loan? Also between My wife, and I We make about 1,200-1,400 a month income. Were looking at buying around a 40,000 dollar house. We own both of our cars, and have 0 credit card debt. Is there anything that might effect Me getting approved for the loan? I wanna take care of everything before hand so I'll get the loan. Any help would be great.      p.s. the only real thing I'm worried about is the chexsystems. Will that affect the loan process? How do You pay off the checks when there in the chexsystem? Thats all very confusing.

I bought an item on Feb. 13, 2009 and they shipped the item on the Feb. 17, 2009. They used USPS Priority shipping and I have been waiting for my package for 3 days so far. The most ironic thing about this whole problem is that they shipped the package one city away from mines! Usually, I would get my packages from them in about 1 day or so. Not 2 days, but only 1 day! Do you think I would be getting it tmrw or Monday? Is there a complaint phone number to USPS?
