UF8qU5cGaa	Not far fetched at all. <br>  <br>  We're already united under the banner of the European Union. It will probably only be a matter of time before we're united under a federal government (75-100 years).<br>  <br>  Everything began with the Treaty of Rome, in 1957, which set the objective for Europe of creating a "common market" to increase economic prosperity and contribute towards "an ever closer union among the peoples of Europe".<br>  <br>  The common European currency was raised as a issue immediately after WWII. But the idea has existed in Europe for hundreds of years! Great empires require working currencies. From the Romans to Napoleon.<br>  <br>  In 1861 Jose Luis Cardoso wrote A Proposal for a "European Currency". And that's just a recent proposal.<br>  <br>  The Euro was introduced in 1999, a decade ago now. And it was preceded by the ECU (European Currency Unit). The ECU was conceived on 13 March 1979 as an internal accounting unit. It was sparingly used, but it was known to the public. Businesses could pay their taxes in it.<br>  <br>  In other words, it was just a matter of time before the Euro emerged. I doubt people would have laughed that hard.<br>  <br>  As for the idea of a united Europe, it's certainly opposed at the moment. That won't stop it from happening, and I'm living in a country strongly opposed to the EU (Norway).|`|8hGfivoDaa	We will soon all be united, one nation under Monsanto when they own the patents to the human genome and charge us to make babies.
dl1yuCoFaa	In French, Mardi Gras means "Fat Tuesday" and is celebrated the day<br>  before Ash Wednesday as a last "fling" prior to the 40 days of Lent<br>  which precede Easter. Lent is a word that comes from the Middle English word "lente" which means "springtime" - so named for the season of the year in which it usually occurs. While the practice of Lent is not mentioned in the Bible, it has been a tradition in the Christian world since the mid 4th century. It seems to parallel the 40 days of fasting in the wilderness that Jesus experienced following his baptism.<br>  <br>  Historically, Lenten fasting became mandatory, especially abstinence<br>  from eating meat. While recommended by St. Athanasius, bishop of<br>  Alexandria in 330 AD, by the Middle Ages Lent was enforced throughout Europe, especially the forbidding of meat during the final weeks before Easter. <br>  <br>  The word "carnival" comes from an old Italian word that means to "go without meat" or "removal of meat." Festivals like Mardi Gras sprang up throughout parts of Europe as a means to prepare for the coming times of self-denial. The three days before Ash Wednesday is also known as "Shrovetide," where shrove is an Old English word meaning "to repent." In England, the Tuesday just before Ash Wednesday is called Shrove Tuesday and is celebrated by eating of rich food, that won't be used during Lent.<br>  <br>  As the Protestant Reformation spread throughout Europe, Lent became regarded more as a Roman Catholic institution, and was increasingly ignored by Protestants as a traditional observance. This tendency did not reverse, especially in the US, until the 1980s. Today, more Protestant churches participate in Lent with devotions and Scripture readings, as well as special Ash Wednesday services.<br>  <br>  People celebrate Mardi Gras in numerous ways: Parades, parties, balls, excessive drinking and eating, and just having fun on the last day before Lent begins.|`|6874b4a9b2e07ebd35f4e979f869b2d4aa	Mardi Gras, or Fat Tuesday is the day before Ash Wednesday. People in different areas celebrate it in different ways. In New Orleans and Rio they have a big party with floats, parades and general Bacchanalia. In Venice Italy they have a big costume party. The whole idea is that the day after you spend Lent in a contemplative state and give up the hedonistic way of living so you had better enjoy yourself for one night.|`|Lngb8ryFaa	why are people TD'ing the above answers??   ok, how about this for answer:: people get completely hammered, girls flash their ti** for beads, people throw beads to partyers up in the balconies and everyone yells "SHOW YOUR TIT*!!!!!!!!"|`|dQHwWyp2aa	Mardi Gras is otherwise known as Fat Tuesday. On Fat Tuesday, (Mardi Gras) you give up something (something that u do or eat a lot) for Lent for 40 days until Easter. ex: say u give up cake u would eat that all throughout Fat Tuesday.  <br>  <br>  In New Orleans people celebrate Mardi Gras by dressing up in costumes in the colors of Mardi Gras which are Gold which symbolizes power, Purple which symbolizes justice, and green which symbolizes faith. People also dance, hold parades with floats.|`|WvRlWLzJaa	Well I should Know because, I am from New Orleans<br>  Mardi Gras is really called Fat Tuesday we have parades on different streets, then we have second lines that runs through Canal Street to Bourbon street.

I agree with the 1st answerer, you'd be better off with a college education.  <br>  In any case, you can live in North Jersey, where the cost of living is much lower.   I mean, when you say you want to "stay in the city", do you mean Manhattan??  Or the 5 boroughs???    If you meant Manhattan, it could be tough because rents are really high - it gets cheaper if you go way uptown, though.   If you meant the 5 boroughs, then you best bet would be somewhere in Queens.  <br>  Good luck.

AA10067514	Just a google search away:<br>  <br>  Missions of California (1769-1834)<br>  The Franciscans came to California to convert native tribes to Christianity and prepare them for life in a Spanish society. The natives were taught religion and the Spanish language. They were also taught skills such as brick making and construction, how to raise cattle and horses, and weaving.<br>  <br>  The natives would live in the missions until their education was complete. They would then establish homes outside of the missions. Once the native in one region were educated and converted to Christianity, the missionaries would move on to new locations. The old missions would be left as parish churches. In the new location, the missionaries would begin the conversion process once again with a new group of natives.<br>  <br>  The missions prospered. By 1804, the occupation of the sea-coast line from San Francisco to San Diego was complete. There were nineteen missions within a day's journey of each other. Construction started on a second row of missions more inland. The missions created a considerable wealth and economy with agriculture and large numbers of livestock.<br>  <br>  While many people benefited from the missions, many more wanted that prosperity for themselves. Traders, settlers and explorers saw the wealth and began to exploit the missions. There was constant pressure for the mission economy to be taken over by the Californians. In 1813, regulations from Mexico and California were issued to disbanded the missions. They were to be turned over to civilian authorities. This process of "secularization" became the end of the missions.|`|0jhzFOV8aa	Are you doing your California missions project for school?

BAlntsndaa	You need an emergency fund that you can keep quiet about and not touch. You need confidence and a smile because you won't know anyone besides your boyfriend. You need to make and keep back-up copies of all your important ID and diploma. Make a phone list on paper, don't depend on keeping numbers just on your phone. Get a list of references you can use when job hunting. Go online and learn more about the area you are moving to. More cash other than your emergency fund because you will need it to get around and not be completely dependent on someone else.

ndX8I6qCaa	I dont know about north, but in utica illinois, a little over an hour south west of Chicago there is a place called Grand Bear Lodge.  It does not have a lake, but it it right off of a river, and right by Starved Rock, which is amazing.  There are also several other creeks, rivers, and canyons close by.  Starved rock is beautiful and great for the family.  It is a buch of trails, cliffs, and canyons, and they also have a lodge, and a bunch of cabins.  I only suggest to stay in the cabins at grand bear by starved rock (instead of staved rock), because they have an indoor water park, and other fun activities.  <br>  <br>  I am not sure what exactly you are looking for, but starved rock, and grand bear both have quite a bit to offer, if you want to get away from the city.  Utica is a small town prolly not even 1000 pop. with a bunch of antique shops, and a couple bars and restraunts, it is very cute.  Close by to the west is Peru which has a small mall and restraunts like applebees,etc.  or the the east is Ottawa with a Cracker Barrel etc.  There a million things to do in this area (I&M canal for bike riding, or walking, starved rock or buffalo rock for hiking and picnics, the Illinois river and the Fox river meet in Ottawa, and the Vermillion River runs by Utica, and so does the Illinois.)  <br>  <br>  You should look this up if your interested, its right off of I80 W.  Sorry I dont know anything north.  hope this helps.<br>  <br>  Good luck and God bless.|`|zLXmOXkBaa	Try the Wisconsin Dells.

ben0NvDDaa	I generally exchange my money when I get off the plane.  There are usually plenty of opportunies at the airport, whether it be an on-site money exchange or an ATM machine.<br>  <br>  When I tried to get money from my bank early for a trip, I was told that they can order foreign money but it takes at least 2 weeks and there is a $20.00 processing fee.  That pretty much lead to my decision to wait until I get in-country to exchange money.<br>  <br>  You are in NY right?  Maybe check with the airport there to see if they have an on-site money exchange.  I bet they have people exchanging pounds for dollars, maybe you can take some of the pounds off their hands.|`|dDDAbqqhaa	go to a cash bureau (sp) for cash money<br>  <br>  or you can change it in London, ask your bank if your ATM card will be able to withdraw other currency when abroad<br>  <br>  enjoy your stay here in England|`|fkHBVn7taa	well first off where are you located?  In most cases London will have currency conversion Bureaux de Change  is in every terminal so if you wait till you get to London you can just do it there.  I have provided the link for the hours and where in the terminals these currency conversion places are.|`|3UB7mSNwaa	There is absolutely no reason to get pounds here in the US when you get off the plane at the airport use an atm machine and get the pounds there.  You are going to pay an exchange fee whether you get some pounds here or in England.  Why stress out you wont need any pounds until you are outside the airport anyways.|`|onySROuhaa	Go to the bank and they still may be able to do it for you if its a big enough bank that keeps foreign currency on hand.  Or you can do it at the airport.  Either way you are going to get a horrible exchange rate.|`|OVBGhcSDaa	go to the bank!
CZYXO1NFaa	The easiest and most convenient place to exchange money is at the airport. Either in London or at your airport of departure they will have a money exchange location where you can purchase Pounds with your Dollars.<br>  <br>  Once you are in London, using your ATM card will be the best idea, the exchange rate at ATMs is much better than the money exchange stations.<br>  <br>  When I go over I normal just take some Dollars as back up or to use at the airport and as soon as I arrive at the airport I hit the ATM machine for $100-$150 worth of Pounds. Then once I get to the hotel or in town I will go to a local bank's ATM to get whatever else I need.<br>  <br>  Hope this helps, have a good trip.|`|IKCxj9gHaa	there should be exchange kiosks at the airport, other than that if you have time tomorrow, your bank should be able to find such a small amount of pounds, you can also change them over in the uk when you arrive at the uk airport, and if you need to pay for anything on the flight they will certainly take dollars, and yes HSBC branchs are everywhere in london, if it is a visa type debit card (not visa credit card) then you should be able to use it in any hole in the wall
PGKFzElxaa	LOTS of money. Some must<br>  Breakfast at Shutters on the Beach<br>  Lunch at the Ivy - start with the Crab salad and order the Fried Chicken<br>  Cocktails at the 4 seasons beverly hills or the Peninsula<br>  Bike Santa Monica beach bike path<br>  Ride the rides on the pier<br>  eat at In n out burger<br>  Go to Skye Bar and have a Mojito<br>  Breakfast at the beverly hills hotel. There is a small little counter restaurant downstairs.<br>  The Getty Museum<br>  Hike Laurel Canyon<br>  Walk through Marina del Rey<br>  Hollywood walk of Fame<br>  If you get a chance go out and visit Pasadena - gorgeous flowers<br>  La Brea tar pits<br>  Venice Boardwalk. <br>  <br>  There are so many great things to do in LA depending on your budget. Lots of good restaurants. You can find great entertainment in  just people watching. I remember one time when my brother visited - he just wanted to stand on Rodeo drive and watch all the cars go by. <br>  <br>  That is just a small list of things I miss about living in LA. Have a fun safe trip|`|ac7e0f50f58632b431b5cf5de0564ffbaa	There are literally hundreds of things to do here in LA. Here is my list of “must sees”. Visit as many as you have time for.:<br>  <br>  Disneyland: The Happiest Place on Earth. Half a billion visitors can’t be wrong. #1 Destination in SoCal.<br>  Universal Studios: A theme park that grew out of a studio tour. #2 Destination<br>  Even if you don’t visit Disneyland or Universal Studios Tour, Downtown Disney District and Universal City Walk are very fun places to visit for shopping and eating. And they’re free to visit. <br>  <br>  Hollywood: Enjoy the Walk of Fame, Entertainment Museum, Chinese Theater and more. You can see a lot for free. The Hollywood & Highland complex is AMAZING. It has lots of shops and restaurants, and the Kodak Theater (home of the Academy Awards). I also like the El Capitan theater, right across the street. And the Hollywood Bowl is a GREAT place to listen to concerts outdoors. <br>  <br>  Rodeo Drive, 90210: Packed with exclusive shops, full of gawkers. They all came to enjoy the excess. Free, unless you intend to buy something.<br>  <br>  Venice Beach: Los Angeles kitsch and over-the-top culture at its best. Here you'll find Muscle Beach, street performers and tacky shops galore. Fun, VERY interesting, but I avoid it after dark, when it gets a little TOO interesting for my taste. <br>  <br>  Santa Monica Beach and Pier: Great beach scene and a classic seaside amusement park, complete with antique carousel that has been in a lot of TV and movies. <br>  <br>  Santa Monica Third Street Promenade - Downtown Santa Monica's shopping promenade is often the scene of movie star-sightings. <br>  <br>  Sunset Boulevard: Perhaps one of the world's most famous streets, it began as a route between the stars' posh neighborhoods and the Hollywood studios. It runs from downtown to the ocean, passing through the "Sunset Strip" on its way. It makes for a fun drive. When you get to the ocean, stop at Gladstone's for Fish.<br>  <br>  Queen Mary: Once the largest ship afloat, she's been docked in Long Beach for longer than she sailed, and her elegance never fails to impress. Free to visit. You can actually stay on board, for a price.<br>  <br>  Farmers Market and The Grove - A new shopping complex right next to a Los Angeles landmark, The Grove and Farmers Market coexist. Enjoy a movie or shopping, and then take the trolley to the Farmers Market for lunch or dinner. It is right next to CBS, so walk across the lot to see if they are taping "The Price is Right". You might even get in.<br>  <br>  TAAB: The Americana at Brand- The newly opened TAAB, developed by the same group that gave us The Grove, breathes new life into Glendale, and gives all those hip people in Eagle Rock and the eastern half of LA a great place to go. <br>  <br>  Griffith Park - Home of the Los Angeles Zoo, Griffith Park Observatory, Travel Town, the Greek Theatre, and Gene Autry Museum of Western Heritage.<br>  <br>  Getty Museum - The Getty's architecture is so beautiful that it keeps me fascinated. No matter whether you like their art or architecture better (or maybe you'll just enjoy the view), the Getty is sure to please. Free.<br>  <br>  Attend a TV taping - You can get free tickets at audiencesunlimited.com, tvtix.com, or see the booth at Universal City walk. It's very interesting to see a show being taped. The most popular, by far, is the Tonight show with Jay Leno. Check the NBC web site for all the details there.<br>  <br>  Places to eat:<br>  In-N-Out Burger: Multiple locations, best burger in LA, ask anyone.<br>  Pink’s Hot Dogs: 709 N. La Brea, just north of Melrose. You might even see a celebrity. Maybe.<br>  Tommy’s Chili Burgers: Look for the shack, an LA tradition. The original location is at Beverly & Rampart, a couple miles west of downtown.<br>  Canter’s Deli: 419 N. Fairfax, between Beverly & Melrose. Near CBS, you might spot a celebrity.<br>  Phillippe’s: 1001 N. Alameda. Great roast beef sandwiches. Near Union Station and Olvera Street. Watch the mustard, it’s hot.<br>  The Pantry: Corner of Figueroa and 9th, downtown. Huge portions, they never close, GREAT steak and eggs.<br>  <br>  Places to Stay:<br>  Since LA is so spread out, there is no single place that is close to EVERYTHING. Most people who come here tend to stay in Hollywood, Santa Monica, or Anaheim.<br>  In Hollywood, I recommend the Renaissance Hotel at Hollywood and Highland, the Best Western Sunset Plaza, or the Holiday Inn Walk of Fame. <br>  In Santa Monica, the Holiday Inn Santa Monica is close to the pier and reasonably priced.<br>  In Anaheim, I recommend the Howard Johnson (HoJo) Anaheim, and the Candy Cane Inn.<br>  <br>  Places to Shop:<br>  Third Street Promenade, Santa Monica<br>  The Grove, Los Angeles<br>  Americana @ Brand, Glendale<br>  Beverly Center, Los Angeles<br>  Citadel Outlets, Commerce<br>  Brea Mall, Brea<br>  The Block at Orange, Orange<br>  South Coast Plaza, Costa Mesa<br>  Fashion Island, Newport Beach<br>  Santee Alley, Los Angeles|`|kgCHQQshaa	Depends on what you plan on doing and where you're going. You should go to CityWalk. It's really nice and there's a bunch of places to eat. Uhm, definitely go to the Santa Monica pier. It's a nice place to hang out in the afternoon on the weekends.
fkHBVn7taa	Try kayak.com or cheapoair.com  <-- if you use "BER" for the airport code for Berlin it will search all the airports in Berlin and sometimes there are cheaper flights to SXF rather than TXL. <br>  <br>  Here is what I found 1050 or 1100 is about average in the US unless you are on the east coast it could be quite cheaper. Delta seems to be the cheapest with a direct out of JFK to TXL.   <- very nice routing.|`|fZSJfirlaa	Around 1,200 dollars from Lufthansa Airlines<br>  <br>  it can get up to 4193.90 Usd|`|n3n9agozaa	my friend i got my ticket last  month from <br>  <a href="http://www.expedia.com/default.asp" rel="nofollow">http://www.expedia.com/default.asp</a> <br>  <br>  from salt lake city to Frankfurt for about $587
6pIsnI0Saa	you should go on Royal Caribbean Cruises but many cruises are not that fun for younger people just remember your stuck on this ship with limited things to do but at least the fun part is you get to see a few caribbean islands in the process !|`|YKighFq7aa	I would choose NCL, because it is a nice cruise line. The staff is very very friendly and they always make sure that you are pleased. They have nightly events, and they have about 6 restaruatns, and a buffet. Everything else about it is nice too, but its too much to type. lol|`|hGEZ0b4Zaa	Royal Caribbean or Carnival is a great choice!<br>  <br>  Carnival is cheaper and has a lot of fun things to do on it. If you are on a low budget I recomend this one.<br>  <br>  Royal Caribbean is more expensive but It has more things to do for your age group. It is really fun and I recomend this one more if you have more money.<br>  <br>  Have fun =)|`|hPdEZ4Ypaa	That depends on what you want. No cruise line is bad, however they vary as far as activites and style. RCCL and Carnival would be the best choices for younger ppl. Disney is more expensive and has tons of little kids, Celebrety and Holland America are more elegant, but I'm told that half the guests have those damn scooter chairs and the lines move slower than molassis in January. We have been with Carnival 4 times and Princess once. We definately vote for Carnival.|`|093c633e155de952249b95398f169e87aa	for all my cruise information and bookings i use www.vacationstogo.com i find there website very good to find information and great prices, especially last minute deals. also i find their experienced staff very helpful when i call them

AjEftvtaaa	Ignore the first answer, he is talking crap, Thomas Cook have an Airbus A330 based at Glasgow and many other airlines use this aircraft to Glasgow too. <br>  <br>  From Glasgow, Thomas Cook use the Airbus A330 on the following routes:<br>  Calgary, Canada<br>  Cancun, Mexico<br>  Cayo Coco, Cuba<br>  Las Vegas, United States<br>  Orlando, United States<br>  Puerto Plata, Dominican Republic<br>  Vancouver, Canada<br>  <br>  ________________<br>  <br>  Like I have said before, if people dont know the facts then dont answer. I am directing this to the first answer, who said you will need to go to Heathrow. To that person, good luck getting a TCX flight from LHR, we dont fly from London Heathrow ;-)|`|fkHBVn7taa	Your question is pretty hard -- to answer because this is not really a FIXED airline, they change they're schedule quite a bit.  I dont think Thomas Cook has many flights in and out of GLA.   Pick a long destination popular for the bigger aircraft.  <br>  <br>  Call here 0871 895 0065 for more info <br>  <br>  Glassgo to Vancouver would most likely be a A330|`|ZH91TAHPaa	By A330 do you mean the type of airplane? if so, did you mean the Airbus A380? The really big one?<br>  <br>  If that is what you mean, it is very unlikely you will get one from Glasgow. You have more chance getting one from Heathrow, and you would need to fly to somewhere like Japan or New York to get one!
0ed3a47409dac89fe63086d50549f520aa	A fairly large percentage of the population originally comes from foreign origins, so they hold no common characteristics.<br>  <br>  If you mean traditionally, it can vary a lot depending on the part of Scandinavia.. not just the country, but areas within the country. Populated areas in Norway, for example, were very isolated due to natural barriers (like mountains) so people from one area can look very distinct from another. I can tell you what a stereotypical Scandinavian looks like, but it's not a good representation of the general population. <br>  <br>  While there are more blondes in Nordic countries than elsewhere, especially in the center of Finland and Sweden, there are also many natural brunettes. Most people have medium blonde to brown hair, and light eyes. There is a wider range among Sami and their descendants, who sometimes have dark hair and eyes.<br>  <br>  Annika Norlin <a href="http://www.sr.se/press/bilder/P1Sommar2008/images/Annika_Norlin_2885.JPG" rel="nofollow">http://www.sr.se/press/bilder/P1Sommar20...</a><br>  Frida ?hrn <a href="http://svt.se/content/1/c6/85/47/57/ohlaura_info.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://svt.se/content/1/c6/85/47/57/ohla...</a><br>  Mari Boine <a href="http://www.schamanenkongress.de/bilder/MariBoine_web.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://www.schamanenkongress.de/bilder/M...</a><br>  Maria Mena <a href="http://media.livenation.co.uk/web_apps/publishing/agency/content/images/artist/8/Maria-Mena-opt.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://media.livenation.co.uk/web_apps/p...</a><br>  Bertine Zetlitz <a href="http://pub.tv2.no/multimedia/na/archive/00527/bertine_zetlitz_527331g.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://pub.tv2.no/multimedia/na/archive/...</a><br>  Neneh Cherry <a href="http://www.virgin17.fr/var/virgin/storage/images/media/illustrations/neneh-cherry/89810-1-fre-FR/Neneh-Cherry_large.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://www.virgin17.fr/var/virgin/storag...</a><br>  Tina Dico <a href="http://farm1.static.flickr.com/55/114516821_3eb61d5daf.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://farm1.static.flickr.com/55/114516...</a><br>  Anna J?rvinen <a href="http://illustrations.citykollen.se/repo/anna-jarvinen.resource?site=dyngan&id=3964&filter=width&width=400" rel="nofollow">http://illustrations.citykollen.se/repo/...</a><br>  <br>  As you can see, there's a lot of variation just using a few random Scandinavians from my current mp3 playlist.

For breakfast/lunch, both the Wilderness Lodge and the Grand Floridian do a character brunch. If you're looking for a fancy date night, then check out the restaurant on the top floor of the Grand Floridian (can't think of the name off the top of my head, sorry!). There are also casual cafes in each of the resorts and pool bars/snacks. And, in Epcot, many of the countries have both a cafe-style restaurant and a sit-down restaurant serving the "local" fare.|`|PTovC2Dqaa	Definitely make reservations for the Rain Forest Cafe at Downtown Disney. Every one loves this restaurant and there is always a giant line of people waiting to be seated. Reservations is a good idea when it comes to eating here.<br>  <br>  The Rain Forest Cafe is a beautiful restaurant with the theme of animals from the rain forest. They have the most delicious food and drinks over there and they also have a giant gift-shop almost the size of the restaurant its self. <br>  <br>  Here's more information on the Rain Forest Cafe (Downtown Disney):<br>  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rainforest_Cafe" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rainforest_...</a>|`|21eb1fee7277ed0dfc6c417c0a528dddaa	Well the only place I made reservations for when I went in December were, Chef's Mickey in Contemporary Resort for breakfast; we were staying there. Liberty Tree Tavern for dinner in the Magic Kingdom. Lastly Sci-fi Diner in the movie studio park. Only one I would recommend is the Chef's Mickey place. I had looked up the tree tavern online before booking it. Turns out they do this monster plate thing, waitress said "family style" eating for dinner. So you can't order what you want to eat. There were only two of us, way to much food, and we left and went somewhere else.<br>  <br>  I didn't like what I had at the Sci-fi diner. Its a nice setting and everything. Movie screen showing old cartooons, and old trailers. My son liked what he had to eat, but I will not go back there again. <br>  <br>  Go to the disney website, and browse their list of restaurants. I know when we go back I am going the rainforest cafe there. Been to the one in Anaheim and I liked that place.|`|3ILRBXlRaa	Blue Zoo is pretty good.  That's located at the Swan and the Dolphin.<br>  <br>  The English Restaurant at the World Showcase is also good and it is to date the best dinner I've had at the World Showcase and I've been  to Germany, Mexico, China.  <br>  <br>  Actually the last time I went to Disney was last month.|`|9NSfJChaaa	We love the restaurant at the Wilderness Lodge.  Another favorite of ours is Trail's End at Fort Wilderness.  You don't need a reservation there as it is a buffet.  The food is good and the prices are great.  Both of these destinations are easiest reached from the Magic Kingdom via a short (15 mins or so) ferry ride.|`|0vcgmsHEaa	I highly reccomend the German Pavillion in Epcot! They have a huge buffet with really tastey food like dumplings! Also, they always have authentic German entertainers performing on stage! The atmosphere of the place really is wonderful! :)|`|9NpXU7D2aa	you're right its more about the atmosphere of the restaurant when eating at disney world but i can assure you the food is fantastic too. <br>  <br>  my favorite places are:<br>  magic kingdom:<br>  -cinderella's royal table in cinderella's castle (requires 2 table services per person)<br>  -crystal palace<br>  -liberty tree tavern<br>  epcot:<br>  -garden grill<br>  -san angel inn<br>  -bistro de paris<br>  hollywood studios:<br>  -sci-fi drive in theater (personally i think it is one of the best atmospheres in all of disney world. you sit in a 1950's style car and watch old sciience fiction trailers while you eat. they are funny.)<br>  -50's prime time cafe<br>  animal kingdom:<br>  -rainforest cafe<br>  downtown disney:<br>  -cap'n jack's<br>  disney hotels:<br>  -chef mickey's at the contemporary resort<br>  believe me there's alot more great restaurants to choose from. those are just my faves :)<br>  <br>  have a great time!|`|5LxpvXSmaa	i loved Narcoose's! It is at the Grand Floridian resort! it is on the water and just overall great atmosphere and great food.

AA12225622	Since we seem to be getting a lot of late winter storms this year there should be plenty of it.  Just last week some places received over 6 feet.  <br>  <br>  My only concern is that the storm that is coming in this week end is supposed to be warm and that could melt a lot of the snow on the ground.<br>  <br>  But yes there will still be snow in April.  Boreal usually tries to stay open until Memorial Day anyway.  I have seen years were they will reopen for the Fourth of July.|`|pTLcvsVfaa	Yes. There will still be plenty of snow up there. The actual village of Tahoe might not have alot of snow, but the mountains will still be covered.|`|Lngb8ryFaa	you're actually cutting it reaaly close...i went in mid april about 2 years ago and they closed the following week...there will be snow but it will turn very slushy by the end of the day--i was ankle deep in wet heavy slush, the trail count will not be 100% open by then, ..on a positive note, the sun is bright, it is very mild out and you can ski in a tank top!!!--just dont expect peak season powder conditions..|`|AA12339318	Probably, very likely, yes.  There should be snow to see and even some to ski and snowboard on.<br>  <br>  But we are in several years of drought conditions, so, it would be hard to PROMISE snow in April.  The mountain tops will surely have white caps for beartiful views, but how deep it will be, and how far down it will extend will be hard to predict.<br>  <br>  In a good year, there could be skiing conditions in May and June.  But probably not this year.

v6vDqm4Xaa	I think if you can spare the cash, and you think your mom will get a job soon, I think you should go. But, if this trip will cause you and your family financial hardship in the future, I think you should put it off until next year. Hopefully, with the stimulus plan you will get a bigger tax return. (I'm a poor college kid too.) But honestly, I don't know about your financial situation- only you do. I think you should sit down with your mom and discuss it- there is always next year, because for EF College Break, you can book a year in advance for the same price. I actually got a job working for EF College Break, and I can get you $50 off any trip with the discount code West2009- but contact me, and I can get you a bigger discount, because I understand  money is an issue. I really don't usually give away bigger discounts, so please contact me if you want it. I really hope you are able to go because it is such a great experience, but at the same time I understand right now might not be the best time. Good luck!|`|94b8KImYaa	Well, if your economical situation is difficult, calculate how long you can live off four thousand dollars at home and how that compares to one month in Europe. <br>  <br>  Hope this helps|`|onySROuhaa	I would say that if you can afford it and afford to miss the time from work then go for it!

AA11044780	I show the distance as being about 380 miles.  I believe that on average, the wagon would likely travel in the neighborhood of 3 miles an hour.  Bearing in mind that you would be on dirt roads at best, at worst, you could be making your way through fields and such.  So, at that pace, you'd cover about 45 miles a day, if it was summer time and you were willing and able to keep that pace up for 15 hours per day.  At that pace,it would take about 8 and a half days to get there.|`|URO3gDXcaa	i don't think anyone here was alive then.
CZYXO1NFaa	Personally I think the best way to get from Munich to Venice is by train. It is quick fast and easy.<br>  <br>  The entire trip will take around 7 hours unless you are taking the night train which is 11 hours. The night trains are a bit more expensive, but are a good value in that they save you a lot in terms of time.<br>  <br>  Driving time is estimated at around 5 1/2 hours, but any number of factors could make that more difficult. All in all is not a difficult drive, but driving in Italy can be a bit of a nightmare in my opinion.<br>  <br>  In reality, Munich and Venice are not that far from each other, and are two cities that are a BLAST to visit. I don't know the nature of your trip but, I would recommend seeing Venice and Munich to friends that were heading out to Europe.<br>  <br>  Crossing through the borders is a breeze! Once you are in the EU going from country to country is pretty seamless and I had no hassle going through 14 different countries in 2 1/2 months the last time I was over there. Just make sure you have your passport on you of course :)<br>  <br>  September is the perfect time to be out there! Have a blast and take tons of pictures. <br>  <br>  If you need more info on the trains go to this website, it is very helpful, once I changed the language to English! <br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.bahn.de/p/view/index.shtml" rel="nofollow">http://www.bahn.de/p/view/index.shtml</a>|`|AA10034285	You do not say how you intend to travel. If you are going by air, the flight time is about an hour. If you are going by car, provided you can avoid any really bad weather, you should be able to manage in a long day's travel.<br>  <br>  Both Germany and Italy are members of the European Community so there should be no difficulty in passing from one country to another.
keGOvavbaa	In spite of many of the incorrect answers given, there is no limit with regard to how much cash may be carried out of the United States.  There is, however, the requirement to declare to US Customs amounts of currency, coins, etc. that are $10,000 or more, by filling out the form linked below.  The instructions of that form clearly state (in spite of a few of the incorrect answers already given) that this declaration applies both upon arrival to the US and departure from the US.<br>  <br>  The rules for importation and exportation of cash for other countries may vary, though, so you'll want to check with the customs agency of the country to which you're travelling to see what you're allowed to carry and what you must declare.<br>  <br>  With regard to carrying the cash with you, the airline isn't going to care or require you to fill out any forms for their own purposes.  You'll definitely want to carry it onboard with you, though -- putting it in checked luggage is, essentially, asking for someone to steal it along the way.|`|eulMjLtPaa	Ian is correct.  Just wanted to add that for entry into the US (not departure), anything over $10,000 must be declared.|`|km9cQNAXaa	Assuming you are carrying the money legally then there is no limit. You might be required to declare it on arrival though.<br>  <br>  Some countries have limits on the amount that you can take out of the country but that is set by the government not the airline.<br>  <br>  Ian M|`|onySROuhaa	Its legal to carry under 10 grand I believe internationally without having to declare it.  However I would HIGHLY discourage you from traveling with thousands of dollars in cash anywhere!  I have travelled a lot internationally and I never take more than $100 cash, and even thats a lot!  Internationally its just not safe depending on where you are going and the risk is huge.  Also you can get better exchange rates if you use your card because you get the legit up to the minute rate.  <br>  Also carrying that much cash will probably slow you down at customs because they have a greater likelihood of suspecting you for drug trafficking or other black market activities.|`|n3n9agozaa	it depends where you live and where you going to.. if u  live in USA and want to go out of it then there is a limit that you can take out of USA which is $10,000. second carrying a lot of cash is good in some countries because they don't use credit cards.. so when i go to Iraq .. heck i carry a lot of cash 'cause we don't have any credit cards machines.|`|W2YtVUqKaa	Actually there is a limit to how much you carry in cash but I don't think it's set by the airlines it's set by customs I want to say no more than 15K but I'm not that sure|`|fZSJfirlaa	i think is more safe not to carry cash use your creit card|`|fkHBVn7taa	Depending on what country you are flying to you might have to report that you have a large sum of money that you are carrying.  <br>  I think it would be safer than having cash in the car. In most cases I don't think they care as to how much you are carrying.  As far as your personal safety I would not leave the bag unattended.  In a search they might ask why you have thousands of dollars IN CASH. . its not like they are going to deny you entry because you have tons of cash and if they did it would be the first.    <br>  <br>  There is no rule(s)  by the airlines as far as carrying cash.  I think the only issues you are going to run into is entry customs.   <br>  <br>  Just say you are purchasing some exotic art.|`|3UB7mSNwaa	The airline doesn't care but each country has their own policy on how much cash you can take in their country without telling them.  It could be anywhere from 5000-10000 dollars.  Even if you find out that you have to disclose doesn't mean they are going to take the money away from you they just want to know what you are going to do with it.

Australian qualifications and experience are more highly regarded for immigration purposes and immigration is easier and faster if you have them.<br>  <br>  If you're interested in a trade, you must do that in England as you can't come here for an apprenticeship. We keep them for our own kids. <br>  <br>  You'll need to be at least 18 for immigration, but unless you come as a student, at 18 you won't be old enough to have qualified for any of our required occupations. Most young people take until they're at least around 23 or so to be able to qualify if they do all of their training in their home country.<br>  <br>  If you're serious about moving here, make sure you work towards getting qualifications in an occupation in which we are likely to still need workers when you're ready to come. The Critical Skills list (CSL) includes all of the most urgently required occupations and most of the jobs on there will very probably be needed for the next several years at least, particularly in the trades and health professions:<br>  <a href="http://www.immi.gov.au/skilled/general-skilled-migration/pdf/critical-skills-list.pdf" rel="nofollow">http://www.immi.gov.au/skilled/general-s...</a><br>  The Migrant Occupations in Demand List (MODL) includes the rest of the required jobs but keep an eye on this one because it is due to be updated soon:<br>  <a href="http://www.immi.gov.au/skilled/general-skilled-migration/skilled-occupations/occupations-in-demand.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.immi.gov.au/skilled/general-s...</a><br>  The following list gives details on what type of qualifications are needed for each required occupation.

I laughed out loud when I watched that movie, because they superimposed the mansion into downtown Seattle, about 2 blocks from where I lived at the time.  There is actually a christian scientist church where they showed the mansion.  They did it all with computers.  I think the real mansion is down in Tacoma somewhere.<br>  <br>  They also put Mt.

London is generally always the cheapest. But check out the link below to compare the prices of all the major travel sites.|`|fkHBVn7taa	Here is what I found -- From Boston if wanting London - I found 621.00 RT  into LHR  on undited nad returning on swiss.  <-- LHR will most likely be the cheapest airport to fly into these days with the openskys deal most every airline is competing at the largest airport.  <br>  <br>  Now if you want north UK which is quite beautiful once again from Boston to Manchester I found 601.00 with Continental connecting in EWR. <- so maybe you could drive and save $59.53  <br>  <br>  To Glasgow once again from BOS I found roughly 696.00 on continental.  <br>  <br>  These are monthly averages but the stated prices are the cheapest I could find but not too off from the average price in may and june.<br>  <br>  Some sites to check out are farecast.com or chepoair.com or even kayak.com is quite niice.
CZYXO1NFaa	The Grand Canyon is a pretty neat place if you have never been there, but it will be quite a day worth of driving to get there from Vegas.<br>  <br>  It takes about 4 1/2- 6 hours to get there from Vegas, depending on which rim you decide to visit. You have to kinda drive round about to get there. The best way to go is take Highway 93 South, to Interstate 40 then head East to Highway 64. <br>  <br>  The South Rim is where the Grand Canyon Village is, and is the best place to start and get oriented with the National Park. The visitors center is located in the village and offers lectures, videos and rangers are there to answer questions and help.<br>  <br>  You can also hit the Bright Angel Trail from there, if you have any desire to hike to the bottom of the canyon. If you drive from the Village to the east rim there are some very pretty views.<br>  <br>  The North Rim, is a lot less touristy and is just as pretty without the fanfare.<br>  <br>  All in all I think it is worth seeing at least once in a lifetime. It is amazing, but it will take a good day to get there and back.<br>  <br>  There are also tours that you can get hooked up with in Vegas that will take you to the Grand Canyon and back. They normally have good package deals and offer extras like food or activities.|`|AA11620976	Hi <br>  This is my favorite way to do this trip and the stretch from  the bottom of  the Virgin River Gorge to GCN is one of my favorite stretches of road in America>and I've driven about 80% of Readers Digest top 100 scenic drives in America<br>  Pop this into mapquest exactly like this<br>  LAS>Colorado City AZ>Jacob Lake AZ>GCN >LAS= 675 mi  with 267 of them being GCN>LAS<br>  Notes:<br>  Leave LAS about 1 before sunup b/c the first 90 miles are on flat boring desert<br>  Get breakfast & gas in St George UT>I-15 exit 8<br>  Get gas in Cameron AZ  Kingman AZ I-40 exit 48<br>  Since the drive from GCN to LAS is boring as hell then you may as well watch the sun set over GCNP >Maricopa Point works,> have dinner & back to LAS <br>  The other way to do it is to go LAS >FLG >Cameron AZ >GCN >LAS  and while it's 40 miles less it's half as scenic & you have to go over or around Hoover Dam twice, which negates any potential savings in time<br>  Enjoy the Canyon|`|50ba9dbb26b71c7ae00921a624a4d0b5aa	A little expensive, but IMO this is far and away the best way to see the Grand Canyon.

2bca07912249cffd6d15a663fd5ae28caa	the island is called "Roosevelt Island". years ago, before all the residential housing went up, it was called "Welfare Island". nowadays you can take the F train there. the island has its own stop. before the subway there was finished, a sky tram went over there from Manhattan right at 2nd Avenue and the Queensboro Bridge. this sky tram still runs, but now costs extra and is more of a tourist thing.. before the tram existed and before regular people lived there, the only way to the island was a little bridge from the Queens side.<br>  <br>  you learn something new every day. i know i do, and i'm also a native!|`|IBMDQpmRaa	That's Roosevelt Island. There's a tram to Manhattan, which you've probably seen as you drove by. There's also a subway stop on the F train, and a road bridge to Queens for cars and the Q102 bus.|`|f8aa8e21997cfa7908574dfa12f124cdaa	My friend, that island is called Roosevelt Island.<br>  <br>  I hope this information is very helpful.<br>  <br>  Good luck<br>  Native New Yorker|`|MmTe8W8uaa	The one near the Queensboro Bridge with a tram connecting it to Manhattan is Roosevelt Island.<br>  <br>  The one near the Triboro Bridge is Wards Island.<br>  <br>  The one with a jail is Rikers Island.

Even then the racial tensions between indigenous Fijians and the Indian community were apparent and as it is under a nasty military junta at the moment I'd suggest there are better places to the Sth Pacific - Samoa is just as beautiful and less touristy|`|4cWtH7X2aa	I spent my honeymoon in Fiji last September. It was simply paradise. The people are wonderful, happy and social. I never noticed any political tension at all while I was there. We stayed at the Koro Sun Resort near Savusavu, on Vanua Levu. I absolutely loved every minute of it.<br>  <br>  Mind you it was  a very expensive trip. We came from Canada so from Toronto to L.A. and then on to Nadi airfare alone was close to $4000 CAD for both of us. The resort was all inclusive and cost $2500 USD for 1 week. My opinion....totally worth it!|`|s2IOyj8iaa	Yes I have and really had a lovely time . I've stayed at 2 different places. One was on Denarau island at the world mark. Fabulous location fabulous resort on the beach handy to to nadi township. Got the local bus that was great going around little villages on the way . We had our own kitchen so the stay there didn't cost us hardly any money just for food at the supermarket a small amount for the bus . Also stayed at The Coral Coast. From there we took a day trip to Suva I wasn't impressed with Suva but pleased I went but have no desires to return. Stayed at the Out Rigger on the Coral Coast in a beurre now that was fabulous they had various activities and the breakfast was in the deal. The Breakfast was amazing and we ate that much we didn't need lunch. The Coral Coast is out of the way really quite a distance from the airport but if you stay at a good resort then the holiday is great. I haven't been to any of the out lying islands but I believe there is some wonderful places out there.|`|90tPT5nlaa	Yes I went to the Shangri-La for a conference.

So, I guess I would have to say constructive.|`|AA12068233	Huh? It's constructive, I suppose.    It's a nice place to go hiking. You can walk up Stone Mountain or hike around the surronding trails. You can sit on the lawn and watch the laser shows at night. It's a little cheesy, but fun.|`|ewd9n2lRaa	as to what?  You need to be a little more descriptive with your question.|`|LsAArkUyaa	It is both. the formation of the stone was constructive.

Still, it has its good side and I use it at times, but knowing the shortcomings of the system.<br>  <a href="http://maps.google.co.uk/maps" rel="nofollow">http://maps.google.co.uk/maps</a>|`|1CVOHoapaa	www.theaa.com will give you full directions and travelling time.

EJpiaCMQaa	I visited the Santa Barbara Zoo and enjoyed it very much.  They have a great variety of animals to observe at the zoo including, alligators, snakes, frogs, gorillas, giraffes (I fed some giraffes), leapards, birds, turtles, pandas, lions and tigers.  My favorites are the penguin house, elephant walk, avairies (I was able to feed the lorikeets), flamingos.  They have zoo camps for kids.  There is a zoo train that kids enjoy riding.  The zoo also has a carousel.  <br>  <br>  Visit this link for more information:<br>  <a href="http://www.santabarbarazoo.org" rel="nofollow">http://www.santabarbarazoo.org</a>
KiN3KVihaa	Alligators stay away from springs (they are afraid of people).  Go to a place called Three Sisters springs in Crystal River (2 hours west and a little bit north of Orlando).  If you go out a little bit away from the springs you can even swim with the manatees (and alligators stay away from manatees as well).  the only problem is you'll have to rent a boat/kayak to get to the springs, as there is no public land access.
Jm3vMKx3aa	Are you sure that you have been at the right embassy?<br>  I ask that because the formal obligation letter "Verpflichtungserkl?rung" is required by a German citizen or resident who wants to sponsor an Indian citizen for a visitor visa to Germany.<br>  <br>  The Danish system does not have that type of formal obligation. If the visit is sponsored by a reference person in Denmark the reference must send the following supporting documents:<br>  Passport copy (reference being a Danish national)<br>  Residence permit copy (reference being a non Danish national)<br>  Detailed sponsorship letter stating the applicant’s name, address and relationship with the reference, duration of stay and the financial nature of the sponsorship (letter in original and not older than three months).<br>  <br>  There is no certain form prescribed for a letter of invitation for a visa. The following information is only a guide. <br>  The host must write the letter of invitation herself. By writing a letter of invitation, she is not legally responsible for the foreigner once the visitor got into the country, but she should provide the letter in good faith. She must give truthful information and intend to keep the promises she made in the letter. She must send the letter to the person she is inviting. The visa applicant must then submit this letter to the Embassy or Consulate of the country when he applies for the visa.<br>  The letter must include the following information about the person being invited:<br>  ? complete name. <br>  ? date of birth. <br>  ? the person’s address and telephone number. <br>  ? the relationship to the person being invited. <br>  ? the purpose of the trip. <br>  ? how long the person invited intends to stay in the country. <br>  ? details on accommodation and living expenses. <br>  ? the date the person you are inviting intends to leave the country. <br>  The letter must also include the following information about the host:<br>  ? complete name. <br>  ? date of birth. <br>  ? address and telephone number. <br>  ? occupation. <br>  ? whether she is a citizen or a permanent resident <br>  ? a photocopy of a document proving her status in her country (passport, Identification card, birth certificate)<br>  ? a proof of permanent resident status (if she is a Permanent Resident)<br>  <br>  <br>  Source(s):<br>  <a href="http://www.ambnewdelhi.um.dk/en/menu/ConsularServices/visadk/" rel="nofollow">http://www.ambnewdelhi.um.dk/en/menu/Con...</a><br>  <a href="http://www.chennai.diplo.de/Vertretung/chennai/en/Formulare__RK/Visa/download__visa__InfosheetSchengenTouristVisa,property=Daten.pdf" rel="nofollow">http://www.chennai.diplo.de/Vertretung/c...</a>

A long sleeved shirt or sweater or cardigan or somethin would be cute. Disneyland is not a dressy place, haha, just look presentable & be comfortable, 'cause you're gonna be walking... A lot :]<br>  <br>  Wear decent shoes. I have no problem with flip flops, but some people do. Sneakers or tennis shoes would probably be best for walking, though.

You can easily walk 5-10 miles in a day in the parks. So figure on wearing some good tennies, or whatever you have that supports your feet. NOT flip-flops. I don't recommend Crocs, either.<br>  <br>  Other than that, it will depend on the weather. Early March can be windy and rainy, or it can be mild.

AA10144812	I'm a travel agent, and have been on Royal Caribbean two times. The newer ships are the best. They have a ice skating rink, rock climbing wall. and a whole lot more. The newer ships are huge, which your brother would probably like, because you won't feel the ship moving because of the stabilizers. The newer ships are nothing like the old ones like Titantic. They are a lot safer. It feels like you are in a hotel on the ocean. I can't give you exact prices because you have to let me know when you are going. The prices vary because of the seasons, the best time you can find good prices is like in September, but that is hurricane season and u have a chance of your cruise being canceled. Email me a djd832001@yahoo.com and I'll give you some prices. Also I'll send u a link of some of the cruise ships that u might be interested in.

A 400-square foot apartment is going to run you about $2,000/month, so keep that in mind when you calculate your budget for utilities, transportation, food, sales tax (which is astronomically high) and other assorted fees.|`|f4759393d980deadc3255b5837265f76aa	I don't want to be a stick in the mud but unless you are coming to the US to attend university, the chances of you living in NYC are as close to zero as can be.  Unless you have a unique skill or are sponsored by a UK company with a presence in NYC you will not receive a visa.<br>  For mor information about moving to the US, check out the US Embassy website:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.usembassy.org.uk/cons_new/visa/index.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.usembassy.org.uk/cons_new/vis...</a><br>  <a href="http://www.usembassy.org.uk/cons_new/visa/iv/index.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.usembassy.org.uk/cons_new/vis...</a>|`|ECB8u72Taa	You can't just simply apply for a visa, come to new york, and then get a green card.  If you come to the US seeking work without a green card it is highly unlikely that anyone will hire you.  Due to job losses there has been a significant cutback on H1B work visas, so unless you have advanced skills in a rare area (paperboys and waiters don't usually count) your chances of getting such a visa are exactly zero.  Also, don't try to come to the US and work here without a proper visa.  If you're caught you'll be banned from entry for a number of years, and likely face fines and it might make it difficult to ever obtain a green card.<br>  <br>  However, hope is not lost.  If you're really committed to moving to New York City you can do it the old fashioned way:<br>  - find an american girlfriend<br>  - marry her<br>  - get your green card<br>  - move to new york city<br>  <br>  But, unless she's rich you're going to have to support your new wife in one of the more expensive cities in the US.  And I doubt that you'll want to get married so early anyway!<br>  <br>  So, get your degree and relax.  It's cheap to visit NYC from the UK so you can always visit in the summers and enjoy a great city!|`|2bca07912249cffd6d15a663fd5ae28caa	bookish is right. there are no academic requirements in moving to NYC. we have a lot (maybe even too many!) of morons here!|`|1FPpglMpaa	It might help but only in the sense that a company that needs your particular skills will want to sponsor you to come here to work because and American can't fill the position.  Employers are aware that the British school system is a very good one and therefore well educated.  However, there are specific rules to getting a green card.  you should look online for the requirements and then try to get hired by a company with offices in the UK and NYC or hone a skill that we need..

Df7k9bgVaa	Where exactly on the east coast do you live.  It makes a big difference if you live in Florida vs. if you live in Maine.  If you are from the northeast I would suggest Cape Cod, MA.  There are a lot of things to do there including a ton of beaches, arcades, miniature golf, and shopping.  There are also places like that in Southern Maine.  Lake George, NY is also a lot of fun but the beach is on a lake.  They have a lot of attractions though.  Hampton Beach, NH is also a good destination.  If you are somewhere in the middle of the east coast you could try Virginia Beach.  Florida has Miami, Vero Beach, ect.

EOZsYlZkaa	The shampoo, conditioner, soap, lotion are a better quality. The bathrooms often have marble counters. The decoration is more upscale, the sheets are softer, you get a choice of pillows, the bathrobes are fluffier. The choice of snacks and beverages is greater (and more expensive).The restaurants are better (and more expensive). The lobbies are nicer and usually filled with flowers. When it comes right down to it, unless you're going to spend your time in your room, showering and snacking, and then hang out in the lobby, it's not really worth it. Although, then again, one should splurge every now and then.

vhlORK4Waa	Ah...you have hit on something that straight away gives away a gresat deal about the person using the word - W.C., toilet (toylit), loo, bog, lavatory (lav), powder room, wash room,  bathroom, little girl's/boy's room (bit nauseating that), all euphemisms.....for the lavatory.....a light hearted slightly embarassed way of describing where one relieves onself.<br>  <br>  People even say "oh I need to go" whilst nodding or raising an eyebrow.<br>  <br>  The Oxford Dictionary of etymology gives this<br>  <br>  There are several theories about the origin of this common term for a familiar article of sanitary furniture. The first, and most popular, is that it is derived from the cry of 'gardyloo' (from the French regardez l'eau 'watch out for the water') which was shouted by medieval servants as they emptied the chamber-pots out of the upstair windows into the street. This is historically problematic, since by the time the term 'loo' is recorded, the expression 'gardyloo' was long obsolete. A second theory is that the word derives from a polite use of the French term le lieu ('the place') as a euphemism. Unfortunately, documentary evidence to support this idea is lacking. A third theory, favoured by many, refers to the trade name 'Waterloo', which appeared prominently displayed on the iron cisterns in many British outhouses during the early 20th century. This is more credible in terms of dates, but corroborating evidence is still frustratingly hard to find. <br>  <br>  Halcon|`|GHefTsUyaa	No it's not.|`|fKpBXXJbaa	Reputedly in the days before sewers people would empty their chamberpots out of the window into the street, yelling in French, for some reason, "'gardez l'eau" or "gardee loo" ("watch out for the water").|`|62RKtkOhaa	Reputedly in the days before sewers people would empty their chamberpots out of the window into the street, yelling in French, for some reason, "'gardez l'eau" or "gardee loo" ("watch out for the water").<br>  <br>  <br>  That's the correct answer - I heard that on TV yonks ago, and it does come from the fact that in GB French used to be the main language.
AA10956234	Sure, Movies and Media in general are affecting our thoughts and our vision, <br>  <br>  But it all depends, some of the movies are trying to give new ideas or help in specific issue, like Dryest said "2oreed 7alan" and the movie changed or was part that affect the Rules, <br>  <br>  Other movies are trying to focus on something and to show allll the beauty of this thing and focus on the worst of the opposite just to make you feel good about what they want, <br>  <br>  I saw 2 days ago "Schindler's List" and it show how the jews suffered from the Nazis, and All the jews are angels!!!!!! <br>  I mean, it will be more realistic if they show the good and the bad side of them, not only try to show them as Angels, I know that jews suffered , but NOT only them, the germans were killing many people from different religions and cultures, not only the jews, <br>  <br>  An example of changing thoughts and even affect the system and the rules, Amr adeeb in el kahera el youm, and everyone knows that, <br>  <br>  For me, Many of the movies affected me, and I learned alot from many of them, "little miss sunshine" is one of the latest movies that affected me, and the car in the movie is a symbol for life, or the journey of life, and whatever will happen the car must continue the journey, <br>  <br>  I can talk years abt the movies, I love Movies,|`|hhhk499qaa	probably like 20%|`|ravzJTVOaa	a movie can make me sympathise with a group or category .<br>  an example is a movie of Robin Hood .<br>  he takes from the rich and gives the poor .<br>  this isnt acceptable , but we tend to encourage him as the hero of the movie .|`|fb0OkczJaa	Yes, some celebrities express their views and some who follow their careers will do as they say.

AA10144812	I've been on RCCL two times and both cruises are wonderful. Its a little more pricier than Carnival but I think its worth the price. The ships are larger and there is more activities. The food is wonderful too. And they have beautiful ships. There is a ice skating rink on some of the ships, rock climbing wall. I think RCCL has activities for all age groups and its more classier. I am a travel agent and I can help you with your travel needs and find a cruise ship that will work for you. Email me at djd832001@yahoo.com.

They are very similar as they are both budget lines.  What did you not like about Carnival?<br>  <br>  Booking a newer ship might solve some of your problems if you did not like how old the ship was.  Newer ships have more stuff.  Booking a more expensive cabin won't solve any of your problems as I doubt your big problem was really that the cabin was too small.  However if your problem was the people, low budget cruises all draw the same crowd.  If your problem was the crew or the style of cruising (Carnival does lots of games sorta like Field Day in Elementary school), switch cruise lines.<br>  <br>  But if Carnival just seemed cheap to you, RC will feel the same way.  Perhaps you might want to try a more upscale cruiseline like Princess or Celebrity.  If your problem was the size of the ship, you might want to try a different style of cruising like Windjammer.|`|94b8KImYaa	Since you did not like Carnival, I would go for Royal. <br>  One of the answers above indicates you have to pay for the food on RCCl, which is not correct. <br>  <br>  Maybe you want to go more into detail, what you and your family is looking for on a cruise. <br>  <br>  I personally prefer smaller ships, more destination oriented and with no children onboard.|`|G4BSv4jbaa	Without question - ROYAL CARIBBEAN! I have been on two cruises with Royal Caribbean and they were the best vacations of my life. There are so many activities/shows on board and excusions offshore, that you don't know where to even begin to have fun. There is no cruise line even remotely close to RC.<br>  <br>  I just recently got off a one week cruise on the Norwegian Gem. WHAT A MISTAKE!! There were almost no activities,(teens had to play tag on the stairs and halls for fun) the food was not so great, the shows were a joke, the crew staff were not genuinely accommodating, and as a bonus, hundreds of people were sicken with the norovirus including my entire family. To make matters worse, the ship medical facility was only open for one hour during the day and you had to make appointments?

A2u6G8Ooaa	I think you will it difficult to avoid romantic places in Rome or Venice, especially at night. Plus both city centers are very safe.<br>  <br>  I live in Rome so I will stick to giving you tips for Rome.<br>  Janiculum hill at sunset is beautiful. This is the best position in Rome  to enjoy views over the city. Janiculum hill is next to the Vatican.<br>  See free tourist attraction no 6 <a href="http://www.romanlife-romeitaly.com/rome-tourist-attractions.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.romanlife-romeitaly.com/rome-...</a><br>  If you are feeling very Romantic you can continue a Roman tradition and place a lock around a lamp post at Ponte Milvio. (Also see Rome tourist attraction no 6).<br>  <br>  Walk through the Trastevere area at night, through the narrow cobbled alleyways and beautiful piazzas. There's something for everyone, and something new and interesting around every corner.<br>  <a href="http://www.romanlife-romeitaly.com/trastevere.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.romanlife-romeitaly.com/trast...</a><br>  <br>  Walk along the Tiber River (Tevere), not at the top (road level) but rather below along the river bank where there is a cycling lane. You will feel like you're not in the center of Rome and have a totally different perspective on historical Rome.<br>  <br>  Enjoy it, you really can't go wrong in either city, and I'm sure you will "discover" so many places that you will call your own.|`|0PLV5uXjaa	big ben|`|rvTcDJ6yaa	its hard to escape the tourists!!!! THere are LOTS. Venice is quite small and you can easily walk about it in a day..if not twice. You might be able to find a place in the back streets..although i found them a bit creepy and dank. Verona is pretty and about 1 1/2 from venice by train and there is the romeo and juliet theme there too. pretty garden there but forgotton the name...its right on the edge of the tourist map ( cause I walked off the map) <br>  Rome is larger but i stuck to the tourist spots but it might be easier to find a quiet place there????|`|afe8b1413b2f535e7b3907b31756a337aa	I was just in both of those cities at the start of January with my girlfriend. They are amazing places and you will have a blast. Venice is more romantic than Rome, which isn't surprising. Depending on when you go (hopefully the weather is nicer than it was when I was there) you should go on a gondola ride. To be honest though both cities are so touristy, but if you try to go in less crowded areas, you're more likely to have a peaceful and romantic time. In Venice for the least touristy areas, try finding a nice Italian restaurant in the area of Castello. <br>  <br>  Hope you have as great of a trip as I did!|`|Cx9pdQ1Zaa	yea!Rome and Venice are very Beautiful...I live in Rome...so I can suggest to go to pincio that is a balcony were you can  see Rome...it is situated in "Villa Borghese" near Condotti street and spagna Place..there are lots of tourist in the morning and in the afternoon...but if you went there during launce time...there aren't many people..another place can be Sant Angelo's Castle...it is very beautiful see the sunset here....in Venice every place is a romantic place...enjoy your trip!!|`|CD2KkYJnaa	i've been to rome twice when i was in the military and its mostly all tourists.    the night life is awesome and if you guys like to party, check out the Spanish Steps pub crawl or the Colliseum pub crawl.  besides that, just maybe find a small no name restaurant outdoors at evening time and sip a glass of fine wine !!|`|Ns7jVadMaa	I can help you ;) I am an italian girl living in rome...the most romantic place here is the "Caffè Zodiaco", its address is Viale del Parco Mellini 88/90/92 ...it is a restaurant/bar very close to my house and i go there very often,you should go there during the night to see the most wonderful sightseeing of the city....near the caffè there is a little street called "Viale degli innamorati", which means "The lovers' street" and it' magical................I swear! let's visit this place,you 'll enjoy rome by night with its lights and its history!<br>  p.s. you like gabriel garcia marquez!! me too =O <3|`|1F09pRcnaa	I can suggest this website <a href="http://www.scoobit.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.scoobit.com</a> and this page dedicated to Rome hotels in particular  <a href="http://www.scoobit.com/accommodations-rome-hotels.php" rel="nofollow">http://www.scoobit.com/accommodations-ro...</a> I stayed at the third hotel on the left. It was a clean, well located and nicely staffed hotel. Not over-priced. It's a safe site. I book hotels through Scoobit.com frequently. You can book on line and there are no booking fees.

lo3T01BOaa	Yes, I've been to Myrtle Beach, SC. It's a nice place.<br>  <br>  What hotel did you stay at? The Marriott Grande Dunes.<br>  <br>  Good bars? Didn't go to any bars, but there's a few places downtown, but not many as it's not that type of city.<br>  <br>  What can a 14 and 12 year old do there? There is lot's to do for kids that age. Broadway at the Beach, mini golf, the many theme parks, water parks, etc.<br>  <br>  And is there a hotel there that we can bring our dog? Most hotels anywhere do not accept pets, you'll have to do some research to find a pet friendly hotel.

PA0bGBtCaa	Which airline are you flying on from Des Moines/Memphis/Caribbean on? I would assume Northwest since Memphis one of their hub cities. If you are staying on the same airline, then they will check your bag through all the way to your final destination in the Caribbean.<br>  <br>  When you are on your layover in Memphis, you will just go to the international side of the airport and find your gate and wait to leave Memphis. But it isn't always so simple.<br>  <br>  For instance, if you are flying on two different airlines, you need to make sure the airlines are in a code share agreement. A code share means that multiple airlines sell tickets on each other to give the traveler the most flexibility. If the airlines are in a codeshare, then they transfer your bags for you as well and they are able to check them through all the way to your final destination.<br>  <br>  There are some instances when the airlines are not in code shares. Such an instance would be **Example** flying on Southwest Airlines from New Orleans to Orlando and then from Orlando to Cancun on JetBlue. Those airlines do not have any agreements with each other. In this instance, you would have to claim your bags in Orlando, and then recheck them in with JetBlue to CUN. The same thing would happen when the passenger would fly back. Why do people do this? Well sometimes going on different airlines can save you a lot of money, but it also costs you a lot of time.<br>  <br>  Again, if you are on one airline, then you'll just check in your bags one time and pick them up in your final destination. But if you know you're on two different carriers, just ask the reservation agent when you check-in if your bags are going to be checked in all the way to the Caribbean. Have a safe flight!|`|qdsVS1dDaa	If you are just making a connection in Memphis, the agent in Des Moines will check your luggage through to your Caribbean destination.  <br>  <br>  Regards,<br>  Dan<br>  <br>  PS Don't use the term "layover" unless you are going to be in a city for a while-days.|`|4gve3I6Xaa	As long as your layover is still within the US you won't have to.  But lots of times when you're returning to the US and you have a layover, you have to go through immigration and pick up your luggage and recheck it before continuing to your connecting flight, but lots of times when you're coming from the Caribbean, depending on which part of the Caribbean, they do all the immigration stuff before, so you won't have to do it during your layover.|`|AA11954458	no you dont

10c1407ad3b148843d1e616e9a4c6215aa	Le Vent des Forêts is an association of six forest villages: Dompcevrin, Fresnes-au-Mont, Lahaymeix, Nicey-sur-Aire, Pierrefitte-sur-Aire et Ville-devant-Belrain, that have been welcoming modern artists from all over the world for the last ten years in the summer months. As a result 45 Kms of forest paths have been created dotted with various artistic creations accessible to all  from March to September. <br>  The artists are put up and fed by the local population. They work every day on their artifacts and meet in the evenings to discuss their achievements or get mutual help and advice. The locals also give a hand if they want to. Once the works are finished they are left untouched as if they were in an indoor art gallery. They weather or perish at random depending on what materials have been used.<br>  The site received over 60.000 visitors last year.<br>  <br>  Here are the various articles on the subject, some of which are older than others so may say "six years ago", but this year will be the eleventh year. <br>  <a href="http://assoc.pagespro-orange.fr/enmeuse/" rel="nofollow">http://assoc.pagespro-orange.fr/enmeuse/</a><br>  <a href="http://www.en-lorraine.com/ventdesforets/" rel="nofollow">http://www.en-lorraine.com/ventdesforets...</a><br>  <a href="http://www.otsi-saintmihiel.fr/VentForet.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.otsi-saintmihiel.fr/VentForet...</a><br>  <a href="http://www.leventdesforets.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.leventdesforets.com/</a><br>  <a href="http://verdun.over-blog.net/article-21391744.html" rel="nofollow">http://verdun.over-blog.net/article-2139...</a><br>  <a href="http://www.cnap.fr/index.php?page=presentation&rep=listeAnnuaire&idInstitution=1145&institution=le-vent-des-forets" rel="nofollow">http://www.cnap.fr/index.php?page=presen...</a><br>  <a href="http://www.exporevue.com/magazine/fr/vent_foret.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.exporevue.com/magazine/fr/ven...</a><br>  <a href="http://www.site-en-bois.net/fr/dec/art/ventdesforets.phtml" rel="nofollow">http://www.site-en-bois.net/fr/dec/art/v...</a>|`|OQFSG3Ihaa	Have a search through- www.google.fr<br>  <br>  The official site is under construction.<br>  <br>  Put any pages through the Google translator if necessary.

In summer? How old are you? If you are 15 to 40 Rimini  is definitely the best place to go and have fun - best go to RICCIONE that is near to Rimini. Beaches are not that nice, but in summer it is the best place in Italy to go and have fun and go shopping. Don't go to Lido degli Estensi, it isn't the right place to party and the shopping is not good. In Viareggio you can find nicer beaches than in Jesolo and Rimini, nightlife is also good, but not as good as Riccione. Let's say that Riccione is also a good substitute for fashion in summer (during the rest of the year you would go to Milan for shopping). If you are rich and you like VIPs then go to Milano Marittima (also near Rimini), but Riccione is definetely more fun!! Maybe you would also consider to go to Sardinia, where beaches are breathtaking and there are places like Porto Cervo where yuo can go shopping and party, but it is really expensive. You can buy only D&G, Armani, Versace etc staff and you have to pay a lot to go to parties... Actually it is worth for the beaches, really marvellous beaches... <br>  Have fun!!!
b8tgCAQJaa	For the four of you, it would be ￡118.10 single or ￡135.00 return if you buy your tickets on the day.<br>  <br>  This price includes a Family Railcard discount. You may as well get a Family Railcard if you're doing a journey like this, as it more than pays for itself just for this one journey.<br>  <br>  There are direct trains from Tamworth to Newcastle, running approximately every two hours during the day. The journey time is about 3 hours 15 minutes.<br>  <br>  If you book well in advance (like weeks/months in advance) and commit to travelling on a specific train, you can save a huge amount of money. Advance tickets start from ￡20.40 each way (that's the total price for all four of you!), or ￡40.80 return.|`|lVHqoNVEaa	You can look it up on the National Rail website or more specifically a website such as National Express East Coast.
xSHRJw46aa	Consider Vegas.  We don't club or party either, but we have been there a couple times.  It is kind of fun for a day or so.  We spend about $50 or less in slots in two days.  Usually the drinks they bring you while you are play almost balance out the expenditure for us.  We might catch a show or concert.  Then see the hotels.  I just like walking around and to the different casinos.  We spend a buck or two in a slot if we get the urge.  See the free shows like the pirate ship at TI, and the fountains at Bellagio.  Have a nice dinner in the evening (though the food there can be quite expensive at the really nice places).  Hang at the pool if it is in-season.<br>  <br>  On the other hand, anything at the beach is a good idea.|`|b8e17f565936253241a343443917ca6baa	One of the best things my wife and I ever did was buy a National Parks Passport (which cost about 8 bucks).  We plan all our trips around trying to hit the National Parks/National Historic Sites, with a lifetime goal of hitting them all (300+).  It's a great way to see a variety of places, it's inexpensive, and it gives us something really special to share together.  We planned our honeymoon around visiting all the NPs in Hawaii and we planned our 10-year anniversary around visiting an NP off of Key West (because those were really special occasions and we figured we might not ever get the chance again).  One year we got cheap plane tickets to Seattle for our anniversary (in Feb off-season) and got to see Mount Rainier and some of the cool spots up there.  - - - One place that's a day or two away from you that we really loved was Mammoth Caves NP in Kentucky!  New Mexico is beautiful too!

2HETgiwgaa	There are several "streams" to come to New Zealand to live.  One of those is as a skilled migrant with a job offer - but (no offense) I'm guessing at coming up 18 you don't yet qualify as a skilled migrant.<br>  <br>  Another option is to come as a student - and if you want to be able to stay when you finish your course, I'd recommend planning ahead and picking courses that meet with the areas where we have skills shortages.  That will improve your chances of being able to stay permanently.  I've included links to our universities so you can have a look at what's on offer.<br>  <br>  There is no income level as such, but Immigration New Zealand will want to be satisfied that you are able to support yourself.  If you do have money and skills to set up a business here, coming as a business migrant may be an option.  There is an investor category - but you need millions to qualify, and you still need to meet other requirements.<br>  <br>  The Immigration New Zealand links below should be a good place to start - good luck with your plans.|`|f610fce787e6299e681ff222a3173ed5aa	Honey forget it.

It is the fifth largest metropolitan area in the nation. The Bay Area has 13 seats in the U.S. House of Representatives (more than the entire state of Massachusetts).

I've travelled there many times and I think it's gotten blown out of proportion.  The people who are gay tend to hangout around Polk Street.  So if you are straight, stay out of that vicinity.  You can find many straight women to meet in San Francisco.  <br>  <br>  Polk Street runs northward from Market Street to Beach Street through the Polk Gulch neighborhood.  The Polk Gulch neighborhood runs through the Tenderloin and Russian Hill neighborhoods from Geary Street to Union Street.  The Tenderloin is a pretty rough area, so you'll want to avoid it regardless.

It will take about 3 to 5 hours actual travel time, home or hotel to destination.<br>  By train it takes longer, if not all that much, and more money too.|`|OHfZFR31aa	Belgium is also really nice - just take the Eurostar from London to Brussels|`|AA10527991	Estonia.  Nice and flat but with very interesting sights to see.  Close to London via airlines.|`|DfwltQPvaa	I suggest Amsterdam. Canals and bicyclists everywhere. It's not that long of train ride from london, maybe a day trip.
Lngb8ryFaa	i havent been to a concert at SPAC in years (it was actually dave matthews on the HORDE festival in '95!!)..SPAC is great though--one of the best concert venuues anywhere, even eddie vedder of pearl jam said so...the tailgating is great, its all on grass fields (i hate tailgating on concrete parking lots), every one is really into it, and security doesnt hassle you at all--there are alot of characters there which just lends to the authenticity of it..|`|ZsUVoDcKaa	The place where I usually go is Moreau Lake State Park. Its about a 15 minute drive away from SPAC.
mnIeK8q6aa	Rule of the thumb: anything imported is expensive. Especially alcohol! Vodka, martini and cider all all imported and consequently very expensive. <br>  <br>  If you are happy to drink local drinks and mixers (soda or coke with Thai whiskey) you are financially much better off.|`|86e53ae673b0e71a74c555f56f9f3708aa	Around 100-150 baht in many bars, can be less and as much as 250 baht or more in the nicer clubs and good hotel bars. There are also many 2 for 1 deals in lots of pubs, bars and hotel bars. The pours are usually very short and you're lucky if you get 1 oz. in most places. The thing to do in Thailand is to buy the whole bottle, where they do sell bottles you can buy the whole bottle for around 800-1200 baht and then pay a nominal charge for ice and mixers. If you don't finish the bottle, when you leave they will number the bottle and give you a card with the number on it and you drink the next time you come in without paying anything for the alcohol, or you can take it with you when you leave although you can't drink it in other bars. You'll rarely see locals buy one drink at a time at places where they sell bottles and not all places sell bottles, but where they do it's the only way to go.|`|AA10254694	Whiskey Lao 40 baht per pint.  Same as vodka.  Mix with a little OJ.<br>  <br>  In cider about 1000 baht in Pattaya or 3000 in Bangkok.|`|qUiQF8x3aa	Prices vary quite a bit in Thailand. Some mainly tiyrist bars are expensive but you can find local thai bars, lots of fun, and cheaper about 40baht a beer and maybe 50-60 for a vodka.<br>  Cheaper to buy a bottle at the supermarket or 7-11|`|910537da330152ad69b869eeff90d14eaa	from the 7-11?  pretty cheap as I recall.  Now- buy the same bottle of booze at a high end club?  Suddenly, the same bottle goes for 10x what you'd pay.<br>  <br>  *traveller's tip-  if you plan on bringing a bottle to a party or as a gift, pick one up at the airport's duty free shop.  Very good selection at very good prices.|`|AA11285960	depends on where you're buying it...in like the expensive hotels it might run 150- 200 Baht (like 4 dollars) but in a cheap bar it might be 50-100 (1.50- 2.50)|`|AA11960711	Deprnds where you are staying Pattaya, Chiang Mai anything from 70 - 120 Baht,<br>  Phuket 100 - 150 or even more if 5 star hotels.<br>  If you you want to buy drinks to take into your hotel room just buy from any 7-11 store , have a few before you go out to put yourself in the mood.<br>  have a nice time
10c1407ad3b148843d1e616e9a4c6215aa	I have guided many students round the Loire Valley and was a little surprised by your selection of visits  but I suspect that you may be following an itinerary based on a book or a novel that harks back to medieval times, hence your interest for locations that no longer have a castle.<br>  Tours has not had a castle for a very long time.

West of Tours, there is Ussé, which is often described as "Sleeping Beauty's castle" and it is supposed to have inspired the fairy tale.<br>  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ch%C3%A2teau_d'Uss%C3%A9" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ch%C3%A2tea...</a><br>  <br>  For other castles in the Loire Valley look at:<br>  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Loire_Valley" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Loire_Valle...</a> <br>  <a href="http://www.loire.net/chateaux/" rel="nofollow">http://www.loire.net/chateaux/</a><br>  <br>  Have a wonderful trip!|`|OQFSG3Ihaa	Chateau de Tours used to be an aquarium and is now a museum on the heritage of Tours, strange option for a tourist.<br>  <br>  Azay-le-Rideau, all on the website; <a href="http://azay-le-rideau.monuments-nationaux.fr/en/bdd/page/visites" rel="nofollow">http://azay-le-rideau.monuments-nationau...</a><br>  <br>  Doue-la-Fountain, Is a ancient village with no Chateau.<br>  <br>  Brissac, The Chateau here is a hotel but can be visited, <br>  <a href="http://www.chateau-brissac.fr/2006/english.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.chateau-brissac.fr/2006/engli...</a><br>  <br>  In my opinion (apart from Azay) I would consider visiting some of the other more famous Chateaux in this area.

Las Vegas is not known as a popular destination for spring break. It is a conservative city, and neither the police nor the local residents tolerate much of the conduct most spring breakers enjoy. <br>  <br>  If you are over 21 and are going there to visit the city you may have some fun, but if you're expecting the usual spring break activities (getting as drunk as possible, lots of promiscuous sex, loud parties late into the night) you will quickly be made to feel unwelcome.

0ZfZulnzaa	Right now it may be hard to find a job in the oil fields, they are anticipating laying off over 17,000 this year in the oil industry, they have already let go maybe half that number already. But it will pick back up sometime in the future, just not sure when.<br>  <br>  What you can do is check the major oil companies websites to see what they have for students, as well as the student job board for HRDC, but I know right now jobs are slim and the ones there are, you have so much competition for. <br>  <br>  My husband works in Fort Mac area and he has been seeing people leaving left right and centre. It is probably only a matter of time before he will be out of there as well. <br>  <br>  Just look at the jobs wanted and hopefully you will find something. You can also check into Saskatchewan, we have a lot of oil work happening in the south east, and north west/central area of the province.|`|2wyDALHgaa	I think there are still lots of jobs out here but not in the way it used to be.  Until recently there were very high paying jobs up in the oil field area and the more average jobs were going unfilled.  Here in Edmonton, at least in the north part of town, it's hard to find a fast food joint (McD's, Wendy's...) or even a Timmies open overnight due to a shortage of people who will work for that kinda money.  <br>  <br>  If you are looking for a job like that then save your travel money and stay where you are.  Other then that, there is no pot of gold at the end of the rainbow in Alberta at this time.  Not till things pick up again that is.|`|U9pnPXnpaa	There are no longer any get-rich-quick jobs in the oilfield.   They are laying off people left and right.   <br>  <br>  The whole industry is basically on hold right now.
3K1QW7Oeaa	I don't think such a place exists. There's no such thing as perfection in this world so we just learn to deal with that.<br>  <br>  And as of today, I HATE MY TOWN SO BAD because I'm surrounded by IDIOTS!!|`|CpJnhy1saa	I think the place where I live is perfect FOR ME. There is fantastic recreation, education, medical facilities, cost of living, and breathtaking scenery. Now given this, I do live in a state that has four distinct seasons, and not everyone likes that. I live in a small city which is great but some people thrive in the big city. I only have 2.5 hours to Minneapolis and 5 hours to Chicago, so I have lots of choices for great dining, shopping and entertainment any weekend I like. I live in La Crosse County Wisconsin, on the shores of the beautiful Mississippi River Valley. I spend my summers on my houseboat, waterskiing or on the hundreds of miles of bike trails.|`|ShvCaGubaa	No I can't say I actually Love where I live, I have traveled a lot too, there is so much out there.

cSBZQfaIaa	Apartments Venus <br>  Avenida Dr. Fleming 48-50, Sant Antoni de Portmany 07820, Spain <br>  <br>  These are good apartments in a really good location - only five minutes walk from the beach and right beside supermarkets. About 15mins takes you to the west end and only 10mins to Eden and es Paradise if you are here for clubbing - though taxis are cheap anyway.The apartments are kept very clean and really well equipped - lots of pots and pans etc to cook a meal if you wanted, the decor is a little dated but the apartments are good and spacious so it doesn't matter. Air con in the living area and sat tv too.Taxi from the airport between - €25 - 30 Only one thing - no lift but only two floors so not that far to walk anyway.All in all not for a luxurious holiday but good cheap central apartments for a break in the sun. Hope this helps you Kiss*=)
kgBPU4xxaa	This is a good site for your research.

UF8qU5cGaa	The European Union is *NOT* the new name for Europe. Don't say the "European Union" unless you mean exactly those 27 out of 47 European nations! It's still called Europe.<br>  <br>  They will *have* to use local stamps to send mail to you. Stamps are like currency, they're only valid within your country. Of course there are some exceptions to this.<br>  <br>  The cost of sending mail internationally is actually part of a very complicated exchange system. The countries involved exchange an annual fee depending on who sent/received the most.<br>  <br>  Each country in Europe makes and uses it's own stamps.
