And you don't have to tell them your name.|`|e7cffc9fc3bd0766cea1490b4b51f9a8aa	Horny men do NOT rape.   ANGRY men rape.<br>  Get some help for yourself. You need it.|`|1fe7c5d1f2a7ef7c340c07a4161b1bceaa	We often desire things that are forbidden but I don't know why that is.  Perhaps I'll work this out shortly.  And sex can be such a powerful force.  For most people sex is incredibly pleasurable so I can understand why you want some.  And if you want a lot of sex on a regular basis then I can understand that as well.  Wanking is nowhere near as good.  It's a poor substitute.  And wanking probably makes you hanker even more after the real thing.  I think that it's actually cruel of nature to create something as wonderful as sex and then to make it very difficult for most men to get some, let alone enough or plenty.  Some men just seem to know exactly how to seduce a woman and so they end up ripping the knickers off a different woman every night.  But if you are anything like me then you have no idea as to how to get a woman to want you as badly as you want her.  I think that this state of affairs makes rape very tempting.  So I can understand your feelings, your urges and your fantasies.<br>  <br>  But now for a moment I think that we should look at it from a woman's point of view.  I haven't spoken at length to any rape victims so my perspective is limited but I think that rape must be a difficult and disturbing experience for all victims.  I certainly would not like to be a victim of male rape.  But because I imagine that the main thing on my mind would be the possibility of infection with HIV and the shortening of my life, I cannot seem to imagine any of the trauma associated with anal penetration with a knife at my neck.  I wonder what I would do in such a situation?  I would probably look for opportunities to fight back, but it's more than possible that there wouldn't be any such opportunities.  I imagine myself putting my underpants and trousers back on after my attacker has fled.  In my fantasy I feel depressed, low, heavy and angry and I'm very unhappy.  I get myself home, but I cannot settle.  I may even have too much to drink to dull the pain.  Perhaps I have lost some of my will to live.  Getting on with life has lost much of its joy and pleasure.  I wonder how one recovers from such a harmful experience?  Perhaps the combination of positive thinking and the passing of time will improve things?  Or perhaps professional help is needed?<br>  <br>  I think that there is no question that all women would find rape difficult, disturbing, frightening, humiliating and depressing.  And I think that as a result of an attack they might find it difficult to trust any man for a very long time, if not for the rest of their lives.  And, of course, rape of a child or of a teenager could traumatise even more deeply making it even more difficult for the victim to achieve any degree of normality in her life.<br>  <br>  So do you really want to be responsible for this much pain, humiliation, trauma, difficulty and misery?  Do you really?  Answer me honestly now.  Be true to yourself.  Search your heart and see if there really is that much badness inside of you.  I suspect that actually you are a good person who has been really hurt by some really bad life experiences.  Someone, something or a web of circumstances has conspired to label you as a bad person and your natural response to this labelling is to feel like legitimising the poisonous labels pinned on you by other people.  And one way to legitimise these poisonous labels is to do something bad, to do something very bad or to do something that is disgusting and appalling.  This need to legitimise the feelings that you are having in response to internalised poisonous labels is the cause of your fantasies, feelings and urges.<br>  <br>  So first of all remind yourself that you are a good person who would never knowingly cause any degree of devastation in another human being's life.  Then remove those poisonous labels that have been pinned on you by dysfunctional human beings from your past or your present (can you see how dysfunction gets passed from one person to another?).  Then remind yourself that you are good person and be prepared to fight for the preservation of your good name.  Don't let anyone criticise you without good reason.  And explore legitimate criticism in the sure knowledge that if your behaviour has caused problems for other people then it was because you made a legitimate mistake and not because you are in any way bad.  Let me know how it goes.<br>  <br>  Just thought that I would add something about getting a girlfriend.  I think that you need one, as most people do.  I would say make sure you have at least a small circle of friends, some male and som female.  Or your circle of friends could be larger.  Many people have a small circle of close friends and a lager circle of more casual friends.  All of these scenarios are okay.  And maybe you have some friends from mixing with people over some hobby, some club, some interest, some activity or some study.  These are all excellent ways of meeting people.  Follow your heart and spend time doing the things that you love in every available moment.  The more women there are in your life the better and if with some of these you quite close then this is good too.  But keep an open mind because love can be highly unpredictable.  One day, one of your many relationships will flourish and you will have your very own special person and she will have a special person too.<br>  <br>  Martin Camden<br>  <br>  martincamden@hotmail.com.|`|2c5182bc8199b2962ce62b981f6e81f2aa	just turn into an emo :(|`|996e8d4830410e0e968706a54a73e73baa	get help before you hurt someone, just because you feel like being violent doesn't mean its ok. call that 800 number the other person gave you and talk it out.

AA12346822	jobs in psychology depends on how far you go in school. you will need at least a masters degree to find a decent job in psychology. A doctorate in psych. you can work for yourself. I found graduate work in psych. easier than undergraduate work. Also a MSW will steer you to jobs in psych.|`|AA10611358	The classes are " hell " in nursing because nursing is an important position to fill. They try to separate the " wheat from the chaff ", regardless of the nursing shortage, because nurses do responsible and important work. If I was your father and you came to me saying, I am going to be a psychologist, instead of a nurse, I would still love you, but I would not brag to my friends about you. Nurses, especially RN's, make good money, too. A RN's starting salary can be as much as 80,000 dollars per year.|`|c49bc4899a009bc44e3110a74a3ec69aaa	Back in the day, I had a very high interest in psych to the point of wanting to be a psychologist. I had a minor interest in nursing. Most of my life I've worked in offices, and in sales which is fun, but really didn't pay the bills. Then, I decided to go back to school for nursing...I used LOGIC...nursing shortage, job stability and all  that crap... (not my heart) and got halfway thru and decided hey...this is not my bag! Some of the issues for me were that I didn't want to deal with life & death all day or people that were usually cranky, or the backbiting of nurses and docs, the liability, the mandatory OT, etc. But that's just my choice. I struggled with my ultimate decision to get out and still feel a bit of guilt, bc there is SO much pressure to be a success in that career from the eyes of others.  <br>  <br>  I had to redirect to another health field so I wouldn't waste my time/courses that I've put in already. I'm an older student and time is not on my side, so I regret not listening to my gut.<br>  <br>  You have to do what you love - logic won't keep you going in nursing bc it's a very stressful field and while I respect nurses and I have excellent grades, I found out I'm better dealing in preventive wellness - not nursing (which I found to be a bit of a downer).  You could try psych nursing, but nursing is still nursing and there IS a difference.|`|6962fa3c0df375f3a916f05e841d1e79aa	dont believe in what other people say.. see to it, the courses that you really wanted to take up is your passion. if you dont see yourself assisting sick people then dont be a nurse and if you wanted to cure people who are psychiatric insane be it! just dont rely on peoples words.. listen and feel to yourself if which is which you really wanted to become... a soon to be doctor (psychology) or assistant by the doctors (nursing). ask yourself? :)|`|s4AGdoUNaa	It is true that there are very few jobs for psych majors. If you really want to get into this field you have to at least get a master's. Most psych majors end up in jobs that have nothing to do with psychology. Now for nursing, it is a great major that is almost a guarentee job placement. I am a nurse and so many opportunities have opened for me. The pay is wonderful and you really never have to worry about finding work because every city and every state needs more nurses. It is true the classes are hard, but stick with it...it is worth it in the end.

2a150495642285dccc9f3751e93e1d28aa	lLa etapa final de la vida, conocida también como tercera edad, se inicia aproximadamente a los 60 a?os. Se caracteriza por una creciente disminución de las fuerzas físicas, lo que, a su vez, ocasiona en la mayoría una sensible y progresiva baja de las cualidades de su actividad mental.<br>  <br>  La declinación biológica se manifiesta por una creciente disminución de las capacidades sensoriales y motrices y de la fuerza física; las crecientes dificultades circulatorias, ocasionadas por el endurecimiento de las arterias; y en general, el progresivo deterioro del funcionamiento de los diversos órganos internos.<br>  <br>  El anciano va perdiendo el interés por las cosas de la vida, y viviendo cada vez más en función del pasado, el mismo que evoca constantemente, ya que el presente y el futuro le ofrecen pocas perspectivas. Por eso es predominantemente conservador y opuesto a los cambios, pues así se siente seguro.<br>  <br>  Como consecuencia de la declinación biológica, y por factores ambientales, también se van deteriorando las funciones intelectuales (inteligencia, memoria, pensamiento, etc). Pero este deterioro es muy distinto en las diversas personas, dándose el caso de ancianos de avanzada edad que se conservan en excelente forma.<br>  <br>  Los rasgos de la personalidad y del carácter se van modificando. Los ancianos que han tenido una adultez inmadura no saben adaptarse con facilidad a sus nuevas condiciones de vida. Manifiestan entonces una marcada tendencia a la desconfianza, el egoísmo, la crítica aguda (especialmente a los jóvenes) y reaccionan agriamente contra sus familiares y el ambiente social.<br>  <br>  En cambio, otros ancianos, que fueron adultos maduros, se adaptan mejor a su nueva situación y muchos hasta parecen exagerar el optimismo, buen humor y generosidad. Esto se deba a que, en el fondo, en la vejez se acentúan los rasgos que distinguieron el carácter en la adultez, por lo mismo que el individuo ya no es capaz de ejercer un completo control y dominio de sus manifestaciones psicológicas.<br>  <br>  En los individuos especialmente dotados, la ancianidad es una etapa de gran comprensión, equilibrio y productividad. Tal es el caso de personalidades ilustres que siguieron contribuyendo activamente a la vida social y cultural de su época cuando ya la mayor parte de sus coetáneos descansaban en sus cuarteles de invierno.<br>  <br>  La ancianidad es la etapa final de la vida y de be merecer el más grande respeto, consideración y protección.|`|20761bf86a0143fee79cf1a4e5d55bb3aa	en el momento mismo que te empiezas a sentir asi|`|3a83bfba37b3af17a14e9b82aa7f0070aa	La edad es mas cuestión del alma (corazón, fuerza, deseo, ganas, etcccccc.), aveces la apariencia física esta bien distorsionada de lo que es la edad, la edad tampoco creo que determine tu estado de juventud o vejes.

04881def1a778d241fb5715850d6986baa	I basically means that every action has a reaction and that everything is effected by everything else even if it is by a very small amount.  The name comes from the idea that something so small as a butterfly flapping its wings could cause a chain of events that could end in a hurricane on the other side of the world.|`|AA12360662	Movie about nothing should have happened.  Basically you are watching nothing in the movie|`|AA11539165	The butterfly effect is a phrase that encapsulates the more technical notion of sensitive dependence on initial conditions in chaos theory. Small variations of the initial condition of a dynamical system may produce large variations in the long term behavior of the system. This is sometimes presented as esoteric behavior, but can be exhibited by very simple systems: for example, a ball placed at the crest of a hill might roll into any of several valleys depending on slight differences in initial position.<br>  <br>  The phrase refers to the idea that a butterfly's wings might create tiny changes in the atmosphere that ultimately cause a tornado to appear (or, for that matter, prevent a tornado from appearing). The flapping wing represents a small change in the initial condition of the system, which causes a chain of events leading to large-scale phenomena. Had the butterfly not flapped its wings, the trajectory of the system might have been vastly different.<br>  <br>  Recurrence, the approximate return of a system towards its initial conditions, together with the sensitive dependence on initial conditions are the two main ingredients for chaotic motion. They have the practical consequence of making complex systems, such as the weather, difficult to predict past a certain time range (approximately a week in the case of weather)|`|525dd61a1446939da77158be8ba2a8a3aa	I always thought it was a bad movie with Ashton Kutcher, but now i see that there's a whole community and theory, thanks.|`|AA11970873	It refers to how everything is interconnected and an apparently small event starts an infinite chain reaction. Has to do with the balance of the universe. Not a weird theory at all if you think about how every planet's gravity is in perfect balance with the other planets to stop them colliding with each other...|`|d764eb8b1a146bc60e449a9fd267d152aa	It's to do with chaos theory. In simple terms, a small change in the input to a chaotic system can cause a huge difference to the output. The 'butterfly effect' relates this to weather, and says that a butterfly flapping it's wings will move some air, which pushes on other air and so on, and could end up making the difference as to whether a hurricane occurs somewhere else. Another way of thinking about it would be to consider a set of scales with a heavy weight on each side. If the butterfly landed on one side then it could tip the balance one way, or it could land the other side and tip it the other way. Only if the butterfly landed exactly in the middle would the scales remain balanced.<br>  <br>  Terry Pratchet wrote about a creature called something like the 'Hurricane Butterfly' in one of the Discworld books. It had evolved a defence mechanism of causing hurricanes if it was threatened/attacked.|`|f6b167a47dc56a66b7a4732d41626aeeaa	This is a really old thing.  Someone tried to explain how small events can lead to much bigger things happening.  For example, a butterfly fluttering it's wings can start off a change in air movement that could start a hurricane hundreds of miles away.

ymzYyXZMaa	La economía positiva se trata de los hechos. Se intenta decir lo que es, sin dar una opinión de si es bueno o malo. Por ejemplo, una frase de la economía positiva puede ser: Los doctores ganan más que los agricultores. Otro ejemplo de economía positiva puede ser: Un 30% de personas no pueden pagar el pasaje de un transporte colectivo.<br>  <br>  En cambio, la economía normativa se trata de lo que debe ser. Se trata de opiniones y valores las cuales pueden variar entre las personas. Por ejemplo, una frase de la economía normativa puede ser: Los doctores deben ganar más que los agricultores. Otro ejemplo puede ser: El pasaje del transporte colectivo es demasiado costoso.<br>  <br>  La diferencia entre la economía positiva y normativa es importante. En primer lugar los economistas son científicos; por lo tanto deben estudiar los fenómenos con objetividad. Al mismo tiempo, no basta con solamente la economía positiva, porque se debe aplicar los valores en cualquier campo científico. Un ejemplo de la física es: la física positiva nos instruye como construir una bomba, pero no nos va a decir que no la usemos. Esto se trata de valores.<br>  <br>  Entonces, la economía positiva y la economía normativa las podemos usar al mismo tiempo en el sentido que debemos pensar primero en los hechos para después dar una opinión inteligente, o para que estemos bien informados. Todas las preguntas o ejemplos no tienen una respuesta ni ***** ni blanco, se basan en la ética y en los valores. Por eso, debemos escuchar las opiniones de todas las personas.|`|gDLeO1C3aa	arriba tienes toda la información, suerte

Espero te haya servido mi respuesta.|`|66286d36eddaa592fd294c2ec36bd6e0aa	------------capitalismo introduccion-----<br>  <br>  Aunque las teorías sobre el capital son todas relativamente recientes, el capital, como tal, ha existido en las sociedades civilizadas desde la antigüedad. En los antiguos imperios del Lejano Oriente y del Oriente Próximo, y en mayor medida en el mundo greco-romano, se utilizaba el capital en forma de herramientas y equipos sencillos para producir tejidos, cerámica, cristalería, objetos metálicos y muchos otros productos que se vendían en los mercados internacionales. Tras la caída del Imperio romano, la desaparición del comercio en Occidente acarreó una menor especialización en la división del trabajo y redujo la utilización del capital en la producción. Las economías medievales se basaban fundamentalmente en una agricultura de subsistencia, por lo que no se las puede considerar economías capitalistas. Con las Cruzadas empezó a resurgir el comercio. Esta reaparición del comercio se aceleró a escala mundial durante el periodo de los descubrimientos y colonizaciones de finales del siglo XV. El aumento del comercio favoreció una mayor división del trabajo y una mecanización de la producción, estimulando así el crecimiento del capital. Los flujos de oro y plata provenientes del Nuevo Mundo facilitaron el intercambio y la acumulación de capital, estableciendo las bases para la Revolución Industrial, gracias a la cual los procesos productivos se alargaron, necesitando mayores aportaciones de capital. El papel del capital en las economías de Europa Occidental y América del Norte fue tan importante que la organización socioeconómica prevaleciente en estas zonas desde el siglo XVIII hasta el siglo XX se conoce como sistema capitalista o capitalismo.<br>  El CAPITALISMO.<br>  <br>  <br>  Concepto. <br>  Sistema económico en el que los individuos privados y las empresas de negocios llevan a cabo la producción y el intercambio de bienes y servicios mediante complejas transacciones en las que intervienen los precios y los mercados. Aunque tiene sus orígenes en la antigüedad, el desarrollo del capitalismo es un fenómeno europeo; fue evolucionando en distintas etapas, hasta considerarse establecido en la segunda mitad del siglo XIX. Desde Europa, y en concreto desde Inglaterra, el sistema capitalista se fue extendiendo a todo el mundo, siendo el sistema socioeconómico casi exclusivo en el ámbito mundial hasta el estallido de la I Guerra Mundial, tras la cual se estableció un nuevo sistema socioeconómico, el comunismo, que se convirtió en el opuesto al capitalista.<br>  <br>  <br>  Características Fundamentales: <br>  A lo largo de sus historia, pero sobre todo durante su auge en la segunda mitad del siglo XIX, el Capitalismo tuvo una serie de características básicas:<br>  <br>  <br>  Los medios de producción – tierra y capital- son de propiedad privada. En este contexto el capital se refiere a los edificios, la maquinaria y otras herramientas utilizadas para producir bienes y servicios destinados al consumo. <br>  <br>  La actividad económica aparece organizada y coordinada por la interacción entre compradores y vendedores (o productores) que se lleva a cabo en los mercados. <br>  <br>  Tanto los propietarios de la tierra y el capital como los trabajadores, son libres y buscan maximizar su bienestar, por lo que intentan sacar el mayor provecho posible de sus recursos y del trabajo que utilizan para producir; los consumidores pueden gastar como y cuando quieran sus ingresos para obtener la mayor satisfacción posible. Este principio que se denomina soberanía del consumidor, refleja que, en un sistema capitalista, los productores se verán obligados, debido a la competencia, a utilizar sus recursos de forma que puedan satisfacer la demanda de los consumidores; el interés personal y la búsqueda de beneficios les lleva a seguir esta estrategia. <br>  <br>  Bajo el sistema capitalista el control del sector privado por parte del público debe ser mínimo; se considera que existe competencia, la actividad económica se controlará a sí misma; la actividad del gobierno sólo es necesaria para gestionar la defensa nacional, hacer respetar la propiedad privada y garantizar el cumplimiento de los contratos. Esta visión decimonónica del papel del Estado en el sistema capitalista ha cambiado mucho durante el siglo XX. <br>  Plusvalía y Capitalismo. <br>  <br>  <br>  Pago al propietario de un factor de producción (trabajo, energía) de una cantidad inferior al valor del producto.<br>  <br>  Este término puede tener dos significados básicos: el primero es el uso de bienes materiales, normalmente con un suministro fijo, para los fines establecidos por los que se realiza su manipulación, y el segundo, más negativo, es un elemento clave de la teoría marxista sobre la lucha de clases. Esta teoría establece la teoría del valor del trabajo, que a su vez conlleva el concepto de plusvalía. Sostiene que el capitalista paga al trabajador el coste de su producción, pero recibe el precio de mercado del producto, paga costes externos (alquileres, etc.) y se embolsa el resto (la plusvalía) como ganancia. Esta idea de la plusvalía o ganancia nunca fue postulada por los economistas liberales y, en cualquier caso, parece estar en desacuerdo con la doctrina clásica del intercambio de equivalentes económicos.<br>  <br>  <br>  Crisis y Depresiones del Capitalismo. <br>  La gran crisis de fines del a?o 1929 y la profunda depresión subsiguiente marcarán, con el surgimiento del mundo comunista, un hito prominente en la historia del desarrollo económico-social de la Humanidad.<br>  <br>  a) La Gran Depresión <br>  <br>  La Gran Depresión tuvo repercusiones prácticas y teóncas.<br>  <br>  En el orden práctico, las lecciones de la crisis no hacen sino corroborar los puntos de vista anteriormente enumerados sobre las funestas consecuencias del Capitalismo de grupos antagónicos.<br>  <br>  Una vez superadas las crisis de reconversión—de una economía de guerra a una economía de producción agrícola e industrial—, las naciones, tanto europeas como, sobre todo, americana, prosperaron inauditamente.<br>  <br>  Estados Unidos, y aun Latinoamérica, proseguía y acumulaba el impulso recibido al tener que abastecer al continente europeo, sumido primero en la lucha, arruinado después, pero con deseos y necesidad de rehacerse.<br>  <br>  Poco a poco y con sobresaltos Europa se reconstruye. A partir de 1925 logra alcanzar los niveles de producción conocidos antes de la guerra.<br>  <br>  En Estados Unidos la ola de optimismo era gigantesca.<br>  <br>  Su naciente, y pronto vigorosa, industria del automóvil y maquinaría agrícola va ampliándose sin cesar, gracias a las nuevas modalidades de la producción en y de la venta a crédito. Actuando como foco impulsor, a la vez que promueve el auge de la producción agrícola, sacude en sus cimientos a las industrias básicas y a las ramas extractivas de carbón y minerales.<br>  <br>  La ola de optimismo es secundaria; viene apoyada en la precedente del mas intenso trabajo y de la difusión del poder de compra entre las clases trabajadoras.<br>  <br>  Con todo, el optimismo acabo degenerando, sobre todo en Wall Street, en ardiente especulación. Las acciones cotizadas en la Bolsa de Nueva York totalizaban, según los montos suscritos y los curves registrados, en los diversos a?os:<br>  <br>  1925 = 27.000 millones de d61ares.<br>  <br>  1929 = 89.000 millones de dolares.<br>  <br>  Donde aparece con claridad la ficticia hinchazón de los valores.<br>  <br>  Como ejemplo ilustrativo se propondrá el famoso caso "Ward", quien, deseando alzarse con la fabricación y comercio del pan en las mayores ciudades, halagaba a los propietarios de las panaderías, ofreciéndoles altísimos precios pare la compra de sus negocios. Una vez adquiridos estos, emitía acciones representativas del capital social así sobrestimado; las ofrecía en la Bolsa, y con el producto de la venta volvía a comprar y asociar al negocio nuevas panaderías a precios exagerados. Resultado: que a la vez que, ciertamente, iba monopolizando el negocio, y por lo mismo, cobrando fuerza económica, acentuaba la desproporción entre el valor nominal de las acciones, el capital social y los verdaderos activos que la empresa poseía. En tales circunstancias los dividendos repartidos no podían ser sino ficticios. La ruina futura era inevitable.<br>  <br>  Como se ve, aunque las gentes se creían, y aun eran mas ricas y ello estimulaba las compras y la producción, la prosperidad no estaba bien cimentada.<br>  <br>  Un segundo factor decisivo pare el futuro desencadenamiento de la crisis hay que reponerlo en el sector de crédito internacional.<br>  <br>  Los aliados habían impuesto a los vencidos fuertes pagos en concepto de reparación por los gas tos y destrucción de la guerra.<br>  <br>  Alemania supo jugar bien la partida. Era imprescindible que se le ayudara a reconstruirse, si se pretendía obligarla a pagar tan cuantiosas sumas. Saneada desde 1924 por el mago alemán de las finanzas, H. Schacht, la situación monetaria, los capitales extranjeros, franceses, ingleses y americanos, comienzan a fluir sobre Alemania y Austria. Los elevados tipos de interés pagados por los Bancos germanos eran un especioso atractivo. Aunque recibidos a corto plazo, esos fondos son prestados por los Bancos a la industria a largo plazo. Cuando sobrevenga la crisis, estarán ampliamente inmovilizados y será imposible el repatriarlos.<br>  <br>  Así las cosas, los primeros síntomas de malestar provinieron del sector agrícola norteamericano.<br>  <br>  Al recuperarse totalmente Europa y seguir América acumulando los impulsos recibidos, se va a crear una peligrosa situación de excedentes de producción agrícola, que no encontrara fácilmente salida en los mercados y presionara a la baja sobre los precios.<br>  <br>  Por ejemplo, en el sector azucarero, con anterioridad a la guerra, Europa y América producían por partes iguales un total de 181 millones de quintales de azúcar —de remolacha y carne—. Durante la guerra, la producción europea se reducía a 26 millones, mientras que la americana aumentaba a 132 millones. Pero pare el a?o 1928 la producción recuperada de Europa alcanzaba a 83 millones de quintales, mientras que la americana seguía creciendo hasta superar los 185 millones, más que la europea y americana conjuntamente antes de la guerra.<br>  <br>  El caso del azúcar es tan solo un indicio de lo ocurrido con otros productos agrícolas, particularmente al trigo, maíz, etc.<br>  <br>  A1 gravitar pesadamente los excedentes, sobrevino el hundimiento de los precios, el retraso en los pagos de la maquinaria comprada a crédito por parte de los agricultores, las primeras dificultades de la industria americana y de sus Bancos.<br>  <br>  A1 querer estos sostenerse con la repatriación de fondos desde Europa, pusieron en aprieto a los Bancos alemanes. Fueron precisamente las demandas de retiro de fondos las que, provocando la quiebra de la poderosa institución del "Creditanstalt", de Viena, desencadenaron la ola mundial de pánico. Los Bancos americanos, queriendo anticiparse unos a otros en la repatriación de capitales, agudizaron la crisis y obligaron a Alemania a decretar la moratoria bancaria.<br>  <br>  El edificio de la prosperidad se venia abajo.<br>  <br>  La especulación jugo entonces a la baja y las cotizaciones en Wall Street se hundieron en el abismo. Las acciones totalizaron en:<br>  <br>  1932 = 15.663 millones de $, contra los 89.000 de 1929.<br>  <br>  La caída arruinó a los que antes se creían ricos, empezó a frenar las compras y acabó arrastrando tras sí a todos los precios: los industriales al por mayor bajaron en un 32 por 100; los agrícolas lo habían hecho en un 54 por 100.<br>  <br>  E1 frenazo consiguientemente experimentado por la producción industrial trajo como consecuencia inevitable la reducción de sueldos y salarios en un 40 por 100, aun pare el personal ocupado.<br>  <br>  Pero, sobre todo, el paro obrero forzoso alcanzo niveles anormales y extraordinarios. En los a?os peores se contaron en EE. UU. hasta catorce millones de obreros parados. De 1931 a 1940 hubo siempre, por lo menos, siete millones de obreros sin trabajo.<br>  <br>  Como Norteamérica había empezado a ser ya la potencia económica dominante, la crisis se propagó a todo el mundo. La producción global alemana se redujo en un 40 por 100; sus exportaciones lo hicieron en un 50 por 100. En Inglaterra los obreros parados pasaron de los cuatro millones.<br>  <br>  Nada tiene de extra?o que, en estas circunstancias, germinara en la mente de Lord Maynard Keynes la Teoría General del Empleo, del Interés y de la Moneda. Libro publicado en 1936, que iba a reorientar la Teoría Económica.<br>  <br>  Esos graves hechos explican igualmente los anhelos por una seguridad social total, que culminaron en el informe de Sir W. Beveridge y en el programa implantado después de la segunda guerra mundial por el partido laborista ingles.<br>  <br>  Pleno Empleo, Seguridad Social, Nacionalización de las Empresas, Participación obrera en la Gestión, Intervención económica del Estado, fueron tópicos socorridos en la inmediata postguerra.<br>  <br>  b) El Comunismo. <br>  <br>  Paralelamente con esta evolución del mundo occidental había seguido su curso azaroso y sobresaltado la revolución rusa.<br>  <br>  Será verdad que la implantación del comunismo en los diversos países ha desmentido las previsiones marxistas de una revolución proletaria en un mundo capitalista de intensa concentración industrial; será cierto que los conductores soviéticos, dando muestras de realismo político, a veces feroz, han abandonado, o atemperado a las circunstancias y conveniencias la ortodoxia marxista; podremos quizás esperar o anhelar que los mismos éxitos logrados induzcan en los dirigentes un mayor sentido de responsabilidad y moderación ante la necesaria salvaguarda de la obra realizada: es verosímil que la paulatina mejora de las condiciones materiales de vida del pueblo ruso despierte en vasto s sectores de sus cuadros intermedios una mayor ansia de libertad; habrá quien vislumbre en el horizonte del futuro el probable definitivo fracaso de un sistema absorbente, centralizador, despótico; todos deberían recriminar la perversión de una ideología filosófico-religiosa falsa y antihumana, etc. Pero, mientras tanto, quedará como hecho histórico alucinante, de trascendental significación para el curso de la humanidad la aparición del Comunismo en Rusia, su atormentada consolidación en el país soviético y la forzada y oportunista propagación en más de la mitad del mundo.<br>  <br>  Cuatro estadios se pueden se?alar en la evolución del comunismo:<br>  <br>  <br>  E1 periodo revolucionario y de comunismo radical de la llamada guerra civil. Momentos de conquista audaz del poder y primer asentamiento. <br>  <br>  El periodo transitorio de la Nueva Política Económica; en un cierto sentido de marcha atrás, por acomodación a las imperiosas exigencias de fomento de la producción y atención al descontento campesino . <br>  <br>  E1 lapso mas duradero y decisivo de la construcción del Socialismo, con la elaboración, puesta en marcha y realizaciones de los planes quinquenales, que pretendieron colectivizar la agricultura y lograron sentar las bases de la industria pesada soviética. <br>  <br>  Los tiempos ulteriores y recientes de creciente expansión externa hacia China y democracias populares europeas. A una con el afianzamiento interno ruso, por prudente atemperamiento a la cambiante evolución, se ha operado en el bloque comunista una evidente escisión. <br>  A través de esos cuatro estadios un resultado queda patente. Y es, el del abierto desafío lanzado por el Comunismo contra el Sistema Capitalista.<br>  <br>  Aunque sin dar del todo crédito a los datos estadísticos, ni aceptar siquiera la estricta comparabilidad de las cifras, nos parece que es un triunfo innegable de los dirigentes comunistas el que en la esfera de la producción se vayan acercando a los volúmenes y tasas de crecimiento occidentales.<br>  <br>  Pero, sin duda, han sido más efectivos sus logros en la esfera de la distribución, en la nivelación de las fortunas, desmantelamiento de arcaicas estructuras sociales y proporción de igualdad de oportunidades para todos.<br>  <br>  No tiene por que arredrarnos el reconocimiento de que unos cuantos a?os de vandalismo comunista, aunque haya sido, o sea, devastador su paso, puede dejar despejado el terreno para la apertura de nuevos caminos.<br>  <br>  c) La Situación actual de los dos bloques contrapuestos.<br>  <br>  Quizás sea una de las mas faustas consecuencias de la aparición y afianzamiento del Comunismo, la reacción provocada en el sistema capitalista contrapuesto.<br>  <br>  El mundo occidental esta despertando. Asistimos a un rejuvenecimiento y a una transformación del sistema capitalista. Es notorio el vigor, siempre renovado en la eficacia productiva, del capitalismo americano. Resulta todavía mas esperanzador el proceso creativo del capitalismo europeo, mas abierto a las necesarias reformas sociales.<br>  <br>  Comunismo y Capitalismo se hallan hoy día frente a frente.<br>  <br>  Personalmente opinamos que el Capitalismo, o continua y acelera el proceso de interna renovación, superando viejas concepciones, o sucumbe ante el ímpetu del adversario.<br>  <br>  Así mismo el Comunismo, que en sus etapas iniciales puede ofrecer evidentes éxitos, por la implantación de un férreo Capitalismo de Estado, forzosamente ha de degenerar, y a la larga no será lo suficientemente eficaz como para asegurar permanentemente una adecuada y justa distribución de la riqueza.<br>  <br>  Frente a ambos sistemas, capitalista y comunista, se alzan, como tierras de conquista y promisión, las vastas extensiones del sudeste asiático, de los continentes africano y latinoamericano.<br>  <br>  En este tercer campo de lucha intermedio debe dirimirse la gran contienda, si no queremos asistir a la conformación de un capitalismo de naciones ricas y un proletariado de naciones pobres.<br>  <br>  Las profundas desigualdades sociales, asentadas en vetustas estructuras y que dan como resultado la miserable condición de vida de las clases populares, hacen de esos continentes campo abonado para el Comunismo.<br>  <br>  Pero también, al contrario, en ese ámbito del mundo subdesarrollado podría encontrar el sistema capitalista un terreno de misión y de obra redentora. Redentora de esos pueblos y de sus propios vicios. Salvando a esos mundos, el Capitalismo se salvara a sí mismo y desbaratara la permanente amenaza del Comunismo.<br>  <br>  <br>  EL IMPERIALISMO.<br>  <br>  <br>  Concepto. <br>  Práctica de dominación empleada por las naciones o pueblos poderosos para ampliar y mantener su control o influencia sobre naciones o pueblos más débiles; aunque algunos especialistas suelen utilizar este término de forma más específica para referirse únicamente a la expansión económica de los estados capitalistas, otros eruditos lo reservan para caracterizar la expansión de Europa que tuvo lugar después de 1870. Aunque las voces imperialismo y colonialismo tienen un significado similar y pueden aplicarse indistintamente en algunas ocasiones, conviene establecer ciertas diferencias entre ellas. El colonialismo, por lo general, implica un control político oficial que supone la anexión territorial y la pérdida de la soberanía del país colonizado. El imperialismo, sin embargo, tiene un sentido más amplio que remite al control o influencia ejercido sobre otra región, sea o no de forma oficial y directa, e independientemente de que afecte al terreno económico o político.<br>  <br>  Origen y Desarrollo. <br>  El origen del imperialismo se remonta a la antigüedad y ha adoptado distintos modelos a lo largo de la historia, siendo algunos de ellos más frecuentes que otros dentro de un periodo histórico concreto. En el mundo antiguo la práctica del imperialismo daba como resultado una serie de grandes imperios que surgían cuando un pueblo, que generalmente representaba a una determinada civilización y religión, intentaba dominar a todos los demás creando un sistema de control unificado. El imperio de Alejandro Magno y el Imperio romano son destacados ejemplos de esta modalidad. <br>  <br>  Por el contrario, el imperialismo europeo de comienzos de la era moderna (1400-1750) se caracterizaba por ser una expansión colonial en territorios de ultramar. No se trataba de un país que intentaba unificar el mundo sino de muchas naciones que competían por establecer su control sobre el sur y sureste de Asia y el continente americano. Los sistemas imperialistas se estructuraron de acuerdo con la doctrina del mercantilismo: cada metrópoli procuraba controlar el comercio de sus colonias para monopolizar los beneficios obtenidos.<br>  <br>  A mediados del siglo XIX apareció otra variante, el imperialismo del librecambio. Esta modalidad perduró en este periodo pese a que el mercantilismo y la creación de imperios oficiales estaba disminuyendo de forma significativa. El poder y la influencia de Europa, y sobre todo de Gran Breta?a, se habían extendido de manera oficiosa, esto es, haciendo uso de vías diplomáticas y medios económicos, en lugar de seguir canales oficiales como la creación de colonias. Sin embargo, el imperialismo basado en el librecambio desapareció pronto: hacia finales del siglo XIX las potencias europeas habían vuelto a practicar el imperialismo consistente en la anexión territorial, expandiéndose en áfrica, Asia y el Pacífico.<br>  <br>  Desde que terminó la II Guerra Mundial y la mayoría de los imperios reconocidos se disolvieron, ha prevalecido lo que podríamos calificar como el moderno imperialismo económico, donde el dominio no se manifiesta de manera oficial. Por ejemplo, Estados Unidos ejerce un considerable control sobre determinadas naciones del Tercer Mundo debido a su poder económico y su influencia en algunas organizaciones financieras internacionales, tales como el Banco Mundial y el Fondo Monetario Internacional (FMI). Del mismo modo, las potencias europeas han seguido interviniendo de forma significativa en la vida política y económica de sus antiguas colonias, por lo que han sido acusadas de practicar el neocolonialismo, que consiste en ejercer la soberanía de una nación sin que exista un gobierno colonial oficial.<br>  <br>  3 Justificaciones del imperialismo <br>  <br>  Las razones por las cuales los estados han aspirado a crear imperios a lo largo de la historia son de diversa índole, y podrían clasificarse, en términos generales, dentro de tres grupos: económicas, políticas e ideológicas. Asimismo, pueden distinguirse diversas teorías en razón del elemento al que se dé más relevancia.<br>  <br>  Los móviles económicos <br>  <br>  Los intereses económicos son los más habituales cuando se trata de explicar este fenómeno. Los defensores de esta concepción sostienen que las naciones se ven impelidas a dominar a otras para expandir su economía, adquirir materias primas y mano de obra, o para dar salida a los excedentes del capital y producción. La teoría más notable que vincula el imperialismo con el capitalismo es la de Karl Marx. Lenin, por ejemplo, consideraba que la expansión europea del siglo XIX era la consecuencia inevitable de la necesidad de las economías capitalistas europeas de exportar su excedente de capital. Del mismo modo, los marxistas contemporáneos explican la expansión de Estados Unidos en el Tercer Mundo basándose en imperativos económicos.<br>  <br>  Los móviles políticos <br>  <br>  Otros autores hacen hincapié en los condicionantes políticos y alegan que la razón principal por la que los estados tienden a expandirse es el deseo de poder, prestigio, seguridad y ventajas diplomáticas con respecto a otros estados. Según esta corriente, el objetivo del imperialismo francés del siglo XIX era recuperar el prestigio internacional de Francia después de la humillación que supuso la derrota en la Guerra Franco-prusiana. En este mismo sentido, la expansión de la Unión de Repúblicas Socialistas Soviéticas (URSS) en la Europa del Este a partir de 1945 puede explicarse como una medida de seguridad: la necesidad de protegerse ante otra posible invasión desde la frontera occidental.<br>  <br>  Los móviles ideológicos <br>  <br>  La tercera explicación se centra en los móviles ideológicos o morales. De acuerdo con esta perspectiva, algunos países se ven impulsados a extender su influencia para difundir sus valores políticos, culturales o religiosos. Uno de los factores que propiciaron la constitución del Imperio Británico fue la idea de que era responsabilidad del ‘hombre blanco’ civilizar a los pueblos ‘atrasados’. La expansión alemana que tuvo lugar durante el gobierno de Adolf Hitler se basaba en gran medida en la creencia en la superioridad inherente a la cultura alemana. El deseo de Estados Unidos de "proteger al mundo libre" y el interés de la antigua Unión Soviética por "liberar" a los pueblos de la Europa del Este y del Tercer Mundo son también un ejemplo de este tipo de imperialismo.<br>  <br>  El imperialismo como respuesta a condicionantes externos <br>  <br>  Por último, otras teorías explican el imperialismo basándose en las circunstancias políticas de las naciones más débiles, en lugar de enfatizar los móviles de las naciones poderosas. La interpretación que ofrecen se?ala que es posible que las potencias más fuertes no tengan intención de expandirse, pero que se ven obligadas a hacerlo debido a la inestabilidad de otras naciones; los compromisos con los imperios del pasado son la causa de nuevas acciones imperialistas. La conquista de la India emprendida por Gran Breta?a y la colonización rusa de Asia central en el siglo XIX son ejemplos clásicos de este tipo de imperialismo.<br>  <br>  4. Las Consecuencias del Imperialismo <br>  <br>  Los efectos del imperialismo suelen girar en torno a los aspectos económicos, dado que esta perspectiva es la que prevalece en los debates sobre sus posibles móviles. La polémica surge entre aquéllos que creen que el imperialismo implica explotación y es la causa del subdesarrollo y el estancamiento económico de las naciones pobres, y los que alegan que, pese a las ventajas que proporcionó esta situación a las naciones ricas, también las naciones pobres se beneficiaron, al menos a largo plazo. Es difícil decantarse por una u otra concepción por dos motivos: de un lado, no se ha llegado a un consenso sobre el sentido del término explotación; y de otro, no es fácil separar las causas internas de la pobreza de una nación de las que son de índole internacional. Lo que resulta evidente es que el efecto del imperialismo ha sido desigual: unas naciones han obtenido mayores ventajas económicas que otras de su contacto con potencias más ricas. India, Brasil y otros países en vías de desarrollo incluso han comenzado a competir económicamente con sus antiguas metrópolis. Por ello, sería aconsejable examinar la repercusión económica del imperialismo atendiendo a cada caso en particular.<br>  <br>  Las consecuencias políticas y psicológicas del imperialismo son igualmente difíciles de determinar. Este fenómeno ha demostrado ser destructivo y creativo a la vez: ha destruido instituciones tradicionales y formas de pensar, y las ha sustituido por las costumbres y mentalidad del mundo occidental, ya se considere esto un beneficio o un perjuicio.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  .|`|SSBBR3yQaa	a grandes razgos<br>  existio en ese momento un problema porque los paises europeos despues de la primera guerra mundial no tenian dinero para ser consumidores grandes, tenian que pagar da?os de guerra, reparaciones y sanciones.<br>  <br>  estos pagos hicieron que los paises europeos tuvieran que emitir billetes (por asi decirlo) para cubrir dichos gastos, lo cual a  la larga provoca inflacion y aumento de precios.<br>  <br>  pero eso no es todo, estados unidos habia seguido con su produccion altisima por a?os, asi que cuando se saturo su mercado y el mercado internacional no podia absorver su oferta de productos no pudo continuar con sus tasas de gasnancia. y por el contrario empezaron a perder por que no habia quien comprara y todo estaba caro<br>  <br>  es decir fue una crisis en cierto modo ciclica, porque cuando hay periodos de alza, en algun momento habra periodos de baja<br>  este fue un caso de recesion, pero agudizado por la inflacion, los efectos post guerra, falata de ahorro, y exeso de productos en el mercado que no se iban a poder comprar.<br>  esto trajo como resultado el crack de 1929<br>  y mucho desempleo, lo cual marco el fin de un periodo de bonanza y de libre mercado<br>  para salir de este proceso se reucrrio a la teoria (en ese entonces iniciaba) de que el estado ante periodos de crisis tiene que intervenir para ajustar la economia y ayudar a los actores productivos y a la sociedad.<br>  <br>  basicamente fue eso<br>  saludos|`|PNc8tw2faa	Las cotizaciones de las acciones de las empresas subieron por la posibilidad de ontener ganancias especulativas, cuando llegó el punto más alto de cotizaciones, la realidad de las ventas de las empresas no respaldaron esas expectativas, se presentó el pánico y al querer vender todos y no existir compradores, el precio de las acciones legó a ser más bajo que el papel en el que estaban impresas, quedando en quiebra millonarios en el lapso de unas horas.<br>  Se presentaron suicidios y se paralizó la economía, dandose la quiebra de empresas y desempleo.

f37041135ac7ba0f643b90e148068b43aa	Aportaciones de la teoría de Nash a la economia<br>  <br>  No debería sorprender que la Teoría de Juegos haya encontrado aplicaciones directas en economía. Esta triste ciencia se supone que se ocupa de la distribución de recursos escasos. Si los recursos son escasos es porque hay más gente que los quiere de la que puede llegar a tenerlos. Este panorama proporciona todos los ingredientes necesarios para un juego. Además, los economistas neoclásicos adoptaron el supuesto de que la gente actuará racionalmente en este juego. En un sentido, por tanto, la economía neoclásica no es sino una rama de la Teoría de Juegos. Los economistas que no se dan cuenta de ello son como el monsieur Jourdain de Le Bourgeois Gentilhomme, de Moliere, que se sorprendió de saber que había estado hablando en prosa durante toda la vida sin saberlo. Sin embargo, aunque los economistas pueden haber sido desde siempre especialistas camuflados en Teoría de Juegos, no podían progresar por el hecho de no tener acceso a los instrumentos proporcionados por Von Neumann y Morgenstern. En consecuencia sólo podían analizar juegos particularmente simples. Esto explica por qué el monopolio y la competencia perfecta se entienden bien, mientras a todas las demás variedades de competencia imperfecta que se dan entre estos dos extremos sólo ahora se les está empezando a dar el tratamiento detallado que merecen.<br>  La razón por la que el monopolio es simple desde el punto de vista de la Teoría de Juegos es que puede ser tratado como un juego con un único jugador. La razón por que la competencia perfecta es simple es que el número de jugadores es de hecho infinito, de manera que cada agente individual no puede tener un efecto sobre agregados de mercado si el o ella actúa individualmente.|`|gDLeO1C3aa	<a href="http://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/Teor%C3%ADa_de_Juegos" rel="nofollow">http://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/Teor%C3%ADa...</a>|`|5d2c64f9d19dce846c0c91243616d9efaa	Lamentablemente, la teoría de los juegos de Nash, ha tenido poco impacto en la economía, no por que no sea brillante, porque LO ES, sino por otro motivo que obedece a intereses:<br>  La teoría de los juegos, por la cual Nash obtuvo el Nóbel de Economia, demostró que la que se venía aplicando, LA DEL PADRE DE LA ECONOM?A Adam Smith, estaba equivocada.<br>  O sea, se desvanecía más de un siglo y medio de teoría económica, y con ella, se hubieran desvanecido los monopolios y los grupos de poder, los poderosos think tanks internacionales, y con esto el famoso Nuevo Orden Mundial, planificado desde hace mucho tiempo por la sociedad petrolero financiera anglo norteamericana.<br>  Nash fue literalmente barrido a un costado de la escena.<br>  Prácticamente ningún estudiante de economía conoce más que escuetísimas referencias a esta teoría. Se sigue impartiendo la teoría que estaba equivocada, sólo por ser la más conveniente a una elite del planeta.<br>  Los datos están excelentemente detallados en el libro Hitler ganó la guerra de Walter Graziano, economista por cierto, a quien le sorprendió enterarse de esta noticia a través de una peli de Hollywood (Una mente brillante) en lugar de hacerlo por sus estudios, y por lo cual comenzó un minucioso rally investigativo, que culminó en la publicación de su libro, imperdible, por cierto.<br>  Saludos.

oDpwQjdpaa	it really does sound like a ghost problem to me it sounds like there trying to get your attention about something ive had something like this happen to me before.. when me and my gf first got together i had given her a mood cross necklace and she had spent the night and when she fell asleep she had it on and then when she woke up it was gone my completely cleaned out my room and pulled up the carpet and pulled off the bottom molding on my wall and it was nowhere to be foundbut the chain was still on her neck and it hadnt been broken off it was creepy and we have been together 2 years now and i still have the same room and we have yet to find it ..it like vanished but yeah it seems like a ghost to me...try sitting in your room at night in complete darkness and quiet and watch for very dim white figures or coldness thats what me and my gf do and we have experienced paranormal activity and we think my grandmas ghost may be in our house because she died six weeks after i was born and my mother said i didnt sleep through the night until she died and i had never seen a picture of her ever before and one night i saw a figure of a woman standing at the foot of my bed and i could see her face and i described it to my mother and she said it was my grandma and showed me a picture and it was her......also try getting a video camera that has a heat sensor on it and set it up in your room at night and sleep in a diff room and look at the tapes the next day... that should help solve anything|`|AA10643551	someone is toying you|`|IHKovEwqaa	lmao - omg, this happens to me all the time!!<br>  one day i was in the bathroom doing my hair & i swear that i remember putting my brush on the sink. i went in my room to grab my hair tie, then when i got back in the bathroom, my brush was gone!! i was franticly looking all over the place & i couldnt find it anywhere. i was so pissed off because i was the only person in the house & i was 100% POSITIVE that i put it on that sink. okay, now after a while i gave up looking & when to get something to drink. so i go back in the bathroom to turn the light out & my brush is sitting right on the back of the toilet!!<br>  i told my mom what happened because this definitely isnt the 1st time that this happened to me. but she told to me that it was simply absentmindedness.<br>  sometimes people are distracted by other things and completely forget where they put something else or accidentally misplace it. people also get so frustrated with looking for what ever it is that they're looking for, & their mind bypasses the object like 2 or 3 times before they realize its there. but i usually find what im looking for after a while [even if it isnt in the place i left it]. & there's a 1 out of 500,000 chance that there's a ghost stealing your scarf & moving your remote lol. so dont be too alarmed, just try to put thing in plain sight before you take your eyes off of them.

Es tiempo de gran actividad comercial e intercambio de regalos, reuniones y comidas familiares. En Occidente se celebra la Misa del gallo en iglesias y catedrales. En los países de América Latina, de arraigada tradición católica, se celebra especialmente la Nochebuena (24 de diciembre) con una cena familiar para la que se elaboran una diversidad de platos, postres y bebidas tradicionales. También se acostumbra asistir a la Misa del gallo y celebrar con cohetes y fuegos artificiales. En México, la Nochebuena constituye la culminación de una celebración que dura nueve días a la que se llama "las posadas". éstas empiezan el 16 de diciembre y conmemoran el viaje de María y José en su búsqueda de alojamiento antes del nacimiento de Jesús.<br>  <br>  En el siglo II de nuestra era (100 a?os después del nacimiento de Cristo), los cristianos sólo conmemoraban la Pascua de Resurrección, ya que consideraban irrelevante el momento del nacimiento de Jesús y, además, desconocían absolutamente cuándo pudo haber acontecido.<br>  <br>  Durante los siglos siguientes, al comenzar a aflorar el deseo de celebrar el natalicio de Jesús de una forma clara y diferenciada, algunos teólogos, basándose en los textos de los Evangelios, propusieron datarlo en fechas tan dispares como el 6 y 10 de enero, el 25 de marzo, el 15 y 20 de abril, el 20 y 25 de mayo y algunas otras. Pero el papa Fabián (236-250) decidió cortar por lo sano tanta especulación y calificó de sacrílegos a quienes intentaron determinar la fecha del nacimiento del nazareno.

Algunas culturas creían que el dios del sol nació el 21 de diciembre, el día más corto del a?o, y que los días se hacían más largos a medida que el dios se hacía más viejo. En otras culturas se creía que el dios del sol murió ese día, sólo para volver a otro ciclo.<br>  <br>  Los romanos celebraban el 25 de diciembre la fiesta del "Natalis Solis Invicti" o "Nacimiento del Sol invicto". Asociada al nacimiento de Apolo. El 25 de diciembre fue considerado como día del solsticio de invierno, y que los romanos llamaron bruma; cuando Julio César introdujo su calendario en el a?o 45 a.C., el 25 de diciembre debió ubicarse entre el 21 y 22 de diciembre de nuestro Calendario Gregoriano. De esta fiesta, los primeros cristianos tomaron la idea del 25 de diciembre como fecha del nacimiento de Jesucristo. Otro festival romano llamado Saturnalia, en honor a Saturno, duraba cerca de siete días e incluía el solsticio de invierno. Por esta celebración los romanos posponían todos los negocios y guerras, había intercambio de regalos, y liberaban temporalmente a sus esclavos. Tales tradiciones se asemejan a las actuales tradiciones de Navidad y se utilizan para establecer un acoplamiento entre los dos días de fiesta.<br>  <br>  <br>  P.D: Ultra fanáticos religiosos, votadme negativo!!! xD|`|Ux4xAb0taa	en realidad es por el nacimiento del sol en una cultura que no recuerdo, no es el nacimiento de jesus, es mas, jesus no nacio el 24  de diciembre|`|Yq50OFeXaa	La Vida nesesita de emociones,|`|ldMdt5qUaa	aunq a veces nos compartamos mal ese dia en q se supone es de union lo que da los regalos y los adornos es ilusion y eso tambien se valora mucho porque cuanta gente hay en el mundo sin ilusiones???  <br>  aunq no lo creas la mercadotecnia tambien tiene su lado positivo en navidad?  <br>  porque que es de un hombre sin ilusiones ....nada es alguien muerto

De hecho esto ha sucedido muchas veces, por ejemplo durante los 70 cuando los países productores de petróleo redujeron la oferta e hicieron aumentar el precio del energético.

Do this till he stops being a jerk, and realizes that he needs mental attention, i mean SERIOUS ONE..<br>  <br>  Really this is what i would do if i were in your position NOT BECAUSE I AM EVIL OR SIMILAR TO THE OTHER BLOKE, BUT BECAUSE I AM MUCH MUCH BETTER THAN HIM..

He sounds scared through being dumped or unrequited love etc.... sad|`|hTpsZ0Bsaa	I'm afraid that there could be many reasons why he is acting the way he is, I'm going to base my answer on my own experiences as I have Aspergers syndrome which is a learning disorder and I know for a fact that having a disorder can make you socially isolated, maybe this guy feels that no one understands him and is acting the way he is to get attention or as maybe he doesn't know how to show he's feelings and it is causing him to become frustrated and angry and maybe he doesn't know how to control his anger so it's making him bottle it up until his anger/frustration overflows.<br>  <br>  I expect you know what it's like to have a mental condition so maybe is someway you could find a way to understand this man, although I expect he is making you angry/frustrated/stressed but try not to let it get to you, try to reason with him as best you can, if you are unable to do that then I suggest you should talk to specialists and maybe they can help you.<br>  <br>  I hope this answer has helped you in someway, if you have any problems or questions just say, have a good day :) :) :) :)
cWxwHMQWaa	If I'm stressed out, little things can really get to me, hardcore. <br>  <br>  For the most part I think I'm pretty decent at not getting too psycho without just cause, but I have a pretty crazy temper and some times it just takes over me O_O haha<br>  <br>  That said, I'm a pretty emotional sorta person, don't really think it has anything to do with being a girl, but if people wanna blame it on the vagina, eh. Little things can trigger a huge reaction, this happens to me from time to time. I cope & deal, so do the people around me, they know it's part of how I am and have always been this way really. <br>  <br>  Age has calmed me down and evened me out a lot, but I'm still pretty nuts, and I'm fine with that <3<br>  <br>  But I never get upset over nothing just for the sake of drama queening it out, yanno? That's totally fucktarded to me. There's enough real things to be upset over, why make **** up? I don't have any patience for people who do that, and gotta say, it's not just women who go all DQ just for the **** of it. Crazy doesn't care what in your pants, equal opportunity offenders, great innit? ^5|`|WKtakdsOaa	I cant really say I get anything like that.

I'm a pretty laid-back, optimistic person by nature, but when that time goes around I start getting all teary and taking everything the wrong way.  The upside is that I recognise this is all because of my hormones and so I don't act on them or take it out on other people.  I still feel upset, but I can usually tell myself that it's over nothing and it passes much quicker.<br>  <br>  I do, however, think applying this only to women is a little unfair.  I've known just as many guys who become tempermental in exactly the way you're describing throughout my life from time to time.  I think the main reason this is typically applied only to women is because popular opinion has us pinned as "hyper-sensitive" because of the havoc our hormones wreck on us, which is more sensationalised, even though men can act the same way just as often.  I think we've just been called "over emotional" so much it's accepted as gospel after all these years.<br>  <br>  Not wagging a finger at you in any way -- I just felt like commenting.|`|9VAnsWYUaa	'overanalyzes things, reads too much into things and gets upset over nothing, knowing that it is nothing but still feeling upset and annoyed just the same.' - You just described a teenage boy/girl perfectly.|`|bb06GQ5Paa	Yep!  And it's coming, too.  I can usually feel it coming on so if something relatively insignificant makes me want to declare all out war over it, then 95% of the time, I'll step back and practice some restraint.  First, I'll get depressed for like a day or so and I'll wake up sad.  Then I'll realize, Oh, that's right, it's about that time.  By the next day, round about, I'll be really tired and sleepy for a few days.  Then, I'll eat like a pig for a day.  Then I'll get really horny and then Aunt Flo comes to visit.  And during the entire time, I feel like I could strangle 10 people.<br>  <br>  <br>  EDIT - And I totally agree with the lady above.  Men act as if we are the only ones who get moody especially during our periods.  My ex used to get in these moods and when I finally get what's wrong out of him, it was always something like, this man cut me off on the freeway, or you didn't fill the brita pitcher up, or I stubbed my toe.  Big baby.  Look, our hormones are bouncing off the walls, what's y'all's excuse?<br>  <br>  LOL, yeah, let's make it 15.   What the hell, 20 for good measure!
9EVcTnUWaa	As the parent of three children Whom I have a basically close relationship with, I do and did understand my children when they were and are young.  Also now that two of them are adults and the youngest a teenager.  I'm not saying that we don't have disagreements but we understand each other.  A teenager  is so distracted by the changes going on in thier lives that they don't have the time and the maturity to understand that their parents did go through the same things.  Granted my parents didn't have to deal with the lure of drugs as I did (I grew up in the 60 and 70's)  But they had to deal with the effects of the depression and the war. That placed stress on them and made them question themselves as have hundreds of generations of teens before them.  Adolescence is a time of questioning themselves and doubts are a part of that.  It's a time of pulling away from your parents and trying to establish your own identity that means questioning if you want the same things as your parents and wondering sometimes if you're even part of the same planet they are.  You'll understand your parents if you talk to them, ask them about what it was like when they were growing up at your age.  Talk to them about what's going on in your life and trust that they will understand and be able to help you deal with it.|`|Ch39oU58aa	you can't understand your parents because you don't have the wisdom that they do.

Who, better than parents, would understand them.  The problem is the children don't want to understand them.  And really, they don't want to understand anything from anyone.  Why?  Because they're young and full of fire & ice.  God bless them and God help us all.|`|AA11280073	It takes time and maturity to have the same point of view as your parents.
AHJZeo8Oaa	Too many to mention.  Backlash by Susan Faludi is brilliant (but quite long).  Everyday Acts of Outrageous Rebellion by Gloria Steinham is a great document of 2nd wave feminism, and will make you cry and laugh alternatively.  The Feminine Mystique by Betty Friedan is great for understanding the lives our mothers and grandmothers probably knew very well.  Marriage as a Trade by Cicely Hamilion is superb Sufragette writing, and still a pleasure to read 100 years on.  And finally, if you want to hurt your brain with feminism, read Feminist Political Theory by Valerie Bryson, one of the single best books on feminism I have ever read.  Happy reading!  :-)|`|FUIBscKGaa	The Mists of Avalon.  It's the retelling of the King Author stories from the female characters perspective, and the only book I can read over and over.<br>  <br>  I also love The Red Tent.  It's about Dinah, who is mentioned in the Bible very briefly, as having been raped.  It's another retelling from the female perspective, and in the book, Dinah wasn't raped.  Instead, she was in love with the prince, and her brothers lied and said it was rape, and used it as an excuse to kill him.  <br>  <br>  Dune is another favorite, as well as a long list of other sci fi.  That's probably my favorite genre, but I read everything I can get my hands on.  I just love books.|`|3ggolLgQaa	Prison Writings- Written by a Feminist man called "Abdullah Ocalan" he formed a group called PJAK (You can google) and its women who are fighting for the independance of their country "KURDISTAN" because Abduallah Ocalan believes women are true fighters and have truely strong wills.<br>  He is famously known for saying "I killed the man in me" and by that he means the egotistical, sex driven oppressingly dominant man.<br>  <br>  His book is called "Prison writings"<br>  He was imprisoned by the Turkish government and has been in solitary confinement for 10 years.<br>  <br>  This is why Nelson Mandela rejected the "Ataturk peace prize" and refused to visit Turkey. He said he will not go to Turkey until they release Ocalan and stop oppressing the Kurdish nation. Ocalan and Mandela have had the same fate.<br>  <br>  <br>  "Shes a slut, his a stud and 49 other double standards every woman should know about" - I have not read this but the I am going to read it cause I love the title lol<br>  <br>  Also my favourite book of ALL time is <br>  <br>  "Phoolan Devi India's bandit queen" - its about a poor, low caste family who are mistreated daily, and the girl Phoolan is raped and taken advantage of my numerous men just beacause she is poor and does not have a strong male to look after her. She becomes a Bandit, forms a group and lives in the jungle with this group of bandits. They are all men and they respect and follow her. She becomes a very skilled fighter and steals from the rich, gives to the poor.<br>  Also I love the scenes when she takes revenage on the men who raped her. She cuts their penis off and its .... SO wow.<br>  This book is amazing!|`|1suTgWGoaa	“I also love a Feminist man called "Abdullah Ocalan" he formed a group called PJAK (You can google) and its women who are fighting for the independance of their country "KURDISTAN" because Abduallah Ocalan believes women are true fighters and have truely strong wills.<br>  He is famously known for saying "I killed the man in me" ….”<br>  <br>  Do you think it works if I say to my GF:<br>  <br>  "I killed the man in me" SO go to work?|`|c77cjTOeaa	Fiction or nonfiction?

It' just really good.<br>  <br>  Other favorites would include anything written by Chuck Palahniuk, because he's crazy in the best way, all books by Terry Pratchett, because he's hilarious, select stuff from Francesca Lia Block, because her writing is like gorgeous poetry, and Laurell K. Hamilton, because there's nothing like sexy fairies (her Meredith Gentry series).<br>  <br>  Also, if you're looking for something very feministy (although "Mists Of Avalon" is as well), you should read Judith Tarr's White Mare series.  It utterly fascinated me when I read it.|`|84gK4XlHaa	Pride and Prejudice because I'm a closet romantic.

RCpkdx4haa	Get as far away from him as possible. He cried because he was rejected, not because he cared that you were leaving. Him being abusive means he's insecure and thought he could MAKE you stay. He will learn from you leaving that this, in fact, is not true. Going back to him will make you miserable, because he will then KNOW that he can do whatever he wants to you/with you and you won't leave. DO NOT fall into his traps. Think for yourself. Not with your emotions.|`|4B9Ve1LSaa	First and foremost you did the right thing by leaving.  Take pride in the fact that you had the courage to do so, as it can be very difficult.  Do not ever second guess yourself about this decision.  No matter how "sorry" he is, how many tears he can muster up, how many denials or reasons and excuses for his behavior.  Women who have suffered from abuse have heard it all before and you are very young to be listening to this old song.  He is not your problem to solve.  Getting support from friends, family, groups -if not in person than on-line.  Talking about it can be very helpful.  You may want to consider counseling which is very helpful.  Writing in a journal is another very helpful way to get your feelings out if only on paper.  Maintain your strength and discontinue any communication from him whatsoever.  Allowing for any contact can lead to false hope or misinterpretation.   Good luck to you.|`|NAGiNKFWaa	Well only time will help you recover.  Your boyfriend has narcissistic personality disorder, he is not sorry he abused you and he never will be.  In his mind he is right and the world is all wrong.  It isn't his fault he hit you, it is your fault.  He cried just to put on a show for you, and make you feel bad.  He denies he ever hurt you and he will deny it for the next 20 years, that is part of his ego.  No amount of counseling will ever help him.  He will abuse the next girl too.  You just need time to get over him, and don't take him back.  He will be very kind to try and get you back, but it is just a game.  Just focus on happy thoughts, your favorite song, your favorite Bible verse, your favorite poem.  When you get thoughts of your abusive ex, just replace them with thoughts of something positive, think of something positive on purpose.  Joyce Meyer wrote a book called "Battlefield of the Mind."  It would be a good book to read.  Peace be with you.|`|8d42bfdda82b255679a249cc8e70cd53aa	And as you can see hes still in denial cause he don't think he hurt you.So stay away from him because.Say for example you were to go back with him he would not change because he don't think theres a problem and that's the first step in changing anything realizing you have a problem.Trust me I just turned 19 in Feb and I was where you are right now,you love him but theres no exuse for that.What I want you to do is realize this is a problem and do something to prevent this from happening again.Find someone else better!|`|IddUYNR3aa	First, what he did was a crime. It's called assault.<br>  Second, good for you to get away from him. I hope you are strong enough to stay away. You do not deserve to be abused. <br>  His crying is typical behavior. <br>  He may try emotional/psychological abuse. He may try to convince you he will not do it again. He may threaten to hurt himself. He may try to convince you it was your fault and you made him do it. Don't buy any of it.<br>  I wish they gave out information in all schools about all forms of abuse.<br>  I was with someone who never hit me but he put me down and called me names and controlled what I did and where I went.

Find someone who understands you and this situation and when you need someone, or want to go someplace you shouldn't have to give up because it was 'yours', call them. Have them go to those places with you, focus away from him, but on who your with.. And above all,remember the circumstances of when he hit you. I hope you reach a point where thinking about it makes you angry...and ask yourself "how dare he"....Not to forget the emotional abuse, it is a horrible thing, it could have a negative effect on how you see intimacy, dating, men, even  trust. A full year of that? You are probably every bit deserving of some professional counseling....they can help you with the getting over it part too.  And next time (god forbid) that's Battery. Call the cops on him and send his "forgetful" macho a** to jail where they can teach him some anger management. A tender side, he was probably abused in such a way himself, and may be the only 'way' he knows to go about interpersonal relationships, Still doesn't excuse it. Good luck|`|CS9qmGHtaa	you need to get as far away from him as possiable and pray about it.
NAGiNKFWaa	You have to practice on purpose.  Joyce Meyer wrote a book called Battlefield of the Mind, and she talks about how you have to get rid of stinking thinking on purpose.  They teach you to rebuke the devil, but nobody tells you what to do to stop wrong, bad, negative thoughts.  So Joyce says you have to practice thinking positive on purpose.  When negative thoughts come into your mind, replace them with your favorite song, poem, Bible verse, just anything positive and pleasant.  If you focus on the negative, you will notice the negative, but if you practice the positive you will notice more positive things.  It is really hard, but you can do it.  Like you could take a note book and write down 3 positive things each day, and soon you will notice more and more positive things.|`|04bSzgxgaa	I just keep taking the medication lol. I`ve answered a few questions on thought today.... there is a theme happening he he he. I had to join thinkers anon, it became so bad I broke into the local library to find things to think about. On a serious note though I do struggle some days more than others. I do find that I have bouts/episodes of thinking that can get out of control. On the whole though it does make me very creative at times and I can have a fantastic sense of humor which is ok up to a point. Once it passes that though for me it becomes a huge problem as it can have a bad effect on daily life and others do get a bit p`d off. I do take it from your question though that the unpleasant bit is slightly different and the answer is different for each of us. My friend there are unpleasant things in life and to deal with them head on can be bad for our mind and our well being, so any form of distraction (a good word to use) can give some relief. Sharing company and having a chuckle, even a small one always helps me I find as does the beauty in nature.

It is much better to resolve an issue whether in actuality or in the mind than to avoid dealing with it. All thoughts arrive in the consciousness for a reason. To determine their validity and meaning is sometimes quite the chore. Exert what energy is needed...examine your feelings and ask why they are present. Expand in whatever direction the spirit leads and use this to enable you to learn and grow.                                                                  Awareness of a problem often leads to an anxious state until the situation is addressed and the complexities SIMPLIFIED. In simple forms that which once plagued us becomes something easily dealt with. The dragon becomes an accessory to our learning experience, rather than an intimidating foe that distracts us from the pursuit of peace.

If they're avoiding something that is part of their daily reality...distraction may be something that does not come so easily.  Reading books, drawing or painting, physical exercise, listening to music, or doing some volunteer work can all be effective distractions.  Some unpleasant thoughts won't go away until you deal with them...confront them and put them into perspective until they no longer  take over your mind.  Counseling can be of help with someone in this situation, and if these thoughts are obssesive, therapy and medication would be the route to take.

ke0dsgkkaa	Hello, if you are stressed and/or worried about this, go get tested now. Maybe, at least I think you shouldn't be having sex at your age and if so, use condom-sense! Best to you!|`|pOgTr74Waa	Is it only me or this question has been already asked?
uJmUiUBhaa	well for starters, the fact that you can remember this dream so detailed down to how that butterfly looked tells you that the dream (or your mind) was trying to tell you something.  and you said that his eyes were blue in your dream, blue or light eyes in dreams mean that you will have a new friendship. and you said he was skinny, maybe he is sick or ill in your dream and you could be thinking that you being his friend and your sister finally having the relationship could make him better. the sun can somtimes mean success in all that concerns you only  if it was clear and bright ,but if it was a reddish color it means you will struggle but find victory, or if it was an overcast sun you will have no success just trouble. <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  hopefully this made some since to you.. really hope i helped.. !! :):)|`|PmT0Bx21aa	ok so first congrats to your sister, sounds like someone likes her. now that that's covered, you said he looked skinnier than he was in your dream and that he looked upset and you saw a caterpillar and a butterfly in your dream and in the song "how to save a life" you saw the same butterfly and caterpillar. the song means that his friend was in trouble and when he tried to help him it was too late. your friend needs your help. hes upset, lonely, without your sister probably since you said when they kissed he was happier. i believe that when someone you know is in trouble or something you can sense it. im also like you too, when something happens that i don't understand i think a lot about it until i figure it out.|`|XlOrWxxGaa	might be worth you trying to find out where this kiddie has ended up and maybe give him a call tell him u r thinking of him, ask him how he is etc.,<br>  <br>  everyone likes to know that someone cares... no harm done there eh?|`|1zBDjgLjaa	Maybe it means you should look him up and see if he is doing alright it sounds like maybe you may be worried about him and you should tell your sister about the dream and that he liked her and you maybe thought he should have dated her so you could try to help her find him yo see if it was to be so.
fBFMwgq5aa	Nope, I welcome death. I don't want to grow old and feeble like my late 97 year old grandfather. I hope I die a worthwhile death like dying while trying to save innocent people's lives out of harms way. That is a heroic death.|`|O15my3olaa	As you cross the street everyday some dumb, careless driver may crash into you; as you walk on a country road a meteor or meteorite from God-knows-where, may land on your head. These and hundreds of other incidents are possible everyday. But does it mean we must think about them each time we go outdoors? Even as you remain indoors, some idiotic pilot may crash his private plane through your window. So, relax, one must live a fuller life--just focus on what you are doing, be alert and be more realistic. Every one in the world is prone to accidents, terminal diseases and death. Books would not help much to banish your fears. Just have a bolder and more positive attitude.  Cheers and take care! :-)) |`|zZY3JX30aa	Used to be, not any more.<br>  <br>  Is your worrying going to change anything, except maybe speed up its occurrence?|`|385371073e8d53b7e0a56851b570adabaa	Yes, I went through a period when I felt surrounded by death and I found it very depressing and difficult.  I found a book called Life After Life by Raymond Moody and it was very helpful and reassuring.  Hope it helps.|`|SUzn3qfzaa	Just think about how many people have actually died, billions! Appreciate that you are living and worry about death when you are.. dead :P|`|ksLCaFbvaa	If you die a natural death,I believe your body and soul will prepare you.|`|MGC1NKnVaa	Me too!!!!!!  I think about it all the time and it freaks me out!  I wish I knew what to tell you. |`|96af43a6ab3bf4045a9898acf5153bb9aa	I used to terrified of death and of dying - I still sometimes get a bit panicked about it but I have now calmed down.<br>  I believe that you live this life as a way of attaining wisdom and helping others, as each lesson is learnt, you get to live a different live next time around. Death is then a joyful experience on your journey to become the ultimate person that you can be, then you ascend into a higher level of being.I know it sounds foolish but having seen so much death around me and then joy of new life as well, has really made me realise that we are really just passing atoms in a large universe, in each of our lives we can make a difference to those around us - so that when we do face the ultimate (death) - we have nothing to regret in our lives and ultimately come back as Angels or spiritual Guides to help the next generation<br>  <br>  I don't allow e-mails but if you need to chat - I will make an exception.<br>  |`|Sgyspffwaa	If you could live your life to the fullest, what would that mean to you? What would you want to do? When you die, do you want to die knowing you spent your life terrified of dying? Or do you want to die as the girl that tried everything, went places, met people and LIVED!<br>  <br>  BTW, dying isn't so bad. It's actually quite a peaceful thing. Very peaceful and like nirvana. So don't be afraid of it.|`|X8CPWapxaa	you shouldn't fear death. if you are misfortuned, death is something to look forward too. aswell as being Christian. also the thought that once you die, you are finally realxed forever, you never need to exert yourself again, you lose the feeling of pain, you are for the first time, truly peaceful.|`|TDXNPz4Uaa	poor you, i have always worried about dying ever since i was little. and now that im 41 i feel that i am on a count down to it. its a horrible feeling. its going to happen to all of us. what im trying to do is cram as much into my life as i can, take everyday as an adventure and enjoy it. get as many memories as you can. so when the day does come you don't look back and wish you done life different. just put it to the back of your mind and enjoy life.  |`|BPMyrjvHaa	I DO BUT THEN I STOP AND THINK LIFES TO SHORT TO WONDER WHEN ITS GOING TO END, YOU'VE GOT TO ENJOY IT WHILE YOUR HERE, LIVE EVERYDAY LIKE IT'S YOUR LAST, AND DON'T WASTE A MINUTE OF IT BECAUSE EVERY MINUTE YOU WASTE IS A MINUTE YOU'LL NEVER GET BACK!!!!|`|NSz8Impmaa	Live each day as if it is your last.<br>  <br>  When you're dead you're dead and you won't know about it.|`|rEjbyP4Oaa	maybe just look upon it as eternal sleep.|`|9XtUK8z6aa	Pray and make sure you are saved.|`|JltE5LIHaa	Don't think about dying, think about living. Think about the things you would like to do, the places you'd like to visit. Think about the children you will have someday. Always wake up with a smile on your face to greet the new day and think about what you are going to do with it  . Stop worrying about what will happen eventually otherwise your life will have passed you buy. Seize the day, smile and be happy.|`|K1oNeH0Gaa	If you believe in God then you can have the opportunity everlasting life and have some purpose to this universe. <br>  <br>  If you believe in evolution then you are no more to this universe and all consequences of your existance are meaningless further than this small chunk of rock.

You should live each day as it comes! Don't concentrate on the idea of you dying.. because it's just not healthy for your mind, It's really negative and I am sure that you have something really good to look forward to in your life.. or if you don't then get working on something! Unfortunately it's something that is going to have to happen on everyone but life is so exciting and yeah it does have it's ups and downs and can be real difficult at times but just look at those times as challenges and keep going! I feel that you worrying about it is just putting so much negativity on your shoulders which I am sure is causing you a lot of upset so I would try and be a little more positive not overly optimistic cos that can get a bit annoying.. we all need to be realistic! If you feel that you would like to become religious then great but don't turn to religion just to solve your fear of death. If it is a huge upset for you then maybe you need to look at from where it has come from and try and heal yourself. Also it's nice to get other peoples opinions and answers but they are not going to be able to completely get rid of your fear.<br>  <br>  :)|`|OZdABLq0aa	It's one thing all people are afraid of. Most of us are so afraid we would do most anything to avoid it, one of the things we do is let our brain just not think about it. We preoccupy ourselves with what ever possible, I mean what ever possible!  Like years and years of meaningless forms of entertainment and goals. I believe we are fearful of death because we don't know what happens or we have some idea based on what ever experience we may have run across. One method of easing you fear would be to learn about what others say about it, you don't have to become religious look at what some other religious and spiritual people say about it then draw your own conclusions. Personally I have found Eastern philosophies seem to have more meaningful ideas about it.|`|VnbiRBajaa	Fill your days with things to look forward to; plan holidays, take on a new hobby, do something good for someone else, learn a new skill.  Once you are really living, you will lose the fear of dying.|`|NuoE4nk4aa	yep its scary!!<br>  <br>  be with family and loved ones! <br>  <br>  be happy<br>  <br>  have no worries<br>  <br>  live like tomorrow will be your last<br>  <br>  do you have a religion?  talk to the minister<br>  <br>  otherwise, remember about the joys in life :)|`|KNoe74Toaa	If you are constantly worried about dying, it means you have no life to look forward to each day. So, get a life.|`|9894c49f5ab9c603dcad543a9ce51827aa	PRAYING is a very good thing, if you have a religion, get nto it, LIFE is wonderful!|`|ReUK51BAaa	It is something one can't control. But I'd suggest no reckless behavior, and be cautious. The bible might ease your mind. 
4k5MkmInaa	Life is too short to impress others who are unimportant to you :)<br>  <br>  Do with youre Happy with,try and set your mind on other things,Focus on something else<br>  <br>  BTW daydreaming,especially in your case is a sign of worring or anxiety over your future,so if you have any unresolved issues,talk to someone you know thats helpful and might give you some advices.|`|d6MDxrMlaa	Just wait till a goombah sticks a gun in your face.Then you will never daydream again!

PILm2U4Taa	As long as they are just *fantasies*, enjoy...<br>  <br>  They are all about Power, and "rape fantasies" probably indicate, on some level, a contempt of females. Also no one who truly feels powerful would need to such extreme "doses" of imaginary power positions. Basically, nothing wrong with it in the realm of fantasy, although I'm curious about finding pleasure in images of women in pain. My guess is the connection between those images and the fantasies themselves, not the pain in and of itself...<br>  <br>  Causing pain is easy, anyone can cause another pain, it takes no skill or knowledge to do. It's therefore ...cheap. <br>  <br>  There is, however, a fine line between pain and pleasure, if you can find yourself a woman with submissive and masochistic tendencies, you may find a match made in heaven...|`|c48xLEolaa	Part of the attraction of it could be the fact that it's a sexual taboo. It doesn't mean you want to rape anyone; many women have rape fantasies, it doesn't mean they want to be raped.
4KF4v3Dcaa	That was me.<br>  But it was weird like everything upset me so much i just couldnt be happy and i was like....absolutely depressed!<br>  And i guess you get so used to the feeling its like a part of you.<br>  <br>  But I took a pill and now its weird my thoughts are all differnt now! I definitely had a chemical imbalance, how weird|`|ivUSJbvaaa	I have now idea how, but i know that it is true. If you are a happy person, it is easy to get out of it, but if you are depressed, than there seems to be some part of you that craves for negative emotions. In your head, you want to feel better but there is always something inside you restricting you from feeling happy, even though you think you want to be. My theory is that we have to have an equal share of good and bad in our lives, because the option of a boring inbetween is jsut out of the question. The sadder you feel now, the more you will cherish the moments when you feel joy.|`|4Zj2Ljwlaa	maybe cuz they can come back up
CAvyNqXRaa	Milk is a symbol of learning, knowledge, plenty, fertility and immortality. Dreaming of milk is a very positive message from your unconscious. It may suggest that you are in need of the deepest and most fundamental type of nourishment and that it is available to you. You unconscious may be suggesting that it is time for you to grow and to learn and that it is possible for you to do that at the current time.   <br>  <br>  Maybe you feel like you used to know so much and now know so little?

Most teenagers are depressed, it will pass, but again I don't know the circumstances, if everything in you life is the same besides what you mentioned, it should blow over.|`|4lG5zBc5aa	oui oui|`|Sgm0RrMQaa	i would think so, do you have someone to talk to? don't give up, life gets better eventually.|`|8kpcRyCnaa	I can't help but read this with a smile.  It seems like you have a few things going on that you may not be aware of as something that is working against you.  For starters:  what are you eating?  If you are eating anything with either high sugar or bleached wheat, studies have shown that these things can have an opposite effect on some people than they do on the rest of the population.  Which is, instead of making you hyper, making your metabolism slow down, which leads to wanting to sleep more, which leads to hunger and so the cycle begins.  Relax, its easily solved problem.  Change your diet, and add something interesting to your daily routine.  If you like nature, take a walk, if you like to read, go outside or somewhere with people and read(like a Coffee shop).  If you like sports, join one or go to an event that sponsors that sport.  The possibilities are only limited by your imagination.  Many things in life seem bigger than they actually are, and this emotion of depression that you are feeling right now, it will pass and come again and pass again.  It is like a season.  Good luck.
zRZKdH1Zaa	Yes, that has happened to me before.  I ended up talking to them.  And still do.|`|LLeQyWGcaa	yep it happens. there is just something about some people that catches your interest and the more you find out about that person the more you feel they are like you. it is refreshing to find someone like that in this world, it's nice to know someone else shares the same values as you and you are not the odd man out.|`|98GbovYTaa	HAHA yeah do all the time..i stalk people who i don;t even know..love to do it on the internet but sometimes that's not always possible unfortunately|`|lpeOwnGRaa	I feel like there must be a reason why some people can walk right by us 50 times a week, and we don't notice them, but another person can walk by us once, and we are up all night thinking about them. <br>  <br>  My best guess is that something about him stood out to you, whether or not you find him physically attractive. That happens sometimes and maybe he could end up being one of your best friends. I would encourage you to talk to him. <br>  <br>  ~violet~|`|lwc0n0zCaa	yes it sounds like youre describing my former situation.<br>  things like this happen all the time, i guess its because im really good at reading people|`|PtoieF7Caa	Yes.<br>  When I was 12 I saw this student leaving a ship. I couldn't have seen him for more than a minute but I instantly felt connected to him. I saw him again a few years later when I was 16, again I felt the same connection, I didn't think he was anything special in the looks department, just your average guy, I couldn't tell you about his personality because I never even spoke to the guy but for some reason I felt so drawn to him. My friends all thought I had a crush on him and while I admit that I would have liked the chance to get to know him, I wouldn't have called it a crush, I don't know what I would have called it.<br>  I saw him once again when I was 18 with the same effect. It's weird, i've encountered this guy three times, in three separate cities, each time has only been a casual passing in a very crowded area. How do I keep running into this guy and being able to notice him? I don't think he even lives in this country.<br>  I hope i'll actually get the chance to speak to him one day as he seems to keep haunting me.<br>  <br>  I wish I knew what it meant, I find it very confusing. I feel more strongly about a complete stranger than I do about the guys i've known for years. I'm very interested to see the other answers people give.|`|iYgEVKRRaa	oh my god yes and i had the hardest time getting past it, i never completely understood it but it was just one of those things that just kind of happens. Don't sweat it, if you don't like him try to concentrate on someone else, if you do maybe the feeling is telling  you something try perusing the relationship.|`|e73ca33b224dc9da4ca8f2c8feeeeb7aaa	Its just an obsession. I used to get it, and ended up trying to find out all about them because i didn't know how to just say 'hi who are you'? The funny thing is though, each person I felt like that about somehow ended up in my life. One randomly joined my circle of friends, and another ended up in a university club with me. So who knows maybe there's something to it?

The cop, who looked a lot like tasha yarr from star trek TNG (She was pretty cool but she died in the show ... ) had a silver desert eagle (which I am pretty sure I got from the game call of duty 4) and got out of her car and behind her door and yelled "What the F***!?" at me pointing her gun towards me. Then I woke up... O_O

AA10835554	Self-concept or the ego is determined by how one identifies themselves. A woman with children would identify herself with the roll of "mother". A woman that heals the sick may identify herself with the roll of "doctor". A man can identify himself with his car. A child in school may identify with the roll of "bully" or "nerd". A person may identify with their weight. One very common identity is of what others think of you. It says, "I am what they think I am". That is why people get stage fright, because they think they are what the audience thinks they are, and so must be perfect so they think good things about them. <br>  <br>  Ultimately most people identify with their thoughts, as they think they are their thoughts, and this is what most effects one's self-concept. Humans are thought based entities and so are lost in thought on a regular basis. One famous quote is, "I think therefore I am". <br>  <br>  So the ego doesn't care if the roll is good or bad, rich or overweight, but it just wants an identification to feel alive. Its basically a need to know who you are, and how you are separate from everyone else. <br>  <br>  The problem with ego is that you associate yourself with an idea or form, such as your car, and these things don't last forever. So now what happens if the doctor loses her job, who is she now? With such a strong identification with a roll, some people will actually kill themselves when they lose their job, as their very sense of self has been destroyed. Its quite ridiculous because if they were their job, then they would have disappeared when they lost it. Its all unconscious so they aren't aware of this.<br>  <br>  You may want to look into the separation from ego that people practice, such as a Buddhist monk. They learn that they are not their job, wealth, body or even thoughts, but they are the awareness of those things. They call it the awakening, and its a very interesting concept.

WFtf9VHdaa	Old habits are hard to break and I consider how one behaves around others and their own social practices something of a habit.  I was a very shy person for most of my life and I went through school and really didn't become more outgoing until late in college. I overcame my shyness by gravitating towards people in organizations and clubs that had similiar interests.  From there, I branched out into participating in more activities and, eventually, I just became more socailly secure and very "comfortable in my own skin".  A big step for me was to get involved with others in makeshift study groups, or sessions before tests or clinicals, and my peers became more like friends and treated me differently.  After that, when I would see them in class, on campus or out in public, they would always greet me and I really felt accepted.  I hope that you are able to make friends and that you can build confidence.  As a man, I can tell you that you should not have any difficulty meeting a man provided that he's available.  Most men, when approached by a woman, are very straightforward and if extended an invitation to go have a coffee (or something like that) after you have started talking to them, will respond in kind.  I can tell you that men don't pick up on really subtle hints and signs and I think this is what most women don't understand.  Also, remember: it's perfectly normal for females to initiate contact now.  In fact, a lot of guys assume that most women are already taken so just casually start talking to a man that you have some potential interest in.  I think you'll find that, once you get the ball rolling, things will take off from there (if he's single and heterosexual).  I wish you the best of luck and I hope that my advise helps you.  You sound like a very intelligent women with much to offer so get out there and take some steps towards connecting with others.|`|JoXk9HNuaa	enjoy your life|`|FtEMPDidaa	Maybe you're difficult to read.  Even if you're shy, you have to be open in getting to know people and then they'll get to know you as well.  OR, maybe it's not you at all.  Maybe your school just really sucks and no one is outgoing enough to get to know you.  If you're socially awkward and shy, just force yourself to be outgoing and you;ll see a difference..I think you should stop worrying about it and just enjoy yourself.  Do things your interested in, have fun, and just LIVE..<br>  <br>  And when it comes to the dating thing, you have to get yourself out there.  Go out, meet people, strike up conversation and things will happen for you..just be open with people..|`|e97396e91681ce7738d24c354fa34ecfaa	You seem to be a smart person; you just have to realize it.<br>  <br>  A persons mind is what determines his/her life, your mind is your most powerful tool, your mind can turn situations around as you turn it in the right direction, here is how,<br>  <br>  1) you need to learn positive thinking<br>  At first you have to realize that you have a choice to think what you want, no one can stop you!!!<br>  Now that you know that it’s your choice what to think about; choose wisely,<br>  When you have a bad habit such as shyness, instead of thinking I don’t want to be shy, think that you do want to make friends and think of ways how to (see my suggestion below for ideas how to), keep looking on for the future and your mind will become habitually thinking this way, the more you think about the solutions to the problem the less time you have to think about the actual problem, as the human mind can’t think about 2 things at the same time. <br>  <br>  2) learn how to become a kind and compassionate person.<br>  you have to realize that your value is much more than you think it is, the more you think about how to make other people feel good (not when you want something from them) the better you feel about yourself, the more love you show to others the better you feel about yourself and the more you receive love from others, and you have less time to think about your weaknesses.<br>  <br>  I suggest that you read the well known book “How to Win Friends and Influence People” by Dale Carnegie, this will help you develop and improve your social skills.|`|JxlqtN7baa	most importantly, you said over and over again people don't take an interest in you, are you taking an interest in them? are you asking questions? are you asking for numbers? see what i mean.... <br>  <br>  don't join sports nonsense things, they're rubbish ;) what are YOU actually interested in? go find people with similar interests visiting each other in confined spaces. it'll make for easier conversation when your talking to people about something everyones really interested in.|`|J4z3mJyuaa	I've always had the same problem. If you don't have any serious faults, it's probably just your insecurity that turns people off. People want to be friends with other people that make them feel better about themselves and/or somehow improve their life. <br>  People are empathic. If you feel anxious around other people, they are likely to feel that from you, even if they don't realize it. Haven't you ever met someone and just known that there was something wrong with them, even when they were pretending things were great? Maybe they were sad? Didn't this make your mood drop, too? If you are lonely and crying when you're by yourself, then you may be putting off negative emotions when you're around others too. No one wants to hang out with someone that makes them feel sad or anxious. <br>  Is there anyone in your organization that seems interesting? Is there any way you can form a project that will help your organization, and get other people involved? Have you honestly put forth the effort to make conversation when you go out? Don't be afraid to jump in and ask for an invitation if people that you're trying to be friends with mention a party.<br>  If you want people to notice you, you have to put yourself out there. You have to open up and let them in. If you were in a group and there was someone that did nothing more than smile and laugh at other's jokes, would that be enough to make you interested in getting there phone number? There are a lot of people in this world to make friends with. It only makes sense to pursue friends that you know you share common interests with and are able to have fun with.<br>  People probably don't think you're a bad person. They just don't know anything about you, because you don't talk much. Work on feeling better about yourself, continue going to social events, and add to the conversation whenever you can. I know it's hard. There's usually not much chance to talk in a group of friends, because someone is always saying something. But if you can get a word in sometimes, then one of them may notice that you're trying to participate and try to strike up conversation with you. If you're lucky, you will make a friend that likes to get her friends out and around other people. Then, you'll make more and more friends through them. And you'll likely all share common interests! <br>  It's harder for those of us who are shy, but the system works very well in the end. Your main goal should be feeling good about yourself. I have met people that I normally wouldn't care to ever talk to again, but they had such a good easy-going attitude that I was drawn to them. I am highly empathic, and I LOVE being around people that exude contentment and confidence. These are traits that I have always wanted, but often fall short of, so being around them actually makes me feel better about myself and life in general. I've also learned from them and actually improved on myself.<br>  If you can get out there and start making friends, guys will be much more likely to be interested in you. Be confident, open, and try to look your best when you go out. It may take a bit of effort, but it will work. Most men (and women) in college are interested in a fun relationship and aren't after anything long-term. If this is what appeals to you, then put out those vibes! Think about how it will make you feel. If what you want is on your mind, then some guys might pick up on that. It might be enough to get their attention, at least. Don't be afraid to approach a guy you are interested in! This will likely be refreshing, as men are still often left to make the first move. If he says "no thanks", that's okay. There are plenty of fish in the sea! It's impossible for every guy to be interested in you. We're all different. Try to go after guys you know share common interests, so that you'll have something to talk about.<br>  Body language can go a long way. You should read about it to make sure you're not putting the wrong message across. For example, arm crossing can be a sign of defensiveness, close-mindedness, or even aggression. That is one thing you want to avoid when making others feel comfortable around you.<br>  Also, make sure you're hygiene is good. No one wants to talk to a person with bad breath. <br>  This is all I can think of atm.|`|WK8f0GwBaa	maybe you should start improving you social skills by having a common disscusion to start out with. for example if they're talking about a certain book,tv show, fashion anything that u know, its ok to tell them your openion, every one likes a disscusion where both of you understand what is the other's point.always be nutrial.<br>  <br>  when meeting new people you shouldn't expect them immidiatly to come ad introduce themselves tell you there phone number and all about them. things need time,when first meeting a new person introduce yourselfe shortly.open a conversation with them by asking them some formal questions:there name, where did they study, how many times have they come to this place...etc.<br>  <br>  boys don't like a girl who is always looking around for a boy. whenever your out, try to simply enjoy yourself the place.people are always attractedto a confidant person who knows how to enjoy himself with no need of others help.<br>  <br>  there is no reason to be shy. you are what you are be confident about it, people should like you for who you are not what u pretend to be.<br>  <br>  BE CONFIDENT =)

X6DIkFl2aa	It sounds like you are taking lots of good LSD. You should send me some. I want to see things that way too!!!|`|vjIYS4BCaa	This is the same answer to your question, posted here for your convenience:<br>  <br>  What you describe sounds like it could be the product of how one's cones (the parts of the retina that sense color) are constructed.<br>  <br>  After looking at, say, a green figure for a while, if one turned one's attention to a white surface, like a whiteboard one would see a red (i.e. dark pink!) figure. Or, if one looked at yellow for a long time, one would see blue.<br>  <br>  Green-Red, Yellow-Blue are linked in that cones of different kinds pair these color and use two different molecules to signal the brain that a certain light wavelength is being received. Eventually, the molecule runs out, the brain uses internal logical to enable you to continue seeing that color but once one turns away, the cone continues to send a signal using the other chemical available to it.|`|hceNM6Uxaa	I think you're just especially sensitive to the visual effect - like in all those 'tricks' where you look at something for a while and then look at a white wall and you see the image in the 'complementary' colours.  Because there's white around the green, you're getting it very easily.  I wouldn't call this an optical illusion - it's just a biological effect of how we process colour - but it isn't synaesthesia either.<br>  <br>  Do you get this with any other colours?|`|8f79a6907c34a502a5158ce4ade3c011aa	Isn't synesthesia when you mix senses? Like tasting Pink or seeing sounds.<br>  <br>  _()_|`|Fo9ADQLBaa	I just love idiocracy's answer.  that is too funny!<br>  One I can appreciate, for sure!  :D<br>  I see this as a gift.

Ug7Om1qyaa	Narcissistic is a grandiose self image and excessive <br>  need to be admired.So if you dont get the admiration<br>  you long for it can lead too low self esteem.|`|Bsi4olK9aa	Actually, they go hand in hand.  You truly are an amazing individual, but that is independent of your concept of self as the human ego.  It is the higher qualities that all people share combined with your uniqueness that makes you special.  The higher human qualities are love, joy, patience, goodness, and kindness.  Each is an in depth subject matter worthy of study. <br>  <br>  Many love possessively and selfishly, but the love that "can moves mountains" is expressed through sacrifice, selflessness and service.|`|6PtYG5cLaa	yeah tell me about|`|Ti0q1Btiaa	Not likely.<br>  <br>  They don't suffer from that.  Trust me.  My ex is one.|`|7oF2o4q5aa	Yes, but it's really more self-centered.  The less you focus on yourself, the more your self esteem will rise and you will be less apt to be self-centered.
kFlMHSKIaa	They are more logical and able to multitask.|`|ejrxNVD1aa	yes different minds from male and female|`|iXwA5wAlaa	One of the most interesting differences appear in the way men and women estimate time, judge speed of things, carry out mental mathematical calculations, orient in space and visualize objects in three dimensions, etc. In all these tasks, women and men are strikingly different, as they are too in the way their brains process language. This may account, scientists say, for the fact that there are many more male mathematicians, airplane pilots, bush guides, mechanical engineers, architects and race car drivers than female ones.<br>  On the other hand, women are better than men in human relations, recognizing emotional overtones in others and in language, emotional and artistic expressiveness, esthetic appreciation, verbal language and carrying out detailed and pre-planned tasks. For example, women generally can recall lists of words or paragraphs of text better than men|`|8gnp5Kkjaa	The male mind is categorized into boxes.  There is a box for fixing things, a box for paying bills, a box for video games, a box for cars, a box for sports, a box for swimming, a box for driving, a box for mowing the yard, a box for his mother-in-law (probably in the basement somewhere covered with dust...)  The point is that the contents of the boxes cannot be mixed with each other.  Whenever you ask a man a question, he references the appropriate box and views the contents and bases his answer on what he finds in that particular box.<br>  <br>  The female mind is more like a bundle of wire.  Everything is interconnected and related to everything else.  Sometimes in large parts, sometimes in more subtle ways.  <br>  <br>  That is why a man can say, "I went to the store and I bought an orange and I ate it and it was good."<br>  <br>  But a woman says, "I went to the store to buy an orange and do you know who I ran into?  Susan!!  Not the Susan I went to college with but the Susan who works at the insurance company.  Do you remember her?  Her son is in the Army.  Anyway he's getting married next weekend and she said it would be great if we could go.  But I remembered you wanted to do something next weekend so I told her I would have to get back to her...."<br>  <br>  At this point the unfortunate man who is listening to this story has started rummaging around in the "car" box looking for something interesting seeing as how he's going to have to be here for a while....|`|TU95i2R2aa	females are more mature|`|Y1iYQJvWaa	They are greater<br>  Don:- we can have one only if we want|`|cFzPc42Oaa	i want to make changes to wilders anwers..to a more realistic verstion..<br>  women_ shopping, make-up,football,hockey,soccer,half naked men(top half),nice hair, bad hair, bjss, coffee,  dietss , shots , gym, money , art, fashion ,buissness, lotions, sex , titanic,,human,,<br>  men_football, beer, naked women football,hockey,soccer dietss,,bjss coffee, gym,, money. art fashion..nice hair, bad hair,,buissness video games, porn.., sex, comics ,starwarss<br>  human<br>  this is in any order..|`|DFNf2yJMaa	I don't agree with anyone's answer saying men are logical and women are emotional.  I am a woman and I am extremely logical.  I appear very feminine and I am very interested in men.  However, I process like a man does at times.  When I need to figure something out, I shut down in an emotional and mental cave until I feel better---then I'm back.  For example, if women are talking about makeup, I end up chiming in about all the toxic chemicals in those products they smear all over their face.  Now, I do wear makeup... just chemically free alternatives.  I boycott valentines day because I hate following the herd.<br>  <br>  They say women tend to talk about people and guys talk about things.  Now, I do agree with that on some level, when I write songs I write about people.  However in conversation, I'm known to bring up random facts I learned the other day... in other words, I talk about things.<br>  <br>  All of my women friends are the exact same way.  Guys appreciate my logical approach and feminine appearance.  It's all about personality differences and intellect.|`|On57DVlAaa	Female minds mature earlier. <br>  <br>  We take longer for some reason.<br>  <br>  They talk, we listen LOL.<br>  <br>  Women go around in circles about things.

ryjnt3dhaa	I don't think seeing that by itself will ruin your life.  If it is causing that big of a problem for you then you should consider talking to a professional or a friend about it.  Seeing your parents having sex is traumatic but it isn't something that should cause you this much anguish.  I saw my grandparents having sex and all it did was gross me out.|`|SkLeo8C3aa	Omg you poor child.|`|RZKygoPzaa	If you walked in on them accidentally, no.  If you hid and made it your business to spy on them, yes, but then you re the one with the problem.<br>  <br>  if you walked in on them by accident you will have to deal with it.  Let me ask you, how did you think you got here?  Sex is normal especially between a married couple.  Were you very young when this happened?  That would certainly have some bearing on this.  Do either of your parents know what you saw?  I would approach the parent of the same as you and talk about it.  If you can't bring yourself to do this, then you will have to put it away for a while until you older.<br>  <br>  DO NOT FIXATE ON THIS.<br>  <br>  If you walked in on one of your parents sitting on the toilet, or throwing up, or breaking wind, or eating a sandwich, or picking their noses would you have this reaction?<br>  <br>  Life is full of these things.  You have a lot of growing up to do, and that is ok.  We all mature at a different rate.  Just remember, we are ALL human, no one is perfect.  Don't let this scar you for life.  As I said, put it on a shelf, way, way back in you mind, do not obsess about it.  It happened and it was not meant for you to see. <br>  <br>  Yoour parents are human and are entittled to their privacy.  Accidents will happen, as you saw them in a very intimate moment.  Let it go, dear, don't let it destroy you.

If it's making things worse, stop.<br>  <br>  While it's cool that you want to try and desensitize yourself to such material, for some, it's just not possible. That doesn't mean there's anything wrong, it just means one is different from other people. <br>  <br>  You have a lower tolerance for things than some people, so why try and force it? Just stick to things that you know are safe for you, and peek your head out the door every so often to test yourself and see if things have changed. Or try watching things that are higher intensity than you're used to but not QUITE as intense... The SAW movies are not the best movies to try and work a tolerance up to-- I'm not nearly as sensitive as you sound, and I still can't watch those movies.<br>  <br>  Might I suggest a few movies? The Others, Ultraviolet, The Mummy, Van Helsing and a few others like that are very tame (and somewhat cheesy, but still good!) but do contain elements of pain, fear, suffering, violence, etc. Just not in the overwhelming amount of the crap you're trying to watch. =P <br>  <br>  Overall, just take it slower. Going from YuGiOh (or whatever) to Texas Chainsaw Massacre is like not knowing how to swim but cannon-balling into the deep end anyhow.

9EVcTnUWaa	I would give my self some time to process what my body's going through.  IF you're just going through puberty about 10 years late you have to give yourself time to adjust to what's going on in your body.  You might want to talk to your doctor to see if there is an adjustment he might be able to make to your meds, to help even things out.  You should explore all options before you run, Moving will not only mean leaving home and those who support you but your medical team also and that's not easy to replace. Especially when you're dealing with very rare illnesses.  I know I was born with Hystiositios X a very rare blood disorder and the doctors who treated me and who know how to deal with the disorder are here in NY are you sure that you'll be able to find good medical care elsewhere?  That should be a major consideration of yours,  You might also want to talk to some one to help you deal with your raging hormones.  That way you can deal with what you have to and learn not to run when things get really difficult.<br>  You will be faced with temptations of various sorts through out your life it you run every time that happens you might spend the majority of the rest of your life running.

Best to you!|`|agpCn6Kaaa	I suggest you see an Endocrinologist (a doctor that specializes in hormones) and have yours checked out.  A hormonal problem would be the cause of delayed maturation, and also cause the high libido (sex drive).  A high sex drive is common in someone your age, but if it's so bad that you can't trust yourself around others without having to fight those urges, than you need to have your hormones regulated by a specialist.

We show that developmentally relevant signaling factors can induce mouse embryonic stem (ES) cells to differentiate into spinal progenitor cells, and subsequently into motor neurons, through a pathway recapitulating that used in vivo. ES cell-derived motor neurons can populate the embryonic spinal cord, extend axons, and form synapses with target muscles.

Jesus replied. "There is only One who is good. If you want to enter life, obey the commandments."<br>  18 "Which ones?" the man inquired. Jesus replied, "'Do not murder, do not commit adultery, do not steal, do not give false testimony,<br>  19 honor your father and mother,' and 'love your neighbor as yourself.'"<br>  20 "All these I have kept," the young man said. "What do I still lack?"<br>  21 Jesus answered, "If you want to be perfect, go, sell your possessions and give to the poor, and you will have treasure in heaven. Then come, follow me."<br>  22 When the young man heard this, he went away sad, because he had great wealth.<br>  23 Then Jesus said to his disciples, "I tell you the truth, it is hard for a rich man to enter the kingdom of heaven.<br>  24 Again I tell you, it is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle than for a rich man to enter the kingdom of God."<br>  <br>  Envy, incidentally, besides making you unhappy, happens to be a deadly sin!|`|50UbJp14aa	It is good to appreciate what you have because someone else might not have what you have and they might have enjoyed what you have if they had it,  so just appreciate what you have because it could be gone at any time<br>  <br>  hope i somewhat helped|`|p0JydlOkaa	Instead of focusing on the negative things in your life you should focus on the positive.

8vTpcyPOaa	He is probably hurt by whatever happened and is putting a shield up himself by not believing what you say.

Let him know that is a shame he feels that is what your motives are and you are really genuine (if that's the case). Then tell him how you want to move on in a positive way and hopefully become closer and more open. Something to that effect. Good luck.|`|On57DVlAaa	Very easy to decipher actually. <br>  <br>  You can't give us guys too much attention or make us feel like we are important to you because then we won't see you as a challenge anymore, and we won't want you anymore. He apparently likes you but is not really sure of what you want with him. He wants you to be clear about what you want stop boosting his ego just so that he will be your friend... In other words, stop acting like is god if that is not the way you feel, because he can tell when you do it, and he doesn't like it because it makes him feel like you just doing it to make him stay friends with you.|`|dPmK83UYaa	I think he may thing you are being too nice to him so that he doesn't leave. When what he wants is to see the real you...He wants it to be REAL friendship (b/c even people who get into a romantic relationship want to be best friends) and that is the first step in moving forward in your relationship, being REAL. Maybe he's gone through that all before where he was in a relationship and they were not really themselves, just what the other person wanted to see, then after a while of being together they saw who eachother really was. Relationships aren't all about being nice to the other person and as he said "stroking his ego". I think he wants to hear the truth from you whether it's positive OR negative.

Maybe he thinks you are being insincere. At the same time, he feels you are pulling away at the same time. He just wants you to be yourself around him. He doesn't know how to respond to all of those comments about him being so influential - he would probably rather you were more down to earth and talk more about what is going on in your life.

cwsYM2F4aa	Your mother has a mental illness. And you are not making it any better by continuing to live with her. In fact, you are making it worse because it lets her know that her controlling ways are working and motivates her to continue to do it.<br>  <br>  She is also emotionally and socially crippling her children. This is completely unfair to you and I find it morally reprehensible. She is smothering you and when you get out on your own and have to make your own life decisions, it is going to be a huge shock and difficult adjustment. She has not prepared you for real life. <br>  <br>  I admire you for still wanting your mother in your life and for not completely hating her at this point. To tell you the truth, I do not think I would be so gracious if I was in your position. But I do think that you are being too accomodating. You have lived your whole life to please her. You have been an adult for a long time now and it is time for you to venture out on your own and make a life for yourself. <br>  <br>  If she tries to wipe you out of her life, that is her choice. You cannot control her actions. She is being completely unreasonable and trying to use that threat to control you into staying with her. Don't let her control you even ONE more second. In fact, I really think you would benefit from at least a short period of time away from your mother so that you can gain perspective on the situation and really realize how much you have sacrificed in your life to please her. <br>  <br>  I cannot stress to you how important it is for you to find a very good therapist. I know everyone advises this, but it is crucial. This is not a healthy situation and you've been dealing with it your whole life. So every though you know in your heart that it is not right, I don't think you really have a true picture of how much your mother is hurting you and your siblings. You need to understand it and then start to deal with the repercussions of it. She has stolen your life. That is not right and it's not fair. Life is too short to deal with it any longer.<br>  <br>  Let me warn you about something. When she finds out you are moving out and/or are going to counseling, the you-know-what is going to hit the fan. She is probably going to go off on her "you are the devil's spawn" tangent and even worse because she'll be scared to death you are going to leave her.<br>  <br>  That's why she controls. Because she's deathly afraid people are going to abandon her. It's an irrational fear. She is mentally ill. She sounds like she has Borderline Personality Disorder (BPD) to me. Google that word and see if you agree with me. There is a great book called "I Hate You, Don't Leave Me" all about BPD, the symptoms and strategies to deal with people who have it. I highly recommend it.<br>  <br>  She desperately needs help. You could suggest it to her. If she refuses, there is nothing else you can do about it. At least you know that you tried. But whether she accepts treatment or not, you desperately need to get out of there. Treatment will take time to show results and you don't need one more day of her berating and controlling you. And if she doesn't get help, she is going to get worse and worse and only cause you more mental damage.<br>  <br>  Please, please, please. I'm begging you. For your own sanity and quality of life, move out of there and get help for yourself. Even if she cuts you out of the picture totally, that is much better than living your life under the control of a mentally unstable woman and missing out on everything life has to offer and pursuing your dreams.

If your mother cannot handle that her child is grown and mature and in need of their own private adult life, than the problem is not yours, but hers. If she would "wipe you out of her life" that is her decision, as she is the one who needs to see things for what they are. You are an adult on the verge of setting off on a real and spectacular life. If she cannot support you in that or cannot deal with the evolution of a parent child relationship after childhood has passed, than you will simply need to move on and find joy in other ways.

If your mother cannot bring herself to get past her own personal issues regarding having adult children and she cannot and will not try to be happy and supportive of you, that is her problem and her loss.

That's also how the "finishing each other's sentences" begins to work.<br>  <br>  This technique can also be a concious process.

As you grow older and older, more and more things change.  I know it may be hard.  But lingering over the thoughts of the past will do no good.  It's part of growing up.  The terrible things that happen as we grow up, may be bad at the time, but once you grow older, you'll soon to understand how those events created you for who you are today.<br>  <br>  think about the positive things that happened in your life.  Thinking of one positive thing everyday, and the nasty memories will begin to fade away.  <br>  <br>  Enjoy your childhood right now as it lasts.

Bsi4olK9aa	Yes.  But what about them is real?  When you contemplate such questions, it is necessary to define your place of relativity.  If I perceive from a higher realm of vibration within the matter universe, then what is tangible and visible to me may not be so for you.  Then again, reality is tied to experience, so if you are not tasting, touchings, seeing or smelling a fairy, then it isn't exactly real for you unless you are engaging some other sense such as feeling or imagining.  We live in an interdimensional world.  If your question is one intended to ask, "Can fairies really exist?"  the answer is yes.  Do they exist the way you imagine them in your mind?  Maybe, but to translate that into the context of your conscious life is not exactly a practical activity unless you are either an artist, movie maker, writer, etc....  Could it be that fairies as you or others have imagined them have resulted from some realm of experience, maybe a realm of consciousness one has traveled to while sleeping?  Yes.  Explain Mozart.  I think highly inspired individuals are able to reach into etheric octaves and translate that knowledge (held within their imagination, or inner ear, etc) into some medium (ie...paint or sound) available here (in our current state of relativity).  Einstein's theory of relativity suggests that you perceive reality within and through your frame of context.  Scale and vibration are primary variables.  For example, the world orbiting the sun at 67,000 miles per hour, completing on full cycle in one year.  You don't perceive motion because your moving with the earth.  So in terms of vibration, just because you don't see or feel it, that does not mean it doesn't exist.|`|50UbJp14aa	I have never seen one before, so i dont think, try typing in in wikipedia and see.

And it's normal to feel a little alienated, afraid of criticism, and confused as a teenager.<br>  <br>  However, some of your behaviors are alarming, and do indicate a serious need for counseling before they develop into something permanent or dangerous.  Please have an honest talk with your mother or school counselor immediately - don't hint, tell them straight out that you find it difficult to stop stealing, to interact with others, to feel empathy, and that you want therapy immediately.<br>  <br>  "but they're only small animals" is the beginning of a dangerous rationalization.  Large or small, anything that can feel pain should be treated with respect.  Everything has a right to life - if you must take that life, do it with respect and for a specific purpose, like for food or clothing, not for the amusement of watching it suffer and die.  <br>  A good way to start developing empathy for humans and animals is to start taking care of an animal.  If you don't have your own pet, maybe you could volunteer at a shelter.  Every day, ask yourself how the animal feels, and what you can do to help it.|`|5M0FBU89aa	Nope- sounds pretty normal.<br>  <br>  Just don't kill any more tadpoles- the world needs more frogs. Seriously.<br>  <br>  If you did things to cats and dogs, then you'd start getting into that area of "animal cruelty."<br>  <br>  To me, you sound neglected.   Your Mother is not stupid and she should talk to you about stealing from her.<br>  <br>  You make friends - do you lie to them? take their things, start fights?<br>  If not, then I rest my case;  you were neglected parentally (and possibly scholastically) and you are being forced to find morals and ask questions on your own, which is causing you to quesion yourself.<br>  <br>  Kevin's law:   Just because your parent's neglect you, doesn't mean you *have* to neglect yourself. <br>  <br>  It's a tough job for a 14 year old, but you are going to have to take charge of this situation.   If you can talk to a school counselor about getting a therapist, or even your other parent, or find out on your own what counseling resources  are available to you, you will feel better about yourself.<br>  <br>  <br>  Be well,  there are lots of people that care for you.|`|etXYn0sCaa	If you were none of the above would bother you.

Blood in a dream has many meanings. Some of the most common: <br>  <br>  To dream that you are bleeding represents a feeling of loss of power. You may be suffering from exhaustion or feeling emotionally drained. It may also denote bitter confrontations between you and your friends. Your past actions may have come back to haunt you. Try to avoid any sort of controversy with friends or relatives. <br>  <br>  To stop the bleeding of yourself or others represents a vital, energetic nature. <br>  <br>  Dreams of blood when you can't see who is bleeding means you are undergoing a confusing change in your real life. <br>  <br>  If you dream of donating blood, or having a blood transfusion, you can expect your troubles to go away soon. <br>  <br>  If you see the word "blood" written in your dream, it may refer to some situation in your life that is permanent and cannot be changed. <br>  <br>  To dream of getting a blood clot inside you suggests that you are stuck in a difficult situation and feel powerless to make things better. <br>  <br>  If you dream of passing a blood clot out of your body, you may have recently experienced a personal loss or disappointment. A recent experience has left you feeling tired and possibly changed. <br>  <br>  To dream of having green blood suggests that you are jealous of a friend, or you are having friendship conflicts that are leaving you emotionally exhausted. <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  maybe you should try to open this website it has some exlenasion as well.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://health.howstuffworks.com/brain-and-central-nervous-system-channel.htm" rel="nofollow">http://health.howstuffworks.com/brain-an...</a>|`|16cfcfcb4b4bd764d3763ea612a63cc4aa	I've had the same dreams.  They are horrible!   <br>  Here are some things I think may explain them.  You saw a movie or read a book about a character like that...  You fear that someone might 'get you' and your mind is working about the anxiety.

E3tkOgQiaa	It seems to me that maybe he is denying what you are saying because he doesn't have the same feelings as you. I understand that you are both very good friends but have you ever thought that maybe he is throwing your words back at you because he doesn't share the same feelings?<br>  I once had this friend and she had been having a lot of problems with her boyfriend and instead of him breaking up with her, her would say things (such as your friend had) so that she would be the one who would ultimately break up with him. My point is, maybe he is saying these things because he doesn't want to be more than just friends but doesn't want to hurt your feelings either. I know it might be very difficult considering how close you guys are but it might be for the best to take some time apart to reconsider where you stand with him and to think things over. It also might help him to clear things up as well. <br>  I wish you the best of luck with everything! :)|`|20571e5058e82e6346fea79177111adfaa	Confusion most likely is going to arise from long distance relationships. Every human being requires a sort of in-your-face experience for our inside feelings to match our outside feelings, otherwise we start rationalizing what is real or perceived. He sounds just as confused as you. Men generally want a real-life-can-touch-you experience, so that the feelings he is having can then be put to rest and he can feel as though the relationship is going forward. I would say at this point a conversation needs to be had with both of you throwing all cards on the table and telling each other what each of you really what. In other words...what do we do now at this stage to make this relationship work  ? Time and/or space usually doesn't work if answers to long lingering questions are hanging in the air. Most of the time one or both will just seek something "less complicated." If he is talking about another woman then he is thinking about another woman. Two hours seems like the whole conversation. He may be trying to feel you out on some concrete ways of how you feel that he doesn't sense inside of his core. This other woman may be giving him attention that makes him think he "doesn't know how you feel about him." Is it possible to go and see him or him to come and see you ? It may be the only solution to this situation. Just talk it all out !!!  Decide what you want and ask him what he wants. The fact that he still uses the word "friendship" is probably the source of his confusion. It MAY feel like more to him inside, but he has no proof. I hope that it works out for both of you.|`|Vebih4H7aa	u r mates first b4 anything and u have apologised but u seemed to have opened a whole other can of worms which u didnt really expect . obviously he has used this mini row to vent sum stuff but at first making u feel bad for something trivial. sum people may call this emotional blackmail!!!!!!!!! u know dont beat urself up i bet if u didnt contact him for a bit he would probably contact u first if not hes got other ' endevours' to pursue and hes keepin u on the back burner til hes ready........dont let him keep u hanging on Remember men r like kids they sulk longer and find it hard to make relationships run smoothly .kick back wiv sum other friends 4 a bit im sure he will speak to  u when he sees fit . dont let him play mind games there good at that .hope this helps ..ps 33 and married so have a bit of experience he sort of did the same to me when we where younger i married him at 20 hes still so predictable.......big baby... good luck|`|lTUXdbCTaa	I bet my boyfriend could answer this alot better than I can, because he sounds similar to your friend in a way. But I'll give it a shot. I mean, it would help to know alot more about both of you, but I can guess.<br>  Maybe he wants the friendship to turn into a more-than-friendship and this is his way of hashing it all out.<br>  Or maybe he really does just need space. I have the ability to be very manipulating without even realizing it. So maybe he does really feel like you are controlling him. If that is the case, he probably just needs to work on becoming his own person before he continues his relationship with you (which is a good thing).<br>  Or maybe he likes someone else and thinks that your friendship will get in the way of that, because it would if that were the case.<br>  Overall, if you are really that great of friends and have known each other that long, you should be able to trust each other. Tell him you know this is about something deeper. Don't try to argue back about how you do really care. Just prove it to him by being there for him and showing an effort to want to fix it. If he needs his space, give it to him. But let him know you will always be there for him and you want to work this out.<br>  If I'm just way off base cause of more details I don't know about, feel free to email me. I'd like to help :)|`|fVpcF9Claa	I guess  your friend is having self-confidence issues, which is one of the reasons why he doesn't believe you how much his friendship meant for you. It could also be that he's confused about his emotions towards you, and questioning whether he still wants to be buddies with you or wants more than friendship.<br>  <br>  What i would suggest is; stay calm as much as possible. If he wants space, give him his space.  and in the meanwhile, also think about what do you want, do you want to stay as friends with this guy or want something more, so that if he's unsure about his feelings and one day spills out that he's in love with you, you'll be ready to handle the situation.<br>  <br>  and whatever the problem, if your friendship is strong enough, i'm sure it'll survive and everything will turn out good.<br>  <br>  good luck!|`|YTasscmKaa	Sounds to me like someone is putting stuff in his head.

WK8f0GwBaa	Love at first sight is an emotional condition whereby a person feels romantic attraction for a stranger on the first encounter with the stranger. The term may be used to refer to a mere sexual attraction or crush, but it usually refers to actually falling in love with someone literally the very first time one sees him or her, along with the deep desire to have an intimate relationship with that person. The stranger may or may not be aware that the other person has any such notion, and may not even be aware of the other person's presence (such as in a crowded place). Sometimes two people experience this phenomenon towards each other at the same time, usually when their eyes meet.<br>  <br>  <br>  the say that Cupid's arrows exist. Some studies have shown that love at first sight is certainly possible. But if we tell the truth, we know that all of us like cute guys so it's important to see the difference. After the initial attraction, emotions come into play. There's no doubt that that first arrow makes us interested in getting to know that other person. So what happens when we keep feeling the arrow's affects every day? <br>  <br>  According to science, the 'arrows' are really hormones called pheromones. Pheromones come from under your skin and have an odor that you can't smell, but can feel. Some people are sensitive to certain pheromones and this sensitivity will dictate how you perceive the other person.

Perhaps you like to take walks down the beach, lay down and listen to music, control your breathing and remember everything that makes you laugh. You have to keep in mind that people who put you down are not the best people to have in your life. It is important to be around positive, funny people that will make you better instead of unhappy. As for me, I love to go play music, it clears my head, reminds me of all the good things in life and also helps me realize that if people are putting me down, then they have to be jealous of something.|`|1TPGdaXJaa	First of all I try to be mindful enough to not let myself get caught up in becoming frustrated or hurt by what someone else said. I do this by trying to view the entire situation as it happened, not just through my own first person "self" point of view and how what happened affected just me.<br>  <br>  I have found that meditation has worked for me, though, and that through a regular practice I can usually pretty quickly "shake" any frustrating thoughts that are causing suffering, and just observe that whatever happened, happened, but not let myself really suffer from it.|`|50UbJp14aa	Just keep your mind off it and think of something much more exciting, like what you did on the wekend or something, or go and watch some movies that you like, or listen to music that you like.|`|8cf66894663c74e69b5ed17db7228d97aa	Hey-I always figure I'm not married to them, I'm not sleeping with them (thank goodness) and wonder what their "gig" is, that they have to feel better by putting others down.

I read a book last year and it discusses your question.  <br>  It says that people can only see, speak or give opinion from their perspective.  <br>  <br>  Now I know that sounds basic but people do forget this fact.  <br>  <br>  People say 'if I was in your shoes'. This may sound like they are seeing things from your point-of-view but what they are actually saying 'is what they would do if they were you'....what THEY would do....again from their perspective.   <br>  <br>  It then says because of this fact it is down to you to filter their information.  If it is good information then embrace it, take it on-board stick it in your ego bank and let it make you feel good.  If it is bad information then we simply reject it.  We say 'they can't possible see it through my eyes' and we ignore it.  <br>  <br>  So, if its good we let it in, if its bad we keep it out because they can only see it from their shoes anyway.  <br>  <br>  I don't need people to cheer me up after a put down as I just ignore the put down.  <br>  <br>  I hope this helps and you find your pick-up.

vl0HWTDJaa	Unless you've got a mental disorder which means that you can't control yourself then I don't think it's unhealthy. There are loads of people who get turned on by that kind of thing and the number of people who actually hurt anyone is minimal compared to that. Most psychologists think that people who actually rape aren't at all sexually aroused by it anyway, it's just a power/control thing. So I don't think that the people who rape even belong to the community of people who get turned on by it. Just be careful that nothing you're watching/looking up is illegal because you don't want to be put on a sex offenders register.|`|On57DVlAaa	It is unhealthy because event though you say you would never hurt anybody, you never know how your mind might change and decide to make you act upon them. <br>  When you repress your desires, a second personality in your mind can be created and that other personality can do many things your born-personality is afraid to do. <br>  It sounds impossible but it happens. There are many repressed feelings and desires inside of each and everyone of us, and even though we don't act upon them, they are in our subconcious and will never go away.<br>  <br>  In your case, you are conscious of what gets you aroused and at one point, fantasies won't cut it for you, and you might act on your impulses. <br>  If I were you, I would try to control it. It's not healthy.
YQOT68xFaa	I'm fine with a high school diploma. I care more about intelligence. An intelligent person doesn't stop learning, whether they attend college or not. If he can read and write effectively, if he can understand stuff, if he can hold his own in an intelligent discussion....then I don't care if he has a degree or a college education. <br>  <br>  My husband went to college for a year and then finished his degree through correspondence. He has a Bachelor's in Theology. Some may scoff and say he isn't very smart because his degree isn't in something more "practical", or claim that he's ill-educated. Not so. Dude's freaking smart!! He knows so much about things like science - particularly astrophysics - and technology. He is always reading, studying, learning. I learn many new things from him that I've never thought about before. He can also hold his own in a debate very well, and conversations with him are never "stupid" in tone. Having a degree isn't that important - having an active mind that likes to learn is important.|`|392052a3dbd6d94cc65100310f44fccfaa	Educated? <br>  <br>  Well:1.Good manners.<br>  2.Behaves himself.<br>  3.Polite.<br>  4.Can talk properly and and doesn't lack finesse.<br>  5.Subtle in moves,words,gestures...<br>  6.Can make an essay.<br>  7.Likes to read.(doesn't have to be obsessed with reading,but something THERE)<br>  8.Knows what's going on around him and in the world.<br>  9.Has a mind of his own and more than 2 hobbies.<br>  10.Has graduated high-school.<br>  11.Good social skills.(and i'm not saying that he should be all outgoing and all.He can be an introvert that knows how to handle social situations and people with efficiency and finesse)<br>  <br>  I don't know,that's educated to me.A man who knows how to behave and knows more things than just cars and video games.|`|AA11433436	well, although it may not be what you're wanting, my personal opinion is that a man should at least graduate from college.  this opens doors for him to get better jobs than most of the ones he could get with only a high school diploma.  i should think that the bare minimum be this, and i doubt many women disagree. it also shows he has perserverance and good work ethic to graduate from college, because he went a little further than just what the state expects of him.|`|p0LsYvJTaa	Formal education doesn't matter, but he needs to be curious about the world around him and enjoy learning.|`|KF8CHY2faa	You just don’t get it do you? Anyone who answers any of these questions is giving their personal opinion. So the only answers you will receive will be that of a person’s own outlook on who’s ‘educated’  based on the personal standards that they set for men they chose to date or marry. I personally feel that education can (and does) come in various forms.  To me, anyone who possesses knowledge of a trade or is gainfully employed is educated.  Due to the fact that you have to receive either schooling or on the job training in order to perform the task required of the job. Example, one must attend a certified mechanic school in order to be classified by the state as an automotive mechanic, as well as he must receive his degree in a specific study of medicine to be classified as a medical physician. No matter what title you hold, you must be educated on the specific duties (and how to perform them) before you can complete any task given. <br>  <br>  Although education is key when finding a mate (because it shows a drive for self improvement), it’s not the ‘know all end all’ of a healthy relationship for most women. I’ve dated plenty of men t hat didn’t have degrees, and where employed in fields of manual labor. And to tell you the truth, they where some of the best boyfriends I had.  They were not stuck on the fact that they had degrees that assisted them with earning large amounts of money. And they where some of the most humble, honest, and smartest guys I engaged in a relationship with because they where capable of communicating with people (they had street smarts) vs. looking down on those who didn’t make as much annually as themselves.  I’ve met plenty of people with long titles in front of or behind their names, and they were still as ‘dumb’ as a box of rocks. They where book smart, but had no idea how to treat a woman must less how to treat other people. Money, prestige, and social status isn’t always everything.  <br>  <br>  And not every woman wants the same thing in a man. Some women are willing to just accept a man who has a job, treats her with respect, loves her and honors her wishes (i.e. does what she ask, doesn’t cheat on her or hit her) and accepts her for who she is (flaws in all). We’re not all looking for the same thing in a man. Again, this goes back to what I stated in the beginning; the only answers you will receive from women here will be their personal outlook on potential mates and relationships. So it’s going to be very hard to ‘generalize’ the answers you receive, because each person will answer distinctive to their own needs (no two women are the same). So I really don’t know how much validity these responses will give you since you’re only querying a small group of (assumed) female users, and not every woman worldwide. <br>  <br>  <br>  Edit: And what does being a feminist or non-feminist have to do with the answers you’ll receive? You guys really need to get over this feminist kick that you spout every time you visit this forum. It’s getting really old.|`|WQlNNHuXaa	I personally do not have that kind of criteria when I am looking for a mate. The entire idea of listing the attributes of your ideal partner seems terribly sterile and clinical to me. I do not think people can pick apart a persons' personality in such a way. What I do look for is a natural dynamic, a natural flow, no airs or graces. I suppose what I might consider intelligent and stimulating for me personally is a person who is more philosophically inclined, spiritually inclined, fascinated by human nature and its many nuances and also is passionate about music,opera, jazz, and art. Someone who is sensitive about our humanity and recognises its beauty. I don't have a checklist that I tick off per say, like a job interview.I'm just not that kind of girl!

If you define yourself by your job as a "doctor" and you meet a "road sweeper" by the philosophy of defining oneself by ones' job, you define them too. You overlook the multifaceted nature of human personality, that eternal spark in people that never goes out because you are operating solely on the principles of human ego. This brings misery to oneself and to others. You come to believe, if people are not on the level I am at, then they are not the same caliber or quality of person as I am. Ones' job, while a rather large part of ones' life is also a transient and ephemeral thing of this world and should not determine the inner heart and spirit!<br>  <br>  I would also wager that the most fulfilling parts of ones' life are loving and being loved and developing meaningful relationships. In old age, one does not have a job and a person must rely (hopefully) on the inner resources and substance of character one has cultivated. I think defining oneself by ones' job is as with self esteem about an external locus of control and so when it is gone, you are empty and lack a richness in yourself. Any shift in your fortune and you lack the sort of support that can only come from inside oneself. Many many people do it though.

J4z3mJyuaa	I don't think about it. I just assume they are all disgusting and randomly pick one. I just don't sit on it. <br>  Your husband is probably right for the men's bathroom, though. Men don't generally think as much into things as women do and are more likely to just walk right into the first stall that's open. Of course, that's just an assumption, considering I'm not a man.|`|ccf5ba9811daa4da6cba93a751ab16faaa	I always go to the very last stall, if there are more than two.  If there are two, I use the second.  I am inclined to agree with your husband.  When someone really has to go, they're gonna zip straight into the first stall.  I can't tell you what sorts of nastiment I have discovered in the first stall.  Most people don't feel like walking all the way to the last stall.  I guess it depends on the person.  As for me, I go directly to the last stall - do not pass go, do not collect $200.|`|bszyOuIqaa	I believe the first one is always the cleanest.It seems like everyone bypasses for the second but now that the secret is out I might have to switch up! lol|`|6kENjTH4aa	i agree with u 100%!|`|7c390ff261234da553e65547b674d3efaa	Open the stall door, assess the stall area. Is it clean enough? If not, move on until you find an acceptable toilet. Most importantly....I NEVER sit on an uncovered public toilet seat. Cover it with 2 layers of toilet paper, you never know what germs could be lurking on public toilet seats!|`|YXbCiU3paa	Thinking and talking about this takes up how much of your time?<br>  Just pick one at random - if you open the door and it looks too gross, check another one. And remember - you probably got more germs off the faucet an door handles on your hands than your butt on the commode.|`|NDFN04sqaa	I agree - go to the 1st stall|`|nRFZwdN4aa	The first one, because people want to go to the furthest stall, thinking it is the most private.

Listen to the conversations and the way the people around you are are acting. If they are partying, have fun and party, don't be a buzz kill. If everyone is being polite and calm act the same. Their is a time and place for everything.|`|7TqFISbtaa	My definition of inappropriate behaviour is  to make love to my girlfriend with the light on .......<br>  <br>  <br>     You should learn Scottish , I think we are the only nation who can mis call someone and it still comes across as a term of endearment <br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.firstfoot.com/php/glossary/phpglossar_0.8/index.php" rel="nofollow">http://www.firstfoot.com/php/glossary/ph...</a>|`|WEJIaAobaa	It would help if we knew the circumstances under which this happens.

Every society has its own social standard, so inappropriateness changes from place to place. The general things that have been deemed inappropriate (from what i've seen and heard) are unattractive bodily functions (like burping and farting, unless you're REALLY good at belching in my town), racial, sexist, offending, and just plain nasty jokes or comments, and rudeness (slamming a door in someones face, name-calling, hurtful words, an absence of please and thank you, etc.).
Dfe8oKmpaa	He must want to have sex with me. But im not gay.. thats offensive.<br>  <br>  No really, I think it is thoughtful.<br>  <br>  BTW it is like the toilet seat issue. Only women have a problem with it.|`|6qPTQDdZaa	I'd knock that insulting prick out.<br>  <br>  Seriously it's an act of kindness.  I don't see the opposition to people who do it for you unless they go out of their way to be condescending to you or something like that.|`|kxcDDMw9aa	That happens to me all the time.

I also open doors for people carrying tons of stuff too.|`|nvH62xo5aa	Holding a door out for someone directly behind you is common courtesy.

If they hold it open and I'm way far away, that's annoying. I feel like I'm forced to walk faster so they aren't left waiting.<br>  <br>  And not every feminist is insulted when men hold doors open for them. Are you stupid, or do you just not know many women?|`|NnG8PxMzaa	It's an act of kindness.  I'm a girl, but holding the door open isn't suggesting anything, it's seeing someone behind you and having the courtesy to hold it open for a second.|`|dbgQgYscaa	I don't see either one viewing it as an insult. A woman might act indifferent, if you smile at her as you hold the door, but she's doing that in case you might be trying to put the hook in her.|`|1suTgWGoaa	It seems there is no feminist around.<br>  Every body accept this kind action as it is, <br>  Simple and clean.<br>  <br>  The discussion goes right for every one, when they are not in it.<br>  <br>  The peace, is where the feminists are not.|`|6niE3wSCaa	Act of kindness.

To fail to do so is just rude.|`|d9tCS7BPaa	If another man held open a door for me and there were no women around, I wouldn't view it as an insult.

It doesn't matter whether they're male, female, old, young, black, white, red or yellow.  I do it strictly as a courtesy.|`|uXqDYPNVaa	I want to clarify that I don't see it as an insult, per se; that would require intent to insult.

(presentations, parties, etc) do you have an extreme form of shyness? then you probably have SAD. <br>  <br>  something that tends to help me somewhat is to think highly of yourself.<br>  just keep saying in your head; "im just like everybody else, no one is better than me and im no better than anyone else, im just as good as them", feel confident and handsome/pretty and as long as you really believe it, it will show !

zCHnMeXbaa	Poverty is hard to define.  It can be social, economic, or even psychological in its meaning . I consider it a for of Social Injustice.  Poverty is an injustice because there are the means and resources to prevent poverty.  Poverty exists:<br>   because of an unequal distribution of resources (those who control the resources control the distribution of resources. <br>   because of a pervasive societal belief system that the the causes of poverty are due to a lack of individual participation in society (an unwillingness to contribute through individual effort---this ties in with Oscar Lewis' 1965 theory of the culture of poverty.  Poverty becomes a way of life over several generations.  Basically, poverty becomes institutionalized within the family structure and within the national consciousness.   <br>  That should get you started.  Good luck.|`|QRPvIB8Yaa	Social Stratification and inequality|`|54dc81bbc372d3bb6d12660dc6fc3623aa	I have made and blown fortunes several times in my life. I have lived in poverty and lived in 300,000 dollar homes more than once. Now i am recovering from poverty once again. While the social and monetary reasons for poverty do exist, I find that my own choices have affected my level of poverty more than any outside influences. Many times I have chosen to stay in a less optimal situation instead of making a relatively small change that might have not brought me down. As far as jobs go i have been a ditch digger and a cargo lumper before. though age is setting in on these jobs. I expect to at some point in my life move back down the list though now I have many more job skills to offer an employer. I find the best way to stay out of poverty is not to be tied to one set of skills. Multiple skill sets mean that I can move freely from one job to another and this gives me better overall Job performance in any particular job that I have at the moment.|`|AA12147036	Lack of social skills could lead to poverty.<br>  <a href="http://www.authspot.com/Poetry/The-House-with-All-the-Lights-Off.499093" rel="nofollow">http://www.authspot.com/Poetry/The-House...</a>

So yes in a sense it is a coincidence of evolution. We are 'Designed' to find women uncontrollably attractive, because if we didn't, we'd just go extinct, pretty damn fast.

Women look for money (resources), a big package and some one older to protect them. Men look for nice face, big mamary glands and younger.

vvinM5C0aa	I just think you are unused to having one more girl in the group. Her being there triggers insecurities because you're not the sole female anymore so you stand out less. It's natural.

The drugs all cause such fears and phobias.  Adolescence is just hormonal ups and downs.<br>  No to all and you need to take care of yourself by starting to like and love yourself and trust your judgments.  There is something behind these fears that you need to deal with.  Keep thinking about it and you'll figure it out.  Maybe you are in a situation where you feel unstable and have no power.  Tell yourself, out loud, 5 or 6 times a day positive things like "I'm not going to drown.  Not now and not in the near future".<br>  I think you are probably giving up the power you do have and are frustrated about it.|`|YonedWiEaa	the best answer you may be looking for is your dreams are causing your phobias, not the other way around.  you may be taking your dreams a little serious and it is effecting your state of mind.

Journalism deals with the bad more than the good, because people want to read about the bad more than the good, and also because many people genuinely have bad experiences and want to share them. I agree with woah, she started the story out to foreshadow the ending, you just didnt get it for some reason. Shes right, youre wrong. Thats all.

BLTo4xL9aa	Culture, or in other words, shared learned behavior, is extremely important to anthropologists. Cultures define our populations and introduce the idea of diversity to the world - however, our biology is also very important. When we talk about human biology, human culture, and how they<br>   influence each other, it is known as the biocultural approach. For example, take population growth. This is the ratio between the mortality rate and the birth rate, and varies greatly between human populations. This growth factor is heavily influenced by biology and heavily influences human cultures. Different things can affect the population, such as standard of living, medicine, and nutrition. A North American culture is a better example of adaptation than Northern Africa. These different factors often change drastically from culture to culture, and thus, we need anthropology. Just about anything you can think of can be factored into this approach.<br>  <br>  this biocultural perspective of anthropology is holistic in nature, meaning that it takes into account every aspect of our cultures and our humanity in general. No matter what you can come up with, it is most likely a part of anthropology since the thought comes from a human being. Anthropologists want to know why humans think the way they do, construct societies the way they do, or do anything the way they do. This makes this a very broad field. However, many people are attracted to anthropology because of this. Humanity in and of itself is interesting to many, and anthropology is the best subject to study for such a thing.

CNgVwJgEaa	If this isn't for help with homework or anything sorry for the terminology...<br>  <br>  Social life is EXTREMELY important. It prevents individuals (usually the proletartiat/the underclass) from becoming marginalised. (When you are pushed to the edges of society due to poverty). <br>  <br>  Being marginalised means basically not taking part in social activities such as going to weddings, going to cinema, extra curricula activities etc and so you are isolated from the rest of the society.<br>  <br>  Without this social life and becoming marginalised, you're more likely to suffer from depression, anger problems, volatile relationships, stress etc <br>  <br>  (This is as you are less likely to have close friends, have less people to confide in, have less social skills)|`|CjA02vNMaa	It is obviously not the most important thing but it is one of the important things because of the social interaction with many different individuals.

It's better than aborting the child by a long shot!|`|wkjncmHTaa	Interesting. If men can opt out finanically then yes the same should exist for women. For those women that don't want abortions and that don't want a child, but the father does, then yes they should be able to. The father takes on full responsibility. If neither want the child it gets put up for adoption.<br>  <br>  Personally I can't imagine having a child then giving it up. Seems a bit pointless.|`|3331cf16d944d6e25fdb82bfbdfed4c8aa	Well, they can put the child up for adoption....isn't the net result the same?<br>  <br>  I like the idea that neither biological parent has a right to opt out of financial responsibility.|`|f6f40965eb7d5df6aa94440ec71e32dcaa	Either waive your rights legally or spend the rest of your life wondering what kind of schmuck doesn't take care of their children.|`|3862H0WVaa	Only if she hasn't got a job.
OzPheiN1aa	that they think Nsync are rubbish|`|AA11366224	That depends how you want to define intelligent.  It doesn't mean the same as clever.  Einstein was considered extremely intelligent, but he cut himself shaving every day.|`|TXsHe4Tmaa	There are several different types of intelligences. It just depends also on your definition of ' clever '. See below link.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://professorlamp.com/ed/TAG/7_Intelligences.html" rel="nofollow">http://professorlamp.com/ed/TAG/7_Intell...</a>|`|2Ko12Elfaa	This is actually a very complicated subject.  SSudsy is right that there are many kinds of intelligence and you would probably only be dealing with verbal.  Moreover, in a short amount of time, you would probably see more examples of crystallized intelligence (acquired knowledge) than fluid intelligence (ability to acquire knowledge/problem solving).  But intelligence is difficult to measure.  Even the theory behind IQ testing is far from an exact science.<br>  <br>  There are trends, of course, but if you only look at those, you'll miss out on intelligence that doesn't follow that trend.  There are intelligent people concerned with the world around them, but there are also intelligence people who refuse to read the newspaper (e.g., Thoreau).  There are highly motivated and deliberate intelligent people, but there are also intelligent people who are too bored to try most things.  So the bottom line is that you really can't tell from a couple of meetings and that maybe you should be looking at something else in this person in the meantime.|`|AA11071860	Intelligent people usually use grammatically correct long sentences.|`|0e6dbae94ebf31677d30c3c898c470afaa	They keep quiet, while all around them people bury themselves in opinion.|`|sCaIDGjgaa	being able to spot connections between things that you and others havent|`|PwqwgQykaa	There are different types of intelligence, but some tend to be correlated with each other.  So, given that you are asking about meeting someone, I am focussing on verbal intelligence.  <br>  <br>  If you only met a given person a few times, a large vocabulary is indicative of high verbal intelligence.  Wit and sarcasm are also signs (but for the latter it also demonstrates passive aggressive tendencies).  Overall, their manner of speech (phrasing, level of thought provocation and use of the English language).|`|iOhVWOiGaa	Define intelligence. Some people might not be great at mathematics, but a genius when it comes to art.|`|KHhfcMtgaa	i believe that everyone is clever in thier own way, everyone has something to offer.|`|6IQXxtxSaa	it depends on ones defination of ntelligence and btw..everyones smart in their own way..i mean no 1 can be perfect in all subjects|`|XP4yah8Zaa	Just ask him for a date, if he or she accept it then they are clever otherwise hahaha|`|G96TZerkaa	they dont talk to the rest of us because we are too thick to have a valid point of view.
AA12360662	Dreams come from subconscious mind.   They are vivid because subconsciously you wanted to.   I wrote something recently in my page, perhaps that will explain more if you care to go in and take a quick look, so I won't repeat myself here.|`|AA11984147	Your dreams are unique. No other individual can have your background, your emotions, or your experiences. Every dream is connected with your own "reality". Thus, in interpreting your dreams, it is important to draw upon your experiences from the day, your associations with people in order to help you.<br>  <br>  Remember that a dream unifies the body, mind, and spirit. It provides you with insight into ourselves and a means for self-exploration. In understanding your dreams, you will have a better understanding and discovery of your true self.  Your dreams seem real to you because they probably consist of events from your daily life, or include people that you know, experiences that you have had.  We always dream, it's just that many times, we don't always remember what the dream was.|`|12rDMD9Kaa	There is nothing wrong with your dreaming. Some people say that if you want to forget some of your dreams, you should just tell someone what the dreams were about, and you'll forget about them sooner.|`|ejReQT5xaa	You're probably psychic or something....haha jk.<br>  I don't know what to tell you. When I dream, I barely remember them. <br>  You have a gift, use it...|`|Og5lbX1Iaa	Everyone always dreams.  Anyone who sleeps for more than 2 hours at a time probabaly dreams.

xsyAljhaaa	It's lost it relevance and direction. Maybe you can write some about the oppression of men and how feminists, in the interest of "equality," oppress men who dare to question their dogma of hate and retribution.<br>  <br>  This link may give you a couple ideas:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.backlash.com/book/oppress1.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.backlash.com/book/oppress1.ht...</a><br>  <br>  Maybe you can write about how feminism rants and raves about the objectification of women, but creates a sexist environment which stifles and oppresses information and study of the objectification of men? Here's an unbiased link, very much different than the overtly biased feminist dogma in a few answers down. This link deals with the objectification of women and men, and the effect it has on girls and boys.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m2294/is_9-10_49/ai_110813265" rel="nofollow">http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m2...</a>|`|9VAnsWYUaa	Agree. At least in the West, it is true.|`|YQOT68xFaa	Yep. It`s time to òutsource` it now to countries where women are actually oppressed and have no real rights.|`|V1MptCMiaa	I think feminism in the US and other countries that are similar is pretty irrelevent.  I mean there are still things to fight for like the wage gap but that's not what I consider being oppressed.  But in places like the middle east and in the more 3rd world countries where women can't divorce her husband when he beats her, and the man can have multiple wives but the woman is killed if she cheats, feminism definitely needs to step up.|`|KXQVRQdjaa	Not entirely... there are still some problems, even in the US and Europe.  But I do believe that it is way overdone.  I mean, we've got little boys crying on take your daughter to work day because everyone is telling the girls they can do anything they want and the boys are wondering why they can't!  We really have gone too far the other way, I think, especially with morons like Gloria Steinham claiming that women are victimized by every stinkin thing.  Some feminists claim that every straight sex act is on a "rape continuum."  Even a couple that has been together for years and the woman jumps the man!<br>  <br>  The definition of feminism is believing that women and men are equally capable and should be treated equally.  Unfortunately the idea of feminism has been twisted in horrible ways.  Men still have more advantages than women, but this is ridiculous!|`|NYU37jfGaa	Yes.  In most western countries, women have had equal rights for decades now.  Yet feminists are still moaning about how terribly unfair everything is.  It is time they got some other interests in their lives.|`|AA11828439	That's false.|`|67204bd052a33365d7bd0f82da0dcc95aa	First you need to define modern society...oppression as women is multi layered...women are subjugated on the grounds of gender, race and class, as well as sexuality...<br>  If you define 'modern society' as western then you need to look at relative issues...what is being mooted as a drive to 'substantive equality' - materially, pay parity, legislative equality, but what about cultural attitudes regarding gender?<br>  Second, feminist as irrelevant, perhaps a criticism can be that it has lost its relevance for younger women, and that may be linked to its failure to address issues of race, class and sexuality, but also its failure to combat the backlash against it. Mosts western governments acknowledge that women are not substantively equal with men; check out Equality and Human Rights Commission in the UK, the State Department Equality Duties in the States, even the United Nations websites, but they are pushing a 'gender neutral' stance in policy making as well, that is contradictory.<br>  Women should never mistake greater independence, more opportunities as real equality. Look at the UK's Government Equalities Office factsheets for inequalities in female representation<br>  Lastly, western feminism has relevance working alongside those feminists in developing nations, those women need support, but we can learn so much from them, as the struggle for liberation must be global.<br>  Good luck with the essay.|`|m89kGXBnaa	Not oppressed but still discriminated against, see the source below for some examples.<br>  <br>  Other examples - until recently to be a headteacher you had to have given something like ten years *unbroken* service. So if you happened to have given birth and returned to work, no matter how qualified, you couldn't get the job. This has been changed now, but there are examples of cases of sometimes unintentional discrimination<br>  <br>  There's also stereotypes, which limit both men and women. Women find promotions harder because people assume they will just go off and have kids. Men find getting custody harder, because people think of women as child raisers. So there are problems on both sides being caused by stereotypes, and stereotypes need to be changed.|`|zXPGm2fraa	Read the answers with actual examples, like Chuck who is a man and his wife who is in the NAVY had to deal with it. Oppression of women is still around, the levels vary from place to place, country to country, even state to state. It affects both men and women; if you are a man for instance in a relationship with a woman who is your best friend, and she can't get as good of a job as you even though you have the same skills/degree/experience, how would that affect the relationship, on both sides? And if the essay title was given to you by your teacher, then that's an example right there. It is not gone, it's just not as bad as it was in America, and it's much worse in many other countries.|`|QQQ36jMOaa	I think you need to define "modern society" first.  What makes a society "modern"?  It seems like a rather presumptuous or even arrogant statement to assert that only certain societies are "modern."  One would have to ask is Saudi Arabia a modern society?  Or Iran?  Parts of India?  Women are still oppressed in some of these areas and I think it would be rather arrogant to call these societies NOT modern.|`|AA12022384	The feminist issues facing women now are different from the ones that they faced a generation ago. <br>  <br>  Women still earn less than men this varies between countries, Women across the EU earn on average 17.4% less than men, according to new EU statistics, In the United States it is 13% less than men.<br>  <br>  Women are still under represented in political positions.  In parliamentary positions less than 16% in the United States,  Britain around 20% are women, the only western country with nearly 50% is Sweden.<br>  <br>  Until women have access to good affordable child care, women will be seriously disadvantaged. <br>  <br>  The you have the so called Glass Ceiling "The so-called glass ceiling that prevents women progressing in the workplace is more like "reinforced concrete", the chief executive of the Equality and Human Rights Commission (EHRC) has warned." see article, link below.<br>  <br>  <br>  Hope this helps.|`|imR7Zf5Eaa	You must still be in high school, because that outlook is a little naive. Here in the real world, there is still oppression, its just a little more subtle. Also, if you don't believe that modern society holds women as lesser class citizens, I urge you to educate yourself on womens roles in other countries.|`|C7yjMBuqaa	Women in modern society (especially the one in the West) are very much privileged.<br>  <br>  Feminism was never relevant in the first place, it is an anti-male hate ideology that should have no place in our society.|`|Plu6OVoGaa	It's not that feminism has lost its relevance. Its more that it has lost its direction.|`|GYJLnvhzaa	No, gender equality/women's suffrage still have not been written into the constitution. In modern societies? Which countries are we talking about, or more importantly which societies are we sweeping under the rug? Look at Iran where women are forced to wear the veil and are not allowed to wear makeup/show hair/have long fingernails/etc. Feminism is greatly needed in places like Iran, or in places like some African countries where young girls are kept out of school for fear that they may be raped on their way there. Femism is still very important in today's society. <br>  google feminism today's society, see what ya come up with. Good luck w/the essay.<br>  p.s. Look up Wal*Mart and gender equality/equal pay. Walmart pays women less and uses the excuse that "men have families to support"...wow.|`|p7MM283Taa	I do not agree that women are no longer oppressed. I think a very good place for you to begin your research for this essay would be reading the essay "Oppression" by Marilyn Frye. It is a bit dated, but I think it is still relevant. <br>  <br>  Another resource you may find helpful is a documentary called "Killing Us Softly" which you can find on youtube. It points out gender-specific stereotypes in advertising. My feeling is that, if these representations of women in ads are offensive/outdated/not what everyone believes, why do they sell? <br>  <br>  There are many, many good feminist works out there. I find in my own research I often come across a couple of weirdos - although I am a lesbian, and a feminist, I would encourage you to stay away from most so-called "lesbian feminists." Another suggestion I have is to read work done by bell hooks. She also includes racial and class oppression in her analysis.|`|Ef4rGLGvaa	I disagree. A lot of women still make less money than a man with the same job. And there are many jobs that are viewed as a man's job, still. Women are still treated with less respect than men. Even in the military, despite the military allowing women to serve. My wife served in the Navy and saw this first hand. She let it roll off her back, but it's still not fair that women don't get the same respect as men.<br>  <br>  So no, I don't agree with you. I agree that women are LESS oppressed in modern society, but I don't agree that they are not oppressed at all. And I don't agree that feminism has lost its relevance.|`|QUb0hFAiaa	write about how women still are oppressed, its just not as obvious. for example, there are still a ton of double standards (ex. women's hockey leagues still can't check, which is a huge double standard because the men can check. we're talking women checking other women, which is not different from men checking other men), women making less money at the same job as a man, and the biggest which is men objectifying women's bodies. it sucks when you're trying to be taking seriously and some guying is oggling you.|`|NnG8PxMzaa	There are some situations in which women are still oppressed to a certain degree, nothing in comparison to earlier times of course.  Personally I feel that since things are so much better for women in places like the United States and Europe, feminists should redirect their efforts to bringing gender equality to places where women do not have the same freedoms.|`|Kw3dO045aa	I disagree. Being opressed, we couldn't really be feminine. Now, we can do our hair, nail, etc. Wear perfume. We have sexy, curve-hugging clothes. We actually defined feminism by being less oppressed.|`|172JzgCHaa	no, i disagree. the one and only reason feminism exists is, because women who are sexist bigots......still need an outlet for their hatred|`|O5KOwhovaa	No, because no modern society has reached the point yet where women are no longer oppressed.|`|b9610cdca9c953260b26bc2dd476eab7aa	there is still cases of women being held back because of their female so yes and no since it isnt a huge facto anymore

Yes a psychiatrist can be fired and/or lose his/her license for having an inappropriate relationship with a client.

WRjR4YqEaa	If a person was hurt and betrayed in his or her primary love/family relationships in childhood, the person learns that emotional closeness brings pain, and often when such a person tries as an adult to get close to other people, subconsciously the mind regresses to that earlier time and begins to re-experience and expect that pain. For a normal person, closeness feels good. For an abused person, closeness may bring depression.|`|nRFZwdN4aa	Because romantic relationships carry with them high expectations and are absolutely no guarantee of anything.|`|opwR3BrMaa	You are not confident that's why this happens to you.

Ruifi0GSaa	Hi,<br>  To dream with a friend or friends in it can sometimes be playing themselves or can symbolize a particular quality the two of you share. Can also symbolize a part of yourself that you like.<br>  To dream with your grandmother is a wiser, more mature, feminine parts of self. A need to be pampered and spoiled. Could symbolize passage of time or old, out dated attitudes and behaviors. If you dream of your grandmother that has died, it may actually be a contact dream!.<br>  <br>  And the house means you, your state of mind, the dwelling place of your soul. The state of the house reflects your state of mind.<br>  And with the phone means the lines of communication.

0nHkiSOVaa	It doesn't mean anything.  Think of memory as a giant web (kind of like the internet).  Each piece of information is linked to some number of other pieces of information.  Every time two pieces of information are remembered together, the strength of the connection increases.  The most current theories of dreaming propose that when we sleep (especially during REM sleep) the brain is sorting through new information and integrating it into the existing network.  For example, we have found that infants and children experience a higher percentage of REM sleep than adults do (because they have more new information to integrate).  There is no deep meaning to any dream experience, so don't let it get to you too much.|`|YonedWiEaa	it is a very touchy subject, but in this case it may mean that deep down inside you want to tell your friend something that you are holding back and afraid of saying.|`|OE2t6RDBaa	it means that u r using drug hallucinogens
a3a7528fd9333924ab2d7522df78a2e6aa	1 & 2) Most people study psychology in their undergrad. You need a graduate degree to be a psychotherapist, so you will have to go on after that (most people go 6 to 11 years total). I am in grad school and there is a girl in my class who took English, but has a minor in psych. It's important that you volunteer like crazy to get experience before applying to grad school.<br>  <br>  As for which classes you'll study, that will depend on your school and what they offer. It will likely be intro to psychology, a course on social psych, developmental psych, personality, etc...<br>  <br>  3) You get jobs all over the place. Non-profit agencies, private practice, schools...<br>  <br>  The best thing you can do is to phone your local psychological association. They will tell you what courses you need and what criteria must be filled to be a psychologist in your area. They are also a good resource for finding a job after!

And while they were flying around, they hooked up with some of their other alien buddies (who were flying the barge)...and after they were done doing tests on you they brought you back.<br>  You didn't have any luggage because you weren't supposed to remember any part of the abduction.  But unfortunately you did.<br>  That's just my thoughts.
dc60ff3b5aa807768088e0759e3df6b5aa	Hello,<br>  <br>  (ANS) I trained in counseling & psychotherapy for some years and I have also worked with people with serious mental health problems for the charity MIND here in Leeds, West Yorkshire.<br>  <br>  No.1 OK! in my opinion I definitely DON'T like labels for people, i.e. you are this type of personality or that type of personality. Labeling people can be extremely damaging and I have seen how negatively this can affect people, especially people with serious mental health problems. Forget labels Please!!<br>  <br>  No.2 What you have described about yourself in your posting (question) are ALL value judgments. And value judgment's are highly subjective in nature they are NOT objective, these are ONLY your own opinions of yourself. You have largely described qualities or characteristics about yourself and you have described them in opposing or extreme's (almost opposites). These are very polarized opinions very black & white, either or etc!!.<br>  <br>  No.3 EVERY HUMAN BEING IS SPECIAL, every one thinks they are special this is just our egoistical self talking but every person is different and unique and in this sense special.<br>  <br>  No.4 At 16 years old you are right in the middle of the process called puberty, puberty is a massive process of physical & psychological change, you are moving from childhood into young adulthood. Puberty is a Rite Of Passage and once you move through this rite of passage its like passing through a gateway. Once you have made that shift you cannot go back only forwards in life.<br>  <br>  No.5 Puberty is definitely characterized by massive emotional up's & downs, lots of anger, lots & lots of confusion, depression can also be a part of that process. Puberty can start around 11,12 and last as long as into the mid twenties. Puberty is also a process of discovering a new self identity as an adult.<br>  <br>  No.6 Personality tests would be a total waste of time for you & in my opinion would NOT help you, only leave you more confused. <br>  <br>  No.7 Certainly perhaps some kind of counseling would definitely help you deal with your feelings & sense of confusion about yourself. Either one on one client centered counseling (which you would normally have to pay for on a per session basis) OR perhaps you could try Co-Counseling which is a simple method of self help counseling done with a partner after you have completed a basic training course this kind of counseling is very low cost and still extremely helpful I found. <br>  <br>  **There definitely are groups for co-counseling (x2 types RC or Re-evaluation co-counseling and co-counseling international) a quick Google or Yahoo web search will get you the details.<br>  <br>  **BACP SEE:- <a href="http://www.bacp.co.uk" rel="nofollow">http://www.bacp.co.uk</a> (British assoc counseling & psychotherapy)<br>  <br>  Hope that helps?<br>  <br>  Kind Regards Ivan|`|h3VqVwbQaa	This website has lot's of personality type tests<br>  <br>  www.similarminds.com|`|ZmUGi9PLaa	I think your very "normal" for a 16 year old.

AA12360662	You may be feeling your privacy being invaded in reality.  Projecting being stalked by someone could symbolize some low self esteem or low self confidence.  <br>  <br>  Very often, in dream symbolization, you had things in reverse.  Projecting being talked about tiny boobs you have but in fact you have big ones may reflect the attention seeking in you.<br>  <br>  In other words, you may feel low in terms of look, appearance and confidence, and that is why you had this stalker projected in your dream.|`|874EAxkfaa	yes, you don't want to go unnoticed.

zG6Uuh0iaa	Okay.  So seeing a rabbit in a dream foretells of luck, magic and of a favorable turn of events and a positive outlook in your future endeavors. Alternatively, rabbits symbolize your sexual activity.<br>  <br>  And a wolf symbolizes beauty, solitude, mystery, self-confidence and pride.  Negatively, it represents hostility and aggression.<br>  <br>  So, my best guess would be saving luck, positive futures, and/or a relationship from vanity, aggression, or over-confidence.<br>  <br>  Hope that helps :]|`|mP6ox5f3aa	Obviously American.

mVTGl6HGaa	A social worker, practicing in the United States, usually requires a doctoral degree (Ph.D or DSW), master's degree (MSW) or a bachelor's degree (BSW or BASW) in social work from a Council on Social Work Education (CSWE) accredited program to receive a license in most states. In some areas, however, a social worker may be able to receive a license with a bachelor's degree in any discipline. The National Association of Social Workers (NASW) is the largest organization of professional social workers in the United States.<br>  <br>  Depending on the university, the four year degree may be structured in different ways and draws upon many fields, including social work theory, psychology, human development, sociology, social policy, research methods, social planning and social administration.<br>  <br>  A person with a BSW is considered a "generalist" and the MSW is considered "a specialist or advanced generalist"; a Ph.D. or D.S.W. (Doctor of Social Work) generally conducts research, teaches, or analyzes policy, often in higher education settings.<br>  <br>  Various states in the United States "protect" the use of the title social worker by statute. Use of the title requires licensure or certification in most states. A number of states have different levels of licensure, Maryland being one example.

kSlQsXpXaa	By contrast I'm assuming you mean difference? The difference being that social race is basically in the mind, being something that one group of humans postulated about another group in order to create an hierarchy within society making some groups "better" than others and offers no proof other than the obvious physical difference. Biological race is based on genetics or hereditary factors, things that can be proven scientifically. <br>  Biologically all human beings, despite physical appearance, are all the same. There is nothing that stops us from mating interracially or accomplishing the same mental or physical feats. <br>  The differences between races are societal constructs that have been ingrained within the human psyche for as long as the different races have come in contact; stemming from fear of the unknown. Nothing is legit about it, other than the obvious which is that YES human beings come in different colors, shapes and size. Reasons being that based on where one lives, environmental factors and genetics all contribute to how a human will look, but we are all the same biological. <br>  In a sense, you answered your own question which is due to travel and trade humans were able to open up their sphere of existence and gain the ability to see that there are people out there that are different than the ones they grew up with or from the town next to them. Behavioral differences do not come from race but from the environment one lives in, learned behavior and survival instincts to make it in the area, town, jungle, or war-gripped country that one is born into. Think of it like this you have a puppies born of the same litter one is adopted into a loving family and one is thrown to the streets. Do you think that they will act the same? No, but they come from the same ancestry. You can find more scientific info from this site <a href="http://physanth.org/positions/race.html" rel="nofollow">http://physanth.org/positions/race.html</a>

gkOsA49faa	I still do. That being all the basic things, like opening doors (car, and otherwise), respecting women, sticking up for them even if you don't know them. Its just the way I was raised. Not too many people are raised this way anymore and pop culture doesn't help.|`|1xDtS8wwaa	Chivalry is crap and was crap back in its day. Knights did not follow the chivalric code. The code was made to try and counterbalance all the horror that knights were inflicting on their local populations, mainly pillaging, murder, and rape.<br>  <br>  Rape, you say?<br>  <br>  Yes, knights were thugs. This idea that knights were heroes that saved people are fairy tales. They did no such things. They were enforcers for their higher-ups. They were no different than warlords you hear about today.<br>  <br>  The Arthurian tales and chivalric code were made to try and get the knights under control. When the code failed, a little thing called the Crusades were started in an effort to get rid of all the errant knights.|`|c48xLEolaa	Historical note: chivalry was only about respect for women in songs; in reality, knights were rapists and regularly cheated on their wives. Chivalry had more to do with honouring and serving one's liege lord and one's king.<br>  <br>  No, I don't believe in chivalry; women don't deserve any more respect than men do.|`|VG7k5QRFaa	I don't.  I believe in being kind, friendly and helpful to EVERYONE.  I believe in women's equality and rights and have spoken against chauvinists and anti-feminists in spite of being seen as a male feminist, whatever that is.<br>  <br>  Still, equality means the end of chivalry.  Chivalry was created by men to cover the biases and injustices that they were doing to women while holding their chairs out, opening the door for them or picking up the check at restaurants.  <br>  <br>  In my opinion, the men who want to keep chivalry alive:<br>  <br>  1. Mainly want to be the breadwinner that their wife is forced to lean on because she is stuck at home with a ton of kids and no prospects if she leaves him (Not all men but these types of men)<br>  <br>  2. He also wants to be in total control of society and have mistresses on the side.  <br>  <br>  3. He wants to watch football and hang out while the woman can't have a life because she has to watch the kids even while he's at home.  <br>  <br>  4. He secretly thinks women are inferior because he gets offended if she earns more than him, she's more educated than him or she feels she isn't his doormat.   <br>  <br>  The women who want chivalry also have their reasons:<br>  <br>  1. They want to let guys do the approaching so that they can shoot them down without risk to themselves (which would happen if THEY asked guys out).<br>  <br>  2. They want to slap guys and burn down their houses and the guys have to hang their head because they can't hit women.<br>  <br>  3. They want to file for child support and the man has to pay for everything...not only for the kids but to support her as well (not all women, just these types of women)  <br>  <br>  4. They want to control the relationship by having the man catering to their every whim like bringing them roses or carrying them over puddles while they do nothing for the husband and the first sign that he does something that she disagrees with...he's out the door or he's sleeping on the couch...and if he did that, he'd be considered a bully...as if the woman was his daughter or something.<br>  <br>  I hold the doors open for everyone.  I help fathers and mothers carry carriages down the stairs (though the men sometimes pass on the help since society teaches them that if they need help that is a comment on their toughness or strength).  I give up my seat on the bus / train to fathers and mothers carrying kids or older men and women or disabled men and women.<br>  <br>  I believe that everyone is equal.  And as equal partners in relationships, we should treat each other better than we treat ourselves...not because one gender is superior to the other and we have to do everything to keep the person satisfied or they'll cheat...It's because both people should be in love with their husband / wife and should be willing to do anything to help the other person because that is your best friend and the person you swore to be BEST friends with for life.|`|nLd4mF4Jaa	To be honest, chivalry ended with the end of the mediaeval era, it had had its day.<br>  <br>  And it wasn't what people believe it to have been. The 'knights in shining armour' were in fact rapists and murderers.<br>  <br>  The Hollywood films' depiction of chivalry is way out.

For all the bitching I see women doing about men not acting like gentlemen anymore, most of them sure aren't putting forth any effort in acting like ladies.  On that note, I basically see chivalry as yet another way to hold men to their old gender standards, but we can't do the same to women.|`|C7yjMBuqaa	I'm against chivalry because it leaves men wide open to be exploit/taken advantage of by women and feminists.|`|e87578a8912d84efdea276789acfc11baa	I for one believe in it...I love when a guy holds my coat for me or opens a door,or stands when I enter a room and it has been happening less and less.So sad cause I find chivalry so romantic !|`|t81MEJ82aa	I do, and am not going to change because a few man-hating dykes have a problem with it or today's strong independent woman may not appreciate it.|`|HPqCRBq8aa	I don't.

AA10894849	I am going to be really simplistic. I like to think of Freud's theory as a cartoon. Do you remember those cartoons in which a character is trying to make a decision and then a little cartoon devil pops up over one shoulder and a little cartoon angel pops up on the other shoulder?  During the cartoon, the little devil and little angel are smaller cartoon versions of the main character (so, like a little devil or angel Fred Flintstone).  Then Fred argues with the little devil and angel to make a decision.<br>  The id, ego, and superego are all part of Fred. The id is the little devil. This is the part of you that is impulsive. The id (or little cartoon devil) just wants pleasure and all of his actions are to get pleasure. The superego is the little cartoon angel. This is the part of you that wants you to do good things and makes you feel guilty when you do something bad. The ego is Fred himself. The ego tries to mediate between the id and superego, makes sense of things, and then makes a decision.<br>  If you remember the cartoons, sometimes the little devil won and sometimes the little angel won. <br>  In terms of psychopathology, for people with a strong little devil (id), they are most likely to be substance abusers or have impulse control problems. People with a strong little angel (superego) are more likely to have problems with guilt and over-controlled behavior and are susceptible to things like depression and anxiety.|`|AA10489318	ego and superego are the same with a difference in their intensity.  I do not understand id - is it identity ?  Do not confuse yourself with unwanted things in life.  Concentrate on so many other subjects of interest and enrich your knowledge.|`|AA11526358	the id is the primitive instinctual drives (innate).  at birth we are all id - acting on instincts alone.  ruled by the 'pleasure principle', which is aimed at reducing tension, avoiding pain and gaining pleasure and is driven to satisfy instinctual needs.  the id is mainly unconscous / out of awareness.<br>  <br>  superego is the internalised social inhibitions basically learnt early in life from parents (i.e., socially acceptable behaviour, what you have been taught to believe is appropriate behaviour, moral code, right from wrong, self control etc.  - alcohol basically removes the effectiveness of the superego!!).  it strives not for pleasure but for perfection.  it's primary function is to inhibit the id impulses (pleasure seeking), to persuade the ego to substitute moralistic goals for realistic ones and to strive for perfection.    the superego, then is the internalisation of standards of parents and society, is related to psychological rewards and punishments.  the rewards are feelings of pride and self-love, the punishments are feelings of guilt and inferiority.<br>  <br>  the ego has contact with the external world of reality.  it controls and regulates the personality.  it mediates between the instincts and the surrounding environment.  ruled by the 'reality principle', the ego does relaistic and logical thinking and formulates plans of action for satisfying needs.  as the seat of intelligence and rationality, the ego checks and controls the blind impluses of the id.  <br>  <br>  in a nut shell; <br>  id = natural instincts and drives.<br>  superego = internalised standards of society learned from our parents.<br>  ego = the mediator of the other two (id and superego) into conscious self and personality.<br>  <br>  i hope this helps.  just keep reading about it from as many different sources as possible; it will eventually make sense!|`|PpwRCCvAaa	id- it's the most selfish of the three. When a personality is mostly ruled by the id, it's very vulnerable to "earthly desires". The person most likely see the world as "I, mine, my, me"<br>  <br>  superego- it's acting like an "authority" and thinks for the sake of others and the society. It acts like the moral check of the personality.<br>  <br>  ego- it's the balance between the two. It prevents the personality from being too selfish and being too selfless... it's supposed to be the most "rational" of the three<br>  <br>  Source:<br>  <br>  Just a memory from Psych 101 class|`|fG8QnRexaa	one is spelled  E G O<br>  the other is spelled S U P E R E G O

El sexo es una forma de convivir y de estar con las personas y compartir cosas bonitas.<br>  Porque es un placer.|`|16bf2b4cf7fb7388c58b4956ade2485caa	ENTRAR EN LA ETAPA DE GERONTE ( SE CLASIFICA ASI LUEGO DE LOS 65 A?OS) ES QUERER QUEMAR Y CALMAR EL DESASOSIEGO DE LA PERDIDA HORMONAL A QUE ESTáN SUJETOS.<br>  ES UN CAMINO CRUEL PARA EL HOMBRE QUE HAYA HECHO DE SU VIDA UN CULTO A SU VIRILIDAD.<br>  <br>  NO ACEPTAN QUE TODO LLEGA A TERMINO.

Supongo que lo debiste comprobar experimentalmente a lo ultimo que mencionaste en la pregunta. Mi consejo es ese. Después has lo que quieras.|`|ASGj1oVkaa	?Entonces por que crees que buscaban a alguien mas joven?, obviamente es por el fisico=sexo, no es que todos sean asi pero ya es algo comun que mientras mayor sea las parejas mas natural se convierta llegar al sexo (y lo adolecentes son inmaduros, si como no). esun problema con el que te vas a enfrentar mas y mas conforme vayas ganando edad pero como te comento no es en todos los casos y hay mucho ombres que si bien estan interesados en sexo no lo ponen como requisito, a lo mejor el problema es donde buscas a esos hombres mayores, ?por que crees que existe la expresion viejo rabo verde?.|`|gDLeO1C3aa	porque como ya son mayores ya no pueden tener sexo con tantas mujeres

Segun Marx el capitalismo es un estadío en la historia de las relaciones de producción de la humanidad... no se si te refieres a eso. Pero antes existió el feudalismo, el mercantilismo. Hoy , para mi, quizas la globalización es un nuevo estadío.  Hacia donde vamos no lo sé... si conoces alguno que lo sepa, que avise... :D
RWEyZZXWaa	Why nothing at all.  The idea that dreams mean anything is so hopelessly outdated.  A dream is a subconscious realization of a conscious desire.  So what do you desire?|`|mvPvNtRaaa	sounds like that you may "like" this friend and you are having feeling's <br>  for him/her.
On57DVlAaa	Writing is beneficial to well being because it is a very private, intimate thing. Blogs can be public, and do not offer the same privacy. As a letter, writing expresses many emotions. Handwriting changes with emotions. On a blog, you can't express those feelings... the scratching of a word. The paper. The stamp placing on an envelope. It definitely takes much more effort to WRITE, than to type a letter. :) <br>  <br>  Writing represents personal-growth. Writing down a problem of yours and then seeing it printed with your hand writing helps you see things clearer. It is more relaxing because it's just you, a paper, and a pencil. Nobody hacking into your account. Always with you. You can go back and read your scratching of a word... Online, you can go back and change it.. But on paper, it stays|`|zMRElJS0aa	That's such a good question, hmm..<br>  I love writing, myself, and I think it is really relaxing to write in my diary or write short stories or whatever really. <br>  I think it is kind of sad how blogging and email are "killing off" letters and handwritten things, but you have to consider practicality; typing for instance a novel is much more practical because you can spell check, grammar check, make easy changes, make numerous copies, etc.<br>  E-mailing is a great way to cantact people quickly and effectively. I write tons of emails every day and I chat and everything else, because I live so far away from everyone in my family. I love writing my grandparents in CO, but it takes days, sometimes weeks for the letter to arrive, if it arrives at all without getting lost. <br>  <br>  I read an article once that many people believe love letters are dying out because of modern texting and chatting and email, but it's actually not like that, it's just that as we develop further so does technology and correspondence, I think writing can be beautful even if it sin't by hand, and you should definitely not see it as if writing is being replaced, it's just being modernized and changed a bit in the process:)|`|IqqaA2wIaa	no but all Pisces know its true....keep journals also to remember stuff from a year ago..|`|m89kGXBnaa	It's less about the writing, more about communication: language is a tool to an end, although it's impact goes beyond that. Blogging is less about the effect of writing words and more about the possibility someone will read and respond, it has a very different effect than simply keeping a diary.<br>  <br>  using blogging to cope:<br>  <a href="http://www.liebertonline.com/doi/abs/10.1089/cpb.2007.9930" rel="nofollow">http://www.liebertonline.com/doi/abs/10....</a><br>  <br>  Blogging as beneficial to social interaction<br>  <a href="http://www.liebertonline.com/doi/abs/10.1089/cpb.2008.0053" rel="nofollow">http://www.liebertonline.com/doi/abs/10....</a><br>  <a href="http://66.102.1.104/scholar?hl=en&lr=&q=cache:JpA81Xj8svMJ:citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download%3Fdoi%3D10.1.1.89.1802%26rep%3Drep1%26type%3Dpdf+blogging" rel="nofollow">http://66.102.1.104/scholar?hl=en&lr=&q=...</a><br>  <br>  Blogging as a tool to effect change:<br>  <a href="http://books.google.co.uk/books?hl=en&lr=&id=R2z6xovaNGwC&oi=fnd&pg=PA39&dq=blogging+depression&ots=4nI75CtvkC&sig=te8J4MSandCiOTog3SzAAp3Txyo" rel="nofollow">http://books.google.co.uk/books?hl=en&lr...</a><br>  <br>  Blogging as an outlet<br>  <a href="http://portal.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=1035134.1035163&coll=portal&dl=ACM&idx=1035134&part=periodical&WantType=periodical&title=Communications%20of%20the%20ACM" rel="nofollow">http://portal.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=10...</a>
