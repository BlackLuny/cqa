ZlaxbI33aa	I agree. look at their last Super Bowl Win. He had 120 yards passing with 2 interceptions. His QB rating was 20. 20! He should have not won that Super Bowl or this years but the NFL and the refs love the Steelers and they will continue to get the calls..|`|AA10358665	Did the Defense engineer a game winning drive in the last 2:30 of the game? Did the Defense turn almost certain sacks into 10+ yard pass gains?     "Big Ben" is not exactly Trent Dilfer or Jeff Hostetler here... He made a crucial contribution to the sucess of his team.|`|VuaOKpYXaa	Absolutely    Their defense was  1 in every category  Roethlisberger was  24 in passer rating  and he "won the championship"|`|Irdj2KAFaa	I thought 'Big Ben' had the reputation of being one of the worst QB in SB history??? (Not including SB XLIII)    41.7% passing? My 3 year old can throw better with his two year old sister waiving her arms in his face.    Ben is an embarrassment to Steeler Nation; they tolerate him in hopes he can live up to the hype originated by the press when he was first drafted. I mean c'mon! He was shut down TWICE with goal-to-go situations; another history marker. Now ponder every other goal-to-go situation in SB history..... yea... me too, I can't think of any other QB who sucked that bad with only 36 to 48 inches to goal. The score should have been Steelers 41, Cardinals 23. Their 2nd string QB could have done better.|`|21J0IIZbaa	I agree.  Ben do not have to do much during the rest of his career and he will make the Hall of Fame because of his two super bowl wins.|`|i5MInqeMaa	Big Ben isn't a system QB.  I think his the anti-system QB.  He is at his best when he ad-libs.  But i do agree that the sTeelers defense won the superbowl and carried there team in the regular and post season.|`|XaFYUMRSaa	Great systems win super bowls overrated systems win nothing!So no I don't agree at all.Ben makes great plays outside of any system.|`|812c201aa2d8bada53eda66d1dab2600aa	Ben went on record as crediting his offensive line for the 20 points.|`|AA12103453	He never criticized his WRs. He said he would like a taller guy, his WRs are SHORTER THEN HIM. Miller is a TE and listed as the same size and Spathe as the 2nd TE is taller, but all the WRs are SHORTER. Washington was the tallest they had at that time and is listed as 4 inches shorter. As to not being able to ride a motorcycle, I hope no one ever hits you PROVING YOU CAN'T DRIVE. Dude the person failed to yield to him. He went at a green light and the woman TURNING hit him. OK enough ranting about those stupid remarks, although I'll admit he was dumb not wearing a helmet.  Ben has lead how many 4th quarter comebacks? It isn't all the defense. The D does a lot for him I'll admit/agree. He is on a RUN FIRST offense though. In part because the D, run is a time control thing so when you get a lead you start to run more. I'm not going to say he is the best in the league or anything, just saying be a little more honest about who he is. Yeah I can see being pissed about Eli. I can see being pissed about Peyton as well. Ben didn't get credit in the first one so can't talk about that. I can see being mad about Brady getting Venteri's credit.|`|e2104bb6f4cd0597228a673340a9a643aa	Football games are not won by QB's or defenses alone. They all have to work together and compliment the other to be successful. The defense did its part and the offense, including Large Benjamin, did theirs. Perhaps you should re-think your recipe for what makes a successful football team. Here's a hint:  It doesn't include sour grapes.|`|sMssDP1Xaa	Who is giving Ben credit for the win?  The MVP was Santonio Holmes not Ben.  He did run a helluva drive in the final minutes of the game.  What has the QB of your team done lately?
9bbda51d0fa9171f8b54abcba95b5f95aa	My GOD you are so right I saw the refes getting money from the steelers right before kick off and then every time they made a call Tomlin slipped them more.The Roony family is sending them all to Disney World and paying for their kids college.|`|AA11515684	Yes. 96 yards of penalties that kept Pitt drives going? Im shocked they only scored 27 points. They have zero run game.    Penalties were ridiculous, as were the non-calls against Pittsburgh.    Roughing the passer against Roethlisburger? Are you kidding me.. he was already in the air before he threw the ball, and still barely grazes him. Ridiculous. It took a punch from a Steeler to finally get a flag against them late in the game.|`|9XxQJLqUaa	and they ddint call two intentional groundings on pittsburgh but instead they could holding on ariozna and on the play they called holding when is was int. grounding on the steelers it was a false start on steelers, and then at the end of the game when it was lke 3 and 6 and steeelers had the ball it was a blatant holding call on pitts burgh which would of won cardinals the game they didnt call it|`|7de370467c1bd78c2289f9e195b0bb85aa	THERE DEFINITELY SHOULD HAVE BEEN A PENALTY ON SANTONIO HOLMES ON HIS TOUCHDOWN CELEBRATION. THE SO-CALLED FUMBLE SHOULD HAVE HAD THE TWO MINUTE REVIEW. THE REFEREES WERE AWFUL . I WOULD LIKE TO POINT OUT THAT THE ROONEYS ARE BIG SUPPORTERS OF B. HUSSEIN OBAMA WHO HAPPENS TO BE A STEELER FAN SO THE FIX WAS IN ON WHO WOULD WIN THE GAME.|`|AA10358665	The reffing was pretty "ticky tack" for both sides. It's not like their last Superbowl vs. the Seahawks where EVERYTHING went the Steelers' way.     They called Pitt for a holding penalty in their endzone resulting in a Safety, for crying out loud.|`|i5MInqeMaa	There should be an investigation into kurt warner throwing INT's for TD's.  And the Arizona defense should win the oscar for best supporitng cast in  a super bow.  They made big ben look like joe montana on that last drive and santonio holmes was dwight clark.|`|a6EndAPiaa	Yeah I mean they over turned both of the Cardinals challenges in favor of the Cardinals.  Oh yeah do not forget about that safety that they refs called on the Steelers on a questionable holding penalty.    You are right the refs were totally in favor of the Steelers.    LOL come on 7 penalties for the Steelers and 11 for the Cardinals is not exactly partial.  Were you watching the same game I was?    --- Edit  for those people who thought the were intention grounding did you actually watch the game?  The analysts actually drew a line on the screen where the edge of the pocket was and then showed that Ben was about 1 yard *outside* the pocket.  LOL keep grasping at straws and getting air?|`|812c201aa2d8bada53eda66d1dab2600aa	How many days do you think everyone is going to whine?  i think that is the better question...|`|bed9746a7bf18f598324f858a93ae28eaa	for sure|`|uOVsCWdNaa	Wow, dude, get over it. The best team won ok?|`|AA11108627	I mean, come on, as a matter of fact the refs were NOT from Pittsburg.    I mean, come on, the refs were chosen as the very best in the league to officiate the most important game of the season.    I mean, come on, you may have not liked the officiating, but no game is officiated perfectly.  Unlike us, they only see things in real time, and don't have the advantage of slow motion instant replays, like we do.  Players from both teams would complain some calls were missed & some penalties weren't called.    I mean, come on, they can only see one place at once, while we have the benefit of hundreds of cameras looking everywhere at once, some with incredible close-up views the refs could never see.    I mean, come on, in spite of the officiating, all the Cardinals had to do to win the Super Bowl was prevent the Steelers from moving 80+ yards on their last drive with just over 2 minutes to go in the game.  Then all the officiating issues would have been moot.    And there were no blown calls during that drive, were there?  And the most imporant play in the end zone was carefully reviewed before confirming it was a touchdown.    I am not a Steelers fan.  But I can say you can't blame the refs for their victory.  If the Cards didn't throw that costly interception (or at least tackled the guy after he made it) they would have won.  OR if they made a defensive stop in the last 2 minutes they would have won. The refs were not responsible for that.    Cards gave a good fight, but they came up a little short.  Deal with it, fans.  My favorite team once lost a Super Bowl too.  Let it go, and better luck next year.|`|sMssDP1Xaa	No|`|AA10776364	I agree there were bad calls, but it wasn't favored for either team.  Two of the personal fouls on AZ (running into the holder and roughing the passer) were terrible calls, but so was the personal foul on the guy from Pit when he pushed the AZ guy.|`|9vLzGwVqaa	There should be,but they won't.
AA11209233	I'll have to give it some time to sink in to decide it was better than last year's, that's tough to call--both games were great.      Those two games are definitely the best superbowls we have seen in many years.|`|9vLzGwVqaa	It was terrible,the game was so rigged for the steelers and the commercials stunk!|`|yQq1LSyTaa	It was a really good game, and I'm happy with the win|`|AA11110524	it was probably a better overall game, but theres no way it toped last years game.|`|AA10776364	How can the guy above me say AZ def didn't show up?  Besides the last drive, they were giving Pit all they could handle.  How many Goaline stops did they have?  They forced a safety.      To the question at hand.  Yes, I think it was a pretty awesome Super Bowl myself.|`|oWYs6Btgaa	No- I've seen too many great games. To name a few:    Super Bowl V- Baltimore Colts 16 Dallas 13 **No mistakes- both teams fought hard in a classic game of running and field goals. Unitas and Morton exchanged TD passes in the 1st half. Just a gritty game.    Super Bowl XXlll- San Fran 23 Cinci 16- **Montana drove 92 yards in 190 seconds to win it. Vintage Montana- further to go with less time than Ben had last night- against a much better Cinci defense    Super Bowl XXV- NY Giants 20 Buffalo 19. **Norwood was haunted by that missed FG as time expired for many, many years- as are the Buffalo fans    Super Bowl XXXlV- St Louis 23 Tenn 16. **Warner hits Bruce for 73 yd. TD then the Defense holds off Tenn at the one foot line as time expired    Super Bowl XXXVl- New England 20 St. Louis 17. ** A 14 pt. underdog Patroit team shows that defense wins Championships in their first SB win with a late FG to steal the game away and stop a Kurt Warner second half comeback.    Last nights' game will be marred with poor officiating, (costly mental errors from both teams) inconsistent play by Arizona's Defense (you don't fold on the final drive of the SB) and Pittsburgh's Offense (showed up when it mattered most) I tip my hat to Big Ben for making plays he had to make and to Holmes for making the grabs and keeping the drive alive)    Last Years' game was vintage and an instant classic. Eli Manning had the game of his life and New England could only shake their heads because they played a helluva game too and came up short to a team that wanted it more.|`|AA11515684	No. Last years was ridiculous. Talk about David beating Goliath.  Game kept you on edge of seat til the end.    Yesterday, AZ defense was nowhere the whole game.. everyone knew Pitt would score at least 3. Great catch, but who didnt know Pitt would score.    Thought penalties were incredibly one-sided as well.|`|kH8yYBAcaa	i'm sure you're happy if you were rooting for the steelers. but be realistic, if the same calls would have went AGAINST the steelers, would you have been as happy if they lost because of them?|`|AA10358665	A really good game, but you're not going to Top the Rams v. Titans.     Over all, I'd say that since that game, there has not been a really BAD superbowl (except maybe Eagles v. Patriots).
X7IsNqI7aa	Matte tights::::  they are more subtle to the eye. They give a completely flat look on your leg, with no reflection. They just make everything look uniform and tight with no blemishes.    Shiny:::::  Shiny hosiery feels smooth while on your legs and catches the light. Great for special occasions, but can also be worn as everyday hosiery. Very shiny hosiery will draw even more attention to your legs as the light reflects strongly off the hosiery, defining curves. Not suitable if you want to go for the "bare leg look".
cd51ab07fbecfef33f286305112484c4aa	I agree there were bad calls during that game.|`|21J0IIZbaa	AZ had bad calls against them.  The roughing the passer called was a bad called.  The last play of the game should of been review longer.  Warner's arm was moving forward.  The play should of been call incomplete with five seconds left in the game.|`|a6EndAPiaa	There were 7 penalties called on the Steelers and 11 on the Cardinals.  Yes the Cardinals committed more penalties but 11-7 is not a huge difference.    Someone would be complaining  that the ticky tacky penalties were not called if they were not.    I am watching the NFL network post game show and Warren Sapp is saying that the hold in the end zone which resulted in a saftey was not a hold.    There is always going to be a debate about individual calls the refs called a fair and balanced game.    -- Edit  to the person above me who thinks that the refs should have looked at the "holding penalty" during the interception return.  Holding is not a reviewable penalty.|`|BBLofuApaa	lol....that roughing the holder penalty is what got me, i never knew a player could be penalized for that|`|KhBmlaefaa	Yeah, should have been more on Cardinals. They are lucky they didn't get called for every penalty they made. They got away with a lot, if you ask me. Just like they got away with a lot the whole playoffs.|`|OWfU0OdLaa	The refs won this game for the steelers just like they did against the seahawks. I'll keep bitching about it cuz it's true. The hawks should have won that game but the refs gave it to the "steelers". Just like in this game!! That TD run had 2 major blocks in the back that were not called against pitt. roughing the holder?!?! Anyone could see that he was off balance from being hit by the pitts guy which led him into the holder. And when did this sport become such a pu$$y game!?? It's FOOTBALL, aren't you supposed to hit people?! BS call on roughing the passer. Oh well, all the cards had to do was stop them for one series and they failed to do so. Steelers are not the best and people know it|`|fXdJlsoAaa	there were 106 yards to the cards and less then 30 if you don't count the 15 yard penalty that wasn't worth anything in the last quarter.  No matter how you look at it.  The refs did call a bad game.  You can find holding calls on every play but those refs failed to call a "fair" game.  The pits are KNOWN for their penalties and yet they get the least amount all season...huh? weird.  Anyone else smell bias?|`|7yIdHlWUaa	Yeah i totaly agree. And did you see when the Pittsburgh player ran 100 yards? One of the defenceman should have been called for holding but the rafs didn't even THINK to look at it. Finally i find someone agrees with me.|`|9XxQJLqUaa	agree and thye called holding on arizona like 20 times when it wasnt holding and how about those intentional grouding that ben throw but instead they gave a roughing the passer and holding on cardinals. and when there was like 2:00 minutes left and pittsburgh made a catch and then 1 of the guys gave the ref the ball and the ref started clapping for the steelers player and said something to him|`|dITS53lIaa	Remember super bowl XL? The refs have a hard on for the steelers.|`|4ScZHFNHaa	I am not questioning it over all but the first half the callings really changed the game and had an effect overall IMO.  It may have ended 11-7 in calls but the first half was almost all against the Cards and most the yardage they had in penalties.      It is hard to compete when it is 18 versus 11 on the field
myowRSBAaa	It doesn't take a great coach to win a Super Bowl, but it takes a competent one.  Reid just isn't competent.  A coach should be judged by how his team performs in the biggest games.  Reid is 1-4 in NFC Championships and 0-1 in the Super Bowl.  That tells the whole story.  Of course the same record applies to D-Mac, so if I had my way, I'd dump them both.  I know you're a D-Mac fan, but that's my honest opinion.    This question should be answered only by Eagles fans, not by Giants fans pissed off that the Eagles knocked them out of the playoffs or Cowboys fans who are crying because their team didn't even make the playoffs.|`|f7qVtYfaaa	i have heard that he has dedicated himself to a winning season and is working out every day toward that goal and will replace klecko at full back and it is very likely he will score the winning super bowl touch down next season! goooooooooooooooo andy !|`|0f5cc27a5aca75cf6162b2cbb88fc13caa	Im a Cowboys fan( how am I crying as am told by the guy below?) he is a great coach an deserves it on my opinion.  Its a TEAM game but people dont realize that.  Remember when Larry Brown coached the Pistons an they won a title an people were like "oh my God he is so great as a coach"?  Well have you heard his name since?  So does that mean he isnt a good coach anymore?  People are just stupid. I gotta tell you, if he was the coach of the Steelers, he would have 2 championships right now.  ANYONE could have coached the last 2 Super Bowl games for that team an won|`|sMssDP1Xaa	Doubtful.|`|pgdNUFt1aa	THEY ARE LOSERS AND SO ARE YOU!|`|juQY6M66aa	How can people in Philly call themselves fans if all they do is complain about their team even when they do good?  You guys are terrible fans.    And Andy Reid is a good coach...  May be the fattest most disgusting coach I've ever seen, but he knows the game.  If he relies on a good defense and recognizes the importance of a good defense, he's on the right track.
a6EndAPiaa	Honestly it was a fumble.    Empty hand moving forward is a fumble 100% of the time.  That is the rule.  If it was reviewed for 2 hours it still would have been a fumble.|`|AA12103453	What Brady did has nothing to do with this game. No one heard of the Tuck rule before that and it magically became a big thing in the NFL after that. Up until then everyone knew the rule properly, now people seem more confused about it.  When the arm when back the ball was knocked loose. A QB must have control of the ball as he moves his hand forward. Warner didn't have control of the ball as he moved his hand forward, making it a fumble. Yes the ball was on his hand as his hand first came forward. It was already loose though, it has to be in the QB's control.|`|f7qVtYfaaa	i do think it was very close to a pass and should have been reviewed|`|xGofrX5Iaa	It at least should have been reviewed.|`|KhBmlaefaa	Yes he fumbled. Per rules, it was a fumble.|`|9vLzGwVqaa	IT WAS NOT A FUMBLE!!!|`|AA10776364	Regardless of whether it was or not, a review was in order.  If only to avoid conversations such as these.|`|6KZgeq3Maa	The head of officiating commented immediately after the game that the play was reviewed and the fumble was confirmed.  The ball was knocked out of his hand before his arm was going forward, the fact that the ball was by his wrist as his arm went forward gave the impression that his arm was going forward and it was an incomplete pass, but anybody that isn't a jaded Cardinals fan and has any knowledge about football will tell you the call the correct.|`|QEYFU5Lvaa	It was a definite fumble, replay would have upheld it without question.|`|5FiO6aNCaa	I dunno, I didn't see it enough...that's THE POINT. How could they have reviewed it that quickly? I'm completely neutral in this game, but I thought that after the (maybe 2) replays that I saw, yes, the ball got hit prior to him throwing it, but did it move in his hand? Did he lose control of it before he moved his arm forward? I dunno, I didn't think so....|`|b22Pz4xSaa	Sure looked like a fumble to me. As soon as the linebacker hit his arm which was still behind his back the ball was loose. He did not have control of the ball. I can't get over all the complaining over a game. Arizona fans where was your offense for the first three quaters of the game? You come alive for one quater and want a win???????? Quit crying and look forward to next year. Steeler fans enjoy the win. It was an entertaining game.

Tyree was rarely used during the season.  Tyree had four receptions for 35 yards during the regular season.

You can talk about meaning or anything else, but this is about the better CATCH to me. Tyree had to catch it against his helmet and hold it until he got proper control. He had Harrison trying to knock it loose and they were falling to the ground. It was really an impressive catch. People will say well he got lucky. No amount of luck will allow you to control the ball like that. That was hard work.|`|c4b596d15eac948f611f72b6a99f85a0aa	Tyree. Trapping it on his helmet with Harrison draped on him was insane.|`|f7qVtYfaaa	tyree's catch was simply freaky ,it was defying physics almost so i would say it was the better ,game changing catch.|`|bed9746a7bf18f598324f858a93ae28eaa	tyrees|`|sMssDP1Xaa	It's hard to say.  They were both clutch catches when the teams needed them most and allowed them to win.|`|HPqCRBq8aa	Its not even close. Tyree's catch, the play, the teams, and outcome made his catch a whole lot better than Holmes catch last night.|`|NpGisDoCaa	Not to discount Holmes's catch and it's meaning for the game, but the better catch is clearly Tyree's.  I have seen people make the catch that Holmes did.  Tyree's?  Unbelievable, and a one-in-a-million effort and play.  It amazes me every time I see it.|`|6KZgeq3Maa	The catch itself taking away the game situation, Tyree's.  Holmes's is a close second though....|`|hcEgEbXvaa	Tyree's catch was PURE LUCK, Homes was TALENT
pYKRoKK6aa	it is crazy how long the games actually last for but if you have ever been out there for yourself it is the most draining and tiering game there is. i myself played in high school and i am in very good shape, but still playing in a football game feels like an eternity. especially if you play on multiple sides of the ball. offense defense and special teams. next time just try and calculate how long one player is on the field|`|2abfad154b1ab0f34ede4ce75b2a0167aa	Just as I suspected, football players are a bunch of bums.  Well done.
G9LSZQcaaa	I predicted Steelers-35                   Cardinals-24    6 TIME  CHAMPIONS BABY!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!|`|21J0IIZbaa	I was going for the Cardinals because I'm a Rams fan and wanted Warner win another Super Bowl|`|k2fFfNtRaa	Steelers of course, 6 time winners.|`|mpYqEw2oaa	steelers 27, cards 23! steelers will win in last 35 seconds!|`|KnGJ12cqaa	I bet on the Steelers, because i'm a Charger fan, and i knew a month ago that was the one team we didn't want to deal with.|`|AA11108627	Hey!!  I wasn't going for either team.  The game is a lot more enjoyable to watch that way!!|`|uOVsCWdNaa	Steelers all the way! I knew they were going to win the Super Bowl before they even made it to the Super Bowl lol|`|ba1e04e87018a07f503638c0d9ff41eaaa	I was going for the Steelers too.|`|Rb1bwBC7aa	Steelers!|`|kH8yYBAcaa	all i wanted was a good, clean and most of all, evenly called game. it was good, somewhat clean, but i really question how evenly called it was.|`|Fer4ZrnXaa	STEELERS|`|bjR2uWAWaa	Steelers!!!!  6th ring!!|`|AXoEgmnSaa	I gotta admit I was cheering for the Cardinals, but I'm happy for the Steelers|`|AA11515684	AZ.. tired of Pittsburgh fans..shameless.
4284e409c8e26999c7eb4ffd92352976aa	For sure that would be pretty interesting as Kofi Kingston is part of WWE's future and a definite future main eventer.But i can't see him winning the WHC title in his first Elimination Chamber match at NWO.For sure he's going to put on an entertaining performance in the match, but i think Chris Jericho is going to regain his World title from John Cena.|`|AugWKsuJaa	Of course this is NOT going to happen since Kofi is nowhere near ready for a world championship run, but if he did, it would be in my opinion the most shocking result in WWE history.|`|k2fFfNtRaa	I doubt he will.|`|nzKo4TFvaa	LOL  never he is just a mid carder|`|Nmjjqoybaa	BREAK MY TV OR SUICIDE|`|3icTrKLLaa	He is a great wrestler and great athlete but it would be way too soon for him to win it. He would then lose it at Wrestlemania if not sooner to a mega star, then would be pushed back down to mid card status. Also, he would probably never get another big push. It would be cool, but it would be unfortunate at the same time.|`|WQGvE60waa	I would't like it becuase it is too soon. Just like it was too soon when CM Punk won it.    if you ask me Kane deserves a push like that who agrees|`|cjknXzm9aa	i'd be stunned and confused.|`|LhDL1RRhaa	Well.... If SUICIDE is an option, Ill go for it|`|O6VTWYDtaa	kofi willl be first eliminated|`|dbc3503ab379d3f8b3803c2488ab5e36aa	If CM Punk can a title reign why can't Kofi, they guy has the wrestling ability why not let him have a shot. Plus some new needs the belt|`|VQlrQ34Faa	I would stop watching RAW.
i5MInqeMaa	Agree with the guy above me.  AZ coverd the spread.  I know i'm happy.|`|D4GHgDl4aa	This was probably the best super bowl of all, no whining required . Both teams played well but only one can win. I think it might have been appropriate to eject Harrison for his stupid brawl, the only negative in the game.|`|WrDGhduxaa	No, if they all bet on Arizona plus 7 then they are all winners.|`|0f5cc27a5aca75cf6162b2cbb88fc13caa	it has, an the gates of hell are breaking apart at the seams becaues Satan needs to create room. He loves deceit an lies, which is exactly what the Super Bowl was|`|f7qVtYfaaa	well they need the rain fall so it is a good thing|`|l0iCqzlQaa	no but i heard that Pitt is currently over populated due to the bandwagon fans going to the parade.|`|G9LSZQcaaa	Yep, Probably the deserts are full of water now, and the US Airways center is flooded because of tears.|`|9XxQJLqUaa	it is im from az and we had alot of people over our house and we all got so happy when fitzgerald got that touchdown, i felt bad for fitzgerald cuz he really deserved it
cOPCNP7Laa	And Im laughing :D haha|`|GjpWEu6Raa	NEARLY AS BAD A JOKE AS ARSENAL SPENDING A MONTH TRYING TO GET ARSHAVIN     that and carlos costly going to birmingham on loan lol|`|5c0ea2e937929dc820b4f96293aa83a2aa	ha ha... He should have gone a month ago!!  Keane and rafa!!!|`|FG9fIQL3aa	especially with a loss of 8mill!|`|mxA0tYppaa	NO....please let him stay....he's given the other clubs supporters a great laugh...|`|bNykcEVXaa	That was absolutely ridiculous      dR bad  it made both Spur & liverpool a laughing stock|`|jiFHJ6daaa	it time for SAF and CR7 to retire|`|nJ5kceMBaa	Apparently, Benitez never wanted Keane. I thought it was a strange signing when it first happened. Not Benitez's sort of signing. And what do you know, it didn't work and proved to be a complete waste of money. Maybe this shows that the board should put MORE trust in Benitez's transfers.    But as for other aspects of his managment, I wouldn't cry if Benitez didn't sign a new contract.
IlDD3qumaa	Liverfool cannot win the league with any of their mediocre players.|`|OYYYNCyCaa	Liverpool can not win the premier league at all    does not matter what bum they bring in|`|Gr99OjQuaa	just one less fan in the stands... im sure they can manage without him    he wont do much at tottenham either, he was good with berba now he'll have to get aquainted with pavelachenkyo, as well as the plethora of new players|`|jiFHJ6daaa	torres= 10 x keane|`|nJ5kceMBaa	Really? I am absolutely relieved that we're rid of him. We don't have to pay his wages now, AND we don't have to have a big fuss every time he's on the bench. I personally think Keane was utter sh*te during his time at Liverpool.|`|xvuAQ0DAaa	Liverpool cant win the Premier League period.....!|`|duJgBxUoaa	Learn to type.|`|fEWhwumZaa	Funny how before we couldn't win the league with him, now it's without him..|`|t2nObP1aaa	depends, if they go for the prem alone and not champs league, the striker will hav enough energy, but rafa will try to do both and fail because of lack of energy
0VBdup3Caa	LOL if leinart was is i dont think the cards would have scored at all lol.|`|AA10358665	If he didn't throw that pick, he wouldn't be Kurt Warner|`|AA11515684	No way. Leinert stinks.   That play was great Defensive scouting by Dick Lebeu Pittsburgh D coordinator. Best Coordinator in NFL by far.  Pitt Head Coach should mouth service him 2x a day.|`|PwED69Isaa	Oh please.. Leinhart should be their  3 QB... Pierre is even better than him.|`|3s59vsLNaa	Either Leinart, Leinart's buddy, or someone from USC must have posted this.  That's the only way one probably could not have seen how well Warner actually did.|`|OWfU0OdLaa	so he threw a pick, but if the refs would have called 1 of the 2 blocks in the back that happened during that play by the pitts, the cards would have won. Once again, refs win the SB for the "steelers"|`|Roes9U61aa	Your crazy, Leinart would have thrown them out the game way earlier, Mr. Holmes catch wouldn't have meant anything because the steelers probably would have been up by two td's leading up to that point. Stop Slurping him.|`|0f213e569404219f01d20decc3749462aa	Warner played good. You should be blaming the coverage on the Holmes catch, as to why the Cardinals lost. That or giving credit to Holmes.|`|wMh38OzVaa	No way.Warner did the best he could and that's all he could do.We could only guess what would have happened if this happened or that happened.|`|gWleYSuIaa	You are crazy -without Kurt Warner the Cardinlas wouldn't have even made the play-offs|`|l700dey7aa	he also threw 3 td unlike ben he threw 1 td and 1 int . kurt is human we all make mistakes. it did cost the game but the cards D should have brought there game in the final 2 min of the game. you are so stupid to fell like this. it is a game get over it|`|1oj4aamaaa	Nice try.  Steelers made an excellent defensive play.  Warner had his team in the game 'til the very end.|`|UQLNP6iyaa	He threw for the third highest number of yards in SB history, no one has thrown for more yards than Kurt Warner in any single Superbowl ever, threw 3 TD's, completed 72.1% of his passes and achieved a 112 QB rating and you want to replace him in the Superbowl with the league's current biggest draft bust?    That may be the stupidest idea in the history of dumb ideas. Ever.|`|5d77c66b171b12a5932576b2dc7b7dd3aa	you are an idiot
UQLNP6iyaa	Taking an example from college football, it could be a while. Texas fans are still crying about a national championship game they didn't even play in and Oklahoma fans blame every loss they've had in the past 4 years on referees.    I think the average NFL fan is a little less sensitive than that. However, Seahawk fans, still sore about their team's just awful performance in the big game, are still whining that it was the refs 4 years later, irrespective of the truth, so I guess there are always exceptions.|`|H7AcXAyaaa	3421|`|mpYqEw2oaa	ONE OF BEST EVER? NO WHINING ALLOWED!|`|AA12103453	Let's see 365x3 is 1095 + 1 for the leap year and you get 1096 days of whining for Superbowl XL, and counting. I'd say at least 1000 days for this one. Perhaps it will span Obama's First term(not saying he will get a 2nd, just writing the it correct way so don't bring in politics).|`|wYdHeAE9aa	nfl losing it's credibility with lopsided calls like this. i'm disappointed, even though 'm not a fan of the steelers or cards. the calls were close, i did see a lot of no calls benefiting steelers, that angered me.    nfl get it right! the right call was to let them play.|`|YAiKlPkMaa	Days? I'm thinking more like months.|`|AA10776364	No matter who would have won, there would be whining.|`|sMssDP1Xaa	Until Super Bowl 44 and then it will start all over again.|`|AA11802580	Probably not until next season starts...|`|bjR2uWAWaa	It has been lasting the past 3 years for the Seahawk fans, so mabye the whining Cards fans will too!|`|6KZgeq3Maa	With the sore losers that were forced to eat crow last night....I'm guessing at least a month|`|cDKkKEgvaa	Probably forever.........I still hear crap about the tuck rule in the 2002 AFC Championship game so....|`|0VBdup3Caa	idk sucks for arazonia fans tho they get cheated in the superbowl there basketball team cant win the division (LAKERS :) and baseball team plan sucks lol so this was there one chance to celebrate and they get cheated. i kinda feel bad for them.|`|QEYFU5Lvaa	I give it a week, by then all the non-existant Cardinal "fans" will be off the bandwagon and forget they even have a football team again.|`|AA11515684	Thats what real winners say.. they rub their opponents faces in it.. classy Pittsburgh|`|c491d9efff649c3e2e0ff167a363a97daa	Probably until next major sporting event(March Madness?) or the NFL Draft
0f5cc27a5aca75cf6162b2cbb88fc13caa	Im going with Steelers fans becaues of this...........they wont acknowledge they win with help from officials.  31 NFL teams fans are complaining an the Steelers fans are the ONLY ones saying it was fairly called.  Cardinals fans are backed my MILLIONS of people who are outraged right now an definetly arent alone.  After years of being a poor team, to get to the SB an have it yanked from you, its just ridiculous|`|AA10776364	Agreed.  I am a Card's fan, and I thought it was an awesome Super Bowl.  The officials made bad calls but it wasn't partial either way.  AZ beat AZ, plain and simple.  What I really took away from this game, is that AZ proved they deserved to be in that game.  They played Pittsburgh tough, especially in the last 10min of the game.  Kudos to both teams for putting on an incredible show.|`|UQLNP6iyaa	You're right they are equally annoying. Whingers to the left, gloaters (over an utterly unconvincing performance, no less) to the right. You just need to stand in the middle and plug your ears my friend.    Oh, and you are so right about Harrison, as Madden said, he should have been thrown out.|`|AA11802580	I think it's kinda funny that everyone gets so worked up about a game that has no effect on their lives...unless their bookie's calling.  If the Steelers would have lost, they'd be bitching just as much as the Cards fans.  However, I must say that when the Steelers are in a crunch and the clock is ticking down...they have the ability to turn **** into gold.  That's how they roll...they may play shitty throughout the game, but when it matters, they deliver.|`|QEYFU5Lvaa	I'm an Eagles fan and I feel the game was evenly called.    The only fans I know that are upset by this are the Cards fans who are mad they lost and who will likely be off the bandwagon within a week anyway.|`|xGofrX5Iaa	Both fans are annoying. All this crying almost makes cowgirl fans look civil. Almost.|`|28ESRGPOaa	idk both have their annoying points but it coulda been worse.... the patriots coulda won again.|`|ProDw5xAaa	Cardinals blow a lead late in the game and cry about the officials. How about your team stopping them instead. Complaining about the officials if for losers. They are human and its a tough game to officiate. You have to play through it. Blame your players for playing like trash for 3 quarters. Blame Warner for throwing a huge pic at the 1 yard line and fumbling the game away at th end.|`|yLAH35rhaa	steelers fans since I've never seen a cards fan in my life.|`|i5MInqeMaa	I'm not a fan of either.  I hate all the cry baby fans out there that like to blame the refs instead of looking at there team mistakes they made.  Nobody like to put it on themselves.  Easier to say it's somebody else's fault.    I agree the ref's made some shady calls, but that's not why the Cards lost the game.|`|8aa98ddf90b585cbbccc7bd34c260043aa	Here is the thing, most people screaming about the Cards, are not Cards "fans".   I think there were three sets of people, Steelers fans (including bandwagoners), Cardinals fans, and people who hate the Steelers so much that they were rooting for the Cards in that game.    I think most of the people screaming about the game fall in to that last category.  They arent Cards fans, they simply had some investment in the Cards, either emotional or monetary, or they just wanted Pittsburgh to lose.|`|batOY7E7aa	i hate all the steelers bandwagon fans.....not the true diehard fans but the ones that jump on to a team right when they win the superbowl....|`|uOVsCWdNaa	For the record, I am a Steelers fan :)  The Cardinal fans are sooooo annoying because they are like "oh there were so many calls against the Cardinals, blah blah whiney whiney" when in reality there were calls against both, fair calls. So the game was won fair and square- Cardinals fans- just sit back and deal with it please!|`|gWleYSuIaa	all football fans are annoying|`|wYdHeAE9aa	this super bowl was not super! that's all i have to say about that. even though i'm not a fan of either team, it would have been better if the steelers lost.|`|ECTwMoHaaa	The Cardinal fans and all their whining.  Geez! Get over it.  The better team won.|`|bed9746a7bf18f598324f858a93ae28eaa	stealer fans, yeah i spelled it right
l0iCqzlQaa	I heard the bandwagon was helping people to get there.      oh i know mike i wasnt talking about you, but you know that half of these fans on here are. same for most teams.|`|M8iaO8hjaa	I'm going....2nd time in 4 yrs!|`|gWleYSuIaa	wow! going to a parade to watch overpaid guys who like to stick their hands up each other's crotches - what's it called Gay steeler pride?|`|AA11802580	I'll be there...first time!  Can't wait!    Grow up Boston!
a6EndAPiaa	If they both retire and do not play another game in the NFL I am guessing it would be Warner -- Favre will drag it out again.|`|AA11108627	Ask Brett or Kurt, Chuck!      How are we in Yahoo!Answers supposed to know what's going on in their respective heads?|`|YAiKlPkMaa	Brett Favre retires every other season. I'm really tired of hearing about him.|`|AA11105507	Brett Favre already retired once last year.|`|UQLNP6iyaa	I hope it's Favre. Kurt Warner is still useful. Against that kind of pass rush last night, Favre would have thrown 5 or 6 picks.|`|KwcrNzueaa	Favre|`|EZmIVXbCaa	really i could care less, but favre just wont stop playing. so probably kurt warner. but i really admire both of there love for the game love for the game.|`|f7qVtYfaaa	i wish it to be lord favre, i wish lord favre into the corn field , that would be good ,that would be a good thing.|`|AA10776364	Favre.  I see Kurt coming back next year, which will probably be his last.  I don't see Favre coming back next year simply because of his collapse at the end of the season.|`|kAnmzvnSaa	Warner lol.    Favre needs to give it up though|`|jzKJDrEWaa	Shaq|`|Roes9U61aa	Brett|`|H7AcXAyaaa	Favre.
xbuZFjveaa	Jump on the bandwagon with the rest of America and play paintball. I dont think theres much of anything (sportswise) more adrenaline inducing than little plastic 'bullets' flying out of a gun at 280 feet per second-especially when you can shoot 20-30 balls per second.|`|OHDXO5Dsaa	I like to do extreme sports too and i do not jump off anything high, i get some air but i dont jump off of anything.  Try snowboarding, surfing, skateboarding, bmx. etc...thats all i can think of.|`|w0eRRsoVaa	Luge is pretty dangerous and it requires no jumping.
LNTmxp5daa	i think that the cardnals could have won if it wasnt beacause of the refs. i mean whan he was just sitting there its kinda BULLSHIT that they didnt get kicked out of the game. and when he got a penalty for roughing the passer he fell over someone and then fell on to the QB. and yes his arm was going forword!|`|Irdj2KAFaa	Yes, the refs did appear to be one-sided. Almost too early in the game too. 11 Penalties totaling 106 yards; of which 90% in the first half. But hey, the refs have to send their kids to college too right?     To be honest, I was surprised they didn't throw a flag when Larry ran 64 yards for a TD.    The refs tried to equalize the penalties by calling two ridicules ones against the steelers late in the 3rd quarter.     Lets face it, the best part of Superbowl XLIII for me was when the Cardinals embarrassed Ben R. by shutting down TWO goal-to-go stands; another Superbowl history marker.  The Steelers need to get rid if Ben, he is pathetic and if it wasn't for their victory on Feb 1st 2009, he would still be known as the worst Superbowl QB ever. At least he redeemed himself from holding that record.|`|q1nda33Xaa	yea i agree they cheated arizona threw the whole game STEELERS SUCK!!!!!!!!!|`|i5MInqeMaa	I agree, but you can't cry about the game if your team made crucial mistakes without the ref's help.  kurt warner's int for a td is why you guys lost.  And your bad defense at the end of the game.  REf's can't make you play better defense you have to do that yourself.|`|X4O7W1Vvaa	On the bright side the challenge stopped a dodgy TD.|`|H7AcXAyaaa	Cards fans are sore losers.|`|hwIMJBVpaa	nope. i just think that the one call was unfair about the punching. that was ridiculous. he should have been thrown out of the game for it.|`|j5k0VRbPaa	arizonaaa suckkkkkkkkkkkkkss steelers wonn yahh im from pittsburgh and live here all my life and please  dont hate cas they lost they just suckk steelers are a  hard team to beat soo get over it goshhh they lost and they arent a good teamm they suckkkkk on  ice thats why they lostt steeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeelllllllllllllleeee... cityyyyy baby yahh  accept the fact arizona lostttt|`|wYdHeAE9aa	superbowl was a joke|`|gWleYSuIaa	why does someone always cry about the refs in American football?  It's a gay sport - nearly every play starts with one man's hands between anothe rman's crotch|`|9vLzGwVqaa	That was a bogus game!|`|bjR2uWAWaa	waaaaaaa, you cry baby! Steelers won and have the 6th ring!|`|qqptguPJaa	Yes I agree.    I didn't go for any    but I saw it and it was     so unfair the penaltys and     two of steelers touchdown|`|batOY7E7aa	its just like the steelers superbowl in 2005 the refs gave that game to them....the steelers played like crap but the refs kept the seahawks out of it...|`|0f5cc27a5aca75cf6162b2cbb88fc13caa	James Harrison could bring a loaded rifle into the huddle, point it at Warner, shoot Fitzgerald and if one Cardinals fan complained you know what you would hear from "the best fans in the NFL" ................"get over it", "your a sore loser", "let it go" and maybe "grow up".   Thats how Steelers fans are.  They won 4 titles in the 70s based on steroids use, which Ill provide links to, an they won 2 in the 2000s from the officials.  ONE good thing though is.............they will have to defend themselves the rest of their lives.  MILLIONS of people know how they have won their last 2 an when your on the world stage like that an you "win" in that fashion, it really damages your credibility as a champion.       http://www.boston.com/sports/football/ar...    http://sports.yahoo.com/nfl/blog/shutdow...|`|XMxf8BGSaa	to answer your question correctly the steelers had 7 penalties for 56 yds. cards. 11 for 106. Not any difference than some other games. Cards had every chance to win putting up 407 total yds of offense while steelers only had 292. Its not just the refs. its the fact on the last drive the steelers won on, arizonas d quit bringing the pressure that they had the whole second half. They gave a tough Pitt team every chance and open reciever. Yes the last call should have been reviewed longer than 5 secs. but the calls are not what costed the cards the game. People will always complain about the calls. The call on harrison was a personal foul as it should have been. It did set the steelers back 20 yds. So to say that it did not get called is bogus. No he should not have been kicked out of the game, he was not just beating the guy up. Its football, he was mearly holding him down. Football is dirty, sometimes you see the punches sometimes you dont. You know how much punching goes on at the bottom of the piles. It happens!|`|bCmqScVlaa	Once upon a time in the land of Cards, there lived a mean ref that had it in for them...................And the Steelers lived happily ever after.    GO STEELERS!!!  SIX SUPERBOWL WINS!!!!!!!!! TOP OF THE NFL!!!!|`|39pl2Dotaa	SORE LOSER|`|9bbda51d0fa9171f8b54abcba95b5f95aa	How about some cheese for all that whine. Get over it.|`|ProDw5xAaa	A few bad calls both ways, but they didn't decide the game. The Cardinals could have stopped pittsburgh on the last drive but they couldn't. Warner hand was going forward but the ball was not in his hand. Best team won the game. Stop crying about the officials. If they wanted to be one sided they would have not called the holding in the end zone. That one call would have been enough for the Steelers to probably ice the game.|`|AA11515684	Love reading class Pittsburgh fans comments.    Warners pick was the game, the refs made things a lot harder.    Stay Classy Pittsburgh..city of "winners" haha
a6EndAPiaa	I doubt it.  As the division winner they will have a much more difficult schedule, the 49ers are looking better, and there is no way that that cheapo Bidwell will pry open his wallet to pay Boldin -- and even if Bidwell does Boldin is too bitter to stay.|`|wYdHeAE9aa	whiners seem to be on the rise! they are my pick for nfc west champs next year. cards if anything maybe a wild-card.|`|ProDw5xAaa	Yes because their division is garbage. Seattle if healthy might be able to compete with them. They won't be going back to the superbowl though.|`|8aa98ddf90b585cbbccc7bd34c260043aa	If Warner and Boldin come back, yeah they will.    If Warner doesnt, it will be tough.    If Warner and Boldin are gone, they might win the west by default, depending on how many steps forward San Fran takes this next season.
batOY7E7aa	yes they should hes so inconsistiant and with the running game and the recievers they have if they drafted a QB early they would go straight to the super bowl...|`|8aa98ddf90b585cbbccc7bd34c260043aa	Id hate to say it, but yeah, Delhomme is holding the Panthers back.  Hes not a bad QB, but he just isnt clutch or consistant, and you need at least 1 of the 2.  On top of that, he just turned 34 years old.  Even if they wanted to use him another year or two, they definatley need to be looking past him to the future.|`|ProDw5xAaa	No but  i would draft a young QB and get him ready to play in the next 2 years.|`|f7qVtYfaaa	i think they are keeping him but he wil seriously have to compete for the starter job this coming season

L'organismo umano ha una grandissima abilit nell'abituarsi, sorprendilo! cambia spesso esercizi, carichi e ripetizioni...Se mi specifichi il sesso ti sparo 3 o 4 esercizi x avere buoni risultati....  Ah ora vedo la foto....I migliori esercizi sono il "lento dietro", le "alzate frontali" e le "alzate laterali"....Ma sono difficili da spiegare bene senza foto...|`|c4e7aa903fff003aa3241f81526e4813aa	Perch, devi lavorare come scaricatrice di porto?

Piccole serie e lente.     Pesi? a mio avviso non servono. Serve solo fare un po' di ginnastica a corpo libero. Un altro esercizio  ad esempio roteare le braccia distese per un po' (fino a sentire indolenzimenti alle spalle per l'appunto).     Non esagerare per con gli esercizi. Sei una ragazza. Perch questo desiderio di sviluppare le spalle?

En surf il faut ramer presque tout le temps, surtout il faut ramer fort pour le take off et mine de rien ?a explose les bras quand t'as pas l'habitude (ou que tu l'a perdue snif snif...)    En fait tout va dpendre des conditions de surf, privilgie des petites vagues (    Surtout privilgie une planche trs stable, personnellement j'ai dbut en longboard, (planche >8 pieds, mais pas plus de 9 pieds sinon tu ne fera pas un seul virage) ou un malibu (de 7 pieds  8 pieds grosso modo).    Trouve quelqu'un pour t'aider au dbut, il y a pleins d'coles de surf, des stages UCPA etc etc etc mais comme dans tout les sports de glisses, il faut persvrer et y prendre gout, la premire vague que tu surfera en plein eau devant la mousse c'est la belle banane sur le visage garantis.|`|1542f20db8c2cb58654157c4818c3e3caa	Moi pendant les vacances l'anne dernire, j'avais pris 2 heures je crois et  la fin j'arrivais  tenir  peut prs debout, mais bon c'tait  malibu donc il y avait pas mal de courant !|`|yND7bJlUaa	tout depend de vous pour moi jai pas encore essaye|`|Z2hC7KS4aa	moi j'ai russi en deux jours a tenir debout sans tomber

Jxco5p6Haa	One thing's for sure, Gillespie became one of the biggest traitors to Texas A&M once he joined UK.  But during his time here, he was a great recruiter (look at Acie Law) and turned a lowly Big 12 team in College Station, Texas into national prominence within a couple of years.  If he continues this trend, then UK would definitely be back in the NCAA Final Four in the near future.|`|c4710b32c1b6c3341a412651b1812242aa	While Billy Gillespie is a great recruiter, and his track record proves thus, I cannot see how he will bring Kentucky basketball back to prominence that it expects.    They seriously dropped the ball on this one.  Gillespie has never run a national program anywhere comparable to Kentucky, so he has no idea how much stress it's going to bring.  UK had a shot at Donovan and Self and neither would take the job, perhaps because Big Blue Nation couldn't offer enough money, perhaps because they knew how stressful the job would be for them.    No disrespect to Gillispie, but he was brought into UTEP and A and M to recruit talent and turn their programs around.  He has no idea what it's like to coach a "powerhouse", where expectations are extremely high and success is DEMANDED.  Just having a twenty win season won't do it.  Unless he gets UK to the Elite Eight or beyond at least in his second season, I don't think he's going to last any longer than that. It's asking alot from him, no doubt, but that's what coaching Kentucky is all about, and he had better know how to handle it.    AT LEAST, thank goodness, we finally have a recruiter at UK!|`|a6ce942f66f43d4426f68929c5ed8276aa	No and No!    UK is a program past its peak. They will have to stand in line behind the better programs in the SEC now like Florida, LSU and Tennessee (gotta love that great coach Bruce Pearl!)|`|AA11031560	Like getting a new turbo, you don't know for sure what it  can do until you give it a try...all you have to go on is what  it has done before you get your hands on it....for the Aggies, could he have done better?  Sure, he could have stayed  with the program he had going..... and I mean going!    For UK basketball being brought back  to what was once  thought of it as 'great'...it would take a lot more than a mere  coach.....resurrection  is a Devine act, one I can't see Mr.  Gillespie able to perform!  The fans at UK want every  game to end as a "W" for UK..just is not going to happen  in today's competition......I predict Coach Gillespie to   suffer out this little contract, get his money and get gone!

syNb6gcHaa	I live in Atlanta, and I'm a Braves fan. What Smoltzy said is that he won't know until he gets to the point where he can throw again. He says he will try to throw again once he can, and if things go well he will return next year. If there are more setbacks than he anticipates, then no, he won't return.  Smoltz is as big a competitor as they come. Believe me, if it is physically possible for him to come back, he will. I wouldn't be too surprised if this is the end for him though. He's resilient, but now he's pretty old as well.

If not, drag the edges across an old stump or hard round piece of timber. Then the face of the blade is knocked, gently at first,with the ball on the stick or an old ball, do this 'evenly' all over. Continue this process, hitting harder and harder all over until you are hitting as hard as you can. To check your progress you can run your hand along the surface of the bat face to feel for any hollows it may have which may need more knocking or playing in. When playing in the bat at first try to play the ball to defence not hard drives and not full toss shots. You are trying to compress the timber not break it in half.
b5ae216048468653d210b2eefb8c129daa	It was a new rule that was passed by the competition committee that wide receivers can officially  wear numbers between 10 to 19 and 80 through 89.  Although, I must say that it is just a formality because Keyshawn Johnson has been wearing  19 for a while.|`|AA10399154	If the numbers in the 80s range are used up, in this case NY Giants it is, than WRs can use numbers like 17 or 18. Personally, I think they should only be allowed to use 80,81,82,83,84,85,86,87,88, and 89, thats like 10 recivers, but the NFL comish came up with this.|`|AA11644641	lots of players do that    larry fitzgerald (arizona)  11  randy moss (oakland)  18  keyshawn johnson (dallas)  19  justin gage (chicago)  12  and a lot more    so yea lots of WR do it|`|b57d602fd40b4ddb1573ff7c1dc27ec3aa	They could be in the teens or 80s.

Usually, QB'S, P, and K are identified by wearing numbers 1-19 and etc., but the NFL modified that rule to include WR'S due to the fact that so many teams carry so amny WR'S and TE'S that there's not enough numbers between 80-89 (their usual numbers) to accomodate them all.

55baf7925661ea059e38d431fdd5fdd6aa	It just happens.  At one point your body and mind has clicked and you have it figured out.  Lets just say B-Ball for example.  You can practice on shooting 24 -7 and miss a few.  At one point your mind and body figures out the equation to shoot the ball so that you are hitting net all of the time.   It is pretty much sub-conscious.  Some people hit it more often then others.  The 2 most deadly people that get in the zone in my book is Glen Rice and Kobe Bryant because they are not shooting 2 pointers anymore when they do it and they can drop 15 points in a matter of seconds.    It is pretty much a sub-conscious switch that no one can control (yet)    RJ|`|eIR0LjQMaa	Listen to a crazy rock song and jump around and drink some cocaine.

D1 goes to mid-court to pressure O1 and the ball.     D2 & D3 should be positioned at elbows to stop any penetration.     D4 & D5 are in low post.          In this ex., O1 passes to O3.          D3 should slide over and cover O3 man-to-man as D1 takes up position at high post.          In this zone defense ex., O3 dishes back to O1 and cuts to corner as O1 slides over to wing position. D3 goes with O3, D1 plays man on O1.     D2 & D4 should be aware of O2 & O4, but D2 slides over to middle of foul line and D4 moves to middle of key for possible rebound. D5 guards O5 in low post.          If O1 dribbles back to top of key and O3 returns to wing, the D will adjust back into original starting zone defense set-up.          In this case, O4 tries to get position in high post so D2 & D3 should close in and cover.          O2 cuts to corner & O1 moves out to wing. D2 should take away pass to O2 as D3 covers high post player D4 takes away any penetration through key.           --------------------------------------...      20-2-3 Zone Defense     Here your guards are ready to defend the 3 point line and your "3" part of the zone should be lined up with the first mark above the block. Use man-to-man principles when playing zone defense.          The zone defense must match-up as the offense comes down court. The defense must be talking to each other at all times.          If player 1 passes the ball to player 2 the defense would stay with their matchups, but if 1 passes to 3 then BUMPING begins. Defensive player 1 would bump 4 down. 4 does not leave until 1 tells him to. BUMPING will occur only when a "back line" defender is out guarding a perimeter player.          In this situation the offense has a high post 5. Defense 5 will match-up with 5. D1 and D2 will help D5 by trying to get a hand in any passing lane to 5. D5 will keep 5 as far away from the basket as possible on any shots taken by the offense.          If the offense sends a cutter through, it is very crucial that the defenders communicate. D2 must yell "cutter" and he must bump or slow down the cutter. D3 and D5 will also try to slow down the cutter. D1 bumps D4 down, and D2 slides up. D4 will match up with 2 in the corner.          If they send the cutter to the opposite side. D2 stays put. D4 yells "cutter" and slows down 3's progress. D3 will match-up with 3 on the perimeter, D5 will slide over and D4 takes the opposite low post (5).|`|bd82ce362621123b5b27d14370353449aa	You just gotta find your mode.

f369ce3ec09367be3652c2257bb5ed9daa	He is gonna go the way of Ruben Sierra and Tony Batista of last year pretty soon I think.  He has really labored in all of his starts and it sucks that the Twins work so hard only to have him implode and give them little chance of winning when he starts.

And, even if Johan re-signs, they will still have to get others under new deals and Garza will be harder to re-sign once he gets more and more time to shine|`|p5Mac5t6aa	I think Ponson is on borrowed time and will probably make one or two more starts and if his ERA (currently 8.18)doesn't drop nor his control improve I think they will make a change.  He also has a penchant for giving up HR's as I think in 1999 he gave up 35.  But I think the Twins will make a change very soon.

i0O0DAieaa	They don't suck and they have their 67 wins in the regular season to prove it. But the problem for the Mavericks is small ball basketball. They've lost their series to Phoenix and Golden State and what do they have in common? They play small and like to push the tempo. This creates matchup problems for the Mavericks and the Mavericks adopt to the pace of the Warriors/Suns and end up losing because running and gunning is what the Suns and Warriors do best.|`|809ab083a593088984facf46e1b5fcf9aa	They're the best team in the NBA.

But Practice, that is what increases your muscle flexibilty leading eventaully to the splits... there is not time table because your body varies BUT be careful not to pull or tear any  muscles so I suggest you warm up... good luck and I hope you lose those 6 inches and finally do the complete splits!
WG7cNojtaa	i agree with you, yes girls are just as important as boys. and we're as athletic too.  i think women's sports aren't shown as much on tv because our society is male oriented, and that has to change. showing more womens and girls sports on television also encourages girls of young ages to be active and get involved in sports, and that they can do anything a boy can do.

VJuWWgrhaa	troy glaus is really running out of steam lately. ive seen him mostly with 0-4 and 0-3 games. he is in a serious drought, thats for sure. his average dropped many points in the last few weeks. i would try to give glaus to a team that has a weak 3B or SS and at most you could get a backup SS or maybe a decent RP or SP. youre looking at guys like nate robertson, maybe chien ming-wang, nothing too great. if worse comes to worse, just drop him for a free agent backup.|`|4pLZ2XTCaa	I traded him last month for Jose Valverde,  but that was last month. Good luck with the A's this year   The Angels are going all the way this year|`|AA10240466	That entirely depends on your league.  If there is no one in your league that needs that type of player, then you are out of luck.  Personally, I could see him going for a Johhny Peralta or Ryan Garko.  Maybe for a pitcher like Joe Saunders or a reliever like Matt Capps.  It's funny how much he has fallen off as the year progressed.  Was having one of his best years earlier in the season.  Have you looked at your free agents.  I guarantee there are players out there that would do better than him right now if you just added them.  Check out Gload, Gathright, J. Upton, Mel Cabrera, etc.

JdlkhEayaa	I would certainly show the door to Degen, Dossena, and Leiva for sure but the others in your list I'd keep as squad players. They might not be "top class" but are good enough to use even if not for all games as first 11 players.  There's absolutely no chance of having 24/25 first teamers in your squad....you need the likes of those others in the list to use as cover for injuries, substitutes, loss of form etc for the "best" 11 who should play regularly.  It's an absolute must that LFC buy a first class, top notch, A1 striker to accompany Torres, a world class right winger and 2 really good full backs in the summer and then and only then will LFC topple Man Utd and Chelsea.  Whether this can be achieved with Benitez only time will tell.|`|uUitKmJMaa	No i think Arbeloa is Good.    So i'd take him out of your list.    And Babel has potential|`|PrsbAjZAaa	I'd take Babel and Kuyt in a flash    Kuyt put's in more of a work rate than most of the team  Babel.....i wouldn't say he's a wasted talent at Pool , but he's used sparingly.       Dossena....first choice for Italy...and they wonder how they didn't win the Euro.       Lucas....dosen't deserve the cool one name status for the Brazilians.      N'Gog....still a one for the future...too early to tell if he'l be a hit or not.      but out of them i'd only have Babel and Kuyt.|`|HtsowwHBaa	you forgot voronin... he's currently on loan so he's not out yet, he might be back to liverpool next summer.|`|gPsFFQbRaa	maybe ur right|`|kxMQXhuAaa	Lucas should be the first one to be shown the door.I've always said he's not good enough.    I'd keep Babel,he's a good player.He just isn't being given a decent run in the team.    Kuyt always gives 100% but he's being played out of position.He's not a winger,he's a striker.    I don't think we've seen enough of N'gog yet to judge whether he's good enough.    The others are pretty average,i wouldn't be sorry to see them go.|`|yaMmdhpIaa	Arbeloa  Kuyt  should stay for sure.

Y.N.W.A|`|xU7AaQOdaa	I'll pay for the taxi for Lucas and Dossena, and Babel can drive himself.  Degen's been injured, so I don't know, and with the other 4 you mention, can you be sure that Rafa would be able, is able, to buy better?    We need players like Kuyt and Arbeloa to provide TRUE strength in depth, but the main point is that we do not need them starting. I would add Aurelio and Benayoun to the list as well.|`|VMBGniYYaa	Kuyt and Arbeloa?? Naahh. Others Are okay, but i have faith in babel to produce and even though lucas isn't world class at the moment if we play him in the reserves he'll develop. He'll be one to watch in a few years, believe me.|`|Ofx0LpMlaa	i agree,apart from arbeloa and kuyt  those 2 would be staying if it was up to me  i like kuyt hes a tryer and a battler,he would score more goals if he wasnt stuck on the right|`|peFtORvUaa	I'd keep em all except degan and Ngog|`|Hiasgb75aa	People keep saying Babel has potential. The problem is they have been sayng this for 2 years, and he is coming up to his mid 20s|`|b10aMPdOaa	Degen, Dossena and N'Gog.  Especially Lucas, he's a dick!  I like Arbeloa, Babel and Kuyt even tho I'm an Evertonian.|`|569220f4bb3c501027a6a6fe7ba2bb28aa	Philip Degen - YES!  Andrea Dosena - YES!  Lucas Leiva - YES!  David Ngog- YES!  Cause they mentioned players play sh*t Football.    But the rest are good players and should stay.|`|FN11c540aa	LUCAS LUCAS LUCAS LUCAS LUCAS is the only player we need to get rid of he is sh@|`|UnVrXqqGaa	Italy is very strong, just that the Europeans had a bad coach, Donadoni, now that Lippi is back, what made us win the World Cup victories are insured. Great Capello, an Italian in charge of' England.|`|c9gSo3V4aa	hello ! I 'm italian   secondo me this fottballers se ne devono andare !!|`|kl5UAXueaa	I like Kuyt    Scores goals when really needed!|`|jiFHJ6daaa	deggen,leiva,ngog--kick those out    get saviola,|`|LdJFFvSVaa	Babel's decent I know he looked like a lanky twit but he was out of position yesterday he's a winger.|`|fEWhwumZaa	I'd get rid of Benayoun and keep Babel but apart from that I agree with you. I would be sad to see Kuyt go though.    And also, who would buy Lucas!?|`|UZUl0vG8aa	Kuyt??  Babel??  Ngog??  Degen just been unlucky!!  Lucas needs time  Arbeloa is our strongest rb    Rest can go|`|duJgBxUoaa	Alvaro Arbeloa  Ryan Babel  David N'Gog    They will be good in the future, The rest can struggle there way to teams who actually need them.|`|EIsnATLxaa	I disagree man the only 1'z are dossena-aurelio-lucas should go...why the **** would u sell babel, hes a good talent man    kuyt is the hardest worker at liverpool did you not see him against chelsea?    n'gog is only 19 man give him a chance|`|uXXbegw5aa	I'd keep Arbeloa and Babel and maybe Kuyt but the rest can go.    Why the Fcuk did we buy  Lucas in the 1st place, waste of fckin money.|`|cf4d6d60fab75efc136a4d66dd5c03b4aa	Rafa- sack him the  new manager will do the thing|`|XU1KaWXwaa	i think kuyt is alright he gets some important goals  dossena should be gone  Degen not sure only seen him play once and was disappointed.  Arbeloa are u mad?? he is one of the most consistent RB.  Lucas should be beheaded.  Babel... sometimes good i think he deserves more games  N'gog looks decent but should be sold along with lucas and dossena and with the robbie keane money we should get a decent strong striker and right winger. Also our owners are very very tight. Also i think we should try playing babel in gerrard positions.|`|7KZepeq3aa	3 things!    1st, there is no way that you could get rid of 7 players and attract 7 more and expect them to settle Straight in to the squad.    2nd, is that you conceding the title by saying that these players are `alright` and that with them there you wont` win?    3rd Liverpool are broke at the moment with what money they do have allocated to your new stadium, and with the owners at logger heads they will not be committing more funds.    Sorry|`|MjPd9vyYaa	WOW. Your a coward. Its a shame we share a common interest in football; Liverpool. Without those guys Liverpool wouldn't get through.|`|SiOjEH00aa	i would keep babel for a sub, and loan out n'gog, he is still very young.  i might sell benayoun as well, but it remains to me seen how much Liverpool can spend in the summer.    you never know, if its the guys from the oil rich countries, we might be able to sell them all and get some real quality (:|`|HxET88bDaa	Keep them all please:)
aaKYVMk2aa	Me, here! I was glad when the Hornets got him. Though they're not my favorite team, Chris Paul shouldn't have signed with them 6 years, people really don't realize how good CP3 is. He's 183 cm ffs!|`|GswnLKtQaa	He played very well for the Wiz while Arenas was down.    But now in NO he's not playing well...Pargo did a better job backing up CP3.|`|VHphDgrhaa	I liked his game but then he left us (washington).      8-[|`|01b9743a0b503849c2b30b5f6efcca49aa	they need to step it up..daniels was a great acquisition but we need to make better use of the bench|`|NaYoqWBOaa	He's been a solid player throughout his 11 year NBA career. I really like the guy personally as well. He was my neighbor for 2 years at BGSU.|`|xJxQRJ8yaa	No matter how great Daniels is playing right now, he will still be looked at as a pretty big bust. He was drafted  4 overall in 1997 and has been nothing better than a role player. The only thing Daniels can give to the league right now is experience and back-up minutes. He lost his opportunity many years ago and was way too inconsistent to make an impact. He's been lucky to stay in the league as long as he's have.
oAjbBLDpaa	Matt was always meant to be the serious one. That means if he dresses in a serious manner than it suits his gimmick better.|`|clb9NAMPaa	he has always been the lesser brother if you ask me.|`|3z5gicSLaa	i don't know whar are you thinking i think that Matt is always  better than jeff in everything wrestling he has better clothes|`|BglekVnQaa	I think you pay attention to him a little too much.|`|94MdbPG7aa	Jeff always dressed better|`|F3VjJAdiaa	they both look like halloween, grunge, goth rejects if you ask me.|`|rJMZdp04aa	That's Because Matt IS Lame Compared to Jeff.    But as a Heel now , His Blank White tape suits the Gimmick better.|`|it2UVkF4aa	Not me. That's his pro wrestling ring attire style.|`|O6VTWYDtaa	stfu i bet u look like a homo|`|NZKramllaa	Might I remind you that is just Jeff's gimmick, but Matt is the older one ...tell me? would he look right with some Face Paint and fishnet Armbands No !!! He is taken more seriously than Jeff in some aspects.|`|h9PVRHPWaa	I have never really noticed there outfits. I have noticed Matt is a better wrestler than jeff. If thats important. its up to the viewer to decide.|`|5vXgcAbCaa	Matt looks dumb no matter what.
3teWTOPqaa	People hate on Kobe because he is better than their favorite player.|`|AA11488609	Those are Kobe fans who do the complaining and hate on LeBron, Duncan, etc, not most of the Lakers fans.      If Paul Pierce played 12 years for his hometown Lakers and won a ship, the Lakers fans will laud him forever, and if Kobe played for the Celtics for 12 years, then the Lakers fans will think Kobe is evil...|`|JD5NQxeNaa	A question that has plagued basketball minds for decades nay generations.|`|KdhNCnEjaa	Lakers "fans" are mad because their franchise is not that great. They probably have the least classy fans in the league.|`|Y29OiWJbaa	Kobe is just like Michael Jordan, a greedy ball hog.|`|wKGZ0h8Paa	They are all HIPPOCRITES.  For example, they all hate Celtics.  They especially hate Pierce yet they complain why other hate on Laker and or Kobe.  They even have the nerve to post "Why you hate Bynum, Pierce suks" on the same question.|`|SLjdh5jXaa	they are drug using losers!|`|Kwywmcs8aa	they are just d bags.|`|fz77R5Jmaa	because we are passionate and loyal to our favorite team and player|`|jHJ0W9QNaa	i agree 100% with X-Factor... Lakers fans love to trash talk to compensate for their inadequacy.|`|PMPUQvUZaa	kobe is the best period|`|vFbzBo4eaa	Because when they lost vs the Celtics they were mad as their Kobe and comparing Kobe with LeBron or Jordan or other great players like:Wade,Howard,Duncan,Nowitzki,Paul and etc.They think Kobe is the best player in the nba but HE ISN'T THE BEST PLAYER IN THE NBA,THE BEST PLAYER IN THE NBA IS LEBRON!!!!But anyway i agree with Tarzan that they really hate Celtics fans because they lost in the finals from a rival.Now they're really mad because Bynum is injerd but those fans can be good when they feel sorry about some great players like i feel sorry for their player Bynum.
25ymUKdraa	Dwight howard, chris paul,  chauncey billups|`|3teWTOPqaa	Dwight, CP3, and Billups.|`|o0GQUIXlaa	uh no1  haha  you could make an arguement for Dwight Howard but i doubt he'll win it    itll be one of those 3 you said|`|H7AcXAyaaa	DH-12, CP3, DR-1.|`|VHphDgrhaa	1.Chris Paul (New Orleans Hornets)  2.

He is posting up some of his best numbers in years and the Spurts are in the mix.    Chris Fall of the Hornets should get consideration also. Even tho he flops and rollls around on the court for calls he does do a good job of running his team.    Dwight Howard should also get consideration. Look at how well the Magic is doing. He is a big part of that|`|rTbKXMMpaa	Dwight Howard  Tim Duncan   CP3|`|Ga11Abmzaa	Dwight Howard, Chris Bosh, and Chris Paul.|`|3i1vAIBFaa	besides Kobe i really don't see anybody else. Maybe paul gasol? go lakers!!!!|`|jc4yHjV8aa	Dirk Nowitzki, KG and Durant
xhHfXuKFaa	first Q:yes. the bynumless lakers beat them 4-1 last year.    2nd Q:no.kobe will pick it up and they will win one of the two games.    3rd Q:no. he will lose his rhythm and gasol and co. will have to toughen up.|`|xeEOTsyYaa	Q1: They seemed capable of that last year without Bynum. But, the Spurs have been playing better this year, with Roger Mason Jr. giving them some more energy and versatility, and they've played the Lakers good this year. I'd still think, in a 7 game series, the Lakers would win.    Q2: Against the Celtics, yes, against the Cavs, no.    Q3: I don't know. A torn MCL can be serious.|`|H7AcXAyaaa	No.  Yes.  No.|`|i5MInqeMaa	Lakers will do just what they did last year.  They should do better cause they have a healthy Ariza.  they made it to the finals last year so i expect the same cause it's the same team and you have a healthy ariza and the deepest bench in the league.|`|wKGZ0h8Paa	1.  Yes they are capable of beating spurs.  2.  Yes Gasol will have problem against Celtics again.  3.  No.  Coming back from two major injuries will be tough.  Especially on both knees.|`|lMDy8W0Raa	The Lakers will sign Snaq O Meal to a short term contract right after the All Star weekend, which will reunite Kobe and big fartistotle once again. Then Bynum will be back on may and they will share time on court.     Don't worry Lakers will win the championship.|`|UadP6GO8aa	They should be fine. They went to the finals last year without him so Laker fans shouldn't worry.      1. It depends on who has the better game. LA and SA are pretty evenly matched. If LA's 3 point game is good, then LA wins, but if SA defense holds LA to under 100, then SA wins.    2. Yes, he will against the Celtics but  not the Cavs unless he's doubled every play.    3. Yes maybe. The guy is still young so he'll still be a threat when/if he returns. But we will see.|`|ODORT37Paa	Q1: The Lakers are not capable of beating the Spurs in a seven game series.  Q2: vs Celtics - yes  vs Cavs - no  Q3: Bynum will be a non-factor for the remainder of the season and postseason.    I'm looking forward to Sunday's game.|`|SEuXrVYlaa	Lakers will be losing their inside man, so expect a drop in boards and blocks. Kobe will have to take more load, both on offence and on defence. Gasol will def be dominated inside by Celtics, but I dont know if he will be by Cavs. Anyway sorry to break it to you, but Lakers arent gonna go to the finals this year. Cavs and Magic both have a more solid roster, bench, and better team chemistry.|`|WLXFAeSnaa	Maybe. If they want it bad enough. (Meaning if they want it more than the Spurs do)    Most likely, he will    That's also a maybe. If he works hard enough, then yes.
mHnNibApaa	yes and no ! fuc yahoo !|`|7Tw7s6HSaa	no and no|`|2sxiHRvzaa	yes and no|`|S0LSmJ9haa	no and yes|`|bzwSCm6taa	aye..cherry reds....and the daft q's at the top when you answer......whats the point..lol|`|ePFdhsCYaa	No but I've played against someone sporting Dr. Martins, we went in for a 50/50 challenge together and he came off the best.

0KN8bX3Daa	Yeah, but when was the last time a diva had a DVD out beside Lita, Trish, Chyna and Sable back in the late 90's and early 2000's.|`|rJMZdp04aa	Depends.  Is it Just Straight WWE Stuff , or does it Contain her "Questionable" Transgressions before WWE?    Either way , I'd take a look.|`|QY4Hy00qaa	Yes I would definitely buy it Mickie James is one of the best Divas in the wwe.|`|3icTrKLLaa	Yes....although Divas rarely get there own DVDs|`|gXHxf2G9aa	Absolutely!!! Rock on Mickie James!!! :)|`|NZKramllaa	Yes, I would...Mickie is one of my favorite Divas....So yea I would but the DVD just to see what her past was like and How hard she worked to get in the WWE.|`|IzgJpVgBaa	hell yeah i deffo would|`|vs16DXUraa	Of course i would! That would be awesome!! starred|`|NNn84vTCaa	I would buy it! Especially if it had some of her independent circuit stuff on there, but all the same, it would make $$$$$$$$$$$$. And, Mickie is the best Divas, its true.|`|mDuiiVN7aa	What a question, OF COURSE I WOULD, she is the best female performer in the ring and she looks hot!!!|`|84ceqOC4aa	sure [:|`|oWD5wvqLaa	no
4c479c9c27bebd404d7ba657763fe54faa	And I thought it was only me! Ach aye! Fifer, ma self!    Drew Galloway, also known as Drew McIntyre, I would say is a good wrestler, current works in FCW and is a former FCW Tag Team Champion with The Empire    Sadly, there's been no many actual Scottish wrestlers that have made a big impact.    Also, Roddy Piper is not Scottish. He is Canadian!|`|mDuiiVN7aa	Piper should be the greatest man ever to represent Scotland.  Other scottish wrestlers I know about are: Drew McIntyre, the Highlanders (Rory and Robbie)...|`|rH3ylNuYaa	not roddy roddy piper , he is canadian,  but the highlanders are scottish  too bad one of them got fired for showing up on TNA impact.|`|2FKHNIB2aa	Drew McIntyre is the only one i know seeing as Piper is Canadian. but he is billed as being Scottish so the two of them.|`|mJvZhdAuaa	I think "Rowdy" Roddy Piper is Scottish.|`|zzIj5bN5aa	scott hall, scott steiner lol just playing I believ rody piper is billed from scottland|`|AA11482019	Superstar Bill Dundee, who's real name is William Cruickshanks, was billled as coming from Australia, but he was born in Dundee, Scotland.  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bill_Dundee|`|7f2GSDmqaa	Roddy Piper is of Scottish descent, so he is Scottish, just not from Scotland. The only one that is legitly from Scotland that I know of is Drew McIntyre
mxA0tYppaa	Looking more forward to the last game terry...    FQ1....Arshavin wll be the man on sunday....    FQ2...it looks like it's gonna be written in stone that Keane will score the goal that hands Utd the title...|`|nJ5kceMBaa	FQ1: Keane will probably pick up where he left off at White Hart Lane, banging the goals in. I'm not convinced about Arshavin at all (sorry).    FQ2: I think we'll be out of it by then to be honest, but yeah, you can bet your life he'll score against us.|`|5c0ea2e937929dc820b4f96293aa83a2aa	Both will be good news for Spurs and Keane... just you wait  ;-)|`|bNykcEVXaa	Spurs v Arsenal is a good match .. whoever is playing    as for Spurs v liverpool.. if they get to that stage without having already lost the title... they deserve it    dR bad  a bit sad when an Arsenal fan is soo excited about that sort of thing though... you lot used to be a big club.. ?    ..and I doubt Arshavin is the answer to your problems|`|duJgBxUoaa	They will both flop :)|`|AA12302228	what are they playing for....nothing|`|Gr99OjQuaa	not really, maybe if theres something at stake...  pavelachenko cant adapt to the premiership what if arshavin is a bust as well?|`|QVvmmPc4aa	Hello Terry! I don't know if the cnut signed for us yet because some Zenit cockmonger is saying the deal is off but Arsene is saying it's done! In Arsene we trust I guess??    Reckon Keane will feel more at home and perform the way he used to! And Arshavin might lack fitness, so he may find himself on the bench if he's even an Arsenal man!|`|0lplyfe6aa	i think ARSHAVIN will steal the show.    LIVERPOOL will win the leauge for sure...then it is no problem....ROBBIE will score 0 goals.
932b9cfe7a05bb25d03a132b597eff85aa	Dude Bynum out 2-3 months.  Not weeks.... MONTHS!    He's a china doll - touch 'em and he breaks!|`|Ga11Abmzaa	Why?, their doing good|`|RBdy17Ahaa	Bryant isn't injured so that won't work.|`|tl7fd34yaa	why, there are at the top of the west, and last i checked they were in the finals last season too|`|xJxQRJ8yaa	Stupid question.    This is the same exact Laker team that went to the Finals last year. Only difference is that they have more experience and every player on that team is better. Bynum will be back next year or possibly at the end of the season and I have no doubt that he'll be playing great again as he showed us that he's capable of coming back from devastating injuries. Yes, Yao, McGrady and Bynum are all injury-prone, but Kobe is not and he plays through injuries all the time.
JzYlcuXzaa	At the risk of being totally pounced on here, I think the Yankees have made some really good deals this off-season, suffice it to say, I see them going to the big dance this year.|`|zMvGnlMraa	Yankees  Tigers  Angels  Rays - Wild Card|`|mqgS6Dfxaa	East: Red Sox  Central: Indians  West: Angels  Wild Card: Yankees|`|7zfcYRqwaa	East:  Yankees  Central:  Tigers  West:  Angles  Wildcard:  Red Sox|`|0TAld46gaa	West: Angels  East: Red Sox:  Central: Indians  Wildcard: Yankees|`|G0qBlKI1aa	tough to say, who woulld have thought last year that the Rays and the White Sox would have been in the playoffs?

Hard question though!!!|`|QoA9v1LGaa	jericho was awesome back in the day, but damn edge is on a roll.    i'll say edge.|`|IzgJpVgBaa	edge|`|pO0rfIv0aa	hmm.... i am going to have to say chris jericho.|`|1arO3vdjaa	edgehead here|`|I4tOY0Wjaa	I do hate them both.Jericho because he got my former favourite wrestler RVD out of the royal rumble.Edge because everything he did,Except for starting the u suck chants on kurt angle.I can't believe i'm saying this but Jericho I like better.|`|gXHxf2G9aa	Chris Jericho....he doesn't cheat to win....|`|VBfhoqS3aa	Jericho.|`|Xkm4PstOaa	Edge|`|oAjbBLDpaa	Jericho.

I think Edge is a better heel though because he plays that personality somewhat better than Jericho.|`|RJMrJN3waa	THE RATED R SUPERSTAR|`|skIPrlaVaa	edge because he knows how to work the crowd and when Jericho talks he sound boring like hell because he keeps the same tone voice unlike edge because he's more into his character

Would they not compare him to MJ anymore and more compare him to someone like Dominique Wilkins?|`|UadP6GO8aa	Either way it goes, LA fans will have excuses. If Bynum doesn't return, then it will be because Bynum was out. If Bynum does return and they still lose, then it will be because of the refs. But most likely Bynum should be back by then.|`|xldYvzw6aa	maybe, but this year i'm predicting that San Antonio gets a shot at boston.|`|keUqPWVuaa	Bynum won't be back this season, he has a torn MCL. 12 weeks is a early estimate, and thats if everything is perfect.

HE HAS A TORN MCL HE WON"T BE BACK, 8-12 WEEKS FOR AN MCL TEAR IS ALMOST LIKE RUBBING A LAMP AND ASKING FOR KAZAAM TO POP OUT OF THE BOTTLE, BUT SINCE HE PLAYS FOR THE SUNS IT AIN"T GONNA HAPPEN!|`|195d481e791fe6dd37323b342df9fa94aa	dumb statement like this makes me want to support the lakers but i back off when i realize im a heat fan so i shouldnt care but still.  dumb statement  if the heat cant win the title i hope the lakers can to shut up pricks like u.|`|iNcdGwmiaa	Of course they will. That's what they do. If their team wins it is because of Kobe. If their team loses it is because of everyone else. We all know this by now.|`|9iB1AiQlaa	If LA has Bynum back by then. Even the Celts will lose to LA in a re-match throwback finals.|`|Zc7H10w3aa	Yeah probably|`|RBdy17Ahaa	Wow you finally met your goal to create multiple accounts and then give yourself best answer in order to become a top contributor, pathetic. You still don't know ****.|`|i5MInqeMaa	Yes they will.  That was there main excuse last season, but i think he will be back since it's his other knee and not the one that had him out all season last year.|`|WtcTBlccaa	i think san antonio will stop lakers and the finals will be spurs vs celtics|`|2ynZARB4aa	of course.   The Lakers are good, but whenever they lose a game they have some excuse.  Bynam is good i like him better than Bryant who as a huge ego on him and when i saw him was lazy on the court, bynam kicked butt.   (im not a lakers girl, they were playing the Kings :)  The Lakers will use any excuse possible when they suck it
b30195e932765839f31a572f8d05c0f8aa	As of this point in time no action has been taken against Bonds by MLB.  Until such time that MLB takes action, and it may never occur, Bonds will be on the HOF ballot in 2013, and that is assuming he never plays again.  Once he is on the ballot those sports writers who have a vote will have to make a decision on an up or down vote.  They have the right to cast their vote either way without giving an explanation as to why they voted one way or another.  At this point in time, and given what Bonds is going through, I do not think he will get in on the first ballot.  However, time has a way of softening the hearts of many people and I believe we will see Bonds in the HOF at some point in time.  It really makes no difference if he is in or out, we all have the ability to come to our own conclusion as to how we feel about him.|`|m4MpQ258aa	it's because he's rich. us regular people have to drive to teh courtouuse in a regular car but he gets to use a limo.|`|zEzSGDLnaa	I think he will get into the Hall of fame, but it will be awhile before he does it.|`|ak5A435maa	i think Barry Bonds is a lying cheating idiot|`|KhBmlaefaa	I would like to see him in the HOF, sorry. He deserves to be.|`|Ar5VHDiBaa	is Limbo a small town in Iowa?|`|nqdDe3cJaa	i have never recognized any of these so called records he owns.  Roger Maris is the single season HR king with 61 and Hank Aaron holds the all time HR mark at 755.  i think just about the only organization outside of San Francisco that acknowledges Barrys marks is ESPN ...... and they dont care about reporting facts.  they are the exaggerated opinion not based on facts channel.      lol @ the race card being played.  yes ..... just like Whitey railroaded Hammerin' Hank ... right? Hanks 755 are legit .... Bonds has about 500 legit.  Bonds is a cheater, period ..... end of discussion.|`|5xIroQjMaa	He definitely deserves to be a first ballot Hall of Famer. You could make an argument that the big redhead doesn't deserve the Hall. Certainly, he had few numbers besides power, and was never more than an adequate fielder. Barry though, was the real deal. Power, average, OBP, Gold Gloves, SB (40/40 club anyone?). He played the game so far above anyone else's level it wasn't even funny. If he isn't a first ballot HOF, then it would be a travesty to the sport.     Of course if they won't let Pete Rose in, then they might not let Barry in. The two people that deserve it more than anyone else, regardless of indiscretions. The Hall is to enshrine the games greatest players...instead we have underserving players making it in (Jim Rice anyone?) while the best of the best end up on the outside looking in. No wonder the Hall has become such a joke.|`|tzrLDbHWaa	This coming from a Dodgers fan, so I'm highly biased against Bonds, but even so, Bonds is a first ballot hall of famer.  I don't care about the steroids thing, mainly because even without them he would have hit 600 HR and been in the 500/500 club.  Actually, without the roids he may have continued to run and gotten himself 600/600.  I hate Bonds.  I think he's a cheater, I think he helped to compromise the integrity of the game, but his stats are deserving.|`|obPSaYf3aa	I agree with the Dodgers fan, even though I'm a Giants fan!  He's a real die-hard baseball fan because he could care less about what the players ingested, injected or rubbed into their bodies.  That's their business because PED's have never been proven to aid athletes except in cases of traumatic injuries and infections when tissue and muscle infection and inflammation occurs.      The only proven things that steroids and PED's do to the body that is wide spread are the bad things, and they are:    Tighten and define your muscles to the point to where you cannot throw a baseball or swing a baseball bat.  (Barry and Clemens are flabby and not solidly built or cut like people that abuse steroids)      Lessen and diminish your eyesight to the point where you cannot see a high speed ball pitched to you or the target of a strike zone.  (Never saw either Barry or Roger wear contact lenses or glasses due to diminished eyesight)      Diminish your psyche and make you prone to depression and anger induced rage so that you would constantly miss check-in time at the ball park or miss transportation to and from away games, would always fight with teammates, have an attitude that would keep you always calling in sick and always sulking or crying for no reason.  (I've never seen either Barry or Roger display any of these behaviors nor have they been reprimanded for missing planes or being late to the park)     It will make you extremely sick and you would definitely die if you are a PED junkie, fiend or abuser, like the media tends to call them and some members of the public believes because they're gullible and can't stand the truth.    Why would Barry end up in limbo when it's the decision of the federal government and not MLB's or the fan's call after the perjury trial?|`|3mZyMnjfaa	he will never get in  the hall just like big mac and clemns until they come out and admit that they took them|`|AOZvz2dpaa	Barry Bonds, greatest hitter of all time    thats what i think|`|AA10425091	Whites have been after Bonds for years..

3bEXhkFpaa	maybe if you were an actual warriors fan you would watch their games and realize biedrins is the **** and has been for like 2 years. |`|H8u7gMAYaa	It hasnt overnight. Its took him awhile to develop his game.    He was starting to look good last season.|`|GIVarsPnaa	Obviously you havent been paying attention until now. He started improving his game entirely near the end of last season and so far it has carried over. He is still very young so expect him to put up more dominant numbers near the future.|`|4DcvpQXfaa	this year he will reach his prime!    he can give you at least 16 points,14 rebounds and 2 blocks,AMAZING!    |`|kYBlgFQAaa	He played with the Latvian national team over the summer and was the go-to guy.  He was in a situation where he was required to score more.  He's always been good at put backs and dunks around the basket.  But, over the summer he focused on creating his own shot with a variety of moves around the basket.  He's really improved using the dribble and driving to the hoop.  He still has a lot more upside.    But like Ryan points out, he's been good for a while.   He led the league in FG% last year.  I wouldn't call that bad.|`|oGBEl25jaa	im not trying to take away from him. his stats are great. but look at the team.    there is like no one to do those things.   jackson is probably the only one better then him on that team and now he is doing better.  al doesnt want to be there  but corey is starting to play now so his numbers might drop a little.  and they have ellis out.    but still big ups to him. whoever has him in fantasy is really happy right now

BhNP2P8Xaa	Larry Fitzgerald will probably go down as one of the best receivers to play the game. Ever.     He needs to stay healthy, of course, and he needs to play for a team that has a QB that can get the ball to him. But, I've been watching football for maybe 35 years, and it's been a long time since I've seen a guy who has such effortless ability to get the ball in his hands and use his speed to his advantage. The fact they the Steelers managed to keep him covered for as long as they did last night is a testament to their defense.    However, once they backed off him a little, and once Warner saw him getting open, they couldn't stop him. if he had managed to get the ball more often in the first half, the outcome of the game would have been very different.    Santonio Holmes is a very good receiver, and he had the advantage of being exactly where he needed to be to make that catch (remember, he missed a pass on the previous play, when the ball zipped right through his hands on a tremendous pass from Ben). The TD catch was two real good players connecting when they needed to. You don't have to be the best at your position. You have to be where you need to at the right moment, and they were. That's what wins championships.    But as far as a better receiver, Fitzgerald wins that argument, hands down.|`|lHDff8Braa	Huge Steelers fan here, but Fitzgerald should have been MVP.|`|aaKYVMk2aa	I'm a Steelers fan but Holmes can't compete against Fitzgerald.|`|Roes9U61aa	Fitzgerald is possible the best WR in the league right now|`|f7qVtYfaaa	oh my god there is no comparison|`|e53807be9e34b50fae02ba7c73274c6baa	Really?   You would pick Holmes over Fitzgerald in a fantasy football draft?     I don't believe you.  Fitzgerald is better.|`|nfCH7nkTaa	Fitzgerald is the best in the NFL, holmes isn't even close to him|`|RoUFSloWaa	im a steeler fan but I say Fitzgerald  the dude is a beast|`|njLVIp55aa	Fitzgerald!!! By far!!!|`|d5368f798fac0323fe025ec0d32f5be6aa	im a steeler fan and im saying Fitzgerald. dude can hold onto crazy passes and is mad fast.    Holmes just came through in a cluth at the right time and is awesome.|`|IGbEZZlraa	Honestly, I think that they are both AMAZING! Funny thing is, my roommate is a HUGE Fitzgerald fan (even refers to him as her fiance) and I am a HUGE Holmes fan. I gotta give them both credit. I really can't say that one is better than the other because they both have their strengths and weaknesses but in the end, they both play a da*n good game of football!|`|mTSOJKlyaa	Lets just say if Pitts had Fitz (rhymed)    then it would have been like no contest|`|A7EhUyiTaa	STEELERS ARE BEASTS!!!

h9PVRHPWaa	Because their not old enough to have watched WCW. At the end WCW was horrible. It didn`t deserve to die it should have been executed.|`|F3VjJAdiaa	I don't blame that big headed freak for the downfall of WCW. Though at the same time, he hasn't done anything with the name and dumped most of the wrestlers at the time. Like he said, He just put it on a shelf and will never use it.|`|AugWKsuJaa	I agree with you to a degree. WCW stabbed itself over and over trying to compete with WWE. They let people like Nash and HollyWoood Hogan put themselves over and drive away younger talent. They BOOKED DAVID ARQUETTE TO WIN THE WCW WORLD HEAVYWEIGHT CHAMPIONSHIP! I don't think Vince is the be-all, end-all of the wrestling universe, but he does take a bit of a bad rep for people failing buisness-wise.    AWA....didn't change with the times.    ECW.....Bad, VERY bad financial planning.    Most of NWA's territories......just couldn't keep pace with Vince.    WCW.......bad booking, unbalanced paying, poor buisness judgement.|`|InX5Pfl5aa	I do not think I have heard anyone blame Vince for WCW's death >.>.    I always knew it was Ted Turners fault...|`|QY4Hy00qaa	I don't know why people keep blaming Vince Mcmahon for the death of WCW, the people they should blame is the people who who were running it. Look the people who were running WCW did not know anything about running a wrestling company, but Vince does since his family has been in the wrestling business for years.|`|bGAv6Gjpaa	I don't blame Vince for WCW downfall it Eric bushoff fault he use TED turner in the wrong way and TED was not going to lose money in the wrestling company he want to make money like Vince McMahon but that didn't happen if you have to pay big stars like hogan and nash and hall and all of the locker room was saying that they got fat pay check then who do you blame for that the guy that hire them that would be Eric bushoff so Vince didn't have anything to do with WCW downfall!|`|3icTrKLLaa	Who knows.    WCW was screwed since about midway through 98. That was the worst produced wrestling i have ever seen in my life. It killed itself.|`|O6VTWYDtaa	jeff farty ruined wcw|`|it2UVkF4aa	Because, they're marks. And marks don't know the differrence between what happened and what really happened.|`|0Dm3WEMcaa	Simple    Some idiots don't have a clue what they are talking about.    Vince bought the remains of a company that killed itself with bad booking and Ted Turner spending millions on talent way past there sell by date. Vince did try to buy them out and they refused to sell to him. Fact is Vince did nothing but make a more popular show and buy the rights to everything after they died.|`|475ca662f051679937b7c94c642a9d64aa	Can't really blame Vince McMahon, as he kept beating WCW in the ratings in the late 90's and WCW had the worst bookings late on when they gave David Arquette the WCW Title and so on. And then Vince McMahon bought WCW out
s9Pwnb87aa	I believe it was a fumble. What about you?    Is that your Pittsburgh Steelers bikini?|`|AA10568019	No.  Is that really your photo?  If it is, will you marry me?|`|9iB1AiQlaa	They called it earlier in the game, it should have been an incompletion then hail mary to win it.|`|C66eg6YXaa	FUMBLE !!!|`|8Y583Fluaa	i dont know what these people were watching but it was  aincomplete pass and it was called a incomplete pass after review|`|OJ79IraJaa	Even if it wasn't a fumble, the Steelers would've most likely stopped them anyway.  Plus,  the Cards had the lead late in the game, all they had to do was stop them.|`|eqDXoCeTaa	Yes.  He didn't have control of the ball while his arm was coming forward.  Even if they did review, it wouldn't have been overturned.|`|33f4c852804fa42db9a7cbb912480080aa	Incomplete pass...His arm was going FORWARD before the ball left it...|`|fc5a2676d0a9ea687d91d44050637158aa	Fumble...    the first call was correct..they labeled it a fumble first and got it right as a incomplete pass..    the last play of the game was not an incomplete pass and the refs were tired and they wanted to go home..and its pressing his luck to think the refs wanted to be a part of the outcome..|`|rzkFHAEJaa	I can see how you'd question that, as the arm was coming up to move forward, but I take it, it has to actually be moving forward. So if he were cocking his arm back to throw and it got knocked out, it would be a fumble. It seems if the arm is cocked back, and he's in the part of throwing, the arm isn't in a forward motion, but upward, that's not good enough. yeah one more chance!!|`|nATkIg5zaa	It was definitley a fumble he did not throw his arm forward...|`|D6yvUKm3aa	i thought it was incomplete but pittsburgh would have still won|`|jpiFhg1Jaa	Clearly a fumble...just like the refs said it was.|`|6Ojpl6viaa	In the rule book the QB has to have total control of the ball before his arm starts in a forward motion.  Look at the first fumble that was over turned.  With the second one, he had lost control of the ball on the wind up.  It was the right call to be a fumble.|`|xGxHkj8faa	Fumble, his arm was going forward without the ball in it.

geih5vR8aa	I can't do this. There is just so many good hitters, it really doesn't matter who you choose... so I'll just choose Giants players first, then attempt to do an all time lineup.    Giants All time lineup:    1. Bobby Bonds   2. Will Clark  3. Willie Mays  4. Barry Bonds   5. Mel Ott  6. Willie McCovey   7. Jeff Kent   8. Matt Williams   9. Kevin Mitchell or Pitcher    -- One of those guys is gonna have to play catcher, and another shortstop... lol.    Pitchers:    1. Christy Mathewson  2. Tim Lincecum (hey, he won us a Cy Young.)  3. Juan Marichal  4. Amos Russie (1950 K's, in only 9 seasons.)  5. Jason Schmidt (He was awesome as a Giant)    Closer:    Rob Nenn, or Rod Beck.    All time lineup period:    1. Ricky Henderson  2. Ty Cobb  3. Babe Ruth  4. Barry Bonds  5. Hank Aaron  6. Willie Mays  7.Lou Gehrig   8.Ted Williams  9. Rogers Hornsby    Pitchers:    1. Walter Johnson  2. Christy Mathewson  3. Cy Young  4. Warren Spahn  5. Grover Alexander       Of Course, you can't have a lineup of all outfielders and first basemen.    So my OFFICIAL  lineup would look like this.    1. Ty Cobb (L) CF  2. Honus Wagner (R) SS  3. Babe Ruth (L) DH  4. Willie Mays (R) RF  5. Barry Bonds (L) LF  6. A-Rod (R) 3B  7. Lou Gehrig (L) 1B  8. Johnny Bench/ or Josh Gibson (R) C  9. Rogers Hornsby/Jeff Kent (R) 2B    With Hank Aaron, Ted Williams, Joe DiMaggio, Stan Musial, Mark McGuire on the bench.    And it pwn's all of your other guy's lineups. A lot of these guys have TONS of speed,AND power.|`|sEPrpdY4aa	Your 1-4 is pretty good and is the generally "accepted" philosophy of devising batting orders.  I think after that, it really just comes down to your going from your best to the worst hitters.      However, I do have a simpler, more radical view that's just straight up arranging your hitters in order of best to worst based on OPS (on base percentage plus slugging) with no consideration for speed (stolen bases are an overrated stat).  Many managers make the mistake of putting fast baserunners leadoff but otherwise are weak hitters based on OBP and lack power.  Fundamentally, a hitter's job is simply to get as many bases as possible for each at bat.  Instead, it makes far more sense to me to have your very best hitters get the most at bats, so why not put all your power hitters that get on base higher in the lineup.  Thus Albert Pujols, for example would be my ideal leadoff hitter as he gets on-base at a ridiculous clip and has tremendous power potential with each at bat.|`|KnY8HXtPaa	Best Line up (active players)    1. Jose Reyes (table setter)  2. Orlando Hudson (a guy who can move reyes into scoring position)  3. Matt Holiday or David Wright (a guy who has a nuclear bat and some speed)  4. Albert Pujols (Power hitter with a great OBP.)  5. Carlos Beltran (a well rounded hitter that can drive in runs)  6. Nick Johnson (a batter who can work the count and has a high OBP.)  7. Daniel Murphy (young hitter who can give you some pop)  8. Skip Schumaker (another table setter)  9. Pitcher or worst hitter|`|aN9osRq8aa	1. Usually the person with one of the highest batting averages.  They need to get on base for the next hitters.    2. Contact hitter.  They sacrifice themselves to move the runner.    3. Best OBP.  Just needs to get on and not bounce into a double play.    4. Player with most HR's, or extra base hits.    It's basically a cycle.  2 sets of 4.  5th hitter is usually like the 1st, 6th like the 2nd and so on.      the 9th hitter can be the worst hitter on the team, or one of the best hitters.  You don't want a rally ruiner at the end of the lineup. (i.e Brandon Inge)    1. Gil Coan.  Look him up, it's interesting.    2. Placido Polanco.    3. Miguel Cabrera    4.  Mike Schmidt    5. Joe Jackson    6. Pudge    7. A-Rod    8. Big Papi    9. Joe DiMaggio    The best hitting pitcher, I would have to say is C.C. Sabathia|`|5xIroQjMaa	Using current MLB players, this would be my lineup. For realistic purposes, I didn't double up on positions, so it's a real lineup    1) Rafael Furcal SS  2) Ichiro RF  3) Alex Rodriguez 3B  4) Manny Ramirez DH  5) Albert Pujols  1B  6) Vladimir Guerrero CF  7) Dustin Pedroia 2B  8) Russell Martin C (Joe's a better hitter, but Russ has speed so I chose him for 8 spot)  9) Carl Crawford LF|`|mqgS6Dfxaa	I agree with your descriptions.  I coached my son in Little League and I always use the double leadoff guy in the  9 spot.  Usually a younger kid that may not hit for a high average yet but gets a lot of walks and is quick.  Tony LaRussa uses the same philosophy quite a bit when he bats his pitcher 8th and another player 9th.    Here's my lineup to match your descriptions using active players.  Not so much the best team but using the players that best fit the lineup.  1. SS Hanley Ramirez (could easily switch Ramirez with Ichiro)  2. 2B Dustin Pedroia (Chase Utley could be another option)  3. 3B Alex Rodriguez  4. 1B Albert Pujols  5. DH Justin Morneau  6. OF Josh Hamilton  7. OF Grady Sizemore (could really put any OF here)  8. C Brian McCann  9.OF Ichiro Suzuki (not really a number 9 hitter but will be for this team)|`|AA11537248	1) The team's fastest player that can get on base, team's  1 base stealer, high batting average, not necessarily a power hitter.    2) A disciplined, medium-powered hitter that has some speed.  Somebody who can draw a walk, hit into a sacrifice to advance the  1 batter, or just get on base.    3) Your 3rd best hitter on the team.  Somebody who won't hit into a double play, and advance the 1st two runners.    4) Cleanup hitter - he team's best hitter.  Your best chance for an extra base hit to knock home ant of the first three hitters.  Typically, a slow, defensively weak player.    5) The team's 2nd best hitter.  Just incase the  4 hitter strikes out, as power hitters are prone to do.    6) Teams 2nd worst hitter.  Defensive player like a catcher or a wiry shortstop.  Somebody who is just happy to get on base.    7) Team's worst hitter.  A defensive player, a substitute, or a salary cap sacrifice.  Someone with a     8) Your 4th best hitter.  Also known as the "second cleanup".  Somebody who can hit the 5,6,or 7 slot batter home if they can get on base.    9) Pitcher.  Good for a bunt...maybe.|`|zEzSGDLnaa	interesting question      1.

mMFJrPbvaa	Well theres a reason for the saying...Cotton Kills.  It`s because once it`s wet it takes forever to dry.  If you were out an extended amount of time without anything extra you would probably suffer from Hypothermia.      You want synthetics and wool.  Preferably wool socks than cotton socks, wool keeps you warm even when it is soaking wet.  It also pulls aka wicks the moisture from your skin to prevent you from feeling cold.  There are dozens if not hundreds of types of material that perform in this manner.  Instead of listing a bunch of brands that may mean nothing to you go to backpacker.com and read over their gear reviews.  Also, backcountry.com has a lot of great products that are inexpensive, and they come with user reviews.
r5AMG8g7aa	The fact that you believe you are in a certain belt range is the first problem here. You simply are not qualified to make that judgment.  I applaud you for your commitment. four years is a good start. However, you must realize that four years is barely the beginning. Your rank matter a lot less than your ability. As for where can you test. I doubt any legitimate gym would allow you to juts test with them. I could be wrong, but I would seriously question the legitimacy of any that would.  And I'm sure that there are those that would for a fee test you. After all the MMA in general is growing much faster than the number of legitimate instructors.|`|C0sT0PPyaa	No man...come on!  you telling me you spent four years with your instructor and he hasn't answered this.  And what do you mean hes super super knowledable.  my dad can beat up your dad, cause hes the toughest.  your not at purple belt level...try training at a real school, youll have your eyes opened    and you can't get a strip without knowing how to tie your belt.     YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND.  A belt means nothing.  anyone can give it to you.  you want a black belt that certified so you can say 'hey im certified'. It means nothing.  Now if Machado, or Gracie is your instructor or someone like that and you have a color belt you can bet your good, but it doesn't mean your good....your only as good as you are.  To want a belt testing from whoever 'legit' means nothing.  get a belt from your instructor and wear it with pride.  Gracie belts are just fake Jiu Jitsu belt that are made famous and come with alot of respect but they are no more legit than anything.     WHO WOULD GIVE YOU A BELT AND WHY?|`|dc6f042f0a1f241b0647713f95aefc3aaa	If your school is a certified BJJ school then you can test under any BJJ instructor but keep in mind that you will have to request the review and be willing to travel and train with them for a little while before you will be accepted to promote.    Most BJJ schools I have worked out with do not have formalized belt testings. They simply grade you up a rank when you are ready by handing you a new belt and certificate. BJJ is an art that you learn using the gi. If your school does not use the belt system and they do not require a gi then it is a safe bet that you are being lied to and it is not real BJJ.|`|HO26GMWCaa	I'm not sure I understand, are you asking if you can change schools with the skill you have and move into the new school with the belt you had at the old one? If so I doubt it, since belts are chosen by your trainer when he feels you have adequately shown him your skills. Also I believe in order to obtain a Black Belt in most places you will have to show immense skill both with and without a gi.    EDIT: Sadly I'm afraid that's the way it goes, no offense, and i wouldn't know since I haven't been, but I doubt the legitimacy of any BJJ school that doesn't give belts.|`|AbcGOAFjaa	The best w
6HwcJDbiaa	What made the Bulls Championship run unique was that it was built around one player. It is quite difficult to do this, most teams need two great players. Although some may win one or perhaps two championships building around one star, it is rare to build such a dynasty like the Bulls did with Jordan.    Now, as good as Scottie Pippen was, and I was a huge fan of his, his production dropped of significantly when Jordan retired and Pippen went to the Rockets and Blazers. Although he was productive for Houston and Portland, Pippen saw about a 30-40% reduction in his productivity.During the 93-94 season when Jordan retired Pippen had some great numbers, but he was never able to duplicate that kind of production outside of a Phil Jackson coached team.     I have a hard time envisioning the Bulls winning six rings without Jordan. Who would they have drafted instead? Sam Perkins? Charles Barkley? With Barkley they may have been able to get a decent run in the playoffs, but I have a hard time seeing a Barkley Bulls team beating the Knicks with Patrick Ewing in the playoffs.  The Bulls did draft Olympic runner Carl Lewis in 1984 with the 208th pick, but they never signed him. Could he have helped? No, probably not, but it is interesting to know that he was drafted.     Now as far as the Blazers go, we all accept the fact that Sam Bowie brought nothing to them. The Blazers managed to win conference titles in 1990 and 1992, and a division title in 1991. So the Blazers were relevant even without any real contribution from Sam Bowie. Add Jordan to that mix and it does not seem too crazy to say that the Blazers could have won at least one of two championships. The Blazers won 63 games one year (1992 I believe), so it is easy to imagine them making a run at 70 wins if they had Jordan on their team.    But of course this is all just speculation, the Blazers drafted Bowie. It is interesting to think about though, thanks for asking.    P.S. I wonder if we are going to be having this conversation about Oden/Durant in 20 years?|`|BiMkowVMaa	Wow that is funny. My friend and I just had this same conversation.    Portland would've ran the league between Jordan and Drexler. I don't know if the Bulls would've never won a ring because obviously they got the draft picks they got based on the team record they got with Jordan. Thus maybe they never get Scottie Pippen, but maybe the Bulls get Patrick Ewing in '85 because they would have a worse record w/o Jordan being on the team for a higher draft pick.  They would be a playoff team, but I don't think a championship winning one.    So I think possibly the Trailblazers and Jordan would of won a couple of rings. That team was already stacked. The Bulls had to be built before they dominated the league.    My friend and I also thought "What if the Lakers chose Dominique Wilkins instead of James Worthy in the '82 Draft?" I can imagine at least one or two more rings with Wilkins in that Showtime offense.    Interesting question though.|`|98wFqBwSaa	The Bulls would not have won with out him, because he was catalyst of that team and the ruler of the dynasty.  The Blazers would have one because Clyde the Glide actually faced Michael in the Finals and lost.|`|PgFYPZg2aa	Maybe cause Reinsdorf became committed early to building a team around MJ, with Clyde already in Portland it would've taken a lot for the team to became so one player committed like the Bulls did(remember they sucked hard before he got there and were rebuilding when he got there)
UoT86gbiaa	Most fantasy sports give you the choice of playing either head-to-head or "cumulative" (in baseball that format is called rotisserie).  So there's fantasy basketball out there that could give you the matchups that you enjoyed with football, you just got in the wrong type of league.    Baseball is completely different from any other fantasy sport.  It requires much more statistical analysis and you have to manage your team virtually every day for six months.  I personally enjoy it, but it's not at all the same experience as playing fantasy football.|`|piM3bj9Gaa	There is much more to baseball than football.  Usually, baseball consists of 10 categories.  AVG, HR, RBI, Runs, and SB for offense.  Wins, Saves, K's, ERA, and WHIP (walks + hits/innings pitched)  for pitching.  Depending on the league, it can be much much more.  Also, it can be done head to head by week or cumulative for the season.|`|0TAld46gaa	baseball is a long season so everyday you will have to make changes.  I enjoy it but it's not for everyone|`|xQFWjFyZaa	Baseball is for the true fantasy players. You have to change your lineup every day of the 162 game season in order to win. It's much, much harder to predict than Football. The scoring is pretty much the same as Basketball though.|`|lbGVdgr1aa	I think baseball is the most fun of all of them.  Because, you actually have to manage a little|`|AzeWH9g4aa	Fantasy baseball is more challenging.  You must constantly rotate your pitchers on a daily basis.  Sometimes you may update your roster weekly, but at times, teams will change pitchers to pitch on other days.  It is almost like fantasy basketball where you must pay attention to your lineup.  Football is easy due to their one game a week schedule.  If you are up to the challenge, then fantasy baseball is for you.|`|gUMucKOkaa	Yes, it is a blast. The answer to your question depends upon whether you play roto, which is cumulative, or head 2 head, which is weekly and more like the  football leagues.     H2H is still different from football because of different categories of scoring.     Give it a try. Good luck.

Tambin no hay que olvidarse que viene de una familia muy humilde y a los 19 a?os ya era sper famoso y millonrio.

cd92ff973326b9bc62e38f55bd2853adaa	A torcida do Cruzeiro  uma das mais civilizadas do Brasil  Tem as mulheres mais lindas de Minas, tem os torcedores mais exigentes.     Pelo fato de cobrar sempre, e n?o apoiar "s por apoiar", tem um time acostumado a ganhar ttulos, copeiro.    E hoje  a mais fantica de Minas. Sei que os caninos aqui v?o discordar, mas quem ama o time n?o fica aplaudindo qualquer coisa. Quando o time vai mal, o torcedor azul sofre, e realmente n?o fica cantando de alegria. Quando perde ou empata, n?o comemora. Quando est mal, n?o vai ao campo por protesto.    Torcedor que vai ao campo mesmo quando o time est uma baba, que canta hino mesmo na derrota, que comemora empate, n?o torce para o seu time, torce pra prpria torcida. E por isto, o time dela morre.|`|ZD6xJFMcaa	POR ISSO QUE EU DIGO: Ser Cruzeirense  bom demais!!!!    estou sempre no Mineir?o....Vejo de perto a alegria que  essa torcida.

p9Wtbizuaa	Thats the whole point of the playoffs. Cause usally the best team wins. Also the whole point of AFC and NFC is to see who is the best team out of those leagues and then whoever wins the superbowl is the best out of the NFL.|`|Rj3epU5yaa	that would make since but you have to understand the history of football to correctly answer this question.      yes it would be fair.  i mean back in the late 80's and early 90's the championship game was generally the NFC championship game every year.  Cowboys vs 49ers.|`|eqDXoCeTaa	For the same reason the West play the East in the NBA finals.  For the same reason the AL plays the NL in the World Series.  That's how it's always been, and should be.    The Cards were one of the two best teams.  They didn't lose in the playoffs.|`|okV8A1Ayaa	Why dont we just scrap the playoffs and adopt a BCS like system would that make you happy.|`|szqMXvlSaa	to c who is the best|`|UHip02Gxaa	Because the winner of one conference has to play the winner of the other conference in order to determine the best team in the country.|`|mMKayhNGaa	if that happened then half the country would have no one to route for and then it could be the same two teams years in a row|`|sMssDP1Xaa	The Super Bowl rarely represents the two best teams.  You have to have enough wins to make it to the playoffs and then you need to be playing well.  Look at the Steelers in 2005, and Giants in 2007, and the Cardinals in 2008.  None of these teams had great seasons but happened to do what they needed to do when it got down to the playoffs.  The Titans, Ravens, and Panthers played great all season but didn't win then they had to but they could have just as easily made it to the Super Bowl if they had.|`|AA10568019	The AFC and the NFC descended from the old AFL and the NFL.  Before those leagues merged they agreed to play a game between their two champions.  It was later named The Super Bowl.  They have continued that tradition because "if it ain't broke don't fix it" and it ain't broke.|`|rzkFHAEJaa	Tradition. They were two different leagues to begin with. It was about who had the better league. So now they are two conferences within the NFL.|`|2ieiGIhTaa	All major American sports pit the winners of the two conferences against each other.    Tradition is a good thing.|`|DWJOMWQ8aa	They are the 2 best teams. The best team in the NFC faces off against the best team in the AFC.

Would drop Flanners at hooker    (EDIT: Also would look at Thierry Dusautoir as a flanker option!)|`|mAIl9POsaa	i suggest u put in rob kearney somewhere. hes playing well and he should perform well for ireland and id say he'll start every match.|`|hNZ3wflHaa	You have some great players.

AA10361042	if you start quinn get him in your lineup soon.  They play tonight|`|eBptoeTCaa	Go with Quinn. It'll be risky but if he can get the ball to Braylon Edwards, Donte Stallworth and Kellen Winslow he should to alright.... Assuming they don't turn up the running game to keep the ball out of his hands and that Braylon learns how to catch a ball!! McNabb will have a mediocre game against the Giants so if you are okay with mediocroty and want to play it safe then he should get the nod. The scary thing about Quinn is that nobody really knows what is going to happen (especially because of the short week).... but he's surrounded with some good receivers and has a pretty solid line to protect him so he should do well.|`|Lhfs2NZYaa	start quinn|`|9xZFlH45aa	Gotta go with McNabb anyway.  He's got too many weapons:  Curtis, Westy, Jackson, Brown, Smith...and the Giants will have to load the box with Westbrook in there, meaning single coverage against those great receivers.|`|X09XFoqfaa	I would play McNabb. This will be Quinn's first start in pro game ever. For the vast majority, rookies struggle (well he is not a rookie but has been sitting). McNabb has Westbrook and a descent receiving core.|`|VT5pjvMKaa	I have the same issue.  McNabb has been my QB all year, but just picked up Quinn and am tempted to start him tonight!  I think I'm going to resist the temptation and go with the safer play with McNabb.  My worry is that they'll run all night, and have Quinn manage the game.  Maybe some short passes, but they'll keep it simple.  McNabb is sure to have at least an average game, with a chance at a shootout.
CX7ssmHZaa	First, depending on their age,let them have fun.  Second, challenge them each game with different goals. For example, on your next game, tell them to score two goals or something that you know that they are capable of doing. Then, each game, raise the bar and you might see some improvement.|`|DEcunDd5aa	-more training sessions  -harder drills  -longer practises|`|cebd1da14b90fded5759c9eb218abf56aa	Well we had a losing team for half a season.

But what a great way to practice with everyone in a line.|`|vkLlip9Naa	get a cattle prong and use it for punishment, lol no j/k just be supportive and make sure they have fun. What else could you do?|`|AA11187156	Build some team unity. Show them the feelings of success as a team in something outside of soccer. Watch basic training videos with pizza. Work and train hard.  The more physical they work the easier soccer becomes.|`|fZCqAfV9aa	maybe you should try a different style.. i mean.. maybe the coaching technique of the former coach wasn't working for them.. build unity it the team.. maybe there's some problems within the players that haven't been resolved and is affecting their game.. be confident of your players.. when the players feel that you don't have confidence in them, they won't be playing well in the games.. and always be happy! the players need inspiration.. and you should be their inspiration.. if you show that you are  not happy with them, they will start to feel bad and suck at the games..

kZHQ4CEaaa	did anyone really expect Alabama to be this far this year?  to go from where they were last year to where they are this year?  no, they are not over rated they have over achieved this year,i don't expect them to make it to the national championship but i am very happy with the leaps and bounds of progress they have made.  as for the SEC, well Florida will in all likeliness be in the championship game,you tell me the team you think will blow them away, for that matter bama will be in a big bowl game too,tell me the team that will blow them away?  no the SEC may be down a little this year, but they are far from over rated.  now USC vs stanford,tell which team there is over rated.  wasn't Penn st and ohio st ranked high this year?  what high ranked team knocked them down?  who do you think was over rated there?  SEC will have 5-6 bowl teams  again this year,we will win over half of those.  who will be over rated then?|`|CgYeqsK2aa	the SEC is down as a whole this year , BUT Florida is still going to blow the big 12 representative away in MIAMI      GATOR NATION IS EVERYWHERE!!    oh and do you want the good news ?

The league is not the best this year, that honor belongs to the Big 12, but I haven't really heard anyone say that it was. The SEC is still better than the Pac10, ACC, etc. It's just having a down year that has to be expected every once and awhile.|`|YCwmCDkUaa	No....No|`|vdh6cwUvaa	http://www.anonymousspace.com/albums/use...|`|uR8xD4Xaaa	No. The Big 12 is overrated.|`|6taSSxDVaa	SEC...No.  Alabama...Without a doubt!!!|`|6162d52a4fe0e7f57d1ae7e2e62797f5aa	yes, and yes|`|mUG8XtNpaa	No, and frankly I'm getting sick of having to tell people this. Alabama's offense is really nothing special. They don't depend on their offense to win games. It's the DEFENSE that keeps them in ballgames and gives them a chance to win.    I can't stand people who only look at the scoreboard and don't bother to look at individual stats. WHEN Alabama has the ball, they're very efficient. |`|5d1c602b7300af01b810eaf8c7e5e500aa	Yes, both are.|`|b6093140ca442da8cb84d6fe462aa1e4aa	SEC is badly over rated! Alabama is suppose to be the  1 team and they are losing now to an unranked miss state team? SEC is not the best conference.

2ece24deba6e7760d2c205b331e95863aa	You can find a link to silencer manufacturers here, http://www.silencertalk.com/links.htm .  They can all refer you to a dealer in your state.  A list of dealers in your state can be found here, http://www.subguns.com/c2c3/c2c3.htm .  http://www.silencertalk.com and http://www.subguns.com are good places for advice.   http://www.impactguns.com/store/ is a good place to buy.  http://www.gunbroker.com is a good auction site.    Buying online is legal, but you must go through a dealer if the buyer and seller are in different states.  If you buy from a person in your own state, you do not need to use a dealer, but you must submit the ATF form 4 and pay the $200 tax first just as if you used a dealer.    For those of you who think silencers are illegal, you need to live in  AL, AR, AK, AZ, CO, CT, FL, GA, ID, IN, KS, KY, LA, ME, MD, MS, MT, NE, ND, NV, NH, NM, NC, OH, OK, OR, PA, SC, SD, TN, TX, UT, VA, WA, WV, WI, or WY to own a silencer without a license.  There is also a $200 tax to pay for each one you make or buy.  The good part is that the ATF routinely approves any application that is filled out correctly.     Ranb|`|mFa5ZDtcaa	I can understand your need.

It's perfectly legal to own a silencer if you follow thepaper traill, and pay the tax stamp.

Not all dealers are class 3.    It is correct that you will have to pay the Government a $200.00 tax stamp.    And then wait for them to approve you bbeforeyou can pick up your item from your local class 3 dealer.|`|0cLj35Fgaa	To get one legally, you would have to shell out a good sum of money ($200 tax and another few hundred for the suppressor).  If I were you, I would just try to get one "under the table".  You can usually get them in a large city.    Personally, I would never pay that much money for a piece of metal that makes a firearms somewhat quieter.  Don't pay the tax.  Get it on the street or ask a machinist to make one for you.|`|yL3XFS7faa	To the guy that said some garbage about buying silencers "under the table" in the city:    Whens the last time you've ever been to a big city, any city?! (any state near arkansas doesnt count.) You don't just go into some back alley way and there's a silencer salesman flipping silencers out a briefcase
d1b38b13b953ba1dbaf4d9bcd50f9de4aa	It would possibly make things more interesting, and if it shut the eco-warriors up for five minutes it would be worthwhile. I don't have any problem with it, anyway. Doing the equivalency between a turbodiesel and an F1 petrol engine would keep the FIA awake for a month...different output, different torque, diferent weight...actually it sounds like a worthwhile exercise, just to stop the FIA meddling with anything else for a while.|`|HimBbU6caa	I like Gary D's answer. If refueling with bio biesel makes pitstops too long they can eliminate refueling during stops altogether. That would as Rosbif stated shut up the eco warriors (I understand their passion) and make our sport much safer.    Edit: I disagree with the last part of Gary D's answer. I have never been a fan of racers winning or losing a race in the pits. I think fans would prefer drivers to overtake on the circuit. The less time spent in the pits means more time on track. I think tire changes and wing adjustments is more than enough action for pit workers and fans. I go to youtube and watch accidents and crashes so that I never forget how important safety should be in any sport.  A ban on refueling would increase safety and would in no way have an adverse effect on the overall show in my opinion.|`|o1fgTGzzaa	I think diesel engines should be considered.  Over the past few years sales of diesel cars have increased dramatically.  F1 technology reflects what you may see in road cars of the not to distant future.  The additional torque of the diesel engines may make them faster also.    But being realistic, this is hard to achieve as it is a major change which teams would find especially hard to cope with.  All it needs is for one f1 team to run a diesel engine with success and the rest will follow suit. (e.g. audi in le mans, started with a diesel and now all the top cars are diesel!)|`|f71bc553ce48de0d47d00ce15fd871aaaa	two things,     one the diesels in le mans racing are so dominant because of performance advantages gives to the diesel team as an incentive to "go green" the only way id support a diesel option engine was if all teams were allowed unrestricted engine development, other wise we are going to get advantages in the name a parity     number 2 the le mans diesels are all but silent, what would f1 be like if the tires were louder than the engine?|`|m4BS0Bjraa	diesel is the fuel of the devil|`|f1Hhl3Beaa	Audi and Peugeot have shown that Diesels in top-end motorsport can be as good and better than conventional petrol units. The different engine types give different torque and power curves that could be an interesting variable in Formula 1, as it has done in sportscar racing. The FIA seems to be pursuing an image of a environmentally safe world of motorsport, having reached such a high level of driver, car and audience safety already, so it would be a viable option certainly, and might attract companies to enter as a means of both marketing and applying the technology to road use, as with Audi and Peugeot.    I see no problem with diesels in F1, as the racing versions are so far away for the clank and rattle of road car diesel engines, and would be an interesting avenue for F1 to look into. With regards to the choice element, that too would be very interesting, as it has been in ALMS and the Le Mans Series.|`|KTxxd700aa	A disadvantage, Lewis would be waiting for the glow plugs on his c220d to go out while the Ferrari drivers spark plugs need no pre heat!  Nah I'm messin with ya, a great idea, more economical and environmentally less obtrusive and completely different engine characteristics, more low down grunt, lower revving and a different sound, bring it on I say! Not sure if diesel could run alongside petrol in a 2hr race but I'll leave that to people with smarts.|`|a6EndAPiaa	The problem with biodiesel (like they use in the American LeMans Series [ALMS]) is that it takes forever and a day to fill the tanks because the fuel tends to foam up if you pump it too quickly.  I do not think that is the case with regular diesel but I am not sure.    Can you imagine F1 with pit stops that now take 45 seconds or more?  I can not  that would be so boring.     I understand why that is not a big deal in endurance racing but in F1 it would mean no more refueling.  The cars would all begin with enough fuel to complete the race so they did not loose all that time in the pits.    I think that would be a very bad idea.|`|i3PGjRRfaa	Check out the biodiesel cars in the ALMS series.............    OUTSTANDING vehicles.  So good that the series changed regulations because the bio diesel was so much better.
ynO69lLRaa	with the players unions involved as they are, good luck getting the players to accept less money|`|hLcFhhNxaa	The reason for over pricing can be because of many factors, NBA in itself is a very influential expanding sport and i personally feel its games are overpriced due to smaller audiences (compared to Cricket or Baseball Or even NFL), the NHL & NBA need more money and with a smaller crowd comes bigger prices to do so.|`|wPD3BGEHaa	OMG!

They've also recently signed Low Ki and I believe they have big plans for him. They were also pushing Kendrick and he is extremely small.

a6EndAPiaa	It usually comes down to money.  The owner is not spending the money for top players; therefore, the team can not attract the best coaches and free agents.  In general that happens to small market teams and or teams with smaller and or older stadiums who do not generate enough money through ticket sales.|`|616b18f35255971ece90dca0da3b2da8aa	Different ownership have different resources and goals when it comes to fielding a team. Also the teams that you consider good like the Patriots were once bad so things can and do change.|`|325dc58fe0dad7a757aae14664382449aa	With parity and the amount of talent in the NFL today, the only answer is leadership.  In today's NFL, the most important man on the team is the head coach.  A brilliant head coach, with a good front office to back him up, can create dynasties.  Bad coaching = bad team.|`|0TAld46gaa	Well Bengals have had a few superbowl appearances back in the 80's    The one team you never mentioned  are the Detroit Lions.    And the original Browns team was sold and became The baltimore ravens so maybe cleveland is where talent dies|`|f7qVtYfaaa	i think a lot has to do with poor management at the top of the organisation that filters down to on field decisions. saints have some very very good players as do the bengals but they have no yet built complete teams and that could be due to not understanding how to use their mney to get the positions filled that are hurting their chances each year|`|jwm0kQvNaa	It's an organization problem.    Some owners prefer not to spend their entire salary cap on players, even though that one last piece to the puzzle is out there.  They get bargain-barrel players that perform like a used pair of boxers.    Some GM's are in over their heads, and really can't find talent.  When you're stuck with a first round bust that just eats your cap space (sometimes, even when he's not on the team anymore) it kills your chances of bringing in new talent.    Some coaches are too stubborn to adapt their styles to fit what they have.  It's hard to have a power-running attack with scatback RB's.    Some players only play for the checks.  They work to get that big contract, then take a few years off.  Then when contract time comes, they play like the stars they should've been playing like all along.    The Lions are terrible, from the top down.  A bumbling owner that doesn't care as long as his profits are up.  He hires a bumble for GM, and they go through HC's like they were changing their socks, but they are all very good coaches who were on Super Bowl winning teams.  They can't draft talent, don't pay attention to needs, and look elsewhere to point the blame.  The Cardinals were on this very same tangent until the son took over as Head Honcho.    People are going to cry, but look at the Redskins.  They tried buying talent, and it didn't work.  They had a HOF coach, but the game had passed him by.  They finally got a coach that was willing to work with Jason Campbell, and he's on the verge of breaking out.  They look, at least on the outside, like a team that's finally willing to grow talent and act as a cohesive unit.     Now a team like the Patriots.  They probably have more late-round draft picks and "retreads" playing for them than any other team.  They were even able to stick Troy Brown (a WR) in as a CB and succeed.  Their organization gets it, from the owner to the water boy.  If every team stove to be like them, there would be a REAL parity issue in the NFL.|`|taEGA9PNaa	some of them little crybabies on here might not like you saying their team sucks. sometime they report you and say your cussing and what not just cause their team suck. usually they're owners and gms suck and if they suck at the top they suck all the way down.|`|KnY8HXtPaa	The New Orleans Saints made it to the NFC championship game in the 2006-07 season. But I think they have a really unbalanced team because thay can't run the ball. Brees turns the ball over too much. Reggie Bush has not lived up to expectations.    The Bengals have had numerous problems with their players being involved in criminal activity so I would expect that the team has no discipline and they are a team of individuals.     The Browns just don't have a lot of talent. They have had a lot of bad first round picks in the past.|`|rB4KzAN9aa	Didn't mention the Chiefs either. It's usually the front office or owners that have to do with the sadness of the team.    -phillybirdsphorever|`|6826faa24e7136054b7f73bfa7839087aa	The main problem with bad franchises is usually inept ownership.  Of those three franchises you named, all three have major ownership problems. Browns owner Randy Lerner, who inherited the team from his late father, MBMA bank bigwig, Al, is more interested in his English Premiereship soccer team than the Browns, and has made poor choices in management hirings. Bengal owner Mike Brown is extremely cheap. He does not have ability that his genius father Paul Brown had. He does not pay for scouts. He does not get rid inept coaches early. He won't pay for big money free-agents. He also picks talented but troubled players, believing that they will play for less money. As for the Saints, owner Tom Benson is erratic and cheap. He also does not provide very good working conditions for the players, and they often want to leave when they get the chance.|`|GYJqa3ubaa	the best for brett favre fans  http://astore.amazon.com/brett.favre.new...|`|FtkoBEVpaa	Due to the collective bargaining agreement and revenue sharing ownership doesn't necessarily have to field a good team to make money.  Take the Cardinals for example, Bill Bidwell was one of the cheapest owners in the league, yet his team still made money.  It wasn't until he stepped down as president of the organization and handed over the club to his son that they really became contenders.  You don't have to have a good product to make money on your bottom line in the NFL.

UoT86gbiaa	Why don't you ask ESPN this?
YNJTjImtaa	How come Kobe lovers say he has a better game in MSG than Lebron? 61-0-3 against Bron's 52-10-11? That's a no brainer! Every basketball expert would agree that Lebron definitely had a better game. I could concede that Kobe has a better scoring game but, Lebron top Kobe w/ a better all around game! Kobe was just concerned on scoring the whole night on that game. While Lebron's play was still multi-dimensional. If you would factor in the assists Lebron made and multiply that 2 pts then, it sum up to 72 pts againts Kobe's 67! Do you all understand now? I suppose those people who still believe Kobe has a better game are ignorant of true team game of basketball. I would take Lebron's game anytime!    Heck, even Jordan can score 61 pts any given night but, he won't have 0 rebounds and lesser assists in a game unlike Kobe. So, stop hattin you Kobe lovers! Don't be blinded anymore! Time to realize that we are now living in James World of Basketball! Lebron 4 MVP '09!|`|KdhNCnEjaa	Wow, the first guy is an idiot. LeBron was clearly better.|`|aUGM3ju6aa	Lebron's. We see a 60 Point game almost every year but when was the last time ANYONE seen a 50 Point Triple Double? It was over 30 years ago....|`|fgqghe4yaa	Lebron at least he contributes as a team player and does hog the ball like Kobe.|`|1Z0Lmrk1aa	Kobe, he did  it in less minutes, look it up.|`|jAqVoGlmaa	not even a question... dont even compare the performances.. lebron hands down.... koME played for himself..|`|0TAld46gaa	Lebron had a better overall offensive game    But Kobe is still a better defensive player|`|lT9OrmDNaa	LeBron...Look at the number and see how Kobe did nothing but put up points.  Triple Double? Yeah, I think that's more important.|`|bU2rGQHSaa	Lebron's night was more impressive...and thats not to take anything away from Kobe's 61 because they were both incredible performances, however Lebron accomplished a feat that hadn't been seen since 1975!!!  50-10-11 - that's ridiculous!|`|SFKw0FhWaa	Completely unbiased answer:    Kobe had 61 pts, 0 rebs, and 3 assists    Lebron had 52 pts, 20 rebs, 11 assts and had a better shooting percentage.    For me, there are two things that say it was a TIE:    1) Lebron practically won the game with his performance by getting everyone involved and still playing huge...Kobe was all about shoot-first      2) Kobe had a better shooting percentage, won over the crowd AND was 20-20 from the foul line....100%...thats un-freakin-beleivable, PLUS Kobe was +19 on the floor to LeBron's +7
C0sT0PPyaa	your soooo far off that i just punched myself in the face for you|`|73wpIlgnaa	triceps, higher back muscles, shoulders, (biceps and pecs to a smaller degree) and leg muscles.  yes, I you read that right.  all power is drawn from the ground and shot through the hips and into he punch.      do explosive excercises to gain explosive, penetrating power and to increase speed.  the faster you are, the stronger you are provided you do not pull punches and put your body weight behind the strikes.    You need propper technqiue, and lastly, you need to PRACTICE.  over and over again|`|zamk8GDjaa	Mostly tris and shoulder as far as arm muscles are concerned. Dont bother with biceps they just look cool; dont do much. It is a lot about technique, though. Have a strong back/core and transfer weight by throwing through with your waist/hips. Think of it like a golf swing. Hope this helps|`|yFX0mdOhaa	First of all, if you have good technique, your amr muscles won't affect your punching power as much as your core (torso) muscles and legs.... so technique is the most important thing to add punching power.    The most important ARM muscles in the body to increae punching power would be the foreamrs.  Stengthening your forearms will allow you to punch harder without spraining, or breaking your wrist.     That being said, if you are throwing a hook or uppercut punch, your biceps are more important, if you are throwing a straight punch, your triceps are more important to increase power.|`|N5SVU6Xwaa	punch strength comes from your whole body and technique|`|tZXHSxkQaa	All muscles of the arm,mostly the forearm,for a stronger wrist.I know and do exercises for the forearms.I can lift an 8lb. sledge hammer/pick with one hand at the end of the handle opposite the hammer part.|`|cu67LPb0aa	Actually working on all parts of the arm will help, biceps, triceps and shoulders as well.|`|30FwE9qGaa	The answers above are correct, I will add one more... find your center.|`|6nGII584aa	mainly triceps but try doinging a couple hundred punches till you really feel which muscles it is.|`|uToFh7Beaa	None.

What a retarded mind Wenger has!|`|5c0ea2e937929dc820b4f96293aa83a2aa	Nope he is fully attacking. like the rest of Arsenals midfielders,,|`|XU1KaWXwaa	good luk arsenal|`|LReOvHEdaa	We will get Yaya in summer ..for that position :)  Great reply Marky..I agree with u totally|`|cOPCNP7Laa	No, tbh he is not. he is an attacking player.|`|TKDi70uTaa	time will tell, i dont think he is as good as some think and it will take time for him to adjust also he is not match fit. i think they will see the best of him next season.|`|H7AcXAyaaa	No he is an attacking player. Arsenal have Diaby or Song as DMF.|`|Hiasgb75aa	No. They'll just have to stick with Song. They spent all their time focusing on signing an attacking player when its the midfield that needed strengthening.|`|zu0W6hCTaa	he needs to be on the attack|`|WdOAxQmoaa	Arsenal's is useing the two CM'S as box to box.     so get that "cheap shot" at Arsenal out of your head.      so hows lional messi FC doing? ...oh i mean barcelona FC .|`|IOKilPsFaa	nope..  ever since they 'stupidly' sold flamini and gilberto silva last summer they dont have any good DMF  thats why arsenal is 5th in the league..|`|4BppP7Mkaa	Do your research.|`|htQX8Ywgaa	Yeah, and Robinho and Shaun Wright-Phillips are centre backs.|`|O9NHDTj3aa	arshavin will be a big flop at arsenal a big waste of money what did he ever do????he had a good euro championship thats it,hes 28 also,i dont think he was wengers sighning either|`|n18Q7t11aa	Arseshaving is a ladies clothes designer in his spare time.....that is his position !|`|mJ0g7bDEaa	he's 27! not 28 :) :) no he wouldn't be good for that position!! he won't be cut out for the premiership at all!!|`|a85328c1885e0dae2a1db923b89cac28aa	Lol, most of you are truly clueless aren't you  Look at the last game Arsenal played, the midfield was  Diaby - CM  Eboue - Really a RB not a RM  Denilson - CM or DM  Nasri - LM    On the bench we have Song, a CB/DM, Ramsey - another CM    Arsene is trying to replace Cesc for now, and add cover for our other players, it's fair to say at the moment we are missing a creative attacking midfielder, hence Arshavin was bought.    What I do find even funnier is all these people saying he's going to be a flop and he's expensive, especially the Spurs players who shelved out 15m for an england international who has been absolute dire and only scored one league goal in 21 matches. We bought Samir Nasri for less, he was less experienced and already he's returned 5 goals in 17 games  Arsene Wenger isn't an idiot, he'll pay good money for good players, he won't waste it on players like Bentley or Bent or Modric, all coming in at over 15m each !
54XYA1XZaa	Don't listen to anyone that says your too skinny, or too scrawny.   Being a good football player is not about size, it is about the knowledge of the game and the ability to carry it out on the playing field.    You don't need to have blazing speed to play saftey.  Quickness and agility help though.  I suggest doing some agilty drills with an agility ladder.  Incorrperate them in your daily workouts.   For some good ideas on Ladder drills try youtube.  Search "Agility Ladder Drills"    Your only 14, so don't worry that you don't have huge arms,a nd legs and a big barreling chest.  At six foot sounds like you have a nice frame to add some muscle.  Talk to some coaches about a good lifting program.      Remember when lifting it isn't about weight.  It is about form, and strength training.  I have seen lots of guy slap big weights on the barbells, swing em around with terrible form, and then go out to the field and suck as a football player.  It is those that understand the game, its situations, and have the ability and desire to execute the game plan.    E-mail me if your looking for a weight training workout, as well as agility and plyometric workouts.     Good luck    coachewell@yahoo.com|`|utJYCCvaaa	wow... um if i were you try out for kicker or punter... but as Saftey you have to know football and get up to around 160-175 lbs and get a good vertical and be quick and fast... DBs in General need good ankles and a good backpedal|`|zrhJHsUxaa	To be the good safety you have to have good SPEED because you dont want those super fast wide outs getting behind you in coverage so work on your sprints and footwork.    You have to be able to recognize offensive plays and know what could be coming so study and make sure you know football like you know your ABC's    You need to be able to come up and take out not hit but take out running backs when the ball is handed off. Cant be scared out there it will only get you hurt so learn how to hit and how to take one too.     Get on a good meal plan to put some weight on and stay in the weight room. A good weight depending on your age is about 180-205. Being 131 you will have some work cut out for you but you can get up to that weight in no time if you dedicate yourself to it.     Last but not least work on your vertical and learn to snag balls out the air at the highest point you can. That will increase your interception rates.    Other than those things make sure you have fun because when you do the game comes to you a lot easier!|`|NLj70oJIaa	Weight Room at least 4 to 5 times a week(at least). Agility Drills EVERYDAY!|`|qGuyZ3qhaa	hit the gym, and gain weight

DSJOxz0Qaa	I agree with you on this one Dawgmeat.  Tebow happens to play in the most media friendly period in all of college sports.  For some reason this makes people's memory very short relative to the history of the best players in the game.  Hell, you put a  23 on him and put him on the court you would get someone say he was better than Jordan.  He is a great college QB, no one would take that from him but to hear a his name in the "best ever" conversation would be premature and forgets a great many players.|`|qJaM0AY8aa	ok so you dont like tebow, but he is is an incredible talent dude.    he had 2 TD's as the backup qb.    2007-3286 yards 32 passing td's. 895 rushing yards 23 rushing TD's.  thats 55 total touchdowns.  firts player in NCAA history with 2o pass and 20 rush tds.    he won the heisman.  he won 2 championships (one on his own) he outscored possibly the best offense in ncaa history.    he has scored 110 total TD's in his 3 year college career, 97 in just the last 2 years.    now tell me that is not incredible? maybe not 1 but top 5 easy man, give him some credit, he still has this next year to possibly win 1 more championship and heisman|`|yUouA5G6aa	Tebow couldn't carry any of the players you mentioned jocks.  No way does he belong on that list, no way.  The worst player you mentioned was twice as good as Tebow.  Yahoo Answers is filled with people whose knowledge of sports goes all the way back to 2006.|`|581a2ff0849619601514b500948d91fcaa	Ever? Hardly.|`|Qwx082wIaa	its allll about Tim Tebow!      ALL DAY EVERYDAY!! :)      HE IS THE ****|`|AA11848191	You listed some amazing college players, and you could make the arguement that all of them are better college players than Tebow.  But you aren't giving Tebow enough credit.  He has won two national titles(and yes, the first one counts even though he split time with Leak).  He was the first sophmore heisman winner, and has another trip to New York.  The year he won the heisman was the best ever year by a duel threat QB.  Is he better then all of the players you listed?  No.  But he is better then a lot of them.  Do you really think Ron Dayne was a better college player than Tim Tebow?  If Tebow wins another heisman and/or National Title, will you think he is one of the greatest college players of all time?|`|5P10Aew6aa	LOL|`|d13be469790f4c6de2d7eb7872dee476aa	Tebow isn't just the greatest college football player ever, he is without a doubt the greatest person who has ever lived.|`|bGAv6Gjpaa	In my Book he wasn't even better then Kenny Stabler! Stabler had less players and did more then Tim Tebow will ever do! and Kenny did not stand in the shotgun ! he was a man and took the hits! both are left hand QB I would take Kenny over Tim anyday of the week!|`|F934e4HQaa	TEBOW,TEBOW.TEBOW,TEBOW!! GO GATORS!!!!!!!   TEBOW HAS 2 TIME NATIONAL CHAMPION, HEISMEN TROPHY WINNER, MAXWELL AWARD AND MORE.|`|wSq80V1xaa	I think people are basing their statements off of the fact that Tim Tebow turned Florida's football program around.  Not to mention that he has won two national titles, and he can make it three this year.  I personally don't agree that he is the best ever, but he is possibly Florida's best ever.|`|LVjM9k8yaa	Most football fans have short term memories and are also blinded by homerism.

Tebows career to date has been better than almost half of those players you have named!!! you better go look at some numbers!!! and I dont agree that he is the best player ever in college...thats just not true, but you dont go overboard with naming off sooo many players that were more dominating than him, because there just arent that many....you sound like a bitter fan of an SEC rival...I definitely think he belongs in the top 25....maybe around   15-17....but dont hate too much on him yet, he still has another year....I would love to hear what you have to say after next season, because your argument is weak, and hardly factual....Tebow-the greatest college football player ever? by no means. One of the top 25 greatest college football players ever? you can bet your last home game ticket he is!|`|m9Hmb93Uaa	no|`|2F7F1PYOaa	Tebow isnt even the best player to come out of Florida.

Kobe is still the great player he used to be, but now he has learned how to win without Shaq. He gets a lot more assists now and is a great team player.

5ab33372111416cc249745429c022cb8aa	Start Rod Smith.  Jay Cutler will likely wake Denver's bad offense up.  Also, Seattle's secondary is not that strong, so Smith might have a good game.  Even if Colston plays, an ankle injury would keep him from being very effective.|`|AA10130483	I would start Smith...|`|7528d4e0ec1dbba58f659eee6d9d4096aa	Interesting how close your league is to mine. I also am 7-5 right now with the 9th place person at 5-7.  I too have Colston and have had this same problem.  If you can, I would try to pick up Devry Henderson if he is a free agent in your league.  He started in Colstons place on sunday and had over 150 yards and one touchdown.  However, I would check out Colston's status right before his game because he may work out before the game again and make his decision then like he did last week.|`|d69dd3dbf79b543c9cb4b232ed679910aa	Take smith as cutler needs a veteran dependable option to throw to colston is behind Henderson and Horn and may be downgraded and Copper might start|`|8c80348a061c83e5f7190e0bf6bce18aaa	play him he will get around 88 yards|`|30ade4aae1cceb8dbbd142e22cbc2487aa	Start Rod

Man braucht aber auch eine gute Technik um ihn gleich 200 M  zu schlagen.Man sollte aber auch auf einer gewissen H?he den  Ball schlagen damit er auch weit fliegt.    Aber Achtung:So ein Ball der 200 M weit fliegt k?nnte 180-240 km/h  schnell sein.|`|3fc0d4a20dfe912cb128cc7d9cdc7128aa	Bestimmt mit dem richtigen Schwung und den richtigen Schl?ger klappt das bestimmt!!!!|`|81c9c6cb164b8eec34fbf68c50a0d2baaa	Wenn Du die reine Flugphase bis zum ersten Auftreffen auf den Boden meinst, dann schaffen die 200m-Marke wohl nur sehr gebte Spieler regelm??ig.    Wenn Du aber die Stelle meinst, wo der Ball nach dem Schlag liegenbleibt, dann ist das fr die meisten Golfer mit ein wenig bung heute kein gro?es Problem mehr.    Mein eigener Rekord liegt bei gnstigem Wind, trockenem Fairway, warmer Luft und leicht abfallendem Gel?nde - also kurz bei fr weite Schl?ge optimalen Verh?ltnissen - bei etwa 260 m mit einem Holz 1 (Driver). Normal schlage ich etwa 210 - 220 m weit.

LGVrhTFTaa	Yes!  You need someone like CP3 (who should be back soon) to vault your team up to at least the final playoff spot (if you are in a H2H league)..  Maggete will help off set Durants' loss..And you can dump,and spot start players for Smiths' slot (if you're in a daily league)..    ~g0()d LuCk!~|`|0TAld46gaa	Well check out your team first.  Look at what areas you feel you can make a move up.    If you think it will be help than do it|`|V0R9sxNZaa	If you're getting CP3, then definitely take it. Paul's injury is not that serious...he'll probably be back by next week. He's one of the top 3 fantasy players in the league. You're team would be better with him.|`|AA10502115	Again, WOW, these answers have been terrible. The side with Kidd, Durant and Z is clearly wining as these three players are MUCH better than the other three. Yes, I understand that CP3 is a beast and is the best fantasy player in the league. But this IS A THREE FOR THREE trade and you gotta look at all of the players. Jason Kidd has been PURELY AMAZING this season, actually ranked the 6th or 7th best player while Durant has also been incredible, being the 10th-15th best player; also incredible at both points, three's and even in rebounds. These two are actually better than Maggette and CP3, because they get more STEALS!!, more points, more rebounds, and more three's. You are losing some assists, but that's nothing. Hopefully everybody sees that big Z is better than J.R. Smith. That's no debate.|`|ab11c77db248f05b2e7090761918cc61aa	You're giving up Paul?  No no no...Do not give up Paul.  He's the best player in fantasy bball and you're not even getting a first rounder for him.  He was the number one pick in most drafts and if you're not getting someone like Kobe or Lebron in return, I would not trade Paul.  Smith and Maggette go ahead and trade but NOT Paul.  You will really regret it.

mt222O85aa	5 months is plenty of time to get ready to make your schools team.    How competitive is your schools team? Do they tumble? If so, you might want to check out a cheerleading gym or gymnastics center for some basic tumbling lessons. It would be in your best interest to have a solid round-off and a back handspring.     You should definitely start stretching now. Stretch while you watch tv, read, etc.  Stretching will also help with your jumps. youtube search for how to do cheer jump videos. believe me, theres plenty of them. Learn how to do a toe-touch, left and right herkies, pikes, and hurdlers. Those are the most common jumps.    What position do you think you would be considered for? Are you smaller? You would probably be a flyer. Are you very tall? You would most likely be a backspot. Are you medium height, or very muscular? You would probably be a base. Look for how-to videos on youtube for stunting. It would be best to try and learn the basics, or at least have an idea of what to do at tryouts.    Practice doing sharp arm motions. Smile constantly. Show lots of spirit at tryouts, and wear a bow in your hair. You'll get noticed for spirit.|`|1e214dda0bb6a3cf454196f01665db75aa	you definitely should start working on things now. You need to stretch your legs and back every day, because flexibility is very important in cheering. Look up videos of cheerleading on youtube, just so you can grasp what its all about. Practice your jumps, and if possible, try to get into a gymnastics class to get some tumbling. You can definitely do it, if you work hard, and you really want to make the team! Good luck with everything!|`|MERgQTRUaa	there are usually gyms that specialize in tumbling, flexibility and cheerleading. You could definietly google it to find a gym close to you. I would stretch everyday to help inprove flexibility. You can always practice your jumps inside your house. The more you practice, try not to land bent over.|`|kS1xOgxbaa	you need to practice your leave raking|`|fMWeRrJTaa	if you try hard enough you can defiantly do it! okay. well first stretch everyday! every single day! while your sitting in front of the t.v or doing homework just stretch. do straddles, lunges, half straddles, butterflies, and pikes. then do the splits with your lead foot on some pillows. hold for 30 seconds. then do the other leg. then stretch a little more. then remove a plliow and repeat. Also if you can get into some tumbling classes that would be great! also work on your jumps, heel stretches, facials, tumbling, and motions. You will need you heel stretch(es) a toe touch, pike, and herkie. You will also need to know the cheer they will most likely teach you, you need to have your splits and you need to do facials and act like you want to be there! well....good luck!! i hope you make it!!!|`|xLPB0Z2maa	Cartwheels*  Handstand*  Toetouch*  Smiley/giggly*  Very right on*|`|lTQkjwRsaa	They want you to be flexible so you can do flips and stuff but not always. Sometimes they can use you for little jumps and stuff like that. Also you can ask some old cheerleaders about what they do and how they get ready for practices. I think you could with determination and mental power. Not giving up and saying you can do it even if it is hard.
Oes7TRNVaa	3 MVPS TO JUST 1....Favre is the better football player.    Did i mention he's never missed a game since 92'??    That Brett Favre is a tough SOB. We really can't compare stats because Favre started 11 years before but i can tell u now that we have seen the best of Brady already. Im not hating but i think after this injury it will be like Montana and not be the same anymore.    Im a fan of both guys but i think this spygate thing is a little much. If Brady knew the plays ran by the defense then that makes it so much easy.    So what if Favre through INT's. U have to take chances and that got him 3 mvps and 2 SB apperances|`|a0751e51e77a757d57715f6706a37923aa	I'm a Jets fan, and I really enjoy watching Brett Favre, but to me there's no question Brady has been a better QB. Brady's career numbers are actually closer to Joe Montana's than Favre's:    Favre: 85.4 rating, 61.6% completion, 7 yards per completion, 1 SB win  Brady: 92.9 rating, 63% completion, 7.2 yards per completion, 3 SB wins  Montana: 92.3 rating, 62.3% completion, 7.5yards per completion, 4 SB wins    Obviously Favre's numbers are great, and there's no question he belongs in the Hall of Fame. I also would argue that he is the more entertaining player to watch of the two.     Statistically though, Brady I think is a notch above him, at least for the first half of his career. If he comes back playing at the level he has so far, or close to it, he will have earned a spot among the greatest to ever play the game when all is said and done.|`|E3wAsSjUaa	Brady.  I'm not gonna go look up official stats, but one of the biggest reason why I'd take Brady over Favre is because of the INTs. Favre tends to throw INTs at the worst possible times. Favre has the records, but Brady wins the critical games. Or at least most of the time.|`|KnY8HXtPaa	as much as i hate to say it. Brady - he doesnt turn the ball over and has 3x as many super bowl victories|`|1HOQyvsIaa	hahaha....Brady.....is this a serious question? I cant stand Tom Brady, but he is far superior to Favre.....Favre throws 2 picks a game....and has only won 1(one) Stupor Bowl.

Brett Favre has won once in his whole career. Tom Brady managed to throw 50 TDs in one season and managed 26 out of 28 passes against Jacksonville in the divisional round two years ago. Brett Favre may be the record holder of career TD passes, but he also holds the record for career INTs. The answer is obviously Tom Brady.    To BurressTD, once again, your answer proves nothing.|`|S81fac8haa	Since everyone is going by rings i guess Trent Dilfer is better than  Dan Marino right. lol .

Favre commits too many turnovers and longevity is why he has all these records|`|lAMdAKmzaa	Tom Brady.|`|X7O0Uxqxaa	Brett Favre never missed a single game in his career. Tom Brady just missed an entire season.    Enough said.|`|PVe6jK78aa	Well if your talking about throwing interceptions and cracking under pressure and tanking in december then Brett's your guy. Even with a good team Brett couldn't take the Pack or the Jets to the super bowl or in the jets case the playoffs at all. The only year Tom Brady missed the playoffs as a started is the 2002 season. I know Brett fans would say that he had a shitty team but so did Brady in 2001. So i would say Brady because he's clutch.|`|zamk8GDjaa	IS? Brady...no stats needed. Brett will be done after this year and Brady will again be one of the best QB's in the league within 18 months.|`|wSq80V1xaa	Tom Brady.

OCf7y5FKaa	Left leg splits.. Put yewr left leg out infront of yew bent at 90 degrees with yewr right straight behind yew.. from this position yew can: 1).try pulling yewr right leg to yewr head (be careful.. i do this because im flexible nd do gymnastics) or 2). bring yewr head down to the floor by yewr front leg nd hold it for a while.  If yew want to learn right -leg splits do this method but with yewr right leg infront. When yew are in actual splits yew can try touching yewr nose to yewr knee nd remember to point yewr toes, keep both yewr knees facing straight up (front leg) nd straight down to the floor (back leg) Easy! Well, have fun.. Splits are uber but dont push yewrself too hard nd if yew want to learn good splits while stretching up practise them everyday.    Sorry i forgot to mention box splits ( I despise them..)  Erm yew basically lean on each leg nd stretch the other beside it owt.. flexing yewr toes then pointing them.. flex, point, flex, point, flex, point, flex, point.. etc!    Btw box splits are HARD.. it only took me a few months to get left-leg splits perfected.. Good Luck!Hope this helps anywhey !!|`|5L5GQYFXaa	stretch A LOT  do pikes,  put yourself on your knees and slowly slide your leg towards you put your head on your knees it help the stretch breath deeply take a breath and lower your leg as you exhale do it for up to 20 minutes and switch leg  practice your splits at least one hour a day that's what i did all summer and i finally got it :D|`|fMWeRrJTaa	just stretch everyday and you will get it. Do straddles, half straddles, lunges, pikes, and butterflies. then do oversplits. hold that for about 30 seconds, then do your other leg. then do them on the ground and do it all over again!! it really works!!! good luck!!!!|`|DGDhQBwpaa	just stretch.

YNJTjImtaa	How come Kobe lovers say he has a better game in MSG than Lebron? 61-0-3 against Bron's 52-10-11? That's a no brainer! Every basketball expert would agree that Lebron definitely had a better game. I could concede that Kobe has a better scoring game but, Lebron top Kobe w/ a better all around game! Kobe was just concerned on scoring the whole night on that game. While Lebron's play was still multi-dimensional. If you would factor in the assists Lebron made and multiply that 2 pts then, it sum up to 72 pts againts Kobe's 67! Do you all understand now? I suppose those people who still believe Kobe has a better game are ignorant of true team game of basketball. I would take Lebron's game anytime!    Heck, even Jordan can score 61 pts any given night but, he won't have 0 rebounds and lesser assists in a game unlike Kobe. So, stop hattin you Kobe lovers! Don't be blinded anymore! Time to realize that we are now living in James World of Basketball! Lebron 4 MVP '09!|`|H7AcXAyaaa	Yes, it backed him up as the best player in NBA.|`|2ieiGIhTaa	That ONE performance didn't prove it, but it sure added to the case for that!    Lebron is a machine.

On the factor of points, Kobe scored 61 the other night.  On the factor of overall, Chris Paul has 5 triple-doubles this year.|`|bYv4EtbUaa	Possibly, but you need to look at his career overall so far, it is exceptional. Last night's preformance was spectacular, and the fact is that no one has had a 50 pont triple double since 1975, and lebron joins jordan as the only 2 players to have more than one 50 point game in the garden.  To all those kobe lovers, sure, kobe will go down as one of the most prolific scorers in NBA history, but LeBron will go down as one of the best players period.|`|67EaIAvbaa	kobe is the best player that ever played the game.|`|k9RXrzluaa	Lebron is the second coming of Michael Jordan!|`|BIoZnAgoaa	One game does not prove who the better player is. Kobe is a better shooter and more clutch but overall i do think LeBron is the best.

I believe in Allah, whatever happened there must be something behind that.. that's where people learn from the mistake...    before this i never thought i will admire Zidane for his skill in football. but when i saw him playing i believe he is such a great footballer in this world. he play better and better. and i believe he loves football and that's why he can play a very great football.    he deserve the golden ball! he's who he's. no one can be him. he is Zidane, a very great football player who can play football like he love it. and he's human being who sometimes made mistake...|`|a6c188708190e70e1c5197181fc5453aaa	NO. the only game that he extremely did the best was  the brazil:france match. after that he was just like a NORMAL player.

If someone one did that in a basket ball, baseball, football, or any other sport they would most likely be fined here in the US for the most part I think.  However, he was given this award that's just not right I think they should have more criteria set for giving an award to a player.  Would you be MVP if you did that? That's how I see it.|`|AA11853447	Zidane totally deserved it. He is an amazing player. The thing that people aren't taking into account is that he's a human being-- he acted out to something that Materazzi did that was totally uncalled for, which was calling him or his team something really nasty. He's human and you have to respect that.     Much respect to the man; much respect.|`|5c46a461daa6c3961de23af5526f46ccaa	He deserves it as much as Italy the cup after a huge scandal in Italy.|`|40bedffc9c1a1cd3be77b030186cb490aa	absolutely not he was so out of line..the french deserved to lose|`|0b1f9e40937dd366e95e71954c9bf04baa	Zidan did a good job on that peski frikin Italian.He sent the greatest message to all those ****** Racists in Italy an Spain.Good to see a Roman on his ***.

AA11597332	(okay, you had to ask, here goes!)     Infield Fly Rule  The infield fly rule always seems to be a point of confusion for players, coaches, and parents watching a game. The purpose of the infield fly rule is to prevent a defensive team from purposely dropping or not catching an infield fly with the intention of trying to turn a double play.    Why we need the infield fly rule  If there was no infield fly rule, the following could happen: Runners are on first and second with less than 2 outs. Pop fly is hit to the third baseman. He intentionally drops the fly ball, picks it up, touches third and then throws to second for a double play. It's an easy double play because both runners are tagging up on their bases expecting the ball to be caught.    When can the infield fly rule be called?    Less than 2 outs. It's purpose is to prevent a double play.   Runner on first and second, or bases loaded. (There must to be a force at third base)  So where's the confusion?  As usual, the confusion is in the details and the combination of things that can happen. One point of confusion is that many people mistakenly think that the infield fly rule applies when there is only a runner on first base. This isn't the case. When there is no force play at home or third, the only way to turn a double play, by intentionally dropping the ball, is if the batter doesn't run to first base. In this case the infield fly rule doesn't apply and the defensive team could turn a double play. I don't think anyone will feel bad for the batter in this scenario.    So now that we know the game situation that the infield fly rule can be called, let's move on to the call itself. The main thing to remember is that the infield fly rule is a judgment call by the umpire. If the umpire determines that a player can make the catch with ordinary effort, then he/she can apply the rule. After the ball is hit in the air, you should hear the umpire yell, "Infield fly, batter is out." If you don't hear the umpire yell that, then assume the rule doesn't apply. The rule is written to give the umpire the ability to determine whether to apply the rule or not. Here is an example when the rule may not applied by the umpire. Runners on first and second. The third baseman charges toward home on a bunt coverage. The batter swings away and pops the ball up by third base. The umpire determines that the ball cannot be caught with ordinary effort, so he says nothing. The infield fly rule is not applied and the third baseman can pick the ball off the ground (if he missed it) and touch third base for a force out if the runner hasn't made it to third yet. Make sure you and your players don't assume that the infield fly rule is automatically enforced based on the situation. It is still a judgment call by the umpire.    Another point of confusion (and this is confusing) has to do with the ball being fair or foul. For example, you could have the umpire call out "Infield fly, batter is out.", and then not have the batter be out. How can that happen? The infield fly rule only applies to a fair ball. So let's say a pop up is hit down the third base line. The umpire makes his call and then the ball drifts into foul territory. Whether the ball is caught or not, the infield fly rule no longer applies. So, if the ball is dropped by the third baseman in foul territory, it's simply a foul ball and the batter is still up. In this case, umpires are taught to yell, "Infield fly if fair". The umpire may mistakenly make the first call and just because he called the batter out, doesn't mean he is out in this situation. The correct call is simply a foul ball.    A similar situation can happen if the ball hits in fair territory (before the bases) and then rolls foul (before being touched by a defensive player). You might see this on a pop-up to the catcher or pitcher. The ball is missed and the backspin takes the ball foul after it is missed. In this case just like the last, the infield fly rule doesn't apply and it's a foul ball.    To keep the same line of thought going, let's say a popup is hit to first base, the umpire yells "Infield fly, batter is out.". The first baseman misses the ball and it hits in fair territory and rolls into foul territory after going past first base. Since this would normally be a hit, the infield fly rule does apply and the batter is out.    Is that all of the confusion?  Nope, there's more. Where the ball is caught can be another point of confusion. Let's say your second baseman is playing on the dirt and takes a few steps back onto the outfield grass to catch the popup and you hear the umpire call the infield fly rule. You think the player is on the outfield grass, so the call shouldn't be made. Again, the rule is written to give the umpire the ability to make the call based on his judgment. If you think about it, it really makes sense. In this situation can the umpire really determine whether the ball is going to land in the grass or the dirt? What if the grass is really close to the infield on this particular field? Or how would he make the call on an all dirt field? What he can do is judge whether the second baseman is in a position to make an ordinary catch and to visually determine and make a judgment as to the depth of the fielder. He can then determine to call the infield fly rule even if it ends up being caught in the outfield grass.    What if in that same situation the right fielder calls off the second baseman and makes the catch? The answer is that the infield fly rule would still be in effect. The rule is based on the judgment of the umpire while the ball is in the air. If the right fielder calls off the second baseman he is still catching what the umpire had determined to be an infield fly.    What about the other base runners?  The other runners can try to advance at their own risk as they would on any other fly bal|`|AA12319332	the players automatically get called out on an infield fly because if there is a runner on 1st and 2nd they coul purposely drop the ball and fire it to 3rd and fire it to 2nd|`|AA11433419	Infield fly rule:  Only can occur with runners on 1st and 2nd and only one out.  In the aforementioned situation when a batter hits a flyball in the infield he is called out.  this rule exists to protect the offensive team in situations like the following:    Say the bases are loaded.  A batter pops up a fly ball and the infielder drops it.  the infielder can then throw the ball home and then back to 3rd 2nd or 1st base for a double or possibly a triple play.  the infield fly rule keeps teams from dropping an infield fly ball on purpose just so they can turn or double or triple play.  Hope this answer helped.

Build muscles in you groin and hipductors. also get strong calves  Finally do 100, 200, 400, meter sprints.   Really, any training (hard training) will make you faster but by doing this it will make you more efficient. Also stretch to lenghten your stride and make your leg thrust power strong (make you legs move faster called increasing turnover)|`|0b433b01fd11fb3c0947340af2ba83fdaa	I work in the school system and all I can tell u is what I see these boys doing.The boys here use weights on their ankels and some on their thighs and they run.Plus there is this thing that I don't know what it is called.But they hit it with their body and try to push it.Maybe u know what that is. Anyway our school won 12 football games out of 12 and then lost the one to take them to whatever it is that it's called.The point is they know what they are doing to win that many games.So maybe u should try what I told u.You have to build up your leg muscles.Good luck|`|21d4a230bd482f86dfbb2baf730bd62aaa	I got this for my son who plays football, basketball and he improved his speed quickly.

753b34b46fb4d6d9b51cfec4069bdcf7aa	The majority of things that occur at A&M are based on tradition.    The tradition is that A&M was an all male school until the late '60s time frame.  So there weren't any females to be cheerleaders.  The Yell Leaders lead the cheers.  The Yell Leaders are also elected by the student body.  To date, no female has been elected at the main campus, but I believe that A&M at Galveston may have elected a female yell leader.    The tradition continues!|`|f73191db65c7bbf85c16893fa3daf443aa	Tradition...even Gov.

7528d4e0ec1dbba58f659eee6d9d4096aa	the number 1 person gets the player|`|db31437d04de02c61463c1fd0d6601f2aa	Much like my answer to your other question, the waiver designation was initially determined based on who drafted first in your league.  This would give them the 12 ranking while the one who drafted last gets the first waiver opportunity.    To answer your question, when a player is put on waivers (which means he was dropped from his previous team's lineup), anyone can try to add him to their teams.  So lets say all the team managers would try to add him to their teams, this would bring about a "waiver request" that would be pending till the day that the player who was put on waiver's "clears waivers" and becomes a free agent.    The team with the highest waiver priority would get the said player (waiver 1) even if all the team managers put up a request.  When this happens, the player's whose waiver designation was one, becomes 12.  12 becomes 11, and so on.    Hope this helps.

f6a54fe6f7ac11afebbdef637114de3faa	After regaining the title at Survivor Series less than a week ago, SmackDowns new World Heavyweight Champion Batista entered the HSBC Arena in Buffalo a happy man.    King Booker however, was not so happy. As the former champion demanded a rematch, he was interrupted by the Irishman Finlay, who wanted the opportunity to face Batista. WWEs fan friendly General Manager Theodore Long announced a Triple Threat Match  which heavily favors the challengers  for the World Heavyweight Champion. Batista made a huge statement by defeating two of SmackDowns toughest Superstars, pinning Finlay and retaining the World Heavyweight Championship.    While continuing to be at odds after the match, Long made another announcement: King Booker and Finlay would team up against Batista and a partner of his choice at Armageddon. The Animal chose his friend, WWE Champion John Cena.    Theodore Long also announced two other matches for Armageddon, as he has ordered a Last Ride Match between Undertaker and Mr. Kennedy and an Inferno Match between the monster Kane and MVP.     On this night, however, Undertaker would face Montel Vontavious Porter as he sought revenge for losing the First Blood Match at Survivor Series due to MVPs interference. The match was interrupted by Kennedy, who was thrown into the ring. As MVP ran towards the back, The Big Red Machine chased him back into the ring, and once again the Brothers of Destruction stood together to pummel the young Superstars. At Armageddon, the rivalry between MVP and Kane will literally heat up, while The Phenom looks to take Kennedy for one last ride.    Chavo Guerrero came to SmackDown with an injured Vickie by his side, claiming the injury was caused by the Rabid Wolverine at Survivor Series. Chavo went on to taunt Chris Benoit, saying why dont you hit me Chris, someone who hits back, and also you were part of our family, and you go and do this. Vickie added I never thought a family friend like Chris Benoit would do this. Chavo used this mind game to his advantage during a return match, as Benoit stopped himself from slamming into Vickie again. Chavo rolled up the United States Champion and held the tights to defeat Benoit.    WWE Tag Team Champions Paul London & Brian Kendrick took on the reunited MNM, who they had defeated to win the titles.

Hasselbeck is still a little timid coming off of the injury.  You should start Garcia, with R. Brown and D. Stallworth, Garcia has two great targets.      Both running backs should get some good carries.  I think Jones Drew should start though.  Indy cant stop the quick runners.  Remember what M. Bell did against Indy.    Start Caldwell. He is Tom's  1 right now, and has the hot hands.  Walker has Cutler who is still learning, Booker has Harrington who throws to many picks, Brown might be a good choice if you start Garcia, Colston probably wont play and doesnt need to til the playoffs, Wayne has Harrison on the other side so not as many touches.|`|938c884b01a162594f2dea609ff3c42caa	Garcia.  He'll have a big day against Washington.    D. Williams.  He should get more carries than the recovering DeShaun Foster.  Fred Taylor should get more carries than Jones-Drew.    Wayne.

1caeb00c2a9237bc7000403de8a3fed9aa	Edward Umar Fatu (born March 28, 1973) is a Samoan professional wrestler currently performing for World Wrestling Entertainment (WWE) on their RAW brand under the name Umaga.    Eddie Fatu grew up around professional wrestling, eventually being formally trained by his uncle Afa Anoa'i.    He worked the independent circuit as a tag team with his cousin Matt Anoa'i (Kimo), as The Island Boyz using the name Ekmo.    Contents [hide]  1 Career   1.1 Three Minute Warning   1.2 Outside WWE   1.3 Return to WWE   2 In wrestling   3 Family   4 Trivia   5 Championships and accomplishments   6 External links          [edit] Career    [edit] Three Minute Warning  On the July 22, 2002 episode of WWE RAW, The Island Boyz made their debut as Three Minute Warning. Fatu (now known as Jamal) and his cousin (using the name Rosey) were (kayfabe) hired as General Manager Eric Bischoff's assailants, attacking seemingly random wrestlers each week, on his order.    Fatu was released from his WWE contract later that year as a result of his involvement in an altercation outside of a Florida nightclub. He was reportedly angry at a man who was supposedly trying to flirt with his wife who was with him that night.      [edit] Outside WWE     Ekmo in TNA.Fatu worked for Total Nonstop Action Wrestling (TNA) for a short while after his WWE release under his old name, Ekmo, and would later move to All Japan Pro Wrestling (AJPW) as a member of the Roughly Obsess & Destroy (RO&D) faction. Later, with Taiyo Kea, Fatu won the AJPW Unified World Tag Team Championship. He also challenged Satoshi Kojima for the Triple Crown, but Kojima retained his title.    Fatu also wrestled in many independent promotions during this time, including his brother Solofa's Nu-Wrestling Evolution. However, in December 2005, Fatu announced he would be returning to World Wrestling Entertainment and gave his notice to AJPW.      [edit] Return to WWE  In December 2005, it was confirmed that WWE re-signed Fatu. A return of Three Minute Warning was hinted at for many weeks with the team of Matt Anoai and Fatu competing in dark matches together before RAW; however, Rosey was released before the team could be brought back on the main show.    On the April 3, 2006, edition of RAW, Fatu made his redebut using the name Umaga, alongside his manager, the Cuban Armando Alejandro Estrada. When Estrada interrupted a Ric Flair promo he introduced his new client, Umaga, who proceeded to viciously attack Flair.    The name Umaga is a variant on Fatu's middle name, Umar[citation needed], and the gimmick is considered a "throwback" to many Samoan based tag teams like The Wild Samoans, and The Headshrinkers. It is also believed that the name is somehow related to former All Blacks captain Tana Umaga, who is also Samoan. The character has also drawn comparisons to Kamala the Ugandan Giant.    Most of the matches Umaga participated in while establishing himself were squash matches against various jobbers; however, after competing in one of these squash matches, Ric Flair returned to attack him. Their mini-feud culminated with Umaga winning a rematch at Backlash 2006.    At SummerSlam, Estrada offered (the undefeated) Umaga's services to The McMahons (Vince and Shane) to take out their D-Generation X (Shawn Michaels and Triple H) opponents during their match. When he made his way to the ring for his mission, however, he was attacked by Kane. The two of them feuded, alternating the upper hand back and forth, for the next two months until Umaga won a Loser Leaves RAW match, sending Kane off of the brand. Their feud continued, however, at Cyber Sunday where Kane was again defeated by Umaga after fans selected him over Chris Benoit and The Sandman to be Umagas opponent for the night.    Since his return with the Umaga gimmick he has yet to be pinned or made to submit on television, though he has lost matches via disqualification and count-out.      [edit] In wrestling  Finishing and signature moves   Samoan Spike   Wild Samoan Splash / Flying Sausage (Top rope splash)   Reverse piledriver - in Japan   Wild Samoan Drop (Gorilla press into a Samoan drop)   Running hip attack to the head of a seated opponent leaning against the turnbuckle   Reverse STO   Turnbuckle powerbomb, usually preceded by an elevated three-quarter double-arm choke   Diving headbutt   Running headbutt drop to the head of an opponent held in the tree-of-woe position   Giant swing, occasionally into an object such as ring steps or a barricade   Managers   LionDen   Rico   Nidia   Armando Alejandro Estrada   Nicknames   During Fatu's time as Umaga, he has gone by the nicknames "Samoan Wrecking Machine" and "Samoan Smashing Machine", both of which are believed by some to be parodies of "Samoan Submission Machine"; the nickname of Samoa Joe. He has recently been given the more consistent nickname of the "Samoan Bulldozer". In AJPW, he was known as the "Samoan Typhoon", to go along with tag partner Taiyo Kea's nickname of "Hawaiian Tornado".     [edit] Family  Eddie is a member of the famous Anoa'i wrestling family, he is the brother of Solofa Fatu (Rikishi) and Sam Fatu (The Tonga Kid), cousin to Dwayne "The Rock" Johnson, Rodney Anoa'i (Yokozuna), Samula Anoa'i (Headshrinker Samu), Matt Anoa'i (Rosey), Jimmy Snuka, Jr., and nephew to "Soulman" Rocky Johnson, the Wild Samoans (Sika & Afa), and Jimmy "Superfly" Snuka.    He is single and has one niece and two nephews, the children of Solafa "Rikishi" Fatu.      [edit] Trivia  Fatu has Samoan designed tattoos on his arms and legs. He sometimes wears a septum piercing as well as a grill while wrestling as Umaga.    As part of his gimmick he only yells in Samoan |`|70f10a64e55a1abf2a3ffbc47ef0fe0daa	"was he known as rikishi?"

I play collegiate court handball. Rules wise its comparable to raquetball, but the ball you play with is much smaller and bounces much faster than the raquetball. Although I grant raquetball players hit it faster, once the ball bounces it dies, not so for handball. Plus in handball you don't have a huge raquet to hit it with... you have your hands.  I am very annoyed that it isn't even on the list.|`|f371c0dc9701a6e16fcb7e488a7909c8aa	cheerleading, i guess is a sport, i mean you have to remember all of those cheers and stuff|`|fb03370e839bd6ac927376a4c8f976ddaa	Water polo is ranked too low. They said that you need more power to play tennis than water polo. Whoever said this has obviously never played 2-meter or 2 meter guard. It's a no-holds-barred wrestling match, and when the ball comes in, somebody's going under. I've heard stories about two-meters throwing their defenders out of the water. If that takes less power then a tennis serve, you're high. Also, how many people have tried treading out to their waist? If you're a goalie, you're gonna be doing that a lot. That takes more power than sprinting. Also water polo was slammed in speed. HELLO!!! YOU CAN'T RUN A COUNTER ATTACK IF YOUR TEAM IS SLOW!!!!! And who needs nerve to withstand 28 minutes of underwater kicks, punches, grabs, and various other things (I've heard stories of players having thumbs shoved up their butt). How it's not within the top 10, or above baseball, soccer, and tennis is beyond me.|`|AA10204397	i think golf requires a lot of accuracy, but so does cheerleading, table tennis, and badminton.  plus, it also requires a lot of patience.  i think cheerleading is considered a sport because people do exercise when they throw and lift people up in the air.

He has to be at the top of worst starters on this team, but to give another one to shake things up, Alfonson Boone (defensive tackle). He isn't necessarily bad, he just gets lost all the time on the field and from catching most of the games, I've noticed a lot of missed tackles from him. I think Ian Scott on the bench could do a much better job since he started last year and showed many signs of talent.  Don't get me wrong, I like Boone, but I think Scott is a better option for us especially since our defense has struggled the past few games.

Je connais trs bien l'entra?neur. Pour un fan de foot, c'est magnifique. On prend en charge l'quipe de son choix, on s'occupe du recrutement, des finances, de l'entra?nement, des mises en places tactiques des matches, du suivi en cours de partie... C'est extra.

La prochaine aura donc lieu en 2009 en Afrique du Sud. Et la France n'y participera que si elle remporte le Championnat d'Europe des Nations, car sa place de finaliste de la Coupe du Monde ne lui garantit pas l'accs.    Les participants  cette comptition seront :  - L'afrique du Sud comme pays organisateur  - L'Italie championne du monde  - Le vainqueur du Championnat d'Europe des Nations  - Le vainqueur de la Copa America  - La vainqueur de la Gold Cup (Concacaf)  - Le vainqueur de la CAN  - Le vainqueur de la Coupe d'Asie des Nations  - Le vainqueur de la Coupe d'Ocanie|`|3f0c5e748c0f9c56237c62090ad35a84aa	Non, vous devez attendre encore 2 ans, c'est en 2009, la prochaine coupe sera organis par Afrique du Sud.

La escuelas te los venden como negocio, ni el cinturon te da mas honor ni te lo quita. solo tu trabajo vale, y a nadie tienes que demostrarle nada, solo a ti.    Para el Tai chi chuan debes usar ropa holgada, pantalones sueltos y zapatos bajos de suela de hule, pero puedes usar cualquier zapato tenis o sneaker.    puedes usar conjuntos deportivos, no uses cinturon para que el Chi fluya mejor por el tan tien.    si insistes en usar ropa especial, se ha vuelto tradicional usar conjuntos de corte chino, zapato bajo, mejor de suela de algodon engomado o de latex. no uses ropa tipo de la que usaba Bruce lee en sus peliculas porque son incomodos y calurosos al ser hechos de gabardina rigida, pero no es regla, son mejores los conjuntos de seda o algodon ligero    Tengo 18 a?os estudiando artes marciales chinas, incluidos Taichi Chuan de yang, chen y Wu, asi como el simplificado.    Se llama tai chi chuan porque es un boxeo filosofico basado en el flujo de yin y yang ( Tai chi) lo que conoces como el simbolo de yin yang se llama en realidad taichi, solo cuando estan separados se les designa por su nombre particular.    El tai chi chuan es originario de las zonas cercanas al monasterio de Wu Tang..    PD: EL KIMONO Y LA HAKAMA SON JAPONESES, NO CHINOS, UN NOMBRE APROPIADO PARA LA ROPA CHINA PODRIA SER QUIPAO.|`|393b3960cf7114b9c69b82913a1b71c8aa	Debes usar lo mas comodo para ti, pero si tu profesoe es muy exigente usa el traje oficial|`|98901f60c6515e1dad17aa6bbc52680caa	con armadura medival zapatos de charol y una mascara de espaiderman y esta listo para no aprender nada por que ni si quiera sabes que ropa se usa .|`|b075fb0d50b225eca178fe56ce72693eaa	Aparte de lo que dijo el verdadero experto alla arriba, te recomiendo que uses colores claros para armonizar mejor el flujo del chi. El "uniforme" que se suele usar tiene la caracteristica de tener un arreglo en la entre pierna para poder levantar la pierna sin que se jale el pantalon, pero no dices que estilo  de tai chi practicas, pero supongo que es jang, que es le mas ocupado, asi que igual y si necesitas que tu ropa permita la extension de pierna que menciono.    Suerte.|`|6cb64c81ae537310d7ce8b8b5fc9a3aaaa	Ropa super comoda... y pues evita un poco colores demasiado llamativos.. pero basicamente, no hay reglas,... xD|`|99619a7454e41fbe642628bb4eed84d9aa	Con un traje de buzo, con unas botas de plomo bien pesadas.

f29a2727753b55d9ee231b69ab418d64aa	Both are out of shape old men. I'd say Parcells!|`|25d296cf10dbaf97ca7f76d39d6ec016aa	HA! This is a hilarious question...Bill Parcells is a great all around coach..Charlie Weiss is an offensive genius.  Bill Parcells is quite hefty..Charlie Weiss is just plain huge.   I could see Parcells thinking of a gameplan to counter Charlie's offensive prowess.  I give the nod to Parcells based on a couple of factors.  Bill has routinely won big games as a head coach, while Charlie has won 3 Super Bowls as an assistant, but has not done anything in big games at ND.  Charlie may be an offensive guru, but defense wins games and championships and Parcells has always built strong defenses, so I would expect that to continue...|`|c7b3d9a3eda3b808439546676e404b7baa	Weiss has the weight advantage...and Parcells prolly has bad bones...lol...Weiss would snap him like a twig...of Course Parcells could fight dirty and poke him in the eyes...Ric Flair style..|`|63a7d1be96cc8b525d3cf4cf3434b028aa	Charlie.... He would throw his chin at him.|`|5e438ace7e9033760de5baf608b100beaa	Tough one, but here we go.    Parcells- probably the underdog, does not have the weight advantage, but is not adverse to a good fight.  He has a real bad attitude and knows how to deal with men in diapers (T.O.)    Weiss- obvious weight advantage, probably a little more nimble as well.  Will probably win the fight|`|7497f7be7e0fda7dd55a633c697f0d23aa	charlie weis, he's like 300 pounds
