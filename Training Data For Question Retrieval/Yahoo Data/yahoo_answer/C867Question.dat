20081015072443AAMpIhf	Business & Finance;Renting & Real Estate	Question about HIP's and the Energy Efficiency Certificates that are in the HIP's?	Our house went on the market before the compulsory HIP's came into effect, so we were told that we did not need to get a HIP as we were exempt.    We changed estate agests some time later, but there was no gap in our house being on the market (as far as we were aware) so we was still exempt from the HIP.   However, our current estate agent has now informed us that we need to send him ￡75 for an Energy Efficiency Certificate (I think this is what they are called) as they are now compulsory by law.      I am a bit confused, as firstly - I thought that these certificates came with the HIP, and if so then are we not exempt?   Also, I have heard about an 'end of HIP exemption' date, whereby all houses regardless of the time on the market will need a HIP. Does anyone know anything about this?   I have tried researching on the internet but can't find anything specific enough to answer my queries. Do we need a full HIP or just the energy certificate...or neither?   The estate agest is phoning me tonight, but I just wanted some more information before I speak to him. If we don't want to pay the ￡75, we have to pay ￡150 cancellation fee to the estate agent, so either way I have to decide.   Thanks for any advice.
