qzkWahFeaa	I find that odd, considering Midnight Sun isn't even technically created at this point. It would just be a scene from the original movie most likely, as Edward is there seeing things the whole time.|`|7PO2ugfGaa	There hasn't been any production of Midnight Sun. So not there won't be a scene from MS on the Twilight DVD.
ecdShUxhaa	1-7-21-46-85-141. Take the "first differences" between the numbers.<br>  <br>  6, 14, 25, 39, 56. Take the SECOND differences.<br>  <br>  8, 11, 14, 17. Ah. It looks like a sequence where the second difference is two.<br>  <br>  Continue the next number in the second difference list. It would be 17 + 3 = 20. Add that number to the last number in the first difference list. 56 + 20 = 76. And that's what you add to the last number in the original pattern to get the next number in it.<br>  <br>  141 + 76 = 217.|`|7OZURudXaa	its kind of hard...sorry i suck at these.

Just call the police.  Same if they hit you in your testicles.  That can be considered physical abuse.

I think it's pretty stupid how women want to be treated as equals in the workplace but once they step outside they want to be princesses. I would never be low enough and hit you in the testicles, that's just wrong. Unless you did something REALLY s****y. I stress on the really. If anyone is threatening your life well I think it's pretty obvious that you should do something, whether the person threatening you is male or female. I've told my guy friends that if I ever do anything a guy would do to make them hit them to just give me a slap. Women are weaker, unless they're bodybuilders, and punching them would be too much. Now I have to clear things up, I DO NOT promote any violence whatsoever,  just self-defense.|`|QkTQVPliaa	umm usually if a woman does that to you, they have a pretty good reason for it, in which case, you should just take it and not hit back.|`|W8mtFq1Aaa	Dude, I hit you, I expect you to hit me back.

1vCoaf08aa	Oh dang, that stinks, I love Sepultura.<br>  <br>  Sepultura started as death metal, but not the satanic type, such as Deicide. Sepultura is groove metal, just like Pantera.|`|82946bac5a72f2b8fbcdafb97f625641aa	Seoultura was pretty Death Metal their first coupel of albums.

Thats what I used to do.|`|GG8x2kmfaa	That sucks. <br>  <br>  I guess it's because of the name "death metal".

And Judas Priest could be considered easy - listening compared to other music|`|Ew7hXGFtaa	Well, I don't think it should be a reason for her to not let you get the shirt. My mom does KIND OF the same thing. My mom doesn't let me get any band shirts with any kind of skulls or dark and scary stuff on it in general cause she says it will scare my sister, even though she doesn't know I've secretly been getting my sister into metal. XD<br>  <br>  Sucks though, I think your just going to have to suck it up until your 18 and then you can buy whatever band tee you want.<br>  <br>  Probably wouldn't work but you could show her real heavy bands like Nile and Death and tell her that's what death metal really is, not Sepultura.|`|0VsX3vGzaa	Sepultura is more of a speed/thrash metal band, not a death metal band but I think they may have started out like Sentenced did..  Death metal is more like Lamb of God, Shadows Fall, or In Flames.|`|5uvTte8Zaa	My mom used to censor my music also. It was just something I had to put up with untill I moved out. <br>  They are no worse than Pantera but alot more mild than the Black Metal from Norway|`|HNmO2ZwXaa	Sepultura rule. Your mother is halting your progress in life and unless you have to get the money off her just go and buy it!!|`|Z5mmaFK0aa	To many individuals even those that claim to be religious they feel that the word Death is just simply Taboo. There are thousands of people that dont even like to hear that word or think about it. Because in reality deep within them they really do know that NO ONE knows what happens when we die. I don't care what the Christians say, what Atheists say, Muslims. BLAH BLAH BLAH there is NO SCIENTIFIC PROOF whatsoever what happens to the human consciousness when biological death occurs. Let me get if off this I could ramble forever, Just to some people Death is a Morbid word or a Taboo subject there for they associate Death Metal as being Morbid or Evil. Not saying that is your moms situation I really couldn't tell you but there is my opinion|`|dc49d60c4d19a92e193ce2f41c92cfedaa	Well only your mother knows why she won't let you buy one but at least you listen to good music

Start double knotting!|`|m6GJMPtJaa	no|`|p03Jc7eHaa	nope|`|f9sL3WgQaa	Nope!

Tying your shoes makes you look oblivious to your surrounding.  I'm not being rude or anything, but just take that as possible guidance.  The hallway is deluged (flooded) with students walking either opposite direction.  Students are at times immature, and suppose one or two bumped into you while you were struggling to tie your own shoes;  What would they do then?  They would yell "WATCH IT!  Yadayadayadyadyada!".  You definitely don't want that to happen.  If your shoes are untied, please walk carefully and at the same time, look around you, and be careful of your shoe laces.  Wait until you get into class or if your out of school.  Just remember to go to an area where it's not so crowded.  You could just sit somewhere and tie your shoe laces, good and tight, and there you have it.  You're free to continue on.|`|hOdd1Ti1aa	totally|`|iUFIlbNgaa	I kinda feel self concious then.|`|oMj8WAHFaa	yes i fell people staring at me, i hate that!|`|eOb841qbaa	i just leave it like that until i get to my next class then i tie them.

But its not the shoe tieing u hate, its the fact that people cant help but stare because u are doing something different from the rest of them like ur a broken down car on the side of the road people cant help to watch.|`|AcwVCTCNaa	Ha ha yeah kind of weird really but your not alone...|`|72c3b924e93e85f5493bc3f07051afb4aa	The only thing that would bother me is if I'd have to tie it in the middle of the hallway during heavy traffic.  If I HAD to tie it, I would move off to the side near the wall to get out of people's way.|`|VqFinpJpaa	i hate that so much. Everyone tries to get past me while im tying my shoe and it is so annoying!!!!!!!!|`|7gmdPXc4aa	I don't *hate* it, but it annoys the hell out of me, why does it always come untied!! lol. I don't like the feeling of being unguarded, like my back to open spaces where someone can sneak up on me... You?|`|pzlxRbIOaa	Yes!

l0gQdKGvaa	Disclaimer: This is just my interpretation of the song and others might not agree in part or completely.<br>  <br>  Note: This is just half the song which was originally Kuldeep Manak's song which has the part where the guy also sings. This song is just what Heer sings to Ranjha and not vice versa so cannot make alot of sense alone.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OchnfoLiI0" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OchnfoLi...</a><br>  <br>  To completely appreciate the nauances I would suggest to read the story of Heer Ranjha (atleast the main events). I interpretted the meaning reading the following source.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://pakistaniat.com/2008/01/01/heer-ranjha-the-story-of-punjabs-first-feminist/" rel="nofollow">http://pakistaniat.com/2008/01/01/heer-r...</a><br>  <br>  <br>  My interpretation:<br>  <br>  ni main hasdi(laugh) hasdi  <br>  <br>  mureh(near) baigi (sat) chaunki ( common meeting place where Ranjha and Heer first met)deh <br>  <br>  sareh puchan(ask) de tu ki chahneh(want) anjana (unknown person)<br>  <br>  (everyone asks Ranjha what he wanted as he had recently run away from home and come to Heer's Village)<br>  <br>  mainu pahdi likhi nu <br>  tak dena pardes <br>  (Heer sings about herself that she is well educated and why does the foriegner stares at her)<br>  <br>  veh main sadkey (Her heart goes for him)<br>  <br>  likheya padeya ki ki janey bada siana<br>  <br>  (Heer asks Ranjha if he is educated as in what work he knows in order to get him the job at Heer's house)<br>  <br>  umar (age) niyani (small) de vich das ki tehto bangeya veh  <br>  ina siana(smart) kyu tu chahde(leave) fireh gharana<br>  <br>  (Why has he run away from home while he is still so young)<br>  <br>  tere jaise tug tah tugde firan jahan nu (NOT SURE about this one, but this might refer to the time when Ranjha is begging door to door looking like a Thug to find out about Heer)<br>  <br>  veh main sadkey <br>  <br>  rangpur vicho sunleh tes tara nai jana? (She doesn't want to go to Rangpur as Heer's parents marry her off, but she languishes there waiting for Ranjha- Not an interpretation of the song but that's what the story is so guessing somehting related)<br>  <br>  <br>  (At this point Heer is in Rangpur married off to some person and Ranjha is looking for Heer fressed as a beggar)<br>  <br>  teria mundra (eyes) cho(from) mainu <br>  pan pulekeh(Bulekha- as in hint of something else) ranjeh de<br>  <br>  ( As Ranjha is dressed like a fakir Heer sees hints of Ranjha in the fakir's eyes)<br>  <br>  tainya jatti khatir <br>  tu ta pudma bana <br>  <br>  (Heer is a jatti, so just for her he crossed the Padma river which flows in Rangpur dist now in Bangladesh which was previously pakistan)<br>  <br>  <br>  palo veer da tu <br>  chalke aya tileh toh main sadkey <br>  leya baag chahankey mul peh tu tukana (The lyrics are not right here.. It shoud be "Baag Chad kay malbe tu tikana" as in Ranjha left the nice life in the gardens figuratively a great life to come to Rangpur and live as a beggar - Malba means mud. Tikana means temporary Home)<br>  <br>  <br>  Rest of the lyrics is just a repeat of the first two paras..<br>  <br>  <br>  Hope this help all you guys who are in search for the true meaning of this beautiful song which is really close to my heart.

Do give it a listen.|`|Jfl2BlUGaa	"At Last" by Etta James. The song implies that she was alone for a long time, just wanting this one man. Then she finally gets him when she sings of no more lonely days. Finally at the end of the song, she says: "You smiled and then the spell was cast. And here we are in Heaven. For you are mine, at last." If this song doesn't make you feel better, check for a pulse. The right guy is out there, you've just got to be patient. Even though it may seem like it, you won't be alone forever.

39OVFs5Raa	When you just don't want to sit around moping.<br>  <br>  1.  Call some friends and have a potluck and game night. I love games: Balderdash, Taboo, Charades, even cards. Don't worry if you don't have the latest games. Write out a bunch of movie, song, and book titles and play charades.  Ask everyone to bring some food to share or get some ice cream and have everyone bring an ice cream topping. Cheap fun! <br>  <br>  2.  Going to a movie is fine if it's not what you do every weekend. There's just not that many great movies to see, you could get some real entertainment! Go online and find out what's going on in your city. Try out a club with live music <br>  <br>  3.  Go downtown and stroll. <br>  <br>  4.  I have to add going out to dinner only because it's one of my favorite things to do. I like to have someone else serve me. To stir things up a bit, try a restaurant you've never tried before. Maybe a hole in the wall whose name you can't pronounce. <br>  <br>  5.  Want to save the money (or calories)? Just go out for some dessert or ice cream. You don't have to spend big bucks for some fun. Get some pie or just a double scoop and linger. <br>  <br>  6.  Guys, don't knock it if you haven't tried it, but a bubble bath is a wonderful way to spend Friday night. Put on some music, pour a glass of wine, submerge into the silky bubbles and let the cares of the week melt away. Soak until the water goes cold. Try not to think of all the things that went wrong or what you need to do tomorrow, just savor the sensations of floating in the warmth and let your mind roam. <br>  <br>  7.  Like to dance? You don't have to go to a smoke-filled bar to kick up your heels (although that's an option, too). Invite a few friends over, move the couch and loveseat out of the way and crank up the stereo. If the neighbors complain, invite them over! <br>  <br>  8.  Make something fun! How about some chocolate chip cookies, a model airplane, or a picnic table? Whatever your hobby, Friday night is a great time to get out the ingredients, tools, or whatever and play until you're too tired to play anymore. Got kids? Teach them your hobby. Take your time and enjoy them while you have them!!!.|`|Z4586t2maa	inviting friends over is always fun. you can watch movies, play video games, go to the movies, things like that. Hope that helps!!!! : )|`|2o5lDFbUaa	Order a pizza, rent a movie off on demand (or watch on you already have), or invite a friend over to hang out!

Y1aAGPURaa	That was sooo funny.   Here's another one that proves the intelligence of women.  <br>  <br>  A woman and a man are involved in a car accident on a snowy, cold Monday morning. Both of their cars are totally demolished but amazingly neither of them is hurt. God works in mysterious ways.<br>  <br>  After they crawl out of their cars, the woman says, “So you‘re a man. That‘s interesting. I‘m a woman. Wow, just look at our cars! There‘s nothing left, but we‘re unhurt. This must be a sign from God that we should meet and be friends and live together in peace for the rest of our days“.<br>  <br>  Flattered, the man replies, “Oh yes, I agree with you completely, this must be a sign from God!“<br>  <br>  The woman continues, “And look at this, here‘s another miracle. My car is completely demolished but this bottle of wine didn‘t break. Surely God wants us to drink this wine and celebrate our good fortune.“ Then she hands the bottle to the man.<br>  <br>  The man nods his head in agreement, opens it and drinks half the bottle and then hands it back to the woman. The woman takes the bottle and immediately puts the cap back on, and hands it back to the man.<br>  <br>  The man asks, “Aren‘t you having any?“<br>  <br>  The woman replies, “No. I think I‘ll just wait for the police.... “|`|vOAKMUIbaa	cool that is right ever argue with a women|`|HT1K06WGaa	i know thats right :D|`|IA4x5oPMaa	lol|`|Q0y9wG3Xaa	very true :D <br>  *star*|`|pw0rruRPaa	haha, if you are really reading no one must disturb you!|`|39OVFs5Raa	WOW!

PeuFnqQwaa	Take voice lessons from a trained instructor. Learning how to sing properly is important. Taking instruction, will make a way bigger difference in a lot shorter time that you would be able to do own your own.|`|UI4dpdgnaa	if u cant sing u cant sing|`|t6ZZMFeSaa	You need to take lessons I used to feel like that, and as you take lessons over time you will learn how to sing out of your diaphragm.

You could get an App called Classic. That's where can read classic books. and if you have been on addicting games, they have Parking Lot. Hope this helps.

AxkYUq56aa	Star Wars would not be able to win, because they're in a galaxy far, far away, thousands of years before the events of the other shows, so based on space and time alone, they would lose.<br>  <br>  That leaves Star Trek, B5, and BSG.  We must assume that the fight would occur upon a specific point of the timeline, so the most likely point of commonality would obviously have to be within the ~25 years that Babylon 5 was an active space station, which would put the fight roughly between 2256 and 2281.<br>  This time frame also excellently happens to coincide with when Kirk is promoted to captain, which is in the mid 2260's.  Therefore, the battle would occur between B5 and the Enterprise.<br>  Now, would BSG have anything to offer up at that specific point in time?  That is incredibly difficult to say, so we'll assume that Galactica is able to join into the battle.<br>  <br>  So the fight is Galactica vs. Babylon 5 vs. the Enterprise.  Babylon 5, although stationary, is not as helpless as one would assume, since the fight is taking place after season 2, at which point it was heavily armed by Earth Gov in anticipation of rising hostilities.  Galactica is similarly limited in terms of mobility.  Both ship/stations rely heavily on their fighter squadrons for motility-based attacks.  The Enterprise has the upper hand in matters of maneuverability.<br>  As far as fire power goes, B5 uses heavy explosives and turrets, plus the added benefit of military-trained figher pilots.  Galactica has a similar situation, only replace the turrets with NUKES.  Yes, nukes.  The Enterprise is primarily an explorer-class vessel, which is why it's hilarious that it's so heavily armed, with photon torpedoes and phasers, both of which can be devestating when used properly.  In terms of firepower, I would have to say Galactica has the best set up, with their array of nuclear weapons.<br>  Now, retreating could also be part of the strategy.  B5 has nowhere to go.  No surrender, no retreat.  Galactica can FTL out whenever it wants.  The Enterprise can warp away.  Galactica wins there, too.<br>  <br>  Therefore, in the defined limitations of the fight, it seems that Galactica would rise victorious above the other two opponents.  Of course, though, in actual execution, there IS a vorlon on Babylon 5 at that time (whether it be Naranek or Ulkesh,) and when he realized what was going down, he'd summon an armada of death, which would obliterate everything in the area.  Ergo, Babylon 5 would be the actual winner.<br>  <br>  Hope that helps.|`|sP5wZ320aa	Star Trek is filled up with crap weapons that will NEVER exist for another few hundred years (photon torpedoes and phasers)...<br>  <br>  Babylon 5 and Galactica is created with weapons that already exist... (interceptors, PPGs, bullet weapons, nukes)<br>  <br>  Star Wars is filled with weapons that can theretically exist...<br>  <br>  But, Star Wars has the Death Star... so they will win...

zovrJ0yXaa	it was ok but not great, to be honest. im as big a fan as anyone of whedon and his amazing shows, so im holding out hope for dollhouse, but oddly this show doesnt seem to display much potential. the premise seems quite restrictive, because so far the entire show is about the dollhouse, so unless they plan to set it there for several seasons, which would suck, it just seems like it could be repetitive. also, dushku does well but i think she plays the wildchild better than the straight role. she'll always be faith in my eyes|`|p4kbPcOjaa	I thought it was interesting and hopefully Fox will give it a chance.  However, Fox put it on a Friday night which is usually a death trap for TV series.  Hopefully being side to side with the Sarah Connor Chronicles will help.  Also, I didn't really feel like last weeks episode was the pilot.  It seemed like a "normal" episode - Fox did this with Whedon's Firefly and I think it really hurt it's chances with viewers.  I wish Joss Whedon had more creative control and can tell Fox to let him do his job and not screw around with the scripts.<br>  <br>  :-)|`|v7Y9cFW8aa	It's definitely having a slow start. The first episode, Ghost, was alright and the second episode, The Target, was a little bit better. There's enough action and intriguing moments in the show to make me want to find out what happens next. Usually Joss Whedon's shows take a little bit of patience before they become great. I really see much potential in this show and I have great faith in Whedon, so this is definitely a show that I will be keeping track of. Since you missed it, you can watch it online for free if you want. Just go to the link below. Check it out and see what you think of it =)|`|a231cd46589d3ea6efabcc68cdd6e69baa	It redefined the word 'sucky'.  I felt dirty after watching it.

It seems too generic and practical of its genre. It reminds me on one of the show Fox had when it was the dead last network. And by putting it on Friday nights, where most of the show's targeted audience will not be home, it's going to die probably 6 episodes in. Terminator might probably die as well two by being on Friday nights now. Maybe Whedon should just save his efforts to revive Firefly.

AA11688473	With very little money Halloween director John Carpenter sent Tommy Lee Wallace to the Mask Shop on Hollywood Blvd. and Mr. Wallace returned with a William Shatner "Captain Kirk" mask.  Wallace cut open the eye sockets so that they would be wider, he tore off the eye brows and the side burns, poofed up the hair so that the mask would look in Wallaces terms "demented".  Wallace eliminated the need for any other masks when he spray painted the Kirk mask white and showed it to Carpenter and co-producer Debra Hill.  It was at that moment that the group knew that they had a awesome mask|`|Shi5z6iJaa	its not supposed to represent anyone the prop was made from a Shatner/Capt. Kirk mask and then painted white|`|TeXaZaW3aa	No i am a die hard halloween fan..an he wheres the mask as u seen in the new halloween cause he doesnt like his face his self...remember he was teased an called ugly...so he wheres the mask an becomes someone else badda** michael myers..lol
VbB3o1Saaa	I think it may be either a friend that killed himself or Ryan got that call that he has to go back to Iraq. They seemed to be mentioning that alot in Wednesday nights show. I think that Chet, Ryan, JD, and Scott are the most annoying males ever casted on the Real World. I cannot stand Chet. I think he had no right to get all up in D's business about her and David and Jim's relationship like he did.|`|yDtKj4dhaa	his friend dies from a mental break down and the boys put a rat in devons and sarahs beds bcuz scott and JD are annoyed by devon and her attitude and dating another guy while having a fiance in the house even and arguing with jd AND sarah bcuz she and jd are arguing too

sR7jM0UCaa	Sometimes, you can't just  base your truth on what you have been told - on what you have heard. Sometimes you need solid proof. You don't have to be told which one is a lie and which one is the truth. You can and you are allowed to make your own belief. You decide the truth. Why? That's because these people can and will deceive you. You have to make your own stand. Lead your life the way you want to lead it. It's yours and yours alone.<br>  <br>  "Open your eyes.<br>  Close your ears."<br>  - Sometimes,seeing is believing. It would be foolish to believe everything you hear. It's like a rumor. You need proof to believe that it's true.<br>  <br>  "Listen to what you see.<br>  You are blind to what you hear.<br>  Listen to what you see.<br>  Do not fear the truth beneath."<br>  - The proof is right in front of you. Consider it. You know it's the truth but you are just too scared to believe it. You're not supposed to fear it. You're supposed to face it.<br>  <br>  "Reach for roots beneath the trees.<br>  Listen to the words you seek.<br>  Don’t listen to a word they say.<br>  Do NOT listen to a word you’ve heard ."<br>  - A tree has so many branches heading towards different directions. I think the singer is trying to say that so many lies can be formed from one truth. These lies are also used to hide the truth. People can twist and manipulate this truth into something that can deceive you. If you want the truth then look for the core of these lies but make sure that you won't be influenced by their lies.<br>  <br>  "People are people.<br>  We live for our own.<br>  Live how you think not by what you’ve been told."<br>  - People will be people. But remember that we live for ourselves. We have to live for our own good. Sure you care about other people but don't ever forget yourself. Live a life you want to lead. Don't live a life where you are constantly being told on what to do. Be independent.<br>  <br>  "I've been a fool.<br>  Oh I've been a fool.<br>  Walking the line with both of my eyes shut.<br>  And I'm begging you,<br>  Oh I'm begging you.<br>  Don't listen to a word you've heard."<br>  - The singer is saying that he was a fool himself. He made a mistake by living a life based on what other people are telling him to do. He wants us to learn from his mistake by believing in ourselves and to not be influenced by words so easily.<br>  <br>  "This world is full of strangers.<br>  This world is full of hypocrites,<br>  Scratching for their winnings.<br>  At least I am one to admit."<br>  - Don't trust people so easily. We live in a world filled with people who wants to use you and crush you. <br>  <br>  "Oh born in a world relying on gold.<br>  I've yet to find someone under control."<br>  - Basically, right now, we are living in a world relying more on materialistic things. All around us are materials waiting to be bought with money. The more money you have, the more you can buy. So far, he can't find anyone who can control this urge.<br>  <br>  "The flag waves up above you,<br>  For liberty and freedom<br>  And fighting for your nation.<br>  Killing a wives, daughters, husbands, son<br>  And your told,<br>  That you're being attacked<br>  By terrorist invasions.<br>  But over and over again,<br>  It is you who points the gun."<br>  - I have to be honest with this. No offense but this verse makes me think of the war between America and Iraq. People are deceived to believe that they are actually fighting for freedom. But the victims are your ordinary civilians. They are told that they are being invaded by terrorist but the truth is that they are the ones who are being terrorist.<br>  <br>  "If you close your eyes right now,<br>  Try to seek a vision you can listen to.<br>  A vision of collisions of what you know is true.<br>  You can do what you pursue if you only try to,<br>  To open your eyes,<br>  And listen to the visions colliding with collisions.<br>  Collisions on a mission,<br>  Risen from what you’ve listened to."<br>  - Close your eyes and find a vision that makes sense to you. A vision in this conflict you know is true. You can seek the truth if you just try to open your eyes and realize that it is right in front of you. <br>  <br>  "No.<br>  Don’t listen to a word you’ve heard.<br>  Don’t listen to a word you’ve heard.<br>  Unless,<br>  Unless the word that you’ve heard is a word that you said."<br>  - Don't listen to a word you've heard unless you are sure of it. Unless you are sincere about it.<br>  <br>  "Close your ears to words from out.<br>  Unless the word came out your head,<br>  Or the word was built with your hands.<br>  Close your soul to a voice of a man from a non distant land.<br>  'Cause that man has a plan to put bullets through your stand."<br>  - Don't listen to their words unless you've made sense out of them. Unless you have earned the proof. Close your soul to those who are looking forward to deceive you because they will do anything to destroy your faith and everything that you stand for.<br>  <br>  "Do you stand under this,<br>  Or<br>  Do you stand over this?<br>  Do you over stand me?<br>  You must not be listening.<br>  Its O.K. I understand<br>  Why."<br>  - Are you going to believe them or are you going to search for the truth? The singer is still in doubt whether people are taking him seriousl
XQvLV5imaa	I do this all the time.  If you are playing from violin music, just picture the note head ONE WHOLE STEP DOWN. So when reading violin music, it would go from:<br>  <br>  .......this ...............to this.......<br>  ____________                                                     ____________<br>  ____________                                                     ____________<br>  _____O______                                                    ____________<br>  ____________                                                     ______O_____<br>  ____________                                                     ____________<br>  <br>  and if you are reading from viola, just picture the note head ONE HALF STEP DOWN.  So when reading viola music, it would go from:<br>  <br>  .......this ...............to this.......<br>  ____________                                                      ---------------------<br>  ____________                                                      ---------------------<br>  _____O______                                                     ---------O----------<br>  ____________                                                      ---------------------<br>  ____________                                                      ---------------------<br>  <br>  the notes will be exactly the same (just lower... as you are a cello, after all).  You can either just picture the change in your head, or rewrite it for yourself on manuscript paper. =)<br>  <br>  (and confidentially... if you are playing it *all by yourself*, first you might try just pretending the music already IS in cello clef.  Often times the note or half note shift is not enough to throw you into too bad of a key anyway.  Try it!)|`|qvyI35r8aa	Well cellists should be able to read Treble clef. They definitely should be able to read it. Alto and Tenor clefs as well. For violin, moving it down one-two octaves depending. Or not at all if you are able to. (my friend can do that) But if you are an intermediate player, move the note down an octave, and if you are beginning (then you probably can't read treble clef anyway) then move it down two octaves. <br>   Viola music you move down one octave since the viola is one octave higher than the cello. Viola music is in Alto and sometimes treble clef.|`|SYkzZtW7aa	For viola music: just take it down an octave. Viola parts (in their "normal" register) are in alto clef; the middle line is middle C. The viola's open strings are exactly an octave higher than the cello's.<br>  <br>  For violin music: you might take that down an octave as well, although you could end up in the stratosphere; those sections might have to be written *two* octaves lower.<br>  <br>  The easiest way to go about things might be to download the MIDIFILES, then use a sequencer program to transpose into the desired key/register.<br>  <br>  - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -

TJBEeXO2aa	I would advise you to not use the raspy voice mode if you do not know what you're doing. You can most possibly be singing from your throat, which will spoil your voice. <br>  <br>  Warm up is essential as it opens up your notes.<br>  <br>  Do you sing songs for warm up? I recommend soft solfege(do,re,mi) in which you can hum too if you do not like singing it out.<br>  <br>  To get a raspy voice...eat chips and fried stuff before you sing. But do note that this may not be as healthy too, but many screamo singers on youtube do that. Drink plenty of water, have nothing stuck in your throat.|`|RrgmHGNMaa	1) Water, just natural water;<br>  2) Yoga-like (or common, natural but lasting/longing-by-and-by) breathing;<br>  3) Relaxing physical exercises (nothing strong or hard);<br>  4) Singing softly musical scales little by little (3 notes - first, diatonic; then, chromatic - upwards, the same downwards; 5 notes upwards, the same downwards - first, diatonic; then, chromatic; and so on - at your choice); then strengthening/stresssing-softening/mitig... voice and notes; <br>  5) Pause;<br>  6) Water (not iced);<br>  7) Relaxing;<br>  8) Singing a complete diatonic (8 grades) upwards and downwards, starting softly and increasing, strengthening by and by; then decreasing and softening; after such pratice, try to change to other keys and do all again;<br>  9) Pause; relax; water;<br>  10) Singing half a chromatic scale (12 notes), from soft to strong and vice-versa, upwards and downwards; then a complete chromatic scale, same way; after such practice, try to change to other keys and do all again. - Sometimes try to sing notes distinguishing LEGATTO & STACCATTO, you know? A good exercise for singing words later on.<br>  <br>  Useful? Helpful? Great! Good luck!<br>  Greetings from Brazil, South America.
HcCYeLMAaa	YES ! i think once an abuser always an abuser !<br>  it doesn't matter if your male or female you should never EVER place your hands on another person the way he did .|`|cpOMMZffaa	He possibly might go for 9 years.|`|ojiO3svoaa	he will go to jail.|`|K2jT1z5jaa	I reckon he should|`|24e3c53ff3387eb84f27768983042d80aa	He should but the question is, will he? <br>  Since the guy has lots of money he might get out of it or get the minimum sentence (which I don't know what it is) and that is of course if Rhianna presses charges against him because she may not forgive him but maybe she just doesn't want to continue this whole drama and decides to put it to rest. <br>  In my opinion he shouldn't get less than 10 years, but will see. He said he was going to get help from his family and from his hometown preacher, but that is no punishment which is what he needs.<br>  I don't give a damn if Rhianna might have done something he didn't like or what kind of a person she might be, there is no damn reason to hit a woman and least of all beat her up as he did, because it wasn't just a slap (which imo is unforgivable too). <br>  <br>  And is really disgusting and sad how many people think she deserved it, the women who say that are just pathetic and stupid, and the man that say that are as manly as Chris Brown....which is nothing at all, any man that hits a woman cannot be call a man. This people are a disgrace to the human race, even animals behave better.<br>  <br>  Edit:<br>  Layla, she doesn't have herpes that's just a rumor even Chris brown said it.

Maybe Pisces and Taurus as well.|`|zTuc5eDIaa	What does it matter which month you are born in?|`|9CCtt077aa	I think Leo and Scorpio are genuinely the most passionate signs, but if you're talking about nudity and sexuality in an exhibitionistic way, then I would actually have to say Aquarius. They can be quite extreme and very often they simply like to provoke just for fun. They can easily do sexual things without being too emotional/serious about it.|`|nxHjSKTTaa	I am not sure exactly what you mean here. I would not walk around with no clothes on.  I do enjoy sex.  I am not horny all the time. So what exactly do you mean?
32sYRZb7aa	LOL that was a good one!<br>  <br>  Hmmm, I like so many of them!!! My favorite would have to be episode 7 from the second season. It was so sad to see Lelouch, who had come all this way for his sister's sake, watch as his sister joined the opposing force against him. It shows that even people like Lelouch can experience a loss of motivation and struggle to find their purpose again. <br>  <br>  I just really liked the part near the end, where Lelouch talks about hapiness being like glass, how a lot of times you never seem to notice it, yet if you turn it at just the right angle, you can see that it was always there, just unnoticed. Then he realizes all the amazing friends he has and decides that that's what he's going to fight for. Not just his sister - but everyone.<br>  <br>  Otherwise I really like the one episode in the first season where Lelouch goes to save Shirley from Mao. It was so touching!!!!!<br>  <br>  (I think I might have picked Milly's graduation as my favorite, but you already had it.)|`|p0YoWZeyaa	I ? all the episodes, especially the ones at the school and everyone is goofy. <br>  <br>  I really &heart; when Milly graduates too but the ending upsets me when Shirley learns everything about Zero again. I also miss Milly. She was crazy && hilarious.<br>  <br>  I also ? episode 5 of R2 when they throw a welcoming party for Suzaku's homecoming and CC threatens Lelouch's secret for some pizza and then she gets stuck in the tomatoe container.<br>  <br>  I just plain && simply love all episodes of Code Geass!!! :D|`|pzkw5LJ7aa	mine is where milly graduates and they all have to wear those ridiculous hats..and the one where every1 dresses as zero and they escape to japan|`|XiYLKF8Saa	Mines is the One Million Zeros. That was the slickest move I seen in any Anime.|`|frqfB0usaa	=3 The last one. Although it made me cry and wish it didn't happen it was a great ending and made me (Although he killed people) Admire him more.<br>  =3 He was a great character and probably the best one in the anime lol.

nxHjSKTTaa	Intense, serious, passionate, intuitive, loyal, mysterious.<br>  <br>  These two could be happy together for life. Scorpios are the most misunderstood sign in the Zodiac. So for them to find eachother would be like coming home, a home they may never leave.  This would be a heated passionate union full of mystery.  They could sit together quietly in a room for hours and not say one word to each other yet know exactly what the other is thinking, just by reading the others mind. <br>  <br>  Sounds yummy!|`|821bd483afcea62cd9c3a4d1aa91236caa	my mom is a scorpio, and she is currently dating another scorpio, they have plans on getting married soon.<br>  they talk... a lot. but they are very quiet when i am around, i guess they don't feel comfortable talking about personal things when people are close, so they just remain quiet.<br>  also, they seem pretty normal. i've never seen them fight before.<br>  <br>  he hates me, and i hate him... so i don't really know whats going on behind my back.|`|HuXMiJLpaa	The physical and emotional chemistry is amazing, but like another person said outside of the bedroom is where are the problems lay. I've been a scorpio-scorpio relationship and the problem was that we didnt trust each other along with our communication problems and pride. The scorpio male I was with had only dated tauruses who loved to shower him with affection, chased him and worshiped him, on the other hand I'm a scorpio female and none of the above is coming from me. Both have to be willing to be mature and put their pride aside. Both have to communicate their feelings and build trust, once they overcome that, it'll be pure heaven (but of course hell as well).|`|cLgwmcfwaa	ooo VERY intense. Scorpio loves its self and you both always know what eachother needs when it comes to sex. however, outside of the bed, maybe not so good. you will always feel like the other is having an affair or cheating on you. you will always be suspicious of one another. makes no sense to me. you both know that scorpio is the most faithful of all signs, right?|`|ATSLuU12aa	Well im a scorpio with aquarius rising...and i've been with a scorpio before...ehh didnt go well. He got mad at me for not calling him a lot. And i like to be distant sometimes...he had a really strong temper which i didnt tolerate.He was really jealous, always suspicious, and obssesive.<br>  <br>  i wouldn't go with another scorpio ever again.<br>  But some relationships do last.|`|bvwYVGJOaa	I'm scared of them..both men and women

yk3d5jsPaa	Well I did manage to find the Careers section, it's under Business and Finance if you haven't found it already. =]<br>  As for the rest, I really don't know, but there's such a wide variety of jobs these days I should think that something calls for that kind of knowledge. You might have to be a little more general with it though, like using it as part of a job in journalism. Talk to your Careers Advisor at school if you have one. [I've never had a chance to go to mine, so I don't know if they're much good, but yours could be more help than me waffling on ;) ]<br>  There will be loads of competition with people applying for Kerrang and stuff, so it could be quite difficult. But you could try emailing them to get more information.<br>  Hope this was slightly helpful..! Good luck!|`|4a4fc6fd359a16c13169b1185d22b8b7aa	Check out <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Music_history." rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Music_histo...</a><br>  Most university degrees are 3 (full) years, are they not?

gtAb94d2aa	Fight Club by Chuck Palahniuk!<br>  <br>  Palahniuk wrote some of the best books I have ever read.

That would be neat.|`|76SAdZ19aa	Yes I agree Twilight was a bad movie and I think Robert P. is like so darn ugly...No Offense but I think that Confessions of a Shopaholic was the best movie from a book.|`|XE3PCLWNaa	Pride and Prejudice and Narnia|`|Jnp9qQWJaa	The Notebook...the endings are different but it doesn't even matter because either ending does the job of getting you to cry!<br>  <br>  A Walk To Remember was good too.|`|JCJVi8Qraa	From Here to Eternity- Written by James Jones and best picture of 1953.|`|o6FM4vEraa	The godfather 1 and 2 follow the book pretty good!|`|NUGErTlzaa	The Green Mile - Stephen King<br>  <br>  Unbelievable|`|tcUADMWFaa	twilight!! harry potter, notebook!|`|VkVyuq5baa	Slumdog Millionaire.|`|xDubataIaa	Lord of the Rings in my opinion.

I gave up the first book before I finished it. I have watched all three movies and  find them very great and I think that could be ThE BEST movie adapted from book, and are still worth watching million times.<br>  <br>  Some negative points: The level of violence was a little shocking (including elephant cruelty); the sets seemed fake at times; the acting was non-existent (even from very good actors); and it was too long.<br>  <br>  Some positive points: The battle scenes must have taken a lot of work to choreograph, and congratulations for pulling that off; it was sort of exciting (until the conclusion where I got sleepy because it was so long); some of the music was really interesting!; and they must have done something else right, since they won 11 Oscars.|`|tm0rUy8raa	I agree that Twilight the movie was weak compared to the novels.

The only way a CD of theirs could come out in December is if they start making one sometime in the near future (unlikely). Evanescence is currently on hiatus, and will be for an unknown amount of time, and yes, possibly forever. The newest music you will find is from Amy Lee, who recently did a track for the album Nightmare Revisited called 'Sally's Song'. Amy is currently writing music that may or may not be used for a new album (solo) in the future, or for a movie.|`|AA12153674	This December?As in Dec 09?<br>  Well, i don't know. When you say 'apparently there is', where did you hear this?<br>  Evanescence is probably over and done with, though we can still hope not.<br>  And we are anticipating Amy Lee's solo album, so that might be the thing you heard of that's coming out in december.

e97037e29bf6dd323c13e9097d4a5669aa	Improv is usually very hard if you don't have a piece that you're playing it to. Like, usually there's a head chart that you're playing with and you improvise during the solo section. Then you can use the melody to kind of shape your solo. It's a lot easier than just playing random notes and praying they sound good. Also, if you focus your attention around the root, 3rd and 5th, that's good, too. The flat 5th is also good, but don't hold on it too long. Also, if you know the blues progression, use that definitely. Then you can focus on the roots of those chords when you get to those specific measures. <br>  <br>  Good Luck :)|`|RBW9ZX1iaa	Becca is Absolutely right. If anything you can simply play different variations of the melody. Try experimenting with some different riffs in the key of B flat major, when your soloing you can play any notes in that scale. But the thing about jazz is that you can bend the rules and play any number of notes that clash and cause tension(as long you resolve them). Like Becca said the augmented fourth or flat fifth can sound really cool but remember not to use it to much. It is usually resolved with the third directly below it. You also might want to start playing some pentatonic scales, they can come in handy when you are soloing. There are tons of books you can read about soloing but I'm not sure about websites. My best guess  would be to simply google "Improvisational studies". <br>  Good luck with your audition

The Crab will be patient with Virgo's fussy and exacting nature. Virgo individuals are very shy and find it very difficult to express their deepest and most intimate feelings.

The director was clear in saying he wanted a rabbit lol.<br>  Oh to correct a few things Donnie is not hit by a meteor (it was an airplane part) and he is not hallucinating etc. because of his pills, lots of people say this, Donnie's pills are nothing, it's in a deleted scene, he is taking placebos.|`|qxHwSQTHaa	Uhh.. cause Frank dressed up as a bunny for Halloween and... then went back to help Donnie... I dunno.<br>  <br>  He just was a bunny.|`|AA10739434	Just any random image in Donny's mind. But remember Frank made him get out of bed to not hit with the meteor. Also, Frank told him to do things that would uncover bad things other people do.<br>  Why a rabbit? I do not know. Maybe because it was Halloween and Frank's costume matched that portal. But at the end Frank became the next Donny. Perhaps it is his turn to expose bad guys or whatever.|`|2p7u0RAeaa	Frank,the Bunny,is Donnie Darko's imaginary friend.Donnie Darko is suffering from some sort of mental condition.<br>  <br>  But I guess there are other interpretations as well.|`|Isxq5DhOaa	I dont know why a bunny inparticular but i think IF i remember corectly it was a costume that Frank was working on for something..i think (:
RpGkAw9Vaa	It almost sounds like "A Time To Kill"
ufLR9gvTaa	That's "Tamara"|`|bFJQyRusaa	Yup, that's Tamara all right, here is the story_<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  The movie opens with Tamara performing a ritual of some sort. She dreams about being with her English teacher, whom she loves. Tamara is a shy, unattractive but intelligent girl, and when an article she writes about the school's athletes is published, two of the star athletes want revenge. Chloe, Roger, Patrick, Shawn, Jesse and Kisha are involved in a prank which goes terribly wrong and results in Tamara's death. All but Chloe decide to bury the body, to protect their futures.<br>  <br>  The next day though, Tamara walks into the classroom with a new, seductive look. Everyone is shocked, but who is even more shocked is the people who were involved with her death.<br>  <br>  Because Roger made no attempt to help Tamara or come forward with her death, Tamara makes Roger cut off his own ear, tongue, and finally gouge his own eye. This fits with his past history of cutting himself.<br>  <br>  Realizing that her father fantazises about being with her and that his alcoholism drove her mother away, Tamara makes him "finish the bottle", which literally, he eats the beer bottle, thus choking to death on the actual glass.<br>  <br>  At a party that night, Tamara puts her spell on Patrick and Shawn, and forces them to have anal sex with each other, with Patrick being symbolically 'raped' by Shawn, as he has done to girls he had drugged in the past.<br>  <br>  Chloe, Jesse, and Kisha track down Mr. Natolly and tell him of Tamara's plans to seduce him and kill everyone in her way. Horrified, Mr. Natolly immediately wants to protect his wife Allison from Tamara. Kisha (under Tamara's spell) calls Tamara and tells them what they know, and Tamara retaliates by sending Shawn and Patrick to the Natolly's home to kill Allison. Fortunately, Allison is able to fend for herself and is forced to kill Patrick and Shawn.<br>  <br>  Kisha and Allison are both taken to the hospital and treated, but Kisha wakes up and chases down Jesse and Chloe, resulting in Jesse's death.<br>  <br>  In the climax of the film, on top of the hospital, Mr. Natolly, Allison, Chloe, and Tamara finally confront each other. Tamara, unable to control Chloe due to her innocence, and realizing what a monster herself has become, breaks down, slowly changing back into a corpse. Before finally fading away, Tamara asserts her will to be with Mr. Natolly and he appears to surrender to the inevitable. Mr. Natolly holds Tamara close and is about to kiss her, but actually grabs her hard and throws them both off the hospital building. They both die. In the end, Chloe and Allison are fine, but Kisha, still apparently under the spell, takes the magic book, hinting a sequel.<br>  <br>                                THE END<br>  <br>  This the cast_<br>  <br>  Cast<br>  Tamara Riley - Jenna Dewan <br>  Chloe Bowman - Katie Stuart <br>  Jesse - Chad Faust <br>  Shawn - Bryan Clark <br>  Kisha - Melissa Elias <br>  Patrick - Gil Hacohen <br>  Bill Natolly - Matthew Marsden <br>  Allison Natolly - Claudette Mink <br>  Roger - Marc Devigne <br>  Mr. Riley - Chris Sigurdson|`|6kic2Uytaa	tamara|`|vpRERM9jaa	haha idk what it is but it sounds interesting.lol

If you just want to be a pop star its never going to happen. Those famous people have a passion for what they do and that makes people want to listen to them and that's why they are famous, because they know how to put real life feelings into songs so when you see them it makes you feel like that.|`|Yy3zDYW1aa	u can make auditons in places and if they accept u,u can become a popstar.(i would suggest the company hollywood records)|`|wA8Dyhq7aa	"I couldn't imagine getting paid for anything as wonderful as playing the guitar for people.

WkPFahdLaa	They knew of each other and they might have met but they were not friends. Miles did not like the fact that Armstrong was so "commerical" for alot of his career. Davis would have seen that as Armstrong doing what white people wanted him to do. However Miles' playing (like all jazz trumpet players) was influenced by Armstrong. Now, people might say that Miles was influenced by Roy Eldridge but Eldridge was influenced by Armstrong. In the tradition of jazz trumpet playing it all leads back to Louis.|`|VYWaL2graa	Louis Armstrong cringed in pain at every note Miles Davis ever played.|`|e97037e29bf6dd323c13e9097d4a5669aa	I don't think so. They were kind of different eras.|`|4850afc4e1575249b34a8547afc4c916aa	That a good question I know a lot about Miles Davis but I never read where they met each other, Miles did not care that Louis Armstrong caring on the way he did around white people. It was like Step en Fletcher the way blacks carry on around white people that yes ma boss  ****. Will look through about five books I have on Miles to see if they ever met. Miles Davis dispied that s***.

9PCY2ScMaa	tips: <br>  - always moisturize before foundation so it spreads evenly and wont cause spots and makes your skin glow for spring!! <br>  - put a very small amount of vaseline on your eyelashes over night so you can barely even see it and not so its gloppy and your eyelashes should grow after a couple of weeks as it moisturizes them, then it will be easier to go out with less mascara that will run in spring showers!!<br>  - paint your toe nails a vibrant colour so when you wear your spring peep toes or sandals, they look bright and pretty<br>  <br>  hope these help: i had to do a magazine as well!!! :D

Fyt9JxTqaa	Wow. This is the most interesting, thoughtful and greatest question I've seen all my Y! A life.<br>  <br>  I agree with the Mr. Burns theory.|`|9haTWuHsaa	hahaha... so true!|`|vtYRw2yWaa	Are you insane?|`|2DK4QoV9aa	lol your must be a real fan of the Simpsons i can see you thought about it =]|`|e9vcseLlaa	I know yeah... I think they do have a mechanic but i saw that episode a while back and can't remember it. Mr Burnes had his car damaged by nelson that's when the family go to Pompeii to get Mr Burns' New Mercedes.  maybe they fix it themselves ha ha.... Oh yeah i remember the episode now, where they have a mechanic i think it was where Homer and marge had a leak in the basement and they had to stand on the stairs to keep away from the flood. (that's the one where homer joins the stone cutters)  Hope i helped. x|`|cadc0f87795906b4bbf2d3471ee1f685aa	maybe the mechanic is out by the springfield airport, and i believe they'd get their cars fixed in between episodes, and if we're really going to be asking such extensive questions, why does homer never stop for fuel? That does explain why burns is so stingy, maybe he beat the mechanic with a futon mattress until he lowered prices?|`|00d16583a6262fd502ed6a2c9d7dee08aa	okay I'll try to answer your question, sorta. But no simpson geek jokes please.<br>  There is a mechanic in Springfield. In the episode where Homer needs heart surgery, he takes his car to a mechanic to find out what that "weird, irregular thumping noise" is.  It's the mechanic who tells Homer that it's his heart.  To which Homer replies with relief,good I thought it was my transmission.  or something like that.<br>  bye|`|QktshEUYaa	Um..why does it matter. It's a cartoon, it's like watching Family Guy and saying what was the moral of this episode and did it even make Sense? Your never gonna get an answer because nobody can answer it! But Homer has actually gotten his car fixed by a mechanic, I don't know the episode off hand but I do know it's between season 6 and 9. Also who wants to see Homer get his car fixed, that would be a very boring and show cancelling episode.|`|2fbde007751b53153f91de150f61ac5caa	This is the best question ever.

16t0eV0Uaa	Pink Floyd easily, Led zep are over the radar overrated, boring.<br>  <br>  Jimmy page could only play 2 scales, and he is a very sloppy guitar player, they are way less original than Pink Floyd, Robert Plant was not that great of a singer and it felt like he had to orgasm in the middle of every song.  Pink Floyd were a creative force to be reckon with, they had some very amazing melodies, concepts, and David Gilmour's guitar playing is so much more emotional than Jimmy Page's, it felt like I was listening to him speak when he was playing guitar.  <br>  <br>  Pink Floyd took much more chances than Led Zeppelin, Led Zeppelin stole a lot of their music from blues artist, and their chord progressions were not that interesting to me to be honest.  Pink Floyd were one of the first band's to create ambient atmospheres, use synths, They were totally unlike anything else back then.<br>  <br>  Sorry, but Led Zeppelin, while they are good... don't really hold a candle to Pink Floyd, even though you can't really compare them.<br>  <br>  Darth: terrible arguments, you can't just say "HES BETTER, HES BETTER," that does not make them better...|`|a79b8a93426576f5d2c9cb6a23ba338faa	This is a very hard question for me.  I give the nod to Pink Floyd largely because of their works from 1967 to 1972.  Pink Floyd had such an influence on Psychedelic Rock, Progressive Rock, and Krautrock.|`|eaYdc3c8aa	lol   Led Zeppelin   (question revisited)   :)|`|g7uMKvEzaa	This is a very tough question, I love them both...I think I actually prefer Pink Floyd though cuz I can listen to them forever,,where Led Zeppelin is alot more upbeat and ya have to listen to them in a good mood, I can be sad and Pink Floyd will comfort me ,not make me turn down the music...TOUGH CALL for sure!|`|VXQFT341aa	Pink Zeppelin. Hey I like them both. But would lean toward Led Zepplin.|`|d0b19b6e53bf5f04f7ade24285468c28aa	Pink Floyd|`|AA11618061	pink floyd<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  mmm|`|Catsy82Caa	pink floyd duh|`|qcXXtcRRaa	they are both to good to pick....and to john s "are you high? pink floyd has just as much influence in rock as led zppelin has, they have two of the most influential albums of all time and dark side of the moon was in the billboard top 200 for 15 yeas straight, a record i might add...bottom line led zeppelin could not do what pink floyd did and pink floyd could not do what led zeppelin did. and they are two contrasting styles|`|JyxNA1o0aa	Zeppelin #1!|`|JWjq5iaXaa	tough... but I'm a HUGE Pink Floyd Fan, and although I have nothing against Led Zeppelin, I prefer Pink Floyd.|`|4UeOIGuhaa	Led Zeppelin|`|NC67WVlEaa	I love both but, I prefer Zeppelin.|`|xJgILr5faa	Both good cant it just be that ,you should ask what mood are you in|`|hZegT1raaa	i'll go with zep but just barely|`|dFacbjIZaa	Sorry but Led Zeppelin were actually greater individually talented musical virtuosos than the members of Floyd were, and as much as I love Floyd I consider Zep to be the greater band of the two.<br>  <br>  Think about it..<br>  <br>  Guitar. Gilmour is great but He's no Jimmy Page<br>  Drums. Sorry but Bonzo absolutely kills Nick Mason no two ways about it.<br>  Vocals. Neither Barret, nor Gilmour, nor Waters has near Plant's range and power.<br>  Keys. Well not a fair comparison, Rick Wright was a better Keyboardist than John Paul Jones by a little, but Jones is more of a multi-instrumentalist virtuoso.<br>  Bass. Waters might be a fraction better than Jones<br>  <br>  See, Zep wins by miles<br>  <br>  Law Man brings up a good point though too, Floyd's influence on Rock is truly massive, but then again, so is Zep's|`|hQbUwLvwaa	Im gonna go with Led Zepplin. Both of them are in my top 10 but I can get bored with Pink Floyd at times because a lot of their song are mostly instrumental. I like thier style but Led Zepplin is hard to get bored of.|`|qThmcR1Aaa	Love 'em both, but I like Floyd better. Gilmour is my favorite guitarist, and one of my favorite all-time musicians.|`|0ectWZxAaa	I saw Roger Waters live :) <br>  But I still have to say Led Zeppelin<br>  Pink Floyd gets a bit boring after a while, <br>  but Zeppelin never gets old.|`|8jd2AHJdaa	I prefer Pink Floyd.<br>  <br>  Why?<br>  Pink Floyd: Amazing<br>  Led Zepplin: Boring|`|6eee3c0b647347e08b85c17f1991c44eaa	How about both?!

You can't compare the two when it comes to studio recordings. Floyd's are sonic masterpieces.<br>  <br>  Led Zeppelin for live shows. Sorry but the Floyd couldn't hold a candle to Zep when it came to a live show. Bonzo would be out of control with Page right there with him. Plant's vocals would soar, and then there was Jones holding everything together.|`|MSST8jNlaa	Pink Floyd, I love them both but, Zepellins songs are copies of older songs.|`|psS6XbXkaa	Pink floyd!!!

PPHd7NGLaa	You definitely have a powerful connection with those signs, there should be quite a spark, and a great deal of understanding. However, he might be a bit to crazy and sexual, possible to a promiscuous level, with the double Scorpio and Venus in sag. In my opinion, loyalty is actually an issue you should probably be worried about, from my experience Venus in Sag often ends up bad, your Venus in Leo makes you more monogamous, and of course very loyal, but the sag Venus people tend to be very adventurous, then mix that with the intense power and charm of the double scorpio... But other than that, you seem like a very good match, however you should also be looking into where your mars's are.
3xOKvjzDaa	i reallyy hope lily doesnt raise that baby. that would be sooooo messed up. its billy and chloes. chloe never even told billy he was the dad, he just found out on  his own. and chloe is the mother, despite the things she has done. i dont like cane or lily anymore, so just let them get together, have their own baby and leave chloe and billy alone. cane can still be apart of the babys life as an uncle.|`|EPPb5pRBaa	Good Question,, I think he probably could,but if Billy steps up it could be more drama.|`|uUzbqGh5aa	Why should Lily want anything to do with that baby much less raise it with Cane? Rumor also has it that she's supposed to get pregnant by Billy so we'll see.|`|jCHcjJ9Baa	I have read that too.  I hope that is not the way they write the story.  Chloe and Billy should get married and raise their own baby, I like them together.<br>  Cane and Lily should get married and have their own child.
ow1m3c8jaa	Well, if it were me that had carried that child for nine long months and then almost lost my life in the process of having the baby, I would be more than furious that the baby's father went head and named the baby without me!<br>  <br>  Just wait till Billy and Chloe find out that Cane put his signature on the birth certificate as the baby's father.<br>  There should be some real you know what hitting the fan then!|`|75zggy81aa	I would be mad- its not like he would have been carrying it around in his belly for nine long months! I think its strange that they would even allow it. oh and as for the birth certificate, him signing it alone, they act like it is so final and concrete- i think he looks desperate and crazy!|`|2f8d927b404e673e434c880af431f65caa	I would have been VERY upset with him after everything she`s been through to have her, then not be able to name her. That was very inconsiderate of Cane. It could have been Bertha or something worse than Cordelia Katherine. He still should have waited for her to wake before naming her.|`|5f0111f71db8592710a5d1cb4897be4aaa	If the name was a ''good'' name,,,I wouldn't have a problem > BUT with the name he gave that poor baby ,,,I think I would throw a fit. <br>  But you are so right with Cane trying to control the situation > Looks like he really is now ( since signing the birth certificate )|`|D6u0Jfeiaa	I don't think it's a big deal.  Cane even told her she could change the name if she didn't like it.  It's a very fitting name too.  I like that he named her Cordelia because of the whole heart/valentine/valentine's day tie-in.  Very cute.  She can be called Delia for short too.|`|r7sgshwKaa	Chloe has more to worry about then having Cain naming the baby while she was unconcious. She better be worried about what Cain will do to her when he finds out she lied about him being the daddy.|`|jCHcjJ9Baa	I agree they should have discussed and agreed on a name together.  But this is "soapland" and no one has the baby in a hospital either.|`|Mlf7Kss4aa	it's just a show. damnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnn!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!|`|uUzbqGh5aa	NO! I would be too busy hanging my head in shame knowing that l took a man away from his fiance! Trapping him with a lie that we had sex and now l'm pregnant with his child! Knowing it's his brother's child, all the while wishing l could be with the brother, but hey, my husband is a "good catch"! Chloe should be grateful that after all is said and done Cane still gives a dam about her baby and she should be eternally grateful  that it wasn't him that knocked her unconscious after she crashed his world like that!|`|jHDeIPEfaa	Chloe and Cain should have discussed baby names before the baby was born. I don't know if I would be mad if my husband named our baby without me, but I know I would feel hurt. Given Chloe's circunstances though, I would try to be understanding. The baby deserves a name and can't wait forever for Chloe to awake from her coma.|`|AA11111233	This is why couples would agree on baby names for both sexes before the baby comes out.  I think that would be good old common sense.|`|msQqxMIbaa	Cane is in seriuos denial!  But, Cane and Hoe-oe did kiss!|`|msUIsv8maa	He didnt think Chloe would make it and he said it was a nam,e Chloe talked about.|`|RqeoCyzYaa	yeah! i know i would have been upset.  its a  ugly name } it sounds like a old hand maidens name.

He is an adequate film-maker, who simply turns things morbid, gothic, and pale.... and takes away any happiness from the plot... and makes the humor twisted and backwards, when there is any...<br>  <br>  and voila!  You get a bunch of cult hits that all the goth kids want to see.  I don't care if you thumbs down me- he's simply NOT that great of a filmmaker!  He's "OK".  It's just that he's the only one who appeals to the "kids who wear all black", and therefore they love him for it.<br>  =======================<br>  It's the same way with Irish/punk people liking Boondock Saints, or w*ggers liking the movie 8 Mile! They're both NOT THAT GREAT of films (theyre good, tho, yes).  But since people LOVE them, they're turned into a cult classic, for certain groups of people!|`|tLI94qWNaa	Films he wrote, produced, or directed???<br>  <br>  Edwardscissor hands<br>  The nightmare before christmas <br>  Beetlejuice <br>  <br>  I love them all because they bring back great memories and are just sheer brilliant.|`|8063947433f50c3e93546a4ba2133fdcaa	Edward Scissorhands<br>  The Nightmare Before Christmas<br>  Batman|`|AA11110732	1.

q6uyloYdaa	Basically at the end the plane acts as an agent to help reverse the alternate universe that Donnie is in. Time goes back to when the engine originally falls on his house, and obviously Donnie dies. He does this to spare the girl (I forget her name) from dying.<br>  If you watch the Director's Cut of the movie, it has some extra parts where it shows pages from the time travel book and lets you read them. Seeing those made the movie make much more sense to me.|`|lFzFtiCBaa	I personally hated the movie, but heres the explanation of the entire movie for you...<br>  <br>  Donnie Darko (played by Jake Gyllenhaal) is a troubled teenager in suburban Virginia in October 1988. He appears to be suffering the symptoms of paranoid schizophrenia. At the start of the film, he has recently stopped taking his medication. His parents, Rose and Eddie (Mary McDonnell and Holmes Osborne) and his sisters, Elizabeth and Samantha (Maggie Gyllenhaal and Daveigh Chase), are concerned about him. One night at dinner, Donnie and his sister get into a profane argument during which Elizabeth reveals she knows Donnie is no longer taking his medication. Rose confronts Donnie in his bedroom asking him where her little boy has gone and who the stranger is who has taken his place. As she leaves the room, she hears him call her a "*****" from the other side of the door. Feeling guilty, Donnie resumes taking his medication. On October 2, however, he sleepwalks and meets Frank (James Duval), a man in a menacing bunny costume. Frank tells him that in 28 days, 6 hours, 42 minutes and 12 seconds, the world will end. That night, a jet engine mysteriously crashes through the roof of the Darkos' house, destroying Donnie's bedroom.<br>  <br>  As Eddie drives Donnie to the office of Dr. Thurman (Katharine Ross), Donnie's therapist, Eddie nearly runs over Roberta Sparrow, also known as "Grandma Death" (Patience Cleveland). A senile old woman who spends her days walking back and forth from her house to the mailbox across the street, Grandma Death whispers in Donnie's ear that all living things die alone. This greatly troubles Donnie, who worries that life has no meaning.<br>  <br>  A few days later, Frank appears to Donnie in a hallucination and urges him to flood the private Catholic school he attends by breaking open the water main with an axe. Donnie also embeds the axe in the head of the school's solid bronze statue of its mascot and spray-paints "They made me do it" on the sidewalk. School is canceled that day and Donnie walks Gretchen (Jena Malone), the new girl in school, home. She reveals that her stepfather nearly killed her mother and is still on the loose. Donnie reveals his own troubled past as well as his intelligence. Gretchen calls Donnie weird (which was a compliment in her case), which then prompts Donnie to ask Gretchen to be his girlfriend. She quickly agrees.<br>  <br>  Donnie has a troubled relationship with the faculty at his high school. Ms. Pomeroy (Drew Barrymore) appreciates his intellect and ability to engage with and understand the difficult material she assigns them to read in English class. The science teacher, Dr. Monnitoff (Noah Wyle), finds his questions hard to take on due to staff limitations on religion, and Kitty Farmer (Beth Grant), the high-strung and priggish health instructor, is offended that he questions her use of self-help tapes in class. After he profanely rejects her use of the simplistic methods espoused by local celebrity Jim Cunningham (Patrick Swayze), Donnie finds himself suspended from after-school activities. When Donnie verbally assaults Cunningham during an appearance at the high school, he gets in even deeper trouble.<br>  <br>  Frank continues to appear to Donnie and tells Donnie that he can do anything and won't get caught. Frank also tells Donnie about time travel, further confusing him. Soon, Donnie sees tubes of fluid light extending out of his family's chests, indicating where they will go. His own tube beckons him to follow as it enters his parents' room and reveals the gun his father keeps in a box in the closet. Donnie speaks about time travel with Dr. Monnitoff who gives him a book, "The Philosophy of Time Travel," written by Roberta Sparrow. She used to be a nun and a teacher at the high school. However, the climate at the school is becoming increasingly conservative as Kitty Farmer leads a protest against Ms. Pomeroy's choice of reading material; one of the stories she had assigned, Graham Greene's "The Destructors," features teenagers who flood a man's house by breaking a water pipe. Ms. Pomeroy is fired and Dr. Monnittoff, who is also her boyfriend, refuses to discuss time travel with Donnie once his questions take a theological direction for fear he could also lose his job.<br>  <br>  Gretchen and Donnie grow closer. She is one of the few people he opens up to about his time travel visions, and they discuss how they wish they could travel back in time and prevent the bad things in their lives from happening. Dr. Thurman increases Donnie's medication and begins hypnotherapy with him. But Frank continues to appear to Donnie. One night, Donnie and Gretchen go to see the cult horror film The Evil Dead. Gretchen falls asleep and Frank appears. When Donnie asks Frank why he wears a "stupid bunny suit," Frank asks Donnie why he wears a "stupid man suit," then acquiesces and takes the head off, revealing a young adult (who looks like Elizabeth's boyfriend, Frank) with a gruesome wound in his right eye.

ZJoLtLrFaa	I bought mine from kinokuniya in NYC.....I've been taking japanese for a whole year in 大学.<br>  I suggest if you are learning on your own, this is not really a good way to learn...I mean it's good incentive and I think it's a great way to learn if you know some japanese already ^_^ but if you cannot read these: ひらが　と　カタカナ　と　感じ, if you are not able to read those, I really suggest buying a book ( or practice online) hiragana, katakana and then when you master those learn vocab and sentence structures then kanji. Hope that helps and the name in　日本語　is 美少女戦士セーラームーン. <br>  Ja mata!

HcEEAeZsaa	Well, to me, I didn't like Ian. He reminded me of Jacob from Twilight (and i don't like Jacob). I thought he got in the way, and he reminded me of some guy I know who's a real jerk. I liked Wanda with Jared and I was mad that Wanda left him for Ian. And I liked Wanda better. They were both really great but Melanie was really...mature. And I like more of the bubbly type. Wanda was interesting because of her views and how she acted. I really liked her!

YUjVFkocaa	Tyler was simply a figment of his imagination... in other words, he was his second personality.  The narrator knows that if he kills himself, he will kill Tyler too- which will end the killings which Tyler (the bad side of narrators brain) wants to do!<br>  <br>  So when he shoots himself, it symbolizes him thinking that hes dead, which makes tyler disappear- hence the bullet in tylers head, he symbolically killed tyler as well.<br>  <br>  Tyler cant ACTUALLY "die" or "live", since he is merely a figment of the narrator's twisted imagination. get it?|`|AA11706291	Because the bullet doesn't go through his cheek, exits out the lower side (near his jaw) of the head which destroys part of the left side of the brain which controls the conscience.

QK4r41Hqaa	US music sucks, I've learned that (sadly) over the years. I'm hearing less and less decent musis *sigh*<br>  <br>  UK hip hop wins.... and wins again, then stomps on US hiphop, and wins for a 3rd time.<br>  <br>  My fav is Korean hip hop though...<br>  <br>  edit:<br>  <br>  well it looks like I must just be hearing the wrongs stuff, I'm not extreamly into hip-hop.<br>  So, I'm probably compairing unfairly. I've heard far more US music then UK's, and what I listen to from the UK is only stuff I find on the internet...<br>  And that leads me to find really, really good msuic from the UK.<br>  <br>  Then I hear crap US on the radio....<br>  <br>  so.... yea.|`|SLTlvqRlaa	Call it grime... its our genre and the beats are totally different to hip hop.<br>  <br>  I think that at the moment, US hiphop is still ahead due to it being more widely recognised. For example, if someone who didnt really listen to Hip Hop in america saw, maybe, Jay Z on TV, there would be a good chance they would know who he is. Whereas if they saw Tinchy Stryder or ChipMunk here, they wouldn't. However, Grime is becoming more mainstream with artists such as Wiley, Tinchy Stryder and ChipMunk having a lot of airtime. Also, more underground artists such as Ghetto are becoming more mainstream, showing a rise in the popularity of Grime.<br>  <br>  But the US is larger meaning more artists, and also has the East/West coast 'feuds' which allows artists there to 'represent' more and hav more to speak about.     <br>  <br>  Rah that was long|`|ioNTTqKfaa	In terms of mainstream music maybe the UK is better. I don't actually listen to hip hop from the UK. But here in the US we have a thriving underground. Hip hop is just as good as it always was. But most of the good stuff isn't getting played on the radio. If you are from the UK, I guess you wouldn't be up on our underground scene. We are the mecca of hip hop.|`|kW5hklQgaa	You cannot and will never be able to beat US HIP HOP<br>  <br>  <br>  PEACE|`|zYQtUuzmaa	I despise the term 'UK hip hop'. It's like they thought the english were incapable of creating a new genre so they called it that.<br>  <br>  There are a few artists from england who imitate hip hop and they are crap. But Grime artists such as JME, Wiley and such are very talented.|`|pTyAKKkfaa	I think at the moment the us hip hop scene is a tad better as they have more exposure as most new artists have the backing of big players over there.<br>  But the uk scene is slowly starting rise and become more main stream|`|AA11685726	No way.

UK hip hop is just embarrassing!!|`|QYHIVl1Naa	U.S. beat other countries in Hiphop. Asian are dope at bboying(ownage). UK got sick grafitti and Djing. other countries emcee are not that good.|`|TrPySdXFaa	r u seriously comparing????|`|vBRXR0QEaa	How can you say one is better than the other?  Like most people here i love grime from the u.k from artists like kano, wiley and roll deep.  However a lot of it comes from little chav wannabes, look at channel U.<br>  <br>  The U.S has got a greater variety of Rap legends and is the true home of hip hop creating a whole mixture of styles and genres including my favourite west coast.  Problem these days most of the american stuff is hip-pop; 50 cent and eminem included, and i think this is having bit of a negative effect on the music as they no longer seem to have the passion artists like 2-pac and biggy used to bring to game.<br>  <br>  I will be honest, loving the U.K scene at the moment, including british artists who have moved across the pond like SAS, so i can see your point about the U.K being ahead at the moment.  But lets not forget france, some of those boys can drop some mega beats, the south americans also. <br>  <br>  Either way, it all boils down to personal preference, and we should all be happy that there is huge variety out there to listen to.<br>  <br>  Thought i'd just add that Devil pup is a dick, typical stereotype of an american reject!|`|pwXcD7PIaa	I think that Oz Hip Hop reigns supreme!!!<br>  <br>  LOL really there is good stuff everywhere if you look hard enough.<br>  <br>  Agree with Klashnekoff and Foreign Beggars two of my all time faves.|`|KF9751Lyaa	US Hip-Hop IMO =]|`|QKQSoh7Qaa	yo tambien odio EUA peroo prefiero The Beatles|`|TG2jy9Niaa	hm. .i like both. .but UK (Y)|`|Jqve5UPlaa	I wouldn't ACTUALLY know because it's not my kind of music, but compare Westwood to 50 Cent right?

Xy4kHpteaa	You may want to get a little bit of training before preparing to write "the comedy ever" but perhaps you just got forgot the basics.

At the end of your first act the numbering of the scenes starts over from the beginning, so you'll have yet another scene 1.

His last three albums have been flops. Complete flops. The Album that had 'Sensual Seduction' was garbage. Snoop Dogg being the legend he is used ghost writers? Doggystyle is a classic that he himself can't top.<br>  <br>  Outkast- Spearboxxx/Love Below<br>  Even when Andre 3000 and Big Boi decide together they can't hide the fact they have been gone for too long. One of the best groups in hip hop and they just breakup. Plus this album is the most bought album in Hip Hop.<br>  <br>  50 Cent- Get Rich Or Die Tryin <br>  50 Cent will neeeeeever be able to top this album. His last two albums with g-unit and by himself were garbage. He's too into beefs than into music<br>  <br>  Eminem- Marshal Mathers LP<br>  I honestly thought that when Eminen was too do his comeback it would top this album. But his first single shows that his album is not the real Eminem.<br>  <br>  Nas-Illmatic/It was Written<br>  Nas will never top these two. Don't get me wrong he's still a sick lyricist. But his album development hasn't been on point. Plus Illmatic is too overrated for Nas to top. Nastradamus, Hip Hop is Dead, and Untitled have yet to top these. I Am was a pretty good album though.<br>  <br>  LL Cool J- Radio<br>  Is there much I can say LL Cool J isn't the rapper he used to be.|`|9wUrbqT3aa	NaS <br>  - it will impossible for him to top Illmatic.

dd7de1dd375fcb6afffc282f17c117c6aa	Moon in a water sign in the 1st house is very sensitive, and there is nothing wrong with that.  They are like sponges that can soak up other peoples' feelings very quickly; and for this reason, must be careful to take care of their own emotional well-being. What's good about this placement is that these people are kind and genuinely care about others; something the world definitely needs.|`|Ow3O7h4caa	A water sign rising makes you automatically, very sensitive, emotional and adsorbent with a need to withdraw periodically. One thing for sure. Emotions rule the head and makes you changeable in nature. The mother is usually very dominant person in your life.<br>  Moon rising gives a strong need to be appreciated by everyone you come in contact with with a great sensitivity to one's personal safety and security, physically and emotionally.<br>  You seek to care for everyone in your environment just like being everyone's nurturer. Home will be very important in your life.<br>  <br>  Depending on other aspect and the water sign rising, it can offset the paranoid part of Moon rising but not the emotions unless Saturn makes a strong aspect to the Ascendant or to Moon. Generally, you may often find yourself going through phases.<br>  <br>  Good Luck !!!!!|`|84726b724d7d1fd7da09652c50425c38aa	First house<br>  The Moon in your first house suggests that your feelings are hypersensitive and play a significant role in the definition of your personality. This is a personality that is very malleable. You make easy and quick adjustments to the demands of the moment. It's hard for you to be sure just what to do, because you are continuously in a restless state. It's also hard for you to make long-range plans because of the fluctuations in feelings. Frequent mood changes mark your personality. If you are not busy revising your goals and objectives, you are probably procrastinating and unsure about what you want to do and where you want to go. You are both sensitive and responsive to public opinion, so you are easily influenced by those around you.

YbmklSzGaa	Beautiful.<br>  <br>  Wild and crazy, yet somehow tame. Does that make sense? Surely it doesn't, but neither does this song.<br>  <br>  Around the 8:00 point I began to be reminded of Alice in Wonderland...I've always thought it was a trippy movie. Yoko's vocals are kind of a love/hate thing with me but I liked them in this song. They fit perfectly.<br>  <br>  I must buy this album.<br>  <br>  As you said, some people may get annoyed but then again not everyone can be as snobbish as us, can they?|`|9RTuRPviaa	THAT is what i was talking about when i answered your other question, about there usually being too much going on and it turning into a mess of sounds.

I also have Life With The Lions<br>  as well and have heard "The Wedding Album" really innovative experiments..|`|AA12301664	do i really need to assail my ears after that wonderfully picturesque description?|`|yjSGVfdiaa	14 minutes of soul-baring, cathartic release.  That's how I've always seen it anyway. The slowly emerging beat halfway through tends to remind me of some unreasonable beast, lumbering forward then a howling, wavering noise - its all telling an unintelligible story that you feel rather than read.<br>  <br>  Ono is the best at this sort of thing, greatly influential on the work of much of what I listen to.<br>  <br>  Great share.
Z5mmaFK0aa	That's cool Peaches, you know how I feel about post AJFA. I need not to rant about it I think I have given enough Metallica rants on here. I think its time to retrospect on my positive views about Metallica.<br>  <br>  Master Of Puppets hands down. I mean the title track has one of the most killer and crazy thrash riffs of all time. Then you have the intense and Beautiful but dark melodic interlude with the harmony solo. <br>  <br>  Then back to pounding riffage. <br>  <br>  My opinion is Master Of Puppets its also my favorite album|`|cUjcn2lsaa	Master of Puppets!|`|5HvdcWvBaa	I love Tuesday's Gone, thats my alarm so I wake up to it every morning!! Every morning, first thing I hear is "Alright, you guys ready?" :)<br>  <br>  Sorry, that was more directed at the first guy, than you.<br>  <br>  Hello Killer Peaches :)<br>  <br>  I've definitley gotta go with Master Of Puppets! It's freakin' amazing, In my opinion!! I love it!!! XD Oh damn, The Black Album is great too, though...|`|OTFzJbaMaa	i think the song the day that never comes features it really well|`|JyxNA1o0aa	I love Ride The LIghtning man! His vocals are amazing. I love Creeping Death! XD <br>  But i liked the riffs better on MOP. Like Leper Messiah! XD<br>  <br>  BA:Master Of Puppets<br>  Ba2:Ride The Lightning|`|vlIXsFmhaa	The answer to most of your questions is gonn abe AJFA because thats when they became more progressive and showed their skills. It was the style at the time|`|vK9Vv9gjaa	Apart from your other question which was ride the lighting for me I would say for james it would probably be master of puppets. <br>  <br>  Mainly because of master of puppets no matter if you like metallica or not, that song is imprinted in out brains and that is why I have chosen master of puppets.<br>  <br>  BQ: either master of puppets or battery<br>  BQ2: ride the lighting - His voice seemed alot more powerful in that album than the rest not sure why but his tone of his voice was alot higher than the rest.|`|F2ygsPEbaa	I may not be as "hardcore" or as serious a Metallica fan as many who will respond.  But I think both the guitar work, both his and Kirk Hammet's, as well as the vocals are excellent on "And Justice for All," as well as on the Black album.  To me, even though the earlier work is also stout, these two albums represent vintage Metallica.  Just my opinion.|`|u5DKcgwmaa	I would have to say the Black album for all the question. No particular song pretty much the whole album shows his world famous triplet strumming rhythm and his vocals are fantastic. When I think of how metal should be I think of that album.|`|LlC99CYqaa	Black or Ride the Lightning. They are original and they don't sound like anything else I have ever heard listening to Metallica. (:<br>  <br>  BQ- For Whom the Bell Tolls.<br>  BQ2- Ride the Lightning. :D|`|59r8mfsfaa	The black albumn <br>  i love his vocals on Tuesdays gone- song gives me chills every time i listen to it.|`|dFacbjIZaa	Master Of Puppets<br>  <br>  His singing has never been better, ever.
5uvTte8Zaa	I agree with you about Justice showcasing his talent more than any other album. Only the production left something to be desired. So, for that reason alone, I have to go with<br>  Ride The Lightning=Trapped Under Ice<br>  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=455-CIgc7co" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=455-CIgc7...</a><br>  Not only is it hard-driving through most of the song, it has just enough fills, stops, and cymbal crashes to keep it interesting.|`|u8ia6oKxaa	I actually like it best on Ride the Lightning...solid rhythms and tight as well...just poor production makes it not stand out<br>  <br>  I know AJFA is great as well, since he showcases some of his better & complex rhythms on that album...But, i remember reading that on the song "Dyers Eve" which showcases some of his faster double bass drumming that he recorded one part of it and they looped the rest....so my impression dropped abit after that.(don't even know if its 100% true...but for some reason i don't doubt it)<br>  <br>  BA: Fight Fire with Fire|`|WfUMOPyhaa	thats a hard question to answer...I really want to say Master of Puppets. i just love that album in every aspect. And you said eye of the beholder....now i have to get the album out and listen to it haha. im trying to pick a song that would be the prime example and i just dont know!|`|h1yGVkkfaa	I would also have to say ...And justice for all as Shred said he did some killer double kicks.<br>  <br>  AJFA Tracks:Shortest straw,Blackened, the whole album.<br>  <br>  But I even think DeathMag... showed that he can STILL kick some @ss.<br>  But thats just me.|`|5zwcnmOIaa	And justice for all<br>  then... ride the lightening <br>  then... master o puppets<br>  then... kill em' all<br>  <br>  favorite drum song: mop=beast|`|U48HUZ5Kaa	The album Master of Puppets show his best drumming eforts IMO.I actually think he is a good drummer but I heard that he can barely play "One" anymore.<br>  <br>  Album:Master of Puppets<br>  Track:One|`|dFacbjIZaa	I hate to say it...<br>  <br>  But "And Justice For All". The Drumming on "One" never fails to astound Me|`|Bu4n8YdEaa	And Justice for All<br>  <br>  The drums are crazy difficult.  But Ride the Lightning is pretty damn hard too.|`|kwwb62qBaa	I'm hard pressed to choose between Justice and Puppets, i love both those albums alot.|`|59r8mfsfaa	And Justice for all<br>  I love ONE|`|Z5mmaFK0aa	I would say AJFA. He did some of his most killer Double Kick work on that album.|`|dc49d60c4d19a92e193ce2f41c92cfedaa	Why I would have to agree with you<br>  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABzw3KcXV04" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABzw3KcXV...</a>|`|a79b8a93426576f5d2c9cb6a23ba338faa	Ride the Lightning.  Lars took drum lessons before recording this album.  Listen carefully -- the drumming is excellent.  The production is not that great unfortunately.<br>  <br>  BQ: Trapped Under Ice, Ride The Lightning (the title track).|`|1vCoaf08aa	Ride The Lightning, it's the best pre-Black album release.<br>  <br>  I think he's a good drummer, a little bit sloppy, but it sounds good, I think.<br>  <br>  BA: The drums on Fight Fire With Fire|`|cUjcn2lsaa	I'm going to have to agree with almost everyone else and say 'And Justice for All'.|`|AA10569146	I would agree with "And Justice For All"|`|rFBypeEfaa	Dammit KP, you stole my answer. That freight train sounding sh*t he does on Eye of the Beholder is just awesome.<br>  <br>  So yeah, I vote for And Justice For All, totally. <br>  <br>  (Now, if only they'd put any *bass* with him on that album, instead of a washed out, inaudible version of Jason being cruelly restricted to doubling James's rhythm guitar parts... oh well. Still kicks ***...)|`|OTFzJbaMaa	i think he does good drumming on all albums so i cannot chose one. but i think lars is an amazing drummer and i think in seek and destroy its apparent how great he really is. <br>  <br>  master of puppets, and wherever i roam also showcase it brilliantly|`|xJgILr5faa	As far as drummers point of view Lars hasent moved me no poloyryithums no odd time signatures that are over the edge more like out of the pocket Eye of Beholder needs alot better chorus its like slave paradiddle in last year modern Drummer warn up exercise elementary|`|k4GqiB6taa	Whats up KP?  How have you been?<br>  I really loved his drumming on his album Ride The Lightning.<br>  He did pretty awesome on the song The Call of Ktula!|`|9RTuRPviaa	I was thinking And Justice For All as well. Blackened and One were the songs that popped into my head when i read the question.|`|cIqpL3tGaa	AJFA<br>  <br>  That was one of the best c.d.s, then Master, then KEM, then|`|kqdUmjg3aa	best-and justice for all<br>  <br>  worst-st.anger|`|JyxNA1o0aa	Well...i'm not a drummer person so i can't really judge b/c i'm more of a guitar person. and pay more attention to the guitars because i have a really short attention span, but i like the drums on Ride The Lightning. But AJFA like in Dyers Eve it's all fast and stuff. XD <br>  XD
JfF7w7q3aa	Cute is What We Aim For - Safe Ride
yctQjQDTaa	Ah, Lucky you, I have to pull some all nighters this weekend and sacrifice any plans I had so I can get all the schoolwork done!<br>  <br>  But anyway, Thanks so much for asking this Lily! The Breeders are truly amazing =D<br>  <br>  BQ: Definitely "Gouge Away", well that or "Is She Weird".<br>  BQ2: Safari an Iris are definitely my favorites from the band (that's why I chose them for you :P).<br>  BQ3: Maybe a bit, did I sign? I don't remember... sure, go ahead and re-ask, its your choice :)<br>  <br>  As for Kurt, you should know that The Breeder's album "Pod" was number 3 on his top favorite albums list, and The Pixie's "Surfer Rosa" was number 2. And I dedicate this song:   <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mUu_cY8TM5Q" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mUu_cY8TM...</a>  it along with "Drag"  are my current Hole addictions, and from what I know both are about Kurt.<br>  <br>  edit*** <br>  <br>  Haha, thanks for giving credit where credit is due :P<br>  <br>  I'm always here for that kind of stuff! I'll be sure to give recommendations for later points in time, I don't want to hog it all. And I'm really happy R&P likes The Breeders! <br>  <br>  And that is an awesome dedication song :), I need to go out and get Raw Power, so far my favorite track off it is "Gimme Danger", I just thought I'd say.|`|f948d748facdf196074d849ea9c465c4aa	YES.<br>  Kim Deal kicks ***.<br>  <br>  BQ-probably Hey<br>  BQ2-Do you Love me Now?<br>  BQ3-No Idea<br>  <br>  song for Kurt Cobain-Sun of A gun-The Vaselines (he digged that band)|`|AA12301664	i always thought tanya left her best work behind her when she helped form the breeders...<br>  <br>  ba: monkey gone to heaven<br>  ba2: ditto<br>  ba3: no|`|JyxNA1o0aa	Ah this week sucked total balls. I haven't been on all week cuz i got flooded with so much goddamn english homework.<br>  <br>  I liked Iris! XD<br>  <br>  BA:I am not very familiar w/ the Pixies but ive heard good things. I'll check em out man!<br>  Ba2:I liked Iris! XD<br>  <br>  HA i remembered it was Kurt's birthday!<br>  I can't dedicate anything. i'm brain dead! XD<br>  <br>  Ba3:Nah, just leave it. I don't think anyone is going to floowe it. FFaF's already to the point of leaving cuz of some of the gomers in this section.|`|NC67WVlEaa	I love Pixies and I'm not as familiar with The Breeders but, I've heard a few of their songs, that I liked.<br>  <br>  BQ: U-Mass or Tony's Theme<br>  BQ2: Cannonball<br>  I asked a question earlier about Kurt Cobain's birthday. : )<br>  I'll dedicate Bad Moon Rising by CCR (because he was in a CCR cover band before Nirvana.)<br>  BQ3: I wouldn't know I seem to have missed something about this "pact"?|`|ZzqWzFNiaa	Great stuff. I love the Breeders. I'm in the serious minority, but I'm actually kind of glad the Pixies broke up because we ended up with two amazing projects spawning from one. Don't get me wrong, I love the Pixies, but the Breeders and Frank Black's solo stuff made it worth it for me. Just looking at the first 4 albums produced by the split. Frank Black's self titled and Teenager of the Year and Pod and Last Splash. Man. Plus, the Pixies went out on a high note. Perfect.<br>  <br>  If you're digging on the Breeders you should check out the Amps. It's basically the Breeders under a different name because Kelley Deal wasn't available to make the record. It falls between Last Splash and Title TK.<br>  <br>  Anyways, nice choice. Very good songs too.<br>  BA1: Alec Eiffel<br>  BA2: tough call. right this second I would say Fortunately Gone. A lot of competition though.<br>  Kurt Cobain... hmm... The Sad Punk (I bet he dug that tune)<br>  BA3:There's a pact?|`|b32501726d33018adfee15dc84a32f79aa	Hey, Lily!<br>  <br>  I'm a big fan of The Breeders...great clips.  I agree with Prof that the break up of the amazing Pixies did have a silver lining in the form of the music that was released individually by its members.<br>  <br>  BQ:  Tie right now between Caribou and Gouge Away.<br>  BQ2: New Year.<br>  BQ3: I must have missed the pact, but here's a Breeders song for one: I Just Wanna Get Along. (at least the title anyway :)|`|yjSGVfdiaa	The Breeders are a favorite of mine.<br>  Mountain Battles, last year, returned my faith in alternative rock.  That is a great, minimalist, lo-fi album - probably my favorite since Pod and the Safari EP.  The Deal sisters still know their way around a pop-hook.<br>  Mountain Battles and Title TK both have this interesting "unfinished" quality about them, but Mountain Battles revels in it, while I felt like Title TK was hampered by it. <br>  <br>  My dedication:<br>  Overglazed - the opening track to Mountain Battles by the Breeders.<br>  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pXqPcu8njCE" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pXqPcu8nj...</a><br>  <br>  BQ1: Dead  - at the moment<br>  <br>  BQ2: I've been listening to "German Studies" a lot<br>  <br>  BQ3: No idea what this pact is..... I've been MIA a bit lately.<br>  <br>  Edit:<br>  **prof. anger mildly states it.  The Amps came about because Kim refused to work with Kelley until she cleaned herself up (various drug issues), expecting that to give her incentive.... instead it caused a good ten year delay between Breeders albums.  Although both the Amps and the Kelley Deal 6000 put out good material in that time.|`|fcf94fd558c72875735d4fe3f1389736aa	they are pretty good from a band that i've never heard of.<br>  <br>  ma1: bone machine or where is my mind<br>  <br>  ma2: id have to go with safari<br>  <br>  ma3: of course the community regulars have changed the community.<br>  <br>  And to Kurt, "The Best Ever Death Metal Band out of Denton" by the Mountain Goats.|`|vyHe3Lfdaa	I've heard it before, I think it's good but not great<br>  <br>  BQ: Wave of Mutilation<br>  BQ2:Safari<br>  BQ3: Yes, I actually thought it was a good agreement, so everyone could stop complaining about how bad R&P has become.<br>  <br>  Oh, I almost forgot, to Kurt.<br>  Bittersweet Symphony - The Verve|`|MJwA647Waa	Rest In Peace Kurt Cobain.<br>  <br>  Anyway love the song choice!<br>  <br>  I got a song for you to listien to! =D<br>  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTs7ioZUXiU" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTs7ioZUX...</a><br>  <br>  Check it out!

Sorry about the long crazy week. Things have been crazy here too. <br>  <br>  I love The Pixies too I am actually a huge Frank Black fan as well.<br>  <br>  Thanks for sharing and have a killer weekend.|`|6LcHJbHjaa	wow i'll edit, this is a lot of question to answer<br>  <br>  The Pixies song is very good, i'm a big fan of both that song and that band, as for the breeders that's the first time i heard any of their music, but i actually quite enjoyed it.  So good choices Lily!<br>  <br>  bq: Where's My Mind?<br>  bq2: I'll say Safiri, cause like i said before that's the first song i ever heard by them<br>  bq3:  Well it didn't change me because i did little to no stuff listed in the pact, but i think it worked a little.<br>  <br>  As for my day, it was terrible my art teacher let this weird guy play all of this weird music, that was all screamo and and girl pop (and it was a boy playing the music, i know weird combo, screamo and bubble gum pop) and all the girls were going "oh great taste in music" when me and the guys were all like "turn this off"  and it was very annoying, so i'm making a playlist to bring to art class, so i don't have to listen to that **** again.  For my weekend, i'm strictly working on a history project, and i'm ordering a beatles cd off of amazon.com<br>  <br>  Boy was that a big rant, so what's going on with you Lily?|`|ab1c9b81d36c3691f0d575d773009489aa	Cool, The Breeders are great, I recently started listening to them.<br>  <br>  BA: Wave of Mutilation<br>  BA2: "Do You Love Me Now?"<br>  BA3: Maybe slightly...I don't think that many people have really followed it though.  <br>  <br>  Happy birthday Kurt!<br>  I dedicate "Seasons in the Sun" by Terry Jacks|`|YbmklSzGaa	Hello Lily. :)<br>  <br>  I've only heard some Breeders songs...but I like what I've heard so far.<br>  <br>  BA: River Euphrates<br>  BA2: Iris<br>  <br>  For Kurt: Pretty-The Raincoats.

I like him because i don't if he does it for show or not, but him and Angelina do a lot of charity work and stuff and even though he got divorced from Jennifer Aniston to be with Angie, they have been together for 2 years which is very unlikely in Hollywood.Also he seems to love kids.  And after watching 'Atonement' and 'Becoming Jane' I've fallen in love with James McAvoy. I also adore Christian Bale.  Among actresses I have only 1 favourite-Reese Witherspoon. I have seen practically most of her films and she performef great in all of them-Cruel Intentions, Legally Blonde, Sweet Home Alabama, Just like Heaven.

e4aab0d0a577ab77ab444e81ac15e46faa	1) Most shows like this get canceled because the kids grow up.  Many shows cancel as the kids get out of high school.<br>  2) Sitcoms use A LOT of the same story lines.  Of course each show has some original show because the characters may lend themselves to different situations but over the long haul, the writers run out of fresh ideas<br>  3) Because of #1 & #2, there was only so far they could go with Erkel & Laura.  It just got old|`|BJoojnQCaa	The ratings dropped.|`|df69a4790c32bf128faedaed9b8f7717aa	cuz that movie is gay!!!|`|FHLBQ62baa	cuz everyone grew up and moved away from the family.

t5NLfSmAaa	To me it sounds like a case of your typical guy that loves looking at a girl's anatomy. A lot of guys can't help but look at a girl's chest when a girl wears a low shirt like that. It's just the way guys are and we can't help it. You have nothing to worry about though. <br>  <br>  I can guarantee that the next time you talk to him face to face and you're wearin a coat that's zipped up all the way, once he notices he can't see anything he'll look at your face all the time. It's just a fact of life for us guys.<br>  <br>  And don't worry about dem grammar mistakes. If I typed like I normally speak (includin how I pronounce words with my accent), I think yahoo's "spell check" would decide to quit.|`|NBi07o6zaa	Marcia Brady his ***.|`|lwnH4Es3aa	just being a normal guy if he liked you he would have made his move when you liked him|`|omtn7gJmaa	i think he was just being a guy|`|Jii448d2aa	I think it means you were turning him on then, guys are guys, i wouldn't read to much into it, but if you do like him still GO FOR IT... life's to short to not have what you want!!!|`|OMPSzNUdaa	well, what do you think?|`|jsCjGUPuaa	guys just being guys thinking with their dick$  instead of their head. haha happens to me sometimes to its all okay|`|oVRA1ze2aa	I guess he's attracted too you lady friends in you shirt.

hZ9omSataa	George Orwell 1984|`|CmJwqeJ5aa	Green Eggs and Ham by dr seuss<br>  <br>  i am sam sam i am..and i've been hearing that for my entire life..soo it's changed my life becaus before i even read it..if my name was RebeccaJo like originally intended i wouldnt have the same encounters and excitement over my name even if i introduce myself as Samantha|`|AXAyuFW8aa	The Twilight Saga, changed the way I look at the world. Could there be immortal life upon us? Could there be vampires seeking our warm blood? It all depends on how you look at it really. <br>  <br>  The book made me feel like there was and is immortal life upon us, mortals. You may say I'm crazy, but how would we know? Vampires could be like those myths, or like the book...? So, IS there vampires? IS there were wolfs? We may never know!!!<br>  <br>  It also changed how I feel of some people. I seem to want to help, and when people are in trouble, I want to save them. It kills me when I hear of a murder. I feel like it's all my fault for some things. The books are remarkable, and I think everyone should read it to really change their life the way it did to me. It really changed me, I won't be the same. Really.<br>  <br>  It also, (yes i know ALSO), made my love stronger. Whenever I see him, my heart skips a beat. He is not a good student, not a goody boy, just I don't know. I could stare for hours without getting bored. We avoid eachother, of embarassment. If we wer'nt then, we would never be seperated. The book is really remarkable. I will never read anything like it again.|`|16rD9k32aa	Yes. S.E. Hinton's The Outsiders. It was like it shined a light into my soul. I so felt like a character out of that book. And no, not necessarily Ponyboy either.|`|oVRA1ze2aa	Little Girl Lost <br>  that book opened my eyes about what a african american teen girl went through in the South in Louisiana in the 1950's. An how her mom sold her too  a white insurance man  .So that insurance man could have sex with a 15 years old girl. It's sad and disgusting at how this white man had no moral feelings that it was wrong for him too have sex with a 15 year old and how trifling her  mom was.|`|IlNDHC3raa	No no. Can't say I have.|`|H9gmJYdmaa	'The Hungry, Hungry Caterpillar' made me quit my destructive ways and made me think outside the box.|`|2k8TEiRtaa	Do the books we read at school count ?

Invisible Monsters by Chuck Palahniuk. I don't know why that book affected me, but it did. I think it has a deeper meaning that only a few people really get out of it.<br>  <br>  I also forgot about Guns, Germs, and Steel by Jared Diamond. That book won the Pulitzer Prize and kind of disproved racism/race supremacy. I think everyone should read it. It's not an easy read. It's a work of nonfiction about the last 13,000 years of human history. You'll be a smarter person once you finish I guarantee it.|`|VUHmc6ooaa	yes its called The Sacrifice by Kathleen Benner Duble. its about the 1600s and a girl and who people thought was a witch and alot of other people were thought to be witches too when they werent. it got me thinking what life was like back then and what it would be like for people to think ur a witch.|`|zGFiWSPtaa	yes, it was something like the story of a young soldier or something, but it was really sad and true and opened my eyes. It's about this kid in sierra leone who had to kill people and smoked pot and stuff as a kid, because he lived in a war so he grew up with death and bad things all around him and thought it was normal.|`|SA2PGI3Qaa	Twilight did, and your all probally thinking "Stupid teen girl" haha but yeh<br>  It changed my own perspective on alot of things, life for one.

Try layers/angles in the back and front. You could try full bangs or side bangs.

(Braiding part of you hair bun)  Just mix it up so you wont get bored.|`|zGFiWSPtaa	Maybe straight bangs, shoulderlength hair, layers or dye it a normal but cute color??  or start wearing your hair different, pin your bangs back, do a side ponytail, if braids look cute on you but not like a little kid, try those, go really wavy, or straight or curly.

wdxUb3moaa	Agreed...Both are great but I like the drama and the guys are alot better looking in Vampire Knight! So Vampire Knight :)    me     ~(^..^)|`|POXOqhOYaa	Hey Rosaga U. :)    I wouldn't say one is better then the other. There are lots of differences of course but the art style is the biggest difference so it's nothing much to worry about. My personal favorite would have to be Vampire Knight, but it's a shojo/ girl's based anime and Hellsing is a Shonen/boy's based anime but all in all it makes no difference, you like what you like. Right?    Anyway here's a little information on the plot for each anime for you.    ?Hellsing:  Hellsing centers around the Holy Order of Protestant Knights, led by the latest member of the bloodline of Abraham Van Helsing. Their mission is to protect Queen and Country from the undead and other supernatural forces of evil. The organization is run by Sir Integra Fairbrook Wingates Hellsing, who inherited her responsibility as its director after the death of her father in her early teenage years. She is served by her faithful family butler and former Hellsing "trashman," Walter C. Dornez, and Alucard, a powerful vampire that was captured by the family a hundred years ago and serves as the organization's current "trashman." They are later joined by former police officer Seras Victoria, who becomes a Hellsing soldier when she is turned into a vampire by Alucard.  After an attack on Hellsing's headquarters, Sir Integra hires the Wild Geese mercenary group to replace the men who are lost in battle. The leader of the group is Captain Pip Bernadotte, a womanizing Frenchman. He is known for his habit of constantly teasing Seras Victoria.    ?Vampire Knight:  Yuki Cross's earliest memory is of a snowy night in winter, when she was attacked by one vampire and was saved by another, Kaname Kuran.Yuki is the adopted daughter of the Headmaster of Cross Academy, Cross Kaien and has grown up and become a prefect for the school with one main purpose: for vampires to coexist peacefully with humans . Her fellow guardian, Zero Kiryu, a childhood companion whose parents were killed by a pure-blood vampire, is now determined to kill them all and refuses to trust them. Through a cruel twist of fate, Zero becomes a vampire himself, having been bitten by pure-blood vampire, Shizuka Hio, four years before. Now Yuki must help him fight his curse, as well as recover the lost memories of her past. She must also discover why Kaname, who leads the group of Night class (all of which are also vampires) at Cross Academy as their President, saved her that night and what deep dark secret he is keeping from her.    And you can watch them here for free, in high quality on Rawranime.com, I always use this site and I highly recommend it because it's very organized with a wide selection of shows.    ?Vampire Knight:  http://www.rawranime.com/category/28/    ?Vampire Knight Guilty (Second season of Vampire Knight):  http://www.rawranime.com/category/700/    ?Hellsing:  http://www.rawranime.com/category/123/    ?Hellsing Ultimate (Second season of Hellsing):  http://www.rawranime.com/category/125/    I hope I helped you out and have a good day!     Later.|`|zMgDqZjkaa	both are good|`|p824592Baa	i like them both, but i prefer Vampire Knight, I'm not sure why, i just do... :)|`|TQYof9Whaa	Hellsing, i'm not a big fan of vampire knight|`|7a2efb9a491bf91f2d2a622649572fdfaa	well you see hellsing and vampire knight are too very diffrent types of anime.  hellsing is mainly action based and yes its awesome and i highly recommend watching as alucard is probobally one of the coolest characters ever!  vampire knight is also quiet good but is more of a romance/drama with a very interesting setting.  so i say you should watch both cuz they are so diffrent and both fantastic...of course personally hellsing is my favourite!
L7VHDIsWaa	"It's Always Sunny In Philadelphia at STK on September 10, 2008 in Los Angeles ...
e0338b9bb1dd97eb01a44cc65f8d7e7aaa	we will never know<br>  sorry  to tell u this<br>  even in the comics u are never told|`|MMTIJPJxaa	They don't tell you.  They kept Joker alive for a sequel and were probably going to tell it in that movie, but Heath Ledger died so we will never know...|`|Ybro1x2aaa	no one knows, thats the point, it makes him mysterious.|`|uFXote5Paa	Didnt his dad do it or something?<br>  I remember someone was abusive.<br>  <br>  IDK, its bugging me now.|`|NH0rB0twaa	i dont know if there is one,<br>  but he talks about his mom<br>  during his games i think so<br>  maybe his mom?
Hzf3QK9faa	His uncle is Francis Ford Coppola, the family is in the business=nepotism.|`|SEzMrFrbaa	there are so many"terrible"actors out there.nick cage is cool!<br>  sylvester stallone,ashton kutcher,kevin costner,demi moore,<br>  mily cyrus,jessica alba,zac efron,kurt russel,tom cruise etc|`|dpSTgytfaa	because he's a great actor and you've probably never seen half his movies<br>  DUH|`|56bNLJykaa	He was good in Adaptation.. But yes, that's really all I liked him in.|`|y5kXh0QEaa	I'm a fan of Cage, but let's face it, his well-known recent movies have been pretty bad.  However, he did win the Academy Award for Best Actor in 1995 for Leaving Las Vegas, and he was nominated for the same award in 2002 for Adaptation, which I thought he should have won.|`|yE8Or4yAaa	Hes a cult actor, he is good to some and terrible to others. Take Bruce Campbell for instance, loved by billions, hated by millions. Personally I think he's excellent. Loved Lord of War. He just has a habit of taking bad roles, or roles he cannot truly portray, like Ghostrider.<br>  <br>  Oh and anyone who really thinks he doesn't have talent needs to watch Leaving Las Vegas, that will shut you up, if it doesn't then you have no idea what being a good actor means.|`|b2588303cd0bf17f0993891608852540aa	I keep wondering that myself.  He is not good looking at all, and is a really horrible actor.  The only two movies I have enjoyed of his (and yes I've seen all or most of them) was The Rock and Con Air.  His most recent ones were total trash.|`|AA11110732	He's not a terrible actor, he just picks terrible movies.|`|YsQQ30YJaa	He has family "connections".|`|0eorp2Hhaa	they probably needed an ugly actor|`|ClQoSrMmaa	dude your a lose, he's a great actor, at least 100X better than you'll ever be.|`|yqe0I5zpaa	He is a terrible actor, he truly is. The only reason he got into Hollywood in the first place is that he is a Coppola.|`|NQ3eETlYaa	He has an uncle who has connections for him. I think that many of his movies suck, as well as his acting, but some are sort of interesting, as well as his acting.
d13c4c2bb60f93e106a5ef936fc63dc9aa	So what???? he probably had one try humping his leg or something when he was a kid. Scarred him for life.|`|EdRzMi0Taa	it depends if you saw him all the sudden being afraid, if you like him, if you're on a date with him, or whatever. the closer you are, the weirder it should be, but the quicker you have to forget about it.|`|J7k4xJtoaa	well my ex was a 6'4 biker-type of guy who was scared of spiders and had his 5' tall girlfriend kill them for him, so I would think that is normal|`|F3KkB4GWaa	It would be funny and quirky. Pretty intriguing...|`|pkHh5Uj7aa	everyone is afraid of something|`|dGpj4WOIaa	two words.<br>  epic.fail|`|MtVxBOZXaa	die laughing and then leave... lmao|`|QczEdd5qaa	try to help the guy|`|cuqP79Foaa	haha that gave me a picture in my head. lol :)|`|dPULl5hjaa	wimpy man|`|Qz3sii2caa	Aw that's cute.|`|a4LWildhaa	No big deal to me, many people are afraid of dogs. Personally, clowns freak me out.|`|KAkiPY3kaa	Go buy a poodle for entertainment value|`|OgkGsCkvaa	I would lock him in a pet store.|`|hZ9omSataa	buy a poodle|`|vVTmJjJDaa	no differently than i'd react if a 6' 9" basketball coach were afraid of mice (the dude screamed like a little girl! - it was hysterical).|`|RpxKmUBUaa	I would give him a hug, paint his toenails, and read Twilight to him til he fell peacefully to sleep....then, PILLOWFIGHT!!!!!|`|3AAHmvKFaa	Wouldn't bother me. I wouldn't say anything either.|`|f0JL2cHEaa	Everyone has their phobias.|`|tvdabilNaa	I would think I met my doppelganger.|`|Wi9nmYIEaa	with derision : )|`|72oUAXWTaa	laff in his face and make a point of bringing up poodles|`|WHN5cuGZaa	i would kill then eat him

oN519wDmaa	The reason you have a bridge pick up ,,is to enhance the Lower frequencies <br>  <br>  If you all you have is a front pickup ,,you will get a tinny Sound you need that Bottom end ,,,<br>  <br>  Saying the Bridge Pickups sound like Country is like saying you don't want a Drummer in ;your band because you music will sound like Crap I mean Rap ( O ya rap is short for Crap)
3rL8vh1Uaa	i haven't heard anythink from max but i now the chelsea didn't get cut she quit. also tony is being cut too|`|iPoWzRSVaa	Chloe because there no Point 4 her to be there now because her and lucas r done and i thk sami should leave she a bad actress|`|rabjcdjHaa	I read in Soap Opera Digest that Patch, Kayla and Tony have been cut and Rachel Melvin, the actress that plays Chelsea, decided not to renew her contract, so she is leaving Days!|`|JtcWfQ1uaa	Seems like some1 is always leaving salem but Lucas has left b4 and come back max, kayla dn steve too. but I think that once they do this they need to coinsider givig the boot to melanie, nicole(hope ej chokes her cuz i dont like her) and chole and daniel why dont they all leave?!?!|`|EioOPbzbaa	Sadly Patch and Kayla got a sorry send off and were fired, Tony is also gone.  Chelsea decided not to renew, reason not clear but the door was left open for her to return.  I thought Lucas and Max were left alone for now but it changes daily.  They must be getting these new characters dirt cheap or almost for free.  I agree, why not Melanie or Chloe, or Nicole - wouldn't be missed.|`|WJW4qOlUaa	Yep Patch and Kayla have been cut I am not sure about Max or Lucas. They also cut Tony D. They keep cutting people but they still bringing other people on! I sure will miss Patch and Kayla and Max and Lucas if that r cut too<br>  <br>  Kayla and Patch last day was just a few days ago they could have given them a better goodbye off the show!<br>  Days will be gone down hill for sure!|`|P0Fjh59Eaa	It's all gone to shyt!

ENkFZhlraa	That is so not real. Jeez, people will believe anything.<br>  <br>  Havnt any of you heard of freakin photoshop?|`|7b0903c0e39a55a5230350128e4fcff1aa	I believe it is. It really looks like her facial features.|`|xFVjLpdYaa	Yes, she was beat up by Chris Brown for the millionth time! How many times do we have to explain?|`|Fyt9JxTqaa	Yes.  :(|`|BILIAKSOaa	Yeah it is. It's all over the internet. I feel really bad for her and can't believe Chris would do that. I mean, you don't think he would. She has so many cuts and bruises. I hope she is okay.|`|k39bNUgeaa	yeah it is|`|LSxBwiFSaa	Isn't it amazing how Different beat up people look- without any Makeup on ?!  :0|`|TFZZ2E0Gaa	Yes,I am pretty sure it is her. It looks like it.|`|80A6iHoGaa	yes|`|Xg8Tzjfraa	Yeah, that's her.  But how can anyone feel sorry for her when she has refused to leave him and is "still in love with him?"<br>  <br>  I'm sorry, Chris Brown is a prick, but Rihanna no longer has my sympathy.|`|3lF21cFkaa	yep its real.|`|AA10652430	Yup, real as the day is long.|`|4QfyirQjaa	Yes it is D:|`|DKfScL8taa	YES|`|QruXkDncaa	yes, if you notice the tattoo on her shoulder area in that picture.<br>  Then look at this one,<br>  <a href="http://img242.imageshack.us/img242/6457/rihanna2au5.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://img242.imageshack.us/img242/6457/...</a><br>  <br>  You know it's actually her.|`|J7k4xJtoaa	yes it is,,, swollen|`|LSMrAfzYaa	Apparently so. It doesn't look like Rihanna despite having a battered face. I can't see the similarity with that picture and Rihanna.|`|n8Db77zbaa	Yes, people say "No, its not" My dad is a Doctor in the E.R. of Cedar Sinai Medical Center in Beverly Hills, and thats exactly how he described her as, to the tee.|`|IcPPQXqQaa	yes it's really her|`|vm5TgsQwaa	Ya.. poor thing<br>  It's going to be on TMZ (the show) tonight|`|MuzqSYjwaa	yes, that's how a real boyfriend show his love.|`|euTcjyusaa	get over it|`|cIYD9YqGaa	yea chris did that to her :[ <a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;_ylt=AmnzYswI5SYhpui0dXjjCsjsy6IX;_ylv=3?qid=20090219154924AAOt1mT">http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;...</a>|`|ev1cG1tFaa	Oh my gosh, that's the first time I've seen that. And that I definitely Rhianna.|`|7ldEn0fJaa	yes i think it is|`|w8AyVsjRaa	I'm not sure It might be even though I can't imagine how that sight got access to that photo because I think it would have been private. I'm guessing it is real and it was after Chris Brown beat her|`|YWwtiIgTaa	Yes that really is rihanna, and I agree, Chris Brown is a womanizer.|`|cWmx0J4jaa	yup, and I hear Chris will simply get felony battery against her. Probation probably.|`|XsBmpKdeaa	Ya that's her.. poor thing! They should not have released this picture!!! That is SO not cool!|`|5LGIrOjVaa	Yessssssssss|`|1QbGaZWgaa	No this is not rihanna. No pictures have surfaced the internet yet. No one knows exactly what she looks like and exactly what happened.<br>  The only pictures that are on edited ones and fake ones.<br>  I really hope no pictures do appear because it is just so sad and that would just be cruel to post them around.<br>  <br>  But as of right now, no that is not rihanna. i'm sorry.|`|sFG5f1G9aa	Yes unfortunately its her. How could chris brown do that 2 her when they were looking 2 buy a house together and leeds up to maybe marriage. he is such a JERK!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! She gave him everything, but he did give her something in return.... a knuckle sandwich!!!!!!! i feel sssooo bad for that poor thing sitting their wondering"Why Me?" i have read her pain. I hope she kicks his butt in return just not as bad as he did 2 her!!!!!!!!!!!!!|`|XCG6ejG5aa	Ya I think.|`|JqF7Swwjaa	yeah, it is a leaked photo, it was supposed to be released, i stook up for that fool before i saw what he did!!! just last year on tyra he talked of how he felt about domestic violence!-dude yeah right...or maybe it was just a god intended event, time will tell|`|Toqu9lTqaa	Yup, that's really her.<br>  You can tell by the ear piercing and the tattoo on her shoulder.<br>  Also after the picture was shown on tv,she released a statement about it.<br>  Chris Brown should be charged.|`|ZDasr4uUaa	yup it sure is her.<br>  chris brown is crazy!<br>  poor rihanna|`|Zbjr11aSaa	yes now i hate chris brown|`|cDuiMcgOaa	yes it is her|`|cuqP79Foaa	i know... @ the moment i hate chris brown!|`|rkeLJ8RAaa	its soooo sad|`|04cb17cc7c7b19d7e182c1f6dad2782eaa	yea! it's definetly her! and it's quite sad but why is everyone blaming it on chris brown?  like we don't have any reason to believe that he was the one who did it (or atleast none that i am aware of)!|`|c3MTOshNaa	i didnt think that was her.<br>  but then i looked up her in photobucket.<br>  and sure enough she has that same tattoo..<br>  either thats her..<br>  or whoever made that went through a lot of trouble to make it look exactly like her..|`|gd98RjzXaa	GOOD rihanna deserves a beating anyway.<br>  <br>  I know i'm being harsh but i simply cant stand her.<br>  <br>  xx|`|zi9qUPJvaa	yeah isnt that so terrible?|`|YF3keXdMaa	Yes It Is, If you see in the photo the tatoo on the girls shoulder is the same one rihanna has so it must be her.|`|JlraGyvTaa	That definitely looks like her.<br>  Although, I just can't imagine a hot, rich, celebrity like Chris Brown doing such a thing...|`|xVL55MGjaa	yea it is even though it was probably photoshopped to make it look worse then it is|`|qCIGL7Whaa	Nope. Her nose is too big to be Rihanna. GAL!!!!!!(Get A Life!!!!!!)|`|m8wMKhOoaa	yeap its her<br>  i cant believe chris brown did that to her<br>  i wanna just, kill him now....

The brothers suffer horrible damages to themselves during this, and afterward dedicate their lives to searching for the mythical 'Philosopher's Stone' (think Sorcerer's Stone, Harry Potter fans) which they believe will help them restore what they have lost. It's a very complex and moving story, alternating between touching, hilarious, tragic and downright horrific. Definitely a must.<br>  <br>  I hope that helps!<br>  <br>  ~Jen|`|PbXytOHhaa	For summaries and links to free streamed episodes see the link below.<br>  <br>  Death Note - It is a psychological thriller that questions morals.

GU4riUpSaa	This one is not just a versatile album .The opening number 'Ringa Ringa' which is based on the the rhythm of 'Choli Ke Peeche Kya Hai'. Set in a brothel, 'Ringa Ringa' hardly leaves anything to imagination and one wonders that if not for an A-grade project set-up as that of Slumdog Millionaire, the song would possibly have not gone beyond the censors.  'Jai Ho' is the flagship number of Slumdog Millionaire and Subhash Ghai may certainly have been cursing his luck that he allowed this superb track from Yuvvraaj to be handed over to Slumdog Millionaire after he felt that it didn't suit the mood of his own film. Boasting of an amazing mix of melody and rhythm, 'Jai Ho' remains Indian at heart and is instantly catchy. No wonder, it is the lone promotional song of the film and also sees a music video being dedicated to it. Gulzar saab celebrates the spirit of love and life with 'Jai Ho' and infuses enough power in it that justifies all the nominations it is receiving today. Its a piece that mix the Indian and Western classical branch of music   Same is the case with 'Liquid Dance' which lasts for three minutes and has unpredictability written all over it. Yet another exciting piece that makes you check out the film to know how exactly is it placed in the film.    What makes for one of the most beautiful theme pieces in Slumdog Millionaire is that of the leading lady Latika though. Titled 'Latika's Theme', one wants this piece to go on for longer than it's three minute duration due to the lively manner in which it unfolds. From being lively, the mood shifts to that of euphoric with the track 'Millionaire' coming next. With a hint of 'Jai Ho' to it, it is a club track that you could play out loud and jive along with all the fancy lights surrounding you.    'Gangsta Blues' is a haunting yet intriguing number that reminds one of the soundtrack of lesser known film Snip which was made close to a decade back. However, though not much is remembered of Snip today, Rahman ensures that his 'Gangsta Blues' would be identified well by those who have been exposed to this genre of music. The concluding track 'Dreams On Fire' is a soft and sensitive number and Rahman shows once again that why he is a preferred choice for many international filmmakers.  All together Rahman has done a wonderful job as he always do.

ADBMrG87aa	Sam broke up with Lucky; Sam just beat Lucky to the punch because Sam saw Lucky by Liz's bedside during the biotoxin outbreak and overheard them talking to each other and Sam realized that Lucky truly is in love with Liz and then to top it all off; Lucky left with Liz and didn't even look back or think twice as to the whereabouts or welfare of Sam who was still fighting for her life to survive Trevor's attack and then the raging fire in the hospital.  It turned out that Jason was the one left to save Sam which he did.  Jason also saw Liz and Lucky talking in the hospital and he too realized that Lucky and Liz are in love with each other.<br>  Jason and Sam hopefully will reunite as a couple in the future but I doubt it will happen anytime too soon since Jason is not one to forget a betrayal so great as that of Sam standing by and watching Jason's kid being stolen.|`|GrE1UM2Saa	He didn't want the same things she wanted and it's about time.  I mean their relationship started out w/trying to get back Elizabeth and Jason for sleeping together and loving each other and not them.

They still care about each other but their not in love anymore.|`|msUIsv8maa	Because Sam see;s for herself Lucky still loves Liz he was by her side in the Hospital & Sam caught them Kissing.I dont blame her i would have broke off too..|`|NGNeT3rYaa	Lucky got upset that she kept putting herself in danger. it is kinda a mutual thing but more so on Lucky I guess.

I also have Mars in my first house and Mars is very strong in my chart.

bW0mPPuTaa	It's called "Let Them Eat Pie".  Michael has a piece of lemon meringue "half-time pie".  He had been teaching the kids about sticking together and when he dozes off during the football game, knowing he's going to have his half-time pie, Junior dares Claire to eat the half time pie and she does and none of the kids tell on her.  It's hilarious when Michael wakes up and accuses Jay of eating his half time pie and the kids won't fess up so he buys dozens of pies and that's all he lets them eat until one confesses. Breakfast, lunch and dinner.  They think it's great at first but then they get sick, really sick of pie.  Finally, unable to take any more pie, Claire fesses up and, of course, at the end of the episode is a huge pie fight.  It's my all time fav episode.|`|31TUT9lpaa	I LOVE ALL OF THEM.<br>  I just saw the episode when Michael recorded over katies first steps. I ROTMFFLOL when junior was watching the footage and he was like that not me then Franklin (pretending to be Jr.) said I'm Jr and i'm an idiot. Jr. responded Yeah that's me right there! <br>  <br>  Classic!|`|PO4Yjnfhaa	Bones!!|`|UgvLTFmSaa	I like all the episodes, but i really liked when he took the batteries out of katies doll and said the baby had to die so we could see, cuz they lost power. And i like when he bugs claire as well.|`|AA11404443	That was a funny episode, his hair was so gross growing in all patchy and crazy.

Is he really going to rap? LOL He should stick to the sinister movie characters.|`|Hzf3QK9faa	Is it a publicity stunt (someone he knows is supposedly taping him as he goes down hill), is he burnt out, is he just being a normal person instead of a perfect little hollywood pkg.

tvtZV32oaa	I'm a cancer.<br>  We are the mother of the solar system, meaning we want big families and are really into our homes.  We love to cook, and we love buying new furniture and stuff for the home.  We prefer to stay at home with a few friends then go out.  We are really good at reading facial expressions, and our faces are very expressive.  We are talkative and outgoing when it comes to being around people we are comfortable with, and shy when we are uncomfortable.  We are shy when it comes around to the people we like, for instance, we can't make the first move because we are afraid of rejection.  We are very smart, and we make most of our friends at first because they want to learn something from us.  We are one of the moody signs, and we are extremely emotional.  We are good with money, and know how to invest our money wisely.  We are ruled by the moon.  We get along most with Pisces and Scorpio, or the other water signs.  We enjoy the beach very much, and it is our favorite place to be (anywhere near water).  We are extremely kind, and are great listeners, we empathize with those who tell us their problems, and we are extremely giving.  If we fall for someone, we fall pretty hard.  We notice all the details, and interpret body language pretty well.  With understanding facial expressions and interpreting body languages, we can pretty much understand what every ones feeling or thinking.  People feel like they can tell us anything because we are understanding and smart, we are really good at keeping secrets, and we make people feel important when we talk to them (or like their situation matters dearly to us).  We are extremely enthusiastic, and our main form of humor is sarcasm.  We are really relyable and loyal to our friends, or to anyone who is loyal to us.  We tend to over analyze things, or get carried away with things, and we tend to procrastinate.|`|mNWgzQDOaa	"Crabs live in the inter-tidal zone of the oceans, where tides rise and fall twice every day. This is the most dynamic and changeful place on earth, but also the most nutrient rich. Because of the constant change, Cancer have developed a hard outer shell for protection. Cancer can use the hard outer shell of your home as your protection. But it's more than just that. Typically, your sensitive Cancer can hold your feelings quietly behind your own walls. <br>  <br>  Crabs also have large pinching claws, and Cancer can hold onto things, especially from the past. Cancer are fiercely loyal and have a difficult time letting go. But Cancer are also quick to bring those you love inside the safety of your outer shell while you nurture them. Cancer love is protective, but unless tempered, can be smothering. <br>  <br>  Cancer motto could be, "A good defense is the best offense." Like a Crab in its cave, your attack can consist of baiting your opponent into your territory. What appears to be a retreat to others can be your best aggressive tactic. As you feel your way through life, building your security by developing your home and family relationships, remember that unexpressed anger can turn into resentment and depression, so find someone you can trust and share your feelings. <br>  <br>  Element: Water<br>  Astrologically, the water element symbolizes emotion. Water runs deep; it seeks its own level and will flow until it has found it. The cycle of water is endless with the snows falling in the mountains and melting. The mountain streams join to make the great rivers that run to the sea. The tides and currents churn the oceans. Similarly, our feelings are flowing as they connect the present with past experiences. Sometimes the waters are so deep that we cannot put words to our feelings. <br>  <br>  The water of Cancer is that of the changing tides. Regular rhythms that bring food and nurture the creatures who live there. But this is also about the water of a smoothly surfaced lake. No movement is apparent, yet beneath the surface there is movement, currents and much hidden activity. <br>  <br>  Fourth House: Home and Family<br>  The Fourth House is related to the mother. It is where we are nurtured, and takes in not only our real mother, but all those who nurture us -- especially early in life. This is the house of childhood surroundings. It is where we retreat from the noise of the outer world. <br>  <br>  Key Planet: Moon<br>  The Moon is always changing, not even the same two nights in a row. It races around the Earth once a "month," and as such we are familiar with her regularly repeating patterns. Women's menstrual cycles are naturally tied to the lunar rhythm, putting them in closer touch with the subconscious realms of the Moon. But to man and woman alike, the Moon is the key to our feelings and our emotional cycles. As the key planet of Cancer, the Moon symbolizes our basic needs -- how we need to be nurtured and how we nurture others. <br>  <br>  Cancer Greatest Strength: Your ability to nurture others <br>  <br>  Cancer Possible Weakness: Fear of the past repeating in the future "|`|2CYfjPA6aa	sensitive, and moody. kind hearted|`|3CXfqxcgaa	They prefer to stay at home,emotional,don't like to see people hurt.

t2evcVVEaa	well for one. it sounds like youre over analyzing the genre. which, if you stopped, would also help your mom. it all falls under the umbrella of rock and roll. stop calling it screamo. to parents that can have a negative effect. and just like my dad learned the hard way, your mom can learn the hard way that with cd burning technology, theres no way she is ever going to stop you from listeningwhat you want to listen to. if it has explicit language then your mom has every right to say she doesnt want you listening to it. in fact, she would be a bad bparent if she didnt say anything about it. just tell her its rock and roll. plain and simple. death core comes from the terms metal core and death metal coming together to form one genre. death core is a type of screamo, screamo is a type of emo, emo is a type of pop rock, pop rock is a type of alternative rock, alternative rock is a type of rock and roll. plain and simple. hope this helped. : )|`|AfbjU9Guaa	Your mum sounds like a miserable old cow, I hate and despise people like that.

MXIU89J3aa	Well anyone can sing good with practice and detication. Keep practicing and you'll get better. You just have to work on your vocal range and vibrato. Do you know what vibrato is? It's the vibrations that your voice makes when singing.  They have to be even and in touch with the beat that the song carries. Practice takes care of that though. Vocal range is hard to prefect but once again practice helps. Other than that you have a very nice voice. Singing lessons are huge helps if you aren't satisfied.  They're fun too.|`|magJQL3Baa	You're not really good or really bad (well better than me!) but I think you can do better.

It'll won't even change the way your voice sounds. Your voice is your voice and your stuck with it for life. Take vocal lessons and the vocal teacher will give you their honest opinion about your voice. For me, I need to hear you more clearly and I didn't like that voice thingy that always came up...lol|`|PeuFnqQwaa	I hate to be harsh, but I believe in giving you an honest answer. If you were trying out for American Idol.... You would not make the cut. If you really enjoy singing and want to get really good, I would recommend taking voice lessons from a qualified instructor. It will make a HUGE difference.

mquRob1faa	My wish would be for me to be one of those huge disney stars, move my family out to california, buy a nice house for my mom, and to make lots of money so i could help my mom pay off legal bills from my dad ruining our lives. Although, i guess thats two wishes. fame and money. I'd have to say just the money.<br>  <br>  I know its shallow to wish for money, but it would really help. My family is struggling because my dad is driving us broke. Hes trying to get custody of me and my sister. I hate him, but the courts make it so easy for the kid's wishes to be tossed aside. So we could just may him off, move across the country, and live in peace. I wouldnt have to worry about saving $5 for a week of lunches, and i could shop without worrying about everything i spend. <br>  <br>  My wish for the world would be to end murder. I think people should't have to worry about sleeping at night. They should be able to fall asleep feeling safe. Its horrible how people can hurt other people. <br>  <br>  But freedom is also important to me. <br>  See, i dont think abortion is murder, and i think women should have the right to decide what to do with their bodies. I DO thing its bad, and you should try to avoid it, but women need to have that option. <br>  Like, rape babies for example. If i got pregnant after being raped, i couldnt stand to have that baby in the world. i dont know what it would do, what it would be capable of. But if you use it as birth control, its just horrible. <br>  <br>  There are so many things to choose, but overall my wish for me would be for my mother to win the lottery (the most money ever awarded)<br>  my wish for the world would be to end murder. All killing of already born people.|`|4z1gryIGaa	One for myself..I could go back in time and say all the things I wish I had said to my father(I loved him, hugged him..etc) he passed away 13 years ago.<br>  <br>  World: That we could move past this race thing whenever something comes up,and for all of us to start taking resonsibility for our own actions/choices instead of blaming others for our problems.|`|qc7zP89jaa	1.)

luQ1N9rSaa	No not really.<br>  <br>  I wish that I had a working time machine so I could go back to other times and see what they were like. In particular the 1960s, but loads of times could be cool to see what they were like.<br>  <br>  But I wouldn't have liked to have been born during a different time, I wouldn't like to have lived there permanently (well at least I don't think I would have.)<br>  <br>  For example, in the 1800's cos of the high infant mortality rate and stuff.  <br>  <br>  If I had a time machine then I could go back in time and stay there for as long or as little time as I wanted to.|`|6XRJT6Xbaa	I think i would miss the internet way too much...but the 20's look pretty cool|`|SYPeab1Raa	I do.  It would be nice not to just be confined to a small area of space your whole life.  To be able to travel the world, and migrate, without getting a visa, or showing passports, or only being allowed to stay for a certain amount of time.  Sometimes I feel  trapped.   And I live in a big a## country to.  The world was so much bigger then.<br>  <br>    I like the world now though to.|`|tGLAXkxLaa	no i love electronics<br>  i would bite my own foot off if i had to drive 4 1/2 hours anywhere ( like i just did today) and not have my ipod, phone, radio, etc to play w/|`|OMPSzNUdaa	yea, i tottaly would wanna go to like the late 1800s during all the scandels and pirates, but i think id wanna do it in a couple of years,,, i dont think id have fun at 14... but only for a couple of days not for ever. no is so much better. [:|`|GygXGGZnaa	Well, yeah. I would go back to the 1800s because everyone had a horse. I would only wish that if i was able to go back to 2009.|`|IzzqBIVUaa	Not really. I am happy with the time period I was born in. Though it would be fun to be born during the reign of queen Cleopatra.|`|5oBYGB5Vaa	Any time from 1850 back to the 1st American settlements. Back then, no one was concerning themselves w/ running your life for you. There was no legislation of morality. ~:)>|`|4z1gryIGaa	Yes! I wish I was born during the early 1900's to around the 50 or 60's seem(without the racial part of it) but it seems like those were simpler times.|`|IHDVQs3kaa	Definitely not.|`|mIPX1dLOaa	1960's|`|65zKevOvaa	not anymore|`|93Pmc3N1aa	Hell no, I love the internet. I couldn't live without it.|`|AApetKofaa	nah the future is better|`|DbVGKvcTaa	No but I think it would be cool to be un-born sometimes.<br>  <br>  (I was an accident)|`|AA12148387	Yes 70's That would be cool.|`|NAy7lfxkaa	yep. If I was born 40 years earlier in '51 I'd be 18 in the hippie music era :]|`|6ZtoLkfPaa	i wish i was born on valentines day so if i didnt have a boyfriend (like this year) i could party with my friends anyways. it makes everyday fun, lol.|`|rEUkRu6Maa	During English I think i was born in the wrong time, but I don't really wish I was...|`|PlAS9jJSaa	Sometimes I think it would be really cool to be born in the late 40's (once the war was over) so that I could grow up during the golden age of Hollywood.|`|zkcOEU7jaa	YES EVERY SINGLE DAY I ALWAYS TELL MY MOM HOW MAD I AM AT HER FOR GIVING BIRTH TO ME IN THE WRONG DECADE! I ALWAYS CALL HER UP AND GO ON AND ON ABOUT IT! and i thought I was the only one to think that.|`|hZ9omSataa	nope, they didn't have meds back then, when you got sick you had to feel like crap, and no toilet...so if you got the craps, than you had no pepto and had to go to some outhouse....no Ibuprofen and Benadryl for hangovers...|`|sVFkMVujaa	i was born in 1951, and have the aches and pains to prove it.  i'm ok like i am, i guess.|`|ff8f1f5e6ae77b2318640fce7787a746aa	Yes, but I was born in 1948 which seems like eons ago?|`|LDSL0DUiaa	Nah|`|M4PMGw2Zaa	Yes! I also want to go to different places. I always thought that it'd be interesting to meet English royalty from the 1500s, or American soldiers from the 1700s, etc. The 40s, the 60s, the 80s...|`|CRuxWsi0aa	Yeah. I kind of wish I was born in 1982 so I'd have memories of the 80s but not actually have to participate. Then I'd be around for the good 90s music.|`|xYLnLCVVaa	not the 1800's, but definitely sometime between the 20's and 60's.|`|O0VQqIkDaa	sometimes I wish that, yes.|`|wYTDwWnEaa	During the 70's. Great music and fun clothes. haha|`|oVRA1ze2aa	not really|`|qyZhzCJTaa	yeah that would so awesome.|`|uF8RLL4laa	i really wanna live in paris or london in the 60s

Fg5C35m5aa	It's hard to contain to one genre, but Slipknot are metal. The songs you've heard would probably be stuff like Before I Forget, Duality, Spit It Out, Dead Memories, Heretic Anthem, Wait and Bleed, Left Behind etc. You could say their newest albums gone towards Thrash metal slightly, and they've started doing solos|`|wTkvkWscaa	It would help if I knew who you were talking about.<br>  <br>  EDIT: Oh, Slipknot? I really hate this  band. Wikipedia calls them heavy metal. Just look them up on youtube or myspace and listen to them for yourself.|`|ht0v669daa	1 LITTLE MONKEY JUMPING ON THE BED ONE FELL OF AND BUMPED HIS HEAD MAMA CALLED THE DOCTOR AND THE DOCTOR SAID "YOUR MONKEY JUST TOLD ME HES THE ANTICHRIST!"|`|cRoGJ1aqaa	Slipknot plays metal.

Down-tuning guitars does not make something Metal.|`|OLCoFKQraa	People call them Nu Metal, which is a bad term, as there's nothing similar between Slipknot and Korn and other so called "nu metal" bands, it's not really important what category you put them in, slipknot play slipknot style music.|`|qz9trhYhaa	They perform "Garbage".<br>  <br>  Okay on a serious answer, they're a metal band, but they sound like Garbage.|`|JyxNA1o0aa	I'm confused...|`|Catsy82Caa	my favorite!!

MHytd0Mvaa	My favorite is DS9.  I find the characters and their interactions more interesting than most of the other series.  I also like the long-term story arcs, and that fact that what happens in one episode has consequences for what comes after.  The Federation/Cardassian/Klingon/Bajoran/De... Quadrant cultural and political interactions kept the situation unsettled, which gave lots of story options.  There were so many secondary and recurring minor characters that were developed and had back stories of their own, which made the setting so much richer, in my humble opinion.  The show just got more interesting and detailed all the time.<br>  <br>  My least favorite of the group would be Voyager.  Characterization seemed inconsistent to me, and they threw away so many story possibilities when they pretty much just dropped the Maquis angle and then tensions they have used.  The initial "villains" (Kazon) weren't very interesting.  I didn't care for the whole "Barbie of Borg" idea, and that led to the Borg being overused to the point of losing their credibility and interest as enemies.  After the first season, which we watched and recorded religiously, we stopped taping.  By the end of the second season we weren't even watching every week.  After that, it was a couple episodes here, a few there, hoping to see a spark that would make us want to watch it again.  But it never happened.|`|e0338b9bb1dd97eb01a44cc65f8d7e7aaa	i am a sci/fi fan<br>  i take what i can get, i like the star trek series probly more ds9 because it was a little darker<br>  but<br>  Babylon 5 was the best sc/fi tv series done to date (firefly was good as well)<br>  star trek is how we hope the future will be , clean , filled with hope and answers, potiticaly correct.<br>  b5 is how it will be , political ,dirty , dark , forbidding and always more stuff that we do not know , than we do.
vlIXsFmhaa	A Peavey Vypyr 15 is 100 bucks and a 30 is 200. They are great combo amps and i strongly recomend them|`|3jFm0rWdaa	There are Behringers for that amount that sound amazing.|`|PeuFnqQwaa	Try and find a Tube amp... They have a way sweeter, warmer sound. Solid State amps Suck. You don't need a very big one either as about 1 tube watt is equal to 4 solid state watts. I have heard 30 watt tube amps that could tear your head off if you wanted. Look for an inexpensive or used tube amp.|`|rIFqv8nvaa	I personally like the Kh-15 in that price range.

7g43xRenaa	that is ridiculous there only cartoons and its not like all Disney cartoons have characters smoking....i 2 was brought up watchin these films and never has it tempted me 2 smoke!!!! there taking this teenage/children smoking thing 2 far!!!|`|glILXOcdaa	Of course not! But I can understand why it's happening. The government wants to make smoking into a taboo like they did to marijuana. Which makes sense I suppose, since it's far more unhealthy. It's why they put warnings on cigarette packets and launched all those shocking advertising campaigns.  The problem is that there's smoking on TV before the watershed, and kids see adults smoking all the time. The only effective way of stopping people from smoking would be a complete ban, which is practically impossible. Basically, it's just another useless and over intrusive rule we have to put up with.|`|JFJF3GPWaa	That is really really stupid. It will just make it more appealing for people to try it anyway! You can't shield people from the world forever! I never paid attention to people smoking in disney movies! If i saw my favorite actor smoking i might have thought about it for like a milisecond but that is just so over the top it's unbelieveable. (I don't think it will happen though too many people will object)|`|CT3t80suaa	It is believed that people are easily suggestible, and anything seen on the " Big Screens" is cool, and that they should do it too.

4tD32D9qaa	Are you kidding?! Happy isn't a strong enough word, my friend. Ecstatic? Nope, not even close. Orgasmic? Nope, not nearly there. Euphoric, not even a one thousandth of what I'm experiencing. Words can not describe the emotion one is currently experiencing, and has been since September. The more and more I read about this, the more I hear, the more I learn, the more excited I get! <br>  <br>  Not to gloat, but I may very well be the biggest Red Dwarf fan on this website, if that wasn't already evident. Been there since the beginning, seen all the episodes, own all the DVDs, seen all the extras, been to the Dimension Jumps, own and read the books, I've done it all. And I have literally been waiting every second of my life since April the 5th for new material. Have anticipated the news of the film being made (which may still happen Dave hasn't given specific details on their future Dwarf plans and they may fund the film if this goes well, though probably a new series, if anything), I have literally done it all. I, again not to gloat, may be the ultimate 'Dwarfer! <br>  <br>  <br>  Oh, just to clarify some points in your question details:<br>  Channel Dave. April 10th. Showing over Easter weekend. Other countries will not get it simultaneously, but they will get it at some point soon after.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  Yes, I am "happy." But if this is "happy", anything good I've felt prior to this can only be considered...Smeg!|`|2Qr8Lmf6aa	I'm SO chuffed, i've been waiting for this for a heck of a long time.<br>  Apparently they voyage back to Earth in this one, ahh lovely!<br>  <br>  Alliecat: yeah personally i think it lost its "special touch" when kochanski came into it fulltime.<br>  but ah well, here's hoping the easter ep will be good!|`|YWe5fYAhaa	Hell yeah!!!

i210xqkgaa	the 4 bow/arrow octopus would win. although the sword octopus can deal more damage, the arrow octopus can deal damage from a distance. from a distance, the sword guy is a sitting duck. i would imagine an octopus wouldn't have mastery over swords, so it would have no way to block the arrows strikes. octopai are smart, so the arrow one could probably land a direct hit in both of the sword octopus' eyes, thus blinding it and leaving it defenseless and in severe pain. the arrow octopus would the take the eight swords and make sushi of the unarmed blinded fool.|`|TMejdd08aa	umm.... the 8 swords surely..he could chop of the other one's arms (that is if he gets close enough)!!<br>  <br>  p.s why were they fighting in the first place??|`|eyOYwDitaa	8 swords

Travola and Jackson are hitmen that work for a rich man. Bruce Willis is a boxer in the movie and Harvey Keitel is Mr. Wolfe. The movie is out of sequence but if you are smart, you will get it. The film is known for its rich, eclectic dialogue, ironic mix of humor and violence, nonlinear storyline, and host of cinematic and pop culture references. The film was nominated for seven Oscars, including Best Picture; Tarantino and Avary won for Best Original Screenplay. It was also awarded the Palme d'Or at the Cannes Film Festival. A major commercial success, it revitalized the career of its leading man, John Travolta, who received an Academy Award nomination, as did costars Samuel L. Jackson and Uma Thurman.<br>  <br>  The film's title refers to the pulp magazines and hardboiled crime novels popular during the mid-20th century, known for their graphic violence and punchy dialogue. Pulp Fiction is self-referential from its opening moments, beginning with a title card that gives two dictionary definitions of "pulp". The plot, in keeping with most of Tarantino's other works, is presented out of chronological sequence. The picture's self-reflexivity, unconventional structure, and extensive use of homage and pastiche have led critics to describe it as a prime example of postmodern film. Pulp Fiction is viewed as the inspiration for many later movies that adopted various elements of its style. The nature of its development, marketing, and distribution and its consequent profitability had a sweeping effect on the field of independent cinema. A cultural watershed, Pulp Fiction's influence has been felt in several other popular media.

OwAL4V36aa	To put it simply, the more you pay the better and more reliable the guitar will be. It's often safe to go with the big names (Fender and Gibson) or their budget counterparts (Squier and Epiphone respectively).<br>  <br>  There are plenty of copy budget brands that will give you a similar look and feel to the famous designs but at a fraction of the price.<br>  <br>  The best thing to do is to talk to a member of staff in a good guitar shop. Most people working their will be guitarists themselves so they'll know what they're talking about. Just explain your situation and they'll be happy to help. Having a specific budget always helps too.<br>  <br>  Here are a couple of very good online stores that I've dealt with in the past:<br>  <a href="http://www.dolphinmusic.co.uk/" rel="nofollow">http://www.dolphinmusic.co.uk/</a><br>  <a href="http://www.guitarampkeyboard.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.guitarampkeyboard.com/</a><br>  <br>  Dolphin Music is very good and has a wide selection. Even if you don't buy online, it's helpful for seeing what's available for given prices.<br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|tsKiikvDaa	I don't know about prices in the UK but in the US the used ones are way cheaper and you can not tell that's its used. The look and sound exactly the same. Take your son with you and make sure you stick to what you want to spend.  Don't let his begging get to you.  Harmony is usually a good name for a starter guitar.|`|482ec953acc2110dc059d6f3bd500670aa	I don't know if you would be interested in buying online, but if you are, check out Carvin (www.carvinguitars.com). I own two of their guitars--an acoustic and an electric. They are absolutely amazing. You get a lot more guitar for the money with them, too.|`|PeuFnqQwaa	Look for a schecter...they are Very well built guitars. Excellent value for the money. You will not be dissapointed. I own several as well as some expensive Over $1000 guitars (Gibson Les Paul,Fender American Strat). I like the Schecter, better. You can get them in the US in the $300 and up range. You should be able to find them in the UK. Go to their website and look up UK dealers.|`|vriyg1cJaa	Try the cheapest Epiphone SG model, I think its G-400 or G-310. I have one, and it is my most reliable guitar for its price. Hope this helped!|`|rBn4NP5Caa	Squire Fender!<br>  <br>  Sound exactly like Fenders (in fact - i think they are fenders but with a different name!) and are extremely reliable, for under ￡100 too!|`|Gxh126vlaa	Stratocastor|`|mm9DwNFyaa	Get a Fender Stratocaster it will retain it's value in the long run.|`|IdzZVlScaa	Gisons are the best guitars<br>  but they are pricy<br>  it kinda depends on what kind of <br>  music he plays<br>  <br>  fenders are pretty good<br>  and reasonably priced<br>  <br>  but idk what your budget is so....<br>  other good brands<br>  are <br>  ibenez<br>  schecter<br>  jackson<br>  PRS<br>  <br>  why don't you just ack him what kind he<br>  wants but to be reasonable about it.|`|vHxauOyeaa	shoot in the 250-300 US dollar range, I don't have the conversion on hand.... but those are pretty reliable for their experience level and should last a few years.<br>  <br>  Fender is reliable at a higher price, not a bad starter, but I would say epiphone is the best "Cheap" electric, made by gibson.<br>  <br>  I started on an Ibanez for about 250 and it was great, I bought another one recently.|`|tOoJL7sYaa	the best guitar is probably a carvin, but you can find vai's, petrucci's and satriani's.|`|H12d9ctqaa	This is the same case with my brother. He is a couple years younger than your son but has been playing for around the same amount of time.  My mom has been looking but so far has been unable to figure out what would be best for him.  We went to a music store a few days ago to get my boyfriend a birthday present, my mom asked about guitars and her and my brother are going soon to meet with someone and figure out what would be best for him.  I would say that taking him to a store and talking with a professional or even talking to his teacher, if he has one, would be a great help.  They can help you find what you need.<br>  <br>  Hope this helped.|`|WJ7pRtD3aa	you can get a Ibanez with duel humbuckers for cheap.. matter of fact you can get a 'starter pack' with the guitar, amplifier, headphones, cords, picks.. from anywhere between 150$ to 350$...|`|f38b3ba8ee6fe6a37654c84a1d5ac013aa	Just go one step above the cheapest thing.

One says its not a happy ending. One has a question mark next to whether its danielle or archie dies. lots of people say its archie because he only has a year contract, but knowing eastenders who knows. I think it all concludes after archie and peggys wedding which will air in april as ronnie is the bridesmaid and i doubt she would be one if she knew her daughter was alive after all he did tell her she was dead, let alone attend the wedding. Apparetnly its all gonna kick of then so maybe she finds out then. I have heard so many stories one that she gets killed and dies in ronnies arms, another that she needs like blood so stacey tells her. BUt i just hope she doesnt die, after all i think ronnie needs a happy ending, if they kill her off just let her have some time as mother and daughter. Hope this helps, but i wouldnt listen to anybody saying shes def going to die, because no one knows|`|QuUoDkBLaa	Yeah I heard Danielle dies from a complication with her abortion so I guess she tells Ronnie during that.<br>  However I cannot find any of this evidence on the internet (well, not looked since a week ago so there may be some now) I just got told through a friend who read it somewhere.|`|DtU1EpoVaa	I think ronnie kills archie after danielle tells her ( at long last) she is her daughter|`|AfodwqT1aa	when you find out...let me know.<br>  the story line has gone on far to long with the ronnie business....<br>  <br>  but i cant see her dying??<br>  <br>  =/|`|86PuYgDJaa	I heard she was going to tell her on Mother's Day but I haven't heard anything about her dying|`|NEkssyeAaa	Hasnt Daniell told Ronnie yet?? OMG i havent watched Eastenders for 2 weeks, and the story line is pretty much the same, it jsut shows how flat and boring the Eastenders script is.<br>  <br>  I watching 24 Season 1.<br>  9 episodes together , that was better then all eastenders put together.lmaooo.<br>  Im sorry to say, i rather watch 1 episode of 24 or prison break in a week, then watch monday,tuesday,thursday,friday of eastenders.<br>  <br>  Time is essential.|`|drXe7aDeaa	i hope she doesn't die because it would be really nice to eventually see ronnie being a mother to danielle. i really wish danielle would just tell ronnie because it has dragged on a bit ! there has been so many chances and times danielle has tried to tell her but has failed even if stacy found out she would tell ronnie !! xx  finger crossed danielle doesn't die|`|EJuygihGaa	apparently the storyline concludes in the spring|`|5tkAQdAoaa	I Heard She Gets Run Over By Janine Then Dies In Ronnies Arms

KjYxk1S2aa	You mean a Wacom tablet? I don't do manga or doujinshi, but that is the most commonly used tool. :) You don't need to have one, however. Pen-and-ink drawings were used, and still are used, in a lot of mangas and comic books--I'd say most of them are drawn without the help of a tablet, and then just put together on the computer. I've got some tablets, and I highly recommend getting one if you plan to make a web-comic, or just to create high-quality art.<br>  <br>  Once you have everything drawn, there's a program called 'Manga Studio' from eFrontier, which can help you compile everything. It's quite complex, though, and I believe that a basic knowledge of Photoshop can get you through just fine.<br>  <br>  Hope this helps, and good luck with your art!<br>  <br>  ~Jen<br>  <br>  P.S. This is the website where I get my tablets--I only use Wacom, but there are other kinds too: <a href="http://www.wacom.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.wacom.com</a>

I don't know that you could find them free, though. Try searching Veoh.com, they have a lot of films that you can get for free.<br>  <br>  Here are a few more: 'Origins, Spirit of the Past', 'Whisper of the Heart', and 'Pom Poko'--definitely look up Spirited Away, though.

bvwYVGJOaa	well if things are strong like have good friendship level and understanding then go for it and build on the emotional level. however, sagittarius men can be hard to tie down and make them commit to you so don't mention the "C" word to him and slowly build the relationship. With Cancer moon, he'll be funny, charming and romantic.<br>  <br>  Then again, these signs altogether as a person could cheat on you too or just with you for fun, so its your decision if you know what you want and stick to it and ditch him or carry on having the fun time while you're lonely, but i'm sure you got self respect for yourself too.

Despite viewing his child's body in the morgue, Morton remains perfectly calm and asks carefully-laid questions to Stabler, which fills the Detective with unease. When it becomes clear that the little boy who found the body of Morton's son is actually the killer, the police question children who knew both of the boys. Testimonies bring to light that the boy is a sociopath with violent tendencies. Dr. Morton loses his composure in court when this is brought to light, snatching an officer's gun and shooting the boy dead. As a claim of defense during his subsequent trial, the Doctor claims he was not aware of what he doing, and his despair overrode his senses. He rationalizes that the killing was just, because the unrepentant boy would have just gone on to kill again, but he wouldn't.|`|2wrenQfuaa	It seems like Law and Order: Special Victims Unit<br>  <br>  was the show on USA?|`|Sv99BNlEaa	www.imdb.com might help =]<br>  <br>  if not, if you can remember the boys name by chance or the psychologist guy too you can probably find it from that website.

During the challenge, though, Tommy won and picked the first date. Krista didn't like it and complained the whole time. Therefore, Tommy was eliminated, because he didn't progress enough (or something along those lines). Krista left him, because she asked him why they eliminated him; he said he didn't remember. She thought that was really really bad, so she left him.

482ec953acc2110dc059d6f3bd500670aa	Actually, I'd have to respectfully disagree with the poster above. The Yamaha PSR series is actually pretty good for the price. It's not as good as the MOTIF, but the MOTIF is a professional-grade instrument. The PSR keyboards have a lot of good sounds. I got my start on PSR keyboards when I was about your age.<br>  <br>  To me, the most important thing in a keyboard is how it sounds. Roland and Korg have some good stuff in their expensive keyboards, but their cheap stuff doesn't impress me. For the $300-$400 range, Yamaha is the best (I think they're the best in any price range, but that's my opinion). Go to a music store and play around with some of the keyboards. See which ones you like. You might want to consider paying a little bit more ($500-$700). And whatever you do, don't buy a Casio (worst-sounding keyboards ever).<br>  <br>  A MOTIF is a great investment if you're really serious about music. Since you're just starting out, I'd recommend getting something simple. The MOTIF series, like I said, is professional grade. The learning curve for operating them is quite a bit steeper than something like a PSR. The PSR series is designed to be simple so people can just sit down and start playing. I think it would probably meet your needs right now. When you get more serious about playing, though, you should consider saving for a MOTIF. They really are the stuff.|`|PeuFnqQwaa	In that price range you are just going to get junk.. I would not waste my money. Save a little bit more and get a Roland Juno D ($595). You could also look for something used. I have a Roland Juno G ($1000) which is a great little keyboard. I also have a Yamaha Motif XS6 ($2300). If you can ever afford a Motif, they are nothing short of Amazing.  I think for your age the Juno D would be good. It will give you piano sounds, strings, polysynth sounds etc. Pretty versatile and worth the money. Avoid the Cheap Yamaha PSR stuff and Casio as they are really just toys IMHO. For $200 more, I think you would be pretty happy with the Juno D.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://keyboards-midi.musiciansfriend.com/product/Roland-Juno-D-61Key-Synthesizer?sku=700558" rel="nofollow">http://keyboards-midi.musiciansfriend.co...</a>

gIjnoEi5aa	It all comes down the the judges and the performances of the wild card contestants.  From what I understand, Ken Warwick, Idol's executive producer, will allow the judges to bring back about 9-10 of their favorites from the previous semi-finalists on March 5. Each wild card contestant will perform and then the judges will choose the three best to complete the top 12.  So if your fave contestant has already gone home there's still a chance he or she can come back to the competition.|`|zdrXmriAaa	Ok so it goes like this.<br>  <br>  The next 3 highest vote-getters (4th 5th and 6th placers) from each group will go back on March 5 for the wild card.

But I like how Hilary Duff turned out better than Lindsay Lohan. Unfortunately, Hilary Duff faded into obscurity after the end of her Lizzie McGuire show. I can't answer your movie question or music question, but I will say that Hilary Duff ended up better. But I will say that I'm upset that Hilary gave into the pressures to look like a Hollywood girl with fake boobs and everything. I can't stand fake boobs personally. But I'm more upset with the lifestyle Lindsay Lohan ended up leading, and she looks downright awful now.<br>  <br>  As far as looks, neither of the two really float my boat now, but they both USED TO be very pretty, and I thought they'd be good influences for the kids compared to Britney Spears and similar pop stars. Guess I was dead wrong.|`|oDx3Jgdcaa	lindsey lohan. <br>  but shes more of a bad girl....i guess duff is pretty good too, but i like linsey in freaky friday, mean girls, herbie, parent trap, and other movies. shes a good actress<br>  i'm not sure whos prettier, but that doesnt really matter in their jobs. i would say linsey has too many freckles...but i like her hair color more than hilary's blondish color|`|3lF21cFkaa	omg thats a tough question. i've loved them both ever since i was little.. hilary was my role model and i loved watching all of lindays movies. i loved mean girls and confessions of a teenage drama queen and freaky friday. material girls wasnt hilary's best movie.|`|qDctmJTeaa	I like Hilary Duff Better overall<br>  <br>  But I like the movie Mean Girls A LOT better<br>  <br>  I don't really like the songs<br>  <br>  I think Hilary is prettier|`|Jnv47zQgaa	Lindsey Lohan<br>  Mean Girls<br>  Roumors<br>  Lindsey Lohan|`|evG6zBBKaa	I like Hilary better.

tQW18Kspaa	Unforgiving until <br>  they get their way<br>  But not all|`|cuIX13BKaa	Well I saw this question and was going to answer it with Aries as a generality...but that is not exactly fair....save that when an Aries is upset or frustrated and forgiveness is necessarey....they DO listen...Yes they can be incredibly implusive and mean forever when they have become angry and blow up....but i will say that beneath the impulse lays a very discerning and forgiving sign. I DO mean this.....from my past with Aries men and women.....I have an Aries Moon....the moon indicates the personality and I will say that oh I can have drama (Also 3 planets in Leo mind you in my chart) but my Aries Moon is extremly forgiving...I know that I am what I call "Perfectly Flawed" so I am NO ONE to NOT forgive! I am not stubborn....even though it is my Moon Sign in Aries...for as quickly as I may become insenced with a particular situation....it blows over just that fast.....I may seem stubborn on some accounts....right fully so...and that has to do with my intolerance of people to treat others cruelly......THAT is when steam comes out of my ears.....but again I am incredibly forgiving...so much so that my Moon near Taurus...near enough to wonder if the calculations were off...but they aren't ~ Aries is a part of my signature being...it actually enhances who I am and if yo uneed somethng done....call on me...I will get it done. The Aries women I know are some of the funniest, most caring people on earth. I worked with two of them for well over 15 years...not one spat...and this being at work is nearly amazing. My other friends that are Aries women can be counted on in a heartbeat ~ This is a great sign and though I am a Virgo with Cancer Rising....the Aries Moon is trine 3 planets I have in Leo.....life is always in flux and I recommend looking at the positive traits of the Aries Woman...they are loyal, hilarious, truthseeking and I will always treasure my alliances with them! We are All better for having known them! They are punctual, giving, forgiving and usually the fiorst to get the joke or blaze anew trail~I have trusted quite a few of them in a crisis through the years and I could never have found a better friend!<br>  <br>  Garbo|`|3CXfqxcgaa	And how.

They never stay mad long, unless you did something really, really bad. If you cheat... forget it! They will never forgive! I am an aries and I have forgiven and forgot... for the most part.

I don't hold grudges... good luck!|`|gKhe06Uyaa	It depends on what you done, but most Aries are stuck in there on ways!!

In my opinion it was not scary at all, it had some creepy gory and surprising graphics but overall the movie was great.  it had a great twisted storyline and i loved it! you should watch it..maybe without your daughter if she will be scare but probably not.

The new Yamaha synths are really good, though. I'd still stick with Yamaha.|`|PeuFnqQwaa	Korg, Roland or Yamaha ... those are the three biggest names. Exactly what model you want depend on the sounds you want and quality. Do you want the old Monophonic (1 note at a time) analog synth style or do you want the more modern Polyphonic synth capaabilities (can play up to 128 notes at a time).  In you price range you are rather limited. You may want to go to a music store and check out the Roland Juno D ($595) See below. Its a Polysynth.<br>  <br>  I myslef use a Roland Juno G ($1000) and a Yamaha Motif XS6 ($2300).

Crash Test Mommy:  I like watching this because i like seeing the crash test mommies try to handle the kids most of them don't succed but I like watching it.    Seinfield:  Because it is funny.      Friends:  I like watching it because it is funny and easy to relate to.    Will & Grace:  I like watching it because it is funny and it always makes me laugh.  They do hiliarious things, sometimes normal other times not.    Everybody Loves Raymond:  It is funny and the mom treats raymond so badly!    ER:  I just like watching this.  Drama and everything    Project Runway:  Because I want to be a fashion designer and I love fashion.    Australia, Canada, America's Next Top Model:  I like the drama and it is part of fashion.

For example, There was this episode in anime on the Last dance, where Misaki was dragging Tsubasa with her. And they danced together.  About his relation with Mikan, they look like a doting brother and sister.|`|Klw3Ke3Haa	I think so.

T0pkW783aa	I believe that Dolly Parton is 62 or 63 this year.  Those are not her real breasts but are implants.  Dolly is very tiny; she has a tiny frame,( I read once that she has an 18" waist and that the bustline which looks outrageously large is actually a size 32 DD), works very hard and probably exercises, too.  She hasn't had children so didn't get heavy as some do after childbirth.  Dolly wears wigs most of the time.|`|c8d511b57b38b8ff3a19d1b90168fef3aa	I don't know how old she is - she has implants - and she wears wigs.

jaAolejUaa	Can both still say they have 30 years of firefighting experience?yes. their reffering to the number of years<br>  Isn't that claim extremely subjective? their not talking about the amount of work done they just want to know how long u have been in service<br>  And why should any weight be given to that claim?it doesnt matter how many fires u stop in a day,as long as you have been practicing that for that number of years and basically know the workarounds more than those that worked for a lesser number of years. it's just like saying that even if this person working for 1 year stopped 350 fires and that who worked for 30 years who only stopped 30 fires, still the one working for 30 years should know more.

vlIXsFmhaa	Like I was saying ealier, AJFA is their most progressive album and is the most technical but for Kirk Hammett this is an exception. I think that with the solos on Creeping Death, Ride The Lightning, and Fade To Black, Kirk Hammett's best work can be found on RTL<br>  <br>  BQ: Creeping Death/RTL<br>  BQ 2: RTL<br>  <br>  Although AJFA showcases Metallica's talent the best, Its still not the best album. The reason for this is that it lacked some of the rawness and fire that KEA and RTL and MOP had. It has a little less personality even though it was the most technical and difficult. This is why people tend to gravitate towards the older albums. That reason and the fact that there was no Cliff for this one.|`|h1yGVkkfaa	I would have to agree with you on the album choice's.<br>  Ride the lightning has some fantastical guitar work like RtL,From whom the bell tolls,Fade to black.Master of Puppets also has some fantastical guitar work like Orion(intstrumental),MoP and even Leper messiah.<br>  <br>  I love both albums.<br>  <br>  BQ:Fade to blackie *oohh maybe even The four horse men. Arrg.. to hard to choose. <br>  BQ2:Master of the puppets.<br>  ( I guess,i agree with the song choices too :P )|`|U48HUZ5Kaa	Ride the Lightning was definetly the best . I think every song on that album was a masterpiece thanks to Kirks leads. The song that really stands out to me is Fight Fire with Fire but thats looking at it overall.<br>  <br>  BQ:Ride the Lightning(The Song)<br>  BQ2: Same|`|LkN5nr6faa	Master of Puppets. Listening to the title track is like a musical journey, with the hardcore metal riffs, then the delicate bridge solo. It really showcases Kirks capabilities as a player in that song, having acoustic elements, as well as an almost soothing bridge, and a melt your face off guitar solo. (I also failed to mention that the bridge was harmonized by both James and Kirk, making it that much more masterful)<br>  <br>  BA: Master of Puppets<br>  BA2: I think the most technical and best Metallica solo is from 'Blackened', which is, yes, from ...AJFA but I don't believe me choosing that makes my previous point invalid.|`|vK9Vv9gjaa	My favorite album and kirks best work is Ride The Lighting.<br>  <br>  BQ: ride the lighting<br>  BQ: also ride the lighting<br>  <br>  I choose this very carefully cause all four of there first albums were phenomenal, and yes I do realise that kirk was not in the band for kill em all. but even compared to that I still think ride the lighting is better.|`|dFacbjIZaa	Ride The Lightning<br>  <br>  Mostly because of "The Call Of Ktulu" and "Creeping Death"<br>  <br>  Just wow, Ya know?|`|5zwcnmOIaa	Ride the lightening<br>  <br>  <br>  bq:one<br>  bq2: masta o' puppets|`|pNUtnoC8aa	Justice personally, Kirk rocked on Blackend.<br>  2nd choice would be Ride the Lightining|`|JyxNA1o0aa	YAY! =D<br>  <br>  The Album is Ride The Lightning IMO because jeezis h crist i love all of the solos and leads on that album.....<br>  <br>  BA:Creeping Death =]<br>  ba2:Ride The Lightning

srtoPxN2aa	I've been a fan since his days with 'Teardrop Explodes'...love most of his solo stuff too. The 'Kilimanjaro' album was their best in my opinion, though when it comes down to it, I think I prefer his solo material ....as the two early 'Teardrop Explodes' albums sound very dated to me these days, and didn't age quite as nicely as other albums by bands from the 'post punk/New Wave/synth pop' movement of the early 80's like Japan, Ultravox, Echo and the Bunnymen, and The Psychedelic Furs for instance.<br>  I was always a huge Syd Barrett/early Pink Floyd fan, and their influence on his material is quite apparent. I think this is what drew me to him in the beginning.<br>  <br>  Julian's first two albums, 'World Shut Your Mouth', and 'Fried' released in the early - mid 80's were very good on the other hand. Then he sort of went through a bit of a dry spell IMO, as I recall buying his 'Droolian' album, and really disliking it. It wasn't until the release of 'Peggy Suicide' and 'Jehovahkill' during the early 90's that he regained my interests. The latter being my favorite album by him...favorite song from that album would be 'Up-wards at 45 Degrees'.<br>  <br>  Lately Julian has been making a name for himself online, with his internet site, <br>  'Head Heritage', where he reviews some great classic psych, space rock, Krautrock, and prog albums from the late 60's -70's, along with newer releases too. If you haven't heard of it, put it into your favorites...I'm quite sure you'd enjoy it:<br>  <a href="http://www.headheritage.co.uk/" rel="nofollow">http://www.headheritage.co.uk/</a><br>  Here's his reviews:<br>  <a href="http://www.headheritage.com/unsung/reviews/" rel="nofollow">http://www.headheritage.com/unsung/revie...</a><br>  Julian and his wife also have a store on eBay, where they sell rare collectible vinyl. I've bought a few things from them over the last couple years or so.<br>  <br>  A few other favorites by Julian as a solo artists are;<br>  Drive, She Said<br>  Soul Desert<br>  Elegant Chaos<br>  Reynard the Fox<br>  East Easy Rider<br>  No Hard Shoulder to Cry On<br>  Poet Is Priest<br>  Planet Ride<br>  Greatness and Perfection<br>  Hanging Out & Hung Up on the Line<br>  Gimme Back My Flag<br>  A Crack in the Clouds<br>  Julian H. Cope<br>  Laughing Boy<br>  Spacehopper<br>  <br>  Sadly I didn't care for much of what he did after 'Jehovahkill', though '20 Mothers' and 'Interpreter' had their moments I suppose...<br>  <br>  Here's a couple audio/videos from Jehovahkill...<br>  <br>  Gimme Back My Flag:<br>  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kcsQSkT6a48&feature=related" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kcsQSkT6a...</a><br>  Julian H.

NJdJD3oIaa	i do not believe this is a good thing, i don't think that such things should happen cause it could bring a lot of problems and a freedom which is bad understood..... but in the same time i do not respect this principles and i really believe that something in this way of living is wrong....it is not the way it should be <br>  when a couple lives like that, there it is only  a half of what relationships should mean. why? cause the couple cannot assume his own state, the people inside live into a weird compromise which will not ensure security, trust, and support and above without a God. <br>  living together as a couple and not as a husband and wife is a kind of life without any rules ( the rules are only imagined and build up on a fake pattern which is not stable and right)|`|0ectWZxAaa	Yea, you don't know what kind of strange and unusual habbits they might have. It may sound silly but after 3 months of falling in the toilet because they wont close the thing You might have second thoughts. lol|`|c8TXAAj1aa	Nope. No shacking. I think the real point of not shacking is so that you can maintain abstinance before marriage (if youre trying to be abstinant). I wouldnt last long with that living with a boyfriend or fiancee.|`|SZ1cva63aa	I think a couple should move in with a married couple and find out what the hell they're in for.|`|6m1Qdmjaaa	Honestly, these days, most anything is acceptable! : )|`|87byYJxGaa	Not necessarily|`|c61a0e2e80d52c6bcbe882ac44182056aa	Absolutely|`|9ZeOeFmAaa	Yes, you don't know how someone really is until you live with them.|`|u8SeGmnZaa	No, look at the bible a few times will ya?!?!?!?!?!?!|`|FIcsV3cpaa	sure i mean its not like they HAVE TO u no...but it would just be god if they did.....u no...|`|f085871ddf80c5f69bba2eab93ae75a0aa	Sure why not|`|AA11883675	It just depends!|`|DVFexW3naa	No. moving in with your boy/girl friend is so dumb! my mom told me never to do it.|`|GFEhJYAAaa	nope|`|b5278795de772832ea8fb4db71b4866eaa	of course thats wen there true colors come out|`|fyggOrpJaa	yeah go ahead|`|uqLayZHraa	Yes, then you find out if you can really live with one another. You find out all the idiosyncrasies that drive you crazy. Like the don't pick up after themselves, have weird eating habits, etc. Also, if they can support themselves with a reliable job. LIving together is no so much about sex but compatibility.|`|k7XAymUDaa	I don't think that's OK... I personally believe the reason you live together is because you want to know if you will be able to live with that person for the rest of your life, before getting married, but you should at least be engaged...|`|AbgrpXJ4aa	yes. you have to work out some logistics before you can decide if legally binding yourselves is reasonable.|`|FTS6aaNIaa	i believe its a good idea. Because that way you can see if you can be in the same house as that person.|`|AA10278434	yes. they should live together so they can tell whether they enjoy living with the person.|`|q1Va2WCnaa	I believe a couple should live together and forget about marriage.|`|FPuhWpuXaa	yes for about a year that way you can see what they are really like. and they're bad/good habits.|`|OH9iAKM2aa	whatever suits the couple|`|fnj9Ecgbaa	Sure|`|78jGoZoiaa	YES!!!!!!!!!!!! you should test the waters before you jump in....|`|iVbfg8JXaa	Yes I do.|`|FdCUDD94aa	yess|`|WnAIfTD3aa	yeah i think its fine|`|jj6ujcneaa	yes! (for at least 50 years!)|`|npC5zxOmaa	do whatever you want just dont ever get married|`|XjcrMNBuaa	well i dont believe in marriage so.....<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  but i do think this is a case to case basis..what works for some may not work for others<br>  =)|`|mggll8dRaa	No, just because 'Everybody does it' does not make it anymore Right;<br>  <br>  Where has MORALITY Gone...??|`|c2a0BgWraa	Yes I do. I believe that is very important.  You never know someone COMPLETELY until you've lived with them. <br>  <br>  Take my mother for instance; she was married to my step father almost three months before they moved in with eachother( long distance relationship. She was in the process of moving). She had no idea how incredibly annoying yet boring it was to live with him until she got there. <br>  <br>  They are now getting divorced.|`|Lljkj0EFaa	There is no proof that it will reduce the chance of divorce, in some studies it actually leads to a higher rate of divorce.<br>  Personally, I would not.|`|IizPFrELaa	Personally no, I'm old school and even saved mysefl for marriage.|`|sYXJ5Nj2aa	Living in sin is the best.|`|FgRUdQOBaa	That is an individual issue that the couple should answer based on their own feelings, not what someone else thinks.<br>  <br>  However Cherry is right, the divorce rate of people that lived together first is actually higher than for couples that didnt. <br>  <br>  Neither is a decision that should be taken lightly or rushed into.|`|e3cNU8Spaa	No I don't believe in that. I think a couple should get married first then live together. But wait. Actually, now that I think about it, maybe a couple should live together just to see how marriage is like, and experience living together.|`|f0c95deaaf11cb4f884379031898dea3aa	Yes I do. People tend to act different when living together and it's better to work things out and experiment before tying the knot and finding out it doesn't work.|`|YnBdka6naa	I think it would make things easier. You'd get to know each other on a different level and get the feel of how things will be. I'll probably live with the person before I marry them.|`|f613f2fe5139782b7ab3cd67bba86d3caa	yeah<br>  cuz you never know what the other person's really like unless you live with them <br>  cuz then you get to see like their daily habits and stuff and see if that really suits you|`|zfPH6LmBaa	yes, that way they know what its like to live with each other, if they wanna get married now they know what they'll be like|`|ba46a3ce2e28f5140e36ee11c824ec41aa	Im not sure on that one have done both and Im undecided|`|rRIYB9WNaa	Yes<br>  <br>  To know them more better<br>  So they can understand their problems
QEEweJUaaa	The term Melungeon was originally used for a group   of people living on Newman's Ridge and vicinity, near Sneedville in Hancock County,  Tennessee, and their descendants.  These are people described  as having features like white people but being somewhat darker,   sometimes with a gray cast to their skin.  They have been there for a   long time, some say they were there before the whites started arriving.         This group originated from mixed race groups along the  northern border of North Carolina and neighboring areas of Virginia.    These groups were remnants of the Saponi Siouan Indians but were  no longer pure Indian racially.  They may have absorbed survivors of  several white groups.  Brent Kennedy has been investigating the   possibility that there was a substantial Mediterranean element from  Moorish, Turkish, Spanish and Portugese seamen abandoned on   the Virginia coast by Sir Francis Drake and from Spanish settlements   on the Carolina coast.  He derives the name Melungeon from a Turkish   word meaning "Lost Soul".|`|IizPFrELaa	Yes|`|SK5FGKCCaa	no|`|XPaLYdobaa	its someone of mixed race from some were in USA,woops!yes.|`|AA11308757	no, what is it?

482ec953acc2110dc059d6f3bd500670aa	It all depends on the person. I personally think bass is easier (and I play both), but I know guitarists who think guitar is easier.<br>  <br>  With guitar, you are forming chords and strumming/picking all or most of them. With bass, you are usually only playing one note at a time. That's why I think it's easier. You are just fretting and playing one note and following the rhythm of the drums. Like the other guy said, you can make it really complicated like Victor Wooten, but you can keep it really simple, too.<br>  <br>  Also, everyone keeps saying that guitars have six strings and basses only have four. Technically, that's incorrect. There are five- and six-string basses too. What makes bass easier is how many strings you are playing at the same time, not the total number of strings.|`|aTS9NoTNaa	Bass is generally considered to be easier as its more rhythmic and only has four strings. (it's bass not base)|`|PeuFnqQwaa	Bass can be a bit easier to learn to play though, learning to play it well, will likely take you about the same amount of time it would to learn to play guitar well. The theory you need to know is the same for both. Playing bass can require some serious hand and finger strength. The neck is longer than a guitar neck and your arm will be extended more. If you enjoy it, you will find learning it easier. There are some simple songs you can learn. You can also get by by just playing th root notes of the guitar chord the guitar player is playing at the time, but you will find that this makes for a boring, uninteresting bass line. Want to see some really good Bass players and what can be done with a bass. Do a Youtube search for Victor Wooten,  Jeff Berlin, Jaco Pastorious. You will see that it can get insanely complicated. But it also can be simple. It all depends on where you want to take it.|`|7j7I2lNyaa	Bass. You only have to learn to use 4 strings over 6 on a regular Guitar.

How are you? <br>   Easily Mr. Brownstone!

I'm good. I just saw Slumdog Millionaire, which is an absolutely amazing movie which I highly recommend.<br>  <br>  Well I have heard Mr. Brightside millions of times in the past, so it is annoying at this point. Mr. Brownstone is a great song too, so I'm gonna go with tha one because I haven't heard it a billion times.<br>  <br>  BQ1: The interesting questions and the people<br>  <br>  BQ2: It is boring often. You know, questions that are way too demanding, unoriginal, or just stupid<br>  <br>  BQ3: Well once I had a dream where the girl I liked died. It was pretty graphic, with blood and stuff. My mind is not gorey and stuff, so I have no idea why I drempt that. It made me very confused.<br>  On a lighter note, one time I was dreaming, and I knew it was a dream. I was like, wait, that's not possible! This must be a dream. I thought of the endless posibilities. But just then, I woke up.|`|rXlyHk1Raa	This is my kind of question, considering my name is Mr. Brownstone.

Best example is Children Of Bodom. Also I became good friends with one of my contacts offa here and it's good for us to chat about current events in our countries, etc.<br>  <br>  BQ2: That people who you love answering questions from seem to come and go. It's the trolls that drive them away and I wish that this place had stricter policies.<br>  <br>  BQ3: The worst dreams I've head is where I know im having one and im half awake and know im moaning but I can't stop, it's a horrible feeling!!|`|ONWCXzUMaa	I like both but I'll go with Brownstone tonight.<br>  BQ1: people like yourself, and the wonderful things i've learned from you all [as you see us old fuzzies can learnd to}<br>  BQ3: The trolls got to be one but I find Y&A don't run a very good ship, I would not like to be at sea with them. The ship would sink. I think they have to let us be more interactive in our questions, in that way we would learn more from each other.<br>  take care<br>  dave|`|M7E1uIsKaa	Mr Brownstone, Of course :)<br>  <br>  BA:  Learning about new bands, Sharing a common interest with people I dont really know.<br>  <br>  BA2:  Trolls, Blink 182 questions<br>  <br>  BA3:  I hate when I have bad dreams!

nZCT32XCaa	I don't remember much the songs in the sequels, but the one at the end of the first one is definitely great, though it doesn't evoke in me any emotions.

2359d9032d2e09a21521d23e5aa743aeaa	His brother had IRS clearance and was able to find out information about people such as where they lived and worked. Will Smith's character needed to meet these people before he decided to give them one of his organs or not.   Remember the scene at the nursing home, he went in to help the guy before he found out that he just bought a sports car, was running a dump and then ended up smashing the guys head into security glass be leaving.    He could never forget his past that is why he decided to kill himself|`|jLXv46rnaa	I agree it was because of the IRS clearance ...he was able to get info on people who owed taxes and that  info as well as their name, home, etc. gave  him a way to speak to them to find out more about them. If he had just been a guy off the street, most people wouldn't have talked to him for very long.

P0Fjh59Eaa	Claw her way out the fastest- Blair hands down...that chick would mop the floor w/Marty, find a window to kick Tea out of then come up scratched and blooded to belt out enough insults to shrink them down to size. Tea would be too busy mooning over Todd, and Marty would be too busy wallowing in her own victim-hood.<br>  <br>  which one would come out the winner of todd's affections? ehhh...Marty, she plays the poor hapless victim so well and Todd eats it up. he's indifferent to Tea most times, and though there is a spark w/Todd and Blair at all times i think at this point he just likes to mess w/her too much to really care.<br>  <br>  I think Todd would pull up a lounge chair and pop a big bowl of popcorn and have a huge Big Gulp in hand while watching that mess!|`|ADBMrG87aa	I can just see Todd's face witnessing a 3 way cat fight between Blair, Marty and Tea; he'd be saying "Let's get ready to R U M B L E !!!<br>  <br>  The fastest one to claw her way out on top would be Blair handsdown; Blair's a she-devil, a wildcat; she's already shoved Tea out of a window in the past and Marty would be no match for her.  Tea would come out on top second cuz she's a very smart determined survivor and Marty would be last, she'd have to be picked up by the others cuz she just loves to play the victim.<br>  <br>  (\__/)<br>  (='.'=)<br>  (")-(")<br>  Sweetie|`|dbKj55akaa	Blair or Tea.

No question!|`|nrqWwQBXaa	i would have to say blair. and todd will always love her?|`|7XM4QJiuaa	Blair would win, she still loves Todd no matter what she says.|`|876392dfe1f6d9806d256fd933358144aa	my money is on Marty...she's something else from way back in the day. Just because you have someones baby does not mean you have his heart...Blair would come in second but not on top!!!|`|AA11573893	Blair would win both contests|`|HGnKhY0maa	Blair|`|1e618d0e4be217a1ddaceccaae55acb0aa	Blair -- Marty is screwed up and Tea is a lawyer....ugh.....|`|UY3zl9dFaa	I have to go with the majority and say Blair- she's the meanest and toughest and has actually tried to kill people when she was angry enough! Todd would just love to watch that fight! I think Blair will always end up first in his heart- they're true soul mates (partners in crime). No one else is crazy enough to put up with either of them for long.|`|NGNeT3rYaa	I don't think any of them would make it out, they would all kill each other first!|`|sgHvnxe2aa	BLAIR, of course!!!!!<br>  <br>  And in the end....Blair and Todd will end up back together again...Don't<br>  they always....I can't see him with Marty, really....Blair is into John, but<br>  she can beat Tea and Marty anytime....GO, BLAIR!!! :-)<br>  <br>  Todd would probably enjoy it....don't you think...He would make some popcorn, sit back, and enjoy the show... :-)|`|fjNxzd6Baa	Tea would come out first. She takes a direct route to her goals no matter what the cost. Marty would be consumed by self-doubt and angst. Blair will continue to fight whoever is in the sack with her.

mGEwdQyvaa	You're correct, and congratulations. You have no idea how much it frustrates me when sighted people come on here and insist that blind people can see in their dreams because they aren't using their eyes. No, they can't, because if they've been blind since birth their brain has no visual reference to go back to and base imagined images on. They can however still dream. They just dream in sound, other senses, and the general knowledge of what's going on (knowing that there's lightning outside even if you can't look out the window, etc). Since dreams are imagined, our brains know what is happening even if we don't realize it yet.. <br>  <br>  If you go blind late in life, you may still have memory of sight, so you likely will still dream in pictures, but not if you are born blind. <br>  <br>  Oh, and you did ask a blind person. Blind people *DO* use computers with accessible technology (screen reading software). I am not totally blind, but I have several friends and a boyfriend who are.|`|0GEfecJwaa	thats a really good question sorry i dont know the answer but u do get a star from me

All of them are animated  (just about) because those are the kind of movie I most enjoy, and because I can think of several <br>  Some general recommendations:<br>  <br>  Comedy:<br>  Anything by Pixar, particularly Wall-E, The Incredibles, or Ratatouille; all of their films are funny and emotionally rewarding to at least some extent; Wall-E in particular is enjoyable for a large range of different reasons.  The Emperor's New Groove is also probably a good bet.  Also the Triplets of Belleville<br>  <br>  Action-Adventure:<br>  Anything with Hayao Myazaki's name in the credits, particularly Howl's Moving Castle, Princess Mononoke (one of my personal favorite films), and Spirited Away, for the same reasons as the above, though they have a somewhat more 'mature' feel to them (Not to say that Pixar is intended for kids; more that Studio Ghibli's films often have a minimum age limit as far as appropriateness goes.  Mononoke and Valley of the Wind come to mind.)  The Chronicles of Narnia and Harry Potter films are also pretty good, though in this case you may be better off just reading the books.<br>  <br>  Tragedy:<br>  Grave of the Fireflies.  Definitely not a 'kids' movie, this one is garunteed to make you cry your eyes out.  If that's your thing, go for it.<br>  <br>  Hope that you find these recommendations to be to your liking.|`|Q0Ky6DeLaa	Totally with you!<br>  <br>  A Walk To Remember (A little sad, but really really really good)<br>  Twilight (Action, not scary. A tad bloody, but i am in love with it and wasn't scared what so ever, and i'm a complete wimp. It was actually really funny)<br>  Mean Girls (Very funny)<br>  The Devil Wears Prada (Very funny)<br>  Yes Man (Funny)<br>  Sorry its a little short, but i can't think of a lot : )|`|y5kXh0QEaa	Anchorman is a very funny movie.  If you want a light, romantic movie, I recommend 50 First Dates.  Another new movie I really liked is Get Smart.|`|MI4BTTVzaa	you should watch The Goonies. It is a great movie.

Lamb Chop has been described as a "6-year-old girl, very intuitive and very feisty, a combination of obstinacy and vulnerability...you know how they say fools rush in where wise men fear to go? Well, Lamb Chop would rush in, then scream for help."|`|AA11618168	He died in a tragic fire (bar-b-que)|`|fHxpycJSaa	When Sheri Lewis died, Lamb Chop decided to retire.

uyQppMYLaa	I love books. Absolutely love them. I find that they relax me, even reading the classics, which can be quite difficult. I'm reading five at the moment, two non-fiction and three fiction, and I like to skip between them depending on my mood. I just find that you can lose yourself in a book, you can't do other things whilst reading, you have to concentrate 100%. They really make me happy. You can lose yourself in another person's story, you root for them, you cheer for them, cry for them laugh for them.     I also like to read the paper and magazines. I'll read pretty much anything apart from celebrity magazines, which bore me.|`|rqx0jHDWaa	what kind of question is that who da F*** asks that..DUECES|`|AA11259815	Certainly.     Why? Expand your knowledge. Learn new vocabulary. Open your mind. Build brain cells.     I have $2000 in books Ive had for years, sadly I havent read them. I do from time to time. But I realize I will eventually forget what I read go figure. Even when I take notes. I am more into educational books rather than fictional to pass the time. But what I read I do not apply in everyday life nor speak or write about it to help remember.     Books continue the knowledge and imagination. They are very important. Information and stories are priceless as books are brain food =).     Now if only I can reap what I sow ...|`|zAPzCIBEaa	yes  its run lets you in another world|`|lrkKyHNMaa	I haven't read for a long time but I had a dream last night that I was at the library I used to go to.|`|ZZ5Rm406aa	Yes, because     1. It helps to enhance our language  2. It helps to usefully spend our time  3. It helps to relax our system|`|K1oOQqqVaa	Yes because it makes you a better person.|`|7R7e6yX5aa	i like text and magazines best-mostly non fiction|`|VLO7e4tMaa	Yes, for lots of reasons.  Sometimes to have a laugh, sometimes for  practical information, sometimes to transport to another time & place, sometimes out of curiosity about something, or to be up on what everyone else is reading. I just bought a big comfy chair & ottoman to have my own quiet reading spot!|`|AA10723657	love to brings me into diffrent worlds|`|SK5FGKCCaa	Yep because it's fun!|`|XZlFLecLaa	yes. because i like to escape reality to another time and place for awhile... :)|`|nrnVqh7iaa	I enjoy very much.  It is a way to live a different life and see things that I would never see...|`|Lsz5Nqw7aa	yes because you get to know the characters so much better than in movies... u see more inside their heads and u spend a week with them instead of a few hours... i love reading books!! :)|`|EMfLFsXEaa	I love reading books because it's a chance to get away from reality and into a world of my own.|`|PEK7LEQtaa	yes because i like learning and its fun.|`|sVFkMVujaa	love to read books, absolutely love to.  i literally cannot remember not being able to read.  i read war and peace in the first grade (really) and the family legend is i helped my older sister with her homework when i was three years old.|`|PpaaRkm9aa	I love to read books.

It serves a multitude of purposes.|`|A60fh6craa	Yes I do,     1. U end up with tons of information  2. U improve ur writing style, how u compose sentences  3. U broaden ur horizons|`|hIrBZS3oaa	Yes before bed and on long car rides.     Then i give them to my grandma to read lol. It's funny to think that she's going to read the same sex scene in a romance novel that I just read.|`|ksoMldqYaa	Of course, my favorite hobby, I love to escape into a story and forget about the rest of my worries.

You are in your own world.|`|6Nmly1wmaa	I do like to read I hated it in school but now that im older I do like it|`|VERrlErvaa	I love reading books, fiction and non-fiction.  I think they are a valuable resource and a way of losing oneself in the adventures of a character.    There's so many out there, that everyone who is literate can find someone in their favourite genre - and even the illiterate find meaning in books too.  In fact, by pursuing reading, the illiterate slowly find that they become better at reading and understanding.    What's not to love about books... You can take them and read them anywhere; they don't need batteries; you can trade them in at bookstores for a different book; you can hide behind them; throw them at people and learn how to cook out of them.    I give books two big "thumbs up"|`|C9NPv1WPaa	yep|`|mKvBPA7baa	dpends on the story of the book|`|MIj9K9M4aa	Yes!

Reasons are because books are interesting and they are a nice escape when there is much else interesting to do. When reading, one must employ one's imagination in order to enjoy the book. I love reading.|`|NXwzuv3Paa	yes. they are interesting. most of the time the book is better than the movie|`|LzWfHMZhaa	Thanks for the   |---  |-----------2 Points--------|||"|""\__  |__________________|||_|___|)  !(@)'(@)""""**!(@)(@)****!(@)|`|H6RnpYtXaa	I love reading, bcz it allows you to travel all over the world while you're lying on your bed .. how comfortable !|`|JhHgL7QJaa	Yeh. you can learn a lot from them.|`|kV0UhqFWaa	yes because when i read i am practically inside the book. i love it, especially fiction|`|pmFFVhp2aa	Yes, because it's my way of relaxing.|`|qJPiyGdqaa	no.  coz its boring!  i'd rather watch a movie.              =]|`|bkz5hs4Paa	Yes, it's just a way to get away from life and get lost is someone else's world for a bit.|`|Bo3M090Xaa	yes becuase they're interesting !|`|a678a069d43bd5df52f54a3f3ef6cdd0aa	no i don't . i think it's boring . ):|`|95SFaABxaa	Yes I do.  I remember some studies being done that showed reading stimulates different areas of the brain than watching movies or tv.  Also, listening to music rather than watching videos stimulates different areas of the brain.  I like having my brain stimulated, I guess!|`|c5bOFwaQaa	yes. something to do to pass the time.|`|Ws2crI1Jaa	books are entertaining, informative and relaxing, depending on what type of book you choose to read...i like reading james patterson books,court dramas, and occasional horror books.|`|vZxrQh4Jaa	Yes I love it ! It takes my mind off troubles and it makes me relax .. but I also love watching movies :]|`|MZqn8yhxaa	ya! It takes up time and its fun|`|n6kDpIhKaa	Yeah, cause it's nice to see what the world is like for other people.|`|23HBEDHqaa	not really i rather enjoy reading these things that sort of resemble books. they have pages, a cover and just about everything. almost like the real thing. then again perhaps those were books all the time trying to trick me. so guess after all my answer will have to be yes.|`|3m0bWksNaa	I love to read, it can take you to a whole different dimension depending on the books you read or it can give you insight into Historical things that you didn't know. Poetry can change your mood like music does and there's also the thought of it could give you that extra little push to become a writer yourself.|`|NHRzDYNPaa	I LOVE LOVE LOVE to read books !! :D that's b'cause its fun ! :D

sJs0nuTSaa	It turns out that the important part of the pictures was a spot that kept getting bigger and bigger.  The dad thought it was his nipples, but the mom pointed out that it was just 1 spot.  So, he went to the teacher and asked him if he had a mole in that spot, and that he might want to go to the doctor to get it checked out.  They didn't show the teacher after that, but made mention of how he thanked the little girl and told her to keep drawing whatever she wanted.

m3nrV4u7aa	I used to when I was younger, but then as time went on, I realised that that's just what men do.  And as I get older, I love it when they stare...Enjoy it while you're young enough, 'cause when the staring dies down, you aren't so quick to complain.  Call me what you will, but one day, you'll walk in my footsteps.|`|Z0Vds9oCaa	Yes because its so obvious when they do it.<br>  <br>  They don't even attempt to make it look like they're staring at something else.|`|bxji3S56aa	If woman wanted men to stop starring at them.<br>  <br>  stop dressing with such revealing clothes.<br>  <br>  otherwise, shut up, lol. <br>  <br>  If we wore clothes that emphasized our package, and wore TIGHT shirts so our muscles shw, you'd be starring too.|`|Y5XRdMlfaa	Very annoyed, I've actually found myself saying I'm up here.|`|INf502UUaa	..What breasts?

Like a week ago wen I was at my boyfriends house his brother bent over to spit an looked at my but an then walked pass an grabbed it, I don't even know him foreal it makes me sick|`|msKHbeCzaa	I am flattered when they like to look, cause obviously it means they like what they're looking at, but grossed out when they can't do it in a way where you don't keep noticing what they're doing. Then yes, it is just annoying.|`|sICqdaDzaa	Depends. Sometimes I like the attention, sometimes I don't. It depends on the guy and what mood I'm in.|`|rQ7UTtu1aa	uhm not really unless we are having a conversation and my boobs is all he is staring at then yes|`|zntOXCfuaa	Yes.

It's annoying.|`|yUnQahGoaa	I usually say something. When I was younger I would say something and if I got a smart remark or they were rude I would hit them. Now I only hit people I know that are doing it, like friends and stuff. But before I never cared. I'm just surprised no one ever hit me back. (As far as strangers go...can't say much for past friends.)|`|1SIpJNoSaa	the last girl i liked, i NEVER looked at her chest of butts. i respect her to much for that. she is a great girl and i'm sure is fed up with pervs doing that to her.|`|cV9HLhFZaa	YESSSS.<br>  Breasts the most though, I never notice boys staring at my butt since it is behind me XD.<br>  Like once I wore this shirt, and some cleavage was showing..and guys were going bananas...my boobs arn't even big!<br>  Men are pigs children.|`|kPalo5Kiaa	no not annoyed they are stupid though its like they dont even realize they are doin it but weneva they do it i give them a wtf are u starin at look|`|30RlXHX3aa	YES!

uByn7FUZaa	My opinion would be that the best Deep Purple album is    Machine Head    the worst -  Come taste the band - it's  just too funky for Purple.    Underrated - Who do we think we are.     I do love Burn and Stormbringer and Made in Europe,  but as  good as they were the best Deep Purple era for me is when the MK II line up was together for the first time they made four stunning albums in that period and were just never quite the same even when they reformed in the mid '80s. The battle rages on is an okay album, but it was onto a loser no matter what given that the band were only together through duress both from band members and their record company who both told Blackmore that Ian Gillan was back in the band no matter what he did or said. There is  no wonder that it was more than a little of a disappointment to fans how could it otherwise?|`|ZgBmHZgmaa	I would agree with you there    The best is defo burn  The worst is defo the battle rages om      I dont think come taste the band is that underrated
e60754e2c47d3732e670fc3cfec1373eaa	i know how you feel, i've been puttin on music alot more than normal since my miscarriage. it temporarily picks me up. i think its cos i'm concentrating on the songs rather than my problems (even tho they're still there and no amount of music is gonna make it go away). its a good way for the brain to thik of something different and uplifting (unless your listening to celine dion or james blunt), lol. currently i'm listening to ndubz- uncle b, lol and pink- i'm not dead albums. its my wee way of escaping the prison inside my own head. hope your well hun x and yes this is horrendous. thought i mite of been pregnant again (been ttc since it happened basically), but no, yet again my prayers were ignored. AF came yesterday afternoon ;(|`|sk46uigvaa	Yeah i love listening to Boys 2 men that always cheers me up!    my friend lost her baby girl, full term yesterday, so im feeling low as well.      Music always helps!    xx|`|onkUcy19aa	I love music too, and my choices range from the sublime to the stupid, as some of my friends have been telling me. You see, I love classical music, Beethoven, Chopin, Mozart, Haydn, you name them and I seem to know them as I have a large collection of them. I also love the modern music, and even the music of Carlos Santana. How about hip hop, well, I also like them, even Eminem. My problems seem to vanish when I hear music. Is it because music is food for the soul?     Good luck to you. God bless you.|`|0E6u2YOGaa	Listening to music that you like releases hormones in your brain called endorphines.    These are 'mood enhancers' and give you a little lift.    Other things that release endorphines are chocolate, laughter, and sex. It's true!|`|XO4talxxaa	Music has always had a effect on my feelings!

iCqfmRC3aa	Not only am I in favor of family oriented nudist resorts ... I raised my 3 children in a nudist environment.  They have all turned out to be great kids and now super parents in their own rights. In our society, children are natural nudists ... until they are "taught" that their body is something of which they should be ashamed. This often results in body image problems. <br>  <br>  True nudists emphasize a decent, family atmosphere and morality.<br>  <br>  Research shows that children who grow up in a nudist setting tend to be more self-confident, more self-accepting, and more sexually well-adjusted.  They feel better about their bodies, and more comfortable with their sexuality.<br>  <br>  Additionally, research conducted at the University of Northern Iowa found that nudist children had body self-concepts that were significantly more positive than those of non-nudist children--and that the "nudity classification" of a family was one of the most significant factors associated with positive body self-concept. Furthermore, nudist children showed a significantly higher acceptance of their bodies as a whole, rather than feeling ashamed of certain parts.<br>  <br>  When you go to a resort that is sanctioned by the American Association for Nude Recreation (aanr) you can be assured that your children will be supervised, not only by you, but by every nudist in attendence.  They are safer at a nudist resort then anywhere else you could take them.<br>  <br>  Most nudists are college educated, business professionals and they don't put up with any behavior that doesn't fit "family oriented".<br>  <br>  If you disagree with family oriented nude recreation, then you are in the minority.  Fully 74% of Americans agree that nude recreation is appropriate in areas set aside for that purpose.  <br>  <br>  40 Million Americans freely admit to having skinny-dipped (gone swimming naked) with the opposite sex.<br>  <br>  The New York Times had their readers vote on the best articles for 2008 and guess what rated number 4 ... Nude vacations.<br>  <br>  Family oriented nude recreation is a mainstream activity.  The Federal Government allows nudity in Federally enforced areas.  There are Federal, State and County regulated nudist and clothing optional beaches available in New Jersey, Oregon, California, Florida and Canada. I'm sure there are others, but these are the ones I'm familiar with right now.<br>  <br>  Our natural state is nudity, to be dressed we have to cover our bodies with artifical clothing.  This is the era of being green, what is more green then wearing nothing that causes a carbon footprint. Our naked bodies cause no ill effects on our environment ... and it feels really good to walk naked in the sunshine.<br>  <br>  So, lose the clothes and come on in, the water's fine|`|WuBQNC10aa	The vast majority of Nudist Clubs are in fact very family friendly places. There are adult-oriented resorts as well, but these places are in the minority when compared to "typical" nude recreation. <br>  <br>  I've been to many nudist and clothing-optional clubs, beaches, and resorts. At every one (except once) there were children present, not in great numbers, and not always nude. However, the kids I've encountered ranged from little ones to older teens and none of them ever seemed uncomfortable or harmed by being there. There are plenty of kids at the club I currently belong to and they act no differently than kids their own age who are not nudists. <br>  <br>  Sex offenders tend to not visit established nudist clubs. Every club I've been to makes visitors present ID upon arrival. While they can't obviously perform a background check on the spot, should anything happen, a record of the offender being at the club is on file. That alone is usually enough to keep the pervs away. Similarly, nudist are very protective and watch out for each others' kids. They also respect the kids and don't put themselves in a position where something can happen. Last year I was in the sauna by myself when some of the tweens at the club wanted to come in. Rather than hog the sauna or put myself in an uncomfortable position, I let the kids have it to themselves. Other adults do the same, and often the kids will reciprocate if they see adults waiting to use the sauna as well. For the most part everyone respects each others' space and privacy. <br>  <br>  Nudism isn't for everyone, but it certainly is not bad for children. Kids who grow up in a nudist environment tend to be very open about their feelings, have better self-esteem than thier peers, and tend to be very non-judgemental when it comes to a person's appearance or economic status. At least this seems to be the case with most nudist children and adult nudists who were raised in a nudist environment that I have met over the years.|`|AA11971497	Not only am I in favor of nudist resorts which are family friendly, I would never go to one which wasn't.  It's much more relaxing and friendly to go where everyone is on their best behavior.  Kids are natural nudists and it's important to not let society complete their indoctrination of self-shame and intolerance.  It is a place where pedophiles would quickly become bored, hated, and ejected.  Where children have learned enormous respect for themselves and others, and where everyone there looks out for them.  Where without the least shame most of them will quickly rat out any one they don't feel comfortable with.  <br>  <br>  A good resort is a pedophiles fantasy, turned into his worse nightmare.  He'll wind up in the hands of the police quicker there, than anywhere else.|`|dmxHQ0kTaa	It sounds gross to involve family members seems like insest to involve kids seems like child abuse but to just be adults sounds like a good time.|`|PEz2YMeXaa	There are places where families walk around nude ?<br>  <br>  I'm not in favor of seeing gram-pa's saggy penis, not to mention watching 12 year old Ashley walking around in her b-day suit.<br>  <br>  I was going to insult you but then I read your display name|`|MUuKSFgvaa	Against.<br>  <br>  Why?<br>  <br>  Disgusting.|`|A2qhd5SRaa	That sounds a little weird. I love nude beaches but damn, the whole family??|`|7AK6qQ3Raa	big deal|`|ee2eb688bade7663b57e940f752dc454aa	I grew up in one. All the female members of my family ran around the house in various stages of undress. Interestingly, none of the males did.<br>  Outside the house, we all covered up.<br>  I have never been to an "official" nudist resort and don't plan on going. <br>  I and my siblings all turned out as normal as anyone from our family could! (LOL)|`|yMRY5cgxaa	Why would it be harmful? Exposing people to the body that God created is it such a bad thing? Well you say it takes away the mystic of the female form... It causes people to go crazy and rape everybody...<br>  It makes a whole new dimension to flatulence...  It makes all the nudists sex fiends... Been once done that not for me but it equalized all and after the initial uncomfortableness it seemed normal and free...  And no I didn't think it is harmful in any way just the opposite|`|xUGisBr6aa	well not family oriented since theres gonna be kids there... thats like calling all pedophiles.|`|ewOD5x0taa	I think it's gross and weird personally, but whatever, let people do what they want.|`|AA10838250	not a big deal|`|uaq8OSUjaa	Family oriented nudist resorts..<br>  <br>  Isn't that like, an oxymoron?|`|10f326a8d361451c48ca6d61e9c457e0aa	Sounds ok to me.  It will depend how you do it, of course.  If we grew up in a culture where "nudity" is a big deal we will see things differently than would a person who grew up in a culture where "nudity" means no clothes.  Maybe clothes optional.  Kids will learn that you get cold at night and sun-burned during the day but that is something everyone should realize.  The culture I live in (California) will put permanent sanctions against you if you are convicted by a jury of displaying your penis in a public place.  Men generally have penises, a natural reproductive organ beloved of their girlfriends in private, yet are officially considered too horrible to display.  It can be confusing and even harmful to subject children to this weirdness.|`|hHGNE0IRaa	I am for it. I think nudity is only a problem because our western society let religion program out standards. Now we are stuck with the moronic Christian standard of morality, what ever the hell morality even means.  It depends on the culture and year you live in.|`|cf5961a316debfb7203fffd630bd740caa	it depends. if the place is regulated and there are no chances of a sex offendor getting in, then i think it's fine. not for me personally, but to each their own.|`|BZwJeuMGaa	children walk around nude infront of adults?<br>  <br>  <br>  what if there are pedifiles? .. its kind of disturbing

482ec953acc2110dc059d6f3bd500670aa	20 seconds is a fairly long time to keep exact timing. I don't think it's that unnatural to be a little fast or slow. Some people have really good timing; I've heard of drummers who can keep almost exact time throughout an entire song, but those people are rare. To hone your skills, practice playing with a metronome. This will force you to play on time, and believe it or not, it will help you play better even when you don't have a metronome of something else to help you keep time.|`|f43c96b57d6818d49b6021efbffb0491aa	i think that's a common problem, that's also how i practice with guitar, i mute the music and try to play along with it... but i also end up either being ahead or late...<br>  <br>  I think all you need to do is practice on it...my friend who teaches me also used to have trouble with that and now she's the best guitarist in our school..

Raging Bull--this is the cinematic masterpiece which made Martin Scorsese. It immortalized middleweight contender Jake LaMotta and turned 'The Bronx Bull' into a household name. I can not say enough good things about this film. The anger, turmoil and frustration of waiting over ten years before receiving a title shot against Marcel Cerdan is laid bare for all the world to see. His jealousy, paranoia, abusive treatment towards his trophy wife casts Jake as a villain and a cad. <br>  <br>  2. The Breakfast Club--Great comedy and drama about high school teenagers who served a day in detention on Saturday. They had absolutely nothing in common but by 3 p.m. they laid out their souls to each other when they were perfect strangers with nothing in common at the beginning of the day. <br>  <br>  3. Robocop--I loved this film and though the sequels were grossly disappointing this was an epic sci-fi film. Detroit awash in violent crime; a striking police force ready to bring the city to its knees and OCP a private corporation headed by a hot-shot wiz kid ready to make a robot model which will save the city.

And there families are sometimes connected, like the doctor and the pregnant woman share the same father but don't know it, but it's definitely not a soap opera!<br>  <br>  And some characters are connected to the complex island already.<br>  <br>  You should start from Season 1!|`|LBovv7Sxaa	there's an actual monster on the island that kills people and rips GIANT trees out of the ground and THROWS them reeeally high up in the air.<br>  <br>  there's a repeated recording of a french woman saying "they're all dead. it killed them all. please help me." and it's been on repeat for 15+ years.<br>  <br>  and LOST deals heavily with time travel.<br>  way better than any time travel movie i've ever seen (Back to the Future, Donnie Darko, and the Terminator movies).<br>  <br>  but you seriously need to watch EVERY single episode in order.<br>  it's the only way to understand it all and not be so confused.<br>  i've seen every episode about 6 times because i got all my friends to watch (but they couldn't watch it at the same time).<br>  so i've got a perfect understanding of the show.|`|NLXhW9rBaa	I watched it for a long time and got addicted then missed a few episodes and I literately was LOST.

Ow3O7h4caa	Your Mars position shows you where you exert the most energy and since it is in Libra, you assert what is right and wrong with force. The house your Libra is in is the area where your energy will show the most.|`|lpyWVR2oaa	In a sense, it is weak not because it can't initiate (Libra is afterall a Cardinal Sign), but because like the Sun, Mars needs a focal point and focus all its energies in one direction. Libra is a dual sign which puts too much emphasis on weighing the options available and keeping the peace/harmony in tact. Hence, Mars in Libra has the tendency to vacillate and seem very indecisive as it is concerned about the consequences of its actions.<br>  <br>  If this doesnt sound like you, there're probably other indicators (fire element, cardinal signs, conjunctions etc) in your chart which make up for this Mars placement.<br>  <br>  Mars in Sagittarius/9th House|`|E2VUH8Q0aa	Actually Mars in Libra indicates a "swinging" of the energy back and forth, between aggression and passivity. <br>  It's considered a difficult placement for Mars because the energy can't assert itself consistently. Once asserted, the Mars in Libra native tends to regret or retract the force of the decision, and basically pulls back on the follow-through. This is also how the energy is expressed in relationships..comes on strong, a bit weak on the follow-through.|`|HuXMiJLpaa	Mars in Libra isn't a weak position, but neither Libra (nor Taurus) feel comfortable in Mars because Libra's natural ruler is venus which is the complete opposite of mars. I know the the most comfortable signs in Mars are Aries, Scorpio, and Capricorn. Capricorn is exalted in Mars and the fall (detriment) is in Cancer, so Cancer would actually be the more appropriate "weak" mars sign. But, you should consider the aspects to mars in your chart and in what house mars is in.|`|84726b724d7d1fd7da09652c50425c38aa	I read that it was a weak position for mars.<br>  <br>  I have a Mars in Aries. I'm very assertive too. Sometimes I can be aggressive but I try not to be. My first instinct is to always defend myself.|`|lcuxD3qlaa	Your just like my mother! Mars is actually not like "Weak" but its certainly not the strongest position...thats all|`|R2hbZi1Faa	Mine is in Aries and I am also very assertive and I speak my mind without thinking ahead...I'm an up-front type of person, very direct when it comes to love for example...many people get scared of this direct approach...My ex had Libra in Mars and he was very closed up about his feelings...that's all I know

Em5WZlY2aa	I'm going to assume that you mean A in the staff. You use your pointer finger and push the key above the first finger hole. Email me if you need any more help :)|`|W4UxFNNoaa	Ahh that cool that your teaching yourself. Use the first finger still on your left hand, and just flip it up to the key above the first hole. Be sure not to have any of the back keys either. Be careful not to get the key which is slightly set off to the side, as that is an a sharp hit the one directly above the first key hole. The note you have described is a f sharp. A good book that I would suggest for you to use instead to learn clarinet is abracdabra clarinet, this is the one I used, as I would highly reccomend it, as it shows the notes clearly, and also gives a few pieces after each new note so you get use ot the note and combines it with ones that are in the book before it so you will already know them. they are simple but effective tunes that really help, as by the time i got half way through I was able to do my grade 2, and that was in 8 months =) If you need anymore help or advice, im here for you to contact if you wish.

Chris Brown deserves punishment for his actions. I don't think it's right to completely disown him and protest him. He's human, all humans are capable of letting their anger get the best of them. He had a weak moment and let the anger take over. Now he's trying to get better and get help which speaks volumes. I'm not sticking up for what he did because it was wrong. I'm just saying that it doesn't make him a monster. I think he should take the punishment for the crime and we should leave him alone.)|`|9tZgQJsZaa	Im not sure if that picture is actually her.

She seriously needs a friken reality check here.  I hate that girl so badly, she is a talentless teen millionaire, and she is such a snob and an annoyance, and of course, she can't sing or act.

The only thing I like about her is that she has good style.<br>  <br>  Also the Jonas Brothers.  I really don't see what's so good about them.  They are just ugly teen stars, who are talentless as well, and need to wear less tight clothes, because obviously, they don't realize how gay it makes them look (not to be offensive to gay people, I am just saying that because all these teen girls think they have a chance with them, but not happening, they don't roll that way, haha).  Yeah, I think you get the point :)<br>  <br>  OH YEAH, and also all those Twilight stars.  I don't know if they are teens or not but they seriously annoy me how everybody is obsessing over them, especially that Robert guy, because they think he is so hot, but honestly, I think he's quote ugly.

UMBhfklTaa	i agree with you... i can go on and on about this forever, but to spare you, i won't. i'm not really sure what it will take for american idol to understand that we know danny's wife died, norman gentle is insane, scott mcintyre is blind, and tatiana is annoying as hell. then the show goes on to pimp certain contestants (again with danny, and lil rounds as well). it bothers me that we know these few so well, as they have been aired on every episode since auditions, while others like megan corkrey have had ZERO air-time. megan's audition was shown, and then we were left to wonder what happened to her, unless we watched closely for cameos and stuff. a lot of america is going to be swayed to vote for whoever is the most talked about, rather than who is the best singer. american idol needs to change this issue in the future.|`|piemZ36eaa	thats the whole point really<br>  it makes the show more interesting, allows them to pad out the show with cheap material, and makes the you feel like you know the people<br>  they either find them a sob story or make them out to be hard faced / snobby e.c.t|`|zdrXmriAaa	Yeah I agree with that. It makes us like certain contestants better, because we're more familiar with them than with others.<br>  But it's a bit unfair, because some people who do make it are unfamiliar so we don't really pay much attention to them.|`|jfdFOPCoaa	Before contestants get the chance to see the show's judges, they go through two rigorous sets of cuts: the first consists of a brief audition in front of one or two of the show's producers with three other contestants. Contestants are then either sent through to the next round of producers or are asked to leave. Only about 100–200 contestants in each city make it past this round, which is a staggering statistic considering that tens of thousands of people show up to audition in each city. <br>  That is when they decide if they like someone and want to film their info. Some make it and some don't. <br>  <br>  As far as seeing some ppl, like Danny, it does make me either like them more or dislike them even if they can sing. Seeing who someone is, how they are towards others or where they are from does draw you to them or make you realize you don't care for them. I think it can hurt others while some, like Danny whom I adore, can make you want them to win.|`|AA12365169	Well if they're an interesting person then they show more about them.|`|tC85s3zHaa	I agree!<br>  <br>  It makes you have almost more of a 'personal' connection with them and your own oppion on them!<br>  <br>   I can't stand Tatiana- she IS really crazy and spoiled and would make a horrid hollywood diva! ahhh!<br>  <br>  <br>  I don't know names yet (haha-I'm slow with that type of thing)<br>  but I like the blind guy that plays the piano.<br>  <br>  If the person had a difficulty in their life before hand, and now to reach this part in their lives, it makes you like them more- where as say Tatiana is just sooo annoying and thinks its all about her!<br>  <br>  So, yeah, I think Idol picks and chooses who will be in the limelight.<br>  <br>  Probably all the ones with an idol journey thing will make it high in the episodes.<br>  <br>  Norman Jentile-- he's a joke! He can't sing! he's funny, but its not a comedy show- its a singing show! I don't believe its fair that he's on.<br>  <br>  If he wins, he will be a flop like that Higgs guy and all the previous idols before him.<br>  Not many idol winners make it far like Carrie U. did and Kelly Clarkson.

They use electrical engineering, and they still sound constipated.<br>  <br>  I am a teenage girl, and I can't stand them.|`|duN63EkIaa	Well. Everyone enhances their voices in the recording studio. No one sounds like they do live than what is heard on their Album.<br>  <br>  Poser:<br>  Any one who does not follow his/her own ideas of what he/she likes. Following no one set norm makes you real and following no one set norm makes you poser. Poser is governed not by the clothes, music, or makeup you wear, but rather by the state of your mind and the conformity to your own beliefs. <br>  <br>  They are not posers. They're basically the most down the earth guys out there in hollywood today. Still the same boys from New Jersey. Can't say that about a lot of celebs in the same industry.|`|dejqLjaLaa	I know for sure they are not posers. They come up with all their songs (except for the covers), and I don't think they enhance their voices.

JOnas brothers are NOT god's gifts to earth but fans obviously will say that cuz tehy like em.. now if the fans BELIEVE that then they seriously gotta get a life or make sure to figure out where earth is.. ok first of all JBs dont compare to anyone that i know who are known as musicians but thats ok.. Because they DO have talent.. all u haters just shut up and listen. They are cool people k? my class mate knew them and they were tight. And all u that call them fags? shut up get a life and move on and quit commenting on threads like this then! look they HAVE TALENT! Just NOT TONS OF IT. They are not AMAZING they are another band just like the click five, simple plan or brothers hanson. dude they are a pop band we have hundreds of those.. its just that they have a genius producer that has put them way up there and it might be a mistake on disney's part. Joe has a really good voice! so get over it.. Kevin is a good guitarist! And Nick writes good songs!  (yes i know all there names and NOOO im not gay and NOOO im not a fan or anything) But see theyr'e not GREAT soo get over urselves haters as well AS ANNOYING FANS! just drop the subj. Haters drop it cuz by rising to the bait ur only giving em more publicity and fans just shut up .. THIS IS THE reason the JBs piss soo many of us off u guys keep on talking about them. THEY are NEVER EVER going to marry you, date you, love you, or even talk to u.. harsh? maybe.. True? MOST DEFINATELY! so shut up about em and just listen to their music. they do definately have some half decent songs ... so just quit with threads like this because its getting annyoing to read em and i can promise u that it will be ages before i ever respond to another one like this.|`|Qnxfe2S3aa	Personally, I dont like them and I never have.<br>  They annoy me, especially when everybody loves them.. they have purity rings and look at some of their songs. doesnt even make sense. i dont know why all the girls have obsessions with them.|`|M4fOvFQtaa	they are the most amazing creations of god...

He went into a medically induced coma and his finacee used her medical proxy to do a middle-ground procedure where they only removed the dead tissue from his leg, leaving him with a limp and no finacee.    2) Wilson's girlfriend went to pick up House from a bar when Wilson was on call at the hospital.  She took the bus with House (to make sure he didn't drive) and the bus was in an accident.  She died from the rtesulting injuries.|`|7a9ca1e0d676415430d900245a7c2d25aa	He had, basically a blood clot that killed some of the tissue in his leg.

If it is the lattaer, than write the one note for the entire lenth of the articulation (if it lasts two beats, then use a half note for example) - and on the stem, put three bold diagonal lines through the stem.    If the articulation is in a SPECIFIC RHYTHM, then write out the notes (like if it is a string of timed 64th notes for example)    If it is a finger trill between two notes, then write it as a trill.

( My grandmother was about 4 years old when it really happened. cool eh?)    The Sixth Sense--it just made me think in the end, if that were to happen to dead people--AGAIN, i was a kid.    The Da Vinci Code--I'm a Christain, i watched the movie anyway, thought it would be interesting, plus im a huge Tom Hanks fan, aside from my beliefs, the movie sucked.    Toy Story--yeah, saw this movie when i was a kid, always wondered if my toys ever had conversations or plotted against other toys everytime i was at school. it was always a mystery to me--peeking through my door, seeing if they ever moved.

umrXBkeMaa	I would think that if it is "epic" it needs to be a dramatic song that ideally is part of a dramatic album, and it has to be a song that "changed everything" for the rock world that followed it.    As a single song, I'd say "Bohemian Rhapsody" by Queen.    "Stairway to Heaven" by Led Zeppelin is also a good choice.    But the ultimate epic rock album w/ 9 fantastic epic rock songs is hands down "The Dark Side of the Moon" by Pink Floyd.  Every song is awesome, and collectively it is the most "complete" album ever made.    The singular epic album to create the whole new branch of Progressive Rock is absolutely "2112" by Rush.    The song that created a whole new genre of grunge was "Smells Like Teen Spirit" by Nirvana.    There are some good current commercial songs, but none is "epic" or groundbreaking.  Nearly all commercial music today is just copies of stuff that's been done to death.

7fXpLlhBaa	I swear it's like there is ecstasy on the pages! I really don't know, but if you want an analogy just look at Harry Potter. Why was THAT series so popular?

Twilight has been getting a lot of criticism and scoffing lately, give it a break. It was okay when it was the Harry Potter frenzy!|`|T16Zmtc3aa	It because it's a romance book for tweens.  Nothing like Harry Potter which actually builds a complex plot from the first book with many diverse characters...

pMnqewy2aa	Jailbreaking iPods means to hack them. Jailbreaking sort of "Unlocks" your iPod touch or iPhone. It allows you to Download applications from 3rd parties, except, unlike the app store, you don't get charged for downloading any of the applications. The only real downside to doing it is it voids you iPod touch/iPhone's warranty, in case you break it.|`|7761a0e82f2aca8d02650411bc0f2fafaa	You install applications that you can't buy from Apple.

TyydcRfeaa	The Notebook is  one of those romantic flicks that often come out, it is a brilliantly written intriguing story about two young lovers that most people can relate to.<br>  Even most males ( including me), will agree that this movie pulls at your heart strings. Filled with fabulous quotes, and sentimental moments I found this movie to be one of the best I've seen. I got to know both main characters and found myself relating to each of them. Most of us remember our first love and that strong connection we had with them. This movie makes us think of what could have been and gives us a fresh look at the meaning of true love. I recommend this movie to anyone with a heart.<br>  <br>  The other romantic   movies you should watch :<br>  - Teh Englsih Patient<br>  - Pleasantville<br>  - She's All That<br>  - Atonement<br>  - All Julia Roberts' movie (Notting Hill, Pretty Woman, Runaway Bride)<br>  -Legally Blonde|`|tLI94qWNaa	The holiday <br>  The princess bride <br>  Penelope <br>  Intolerable cruelty|`|SEzMrFrbaa	notebook<br>  atonement<br>  revolutionary road<br>  american beauty<br>  english patient|`|rabjcdjHaa	27 Dresses (2008) <br>  Made of Honor (2008)<br>  What Happens in Vegas (2008)<br>  Never Been Kissed (1999)|`|GQD3TLmGaa	Sense and sensibility,twilight,knights tale,and down to you.|`|56bNLJykaa	Cinema Paradiso<br>  La Dolce Vita <br>  Bread and Tulips<br>  Il Postino|`|dFCZCB6Faa	the notebook,|`|y5kXh0QEaa	50 First Dates and Jerry Maguire are two recent classics in my mind.

ab250551cde4aadbf54a0fea8a7b14e1aa	Sissy Spacek (Alice Aimes) plays the mother of Charlize Theron (Josey Aimes).<br>  <br>  Without telling too much, this is just the beginning of the movie:<br>  Josie's life leaves much to be desired when we see her waiting by the Christmas tree with her pre-adolescent son and younger daughter, alone in the house. Her husband drives up. And we next see her lying on the floor bloody after he has beaten her. At that point, she wastes no time packing up her stuff into her pick up truck and moving herself and the kids out of there never to return. They move to her parent's home in northern Minnesota. This living arrangement is not much better. At the very least, she and the kids are safe from her husband. But the minute her father observes her face, he has to ask her if the husband caught her with another man. He clearly has no respect, whatsoever for his daughter. Her mother, more nurturing, encourages her daughter to reconcile with her husband and take him back, without regard for the fact that he is abusive. Neither parent, at this point in the movie, is truly supportive of their daughter.|`|gMYoi210aa	<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1g0e7mDUy0" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1g0e7mDU...</a>
YUjVFkocaa	We learned this in my film study class....<br>  <br>  there were different eras of movies, like the "silent" era, the "color" era when they first got movies, there were many golden ages....<br>  <br>  and we currently are in the "blockbuster" era.  The name was coined because it "busted" the blocks and sold a lot of tickets... we are getting out of the bad movie slump of the 90s currently, where they had movies like "run away from the big spider" and low-budget crap like that.<br>  <br>  And since all of the movies recently are often being very expensive, and the technology is very good now, and the special effects are incredible.... SO MANY MORE MOVIES are becoming good (or at least becomign EASIER to be good).....<br>  <br>  therefore there are more blockbuster movies... and therefore, we are in the "blockbuster era" currently.  <br>  <br>  ======================<br>  <br>  In short: It busts the blocks, as in 2 meanings: 1, 'everybody on the block' goes to see it... 2, it busts the charts for ticket sales.|`|56bNLJykaa	Large production Hollywood movies that attract large general audiences.. I often don't like them|`|TyydcRfeaa	Blockbuster, as applied to film or theater, denotes a very popular and/or successful production. The term was originally derived from theater slang referring to a particularly successful play but is now used primarily by the film industry.

There's a lot of Emo singers out there now,though, Panic at the Disco, HIM, etc. But,then again, none of them sing like this guy. He does have an amazing voice. He kind of reminds me of a cross between Constantine Maroulis (minus the cheese :p) and Lukas Rossi from Rockstar SuperNova (without the skunk-hair :p). Plus, he is kinda hot, I have to admit :). I hope it comes down to him and Danny Gokey.|`|9XjtEdEqaa	He is definitely the most unique. He has the personality, the looks, and the voice.

I'm a big fan actually.|`|pLPKo6mBaa	TBM is a really great band, better than most think I think. A lot of people listen to the well-known songs, like "Blue" and "Looking Glass" and consider them to be an electronic gothic band, but though they have that darker tinge to their music and lyrics, the term synthpop really defines them.<br>  <br>  I hear they're releasing a new album this fall - can't wait!<br>  <br>  They've done a few remixes and things with other bands like MSI, Dope Stars Inc, etc. I particularly liked "The Knight Murders" with Vanity Beach.
dejqLjaLaa	I wasn't such a huge fan before, I just liked some of his songs like, "Forever". But after seeing pictures of Rihanna, I hope he gets what he deserves.|`|97iJN1Csaa	TMZ is messed up.<br>  They should'nt be posting people's pictures like that.<br>  Rumors were that she has a black eye no where in that picture does she have a black eye so my guess is that that pic has been a little "photoshoped" but then again that is solely based on my opinion...Is anyone looking at this face as swollen from crying.. is anyone wonder what she was hit with... Does anyone else see the two slightly curved marks/bruises on the side of her head over her eyes. These are some kind of impression and not made with a hand or fist... Something strange is going on. As light as she is she should be purple and blue all over.... This is not a horrific beating...|`|9gsm05lnaa	Who said he left those bruises on her face?

The exact software used often changes, but usually the base is 3DS Max and maya.<br>  <br>  For instance ILM used the following for transformers;<br>  3ds max, Maya and other "inhouse software", Zeno and Pixologic Zbrush with RenderMan and Mental Ray <br>  <br>  Inhouse software is usually used for breaking the limitations of the basic software. For instance, fur is a real hard issue, and often ILM will have to build a add on program just to handle it.

6qsTmMQaaa	Like dance or die has already mentioned, The Maine is a really good band. They're not exactly like 3OH!3, as 3OH!3 is a lot more punk-ish, but The Maine is still pretty good. Also, like WhoKnows? said, Hollywood Undead has a similar sound to 3OH!3. The band is more similar to 3OH!3 than The Maine is, but they're still good. I also really like Buckcherry, which has a somewhat similar sound.<br>  <br>  If you like alternative-rock music, you should also check out Cobra Starship, The Offspring, Tokio Hotel, The Raconteurs, All Time Low, The Bravery and Cute Is What We Aim For. If you want a band with a girl singer, but that is alternative-rock, then check out Evanescence, The Ting Tings and Flyleaf.|`|SyoBirYDaa	"3OH!3" isn't a good band, so here's a list of terrible bands if that's what you into.<br>  1.)Linkin Park<br>  2.)Fallout Boy<br>  3.)My Chemical Romance<br>  4.)Three Days Grace<br>  5.)Panic At The Disco<br>  6.)Paramore|`|v588UNt6aa	"3OH!3" isn't a good band, so here's a list of terrible bands if that's what you into. <br>  1.)Linkin Park <br>  2.)Fallout Boy <br>  3.)My Chemical Romance <br>  4.)Three Days Grace <br>  5.)Panic At The Disco <br>  6.)Paramore|`|rjsfiWt9aa	All time low<br>  The Maine<br>  Family force five<br>  Every Avenue|`|eOSmEBqwaa	Hollywood Undead has a similar sound

lkmOWkk4aa	Well, you know how it is now alot of people hate one metal band and like the others. Also metal is one of the most poular genres so alot of people are gonna judge bands an example a heavy metal fan might hate NU- metal or vice versa also i guess its about uniqueness like slipknot. they wear masks and have alot of powerful meanings in there songs so people can relate to them. i know the wife of oli herbert (the guitarist from all that remains) and she says when they come back from tours they have no money because they have to split it between them for food supplies etc so thats mostly why|`|xYIyv66Naa	Yeah...Those bands arent really metal at all. Try Rainbow, Black Sabbath, Dio's solo work, Judas Priest for proper metal. This is tripe.|`|r94ESFlRaa	It comes down to preference. The world is too in deep with this rap and hip-hop junk that they'll ignore other genres like metal, rock, country, jazz, etc... Thanks to Guitar Hero, Rock and metal is slowly rising but rap is still on top. The world is too blinded by all the rap crap. There's only a small percentage, atleast compared to rap, listen and appreciate metal.|`|B0RpzBdHaa	Not to be a douche, but metal is more than just Dio and Sabbath.<br>  I don't think metal is as popular as you think.  Think about it.  Everywhere you go you're surrounded by crappy Justin Timberlake or Hannah Montana, etc.  They make a bit of money every time you're hearing that song.  How often does a person just by chance hear a Lamb of God song?  Never.  Only if they have it on a metal show/station.|`|ITYcemuVaa	maybe it's  harder to listen to i'm always online listen in to whatever they don't play mainstream but that sucks wouldn't ya think the record company might give them at least a place to practice|`|X05GAaLeaa	Because most main stream artists parents have the money to pay for someone to write the songs and have a top producer record the songs i mean look at Britney Spears , her parents were well off b4 she got famous and other like the faggoty *** jonas brothers and miley cyrus<br>  all their parents have money for that<br>  most metal bands require talent to become famous , and they have to work for it instead of handing some "agent" a wad of cash<br>  It costs them money for equipment and everything<br>  they loose a lot of money(that they dont even have)n the process of becoming famous/noticed<br>  Look at other metal bands and their childhoods <br>  most of them were middle class or even poor

bjcjQ4zfaa	Leonard Cohen.<br>  <br>  He is my favorite artist, yes, but the man is a genius. His songwriting is excellent, his lyrics are the kind you get chills reading. Some don't like his voice, but if you listen to him you grow to love it.<br>  <br>  His career spans like 4 decades so his voice changes and so does the type of music he writes. I will try to give you some songs to sample each decade (my personal favorite was him in the 60's,80's and 2000's, completely different person too)<br>  <br>  1. 1960's - Stranger Song: <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RLq7Aqd_H7g&fmt=18" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RLq7Aqd_H...</a><br>  <br>  2. 1970's - Famous Blue Raincoat: <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiODhEHn530&fmt=18" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiODhEHn5...</a><br>  <br>  3. 1980's - Hallelujah: <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzWeN-bVDUc" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzWeN-bVD...</a><br>  <br>  5. 1990's - Anthem: <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tjtE2-dLjSs&fmt=18" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tjtE2-dLj...</a><br>  <br>  6. 2000's - In My Secret Life: <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sLR7CZvgYOc&fmt=18" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sLR7CZvgY...</a>|`|YWjhqlxbaa	Check out Muse. <br>  <br>  Muse lyric's are pretty deep.<br>  <br>  Check out their Absolution album...<br>  <br>  Deep stuff|`|w6weeb7Daa	Bob Dylan is the best song writer ever.
84cab3e19692da71ddb2837fa88afa2baa	Your best bet is to look at their discography.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paramore_discography" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paramore_di...</a><br>  <br>  <br>  They have two albums, two live albums, and one EP.  I have all of their CD's, but probably not all their songs.  I don't have the actual physical disc for Twilight like all of their other CD's, but I downloaded "Decode" off of iTunes so I have that to.  I'm sure they have lots of material that didn't make it onto their albums, as well as some songs they've just written but not ever considered releasing yet.  Some bands will put together all their unreleased music and release it after they've been around a while so may take a while before we see some of their stuff.  But definitely get all their studio/live albums and their EP.  And download "Decode" off of iTunes if you don't want to buy the Twilight Soundtrack.  The Live CD that was released in the U.S. "The Final Riot" has a DVD with it of the concert and it's GREAT!|`|s2Ko7tPDaa	<a href="http://artists.letssingit.com/paramore-8phr5/songs" rel="nofollow">http://artists.letssingit.com/paramore-8...</a><br>  you just type in the artist|`|WU70UwEWaa	Here is their Discography:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paramore_discography" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paramore_di...</a><br>  <br>  and the link to the song lyrics:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.metrolyrics.com/paramore-lyrics.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.metrolyrics.com/paramore-lyri...</a><br>  <br>  1 Adore Lyrics  <br>  2 All We Know Lyrics  <br>  3 Another Day Lyrics  <br>  4 Born For This Lyrics  <br>  5 Breathe Lyrics  <br>  6 Brighter Lyrics  <br>  7 Circle Lyrics  <br>  8 Conspiracy Lyrics  <br>  9 Crush Crush Crush Lyrics  <br>  10 Decode Lyrics  <br>  11 Decoy Lyrics  <br>  12 Emergency Lyrics  <br>  13 Fences Lyrics  <br>  14 For A Pessimist I'm Pretty Optimistic Lyrics  <br>  15 Franklin Lyrics  <br>  16 Hallelujah Lyrics  <br>  17 Hello Hello Lyrics  <br>  18 Here We Go Again Lyrics  <br>  19 Here We Go Again (Live In Anaheim) Lyrics  <br>  20 I Caught Myself Lyrics  <br>  21 Just Like Me Lyrics  <br>  22 Lazy Lyrics  <br>  23 Let The Flames Begin Lyrics  <br>  24 Let This Go Lyrics  <br>  25 Love's Not A Competition (but I'm Winning) Lyrics  <br>  26 Miracle Lyrics  <br>  27 Miracle Outro Lyrics  <br>  28 Misery Buisness Lyrics  <br>  29 Misery Business Lyrics  <br>  30 My Heart Lyrics  <br>  31 My Hero Lyrics  <br>  32 Never Let This Go Lyrics  <br>  33 Number One Lyrics  <br>  34 Oh Star Lyrics  <br>  35 Perfect Lyrics  <br>  36 Pressure Lyrics  <br>  37 Rewind Lyrics  <br>  38 Stay Away Lyrics  <br>  39 Stop This Song Lyrics  <br>  40 Stuck On You Lyrics  <br>  41 Sunday Bloody Sunday Lyrics  <br>  42 Swim In Silence Lyrics  <br>  43 Temporary Lyrics  <br>  44 Thats What You Get Lyrics  <br>  45 This Circle Lyrics  <br>  46 Throwing Punches Lyrics  <br>  47 Until Tomorrow Lyrics  <br>  48 We Are Broken Lyrics  <br>  49 When It Rains Lyrics  <br>  50 Whoa Lyrics
PF6yKkVDaa	I play guitar, mostly death metal, and I've played with 2 or 3 different drummers and I've only seen a couple of cymbals actually get cracked. Dented yes, but even then it didn't really affect the sound quality. Stick with good quality cymbals and you shouldn't have any problems.|`|A3axVsjuaa	I have a B8 14" i think, its cracked so many times(i think 5 now). I just keep drilling it, and need to do so again, lol. It more depends on the metal. I have a thin crash i play the hell out of, and its bent to hell, but not cracked. thicker cymbals crack easier (usually) cuz they're made of layers. thin ones are fewer layers, or one solid piece. but i play heavily so maybe thats just me.  <br>  <br>  Oh, and Joey Jordison of Slipknot|`|k7jGZydJaa	I don't play drums, but Adam Carson said they do.|`|2FIbamFgaa	I don't play, but I have a friend that does.  He has pretty thin cymbals, and they're CRAZY dented. It looks more like one of those samurai hat things than a cymbal.<br>  <br>  Neil Peart or Mike Portnoy are two of my favorite drummers.

I know TONS of Aries that are police officers. They balance well, are in tune with their emotions and genuinely care about the well being of others. <br>  I would say Cancers (outside of their moodiness) because of their sincerity and their need for sharing and developing a relationship with others. <br>  <br>  Sun sign: Scorpio|`|r8LJEJwbaa	I would say Cancer! Cancers always want to be there for you, and from the books I've read and the people I've met, they are very protective and they want to keep you safe.<br>  <br>  Don't even thumbs down me you buttholes because I'm right...do your freaking research!|`|jH8hIB0kaa	NO POLITICIANS ALLOWED is the sign that would make me feel most protected.|`|GA9thdj2aa	Sagittarius cuz thats the one person that I always feel safe with sign.|`|bYbSVvR4aa	Scorpios.

pARrxwZOaa	<a href="http://www.onemanga.com/Naruto/381/03/" rel="nofollow">http://www.onemanga.com/Naruto/381/03/</a><br>  <br>  As you see there, those swords just mess up your chakra control so you can't use jutsus.  <br>  <br>  I got a few theories in my head.<br>  <br>  I'm thinking that Naruto is going to kill Deva pain, and Nagato gets all the chakra from Deva and isn't skinny anymore.  Instead of being skinny he breaks out of the machine and becomes stronger.  <br>  <br>  OR<br>  <br>  Naruto goes Kyuubi for some reason.  Like he realizes that the Kyuubi kinda is his power since it was born in him or something.  <br>  <br>  OR <br>  <br>  Naruto lift his hands out of the sword and regenerates and says some speech and kills deva.<br>  <br>  OR<br>  <br>  Shikamaru and co.  find Nagato and kills him.  Hope Konan won't be a problem.<br>  <br>  OR<br>  <br>  Sasuke comes and shows that he still cares for the village and helps naruto out.  <br>  <br>  OR<br>  <br>  Naruto still has a clone somewhere getting ready to attack.|`|RfVXW8yUaa	Hmm, the newest chapter just came out today on mangafox.com<br>  <br>  <br>  <spoilers><br>  It showed Pein's real form, and since the one Naruto is fighting isn't the real Pein...I guess Jiraya's student who was going to change the world would be Pein and he's going to beat Naruto...(with the way things are going I wouldn't be surprised...)

My mom still believes in the evil twin theory and that Zach is not who he says he is but I don't know.
0BoDF6iBaa	The soundtrack for the movie was never released.

31TUT9lpaa	1) tv shows are expensive, especially Lost and Family Guy<br>  <br>  2) Lost is going to end soon so they decides to only do 16 episodes a year until the end next year<br>  <br>  3) the writer strike caused certain shows to return but with fewer episodes because they never had time to make alot of them and they needed something to fill in the spots!|`|BUCvr0R8aa	It's because they suck and no one watches them but a few.|`|OdDJv5ouaa	These shows are very popular.

414c24d7cf47b8318b8d19b4d22f2f62aa	You might be thinking of "Le Petit Prince," which is a French story by Antoine de Saint-Exupéry.  It was translated into English and made into a cartoon called "The Little Prince."  The prince lives on an asteroid/planet and falls in love with a rose, which would fit your basic description.  When I was in high school some of my friends read "Le Petit Prince" in French class and the cover art always reminded me of a moon. <br>  <br>  Also check out this youtube video.  It seems very similar to what you are describing. The address is: <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SiUxtUV1o-s&feature=related" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SiUxtUV1o...</a> <br>  <br>  Hope this helps.|`|Jteqao3zaa	thumbelina is the only thing i can think of where a small woman lives in a flower|`|IX4mSxEMaa	That is only the one of the most classic children's novel XD  It's call The Little Prince ^_^<br>  <br>  Oh and also... as far as cartoon/anime/animation goes.  I also remember seeing at anime re-run of it.  According to wiki, that same series had also played in US and Europe in the 80's so that may have been the one you watched.

Which is completely ridiculous.<br>  <br>  But, whatever...|`|GaCVB3mtaa	haha...spiderman! he would web him then do something.lol|`|DtXM9xMhaa	Spiderman; hands down.|`|ONELYod7aa	Wolverine would as he can't die. spiderman would be tired by the end|`|i210xqkgaa	Spider-man would win. wolverine is powerful and can recover from attacks almost instantly. but spider-man is more agile and he can do a wide variety of things with those fancy webs of his. against spidey, wolverine's claw things would be a useless weapon as spider-man can easily dodge them, and wolverine seems to really rely on them in fights. besides, in Spider-man: Web Of Shadows, spider-man is able to defeat a symbiote infected wolverine who is even more powerful than usual.

xqrwDmyUaa	I don't think it matters if she has herpes or not, he is a stupid, coward as*hole for hitting her. He should be charged and she should sue him. I hope his career is over. I can't believe there are people on here defending his disgusting actions saying "you don't know what happened", no but I know he beat the sh*t out of her and what more do you need to know, there is no excuse for that. He shouldn't get special treatment for being famous.|`|iJXFZx7taa	Oh puhlease.<br>  <br>  She does NOT have herpes.<br>  It is called a joke that some 4chan idiot made up and spread around.|`|Pz8rIt26aa	There is no proof of anything like that. I don't even know where that rumor started. I would seriously doubt she had herpes for a couple of reasons:<br>  1. It would hurt her career-and Chris Brown's--so I bet she'd be careful.<br>  2.She's not a ****.There are no pictures of her out with men at all.<br>  <br>  If anything if she did have it--I bet he gave it to her. He's the player. I mean if he finds out he has herpes, what's to stop him from saying "Oh, I got it from you". Men do it all the time. When in fact he could've gotten it from one of his little groupies and then GIVEN it to her.|`|SSbeC1Xxaa	No, she didn't get herpes from her actions, it was chris brown who gave her herpes.|`|ZNcW8aFWaa	LOL!<br>  she has herpes? <br>  well im not surprised.

a2c8bbb24610178840fdeb550558efe6aa	Aquí va tu respuesta...<br>  Mujer Cáncer      y     Hombre Libra<br>  <br>  En esta combinación se atraen dos naturalezas bien diferentes. Lo que tienen en común es ese deseo de hacer las cosas "a su modo". Pero como ambos rescatan el valor del compromiso, saben bien cómo negociar antes que discutir. <br>  <br>  El aéreo signo de Libra necesita claridad, lógica y la interrelación civilizada. El acuático cangrejo necesita intimidad, afecto y sentir la corriente mutua de afecto. Cáncer puede quebrar el retraimiento emocional de Libra y Libra ayuda a Cáncer a que aprenda a ver la vida en perspectiva. <br>  <br>  Ambos pueden formar una buena dupla a la hora de compartir proyectos creativos o negocios que requieran la combinación de un análisis objetivo con un toque de calidez humana. Las dificultades entre ustedes surgirán si deciden adoptar conductas opuestas. Cáncer es sensible y puede sentirse rechazada si respira una atmósfera gélida. Libra es idealista y no puede vivir "sin armonía", por eso le molestan mucho las exigencias emocionales continuas de Cáncer. <br>  <br>  Traten de apreciar sus mutuas diferencias y hagan el esfuerzo de hablar el lenguaje del otro más que pretender cambiarlo y querer que el otro cumpla el rol de "compa?ero ideal". Podrán ofrecerse mucho si logran entender lo que es "ser diferente". <br>  <br>  Espero te sirva y te ayude........suerte...|`|MQol9jqKaa	Hombre Cáncer y Mujer Libra<br>  <br>  Cuando se reúnen para realizar negocios o viajes, puede resultar una pareja exitosa. Libra mostrará al cangrejo algunos secretos para salir adelante. El cangrejo admira su habilidad y carisma. En el terreno amoroso la relación sería francamente imposible; difieren en sus puntos de vistas, porque su manera de amar es radicalmente opuesta: el cangrejo desea esconderse en la arena y la balanza deseará sortear los problemas de la vida, pero... Lógicamente, fuera de casa. Sexualmente las ideas sensuales de Libra atemorizan al tímido canceriano.<br>  <br>  Hombre Libra y Mujer Cáncer<br>  <br>  Después de los cuarenta a?os ambos podrían entenderse perfectamente bien, incluso alcanzarían el calificativo de ser la pareja ideal, claro mientras no discutan sobre el arte ya que difieren cuanto a sus conceptos sobre la estética... En el aspecto sexual contribuye una relación fuerte y apasionada, porque Libra tiende a despertar la sensualidad de Cáncer... Armonía en los negocios, el estudio y los viajes. Amistad leal y duradera.|`|ff9861a5bc25c6d6b7c6ac42e621098faa	COMPATIBILIDAD CáNCER - LIBRA:  No se puede esperar gran cosa al mezclar el agua de CáNCER con el aire de LIBRA. Hay poca afinidad entre ellos. Sus encuentros son mas helados que el polo sur. A LIBRA no le gustará nada estar con CáNCER, que a veces puede ser demasiado celoso, vivir en el pasado o encerrarse en su mundo cuando las cosas no marchen como quiere. LIBRA, deseoso de equilibrio en sus relaciones, no aguantará los cambios de humor de CáNCER y preferirá darle la razón antes que pelear. Si discuten, pasaran algunos días para arreglarse ya que en el amor propio ambas partes estarán esperando disculpas. LIBRA es muy social y CáNCER tiende a ser más bien retraído. A LIBRA le encantan las personas, CáNCER las "soporta" y las disfruta, pero no todo el tiempo. LIBRA no va a entender por qué CáNCER no contesta el teléfono. Y CáNCER no va a entender por qué LIBRA se deja manipular tanto por la sociedad. CáNCER descartará rápido a un coqueto tan poco serio en el amor.|`|006vO4c7aa	naaaa... te va mas un QUIMO|`|1bbcdbb755f715250f4b62f98348beffaa	Cáncer  con Libra  <br>   <br>   <br>  Tienen compatibilidades especiales, como la sexual. El aire de Cáncer agita las aguas de Libra y lo hace con el fuego de su corazón. Pero es sólo eso, un agitar de aguas, una pasión que los une por muchos motivos. Los Cáncer se pondrán un tanto sentimentales ante el romanticismo de Libra, pero eso será todo, luego sus grandes diferencias lo separarán irremediablemente.<br>  <br>  El matrimonio no es recomendado entre ellos pues terminarían en grandes peleas y cuando se acabe la pasión, también se terminaría el amor. Cáncer es un signo negativo y Libra positivo, es decir que tienen una actitud diferente ante la vida. Los Libra se conducen con mayor optimismo y, al contrario los cancerianos, tienen una mirada más seria sobre las cosas.<br>  <br>  A pesar de esa diferencia podrían ser excelentes amigos, sobre todo si son amigos de diferentes sexos. El planeta que rige a Cáncer es la Luna, son todo sentimiento y muy posesivos, mientras a Libra los rige Venus y por lo tanto son sensuales y libertarios. Cangrejos y balancitas, abstenerse de pensar en una relación demasiado seria.|`|kwvrgoSkaa	Pues  yo soy libra y tenia un novio q era cancer y nos llevamos muy bien y nos queríamos muy así q te deseo mucha suerte.

NxgCV4piaa	If you can find a servicible student bassoon under $400 it would be the deal of the century.  Your chances of getting that lucky would be similar to that of winning the lottery.  Last I knew, a new student bassoon was about ten times that, 4K.<br>  <br>  Is it not an option for you to borrow a bassoon from your school?  There are lots of bassoons to borrow out there simply because they are so expensive.  In fact, I attended one of the top ten university music schools in the U.S., and more than one bassoon major borrowed their instrument from the school.

DfuHjtg1aa	No, he is quite popular, however a couple of years ago, at an awards ceremony, during his acceptance speech he said "I'm the greatest music writer in Australia" which a lot of people found distasteful.

XawBZzgSaa	Yes, Duke (James Garner) is Noah (Ryan Gosling).  Old Allie is at times upset with Duke's presence because she is ill with a condition like Alzheimer's Disease, and she can't remember that Duke is her longtime love.  Sometimes, she thinks he's an intrusive stranger.  Duke's task late in life has been to read from the notebook to her - the notebook that Allie wrote but can't remember she did write.  Now and then Duke is rewarded for his patience: she remembers him and returns her love to this long-faithful man.|`|RpGkAw9Vaa	He is Noah.  Allie had Alzheimer's.  Read the book, it's even better than the movie.|`|5TRxiacJaa	that old guy was Noah, Allie had Alzheimer and when Noah came back from the hospital he went over to Allie... Allie asks if their love can take them both at the same time, apparently it can...they died together...|`|PZamCLOEaa	The old guy was in fact Noah... Allie had alzheimer and she was mad because the fact that some things can't be remembered make you mad... the ending was supposed to happen on the exact momento when Allie REMEMBERED... that's the beauty of the movie...

AA11025918	According to TV.com, Grey's Anatomy season finale is going to air on 3/12/2009 and Private Practice season finale was yesterday, on 2/19/2009.<br>  <br>  I hope you find this helpful.<br>  <br>  I am also a big fan of the two shows.|`|rwXcLTNvaa	I read that there is going to be 26 episodes in Season 5....not 17.<br>  <br>  I think after the 17th episode, they are taking a break and then continuing with season 5.

Rmtfm7qnaa	No, not at all. There are a lot of people that prefer to be alone... it's simpler for many that way. You don't have to worry about another person, put up with another person's habits, or have to accommodate another person when you're not in a relationship. You get more free time to do whatever you want and get to use all your money for whatever you want to use it for.<br>  <br>  I'm not ashamed to admit that I've only had 2 relationships in my life... the first one was at 17 and the 2nd was about 10 years later. I was never really good with women either and that's not a bad thing. When I was in each of those relationships, it was because I wanted to be, not because anyone forced me or expected me to be. Nobody HAS to be in a relationship and I know some really good and well-adjusted people who have never been in a relationship and they just like being on their own.<br>  That's not weird at all.

ivqfhzHXaa	ouran high school host club -there isn't much romance because the main characters are a couple of oblivious idiots... in the anime they don't realize that they like each other or anything... but the manga is different and even tho it's not finished, they are up to the part where they are figuring out what they feel 4 each other. But i recommend this anime because i loooooooved the ending<br>  <br>  try fruits basket, not much romance either. but the story is really cute, and it made me cry like a baby<br>  <br>  try the wallflower, gosh i seriously don't know many crazily romantic anime.... but this 1 will make u laugh like crazy.<br>  <br>  oh skip beat!! it's great!!! tho neither the anime nor the manga have been finished yet... and u r probably going 2 wonder....

Rmtfm7qnaa	Personally, I don't like getting revenge. If the person knows it was you, they'll want to get revenge back on you and it could escalate into a viscous cycle where you are just constantly attacking each other.<br>  If you really wanted to get back at someone, it would depend on how well you know them. Turning someone's worst fear against them would be one of the harshest things you could do to them, whether it is public humiliation, fear of certain creatures, or whatever. But like I said, if they know it was you, they may want to do worse back to you, so I would be careful about that. Good luck!|`|vYAgIMLdaa	turning someone in to yahoo when they send you a nasty uncalled for message on YA...you'll see........
d5COR2S2aa	LOL nice question....<br>  <br>  Well, the first thing I did when I came to Y! A was to ask a question in the singles & dating category. But my first answer was in the Other - Education category - and the question was: 'Can sumone do my math hw?' LOL. Then I rediscovered how to get back to singles and dating, and poked around there for a bit. After a while I got bored with it too (not trying to sound apathetic here, but people's questions just started to sound the SAME - ie. 'How do you know if a guy likes you?' is asked practically everyday). And it was hard work answering personal questions... but for the most part I was serious in my responses and tried my best.<br>  <br>  Then I discovered P&S. Although I don't really get lots of best answers for answering P&S questions, I didn't mind - the points were easy to gain lol. And you get lots of answers. Then after I asked a bit of homework questions (mainly log problems), so I rediscovered the homework/education section and went I there whenever I needed a break or to 'share my knowledge' *cough*. So that's basically it... the most frequent section I go on is still P&S, and then Singles & Dating, and then HW.|`|AA10071149	For sure. I, too, started in the R&S section (though the very first question I asked was in Politics). I stayed there for a good while, then I moved over to the Politics section. When I got pregnant, I moved over to the Pregnancy section. Now I mainly just surf around. I read a million more questions than I actually answer. If one of my contacts stars a question that I find interesting, I'll go there, but I usually just bum around in mindless sections (Soap Operas has sucked me in lately!).|`|HmU1UqSeaa	I do regular searches for words like "anarchism" and "libertarian" and have a boilerplate answer that I give for those inquiring about them.<br>  <br>  I don't know how many times it's been voted best answer, and I'm not the only one who votes for it (I wonder if you should be able to vote for your own answers).|`|gAuIixm6aa	I have pretty much lost interest in cut and pasting "Take a pregnancy test" into Pregnancy questions. Also, I stopped just answering "Shoot yourself" because my old account got banned. :(

82946bac5a72f2b8fbcdafb97f625641aa	That is hard, Slayer, Sepultura, Exodus and Testament are soem of my favorite bands, not too big on Overkill.<br>  <br>  But, if I had to make a choice I would choose Slayer also. Tom Araya is one of my favorite singers and bassists, and combine that with Kerry's and Jeff's killer guitar work and Dave's drusm and get an awesome band.|`|12QJ9QMRaa	Testament for me.<br>  <br>  They are probably the most consistent of any of the Original Thrash bands.<br>  <br>  I have not really been impressed with Slayer since Seasons in the Abyss, and truth be told, only Reign in Blood and Seasons ever truly impressed me to begin with.  And I still think Reign is somewhat overrated.<br>  <br>  Seasons in the Abyss, on the other hand is one of the finest Thrash albums ever written.<br>  <br>  When it comes to the many faces of Sepultura, it is too hard to keep track.  I really love Arise - Roots, but was only moderately fod of the stuff preceding, and of course, the stuff after?  Not so much.<br>  <br>  Neither Exodus or Overkill ever really made an album which I just fell in love with.  They ahad some individual great tracks, and some pretty good albums, but I don't think either came close to touching the same peaks Slayer, Testament or Sepultura did.<br>  <br>  SO..... Testament may not have made an album quite as good as Seasons, but tey have made plenty of great ones, and as their last album proved, are  STILL  a great Thrash band.|`|UnsZKr4saa	From favourite to least favourite:<br>  <br>  Testament<br>  Overkill<br>  Slayer<br>  Sepultura<br>  Exodus|`|1vCoaf08aa	Testament<br>  Sepultura<br>  Overkill<br>  Slayer<br>  Exodus|`|wDisAke1aa	It's hard to choose between the first 3 but it's either Slayer or Sepultura.

Also, if they are indoor cats, get a leash and take them for walks outside to play around (yes, cats can get leashes and harnesses, and they look amazingly awesome).  Also, get some mouse toys and wand toys to keep them active.<br>  <br>  Another more serious problem would be a pituitary problem.

dN2y4F3Haa	Chris Brown is from my small hometown, Tappahannock, Virginia...he has brought Rihanna there a lot (couldn't believe some of the places she went with him to see his family)  We were so proud and he let a lot of people down.  But at the same time, I want to support him.  I hope he gets some anger management for that temper- he's still pretty young.|`|6GIjDiMpaa	I too liked Chris Brown and his music and I couldn't believe that he would do something like that.

I still like chris brown as a music artist, his music dosent have to do with anything he has done to rhianna, the way the music sound is what makes you like him. But i also believe that if you hit someone you should also be able to take getting hit back. Rhianna deserved what she got you dont just slap someone in their face and throw their keys out the window and expect everything to be ok with them. i still am a fan of rhianna and chris brown no matter what happened between the two. Eevryone makes mistakes it is only human, and this i believe was a mistake. i actually feel sorry for chris brown because i think both of them should have both got punishment for that or no one at all.|`|JOAPnhOgaa	regardless of who does it, violence is unacceptable and i do feel hostile towards those who express their anger this way|`|ZYA0Rt7Haa	Agree!|`|UTZ2Lor4aa	i totally agree with you, what gives him the right to go out and do that to the poor girl? i like his songs, but his succes is going to fall fast, i cant believe he actually did that to Rihanna. its her birthday today and she has to go out bruised and battered because of him, he deserves all the hate going towards him :)|`|cYsPx9sSaa	the whole point of being a fan, is that you are a fan, its like unconditional love. of course, i dont agree with what he done but it doesnt mean i hate him, i still love him|`|5Zcq3LXOaa	WOMAN BEATER<br>  he will get killed by Kanye<br>  he'll never feature with other artists again<br>  Now he has mel bs publicist|`|Hdvy9zkraa	Link please and then I'll comment...

Raised by a single, hard-working mother, History never really knew his father, a man who abandoned both History and his baby sister. This lack of paternal guidance turned an otherwise intelligent, promising boy into a drug-selling, money-grubbing Scarface-wannabe. Starting off as merely a petty crook, History’s torrid affair with his mentor’s (Game) wife, The Streets, sent him on a downward spiral of greed, deception, and, ultimately, death.<br>  <br>  <br>  iono....lol....

AA11357056	John Mayer's only 31... he's really more from this decade than anything else.

tDUPkdgUaa	honestly speaking, i never liked him. i thought his songs sucked. always have. always will. i never like Rhianna either. somebody was bound to hand it to her, though it's still wrong. whether it would have been a male or a female. she was kind of a sl*t. it's still wrong for Chris Brown to have done that.<br>  <br>  i never liked him, as i said it before. to me, he was just another wannabe famous person who sings love RnB songs and "acted". now, for beating on Rhianna (despite how much i disliked her as well) he's like a pile of sh*t waiting to be picked up and tossed away to me.<br>  <br>  :]|`|pvJH5HQ5aa	I think Chris Brown should go to hell, i turn the radio off now when i hear one of his songs. <br>  My mom, was beaten and abused by her ex. He also beat me and my brother, i was only 8. I thought it was "normal". Now i can no longer stand a man that dares to do that to anyone, a woman, another man, a child, an animal, they all have hearts, and feelings, and a family. I went to school, everyday with masive bruises, and everyone looked, whispered, even teachers, but no one cared enough to get me and my family help. Untill One teacher, called the police, they ended up coming right when my mom was getting hit. Anyone, man or women who can do this to someone, is not worth my time, and should go to hell.|`|7dPm35LYaa	I didn't even have to see the pics, once i heard what he did i stopped respecting him as an artist and especially as a person.<br>  <br>  <br>  I will say though for TMZ to post those is shady, I'm sure rihanna didn't want her battered face plastered over the internet. They really should respect her privacy.|`|hJfaT4oOaa	I hope Rihanna presses charges.  Chris Brown should not be let off easy.  Any regular person would get in trouble, he shouldn't have no consequences just because he's famous.  I hope Rihanna doesn't stay with him.  She's better than that.  I never like Chris Brown anyway.<br>  <br>  And by the way, his music sucks.|`|Qt3Zqfviaa	I see him in a different light now....|`|h3MmXV9Caa	I hate him<br>  <br>  simple|`|Fer4ZrnXaa	*Jaw Drops* WOW

Prat of the reason is because they are supposed to be happier. Not sure that is always true, but another reason is because you have someone to keep you accountable for your health. For example, if you have sleep apnea, and live alone, no one will care that you snore, and you could stop breathing in your sleep. Also, married people are more likely (or used to be more likely) to have kids. People with kids, I think, engage in less risky behavior, so less accidental death.|`|p03Jc7eHaa	seems longer

We had a toilet as well that we used but whatever went in there flowed down into a pigpen and the pigs would eat it. <br>  This made me really sad because I've always wanted to eat pork just not from the pigs we had.|`|DzIlM76Xaa	Surprisingly I haven't shed any tears today.

QePbhS8Caa	First created 1932. First appeared June 30, 1938.|`|8yE2sYGeaa	The guys tried for about six years to market it as a comic strip. They put it together as a comicv book, which came out June 1938|`|dfjIBHe3aa	The Wikipedia says he was created in 1932.  I'll buy that with a few reservation (as someone who wrote a good part of the Henry Kuttner entry) is that even when you are talking about something as documented as this (which was written about by among others Jim Steranko who knew Schuster and Siegel and Maurice Horn, most accounts of the science fiction pulps and its fandom are based on VERY fallible memory.  Superman was based IN PART on Philip Wylie's Gladiator -- about essentially an anti-hero, though he's more complicated than that -- and underwent substantial revisions between his appearances in Siegal's fanzines and his appearance in Action Comics in '38.  That professional appearance was the genuine debut of the Man of Steel as we know him today, so it's probably unfair to put a more specific date on him than what I've gone into.|`|fawhiGtsaa	First created in 1932, then 1938.

DJbEN5oyaa	Gum Gate is about when Kate sent the kids over to her sister in laws home {Jodi} and the kids saw a bowl of Gum on the counter.<br>  <br>   So being kids they wanted some.. so Jodi asked the older twins, does your mom let you have gum?.. they lied and said yes {they only get gum on air planes}. So the kids had gum. They went home and they got gum all over in their socks and Joels? teddy bear. Kate went ballistic and told Joel she was throwing out his favorite bear and kept saying it over and over making the boy cry {that pissed me off} and then called her sister-inlaw and raked her over the coals. You KNOW we dont let them have gum!!<br>  <br>  Cupcake-gate=..  when the kids all went to a bakery and they got to decorate their own cupcakes. Well, they only get desert if they finish their dinner. Some of the boys refused to eat so they missed out while others got their cupcakes.|`|oO4TUkVkaa	Ok heres the real deal.  Aunt Jodi was kicked off the show because of two incidents that occured at her house when she was watching the kids.  Gumgate was when she gave the sextuplets gum when they were three years old.  Kate has a rule no gum at age three because you can choke and if it's dropped on the floor it's a pain to get out.  Cupcakegate was when she gave the kids cupcakes right before they were to go home and eat dinner.  I also have these rules and think that most parents would back me up that one if you can't spell gum then you can't chew gum and if you have not eaten supper yet the cupcakes are kept for dessert.|`|fd3969820c20a4244842f433a5e6eee6aa	Idk but they sound hilarious.|`|BXgfLFVyaa	Uhm?<br>  Jon and Kate couldnt have kids on their own..<br>  so they had to rely on fertility treatments.<br>  they had <br>  Maddi and Kara; the twins.<br>  A few years later did another fertility treatment and had<br>  Colin, Joel, Aiden, Hannah, Alexis, and Leah; the sextuplets<br>  think about it.. how often does that happen?<br>  no often at all really.<br>  I dont know if you heard about the lady that had 8 babies at once, she was on the news.. and probably will be for lifetime and so will the babies. she was on Dr. Phil yesterday. having that many babies at once is pretty much amazing and people love to hear about it. and to see how people live their lives everyday with that many people it's just crazy. i love that show.<br>  <br>  <br>  was that even your ?<br>  <br>  or are you asking what Gumgate is because that is.. the kids arent allowed to have gum<br>  <br>  and Cupcake gate.. they arent allowed cupcakes.

TyydcRfeaa	I come from the audience who grew up with great comedy like Dumb adn Dumbr, There's Something About Mary and The Wedding Singer in the days of golden era of the comedy romantic time, back in 90's, so when I saw the first few scenes of Get Smart I was worried if I'd wasted my time...<br>  <br>  By the time the final scene ended I knew how much I'd enjoyed Get Smart by my tired cheeks and sore belly... This movie is hilarious...There are nods and expected jokes from the old series amongst a very cleverly rework of Control vs Kaos... Carell brings his brand of humor and lays it over the essence of Don Adams and some flavors of Mel Brooks. Expect some cameos from the series and Get Smart fans...I saw this movie on DVD but should have seen it in the cinema as it has some big action in it as well...<br>  <br>  Whether your new to Get Smart or know the old series, in my opinion you can't go wrong with this flick...Hopefully we'll get a sequel as good as this and another era great of Comedy -Romance...|`|YvXYDiBcaa	I really liked it.

For some, living alone and being able to hear yourself think is better (and be able to do things more freely including partying =).<br>  <br>  As for others, they cant live single their whole life and need to settle down with some1.<br>  <br>  My view, if you want kids and a family, couple for sure. But if you dont want a family, single should be just fine. <br>  <br>  Im only 16, but that how I feel (i know adults who are both single (including a guy who is 40) and in a relationship. <br>  <br>  Me myself, at my age, in a relationship is better for me atm, but that could change in my adult life.|`|vRvXvnRZaa	That depends, when it's 4 am and your whole butt falls into the freezing toilet water because your beloved husband forgot to flip the lid then single comes to mind BUT when sick, worried, tired, "happy" (If you know what I mean) or watching your child graduate while you choke back the tears of joy? then having that hand over yours and that smile of total complicity does make a marriage worthwhile and you can't imagine life without it.|`|gu1sEQN8aa	I love living with my boyfriend.

When you have someone (boyfriend/girlfriend) and you go home at the end of the night, you know that someone loves you. You wake up the next day knowing that you still have someone. But when you're single you can't experience that feeling. Even if a guy or girl thinks they're cool because they've hooked up with people at a club, at the end of the night when they're lying in bed they really don't have anyone who truly loves them and cares for them.|`|28ux28S0aa	It depends on if you are selfish or not... or if you want to be with the other person forever... if you do, then make the commitment and get married first.

6NZeItMAaa	This sign represents the dark side of the earth, the occult side of history, solitude, and meditation. People born under it are deep thinkers, natural ora-tors, and teachers. They are wor-shippers of intellect, and devotees to book knowledge. They are insatiable in their desire for intellectual growth. They are indefatigable workers, and apt to tire quickly because they usually do several things at a time. Like the goat, they will work for themselves without stop or stint, but are very restless when harnessed to work for others. They are not overstocked with self-esteem, and are apt to be self-conscious.<br>  <br>  Capricorn people resent all interference, and never meddle with the affairs of others. They are fine entertainers, have excellent mem-ories, and excel in story telling. This is the most brilliant and the most de-pressed sign in the Zodiac. When jolly, these Capricorners are very jolly; when miserable, they are more miserable than all the others put together, and can usu ally give no adequate reason for their wretchedness.<br>  <br>   They are kind-hearted, loyal, secretive. A friend once is a friend always. They are usually care-ful in all money and business affairs, and a promise is sacredly regarded. They are natural planners, and know how to make both ends meet. <br>  <br>  The women are usually far more discreet financial man-agers than the men, and are very careful housekeepers, possessing much taste in the arrangement as well as the manage-ment of the home. They are often able to take charge of hotels and institutions where many servants are employed. Some excellent musicians come from this sign. When the individual is born so as to be marked by the sign before Capricorn (Sagittarius), on the Cusp, as it is called, the gift of prophecy is likely to be most marked. Some of the most successful actors and actresses are the result of this combination of signs. Capricorn people are proud, high-minded, determined, in-dependent, lovers of harmony and beauty, but apt to live too much in externals. They are the people of great material aspirations. <br>  <br>  The most congenial friends and com-panions will be found with those born in Taurus, Virgo, and Libra, or those born about the same time of year as them-selves. <br>  <br>  FAULTS <br>  The faults of these people are selfish-ness and self-distrust. They talk too much, and magnify their troubles and perplexities. The spiritual nature is hard to reach, but once aroused is capable of the highest development. They are not quick to anger, but when their rights are meddled with they can be passionate and cruel in their denunciations.|`|5u1G3Qb8aa	i think u should probably know what ur like...<br>  how dumb are u?
JbRTKDFmaa	Yes, because they are human beings just like the rest of us and therefore deserve the same rights. I understand that some people are religious and believe that being gay is wrong, but I don't believe that they should be allowed to force their viewpoints on other people's lives and not allow them to have rights.<br>  <br>  It's legal in my state and I'm proud of that.|`|cdpy5iv5aa	I really don't care.|`|7dPm35LYaa	Yes.

bjcjQ4zfaa	They easily misunderstand eachother.<br>  <br>  Scorpio is very sensitive and emotional, a water sign, while Libra is much less emotional being an air sign. What ends up happening in Libra and Scorpio relationships is that both will say things that really offend/hurt/piss off the other but won't understand why it was offensive to the other person. Scorpio is also a very intense, all or nothing person while Libra likes balance and method, so conflicts will arise because Libra is not satisfying Scorpio when they ask them questions or try to set goals.<br>  <br>  However there is a good fundamental chemistry between the two. They can often find value in the same things, have common interests, laugh at the same type of humor, .etc but the relationship really isn't strong in the emotional side. Of course in order to get a better understanding you have to take in account moon, venus, and rising signs.|`|C0Q6OOlJaa	My brother dated a libra for two years. It started out really great. They talked on the phone for hours every night, and went to the movies every saturday night. He liked her humor and she actually clinginess. They were both pretty possessive. Whenever girls would say to my brother "You're my new friend" she would grab his shoulder's pull him away and say "No, mine". And whenever other boys would talk to her, he hit them. She got mad at him when he had started talking with other girls, but just as friends, she didn't believe that and she started trash talking them and her friends did too. She broke up with him a little while later. But they are, surprisingly, still really good friends.<br>  <br>  Overall, I don't think it's the best, but if they can figure out who's in charge in the relationship, and overcome jealousy issues, it could work.

Isxq5DhOaa	i appologize in advance if it's wrong XD<br>  i dont know if im understanding the question but IF i am then i think the Director films it as if showing the characters from a different perspective as what they are..showing them as what they arent. Don't knwo what else to say without sort of spoiling it in a way lol XD|`|56bNLJykaa	I dont remember the movie well enough.. it was ok<br>  <br>  But the p.o.v. or perspective shot is where you see what the character would be seeing themselves.. As if you are their eyes. With that being said, maybe you remember a scene where Nolan uses that shot better than I do.

However, there is somewhat of an alternative version in the form of a movie which came out five years before Blood+ called 'Blood: The Last Vampire'.<br>  >> <a href="http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/encyclopedia/anime.php?id=7" rel="nofollow">http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/encyclop...</a><br>  <br>  I hope that helps ^_^|`|7a2efb9a491bf91f2d2a622649572fdfaa	no unfortunately not but there is a kind of prequel which is an anime movie called "blood: the last vampire"

zovrJ0yXaa	i'll be honest, i used to be the biggest fan of heroes back in season 1, and i couldnt wait for season 2. i watched it, and even though a lot of people didnt like it i thought it was underrated. the biggest problem was that the story became unfocused and slow in parts, but in all the characters still made it interesting, if nowhere near as good as the first season. however, being honest, volume 3 (which ended before christmas) was appalling. i mean genuinely appalling. the writers havnt learnt to move on and are recycling old tricks, except its no longer exciting because you'll just think to yourself 'oh, have to prevent the horrible future from happening. again'. worst of all is that it has become horribly contrived and the writers force characters to act unnaturally for the sake of moving the story forward. this isnt just one small isolated incident, its an avalanche of stupidity, bizarre personality switches and some appalling dialogue (be prepared to hear the flattest line imaginable read over and over). it completely blows the past two years of character development to hell. the characters simply become mouthpieces for the plot, rather than the genuine human beings they were in the first season. i can say that im actually upset that after devoting much time to caring about these characters for two years, the writers themselves have given up on them. and if they dont care, why should i? my advice? watch the first season, and savour it as superb television. but dont bother watching the rest until it gets better, if it ever does, or it will sour the experience forever|`|AA11202477	It's my favorite show. It's had its ups and downs, but then I've never seen a show that didn't. They seem (this season) to be trying to avoid the Lost-backslide, and even though I don't like where some of the events are going, they are in fact a natural progression. Kind of like not always liking real life. To me it's definitely worth the time, but you can judge for yourself.|`|4c056b35b4e33a793a012798113bbc31aa	Season 1: awesome<br>  Season 2: terrible<br>  Season 3: i had to give up about 6 episodes in, it was that bad, but i hear its getting better|`|TWlcMkqVaa	1: good<br>  2: good<br>  3: better<br>  4: (currently on air) really good|`|PcmubHsPaa	Season 1 was awesome, probably the best one<br>  Season 2 was honestly not the best but did have it's good episodes and moments<br>  Season 3 has been quite good! Especially Volume 4 of Season 3 which just started a couple of weeks ago. I've become a bigger fan of Heroes since then.<br>  <br>  It's really a great show, Season 1 is probably the best though :)|`|2dd7ad59a27b4a34fc13f5e7bbd8ba34aa	Season one was really good. It was original and had a great storyline. Season two was not so great. I haven't seen season three yet, but I liked the first season enough to give it a chance.|`|AGrrNMikaa	Season One-Awesome<br>  Season Two-Got a little far fetched<br>  Season Three-Have not watched but have them all DVRd|`|1hS27eJuaa	I love it, I have loved every ep so far. seen everyone that has aired.|`|14c690b99c03a819fd4f7cbcd14bac5eaa	Season 1 was AWESOME but from season 2 on it hasn't been as intense.  There have been some moments when it picked up some, but I think that it will never be what it was in season 1.  I would recommend it, though...good show overall, you just have to wait out the slowness of season 2 to get to season 3 when it picks up a bit more.

It was one awesome show and doing a spin-off with Wyatt and Chris in the future would be awesome!<br>  <br>  My favourite character was probably Piper or Cole.|`|1hS27eJuaa	I love charmed and would have loved for more but at this point no it should not be brought back.

zTuc5eDIaa	Let's say a guy named Roger is attracted to a woman named Elaine. He asks her out to a movie; she accepts; they have a pretty good time. A few nights later he asks her out to dinner, and again they enjoy themselves. They continue to see each other regularly, and after a while neither one of them is seeing anybody else.<br>  <br>  And then, one evening when they're driving home, a thought occurs to Elaine, and, without really thinking, she says it aloud: "Do you realize that, as of tonight, we've been seeing each other for exactly six months?"<br>  <br>  And then there is silence in the car. To Elaine, it seems like a very loud silence. She thinks to herself: Geez, I wonder if it bothers him that I said that. Maybe he's been feeling confined by our relationship; maybe he thinks I'm trying to push him into some kind of obligation that he doesn't want, or isn't sure of.<br>  <br>  And Roger is thinking: Gosh. Six months.<br>  <br>  And Elaine is thinking: But, hey, I'm not so sure I want this kind of relationship, either. Sometimes I wish I had a little more space, so I'd have time to think about whether I really want us to keep going the way we are, moving steadily toward . . . I mean, where are we going? Are we just going to keep seeing each other at this level of intimacy? Are we heading toward marriage? Toward children? Toward a lifetime together? Am I ready for that level of commitment? Do I really even know this person?<br>  <br>  And Roger is thinking: ...so that means it was...let's see...February when we started going out, which was right after I had the car at the dealer's, which means . . . let me check the odometer...Whoa! I am way overdue for an oil change here.<br>  <br>  And Elaine is thinking: He's upset. I can see it on his face. Maybe I'm reading this completely wrong. Maybe he wants more from our relationship, more intimacy, more commitment; maybe he has sensed -- even before I sensed it -- that I was feeling some reservations. Yes, I bet that's it. That's why he's so reluctant to say anything about his own feelings. He's afraid of being rejected.<br>  <br>  And Roger is thinking: And I'm gonna have them look at the transmission again. I don't care what those morons say, it's still not shifting right. And they better not try to blame it on the cold weather this time. What cold weather? It's 87 degrees out, and this thing is shifting like a damn garbage truck, and I paid those incompetent thieves $600.<br>  <br>  And Elaine is thinking: He's angry. And I don't blame him. I'd be angry, too. God, I feel so guilty, putting him through this, but I can't help the way I feel. I'm just not sure.<br>  <br>  And Roger is thinking: They'll probably say it's only a 90- day warranty. That's exactly what they're gonna say, the scumballs.<br>  <br>  And Elaine is thinking: Maybe I'm just too idealistic, waiting for a knight to come riding up on his white horse, when I'm sitting right next to a perfectly good person, a person I enjoy being with, a person I truly do care about, a person who seems to truly care about me. A person who is in pain because of my self-centered, schoolgirl romantic fantasy.<br>  <br>  And Roger is thinking: Warranty? They want a warranty? I'll give them a damn warranty. I'll take their warranty and stick it right up their...|`|ECe1rgsdaa	Girl: Thinks with her head<br>  Boy: Thinks with his OTHER head<br>  <br>  ;)<br>  j/k!|`|uDleWWlcaa	what kinda question is this?

VnckTnk9aa	I'm assuming you're talking about cutting "oneself".<br>  <br>  If someone "used to cut", it means that in times of frustration or anger, and in some cases because of the addition or fascination with it, they would use razor blades to cut various parts of their skin.<br>  <br>  Very often, people who do this cut their arms, forearms and wrists.<br>  <br>  I had a few friends like that in the past so I've seen from experience. And they all did this for different reasons but it generally came from the same place: sadness.<br>  <br>  As for Johnny Depp, I am not sure if he used to do this or not, but I've heard that he used to (don't quote me on this, lol).|`|DKfScL8taa	they "used" to cut themselves but no longer do and yes johnny depp does it to mark different phases in his life.

oaNjcmkQaa	i just watched the movie ,1 night bfore the oscars & all my friends did use the word 'overhyped' to address this movie & it was not just me.honestly speaking the popular opinion is like...." the movie is quite good,but it does not deserve so many oscars" ....the movie is getting mixed reactions mostly positive as far as they take india to the international arena of awards no matter how they r.<br>  at many instances the movie looks purposefully biased towards india & a POVERTY PORN.<br>  there r some things in life which r not supposed to be shown on the big screen even if they r the truth for eg<br>   nude women,porn,violence,exploitation & poverty is one of them.<br>  u wont believe me that the british politics r still baking the plans of 'neo colonising' india& even US if possible.their main agenda is induce inferiority complex among the emerging economies &get a rise out of ppl, like they did in their rule<br>  no doubt the ggb awards sound so fishy<br>   basically speaking india is not a slumdog in its very origin,which many foreigners will start thinking after this movie.<br>  india had a rich culture far more rich & superior than any other however the truth  is difficult to swallow for our western counterparts<br>  ,slumdog is not our culture at all<br>  it is just the colonial regime &massive exploitation  which make us look like that. there r a lot of things good about india more than the bad things shown here,as far as they do not explore the bleak side of their country,they will keep on making movies like that & indians embrace them as far as they win them oscars<br>                     all this "overhype" will only work for the good of india & give her international recognition.foreign films & actors will be attracted towards india & may also be a tourist destination of future.<br>  ppl will come to know about her as a rich heritage & an emerging economy.how ppl misunderstood her as a slumdog will be forgotten<br>  the bias will not last forever.<br>      the oscars will work wonders for bollywood, believe me|`|78c7e5f1302752cfd76fcfc9a76b885aaa	i don't think so.<br>  We've had similar movies made but they haven't had a large audience,Slumdog Millionaire was watched worldwide.<br>  Our own Indian directors have made movies on such topics but they've not reached out to a large audience,that's where Slumdog Millionaire shined...and it sure does deserve the accolades,as the above answerer said,there are many movies which deserve equal honour,but i would just like to add to my bestie's answer :P that this movie was something new to the rest of the world and hence,deserves everything it's receiving|`|51tZzAuKaa	yaa ! cos we've had AR rahman giving much better musics before . he's just the God of music . but dint live upto his calibre in slumdog i feel . still , he gets an oscar . but that nullifies the fact that he was not given sufficient honour for other projects. he  was too good before !<br>  the other thing is that we've had better movies in india .such as ' a wednesday ' , ' rang de basanti ' and others . but the fact that it was an ''indian' 'director seems to have been the obstacle .|`|nn17zqOqaa	yes|`|MJnyxnR2aa	yea.....every one has the right be opiniated......but i feel that even though slumdog had a great script...a great story...a great message.........some great work.....but it wasnt  "THE BEST".....there have been many movies that deserved the same appreciation and adoring.....perhaps...a lil more...!!<br>  <br>  *staR*|`|fb78bdd976de0de834cfeae957745cbbaa	i definitely would call it overhyped...it was a decent movie with lots of flaws..definitely not oscar material!!|`|3fa8c5bf473909bd0e279e62d7c93ebaaa	yes.............its toooooo over...........|`|a2b8641f3900ff3887ba8bb3aa67fb65aa	*Over hyped !!<br>  Its the understatement of the year !!<br>  Everything abt the movie is blown out of proportion !!<br>  There are so many good & better movies that could do with some adulation ...... but as they say, nothing succeeds like success !!~?|`|yT8GfnfKaa	A bit, just a bit though.<br>  <br>  But it's still an AMAZING movie.

84726b724d7d1fd7da09652c50425c38aa	12-11 Pisces/Aquarius<br>  The combination of Sun in Pisces and Moon in Aquarius produces crusaders of all sorts. Emotional sensitivity and intuitive perceptions of Pisces is blended with the friendliness, originality and independence of Aquarius. People enjoy your company because you are so easygoing, charming and versatile. A cheerful outlook and the ability to make acquaintances easily usually results in the development of a large circle of friends. People interest you, and you possess what may be termed true humanitarian and philanthropic inclinations. You can find success in business because of your ability to get along easily with people and make friends out of strangers. Despite this ease of cooperation, there is a lot of independence in your nature and you dislike the dull and the routine. At times you may experience sudden and perhaps unexplainable changes in mood or feeling. Progressive inclinations and original thought are your greatest assets. You are a dedicated person in that you must come to believe firmly in what you are doing. Once you are completely convinced of the worth or value of a cause or of a product, your talent for persuasive speech and quiet persistence assures success. Conversely, when you are less than fully convinced of the value of a program, you are not nearly so effective. You have a very original way of thinking and acting that combines the intellectual with the emotional. A strong inner imagination blends your feelings with your intellect, keeping you from being either too coldly intellectual or too emotional. <br>  <br>  Pisces/Scorpio<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>              Fundamentally you are a relatively serious person but you do see the "big joke" of life. Which is of course is death. In fact you might be somewhat obsessed with that whole issue and your own death. Don't let the dark side run away with you. Let the force be with you not against you.<br>  <br>              The substantial sense of humor that you exhibit has a real judgmental voice to it and you may actually use "it" to that end i.e., for social or political change. Your extremely keen perceptions are reinforced with an almost mystic knowing about people. You have quick mental processes and a unique view of the whole and it part's, which is completely valid.<br>  <br>              You have a very creative imagination and thought processes which should probably be used in the creative arts rather that regular business pursuits. That doesn't mean you wouldn't be successful in business but conventional business might actually bore you silly.<br>  <br>              You could be a moody and an always brooding type personality who becomes a victim of psychological depression; because you love the dramas of Life. Train yourself to not let all those personal and worldly worries bother you so much, remember you really can't do much about them except, worry. You also tend to want to lead a more secret life of your own away from mainstream society.<br>  <br>              You are charismatic to the opposite sex and never void of partners. You are passionate, romantic, giving and very popular with your loves. This is a highly sexed position that definitely needs multiple outlets for it's substantial sexual energy. You would like to raise a family but need to find a partner who shares your un-monogamous needs. You must practice honest and openness in relationships.

Let me tell you this... the one with smaller boobs is closer to looking like a boy. lol Soo there ya go. Listen as you grow up you will realize that Boobs are the one thing that happen to be the best thing on this planet. (At least in the top 4 lol) so go ahead and help the one with the small boobs learn a lesson and choose the one who looks more like a real girl. But... all in all I'd have to say if you have a shot at being extra close "friends" with both of them you'd be a dummy to just choose one. With that said lol if you still don't like the one with the bigger boobs tell her to e-mail *me*.|`|M2ISWWIkaa	Buddy if I were you, I would hang out with both of them one night, along with one of your friends, so its 2 guys/2 girls.

KjYxk1S2aa	Ah, great! I know Vic quite well, actually, and have done a lot of art for him in the past. (Haven't sent him any in a while, but here's one that I'll be giving him in the next month...if I deem him worthy...*snort*: <a href="http://i146.photobucket.com/albums/r260/kaikisuka/rain2smaller.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://i146.photobucket.com/albums/r260/...</a>  )<br>  <br>  If you have some artistic/creative talent, definitely make him some art or a plush doll! I don't know much in the ways of anime, and thus don't know of anything with much significance (besides art). Think of something that perhaps no one has given him before, you think? The book about why you love him sounds cute, but that might come off a bit stalker-ish...Vic isn't 'scared' by (most of) his fans, so it would probably be fine, but don't take my word on that.<br>  <br>  Definitely go with whatever you think he'd like most! I'm sure he'll be touched that you thought of making him something, regardless of what it is. :)<br>  <br>  Hope that helps, and have fun!<br>  <br>  ~Jen|`|ylB9S2Y9aa	The book sounds just a little stalkerish, but the plushie is a good idea although you might not have time to make that in one day. Another idea is you could draw a picture of all of his characters from different anime together?|`|VYt7KjMCaa	holy **** at the chick above me, if your the jenna I think you are I'm pretty sure I know who you are and your art is the bomb--I wanted to get some of your art prints but i'm not sure where to look for them, email me at a_wolf_with_no_pack@yahoo.com?<br>  <br>  But to the asker, I'd go with the plushee--that sounds waaaay cute I'd bet he'd love it! If you have the material do an Ed and a roy! :DDD<br>  <br>  Your a lucky lucky dog! I want to meet Vic toooo! ^^|`|95afnFHCaa	AWWW you're going to meet Vic?! (grrrr, how come everyone gets to meet him 'cept me?! grumble grumble)<br>  <br>  I know from people that know him that he likes things his fans make him, so I think anything would suffice. I LOVE the Ed plushie idea, but that might be hard to make in one day. If you can draw, I suggest drawing something, or you can make that book and illustrate it. Sorry I don't have any original ideas... XP

AA12390047	I agree with you.  And Starr needs to get away from Cole.  Starr needs someone who's mature.  A couple? Well, I think they're headed that way. But Cole is supposed to be in a bad car wreck and I hope Starr doesn't sit with him day and night.|`|97158e12e6c17080ec04a0a2b2456b2aaa	yea, when he first came to town i thought about that.l I have a feeling that eventually they will kiss or Starr will kiss him, then they will try and hide it but it will get out then, Cole will be upset and her dad, and Blair and a whole bunch of other people. Cant wait to see how that plays out.|`|NGNeT3rYaa	No, that whole thing would be wrong,. It is already bordering on inappropriate. but I think that is what OLTL is going to do with them, stick them together for the next big controversial story. Being a teen mom wasn't enough I guess.|`|rFZtQuV2aa	They seem to be getting closer and closer - I think they look good together too - if it's possible for Starr to look good.  Schuyler is a cutie.|`|fab4d863aae6c11ee1163077586edcdaaa	I think they'll play around with it for a while.  They'll probably have Cole's jealousy get so bad that he brings accusations of "impropriety" against Schyler ... probably get his license revoked, or at least try to.  In the end, Schyler might have to quit, or else go through a hard time because of it.<br>  <br>  They might kiss, and then pass it off as a mistake.  But I don't really think OLTL will have them get into any kind of relationship until Starr is 17 or 18, out of his class and in college.|`|876392dfe1f6d9806d256fd933358144aa	their relationship has already crossed the lines....she's looking for another father and boyfriend figure and he's the shoulder she can lean on...i think they might get caught up in the moment and kiss...then he will leave the show....maybe look her up a couple of years from now...when she goes to college...he will be her professor and then its on!!!!  lol|`|yP6cJBwOaa	Yeah i think they will start sneaking around and cole may find out and hurt him and langston may help cole lol!|`|dbKj55akaa	I have to agree with you. I hope they will.|`|7XM4QJiuaa	I don't think I like the idea too much.|`|UY3zl9dFaa	I think Starr's starting to develop a crush on him but he is trying very hard to not let their relationship look inappropriate. They've both been through a lot and both need a friend to lean on. I think Cole in his drug-induced state will see Starr's feelings and misinterpret the situation and cause problems for Schuyler. I may be way off-base here, but the other day when he was talking about a lost love, I got the feeling that he might be gay. Which, as a teacher, he might want to keep secret, making for an even more difficult situation if Cole tries to cause trouble for him.|`|jHDeIPEfaa	I believe their relationswhip is heading in that direction. I'm not sure how I feel about it though.

It was a cold winter night, and already dark. She was 13, and her parents were going out of town and letting her stay by herself, as long as she was good. Her little dog, Buddy, would protect her. Elizabeth decided that she didn't want to get in trouble so she waved her parents goodbye, went upstairs and listened to some music. after a while, she noticed a chill in the house, so she went around looking for an open window. finally, she traced the draft to the basement. She turned on all the lights in the basement and hurried down to look for a windo. sure enough, the one in the far corner was open about two feet and cold air was blowing in. she shut it hurriedly, noticing fingerprints on the sill. one of her parents must have opened it and forgotten to close it. She rushed back upstairs and started a hot shower. she was humming to herself when she thought she heard Buddy yelp. She stuck her hand out of the tub to pet him and he licked her hand. she finished her shower, and now, singing to Kelly Clarkson, stepped out of the shower, wrapped in a towel. She screamed. And screamed, nearly fainted, and threw up. Buddy was lying on te floor, his throat cut and bleeding all over the white fluffy towels. on the mirror, scrawled in what seemed to be lipstick, but at a closer look was actually blood, was Humans Can Lick Too.<br>  <br>  elizabeth realized what had been odd about the fingerprints. they had been coming in, not opening out.|`|7ctj9AG3aa	A man and his camel were lost in the desert for months. The man got really horny and decided, what the hell, a camel is better than nothing. <br>  <br>  He put the camel in position, climbed behind the camel, and just as he was about to enter the camel, it ran off. He chased the camel down and tried again, but it ran away again. <br>  <br>  He tried this five more times before he came across a beautiful woman lying in the desert. She was dehydrated and close to death. He took the woman to a oasis and revived her. <br>  <br>  The grateful woman wakes up and says to the man, "Thank you for saving my life. I will do anything for you." <br>  <br>  The man smiles and replies, "Anything? Really?" <br>  <br>  "Yes," the woman says, "Anything." <br>  <br>  "Well," the man says.

At the beginning of the sermon, he got nervous and took a drink. He proceeded to talk up a storm. <br>  Upon his return to his office after mass, he found the following note on the door: <br>  <br>  1. Sip the Vodka, don't gulp. <br>  2. There are 10 commandments, not 12. <br>  3. There are 12 disciples, not 10. <br>  4. Jesus was consecrated, not constipated. <br>  5. Jacob wagered his donkey, he did not bet his ***. <br>  6. We do not refer to Jesus Christ as the late J. C. <br>  7. The Father, Son, and Holy Ghost are not referred to as Daddy, Junior and the Spook. <br>  8. David slew Goliath, he did not kick the **** out of him. <br>  9. When David was hit by a rock and was knocked off his donkey,don't say he was stoned off his ***. <br>  10. We do not refer to the cross as the "Big T." <br>  11. When Jesus broke the bread at the Last Supper he said, "Take this and eat it for it is my body." He did not say "Eat me" <br>  12. The Virgin Mary is not called "Mary with the Cherry," <br>  13. The recommended grace before a meal is not: Rub-A-Dub-Dub thanks for the grub, yeah God. <br>  14.

Xs5OPQfCaa	So many singers sound better recorded than they do live because in a recording studio, you can mix your voice and things like that so that it sounds better. I don't think that you can do that in a live performance so if the singers make a mistake or hit the wrong note, it can't be edited or changed.|`|GipcAbHpaa	When They Record They Have A computer To change there voices to sound better and as coco malloy said yes they can mess up the beat and the song.|`|Rq1o0Ahsaa	1. the can have more than one go at recording it<br>  2. it is a small room so and the sound is better<br>  3. they sometimes edit the sound/voices|`|hgEHJhAqaa	Because when they sing live, they can make mistakes and they can screw up the beat. but when you have the studio version they fix all the issues that they have.<br>  hope i helped!<br>  coco malloy

HsgK6fNyaa	I'm 18.<br>  I only like Disney Channel for one show, and that is Wizards of Waverly Place. It's the only show that doesn't use childish slapstick humor (as in having cakes or pies thrown in the face, jumping on someone, or shouting cliche words like "poop" or "fart", etc). Sonny with the Chance, Hannah Montana, and Cory in the House are amongst the shows on Disney that display those childish comedic strategies, and that is why I don't like watching them. <br>  <br>  Wizards, on the other hand, uses real jokes that will appeal to a more mature audience and its main cast knows how to use comedic timing as an advantage. Its main star, Selena Gomez, is actually the most talented actress on Disney Channel up to date. <br>  <br>  I also think Disney should lighten up on the promotion for Hannah Montana. Aside from its catchy pop tunes and colorful lighting, the show does not display Disney in a good comedic light. Instead, Disney should put more promotion into Wizards because the show truly deserves it. Disney Channel also needs to produce better shows in the future, because most of their recent ones are very silly and mediocre.<br>  <br>   Overall, besides Wizards, everyone should just change the channel and watch some real comedy on ABC, NBC, CBS, and Comedy Central.|`|i2xLDJaraa	Sometimes I watch Hannah Montana or that stupid wizard show I don't actually like them just bored (watch them jokingly)<br>  <br>  If I really liked them I'd tell you I liked them.

39OVFs5Raa	A True Australian ghost story.......<br>  <br>  This story happened a while ago in Brisbane and even though it sounds like an Alfred Hitchcock tale, it's true.<br>  <br>  John Bradford, a Sydney University student, was on the side of the road hitch hiking on a very dark night and in the midst of a storm.<br>  <br>  The night was rolling on and no car went by. <br>  The storm was so strong he could hardly see a few feet ahead of him.<br>  <br>  Suddenly he saw a car slowly coming towards him and as it drew level it stopped.<br>  <br>  John, desperate for shelter and without thinking about it, got in the car and closed the door, before he realised there was nobody behind the wheel and the engine wasn't on!<br>  <br>  The car started moving slowly forward. <br>  John looked at the road and saw a curve approaching. <br>  Scared, he started to pray, begging for his life. <br>  Then, just before he reached the curve, a hand appeared through the window and turned the wheel.<br>  <br>  John, paralysed with terror, watched how the hand appeared every time they came to a curve. <br>  He then saw the lights of a pub down the road so, gathering strength, he jumped out of the car and ran to it. <br>  Wet and out of breath, he rushed inside and asked for two shots of tequila. <br>  He then started telling everybody about the horrible experience he had just gone through.<br>  <br>  A silence enveloped everybody when they realised he was crying and....he wasn't drunk.<br>  <br>  About 15 minutes later, two guys walked into the same pub. <br>  They were also wet and out of breath. <br>  Looking around and seeing John Bradford sobbing at the bar, one said to the other, <br>  "Look, Bruce.. there's the bloody idiot who got in the car while we were pushing it!!!."|`|Dl9a08Rxaa	ok this story is true and while kinda sad it gets funny lol<br>   <br>  ok so my friend caras family live in a different city and her family was going on vacation and asked cara if she would stay at their house while the were gone and she said ok but the family said that their dog was getting sick and it was really old and may not make it while they were gone<br>  so cara had to fly quite far to get to the house and she got there late in the early morning after flying all night and she sees the dog and it had passed away :( but the family left instruction on what to do for the dog and left the vets number so cara called the vet and they said to bring the dead dog to the vet and it was far away and she could easily take the bus<br>  and cara was really tired and she didnt know the city that well and she didnt know how she was supposed to bring a dead dog on a bus but she emptied her suitcase and put the dog in it and went to the bus stop and got on with the suitcase<br>  she was kinda scared but this man sat beside her and just randomly started talking to her and then asked what was in the suitcase and she said some old text books and stuff cuz she wasnt going to say she had a dead dog<br>  but then she got off the bus and so did the man at the same stop then the man punched her in the face and stole the suitcase with the dead dog and he though it was books<br>  imagine the reaction the man had when he opened it!

0Ifae2qJaa	Probably not what you're after - just thought it'd be funny.<br>  In the song "Girl" there's a bit where it sounds like a backup singing "dit, dit, dit......" but they are actually singing "tit, tit, tit...." . They did it for a laugh because no one would pick it up (or so they thought).<br>  <br>  In Hey Jude just before the "better, better....." bit that goes into the finale, there's a spot where you can faintly hear John go "Oh f*$%^ hell". Apparently he stuffed up on one of the bounced tracks and it wasn't noticed by the sound engineer. It occurs at about 2.55 into the song after the lyric "let her under your skin"|`|1oxBCtmZaa	Ballad of John and Yoko has blasphemy<br>  <br>  Why Don't We Do It In The Road is a bit racy|`|jAmAQj97aa	Actually, there's one Beatles song "I've Got A Feeling" where John messes up a guitar chord, and mutters something close to a cuss....

rnqgiRkWaa	every site you go to will tell you a 50/50 answer.. either its good or it will NOT work. <br>  you two are your complete opposite. you either clash or balance each other out<br>  <br>  it really depends on your other sings (moon and rising) <br>  <br>  but from MY personal experience it will last for a while but it never worked out in the end..<br>  <br>  i disagree with the above.. i am dating a sag and after 1 week of getting to know me told me he loved me and after 3 months asked me to move in. he talks about marriage and kids all the time, we have been dating for 2 years now.. <br>  i am friends with many sag and they also love being in a comited relationship and don't have a problem settling down.<br>  <br>  his ex happens to be a gemini and they dated for one year and it ended badly.. <br>  his cousin in a gemini and they dont get a long either.. <br>  <br>  with the geminis i no and sag they dont really click with eachother. or after awhile get on eacothers nerve.  but it all depends on your full chart.. <br>  <br>  sag bes with: aries, libra<br>  Gemini best with leo and Aquarius<br>  <br>  <br>  go here for it pretty cool <a href="http://www.adze.com/VenusFiles/" rel="nofollow">http://www.adze.com/VenusFiles/</a>|`|cLgwmcfwaa	sounds to me like a very fun combination. Gemini in Venus likes to play around however. He likes to fleet from relationship to relationship and if someone gets hurt, its not his problem. So look out for that, if you get involved with him. Also Gemini bores easily and you need to keep having fun with him and have something exciting happen everyday. <br>  For Sagittarius, none of this should be much of a problem. Sagittarius is VERY fun and also a free-spirit. Sagittarius's dont fall in "serious love" very easily, so they wont be too bothered by Gemini's need for variety. Sagittarius has a need for freedom. You will enjoy eachothers company and have lots of fun together. Both of u like to explore and/or learn something new everyday. it'll be great.

If yes, look for any competitions in your area. Hope you see what I mean. It's this kind of idea to use your skills. Also search an internet for interesting websites, learn about what you're wondering about, go out and watch a movie in your local cinema, go ice skating, go to a park, listen to music and dance/sing, visit your friend, read a book, do your homework that is due next week or something and so on.<br>  I hope I helped.

t5mX3rwLaa	DBGT is really really bad, yes same characters only goku is reversed back to a Little boy like in DB, he sets on a space journey with trunks and pan (gran daughter from gohan). They really ruined it, you may want to watch the last episodes to see goku adopt SuperSayian level 4 but that`s pretty much it|`|7gmdPXc4aa	Yes, but obviously they are all older. Dragonball Z is much better the GT. <br>  <br>  Watch it if your a true fan, just because that way you can see how the characters have ended up (though this isn't how Akira-sama would have had them end up) etc. I was quite disappointed, but it had its high lights I suppose. <br>  <br>  I recommend watching the lastest DBZ movie (done by Akira-sama, Oct 2008), Vegeta's little brother is sooooooo cute!! Okay obvious fangirl here, so I better stop lol.|`|3ug7vwEmaa	GT does have the same characters, I thought that GT was suckish, but that's no reason to stop with DBZ.  You won't know if you like unitl you watch it.

GT is non cannon.|`|wic6ut7Qaa	IMO, the original Dragon Ball beats them both, since it's actually original and has some semblance of a plot, not to mention that it was groundbreaking at the time.<br>  <br>  Stop at Z, GT is awful.|`|ndXvMLZ2aa	Dragonball Z was awesome! DBGT does have pretty much all the characters as DBZ. It does have Bulma, Gohan, Yamcha and the others in it. Well, DBGT, in my opinion, was just ok.

u2TdzRmWaa	It depends what kind of movies you like.<br>  (I'm assuming you haven't read the book.)<br>  It's really cool, kind of creepy, not scary though.<br>  If you liked Tim Burton movies you should probably like this one it was directed by Henry Selick, the same guy who did The Nightmare Before Christmas. I thought it was pretty cool. A lot of people are saying that it's a scary movie but it really isn't. It's a bit disturbing and creepy but amazingly well written, directed and animated. So if you like quirky movies than you will definitely like this one. So far I haven't spoken to anyone who didn't like it so I'm pretty sure you will. If you want to wait until the end of the credits it will tell you a special code so you can buy limited edition "Coraline Nike"s online. (you probably don't care but it's always good to know, nobody told me and I really want those shoes, lol.) It looks a lot like a kids movie but I went with my mum and we both really enjoyed it.|`|rlEHMByoaa	Your parents should watch it with you.  My parents loved it so much, they agreed to go see it again.  The movie is really good.  No, its not worth watching it in 3D.  We paid $40 to go see it in 3D, hoping it would be good, but the glasses made the whole screen seem really dark.  So 3D is not really worth the money...|`|CvkuzcpDaa	i havent seen it...but i read the book...and the movie looks really weird!! but you should go and ee it, maybe it  might be good?? enjoy! xx

Stop drooling over a fairy tale, get your mouth off the guys nuts, etc.!<br>  <br>  If you want to watch some movies that are actually GOOD, look at this ALL-TIME BEST MOVIES LIST.  Every one of these was a mind-blowing awesome experience for me, AND for the critics, AND for everyone else. haha you can't go wrong with these movies!<br>  ===============================<br>  <br>  Here's the best movies (in order from best to worst) from each genre. This was decided between best movies of all time according to critics, best movies by people's ratings, and my personal preference.<br>  <br>  Chick-flicks: The Notebook, The Titanic, 50 first dates, fools gold, and theres something about mary. (Don't have too much for this)<br>  <br>  Action: Terminator 2, Die Hard 1, Batman: The Dark Knight, Rambo: First Blood, Apocalypto, Gladiator, Eraser, Predator, Aliens, Mission: Impossible.<br>  <br>  Futuristic/Dystopian (these are the ones Im best with- REALLY good movies): A Clockwork Orange, The Island, Brazil, Minority Report, Wings of Desire, Children of Men, Ghost In The Shell, 1984, V for Vendetta, Blade Runner, Planet of the Apes, Mad Max.<br>  <br>  Comedy: Liar Liar, Ace Ventura: Pet detective, Rat Race, Monty Python and the Holy Grail, American Pie 1 & 2, Blazing Saddles, Animal House, Dodgeball, Caddyshack, Dumb and Dumber, Ghostbusters, Superbad, The Big Lebowski.<br>  <br>  Boxing/gangs/city movies: Rocky, The Godfather, Scarface, Goodfellas, Dirty Harry, Raging Bull (boxing), Resorvoir Dogs, American Gangster, The Usual Suspects, Boondock Saints (if you're Irish), Million Dollar Baby, Training Day.<br>  <br>  Sports/racial films: Remember the Titans, American History X, Hoosiers, Bull Durham, The Natural, Friday Night Lights, Hoop Dreams, Visionquest, Caddyshack, White Men Can't Jump, Rudy, Slap Shot, Coach Carter. (These are actually ALL REALLY CLOSE and all are extremely good... see them all!)<br>  <br>  Scary/Horror movies (great at these too): The Shining, Psycho, It, 28 days later (and 28 weeks later is also good), The Exorcist, The Thing, The Butterfly Effect, Silence of the Lambs, The Ring, The Grudge, Se7en, Texas Chainsaw Massacre, Night of the Living Dead.<br>  <br>  War Movies (ill only list a few great ones): Saving Private Ryan, Enemy At The Gates, Braveheart, Schindlers List, We Were Soldiers, Full Metal Jacket, The Patriot, The Hunt for Red October, The great escape.<br>  <br>  Martial Arts Movies: Enter the Dragon, Bloodsport, The Chinese Connection, Fearless, Ong Bak: Thai Warrior, Drunken Master, Fists of Fury, the Shaolin Temple, Game of Death, Hero, Iron Monkey.<br>  <br>  Fantasy: Lord of the Rings, Harry Potter, Chronicles of Narnia, (and then Twilight is even worse than the many movies NOT mentioned lol).<br>  <br>  Superhero Movies: batman begins, batman: dark knight, spiderman 1 and 2, iron man, X2: Xmen United, Superman: The movie, The Incredibles.

DKDkXgfOaa	It depends on which kind of guy you want to attract and how the color looks with your face shape and skin color.|`|jMAn10NOaa	pink/red/blue will work better|`|9QeV07zJaa	Don't dye your hair at all, Try a confident smile. It can be very attractive. If you just want to attract attention, die the left side black and the right side platinum. Don't get it backwards, they will think you are weird.|`|kf9fSVOYaa	i don't think it matters because you shouldn't have to change yourself to make a guy like you. if he doesn't like you as you are then hes obviously not in the relationship for you just for the looks.|`|9G5m0Mgjaa	I find the contrast of the girls eye and skin color match their hair the best.  If a girl has light skin and bright eyes then blonde's the best.  A girl with dark eyes and skin then brunettes the best.

CqfQI5NSaa	You can do Work experience at the BBC, but radio one would be harder to get. I know that this year they did a competition to win work experience at radio 1, that's how much it's contested for. But if you write a lot of letters, show a lot of interest you will improve your chances. The bbc website will have the details for work experience there, although you really need to email them NOW if you want a chance to do it this year. They recommend you ask in January for a summer work experience slot.
tLI94qWNaa	M?me, La  (2007) <br>  <br>  An un-chronological look at the life of the Little Sparrow, édith Piaf (1915-1963). Her mother is an alcoholic street singer, her father a circus performer, her paternal grandmother a madam. During childhood she lives with each of them. At 20, she's a street singer discovered by a club owner who's soon murdered, coached by a musician who brings her to concert halls, and then quickly famous. Constant companions are alcohol and heartache. The tragedies of her love affair with Marcel Cerdan and the death of her only child belie the words of one of her signature songs, "Non, je ne regrette rien." The back and forth nature of the narrative suggests the patterns of memory and association.|`|8gaPElwxaa	The Little Sparrow - just a guess
mur5R4cgaa	A good song to listion to at a what ever kinda moment would probably be something cheerful like Im Your's by Json Mraz or probably anything by Natasha Bedingfield.

No I have never heard of the person|`|VHxZuaOfaa	I have never herd of that woman and how would she be famous.|`|mNWgzQDOaa	These people are ridiculously stupid if they don't think it's a good idea to use your aunt as a resource. She's family, anyone would ask family for help especially if they had the connections.<br>  <br>  I don't think you should talk to her to gain "fame"... it's not something you acquire automatically. Maybe just e-mail her asking for help on where to start off, if she knows of any jobs (even small ones).<br>  <br>  & I'd rather not answer question 2 because it's irrelevant.|`|woK6mApGaa	1. not really<br>  <br>  2, ive never heard of shirley sypert|`|iJXFZx7taa	Wow! Sucking up to your aunt?<br>  That's not shallow at all!|`|d7b8f18c89ed9f003ea45f3b4aeb20ceaa	My very close family friend is big in opera and those<br>  plays, and shes been in La Boheme and stuff.<br>  & i really want to be famous too, but i dont think<br>  you should suck up to her.. being shallow is not the way<br>  to go. Try to actually show your talent, like even if shes<br>  seen you sing unintentionally (i think thats how you spell it)<br>  then maybe she'll suggest things just like some of my family<br>  members have done, and are now supporting me all the way.<br>  I think you should just continue to be dedicated, and stay<br>  true to yourself, and just try to get yourself heard the normal<br>  way. Start off by being in some musicals or sign up for the talent show ( : hope i helped.. never give up your dreams.|`|Ccj8Y0tZaa	i would do it if i were you, ive never herd of her btw, alot of famous people are famous because of who there related to so a dont see why you shutnt do it

AA12390047	They got married in Connecticut where gay weddings are legal.  So they'll have to get their annulment in CT also.  <br>  Funny that when they came home to PA, their marriage isn't recognized as being legal.  Just in certain states.|`|UY3zl9dFaa	As Leslie said, the wedding took place in CT. They had it there especially because gay marriage is legal there and it's relatively close to PA (not as close as they made it seem w/ everyone zipping back and forth. That's probably why you didn't notice).|`|NGNeT3rYaa	They didn't get married in PA, they got married in CT, where it is legal.|`|ADBMrG87aa	The annullment is possible because Bianca and Reese got married in Connecticut where gay marriages are legal/valid.<br>  <br>  (\__/)<br>  (='.'=)<br>  (")-(")<br>  Sweetie|`|GrE1UM2Saa	I thought gay marriages were only allowed in Massachusetts because I'm from MA and from what I know Massachusetts is the first and only state to allow gay marriages.|`|AA11451041	They were married in CT.

u9RwzLPnaa	this is a comic forum but to answer your question.<br>  <br>  Perhaps because the actor that plays Chris Rock as a kid has a deeper voice then Chris has now.<br>  <br>  It funny hearing a higher pitch voice coming from the older person then when the kid version speaks it's much deeper. Uh oh, I think it's time to get a new kid. They should have made it a cartoon so they could get a woman and thus the voice wouldn't change on them in the intervening years. Boondocks has there boy characters actually voiced by a woman. Reigan King!|`|fawhiGtsaa	Currently has 88 episodes.|`|31TUT9lpaa	None of these answers are right and the voice change one doesn't make sense. he's suppose to be aging in the school.

Also, my grandad has traced the family down to 1794, and every first-born son has been called John since then (or before, we don't know).  But his brother had four girls and no sons and so the tradition has stopped, and my grandma wouldn't name my dad John just to spite her mother-in-law!|`|Gojbv3Nraa	Never stand on a tall ladder when the only other person in the room "likes" you enough to jiggle it a bit.|`|bznQW3QYaa	Nope|`|hZ9omSataa	the day is still young...|`|OjS2wJZWaa	Of course...I improved my english!|`|4884c661c8938910239d7729a16fc338aa	Yes I learned not not to jog in our school's cafeteria in the morning to catch up to my friend.<br>  <br>  The floor was wet my feet slid out from underneath me and I almost fell.

He can do what ever the *&#! he wants.|`|RNpaBwxzaa	I can sort of see this happening, maybe.<br>  In response to what bluer said, Deadpool is not a superhero. He doesn't give a crap about saving the world, and he has no moral standings whatsoever. He is a mercenary. He works for whatever side will pay him the most, then mercilessly stab his allies in the back when the other side offers him more. If Stryker paid him enough, he could definately set him up as a hitman for Wolverine and Sabretooth.
L2mJmZDtaa	Yes, he said so on his show today.|`|uLslm1b6aa	yeah...i think. look it up
ab250551cde4aadbf54a0fea8a7b14e1aa	Luke (Paul Newman), a prisoner in a Florida prison camp, refuses to submit to "the system". His inability to conform drives the plot of the movie, in the same way as the character Randle McMurphy from One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest. Luke is looked upon as a leader and inspiration for the underdogs of society. However, his spirit is broken when he is repeatedly beaten and made to dig a large hole, fill it, and re-dig it again and again. McMurphy was the inspirational leader of the group of patients in the psych ward. His spirit, too, was broken, when he received a lobotomy.<br>  Strother Martin (as "Captain") in Cool Hand Luke would be on the same level as Louise Fletcher's "Nurse Ratched" in One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest.

People look at me weird for building a snowpile, but that's okay. But I never do stuff like throw public tantrums, hurtle scatological insults at people, or spurn supper for junk food. One thing I like to play with is kiddie musical instruments, you'd be surprised at the cool sounds some of those toy trumpets, keyboards, pianos, accordians, etc make.<br>  <br>  The way I see it, as long as what you do is harmless fun, however weird it may be, it's perfectly fine.|`|RpxKmUBUaa	YES....I will run through the stores dancing with my bf, and dance for no apparent reason...and I'm 20, and he's 21!

This is not Funny..to a bald guy  |---  |-----------Hair Gel--------|||"|""\__  |___________________-|||_|___|)  !(@)'(@)""""**!(@)(@)****!(@)|`|yBZlTzWLaa	I typically have the most unmanageable wavy hair. I've tried to get it to behave for years, but it always reverts to an asymmetrical wavy/frizzy triangle. Today however, I managed to straighten it (and keep it straight all day!) and I'll tell you how:    1. I washed with Bed Head Control Freak shampoo  2. I then used Pantene Pro-V Smooth & Sleek conditioner  3. I let my hair air dry until it was damp, but not sopping wet.  4. I rubbed a small amount of got2b defiant pomade in my palms, then ran it over and through the length of my hair, smoothed the remainder over the entire surface, and held my hair in place at the ends for about 20 seconds. (There are better pomades out there, I'm just poor. This brand does the job, just be sure whatever you pick is stronger than a cream pomade, but lighter than spiking gel. It should look a bit like glittery Vaseline).  5. I used a narrow ceramic flat iron, moving at a medium pace, and curling inward slightly at the tips, as my hair tends to flip outward.  6. I used Bed Head Spoil Me hairspray (it's a light hold smoothing spray, and it leaves your hair feeling soft, not sticky).  7. After 1 minute I took another pass with the flat iron.  8. Lastly I gave my hair a light, gentle final spray with the Bed Head Spoil Me (far enough from my head to avoid blowing my hair out of place,) then finally smoothed the surface with my hands (once).|`|G5vGTTqhaa	Mine is calm today thankfully|`|fT15YEkFaa	no my hair is perfect again today|`|HAhm1TUoaa	My hair permanently looks like somebody has rubbed it with a towel.

I'm right here with you, I use to go to school every morning and not even unpack because I knew the fire alarm would be going off soon. It was "tradition". I never even learned anything in that class because I always had to miss half of it.|`|xbbEbvxnaa	Education is important for everyone.  One of the general rules for survival is education.  Some get it faster than others.  The most important person is you, if you survived and finished school, then you are a star:)  Keep up the good work.|`|d23F89ECaa	I think you can legally chose to drop out at 15 or 16.    At least you could when I was a pup.  I dropped out at 16 and joined the military.  Not because I didn't care in school or didn't take it seriously, I tried really hard.  I really did.  I just wasn't good at it.  I couldn't read until I was 12 and the teachers just passed me along to the next grade so they didn't have to deal with me.  Eventually, it all came to the point where I was literally unable to continue.  I left and joined up in the army.  They taught me to read and write and I finished high school through their graduate program.    Now, I know just how important an education is.  Because I don't have one.  I'd do anything to go back and get help.|`|ahAOjZ9Vaa	Because it is compulsory.     If we do not have enough doctors, who will take care of the ill?   If we don't have enough teachers, how will children who want a successful future fulfill their dream?  If don't have enough people in school, then how many people will suffer poverty?   If your country is filled with the lowest ''literate'' nation then how would you feel if you could never get your hands on an ipod?       We need people to go to school:   Doctors   Lawyers  Teachers   Business People (your ipod)   Movie Directors (your ''Twilight'')   Aeronautic engineering (going abroad)     Think of all those things girl.|`|NdEsPwbuaa	Not sure, but probably some government rule, anyhow here is a bit of history.  20 years ago - year 11-12  optional.  40 years ago - year 9-10-11-12 optional.  60 years ago - year 6-7-8-9-10-11-12 optional.  80 years ago school optional.  New rule coming into effect soon: university optional. All lower grades compulsory.  Maybe in 40 years time post graduate studies will not be optional. This could mean that before the end of this century, our children's children will need a Degree with post grad. Studies to allow them to watch paint dry or grass to grow. All in the name of higher education.|`|l9UoJn9Caa	it cant be optional because the law made us have to go.  so we can get more education.  if it wasn't for school education most people would be like stupid.|`|ev5bTH5raa	I hate to say this... but perhaps the girl who is home schooled is the best answer... count the spelling mistakes...    You have to go to school because people need a basic level of education, and even if teenagers are disrupting the class they will be learning something that will be useful to them in later life.|`|zEp6xHacaa	they can and then work at the gas station for the rest of their life, YAY!|`|f2c691cb03d9d6b21303d0a416f0ad3daa	Its just like that cuz it is and thats life :||`|6swsBRzVaa	Because life is not fair|`|4f8d8369ef1509758bf98e8adc3d5af2aa	to keep dumbass kids off the steets so the grown folks can do grown folk things|`|fmr98EBtaa	Well, the problem was not them, it was the teacher who should have reprimanded them and their parents who should have placed an interest and emphasis on their education.    In some Asian countries the students ask their teacher every morning "Will you please teach me today?" and even if the teacher has gone past the time allotted for the class, they will continue to sit there until the teacher has finished. School is a very important part of our nation because the education level of our population has to do with what jobs they can get and therefore how well our economy functions both on a national and international level.|`|F6U9eM6Gaa	LOL that's where i come in and what i do! it's called homeschooling where you learn at the rate you want and your perants teach you help teach you. the only down side is that you have to have one of your perants not working. you would be surprised how big the homeschooling comunity is! if you want more info e-mail me at   zeldahambone@gmail.com  thanks!|`|HVY2rqzfaa	Because you will have an army of uneducated, un disciplined brats roaming the streets and probably not contributing to society in any way whatsoever.

h1IYS0dbaa	Not true!<br>  <br>  Real women are not into chick flicks but into real movies. Only chicks are into chick flicks.<br>  <br>  However, if you think that all romantic movies are chick flicks, you'd be not a real man either...|`|tLI94qWNaa	Count me out as one of those women, I am a sci fi/fantasy/horror women.|`|4mkyTYXDaa	First off, you say chick flicks are not real movies;just because you may not be a big fan they have some pretty underlying thoughts and ideas,  their not just all about tears and failed romances.well not all. as corny as they may be they do have more than that...<br>  <br>  And "chick flicks" which you call not real movies,well you must've heard of one of them THE TITANIC, it WON 11 OSCARS & was NOMINATED for 3!! :0 :)<br>  <br>  also not to mention won and was nominated for countless others!! <br>  <br>  and also seriously <what were you thinking> mean girls was a brilliantly and creatively written story by SNL's Tina Fey ; how could you! :p<br>  <br>  <br>  Finally Twilight! you shouldnt even list that as a movie at all,,just a failed atttempt at capturing a well written novel into film!<br>  <br>  <br>  * Those views are what i think,and believe; and if you dont agree, well then err thats great :) *|`|KTM6D9Aqaa	HEY! I may be a girl but you can't automatically assume that I LOVE chick flicks! but to answer your question, I have watched my fair share of chick flicks and the reason some girls love them sooooo much is because there is this alternate universe we see in the movies that we want... you know the giant closet filled with designer labels, the hot model bf, etc... BTW couldn't watch Twilight, am in love with Slumdog Millionaire and can't  wait for the Watchmen to come out....|`|y5kXh0QEaa	Girls ask the same question about us guys, just replace the "chick flick" with "action/horror movie".<br>  <br>  As for myself, I like everything, as long as it's good.  There are much less people with my movie taste out there.<br>  <br>  To clarify, I thought Mean Girls was really funny and even smart (I'm a sucker for Tina Fey), but I didn't like Twilight at all.|`|AA10979391	i like other movies too but i think most women can somewhat relate to the chick flicks i guess!!

Z5mmaFK0aa	On more of a mainstream note so that more users can relate to this if they even read it =P<br>  <br>  I would say that most rock music fans or alternative fans like Radiohead I would say they have a pretty good reputation for delivering good music so I would say that most would expect Radiohead to Deliver|`|GG8x2kmfaa	Slayer!|`|tsjLHXzUaa	I expect too much from all modern bands: good music, ethical and humble behavior, a desire to create art and inspire instead of profit.<br>  <br>  And yes, I do Limewire everything!

Fear of neither|`|2PTlXs9zaa	Yes, but more nervous butterfly's - thinking of it now, I wouldn't be eating much and then I would get a cold (they're going around) because my resistance is down.  800 miles? two small kids, plenty of dvd's and music and???

I figure...life's too short to miss out on adventure....|`|aajzynKsaa	Fear of dreaming.    Once you near Wyoming, there's not   much to hit.

I mean if your afraid of accidents then you should probably never drive a car. If your afraid of getting lost, if you see people the pretty good chance your not lost, YOU just dont know where you are. If your afraid of dying, then you should probably have never lived to began with cause we all die.....so ...I ask what are you afraid/nervous of?|`|X4FQBmo9aa	I love big moves.    Flying or Driving are both fine with me.    Before you start the drive be sure to get a great playlist. 800 miles could be done in one day, but if you have the time you might want to cut it in half especially if you are driving alone and are not used to driving regularly.    If you are driving a U-Haul, I recommend stopping for the night at motels where you can back into a spot right in front of your room.  That way if someone tries to break into it or steal it, you are right there.  Also, put a lock on it.  That way it will be safer at rest stops and at your motel.    Don't forget to have fun with it.  New sights, new places, new hopes.|`|TsmqhvZHaa	yes i do but excited too.    I prefer flying

Hs011wnraa	Hopefully soon, I don't know why everyone loves her. She hasn't done anything special. Has she stopped war, found a cure for cancer? No, all she's done is marry a cheater.

LOL|`|tg4K6bIYaa	yes|`|R7FmZb3Qaa	I don't really get this question. I know thou, people keep adding me and I don't know them. Yes, just block them.

Zky0yJqCaa	Yep......... nuff said.    And why are some of these people YELLING at you!!|`|3LL1Hb7Yaa	No. Greedy lazy producers have by copy catting everything.|`|GRyFxwTbaa	No.    Mtv did, long before them.    The Buggles were right.    http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XWtHEmVjV...|`|7gHnVJpyaa	What they do is not music. It is fabricated image, marketed as music to the artistically ignorant. The "musical" component of what they are is no more than an excuse to sell the rest of what they are.    The American music industry hasn't had much integrity since MTV.    American music will live on, it's just going through a Dark Age right now. There will always be people with great talent and insight who are personally connected to what they create, and some of them will be Americans.|`|rLP9wjPtaa	I thought those were kids TV shows. No one considers that real music.|`|oRamqEGyaa	yes.  i hate them. both.  they both suck.  they really should both die. both|`|MFjbr8t4aa	I don't like either of them.      So, YES.|`|Lq9tBgdaaa	American music was destroyed by hippity hop.|`|zV70m8eJaa	absolutely they have.|`|d23F89ECaa	This took place in the 80's.    It's only a trend now that is getting worse and worse.    In a couple years, all it will take to make a record is static white noise and dumb people will shell out millions.|`|6Nmly1wmaa	Yes I agree with the first person who answered|`|Yyt8ZjU2aa	they helped contribute to it... but the integrity of American music was destroyed way before them|`|keJDzQg5aa	yes they definitely have.|`|eUFsTmlsaa	The Jonas Brothers haven't but Miley Cyrus is a disgrace to the music industry!|`|681671b8db63cde85f65759dcf0f542caa	Obviously, you are too young to remember the boy band craze of the late 80's and early 90's. They aren't any worse than NKOTB, N'Sync, The Backstreet Boys, and the tons of other groups who polluted the airwaves during that time.|`|8lTjwBEzaa	I don't think so Jonas Bros. have promise rings and Miley... well all teen stars go through "stages" just give them time to learn she hasn't done anything bad except the picture with a banket thing she said sorry everything else is a lie.|`|9A3hT0riaa	ya thay both suck euuuuuuuuu  Jones Brothers are f*** gays and Miley is an a** holl!!  so what do u think!  i think that the Jones Brothers stile is a bit like Elvis's stile|`|hlino21Qaa	no that was done a long time ago, they are just puppets to a main stream machine that pumps out ok music. 20 years from now, they will be on VH1s where are they now.|`|vZxrQh4Jaa	Yes.|`|BZEN8QXbaa	Yes! :(|`|8MZuVAKiaa	Amen.|`|m2NUw8mpaa	yes. because they suck. end of story. bye bye.|`|lsoKbkcoaa	Hells yeah they have...  THEY SUCK!!!!  IDK y ppl are even still talking about them anymore...|`|dDprsKZYaa	Nope. Britney and Jessica Simpson already took care of that.|`|xFm5wzuXaa	Did you never hear "Who let the Dogs Out" or the Electric Slide, **** music has been around for a long time and people who listen to it are just stupid band-wagon idiots who end up fat administrative assistants who watch Grey's Anatomy and Desperate Housewives so who cares?|`|frwlypDWaa	They're Disney spawn. Blame Disney.|`|Jvmuri5naa	Pretty much, what with all their stupud music that all sounds the same... I don't mind 'Fly on the Wall' by Miley Cyrus (cause me and my friends take the mickey out of it) or 'Lovebug' by the Jonas Brothers though...|`|XDfrSfrvaa	the JONAS BROTHERS yes  i like some of MILEY CYRUS's songs----(i know i'll get lots of thumbs down for this)oooops|`|gUdlaaGwaa	I don't mind the jobros-music a bit immature but singing and instrument playing is ok. Miley isn't a good singer but somehow she has a market for her music.|`|4WCLWhaTaa	I have insufficient information. I know nothing about either.   And my integrity remains where it always has been...|`|xoVA08Zaaa	Absolutely, and the integrity of the American role-model...at least Miley anyways|`|yRE2HDr3aa	No there is still plenty of good music in America.. 80% the mainstream has turned to sh*t|`|1b9d6f92644c7ecc734f3330365356a8aa	There's been no good American music since the mid 80s

zyTrMeovaa	Up and down and in a warm bathtub. The warm water will help induce bleeding. Up and down makes it harder to stop the bleeding once it starts. If you are truly serious shot gun in mouth is the most sure way.|`|jYmvtUC5aa	...looks cooler on the screen if some wicked one slices and dices  the wrist in a sideways motion........no personal experience but  lets not find out shall we......|`|IizPFrELaa	Up and down is the correct way to slice ones wrist.  Movies are just dumb like that!|`|4f8d8369ef1509758bf98e8adc3d5af2aa	yes that is correct because up and down will sever more veins and is harder to sew up|`|frwlypDWaa	Up and down doesn't work as well. Side to side severs the artery, and guarantees success.     To me, up and down just screams, "LOOKING FOR ATTENTION!"...|`|BwZJXbSjaa	the correct way really is up and down- you have  a better chance of damaging the veins and bleeding out faster. some movies actually do have that as the proper way (the craft). but i guess maybe they dont show it that way so people dont blame the movie and try to sue when their kid slit their wrists.      wow i got all serious and smart there. must be all those years of mental damage and depression|`|bBHlGs5waa	You can really do anyway.|`|AI4My948aa	In movies, Martin Short can look tall.|`|dShUF6A9aa	Idk I have never cut my wrists before..i'm not emo.|`|3FFAIMpLaa	That is so it drips on the floor and not on the actor's clothes.  That way they can use the clothing in another movie.|`|uQUqZ7k5aa	up and down will completely open up the vain. side to side can work but you need multiple cuts or it will be a very slow painful bleed. i think they do side to side because it looks better.|`|s6qgkfLxaa	Either. Up and down is if you want to die. side to side is if you're "leaking the pain"...     But if correctly done from side to side there is a chance of cutting a vein that will kill you also. . .     You should really watch the movie Wristcutters: a love story, it's really good.|`|3LL1Hb7Yaa	That is not a question you should be asking on here, even if you are only joking.    Suicide really isn't funny.|`|GRyFxwTbaa	Movie magic.    Much like those fancy L-shaped sheets that cover up a woman's chest but displays the man's down to the waist.|`|rdBKZerlaa	We should discuss this over coffee and bagels    **backs away slowly**|`|lnZyIc6Haa	I'm not into that kind of stuff but for movies I guess it gives more visual effects.|`|R7FmZb3Qaa	What does it matter? If you are asking this question because you wanna cut your self, you are stupid. I don'tt know why people do that! God made you to be alive and well. Not to be cutting yourself and eventuallyaccidentallyy cut a vain. So I am not answering this because I know you will use the info to cut your self.|`|X5gPgYkbaa	well they mostly do it for the pain relief..  so thats why it's side to side i got told    but if yuu really want to end yuur life..  then from where yuu feel yuur pulse and just follow the vein  (:    XX|`|RCJqaWQYaa	Who cares?  One way or the other..  Self-harming, is stupid.|`|0154e31673244b2bea94b54516ec675aaa	that is correct because if you do it side to side when you hands get tired they will bend and bend which will stop the bleeding|`|t9qXQI19aa	Up and down actually slices a bigger hole in the main artery, making it a quicker bleed. Side to side would work, but would take longer.|`|XS0ltAYaaa	The best way to slit your wrists is to use two sharp blades with a match stick in between \\ |`|wd87J7Vsaa	Across, you don't bleed as much. "down the road" you are completely opening your vein giving more of an opportunity to bleed out more. they show it in movies the way they do bc usually, the people doing in the wrong way are complete morons anyway. I|`|AA11523465	I heard that up and down is most effective.|`|EiB6GNxlaa	omg.. you do know how to push the limits.. ha ha..     If the actors did it up and down they would go through too many actors..|`|T6zwrzsoaa	up and down will get the job done better because now you are cutting the veins lengthwise and that is much more effective and harder to stop the bleeding.  much more, it's harder to repair if you are at the hospital.  sideways is a common point of view but can be easily controlled.

tLI94qWNaa	I am a huge fan of serj tankian and loved his work in System of a down, but he is doing a wonderful job as a solo artist.     I am having the hardest time thinking of a movie though, I have thought of the show Buffy the vampire slayer being a great use for this song when angel and buffy are in a love triangle so to speak, or when she is with spike.  But as for a movie all that comes to mind is silence of the lambs or twilight for some reason.

AQmcZ0gYaa	Play a little game i like to call up the river,     First shuffle  Then deal everyone 5 cards  Then put four community cards out in the middle of the table face down.  Now the fun begins, flip one over, now the betting begins, its like an auction, you bid on the community card.  Bidding goes around the table once someone says they dont want it they are out for at least that community card.  Once the card is bought, the person who buys it must put one of their 5 cards in its {comunity card} place.  And the auction begins once again on his card he threw.  This keeps on going to all at the table dont want the comunity card that face up, then move on to the second comunity card.  This could go on all night or fairly quikly.   Once you have done this and the 4 community card spots have run their course, then one final bet is made on your hand.    This is one of my favorite games, pots usually get to bout 20-40 dollars when we play with quarters!!!|`|UokOCcn5aa	it depends on which type of poker it is.|`|JKRgfXFXaa	well what kind of poker.... texas holdem, 7 card stud, omaha ???|`|qJPiyGdqaa	i dont know too.  haha.  i dont know how to play   poker and blackjack!          =]|`|1ZVtTII8aa	don't know how to play poker either :PPxx    I love blackjack though!!|`|AA11402617	This link can explain it to you better than I ever could.

12QJ9QMRaa	Symphonic Metal?    Well, if I got to sell you, you don't have any ear for music. (JK, Pers, I know better).    But, when you listen, it is the perfect blend of Beauty and the Beast.    You have the beauty and complexity associated with Baroque and Classical music.  The sheer ability to think in terms of 30 plus musicians and their instruments melding together into one living, breathing organism is breathtaking in and of itself.  The technicality and subtle shifts that can be accomplished with so much coming together simply cannot be achieved with a few instruments.    Then you combine it with the Brutal precision assocaited with Heavy Metal.  In many ways, the more technical Metal is the modern day analog of Classical.  Many Classical Snobs scoff at it, but the more open minded conducters don't view things as to what "Tree" music descends from.  It has to do with the complexity of the arrangements, the precision of the playing, and the thing that many of those pencil necks lack, the PASSION and emotion that the music evokes.     Listen to Mozart and Vivaldi, and tell me what they would compose today?  Would they limit themselves to a music form that has stagnated for 200 years?  Play simplistic hooky Pop, or be content sampling?  No.  Mozart even acted the part of the first MetalHead, a true wildman in an era of conformity.    No music todayy can bring such primal raw emotions to the surface as Metal.  Now temper them with the subtle tones, and swelling harmonies of the Symphony and add the touch of Choral voices.    THAT, my friend is music at it's peak, at least for today until it evloves further into something new and even more extraordiary.    Want Proof????   Listen:  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_o6lX_qdl...  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3E4icx7U8...  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U6LRK5mXH...|`|S6RfUHuxaa	1- fav genre is : heavy metal  2- why i luv it : cuz it's heavy n always fits my mood  3- bands : disturbed - slipknot - killswitch engage -atreyu  4- HEAVY METAL RULES !!!|`|kP0JGI1waa	1.  Doom metal    2.  Doom metal is really slow and crushing, its like someone is driving a clawhammer into your head...and doing it slowly so as to extract maximum pain.  The riffs in doom metal are incredible, and they are well crafted because they cannot hide a poor riff by playing it fast.      3.  For a beginner, I would start with the earlier doom metal songs, which are less heavy and slow than some of the newer stuff.  Good starter songs are Sinister by Pentagram, Burial at Sea by Saint Vitus, Solitude by Candlemass, Devil's Bride by Electric Wizard.    DOOM ON!    EDIT: Hells yeah to the guy below me!|`|ebxwADDcaa	1. Doom metal  2. it is slow and calm while at the same time showing power. also good to sleep to.   3. Mouth of the Architect, Isis, and Cult of Luna|`|9hCezzwRaa	1) Thrash Metal  2) Kick *** heavy riffs, killer drummers!  3) TestAmenT    The best riff ever:  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=85Up9Jzxi...|`|372458a63fdf2cfd5035da966e6ddf39aa	1) Punk    2) The energy, the rawness and the ideals behind it    3) Black Flag, The Stooges, Descendants, The Ramones and The Misfits (Danzig era)|`|C7YbYUYPaa	Classic Rock    I love classic rock because all of the music from those times came with passion and a reason.  Most of the lyrics in those songs mean something or support a certain cause.  The music was all about the movement.     If I could only pick one to introduce you to classic rock, I would pick Led Zeppelin, but Queen would be there too.|`|96AQZUGyaa	1) Metal!!!!!    2) I love how much energy and emotion is put into the music. It sounds like it was made by someone with a lot of passion and a fiery personality (if its good metal). Also it suits my personality well.    3) Slayer. I think they really are the top symbols of what metal is, even if they are only trash metal. So once they've got that understood then they can go into the various iconic genres of metal: the lighter, alternative parts with industrial and numetal and then finally into the darker stuff, the stuff that disturbs some people: Gorgoroth, Barathrum, Behemoth, all that black/death metal.|`|Vhq3GURQaa	One word.

IF....... "IF" they continue making fun of you, pull out your "Diary" and just start writing your feelings down. "Let your love go" as you "Look what you've done" with your life compared to the common Joe out there. Don't make a "Sweet Surrender" to social ways....... be your own independent "Guitar Man."

AA11601079	You HAVE to see "The Graduate" and "The Sting." Those are both true classics, and they both have a lot of humor. Same with "Arsenic and Old Lace."    As for romantic comedies, you should check out "The Philadelphia Story," "The Awful Truth," and "It Happened One Night."     If you want suspense, you have to see "Gaslight," "Rear Window," "Psycho," "Vertigo," and "North by Northwest." Speaking of Hitchcock, I also liked "Spellbound" and "Dial M for Murder."    As for dramas, "To Kill a Mockingbird" and "Rebel Without a Cause" are must-sees. I also liked "The Right Stuff" and LOVED "L.A. Confidential," but those are more recent.    For musicals, you have to see "West Side Story," "The Sound of Music," and "An American in Paris." I enjoyed "Kiss Me, Kate" as well, but it isn't the must-see that many of these other films are.    Do you have cable?

kP0JGI1waa	How does Michael Angelo Batio suck?  No offense, but I do not believe that you can play better than him, or even close for that matter.  He is a really gifted guitar player, and if you are disputing his technical abilities then you really have a poor argument.  If think he is uncreative, then he does have some creativity, I mean if you listen to some of his actual songs and not just youtube vids you will see some slower, melodic stuff.    I am just trying to spark some debate, so I mean no offense or anger to you.    EDIT: Then are you completely disregarding his speed? If you havent listened to it already then check out the Time Traveller solo.  If you can play as fast as that or faster, then show us.

mHsRlpLFaa	The answer to your final question is at the end of this posting, but first I would like to share a political doctrine with you which might offer an interesting aside for you to ponder. Basically, it worked like this:    We, as a nation, offer the same pay and benefits to all members of our society. This allows everyone within our society to access the same resources as everyone else and reduces the importance of status, the measurement of success, etc.     However, this also provides a problem as people may be more inclined to choose a position in society that is "easier" in their minds as they feel they can make the same living doing less work. To counter this, we will offer free education, so that people are encouraged to choose a job that they are interested in and will enjoy. This way, people are able to choose a career path that is enjoyable and still will receive the same pay and benefits as everyone else.    However, as a disclaimer, this method works best on paper, as all political doctrines do, and will not work the same way once implemented into the real world.     The true answer to your final question, however, is that there is no such thing as a universally perfect world, because a perfect world is only perfect to the person that made it. I can develop a view of the world that works for me, and thus exists within my own mind as a perfect world, but it will never be a perfect view of the world for everyone. So, simply put, I would just work on finding a view of the world that you can operate within, as, to me, that would be the ideal conception of a perfect world; one that I can live in.|`|uiKAI8bWaa	And you may ask yourself  How do I work this?

Once they released who the team was behind it though, I was all for it.    It's going to be a great day that friday the 13th.

How much better can it get?|`|u8WyN7cHaa	hate that fcking steamy pile of horse shite they call horror. It's a bloody travesty! I'm talking about Friday the 13th, the original version. So cheesy, so stupid and so boring! Wasted 90 minutes of my life watching that crap. Horrible acting, zero atmosphere, zero ambience, stupid dialogue. Unless the remake is the exact opposite of Friday the 13th (1980), i will give it a pass|`|tLI94qWNaa	I think that it is going to be interesting to see how they pull it off. I am not going into watching  this movie with high hopes, but it should be a nice slasher film.|`|ME4XWNmRaa	I cant wait, i love that franchise and am glad they are giving it a makeover like they did Halloween!|`|mIEiQcyMaa	I admit I am, and I usually don't give remakes a chance.    We'll have to see if it's any good or not!|`|JKQKG3tQaa	I am, it seems to be a far different movie than the orginal, it will be interesting to see how they reinvent the origins through Jason's eyes and not his mothers|`|R5I5Znlmaa	It looks decent and I hope it's at least better than Rob Zombie's remake of Halloween. But it'll probably be just another typical slasher film. I'm also looking forward to the new Transformers teaser trailer. It looks a lot better than the first one.

You have to remember that she is technically an r&b artist and there very few successful one out there so once you become pop and continue to release good music then people will collect. Rihanna has had three albums so i doubt shes going anywhere after the third one was successful.<br>  <br>  anyway to answer your question, Yes it will help. After she recovers and releases a sad album and has a revealing interview with Barbara Walters, she will be bakc on top.|`|iJXFZx7taa	Very true, but now you have just totally harshed my mellow.<br>  =]

Qz3sii2caa	Play like you have a tennis ball in your mouth. If the back of your tongue starts getting too close to the roof of your mouth, your air will spin too fast and you'll get the overtone when you play low. <br>  <br>  With bass flute, it's more about staying very open and warm controlled air. Just like normal flute, you don't want to blow your load all at once, so you'll have to put aside your bari sax techniques for air support. <br>  <br>  If you want to cheat a little, roll the flute inwards (just a little bit, don't make it noticeable to onlookers) towards you when you drop down low. Be careful as rolling the flute inwards can make you go flat, practice with your tuner until you can find that happy medium.<br>  <br>  These may not all be flute teacher approved methods, but I was a woodwind doubler all through high school, college, and a little bit of real life, heh. Sometimes you gotta do what you gotta do. Good luck with the bass flute, it's SO much fun to play!|`|qSRoMhCtaa	i play the flute and its really fun and not that hard. At first it did seem hard to me but once i got use to it, it was easy. <br>  TIPS<br>  Make sure your pressing all the keys<br>  Curl your lips <br>  Blow lightly <br>  I hope ou get interested in the flute becuz i think its great !!!!!

MhjZMgzTaa	I didn't think it was short. My problem with the movie is that it lacked a real plot, direction, it wasn't scary, there was no point, and it was stupid.|`|tLI94qWNaa	I thought it was too long, too long and boring and pointless.|`|56bNLJykaa	Bad movie.. and it was only 86 minutes.. thats why- very short|`|TyydcRfeaa	YEs. I AGREE with you!<br>  <br>  First off, it is short. About 70 minutes story followed by 10 minutes credits. Even like this, it dragged pretty bad and I found myself thinking it's probably not worth staying for the rest.<br>  <br>  The writer spends a lot of time detailing the current situation between the two main stars, but leaves it with a mysterious air. I didn't think it endeared you too much with the characters.<br>  <br>  If you're going for the suspense factor, I think you'll enjoy it. You feel like something/someone could jump out at any moment. Every time you catch a glimpse of one of the strangers, you get weirded out.<br>  <br>   --slow, amateur, senseless, but creepy--|`|y5kXh0QEaa	It was relatively short because it was the writer/director's first film and he didn't have the experience to add more to it.<br>  <br>  Unlike you, I had the feeling that it was too long, but I didn't much care for this one.

c1uPd9MMaa	Yup, there IS gonna be a follow up. The announcement has been made that the new series will air starting from April 2009. The teaser has been thrown on youtube and Anitube: http://animetastic.net/index.php?option=...    Also, there are several specials that came along with the release of the first movie. There are five in total. Most of interest for you would be "The Reflections Special", which reflects on the whole series and the movie. I suggest to watch at least the last 15 minutes of it, it's awesome ^^.    Next there are a few small ones, including the 3 minute OVA "Kids", which is a spoiler on how Eric spends his days. Then there are the "Live action", "Chibi Party" and "State versus Homnculi" specials.    You should be able to watch the lot at http://animetastic.net/index.php?option=...  If your search for "alchemist" here, it should pop up all ova's,|`|DPcIjHHZaa	sorry but there isn't i'm a huge fan of the series.i hope they make one|`|3N2ElzcQaa	No    I'm not about to watch like a huge make-over of how the brothers are going to find utanium in Germany while its the Depression Era.     The new FMA season will be based on the manga. Hopefully, the creator, Arakawa, will be helping with the script and such. She didn't participate for the script for the anime FMA. Arakawa had to create more of her manga, FMA.

dJnRFpWWaa	I don't think that there is a film genre that is "best." Documentaries frequently probe interesting subject matter in a direct fashion and have great educational value (and they can and should be artfully produced, thus adding to their aesthetic value) but because their entertainment value is minimal how do you compare them to other genres that primarily seek to entertain or to pose questions about the human experience in a more indirect and artful manner.    Movie genres such as action, comedy, foreign, indie, historical drama, westerns, romance, suspense, et cetera fill the entertainment void and compete within and across genres. Personally, I'm drawn to certain genres like noir and westerns, and I'm leery of sci-fi, but I sample most genres, other than modern horror, which I generally despise, and I judge the movie based upon how well the acting and writing and the manner in which the director has told the story captivated me.    In the past, a number of great directors dominated particular genres, at least for a period of time, that I think made those genres compelling. Directors like John Ford, Alfred Hitchcock, Howard Hawks, Mel Brooks, Woody Allen, et al, set high standards for the genre that others had to aspire to meet or exceed. That's no longer true. Modern directors constantly switch genres, and so their impact is dissipated (unless fans follow them across genres as opposed to staying within one or two genres) and standards have declined over time as well. Which may be coincidence or not.    Lastly, I'm male, and I'm pretty sure I'm old enough to be your father, and that's all that you're getting out of me.
