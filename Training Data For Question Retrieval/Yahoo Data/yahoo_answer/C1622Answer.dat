KNi7gCMpaa	Rooms, as its called, is just that...basic lodging. Ironically though, it sets right next to the Jamaican Grand Hotel...one of the better Hotels in Ocho Rios ( Ochi ).<br>  <br>  Its situated right in the heart of Ochi, so walking to anywhere you want to go is do-able. The pricing of things is hit & miss, as your EASILLY spotted & targeted as a "rich tourist", so the shops that don't have prices marked on items will try to get over and charge more....use JA dollars when possible, its too hard to do quick conversions, so you'll get better prices on things. The stores that sell food, the pricing is there, so no worries...however, food cost alot in Jamaica, so expect double on everything ( a can of pringles in the states, $1.00, in JA $2.00 ). There are restaurants, but no deals there either...you'll pay 35-50 bucks at Evita's ( a popular place ) for a meal. There is Burger King a few blcks from ROOMS, and theres always the local food too...a tad cheaper.<br>  <br>  Really the only cheap thing about JA is getting there. You won't break the bank, but its a tourist town like anywhere else in the world.|`|zatOdfy0aa	Really not that bad most are the local roadside and not that expensive it you are looking for chain restaurant you will need to go to Kingston,<br>  they have pizza hut and fast food try a "patty" they are really good. have a good time and enjoy the culture it is really different.

AA10042296	Summary of a Sad short story by Gabriel Garcia Marquez is about  a boy who on a boring Sunday wrote to the newspaper to find a girl. After three days, a girl wrote to him and said that she was very bored on Sundays too. Then, the boy and the girl went to coffee and took lemonade and ice cream. During the night, the boys did not speak much and was silent. They were very annoyed so they went to see a very dramatic movie. In the film, they did not speak and the boy fell asleep. After ten minutes, the girl also fell asleep. After reading  of  sad short story, I thought that the girl was very Good for the boy. They have many similarities, for example they are not talkative and also they are bored on Sundays! In my opinion, the reading is not sad but a little comedic the people are very normal and their lives are not interesting. The people speak in the newspaper and go to coffee and movie at night. That night is boring and he is not interesting. In conclusion, the sad short story of Grabriel Garci'a Marquez is very different but also a little tedious and humorous.

With those Latin names, you'll be able to find the English names of the plants, which are the most common in Zurich.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.wsl.ch/dienstleistungen/stadtflora/grafik?hires" rel="nofollow">http://www.wsl.ch/dienstleistungen/stadt...</a>|`|3Wxx2FPkaa	The city is situated where the river Limmat issues from the north-western end of Lake Zürich (Zürichsee), about 30 km north of the Alps. <br>  <br>  Zürich is surrounded by wooded hills including (from the north) the Gubrist, the H?nggerberg, the K?ferberg, the Zürichberg, the Adlisberg and the Oettlisberg on the eastern shore; and the Uetliberg (part of the Albis range) on the western shore. <br>  <br>  The river Sihl meets with the Limmat at the end of Platzspitz, which borders the Swiss National Museum (Landesmuseum). The geographic (and historic) center of the city is the Lindenhof, a small natural hill on the west bank of the Limmat, about 700 meters north of where the river issues from Lake Zürich. Today the incorporated city stretches somewhat beyond the natural hydrographic confines of the hills and includes some neighborhoods to the northeast in the Glattal (valley of the river Glatt).

Just spend lots of time around the city, drinking coffee during the day and beer or wine during the night, visiting galleries and getting lost in the alleys. This is a beautiful city and if you want to see some photos to see what to expect and what to visit check my gallery: www.milarobles.dphoto.com.<br>  Hope you enjoy Melbourne as much I do.<br>  <br>  <br>  The Melbourne Photographer|`|nXPJ6d7eaa	The beginning of spring to the middle is the best, in my opinion. So Sept/Oct. I love Melbourne, especially in the spring. It has been my favourite city for the last 9 years. <br>  <br>  Where you should go would depend on what you're into, but if you want to see the sights and the countryside at all, I would book a trip up the great ocean road. It's a day trip and is absolutely gorgeous. <br>  <br>  If you want to stick to the inner city areas, there are SO many places to see. I would do some internet research first to find activities that will be best for you personally. There are infinite things to do, so I don't really know where to start. There are great areas for shopping, depending on your style, but chapel street, brunswick street, lygon street and bridge road are all options.<br>  <br>  More than anything, talk to the people and I guarantee you will enjoy your stay.|`|NyJeK6NSaa	Melbourne enjoys a temperate climate with warm-hot summers; spring and autumn are balmy and mild, the winters cool. Melbourne is seldom unbearably cold or unbearably hot, temperature extremes when they do occur see the hotter realms of the thermometer causing more problems than the colder.<br>  <br>  Melbourne’s changes of seasons are renown for starting late, the “official” first day of summer is 21st December, but it rarely feels like summer until mid January or even later.

X6rFPI2laa	I'm not sure about whether you can take both, and have doubts about the scooter, but I know people can and do take wheel chairs when they travel by air, and that the people at the airports are very helpful.  The airlines are excellent, too. One thing I urge you to do is to be absolutely sure you have plenty of time to change planes!  I find that they tend to schedule those times too tightly -- at 90 minutes! -- which is fine ONLY if an airplane is not late, not held up at the gate, not -- you get the picture!  And here's my biggest and most important suggestion (beyond ignoring garbage like what you saw in the previous answer!) -- deal with a travel agent!  It will cost you nothing and save you a lot of worry and hassle.  A travel agent can answer your questions, find out about the scooter issue, find out about any documentation you may find helpful to carry with you, arrange for air tickets and ground transportation, notify the airline about the special passenger, etc. A good travel agent is worth his or her weight in gold.  I travel quite a bit and my travel agent always handles things so smoothly my biggest challenge is deciding what to pack for myself, and she always seems to be able to find prices that are better than those that are published.  Have a great trip!

You may visit Mexico for up to 180 days with only a tourist card, but you may not work.  To work legally in Mexico, you must have an FM3 visa with a work permit.  To get a work permit, you must find an employer to hire you and write a letter to immigration stating he cannot find a Mexican for that job.  this means you must have a highly skilledd, rare job skill.  Unemployment is high in Mexico, even among  university educated, English speaking Mexicans  it is simply not realistic to think you could move here and work.  Anyway , wages in Mexico are FAR less than in the UK.  Better to work hard where you are, save up, then come for a great visit.|`|8395f464f951baf847594ae5b8585b9aaa	go for it and let us know how it is working for you
3Wxx2FPkaa	Robert L. Gibbs (born March 29, 1971) is an American political consultant, and the current White House Press Secretary. Gibbs was the communications director for U.S. Senator Barack Obama and Obama's 2008 presidential campaign. Gibbs, who has worked with Obama since 2004, was press secretary of John Kerry's 2004 presidential campaign and has previously specialized in Senate campaigns, having served as communications director for the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee and for four individual Senate campaigns, including those of Obama in 2004 and Fritz Hollings in 1998. Gibbs was also the press secretary of Representative Bob Etheridge.On November 22, 2008, Gibbs was announced as the press secretary of the Obama administration. He assumed the role of press secretary on January 20, 2009, and gave his first official briefing on January 22.|`|94999207fac55776c0f040db3e7d1a50aa	I do not think he is very good.

uYz8ipcJaa	An earthquake itself does not kill you, but rather what comes after.<br>  <br>  A bad earthquake can shake a building enough to make it collapse, or break up roads and highways to cause accidents.  Some years ago an earthquake toppled a lifted highway and turned it sideways.  But most buildings in Japan are put against high standards of stability because earthquakes are very common (we sit on top of 4 land plates!)... about one or two small ones a every couple weeks.  So bad damage is rare.<br>  <br>  A collapsed building will usually kill the people in and around it.<br>  <br>  An earthquake can also cause fires, spreading flames from home furnaces, stovetops, campfires, initiating forest fires, whatever.  The Kanto Great Earthquake was devastating practically because it happened right before lunchtime, when everyone was cooking, and spread a huge fire across the entire city of Tokyo.  Back then there was no such thing as electric stoves...<br>  <br>  An earthquake can simply topple things off the walls and shelves and hit people with it.  People can die from being crushed by vending machines, refrigerators.  That's why in earthquake drills people will duck underneath the tables.<br>  <br>  People themselves can fall, from the top of the stairs of a 5-story flight, the top of a building, a window-washer of a skyscraper, or simply off the curb into the path of traffic.<br>  <br>  Speaking of traffic, if the ground moves, you really can't control your car.<br>  <br>  If you're in an elevator, it'll stall, if not fall (which is rare).<br>  <br>  If you're in a room, the earthquake may deform the building slightly, jamming doors and such.  People get trapped in elevators, closets, whatever, and do not get found.  They'd starve, dehydrate or suffocate.|`|KVlRYoidaa	they forgot to breath.|`|d2f1c9545ed4c110bb4a655ee098e488aa	People usually die in earthquakes when structures around them collapse on them and/or a fire is started by the earthquake and burns people to death. I'd imagine fire would have caused many deaths in the 1200s, because the houses were easy to catch fire.<br>  <br>  People don't just die. Someone in an open field is highly unlikely to die, even if there is a strong earthquake. It is the things around a person that cause earthquake deaths.

aVJyU3Tjaa	Haha! I haven't been to Italy since I was very young but I studied abroad in Nice, France last summer as a British single young woman and I met a lot of Italian guys. Italians have a flirty rather than pervy reputation, in my experience they won't persist if you firmly express that you're not interest. A lot of them will be interested purely because they want to practice their English. But, yes, for sure you will get attention.<br>  <br>  I'm like you, I am generally relaxed but am very short-tempered when it comes to leery behaviour and rip-offs. One funny anecdote, I was out at night, wearing very short shorts, and was with my Italian friend (a girl) and we were walking past the main square and an Italian guy said to his friend as I went past 'Mama Mia, que belle gambe, quandro aprono!" Of course, he thought I wouldn't understand what he said, but my Italian friend obviously did! Apparently it meant roughly 'My, my, what beautiful legs, when open!' Charming! <br>  <br>  Another Italian guy, when meeting me for the first time, instead of greeting me with a customary kiss on each cheek, kissed me full on the mouth! Whereas in the UK I would knee him in the bollocks, somehow I didn't care and very much enjoyed it. But then again, I was with my Italian friend, so I felt secure knowing that she knew these guys. So yes, the Italian guys in my experience are flirty and a bit full on. But harmless.<br>  <br>  My advice to you would be to learn a few stock Italian phrases in order to get rid of hangers-on.<br>  <br>  Also, Pompeii, Florence and Venice tend to be full of tourists, so you won't stick out like a sore thumb.<br>  <br>  Have a great time, travelling alone can be daunting, especially as a single woman, but also the most incredible experience, and I can safely say Italy is probably one of the best places to do it.|`|IcvmE6UCaa	Nowadays Italy and italians are quite different from the stereotypes depicted in those black and white movies directed by Federico Fellini and Vittorio De Sica and dating back to 60-70 years ago.<br>  <br>  Italian men have quitted slapping women's back, whistling and hooting at them long ago. They can still be flirtatious, but they won't insist if you don't care about them.<br>  <br>  Instead, be very, very, very, very careful with non-italian men living (or surviving) in Italy: foreign immigrants who have nothing to lose and come from countries and cultures where there's scant or no respect for women, often pretend to be friendly italians, pretend to help and guide you as you visit a city and suddenly become an actual and very serious threat if you drink too much and can't take care of yourself or if you are (or appear) too confident and follow them in desert places... not to mention their home.<br>  <br>  <br>  If you fear you might find yourself in actual and imminent danger, have a canister of pepper spray ( <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pepper_spray" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pepper_spra...</a> ) ready in your bag, if its helps you to feel safer: it's legal in Italy.|`|30R7gIXtaa	your going to do tourist things so you will be with tourists, not italians<br>  if your walking along the road they will blow their horns at you<br>  you might get pinched but italian men are mummies boys and a cowards so they know what happens if they get caught by boyfriends so they are a lot more controlled<br>  <br>  beware of the Gypsies pickpockets Between the bus STATION and the train STATION in rome<br>  <br>  remember everything shuts on mondays<br>  <br>  email me and we chat where the best places to go in italy<br>  <br>  Almalfie road is special|`|kv5lGrSdaa	You should watch the movie Taken!

Parts of Birmingham like Aston, Handsworth, Small Heath and Bordesley Green are really run down area's with high crime rate's. But then Edgbaston, Harbourne and places like that are quite decent. And the area around Birmingham Uni is nice enough. Also Birmingham's city centre is really good.

tcmaLqWFaa	You have it about right there.  However, a foreigner has no recourse the same as a Filipino.  Even the police and other government workers expect a handout from a foreigner to enforce their own regulations.  Especially the anti-corruption laws.  Isn't that ironic?  I am a well traveled person and I have to tell you, Philippines has the most widespread corruption in its' society I have ever seen.  No other place even comes close.  I used to think Filipinos only cheat foreigners but the more I see the more I realize it's everyday practice.  Many even take great pride in being able to cheat another person and get away with it.

pTLcvsVfaa	Denver, like much of the country, can have extreme weather fluctuations in April. Its not uncommen to  get snowstorms in April, and cold weather. Its also not uncommen to weather in the 80s. <br>  <br>  If you are planning a trip based on the weather being good, its not the surest of bets. You may want to go somewhere like Vegas, Arizona ,California or the Southeast if you want be gurenteed warm sunny weather. <br>  <br>  Denver is 5200 feet above sea level. Which means the weather can be very upredictable.|`|zVGhHomRaa	unpredictable. <br>  <br>  You can have blizzards, heat waves, hail storms, rain storms. <br>  <br>  btw, It's the third snowiest month.|`|818a6c4a96262d3d9669cd5c91b5efaeaa	There is no white water rafting that early in the season or anywhere near Denver...it would be several hours away.  But Denver is a great place with lots to do  You could take one day and drive an hr and a half up to Rocky Mountan National park...it is fantastic.  See sites below for lots of other ideas too.|`|6874b4a9b2e07ebd35f4e979f869b2d4aa	The daytime temperature is around the 70's during the day but can drop to the low 40's at night. Pack appropriately.|`|3Wxx2FPkaa	Temperature<br>  April 62 F or 17 Centrigrade<br>  Denver has a semi-arid climate with four distinct seasons. While Denver is located on the Great Plains, the weather of the city and surrounding area is heavily influenced by the proximity of the Rocky Mountains to the west. The climate, considered a high-desert climate and while generally mild compared to the mountains to the west and the plains further east, can be very unpredictable. Before the city's settlement, the Denver landscape was made up of primarily prairie and desert lands. Because Denver and most of its suburbs sit in a "bowl", the city is often protected from harsh cold and strong winds. Measurable amounts of snow have fallen in the Denver area as late as June and as early as September.<br>  <br>   <br>  Platte River near Commons ParkThe average temperature in Denver is 50.1 °F (10.1 °C), and the average yearly precipitation is 15.81 inches (402 mm). The season's first snowfall generally occurs around October 19, and the last snowfall is about April 27, averaging 54.9 inches (156 cm) of seasonal accumulation. The National Weather Service records an annual average of sunshine during 69 percent of all possible daylight hours.<br>  <br>  Denver's winters can vary from mild to cold, and although large amounts of snow can fall on the mountains just west of the city, the effects of orographic lift dry out the air passing over the Front Range, shielding the city from precipitation for much of the season. Additionally, warm chinook winds occasionally occur as air passing over the mountains heats as it descends, quickly melting snow accumulations and making Denver's winters milder than areas without this effect. The coldest temperature ever recorded in Denver was recorded on January 9, 1875 at -39 °F (-39.5 °C), and the last time Denver recorded a temperature below -20 °F (-29 °C)

While I am in the UK, I use <a href="http://www.bmcoaches.co.uk" rel="nofollow">http://www.bmcoaches.co.uk</a> and their price and packages for hiring a minibus in the UK is just very much ideal for any travelers to the UK.<br>  <br>  Hope this helps.
Xkas9BG2aa	I was in Krakow from May to September 2007 and flew there from America.  I paid in dollars for my plane flight, and I didn't make any prior hotel reservations.  Once you get to Krakow, the Euro is not prevalant.  I used the Polish currency, Zloty, for most of my purchases.<br>  <br>  I wanted to search out on my own for housing when arrived in Krakow.  I went to an apartment rental agency by the Krakow train/bus station.  That was a mistake, so wouldn't recommend for you to look for bargains located by the train/bus station.  Because of course, they may feel you're desperate to find housing, so will charge you more.  I paid for that first month in May $1,000 plus in studio rental fee.  For the rest of my stay, I searched outside the tourist area, and found some student housing which was furnished and cost about half the May rental fee.  <br>  <br>  Not sure if they increase restaurant costs from March to April or for the Summer.  I ate most meals buying from outdoor markets or the supermarket which is cheaper.  If you have a microwave or cooking facilities in your rental, that will save you money.<br>  <br>  Good luck and have nice time in Poland.|`|Q6XYkUUNaa	Like all the world, April encompasses the easter holidays and the law of supply and demand means higher prices are charged.
AA12074269	WA has the strictest Easter trading laws - so while its possible that the nightclubs will be open on Saturday - they may have to close at Midnight instead of 1-2am.<br>  <br>  Western Australia<br>  <br>      * Good Friday – General retail shops required to close.<br>      * Easter Saturday – Trading permitted.<br>      * Easter Sunday – General retail shops do not normally trade.<br>      * Easter Monday – General retail shops required to close (except for Perth and Fremantle tourism precincts).|`|NyJeK6NSaa	Perth has a large selection of pubs and nightclubs to cater for all types of tastes. The main nightclub area in Perth is Northbridge, located just over the railway line from the city centre, and only a few minutes walk from the train  and buses. <br>  <br>  Northbridge is about four blocks long by four blocks wide. In this area you will find about 20 nightclubs, 10 pubs, and over 100 eating establishments. Thursday, Friday, Saturday and Sunday are the busiest days and nights at Northbridge, but there is always a great atmosphere any day of the week.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.planbooktravel.com.au" rel="nofollow">http://www.planbooktravel.com.au</a>

7Y2jmO7Taa	Personally, I would suggest summer. It's too cold in the winter to walk around a lot. And NYC is such a walking City! <br>  <br>  The spring is actually the very best time to be here. <br>  <br>  Trust me. I've lived here for over 30 years!|`|2bca07912249cffd6d15a663fd5ae28caa	split the difference and go in October, after the heat of the summer is gone. personally it's the best time to go to NYC, and the new fall performing arts season is just getting underway...|`|Mnm0jFVfaa	Living here i would say NYC looks best in the winter, but you can't enjoy it the same as in the summer. If you really want to come during the summer ,off the top of my head i'm not sure of anything really big that goes on in the city besides the norm, maybe independence day..fireworks on the east river.|`|RmmO10xSaa	I have only been once and i went in february and it was great , i guess its going to be a whole more expensive christmas and summer time , and i think NY will look amazing any time of the year , if you have the money then id say christmas but if you dont try the low season times.|`|cNaFCm5Taa	Well, it does look beautiful here in December. Though summer has so much more nicer weather for shopping and just walking around to hang out. I would say come in the summer just so you wont freeze your butt off.|`|4OEOxOmPaa	Spring or Summer. Stick to warmer Spring weather. The humidity here in NYC in the Summer is brutal.
vztmFv5iaa	that's a silly question! of course you should go! and you should also take me with you.|`|8LzF0ye8aa	I've never been there, but I've heard it is very nice.  If I had the chance I would go.|`|Bv0dPwCDaa	i live here,,,, too crowded   go to vegas instead|`|bVROvLNSaa	So why are you hesitating?  <br>  <br>  I would go at the drop of a hat, and I don't know you or your aunt!|`|Gq0t3ERIaa	I've gone there twice and have been to 4 islands. It's the most beautiful place in the world, in my opinion.<br>  Your aunt is going to pay for it? Absolutely, go!
HCvF4Bm1aa	You're so lucky to have had that experience... pretty cute too... :) xxxx|`|CInHTKJcaa	where is the picture of you smoking weeds in shivaratri....DON'T TELL ME!!! you missed it, didn't you? i feel really sorry for you....that's like a major occasions...and if you missed it...you missed most of the visit to nepal...|`|9IrdMFX7aa	Thank you for the photos. <br>  <br>  All the best to you.|`|1b40b411fde105efac034d33b5f3fdeeaa	wow, it looks amazing!<br>  I bet you had a great time!|`|qhPQvwzGaa	love them, there great must have been some experience|`|D33VRTz8aa	they are really nice.<br>  <br>  I really like the one where you are amazed at the scenery.|`|bhNaTYjOaa	Not bad, but you could have been more imaginative in such a wonderfully scenic country.|`|0v7Msiznaa	yeah it looks really nice and a really nice place to visit.  hope you had fun there.|`|NG2SbBtcaa	Nepal is beautiful .......gift of nature and the place of my birth..!!!|`|8397dc5c96a83ae1ae69e10bbee9547baa	They are fine. but not the best.|`|Yb24E1KBaa	wow..nepal is so beautiful country..love ol ur pics :)<br>  xx|`|wmBK9uASaa	Yes very good, I like the scenic vies the best but all are good....|`|cf4d6d60fab75efc136a4d66dd5c03b4aa	The beauty of Nepal is sometimes too hard for a pro to capture, your photos described the everyday life of Nepal which a few tourists can enjoy, still I think the views from Nyatapole and other places would be cool.
7fow1Wngaa	U know what HAWAII is a GREAT PLACE TO LIVE IN, OKAY!! If you haven't been here don't say a word!!! Like the mainland or where you live is any better???

Don't be judging what you see and hear unless you see it for yourself|`|r1rXE6Gtaa	It was, now St. Croix USVI is the next Hawaii.  We have some of those things, but traffic is not too bad and the government always has its hand open so not too many homeless.  The refinery and utility company pay well.  Lots of opportunity for starting your own business, too.|`|EnMB5V7eaa	It's not fair to base your statement on what you saw on Oahu. Have you been to other islands? <br>  <br>  I have been to all of them, and have only experienced what you describe in certain areas of Oahu near Honolulu.<br>  <br>  Sorry.|`|HjZcH6dGaa	Sounds like the rest of the US.|`|AA11015885	Sounds like you live on or have just visited one part of one island.  Other than the high cost of living, I have experienced none of this on Maui.  Not to say that what you described does not exist, but it is certainly not the norm.  Happy to live in paradise.|`|Bv0dPwCDaa	sure isnt!!!!!!!!!!
kgBPU4xxaa	Personally, I probably wouldn't do either. First, I prefer the flexibility of individual travel over going in a group. Then, it's often cheaper to buy individual tickets for train travel here than to get a Eurail pass. You do, however, have to do some research and be willing to buy tickets somewhat in advance to get the best deals. With the Eurail pass, you still have to make reservations and/or pay additional supplements for the faster trains here. Only the slower regional trains are truly hop-on, hop-off with the passes. See: <a href="http://www.eurail.com/1_reservations_supplements_international_trains" rel="nofollow">http://www.eurail.com/1_reservations_sup...</a> , <a href="http://www.eurail.com/1_reservations_supplements_international_trains" rel="nofollow">http://www.eurail.com/1_reservations_sup...</a> , <a href="http://www.eurail.com/1_reservations_night_trains" rel="nofollow">http://www.eurail.com/1_reservations_nig...</a> Note: actually, I don't qualify for a Eurail pass since I'm a European resident; I would have to get an InterRail pass which is actually a better deal. I have never done this because it's always turned out to be cheaper to just buy indiviaual tickets for the travel I do. <br>  <br>  The passes can save you money if you do a lot of travel and mostly or entirely use the regional trains. You can determine whether a pass may be of value by laying out a proposed itinerary and comparing the total price of the pass (including all supplements) with the price of individual tickets. There are often discounts on individual tickets on the higher speed trains if you buy them in advance. For example, there's a SMART fare for a berth in a night train from Paris to Rome for 35 euro, but right now the ticket would have to be bought almost a month in advance. The Amica fare here in Italy is available on domestic Intercity, Eurostar, and Alta Velocità trains if you buy a ticket at least a day in advance - it provides a savings of up to 20%. <br>  <br>  There are a couple of good resources for finding flights on budget airlines here: <a href="http://www.whichbudget.com/en/" rel="nofollow">http://www.whichbudget.com/en/</a> , <a href="http://www.skyscanner.net/" rel="nofollow">http://www.skyscanner.net/</a>|`|AA10405438	I would go to Germany.  I went to Garmisch-Partenkirchen by rail and it was the most beautiful and fun trip I have ever taken.  Innsbruck is not far and you will be rewarded many times over.  Bavaria ROCKS!!!|`|8KG6CVvfaa	eurorail
kfM7ppWpaa	Eat BBQ, Go to the Zoo, Visit NASA aka Johnson Space Center, Go to Kemah Boardwalk, Visit the San Jacinto Monument and Museum, Visit the Downtown Aquarium, Battleship Texas, Houston Museum of Natural Science, local Night Clubs and Bars, and maybe a friend! ;-)<br>  <br>  Houston is the largest city in Texas and the 4th Largest City in the U.S.  I trust you will find plenty to do! lol|`|Ev6ruMeNaa	When your in Houston you can go south on I-45 until you get to Galveston Island (where I-45 ends.) Theres alot of great resterants there, and a huge waterpark thats open all year called Slitterbahn youl have a blast there. Moody Gardens is like a zoo/aquarium and many more things together, its great too.Galveston was hit by hurricane Ike but theyve pretty much recovered, these places may be opened back up or may not be. If you want awesome shopping go to the Galleria on Westheimer Rd. its a huge 3 story mega mall with alot of designer stores like Dolce and Gabbana etc., its has a Saks Fifth Avenue, Neiman Marcus, Macys, and Nordstrom. If you want bargains go to Katy Mills Outlet Mall, it has alot of great stores to that people can actually afford in these hard economic times|`|NpqAbZqpaa	I hear they have flights to Toronto in Houston, that's a good thing..|`|fM7CwTwzaa	You picked a good time to go: it's rodeo time in Houston, so you might want to go see some rodeo shows, do some carnival rides along the midway, and catch a concert --- there are big-name country, rock, pop, and latin groups performing every night. Check out the rodeo web site for concert lineups and ticket prices.<br>  <br>  There are lots of things to do around Hermann Park and the Museum District. That's where the zoo is, as well as the science museum, the Houston Museum of Fine Arts, there's a lake where you can rent a paddleboat, there's a golf course and a japanese botanical garden. They also have an outdoor amphitheatre with free concerts, but the shows don't start up for a few weeks yet.<br>  <br>  Johnson Space Center can be fun. The tour is the definitely the best part of it. <br>  <br>  If you're into sports, check out the schedules for the Toyota Center. It's where the Rockets play, as well as minor league hockey and womens basketball. <br>  <br>  Battleship Texas can be pretty fun, and one thing a lot of visitors don't know about is that the city gives free boat tours of the ship channel. It's a fun and inexpensive way to kill a few hours.|`|EzZk2pyNaa	In my opinion, Houston is very boring.
7RbootLlaa	Lyn McGranger she is hot. Well .... no ... not really ... then again ... no. It's just no one responded to you and I thought, "Oh well, what the hell".

yEe3WkFCaa	Athens is filled with traffic.  But there is a lot of things to do.  A weekend might not be a long time, so try to fit in some important things that Athens has to offer.<br>  The Mall of Athens is really big, with a movie theatre, bowling allees, and a lot of restauraunts to choose from.<br>  Agia Paraskeui has a nice plateia, or town sqaure with a lot of restauraunts to choose from.  Goody's, which is a fast food place is really good.  But I would suggest you try some traditional Greek food like gyros, souvlakia, tsatsiki, mousaka, horiatiki salata, pastitsio, etc.<br>  Also go to the Plaka and the Acropolis.  I loved it there.<br>  If you want to go somewhere really fun, try Allou Fun Park in Athens.  It is so much fun.  They have 3 to 4 sections filled with great rides and a huge ferris wheel, that when you get to the top, you can see all of Athens.<br>  Have fun!|`|oyzj1l7Paa	You must visit the Acropolis, the Archeological Museum, the Parliament in Syntagma square, the Byzantine Museum and the Plaka district.<br>  The underground (subway) is very efficient so do not spend money on taxis.

PkyeSN9daa	It's a great project you are trying to do and Liberia desperately needs the help.  Contact your country's embassy in Monrovia and ask them about any help they can provide (they'd love the publicity).  Also check the Liberian embassy in your country and see if they can help.  The easy part may be collecting the supplies.  How are you going to get the supplies there?  Check with airlines that service Monrovia and see about them donating empty/excess cargo space (again for the publicity).  Check with shipping lines that service Monrovia.  It's a great effort you are proposing and I'd be interested in donating.|`|9GUUcYZ0aa	Hi, sorry I am not answering your question. I am a  cameroonian  student and  we  have  the  need  here.

I'd recommend contacting an NGO or a church based group in Liberia. Naturally you want to be sure that your money and supplies are going to a legitimate school!  <br>  <br>  I was in Liberia about three years ago.  There are very few schools (few children can afford to go) and supplies are needed badly.<br>  <br>  Good luck!
QoVL5cDHaa	There is a small amount of parking on the other side of the bridge, going into the town. But that car park isn't very big, and it is probably expensive. The car park you mention is the only one I know of (unless you head out to Hannaford Point) and that is the one we go to. <br>  Unfortunately Looe is constructed in a steep valley, so it's not conducive to car parking. It was built well before cars, so inhabitants wouldn't have realised the implications of building on hills with little access. And I'm sure they wouldn't have anticipated the level of today's holiday trade. Although I love Looe, my husband doesn't like it because of the parking problems.<br>  I only get to Looe at best once a year, so am unaware of the restaurant you mention. We usually eat at a restaurant on the walk into town just the town side of the bridge, on the left, but I can't remember what it is called.<br>  There isn't really much to do if you are staying in Looe once you have walked around the town. It will be too cold to spend much time on the beach. So I suggest you explore the surrounding countryside, and find village pubs in which to eat.|`|05cccXMyaa	I suggest getting in touch with <a href="http://www.bmcoaches.co.uk" rel="nofollow">http://www.bmcoaches.co.uk</a> - they might like to help you

It's a genuine and well respected university that had its foundations many years ago as an Institute of Technology rather than a purely academically based university. These days, its degrees have the same standing as from any other good uni in Australia but they tend to be a well received combination of the practical and the academic: in fact, it advertises itself as the 'University for the Real World'.

You will see the busses and there are several stops you can take it up on.  Make sure you can hear the guide because they tell you this great history information along the way.

How long are you here? How many of you are coming? What budget are we talking?<br>  <br>  As a general rule, go to www.yha.co.uk (youth hostel association). plan your trip around their hostels, they are as good as you can get, you will meet lots of people and they are everywhere (including London, which is VERY expensive otherwise).<br>  London, Haworth-Whitby-York (all in Yorkshire), Bath and Stratford are all nice. Skip Nottinghamshire, go to Hexham and explore Hadrians Wall instead. North Wales has lots of good stuff packed close together (the town of Conway, Betws-y-coed, Caernarfon Castle, Snowdonia, Portmeirion. )<br>  <br>  Check the National Trust website. They do a special membership for visitors and they have nearly all the cool old stuff you seem to like, it will save you a bomb - Fountains Abbey in Yorkshire, Housestead at Hadrians Wall, Stonehenge, Erddig in North Wales, hundreds of stately homes and nice places.<br>  <br>  Drop me an email any time.<br>  Enjoy, Steve.|`|N8DxgAD7aa	Don't worry, you will never forget your trip to England! The dirt of London, the fake Shakespeare stuff in SuA, the faded glory of Bath. Just kidding.<br>  <br>  I have visited England on numerous occasions and I always liked it a lot. My most memorable trip was a unplanned visit to Brixton in London during the riots of the 80s. I will remember it for the rest of my life! <br>  <br>  As a special tip, try to see a lot of small local stuff, not the big tourist traps. ENgland is very big in small local stuff like local fairs, small museums etc.
AA10919524	$600 seems fairly reasonable.  When I've researched and watched tickets to Hawaii, I'll pick dates a month before my trip, two months, etc. and watch prices in the near future to get an idea of when the prices start increasing.  If you do this, make sure you pick the same travel days of the week as you will be flying. <br>  <br>  For example, if you are planning to fly out August 15 (Sat) and return August 21(Fri), I would check prices for July 11-17, June 20-26, May 23-29 somewhere like expedia.  If all those prices are around (or over) $600, then you might as well buy now.  If there is a significant decrease in price at some date, then you may want to wait.  But you always run the risk of prices increasing.<br>  <br>  Keep in mind that if you use expedia or travelocity for your airfare search, you can usually save a little bit of money by booking directly from the cheapest listed airline.<br>  <br>  HTH!|`|dR4NI4KNaa	the closer it gets to that date...the more the ticket will be.|`|17236f2a8f333b3a2a3252e2a5c82aabaa	The problem is living in Des Moines. There are no direct flights to Honolulu so the biggest part of your ticket will be for the commuter flight to a larger city. This journey is going to be in the 12 to 15 hour range depending on the routing. The best price I could find searching today was in the $550 range on United.<br>  <br>  Air fares are changing constantly, sometimes as often as hourly. To find your best value try this. The cheapest fares are for flights mid week (Tues, Wed, Thurs) and purchased at least 30 days in advance. Over night flights (the Red Eyes) are often cheaper too.<br>  <br>  Go to any travel consolidators website (Expedia, Travelosity, Orbitz, etc) and find your best deal. Write it down, but DON'T book it. Then go the the airlines website and price the EXACT flights. They are usually a bit cheaper because it does not include a the travel agents commission. Then price the flights at different times of the day. It is sometimes said that air fares are at their lowest in the early morning hours. <br>  <br>  Congratulations on your wedding, and enjoy your time in Hawaii.  Oh, just curious.

So not knowing which route you are taking..its hard to give recommendations, and if you are really willing to travel off the beaten path ie: a few miles from the interstate into a town to eat real food and not fast food which is all your gonna get really right off interstates. <br>  I'll just tell you places I know are good if you do take the I-10 to I-49 route to go up to shreveport from houston....If ya'll head out of houston on I-10, in Scott LA there is a place called Fezzo's. They mainly serve seafood, but are known for their steaks and they have good poboys too....really just a very good place, and actually right over the over pass in Scott on the left is a small hole in the wall place that sells the best boudin you'll ever eat. In Natchitoches LA, only one exit off I-49 for this town, you go right, and about 2 miles and there is a mexican restuarant set back on the left called Nicki's. They are my favorite mexican place and are really good! <br>  Sorry i cant think of any BBQ places that are good....they are far and few between in LA really.|`|mcmOslOFaa	Your going to drive right through my town!!

(artistic, fashionista, laid back, etc?) and how much budget do you have? <br>  <br>  Generally, I would not recommend zone 1, unless have really BIG budget (and afford to live in Mayfair, Regents Park, Marylebone... because otherwise, you just end up living above shops and hearing people shouting because they have too much too drinks every weekend. <br>  <br>  Avoid dodgy area in the East London, or North East.  <br>  Many young people prefer Angel & City area (Islington, but don’t go to Holloway), or Swiss Cottage, and Primrose Hill flat is not bad at all for North<br>  Pimlico, Victoria, or South Bank is cool<br>  Further down, you can go to Fulham (but District Line is sucks), and Greenwich is interesting, it’s a bit further, but the transport is good and you get a better quality of living for a cheaper rate. <br>  <br>  Do the EXTENSIVE RESEARCH on your area further before you move in, living in London could be the best or the worst experience ever.

We don't salute the flag and we never say God Bless England - blimey, cannot think of anything worse.<br>  <br>  You must think of yourself in the role of a Cockney Londoner.

One of the most difficult things to do is the 'full glottle stop' used by all us Londoners.<br>  <br>  For example, the word BOTTLE is pronounced without sounding the 'Ts' - almost impossible to explain really - bohhle - is about the closest I can explain it - somewhere in the back of the throat.

A chav is a low person, something like the people who live in trailer parks in the US - trailer trash etc.<br>  <br>  See, you've got one new word already.

The American Dream is a myth, a person from a working class background in Britain has as much chance to reach the top as an American  working class person.  It may have been true in the past, but the class system doesn't exist in Britain as it used to.  So in Britain you have as much chance of making it, and you have less chance of falling into abject poverty.  The American Dream was an idea that existed when there were lots of independent companies, these days the globalisation of huge brands (started in America) have stifled the ability to succesfully set up your own business -  you can still rise from the bottom - but it's a lot harder now than it used to be.<br>  <br>  PPS.

Probably not ? <br>  <br>  Toronto is the largest city in Canada, and it will be a eye opening experience for you. Come with a open mind and bring a camera. Take lots of photos, and TALK to Torontonians, and learn about my city. We are friendly and if you ask sensible questions, you will get lots of knowledge, both about the city and Canada, as a nation. <br>  <br>  You didn't say where you are staying, so here a few  of the standard  tourist things to see and do in Toronto.<br>  <br>  Walk down Yonge Street, the main street in the city, any where south of Bloor, down to Queen , and then west to City Hall, and into the Eaton Center ( 440 stores, 5 level mall ), take a ride on a TTC streetcar, see the CN tower ( 1815 feet tall ) and look at the faces that pass you on the street. I like to say that Toronto is where the world has come to live.<br>  <br>   We speak 125 different languages here, and if you look at the stores and business locations, you will see many other languages on the signs.<br>  <br>  After you get back to Missouri, tell us how your trip to Toronto was ?<br>  <br>  Jim b. Toronto.|`|o6HB29o8aa	the cn tower is great, theres a restaurant, shops, its really cool. theres the toronto zoo, The ROM is awesome if your a history or art junkie.

JcZIjpU4aa	You can probably get a job here as a teacher. I'm not sure what exactly you are wanting to teach though. I would advice that you start sending out your resume to high schools or whatever options you have in mind.<br>  Like i said, im not sure what you want to teach or where you want to teach. But i know private high school teachers here make good money, plus they will arrange everything for you (working perming, health insurance, apartment, etc). <br>  Heres a small list of the biggest and most fancy private schools, you can google them to get their websites:<br>  <br>  British School of Costa Rica<br>  Lincoln School<br>  Blue Valley <br>  Country Day School<br>  Humboldt School (This is mainly German, but they teach some courses in english too)<br>  Marian Baker<br>  Pan American School<br>  <br>  Hope this info helps :)

Visit Howth (take a walk around the head). <br>  Christchurch Cathedral.<br>  Try Dublin Coddle, its a soupy stew. Originally made from what was left in the cupboard when the pay ran out, it has potatoes, sausages, bacon- & other things that tend to vary.  <br>  Try a "fry" a full irish breakfast.  Visit the Auld Dubliner (say Eric sent you!) in Temple Bar and have a Guinness.<br>  Unfortunately the Natural history museum is closed for renovation and the waxwork museum has shut down.|`|mutPrG8faa	Go to the Book of Kells and Trinity College.<br>  Then go to Dublin Castle. <br>  Plan on walking everywhere because traffic is crazy.<br>  You will find good food...<br>  as long as you fork out the money for it (it's expensive there)<br>  <br>  Good luck!

c0b3df9e6b5632ff0bda2a96cf938465aa	Nice one, but: No restaurant can guarantee that the meal is gluten-free. Near Kurfürstendamm, you'll find some restaurants that serve "Eisbein mit Sauerkraut", and don't tell me that pork and cabbage contain any wheat or corn remains. If you eat rye bread with it, then that's your problem. Choose fried potatos instead.|`|zEoRcL91aa	Are you allergic? There may be some special restaurants, but it is best to ask beforehand.

1Mc6BOvKaa	I'll add to the other answer here.<br>  <br>  Constituencies are political units - your local MP is the MP for your constituency. A Constituency can be a small part of a city, a single town, a collection of towns, or even a huge swathe of a country. Their size is determined by the number of people living there. I think they aim to have around 75,000 people living in each constituency, so naturally big cities will have several constituencies, while small towns may only make up half of one.<br>  <br>  Counties are internal divisions. Most have a county council which is a senior form of local Government. It is comparable to US states, but counties aren't nearly as independent, and only have powers delegated to them from London.<br>  There are some counties that don't really exist as counties any more, but remain as "postal counties" i.e: something you can add to an address to clarify it. For example, South Yorkshire no longer has any form of Government or authority, instead it is broken down into four "Metropolitan Boroughs" (Doncaster, Sheffield, Barnsley and Rotherham) which are similar to counties, but smaller and based around a single large town. The idea behind this is that there are more people in just one of those towns, than many other counties have at all, so they have tried to make local government more representative and "local". Middlesex is also similar - it was absorbed into Greater London some time ago, but is still used in postal addresses.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  Cities are usually distinct from towns by having a Cathedral or a University, or other form of Royal Charter. This is usually a fairly flexible term. <br>  Villages are historically distinct from towns in that they don't have a regular agricultural market, a town hall, or a mayor. It will have a church. A village without a church is called a hamlet.<br>  This has little legal meaning, more tradition, so its very blurred and not very relevant.|`|vp8806Eraa	A constituency is a political term used to define the area represented by a member of Parliament. This may include a city, or parts of a city, or a town and the surrounding area. For example, Tony Blair's constituency was the town and surrounding area of Sedgefield. There are about 650 in the UK.<br>  <br>  A county is like an american state - nottinghamshire, yorkshire, kent, essex are all counties. They may have lots of cities, and definitely lots of towns and villages (and constituencies!) in them. There are 82 counties in the UK.<br>  <br>  Bath, Bristol, Plymouth, London, Nottingham, Birmingham, are all UK cities. A city in the UK is usually (but not always) defined by the presence of a university or cathedral.<br>  <br>  Towns are like smaller cities<br>  <br>  Villages are like very small towns<br>  <br>  Hamlets are like very small villages

Some of these elements have been determined in judicial or administrative decisions to involve moral turpitude. A conviction for a statutory offense will involve moral turpitude if one or more of the elements of that offense have been determined to involve moral turpitude.

KIX3Hfakaa	Hello.<br>   I have looked at your website and i have a few ideas that might help you.<br>  -first of all, i think people would be more attracted to visiting your place if they knew a little bit about you. I assume you are one of the people giving lessons. Maybe on the homepage, you can introduce yourself and the other people working with you. Tell them about your surfing experience, history and goals of this camp for example. They will want to be comfortable staying at a place and learning to surf form a stranger. You need to show that your a good guy and a good surfer, and will offer fun, safe, and friendly service. Most people will probably be visiting Costa Rica for the first time, so they will want to be sure this is the place for them, and not some random shack run by some weirdo. How do they know that this isnt some big scam? I would include personal pictures of your team in action too.<br>  -second, i think your prices are too expensive. Or maybe theres a better way to display them so that it wont seem as expensive. For example, maybe you can make it per person, per day instead. Also, list what exactly this will include. People like that.<br>  <br>  well thats all i can think of at the moment.<br>  good luck on this venture!<br>  pura vida:)

B3FBgxjEaa	The civil war in the small East African nation of Uganda has now caused thecountry more than twenty years of unrest and turmoil. Its origins are political, withvarious confrontational factions claiming they are oppressed by the current government,headed by President Yoweri Museveni. However, the war has spawned social and economic problems as well; some groups have been targeted more heavily than others,and the two decades of unrest have left the country’s economy in shambles. The twoprimary groups opposing the Government of Uganda (GOU) are the Allied DemocraticForces (ADF) and the Lord’s Resistance Army (LRA), the latter of which has been moreactive in recent years. What separates this civil war from others is the lack of resourceson the sides of both the government and the rebels, and the government’s failed militaryinvolvement and use of protection camps in the crisis. Perhaps, however, the most brutaland divisive attribute to this war apart from others is the unrelenting and murderous useof child soldiers.The Ugandan civil war began in the early to mid-1980s; however, it did not trulyintensify until the mid-1990s. This first portion of the war left hundreds dead and nearlyhalf a million homeless from rebellions against the government. (“Uganda Civil War.”)Multiple bombings occurred in 1998 and 1999, and eight foreigners were killed in theBwindi National Forest. (“Uganda Civil War.”) Brutal attacks on villages, schools, and government-established internally displaced persons (IDP) camps continued in to the newmillennium. All the while, the Lord’s Resistance Army and its leader Joseph Kony beganrecruiting children to fight their battles, creating a generation not only torn apart by war,by fighting it themselves, more often than not, against their will. (“Uganda Civil War.”)After several failed military strategies, the government looked in the direction ofdiplomacy. In 2003, the Lord’s Resistance Army declared a cease-fire and wanted to talk with the government. The group said that it would stop all “ambushes, abductions, and attacks;” (“Uganda Civil War.”) unfortunately, these terms were unfulfilled, and itcontinued to bring violence and chaos to the regions of Gulu, Pader, and Kitgum. In afinal military attempt, Sudan allowed Ugandan forces to enter and flush out and LRApresence hiding in the neighboring country. President Museveni desperately wanted totalk to LRA leaders and even suggested the talks be mediated by religious leaders.However, the terror continued. By 2003, the United Nations had named the Uganda crisis“among the worst on the planet,” (“Uganda Civil War.”) and increased influence fromboth the UN and UNICEF helped to quell the violence. Nevertheless, the rebel group continued its attacks focusing on burning, looting, and abducting from IDP camps, likethe Pagak in May of 2004. Its main target was the Acholi people of Northern Uganda, ofwhom one million then lived in camps. In 2005, the International Criminal Court called for Joseph Kony’s arrest for war crimes and crimes against humanity; therefore, he wasnot present at the July 2006 peace talks. (“Uganda Civil War.”) A peace deal was almostreached in October 2006, but the ICC charges pushed both sides to a standstill. The LRAattempted to come across as freedom fighters, but their alienation and brutality made thisnearly impossible. Though international intervention and the increased presence of bothUnited Nations bodies and charity/ aid-oriented non-governmental organizations (NGOs)have helped bring some stability to the country since 2005, warrants for the arrests ofLRA leaders remain outstanding and the conflict is far from fully resolved. (“Uganda Civil War.”)As the civil war progressed and the rebel groups grew increasingly moredesperate, they began to recruit children to fight on the frontlines, targeting them becausethey are more vulnerable and malleable. This has become perhaps the biggest atrocity and tragedy of the twenty year conflict. The children are often kidnapped from their homes atnight and taken to “training camps” at secret locations in surrounding jungles. Here, thechildren are trained to fight, torture, and kill, often being brainwashed and torturedthemselves. The boys are predominantly trained to be soldiers and physical laborers, and the girls are forced to be sex slaves. The children are even forced to kill their peers whoretaliate or try to escape.

99ea9ef1d3ccadf76a367bfdcafd8593aa	Ethel had some very good suggestions and I will add to them. Cape Lookout SP, Nehalem Bay SP & Ft Stevens SP on the north coast are all awesome! If you search for Oregon State Parks you can read descriptions about all the state parks on the coast. Ft Stevens is in Warrenton(by Astoria) and has a ton of Lewis & Clark activities and is just across the bridge from Cape Disappointment Lighthouse in WA.You can even rent the lighthouse at North Head if you wish.(good luck) Nehalem Bay is near Manzanita, Or and is very nice also. Cape Lookout is south of Tillamook, Or. All of these are very nice and worth considering. I might also suggest you search recreation.gov or reserve america for federal sites in the area. Many USFS campgrounds are very nice but the state parks are in my opinion the best choice.|`|wiAVa1H5aa	Beverly Beach is very nice, as is Nehalem Bay, South Beach....   Well there are many.   What is really nice, if there are openings, is that you can reserve yurts too, but those are just State Parks.   The Forest Service operates a few campgrounds too, like Tillicum.  The links below are for State Parks, articles on coast campgrounds, Siuslaw National forest and the Sunset magazine article on camping on the coast.<br>  <br>  Since that's where you are heading, to stay warm you always need sweaters and windbreaks are always advisable on the beach - even in July with 100F+ in most of Oregon, on the beach it self it is always cool and rarely does the wind stop blowing.   Bring kites if you have them.   Of course, away from the beach it's self, even 1/2 mile in it can get pretty hot too, just depends if you are sheltered from the wind.<br>  <br>  Have fun!|`|IDjP94NHaa	check out the inn at kape kiwanda camp grounds. its across the street from the beach. and the beach is EXCELLENT!

AtjlmByAaa	Hi, if you send it through USPS, you can request USPS to verify for the address, but depending on what part of the address is mislaid.  As far as I can recall, the courier has the list of zip/area codes of the cities of the countries. However, there may be exemptions, if this is in a province or remote area and which is uncommon, they may have difficulty to do so and reject your request.  They might just highlight your failure, on the other hand, you can complain with them, they should have checked if the consignee's address is complete, airwaybill or tracking invoice must have filled up completely before accepting the goods.  But befriends with them though, it may work to grant your request...., if not, then do the complain...good luck
AtjlmByAaa	Hi, yes you may do it so, you can just re-write the consignee's address(receiver) or use a liquid eraser and over write it as long a it is clear, complete and readable.  However, the fact that the packaged had reached the country of destination, and wasn't delivered due to wrong address,  this would have to be charged again when you re-send it, so it is very important to declare correct and complete address with zip code and the contact details of the recipient.  Unless you can negotiate with the USPS, they may give you a discount, but I'm afraid they may not coz its a policy.

SIQNnfnnaa	there aren't very many hotels near Bournemouth airport, however taxis are going to be a necessity if you don't have a car. <br>  There are plenty of hotels in Bournemouth town but these are around 20minutes from the airport (there is an aiport bus...<a href="http://www.bournemouthairport.com/bohweb.nsf/Content/Bus)" rel="nofollow">http://www.bournemouthairport.com/bohweb...</a><br>   There is one approx. 10 minutes from the hotel called 'The Bridge house' it is on quite a main road so it will be easy to find and it's not far from the airport. <br>  There is a hotel in a town called wimborne called the Kings Head- this is set in the pretty town of Wimborne Minster which has a couple of good restaurants for the evening. However the Kings head is often used by locals as a pub. This is about 15 minutes from the aiport. <br>  There is also a travel lodge not far from the airport. If you go to <a href="http://www.travelodge.co.uk/explore_the_uk/?tab=map_find" rel="nofollow">http://www.travelodge.co.uk/explore_the_...</a>  and type into the search bar - Ringwood, it brings up a travel lodge about 10 minutes from the airport. (By the way it's actually in St.Leonards, not Ringwood, however this travel lodge isn't really near any shops. Theres a Little chef and thats all in the shape of food places) <br>  To be honest, any hotel you book in Bournemouth town (make sure its the town not a suburb) is going to be about 15/20 minutes away. I suggest you go no further than Poole, or Ringwood or Wimborne (thats a rough circular area around the airport) and althought the airport comes under Christchurch- DO NOT STAY IN CHRISTCHURCH- this is actually a town about 30+ minutes from the actaul airport.|`|cpkm53Nkaa	I'm sorry I do not know Bournemouth, But every time I go away to Birmingham, Newcastle or London I Always stay in the Travel Inn or The Premier Inn Hotels.

pTLcvsVfaa	Well this is tough one, because best hotels and best hotels for younger people dont always go hand in hand.<br>  <br>  The best hotel on the Vegas strip in the Bellagio, or the Wynn. But the average age in those place is probably mid 30s to mid 40s. You may find some people in there 20s, but probably not early 20s. So if thats important to you, you might not want to stay there.<br>  <br>  Some suggestions<br>  <br>  Mandalay Bay- Great hotel full of people of all ages, but a little far down the strip.<br>  <br>  Caesers palace- Some younger people, and the location is perfect.<br>  <br>  Hard Rock/Palms- Both are off strip, but close. Average age is very young, and have an MTV feel. Not my style, but you may like it.<br>  <br>  If you are looking for something more affordable and in a great location, check out either Harrahs, or the Flamingo.|`|s7seaaPkaa	if you want something nice but around your age style i wouls say <br>  -THE hotel its part of the Mandalay Bay but those both are classy and have pretty hoppin<br>  -Planet Hollywood<br>  -Palms is very hoppin all the time but its just like 1 mile off the strip if even that.|`|OsWyGBAUaa	College graduation? <br>  If you are in your early 20's I would suggest the Planet Hollywood.  It is centrally located, therefore it is within walking distance to either end of the strip.  It is not expensive and not cheap, more middle of the road, yet still very clean and nice.  Has a GREAT nightclub, Prive.  And my favorite part is that it is geared toward the 21 - 35 crowd, in my opinion.  Blondie's is a restaurant/bar located in the mall and they have a $10 all you can drink happy hour, with beer pong!  Only drawback in my eyes is the swimming pool.  It is not terrible but definitely not one of the most "hoppin" pools around.<br>  <br>  If $$$ is not a concern to your parents, go with the Bellagio, it is extremely nice.  However most of the people there will probably be out of your age range.|`|46c684d6c50c9441ad0fd2f732f591baaa	i stayed at the MGM Signature and its rather affordable (depending on when you go) and they are amazing beautiful rooms.

One male cousin is a Captain for MH, my brother-in-law is an Aircraft Engineer with Emirates and my ex-husband is also an Aircraft Engineer with BA. <br>  <br>  I always pay attention to the pre-flight safety procedures too as my cousins hated passengers who did not give a flying toss (pardon the pun) to the demonstrations - yes you, you know who you are cause the girls and boys of the skies have their eye on you. But in all fairness, some cabin crew do look down on you like you are not fit to be served or smiled at. Maybe that is why some passengers bring their own food on-board for fear of incurring the wrath of cabin crew should they are 'dinged' for a drink or snack when everyone's asleep.

Not everyone wears dirndls and lederhosen. <br>  In the north (Schlewig-Holstein) the culture is influenced by scandinavia - houses are often thatched and people tend to be blonde and tall.North east - Berlin,Brandenburg, Mecklenburg-Vorpommern is rural and quiet out of the city, lakes.Berlin is multi-culti - Turks, expast from all over.<br>  <br>  The three saxonys - Saxony, Niedersachsen and Sachsen-Anhalt, Thuringia are definitely the wombs of middle-German culture. Leipzig, Weimar, Eisenach all paid host to the greatest musicians in the world. Marin Luther spent a lot of time in these areas and was responsible for the way the language is today because he translated the bible from Latin to German.<br>  <br>  Banking capital is Frankfurt am Main - in Hessen.Bavaria, Baden-Württenburg are south, and the culture is influenced by being close to the Alps, by Austria and by France.Saarland is the smallest region and has a strong French influence.<br>  <br>  Then there are the Rheinland regions, where Catholicism is strong - so you get Karnival in Feb and those regions are also the most industrilised. Phew. I can't think of anything more now. German culture is diverse, interesting and one can learn something new every day.|`|c0b3df9e6b5632ff0bda2a96cf938465aa	What would you like to hear?

d645e3c1f0da82127be8455d37dddb8faa	You pay for the room not how many people are staying - I would budget for about 1500 - 2000 baht per night for a good air-conditioned room with en-suite bathroom, fridge, tv and fully serviced. The longer you stay the better discount you can negotiate - its normal for Thais to barter and they will find it strange if you do not try and cut a deal - even if you have to accept one free night every 10. If you over budget - dont worry - I'm sure you can find something to spend your money on.

Have a great trip.|`|YPHaQ1asaa	Your pay from 1,500 baht and up depending on what your looking for.  You have asked many questions here.

The problem with time sensitive deliveries is not the carrier, but rather the merchant.

To make it less stressful on yourself, it's advisable to read up on the country itself, get familiar with the custom, the lifestyle, places to go, things to do, etc.  Learn a little Chinese, bring stuff that you will need while there but not easily found there.

GEUU9q2Paa	All of Hawaii is expensive, so maybe with your "very limited amount of money" you might want to put off a trip until you can better aford it, or until your child is older and could enjoy it more.  But if you can swing it now, here are some ideas.<br>  <br>  Oahu (Honolulu, Waikiki) is the least expensive Hawaiian island, but it is very crowded.  Maui is my favorite of the islands, because it is less crowded than Oahu but still has a lot to see and do.  One way to be on Maui without spending as much money as it would normally cost, is to stay in one of the less expensive condos, rather than in a hotel.  Not only will your room cost less, but you will be able to eat most of your meals in the condo, instead of having to pay for restaurants as you would if you were in a hotel.<br>  <br>  This website has reviews of Maui condos and hotels in all price ranges, including photos of the rooms, pools, buildings, and beaches:  <br>  <a href="http://www.mauihawaii.org" rel="nofollow">http://www.mauihawaii.org</a>|`|LCAzlHhEaa	My husband and I went to Hawaii Feb 2008.  It was AMAZING!! We can't wait to go back!!  We stayed at Wyndham Waikiki Beach Walk.  It's only a block back from Waikiki Beach and it's a timeshare hotel so the rooms are not like regular hotel rooms.  We had a fully equipped kitchen, and washer and dryer.  We rented a car and asked at the front desk where the best place to get grocery items was.  They directed us to the local Safeway; and we got enough supplies to last the eight days we were there.  I made breakfast every morning, and we tried to eat only one meal out.  The Shorebird Cafe (i think) in the Outrigger on the Reef Hotel has great food, and prices are reasonable and you can find buy one get one 1/2 off coupons in the coupon books all over the place.  One day I got a hamburger there for lunch & it was so large I had to take over half back to our room to eat later.<br>  <br>  A great website for helping plan your trip is www.gohawaii.com; I used it quite a bit while planning our vacation to Hawaii.  <br>  <br>  A good place to do souvenir shopping is the International Marketplace.|`|QQbSIrBxaa	I just went a few years ago and found a lot of good tips and information at tripadvisor.com.  They have forums where you can ask questions and reviews of a lot of hotels and places to go.  I used that website to basically plan the whole trip.  Hope you have fun, Hawaii is amazing!|`|b09e9343fa5d299e63d3481cc02af9c9aa	Totally agree with tripadvisor.com suggestion.<br>  <br>  Also...don't get hooked in paying higher prices for Hawaiian trinkets...you can literally get the same items at ABC Stores or WALMART!!!  That's our first stop now to see what they have and then if we don't see it out in the stores...we would get it.  It's unreal what you can save by shopping smarter.  Good luck!|`|MmgNDqOQaa	the good place is oahu its the best beaches i live near the beaches especially the beach called waimea bay
DHczAdHIaa	If you are in the UK, you really do need to check with your airline, as it is still a little complicated and inconsistent.<br>  On the 7th January, '08, the "one bag rule" was lifted at certain airports but some airlines choose to still implement the rule.  With most airlines flying from a variety of UK airports, it becomes difficult for them to have different rules for different airports.   They will change when the majority of airports are following the same guidelines. <br>  Thomsonfly and Easyjet, for example, still use the "one bag rule", whereas with British Airways you can carry one piece of hand luggage PLUS a handbag, lap top or briefcase.<br>  Before flying you should update the hand baggage information on the web site of the airline you are flying with.   If the "one bag rule" is still being operated, put your handbag into your hand luggage until you have passed through both check in and security.|`|eulMjLtPaa	Most airlines allow one carry on and one "personal item," which can be a handbag/purse/laptop bag.  So you're good to go.|`|HziXc5Ovaa	Yes you can. A handbag is not considered a carry-on. I usually like to carry something small enough to put in my carry-on so I don't have both hands occupied. But, yes, you can take your handbag along with your carry-on.|`|wNZ95AK3aa	yes you can have a carry on bag once its is a cabin size bag and weights no more then 10kg.you will porb have to fit your handbag into the cabin bag while going threw security as it is 1 bag per person|`|DfJ1fHEBaa	you can only take one piece of handluggage, so just ditch the handbag or do what the previous person said and put the handbag in the small caabin suitcase. or by a handbag in the airport|`|AA11145340	yes just put your handbag in it then take it out when your on the plane
bab98853150b199df79ea228be16f757aa	Think of the general climate where you will be going, and the 'bare minimum' clothes you'll need.  Will there be any stores handy, or will you need to rely on what you bring ... and may want to give as 'gifts' or trade.  Get a good 'safari vest/coat' with lots of pockets, but you should wear this when you leave, not pack it.  Keep every piece of 'legal paper' (money, passport and visa, travel documents, etc) in that and get used to wearing it before you leave home.  Pack only enough for 8 days (you'll be doing laundry once a week, and you'll need to 'change' while doing it) and be sure that you take only things that can be 'rolled up tightly' and look good when unrolled.  1 kg = .6 pounds, so your 20 kg will be equal to 12 pounds, total.  Weigh everything (including the baggage) together, and try for less weight ... and you'll find ways to 'use less' ... don't take things like shampoo and conditioner or anything 'wet' at all, get the lightest in weight fabric ... and 'cut corners' ... wear only clothes that will keep you warm or cool, and can be worn at all times.  Read about Mongolia and about how they live ... you should be fine with two or three shirts, and two pairs of slacks, a pair of shorts (bermudas) and you should be 'good to go' ...|`|Il0QA1Hcaa	Get the bags that shrink down the clothing. You can get them that use the vacuum or you can squeeze the air out. A large bag can fit 3-4 outfits in one bag and shrinks it down to nothing. We used 4 bags to fit on a carry on. 3 outfits in one bag, shoes and accessories in another, and all bathroom in the 3rd bag. Just buy extra bags to pack for your trip home, they do have a tendency to tear when they are opened. Buy a 2 large set to see exactly how much you can get in one bag and then go from there. They usually run around 20 us.|`|HnShyKZjaa	uh, previous poster is way off on kilo to pounds conversion.  A single kilogram is just under 2 and 1/4 pounds - 35.27 oz.<br>  20 kilos is about 44lbs. If you don't have to pack food & water you will find this to be plenty.<br>  <br>  If I was going backpacking with a 44 pound pack and not taking food, I would take a tent, sleeping bag, pad and about 4 changes of clothes (twice that many socks).  If you have arranged for indoor sleeping the tent may not be necessary.  I'm pretty fond of my sleeping bag even if I'm staying indoors (2.5 lbs).  I would take some collapsible water containers anyway, maybe a filter.<br>  <br>  I like "performance fishing gear"  there are several brands that bear this claim.  This type of clothing is light weight and drys very fast.  But you may want to buy local clothes when you get there, just so that you look less weird.<br>  <br>  You can learn to do your laundry in a large baggie, one piece at a time.  The big baggies will help you pack it tighter too; roll it up, stick in in, press the air out, and seal it.|`|RmmO10xSaa	no sorry but idl love to go to mongolia

MVVQrEasaa	The summer temps in this area are usually highs in the 70's or low 80's, lows in the 60's.<br>  <br>  So that means that most mornings and evenings are still cool. Yes, there is usually a 7-10 day stretch sometime between June and September when the temps may get into the 90's, but it's not all summer, and not always every year.  We never really got a long stretch of hot weather last summer.<br>  <br>  So you can go sunbathing there.  The winds in the summer tend to be lighter than in the winter.

AA11948690	Try Lakeview/Wrigleyville, Edgewater, Andersonville. You should be able to find something in that price range, closer to $800, in those area. All three are pretty nice,. Lakeview is a bit more congested but sometimes it's "where all the action is happening". Edgewater and Andersonville are close to each other and are a bit quieter but still have LOTS to do, with many, MANY people in your age range. Andersonville has a substantial gay population but it's also has a strong Scandinavian heritage that still exists to this day. Indeed, one of the most popular bars on the street has a giant neon herring as it's outdoor sign. And they have an annual Midsommar Festival.<br>  <br>  All three areas are close to the lake (either a walk or a short bus ride) and all three have abundant public transportation options. Edgewater (where I live) is just steps from the lake and is slowly gaining in popularity. New condos are popping up all over the place, new restaurants are moving in, there are a couple of small theater companies. It's a very diverse area.<br>  <br>  As far as safety, all three areas are pretty safe, but no area in Chicago is totally safe. It's a big city after all. You just have to watch yourself and you'll be fine.<br>  <br>  Below are links to websites about all three areas (Ignore the photo on the Lakeview site. It's actually a photo of Wicker Park which is no where near Lakeview).
lzEuuseJaa	You might look at Glendale and Burbank. If you can't find anything in the right price range, take a look at North Hollywood, but some of the schools are not very good and some of the neighborhoods are depressing. The Valley Glen area of Van Nuys has some nice residential neighborhoods and some OK schools. South Pasadena and La Canada are more expensive, excellent schools. You probably don't want to live in Hollywood because it's expensive all things considered and the schools aren't too good.<br>  <br>  Depending on how much you can spend, it might take some time to find a rental with 3 bedrooms.

Lucky for you, Hollywood & Highland has a Red Line Metro stop. You can commute in by light rail while at the same time ensure a safer living and educational environment for your kids.<br>  <br>  I live in the San Gabriel Valley, and we have decent housing prices, good school districts and some access to the Metro and Metrolink. Bear in mind, however, that rent for your family will be upwards of $1700-2100 per month. That is reasonable and expectable in So Cal. Within the SGV, I'm quite partial to Pasadena, Alhambra, Monterey Park, San Gabriel and Rosemead. I'd also say San Marino and Arcadia, but those places are terribly expensive, and Arcadia is getting kind of far from Hollywood.<br>  <br>  If that doesn't seem like the right place for you, there are some good neighborhoods in Long Beach and Whittier. I'm not a big fan of going West. It's fun and exciting, but the traffic is hideous and the housing is expensive.|`|ac7e0f50f58632b431b5cf5de0564ffbaa	We see this every day in this forum: Everyone wants to move here, and is looking for “cheap/affordable and safe". However, such a place just doesn’t exist; the two terms are mutually exclusive. It's all about supply and demand: If it's in SoCal, then it's not going to be cheap to begin with. If it's a safe area, then it's more expensive. If you need good schools, add a couple hundred bucks a month on top of it.<br>  <br>  If you want to live here and enjoy the weather, then you have to pay for it. You put up with the smog and the traffic, enjoy the weather and pay your rent or mortgage. My advice is to start checking out craigslist, rent.com, and apartments.com if you are looking to rent. You’ll quickly see that the minimum rent for a non-war zone is about $1,000-$1,200 per month for a studio or 1BR. Really nice areas (like the West LA area) easily run $3,000 or more. Want to live near the beach? Expect to pay a premium. A 3BR house, if available, will probably run at least $3000 per month in a decent area.<br>  <br>  "LA" is such a big place, there are so many neighborhoods/cities where you can live. Of course, even within a city or neighborhood, there are safer sections and less-safe sections.<br>  In Los Angeles, some nice sections are West LA, Brentwood, Westwood, Bel Air, Marina Del Rey, Playa Del Rey, Los Feliz, Silverlake, Eagle Rock, Encino, Tarzana, Studio City, Toluca Lake, Granada Hills, Woodland Hills, Sherman Oaks, West Hills, Chatsworth. Beverly Hills and West Hollywood are surrounded by LA, but are incorporated cities with their own police, FD, etc.<br>  <br>  <br>  To the east: Glendale, Burbank, South Pasadena, parts of Pasadena, Altadena, Arcadia.|`|3K1QW7Oeaa	Just you know, California and cheap do not mix.

It doesn't rain or snow very often. The mountains to the west shield it from most storms. When it does snow it is usually light, and melts off by the afternoon hours. The summers are a different story. It can get VERY hot there.

Riu is probably the best party resort to stay at.....why?  because its all-inclusive, its close to the party beach and because its close to downtown where all the nightclubs are. <br>  <br>  Although we have many great resorts, they are all missing one factor of what I mentioned above.  The Riu Palace or Sante Fe rock!|`|ydoIYwGTaa	I would recommend any hotel on Medano beach. It is were everything happens. All the bars on the beach are there. Really close to the nightclubs (hit Gigglin Marlin, Cabo Wabo and Zoo). If you go any time in March or early April is pretty much all single people. Any resort west of Cascadas De Baja will be exactly what your looking for. Cascadas is for families. Have fun... stay safe!<br>  <br>  Eric, I would look into Hotel ME by Melia Hotels. If you like RIU you are going to love ME. Plus, it is right on the beach. Also, if your looking for singles make sure you hit the booze cruise. It is worth it.|`|AdIU6azjaa	Well, I this will be my 3rd year going for spring break!  I absolutely love it!  Its a great atmosphere for partying!  I would recommendd you stay at one of the RIU resorts!  They are the largest on the bay!  I stayed at the Palace, its the largest and the nicest of the 3 RIU's, but also just a little more expensive than the others! There are soooo many restaraunts to choose from and all the alcohol you can possibly drink!  You have liquor dispensers in your room with 5 bottles of basically whatever you want in it!  They also stock the fridge in your room full of corona bottles every morning!  They exceeded all expectations when we were there last year and another reason we are headed back there this year!

A good place to look is in the Pattaya Post, which is also online. They have an extensive range of apartments advertised, from short to long term.<br>  As for leaving the country, rules are constantly changing, however as I understand it, at the moment you may come in to Thailand on your 30 day visa, and then if you are in Pattaya you would probably take a bus to the cambodian border and renew it there. This is done within the day. Its just a case of going into Cambodia, and then coming back into Thailand on a new visa. Renewal of these visas are now only for a 15 day period, as are all land crossings in Thailand now, as opposed to the previous 30 days granted.<br>  This rule has been brought into effect because of the large amount of foreigners living and in some cases, working illegally in Thailand, and Pattaya is one of these hot spots.<br>  If you come in back through one of the international airports then a 30 day visa is still granted on arrival.

Would you be interested in pursuing any studies while in France? If so, check out the link to Campus France below. <br>  <br>  Another option, if you and your girlfriend are in a serious and committed relationship, is to consider a "PACS." This is basically a type of civil union that many foreigners enter into with their French significant others that allows for certain benefits without the complications of marriage. After one year of living together, you can receive a "Carte de sejour vie privee et familiale," which is a residency card that would make you fully eligible to work in France. <br>  <br>  Finally, if you've completed at least 2 years of university, you could be eligible to become an English teaching assistant, which involves working 12 hours per week leading English conversation courses in the French public school system.  It's one of the few easy ways for North Americans to move to France and work legally.  If that interests you, check out the second link, below.

If you are hoping to avoid a crowd, then sorry it can't be done.  They are trying to squeeze 2000-3000 people on a ship through one door.

dc6b4bfdb75c28be32d965d3d43e476daa	Because individual colors are not as individual as we tend to think.  There is a spectrum of colors, a certain point of which is perceived as blue, pink, green, etc, but where on the spectrum one color ends and the next one begins is arbitrary and seems to differ from culture to culture (and probably from person to person).  The number of colors in the rainbow, for example, is 7 in Japan, but in other parts of the world it varies - 2, 5, 7, etc.<br>  <br>  And in the old days, the Japanese word ao (blue) included what we now see as green.  Today, there is a fairly clear distinction between the two colors; for example, if you show a green piece of paper to a Japanese person and ask what color it is, he or she will invariably answer "midori".  But the usage of "ao" for green remains in a lot of idiomatic expressions, such as green traffic light, green apple, and green caterpillar (cabbageworm).  The same goes for red/pink, although to a lesser extent perhaps.|`|07ab852c995d3435bb3b1d221b24decfaa	Red is aka and pink is pinku. Blue (aoi) and green (midori) aren't really the same either.

bf5084d1ec35330c95ff7b7bd883bbffaa	First of all...try to streamline your luggage needs.  2-3 bags for 6 weeks is ridiculous.  I recommend carrying enough to hold you through 1 week and then find a laundromat or use the hotel's laundry services.  Hotel laundry can be expensive if they do it, but some hotels nowadays also have washers & dryers available so you can do it yourself.<br>  <br>  Second...when traveling by one airline, you have a 10% chance your luggage won't arrive at it's destination.  If traveling by 2 or in your case 3, it rises exponentially.  You are just asking for your luggage to be lost permanently!<br>  <br>  Also, baggage fees are EACH WAY, for EACH Airline.  so, you'll have a minimum of 6 fees per bag for your 3 bags you're thinking of bringing.<br>  <br>  You should, if you pack it well, be able to pack 5 to 7 days of clothing into one single or possibly two carry-on bags and you won't need to worry about your luggage never making it to your destination, or baggage fees either.<br>  <br>  Make it easy on yourself.<br>  <br>  ADDED LATER:  The 1 to 2 carry-on bags includes your camera and notebook case.  Don't forget you can pack slim items in your notebook case too!<br>  <br>  ...and when you have gifts to come back with you...try mailing them or get the sales store to mail it back to you.  Many will do that for you.<br>  <br>  I often mail my dirty clothes back (after all, who would want to steal dirty clothes from the mail?) and then carry the gifts with me in the space I made available in my luggage.|`|TWMUXDhKaa	I would suggest finding a quarter Laundromat before hauling 6 weeks of clothes around.<br>  <br>  <br>  Don't carry your contact solution in your carry on, it will just get rejected as a liquid over __ounces.<br>  <br>  Call your airline companies, or call your booking agent.  Personally I would have just paid the 5 dollars more to book one airline company, but if you want you can move your luggage multiple times.  <br>  <br>  I would try to find a flight right out of Ohio to Argentina, having to hop a few times to get to JFK would be a pain.|`|3Wxx2FPkaa	You can book your luggage from your originating point to final destination. Suppose if you're traveling New York / London / Singapore / Melbourne. At the time of briefing your flight, Ask your airlines agent at JFK airport to put baggage tag for Melbourne (your final destination). In this case, you don't have to worry about your baggage, the airlines involved in your travel will take care of the baggage itself.<br>  Have a Nice Trip

KS2OHXCRaa	This is rather straight forward. Take the RER B (direction Robinson/St Remy) from the airport, and it's direct to Gare du Nord. The cost for the ticket is €8.40 for one way travel. Travel time estimated about 35-40 minutes.|`|rvTcDJ6yaa	Next to CDG airport there is a train. The RER train takes you directly into Paris.

818a6c4a96262d3d9669cd5c91b5efaeaa	I think the information is incomplete and misunderstood.  the great majority of the violence occurs in the border towns..yet people seem to think it is widespread in all of Mexico.  The great majority of Mexico has lower crime rates than most of the U.S.  Also, Americans are very anygry and indignant about the border town violence but do not direct their anger at the American citizens who support the drug  gangs with 15 to 20 billion dollars a year they spend on drugs!  And there is no uproar about the gun shows and gun shops in the U.S. who sell 90% of the guns to those gangs. The U.S.  has a great deal of responsibility is this drug violence.  I am an American living in Mexico(perfectly safely) and can see both sides of the issue.  Just think how many questions you see here on Answers from Americans wanting to know if they can drink underage in Mexico and how easy is it to buy drugs here...these are the kind of Americans supporting the gangs...they have no respect for Mexican or American laws.  Your comments hit the nail on the head.  People write in here claiming tourists are being killed and they give a reference to an article.  I read the articles and there is not one word about tourists being killed.  Yes , some American citizens have been killed in the U.S. and in Mexico..in border towns, and many documented to be involved in drugs.  there are thousands of Americans and other foreign citizens living in Mexico perfectly safely.  any American tourist that spends time in border towns or takes part in risky behavior, puts himself at risk...but he also has the choice of using good common sense and avoiding those towns and behaviors.|`|wggQRDb2aa	the United states is going through a recession and therefore instead of losing millions of dollars to Mexico during spring break, they are encouraging people to stay in the United States for spring break. Don't fall for it. <br>  <br>  DF is sick!! I was just there by the way.|`|kFKA8SXraa	I live in Reynosa,  I now the media does not exaggerate, I actually think they fall short of the truth. On the incident that happened here a couple of weeks ago, the news published was far short from what really happened.<br>  But in all honesty, being used to this, it is not as bad as it is perceived.<br>  In summary, no matter where you are at any given place and time, you can Always be at the wrong place, at the wrong time, the only thing here is that when in Reynosa (or any other conflict area) you chances of being in the wrong place at the wrong time are slightly higher.<br>  <br>  Only point was to answer your question, not getting into the details of where americans vacation at.|`|AA10042296	I think that part of this is an effort to get people to stay in the USA and spend their money at California, Florida and Gulf coast beaches.
kgBPU4xxaa	Yes, you'll need to take the train from Rome to Naples and then change to the Circumvesuviana train to Sorrento. You can find schedules and prices for the Rome to Naples leg of the trip here: <a href="http://www.trenitalia.com/cms/v/index.jsp?vgnextoid=ad1ce14114bc9110VgnVCM10000080a3e90aRCRD" rel="nofollow">http://www.trenitalia.com/cms/v/index.js...</a><br>  <br>  The trip time and price depend on the type of train you take. The new fast trains take 1 hr 21 min and cost 36.10 euro in 2nd class. However, if you buy the ticket at least a day in advance, there's a discounted fare (Amica) for 28.90 euro. An Intercity Plus train on the same route takes a little over 2 hours and costs 19.50 euro (15.80 euro at the Amica rate). The even slower regional trains (many stops) take 2 hr 41 min and cost 10.50 euro (no discounted fare).<br>  <br>  The Circumvesuviana trains leave from another section of the station in Naples. You can find a trip planner for schedules here: <a href="http://www.vesuviana.it/web/en/homepage" rel="nofollow">http://www.vesuviana.it/web/en/homepage</a> The starting station is Napoli Garibaldi. Travel time is 1 hr 7 min. The cost is about 3 euro.<br>  <br>  The total travel time depends on how much you want to spend on the trip and how long you have to wait between trains in Naples.|`|95b3c1cab8a1f1f08d03b46eefc17755aa	Try to time the section of your journey between Naples and Sorrento for daylight hours, because the Bay of Naples is simply magnificent.
v2SLmMCyaa	I just made that drive last summer.  7 hours is accurate.  The Jersey Turnpike is usually bogged down with traffic anyways so even if you drive quick the trip will still take that amount of time.  Have fun in Philly!
JiIdLde8aa	Vietnamese is the main language, with English being the second. Some French is spoken, but mainly by the elderly.|`|rFg9Ef86aa	I have lived in HCM for 9 years and have never seen people speak French.  The french colonization period was started in the 1850s and lasted until 1954 (Dien Bien Phu).  During that period of time, French officials held higher post and the economy was usually controlled by Chinese , especially the south.  Before the French colonization, the Vietnamese would speak Vietnames and write in Han Chinese, like Cantonese, TieChao, Fujian people in China today.   During the colonization Romanized characters was introduced to the Vietnamese and thus Han Chinese was abandoned as a method of writing.  <br>  <br>  Other than English, you have Cambodian, Chinese, some French from very old people as languages spoken there.  I think Chinese is spoken with the highest number after Vietnamese.  There were 1.5 million Chinese before the unification, and now probably number 1 million or so.  The Chinese left Vietnam due to discrimination by the native Vietnamese. <br>  <br>  Since the French and English don't live there and only go there as travelers, we can say that the Chinese who live in Vietnam and speak Chinese on a daily basis will overwhelm all other languages spoken besides Vietnamese.|`|EER9kCrTaa	No, it's not. <br>  Vietnamese is the official language here, and most of us speak it as our native language. French is the second most popular foreign language in Vietnam (with English being the first), and no one speaks French on a daily basis.|`|i692qAe8aa	Vietnamese is the main language spoken there, English and French is just a subject in    <br>  schools|`|9VzCaf0eaa	I'm Vietnamese and I lived in Vietnam until I was 11 (1994) and has gone back there recently.  Vietnamese is the main language spoken there.  People who know English or have studied English are on the rise but many only speak Vietnamese.  For my whole life (the time I lived there and the time I visit recently) I've never seen or heard French being spoken once.  So on the topic of French being spoken "regularly" in Vietnam?  My answer is NO.  ^_~|`|AA10601927	no.. quite a number of old timers can [ and enjoy speaking french given the opportunity. its quite common for students to study french.. and many viets go to france to study but outside of that french is almost never spoken in viet nam|`|V7lGsaR8aa	I never heard it all except from my French mate when our Rugby team were beating there's , i think he was swearing at me . The second and widely spoken language is English .|`|2YlQy8QRaa	not as popular as english but yes, u can find Librarie Francaise here and such.
AA11948690	Others might say differenlty, but Chicago is relatively inexpensive as far as big cities go. YOu can find a decent apartment in a decent neighborhood for around $700. Maybe even less! As far as living expenses, that's up to you and your tastes. If you have expensive tastes and like to shop at places like Whole Foods, etc., it's going to be high. If you're fine with the smaller shops with decent food but not all of the frills, you will do OK. There is decent public transportation here and you can go anywhere in the city for $2.25 a ride on the bus or subway/elevated train.<br>  <br>  As far as nightlife, there are cheap sketch and improv comedy shows, cheap plays, cheap restaurants, etc. You have to be 21 to drink here so unless you are that age I'm going to leave out the part about the bars, etc. You'll have to figure out the nightlife on your own :)  Btu there are a couple of rock clubs that cater to underage crowds and there are always concerts in town almost every night of the week.<br>  <br>  Coming from Florida, you might need to beware of winter in Chicago. It can get pretty brutal. Like right now it's about 50 degrees and people are going nuts, walking around without jackets, eating in the parks. This is like summer to us (although it WILL get much hotter later in the year). But winter can be plenty brutal so get ready for it: coats, scarves, boots, gloves, the whole nine yards.<br>  <br>  But as far as life in the city, what Chicago offers, you couldn't make a better pick.|`|6eGZGEw4aa	man on the street is pretty accurate. The train and bus transportation is super re-liable and easy. During the summer, a lot of people ride their bikes.<br>  <br>  Chicago offers a little bit of everything, in every aspect. It's a beautiful city :)|`|AJmCHSwmaa	Chicago colleges are all very liberal, liberal to the point of having terrorists like William Ayers teach there. Chicago is also very expensive, 11% sales tax, high public transportation costs, if you somke it's $11 a pack, sales tax on alcohol, soda and bottled water as well. It's very expensive. I would recommend living in the burbs and commuting into the city. You get to enjoy the good stuff without paying ridiculous taxes and prices. Btw, gas gets taxed 3 times in chicago unlike every other state where its taxed only once.|`|YrrFIoEiaa	Ride the train & Bus & rent is hi there, A lot of people there you will need to live on the north side of town don't live in the south part of town if you what to live a long time You can ride a bicycle by the lake a long ways Chicago cubs is on the north side of town
URO3gDXcaa	greyhound or concord trailways.  maybe dartmouth motor coach.  peter pan?
9kMJJ1giaa	I don't think you will find any heavy metal bars, sorry.  There are several good music stores, if you are talking about being able to purchase an instrument.  There is Guitar World, that is awsome!!  They have everything!<br>  <br>  You should go see Niagara Falls, while you are in Buffalo.  You can also go to the Canadian side.  The falls are very pretty to see in the night too, because of the lights.  You can get a motel for a good view of the falls/lights at night.  Canada has a lot better bars!  They also have Casino's, if you like to gamble a little.<br>  <br>  Buffalo has a nice little zoo.  There is also the Aquarium.   <br>  <br>  I hope you have a good time!  Dress warm, it has been very cold here!
AA12354535	An NIE number is a "Número de identificación de extranjero". <br>  <br>  You will need this if you intend to do any of the following:<br>  <br>   - Open a bank account in Ibiza<br>   - Buy a car<br>   - Buy a house<br>   - Pay taxes<br>   - Sign a permanent work contract<br>   - Start a business<br>   - Become a resident<br>  <br>  You need to apply for it either at the Police Station or the Oficina de Extranjeros. Make sure you go straight to the entrance and show your passport to the guard as you don't usually have to join the queue if you are from the EU. <br>  <br>  I would say that if you were going to work just for the summer, you wouldn't need an NIE number. Most summer jobs are paid in cash and don't entail an official contract. <br>  <br>  You can also set up a non-resident bank account in Ibiza if you want to with your passport.|`|kMK9E2a7aa	Your biggest problem is not your NIE, it is getting a job. There will soon be 4 million people unemployed in Spain. Tourism is already down by nearly 20%. Where I live there is 20% unemployment.

dcd11iUwaa	based on what you've said i would recommend the sunshine coast.<br>  people are really friendly, te beaches are some of the best in the world and the nightlife is great.<br>  if thats not enough excitement for you then go to the gold coast.|`|NyJeK6NSaa	I lived in Sydney for about five years. I live directly in the CBD, but I wish I lived in a neighborhood just outside the central city called Woolhara. It's really beautiful and peaceful, but with great restaurants (bills, Bistro MonCur, Buon Ricardo, etc) and beautiful botiques and antique shops. As far as food shopping goes, Simon Johnson and Jones the Grocer are two fantastic gourmet providores. And the Edgecliff station is like a mini food hall, with, butcher counter, bread, fresh pasta and a Harris Farm Market store.<br>  It's very easy to get to the city center from there, too....by bus or train station at Edgecliff.<br>  <a href="http://www.planbooktravel.com.au" rel="nofollow">http://www.planbooktravel.com.au</a> Must check out this link..|`|7RbootLlaa	If you want to get laid (sex). Sydney is the place to go. If you want to get sex and be on the beach. The Gold Coast.<br>  If you want to just cruise around sight seeing. Adelaide or Perth.<br>  If you want to go swimming with crocodiles, type into a search engine Ginger Meadows. Even Australians know not to go anywhere near crocodiles, especially swim with them. (They are not like dolphins).<br>  I got side tracked .... If you do want to swim with crocodiles? Darwin.<br>  If you want to freeze your *** of? Tasmania.<br>  If you want to do sightseeing, clubbing, gay sex and have a party Melbourne.<br>  As for Canberra, unless you are an arsehole. Don't go there. All the politictions work there.|`|QLwP5GzQaa	i didnt like bondi myself, its quite run down - although good for surf.<br>  I think Manly is a good beach area-its got lots of life there - good shops, good restuarants - not sure on the night life but its got good access to sydney city centre.|`|yzKrwvxSaa	north sydney or manly. their close to the city and manly had a great beach|`|UZKGEXB1aa	Bondi Beach i am 100% sure , research it
4S5NnT7aaa	No, probably not.
KZaURPnGaa	Yes, I have travelled to all the islands in the US Virgin and British Virgin and I have to say St. Thomas is my least favorite. My favorite is the island Virgin Gorda in BVI. There are many beaches, small resorts, and great sun here. My secound favorite is St. John USVI but rent a house if you can in Chocolate Hole, that is the best place I think. My all time favoirte thing to do is rent a sailboat from Horizon Yacht Charters in Nanny Cay Marina, Tortalla, BVI and sail around the BVI. That way you are able to see all the islands and re-visit the ones you liked if you have time. The BVI is a lot safer than St. Thomas and the locals on St. Thomas arent as nice as those of BVI. Happy sailing days.|`|23F70N1Raa	St. Thomas is a beautiful island!  My wedding rings came from there, I was proposed to there on the beach and I visited on my Honey Moon.  The beaches are beautiful (the island is very hilly) the shopping is great.  This is one of the best islands if you plan to buy gold or diamonds or bring back liquor.  T-shirts and other souvineres are all about the same as other islands.  I would say that you should stop there!  Also consider St. Marten, Antiqua, and Dominica (in Dominica you can swim at Ti Tao Gorge where they filmed Pirates of the Caribian 2).  Have fun!|`|4xOXiZcNaa	If you are such an amateur, inexperienced traveler that you have to be safe at all times.. THEN STAY HOME.. there is NO PLACE that is completely safe.. and the Caribbean has been getting more violent and less safe for the past few years... hell.. there are even PIRATES operating in the Caribbean now and CRUISING SAILORS HAVE BEEN KILLED.|`|Gabo2Uc7aa	It's mainly beaches, bars and cabs.  It's pretty.  It's just like anyplace else, be smart and be aware of your surroundings.
AA10863966	OK Alaska is HUGE!<br>  <a href="http://www.tongass-seis.net/media/tong_USA.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.tongass-seis.net/media/tong_U...</a><br>  <br>  so first I might consider picking one region that you would like to explore. In many areas towns are far apart and may take more then a day to travel to, and some communities are not accessible by road. So I would do a  little research based on what you want to do/see and choose one region of the state. <br>  <br>  Travel can be a part of the adventure, so you may want to spend a few days driving and camping on one of the highways and make the journey as much a part of it as the destination. Typical examples include taking the AK Highway from Anchorage to Fairbanks, and maybe the train back. <br>  (side note Highways up here are 2 lane roads, no exits, no 7-11's, wildlife and beautiful scenery in long stretches between small towns: you won't confuse them with the congested multi-lane billboard laden nightmares in the lower 48)<br>  <br>  Also think about how you want to travel, pre-packaged tours or on your own, camping or hotels, ect. <br>  <br>  The best guide for planning and traveling up here is, hands down, The Milepost<br>  <a href="http://milepost.com/" rel="nofollow">http://milepost.com/</a><br>  <br>  and the state page has good information as well<br>  <a href="http://www.state.ak.us/local/visitorHome.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.state.ak.us/local/visitorHome...</a><br>  <br>  and this site gives good info:<br>  <a href="http://alaska.org/index.jsp" rel="nofollow">http://alaska.org/index.jsp</a><br>  <br>  <br>  Be realistic in how much you can really shove into a vacation when travel can be difficult or long and can eat up a lot of time. <br>  <br>  I would avoid Anchorage (sorry that my opinion and I am sticking with it) It is more like the lower 48 then anywhere else. Now there are some cool things in Anchorage, like the big airport, the cultural center: <a href="http://www.alaskanative.net/" rel="nofollow">http://www.alaskanative.net/</a><br>  <br>  and Seaveys Iditaride show: <a href="http://www.ididaride.com/tours/anchorage/wildride.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.ididaride.com/tours/anchorage...</a><br>  <br>  But really I would get out of there and really see the state. <br>  <br>  Here are some other things you might enjoy:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.go-alaska.net/Denali-National-Park/Horseback-Riding/" rel="nofollow">http://www.go-alaska.net/Denali-National...</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.akdogtour.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.akdogtour.com/</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.chenahotsprings.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.chenahotsprings.com/</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.warbelows.com/tours/tours.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.warbelows.com/tours/tours.htm...</a>|`|VYCLwKwNaa	I would contact horse groups in Fairbanks and on the Kenai Peninsula. Probably the easiest way to do that would be through the 4-H office of the University of Alaska Cooperative Extension Service in Fairbanks, 907-474-2427. (There are a LOT of horses in Fairbanks.) Then, you could make some friends with other horse lovers and maybe even ride together. Or you may be able to watch a horse event. Your teacher can help you make this connection. You could even talk to your state 4-H office and they can help you find names of people to contact.<br>  <br>  While you are in Fairbanks, check out the University of Alaska. Maybe you can move to Alaska to go to college. The price is good, and it's a nice school. <br>  <br>  Depending on how much time you have, and how you travel to Alaska, I would recommend the following places:<br>  Sitka-the first capitol of Alaska. Watch the dancing in the tribal hall, see the Russian Orthodox Cathedral, walk through Totem Park (also known as Sitka National Historical Park), walk on the docks and see the fishing boats and bald eagles, visit the Alaska Raptor Rehabilitation Center<br>  Juneau-the current capitol, see the capitol building, Mendenhall Glacier, the Alaska State Museum, ride the tram up Mt. Roberts,<br>  Skagway-site of the Gold Rush, you can fill out a little checklist and become a Junior Park Ranger while learning some cool stuff about the Gold Rush<br>  If you can't go to those places, you can see the ocean on the Kenai Peninsula at Seward (which has a nice marine life center, and some cool boat trips, and a glacier). Then, you will want to go to Denali National Park and take the park bus at least halfway in, so you can see some animals, and if the weather is clear, maybe even Mt. McKinley, the tallest mountain in North America. Bus rides need to be reserved, so call the Park for details. Bring your own food and drink, a jacket and a camera!!<br>  In Fairbanks, go to the University of Alaska Museum. Walk around Pioneer Park. Another fun place is Little Eldorado Gold Camp, where you can ride a tiny train and pan for gold. On the way to the Camp, you can see the big oil pipeline that takes oil from the top of Alaska all the way to Valdez. If you are coming in August, you can go to the Tanana Valley State Fair, and watch the horse competitions.<br>  <br>  There are lots more things to see and do in Alaska, depending on what you like to do. You might want to check a travel guide, such as the Lonely Planet guide to Alaska, out of your library.Or buy a copy at the bookstore. It will tell you more about shopping, places to stay, hiking trails, water parks, restaurants, etc. <br>  <br>  You can also write to the Fairbanks Convention and Visitors Bureau, Anchorage Convention and Visitors Bureau, etc. They will send you brochures.<br>  <br>  I know that you will have a lot of fun! Have a great trip!<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  If you are driving, watch the ponds and lakes in the early mornings, as you will often see moose standing in them.|`|JLayHNZCaa	You could visit tripadvisor.com a free site with reviews,  recommendations and links to hotels, attractions and restaurants in the area you are interested in.

27a6064141149e4c067b229800e7b9ffaa	Go back to Europe another time and see it properly. Europe does not run at the same speed as the US. You can't see the Eiffel tower and hope to gain any insight whatsoever into French - or even Parisian - life and culture. You need to spend a couple of days at least in any location to really get inside it.<br>  <br>  For instance I went to Prague a couple of years back for a week. Prague is not a big city by any stretch of the imagination. At the end of the week our flight was cancelled and we had to spend another day there, and still found interesting things to do (even with no money!)<br>  <br>  As for what you could do I would definitely try to get in on the cafe culture. Europeans often spend long hours in cafes (and you don't need to constantly have coffee like you do in Starbucks before they kick you out) particularly in Vienna and Paris. They are not like coffee houses (Starbucks etc), and are often more like cafe/restaurant/bars often serving food and alcohol too. Very often they are run by one family, or by a very small chain, so each one will be different.|`|Hjo3lN7zaa	Well first thing...where are you staying? You do know about Hostels, right? I'd def. suggest you stay there instead of a hotel. They are SUPER cheap, and much much funner! And they do not look junky at all...actually I think hostels look better than hotels, you just have to look at them online first or get brochures.<br>  Also, just be careful out there...<br>  Besides that, have an awesome time-I know you guys will =)|`|AA11544445	Wow...y'all won't have much time at all, and you'll probably be in groups and not allowed to wander off by yourselves, since you're with a school group (at least that was the case when I went with my school). Are you sure you're going to Lichtenstein? Why? That place is chintzier than Luxembourg, and there's nothing to do there!|`|AA11446032	I've never done a trip that rushed so I don't have much advice for exhaustion except for the obvious- avoid late night chatting and try to get decent sleep, wear very comfortable walking shoes, drink lots of water, eat healthy as much as possible. Just enjoy yourself. Remember that you are NOT at home and expect things will be different than what you are used to- that's why people travel, to experience the differences between cultures. Don't judge what you see, just enjoy it and take lots of photos.<br>  <br>  Have fun- it'll be great!!

zqEBmLeuaa	How lucky!  I want to win a trip to Vegas!<br>  <br>  Anyway...<br>  <br>  The Venetian is and upscale quieter hotel.  It is one of the nicer hotels in Vegas, definitely, so there is nothing wrong with staying there.  The Blue Man Group is supposed to be awesome, so you are lucky to have gotten tickets to that.  If you have time, I would definitely get some tickets to a Cirque De Soleil Show.  If nothing else, Mystere is awesome and is one of their more affordable shows at Treasure Island.<br>  <br>  We never rent a car when we go down there, there is really no need for one.  Everything touristy is located on the strip or downtown which is all accessible by bus, monorail, cab or foot.  As far as getting to Hoover Dam, you might want to rent a car for that unless you can find a group tour to go with.  I have never left the strip, so I don't know much about that.  For the transportation, a cab is obviously going to be the most expensive form.  The Monorail is $5 for one ride or $12 for an all day pass.  The bus is $2 for one ride, or $5 for an all day pass.  The monorail is a much faster form of transportation because there is no traffic.<br>  <br>  Here is a list of attractions <a href="http://www.vegas.com/attractions/" rel="nofollow">http://www.vegas.com/attractions/</a><br>  Monorail info <a href="http://lvmonorail.com/" rel="nofollow">http://lvmonorail.com/</a><br>  Bus info <a href="http://www.rtcsouthernnevada.com/transit/route/deuce/Deuce(1-11-09).pdf" rel="nofollow">http://www.rtcsouthernnevada.com/transit...</a><br>  Show discounts and info <br>  <a href="http://smartervegas.com/shows.aspx" rel="nofollow">http://smartervegas.com/shows.aspx</a><br>  <br>  The Cirque shows to choose from are<br>  <br>  KA at MGM Grand<br>  LOVE at Mirage<br>  CRISS ANGEL at Luxor<br>  Mystere at Treasure Island<br>  O at Bellagio<br>  Zumanity at New York- New York|`|qnJhgmrWaa	Just got back from Vegas and had a great time. This was my 5th trip in the past 6 years. Have never rented a car. All casinos offer trips to see Hoover Dam. Cheaper than renting a car. Just walking around and looking in all the different casinos will take up your time.|`|3Tm86iyDaa	I have lived here for 1 1/2 now and I'm not much into the casino glitz. I am 27 and an outdoor enthusiast here. If your into shows I would recommend the Cirque du soleil. There are however fun things to do if that's not your thing. You should visit Red Rock Canyon. Also try the  indoor skydiving <a href="http://www.vegasindoorskydiving.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.vegasindoorskydiving.com/</a><br>  This place if right off the north part of the strip so you could walk to it if you wanted. Also a place called  Skymania <a href="http://www.skymaniafuncenters.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.skymaniafuncenters.com</a><br>  I would also recommend when you go to the Hoover Dam you should go on the tour that takes you down in it. It may be boring but you can see the infrastructure that was built perfectly before we had the technology we have today. I have also gone on the Maverick Helicopter Tour that goes over the dam. They have different tour helicopters but I went on the ones in Boulder City that went over the dam.<br>  <br>  If I were you I would rent a car that way you dont have to worry about getting ripped off by a taxi cabbie. They like to take tourist on unnecessary routes for more money. If you do decide to use a taxi I would recommend you know the route beforehand so you know if the cabbie is taking you on an unecessary adventure to get more money.|`|6BkHiJlbaa	See a cirque De soleil show...They are the best.... I was just in Vegas last neext...we had a wonderful time... take spring like clothes since it was in the 70's when we were there.... As far as the Hoover Dam, try to get a blue flyer from one of the guys handing thaem out in front of NY NY...it was $52.00 but inculed the choclate factory and cactus garden, lunch and 2 hours at the Dam.... It was awesome... <br>  Hope you have a great time, I did and I cant wait to go back...It is DisneyWorld for adults...... Dont rent a car, just bring your tennis shoes and be perpared to walk... But make sure you check out all the hotels, they all have something different in them.....|`|acum2ROBaa	Well, i just got back from Vegas in december 08 and actually returning this June. I stayed at the Harrah's hotel and the Venetian  is a nice hotel as well. One show i HIGHLY recommend is Cirque Du Soleil. It's absolutely amazing! They have different shows you can pick from for the Cirque Du Soleil shows. I suggest the show called "O" they should know what I'm talking about, it has to do with acrobats flying through water and all that. We had a rental car for the night time. We mostly walked around in the Vegas strip during the day and its more fun that way. You get to see a lot more by foot than in a car during the day. I've never been to Hoover Dam but and not sure how far it is but if you have time  GO FOR IT! Have fun! OH YES! Beware (in case this is your first time) There are people handing out little cards as they flick the cards in their hands trying to pass them out, DO NOT TAKE THEM. You'll know why if you end up taking one......GOOD LUCK!|`|urHPuzMsaa	You really don't need a car. From the Venetian you can get to anywhere on the strip by walking. There is just so much to see and do here it is hard to begin. Just look at this site for highlights of things to see and do Though the Hoover Dam is nice to see you don't have to drive you can take a bus tour and then not have to deal with the strip traffic. To drive in Vegas is a world unto it's own. Not fun.|`|pTLcvsVfaa	If you can get a good deal on a rentall --go for it.<br>  <br>  Parking is free basically everywhere in Vegas. By the time you add up the cost of taxis and shuttles to Hoover dam, you are going to end up paying quite a bit more then a rental car.<br>  <br>  The last time I went to Vegas, i got a 3 day car rental for like 50$. The taxi back and forth from the airport is going to be about 40 rountrip. So when you look it at like that, its not a bad deal to get a rental car.|`|nxZQKmjMaa	The Venetian Hotel should have free brochures informing you (the traveler) of shows at different casinos, shopping malls, as well as providing some coupons, etc...There is also a free map fo the strip which shows where exactly all the casinos are and other hot spots.<br>  <br>  When you arrive you can always ask the front desk clerk what she recommends since this is your first visit. Of course if you are under 21 you will be limited in what you can do, you can go to circus circus and enjoy the amusement park inside or go shopping.|`|j7vfbwVUaa	You actually don't need a rental car in Vegas but if you plan to visit the Hoover Dam then you definitely need a car rental. Here are a few fun things to add to your list of things to do.<br>  <a href="http://www.lasvegas-how-to.com/things-to-do.php" rel="nofollow">http://www.lasvegas-how-to.com/things-to...</a>|`|AA11391247	Since you are staying at the Venetian, you MUST go see Wayne Brady. His show is great. <br>  <br>  Unless you plan on driving off the strip, you do not need a rental car. My suggestion is to take a Taxi from the airport, not one of the shuttles. I sat on a shuttle for 2 hours (with no air conditioning) until I got to my hotel. It was no fun. You can use the monorail system (which picks up at the imperial palace about 2 buildings down from the Venetian) and get a day pass to go up and down the strip. <br>  <br>  Hoover Dam is about an hour or so outside of Vegas, we drove to it last summer. <br>  <br>  As far as gambling... dont gamble in the expensive hotels. Go to Imperial Palace or Sahara and you will have lower minimums on the tables.|`|dFBccLExaa	The Venetian is a great hotel, and Phantom is an awesome show. I've seen it twice, loved it both times. <br>  For Hoover dam, I'm not sure about the tours, but renting a car can be stressful as there is a LOT of traffic there. The dam isn't but 30-40 minutes away from the Strip, so it's not too bad. But with traffic, you could be waiting  a while. Make sure you're okay with pedestrians and narrow winding roads if you're gonna drive.<br>  The Strip is jam packed with stuff to see. You could go to the Bellagio and see the conservatory in the lobby- that's free, along with their fountain show. The Mirage has a volcano show, and tigers. At the Venetian, you could always ride a gondola- it's not free, but I hear it's pretty fun, or you could go to Madame Toussaude's. There are tons of things to do. I'd recommend just walking around and taking it all in.
eD7qRBKHaa	This time of year, you never know if a hurricane is going to hit.  But of course, that cannot be predicted.

OqZ0EA5Taa	Hello, I'm an American that has lived in Cabo for the past 3 years full-time.  I can honestly say that Cabo is safe.  All the hype the US is putting on vacationers going to Mexico is a bit overboard.  The places in Mexico that are bad are mainly in mainland Mexico and border towns that your not likely going to visit on vacation.   <br>  <br>  Use your commonsense.  I wouldn't go walking down a dark ally with people I didn't know. I wouldn't do that in my hometown.  <br>  <br>  The Riu is just outside downtown Cabo and I'm sure you'll have a great time.  Cabo is the place you can rest, relax, or party nonstop.  You make the choice and you wont regret it.  <br>  <br>  Here is a link to a website my company put together that will give you info on all aspects of Cabo.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://hotoncabo.com/" rel="nofollow">http://hotoncabo.com/</a><br>  <br>  Hope this helps.|`|YaXnwtgsaa	it is beautiful down there i went to Cabo during the summer  i loved it there is no danger just be careful like always|`|iXqnvcyVaa	i heve and it is safe dont worry there is no violence|`|wggQRDb2aa	the United states is going through a recession and therefore instead of losing millions of dollars to Mexico during spring break, they are encouraging people to stay in the United States for spring break.

mx32BnQAaa	Here is a quick list of the most popular destinations: <br>  <br>  Athens - capital, acropolis, major museums and many nearby sites <br>  Corfu - large island with many attractions <br>  Crete - island with varied attractions <br>  Delphi - site of the famous oracle of Apollo, major archeological site <br>  Meteora - hilltop monasteries <br>  Mount Athos - semi-independent ecclesiastical republic <br>  Mykonos - world famous sophisticated vacation center <br>  Olympia - sanctuary dedicated to Zeus, site of the ancient Olympics <br>  Rhodes -island with ancient monuments, as well as beaches <br>  Santorini - great natural wonder and Greece's major honeymoon destination <br>  <br>  Popular local dishes<br>  The traditional fast foods are gyros (γ?ρο?, "GHEER-ohs", not "JIE-rohs" as in "gyroscope"), roast pork or chicken (and rarely beef) and fixings wrapped in a fried pita; souvlaki (σουβλ?κι, "soov-LAH-kee"), grilled meat on a skewer; Greek dips such as tzatziki (τζατζ?κι), made of strained yoghurt, olive oil, garlic and finely chopped cucumbers and dill or mint; and skordhalia (σκορδαλι?), a garlic mashed potato dip which is usually served with deep fried salted cod. <br>  <br>  With its extensive coastline and islands, Greece has excellent seafood. Try the grilled octopus and the achinosalata (sea-urchin eggs in lemon and olive oil). By law, frozen seafood must be marked as such on the menu. Some fresh fish, sold by the kilo, can be very expensive; if you're watching your budget, be sure to ask how much your particular portion will cost before ordering it. <br>  <br>  Greek salad (called "country salad" locally, "HorIAtiki"), a mix of tomatoes, cucumber, feta cheese and onion – all sliced – plus some olives, and occasionally green bell pepper or other vegetables, usually garnished with oregano. Traditionally it is dressed only with olive oil; vinegrette or lettuce are added only in the most tourist-oriented restaurants. <br>  <br>  Also consider: <br>  <br>  moussaka, a rich oven-baked dish of eggplant, minced meat, tomato and white sauce <br>  pastitsio, a variety of lasagna <br>  stifado, pieces of meat and onion in a wine and cinnamon stew <br>  spetzofai, braised sausage with pepper and tomatoes, a hearty dish originally from the Mt. Pelion region <br>  saganaki, fried semi-hard cheese <br>  paidakia, grilled lamb chops, are also popular. They tend to have a gamier taste and chewier texture than North American lamb chops, which you may or may not like <br>  Fried potatoes (often listed on menus as chips) are a naturalized Greek dish, found almost everywhere. They can be very good when freshly made and served still hot. Tzatziki is usually a good dip for them, though they are still good on their own. <br>  <br>  For dessert, ask for baklava, tissue-thin layers of pastry with honey and chopped nuts; or galaktobouriko, a custard pie similar to mille feuille. Other pastries are also worth tasting. Another must-try is yogort with honey: yoghurts in Greece are really different from what you used to see at Dannon stores. Fruit such as watermelon is also a common summertime treat. <br>  <br>  For breakfast, head to local bakeries (fourno) and try fresh tiropita, cheese pie; spanakopita, spinach pie; or bougatsa, custard filled pie, or even a ""horiatiko psomi", a traditional, crusty village type bread that is a household staple, and very tasty on its own too. All are delicious and popular among Greeks for quick breakfast eats. Each bakery does own rendition and you are never disappointed. Have this with a Greek coffee to be local. <br>  <br>  A popular drink is a frappe made with instant Nescafe, water, sugar , and sometimes milk. It is frothed and served over ice~<br>  Personally i prefer to carry money~|`|yEe3WkFCaa	Do's: Beaches, site-seeing (historical monuments like Parthenon), shopping, going to a local cafeneio to live the Greek feeling of life, cruise of islands.<br>  Eat's: Traditional and local Greek food like Pastitsio, Mousaka, Souvlakia, Tsatsiki, Horiatiki Salata, Lahanopita, etc.<br>  See's: Acropolis, the Plaka, different islands of interest, Delphi, etc.<br>  Some islands are indeed, very nice, but there are many cities that are very beautiful.  Try Nafpaktos, Athens, Patra, Thessaloniki, Kalamata, etc.  <br>  Islands: Crete, Leukada, Andros, Mykonos, Santorini, Rodos, Corfu, etc.|`|CJbSrsQdaa	Greek common people arround Omonia and Syntagma...|`|xhLWBV4yaa	Definitely Corfu....if you have good company it will be the best.

Happy sailing!|`|94b8KImYaa	Depends what nationality you are. <br>  As an US national you do not need a visa.|`|cb1c8e5fcd8492bc3787fd1b614481ecaa	No visa is needed but you may need a passport.<br>  <br>  On June 1, 2009 all cruise passengers will be required to possess a passport unless on a closed loop cruise (see below). Prior to that date if you are only traveling to and from Canada, Mexico, the Caribbean and Bermuda you only need documentation as indicated in the closed loop rules below. Travel to all other countries requires a passport.<br>  <br>  U.S. citizens on closed-loop cruises (cruises that begin and end at the same port in the U.S.) will be able to enter or depart the country with proof of citizenship, such as a birth certificate and government-issued photo ID. A U.S. citizen under the age of 16 will be able to present either an original or a copy of his or her birth certificate, a Consular Report of Birth Abroad issued by DOS, or a Certificate of Naturalization issued by U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services.<br>  <br>  Please be aware that you may still be required to present a passport when you dock at a foreign port, depending on the islands or countries that your cruise ship is visiting. Check with your cruiseline to ensure you have the appropriate documents for the stops you’ll be making on your cruise.<br>  <br>  Even though a passport is not required I would highly recommend one. If you get stuck in a foreign country without one you can't fly home. The passport cards that are being issued as an alternative to the passport book will not allow you to fly.<br>  <br>  ? ??l???q ?|`|b4wwddhbaa	If you're an American citizen, you DO need proof of citizenship to go on a cruise to the Bahamas.  This is a relatively new requirement.  While a passport is not required, it is the best proof.<br>  <br>  However, that's not exactly what you asked.  I'm not sure why you would think you need a visa to go to the Bahamas.  Again, assuming you're a US citizen, you can find lots of information about traveling on the Department of State website.|`|X9PoKz2iaa	Are you a United states citizen? If so you don't need your passport if you don't have time to get it. You can use your birth certificate if you were born in the US. From then on you just have to show your access card the cruise line assigns you with to get on and off the ship.<br>  <br>  They also list it on their website.|`|kH2ab8Lzaa	If you are American, then the answer is no, you do not need a passport.  That being said, it's never a bad idea to carry one on a trip in international waters.|`|2quTUoA6aa	I think that you ought to take Mastercard and Capital One also.|`|OGV5OBk5aa	I would recommend that you carry a passport anytime you leave the United States.

However, it will be about $45 and up, depending on what cab service you use. I know because I work at the Hilton Garden Inn right outside the airport, and we always recommend that our guests use Airport Taxi and Limo. Their phone number is 847-297-5556. You can also try calling their 800 number at 800-707-0380. They charge our guests a set rate of $45. <br>  <br>  As for time planning, it takes 45 minutes with no traffic, and about an hour to an hour and a half if it's rush hour, between 4-6pm.<br>  <br>  Best of luck :)|`|rbanG8FRaa	Depends upon how much time you have. <br>  There is a bus that travels between the two airports $14 per person. <br>  If you have more time you could try the cta ($2.5 per person).

If you book a car service, they typically require that you call them after you retrieve your bags. Although a car service is much nicer, that process can delay the transfer by about 10-15 minutes. Instead, just step outside to the taxi line and you should have a car within a much shorter wait. (By the way, always beware of any alleged "private drivers" who solicit business in the airport or even outside -- it's illegal). <br>  <br>  Taxi will cost about $45, give or take, and you should be there in about 30-40 minutes (unless you're traveling during rush hour and then plan for a good hour).

RKLFYS2Naa	Hi I worked @ a strip club for 2 YEARS!! Soo..HERE are the<br>  <br>                   The 10 Strip Club Commandments !!!!!!<br>  Strip clubs can be a fun and sexy experience. However, there are some mistakes that many people make when they go. I've compiled a list of dos and (mostly) donts that will make your next visit more enjoyable. So pay attention as I unveil the 10 Strip Club Commandments.<br>  <br>  1. Thou Shalt Not Fall in Love With The Strippers<br>  This is a common rookie mistake. The thing to remember is that this is a job for the ladies. Their job is to get as much money from you as possible. Some guys take the sexual attention the wrong way. Just because she says you are cute doesn't mean that she wants to take you home. Dancers would tell Shabba Ranks that he looks like Morris Chesnut to get an extra $20. They are there to dance and that's it. Don't let it go to your head.<br>  <br>  2. Thou Shalt Not Spend Your Rent Money--<br>  Whenever you go to a strip club, it's a good idea to budget how much you plan to spend. If you can afford $100, that's all you should bring to the club. You don't want to be put out on the street because Desire was shaking her *** in front of you. Porsha is not going to feed your family. And seriously, do you really want to explain to your girl that you can't take her out to eat because Destiny took your last $20? I think not. Be smart about it and don't spend more than you can afford.<br>  <br>  3. Thou Shalt Not Touch The Dancer (unless she touches you first)--<br>  Some dancers will let you touch. Some dancers wont. A good rule of thumb to follow is to let them take the lead. If a girl is standing 5 feet in front of you, her body language is saying "hands off muhfucka." Then you have the ones that will grind directly on your lap or grab your hands and put them where she wants them. Those are my favorites. Sometimes she will put her breasts near your mouth, but don't fall for that. Do not under any circumstances lick her nipple. That will get you kicked out the club faster than Twista raps.<br>  <br>  4. Thou Shalt Not Pay Attention To The DJ--<br>  At just about every strip club I've been to, the DJ talks ****. Don't let that affect your good time. While he makes his gay jokes and berates the patrons for not tipping, stay focused on the reason you came: naked ladies. After all, you paid your cover charge and you can do whatever you want. Don't let the fear of embarassment cause you to get pressured into tipping a girl you don't want.<br>  <br>  5. Thou Shalt Not Get Drunk--<br>  Getting drunk at a strip club is a risky prospect. Firstly, the alcohol may cause you to spend more money than you wanted to. You know what they say about lowered inhibitions. Secondly, if your in an inebriated state, you are far more likely to do something stupid like touch the wrong dancer. You don't want to go that route. Finally, the money that you will spend on drinks could be put to far better use by buying a table dance. Why should you tip fully dressed waitresses and bartenders when you could tip the dancers. I would suggest drinking beer. It costs less than liquor and you have a much greater chance of staying sober.<br>  <br>  6. Thou Shalt Not Use Plastic--<br>  Another common rookie mistake. Don't bring your credit or debit card into a strip club. All that's going to do is create an electronic trail of your whereabouts. Imagine your wife's surprise when she gets the monthly bill and sees a $500 charge to a strip club. Don't think you'll be out of the doghouse anytime soon. Hit up the ATM before you go the club. It's just smarter and also more fun to use cash. You can't put a credit card reciept in a dancer's G-string like you can with a dollar bill.<br>  <br>  7. Thou Shall Pick Wisely--<br>  This one is very important. You know what you like. If you like short girls, get one. If you like bg booties, by all means pick that one. Nothing sucks worse than paying for a dance from a girl you are not attracted to. They are going to ask you for a dance, but please listen to Nancy Reagan: Just Say No! And if your dream girl is on the other side of the club, don't settle for the closest thing to you. You will not be satisfied. It also is not a good idea to get a dance from a girl because she reminds you of your girlfriend or wife. You can see that at home, you are paying for a new experience. Once you become a strip club pro like I am, you can spot the girls that are going to dance the freakiest and make sure that's who you pay for. You can also sample a variety of different skin tones and body types without repeating yourself. So pick wisely.<br>  <br>  8. Thou Shalt Not Infringe On Your Boy's Dance--<br>  One of my pet peeves about strip clubs are guys (or girls) who don't buy their own dances. These characters will sit up in the club all night and not pay for anything. It is well within your right to do this, but if I am spending my hard earned money for a dance, don't stare at the girl like you paid for it. Keep your eyes on the stage; this is my table dance. And please, do not talk to m|`|poeYXBlfaa	If you are typical of most males, you are going to need a couple hundred dollars.

ToEzoAlcaa	I've been all around both countries and Switzerland is by far the better country.  First of all Switzerland has the best standard of living in the world meaning that its cities are very clean and people are extremely intelligent, sophisticated, and even some of the nicest people you'll ever meet.  Zurich is such an amazing city and as you head south, most of the country is immersed within the Alps, which are snow covered in the winter and the tops are snow covered in the summer with perfect turquise lakes.  I found that it was mostly clear weather in Switzerland while both times I have been to Austria there has been severe lightning and rain making it virtually impossible to enjoy the cities. <br>  <br>  Personally, I would rate Switzerland a 9.5 on a 1-10 scale and give Austria a 6 because the cities, culture, and food is extremely better in Switzerland and I found the people in Switzerland to be kind caring people while we were followed numerous times by pick pocketers in Austria especially in Salzburg and Vienna.  You don't have to worry about that nonsense in Switzerland because everybody believes in making their own money and striving for success in their life.  The people of Switzerland are quality as well as the scenery making it stand far above Austria.  Please choose Switzerland and have an awesome trip.|`|28f3beb29b657d3d0b6851852a284a79aa	Switzerland is beautiful but its like a cemetary, no fun for younger people. Austria is beautiful too, more things to do though. Depends on what are you going to do there. Skiing ? Then salzburg in austria or saint moritz in switzerland. One week is not so much time to visit the whole country, either swiss or austria. Plus swiss +more expensive.,|`|PU85li9Naa	Being that the two areas are so close, why not split the time and enjoy both countries? <br>  <br>  Train travel/car travel is so easy in that area; you will be able to see much more!!<br>  <br>  Some of the most friendly people in the world will be found there..|`|aqIJjidEaa	Switzerland, it's near, and if you have to stay only for a week it's better not to spend 2 of seven days flying :)|`|h0jCqEfeaa	Austria, no doubt about it. <br>  <br>  Vienna is simply unmatched by any city in Switzerland.|`|HyAvpatCaa	Switzerland is much prettier that Austria - when i went to Austria, i found it very boring, but Switzerland is a different story! - trust me!

10c1407ad3b148843d1e616e9a4c6215aa	Sadly France is given a bad press in England by people who have never been there and know nothing about it, though the Scots like the French and consider them  their "long distant cousins." <br>  There are still people in UK who believe that the French live on a diet of frog legs, snails and  cheese and they are are chauvinists who look down on anything British. Many Brits make no effort whatsoever to learn a modern language and expect the whole world to understand them when they land abroad, so they do not bother with French. This does not help common understanding.<br>  Likewise, because of the appalling behaviour of certain British people who go to France, drink themselves senseless or behave like morons, certain French people are convinced that the whole country has gone to the dogs. It is true that after WW2 English food was very mediocre and French people who have not travelled to the UK in the last twenty years have not realised that things have changed radically and the standard of British food has improved immensely. <br>  There are arrogant and obstinate people in both nations, but also many more kind and pleasant people who respect other people's views and demonstrate tolerance, seek a genuine understanding and demonstrate a true interest in others' way of life.<br>  Many of us have crossed the Channel and settled in each other's country and have learnt to love and respect their citizens. I was born in France but married an Englishman and have never regretted it. We have several children, some born on French soil and others in UK,  who are all multilingual and feel at home on either side of the Channel.<br>  <br>  There is so much to love in both countries.<br>   I like British customs and the tongue in cheek sense of humour that I have met there, the sense of "fair play" that still exists, and the very real honesty and generosity  shown by British people as well as their love of animals. Each time there is an appeal for a disaster or a fund raising event for a good cause, they always dig deep in their pockets whether it is for Pudsey and Children in Need, "Red nose day",  or they support all sorts of charities such as Oxfam or other  welfare organisations, including those for maltreated animals, most generously. <br>  Et bien entendu j'adore ma France natale  qui est si belle et qui a des traditions et des valeurs que je maintiens encore et que mes enfants respectent aussi: les grandes réunions de famille, la chaleur de l'amitié qui une fois donnée reste constante, le flair que l'on trouve partout depuis les petites vitrines aux arragements spectaculaires, les belles tables autour desquelles on se rassemble et on mange des repas cuisinés avec amour aux réveillons, aux communions et aux grands événements familiaux.<br>  Je suis pour l'entente cordiale et j'ai passé des années à encourager les rapports entre les deux pays, organisant visites et échanges culturels et faisant apprécier aux gens des deux pays les mérites l'un de l'autre, et je suis heureuse de voir tant de personnes s'établissant dans le pays qui traditionellement était l'énemi séculaire. La pauvre Jeanne d' Arc doit se ronger les ongles dans son coin de paradis puisque les anglais se réinstallent en France, mais elle a la consolation de savoir que le nombre de personnes quittant la France pour s'établir en Angleterre est aussi phénoménal.  Nous avons aussi notre cordon ombilical , construit en commun qui nous rattacher, malgré la débacle financière du tunnel, qui a avalé l'argent de tous ceux comme nous qui croyaient en sa nécéssité et son avenir. Il faut souhaiter que la génération suivante en récoltera le bénéfice.|`|i5FP4Vbraa	I've always had a very high opinion of the French and France, which I have visited quite often during my 68 years thus far.

Also next to the T in Kenmore Square for transportation to other places in Boston. It's older but servicable.  My brother and his wife liked it.  Probably $100-$150.<br>  There's also a Howard Johnson nearby that's cheap, but the location isn't as good, and I hear it's not so great.<br>  Get on expedia, and/or call the hotels.  Have a blast!

59b1fddc617491e538d31b5a8aa3904aaa	The Bigelow Top Load Day Pack from LL Bean has to be, at least for me, the best day pack that I've ever had.  That's coming from someone who has gone through a lot of day packs over the years.<br>  <br>  It's well made, it fits incredibly well, it's comfortable, it's easy to pack . It is pretty much everything you'd want in a day pack.<br>  <br>  The pack itself features about 2,000 cubic inches of storage space along with a number of different pockets and pouches for your gear.  Two of the handiest pouches are the mesh ones on either side of the bottom of the pack.  This lets you slip in your water bottles where they are easily accessible.  There's even a small compartment on the bottom of the pack that holds a rain fly to cover it with should the weather conditions turn nasty while you are hiking.  All of this comes in a package that weighs in at just under 4 pounds.<br>  <br>  Every strap that rests against your body is fully padded.  This is one of the reasons the pack is so comfortable.  You have padded shoulder straps and the waist strap is padded so that it provides extra support for the pack while remaining comfortable.<br>  <br>  I've been hiking with this pack for the last year and I have to say that it's just been great.  I don't have the sore shoulders or back that I have had with other packs because the Bigelow really does have a solid, but comfortable waist strap that can help hold the load on your waist instead of just your shoulders.  In addition, I've found the pack great as an all around daypack.  I can pack everything I need, even on cold weather ski trips.  Not only that, but on an overnight camping trip, I've been able to pack up everything I need in the pack so I don't have to use my larger backpacking pack.<br>  Overall I can't say enough good things about this day pack.  I love it.  .  I highly doubt you'll be disappointed.

Lemme think.<br>  <br>  Okay, I'll translate it this way.<br>  <br>  I love you because you are you (or yourself).<br>  <br>  This is not the same as "I love you for who are" since that implies that the qualities of the person are loved.  <br>  This is said to someone who has an open character and is confident in who they are. We can always trust such a person to be "real." <br>  Whether we love all the qualities or not doesn't matter. We know the person completely and that makes the relationship strong and secure, as long as we accept them for who they are.|`|Njuh0Dnraa	I just want to say that this sentence is not correct.it should have been like "seni sen oldu?un i?in seviyorum" I am not going to translate it because you already have the right translations
