20090226115323AACe5Tg	Environment;Green Living	Why are all the "green living" advocates pushing these CFC bulbs?	These bulbs are costly, ugly, made in China, and contain mercury which will ultimately be put into the environment. I put half of them in my house and noticed no savings on my electric bill. I think I will horde incandescent bulbs made in the USA that cost about 25 cents each, are not ugly and contain no mercury.

20090226133734AAGjC8Z	Environment;Global Warming	What are your thoughts on the updated Arctic sea ice data?	As most people are aware, the NSIDC had a sensor malfunction on one of their orbiting instruments which resulted in an underestimated Arctic sea ice extent at the end of January.  NSIDC now reports:      "NSIDC stopped displaying the problematic data, and recalculated sea ice extent using data from the DMSP F13 satellite, an older sensor in the same series of satellites. The recalculation changed the January monthly average ice extent by less than the margin of error for the sensor."      "The temporary error in the near-real-time data does not change the conclusion that Arctic sea ice extent has been declining for the past three decades. This conclusion is based on peer reviewed analysis of quality-controlled data products, not near-real-time data."    http://nsidc.org/arcticseaicenews/       As you can see from the updated data, current Arctic sea ice extent remains very close to the 2007 record low.    http://nsidc.org/data/seaice_index/image...       This contradicts the claim that the faulty sensor was disgusing that sea ice levels had returned to 1976 levels, made by individuals who shall remain gelatinous.  Clearly this claim is grossly false.      What are your thoughts on the updated Arctic sea ice data?

20090226143235AALmw8p	Environment;Green Living	Where do I recycle the plastic pumps from my plastic bottles?	Hi!  Does anyone know where I can recycle the plastic pumps from my plastic bottles?  Our township don't take them and neither does the local recycling center that takes almost everything else.  The recycling center did say if they were taken apart they might be able to recycle them, but there is no way I can take them apart...I tried.  It is such a shame, I have so many of them and I am really conscious about recycling. Any information would be deeply appreciated. Thank you and have a nice one. MJ :)

I know that much toilet paper in the US comes from 'virgin' forests which really means managed forests.  I also know that some TP comes from recycled material, so that would not apply here.  So, how much tree is needed to make the non-recycled kind?
