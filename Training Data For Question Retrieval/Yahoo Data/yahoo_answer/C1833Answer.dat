They also have just about every song in every genre.|`|8O3ZdHuTaa	Its illegal.  If you know it is illegal then why are you doing it?

Vt0xnuWpaa	No, it wouldn't be a good idea to just leave that laptop at the base setup. All of the components offered in the base setup are, well, base! You could easily get a Dell XPS M1530 with similar/better components at the very same price.<br>  <br>  If you leave it as is, you're only getting a GeForce 8600M GT, 160GB HardDrive @ 7200 RPM, 1GB of RAM, and a 2.1GHz Processor. That's pretty lame for a gaming setup by Alienware and pretty pricey for the $1100 range. You can easily get a pretty powerful setup by  another brand (MSI/Acer/Asus). This one for example: <a href="http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16834220483R" rel="nofollow">http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.as...</a><br>  <br>  Of course, the base setting will allow you to play most games that are out today, but don't expect to play them anywhere near maximum settings.<br>  <br>  The three most important things to consider upgrading are: CPU, GPU, and RAM. You want at least a 2.4GHz CPU for casual gaming - 2.6GHz and up for some really intensive gaming. Try to aim for the maximum available GPU - this will allow you to run all of the latest games in as high a setting as possible (Go for at least the ATI Mobility 3870 - GeForce 9800M GT recommended). And of course, RAM helps the CPU work faster - get 4GB at the very least.<br>  <br>  You also want to consider a larger hard drive for more storage space.<br>  <br>  Of course, all of these additions add to the price. You also want to consider getting an extended warranty on laptops as well because they tend to break down much more easily than desktops.<br>  <br>  In the end, you'll probably find yourself running very close to the $2000 for a competent "Gaming laptop" with can run many of the newest games at higher graphic settings.<br>  <br>  If you want a powerful Multimedia setup, you can go with some of the more basic options offered on the m15x. Or, you can try looking toward the Dell XPS Line (not the M1730, because it's a pretty expensive gaming laptop). Please note that "Multimedia" is meant for casual gaming - meaning you want to play all the games that are out there, but you don't really care about the graphic quality (only playable framerates and reasonable speeds).|`|4oyDKNHAaa	alienware computers are already good, but basically if you were an extreme gamer you would want more than the $1099.00 as the price for it.  but as a casual player you should be more than good for games<br>  <br>  but you could add a little bit more stuff if you wanted, set a limit of how much more you are willing to add and then play around with alienware's customize options|`|I91lFgTdaa	Well it does already have very good components, and it is considered one of the fastest laptops in the world as CNET.com would say.

B7THwJxvaa	Unless you have a MXM slot in your laptop (MOST laptops don't have this; its usually those big, heavy "gaming" laptops that do), you can't upgrade your laptop's graphics. I don't recommend to try to play Crysis on a laptop unless you're willing to buy an expensive "gaming" laptop.<br>  <br>  You can't play Crysis on that laptop unless you want it to run on unplayable fps. Keep in mind Crysis is the most demanding game in the market as of today. You need two GTX295s or two HD4870X2s to play on near- maximum settings and resolution.|`|Vt0xnuWpaa	Few laptops today allow you to do so (the Alienware line being one of the very last) I know for sure that recent Dell laptops use the soldering style. I own a Dell XPS M1530 and a did a little research myself a few months ago. I found some pictures of a dismantled M1530 and took at look at the GPU chip and it was very clearly soldered - no screws that you could undo to take out and replace the unit. <br>  <br>  The best thing you can do is update your video drivers and install ram for your integrated gpu chip. There's no much else you can do for most laptops.<br>  <br>  Unless you've ordered the laptop with the card you wanted, you can't swap it out. Unlike Desktop graphics cards, which are limited only by available slots, Laptop graphics cards are hard to find, and even harder to replace.<br>  <br>  Laptop GPUs are not cards at all, but GPU chips soldered into the motherboard (which is why the ones with dedicated cards are said to have "discrete graphics" and others have the built-in "integrated graphics" rather than having "cards"), so as are some of the CPUs - meaning you have to melt the metal solder to even take them out. This is the way most laptops today are made. You'll have to be a real expert to be able to swap them successfully - even then success isn't 100%. Manufacturers will not take them back for an upgrade.<br>  <br>  Furthermore, your laptop motherboard chipset will not allow for you to upgrade to a discrete GPU if you ordered it with the integrated card.<br>  <br>  Unless you have a laptop with a separate graphics unit or an MXM slot, you won't be able to upgrade/replace it. Check your manual to see if they allow any upgrades.<br>  <br>  -----------<br>  <br>  The only option you have left is to use an Expresscard-adpated graphics unit, but not yet. Maybe in the near future; right now external graphics through Expresscard is in the process of development/release.<br>  <br>  There aren't that many for sale yet in the U.S., but if you're lucky, you can find an ASUS XG Station for sale somewhere (but it won't be cheap considering its around $300 for the dock alone). You just need to have an Expresscard slot. They're only offering the 7900GS and 8600GT (desktop card) for the dock so far, but from the looks of the design you might fit other PCI-E x16 graphic cards into it in the future.<br>  <br>  However, because of the slower transfer bandwith through the ExpressCard port in comparison to the PCI-E x16 GPUs usually use, they will not perform nearly as well as built-in/native cards.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.hwupgrade.com/articles/print/mobile/18/asusxg.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://www.hwupgrade.com/articles/print/...</a><br>  <a href="http://img250.imageshack.us/img250/1671/asusxguh9.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://img250.imageshack.us/img250/1671/...</a>|`|FyeYc2ozaa	well it depends on the model you have. not all dell laptop can upgrade the video card. almost all dell xps laptop system can do it. but there is a few. what i recommend for you to do is, contact dell customer support and find out if your laptop model is capable of doing so, then go out and get a yourself a better video card for a cheaper price. all of ati x-series is recommend. but out of those selection, i would go with either ati x800 or nvidia geforce 6800gt.|`|t7cuerySaa	Crysis is one of the most demanding game ever and you can't upgrade onboard video chip(Mobile Intel 965) to a greater card here. that's the downside of buying laptop for playing games you can't snap anything you see in best buy and expect them to work with massive requirements games.sorry dude there's no magic solution for you my advice is get new custom build desktop for gaming purpose.tell the shop owner what you want to play i suggest do not get less than Nvidia 9800GT for Crysis.expensive? yes we never say pc gaming is cheap hobby.invest more you'll get satisfaction <br>  peace!

It had only cost me around 70 dollar upgrade for my computer which run similar specification as your computer. One thing good about ATI card are that they provided DVI and HDMI port for monitor connection. I got a cheap flat screen with DVI port. So I use HDMI out from graphic card to DVI in from flat monitor with the cable with HDMI head on one side and DVI head on other. <br>      ATI card are cheap and they are really good for displaying graphic but less powerful compare to NVIDIA. In your case , you need graphic card that can provide clear picture and not power. Because older version of Adobe CS4 series cannot utilized graphic power as the CS4 version. Plus, connecting your monitor with digital (HDMI or DVI) is important because that would takes load off the analog connection.

XmnVJxzaaa	The Pentium D 925 is the type of processor you have. It actually works with several types of motherboards, so I can't give you a suggestion based on that info alone.<br>  To help my with what kind of motherboard you have, would you please be so kind as to tell me the manufacturer (HP, Dell, Acer, etc... ) and model number of your computer (usually a combination of numbers and/or letters - D530, a700CF or something similar). With that information, I can give you a good idea of whether or not your motherboard has a PCI-e x16 slot.<br>  The PCI Express x16 slot is the newest graphics expansion slot. The PCI bridge you are familiar with was getting too slow for modern graphics cards. The organization in charge of the PCI slot standard got together and released a specification several years ago for the AGP slot (you may be familiar with that), but that was getting too slow and most recently they released the PCI Express standard.<br>  The PCI Express data bus is different from the PCI bus by allowing computer and motherboard manufacturers to assign extra bus width - called lanes - to various types of slots. Those extra lanes are measured using an 'x'. There are currently x1 slots, x4 slots, and x8 / x16 slots. Each slot has a different length, except the x8 and x16 slot. They are the same length and are usually dedicated to graphics cards. Here is the Wikipedia page describing PCI Express*.<br>  Anyhow, I hope this helps. If you need more info, please add more details to this question, or feel free to email me through my Yahoo! Answers profile.<br>  Good luck.<br>  <br>  EDIT<br>  Great! Thank you so much. I actually have the same chipset on my computer, the Intel 945G. Here's the quick specs on your system, by the way**.<br>  Your motherboard has one available a PCI-Express x16 and will support any graphics card that has that interface. Your case also seems large enough to hold most mid-range graphics cards. Another good thing about your system is it has a 300 Watt power supply. <br>  Which bring me to the first question you asked about the HD 3650... it will ABSOLUTELY work in your system. It has a 300 Watt power supply requirement. As long as the card you were looking at on Best Buy's website was PCI-e x16, your golden.<br>  Have fun!

To split a string where there words are separated by a space, simply specify a space (" ") as the parameter to the split() method.<br>  <br>  The following code example shows how to split a sentence into words:<br>  <br>  String sentence = "This is a sentence.";  <br>  String[] words = sentence.split(" ");  <br>    <br>  for (String word : words)  <br>  {  <br>     System.out.println(word);  <br>  }  <br>  <br>  <br>                                         OR<br>  <br>  int reverseWords()<br>  {<br>     char whole_line[MAX_LINE];<br>     char word[MAX_LINE];<br>     int i;<br>  <br>     printf("%s", "\nEnter a line of text (upto 50 characters): \n");<br>     fgets(whole_line, MAX_LINE, stdin);<br>  <br>     for(i = 0; i < MAX_LINE, whole_line[i] !='\0'; i++)<br>          putchar(whole_line[i]);<br>     <br>     <br>     if(whole_line[i] == ' ')<br>     {<br>        strcpy(word, whole_line); <-- how can i pass in just the word and not the whole line???<br>        printf("word in if --> %s",word);<br>           }<br>        return 0;<br>  }<br>  <br>                                                  OR<br>  <br>  #include <stdio.h><br>  #include <string.h><br>  <br>  int main(void)<br>  {<br>  int length,last,start = 0;<br>  char c,string[100];<br>  <br>  printf("Enter a string: ");<br>  gets(string);<br>  <br>  length = strlen(string)+1;<br>  <br>     for(int i=0; i<length; i++)<br>     {<br>        c = string[i];<br>  <br>        if(c == ' ' || c=='\0')<br>        {<br>           last = i-1;<br>  <br>           for(int j=0; j<i-start; j++)<br>           {<br>              putchar(string[last--]);<br>           }<br>           if(c!='\0')<br>           {<br>              putchar(' ');<br>           }<br>  <br>           start = i+1;<br>        }<br>     }<br>  return 0;<br>  }<br>  <br>                                            OR<br>  <br>  <br>  import java.util.StringTokenizer;<br>  public class Test<br>  {<br>     public static void main(String[] args){<br>        String strings = "one two three four five six seven";<br>        StringTokenizer chopper = new StringTokenizer(strings);<br>        strings = "";<br>        while(chopper.hasMoreTokens()){<br>           strings += new StringBuffer(chopper.nextToken()).revers...<br>           strings +=" ";<br>        }<br>        strings = strings.trim();<br>        System.out.println(strings);<br>     }<br>  }<br>  <br>  <br>                                     OR<br>  <br>  public static String[] getBigWords ( String t)<br>  {<br>  String[] end=t.split(" ");<br>  int co= 0;<br>  for (int o=0; o<end.length; o=o+1)<br>  {<br>  if(end[o].length()>5)<br>  {<br>  co=co+1;<br>  }<br>  }<br>  String[] y=new String[co];<br>  int g=0;<br>  for (int o=0; o<end.length; o=o+1)<br>  {<br>  if(end[o].length()>5)<br>  {<br>  y[g]=end[o];<br>  g=g+1;<br>  }<br>  }<br>  return y;<br>  }<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  This code is in C/C++/Java<br>  <br>  You must have got idea

co4MjPZeaa	You want to add a couple variables: max, min, and userInput.  <br>  <br>  Set your max to 0 and your min to a high number and check the userInput against those numbers.  <br>  <br>  If userInput > max, then max should equal the new user input and the opposite for min.<br>  <br>  Additionally, you would just cout <<  your variable  to display the results.  Good luck!
FBQZ06vraa	If you've done a recent virus scan and it caught something, this could be a leftover.  I take it you just click the OK button and your system runs right after that?<br>  <br>  This could also have happened if you deleted part of an Adobe product by hand rather than with the Remove Program applet.<br>  <br>  If so, you may be able to get rid of the phony message by going into msconfig and keeping the file from trying to start up.  Here's how:<br>  <br>  1. Click on the Start->Run menu item.<br>  2. In the Run text box, type in msconfig, then press Enter.<br>  3. In MsConfig, click the Startup tab.<br>  4. See if there's an entry for that filename.  If there is, clear the checkbox next to its name.<br>  5. Click OK.<br>  6. Accept the reboot option.<br>  <br>  Hopefully, the message won't come up on the next reboot.  You will, however, get a message about your configuration having changed.  In fact, if you just click OK, you'll get this message after every reboot, however, if you click the checkbox before clicking OK, the message won't come up again unless and until you make another msconfig change.<br>  <br>  Good luck.
NObydQT1aa	The current version of Ghost should do the job. I use True Image, which is pretty much the same. It will create an image of the drive on an external drive or discs and it will also create a boot disc. So if the hard drive goes belly up, I boot from the disc, which starts TI, and then restore the image.<br>  <br>  And in between the image can be mounted as a different drive so individual files can be rescued. Very good stuff.

T7Apky52aa	Well the obvious answer is either the p2p networks or Bit Torrent, but why not look around for an open source alternative? This site <a href="http://ccmixter.org/thread/679" rel="nofollow">http://ccmixter.org/thread/679</a> has a list of free alternatives that might work out for you.

QTlOYHUhaa	Who told you computers are more intelligent? A computer is as smart as a very sophisticated rock. Computers can't predict(anticipate), can't reason. Actually the only thing a computer CAN do is follow instructions. Thats it|`|4d3Ie5lCaa	A computer is as smart as the person who programmed it, that's it.

Just because I have the entire Smithsonian Library on my hard drive doesn't make me smarter,.|`|XW4pa8Pzaa	LMAO, computers are not intelligent at all, they do what the programmer tells them to do in a program. They are programmed. They don't think. They decide based on the given information, that decision is taken because of what ever code the program has. If you program the computer to lose a chess game, it will. It's just that every trick known to man is put in that code what makes the computer win, so it's using the human intelligence to win. If someone made a move that the computer don't recognize it will just freeze or give an error message because it simply can't think. Even the error message is programmed, the computer don't generate it. A computer will always respond the same way, there's nothing random, even when you use the computer to generate random numbers it's not random. However, it's possible that computers actually one day be capable of thinking.|`|228115feff68c6df0e7117fed3f5e01caa	LAMO you make the computer seem like its Skynet from Terminator or Aria from Eagle Eye, Computers are just machines who take orders, they can't do anything without us.<br>  I would like to see a computer move its mouse without a human, being there|`|SzsrajV4aa	Wasn't it a person that invented a computer?<br>  <br>  A computer is merely a sped process of human information.|`|AA10556691	Computers are faster and more consistent in their calculations than humans are....not smarter.

You can also set it to keeps searching for new tracks in that folder.|`|IfzSyw6naa	Well if you're using Limewire I hope that you have very good antivirus and spyware programmes installed. And you might also consider hiding your IP address as well. Downloading music from Limewire is not only illegal, but any files that you do download are likely to contain viruses or spyware. And your ISP knows what sites you visit and what you download. So be very careful. Why not just use a legal download site for your music instead of stealing it?|`|oVouqY6iaa	Great website and it's easy to use.

Linksys is the brand name of some commonly used wireless devices, and the reason you see it everywhere is because people don't configure them properly (i.e. they don't secure them, but just plug them in and start using them).

The wires are called cat5 cables, or network cables.
SFSBj5F1aa	I would recommend C# because it's based on C/C++ syntax.  It makes you have to remember less when you have to dig into other similar languages (i.e. javascript, actionscript, java, etc.)<br>  <br>  I have programmed in both languages, and also had experience translating from one language to anothr.  In my experience, VB.Net will serve the exact same purpose as C# with a comparable line count; in fact, since they use the same CLR, the two languages can be translated almost line by line.<br>  <br>  One of the things that make VB.Net "unclean" compared to C# is the syntax used to access array elements.<br>  <br>  C#<br>  myArrayVariable[myIndex];<br>  <br>  VB.Net<br>  myArrayVariable(myIndex)<br>  <br>  although the difference is just the type of bracket used, where it gets confusing is both languages use the () to indicate function calls<br>  <br>  MySubProcedure(myParamenter)<br>  <br>  so beside the capitalization and variable naming standard, which can vary greatly between programmers, there's no way to differentiate between a function call and an array element access in VB.Net without having to find their definitions.|`|Irdj2KAFaa	For 12 years I was a hard core VB6 evangelist who basically had to migrate to C# due to work constraints. I can honestly say that I am glad I did. It's painful for me to even consider to have to revisit old VB code to fix bugs. <br>  <br>  For me, and I'm sure many others, once you understand the syntactical changes (which are few) of C# compared to VB.NET, you'll never look back. I wouldn't be surprised if VB really does die (as M$ has suggested in the past).<br>  <br>  From what little code I did have to write for a project I was assigned using VB.NET, I came to realize that there are more lines of code required to accomplish simple instructions compared to C#.

fE7zhp3Caa	If you want to stick with Sony you can grab Sound Forge, a much more powerful audio editor.  If you're looking for something cheap or free, I'd recommend GoldWave (cheap at about $50 US) or Audacity (free).  I've been using GoldWave for the past 8 or 9 years, so I'm most familiar with its features and limitations.  It's shareware to begin with, so you can check it out before paying anything.  Nothing's disabled in the trial version; it gives you 180 operations per run before it starts nagging you every other operation.  You can save your work, reopen it, and you get a fresh set of 180 operations before the pestering starts again.<br>  <br>  Audacity is 100% free.  It's open-source, meaning it's developed by a world-wide community of programmers working on it in their spare time.

Irdj2KAFaa	In cryptography, encryption is the process of transforming information (referred to as plaintext) using an algorithm (called cipher) to make it unreadable to anyone except those possessing special knowledge, usually referred to as a key. The result of the process is encrypted information (in cryptography, referred to as ciphertext). In many contexts, the word encryption also implicitly refers to the reverse process, decryption (e.g. “software for encryption” can typically also perform decryption), to make the encrypted information readable again (i.e. to make it unencrypted).<br>  <br>  <br>  The concept of Decrypt:<br>  1. [A] generic term encompassing decode and decipher.<br>  <br>  2. To convert encrypted text into its equivalent plaintext by means of a cryptosystem. (This does not include solution by cryptanalysis.)|`|79FON9cCaa	Mixing up letters and numbers so it is unreadable from an outside party.  Encryption is a form of security, a lot of times you'll see this on a network stream when two computers are sending information back and forth.  It is important that outside parties can't see what the computers are talking about so they encrypt the packets.<br>  <br>  To encrypt a piece of information you usually start with an algorithm(a fancy word for a set of steps) on how to encrypt the information.  The sender and the receiver both need to know this algorithm or they won't be able to read the data.  The algorithm isn't just the only piece, there is also usually something called a key, which acts just like a door key, that both computers use to tell the algorithm HOW to encrypt/decrypt the information.|`|wPNtVytKaa	encryption is encrypting data so that it can not be read unless decrypted with a key.  most encryption / decryption uses a private / public key pair.

The idea is to redirect signal going the wrong way so that it goes the right way.<br>  <br>  If the antenna is vertical and the router is near an exterior wall, all the signal pointing towards the wall is wasted. You want to bounce that signal back the other way.<br>  <br>  You can try adjusting the router's antenna angle. You can try replacing the router's antenna(s) with higher gain antennas.<br>  <br>  And, of course, if needed you can place a wireless range extender somewhere between the modem and the PS3.<br>  <br>  Probably the best choice, IMO, is to get a new wireless router with very good range. Connect it to the existing modem/router wired. Place this router as close to the PS3 as possible, but even if it has to go really close to the modem, it will still help. Configure the new router for a different wireless channel and network, and configure the PS3 to use that network.<br>  <br>  Pick a new router with quality antennas. Perhaps you can place it a bit higher up or something.

Make sure you only choose use available disk space, not remove partition. I run Linux on my desktop. I run Windows and Linux dual boot on my laptop. However Linux is not user friendly when it comes to wireless connections because most chip set vendors will not release their chip codes to open source. It can be done by downloading files and compiling the files for wireless, but not an easy task for someone not familiar with the Linux Console Command environment. I would not recommend dual boot on a single hard drive if you have Vista, it throws fits every time you choose to boot Vista instead of Linux. It works great with XP though.|`|AA10256680	Yes.  A person can install a GNU/Linux distribution on a computer that has Microsoft Windows already installed.<br>  <br>  It's easier (for someone who has only used Microsoft Windows) to perform this feat if the computer has two individual hard drives (one of which is free to be repartitioned and formatted).<br>  <br>  However, it can be done on a computer that has a C: partition that has Microsoft Windows on it.  For a new user, I'd suggest going with a second hard drive, rather than trying to repartition a single hard drive with a single partition into multiple partitions.<br>  <br>  I'm sure that you can Google all about the set-up process for Ubuntu, including how to repartition a hard drive that has only one partition (most likely, C:).  I'm sure that the Ubuntu forums are full of information about this topic.

Most 64-bit processors support 32-bit natively, so they run as fast as a comparable 32-bit processor.  However, 32-bit games will generally run better on a 32-bit OS, since a 64-bit OS may be forced to emulate a 32-bit environment for programs that need it on a processor that can only use one at a time (although the speed difference is too small for us to notice most of the time).  Some processors, like AMD's Opteron server and workstation processors, can handle simultaneous 32-bit and 64-bit processing, meaning you can run 32-bit programs on a 64-bit OS without any emulation (and thus no loss of speed however unnoticeable it may be).<br>  <br>  You'll have to check the specs on games to see if they're coded for a 64-bit OS.  Most won't be, at least not yet.  As such, running 32-bit games on a 64-bit OS won't be any faster than running them on a 32-bit OS, and in some cases they'll run a teensy, tiny bit slower.<br>  <br>  Of course, the big advantage to using a 64-bit OS is the higher maximum addressable memory, so you can max out your board's RAM and install a big, honking video card (or 2 or 3 or 4, depending on your set up), and not cut into your available system memory.|`|azaMkJijaa	Nah.

CO6RyQlkaa	Administering an Oracle/SAP system, and maximizing the performance of its database, is a formidable job. You need to fully understand how both the SAP and Oracle systems work in isolation, and you need to know how they work together. In subsequent chapters of this book, I'll describe the specifics of that interaction. You'll learn how to use the special Oracle/SAP utilities, how to deal with the limitations of conventional Oracle functions, and how to place and reorganize files. Furthermore, after reading this book, you'll know more about monitoring databases during operation, tuning them, running backup and recovery, and performing special operations for systems that use parallel technologies or that support unusually large databases. <br>  This chapter presents the fundamentals of the SAP architecture and describes how Oracle fits into the SAP runtime system. It also explains fundamental Oracle/SAP concepts -- the client/server model, special Oracle/SAP naming conventions, administrator roles, and basic administrative operations. First, though, let's take a step back and look at what SAP is. <br>  <br>  <br>  Introduction to SAP <br>  The SAP system is a collection of software that performs standard business functions for corporations. The system has become very popular because it provides a complete solution to standard business requirements such as manufacturing, accounting, financial management, and human resources. It incorporates the concepts of enterprise resource planning (ERP) and business process reengineering (BPR) into an integrated solution for business applications. <br>  <br>  SAP is a product developed and marketed by the German company SAP AG. SAP is a German acronym for "Systemanalyse und Programmentwicklung," which can be loosely translated into "Systems and Application Products." Founded in 1972 by IBM application developers, SAP AG originally developed application products for the European marketplace. For nearly two decades, the company grew slowly. Early versions of its software were mainframe-based and appealed particularly to very large European corporations. Within the United States, sales were mainly to the Fortune 500. <br>  <br>  <br>  SAP's R/3 System <br>  During the 1990s, companies of all sizes began to embrace the concept of ERP systems and to gravitate toward prewritten business applications. With the introduction of its client/server SAP R/3 system in 1992, SAP AG, which already had a sizeable lead in the ERP market, unveiled a system that was attractive to medium- and small-sized companies as well as to the large companies already using SAP software. The SAP R/3 system runs on virtually any hardware/software platform and can use many different database management systems. One SAP system might be based on an IBM AS/400 running OS/400 using DB2; another might be based on a Sun Solaris (a dialect of Unix) using the Oracle RDBMS; still another might be based on an IBM PC running Windows NT using SQL Server. While SAP can be run with many different database products, nearly 85% of SAP customers now choose Oracle because of its dominance in the database marketplace. SAP software has become very popular in the U.S., and the company is now the world's leading application package vendor. SAP competes directly with Oracle Applications products and PeopleSoft products in the ERP marketplace. <br>  <br>  The SAP R/3 code is written in an interpretive language called ABAP. (ABAP is a German acronym that, loosely translated, means "Advanced Business Application Programming.") ABAP is very similar to COBOL in its syntax. Use of the ABAP language allows SAP customers to extend the functionality of the base product, as described in the next section. <br>  <br>  <br>  SAP Application Products <br>  The SAP R/3 application offers end users the ability to run their entire business from a single application vendor. Some SAP customers choose to run their entire enterprise from SAP, while others run SAP only for specific business processes, such as manufacturing or finance. SAP is designed to allow customers to choose their own set of business functions, and it is sold in many configurations--both as specific business functions and as enterprise-wide solutions. <br>  <br>  An SAP customer can choose whatever applications meet his site's specific business requirements. In addition, the customer is free to customize his SAP installation, adding new database entities as well as new functionality. For example, a company may use an inventory method that is nonstandard but essential to the company's efficiency; the basic SAP functionality can be modified to accommodate the specific requirements of that inventory method. The result of all of this flexibility is that virtually every SAP installation has its own specific configuration and set of functions. However, there are costs associated with customizing SAP. An organization that makes thousands of customizations to its SAP application may find itself spending millions of dollars to upgrade SAP: when SAP is upgraded, ever

GaMkfG6Iaa	Your file recovery program did not find any extra space. It searched your existing or other hard drive and found that you have 55.57 GBs of data that can be recovered. That would be files that have been previously deleted or lost in some way. You can restore and delete them again with no detriment, but recovery programs usually require you to recover those files to a second harddrive or partition, not the source drive/partition.

Usually one VGA(Standard) and one DVI or two DVI. You can buy adapters for DVI to VGA if needed. Once they are connected, it is the software drivers that change the operation of each device. The two standard modes for multiple monitors is Dual-View (Shares desktop by stretching it to the other monitor) or Clone (Does what it says, clones your standard desktop to the second monitor).<br>  <br>  With SLi, you can have up to 4 monitors at one time, two to each card, running independently with their own work space.

It's simpler than DHCP, and DHCP is actually based in part on BootP.<br>  <br>  So when a client starts to boot, it knows it's own MAC address because this address is burned into it's network interface card.  This is the clients physical, or hardware address.  But know it needs an IP address, so it sends a BootP request, a BootP server sees the requests, checks the MAC address of the request, and looks the MAC address up in a table.  In the table there are MAC address / IP address pairs.  Once the BootP server finds the right MAC address it takes the matching IP address and replies to the clients BootP request.

A daily pulpit. A collaborative space. A political soapbox. A breaking-news outlet. A collection of links. Your own private thoughts. Memos to the world. <br>  <br>  Your blog is whatever you want it to be. There are millions of them, in all shapes and sizes, and there are no real rules. <br>  <br>  In simple terms, a blog is a web site, where you write stuff on an ongoing basis. New stuff shows up at the top, so your visitors can read what's new. Then they comment on it or link to it or email you. Or not. <br>  <br>  Since Blogger was launched, almost five years ago, blogs have reshaped the web, impacted politics, shaken up journalism, and enabled millions of people to have a voice and connect with others. <br>  <br>  And we're pretty sure the whole deal is just getting started.

Often a carefully chosen data structure will allow the most efficient algorithm to be used. The choice of the data structure often begins from the choice of an abstract data structure. A well-designed data structure allows a variety of critical operations to be performed, using as few resources, both execution time and memory space, as possible. Data structures are implemented using the data types, references and operations on them provided by a programming language.<br>  <br>  Different kinds of data structures are suited to different kinds of applications, and some are highly specialized to certain tasks. For example, B-trees are particularly well-suited for implementation of databases, while routing tables rely on networks of machines to function.<br>  <br>  Since data structures are so crucial to professional programs, many of them enjoy extensive support in standard libraries of modern programming languages and environments, such as C++'s Standard Template Library, the Java API, and the Microsoft .NET Framework.<br>  <br>  So Data structures are building blocks of every programming language .|`|9FTEv7Whaa	Data structures allow you to be creative in the way that you make your computer programs.  It is funner to use data structures than to just use a bunch of singular arrays and variables.|`|AA11462926	Algorithms (programs) operate on data- if the data is not homogenous (e.g. a mix of letters and numbers) or you have a large amount of identical data then it is a good idea to somehow group this data.

Some of these crashes are mild and can easily be overcome simply by closing a nonresponding application or by rebooting the system. However, others are more serious and can bring the entire system to its knees. Microsoft calls these types of crashes "Stop errors" because the operating system stops responding. When a Stop error occurs, the GUI is replaced by a DOS-like blue screen with a cryptic error message followed by a code number. This screen is affectionately referred to as the Blue Screen Of Death, or BSOD for short.<br>  <br>  Dissecting a BSOD<br>  Although Stop errors can be caused by both hardware or software malfunctions, the most typical cause is a hardware malfunction. Each Stop error is accompanied by a specific error description and an eight-digit hexadecimal number error code. It may not be immediately apparent when you see a BSOD (mostly due to the shock factor that hits you when a BSOD occurs), but you can use the descrption and code to identify the type of error that is occuring. You just need to be able to identify the key parts of the message so you'll have a direction and focus for your troubleshooting expedition. The trick is in finding the relevant information on the BSODAt the top of the Windows XP BSOD, you'll find the error description, which will be in all uppercase letters with multiple words tied together with underscore characters. In the following BSOD excerpt, the text <br>  A problem has been detected and Windows has been shut down to prevent damage to your computer.<br>  <br>  If this is the first time you've seen this error screen restart your computer. If this screen appears again, follow these steps:<br>  <br>  Check to make sure any new hardware or software is properly installed. If this is a new installation, ask your hardware or software manufacturer for any Windows updates you might need.<br>  <br>  If problems continue, disable or remove any newly installed hardware or software. Disable BIOS memory options such as caching or shadowing. If you need to use Safe Mode to remove or disable components, restart your computer, press F8 to select Advanced Startup Options, and then select Safe Mode.<br>  <br>  can u plzzz? let me know code next time i can tell you what program it is thanx you hope that help full|`|QMGOn0lzaa	Oh no,  sounds like the blue screen of death! When ever you get a blue screen saying that it usually means something is very wrong. Sometimes it can be corrected, other times not.  You might have to reinstall your windows.

I, personally experienced a total hard drive failure using a 3rd-person's .deb.<br>  <br>  A .deb is "built". We download the source code, run a ./configure most of the time. Running configure sniffs your available libraries and makes connections (Symbolic Links) with the new code. Therein lies the majority of the problems while installing.<br>  <br>  Your short answer will come from your particular distro Forums or from SecondLife. More and more, I see software offerings with only the source code, and you build it. Binaries, pre-built stuff, seem to be fading because there is no dominate, majority distro. Finally, a botched install can screw up your updates database. Look around for the command and/or procedure that does something like: apt-get -r database ... which will re-sychronize your repositories with your installed software base.

SkpRC2Nmaa	You'll need to upload all images, HTML files and other stuff that you used to build your site at the web server.<br>  <br>  Also check all paths to images and other files and make sure that they are correct at the web server because many people forget to change it and don't see images on a production server.
5MpA0ahqaa	A quick one here, though a proper answer will need more research:<br>  <br>  to protect your server room from fire you need to have smoke detectors installed (many types could be used but the best might be the optical detectors), linked to a panel and sierens that will warn people that there is smoke in the room in such a case. Also could be linked to a fire supression system using FM200 gas or similar, that can help put out the fire with no damage to equipment from the gas itself.<br>  <br>  Regarding the part for the maximum temperature, normally with a typical setup if temperature in the server room goes over 40 - 45 C your servers automatically shutdown to protect the hardware and the data. I am not sure of this but i assume that if temperatures go fairly beyond this range you might start suffering from possible equipment damages and data loss even if the servers are not operational because hard disks media for example might tend to expand and turn out completely unrecoverable. If you are housing some expensive equipment as well as data, and you are in in area where the risk of fires is high, then also having your equipment put in a fireproof vault (room) might be considerable. Hope this was helpful.

o3xOyfLdaa	Your graphics card will fit, but cant tell from image of the power supply if it has the plug required for most graphics cards that are high end. Judging from the specs, the answer here is probably not. meaning you cant use the card even if it fits together which it will.<br>  <br>  Second, this will not support a SATA type drive. Since this is the current standard, I recommend getting a board  / Power supply that does. <br>  <br>  The CD /DVD Drive will fit as well<br>  <br>  The ram will fit, however I would recommend spending a little extra and going with the fastest ram it will handle. Otherwise you are wasting money if you are planning on upgrading. Judging from the specs, that would be an 800MHz, not 677. The difference will be noticeable, and this allows it to carry to your next board if you upgrade later where the 677 is too slow to be worth it in a new computer.<br>  <br>  If you are not gonna game with the computer, it is adequate. If you are, you may as well custom build, and look at a different computer. This is not a decent gaming computer. It will be too slow.<br>  <br>  Also, you don't need 4 GB of ram in this machine, I have 1.5GB of RAM and have never used it all with a bigger processor than what you would have. If you are planning on upgrading to a duo core or Core 2 duo, then upgrade. <br>  <br>  Also, if this processor isn't a 64 bit processor, and the operating system isn't a 64 bit operating system, then you are throwing away money.

Easy to use, very efficient.|`|97513408e68930abf4e64bf4d8335b1faa	I bought a MacBook and I am loving it.  Even if you've never used Apple computers before, I still highly recommend it.  Just a few of the many benefits of MacBooks: fewer viruses than PC laptops, good compatibility (Leopard, which comes free on all new Macs, has parallel drivers built in so you can run any PC programs you want), ease of use, and good customer service!  The only downside is cost.<br>  <br>  My customer service story: my hard drive crashed last year due to an overheated dorm room (I left it on the heater; the heat came on when it was already 85 degrees outside because my school is stupid about temperature and such) and I just brought it to the Apple store and I had it back, like new, the next day, for free.  <br>  <br>  Apple customer service, when compared to that of HP and Dell, is VASTLY superior.  Those are the only other two brands I have personal experience with... both had phone reps who didn't speak English and both refused to help me with my problems, telling me I must not be doing what they suggested (In the case of the HP, we finally ended up taking it to a computer guy who was like "yeah those people don't know what they're doing")<br>  <br>  I have also heard good things about Toshiba, though I can't speak for their customer service.  <br>  (And, if you care, the HP computer is amazing now that we paid a professional to fix it.)  <br>  Dell laptops break often (I have three friends with Dell... all three of whom have needed repairs at least once and they take forever to fix them at the Dell repair shop!!!) so even though they tend to be cheaper, I would avoid them!!!<br>  And finally, regarding the Macbook Air: I would avoid it.  The Air lacks a CD-ROM drive, so you would be unable to burn CD's and such.  Apparently it "hijacks" the drive of other computers on the network, but I looked into it and decided I wasn't comfortable with not having that drive.|`|AA10281397	Want easy, simple interface, no virus/spyware then a mac is for you.<br>  Want complicated but every software is built on today for windows then get a pc.<br>  <br>  Dell, toshiba, lenovo etc|`|uraqDegqaa	macbook air  or whatever. the really thin one thats .16 inches at the thinnest point|`|U5mNY5OHaa	I would stick with a Dell or IBM/Lenovo. Unless you're going to be studying within a field that requires a lot of intensive programs such as engineering, graphics, movie production, photo editing, etc, just about anything will do. You'll want it to last so get at least 3GB of RAM. Any system you buy today will have enough computing power for the internet, MS Office, etc. I deal with a lot of used systems and Dells and IBMs seem to hold their value. That means there is a demand for them even though they aren't new. HP/Compaq seem to lose their value and show up on the market as used/broken. When I used to sell computers, HP/Compaq would have a lot of returns. Sony Vaio laptops are good too, but they seem overpriced and lose their value too much.|`|pCxFcrVIaa	MacBook!!!!

If you're using a Mac, you might want to get someone else to answer your question.<br>  <br>  If you want to make sure your video card is compatible with your computer, you have to look at what bus type is on your motherboard (the bus is the little slot on the board the video card plugs in to). The two most common video card bus types are AGP and PCI Express (PCI-e).<br>  <br>  The way to tell them apart is by the notch. Somewhere along the slot, there will be a notch separating the bus slot. On AGP buses, the slot is more toward the back. On PCI-e, the notch is more toward the front. If you find this bit confusing, here's pictures of the two bus types:<br>  <br>  AGP: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:AGP_slot.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:AGP_sl...</a><br>  PCI-e: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:PCI-Express-Bus.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:PCI-Ex...</a><br>  <br>  As you can see, the PCI-e bus is also a little bit longer than the AGP.<br>  <br>  RAM is a little trickier, since they (mostly) all use the same bus type. Each RAM stick has a certain speed (or bandwidth), and you have to make sure the bandwidth of the RAM you get is supported by the motherboard (or it either won't work, or will lead to very bizarre computer behavior). If you don't know what RAM speed your current RAM is, you can download CPU-Z (<a href="http://www.cpuid.com/cpuz.php)," rel="nofollow">http://www.cpuid.com/cpuz.php),</a> open it, go to the SPD tab, and look for where it says "Max Bandwidth". This is the speed of your RAM. Buy RAM of the same speed to ensure compatibility.<br>  <br>  Hope that helps.

See how much space you are using right now, and add a hundred gigabytes. That should be good for you.

Yp0LoHOnaa	If you put your e-mail address in a standard anchor tag link, prepare to get bombarded with junk mail as there are e-mail harvesters out there picking up e-mail addresses out of HTML files and adding them to spam lists.<br>  <br>  I recommend that you use a form mail script that disguises your e-mail address and offers more security. This will be a simple form which you can customize using HTML to fit your needs. People can use this form to contact you by filling it out and clicking submit, which will send an e-mail to the address you specify in the configuration wizard. If you want to see a working sample, you can look at the one on my website Contact page at <a href="http://www.discwritecd.com/contact.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.discwritecd.com/contact.htm</a><br>  <br>  You can download a free one at <a href="http://www.tectite.com/wizards/fmconf.php" rel="nofollow">http://www.tectite.com/wizards/fmconf.ph...</a><br>  <br>  That link takes you to the coniguration wizard where you can configure the PHP form for your website and download the files you need. There is a readme.txt file that has the installation and testing information. It only takes a few minutes to set up and you can customize it to only allow one or two hyperlinks in a submission which will cut out most of the spam submissions.<br>  <br>  Your web server will need to be running PHP, which isn't usually a problem as most web servers have PHP available.

KNppmXiXaa	I can't access the site while at work but for calculating the cost, figure that the system will at most be worth about 60% of what you paid for it if it was a high end system.  Given the ever advancing PC technology, any low to moderate system will probably be worth about 40% of what you paid for it.  Similar to most other purchases, the resale price drops pretty dramatically.<br>  <br>  ** Edit **<br>  While building an equivalent system may take $850, your system isn't new and doesn't come with a Dell warranty/support.  You are also competing with other used computers as well as new computers.  People shopping for a used system also expect to get a better deal, otherwise they would just buy a new system.

On the Border tab, look at the bottom-right "Color" drop-down box... is it set to White?  Change it to Automatic (or black) and click OK.  That should display the borders.

IbxhRebgaa	Your router has virtually nothing to do with your speed. An Airport Extreme Base extends the range of your wireless signal; it doesn't change your line speed. In fact, nothing changes your line speed short of changing your line itself. <br>  <br>  Yes, you should forward your port properly. Open the port in your firewall. It sounds like you're using OS X to me, so that would mean you must open it in the firewall via System Preferences.<br>  <br>  Find your router on the list here:<br>  <a href="http://portforward.com" rel="nofollow">http://portforward.com</a><br>  <br>  Follow the instructions (now with pictures!) to forward the port in your router. <br>  <br>  Of course, your download speed is limited by the maximum downstream of your line as well as the upstream of the peers you are connected to. If all else fails, ask for a reseed.<br>  <br>  EDIT: Forgot one bit.<br>  <br>  No, no single client is faster than any other. The only thing that a client can do that will *seem* to make your downloads go faster would be to do what Xunlei does; it increases the maximum number of half open TCP connections that your OS allows.

XJSOToRGaa	You dont HAVE to, but it's generally a good idea, just as it's generally a good idea to perform regular backups, regardless of installing updates.    Think about it this way.  If you lost everything on your computer, just how upset would you be?  Upset enough to warrant driving to the store and buying an external hd or dvd/cds and backing up your data instead?  Generally speaking, I'd rather do a 'just in case' backup and find I didnt have to, than losing all my data and wishing I had...    But no, you dont HAVE to backup and it's unlikely you'd lose your data.  But if there's even a 1% chance, is it worth the risk?|`|BZdUHUbPaa	Nah, in my experience (5 years system administration), I've never had an issue. Its just a precaution.|`|eWMn7dhKaa	No, it is not required for updating your computer.  The backup statement is to protect the company (Microsoft) from any potential problems (lawsuits) when you have lost something due to trying to update your computer.    Backups are a good thing to have, because you never know when a hard drive will just up and die on you.|`|2d3ab98f216743c75f2f200fa734cb7caa	you do not need to back up anything -- these updates are to provide your computer with better programs and help your computer operate safely. It is best to close all open programs and allow the updates to work alone. If some parts of the WinXP need to be replaced that function will be done automatically and this is a normal thing to other programs that may also need updates.... but a backup is a good thing and you should do that on some 60 or 90 day basis...

elgVgRCRaa	That is pretty simple. The operating system will be fine. Just plug the old drive in as a second drive (set jumper to slave). Install Vista and copy the files over. It shouldn't be too much of a hassle at all. The files have no preference in drive size or bits.    If you want your programs transferred along with files and everything then you are SOL. Vista is different than XP. You could by a migration assistant but it is better to reinstall everything so the OS runs smoothly.|`|Pj2EqQbDaa	yes, and it is totally safe and secure. there is a File and settings transfer wizard in the accessories menu on vista. jest get a Crossover cable, connect the two computers and do the transfer. it is better this way so yo don't have to have the hassle of putting what to where.     Also, DirectX10 shouldn't be the only thing that you like on Vista either, or else the $ that you spent on Vista would be a waste, in my opinion.|`|p6xgtONXaa	Hi,    I doubt you would want to transfer ALL the data from xp to vista?    I can understand wanting to transfer things like bookmarks, documents etc.    Programs will need re-installing under Vista anyway.    The easiest way is to put both drives into the new pc.    Arnak

A1ARpuJbaa	As long as your disc, ( a cd or dvd which you can get from any high st. or online computer shops),  or stick, (a usb device which you can also get anywhere), is recognised on your computer, if it's a website you're after, save it in 'favorites', right click the site, then click on 'send to' and it should save to your stick or disk.    Another way is to save it offline so you can read it whenever without being connected to the internet using the same add to 'favorites' method except this time you select the 'make available offline' section.    To print it out you'd need a printer. You'd have to go somewhere where there is a computer connected to a printer such as a friend or a library. Once your disc or stick is loaded up, right click the file on it and click 'print'.    I hope I understood your question correctly and that this helps.|`|Mctjf6Zcaa	Hi Delta,    You can use a tool like cutepdf which allows you to print anything (you're permitted to print) to a pdf file.

Select the newly installed printer, and click Print.  4. Choose a location and filename to save your 'printed' pdf file - and it's done!|`|MB9Xw5ZCaa	The Best way if you are on a game help website like Cheat planet is to click the print view button on the page (Most of these sites have one somewhere) when that opens click on the page and press Ctrl and A then Ctrl and C, then open up MSWord or Notepad and press Ctrl and V, then click File > Save > Find The USB Key > Type Name > Save..

2d1281aa57d4a1706e1d2a23da968188aa	There's never any guarantee trying to move an installed OS, it's a crapshoot since the BIOSes may see the drive quite differently.  However...    For generic machines with retail windows, USUALLY you can transfer the drive, initially boot from the windows CD to perform a repair install, then reactivate Windows using your existing product key.    If you're dealing with a brand-name system like Dell, Compaq, HP etc- the factory installed operating system won't work on a different motherboard.  If you're lucky enough to have system restore CDs, those can't peform a repair anyway. You'd need to install a new operating system.|`|F2XxqlVfaa	it depends on if it was factory installed windows (OEM) or if you purchased windows (retail) from a retailer. OEM can only be used on the computer it was initially installed on. retail you can install on a different computer but tranfer would be questionable due to drivers and etc... if its retail best bet is to copy the old hard drive to the new one, and then see if it boots and works properly, if not a resh install will be needed or severe configuring|`|AVDTZ63Oaa	You'll need to tell Microsoft about it again, but you can slap your old HDD in as the master drive. Not everything is going to work straight up. You'll need to run the driver disk for your new gear, but there is no need to wipe windoz and start over. You WILL get the registration wizard again, since your hardware changed "Significantly"|`|K0yLiawSaa	Yea, the only problem with trying to use hard drives with different hardware settings after you have already used it on one piece of hardware is the drivers, which usually don't match, and may not always work.    The best bet, in my opinion, is to try and copy the data from the drive to a safe place so that you don't lose anything. This will help if you try to use the same drive and will prevent data loss.    However, now that I think about it... You should just be able to insert the CD for the new hardware and just install it before Windows loads... Not 100% on that though.|`|YVXuLLKVaa	If you have the ability to re-install all of your apps, I would suggest starting with a new drive and put your old drive as D:  Do a fresh install.  You will lose your profile; browser, email settings, and desktop.  Its possible to export your profile before the move and then import it after a clean install.  Repair may not catch all the hardware changes you will have.  Your XP CD may not allow you to do an "upgrade".  You may be required to do a fresh install.

A computer's VGA port does NOT put out a digital DVI signal, which is why you can't use that pass-through adapter to connect a computer VGA-out to a monitor DVI-in.  If you try to use the adapter that way, you will get no signal.    The only way to get your computer to work with that monitor's DVI port is if you have a video card with a DVI output.

b81H0vlYaa	As long as you don't sync it.  You can copy the songs from your ipod back to you computer.  They won't be in mp3 format, but a file only recognized by your ipod.  This would be a good thing to do, let's say, in case you droped your ipod in the toilet!    There are a few different ways to do this.  I am not going to write it all out, but you can search for it.  Don't buy any software, as this is not necessary    Here is one example:  http://www.ilounge.com/index.php/article...     Or if you know what you are doing, when your ipod is connected, go onto your ipod files (you must have your hidden files visable) and find the .txt files from each song, copy them to your computer and import them into itunes.    Don't forget to check your recycle bin first.|`|yKJSvdHCaa	No, but open iTunes first, and make sure it doesn't auto sync your ipod.  And download this to take the songs and movies off your ipod, and back to your computer.  It's called iDump  http://www.download.com/iDump/3000-2169_...|`|c0WJ42iSaa	If you connect it to your PC, and iTunes is still installed, it will come up and ask you if you want to sync your iPod with the iTunes library (which now has no songs in it). If you answer Yes, it will delete all of the music on your iPod. So click No! :)    CNET has a good tutorial explaining how to get the music back off your iPod here:http://www.cnet.com/transfer-ipod-songs/ and there are also numerous free programs to do so, though I've never used any of them, so I cannot vouch for their reliability/ease of use.    Best of luck!|`|BxkBXsocaa	open itunes & uncheck "sync ipod when connected" before you plug it in, then copy songs from ipod to computer, otherwise your songs will be lost when it auto-sync.  you can enable your ipod to be used as a hard-drive too, it's a good idea to backup your ipod's stuff & put them into folders so that you can copy them back onto your computer.|`|4MYWPD9Yaa	It depends on what your iTunes settings are.    If you have iTunes set up to automatically sync your iPod to your computer (the default setting), then your songs will all be erased when you connect your iPod.    Go into Edit > Preferences and change that setting. Then you can safely connect your iPod.    Once you've done that, show hidden files in Finder or Explorer, and copy all your music from the iPod back to your hard drive.|`|nxtIhb4Oaa	You may take a look at step by step guide, it will teach you how to copy music and video from iPod back to computer, then you can backup your iPod songs at first, it's easy to understand and works pretty well for me.  http://www.freedvdripper.net/how-to-tran...

GlHHz1ehaa	Your question is a little confusing so I will provide a few answers I think you are looking for. <br>  <br>  Add a playlist in iTunes by going to File--> New Playlist.<br>  <br>  You can drag and drop items from previous playlists into your new one. You can also drag songs from your Music folder to your playlists. <br>  <br>  If you delete a playlist, the song still remains in your iTunes library. It is just not located in the specific playlist folder. It is still located in the Music folder. Think as all of the files in playlist folders as copies of the original. The original is always kept in the Music folder. The only way to delete the song from iTunes and all playlists is to delete the file from your computer/hard drive or by deleting it from the Music folder.

vL2Ec50Yaa	You do have a problem there and the answer is not a short one.  I will be back with you in a few minutes...<br>  <br>  OK, at this point it may be too late to be able to remove all the viruses & spyware, but go ahead and try it anyways. If you don't succeed in removing all the unwanted files and get your computer running normal, the last step would be to reformat the drive and reinstall the Operating System.  You may be able to borrow a disk from someone who has the same computer and the same O/S, but you must install your O/S serial key.<br>  <br>  Now, I suggest that you remove your drive, attach it to another computer and run the programs from there. I would start of by running 'superantivirus' (free download) - run the programs specifically on that attached drive.<br>  <br>  Once you have finished running those programs, put the hard drive back in your computer and download 'hijackthis' and run that to create the output file. This is a great program for techs to use and remove problems with, but it is not a program for a novice to 'use'. You can cause serious problems with your operating system if you remove the wrong thing.<br>  You can get help with this output to understand what lines to remove by providing the output to several different websites, but if you contact me via my email, I would be happy to look at it for you and send you a file back explaining what needs to be deleted.<br>  I am:   gikstar@yahoo.com<br>  <br>  Hope this helps....|`|GxXpvNIwaa	Many times I have stared at my computer thinking "How do I fix my pc because it keeps crashing?"<br>  Unfortunately there is no simple answer! I used to think this problem was related to buying cheap computers but after buying various laptops and desktops at different price ranges there is one common theme, eventually they will all crash at some stage! <br>  Friends will often think I am a pc expert and will call me asking "How do I fix my pc when it keeps crashing?" Well start by asking yourself these questions...<br>  Have your children be on the pc? Kids are great at downloading spyware by mistake! They will also click on numerous pop up pages and will often change your settings!<br>  Another possible reason your pc keeps crashing is that you have overloaded it! If your pc only has 64mb RAM memory and you install graphic, gaming and other software the chances are that your system will not be able to cope with your software! Most PC's now come with at least 512mb RAM so it is worth upgrading if your pc is not at this level.<br>  However the most common reason that your pc keeps crashing is that it has a virus! Many trojan virus can cause your computer to reboot immediately once all programs have been launched, this can drive you mad and it is not fun as you are helpless!<br>  Best option is to install anti virus software and make sure you only visit trusted websites. If all else fails it is time to reformat your hard drive and wipe your pc clean, this can take hours and you will probably need the data recovery disc that you should have got when you bought the pc.<br>  Recommend tool:  <a href="http://toptenantispywareviews.com" rel="nofollow">http://toptenantispywareviews.com</a> [if you do not have one]|`|DF6asJPLaa	look for a program called ad-aware, it is by Lavasoft, it is a spyware removal tool, also look for S.T.I.N.G.E.R. it is a virus removal tool|`|1ge64wdRaa	You might want to do a free bug scan here <a href="http://budurl.com/frzk" rel="nofollow">http://budurl.com/frzk</a>
2F5XkiHLaa	SmartRAM is a part of Advanced SystemCare, a program made by IObit. I got it from Download.com. ASC has many features. I've had it for a few days & have been playing with it, haven't mastered it yet because there's so many parts to it. But the SmartRAM feature seems to do a good job. It 'manages' the memory (RAM) to free up as much as possible so that you have more memory available to perform tasks when you need it. When you let the computer idle for a few moments, it releases memory, rather than having to restart the computer to free the memory. If I can find a way to run just SmartRAM & not the whole ASC program, it will be awesome.<br>  <br>  There's more info in the IObit forums: <a href="http://forums.iobit.com/showthread.php?t=743" rel="nofollow">http://forums.iobit.com/showthread.php?t...</a><br>  .

E0chY1b5aa	Any of them that are better than your motherboard sound.  Some new M/B's come 5.1'd.    First link is for a cheap one but of course has an equalizer.  The second link is one that I'm looking at because I have the X540 in now but have a 7.1 Home Theater in the next room.    Seems like I saw the 2nd one on-sale at Best-Buy this week.|`|U9QTcTvFaa	I suggest to use Creative's X-FI series Sound Card. I have the new Creative SB sound card. I am using this to connect my computer to my receiver. I'm using a HDMI cable for video and TOSLINK from this card for audio. I get excellent surround sound from DVDs that I watch this way. For more information, check this store, http://www.mdofpc.com/onlinestore/index....|`|c0WJ42iSaa	If you think you need a dedicated sound card, check out the Soundblaster Audigy SE http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.as... It supports 7.1 channel surround sound and 24-bit quality, and it's super cheap at $33-35.    That said, most new (2006+) desktop computers come with at least 5.1 surround sound built-in to the motherboard, and adding a different sound card to do the same thing that your computer is already doing now will not change the amount of bass you're hearing in a meaningful way.    You're better off messing with the equalizer settings in the software that you're using - if you're just playing music, iTunes and WinAmp both offer excellent equalizers with a Bass Boost setting.    Best of luck!
kyI4JI5eaa	First, you need to invest in Virgin Media's 50MB connection for the best results in the UK. Then you need any Intel dual-core processor @ 2.2 GHz or above, any AMD dual-core @ 2.8GHz or above, any Intel quad-core, or any AMD quad-core. Wait for Windows 7 in summer. Also make sure you have all the recommended parts elsewhere and you're sorted.

Although the following refers to music downloads, the principle is the same    The dangers of Limewire and what has happened to my family   ______________________________________...  Not sure how many of you are aware of Limewire that kids are using to download free music on their computers. I knew very little and still don't know all that much but it is a terrible thing to have on your computer and I want to get the word out as to what happened to us. First off, Limewire is a computer program you can download for free. This program allows you to download free songs that are illegal. It is a file sharing program which means if you have limewire and someone else has limewire, those two people can share their songs (or whatever else they download) from one computer to the next. With this being said, I knew my DD had limewire on her computer but had no idea what else you can do with this program. Come to find out, you can download ANYTHING from this Limewire, as in X-rated photos, child porn, videos ...etc.    A week ago we were woke up with 10 FBI men, 1 FBI woman and 1 sherriff banging on our door at 6 am. They had their FBI vests on, wore guns, etc. I answered the door and they asked me who was in the house, etc. They woke my DH and 2 teenagers up and we were told they had a search warrant. They had reason to believe we had someone in our house who had downloaded "something" illegal on one of our computers. We were all in shock, it felt like something out of a bad movie. They searched our house for 2 hours and they took all of our computers to investigate. I pray they don't find anything. DH and both kids have said they have done nothing wrong, I have not either. We have consulted an attorney and now we wait.    I tell you all this to educate others to get limewire off your computers. Its not worth all this for free songs ...
Pj2EqQbDaa	check to see if there is any cartridge inside, first. usually it will not work if there is no ink. also check the connections and to see if there is no errors. usually there is no problem with the printer afterwards.     if you are doing a manual clean, then use a slightly damp cloth that is clean and wipe the lens and don't touch the drum that is inside because it can get very hot. it is advised to take it to a pro who knows how to do it because there may be some parts that can only be cleaned or replaced by a pro.
FbjRnvdAaa	this is a very common task for a beginner programmer. Unfortunately many beginners do not seem to understand the question.    First, know that binary, decimal, octal, hexadecimal, and others are simply representations of values. The value of 123 (decimal) still has the same value if it represented in hexadecimal (7B), octal (173), or binary (1111011). So the first thing to know is that you are not converting a binary value to a decimal value.    What is the question then? You are likely being asked to convert the text representation of a value from binary notation into a value. So it is a conversion of text to an integral value.    Like each digit in 123 has place value (1 is in the hundreds place, 2 is in the tens place, and 3 is in the units place), each bit in a binary number has place value as well. Starting from the least significant bit, each next significant bit has twice the place value.    Okay, here's some code:    unsigned int bTod(const char *bit)  {  unsigned int value = 0;  while ( *bit != NULL ) /* loop through all of the text representation */  {  value *= 2; /* double the previous result */  value += *bit - '0'; /* add current bit (0 or 1 from '0' or '1') */  ++bit; /* go on to the next bit */  }  return value;  }    this converts any binary number to a decimal, no matter how many bits it has. so this is more general than what you want.|`|WS95be3Raa	Ok... good for you. And what is the question?
L9ichpB7aa	If you're just starting out (or even if you're fairly advanced with this) I would suggest going and having a look at Synthasite.com.They offer free hosting without ads and offer easily the most superior free website builder out there.You start off by using free sub-domains with them and then, when you need to,you buy domains for your sites and continue with the free hosting.    Many other services offer free hosting but almost all of them crowd you out with advertising and extremely cramped development options.    Try Synthasite - you'll thank me!|`|Cxtdh5qYaa	Yes, there is.   Look at http://www.papatiger.com.     They are one of best domain registrars and hosting company.

For multiple domain names registration check the "bulk registration": http://www.papatiger.com/domain-names-bu...|`|2LbTrlQnaa	As I don't know your age (teen or adult) it is hard to advise you because buying and maintaining multiple domain names is not something to enter into lightly.

If youre going to buy domain names, http://www.goldpuma.com  is the lowest cost service which is full-featured and really works for you ($9.99 /year).

If you are going to create your website: 1- Buy a domain name. To get a domain name, you have to pay an annual fee to a registrar for the right to use that name. 2- Buy a web hosting service to provide your online space and enable you to get your website online at your purchased domain name.    If you want to start your website I recommend purchase your domain and hosting together. In this way it is possible to get your domain for free. Some hosting services offer this gift today.

If you don't mind that unwanted ads are on your web site then don't go with lunarpages.  It is $4.95 per month and you can add unlimited domain names. It's a hosting company I've been with for 3 years. I'm a web developer for my own business and after weeks of research and talking to customer reps I finally decided on lunarpages. I'm happy and the customers I've created web sites for are happy with lunarpages service.

uQTtwuT7aa	Depending on the version of Dreamweaver you have, it may have a built in FTP system. After you buy your domain, you can input the log-in information into Dreamweaver and use the built in facility.    There are many free and paid FTP programs for download on the web. You can search Google for a program, look at reviews, and find one you want. There should also be tutorials and guides on how to use the various programs.    There are also websites that offer this service so that you don't have to install a program on your computer. Depending on the service, you can upload web pages from your hard drive or edit the HTML in your browser.|`|3nXO9cM8aa	Yup, as you said, either you have to buy a hosting plan, or you can find some free hosts around the internet. After that, the host will give you the neccessery information about how to upload your page. It might be web-filemanager, or ftp. Always remember that the very first filename that a webserver can read is index (for example index.html, index.htm, index.php etc). Domain is the name of url that you buy for your website. If you don't want one, you can just use the ip that you will be provided.|`|rpSP0qrQaa	You need a domain pointing to some hosting.  You then transfer the files to the hosting, usually via FTP.|`|KPKgF4zzaa	All the files ftp must put on ftp folder and that' it.|`|7QFU0sAOaa	Yes, you'll need a domain.

SJM0rzHtaa	Fellow Bravia owner here.  I got a 52" Sony Bravia LCD HDTV and it works beautifully with my computer, also using a DVI-to-HDMI cable.    On some of the higher-end Bravia LCD HDTVs, there are picture settings menus where you can choose presets optimized for photos and text (which I have on my 52" Bravia).  That's all I had to do to make my computer display look nice on it.  If yours doesn't, you will have to play around with the contrast and sharpness settings.    Also, make sure you are using your Bravia's native resolution and refresh rate.    Good luck, and I hope you enjoy your Bravia as much as I do mine.|`|G68l0Zviaa	1. Go onto your desktop  2.

There is also the question of the rules and laws you are breaking by trying to hack your school security system.

The user will always be "admin" the password can be one of three things: "admin" , "password" , or left blank.<br>  4) Once in, you should see something that says "Wireless Security", click on it.<br>  5) Once in Wireless Security, you should see options to set up a password, use WPA-PSK, which is the hardest to crack. You should also see an option to bind your MAC Address to the wireless connection.

The grammar check doesn't allow for certain rules of language that are acceptable.  And spell check doesn't check the sentence around a word, so even if you put the wrong word in (such as "their" instead of "there" or "four" rather than "for") it won't catch it.

MPldgkkMaa	Everyone knows that Windows computers can sometimes slow down over time. While not an exhaustive list of solutions to problems, this collection presents some ways to speed up a computer.<br>  <br>  1. De-Fragmenting<br>  Over time, the data on your hard drive gets scattered. Defragmenting your hard drive puts your data back into sequential order, making it easier for Windows to access it. As a result, the performance of your computer will improve.<br>   a) Right click of C Disk.<br>   b) Click properties.<br>   c) Click tools tab.<br>   d) Click "Defragment now".<br>   e) Click Defragment.<br>  <br>  2. Uninstall Unneeded Programs<br>  Removing programs that you no longer use can free up space on your computer and speed up your system's performance. However, you need to uninstall the programs properly to see much improvement; deleting them is not enough.<br>  <br>  3. Stop Programs from starting on Windows boot<br>  One way you can speed up your computer is to prevent programs from launching themselves at start-up. Not only do the unwanted programs delay the start of Windows, they also continue to slow down your computer since they use system resources.<br>   a) Open your Start menu.<br>   b) Click Run<br>   c) In the command screen type "msconfig.exe"<br>   d) In the "system configuration utility", click either "service" or "startup" tab<br>   e) Uncheck all programs that you are no longer using.<br>   f) Click "OK"<br>  <br>  4. Check for Spyware and Adware<br>  Spyware is software that allows companies to monitor what websites you visit or even access your computer. Adware is software that displays advertisements. Both use system resources and slow your computer down. Detecting and removing the programs will improve system performance.<br>  Get the best one from: <a href="http://toptenantispywareviews.com" rel="nofollow">http://toptenantispywareviews.com</a> to scan your pc<br>  <br>  5.

Keywords (like 'return') are always in lower case.<br>  <br>  And<br>  <br>  cout<<"The Gross box profit is"Gross Box Profit""endl;<br>  <br>  should be something like this<br>  <br>  cout<< "The Gross box profit is" << GrossBoxProfit << endl;|`|ww6nm7gfaa	What the guy before me said is correct. Also, by convention, variables start with lower case letters.<br>  <br>  And, just for your own sanity, I strongly recommend starting with a very basic framework, then slowly adding onto it, and checking to make sure it compiles.<br>  <br>  Try starting with a hello world program, then add your varialbe declarations, and check that it compiles. If it doesn't, then you know where the problem is. Then input a variable, check that it compiles and runs. Output the variable, make sure it does what you expect. Etc. The point is that you have errors upon errors, how can you ever expect to debug something when you don't understand it, and you have errors that are nested within others. You need something that is basic, and only one thing can possibly be wrong with it. Test as you go, for every new thing you add, test that it works. When something doesn't, then you know the problem lies in the thing that you just added.<br>  <br>  As is, you have written the entire program without testing, you have errors in the first _and_ last lines of your main function. Take it one step at a time, know where your problems are, if they arise. Test as you go. Before you start adding new code, ensure that the code you already have works correctly. As the Christians might put it, don't build your house on the sand.
