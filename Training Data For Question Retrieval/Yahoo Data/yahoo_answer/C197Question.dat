20090308091527AA7nTsd	Pregnancy & Parenting;Newborn & Baby	Baby not drinking bottles well....?	My daughter is almost 8 months old. We introduced solids to her when she was 4-5 months and ruled out allergies on most common baby foods and she also drinks 6 ounces per bottle during the day. My problem is that lately at day care while she naps, she, in her sleep, starts to scream and cry (and I do mean scream, I work at the day care in the room next door to hers) . She does this in her sleep and stiffens her body. It sounds like she is in pain. So I figure maybe the formula we give her is giving her bad gas pains. So I switched her to Gentlease Lipil by Enfamil. Now, she won't drink more than 2-3 ounces a bottle. She's eating the same and the screaming has stopped, but I'm worried about her not getting enough to drink. I've tried mixing some of her old formula with the gentlease but it didn't help much because when she drank the mixture, the screaming started again. What do you guys suggest on how to get her to drink more? I'm going to call her doctor as soon as the office opens in the morning but I wanted to know if any of you moms or dads went through this or know of a similar situation and have some ideas of what to do.    Thanks!

20090308091718AAIRrK5	Pregnancy & Parenting;Parenting	Parents:-How would you feel about this or anyone in same situation?	My daughter is 17mnths and when she was born i was determined for my family and my hubbys family to be involved. I knew my family always would be but i thought i would have to work a little harder with my hubbys family. They live really close and for the 1st 2wks of her life they came to my house a few times to visit. I would walk to there house (about a 20min walk) in all weathers so they could see her but after the 1st 2wks they never came back to visit. They never text or asked about her. I continued to go to there house even though when i was there they would question my parenting, compare her to her cousin whose 11wks older and i would feel really uncomfortable, they didnt play with toys etc they would just sit n pass her around and argue about who would hold her next they didnt seem to want to be involved. Also i cant express my feelings and how i wish for them to care for my child..when i have they dont respect my wishes so i will never leave her with them as i dont trust them. In them 6mnths they had only been to my house 3times (baring in mind that they go to there other 2 daughters (who have a child each) house more than once a wk and we all live close). So i decided that i would only go to there house if i needed to which would be very little. I was sick of trying and getting nothing back..In my daughters 17mnths of life they have been to visit her 8times and when they come they dont get involved like play with her toys etc they sit on the couch and talk to me n my hubby and only stay for 15-30mins and even still they compare her to her cousin which does my head in and question my ways of bringing her up. At 1st i was bothered and it upset me that they didnt try but now i dont want them to be involved as i feel they have made there choices.They only want to be involved when it suits them, She doesnt even know who they are and i feel even more uncomfortable with them. There daughter is also due a baby next week and my 2 sister in laws already have that there 3 children are favorite and keeps saying they cant wait to spoil the new baby etc but they never did any of this with my daughter. Would you feel upset..well i dont feel upset i actually feel hate 2wards them as ive past the upset and caring stage.As far as im concerned my daughter has me and her daddy and my family (who do visit often) and she has all the love in the world.She dont need them and its them thats missing out...Anyone in similar situatuions..Share your storys Thanks.

When I figured out what she was saying, my heart dropped into my stomach.    Her dad is in the hospital, he tried to kill himself. He slammed a bottle of Everclear and took a bottle of some kind of pills...Liz, who is 16, her little sister Elle, who's 13 and her mom found him inside the open front door, surrounded in puke. Her mom is pissed, Elle is scared and really upset, and Liz is confused. I don't know what to tell her besides the obvious "it will all be alright, we're praying for you guys"   Her parents are going through divorce, so he shouldn't have even been there.

20090308092612AAq5zRs	Pregnancy & Parenting;Adolescent	My son is almost 15 years old and he's about my height, 5'9. My wife is 5'3. How tall will my son be?	There have been taller people in our family. Like 6 foot. And my son has grown much faster than I would have expected. I was measured my current height of 5'9 at about 19 years old, and I was much shorter than my son at his age. And plus, he's among the tallest of his class, and in general, he's like a full-grown man. Is he one of those people who grow different from all predictions, like ones based on parent's height, and get to being quite tall as adults?

20090308093429AAixOMy	Pregnancy & Parenting;Parenting	How to teach a kid with a bad attitude to change?	I know a kid (not mine, my bf's brother) who is 9 and has a horrible attitude. He isnt necessarily a MEAN kid, he has the want to make friends and have fun, but he has a horrible attitude, especially when it comes to adults telling him to behave. His teacher gave his mom a letter telling her that he was the worst behaved child in class, and when he is home, it doesnt get any better. He talks back..... A LOT. He throws tantrums if things dont go his way (not violent ones, he just kinda crosses his arms, whines loudly, and fiddles with things). If you tell him not to do something, he'll do it anyway, especially to spite you.  He always wants to play with me, and im kinda too old and tired for the things he wants to do. He will beg me to play hide and go seek, and tag or bicycle and I cant because I just DO NOT have the energy for it and if I say no, he will whine and whine and pull and tug at my arms and call me names like stupid and such. UGH. I cant stand being at their house sometimes because of him. But, he still has a nice side sometimes. He just has a HORRIBLE attitude, and no matter what you tell him he doesnt care. If you tell him he is behaving badly, he will not believe you and whine to you about how you need to shut up and how youre stupid :| Yeaaahhhhh. His parents dont spank him though, could that be a problem? I also notice his dad spoils him a bit by buying him games, fast food, and snacks and treats... but im not sure if thats the problem because my parents were like that to me and I never acted that way :/      ANYWAY, what can the parents do? Also, what can -I- do, since im there often? Should I start ignoring him? I dont want to yell at hime, cuz he isnt my kid and I dont want to upset the parents. But sometimes, I just want to scream at him to leave me alone D': He follows me and my bf every where, and that would be ok if he behaved himself, but he doesnt! ):       Advice? Tips? Ideas? Any kind of help?!

20090308093332AAV92zf	Pregnancy & Parenting;Trying to Conceive	How can I get my doctor to take me seriously about endometriosis?	I am young, 17 to be percise.    I've exhibited a detailed history of dehabilitating periods since the time I was 11.    I've been experiencing immobilizing pain & just about every other classic symptom of the disease since I first began menstruating.   I've tried just about every brand of birth control pills which I can't handle because they make me sick throughout the month,   but I'm constantly in a state of severe pain and I want treatment.   My gynecologist's answer to everything seems to be hormonal contraceptives so I'm going to my family physician to try and get a referral to a specialist in a larger city.       My question is,   what can I do to make my family doctor take me seriously about my illness?   What should I say to be more convincing?   I'm not very good with doctors, any help or advice would be greatly appreciated.   Thank you.      My ultimate goal is to have a laparoscopy performed.

Which I know isn't uncommon for that age but she has almost been kicked out of school over her not listening & hitting. She goes between two homes so its got to be difficult for her but recently she has been lying to her dad about me yelling at her or she'll say I hit her & sometimes I wasn't even home when it happened Im not sure what to do with her older sister whos 8 we used soap in her mouth like ours parents did instead of spanking.

20090308093539AAqYFxz	Pregnancy & Parenting;Pregnancy	Is this overkill pregnancy protection?	So, last night I had sex with this girl.    It was a spur of the moment thing and we where not really thinking straight.    Long story short, I didn't wear a condom and I THINK I "arrived" in side her.   She told me she was on birth control and it would be fine, but... well... since it was the first time I had had sex, I became SUPER paranoid.    She said, said if I wanted we could go to the drug store and get that Plan B stuff, so we did, and she took the first one with in 4 hours of our sexual encounter.    NOW   I know there is guarantee that she didn't get pregnant.    But are these actions over kill?    Like, is birth control and plan B taking the whole thing a little too far?    How will I/she know if anything bad has happened?    Should I be as scared as I am?
20090308093837AAjurVh	Pregnancy & Parenting;Trying to Conceive	10 or 13DPO! 1 Day of Old Brownish Red blood followed by light. Any ideas? Period or Implantation Bleeding?	On Cycle Days 19-20 I had a bit of Ovulation Spotting (very light spotting followed by cramps so I knew I was ovulating). Don't know if I Ovulated before on Day 18 of after on Day 21.      I woke up yesterday to a normal day with no bleeding at all.      Roughly in the mid afternoon, I checked my underwear and noticed some old brownish-red (more on the brown side). I was going to put on a pad, but decided against it.      When I next went to the bathroom, it wasn't in my underwear and was there only when I wiped...it's was light pink (almost like when I spot) and less than before      Next time I checked about 1-2 hours later, it was even less than they previous time and lighter pink.      At night, I checked and it was all gone, there was no spotting, bleeding, or old blood at all. I took a HPT at night just to check and it was NEG.      This morning I checked my underwear and when I wiped and again there was NO BLOOD NOR SPOTTING.      Any advice on what you think could be happening.      Thanks in advance

20090308095437AAvO5mF	Pregnancy & Parenting;Parenting	How would you handle this? Relationships with ex inlaws getting bad? Sorry it's long..?	So I'm no longer with my ex, haven't been for nearly 3 years. (Since pregnancy) However, I've still been a part of his family for 8 years. They've always welcomed me and our daughter with open arms. We socialized regularly with and without him. He and I will still go to family events with our child together, etc.      Well, the ex has been campaigning lately to get back together. He still hasn't addressed his issues and wants me to pay all the bills. I'm not interested in such a relationship and told him so.      Throughout our drama, I've never bad mouthed him to his family, they've sought me out and told me I was doing the right thing by NOT being with him and am a fabulous mom.      Well...lately, I'm getting weird vibes from them, like I'm not welcome. In fact I haven't been invited to any of the family things, and was just uninvited to an outing last night. He told me they weren't going out and I went out and saw them...Also I saw a text from his sister (who i'm friends with) who said she'd come and pick him and my daughter up to go see their parents...The last 3 asthma attacks she's had have been caused by their family. They don't understand her asthma and think i'm overprotective, so I don't allow her to see them without me (many smokers)      Her dad though is still after me to be an active part of his family even though I KNOW he's talking badly about me to them. What can he say? He doesn't do ANYTHING for his daughter and I let him see her whenever he wants?!?      Oh and while I was at the ER with her yesterday, he was with them, telling them about it...      How do I deal with the breakdown of relationships? How do I deal with them when I see them with her father? I'm in such an ugly place, it hurts to see how a group of people can turn on you when you've been one of the family for nearly a decade. Any advice?

I have two 6 year old girls, a 4 year old boy, and a 3 month old girl.       We want one more baby, and because our two current youngest have a biggish age gap, we want the next baby to be close in age to our youngest.       We want to start trying for a baby around now. It took us 18 months to conceive the twins, and a year to conceive the other two. So it might take us a while to conceive this next one, but we are not ruling out the fact that we may conceive staight away. This would mean having two kids a year apart.    Is this that difficult?      I am 31 and my body healed about 5 weeks after the last baby, and I have been sexually active again from about 7 weeks post-birth. After 3 months now I feel totally healed and feel ready for pregnancy.

20090308094826AACnO5m	Pregnancy & Parenting;Parenting	What should i do, please help?	I have 2 boys. Ages 6 and 2. I am 14 weeks pregnant with another baby. The thing is, My twin sister ( we're 29)is the total opposite of me. She drinks,does drugs, she uses guys for sex, you get the point. Well she has a 9 year old boy. He's a great kid, well-behaved, he's very intelligent. Every week she's with a new guy. His father was a great man, but my sister blew him off. He was very attached to his father, everyone was. He was the nicest man i've ever come across. I can tell it's hard for him. He was slacking off in school, and he started being a hard-to-handle 9 year old. My sister called me last night and asked me if i would take him and keep him because she'd rather be with her boyfriend ( Trust me, their relationship will be over next week.)   I knew something like this would happen. We're on a tight budget and i'd love to take him- but, it's going to be hard. When me & her were teens,she was the don't do homework/ skips school type of kid. I was the nerd, but i had a lot of friends and she didn't because she scared people away. I sternly told her I'd love to take him, but because of Tyler & Ryan ( My kids) and the next baby on the way, it's going to be hard. She said she'll leave him with her ex's mother who's..i'd rather not say, but she's a drunk. I know for a fact my husband would love to add a newbie to the family since my husband & her son are like best friends. I am going to take him once i get rights to. Her son is over right now eating lunch & playing with my boys, and he looks so happy compared to how he was. He's a very thin 60 pounds because she does not have any food in her "house''. She lives in a 1 room apartment that's very dirty. I am only doing this for the sake of her child-not for her. I just want to know- how should i handle it towards her? thanks

20090308100249AAN4Uzs	Pregnancy & Parenting;Adolescent	Is this strange or just teenage hormones?	I am 17 years old, I've never kissed anyone.  I really really want to kiss a girl.  I am single right now so I can't really do that, but is it strange that I just keep thinking about it or is it just natural teenage hormones?  I know, I'm 17 and I haven't kissed a girl yet, pretty pathetic, but I am a shy kid.

Young I guess is below 17      I personally would say the only way they're staying in my damn house is if they leave school, find full time work and pay for the kid alone on their own income. No way would I pay for a baby because of my child's mistakes.

20090308095648AAabmUN	Pregnancy & Parenting;Adoption	Animal Adoption Protection Laws?	Are there any laws protecting people adopting animals?      Story Below      My friend adopted a dog from a local pound. They told her that he was de-wormed, up to date on his shots and heart worm negative. She noticed over the course of a week that he coughed, sneezed and gagged alot so she took him to the vet. They said that he had kennel cough. He hadn't been around any other animals in that short time so we knew it had come from the shelter. She brought the dog to my house where I have my own. He pottied on the floor and we noticed a worm in poop. To make sure we checked when he went to the bathroom later. Again we found a worm. She has a 9 month old daughter that was always touching the dog and he had been around my dog that whole night and day. We knew nothing about the disease and feared for both my dog and her baby. We asked advice and were told to take the dog to the pound and drop him off. He had a microchip so they were able to locate her and now are issuing her a citation for abandoment. The reason we took him was because she had already paid for his treatment of the kennel cough. and couldn't afford to get him treated for something else. At this point he hadn't had his vaccines or tests done because she had spent all of the money put aside for those treatments. We wanted the dog to have a chance and could think of nothing else but to give him back and hope someone could help him. She is now facing $4,000 fine and 1 to 2 years in jail. We had no other choice, she has a baby. In the contract she signed it said that they do not guaruntee a healthy animal. When she signed they gave her a brief summary of the contract and never mentioned that. I am a witness to the gentleman sayin he was up to date and that all he needed was his rabies. We never got paperwork. There has to be a law out there protecting people from these shelters adopting out sick dogs or cats. I feel so bad for these poor animals and even worse for any animals they may come in contact with once rehomed. If they don't tell you there is no guarantee how are you supposed to know? We asked the questions we believed were necessary, is he sick? are his shots up to date? Heart worm? But they never said anything. I think it should be against the law for these shelters to give out animals without checking them for sicknesses. It makes things worse for not only these families but the animals they may expose these diseases to. Please someone help I don't want to see her go to jail because she tried to help this dog, she has a baby..

My son broke his leg jumping off of a jungle-gym. He wore his cast a little over two weeks. It came off about 2 1/2 days ago. He is still refusing to put any weight on it and is crawling everywhere. Sometimes he says it hurts when he tries to walk and sometimes he says he doesn't know how to walk. It was x-rayed and the Dr. said it looked fine. The Dr. also talked like he would be walking that first day with assistance. I was wondering if anyone else had this experience and what did they do.

20090308101122AAecFyP	Pregnancy & Parenting;Baby Names	Need help naming a baby girl !?	Okay, so the story is with my son we had the middle name chosen (after the father). We had a list of names when we went to the hospital but ended up not liking ANY of them. We finally settled on a name the day we were discharged from the hospital because when we read it aloud to our little boy he turned and looked at us and cooed. So his name is Preston James.    However, we're clueless on a name for his little sister coming in May. We want LEE in it somewhere, but not standing alone. An example is something like Hailee or Kimberlee. We would like a middle name that starts with "J" but it's not necessary. (All of our middle names begin with J). So does anyone have any suggestions to begin our list this time around ?   Thanks for your help ! It's much appreciated !!!! :o)
20090308105010AAxAaHQ	Pregnancy & Parenting;Newborn & Baby	Any mommies so excites to feed your baby solids, only to...?	find out it's not really all that it's cracked up to be, after the first few times.  I couldn't wait to feed y daughter baby food, I thought it would be so much fun.  Even when my mom told me it wouldn't be as much fun as I thought, I didn't believe her.      I just started to give my 5 month old cereal, and it's more of a chore, then fun, that's for sure.  First, I was having to try to fit bites in between her putting her thumb, or bib in her mouth.  Now she has just gotten into really doing raspberry's, and decided it's even funner with a mouth full of food.  She opens her mouth nice and big for a bite, and so sooner then I put it in there, is she rasberrying it back out at me, LOL!        I hope this isn't bad to say, but I'm starting to miss the days of just bottles.  I can't imagine doing this 3 times a day!      So were you guys disappointed, when it actually came time to feeding your little ones.
20090308104453AAJclvL	Pregnancy & Parenting;Parenting	What games do you play with your children?	Our 4yo girl and I play a lot of games. Some of our favourites:   - Brain Juice - a brain-developing cellphone game, we play a competition   - Backgammon - she loves that game   - Sudoku and Kakuro - these are the smart games, haha   - Dolls - she is usually the mother   - Ball - we love playing ball when we're in the park   - Need for Speed - on the computer, we have a competition race   - Belote - she is actually good at it now that she knows the rules   - Hot and Cold - I hide an object somewhere and she has to seek it and the closer she is to the object, the warmer/hotter I say she is to finding it   - Words - I say a letter from the alphabet and she has to name fruits, vegetables, countries, animals, objects, etc. starting with that letter   - Investigations - I hide a small present (chocolate, new crayons, etc.) somewhere and I leave her a note with a riddle. If she solves the riddle, it directs her to the place where there is another note with another riddle and so on until after the 5th-6th note directs her to the present. The riddles are simple (she is 4yo) - "The-only-yellow-fruit-in-the-fridge's first two letters start a word that ends with "room". Go there :-)" and she goes to the fridge and sees the onyl yellow fruits are bananas. She takes "ba" adds "room" and makes some word - "bathroom" (the only possible for a room in the house). She goes to the bathroom and sees a bigger note with some other directions. And so on :-)) That was just an example.      What games do you play with your children?

20090308104006AAB8oHf	Pregnancy & Parenting;Newborn & Baby	I know it sounds crazy... but my 4 month old may be a little too spoiled...?	Since the beginning of time (his time), he was able to just lay in his crib and hang out and watch his mobile while I'm cleaning, doing laundry, whatever the case may be . However, NOW there's no such thing. He'll either lay there for 5 minutes then start to fuss and eventually cry or he'll start to cry as soon as you put him down . I try to put him in his high chair with some toys, he cries. I put him in his bouncer, he cries. I put him in his bumbo baby chair, he cries . As much as I'd like to be super mom and hold him while I'm doing everything, I can't... there's no way . And I don't want to get him used to that . So I know they say there's no spoiling a baby before 6 months, but I definately think we may have spoiled him by holding too much. How can I get him out of this because I can't anything done if no one else is home! I have to rush to the bathroom before he notices ! Lol ! I've heard the "let him cry" method but I would just feel so bad. How do I get him out of this ! please help.      no smart a$$ comments either, I can do without them .   thanxx :)

20090308104745AA6smE9	Pregnancy & Parenting;Newborn & Baby	Could this be teething?	My daughter is three months old and is normally a wonderful baby.  She fusses and cries very little.  Last night we were coming home from the store and she started fussing and what I assumed was from hunger.  When I went to feed her she drank her bottle but the fussing continued.  She was very cranky and hard to soothe, over the last few days she has had her hand in her mouth, which she usually does anyways, but I have noticed that she tried to get more of it in there and it's more constant hand in her mouth.  We feed her and  lately we have had to hold her hand out of the way to get the bottle in and sometimes the bottle is crooked because she puts her hand right back to her mouth.  Anyways, I gave her some Tylenol last night and she slept all night.  This morning she woke up, ate her bottle and we played and talked and she was fine for awhile and then the fussiness and crankiness started again and she was even harder to soothe this time.  She would only nap for a short time and the crying is louder than normal almost like she doesn't feel well.  No temp,. I gave her some Tylenol after this and gave her a little bit of Anbesol on her gums and she is sleeping and has been for over an hour.  This is our first and even though she is three months I think she may be teething, I thought I would see what you ladies thought since you have some experience.      It's Sunday or I would call her Pedi.      thank you so much!

20090306223335AAvKiBL	Pregnancy & Parenting;Newborn & Baby	Five month old suddenly changed her own sleep schedule - growth spurt or sick?	In the last three weeks, my daughter has had her first bad diaper rash, her first cold, her first fever and now has a cough (pretty sure she is teething as well).  She's been well for a few days in between each.  After her bout with the fever but before the cough, she suddenly started falling asleep at 8 pm instead of 9:30 - 11:00.  She has done it three nights in a row.  She is still sleeping the same amount (usually about 10 hours), but she is also taking more naps during the day (from two hours total to four).      Has anyone else's baby suddenly changed their schedule so consistently?  Do you think it's because she is sick/teething or does this sound like another growth spurt?  I'm hoping it's not a growth spurt, because she is five months one week, around 19-20 lbs and wearing mostly 9-12 month clothing already!

There doesn't seem to be any consistency at all -- sometimes I'll get the feeling once, sometimes it will come and go for a bit. I wouldn't describe it as painful but it's not very comfortable!

20090306224318AALZlPQ	Pregnancy & Parenting;Newborn & Baby	How do you afford your kids?	Let me start off by saying I am by no means trying to judge anyone, I am just curious. (I'm 19 , and have a son, clearly I am not in much of a position to judge!)      Now, I am in contact with a woman who has 3 children, while she is 20 years old (she had her first at 15)      I'm just curious, seeing from my personal experience that ONE child, at my age group, while both my partner and I have jobs, is quite financially draining.   My job pays alright per hour for my age group (nothing spectacular though!) , I just don't work full time, as I have my son in the day, and work at night when my partner gets home.      He does not earn a lot, as he is an apprentice.      So, to my question, If you are a young mother, and have multiple children, how do you afford your kids?   How do you have the time for them, if you work so hard to afford them?!      As I said, my one son is quite a handful, although I love him to death, I just sometimes feel guilty, because I know we should have been a little more prepared for him, so sometimes I feel like we are disadvantaging him.      How do you afford multiple children, being so young?!

My question is this: Do you think with domestic abuse being such an issue, she should have walked away from him with her head held up high setting a good example for all the teenage girls that are her fans?? Do you think her staying with him is giving mixed signals to all of the fans out there right now saying it is ok to be abused??

I recently added Regina to my namelist, and she has gotten a surprising amount of negative feedback.      Firstly, I was wondering what your general feelings about Regina were.  Why do you or don't you like her?      Further, I currently have her as a middle name for Niamh, which has garnered the least amount of votes for the girls on my list.  But, on my previous list, I had Niamh with Magdalene, which had the highest rating of any name on my list!  This is so confusing to me.        So, what would you pair with Regina other than Niamh?  I only like Regina as a middle name - mainly because I don't like the nickname Gina.  Do you prefer her as a first or a middle?      On a scale of 1-10, what would you rate Regina?   Also, the following is a list of comparable names.  Will you please organize them by how much you personally like each?  This should be very interesting to me!

20090306224053AAWkMrn	Pregnancy & Parenting;Adolescent	Pretend you have a 14 year old brother/sister and...?	He/She is talking about having sex with their gf/bf.       He/she...isn't great at managing money, gets frustrated when have to feed the 2 dogs (which maybe will be asked of to do at night...maybe.. so not even every night)... he/she doesn't have no job or source of income, can't drive (no permit even) and has no car... and thinks talking about sex with older sibling is awkward.      I'm in this situation. I've tried talking with him and told him that he should be comfortable talking about sex with anyone. That shows maturity. I've told him his relationship probably won't even last, and throw in sex and it'll make it more complicated and it'll hurt like helllll to break up and he'll beat himself up about it. He's kinda clingy.      I understand that this is when they start getting more crazy about wanting to have sex, but I know he isn't ready emotionally or especially financially. I want to talk with him to get him not just to hear me, but to LISTEN to the facts about what it can do if you have sex.      I'm not hating on those who have sex at this age, and I'm not weird, I had those feelings too (I hardly talk to the guy I wanted to with), but I didn't do it because of the risks and I knew I couldn't afford to risk it.       If he had sex and they had a kid, he wouldn't be able to afford college, his phone, a car (let alone make payments on it), child support and all the necessary things for a baby.       I know I can't make up his mind for him, but I want to educate him on what he's gonna get himself into. I know people who've regretted it and I don't want him to be on that long list. I just want to help him understand that it's okay to wait. That he shouldn't just give into urges to please himself or to prove his love (that's what he's doing). I believe he's one of those who believes sex = love and love = sex. Which isn't the case.       Argh, sorry this is long. I'm just kinda torn. He's my "baby brother" yeah i know he's not a baby, and i aint treating him like one, but I don't want him hurt which will happen if he convinces her to have sex with him.      He'd asked her if she loved him and she said "i think so." and he asked if she was in love with him and she said "i dont know..." He's used to getting his way since he is the youngest in our family.      Any advice?

20090306231706AASfJSD	Pregnancy & Parenting;Parenting	What can I do about this problem? (not a bf/gf drama ?)?	My daughters classmate bit her today for hmm lets say the millionth time! This little girl is literally a 5 year old bully. My daughter doesn't even want to go to school anymore because of this little girl. I've talked to the teacher and the school principle numerous times but they always say the same thing "sorry, we will contact her mother" or "sorry, there is nothing we can really do but keep a close eye on her and see that she doesn't do it again". I tried changing my daughter from class but unfortunately their wasn't a class available for the track she goes to. I know that other parents have the same problem with this little girl hitting their children, but they don't want to do anything about it because I guess they're intimidated. (I live in a city in the Los Angeles county  which is populated mostly by mostly hispanics, the little girl is white, so I'm thinking some of these other parents are immigrants). Well like I said today this little girl bit my daughter, right under her eye. She bit her so hard my daughter even bled!! When I asked the teacher why she bit her she said "they both wanted the same book". Ugh. Well my question is      Have you gone through the same situation? If so, how did you resolve this issue?      Who else can I talk to besides the principle and the teacher? They obviously haven't done anything about it.      Should I just beat the heck out of this little girls mom for not teaching her daughter some manners? (j/k I wouldn't do that but seriously after seeing my daughters bite mark and blood on the bandage I really do want too and I think you would too)      Any suggestions will be appreciated.

20090306224310AAEtZIz	Pregnancy & Parenting;Pregnancy	I have this fear that I don't have the strength to get through this pregnancy...?	So it's been a rough pregnancy. First I had severe Hyperemesis Gravidarum (extreme morning sickness) that has put me off work, and really strained things between my husband and I. It's hard on him because he has to do everything, including taking care of our 19 month old son. He doesn't complain, and he tries hard, but I can tell he resents me. He doesn't get to go out much or do fun things, and works like a dog, non-stop. But about 18 weeks the HG started to clear up a little...just iin time for me to have a fall and tare 5 ligaments in my ankle...again sidelining me for a few weeks. Then this week, just as my ankle got better, I got the stomach flu, which was compounded by the HG because I couldn't keep my medications down. I still feel horrible, but as I was puking and being hooked to an IV, all I could think was that I didn't think I could get through this pregnancy. I mean, I still have just under halfway to go...and I am beat down. I just don't think I have the strength to get through a labour, and the post labour healing. Not to mention how worried I am about the toll it's taking on our relationship. I am supposed to be a partner, not a parasite...Has anyone ever questioned their ability to get through pregnancy? Any tips on how I can get through this??**just to clarify, this baby is SO wanted. We both feel it will complete our family. We were on fertility treatments to get pregnant, so neither of us are sad about the pregnancy. We both want this child A LOT.

As I pulled into my drive way and get out of the car, I hear screaming and some shouting for help!!! It was my next door neighbor's son coming from the house. I'm thinking something happened inside and turns out his parents left him inside the house while he was asleep. The boy thinks his parents abandoned him. After a while I had no choice but to call the police. When the police came out, the came home at the same time. Worried something happened. What pissed me off is when they admitted that they went to the store to pick up some dinner. Are freaking kidding me!!?? When the police heard that they contacted CPS and had the boy removed. It was a sad ending though. But it had to happen. Would you call the police if you was in the same situation??

Anyway, there is a notice on the board for babysitting. There's 2 local girls, both age 14 who are available for friday and saturday nights, and their phone number. They also claim to have experience in babysitting.      It's been ages since my hubby and I have been out alone and I was thinking maybe I should give the girls a call. (I noticed a few of the other mums took down the phone number). I can't help feeling funny about it though. I'm not sure if I should trust two 14 yr old strangers to babysit my kids.

Okay, here is a link to a story I found to be interesting:   “Woman answers ad for bird by offering kids as payment”          http://www.cnn.com/2009/CRIME/02/27/kids...       Now according to this story the alleged woman was taking care of the three children and because of her work situation couldn’t really provide for them. Anyway, she offered up two of the children to the alleged couple for the bird. Now the couple went along with this because they really wanted children. The biological parents of the children had no idea what went on. So my question is: Would it be right for a couple to do this just because they want kids so bad?      I’m not making this up here is a line from the article as to why the couple went along with this: “The children were well taken care of when they were with the Romeros, who badly wanted children, according to Dupre.”      I just want people's thoughts and opinions on these subject.

20090308103654AAJHtsn	Pregnancy & Parenting;Baby Names	Why is this one accepted as a girl's name?	Allison.      I personally love more boyish names for girls. I know that many don't and there have been many Yahoo questions about why people do it, etc. And people always say that they hate when people give girls names with -son in them because it implies that they are the son of someone (like: Madison, Addison, Emerson) but no one ever mentions Allison. And I've never heard it for a boy, so I was just wondering why you thought that there was a double standard for that name or if maybe there is something that I don't know about that name?      Thanks.
20090227110501AAYhSM3	Pregnancy & Parenting;Trying to Conceive	Using lube when not fertile?	my husband and I are TTC. I have heard that pre-seed is best to use when its harder to have sex. I have a hard time cause my walls are so tight and we havent had sex in 15 months since he was in iraq. but I told my husband I dont want him to spit on his cause itll kill the sperm so we have been doing it without any lube and just natural which is fine but I was wondering since we are only fertile before and during ovulation and thats when everyone thats TTC start having sex to make a baby..what about after ovulation time when we are not fertile can we use lube for just fun or do I have to go natural the whole TTC??

20090308092833AAVUT9a	Pregnancy & Parenting;Newborn & Baby	Went to Dr last week and?	she said it would be ok to start introducing whole milk into baby's diet. (btw hes 11 months). Since we started (mixed w. formula only in 1 bottle a day) he has had runny diaper since the day after we started. He had problems with regular formula until about 7-8 months and then switched to regular formula (with no problems). Does this mean that hes just not ready for milk yet or could it be some kind of milk allergy? Im going to call Dr on monday.
20090307005957AAg84Xw	Pregnancy & Parenting;Newborn & Baby	Any of you mommies know what the heck this is?	I've been asking around in the medical/health section but no one has been of any help.  I thought maybe I might get lucky and someone might have an idea as to what may be going on with me here.  (This is the section I usually hang out in anyway and I know how brilliant us mommas are!)  So here is my question...   What are these tiny white bumps on the right side of my throat/roof of mouth? (Pic Included)   WARNING:  You do not want to see this picture if you are squeamish.  It looks pretty gross!      Anyway, just today I started feeling like I had something stuck to the roof of my mouth, way in the back near my throat.  I wouldn't go away so eventually I got a flashlight and looked back there.  There are tiny white bumps all around the right side of the way back of the roof of my mouth, near my throat.  What the heck is this?  I have not had sex or any romantic encounters in over a year (I had a baby last April and I'm a single mom) so I don't think it could be an STD type of thing.  There is no pain or itching, it just feels a bit scratchy - like there is a piece of cracker stuck there.  Please help.  I need to know what this is.  I would go see the Dr. but I am a disabled vet and my only insurance is through the VA, which is closed on the weekends.  What is it?  What can I do to treat it this weekend?   Thanks so much in advance!    http://i329.photobucket.com/albums/l383/...        http://i329.photobucket.com/albums/l383/...        http://i329.photobucket.com/albums/l383/...        http://i329.photobucket.com/albums/l383/...

I have always been regular, but had a period on the 3rd december and didnt have another till 13th feb, The period was really light and there was NO pain tho normally i get alot of pain.

20090227105754AAjhOIl	Pregnancy & Parenting;Trying to Conceive	Lately i've been feeling off -- heartburn, sometimes little waves of nausea, and moody...really hormonal.?	i have had unprotexted sex this month, twice right before i ovulated (and yes, i can usually feel it when i ovulate because it kinda hurts). my period should've started around the 19th but it was only spotting ranging from pink to brown to red. i took a hpt on the 19th because it was stressing me out, as i had been feeling off (the symptoms listed above), but it came up negative. then my period seemed to actually start on the 24th in the afternoon, and it only lasted 2 days. I'm usually a solid 5-6 days kind of girl, and cramping was minimal which is odd for me. what gives? i'm still super moody (weepy at odd moments or quick to get annoyed), still have heartburn every day, etc. Any thoughts or idea?

20090227094017AAOoHFd	Pregnancy & Parenting;Trying to Conceive	What happened? miscarriage?	1. I have been to the doctors just waiting for results - wont get them for another week.   2. I know the symptoms could be a variety of things including: cervical cancer, some sort of tumour/lesion, or hormonal problems but this question is trying to rule out miscarriage.      story: I normally have a 34ish day cycle but in January it lasted 40 days. right before I expected to get my period (around day 32) I had unprotected sex (thinking I was far past ovulation date). I didn't end up getting my period till day 40 (a saturday). I had a normal menstruation lasting 4 days. The following saturday I had sex and had spotting (bright red) afterwards. The spotting lasted a couple days, then it turned into a full menstruation again (looked dark brownish like the very end of a period but then turned into normal mes. blood). It stopped by Wednesday and then on Saturday had intercourse again followed by spotting (bright red). this only spotted after sex and went away. By this time I had made the doctors appointment for the following Wednesday. By the time wednesday came I woke up with a heavy full menstruation again. the pap smear therefore wasn't able to be completed fully but I had lots of blood work done. Now I am waiting. Currently I am experiencing bloating cramping and have tender breasts basically for the whole month (which isn't uncommon for me and my PMS).      the doctor mentioned: swollen uterus (but I don't know what that could mean), my cervix 'looked' healthy but no smear results yet, and took blood for pregnancy test and iron and other deficiencies.      the reason I never considered pregnancy (or now miscarriage) is because the sex was so late in the cycle. the only reason this makes sense is if I ovulate really late in my cycle. Any advice on this as well?      miscarriage? cervical cancer? tumours? thyroid?   anyone else experience something similar?

20090307004330AAVyUrm	Pregnancy & Parenting;Trying to Conceive	Am I pregnant or going crazy! Shouldnt a women know her body?	Was it implantation bleeding? Did I test HPT & Blood too early?   breasts start to hurt a few days before my period however this month they started hurting over 2 weeks early. I took a hpt a week ago and it was a BFN. I have had 2 blood test from the doc this past week, and its a BFN, however I feel pregnant and wasnt planning so I know that this is not in my head. My lower belly above my pubic bone is swollen and hard as well. Also the sides of my lower belly feel rather tight. I had the gyno test me for ovarian cyst and he said i didnt have any. Tonight I threw up and when I press on my belly it feels weird and makes me wanna puke more.       I started bleeding on the 2nd however my period was not at all normal. It was very light pink slimy! and overly bright red and very little. Usually i spot brown for a few hours or a day and then the next i get a medium period for about 3 days changing my pad about 4-5 times a day and then it tapers off gone by the 4th day. This time i spotted pink when using the toilet. I went into the gyno and demanded an examantion and he claimed my period was there cause he saw a lot of blood. he gave me a maxi pad and sent me home...when i got home there was nothing on it. Go figure and i have not bleed or spotted since. So basically i had 2 days of spotting and less than a tablespoon of blood in total. Had a few huge clots and a few small ones. Never ever in my life has this been normal.       I did another HPT and still it says NEGATIVE.      Not sure when my period is due because it has been rather irregualr in a way for the past 4 months from a previous ovarian cyst and surgery...it comes between the 25th and 3rd.      My breast did stop hurting about 2 days after i spotted when the spotting stopped. usually on a normal period it stops hurting the day i bleed.      Any help would be appreciated and advice as i have had numerous m/c and have not had any children. I am almost 30.      Also I have had some cramping on my cervix. I reconize that cramp during previous miscarriages or pregancy before i miscarry. It isnt bad though. I have felt it about 3 times and very small pain.      i usually am hurlded over in menstrual cramps...this time when i had the suspected period it was a differnt kind of cramp. More like an achiness and very bad back pain.

20090227104310AAcWIts	Pregnancy & Parenting;Other - Pregnancy & Parenting	Bleeding during pregnancy & low hcg/progesterone?	I have been bleeding (pretty heavily some days) for the past 3.5 weeks. I thought I might be pregnant about a month ago and then the bleeding started and I assumed it was my period, but it kept going for another couple weeks. I thought something strange was going on so I decided to get a pregnancy test last weekend and it came back positive. Then I was a little freaked out so I called my doctor's office first thing Monday morning. They had me go in and get my hcg and progesterone levels checked and they came back at 75.2 (hcg) and 0.6 (progesterone), which seems very low for being almost eight weeks pregnant. My doctor put me on a progesterone pill on Tuesday. I had my levels checked again on Wednesday and they increased to 103.2 and 6.0. The doctor thought that was good since they were increasing, but they still seem very low to me. Does anyone have experience with this? Does it sound like I'm getting ready to have a miscarriage? This is so scary to me. I didn't go through anything like this with my first pregnancy.

20090227120800AAwQJVt	Pregnancy & Parenting;Adolescent	How to repay my girlfriend?	I need some nice ideas about what I can do for my girlfriend.   She's so amazing, she's such a sweet and caring girl, the most important person in my life. This is really important to me so let me tell you what ade me feel this way.   Don't get me wrong, I don't love her more for what she did but I guess I just fell in love with her one more time.    I was diagnosed with appendicitis on sunday. I've been cramping real bad all night and I threw up a lot. It was definitely disgusting but she was there with me all the time. She took me to hospital and was there all monday, she was there before I had surgery and right after it even before I woke up, she helped me with everything and has been so nice. I was released on wednesday so she took me to her home since I just moved to the city for college last summer and she didn't want me to be alone.    She's caring for me literally all the time, before school, she makes sure I'll be fine while she's gone preparing lunch and all that, she skips all her extracurriculars so she can be home with me early and when she's here she's taking her time talking to me, keeping me distracted from the pain plus keeping me entertained, telling me over and over again how much she loved me and she hoped I was gonna be fine soon. I always knew she was an awesome person but this is like miles above my expectations, like she's like my personal angel or something. I keep telling her how much I appreciate all that but I feel like it's not enough sicne there's nothing in thi world to show her how much she and all she does means to me. I mean she's only 17.    Any ideas about what I can do for her, something nice and lovely, I'm not really creative and besides that I'm kind of physically limited for th enext couple weeks.    Thanks!

20090227112840AAFxu2n	Pregnancy & Parenting;Newborn & Baby	Anyone else have this problem?  What did you do?	I know they say breastfeeding helps you lose baby weight because your body uses around 500 calories per day to make milk.  But has anyone else had the experience of gaining weight while breastfeeding?  I have only gained about 5 pounds in addition to what I weighed right after I giving birth, but my son is nine months old.  I am not overeating, and I starting working out and cutting junk food about 7 weeks ago.      Please, if all you have to say is "Well, I breastfed and the pounds just melted away" - don't comment!  Not helpful.      My son is almost weaned and I'm hoping I won't feel as hungry all the time.  I seem to store more fat and have more trouble losing it while breastfeeding.  This is my third child and this is always the case for me.
20090227112233AADHDDZ	Pregnancy & Parenting;Other - Pregnancy & Parenting	HELP!! (read for more info)?	Ok, Here is the deal. I am on the pill. I know its not 100% effective. But, My last period was January 29th- 3rd.   my period is due next week. BUT I had spotting for 2 days. VERY VERY LIGHT only needed to change my tampon 1 time, and there was a line of blood on it . Then I wiped and there was nothing (the 1st day) the 2nd day I wiped 1 time and there was spotting light pink. Nothing the rest of the day. Today no blood, but feeling nauseous, light annoying cramping, backache, sleeping a lot, dizzy. (flu like symptoms) .      I know, that you can have pregnancy signs with the pill. But, the 2 day light spotting through me off when my period is due next week. Just wondering was that implantation bleeding?      according to my last period I would be 4 weeks pregnant. I feel so sick. I don't know whats going on, and that darn spotting through me off. What do you think?

20090227115927AAwhMoi	Pregnancy & Parenting;Toddler & Preschooler	Abonormal things about my son....?	My son sweats in his sleep. Not just a little bit, but I mean you can ring out his shirt on a good day. This has been like this forever, and I just think he has overactive sweat glands, but still. It's kind of gross because he sleeps with me. He is 19 months old.       Next, he has a scar like cross (like jesus type cross) on the top of his head as if he had surgery, but he never has gotten surgery. I asked my mom to get him a head x-ray but she said he's fine..... Under the cross, my baby's head has a big mound type lump.      I am only 15 if you are wondering why I had to ask my mom. Some people would say "you need to be responsible, grow up, and go take him to get looked at yourself" , but think about it people, I don't have the money, or a job, not even enough for a co pay.. his insurance isn't reregistered since she didn't go do that. She has never showed me how to handle any of his stuff...      My question is, should I be truly worried about any of this?

20070409053441AAO6XY5	Pregnancy & Parenting;Adolescent	No sé que hacer...?	Hola, tengo 16 a?os. El jueves pasado tuve un peque?o desliz con un chico, no teníamos preservativo, así que en principio no hicimos nada pero luego hubo algo sin llegar a la penetración, aunque fueron solo 4 o 5 segundos. El dijo que no se corrió, la verdad es que yo lo noté que no lo hizo, pero tengo miedo, ya que el domingo de esa misma semana (ayer), empecé a tener náuseas y vomitos, y hoy lunes tengo el estómago revuelto. No sé si será casualidad pero tengo miedo y estoy muy preocupada.   Alguien sabe si los síntomas del embarazo pueden aparecer a los 3 días?? es que es todo muy raro...
