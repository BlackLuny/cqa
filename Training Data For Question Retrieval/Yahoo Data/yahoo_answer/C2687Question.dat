20080213184134AAk0Qlh	Pets;Cats	Gato Siames?	Bueno vengo a saber que tal es la personalidad de su Gato Siames. Recordemos que son una de las razas de gatos mas cari?osas que hay. Bueno mi Gato se llama Taizon y es un Chocolate Point, tiene casi 3 meses, es muy Cari?oso u Jugueton y lo que mas me gusta es que se identifica conmigo.       Yo soy musico, guitarrista para ser exacto y cada vez que pongo en mi computadora musica el se sube y se relaja a escucharla mientras yo toco mi guitarra, muchas veces se sube en mi pierna justamente pegado a mi guitarra y me empieza a lamer las cuerdas, creo que debe ser que es sinestesico y los sonidos de mi guitarra producen sabores en su gusto. Tambien he notado que le gusta mucho los Beatles ya que cada vez que los pongos se viene de donde esta maullando fuerte y se sube a la mesa de la PC, cosa que no pasa por ejemplo cuando pongo Metallica por ejemplo. En definitiva me encanta este Gato Rockero que vino directo de los '60!       Saludos  y espero que cuenten sus experiencias con sus gatos siameses

20090223124055AACydzb	Pets;Dogs	Dog Behavior.  Friendly outside- passive aggressive inside.?	I've asked a few questions about my basset hound in the past.   I've been working SO hard training her.  Hardest dog by far that I've ever trained.  SO stubborn.    So here is the story.  Sorry if it turns out to be a little long.    She's a 5-6 year old Basset hound, yes she is spayed.   I have 2 15 week old puppies--that she HATES whiles shes inside.  She will do everything except bite down on them. She shows teeth, raised hackles, growls, and snaps.   I'm confused with her snapping because she actually snaps in the opposite direction of whomever the snap is directed at.     I've been training with her for two months now nonstop.  And I see little difference in the way she acts on a day to day basis.   And the worst part about it is that she is VERY friendly and playful outside.  They chase and wrestle very good together outside.  But as soon as they step paws in the house its all down hill.     Everytime she acts out of line ((what I feel is out of line)) I give her a firm NO, BAD.  Then remove her from the room for 10 minutes.    She is then allowed to come back in.  If she acts up--back out she goes and we do it all over again until she finally gives in.    But this has been 2 months of doing this and I still see no improvement.     I actually feel in ways that she has degressed.    She is now fighting with my bluetick beagle mix--who up until this point has NEVER EVER EVER acted or seemed as if she was going to attack another dog or human.  Shes never acted funny towards humans--same with my basset.  But she WILL fight the basset.  The only signs i've seen leading up to these fights are a light sniff of the behind and then BOOM its over.  Neither have caused any injuries to eachother-But I know thats whats next.  And would like to prevent it at all costs.    So pretty much any one with experience dealing with issues like these--What do I do next? and what do YOU think is going on in my pack?   And if you know anyone who can help me out could you please star for me? I'm desparate for advise!

20090223080604AARgNlS	Pets;Dogs	What can I do to make my dog gain confidence?	When I pick him out, most of the other dogs bark at him, and he hurries to leave bowed down. He is short (weighs about 10kg) and most of the others are taller, but it doesn't matter the size, if tiny puppies bark at him, he pushes the lead desesperately.   (He's not a clumsy dog nor that sort of dogs that put people nervous... but when someone comes home. Then he is unbearable)   When that happens, I cross the road if the other one is free, because if it bites my dog, no one would help me separate them. I have to ‘make a noise’ at the other to make it leave. If the other dog is with a leash and tightly hold (which happens vary rarely), I go on walking as if nothing although my dog forces me to run.    Just if the other is shy, my dog approches to smell, and gets highly excited quickly. Yet, he has had no affair.   I let him smell and urinate (more or less) the trees which are close to home, because that may help me 'gain more territory', but that doesn't seem working. (He's 5 y o)   At home, at every sound he is usually alarmed. He drops his ears and looks with a sad expression of fear anytime I make a noise. I feel sad for him.   I had him since he was a month and since then he's never suffered any injury, he's never been kicked (strongly) and just once was softly bitten by a dog when he was about 3. What happened before? IDK.   With people he's very sociable, and always willing to play with the ball. He's also masochist with people who kicks or does him some harm (children or childish men…)   ...Too dependent on people.      Well, could you help me? (also correct my mistakes if there are any. I'm not English)      PD:Luckily, at home every day, he is not nervous, he is of that kind that looks at people at the eyes when being talked to, understands what I tell him very much -for being a dog-. Different to other worried dogs, at the street he isn’t looking at everywhere. He smells all the time and when he sees a frightening dog, he drops his ears and walks away. He doesn’t make any fuss… In fact, he never does but when someone comes at home and doesn’t touch him.      Although it doesn’t matter much, when I go out the house, he sometimes/usually comes and sits over his two back legs without holding on me (I don’t let him) so that I touch his soft head or bushy breast. He’s nice.      I think I’ve described him enough…      I don’t know the other dogs we meet at the way. And believe me, no friendly dog have beard him for more than 5 minutes. He wants ‘action’ immediately!   Classes? I would have him given but I can’t afford it.

20090223101942AALXE8o	Pets;Dogs	How do we get our new dog to stop peeing everytime she smells pee? (read for explanation)?	How do I curb this? We just got a new dog about a week ago, and she is housetrained. Except she is still a puppy, so she tries to copy everything my older dog does. One day he peed in my parents room because he got too excited. Now she pees and poops in their room too, and she has been doing that, I think because since she came from the shelter she doesn't know where her boundaries are. But she didn't start peeing in the house until my first dog started too, because shes trying to copy him b/c shes still a puppy. Now she keeps peeing and pooping in my parents room.       I also have pet rats, and they pee in my bed when they crawl around. This morning, she jumped up in my bed to lick me and proceeded to pee, I think because she smelled the rat's pee, so she thought it was okay! (yes, I clean up my rat's pee, but sometimes I don't get every little speck of pee out because it's so miniscule, plus she can smell the pee over the stuff i use to get rid of the pee.)            How do we get her to stop peeing where my older dog peed? Will getting rid of the smell of pee stop her peeing?

I am not looking for a dog now, but in the future when I am older I'd like a dog  (obviously) but I'd like:   A clever dog that easily learns tricks,   Very friendly with all people and animals,   Not bothered about how much/ little exercises but would be calm in the house,   Doesn't mind being in the garden in a run (sleep in or out),   Loyal and trustworthy,   Not bothered about size, but not toy breeds,   Likes swimming,   Coat type and appearance doesn't bother me either      I'd like several dogs in the future, most dogs I'll get will be rescue because I think they're the best dogs however they can have issues, anyway I'd like the characteristics above to fit a pedigree or two cross dog so that I know what to look for, if that makes sence!

I heard that there aren't that many in the US so if I open one up in a good area, then I could make good money.  Will owning a dover saddlery make me good money or is it sort of a waste of time?  My parents don't won't me to have a horse business because they say it doesn't make good money for me to have a nice house and all that.  I love horses way too much and I want to have some kind of business with them.  I want to have horse boarding which makes good money if you have the right facility and all that.  I also want to buy, train, and sell horses.  I really want to find whats going to work for me.  I am not planning on becoming rich but I would like to have a nice house and beautiful barn and property for me and my horses and still have some money to spend for extra things.  Also, Does any of you believe that dressage trained horses usually sell better/faster.  My favorite is jumping but I would be willing to do mainly dressage training with my horses to sell so I make good money.

A few months ago the vet suggested an operation on her nose that involved putting her under anesthetic...im worried because of her heart and that shes never been knocked out before...what are the chances she'll be ok???

Peanut found a pack and when we found him he'd munched several.  Since then he comes and looks in his 'mint spot' for his daily half mint.  He has even been known to dig at my partner's pocket when there are some in there! There do not seem to be any side effects (apart from his addiction) but just wondered what others thought.
20090223114839AAiSuaT	Pets;Dogs	How to train a dog that doesn't want to listen?	My dog doesn't want to listen to anything I say to her. I have tried treats, water bottles,putting her in the cage when she does something wrong, and sitting at the front door open and closing it when she lunges for the door.I try to let her out because she is still a pup and has alot of energy.I can't get her to listen to my husband when he calls her, there is other dogs around her (not mine) they have been outside their whole life and do anything that they want and I guess she thinks she can do the same thing. Any advice would help I am wanting to get her trained before I bring a little one into the house. Thank you everyone that does give me a real answer.

20090223131052AAFPn4h	Pets;Dogs	A dog for my grandma...what do you suggest?	My grandmother is 74 years old and has alzheimer's.  She always remembers her two Silkies, Dina and Rhapsody, who passed on quite a few years back, when she was younger.  Just the other day she told us she wanted a dog - a chihuahua.  Now whenever I see her she says she wants a dog.      My grandma lives with my Uncle and has an in-home nurse who comes to take care of her during the day.  She also has a medium sized fenced in backyard that my dog loves running around in when we come over.  I know she said she wanted a chihuahua, but counting me she has 4 grandchildren, and I know how chihuahuas aren't always good with kids.  I was thinking that we rescue a senor/adult dog.  Does anyone have any suggestions on a breed that I should look out for that's a sweet lapdog, needs minimal exercise, and is good with kids?

20090223113405AAIEkqb	Pets;Dogs	Can i give my dog azo standard for a uti?	i woke up this morning and my 10 y/o chow/pit mix had peed 3x in the house.  this was very unusual as in the whole 10 yrs i've had her she has only had 3 accidents in the house, so right way i knew something was wrong.  while cleaning the mess i noticed there was blood in her urine.  i took her to the vet asap because i didn't know dogs could get uti's so i assumed there was a kidney problem.  the vet checked the urine sample i brought in and she does have a uti which she will be on antibiotics for 19 days.  but she still has discomfort when she pees and  has the frequent urge to pee.  now i just had a uti my self about 2 wks ago (so i really feel bad for my baby cause i remember the pain!) and i have a butt load of azo standard pills left.  since she's 50lbs, can i give her these to help with the discomfort.  she gets all kind of other people meds like benadryle and pepto.

20090223101533AARLykb	Pets;Dogs	Is there any way to treat twitches in a puppy with distemper?	We adopted a small beagle mix puppy when he was 1 month he is now going on three months.  We noticed that he had sneezing, and a little cough so we took him to the vet.  They put him on antibiotics and told us to watch for improvement and to bring him back in if he started showing signs of twitching in the mouth or the "gum chewing" mouth movement.  We started him on the antibiotics and a day later he was back to his old self, cough, runny nose, goopy eyes, all gone. He has not had diarrhea or vomit issues at all.  His appetite is up and he is eating and drinking plenty.  A day later he started having twitching in his right front paw.  It has not stopped for 4 days now and continues.  We know that the distemper has moved into the nuerological stage, we just want to hear from people who have dealt with this disease of whether or not there is something we can do to stop the twitching or ease it while he is sleeping.  We took him back to the vet and they put him on more antibiotics but all symptoms have gone away except the twitching.  We are hoping he is able to sleep through it.  We want to help him in every way possible.

20090223141322AAOjSPq	Pets;Other - Pets	Are hamsters better on their own?	We bought our hamster two weeks ago from Pets at Home's adoption service. She is four months old, a white Syrian and she was given up by her old owners because they said she bit a lot. She has never bitten us, I think they weren't treating her properly, and has a lovely sweet temperament. We bought her a massive Rotastak system of tubes and pods, as well as a nice big cage. Now it seems a shame to just be keeping her in this massive hamster 'palace', as there are so many more hamsters out there who need homes and it could comfortably house two (we already have three hamster 'beds', two wheels, two feeding trays and two water bottles, and the set-up is seriously huge).   Would it be safe to house another hamster with her? Or would it just cause fights and make them both unhappy? Also, if I could get another, would it have to have any specific qualities (such as breed, gender etc.)?

20090223145729AASdlXh	Pets;Dogs	Dog: Cancerous tumors or not?	PLEASE READ   I have a black lab that I found wandering around the neighborhood about 4 years ago. Due to the bad condition of her teeth, the Vet couldn't say for sure how old she was. My guess is she's around 6,7, or 8.    About a month ago I noticed a small tumor on her chest. :(  I've been really tight on money so I put off taking her to the vet temporarily since she is in completely heathly condition other wise, (perfect weight, super shiny coat, good appetite, normal feces). But just lately I noticed yet another tumor near her hip that is growing and now today she's walking kinda off. I have a Vet appointment for Friday, but if anyone could tell me their opinions on if they think it's cancer or could be just fatty tumors or something else(since I have a whole week of worrying ahead), that would be great. Thank you so much!       (P.S. She is still in very healthy condition otherwise)

20090223144436AALxBrL	Pets;Cats	Blood in eyes, dialated pupils and lethargic cat?? HELP!?	To start off I will explain this condition as it progressed. We were out of town overnight and got home late the next day to Ted, our domestic Smokey Black cat sitting there to greet us. He seemed completely fine. The next day we were petting him and he was shedding pretty badly, more than normal. I didn't think too much of it, as he was acting normal otherwise. The following day I left for work and Ted was fast asleep on the couch. I returned on lunch and he was in the exact same spot he was in before I left. I checked his food and he hadn't eaten anything. I checked him over and again he seemed normal. When I finally returned home from work for the day he was again in the same spot on the couch. This did not seem like him at all. My boyfriend got home and we started to do some investigating around the house and on Ted. His right eye seemed to be slightly closed more than the other,but overall looked fine. He was still shedding pretty badly. We decided we should take him to the vet in the morning, and we did.       I called the vet later in the day to check up on him and she said his right eye was completely dialated and it looked to have a spot of blood on it. They wanted to run a bunch of tests, which she said would cost me over $200, which I could not afford right at the moment. I got off work and went in to the vet to talk to her. She explained that she understood and throughout the course of the day he seemed to be getting better and that she recommended that we buy antibiotics and triple antibiotic ointment for his eye. We did and have been treating him for the past 5 days.      Needless to say his eyes have gotten worse. Before I take him back I would like to know if anyone has any insight on this condition. I want to make sure I do not get taken at the Vet if I need to get him treated. I'm also concerned that if this was serious, would they have seen it when I took him in originally? I understand that things happen and if it took certain things for him to get better than I would have most certainly found a way to pay for them, but she didn't seem concerned and said the antibiotics were what they had planned on treating him with originally anyway.      Please, if anyone knows more about this I would really appreciate some information. Like I said, I do not want to jeopordize my cats health in any way but I also cannot afford to be mislead.      Sincerely,   Ted's Mom      P.S. I did not know if I could post pics on here, but I took some today so if you would like to see them to help with any diagnosis' please e-mail me. Thanks!

(ie - feeding time at 4pm) and occasionally he'll do this if he's alone and bored and it's becoming late in the day.   Is there a way to stop this...or is this just...an uncontrollable attribute.

20090223141035AAJUAdK	Pets;Other - Pets	I recently had to move.  How can I help my bunny adjust to the new environment.?	I have a 2-year-old, spayed female rabbit.  She has always been very docile. I used to live in a house with a roomate, and Luna, my bunny, had her cage on the ground floor.  She is litter trained and pretty much had free roam of the entire downstairs (except the kitchen).  Recently, I had to move back home with my parents.  My mother allowed me to keep Luna, but I had to keep her in my bedroom with me.  I bunny proofed the room and I thought it would work out.  Even though the bedroom is a lot smaller than the space she used to have, its still big enough for a bunny to hop around.      Anyway,  it has become an issue.  She seems to be resentful of sharing her space with me. She growls when I come into the room and nips at my feet when I get out of my bed in the morning.  It is a smaller space so I am wondering if, because she cant see over the bed, which blocks the door and anyone coming in,  she feels threatened.  I am not sure why she is acting so different.  I thought she was just adjusting to the move, but it has been a few months and this behavior seems to be getting worse.  I feel frusterated with her, but I am trying to be patient.  I can't imagine giving her away, so I need to find a solution to our "roommate" issues.  Anyone have any ideas?

Now, I have only ever had Anoles/other small lizards and right now I have a little leopard gecko. Since the cage etc would be included I need to know :      What are the day/night temps they need?   If they are a bit aggressive, can they come out of that behavior?   Will the heat/lighting for him add alot to my electric bill?      Any help and random facts are great, thanks!

The angelfish's body is about 4.5 inches not counting the fins. Hasn't grown since I bought him a year  ago.  (I think he might've gone through ammonia poisoning so that explains it. Plus he's only in a  29.) He doesn't pester anyone, but Rasboras are kinda small. Suggestions?

20090223154552AAmS82j	Pets;Dogs	Trouble with dog across the road, advice please?	I got a Rottweiler pup a couple months back hes about 7-8 months  now and hes been really good, hes not the type to fight, doesn't act aggressive or anything in fact he is completely the opposite, hes so friendly and even to people or dogs he doesn't know. The trouble is this other dog who lives across the road. Its an adult staff and like most staff's nowadays is owned by a "rude boy" even though the guy is like 35.. Anyway this staff has been out in our front lawn every night constantly barking at our house because he knows our dog lives here, the owner clearly doesn't give a **** about what his dog is doing and probably wants his staff to fight my dog (looking at the staff its obvious his been in a couple fights). Luckily the 2 haven't met face to face yet but they won't be avoiding each other forever I know it, especially how their dog isn't used on a leash. I just need some advice on anything to solve this situation!! Also if anyone could please give me advice if this staff decides to attack my dog, what should I do (first thing that will come to mind is to kick the piece of ****) and I mean, how will I get this dog off mine. And also today the staff was trying to stop me to get to my OWN front door, like guarding it. If it ever grabbed my Rottweiler I would seriously kill that staff because I love my Rotty so much.

20090223155138AABpGFr	Pets;Birds	My Male Parakeet Is a Jerk!  What can I do?	We have 3 Parakeets we purchased from PetSmart 3 months ago.  Two females and ones male.  The male seems to be several months older.  I'm not sure if he had a bad time at PetSmart but man he is mean.  Every time I clean the cage he flaps his wings like a crazy guy.  He has gotten out twice and is very aggressive even when I have him wrapped in a cloth to get him in is cage.  I was looking forward to hand training the birds.  Within the first 2 days I had one of the younger females on my finger but now the trained has digressed due to this bird being such a Jerk.  His name is A$$ Hole.  Is there anything I can do to tame him or is it too late?
