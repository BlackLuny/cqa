NlYGbqnkaa	The buyer will pay you directly. You in turn will take the money they give you to the bank where you have your current car loan. If it isn't enough you will have to pay the balance. Once your current loan is paid off you will receive a "release of lein" statement or the bank will sign off of your title. So when you pay off your current loan be sure to take your title with you. If you can't go to the bank with the title have them pay you and then call the bank that has the loan and pay them over the phone. Have them fax you the release of lein. You will have to fill out the title, Name, address, sale price ect... Give the title to the person buying the car from you. Make sure you keep a copy of the title and the release of lein. You will want to take this to the dealership where you bought the car and get a refund for the unused portion of your "gap insurance".

XLXncQu9aa	Yes.  It is dangerous because you can easily lose control of your vehicle.  Cruise control does not give you full control of your vehicle especially in wet conditions.  When in rainy weather you want to reduce your speed and hold on to the steering wheel to ensure that you have complete control.  Otherwise you will increase the risk of hydroplaning which can cause an accident.  So do not use cruise control in wet weather.  Always reduce your speed and pay attention to what you are doing.|`|5FVyVS9vaa	Ithink they are. I never use mine when it is wet.|`|FuvCgaEMaa	Well, I'm not the most experienced driver in the world, but at 60,000kms/year at almost exclusively highway and cruise control, I can tell you some things from personal experience.<br>  <br>  Firstly, cruise control in damp conditions is no big deal. Under really heavy rain, things can get a little sketchy. I was driving down the highway with the cruise control on, in the rain, then it started raining really hard and I felt the car go into a lower gear, and the cruise control nearly red-lined the RPM in only 1-2 seconds. The front wheels were spinning wildly. I quickly switched off the cruise control and realized the problem. The rain made the highway basically into a giant puddle. All four wheels on the road were facing huge resistance trying to get through the water, too much resistance for the drive wheels, spinning at any speed, to maintain the car's overall speed.<br>  <br>  The problem is simple: The cruise control is dumb and dutiful. It will do what it thinks it needs to do, up or lower the gas to maintain speed... regardless whether or not the conditions will actually allow the car to maintain that speed. So even though I knew the car wasn't capable of keeping the speed, the cruise control thought it would keep increasing the gas until either the engine red-lined, I turned it off, or the engine stopped (crash). That is why cruise control is dangerous in certain wet conditions.<br>  <br>  I can tell you that this very same thing will happen in the snow.<br>  <br>  Where "fly" comes from? Well... that's probably hydroplaning... that will happen if you're driving too fast on a wet road, cruise control or not.|`|3GHXk05saa	The car isn't going to fly, but it can suddenly accelerate for a short distance. The cruise control keeps the speed of the car the same and the way it measures the speed is by how fast the wheels are turning. If you hit a patch of water and hydroplane a little the wheels are spinning but since they're partially supported by the water, the car is not moving as fast as the wheels are telling the computer it is. So, when you get out of the deeper water and make contact with pavement the car will lurch forward. If you've ever gotten stuck in snow or ice you know how the speedometer shows you're doing 20mph and you're not moving. Same thing.<br>  The reason not to use the cruise in bad weather is because when you're in charge of the accelerator you will adapt to road conditions more quickly. You'll feel the slip and ease off the pedal. Also, if you see something happen up ahead, you'll take your foot off the gas and this slows the car and that little bit may mean the difference between hitting the car in front or not.|`|GNmzjDHHaa	Very dangerous, almost as bad as on ice.  Cuise control relies on tire resistance to the road. Hydroplaning, wet to dry to wet changes that condition and will cause the c.c. to accerated and u could lose control|`|wpgRMjgraa	It is very dangerous because your vehicle can hydroplane very easily and also you can loose control as well.|`|uol7IeHFaa	My biggest concern with cruise control in the rain is this:  If you're driving down a wet road and an animal crosses in front of you, you're likely to respond by quickly hitting the brake.  If you're driving down the highway with your cruise on and hit a slick spot then your car may hydroplane or 'fly'.  Due to varying road conditions and human response to those conditions, it's best to maintain as much control as possible of your vehicle when rain is added to the mix.  This allows you a greater response time in the event of an impending accident.  As for the acceleration, it is possible for a vehicle to surge while in cruise control which would result in a quick burst of speed.  This burst can be enough to cause the drive wheels to spin and then you may lose control of the vehicle.|`|w7IYAhdDaa	Dont use it in rain then but if you do u wont fly but there is a possibility of an accident so avoid using cruise control in rain especially if the car does not have a traction control.
TJMpKqFNaa	Cars aren't really built to go over 100mph so much as they're built to accelerate reasonably quickly from a stop.  Higher top speed than 80mph is a "side effect" of all that power needed to accelerate quickly.  <br>  <br>  If your car was only engineered with enough power to go 80mph you'd probably hate trying to drive it 70mph on the freeway and you'd also probably hate trying to get it onto the freeway in the first place because it would have so little power and such slow acceleration...<br>  <br>  Why cars aren't governed to speeds consistent with legal speed limits is another question entirely.  Consumers buy what they buy - I don't see lots of consumers rushing out to pay new-car-prices for a car that is governed to just ~80mph, and I don't see enough consumers willing to support 80mph governors on all cars to ever make it a law.  People aren't rational - they like to have the ability to go fast even if they never actually have to use it.|`|51d9e39c71aaaed7424c9ac49e9069c5aa	Speed limits in European countries and other places around the world is a pretty lame answer to your question. <br>  The fact that computers now limit the top speed of vehicles sold in this country to match the rating on the tires is proof enough that lowering the top speed is easily achieved through reprogramming of the power train control computer. Some owners would defeat any attempt to lower it to the maximum speed limit (and do it now with after market chips and reprogramming devises despite the fact that limits are consistently over 100 mph).<br>  Lowering the engine out put or size to limit the top speed could prove to be a rather dangerous situation when passing other vehicles because it would also limit the rate of acceleration and significantly increase the distance and time needed to pass.<br>  And the bottom line? <br>  I believe people simple don't like government mandating specifications and interfering with the free market and dictating what they can or can't buy.|`|2ee9ba3f8fa52a8c3bd583c6f12f11b8aa	You have to make what people will buy.

If you break the time you are disqualified<br>  <br>  As for the no speed limits in Germany (autobahn we have all heard so much about) they do still have limits 130kph (81 mph.)

Also, would you brag about your car if it only hit 85?

Damage to the sytem will result from the chemical reaction between the copper, aluminum, and ABS plastic. Try to flush things out with water ONLY. Get it power flushed, if you must. But only use GENUINE VW COOLANT in this engine!!! anything else will cause damage. It must be G11 or G12!!! Make sure that the space between the radiator and the A/C condenser is completely showroom clean! Debris collects here and prevents normal flow of vital air aroung both systems. Use a power wash at the local do-it-yourself car wash. If this is a used car and it did NOT have genuine VW coolant in it, you can expect to have trouble with the heater core eventually. I hope you don't! If only VW coolant was used in this car, it would never need a flush in the first place.

FDeoPn89aa	As a beginning rider, you should stay away from "race replica" sportibkes. These are bikes which are basically store bought versions of bikes that are raced at the Supersport and Superbike level of professional motorcycle racing. They are inappropriate for a beginning rider in the same way that a Formula One racecar would be inappropriate for a new driver. The R6 is a race replica bike, and it is not where a new rider should start.<br>  <br>  There are some more "beginner friendly" sportbikes. I would also suggest that you look at Standards as well as Sportbikes. A standard is basically similar to a sportbike, but it doesn't have the fairing. New riders tend to occasionally drop motorcycles, and a bike without fairing will take less cosmetic damage if you do drop sometime in the first 6 months or so. (Every rider that I know dropped at least once in the first 6 months - even all of the instructors I have worked with have on occasion dropped, so it happens). On a faired bike, this can be very expensive (a simple parking lot drop can do in excess of $1000 damage). On a non-faired bike, the amount of damage will usually be less to fix, and not as noticeable. For this reason also, its not a bad idea to buy a used bike - and if it's already been dropped, you won't be nervous about scratching up a perfect bike.<br>  <br>  Make sure you take a motorcycle safety course first, then take a look at any of the following bikes:<br>  <br>  Suzuki:<br>  <br>  GS500F (older version of the GS500 are standards).<br>  SV650S (the SV650 is a standard version of the same bike - see if you can find one for comparison).<br>  Bandit 600S<br>  Katana 600<br>  <br>  Yamaha:<br>  FZ6<br>  <br>  Honda:<br>  CBR600f4i (the CBR is very close to a race replica bike... probably good for very strong new riders only). <br>  <br>  Kawasaki<br>  The Ninja 250 is going to top out around 110 (unless you weigh more than 200 pounds). I ride with several people who own 250s, and they have no problem keeping up whatsoever as long as I ride at a reasonable pace in the straights. The engine will be a little wound up on the freeway (the little motor on that bike generates power by running at higher RPMs - sounds a little like a motoGP 125 or 250), and you might find the noise a little annoying, but you will learn to get more power out of the bike by not shortshifting - which is a good habit if you ever want to ride on the track. Prior to 2008, the 250's are much smaller, and are based on a late 1980's design, but the bike was redesigned in 2008, and since then, they look just like the larger ninjas. The 2008 and up 250s are pretty hard to find, as they've been very popular with new riders.<br>  <br>  Ninja 500R (still a dated design, but a used one makes a great first bike for almost anybody).<br>  <br>  Ninja 650R - if you were a "rockstar" in your MSF class, then this would make a decent first bike that you'll probably NEVER outgrow. <br>  <br>  After a few thousand miles of riding experience, you can move up to a higher performance bike if you think you need to. <br>  <br>  Riding motorcycles is dangerous - the best way to handle it is to start with the basics, and move up. Starting with a top tier racing motorcycle would be a very unwise move on your part. Experienced riders really frown on new riders who go out and buy race replica bikes. Unless you want to be called "noob" everywhere you go, start with a bike that's more appropriate for your skill level. (Any yes, it is painfully obvious to us when you're a new rider - you might be fooling yourself, but you can't fool us).|`|85e0a1e338cd29e0c7340bdce2fd51d5aa	GS 500 Suzuki's are great|`|kCdISEGqaa	I like the Buell Blast.

Suzuki GS500 is a nice starter bike although you shouldn't have a problem starting off on  600. Sport bikes sit higher so if your shorter that could be a problem. Try to ride a few bikes before you buy, cruisers and sport bikes. I always liked the idea of h aving a sport bike but once I actually rode them didn't like it, too stretched out, not comfortable for long rides, can't ride comfortably wtih a passenger, etc.|`|2FT7sVkbaa	Kawasaki 650 Ninja, or Versys, (both use the same engine)<br>  Suzuki SV650   ( S model has full fairing )<br>  Yamaha FZ6  ( uses the same engine as the R6, but is tuned down for normal highway speeds)|`|Q8GFvklUaa	Learning to ride a motorcycle on a 600cc supersport is like learning to fly in a F-16 fighter jet.<br>  <br>  Saying that getting a 250 is a mistake and not being able to sell it is a rather ignorant statement. It's Kawasaki's best selling motorcycle because it's always in demand. Even when you outgrow it it's still a blast to ride because you can ride it full throttle and a high rmp for a long time. I have one and the local dealership can't keep them in stock. So much for not being able to get rid of them.<br>  <br>  If your going to go bigger because your insecure or you are just deathly afraid of outgrowing or being made fun of go with the kawasaki 650. It's a two cylinder so it isn't as violent as zx6r ninja. The handle bars on the 650 and 250 are higher and more accommodating for a beginner rider.<br>  <br>  You don't need or want a heavy bike with low handle bars, because you'll dump it trying to do slow turns in a parking lot, or loose control in a turn because the throttle is so violent, or lack of experience will cause you to miss or be in the wrong gear and you flip it over.  Plus it cost way less to fix a 250 ninja that cost 4000, than a ZX6r that cost 10,000. <br>  <br>  But hey if you still want to get the 600 cc super-sport bikes just let me know how to get in-touch with you so I can buy it in a few months when you are selling it because you keep laying it over and afraid of it, like 90% of the S.Q.U.I.D.s that buy 600cc to learn with.|`|246c4887a1d51a98dcfd5795d476a2fcaa	Honda makes the nighthawk 250 (234cc, 77 mph, & 90mpg) for $3699.00.  The Motorcycle Safety Institute has been using the CB250  as the primary training motorcycle for a long time. It's simple, inexpensive, and economical. And fun to ride.

TJMpKqFNaa	Practice.  <br>  <br>  Most manufacturers have styling cues that carry over from one model to the next (certain crease-lines, grilles, headlight/tail light design, etc.,)  Make a point of looking at all cars driving by and parked cars etc., every time you go anywhere and identifying what they are.  After a while you should notice a pattern in styling between manufacturers and you should be able to reasonably guess what something is by certain traits.  Looking up pictures online and studying them for specific details may also help.|`|jK5FXm6Naa	It's just knowledge of the car industry, I quite like cars so i'm up to date on what they look like.<br>  I wouldn't know a model t to a rolls royce otherwise :)|`|RkxXHLukaa	1.

L4rW2V9Iaa	I love negotiating.  Depending on the car's make, model, condition, and year, you can negotiate the price.  Go to Kelly Blue Book to find out the value of the car - www.kbb.com.  You must be sure of the condition of the car and the features it includes; this will show you the value of the car currently.  It might behoove you to print this page out with all of the specifications to show to the person selling the car to help your case (assuming the sticker price is higher than the blue book value).  Since you have "cash-in-hand" you will be able to negotiate much further than someone who comes in with a credit card, $1000 down or wants a finance plan.  If the person selling the car is a dealer, it is easier to get a good deal because they have more money to work within their business.  If it is sold by a private person, it may be a little more difficult since most private sellers want what the sticker price is.  Be careful though, there are hidden prices attached to buying a car like tax, title and license - so at your price point, it may be a little more difficult to get them to come down that low.  You could get away with it most likely if you offered full price or as close to it as possible and ask them to pay the TT&L.  See if they will let you go on a payment plan at 0% interest for 3 - 6 months to pay off the difference.  Generally, I would say don't put it on any kind of payment or finance plan, so you might want to think about saving up a little more for the car first.  So here are my suggestions as to how to deal with the person selling the car:<br>  <br>  If the person selling the car is a dealer:<br>  1. Take a look at the car, but don't act too interested.  If the sales person sees this, even in your voice or facial expressions, they will hammer you to get the sale at full price.  Make the sales person do all the work.  *This goes for a private seller as well.<br>  2. If you say I will think about it and will meet with them in a few moments about the car.<br>  3. Go in to talk with them and ask them what the best deal is that they can give you on the car.  They will usually either say the sticker price or maybe a couple hundred less than that.  *This is not the lowest price that they can give you, even though they say that.<br>  4. Tell them you are looking for a deal and that the one they presented is "Not good enough."  They will then ask you what they need to do to close the sale (if that sales person cannot do better, ask for the manager) OR they will say that's the best they can do.  If they say that, tell them thank you and start to get up and leave - I guarantee you they will say hold on a minute and let me get my manager.  This is where the real negotiation begins.<br>  5. When the manager comes in, let them speak first and make it uncomfortable for them.  They want the sale, but you do not want to say too much too quickly.  After they ask, what can we do for you, say, "I want a deal."  Give them the silent treatment after they answer.  It makes them evaluate what they can really do for you.  They will likely come down even further.  Be firm.<br>  6. When they come back with the "deal" show them the information that you have obtained online from Kelly Blue Book (only if it helps your case) - remember to not look excited.  They will then discuss the results with you further; give them the silent treatment again.  Remember, they work for you, not you for them.  This is a negotiation deal.<br>  7. As your final bit of ammo, say that you have cash-in-hand for $8900 and that's what you are willing to offer for the car - with TT&L.  Be sure to have the cash in $50 - $100 bills.  They will have an emotional connection with this money (just by seeing it) and will be drawn to it.  It's not every day that someone comes in with cash.  They will either take it or leave it at this point.<br>  8.  Tell them thank you and to let them know when they would like to negotiate another sale on the car at another time for the same price -  or less.<br>  9. They will most likely come running after you to by the car before you even walk out the door.  In this day and age, everyone needs to make a sale, especially the car dealers.  it might surprise you what you might get as a deal.  It costs them more to hold onto the car or have the car financed than it does to sell it for less than sticker price.<br>  <br>  Good luck.|`|c22cd3bc80b769e97ac9ae2bc60d368eaa	Simple; make a firm offer of $8900.  Don't just ask "Will you take $8900?"  Say "I will give you $8900 for the car."  Seller will accept, reject or counter the offer.  Seller may not wish to sell for that price.  So then you look for something else.|`|jK5FXm6Naa	Cash isn't a big deal to people now unless the garage isn't very honest. The reason being is that everything has to be put through the books, so the cash would have to go in the bank the same as anything else. Cash is actually more of a pain to them because it can be fake and they have it hanging around for someone to steal.<br>  Is the car on a sale at that price?<br>  Your best bet is to say your looking at a few cars so you make sure he knows his isn't the only one your interested in, go around the car and tell him of any faults you find. Ask him if the car is taxed and mot'd, and if he would take money off or include that in the price.<br>  Tell him you have the money to pay straight away, not finance. The way things are now, it would be hard to refuse that sort of money.

During the oil change an inspection is done to detect problems at an early stage before they grow into a larger problem.  (A loose tie rod end is't going to get better and the mechanical slop in it will alow movment that wears on the remaining parts on the steering gear for example.)<br>  <br>  There was an old commercial for Fram oil filters showing a mechanic in front of a car on a lift.<br>  <br>  "You can pay me now or pay me later<br>  <br>  Meaing you canspend a little doing preventative maintanence (oil changes and inspections) or pay  a lot more for a major repair later.|`|addaf7237cf3d32190cfc96546e98709aa	??

But I would tell the insurance company that his failure to respond does not absolve them of taking responsibility for the damage to your car.  They have the police report.  Notify your state's insurance commissioner of the problem.  They may get the fire lit to get them to move.  The insurance company is looking for any way possible to reduce or reject your claim.  Since you weren't injured, a lawyer will not touch your case (it will cost you more than the damages).

f841afbad67e2febaf16f5f41aea6d1eaa	There could be any number of reasons for this.  The key unit is broken, or the latch itself is not working, even the trunk lid itself could be stuck either by ice and snow, or sticky substance.  <br>  <br>  If you're not hearing that definitive click which indicates that the latch has disengaged, I'd have someone look the key and latch unit.<br>  <br>  edit to add: <br>  Check inside the glove box for a trunk release button.

After opening spray some lube on it and turn the key a few times.|`|wukv5BHcaa	because the key turns 180, that sounds like a bad lock set.

muPiBQ3Uaa	It has a timing chain, which has no service interval. That means you dont have to do anything to the chain unless there is a problem, which is rare.<br>  <br>  As to the other items, you have it covered pretty well. I might suggest having the brake linings checked, replace the wipers if they havent been done in the last 6 months, and have all the exterior lights checked for proper operation.<br>  <br>  Edit to add: Rayvin----I got the information from the GM dealer service information site, which is the official GM repair manual for the proper repair procedures. This engine has an oil pressure operated timing chain tensioner that takes up any slack that may be in the chain, so there is no service procedure for "checking" the chain, as you claim. The chain and tensioner have no service interval, and are replaced only if there is a problem (rare), in the event of breakage (very rare), or engine overhaul/rebuild. Thats all. This is taken from official GM information, and I doubt that you know any better than the ones who designed and built the vehicle.<br>  <br>  Drive safely.|`|wXyoo8mNaa	If it's a belt or a chain it should be replaced at 100,000 miles.If  it breaks it can do serious damage to engine expensive repair.|`|DMDdkQqPaa	listen to the gm tech u don't have to change the timing chain at 100,000|`|GNmzjDHHaa	Where do you get ur infor that a chain doesn't need replacing-regardless at 100.000 miles it should be checked at very least and replaced

What is the largest size i can use? <br>  2. Next, what size would look best on the car? <br>  3. What size would have good ride comfort?<br>  4. What size would provide good steering/ manoeuvrability?<br>  5. What size would personally recommend, considering looks and in terms of performance?<br>  <br>  PLEASE tell me the size of the wheel as well as the size of the tyre (so i know the overall combination)<br>  <br>  6. Another question: What are the specifications i need, in order to find a wheel to fit the Clio ?<br>  <br>  My Answer - 1. 17" alloys with 205/50/R17 tyres. You might get some rubbing with such a large wheel though.<br>  2. 16". Any bigger and it does not look to good. The wheels look to big for the car, as its a little out of proportion.<br>  3. 15".<br>  4. 16"<br>  5. I would personally go with 16". That is the size fitted to the RenaultSport models, and they are perfect.<br>  <br>  For 16" wheels, go with either 195/50/R16 or 205/50/R16 tyres.<br>  6. I can't remember the offset you need, sorry. You might need spacers to prevent rubbing though. 5mm will be enough, and get hubcentric ones.|`|2Y2AFV7Kaa	I agree with the previous answer but also bear in mind speedometers may need recalibrating due to a larger wheel size

It is not a very fuel efficient vehicle.
g7M1DxFCaa	White smoke is either unburnt fuel or water.  Unburnt fuel is only likely in the case of a diesel because any unburnt petrol will be ignited in the manifold by the exhausts of the other cylinders.  White smoke when cold is as said usually just condensation in the exhaust.  If it continues when hot it's coolant water getting into the cylinders, usually from a blown head gasket or cracked cylinder head.  There is one other cause and that's if you accidently put diesel in a petrol car.  Oil generally burns blue, and black smoke is over rich fuel mixture.    EDIT:  The condition of the engine is not a part of the MOT except for it's carbon monoxide emmisions.  How much will it cost?  It may be worth doing it yourself if you're a mechanic but it's quite an old car so unless you're really attached to it or have a mate who'll do it cheaply then I wouldn't bother.  You won't know exactly what's wrong until you strip the engine down.  With a problem like this it's often worth having the head skimmed in case it's warped or burnt around the leak but it's also possible that the head is cracked and you should also consider having it checked for this too, you don't want to have to fix it more than once.  Maybe before you strip it down you should check the engine's compression, one or two low cylinders would suggest the head gasket but if they're all low then the rings are probably worn out too.  You could consider finding a good engine somewhere and swapping them, it might not be very different in price.  It may work out for the best just to scrap it/sell for spares or repairs though as any of these jobs will involve a lot in labour costs unless you've a mate who's a mechanic.|`|3hQPJDkZaa	White smoke usually means water is entering the combustion chamber most likely through a broken head gasket.     I had a 96 Mitsubishi lancer with 189k on the clock when this happened to me. The coolant expansion bottle was bubbling over after a short drive. the engine temperature would stay steady for a while then shoot up almost off the scale. I used a product called wonder weld which is supposed to mend damaged head gaskets but this didn't work for me because the car overheated and warped the head. I got a quote of 1000 to fix the car so i decided to scrap it.    An mot will not pick it up    Blue smoke = burning oil|`|Ty32khkaaa	The engine is burning oil. Probably bad piston rings.|`|OcSVkKsEaa	if is white then sounds like a head gasket or cracked head.check the oil for antifreeze and the antifreeze level as well.|`|8GDBr2U9aa	White smoke is coolant leaking into the combustion chamber.

FgRUdQOBaa	I've done it most of my career, until recently.     Now with the legal concerns, the penalty is much too great, I could risk being terminated.   In the past it would have just been a verbal reprimand.     If you could get permission from the RR, I would love to be able to share what I do and see with someone interested from time to time, but as they say "good luck with that".     Almost everyone can take their families to work, at least for a short tour of what they do, and we in the RR industry, having one of the most demanding unique jobs out there can't do it.    EDIT: I am pasting and copying an answer I gave quite some time back to a similar question about work place events:      "The question earleir about railfans and photographers reminded me of one that my Dad told.   Back on the Milwaukee, as you can imagine with the electric power it was quite popular with railfans, hardly a daylight trip went by someone wasnt out there taking pictures or movies. One day he was cutting out the helpers at Piedmont and there were a couple guys taking pictures, being a freindly sort of guy Dad started talking to them, they had all sorts of questions and Dad asked if one of them would like to ride back over the hill and the other one could drive to Butte Yard and pick him up, ohhmygosh yes!!   They flipped a coin to see who got to ride and the guy was beside himself the whole way, taking notes, snapping pictures, asking questions. Had a great time and thanked him most profusely.     A few months later the division Superintendant met Dad at the yard office and asked him to come into his office for a minute. The guy had written an article and it was published in one of the nationwide railfan magazines!   Of course there were pictures, the date, engine numbers, the crew name, everything.   The Super just said next time you let someone ride tell them to keep it quiet and ferchristsake dont put it in a godamned magazine!"|`|5FVyVS9vaa	All you can do is ask.|`|902bf06cc6e416f1757072330cfc5b9daa	It's a no no.  But it never stopped me from conducting an impromptu cab tour.    Train rides are a little more risky, insofar as the potential for discipline is involved, but all of my family members have been to work with me at one time or another, on local freight and special train assignments.    My kids spent an afternoon on a local with me.  The thing they remember is the conductor giving them each a piece of bubble gum...  That was on the SP and in the good ol' days...  Today I wouldn't ask a crew member to risk their job for me...|`|6xyeYjkkaa	Ask them. Worst they can say is no. I have seen it done on some excursion trains and the History channel had a recent article entitled "Extreme Trains" where they had a narrator and cameraman riding, in the cab, cross country on a fast freight train.|`|WsKUEgQraa	With a short line you chances are much better.On a Class 1 railroad it's a no no.I'd love to be able to give rides to people but those days are over in these security minded times,not to mention how sue crazy people are these days.    Edit..Bc all i can suggest is try to talk to the crew and maybe get to know them a bit.Ask if you could see inside the cab.Then after they have seen you around a few times ask them who could you talk to about possibly getting a ride.Make sure if they offer a ride to ask them if they are sure it's ok as you don't want anyone to get in trouble if the wrong person see's you up there.Most of us are proud of what we do and would be glad to offer a ride if we could.Good luck!|`|3Y2jRkxcaa	Most train crews are pretty friendly people, especially shortlines.   My Dad is an engineer and usually he doesn't have people wanting to come onboard but he let me once. You will probably get on someday, just ask the brakeman when he is throwing a switch or something.|`|pbNfLuliaa	i think that you should ask him and yeah the worse that they can say is NO Right|`|AA11264965	With it being a shortline your chances are better, as they tend to be more relaxed than say a Class 1. Like everyone has said, the worst they can say is no.|`|OwB0ROPmaa	As said above me, security, but more so "insurance security" is the real reason for railroads to put an end to the "cab rides" railfans have enjoyed for countless generations. One of my best friends is a lifetime engineer for Shared Assets (Conrail) here in NJ. Aside from me, nearly all of HIS friends were met trackside, or during a cab ride in an era where someone toting a camera was viewed as a friend, as opposed to a terrorist now-a-days. On a short line, especially, it's still possible to score a cab ride, you must first get to know the crew in a non-threatening way. For example, if every time the crew sees you, you are taking pictures from railroad property, or dangling from the side of a centerflow car, then they will view you as a FOAMER and not someone plainly interested in the railroad industry. Not to be rude, but if the crew views you as a nutjob, then you can kiss your cab ride GOODBYE, I'm serious here! I myself dabble in a shortline's operation, and I can truly attest: "There's nothing I hate more then a cab ride whore". If you come across to the crew as someone who is genuinely interested in operations, then before long they will probably OFFER you a ride. My last stress to you: If you ARE allowed a ride, keep yer yapper shut, and DON'T go around telling everyone you know that you just rode the Choo Choo at xyz shortline, OK?

McqWrHP5aa	Providing you are convinced the glowplugs are working as they should,  then the next stage will be to investigate fuel delivery.    These little Isuzu engines are "hard as nails," and providing they have the correct oil changes there isn't an awful lot that can wrong with them.  I have known the banjo bolt on the top of the fuel filter to crack leading to air being drawn into the system, otherwise replace the fuel filter, this should also remove any condensed water build up in the filter too.    Have you tried letting the glowplug light go out, then turning the key back and letting them reheat again a few times,  sometimes this will fire a stubourn old diesel engine on a cold morning.    If you need to check the plugs,  as I recall some of these engines had 5v glowplugs,  and a combined transformer/relay that occasionally used to give problems,  but its a long time since I worked on one.    I also recall the Cavalier with the 1.7TD version of this engine used to suffer from faulty ECU's that had a dry joint that would make them near impossible to start, the ECU is very basic as they are a IDI diesel engine but it does control some very basic features. If I remember you opened the ECU and on the PCB there was a very clear dry joint you just needed to resolder, well.. on the Cavalier anyway.

CgwfrOpmaa	To put some of these cons to rest ill give you the good before the bad. As far as handling goes, the tj has handling far superior to any other of the leaf spring jeeps, its rear suspension is independent and it allow the tj to do a hell of alot without flipping over or even loosing any kind of grip. on that note, the tjs coil spring suspenion allows it to well, the highest i ever got was about 5 feet in the air with my right front tire while my left stayed on the ground... i pushed the thing as far as it would go without flipping. put a k&n air intake on it an a new exhaust, hell just have them weld a glasspac on it and your mileage improves dramaticly.   it is definately fun as hell to drive, its a great tailgating and lake vehicle.    the bad, its increadably noisy, i had 4 tops, 1 hard, 2 soft, 1 bikini, the road noise with any of them is insane! i loved the hum of the tires but the soft tops dont make an air... or water... proof fit and they flap in the wind, the hard top will whistle in the wind if its not down perfectly.  the jeep is reliable as all get out and an absolutely stupendous car... untill you wreck it, if you wreck the thing you might as well get rid of it then because its all down hill from there.

Improper engine heating and sensor readings result if you don't. If you have the wrong water pump in here, you will cause engine damage!! The usual cause of cooling system pressure surges is a bad head gasket. THe cylinder head may have warped a little between the time the first pump broke, and the new one installed. This is not a difficult job on this engine, being a 5 cylinder. It is a MARVELOUS car to work on. You will need some special tools (see Blaufergnugen web-site). You may have to have your cyl head heated and restretched and resurfaced, though. Use only genuine Audi coolant. The Blaufergnugen web-site should list the proper water pump for this car. Once you get ovet this little hurdle, you will have a fantastic car. Have someone with a little savvy clean out your fuel metering box and throttle housing. Also, inspect the PCV hose for excessive wear, it has a tendency to collapse from age. Use only ELF or Mobil One in this car!!! Also, use Bosch Platinum or Nippondenso Iridium plugs for best power and mileage. After servicing, this car should last another 100,000 miles before another pump and timing belt are required.

They can get his name, LKA, maybe even a phone number.<br>  If I were u I would hire a attorney just in case, because yes, you can sue and I sure would be doing it.|`|3tnVVFjHaa	did you get a written estimate.and showing your deposit.if not you must report to the police that your car was stolen.and where it was stolen from.do it now.also notify your insurance co.|`|VkzmH1GKaa	Step one call the police and make a report.

Finally call a lawyer.|`|hkLY035raa	Call the fuzz, that crook's got your ride and your money.|`|OAkL8yuSaa	If the car is no longer there and the owner of the workshop can't account for it's whereabouts (they may have had to have taken it to a specialist for something, unlikely but possible) then go to the police and tell them what has happened. They will be able to investigate the situation and from there you can decide whether you will need to get lawyers involved or not.<br>  <br>  Even if they weren't responsible for the theft, they ARE responsible for the safety of your car when it is in their possession.<br>  <br>  Also, in the future, do no pay for mechanical repairs in advance.|`|sbeoF50gaa	call the police right now and tell them your story they will look into it and help you on what to do next.|`|zOIgzIy4aa	sounds like he stoled your damn car. i would put a tracer on it and yes you can sue the shop. anytime you have your car in for repairs they are liable for any damage of theft.
a0565811de871e19a5c2a7b27aeadf50aa	If your're serious about keeping the car, I concur with the previous response about the importance of developing a relationship with a trustworthy and competent mechanic familiar with Audi.  Ask other Audi drivers for recommended shops and/or mechanics in your area.  Nurture that relationship with the mechanic - take him a 6-pack or a bottle of wine.  Remember him at Xmas.<br>  <br>  In life one needs an honest MD and an honest mechanic.|`|LrsgQIq5aa	In terms of all cars, yes.  In terms of German cars and high end automobiles than no.  It is cheaper to fix than a BMW or Mercedes but more expensive than a Nissan, Toyota etc,  This is what comes along with luxury cars.<br>  <br>  It should also be taken into account that your car is more than 13 years old and at this time, more expensive parts break.<br>  <br>  You should also make sure you have a trustworthy mechanic.  If you go to the Audi dealer they are going to be MUCH more expensive and they will want to fix every little thing.
hkLY035raa	What - just cruising along and it craps out?<br>  <br>  First and easiest check - fuel filter.  If it dies more quickly the faster you go, the more I suspect the fuel filter.<br>  <br>  Other possibilities: fuel pump (you might have been hearing it moaning its death song over the last few weeks), EFI going wonky, ignition going wonky.<br>  <br>  My truck eats plug wires.  Every three years, new set.  Maybe yours has an appetite for them too.  Replace yours - $20, ten minutes.  If it doesn't improve matters, then at least you're positive that wasn't it.  Change the lugs while you're in there: $15, another ten minutes.  Again, a quick, easy possible cause to eliminate.<br>  <br>  Beyond that, it's going to be more involved and may take tools you don't have.  Do those simple things and see how it goes.  If that doesn't set you straight, to the shop you go.<br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|HFrsH9MRaa	I would just LOVE to give you a tune-up, baby. What kind, year, model mileage truck is this??? NEED MORE INFO!!!!!!|`|AA10731159	Where to start-you need to determine if, when it stalls, is it losing fuel or spark. Start with having a reputable shop do basic diagnostics on it, or be prepared to invest in some tools to diagnose it such as a fuel pressure guage, a spark checker, and since you didn't mention the year/make/model there are literally thousands of dollars of diagnostic equipment available for anything on the road. Do yourself a favor-bite the bullet and pay a shop an hour or two's labor to determine what it is.

Even 1%ers will not bother you, if you are not bothering them.<br>  <br>  Excellent question, kudos!|`|sHB9a7P3aa	I prefer riding by myself or with only one other. Groups are dangerous.

All 3 instructors emphasized the 2 second rule and all said they avoid riding in groups.|`|6FBGUpKTaa	I prefer to ride by myself, or in a very small group.{1 or 2 others} If you've ever ridden in a large group before,it sometimes seems that everyone but you is an idiot.|`|Kl54UI1Yaa	I prefer to ride by myself, but it is great to have help if something breaks.  <br>  Either way,<br>  Good luck and ride safe.|`|2a81d626b8332849227f2aa88c035fc6aa	I perfer riding alone or in a small group of 2 maybe 3 riders|`|bfa542a41113a06bd1000a3f8b1b90b7aa	by my self|`|5lfnpGmUaa	Solo usually. Or a small group.|`|YupMCYHlaa	I like riding with a small group, 2 or 3 people.  It's safer in case anyone has a spill.  Plus when you stop you have someone to talk to.<br>  <br>  But the problem is that some people are faster or slower than others, so the group proceeds at the speed of the slowest, because you should never force someone to go faster than he feels safe.  And once we stop for coffee or something, I'm always hot to get back on the road but my friends want to sit around and talk.<br>  <br>  The old protocol for group riding was in staggered formation, 2-second distance, all that.  But group rides today work differently.  Everyone starts out from one point to meet at the next point, sport bikes first, cruisers last.  Everyone rides alone, at his own pace, until the group is assembled at the next point, and only when everyone gets to the next point do you leave for the next point.  The last rider to leave is the 'sweep' and he is on the lookout for bikes that are down. I think that works pretty well.<br>  <br>  But I ride mostly by myself.|`|c22cd3bc80b769e97ac9ae2bc60d368eaa	Riding with a large group, who know how to ride, is a thrill!  The roar of the engines, the king of the road feeling, the look of terror on cage drivers, the thumbs up from people,...<br>  Riding with a bunch of numskulls who don't know how to ride is just downright scary!  I've quickly left rides where idiots present a danger to everyone.|`|AA10703176	A small group of like minded people. Either that or alone. I like to go slow and look around when I am on a road I seldom or never traveled.  A larger group if I want to enjoy the thrill of the noise and people. Not a hell of a lot of bikers around here right now anyway. Some I have known for years but was surprised to learn they ride these days.|`|1ca078fb6ac9d1741007da931ca6cd16aa	Solo.<br>  <br>  <br>  Hey, Bart!<br>  I though we couldn't even catch up (according to you)|`|kCdISEGqaa	By myself, that way I can dictate where I go and when I get there.
wpgRMjgraa	Yes its true in all states and they will want you to pay everything in full.........but in many states if you speak with someone with a brain they "will" work out some type of payment system because many of us do not have that kind of money just sitting around and best of luck.
AA11635143	EDIT:  A CarFax report has NOTHING to do with being insured.  I've used it several times and it shows the date, place with address, phone number, and type of service, as well as place of original purchase.  If the car has been wrecked, repaired, or totaled it will show if a legitimate business performed the work.  Most of those companies subscribe to CarFax.  I know because I am looking at a report as I write this.<br>  <br>  Personally, I would be very suspicious of the car AND the person selling it.  It would be worth your time to pay the fee and go to <a href="http://www.carfax.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.carfax.com</a> and run the VIN through their system.  It will probably give you the history of the car from the first date of purchase.  It may have been totaled out and someone bought it from a junkyard and repaired it for resale.  btw, it may be against the law in your state.  There are lots of cars on the market right now that have also gone through hurricanes and floods.  The wiring system may be rotting out and there may be black mold inside the car.  I think the cost of a CarFax report is either $29.95 or $39.95 but it will be worth it if it saves you from buying a junk car.  The car could have some hidden damage like a bent frame and you wouldn't know it until your tires kept wearing out or you spent a lot of money on front end alignments that doesn't stop the vibrations.<br>  <br>  Make yourself a list of questions to ask the seller, look him/her in the eyes and ask each question.  Be sure the first one is where has this car been since AT LEAST 2006?  Why hasn't it had a state inspection since then?|`|Nl2U569eaa	Don't buy the car until the proper inspections have been made! That is a huge red flag! Dealers everywhere are looking to get rid of cars. You should require the owner to get the proper inspection and take it to a mechanic to do a check. This costs under $200 and is well worth it to save you from the scary ramifications of having a blown catalytic converter, or mold, or a bent frame, etc. If you can't get another car because you can't get approved for a loan i would buy a car with cash or go to a buy here pay here. of course you need to be aware that their rates are higher because of the risk of financing people with bad credit. J.D.Byrider writes a blog about credit|`|9d73b9faab05a54464dbbdea67ca0847aa	Definitely ask why and see if the explanation is accompanied with direct eye contact - if they look away, it's a lie and I'd recommend looking elsewhere.  <br>  <br>  I'd be wary of trusting Carfax reports because if the car was insured privately, Carfax will give it a clean report when there could be some privately fixed damage.|`|OoQvlsqqaa	don't buy it unless you want to do the work yourself.<br>  <br>  An uninspected car usually means there was something that the owner needed to have doen to it to get it up to standards, You should be able to haggle to get the car for however much less the service will cost you to hav it done!<br>  Good luck!|`|NeBDl4Hfaa	The car hasn't been inspected for almost 3 years.... yes this should be a major concern to you|`|wgxYJ2Fgaa	well then get another inspection but id wonder too id ask him|`|MnmNl6Hiaa	UNLESS IT'S BEEN I ARKANSAS   NO!!!!|`|UQWusO1waa	could cost you as much as another 1000 if it needs a new catalytic converter and of exhaust system repair. If you test drive it and like it. tell them you will buy it if they get it smog tested. I think your concern is a good one. There are tons of used cars for sale.|`|AA11914369	Sure, assuming the seller is willing to take it in and get a current inspection sticker.  If he won't, the chances are it has a major problem that you don't want to inherit.<br>  <br>  Or, it you are just looking for a parts car, and the price is right, you might consider it too.<br>  <br>  But if you're looking to drive it, don't buy without a current sticker.|`|6R9McFZhaa	well here in fl ,you go with the paper to the office and they know ,well you have to buy the new tag and the sticker|`|AUsvrW8faa	Take the paperwork to DMV and see what is needed to get the car registered.  <br>  <br>  Have the owner knock off the price it will cost to get the car registered then it would be a good deal.|`|DV4xyeChaa	ask..there may be a good reason for it...or buy it on condition it passes...no pass no cash|`|PuV9lh37aa	No

XBUeYE41aa	Many small coils on dirt bikes, small engines and scooters have the spark plug wire pressed and glued into coil- usually replace coil and wire together as plug wire basicly not replacable in field.. Aftermarket coils can be used with seperate wire or maybe use a car coil from VW beetle type or in couiple cases i know plain Ford patterns. BMW /5 had 2 Bosch coils with replaceable wires- what kind of bike you working with.  Clamp car coil to front frame, run extended wire loom to coil, use metal core spark plug wire and marine plug cap- used to be common or 2 stroke racers.<br>  In emergency you can cut wire cored wires and splice in another piece, tape it up .|`|6FBGUpKTaa	The coils/wires I have dealt with have been replaceable.

nRNsfbE9aa	I have 2 Power Acoustik amps and love them. Don't listen to the idiot above me, they are slightly over-rated which is obvious when calculated using the fuses amp ratings. He is a "know it all" who just trys to prove people wrong. He tried to tell me my gain was set incorrect when I said I set it correct, if I say it's correct I obviously used a voltometer. I would definatley recommend them on a budget though. And also Rockford amps (especially older models) are under-rated as can be seen on the birth sheet when you order one. Go with Power Acoustik though, you will definatley not be dissapointed by the output.|`|L0H4iVHWaa	they dont compare to alpine or rockfors fosgate, but rockford fosgate also doesnt compare to MTX or even kicker, which are top name amps<br>  <br>  power acoustik is make with little quality and their amps arent reliable.. but if thats all you budget can afford than your fine<br>  <br>  i would recommend even a sony amp over a power acoustik, sony amps are the only thing good for cars sony can make<br>  <br>  i would go with at least pioneer or kenwood for an amp, kicker or mtx if you can afford it along with an alpine or a rockford fosgate amp<br>  <br>  stay away from power acoustik amps, they arent made with great quality like an amp should be|`|71HuONGQaa	If that's what you can afford , you could do alot worse , I've used the 5500d 's without a problem in the past , but they are overrated quite a bit, the 5500 was only around 2500 rms total output, and has a fairly large footprint, and the caps on the input are fairly easy to pop without enough electrical to support the current draw of the amplifier, which is fairly common though|`|AA10721138	edwards1337, after you graduate from high school let us know because then you will start to get real life experience, also after you have real experience with Power Acoustik then let us know. Until then do not give advice on things you do not know about. Rockford Fosgate for one thing is way over priced, you barely get the RMS wattage out of them, going down as time passes them by. MTX is nothing but a disgusting joke, their amps are no better than their subs, which are freaking weak. As for Power Acoustik, you get the RMS that they tell you that you will get, yes like RF, but the difference is the price. It is kind of like saying MB Quart is great stuff and saying Crunch is garbage. Since Crunch, MB Quart, Hi-Fonics, and Autotex are made from the same company, I guess that would make them all garbage since they all use the same parts? All same company, MAXX SONICS out of Chicago, oh wait, yeah, that is where I grew up at as well.<br>  So Alex to answer your question, yes it will perform just as good as say an Alpine, but cost much less. Power Acoustik has been around for a number of years, they used to just suck, but the last few years they have been makeing some pretty good amps. Being used more and more, they are in the process of rebuilding their reputation. Comparable in performance, just not on your bank account.|`|PIuEcCRPaa	power acoustic is a good company, they just aren't well known. they have a wide selection just like any other company like alpine or rockford.  i have a acoustic 2400w amp in my 1st car and it took anything i through at it for 3 years until it got stolen. i used it to push 2 punch 2's and it was on max for a hour straight 2x a day.

Abnormal tire wear is generally the most common symptom of a loose tie rod.|`|wroDTMUwaa	Tie rod ends are the connectors on your steering linkage some cars have 4 and the new cars have two. The cost could vary. 20 to 40 $. <br>   The noise might be a worn wheel bearing which will be more pronounced when steering side to side. Also some tires develop flat spots over night.

The 750 is a mono block and only puts out about 350-400 Watts rms and your subs need anywhere from 50-750 Watts Rms each, so the amp you have will work but it wont be anywhere near the full potentiol of the subs therefore not as loud as you would like.

Unless you want to pay some legal fees and agitate your employer, it's probably not worth it. How bad was the damage?|`|978j8yySaa	1. Yes.  You can report it to your own auto insurace who will pay for the damage (as long as you carry collision coverage) and they will then subrogate against the employer's auto policy.<br>  <br>  2. You can make a police report with regard to the collision advising what happened and who the other party was (your employer).  This may convince them to take care of their responsibility.<br>  <br>  3. Who was driving the forklift on the day your car was hit?  It seems like you could narrow it down to find out who hit your car and advise your insurance carrier, employer and make mention in the police report.<br>  <br>  4. Be sure to take photos of your car, where it was parked when the damage took place AND look for damage to the forklift as well.|`|0DwHIBUbaa	I suppose the accident happened on private property, in which case all insurances will have a cop-out clause.

bKhWqSeeaa	Dont worry about the oil gauge. The oil sending unit may have just went bad. You can have a mechanic put in a new sending unit. As long as it is full of oil and the engine is not "knocking" then you have oil pressure. The oil pump could be going bad, but very doubtful since its not too old. However, it could be running bad due to a fouled spark plug or it maybe time for some new plug wires or coil pack. My bet is on the oil sending unit, as they go out just like any other sensor.|`|379b18fddd29f1b64385008f275bdd61aa	You need to determine if the pressure is actually bad or if it is simply an indication problem. Don't waste time having a parts place run a diagnostic for free. Their scanners are junk and the people who run them don't know squat about cars. Have a shop check it and see what the problems is so you can deal with it properly. You may have some blockage because of the "flush" done. I never recommend them as they are known to cause problems. If you do regular maintenance and oil changes they are unnecessary.|`|hkLY035raa	I just went to the 60degree GM V6 website and saw nothing to indicate a propensity of oil pressure problems with your engine, so you may have a bad sensor, which shouldn't be hard to fix, or something more serious internally.  Either way, driving it isn't advised until you know more - if it really is bad pressure, every turn of the crankshaft is inching your engine closer to oil-starved death.<br>  <br>  Getting it fixed is cheaper than trying to find a new/different ride.  Good luck.|`|DV4xyeChaa	several ways to handle it<br>  1 pay no attention to it...bad sending units are common<br>  2 replace sender and have mechanic test it with his gauge,, [less than 100 dollars]<br>  3 how much mileage? 150K to 200K oil pump could be bad...[maybe 500 dollars]<br>  4 running bad...may just need tune,,,has it ben done in last 80K...ck engine lite on? free scan any parts store [100 D at dealer]|`|9EgWyiNbaa	1st stop driving,every xtra mile does more damage.If u have oil then its either head gasket or oil pump on way out,big repair bill either way unless you know a friendly mechanic.|`|zOIgzIy4aa	if your hearing a knock then it,s possible that it could be the oil pump. if no knock then it could be the oil sending unit.|`|3tnVVFjHaa	if the pressure guage was not changed.it should have been done.its not a big job.

JvxrCb2Paa	Never run your truck with less than a quarter of a tank of fuel. The fuel helps keep the pump cool and a cool pump is less likely to expire prematurely.<br>  <br>  It sounds like the tank was pretty much empty and adding what fuel you did stirred up all the trash and water that has accumulated the last 13 years, water and dirt do not combust very well nor does a dirty fuel filter allow what fuel there is to pass into the fuel line.<br>  <br>  You can try some "water eliminator" and a tankful of gas to eliminate the water, but probably the best bet would be drop the tank, clean it, clean or change the filter and start over.<br>  <br>  After you get your truck running, take a class in sentence composition, pay close attention to sentence punctuation and starting a sentence with a capital letter. It makes it easier to understand your questions.|`|AA11570236	Fuel pump? don't know without looking.

Was your uninsured car parked on a public street?  If your car was totaled, his insurance will pay you the the value of the totaled vehicle.  In some states, if your car is registered, you would have gotten a citation for an uninsured vehicle regardless if it was parked on the street or in your driveway, believe it or not.  You can't have a registered vehicle without insurance - it's supposed to keep uninsured cars off the streets.|`|oReGA5kEaa	Nothing to worry about. <br>  You will need to contact the other driver's insurance company to get the claim started. It was clearly their insureds fault so it should happen fairly quickly. They should repair the car and pay for a rental while yours is being repaired. <br>  Obviously, you should get insurance before you hit the road again, but it has nothing to do with this claim.|`|978j8yySaa	You need to start with your own insurance carrier.  They will take care of you and then subrogate against his insurance later.  Give them as much info as possible, including the police report number.  They will instruct you further.  his company should get you into a rental car until your is repaired.<br>  <br>  No need to get an attorney at this point unless  you have trouble down the line.|`|B4O3f8w6aa	Should not be a problem.

Why do you want to put on another exhaust system- make noise?  Unless you're track racing a pound or 2 lighter isn't going to help.  I have used custom exhausts- my Goldwing has a set on now, it was $100.00 compared to $400.00 stock system to replace the rotted out left muffler/pipe area.

You can enlarge the pipe diameter, or you could replace the catalytic converter with a high flow catalytic converter or even a test pipe. an exhaust mod could add 10-20hp. you could also buy a hondata ecu chip for your car, but that's about $500 for the s300.  <br>  <br>  Simple maintenance things like spark plugs and fuel injectors will help and will keep you running longer with better gas mileage. also, dont forget to replace the timing belt, if it brakes, you could ruin your engine. and check your head gasket while you're at it. <br>  <br>  if you want to get serious buy parts individually for a turbo system. it will take a while but it could get you from 135hp to 300hp easily. lots of parts to buy and takes a while to install, but if you want power, you have to pay for it. sucks, but everyone's looking for a cheap 20+ hp boost.|`|5KScfgZiaa	" if you want a cold air intake, its about $200 and adds about 10-15 hp, an exhaust mod could add 10-20hp. you could also buy a hondata ecu chip for your car, but that's about $500 for the s300.

Get the excess drivetrain off and you should be able to pop the tranny off the engine without too much trouble.

AA11881683	In 1996, I owned a 1993 Toyota 4 wheel drive pick-up ( what would later be called the Tacoma ). It was a tough truck with a V-6, 5 speed trans and plenty of power. In 2001, in an impulse buy, I traded that truck on a 2001 Tacoma and, while it had more power and a smoother ride than my 1993, it lacked in ruggedness. In my opinion, it was a CAR with a pick-up truck bed on it. The "velour" interior and aluminum-foil skin was too "sissyfied" to be a truck. The suspension was weak and the truck "rolled" on the suspension in the slightest of curves. I HATED the 2001 Tacoma after owning it for less than a week and learned to hate it even more until the day I sold it a little more than a year later.<br>  <br>  In 2005, After owning a Jeep since selling my '01 Tacoma, I wanted a truck again. Toyota trucks were still too "stylish" ( obviously trying to market themselves to Yuppies or ladies, as "grocery getters" or to be used as "trash haulers" only ). I was never really impressed with the Ford Ranger, Chevy S-10, or Mazda mid-size pick-ups and, I didn't need or want a full-size pick-up. That's when I went to Nissan and saw the redesigned 2005 Nissan Frontier 4 wheel drive. The styling was remeniscent of the "hard body" styling and well equipped with a rugged interior and box. I test drove the truck and bought it the same day. The truck rides like a truck, with a comfortable but firm suspension. The 4.0 liter V-6 has plenty of power and the 6 speed trans ( unless you prefer an automatic ) is geared low enough to pull some heavy stuff from a dead stop and yet, cruise at 75 or 80 mph at roughly 2300 rpms.<br>  <br>  I've had alot of people ask about my '05 Nissan and I tell them the same as I'll tell you. Since my 1993 Toyota, this is the best truck I've ever owned and, if I knew then what I know now, I'd buy it again .... just as fast.<br>  <br>  *** Obviously, Rajan k only read what he wanted to read in my answer before making his interpretation of what I was explaining so, I will clairify for his ( and any other's, who may not understand ) benefit.<br>  The 1993 Toyota pick-up truck that I owned WAS a rugged truck and stood up wonderfully to the every-day use and abuse that I subjected it to. It WAS a great truck but, that was the 1993 model, NOT the newer models currently available which dent if you lean against them and the suspension sags if you put more than 2 shovel-fulls of gravel in the bed. The 2005 Frontier that I now have is built like a TRUCK. It rides like a truck, and handles, hauls and tows like a truck.<br>  If you want a plush car like ride and stylish, soft interior, get a Toyota. If you want a mid-size TRUCK to use for what a truck is designed to be used for, get the Nissan.|`|124b4b8b9eb2741aa2a8fa34b0a0ca52aa	If you are going to drive it everyday, go for the Toyota, it will be more reliable, and use less fuel.

I am partial to Toyota's because I trust them and everything they make.  I am going on 85 thousand miles, the maintenance is low and it hasn't caused me any grief.  The only draw back is that it doesn't have a sunroof or leather but I prefer cloth seats anyway.  I don't recommend leather in vehicles because unless your paying 80,000 dollars for it (truck), the quality of leather is not the greatest and will wear and tear more than cloth would.  I deal with leather and the moderate stuff is too thin to last.  Good Luck with your decision!

AA10470529	The advantage of gasoline is that it is a natural product of the petroleum distillation process that burns somewhat clean(no thick smoke like diesel fuel) and that it evaporates slowly (slower than naphtha the next natural product above gasoline which would be to expensive) and most importantly it is a liquid thus, making it easily transportable/handled unlike pressurized gaseous fuels.<br>  <br>  The disadvantage of gasoline is that is made from a type of petroleum not common in the US (light sweet crude) and does not burn clean enough even with current high tech and costly fuel systems. Unlike an engine that runs on gaseous fuels such as CNG(compressed natural gas) or LP (liquid propane) and others you can breath the exhaust with exception of the oxygen depletion as determined by EPA air quality standards. NO gasoline engine regardless of any add on high tech systems can come near to making this claim(unless the gasoline is converted into a true gas prior to combustion). <br>  <br>  Gasoline is truly a compromise between convenience and functionality.|`|32caa2fa7aba769d29c733ab30e70efcaa	advantage-makes cars run<br>  disadvantage-polutes the air
