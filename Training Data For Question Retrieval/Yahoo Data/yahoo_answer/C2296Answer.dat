En la rivera del ro Yuribei, el cientfico Yuri Khudi descubri el cuerpo perfectamente conservado de un beb mamut hembra de 10 000 a?os de antigedad. Este animal meda 130 cm de altura y pesaba 50 kg .      ?Cmo fue posible que despus de tantos a?os el cuerpo de la peque?a se conservara tan bien?

Introduce las tazas en el freezer de tu refrigerador. El quinto trozo introdcelo en un vaso y colcalo en un lugar seguro.    Al cabo de una semana, retira una taza de plstico, espera que se descongele la papaya y luego compara las caractersticas de la papaya de control que dejaste en el vaso a la intemperie con las de la papaya descongelada: ?tienen el mismo gusto? ?olor? ?consistencia? Anota tus resultados.    Al final de la experiencia, coloca el trozo descongelado en un vaso y ubcalo al lado del trozo de papaya de control.

Cuando ingerimos los alimentos energticos (carbohidratos y grasas), nos apropiamos esta energa, que usamos posteriormente para poder realizar trabajo.      ?Cunta energa qumica tiene almacenada un man?   La energa qumica almacenada por un man es bastante grande si no, observa lo que sucede con el fuego cuando se agregan manes a la fogata          Para poder medir la energa almacenada, podemos provocar que la energa calorfica producida por el man al quemarse sea aplicada a un fenmeno que podamos medir fcilmente: el calentamiento del agua.

fkuKUxrpaa	I was going to say you can do better than IU- Bloomington until I saw your SAT scores. I think you will get in, the average GPA is a 3.56 so your GPA is high but your SAT scores are low. Since you live in Indiana I think you will have a much better shot. It just doesn't make sense for the low SAT score, for someone who has such a good GPA your SATS don't match it. Did you study at all? You may be just like me and not the greatest standardized test taker. Good Luck!|`|AA11746917	You'll make it in. I can't imagine that your SAT scores will keep you out.

e1e36a29011a66c0ced9c09f1c2a5c73aa	You should look up what is nessesary to get a pardon in your area. I think in my area, if you go 4 years without committing a similar crime, you can get a pardon. Most employers I know of ask if you have committed a crime that you have not recieved a pardon for.     it depends on the job for which you are searching. You probably couldnt get a job in Police or Security. You would have to research your career.     I would imagine you would have better chances finding a good with a degree and a felony than with a felony and no degree.|`|AA10832878	I think it's illegal to hold a persons past against them, and especially if it has been that long ago. By you going to college, that in itself "shows" you are trying to better yourself. No, I wouldn't drop out for any reason except   medical reasons or something equally important. You are self conscious about your past, and I totally understand that. But please don't let it get the best of you and your future. I don't even know you, and I'm proud of you for   putting your past behind you.(where it belongs) Keep up the good work! And good luck.|`|89e921647df694079ac71aa80d317769aa	It will be easier to get a good job with a degree and a felony than no degree and a felony! Stay in school! Education is never unneeded!|`|AA10426312	There are a lot of jobs where a felony will be overlooked if you have a certain expertise. Technical jobs are like this. In some cases they may not even ask you on the application if you have a criminal record, although most do.    For getting a job, the most important thing is convincing your employer that you are the right person for the job. Anything you can do (except lying) to improve your case will make it easier to get a good job.     Stay in school. Get that expertise. Stay out of trouble. Don't dwell on the negative, and don't let your prospective employers dwell on it either.

Your rate of retention will be better and it's not so taxing on your brain.  Also, don't study for many hours at a time because it's more tiring like that and you won't retain much.   Take a break now and then and do something else for a spell then go back to it again.  You'll find yourself more attentive to what you're doing.

That way, it is FUN to study, and you might remember it all better if they made you squeal, scream and moan.  By the way, do you need a study partner?

Naquela poca, a Igreja Catlica dominava o cenrio religioso. Detentora do poder espiritual, a Igreja influenciava o modo de pensar, a psicologia e as formas de comportamento . A igreja tambm tinha grande poder econ?mico, pois possua terras em grande quantidade e at mesmo servos trabalhando. Os monges viviam em mosteiros e eram responsveis pela prote??o espiritual da sociedade. Passavam grande parte do tempo rezando e copiando livros e a bblia.  A educa??o era para poucos, pois s os filhos dos nobres estudavam.  Esta era marcada pela influncia da Igreja, ensinando o latim, doutrinas religiosas e tticas de guerras. Grande parte da popula??o medieval era analfabeta e n?o tinha acesso aos livros.  A arte medieval tambm era fortemente marcada pela religiosidade da poca. As pinturas retratavam passagens da Bblia e ensinamentos religiosos. As pinturas medievais e os vitrais das igrejas eram formas de ensinar  popula??o um pouco mais sobre a religi?o.  Podemos dizer que, no geral, a cultura medieval foi fortemente influenciada pela religi?o. Na arquitetura destacou-se a constru??o de castelos, igrejas e catedrais.  O feudo era a base econ?mica deste perodo, pois quem tinha a terra possua mais poder. O artesanato tambm era praticado na Idade Mdia. A produ??o era baixa, pois as tcnicas de trabalho agrcola eram extremamente rudimentares. O arado puxado por bois era muito utilizado na agricultura.

ejZvZ25caa	This is a pretty broad question. Its quite ranging.    First off,   Cordless Phones with in conjunction with your local telephone system. They require the service to be brought to them through cabling. (Category 5e is the new standard in wiring.) These phones work on frequencies ranging from 900 mhz to 5 Ghz.    Cellular phones, work in conjunction with towers that send out radio frequencies. There are several types of cell phones out there ranging from CDMA to other types. (you can easily look up the types). The way a cell phone works is that is identified by a tower, which divides its coverage area up into sections, called cells. As you move from cell to cell the tower just keeps you connected without changing much. In a way, a cellular phone is like the internet. There are entire college level classes dedicated to this topic. Also, most new cell phones operate on 3 different levels. Analog, Digital low, and Digital high. There are technical terms for the digital operating ranges you should also look up.    As for similarities, well they both let you walk around without having to drag a cord with you.|`|f6e717954d47e3850c47b18f045c5ae9aa	One difference is obvious: a cordless landline can only go a certain distance away from the base and will lose service if you go too far, while a cell phone can go anywhere globally without [technically] losing service.

m0D2Yo7oaa	1. set up equation:  25= (weight of table)  x= chair  97= both together  SO...  table + chairs = total weight  25 + 8x (remember there are 8 chairs!) = 97    2. solve  8x=72  x=9    Each chair weighs nine (9) lbs|`|9965db64b2263619de0bcd053e4da2d2aa	The other answer gives the correct answer. Here is the reason .  We know the total weight is 97 lbs and the table weighs 25 lbs.   So we take the the weight of the table away from the total which leaves the weight of just the chairs. Next we divide that weight by the number of chairs to get the individual weight of a single chair.     97-25=72             72/8=9    As a algebraic expression where X is the weight of a single chair:     8X+25=97    Because the total weight of eight chairs  and the weight of the table is 97 lbs.     To Solve subtract 25 from both sides of the equation.    8X+25-25=97-25             8X+0=72              8X=72    Next divide both sides by 8 to get X.    8X=72          8X/8=72/8        1X=9        X=9   So one chair is 9 lbs.        I hope this helps.|`|0d946b7ca354a22a67c8ab31d557c40aaa	OK    If the table 25 lbs you need to subtract that from the whole weight, because you are looking for the chairs not the table. So:    97-25=72    But 72 is how much all of the chairs weigh, not just one. So because you have 8 chairs you divide 72/8 which is=9!     Each chair is 9lbs. =)|`|952566384e6aae7c36ce415bc6b17aa1aa	97 - 25 = 72  72 divided by 8 = 9 , they are each 9 pounds or watev

Obviamente, no me estoy refiriendo a cuestiones fsicas, ya que mi comentario pasara de absurdo a risorio, sino a sensoriales.

As que, creo que te ayudara, en primer lugar, empezar a descubrir a tu pareja, acariciarla, permitir que ella te gue y te indique la presin/fuerza/intensidad con la que quiere ser tocada, para eso necesitars de mayor apertura y complicidad pues puede que requieras ver cmo ella lo hace SOLA. Talvez le agraden unos palmetazos suaves en lugar de una frotacin; o, unos tirones en lugar de una presin intensa.  Has de saber tambin, y creo que es muy importante, que el cltoris permite slo la excitacin de la mujer mas no propicia un orgasmo; por lo que si, despus de probar descubrir la forma de tocarla, nada ha funcionado y ella persiste con sus molestias, deja de lado su cltoris y cntrate en propocionarle placer en su punto G, concedindole un orgasmo sin penurias (lase fastidio en el cltoris).

e620821f0560bfd7ef97e1d0ca7b2a07aa	Vois ces liens.  Rsum mis dans WIKIPEDIA, article Ile au trsor:    Le rcit est celui de Jim Hawkins, fils dun tenancier de l'auberge ? L'Amiral Benbow ? dans un port anglais au XVIIIe sicle. Un beau jour, un vieux loup-de-mer nomm Billy Bones dbarque  l'auberge et s'y installe. Jim est fascin par le marin colrique, violent et ivrogne; d'autant qu'il semble peser sur ce dernier une obscure menace. Celle-ci se prcise lorsque Pew, un mystrieux aveugle, remet  Billy Bones ? la marque noire ?, annonciatrice de mort dans le monde des pirates. Alors que les heures de Billy Bones sont comptes, il meurt, foudroy par une crise d'apoplexie. En ouvrant le coffre du pirate, Jim et sa mre dcouvrent une carte indiquant la cachette dun fabuleux trsor que la bande du fameux capitaine Flint a enfoui dans une ?le dserte. Avec laide du docteur Livesey et du chevalier Trelawney, le chatelain du village, un navire baptis l'Hispaniola est affrt pour partir  sa recherche. Au cours de la traverse, Jim surprend une conversation entre le cuisinier, un personnage pittoresque  jambe de bois appel Long John Silver, et des hommes d'quipage : il apprend ainsi que la plupart des marins  bord de l'Hispaniola font partie de la bande de Flint et qu'une mutinerie se prpare pour s'emparer du trsor. Jim avertit ses amis du danger qui dcident de ne pas agir avant d'tre  terre tout en restant sur leurs gardes. Lorsque l?le est atteinte, la lutte sengage entre les deux groupes. Divers pisodes plus indcis les uns que les autres se droulent, et pour finir le trsor tombe entre les mains des gentilshommes de naissance. Silver dispara?t et l'Hispaniola reprend la mer avec sa prcieuse cargaison.|`|bRf0fOwGaa	Je dirais un an mais sans grande conviction, mes souvenirs sont lointains.|`|39331a1596fd5dfeb1503344ae355dedaa	je l'ai lu au collge!|`|884644f8c07242ae8af13c05c9491a3faa	J'ai lu ce livre, vers mes 10ans.

LimJh9Laaa	A teacher's assistant can do many things. It completely depends on the type of class, the way the school structures the job. There is really no way to know until you go on an interview and they give you the info.    There are TAs who are responsible for helping out with an entire class. This can be a general ed. class, usually in the younger grades, but most of the time you will find these jobs in special ed. classes. You may be an assistant for the entire classroom or for one child-1:1 assistant, which means you are responsible for that child only. Special ed. can mean so many things, too. It can be children who are very or somewhat delayed in learning, but  are physically fine. It can be children who have physical disabilities and are academically on track or a combination of any/all of these traits. You could be in an autism classroom or a classroom with multiple disabilties. One thing to keep in mind is that there are jobs that require you to change diapers, assit with toileting, feed, etc. Some children may bite or otherwise be aggressive. It totally depends on the classroom.      There are also TAs who "float", meaning that they are assigned to classrooms as needed, and again, these rooms can vary.  There are TAs who work with high school and middle school students and help them with work, esp. in small groups. I did this for a couple of years; my students were emotionally disturbed and learning delayed. This is not a job for everyone, because you need a very thick skin. However, it is rewarding!!!!!!!    Chances are, if you find a job as a TA, it will be in some kind of special ed. atmosphere. The jobs in the general ed. rooms seem to be rare, esp. with budget cuts. Make SURE you get all the info. in the interview and realize that many schools reserve the right to move their TAs/reassign as needed.    Secretaries-these jobs vary, too. You can be a general secretary for the whole school, or assigned to a specific department. These jobs are really hard to come by in my area. Some are 10 month jobs and some are 12 month positions. Some are confidential, which means more pay and much more responsibility. You are going to need great typing, computer, phone skills.    I hope this all helped! You can email me if you have questions about being a TA. One thing you should know-and this is NOT always true-is that there will be teachers who will treat you as though you are a moron. I have a BA and I had planned at the time to go into teaching so I worked as a TA for the experience. A couple of the teachers I worked with were awful-so entitled and cocky(and they were horrible teachers at that), but the rest were fine. You may find that you have to keep quiet at times. Again, not all teachers, but there are those who think they are perfect.|`|AA11746917	Well, to be a secretary, you'd have to have a ton of office skills. In addition, you'd have to answer phones, deal with parents who come into the office for whatever, and work closely scheduling the administrators appts and such. It's a huge task, and you need to be qualified for it.    An instructional aide is very different. In most districts, you have to pass a competency test of basic reading, writing and math skills. Your duties would vary according to the school you go to. You will without a doubt be working with students, either in small groups or one on one. You may also be asked to administer tests. You may be pulled to copy papers or do small tasks like that, but you'll pretty much be working with kids.    Depending on where you live, the school district may require that you speak Spanish. In my district, all secretaries and instructional aides must be bilingual.
AA11746917	Remove the word, "and"    It would read better as .......bouncing off the barrel vaulted ceiling, filling the air with the thundering boom of my Nikes.|`|l3BXn4Weaa	The question is grammatically correct, however I believe there is a spelling error in "gramatically"    Now the sentence below it should read barrel-vaulted, I think.|`|tp0XIlIbaa	Grammatically I would not alter it.... excellent.

It's sounds too lofty and melodramatic compared to what is actually happening.|`|EF69tNQHaa	It seems you are trying to include too much information in one sentence, making it sound awkward (try reading it aloud, if you have if you stumble..somethings wrong).    The second phrase (after the comma) is missing a subject.    Each step I took resonated a thousand times. The sound bounced off the barrel vaulted ceiling and filled the air with the thundering boom of my Nikes.|`|swvO4wftaa	it is perfect, very descriptive; except for the "and" remove it and be amazed! It paints a wondrous picture|`|2c2W4zQJaa	The sentence is grammatically correct.      However you are using too many descriptive adjectives. I'd cut out "the barrel vaulted ceiling" and just leave it as ceiling.
ce8l3PJTaa	In the town where I grew up, there were 3 elementary schools (grades K-5) but only one junior high (6--8) and one high school (9-12)    In the town where I teach now, they have the elementary grades divided up with K-1 at one school, 2-3 at another, 4-5 at another, then junior high 6-8 and high school 9-12.    Those were both small towns with less than 1000 students at the high school.  In the nearest city, there are 5 high schools, which students attend based mostly on what part of the city they live in.  There is one high school that specializes in math/science, so students can apply to get into that one if they have good enough grades, and there is another one that specializes more in the arts, and again, you can apply to get in that one.  The junior high school lines (which addresses attend which school) do not always match up with the high school lines, so students might end up at a different high school than their friends from junior high.    In America, schools are funded from property taxes, so you generally go to the school that your parents pay taxes to.  It is sometimes possible to transfer to a different school, but you might have to pay a transfer fee, and you would almost certainly not get free transportation (school bus) to school.    If you are writing a story, you could probably assume that most people who go to one junior high will go to the same high school, but if you want someone to go elsewhere, you could give a reason like school district lines that are drawn so they can't go.  Sometimes lines go right down the middle of a street so children who play together and live right across from eachother have to attend different schools.  Also sometimes there are several junior high schools that feed into one really big high school, so there could be a lot of new people to meet on your first day of high school.    Hope that helps.|`|fMZWxzaRaa	In California (where i live) you go to elementary school from ages 5-11, or grades K (Kindergarten) to 5. Then you go to middle school from ages 11-14, or grades 6-8. Then you go to high school from ages 14-18, or grades 9-12 (also known as freshman, sophomore, junior, and senior year).     As for going to school with all the same people, it depends on how big your city is. Like, if it's really small, you will go to school all 13 years with the same people. But if it's big, you will have a choice of 2 or 3 elementary, middle, and high schools to go to. But in that case, unless you choose to go to private school, you will have to go to certain schools that are located in the same neighborhood as your house. Depending on where your friends live, you may be split up. But you always meet new people, because as in England, several elementary schools feed into one middle school, and several middle schools feed into one high school.    Hope this helps! I'm confused as to why the other answers talk about junior high.. that's kind of an outdated term, at least in California. A few decades ago grades 7-8 or 7-9 were grouped into junior high but now it's different. So it would be incorrect to write about people going to junior high in California.|`|AA11746917	For the most part, it goes like this:     Elementary school, grades K-6  Junior High: grades 7,8  High School : grades 9-12    In the public schools, you just go to the school in the area where you live. There are exceptions of course, but this is pretty much the way it is.|`|JGZAnvUFaa	Ok, I live in Massachusetts but grew up in Ireland.  Here is a brief explanation of schools here.      Elementary - kindergarten through 5  Jr. High  - grades 6 through 8  High - grades 9 - 12    Some elementary schools incorporate jr high so kids are there til they finish grade 8.    Here each state has different rules.  Each state is divided into smaller school districts.      Many school districts have only one or two high schools with as many as 1600 kids in them.      In larger cities, the kids usually have a choice.  If you send your kid to public (free) schools, you usually have to send them to a school in your town as it is the town taxes that pay for your child's education.    I hope this helps, its a little confusing.

AA11900069	Flora and fauna (plants and animals) on Earth are almost exclusively DNA-based, and metabolise compounds found in the soil, the air,water (fresh or salt-water) and their foodstuffs, to grow and develop, and to create the DNA which passes on their genetic code to the next generation.       A biology student should remember CHONSP (cHARLES hAS oNE nASTY sINUS pROBLEM!) if they want to recall that PROTEINS such as DNA contain Carbon, Hydrogen, Oxygen, Nitrogen, Sulphur and Phosphorus.  Without enough of any one of these elements or compounds, malnutrition will cause poor growth, poor development and premature death of the fungi.

Two that I can think of right away are-  -Music Education (and you could coach something to satisfy sports interest)  -Sports Medicine/Athletic Training (many high schools are hiring full-time athletic trainers now)    I would recommend keeping yourself open, though, to taking different classes and look at options in college.

huMaqGh1aa	Possibly, but I'm not sure this would be a popular option! Seriously, it seems there are plenty of ways to get student scores to increase, but I'm thinking this is a societal issue. Basically, you've got too much "dumbing down" where nothing is expected of students, so nothing is delivered. Compare U.S. schools to those of other countries (particularly Japan!), and you'll see what I mean.|`|AA11746917	Not at all. For student scores to rise, two things must happen. The first thing is that parents need to become a part of the equation. They need to do their part to help support their child and put an emphasis on the importance of education. The second thing that needs to happen is for teachers to effectively do their job. Many students fall through the cracks because some teachers accept mediocrity. Students will do exactly what is expected of them. If expectations are low, then they will perform as such.|`|ZZZVrhqKaa	no that would just make the school year suck even more.
MAauVb37aa	Hi I recently did a Teacher Slave Auction and raised $1110!  There were actually no outlays as it was for charity our teachers were willing.  We had rules for students such as they couldnt interfere with classes, make teachers do anything immoral, or too physically demanding or cost them money etc. and we made them register to bid beforehand to ensure no fake bids.  It was a very successful event in my school and I had students organise it as part of their events management assessment for Business.  |`|AA11298562	Talent show, bake sale.

CWPUXpO8aa	i only read the first couple of paragraphs and sorry but its not that good.  in the first paragraph you have used the words spoiled child way to much! every sentence in the first paragraph uses the word spoiled, some even more then once!!!  |`|AA11298562	Not bad, not bad.  Very nice tone, I like it.  Some of the punctuation is off, and some of the sentences should be restructured, but for the most part it's good.  Just a couple of specifics:   1, Don't bring up Santa.  Believe it or not, that can be a touchy point even for adults.   We know he's not a real person, but many don't like the early disillusionment many kids go through.  Also, if you REALLY want to spoil the kid, Santa was never real except as a story, because the parents want their kid to know that the parents are the ones to give them the presents.  This example of selfishness is a great model for a good spoiled kid.   2, Your conclusion doubles back on your entire essay, it's too blatent, and it's too short.  Flesh it out, talk about how if you follow these easy steps, you'll get exactly what you deserve.|`|nMW6f9fzaa	To be honest it was not good.  Your basic grammar skills are greatly lacking, you have several run-on and fragment sentences.  I am trying to think of myself as a teacher, shaking his head in shame because he just can't get through.    All kidding aside, this is horrendous:    "After that all what you can do is to throw him or her a birthday with the excuse that its his or her older brothers birthday but you forgot about it because you are too busy looking for a cell phone that takes pictures."      There are forty-four (44) words in that sentence...    Raising a spoiled child is very easy it gets easier if you were spoiled yourself. Any parents can raise a spoiled child, having a lot of money isnt required to spoil a child. Even if you werent spoiled when you were a child its still doable to you. Here are the steps to raise a spoiled child.          First of all saying no to the child is a no to you. A 7 years old child doesnt like to be told no even if he or she was playing with knives you still shouldnt say no to her or him , but instead say  this isnt what pretty/handsome girls/boys do  . If the child wanted to be the boss in the house and give you order then you should do them with a big smile on your face, also you should tell yourself that this is what being a parent is all about. A Cell phone and an I-pod are necessary and you should not get them a fake cell phone because they can tell, 7-year-old child wants a cell phone that can take pictures and if you cannot buy it then, just give them yours.    Second, the child is not blamed for anything. If one day you think the spoiled child, is just being too much of a spoiled brat and should be sent to a religious strict school. Then you should stop that negative thinking and start thinking positive by giving yourself positive thoughts saying that you deserve this because you are the one who got that child in life in the first place. If the child broke a jar in the living room its not his fault, its your fault as a parent that you put it there according to Murphys law anything that can go wrong, it will. The child shouldnt get the blame for this because at the end of the day he or she is just a child.    Third, the child should always be invited to others parties and birthdays. It is your responsibility as a parent to socialize your child with the kids in the block. You should be informed about all the parties that go on around your area and get your child inside those parties. However if you werent informed about a party in advanced then just crush in, and just before drive your child to the party ,at the car tell the child that this party is actually for him or her but the people lost the address so they put it here. In addition, if somehow he found out that was not invited to any birthday parties its still not his fault that all kids are mean. After that all what you can do is to throw him or her a birthday with the excuse that its his or her older brothers birthday but you forgot about it because you are too busy looking for a cell phone that takes pictures. And no matter what people say, Santa is   real.    In conclusion, if the child grows up and reaches 40 years old with social, financial, mantel, psychical problems. Its still not his fault it is your. Remember?! You spoiled him/her!  |`|7sc6Jeobaa	A formal essay should be in this form:    1, Introduction Paragraph       a. your thesis statement should be the last sentance of the first paragraph.    2. Supporting Paragraphs.       a. there should be at least 2 or 3 supporting paragraphs.       b. each paragraph should have a clear topic sentence and several supporting sentences (5 to 7 is good).    3. Conclusion.       a. this should summarize your main ideas.       b. add a bit of new information at the end of your essay.    If you can get a "Writers Reference" by Diana Hacker do it! This is a valuable tool that you will use forever! It has a lot of tools that can help you become a better writer.    The basic idea for an essay is to 1. tell them what you're going to tell them (introduction) 2. tell them (supporting paragraphs) 3. tell them what you just told them (conclusion).    Try telling a funny or interesting story in your introduction to capture your reaers attention.    You have a good start here, but it needs some work. You have basic spelling and punctuation mistakes which could easily be remedied by running a spellcheck in your word processor.    Good luck and have fun with it!    Use the link at the bottom. Print it out. Write you thesis in the middle, your topics in the connecting circles, and supporting ideas in the smaller circles. From there you can transfer it to an outline and from there an essay,

I would hope you know how to find power in the resistance R1, as a function of R1, Rv, and Vs.  Then you need to find the value of R1 that maximizes the power.  Once you have part 1 then part 2 should be easy.  Perhaps this problem is meant to teach you the rule of thumb.

E finalmente, o dado mais questionvel -  necessrio ausncia de resistncia do ar, isto ,  necessrio a queda ser no vcuo.  Ent?o, as frmulas s?o as mesmas do movimento uniformemente variado, j que a acelera??o  constante, com duas diferen?as:  1. a acelera??o voc conhece a=g=9,8 m/s2  2. a velocidade inicial voc tambm conhece vo=0  Logo:  s = so + vo.t + 1/2 . a.t2 => h = 1/2. g.t2     v = vo + a.t => v =  g.t     v2 = vo2 + 2.a. s  =>  v2 =  2. g. h    Onde s  altura h e "a"  a acelera??o da gravidade g    Quando us-las. Depende da situa??o. Voc deve relacionar os dados do problema e ver o que se pede. Procure entre as frmulas, qual ou quais poder?o ser usadas pelos dados fornecidos.    Aplica??o no dia-a-dia - Em todas as situa??es onde algum corpo caia de certa altura a partir do repouso.  Voc pode, por exemplo, determinar a altura de um prdio ou a profundidade de um po?o, soltando uma pedra e marcando o tempo que ela leva para cair. Pode, no futuro, quando vc estudar a energia, descobrir qual a energia que um corpo tem ao cair no ch?o em queda-livre. Pode, o que  mais importante, estudar as quedas dos corpos reais, com resistncia do ar (um paraquedista, por exemplo) a partir do estudo da queda-livre.    Espero ter ajudado. Boa sorte!  Alberto.

Ich greife mal dein erstes Beispiel auf :    minus achtzehn, davon ziehe ich 12 ab ! Ich ziehe als 12 von 0 ab, und erhalte minus 12, minus zw?lf und minus achtzehn sin minus drei?ig.    Immer wenn du von einer negativen Zahl eine positive abziehen sollst, wirds weniger ! Minus - plus ergibt minus, muss so sein !    Zweites Beispiel plus 7 minus plus 2, lass die klammern weg, und die vorzeichen ! Du erh?lst 7-2, das kriegste ja alleine hin oder ?    Schwieriger wirds schon wenn du bei deiner dritten Aufgabe :    plus neun minus fnf unter null abziehen sollst !  Plus - minus ergibt immer mehr ! Doppelte negierung, ist wie bei der doppelten verneinung !    9 - (-5) ergibt 14    Der Grund dafr liegt auf der Hand, du hast weniger als null (-5), wenn du weniger als nichts von etwas abziehst muss es mehr werden. du verhinderst sozusagen mit -(-5) das 5 Abgezogen werden, somit erh?lst du +5, weil sich die doppelten minus gegenseitig aufheben.    Kurze bersicht zum auswendiglernen :    Plus + Plus = addieren  Plus + minus = subtrahieren  Minus + Plus = addieren (wird mehr, also n?her zur null, oder drber )  Minus - Plus = subtrahieren ( die Zahl entfernt sich von der Null )  Minus - Minus = addieren ( die Zahl geht n?her an die null)    Wenn du eine negative Zahl abziehst muss es immer mehr werden, oder eben n?her zur Null.    Wenn du eine positive Zahl abziehst, wird es ebenfalls weniger, oder eben weiter von der null weg.    Wenn du eine negative Zahl addierst, wird es ebenfalls weniger, weil du ja weniger als null hinzufgst, und somit wird weniger, oder weiter von der null entfernt.    Wenn du eine positive Zahl addierst wirds grunds?tzlich mehr, oder eben n?her zur null hin.        Kannst du dir auch leicht im Heft aufmalen ! Zum besseren Verst?ndniss :    Du markierst die null in der Mitte des heftes, und markierst die erste Zahl mit der du rechnen sollst in k?stchen im Heft. nehmen wir an wir rechnen dein zweites Beispiel anhand dieser Zeichnung    von sieben k?stechen nach rechts ziehst du 2 k?stchen ab, und gehst damit 2 k?stchen nach links.    Schwereres Beispiel (Beispiel 1 )    von 18 K?stchen nach links ziehst du 2 K?stchen nach rechts ab, somit gehts nochmal 2 K?stchen nach links !    Hoffe das hilft      Gru?

Where ever the companies absorb the executives, they always go for a PG Degree qualified guy in comparison with PG Diploma candidates.

AA11243398	The word 'conductive' means having the ability or quality to conduct.  Good food cannot actually conduct health, so i think you have misread something.    However there is another verb, 'to conduce' which means,  'to lead to,  or contribute to a result '. So I think you will immediately agree that the word you need is 'conducive'.  I hope this helps you.|`|5cef5b7fffe19af05a2309d5c9a9d24daa	The word should be "conducive".  .

KjLTciLAaa	dipende dall' universit che vuoi fare!! se ha il test d'ingresso o no!  io per entrare (l'anno scorso) ho dovuto fare prima il test d'ingresso...una volta superato...mi sono iscritta nei primi giorni di settembre!    Comunque non puoi iscriverti prima di avere superato l'esame di 5a sup perch a loro x l'iscrizione serve la fotocopia del tuo diploma!|`|fa330249ed8fb7df3c6841f44a387a62aa	va da universit e universit...sarebbe meglio prima della fine delle superiori andare a iscriversi per una pre---iscrizione..per avere il posto dopo..comunque informati nell'universit che vorresti frequentare.. ciao e auguri :)|`|FUdx353qaa	Hola^^!Dunque prima di tutto, di solito, durante l'ultimo anno delle superiori ci si va ad informare ( tanto le uni fanno degli stage in giornate precise in modo che tutte le nuove matricole possono partecipare), si prendono volantini, si chiedono delucidazioni ecc...  Poi bisogna prima essere ammessi all'esame di quinto e superarlo, ritirare il diploma e poi tornare all'universit scelta per ricevere i fogli dell'immatricolazione. Il problema per che in molte universit i corsi sono diventati a numero chiuso, quindi si devono superare dei test ( di solito vengono fatti a settembre) e poi quindi, una volta superati ( se si rientra nelle graduatorie) si pu cominciare con l'immatricolazione.   Se ti vengono in mente altri dubbi chiedi pure eh!  Ciao ciao ^^ spero di essere stata esaustiva.|`|Vg2Rxhhmaa	Per facolt senza numero chiuso fino a fine dicembre (passivi di mora sul prezzo da pagare per l'iscrizione) ci si pu iscrivere...per facolt a numero chiuso mi sembra si debba far domanda entro agosto, sostenere il test d'ingresso e poi, se va per il meglio, iscriversi definitivamente (ecco perch per le altre facolt ti danno pi tempo...se uno non passa il test non pu perdere un anno di universit!!!)  Ciao!|`|2ze3jN1Baa	al dams, dove andro io ci si puo iscrivere da luglio...e cmq la cosa migliore da fare  chiamare in sede e chiedere a loro xche varia da uni a uni!!|`|1dfd09eda78858f01ce36b44ecff6f6caa	ci sono dei tempi prestabiliti,di solito si va da agosto ad ottobre(se paghi la mora da me si arriva fino a dicembre);i termini li trovi nel manifesto degli studi della tua universit(E comunque sicuramente i tg regionali faranno duecento servizi all'apertura delle immatricolazioni).  per le facolt a numero chiuso di solito le iscrizioni ai test finiscono al massimo ai primi di settembre cos da avere modo di fare il test entro la met del mese di settembre.  durante l'ultimo anno di superiori non ti devi iscrivere,tutt'al pi fai i test di ammissione per le universit private(la scadenza per l'iscrizione al test d'ingresso alla Luiss  oggi -.-') e se passi hai gi un posto assicurato.|`|TWUxUlD4aa	Di solito in estate, oppure (soprattutto per le facolt scientifiche e tecniche) devi iscriverti verso settembre al test di ingresso.  La cosa migliore da fare in questi casi  chiedere alla segreteria della facolt che ti interessa frequentare, oppure cercare su internet nel sito dell'universit.  Hai ancora tempo, se cerchi dopo l'esame di maturit stai sicura che sei ancora in tempo.|`|JKf2CTcAaa	dipende dall'universit che hai scelto, per esempio io mi sono iscritta a giurisprudenza a settembre dopo la maturit, ma se vuoi andare in una facolt col test d'ingresso forse ti devi iscrivere prima. in ogni caso controlla sul sito dell'universit o chiama la segreteria|`|Zxi44ZRWaa	Io per andare qui all'estero, mi sono iscritto a fine primo quadrimestre della quinta.|`|SoPpLXjraa	leggi sul sito dell'universit a cui ti vorrai iscrivere. Per quanto mi riguarda, io mi sono iscritto a settembre, visto che a Ferrara, dove studio io, le iscrizioni erano aperte fino ai primi di Ottobre. Non credo comunque che ci saranno grosse differenze nelle altre universit, anche se ti conviene informarti, soprattutto se hai intenzione di iscriverti ad un corso a numero chiuso, dove le iscrizioni al test di ammissione andranno effettuate circa in luglio-agosto

Reading well constructed prose and poetry is the most powerful tool to aid your own writing style. Beyond that keep a journal. One helpful writing exercise is to write for ten minutes stream of consciousness every day. Choose the first thing you think of and describe it using words that engage the five senses and emotions. Show the writing to someone who you admire as a writer and have them tell you how well your descriptions evoke what you tried to write about.|`|e1e36a29011a66c0ced9c09f1c2a5c73aa	3 Steps to writing better, divided into percentage of time it takes.    Step 1: Read (45%)  Read lots of books  Read lots of everything else, newspapers, research articles, signs, the legal notes that come with almost everything, thank you notes in CD liners etc.    Step 2: Write (10%)  Practice constantly. Remember that the strength of a sentence is dependent on the verb you use. Use a thesaurus, use a dictionary. Don't forget to plan what to write before you write it.    Step 3: Rewrite (45%)  Read over what you have written and fix things. Change things. Adjust, shape, mould and modify. Don't be afraid to slash and burn your precious sentences.    As you can see, actually writing is only the smallest part of writing better.|`|xthMIfw1aa	Proofread your paper, and check for spelling errors.        * "Typos are very important to all written form. It gives the reader something to look for so they aren't distracted by the total lack of content in your writing." (Randy K. Milholland, Something Positive Comic, 07-03-05)         * Re-read your paper carefully, to catch garbled sentences, misspellings, etc.        * Don't rely on a spelling checker: It can't tell you whether to use "their", "there", or "they're".        * Errors that you discover when proofreading can best be corrected electronically (for word-processed papers) or by using correction tape or correction fluid.    You must hook your reader. The tone of the writing should be fresh and distinctive. Create an immediate narrative pull; make the reader want to know "what happens next?".    Use your characters to help you express your themes, and to show the reader what could be called the "message" of your novel. If the message is an angry one, take care not to hector the reader.    Setting is a particular time and place. It surrounds your characters and impacts on them. Go into a landscape in your imagination and try to paint what you see and feel with words.    Critical reading can help you become a more creative writer. Reading another writer's work can teach you other ways of thinking about the world, and other ways of writing.    There are many ways of describing characters in poetry or fiction. One way to make characters vivid is to use imagery.    Consider how other writers have used imagery in this way. You will find that moving between published literature and your own writing will give you lots of ideas about what to write and how to write.|`|fcTCydsnaa	From experience, the best suggestion I have is to actually sit with a writing teacher/professor after writing your paper and after getting critiqued, the ideas will stick with you. For example: don't ever just drop quotes in an essay, try to weave them into your own sentences. Also a HUGE help is to learn grammar inside out, almost no one knows grammar these days. Utilizing good grammar gives you a higher edge and greater respect in your writing.

Isto considerando se tratar de um experimento caseiro. Na realidade o nvel poder ser alterado em fun??o dos seguintes factos:       1) Caso a humidade relativa do ar esteja abaixo de 100%, a gua do recipiente ir evaporar e o nvel ir baixar.     2) Dependendo da temperatura da gua, o nvel poder subir ou descer um pouquinho. Como a gua ocupa seu menor volume a 4oC, se ela estiver abaixo disto, com o derretimento do gelo a temperatura ir diminuir , aumentando o volume da gua, e consequentemente o nvel. Caso a temperatura esteja acima de 4oC, com o derretimento do gelo ela ir baixar diminuindo o volume da gua, baixando o nvel na borda do copo. Porm n?o haver altera??o do nvel da gua em fun??o da diferen?a de densidade do gelo com a gua, porque, por ser mais leve que a gua, o gelo s afunda uma parte. O volume submerso do gelo corresponde exatamente ao volume de gua necessria para formar aquele bloco de gelo, portanto quando o gelo derreter a gua correspondente a ele ir ocupar exatamente o mesmo volume que estava submerso do gelo, n?o havendo mudan?a no nvel da gua na borda do copo.     O gelo  menos denso que a gua por causa dos seguintes factores:       1) Entre as molculas da gua h intera??es conhecidas como pontes de hidrognio. Como na molcula da gua h um angulo de 105o entre seus trs tomos, e como  muito grande a diferen?a de eletronegatividade entre o oxignio e o hidrognio, a molcula  muito polar. Isto quer dizer que alm dos dois hidrognios a que est ligado o oxignio (polo negativo) atrai hidrognios de outras molculas. Na gua, por ser um lquido, h movimento entre as molculas. Abaixando-se a temperatura este movimento vai diminuindo e elas v?o se organizando de tal maneira que o oxignio de uma molcula fica ligado ao hidrognio de outras duas molculas de forma definitiva atravs das pontes de hidrognio, formando um hexaedro regular que ocupa um volume maior que antes quando havia movimento relativo entre as molculas. Est formado o gelo.     2) Os gases dissolvidos na gua, podem durante o congelamento "n?o conseguirem sair" e formar bolhas dentro do bloco de gelo diminuindo ainda mais sua densidade.     3) Caso o congelamento seja muito rpido, poder ocorrer a forma??o do gelo na parte externa primeiro, com gua no interior. Quando esta gua congelar tambm aumentar de tamanho provocando fendas que poder?o n?o ser preenchidas, tambm diminuindo a densidade do gelo.|`|4076c623f0a42d6f6e328118b2e9f17daa	N?o, a gua  um elemento que fica menos denso congelada, ou seja, ocupa menos espa?o, porque forma cristais, o que n?o acontece no estado lquido.

Apesar do gelo ocupar mais espa?o que a gua, ele  um ter?o mais leve. O que isso quer dizer!?    Quando a gua vira gelo, o espa?o que ela ocupa aumenta (por isso garrafas no congelador estouram quando est?o muito cheias), e supostamente, se o copo estivesse cheio de gelo, quando o gelo derretesse, ele ocuparia menos espa?o.

So far, so good.   20- If Barbie is so popular, why do you have to buy her friends?   21- Eagles may soar, but weasels don't get sucked into jet engines.   22- What happens if you get scared half to death twice?   23- My mechanic told me, "I couldn't repair your brakes, so I made your horn louder."   24- Why do psychics have to ask you for your name?   25- If at first you don't succeed, destroy all evidence that you tried.   26- A conclusion is the place where you got tired of thinking.   27- Experience is something you don't get until just after you need it.   28- The hardness of the butter is proportional to the softness of the bread.   29- To steal ideas from one person is plagiarism; to steal from many is research.   30- The problem with the gene pool is that there is no lifeguard.   31- The sooner you fall behind, the more time you'll have to catch up.   32- The colder the x-ray table, the more of your body is required to be on it.   33- Everyone has a photographic memory, some just don't have film.

O curioso  que, quando foram encontrados os fsseis desse asitico pr-histrico, havia poucos vestgios daquele machado de pedra elaborado que o homo ergaster fazia na frica, mais ou menos na mesma poca. O motivo a gente pode arriscar uma explica??o. Talvez o homo erectus tenha encontrado l um outro tipo de ferramenta, mais fcil de manusear: o bambu.     O homo erectus vivia numa terra onde o instrumento que precisava brotava do ch?o. Pequenos veados e porcos podiam ser encontrados por toda parte do bambuzal. Mas o homo erectus n?o era um consumidor exigente.      Ampliar o cardpio n?o chegava a ser um problema para ele. Nossos antepassados, cada vez mais inteligentes, continuavam a se espalhar por todo o planeta. Ser que j podemos consider-los t?o desenvolvidos como ns? Ainda n?o. N?o  bem assim que caminha a humanidade.     Vamos acelerar a marcha do tempo. Um milh?o de anos mais tarde, ou seja, 500 mil anos atrs. E testemunhar um fato incrvel, que prova como esses homindeos ainda eram muito diferentes da gente.     Estamos na frica de novo, a terra do homo ergaster. Viajamos rumo ao futuro, mas nossos parentes ficaram presos ao passado.      Esta  a carca?a recm abandonada de uma presa. Adivinhe com que ferramenta o   homo ergaster cortou a carne do animal? A mesma que ele usava um milh?o de anos antes:   um machado de pedra biface.    A tecnologia n?o avan?ou, mesmo depois de tanto tempo.  difcil imaginar uma maneira t?o limitada de pensar. Isso n?o quer dizer que nossos antepassados eram burros. Apenas que o crebro deles n?o funcionava como o nosso. Ainda havia muito o que aprender.     Para mudar essa maneira de pensar, foi preciso que o homem descobrisse algo extraordinrio: o fogo. N?o se sabe nem quando nem como isso aconteceu. Mas em algum ponto da histria, os homindeos aprenderam a usar o fogo. Assim, eles puderam se aquecer, se proteger dos predadores e ainda cozinhar os alimentos. Foi uma conquista gigantesca na evolu??o. Como nenhum outro animal antes, o homem passou a dominar o mundo.     Com o fogo, a noite j n?o trazia mais tantos perigos e diminua a necessidade de se esconder ou lutar. Uma das hipteses discutidas pelos especialistas  a de que essa descoberta mudou n?o apenas o modo de vida dos nossos antepassados, mas tambm a forma de pensar. O fogo teria dado ao homem dois elementos preciosos: oportunidade e tempo. Para imaginar, sonhar. Para a mente viajar.     Era o que o homo ergaster precisava para evoluir: imagina??o. Essas pessoas deram origem h milhares de anos depois a uma nova espcie, outro personagem na histria da evolu??o.|`|01f623d1a9b607fcd79ca605bd4e40a8aa	Um raio caiu em algum lugar e provocou um incndio, ele foi l pegou um peda?o de t?co de rvore pegando fogo e aprendeu a p?r fogo em outros galhos ..... simples|`|Re65vEZFaa	Foi para poder acender um cigarro.rsrsrsrsrsrsr|`|c1959faa19be9096a61470c6cfb5b72daa	Ningum aguentava mais carne crua!

Na primeira palestra, Nilson Mello, diretor da Meta Consultoria e Comunica??o, empresa de assessoria de imprensa, procurou fazer uma abordagem segmentada, analisando: 1) A importancia da imprensa para a sociedade; 2) Porque interagir com os meios de comunica??o; 3) Como interagir de forma saudvel (o papel das assessorias de imprensa); 4) Alguns desafios especficos na rea de sade privada; 5) Vencendo Barreiras.    O jornalista salientou o papel que a imprensa tem desempenhado no pas como olhar onipresente do povo, ressalvando que, mesmo cometendo erros, o saldo do trabalho jornalstico tem sido positivo na defesa dos interesses da sociedade e na consolida??o da democracia.    Mello lembrou ainda que toda a sociedade  indivduos, empresas, institui??es pblicas e privadas  est permanentemente produzindo informa??o bruta, que  a matria-prima com a qual o jornalista vai trabalhar. J Vidor destacou que o bom jornalista  aquele sempre disposto a ouvir novas fontes e a checar informa??es.    Lembrou ainda que a imprensa no Brasil vem amadurecendo e buscando ocupar um espa?o de forma mais analtica, com maior equilbrio. Aps o encerramento das palestras, houve debates com a platia. O seminrio faz parte de uma srie de iniciativas que SINDHRIO e Senac Rio tm desenvolvido, em conjunto, nos ltimos anos, visando a contribuir para um maior e melhor intercambio entre institui??es do segmento de sade suplementar (privada) e meios de comunica??o, contribuindo para a melhoria das informa??es acerca da sade no Brasil e de seus desafios.    Neste sentido, as duas entidades est?o promovendo este ano a 3a Edi??o do Prmio Alexandre Adler de Jornalismo em Sade, cujo objetivo  valorizar o profissional que se destaca na cobertura da rea de sade  seja com matrias de carter social, cientfico, econ?mico ou cultural  e est?o organizando um talk show entre os segmentos de Jornalismo e Sade.|`|c1959faa19be9096a61470c6cfb5b72daa	A imprensa brasileira  uma porcaria.

c1959faa19be9096a61470c6cfb5b72daa	Mitologia Celta.|`|zjVDc8XQaa	A constela??o Orion  composta pelas estrelas Betelgeuse, Bellatrix, Alnilam, Alnitak, Mintaka, Saiph e Rigel.    Estudos cientficos permitiram chegar s seguintes conclus?es:  1 - Os antigos egpcios da 4a dinastia eram adoradores de estrelas e tinham mais conhecimentos sobre estes corpos celestes e astronomia no geral do que se supunha anteriormente.  2 - Que as trs grandes piramides do planalto de Giza foram planeadas como um todo. Os Egiptologos acreditam sobretudo que estas foram construdas tendo como base uma simbologia das estrelas, e n?o para servirem como tumbas funerrias.  3 - Por ltimo, que os antigos egipcios eram profundamente espirituais e que a sua arquitectura  um meio de express?o das suas cren?as.    O que gerou estas conclus?es:    Sobrepondo uma planta (mapa) do planalto de Giza e um mapa estelar da constela??o de Orion, foi possvel conclur que as estrelas Alnitak, Alnilan e Mintaka coincidiam com as grandes piramides Menkaure, Khafre e Khufu.    Para informa??o mais detalhada e imagens aceda  fonte.    Ainda:    "A CONSTELA??O DE ORIONTE Quando no cu outonal, tornado lmpido pela chuva e pelo vento frio, surge Orionte, o observador pode deleitar-se com um dos mais belos espectculos que o cu nos pode oferecer. As suas muitas estrelas, juntamente com as do Touro, dos Gmeos e as brilhantes Sirius e Capela, lembram diamantes postos no veludo escuro do cu.   Objecto de admira??oem todos os tempos, Orionte , com a Ursa Maior e as Pleiades, das constela??esmais antigas. Com excep??odo "carro" da Ursa Maior, o "cintur?o de Orionte"  provavelmente o mais conhecido e o mais popular de todos os grupos estelares. O nosso povo chama-lhe "as 3 Marias" ou "os 3 Reis Magos". Nos antigos catlogos, Orionte  representado por um ca?ador brandindo um ma?o, enfrentando o Touro celeste.Tem aos ps a Lebre e seguem-nos o C?o Maior e o C?o Menor.     O nome Orion vem do sumrio Uru-anna, a Luz do Cu, ttulo do heri caldeu Tamuz, o filho do Sol, que se ter tornado no Adnis grego dos tempos clssicos. Cerca de 5000 anos a.C., o "cintur?o" de Orionte come?ava a ser visvel, de madrugada, no ms de Tamuz (Junho). Era tambm neste ms que se celebrava a morte de Adnis. Homero descreve Orionte como "o mais alto e belo dos homens" e esta descri??oadapta-se tambm a Adnis. No pante?o assrio-babilnio, as estrelas principais eram personifica??esde deuses; a multid?o de estrelas n?o classificadas constituia "o rebanho do cu", cujo pastor era a constela??ode Orionte.       Na mitologia egpcia, as almas de Osris e de sis haviam-se imortalizado em Orion e Sirius, respectivamente. No Zodaco de Denderah, Orionte, smbolo do deus Sol Hrus,  representado num barco cercado de estrelas, seguido por outro barco conduzindo Stis, a estrela Sirius.     Numa lenda grega, Diana, a deusa-Lua, apaixonou-se perdidamente pelo belo e hbil ca?ador, passando muito tempo com ele. Seu irm?o Apolo, o deus-Sol, furioso ao v-la negligenciar os seus deveres de ca?dora, enviou um escorpi?o para matar Orion. O escorpi?o mordeu Orion, que caiu ferido mortalmente.Zeus para consolar Diana, colocou Orionte entre as estrelas. Assim a deusa-Lua pode v-lo quando viaja no seu carro de prata. A base astronmica do mito  o facto de a constela??ode Orion se p?r exactamente quando a constela??odo Escorpi?o nasce, tal como se este perseguisse o heri. Noutro encantador mito grego,  a deusa da madrugada, Aurora, "a dos rseos dedos" no dizer de Homero, que persegue Orionte com o seu amor. Orionte foge. No cu de Inverno, quando Orion se p?e no mar a oeste, as suas estrelas desvanecem-se muito lentamente, ou seja, a madrugada tenta ret-lo para poder ficar mais tempo a seu lado. Ao desaparecer Orionte, a Aurora derrama lgrimas amargas, que podemos ver nas flores, na relva, nas rvores de manh?: as gotas de orvalho.     Como constela??ode Inverno, Orion estava associado ao mau tempo. Eneias, refere-se-lhe, ao relatar a tempestade que o apanhou na costa de frica no seu caminho para Itlia. Polbio, o historiador grego (sc. II a.C.), atribue a perda da esquadra romana, durante a 1a Guerra Pnica, ao facto de terem navegado j depois do "nascimento de Orion". Tambm Cam?es a isso se refere nos Lusadas, Canto X, 88: "E do Orionte o gesto turbulento".     Situado numa zona excepcionalmente rica em objectos celestes interessantes e acessveis para as observa??es, Orion  a constela??opara onde se apontam em primeiro lugar todos os telescpios. Alguns dos mais conhecidos:      Ori, Betelgeuse (o ombro do gigante)  uma supergigante vermelha; se ocupasse o lugar do nosso Sol, incluiria Marte no seu interior;      Ori, Rigel (a perna do gigante), mag=0,1, a estrela mais brilhante da constela??o,  tambm uma gigante, mas branco-azulada;      Ori, Belatrix (a guerreira, a estrela amazona), mag=1,6;      Ori, 5h 39m -3o mag=3,8  um dos mais impressionantes sistemas estelares mlti-plos.

e1e36a29011a66c0ced9c09f1c2a5c73aa	I notice that a lot of your sentences start off with the word 'The', consider varying sentence structure more. Also, a lot of your sentences could be combined into, longer, more efficient sentences. For example:    The Sniper is a short story by Liam O'Flaherty. It is a war drama set in Dublin during the Irish Civil War. It takes place on a day in June in the early 1920s. The main character, the sniper of the title, is described as...    and so on an so forth.    The quote starting with "He took steady aim..." and going to "...the enemy had been hit"  doesn't seem to fit with any of the points you are making. Take a look at the other quotes you use and how you use them, because most of them are used fairly well.     The last sentence is good, but it would be better if you  said "The theme of this story is that war is a horrible thing that..." and then the rest of what you have. It's much tighter. The phrase "the author is trying to tell people" really doesn't add anything. It's just empty words. We can assume that the theme is what the author is trying to tell us, that's what a theme is.     It's pretty good for early grade 9, but could be much better. |`|OwHkNEuBaa	This is just a style thing, but I would combine the first two sentences to make it more interesting/stronger. It seems weak to just state what the story is in the first sentence. You could say "The genres of the short story The Sniper by Liam O'Flaherty are drama and war. (Or leave the "and" out like you did - either way works).     Next sentence... um.. i don't think you should say "around 1919 to the early twenties on a day in June." I don't know the story, but i would leave out the 1919 part. Its not necessary.    Next sentence... don't capitalize "The Sniper." instead of saying "the sniper he is described..." say "The main character of this story is the sniper, described as..."    Don't capitalize "sniper" after Republican.    Reword your last sentence... say something like.. "The author's purpose in writing the short story is to show what a horrible thing war....." It just sounds weak the way you said it.        Please note that the style changes are simply my opinion, and that there are many ways of writing well, none better than any other.|`|NCD8XWL0aa	First of all, don't use the same word to many times times in a row to begin a sentence. For example, you use "the" in the begining too much. ( First few sentences)    Talk about interesting parts of the story. I doubt your teacher wants to read about what genre it is.    In the "death many of times" part, remove the "of". Don't use too many words; be concise.        Word choice-use a thesaurus!    Where's your conclusion and what's the resolution of the story?    Maybe you could add your opinion on the story and analyze the author's style of writing. Add your voice to make more interesting!    Combine some short, choppy sentences    Don't forget a transition before " He took a steady aim"! because you suddenly change the subject.      This last quote describes him as feeling upset and obviously shaken to have killed his own brother     Instead of "the other character of this story is the Republican sniper, his enemy," use "The antagonist of this story is the Republican sniper. Don't forget to describe the enemy and how he hinders the protagonist.    At the end, don't use the word "thing" or "good"! If you don't use those words, you'll sound more educated.    This is how your paragraph should be organised:  1. Intro- describe explosition  2. Body- describe main conflict and climax  3. Conclusion-theme, resolution, and maybe your opinion on the story    Hope i was help =D|`|LnAj6Mqvaa	  I am writing about the short story The Sniper, written by Liam OFlaherty.  The genre of this story is war, and the drama that takes place within this. (YOU COULD DO WITH MORE INFO ABOUT THE GENRE, JUST  A FEW MORE WORDS)    The story takes place in June, 1919 (FIND THE EXACT DATE) in Dublin, Ireland, during the Civil War.  The main character is The Sniper, whom is described as having a face of a student, thin and ascetic.  In the beginning of the story, he is described as a cold man who has seen death many of times.  Later on in the story, we see a different side of him, when his feelings of remorse for shooting the Republican Sniper, are revealed: He took a steady aim. His hand trembled with eagerness. Pressing his lips together, he took a deep breathe through his nostrils and fired. He uttered a cry of joy. His enemy had been hit. (THIS SEEMS TO CONTRADICT WHERE YOU SAY HE FELT REMORSE; THIS QUOTE PORTRAYS HIM FEELING JOYFUL).  Maybe just use the other quote - The Sniper then walks over to the body. He threw himself face downward beside the corpse. The Sniper turned over the body to see the face of his brother.    (I WOULD SAY A LITTLE BIT ABOUT HIS ENEMY BEFORE NOW, MAYBE AT THE BEGINNING WHEN YOU EXPLAIN ABOUT THE SNIPER)    This last quote portrays him as feeling disturbed (THIS IS A BETTER WORD THAN UPSET) and obviously shaken to have killed his own brother.     (NEW PARAGRAPH) The theme the author is trying describe (BETTER WORD) is that war is a horrifying thing and that it can turn good people into monsters and separate families.  |`|Elxuvon8aa	do not start a |`|xiM5P5mzaa	Could you tell us what this assignment is?

If you have a 3.452 by the end of your 3rd or 4th year in college, you will be in good shape to enter the graduate PT program.  Your chances will be pretty good.|`|0d78Nuleaa	Yes, that's really good. Keep up the good work, you are going to be fantastic at your profession. Good luck with your studies.|`|7UlGCzzeaa	yea you're doing fine. just try to get a few more better grades to boost it up and DONT, no matter what, DONT slack off your junior year
FVDhYH6Baa	its okay  i got a 171, and i'm pissed  but we have time to make it higher  i did the psat without prep and stuff  but when you take the psat in your junior year  try doing prep in the summer for it    if you got a 138 without any prep, that's a pretty decent score.|`|lvAEDKPBaa	Honestly it's not that great.    But luckily you're only a sophomore so you have time to improve!|`|McmrqRLbaa	They say if you add a zero to your PSAT score, that's the score you'll get on your SAT score.    So supposedly you would of gotten a 1380/2400  430/800 for crit. reading  440/800 for math  520/800 for writing    This is a pretty low score.  Make sure that if you are unsure of your answers, leave them blank.  You will lose no points if you leave them blank, but if you lose 1/4 of a point if you get a question wrong.  It adds up at the end, trust me.  Try to get SAT prep. books and study them, and do the practice tests, or sign up for SAT prep. classes to increase your SAT scores.  You'll be surprised that they actually work.
AA11029380	I believe they are very often over medicated.   They go to more than one Dr. and they don't know what they are taking.  Or one will change a medication and the person keeps taking the new and the old.  They also can forget if they took something and take even more.  Of course there is also the opposite....they don't take any medications because they forget or can't even afford to get them in the first place.

L3hc9EOiaa	Taken From the speech, March 4th 1933  Only Thing We Have to Fear Is Fear Itself: FDRs First Inaugural Address  Franklin D. Roosevelt had campaigned against Herbert Hoover in the 1932 presidential election by saying as little as possible about what he might do if elected. Through even the closest working relationships, none of the president-elects most intimate associates felt they knew him well, with the exception perhaps of his wife, Eleanor. The affable, witty Roosevelt used his great personal charm to keep most people at a distance. In campaign speeches, he favored a buoyant, optimistic, gently paternal tone spiced with humor. But his first inaugural address took on an unusually solemn, religious quality. And for good reasonby 1933 the depression had reached its depth. Roosevelts first inaugural address outlined in broad terms how he hoped to govern and reminded Americans that the nations common difficulties concerned only material things.

Z1nAEBadaa	Okay, the quote when read in context is talking about how the mockingbird just sings sweetly where as the other birds cause trouble. Basically this quote relates to how convicting an innocent man is a sin  and the guilty ones should be convicted (relates to the trial).    Relating this to life, Atticus is basically advising Scout to not assume someone's guilt until proven guilty. In our society,  We assume someone's guilt due to predjudices that control our society, but Atticus is saying never to hurt the innocent (which can be related to the killings of civilians in wars etc).    Basically the quote relates to society in the difference between truth and opinion.    Hope that helped :)

Colleges buy lists of addresses from the CollegeBoard - they can specify that they want all test takers living in states A, B and C, who have certain specified interests and scores between X and Y.  They send out materials to everyone on that list.  It doesn't mean that you're particularly more likely to be accepted, but it should tell you something that your scores fall within the ranges that they've chosen to target!

3OoCiOkAaa	There is nothing wrong with being happy.    But happy all the time is a problem.      Simply because life is not great everyday for everybody. People will sometimes need support, sympathy and a shoulder to cry on.      If all you want to do is talk about yourself and how great you are - you are what is known as a superficial personality. You have the inability to see the world from anyone else's point of view.      So when you are sad you CRY  But when other people are sad, you ignore it or don't see it because it doesn't affect you. You are HAPPY!        I don't think people are jealous of you and I don't think all the men in the world find you attractive You see the world from your perspective only.        What you have can be great, because you can really brighten up a party and a dull day.      But  when you are sad, you want people to give you- what you are unable to give support, advice and comfort.        You want people to see the world through your eyes only. This is not going to happen.      You have a sense of being the victim and exploited. But your personality exploits others.      People do not think you are TOO happy. They think you are inappropriately happy or selfish.       My best advice is too tone down your happiness and observe the general mood, before you start your happiness skit.      I wish you well- personally I find people like yourself tiresome. As I have a life-time of people with your personality around me, because I am the opposite.       I had a friend like you in her forties and everyone she met was jealous of her beauty , brains and personality. They weren't really. If anything she was jealous of other people and was a terrible flirt.      She has  made enemies out of some very decent people. She will end up very lonely.      You don't want to be like that. So try  asking questions and listening to people's answers.  And please stop thinking people are jealous of you. They are not. Be happy but appropriately HAPPY.      I am only  able to write this as I am not a happy happy person.    Some of the people at your  school are like this too!. The are not happy all the time because they are helping others when they need it.        You have a narcissistic personality disorder and sound histrionic.      This means your emotions are extreme, melodramatic, theatrical and sometimes hysterical.      People are treating you normally, but you like adoration. When people do not adore and love you or do what you want you see it  as abuse, disloyalty or jealously.  People are NOT NOT abusing you. They are like that with everyone.       You do not have a  mental illness, this is your personality.      Sadly people like yourself are incredibly disloyal and hold terrible grudges. So you will get through a lot of friends in your life. But as long as you don't falsely accuse people of stuff ( which is common with your personality), you just have to listen and look what is around you.      Look up' Histrionic' personality and you will pretty much fit the bill.      You don't  work well in a team unless you are leading it. You like attention and while you don't like people . You desire or need them to love you. That is your personality.|`|FE4j9aqAaa	Whoa calm down drama girl! Why does it matter what they say about you? Or what they think about?

OOyVDDDXaa	Brooklyn Tech High School     Building and facilities  Brooklyn Technical High School    The school, built on its present site from 1930-33 at a cost of $6 million, is 12 stories high, and covers over half a city block. Brooklyn Technical High School is directly across the street from Fort Greene Park. Facilities at BTHS include:        * Gymnasia on the first and eighth floors, with a mezzanine running track above the larger first floor gym. The eighth floor gym had a bowling alley lane and an adjacent wire-mesh enclosed rooftop sometimes used for handball and for tennis practice.      * 25-yard swimming pool      * The school has a ping pong arena and team      * Wood, machine, sheet metal and other specialized shops. A program in the 1960s involved a shop where an actual house was built and framed by students. Most have been converted into normal classrooms or computer labs, except for a robotics shop.      * Foundry on the seventh floor, with a floor of molding sand used for creating sand casting molds and equipped with furnaces, kilns, ovens and ancillary equipment for metal smelting. Students made wooden patterns in pattern making which were used to make sand molds which were cast in the foundry and machined to specification in the machine shops. It was closed during the 1990s.The foundry complemented a mandatory course titled "Industrial Processes" which emphasized metallurgy and "how industry functions".      * Materials testing lab, used during the basic materials science (Strength of Materials) class. Included industrial capacity Universal Testing Machine and brinell hardness tester and polishing and microscopic examination rooms. During the 1960s, students attended "inspection training shop" and were taught to use X-ray analysis to detect metal fatigue failures, use of vernier measuring instruments, micrometers, and go-no-go gauges.      * Aeronautical lab, featuring a large wind tunnel, During the 1960s, a T-6 Texan U.S. Air Force surplus aircraft in the building was used for student aeronautical mechanic instruction.    Radio transmitting antenna atop school        * Radio studio and 18,000 watt transmitter licensed by the Federal Communications Commission as WNYE (FM). The studio has not been used since the 1980s.      * 3,100-seat auditorium  Second-largest in New York City next to Radio City Music Hall, with two balconies      * Recital hall      * Drafting, both pencil and ink technical drawing and freehand drawing rooms      * Library with fireplaces      * Football field on Fulton and Clermont Streets. The Football Field, named in honor of Brooklyn Tech Alumnus Charles Wang, was opened in 2001, with the home opener played October 6, 2001, against DeWitt Clinton High School.      * Access to Fort Greene Park for outdoor track, tennis, etc.    A 456-foot (139 m)-tall rooftop broadcasting antenna, when added to the height of the building itself (145 ft), makes Brooklyn Tech the borough's tallest structure, at 597 feet (182 m) high.[12] It is 85 feet (26 m) taller than Brooklyn's tallest building, the 512-foot (156 m) Williamsburg Savings Bank.    In 1934, the Public Works of Art Project (PWAP), which later became the Works Projects Administration (WPA), commissioned artist Maxwell B. Starr to paint a mural in the foyer depicting the evolution of man and science throughout history.    Brooklyn Tech's founder and first principal, Dr. Albert L. Colston, had an apartment built for himself in the tower of the building, and was the only person to live at Brooklyn Tech.[citation needed]    In December 2006, developer and New Jersey Nets owner Bruce Ratner proposed a new building for Tech as part of the basketball arena he is constructing at the Atlantic Yards. The building will reportedly be able to fit about 6000 students.[13]    Brooklyn Technical High School, commonly called Brooklyn Tech or just Tech, and also administratively as High School 430, is a New York City public high school that specializes in engineering, math and science and is the largest specialized high school for science, technology, engineering, and mathematics in the United States. [3]    Together with Stuyvesant High School and Bronx High School of Science, it is one of three original specialized science high schools, operated by the New York City Department of Education, all three of which were cited by The Washington Post in 2006 as among the best magnet schools in the United States.[4] Admission is by competitive examination though, as a public school, there is no tuition fee and only residents of the City of New York are eligible to attend.[5]    Brooklyn Tech is a founding member of the National Consortium for Specialized Secondary Schools of Mathematics, Science and Technology. Brooklyn Tech is noted for its famous alumni(including two Nobel Laureates), its academics, and the large number of graduates attending prestigious universities.

2aTlzYSLaa	Bronx Science! The classrooms are awesome. They have like computer desks and projectors in each room. The workload for a freshy is not that bad. Honors Bio and Ap world might be a challenge and only apply if you know that you can take it. If you are in a decently good school and your work habits dont change, you will be getting about the same exact grades in all your classes. The teachers are all nice but some are quitting.  http://www.ny1.com/Default.aspx?ArID=919...  take a look at that while you are at it. The area is not that bad but not amazing so dont take too many chances and try to always go out with 2-3 friends. The school is an open campus so you can leave and go anytime and even like go around the neighborhood and be back in time for your next class.Personally, going to bronx or stuy is tedious, but in the end you get a special diploma (well at least in bronx you do) it is called a bronx science diploma and looks way better than a zone or even a private school diploma. Workload wise, freshman year is manageable but dont take it too easily. If you are getting 90s in the school you are in, there should be no problem getting 90s in science!|`|1mKJFfieaa	Townsend Harris...That School is good and Its hard to get into you have to be like an ooober Genius or something.

aSgmiIk3aa	Well when you factor a trinomial,  You need to multiply the 2 numbers at the end of the trinomial.  So that you know the 2 x's that would add up to 3x.  So in this case, it'd be the product 2 with the factors 1 and 2.  They add up to 3, so they would work.  So you would get 2x^2 + 2x + x + 1,  Which would equal 2x(x+1) + 1(x+1).  Because you have to find a common factor between each pair of numbers.  And the common factor is 2x^2 + 2x is 2x.  And the common factor is x + 1 is 1.  And that's how you would get 2x(x+1) + 1(x+1).  And then you would need to group them together,  So you get (2x+1) (x+1)|`|eMensPe7aa	Explanation? I'll try I haven't done this in a while:  When you factor 2x^2 the only factor can be 2x and x   the only factors of 1 are 1 and 1   so if you plug these in and get (2x+1)(x+1)  FOIL this out and you get 2x^2+3x+1  to finish factoring you set them equal to 0 (each side) so 2x+1=0  subtract 1 and divide by 2 and x= -1/2  the other side would just be x=-1  I'm not sure how far you have to go with this equation but in most cases this is usually what you need.|`|7959WbC2aa	The key is remembering that the initial number is 2x^2, that means any factoring will have the look of:(2x+ )(x+ ). Also, when factoring +1, the only possible factors are +1,+1 or -1,-1. Since the middle figure is positive, you know the factors will have the look of:(   +1)(    +1).|`|O9y2K7x8aa	You can use the Magic X & Punnett Square.     Magic X:  Multiply "a" (2) and "c" (1) for the bottom   I think. The top   is "b" (3). Think of what 2  s multiply to be 2 and what can add up to 3.     Punnett Square:  The top-left square should be 2x. The bottom-right square is 1. Then plug in your 2 numbers into whichever box. Then you find common numbers/variables for the row.
ToLylKXNaa	I fully agree with this quote. Once a person obtains power, it can destroy nations. "Absolute power corrupts absolutely."~John Dalberg-Acton. For example: Hitler, Saddam, Lenin, Stalin, Mussolini, and Idi Amin who destroyed people, countries and were soulless. This just names a few men with power. So it is better to deserve power, but not have it.|`|KSAbA57Haa	Yes I agree with that. It is just common sense, if you stand back and look at it again you will see it.

IK925thzaa	A faster but unpleasant method of stopping an addictive habit, such as drugs or alcohol. It means that you just totally, completely stop, and never do it again (or at least try to).     Going cold turkey is opposed to stopping it by gradually doing it less and less, or stopping it with help like special gum or medicine. You don't get any help; you just stop.     Ex.  Lydia tried to smoke only one cigarette a week, but she ended up going back to her old habits.

AUkuRqP9aa	To eighth graders: Consider the type of person you are before making your decision to go a specialized high school. Are you already an achiever in middle school, or are you middle of the class that got lucky on the SHSAT? Stuyvesant (and I can probably assume the same for the majority of specialized high schools) isn't really that worth going to. The competition is cut-throat and the workload is intense. I'm not trying to discourage you from going to a great school, but do you think you have a chance of being top of the class at a specialized high school? If not, you'll be one of those mediocre students in a specialized h.s. who suffer for 4 years and end up going to a local college, or less than prestigious one (by mediocre I mean low 90 average; only about 30-50 students per grade get above 95 in Stuy w/ a real shot at a prominent college; if you can't make 90, as most in Stuy cannot, then you have almost no chance). Only the top 50 or so students really make it to the prominent colleges. So think deeply about how you want your next 4 years to be. It can be really hard with a really high chance of being outperformed (specialized h.s.) or it can be really easy and you'll probably graduate top of your class with a good shot at a good college (nonspecialized h.s.).    Extra things you might want to consider: Chances are you will wake up at 6AM and commute for at least an hour, standing. Homework takes forever, especially when piled on top of extra-curriculars. The majority of good students (94+) stay up really late, past 12AM, sometimes to 2 or 3, and some don't sleep. Those who sleep at 10PM and wake up at 7-8AM have it too good and chances are they have a low 80 average.    Sorry for spamming, but I really want to get my point across.|`|oP8krEBiaa	that was like 5 or 15 points away. the only way is to take it again next year. good luck.|`|JkUmwa8uaa	That's pretty close.

A way to get into tech is to retake the SHSAT again as a ninth grader. Another option you could take is participating in the Summer Discovery Program in the summer if your score is close enough to the cut-off of your desired school. Participating this program might allow you to have a seat in Tech. Some students actually got a seat in a specialized hs. by participating the program. Ask your counselor about the Summer Discovery Program or for other options.

3OoCiOkAaa	Yeast infection or thrush ( not thrust)       Dear Sir,    My daughter has been absent from  class for the last three day  class  due to an illness( yeast infection  -you don't have to put this in). She is now recovering slowly but has experienced irritability and mobility problems.    I hope this has not caused your program too much inconvenience.    Yours  Sincerely    Mrs Grown-up          ( You don't have to mention the itchiness just say irritability and mobility sounds far more medical than walking)       Tell them the facts without being graphic.      You don't really sound like a parent from what you have written, but I love your letter and had to help you.       Edit : I didn't  think you sounded like a parent.                Just say mobility and irritability . Mobility is movement and irritability is itchiness. They are more sophisticated and adult. A grown-up wouldn't say 'itchiness' in a letter or 'walking'.      Yeast infections are not caused by dirtiness and neither is thrush.      I would tell you mother or a school nurse as these conditions are easily treated and can be incredible uncomfortable if they are left untreated.  They do get worse. You probably only need some anti- fungal tablets or cream. Fungal infections can come back- women have them all the time. Don't be scared. It's very natural.      You wouldn't be scared if you had athlete's foot so thrush or any gynaecological problem shouldn't make anyone angry with you.      Hope you are okay. If I could see you wording sounded childish so can the teachers .

You can get them from diet imbalances or wearing a wet swimsuit for too long or for all sorts of reasons.  Don't keep suffering!  Talk with your mom.

Maybe one of a child sitting cross-legged, one of a child raising his hand, one of a mouth with a line through it to show no talking out, etc.. I would review it with the child, perhaps let him hold it during circle time as a reminder and immediatly after circle, review with him how he did using smiley faces or sad faces.

g8JGLnk6aa	It can refer to all holy books in a general sense, or it can be used to refer to one specific holy book. You capitalize it when you are using it to refer to a specific book and consider it a proper noun.|`|HIMsPI8eaa	It depends on who you're talking to.    As a Christian, I think of "scripture" as the Bible alone.  But if you were talking to a Muslim, however, they would call the Quran scripture.  I generally think when it is capitalized it refers to the Bible, but then again, it depends on the context.

SIhxrxD3aa	Well if you really want to be a professional debater than you should go to law school.  They are really the only ones that will debate for a living.  To go to law school you will need to get another degree in undergrad, but it can be in anything.|`|LRbWZhvnaa	Yes.     Although "debating" is not a college major.     There are similar majors, like drama, speech, and communications. You can earn BA, MA, PhD in these subjects..    Also, your college may have a "debating club" for recreation.|`|87205565883af1c8c01259e7e0cc22f6aa	You sound so young, and naive. But, we were all there.    Anyway, debating isn't really a profession. However, lawyers "debate" against the opposing lawyer in a court case, so law would be the closest thing to debating. You would have to spend 4 years in college getting your Bachelor's Degree, and then 3 years in law school to get your JD (Juris Doctor degree). You need 7 years of education (4+3), and it'll cost into the $100,000s.
14YGePYoaa	Here are some good websites for ideas about your biology project    http://biology.about.com/od/biologyscien...  http://biology.about.com/od/biologyscien...
sFGUlPhMaa	Look up something that you are interested in, and that you might know a lot about.      For example if someone really liked Yahoo answers, you might put "On average a question on this site is answered within 1 day", or "Math questions get answered 3 times faster than questions about mowing the lawn"    If you like something alot and know something about it, you can look up certain details that other people might find interesting, and report some statistics about it.    I like Monster Trucks, so I might find it interesting to know how long on average it takes to build a Monster Truck, or how long on average it takes someone to learn to drive a Monster Truck.  I would like to know how much money it takes to fix a Monster Truck after a roll-over accident.  How many people share my fondness for Monster Trucks, etc.    Always pick something you find interesting, it will be easier for you to finish your research paper if you know the subject or want to know the subject, and I love to teach other people about things I find interesting.      Hope this helps get you started in the right direction.|`|YQHJ5JyNaa	How about print it on papers with backgrounds already? I have seen them at Office Depot with light colored numbers on the background. Or you can find some paper with the topic you are working on to print on. Borders add a nice touch too.   Some teachers like hand drawn pictures on the side even if the drawings are not good, but others prefer them perfect. If that's the case, try printing out pictures from computer.  Always include a front cover page to make it look professional.|`|gaXUIduMaa	What grade are you in?  Grade school, High school, or college?  Although there is not much you can do there are two methods.  In grade or high school, put a story around it.

Knowing the dosages for the different age groups, the captain brings up the population statistics of the town and ...  In college, they would rather see a neat paper, maybe with a binder but nothing fancy like wierd borders, etc.  What would make it more interesting is to point out some interesting facts that you found out that one would not know (the idea here is to show that you read and actually studied the subject rather than downloaded someone else's paper).
nv0nIj3Daa	yeah.. Hate to bring you to reality but school isnt the most fun thing in life. Okay? Unless you enjoy studying over hanging out, reading over talking with friends, school, and good grades isnt going to be fun!|`|olt7hv1caa	There are definitely ways to make learning and getting good grades fun. First of all, do you have any subject that you like particularly? Its okay to not have one. Not everyone has to be school smart. What are your hobbies? Im sure there is at least one subject that you have that relates to what you like to do. Also, it depends on the courses you take. Are you in high school? High schoolers usually have choices on what they want to take. If youre a middle schooler, dont worry so much because grades dont really matter till high school where colleges look to see how well you do. Another problem might be that you might be stressed out and not have enough fun time? Dont let schoolwork bog you down. Do the things you enjoy. It keeps you happy and you will be in a better mood when you do your schoolwork. Besides, school isnt that bad, no matter which one you attend. You have friends, teachers that you like, etc. And if its totally horrible, be creative and make it fun :)|`|ftYZ6tpYaa	Make studing FUN.

746f05d46ba1221dac446d278ccdbc21aa	Hey there -- I'm currently searching for the very same thing! From what I have heard, many nursing homes will train you for free, provided that you agree to work for them for about two years thereafter. If you don't mind working at a nursing home, just call up any and every one that is in your area.. it can't hurt to ask!    A woman who is in my A&P class told me that St. Catherine's trained her for free. She has been working for them as a CNA ever since she became certified, and she is currently going to school to become an RN -- which St. Catherine's is paying for! Sounds good to me! :)    There is also a man in that same class who works at St. Francis as a Phlebotomist, and he says that they have offered the free training in the past, though he isn't sure if they are currently in need of any CNAs.    If you don't mind me asking, which hospitals have you applied to? Had they told you that they would train you for free?    Good luck in your search! Let us know how it goes!      Edit: I just checked St. Catherine's website, and it says they are currently offering free CNA training. It is a 9-week program, 4 days a week. The classroom portion is Monday through Thursday, from 6:30pm to 10:30pm at the St. Catherine Nursing Home, and some clinical rotations are held at the Good Samaritan Nursing Home. Also, you are not required to work for St. Catherine's once you become certified (which, in my opinion, makes it a pretty sweet deal.)    I wish that I could do nights because this sounds really great.. if nights work for you then you should totally go for it!

4d6dba47634b4acba784daac36b3d669aa	NYU is a dream school for a lot of people.  Mostly because the Village is one of the best neighborhoods on the planet.      In my experience, very few people get in with 3.0 gpa's.  Of course, a few do, but these are generally people that have incredible talent in one particular area, along with a huge passion to study that area.  So unless you can bring something in addition to A's in language, I am sorry to say that I don't think you will get in.   You would probably need to show some extraordinary talent or experience in the language area.

8R5L10Lwaa	1. haploid = the number of chromosomes an organism has       diploid = twice the above number (it accounts for homologous chromosomes)    2. they undergo meiosis because if they just split once, then their offspring will twice as many chromosomes as it needs (meiosis halves an organisms chromosomes, 2 halves = whole)    3. Independent assortment is basically that whatever mix of genes that an offspring gets is random ( this helps in variation because it means everyone* gets a different set of genes)        *everyone except indentical twins|`|d2fVJ4Ouaa	haploid means 23 chromosomes, produced through meiosis  diploid means 46 chromosomes, or a full set. these are produced through mitosis.  just remember that "hap" sounds like "half", and 23 is half of 46.    sexually reproducing organisms have to undergo meiosis so each gamete only has 23 chromosomes. When two gametes meet up, the 23 chromosomes on each are added together, forming a zygote with 46.    Look through your notes. You'll learn better.  This is simple stuff.

If you argue without listening to the other person, you are basically rudely ignoring them and they deserve to be heard out. You wouldn't like it if someone was arguing with you but they were acting like a know-it-all and weren't listening to your side of the story because they're too worried about being right.|`|5oAU7S9zaa	How can a person argue if they don't know both sides?

dbTPyM7Yaa	Rarely! If they are college students, maybe, but only if the bullying is very violent. Most bullies want attention, and haven't learned how to appropriately get it.     Try other remedies first: bring the bully and the person they were bullying into the class room alone with you. Ask the person who was bullied if they liked how the bully treated them. You may have to encourage the victim to speak up, but get them to admit they didn't like being treated that way.   Once you have obtained that admission, ask the bully if he or she heard what the other student said. They will eventually have to admit they heard it, even if you have to have the first student say it more loudly. Then you need to orchestrate the admission that the bully wanted the other student to play with them, talk to them, or other appropriate activity.     Now you ask the first student if he or she would be willing to play with the bully if the bully agreed to play fair. If they agree, you get the bully to promise to play properly. This forges a new friendship. They both wanted this friendship, and now it begins. Do keep your eye on them for a while. Sometimes the bully has been so bullied him or herself they cannot quit.|`|L4eoLmvJaa	yes, depending on the age of the students involved and the severity of the act|`|YymOCkWQaa	Most of the time I would say of course not, but there are exceptions. The reason we go to school is to "Learn", and understand why things are okay, and why things arent okay. Instead of assuming a student is horrible, It would be rather better to take them aside and say "Look, What you are doing is wrong, you are emotionally/physically hurting your peers." And things of that nature. Now depending on the severity of it, That can change, if a student pushes another student because that student thinks they can get away with it, there's no cause for arresting. However if a student were to threaten to harm another child unless that child did something for them, then yeah, they should be put under the possibility of arrest.|`|hc89tLJcaa	Yes, depending on the age and whether or not the bullying involves violence. Bullying can emotionally scar a child for life.

Xh3Q8jqXaa	To become a pharmacist you are required two years of pharmacy pre-requisites. After those two years you will enter a 4 year pharmacy program, after finishing those 4 years you have the option to do a year of residency or, go straight into the line of pharmaceutical work. However, it is often recommended to do residency.    Pharmacists generally work in hospitals, stores, drugstores, and doctor's offices. They usually have fairly flexible work hours, which is a definite plus! Another plus is their starting salary! Straight out of college you could be making about $90,000.00 annually!     As far as how hard is college for a pharmacist-to-be: FAIRLY CHALLENGING! It's similar to becoming a doctor but not as long as a process. You will need to learn the anatomy and definitely the physiology of the human body! Also, TONS of different types of medication and their difficult names! How they work for the body and how they help the body. You'll also need to know which are harmful, and which are harmful when combined with OTHER medications. So it will be tough work and require a lot of memory skills but if you are motivated, intelligent, and dedicated you can do it! Goodluck|`|2sXqm4u9aa	First off, I am not a pharmacist.  My husband was a pharmacist who graduated from the University of Texas in Austin (1970).  It took him 5 years to get his Bachelor degree.  Now, the pharmacists coming out of college come out with a PharmD degree which take 6 years and they actually have the title of Dr.  Pharmacy has changed over the years and it al depends on what type of pharmacy setting interests you.  You have retail, hospital, research, nuclear.  They are starting to specialize in areas such as diabetes, heart condiitons, etc.,  There is the time coming when you will go to your pharmacist for treatment of certain diseases and they will be ones adjusting medication, talking to your doctor, etc.  Even so, the lifestyle is good, you come out of school pretty much making the same amount all the other pharmacists are making.  Just really depends on what you want out of it.  Pharmacy school isn't easy, if you are not scientifically or mathmatically inclined I wouldn't go there.  If you are then it should be ok for you but it is still hard due to the amount of information you have to retain.  My husband died just a few months ago so don't get me wrong when I say he was smart as a whip but had no common sense.|`|VZFEB85Iaa	well, i'm not sure but i want to be a pharmacist when i get older :D|`|760d2895bd058b74a7e6023ceaf0ed2aaa	u can apply after your first year u need the PCAT tho
a36a4f0aa2d7f129af1802cbaa36ec85aa	My advice to based on the Architecture Accreditation Board is to go the cheaper route at University of Michigan. Both are accredited programs which is very important. If you do not attend an Accredited program you will have to spend 4 years in college with an additional 2/3 years in a grad program to even be eligible to sit for your professional license.  While students attending an Accredited program are eligible to sit for the exam after graduating from the Accredited institution. Unfortunately, both schools only offer an MArch(a masters/graduate program) program, but it appears to be a 5-year program which is not bad at all.   Blessings on your journey!|`|vF5lU8zeaa	www.badlands.com

Which means your brain is ugly as these are where the thoughts come from.       Or      You are just really stupid and your brain is deformed (ugly)        Language is transient and forever changing.

AA10439008	The common denominator is (4n-3)(4n+1) so to be able to combine the two expressions on the right, multiply the first by (4n+1)/(4n+1) and second by (4n-3)(4n-3).  Then add the numerators to get an equation.    1 = A(4n+1) + B(4n-3)  1 = 4An + A + 4Bn - 3B    Now A and -3B have to add up to the 1, and since the first has no n term, 4A + 4B must add up to zero.  So solve those 2 equations    A - 3B = 1  4A + 4B = 0 multiply row 1 by -4  -4A + 12B = -4 then add them    16B = -4 so B = -4/16 = - 1/4  plug in to get A; A = +1/4|`|7959WbC2aa	start by multiplying each side by ((4n-3)(4n+1)), gives you    1=A(4n+1) + B(4n-3)  For A:  A(4n+1)=1-B(4n-3)  A= [1-B(4n-3)]/4n+1  For B:  B(4n-3)=1-A(4n+1)  B= [1-A(4n+1)]/4n-3|`|yDc9X7jXaa	you cant. you cant solve for more than one variable in an equation unless you have the values of the rest|`|5sFqsQlOaa	A=1/4, B=-1/4|`|zoPw7isJaa	may be you need to clear the variable...    for A is:        ( [1/((4n-3)(4n+1))] - [B/(4n+1)] ) * (4n-3) =  A    then doing the operations you get     ( [1/(4n+1)] - [ (B*(4n-3)) /(4n+1)] ) = A    doing the fractions        [1- B*(4n-3)] / (4n+1) = A    then if you replace this in the original equation:                                     1/((4n-3)(4n+1)) =   ( A*  )  /(4n-3) + B/(4n+1)                                     * here you need to replace    maybe you can found A and B

AA11515948	"Youse" is used in many different parts of a lot of countries.  We also say "y'all", "you guys", "you lot", etc.  So in a way, most of us have a plural for most of the time.  If we don't use it, that's usually because in the context it's obvious whether we mean singular or plural.    Plurals aren't that important anyway.  Plenty of languages get by without using them at all.  And what is so important about the number one that we need separate words to distinguish one from two or three or four, but we don't need to distinguish between two and three or four?

For my junior year, I chose ap english and chemistry. English, simply because I was in honors in sophomore year and wanted to go onto the next level. I learned hell of a lot. I can write now! For chemistry, well, my sophomore year teacher was awesome. She made me like chem soo sooo much!! so I chose Ap chem junior year. I had an awesome teacher for ap chem too. Got a 4 on the AP. ^ But then my friends who had another teacher for ap chem had to work their asses off.     I'm now a senior and I only have AP BC math. IT is...SOOO HARD!!!!!!!! I have a 75 in that class, whereas in my other years, i have 95+. But, you know, I dont regret it. I learn so much more than the AP AB math class and regular classes and even if i do not score a 4 or 5 on the AP, I'll probably do fine in college too.

When you're changing an improper fraction to a mixed number, you divide the numerator (the first number) by the denominator (the number after the /). You will then have a number next to the remainder over your denominator, since you will not be able to divide them evenly. For example, 25/4 would be 6 1/4; 4 goes into 25 6 times, with 1 left over.    To write mixed numbers as improper fractions, you sort of do the opposite. Multiply the denominator by the whole number, then add the numerator. For example, 10 3/6 would be  63/6; 10 times 6 is 60, and this added to 3 is 63.    Apply these strategies to your homework and you should get the right answers.|`|3T6wvAamaa	5. 2 3/7; 6.4 5/11
eMV9qrLnaa	ok lol this is gonna take a bit,, if you want me to go step by step find me on facebook. but ill just give you the answers    1) -3x2-8x-4=0.   ok you can factor this to find the roots    (x+2)(-3x - 2) = 0    x = -2 or x = 2/3    2) -28x2-32x  ok you can factor this as well    -4x (7+8x)  x=0 or x = 7/8    3) The function y= -16t2+424 models the height y in feet of a stone t seconds after it is dropped from the edge of a vertical cliff. How long will it take the stone to hit the ground? Round to the nearest hundredth of a second.    ok if the stone is on the ground, the height has to be 0    sooo 0 = -16t^2 + 424  -424 = -16t^2  26.5 = t^2  5.14 = t    4) Write the number in the form a+bi  -36+5      -36+5  5 + 6i    uhhh ill someone else answer the rest lol|`|NevFFHf4aa	1. is called a second-order polynomial (second order because the highest power is x^2) to find the answers, use the quadratic formula follow the source link below to see the quadratic formula. You will have 2 answers.  2. factoring simply means find what both terms have in common that you can multiply the terms by and separate it out. looking at just the numbers in each term, they are both divisible by -4. Looking at the variables they both contain at least one x. so writing -4x(7x+8) is the same as what you started with if you distribute the -4x through the terms in the parenthesis.  8)25x2+49=0  25x^2=-49  x^2=-49/25  x=sqrt(-49/25) note:the square root of a negative number will give you a complex answer (i)  9. use the quadratic equation to get 2 answers  14. use the quadratic equation. you will get 2 answers. if one is negative, you obviously cannot produce a negative number of products, the answer will be the positive number.

Born January 17, 1706(1706-01-17)  Boston, Massachusetts   Died April 17, 1790 (aged 84)  Philadelphia, Pennsylvania   Nationality United States   Political party None   Spouse Deborah Read   Children William Franklin  Francis Folger Franklin  Sarah Franklin Bache   Profession Scientist  Writer  Politician   Signature    Benjamin Franklin (January 17, 1706 [O.S. January 6, 1705]   April 17, 1790) was one of the Founding Fathers of the United States of America. A noted polymath, Franklin was a leading author and printer, satirist, political theorist, politician, scientist, inventor, civic activist, statesman, and diplomat. As a scientist, he was a major figure in the Enlightenment and the history of physics for his discoveries and theories regarding electricity. He invented the lightning rod, bifocals, the Franklin stove, a carriage odometer, and the glass 'armonica'. He formed both the first public lending library in America and first fire department in Pennsylvania. He was an early proponent of colonial unity and as a political writer and activist he supported the idea of an American nation[1] and as a diplomat during the American Revolution, he secured the French alliance that helped to make independence possible.    Franklin is credited as being foundational to the roots of American values and character, a marriage of the practical and democratic Puritan values of thrift, hard work, education, community spirit, self-governing institutions, and opposition to authoritarianism both political and religious, with the scientific and tolerant values of the Enlightenment. In the words of Henry Steele Commager, "In Franklin could be merged the virtues of Puritanism without its defects, the illumination of the Enlightenment without its heat."[2] To Walter Isaacson, this makes Franklin, "the most accomplished American of his age and the most influential in inventing the type of society America would become."[3]    Franklin became a newspaper editor, printer, and merchant in Philadelphia, becoming very wealthy, writing and publishing Poor Richard's Almanack and the Pennsylvania Gazette. Franklin was interested in science and technology, and gained international renown for his famous experiments. He played a major role in establishing the University of Pennsylvania and Franklin & Marshall College and was elected the first president of the American Philosophical Society. Franklin became a national hero in America when he spearheaded the effort to have Parliament repeal the unpopular Stamp Act. An accomplished diplomat, he was widely admired among the French as American minister to Paris and was a major figure in the development of positive Franco-American relations. From 1775 to 1776, Franklin was Postmaster General under the Continental Congress and from 1785 to 1788 was President of the Supreme Executive Council of Pennsylvania. Toward the end of his life, he became one of the most prominent abolitionists.    Franklin's colorful life and legacy of scientific and political achievement, and status as one of America's most influential Founding Fathers, has seen Franklin honored on coinage and money; warships; the names of many towns, counties, educational institutions, namesakes, and companies; and more than two centuries after his death, countless cultural references.

i5FP4Vbraa	The use of the word BASTARD is indicative of the teacher's inability to control the class full of kids.    Using the word 'bastard' is unacceptable.  A teacher who did so here in UK would be severely punished for it.    A bastard is a child born out of wedlock and is not a word which has any other meaning or use other than to point the finger at a person and make their peers dislike them.    There was an old Victorian trick in schools here in England of a teacher choosing one child in the class to be the scapegoat.  That child, right or wrong,  got all the flack and abuse.    I hope this is not the sort of backward thinking which goes on in Japanese schools?

As a teacher - I always leave way too much knowing that I'd rather the sub leave things undone then try to have to fill "dead time."  I would have been very happy that you chose a "more important" assignment to finish.    That being said, some teachers have things that they feel they want done.    Besides, truly, it's the impression you make on the fellow teachers that is way more important.  They are the ones that are going to let the absent teacher know their impression of you.    When you start any job - ask a team mate if they have any advice on how to prioritize in case you can't get to everything - do they the teacher expect you to cover everything, etc.      And really - your classroom management skills and professionalism will carry a lot of weight with teachers.|`|aFUIxvenaa	The space bar, learn to use it.|`|aqto0hJTaa	You're fine.

WcNlTVs0aa	Child development refers to the biological and psychological changes that occur in human beings between birth and the end of youth, as the individual progresses from dependency to increasing independence. Because these developmental changes may be strongly influenced by genetic factors and events during parental life, genetics and parental development are usually included as part of the study of child development. Related terms include developmental Psychology referring to development throughout the lifespan and Pediatrics, the branch of medicine relating to the care of children. Developmental change may occur as a result of genetically-controlled processes known as maturation, or as a result of environmental factors and learning, but most commonly involves an interaction between the two.  Age-related development terms are: new born (ages 01 month); infant (ages 1 month  1 year) : toddler  (ages 13 years); Pre  schooler (ages 46 years); school aged children (ages 613 years); adolescent (ages 1318). However, organizations like Zero to Three and the World Association for Infant Mental Health use the term infant as a broad category, including children from birth to age 3, a logical decision considering that the Latin derivation of the word infant refers to those who have no speech, The optimal development of children is considered vital to society and so it is important to understand the social, cognitive, emotional, and educational development of children. Increased research and interest in this field has resulted in new theories and strategies, with specific regard to practice that promotes development within the school system. In addition there are also some theories that seek to describe a sequence of states that comprise child development.|`|MJU2FkxYaa	Child development is how a child's abilities in the cognitive, motor, social, and emotional areas get better over time.

You could also choose one person or thing to focus on and speak to it throughout the presentation, things sort of begin to fade away if your focusing on one thing.     Also, practice a lot and be confident that you know what your presentation is saying. GOOD LUCK!

Know what you want to say very well so that you have more confidence in knowing what it is your talking about. Keep your feet about shoulder width apart (keeps your body steady), remember that you don't have to look at the people in the class, look above their heads if you have to. Try to relax before you have to go up and look around the class and reassure yourself that, yes you do have to get up but really, its not that bad, everyone had to.    Hope this helps and good luck!!|`|IsoAYxucaa	have fun and think of things that make you confident|`|EyDRA53kaa	just think of how good it will feel when your finally over and done with it.  i always get SOOO nervous before a presentation but i've learned that things are never as bad as you think they will be.
oLhAi73caa	You can take up to 6 A levels, no college would offer any more than that.     If you're getting a few As, mostly Bs I would recommend doing 4 or 5 A levels, but talk to the college you are applying for.|`|tWZOUXA1aa	Well I think it depends on how much work you're prepared to put in.    The normal at my school is 3 A levels plus one in general studies(so 4 really ) and 2 AS Levels.    Not sure what It's like in other places though, I go to a grammar school so it might be different for comps, colleges etc    Universities only ask for 3 usually, but if you want to you can probably do as many as you-and your school- think you're capable of.|`|yE81qpcraa	You need to take a minimum of 3 A-Levels to be classed as a full time student. The maximum amount of A-Levels you can take at one time is down to personal choice. Most sixth forms and colleges recommend picking 4 A-Levels during your first year, however, some students choose up to 6 A-Levels. It's really all down to the individual.
pXUFfDvPaa	you should pick single dorm     having double dorm would be a bit of hassle? because more than one roommate living    I don't know but try to keep with few people like one roommate is fine but more than two can be a hassle       A Sorority is best to avoid because all they do (of what I seen) is party all day and do nothing, but it will distract from your studies      But this is all my opinion, I can be wrong or right    you should go research on what you like to live in    some people like sorority for partying   some people like double dorm for saving money/friends  some people like single dorm for quiet than two people living/friends, etc....    Some people like to commute (apartment)    so you should research on what you like to live in|`|bc80b085beb98b92a6819181843ddbbbaa	I would suggest a roommate for your first year of college, it really helps.  I had 4 roommates my first year and one is still a great friend.  However, if you are very outgoing then you can live in a single and you will still make friends.  Most sororities don't allow first years to move into the house, it's limited.  However, you may go to a school where all the girls live in the house.  My sorority only had 14 girls who could live in the house and we had over 100 members.
JoU7WTadaa	Be creative. Are you outgoing? If so, try something bold like putting a big sign out by the road that says "HEY SKATEBOARD BOY [lol] do you like me?" or sit on your porch til he comes back again and stare back. Or yell HEY SEXY next time you see him, just for the hell of it. Break outta your shell, girl.|`|vcWuPlOyaa	XD ha ha ha ha XD|`|uQosyhrSaa	can u plz ask him CAZ i dont know him.  ohkay  how r we suppose to know???if we dont even know him  he probably does this to every girls house...and ur freaked out  CAZ he looked at u.

Don't know what that means?  That is why you should be in school.|`|QfTEYT3zaa	Oh my goodness, that is hurting my brain. Have you heard of punctuation? Spelling? Grammar?

2qbLrHBKaa	I would suggest creating a name using typical newspaper words like Daily, Sun, Times, Herald, combined with something dinosaur like  the Jurassic Times, Tyrannosaurus Sun, the Daily VelocoRaptor, the Brontosaurus Herald, (okay bad examples but you get the picture)-- actually I really like the first one-- but you can choose whatever name you like, it's your fictitious newspaper|`|xKVMbHoKaa	that sounds cool but i'm not sure what voracious means. if u don't know what it means then maybe u can try ferocious.|`|KPFOlwwaaa	Yea, actually thats a very good name i suggest you keep it, it sounds really good!|`|QAZSzMRvaa	Cool rhyme - but it doesn't really sound like the name of a newspaper.     I think "The Cretaceous Times" is better.  Get it? The Cretaceous is an era of time, the "Times" is a common ending of a newspaper, i.e. "The London Times" etc.

lQIKWXDuaa	OK. The best thing about being a pre-med is that you can major in anything you like and still get into med school.  I was a pre-med who majored in Biology. I did research while an undergraduate student. Then I decided to pursue my MD-PhD. I applied for the PhD program first, after obtaining my degree I decided I did not want to pursue the MD anymore. Now I want to become a nurse practitioner. The best thing about college is you can major in anything while you complete the pre-med requirements. Remember not everyone with a 4.0 GPA + 40+ on the MCAT+ excellent extracurricular activities + great letters of recommendation get into medical school. My best advice to you is pick a major that you can fall back on just in case med school does not work out or that you later change your mind. I wish I had majored in business. A business degree will also prepare you for managerial position in a hospital or to run your own private office. The process of becoming a medical doctor is very competitive. You definitely need to have a competitive personality at every step in the process. By the way there are other great careers that you can do to make money. You can become a business executive without having to spend so many years in school and you will make more money than a doctor per year.    SS|`|LoXvNBEmaa	hard-working. you sound generally interested in pre-med so i don't see why you would stop liking it any time soon.  also don't doubt yourself if you really want to do this, it will be your downfall, just like it is a downfall for attempting to do anything.|`|vmgu7bbeaa	Personality traits of a successful med student/good physician:  Driven, determined, intelligent, compassionate, reliable, decisive, etc.     This is no small decision to make. Most med student are over-achievers and work very very hard for a very long time before making any "real" money...so absolutely don't do it for just the money- you will be dissappointed (as will your patients because you will be an awful doctor).    I'm a cardiologist. Here's a breakdown of my education/training to give you an idea of the time committment:    Undergrad- 4 years  Med school- 4 years  Internal medicine residency- 3 years  Cardiology fellowship- 3 years    (that's 14 years of higher education!)

VeJLXLXjaa	You got a 561? You should have gotten into Stuyvesant, and not Brooklyn Tech. You should ask your guidance counselor, there could have been an error.     I hear that cutoff scores are decided like this: They take the amount of seats available people with the highest scores, the cutoff is the lowest score that was taken. You could apply for a round (when people get a school but decline it, there are more seats available, so you could get in)|`|OWHo5eayaa	it isnt a mistake. the cutoff was 563. my friend was 563 made it in and a guy with 562 didnt.  561 was last years cutoff score.|`|0jnYKfTHaa	It's not necessarily if you make the cut off score or not. It's probably because there wasn't any room for you. Lets say 500 people can get into stu. 500 people who took the shsat put stu as their first choice and got 570 and above. Although you made the cutoff, your score was lower than the 500 people.|`|JkUmwa8uaa	That probably wasn't the cur off score, but your score is pretty high. So be happy with what you got b/c some ppl like me are dying even for tech.|`|zL82Cn8Iaa	omfg i got a 561 too and i didn't get into stuy either n dat waz my first choice!!!!!!
efYvOfv4aa	This is an exact answer to the cut off score for brooklyn tech 486-488  As for what the discovery program its basicly if you scored near the cut off score (example 483) you take some courses over the summer and if you pass 2 tests at the end of the course you have a high chance of having a seat. Talk to your guidence consuler and ask him more about it. Usally you have to 1- be close to the cut off score and then theres more requirements. If you do get in congrats just pass the course and do good on the test, good chance ur get in =)|`|xKVMbHoKaa	if u got ur score, shouldn't it tell u if u've been accepted? im sure it's close cuz their cutoff is like 4xx im not sure how much though. u can wait until u get ur letter. if u got the letter and it didn't say u've been accepted, then u aren't accepted. just cuz u pass the cutoff doesn't guarantee that u get in.|`|24caf12fd1a85e2a135854e193a0cba2aa	I got mine back and I got a 478, I didn't get into Brooklyn Tech so I think the cutoff score is 480something.
NM7cjcroaa	i dont want to burst your bubble but the cutoff was like 480 for tech. but, you can still ask your guidance counselor if u can do the discovery program. i got my results back yesterday. i got into tech (521).|`|BXmWcKOoaa	The cut-off for Tech was around 480-490ish. I think their definition of "close" is like a few points away from the cut-off.   The Discovery program is only for people who meet the requirements.  You can check this site-  http://www.k12academics.com/shsat_depart...     Good luck & hope this helps! ?|`|bNp4Ym93aa	think the cutoff score was around 490 or so.  I got a 511 and got into S.I Tech  The summer discovery program is if you score close to the cutoff score. Sometimes the school will have summer classes you can take so you can attend the school next year. I think you have to meet some requirments to be in the SDP. Check wikepedia.|`|2S65qVM3aa	to get into the program you need to meet the requirements and i think one of them is that you have to come from a low income family. Ask your guidance councilor so you can get more information|`|lk9vMY1daa	the cutoff changes every year and its getting easier?
UWUVp1Zeaa	So you applied to two colleges and got rejected... then got accepted to another college that you didn't apply to?    I got "accepted" to a college I had no interest in going to because of my ACT scores.  You'd still have to send an application, but if you don't want to go there... don't bother.      Unless your application changes somehow, you won't be accepted for a different semester to those two other colleges.  Try retaking the ACT/SATs if that was the problem or talk to an advisor there and see what they suggest.    If you want to take a half year off... go for it, but I know people that have, intending on going back, and they are still out of school, 4 years later.    Good luck.

If you do nursing can you handle being around and looking after sick people all the time, people with bad injuries and bad tempers, people who are scared, unsure, worried? You will also be working in shifts so you have to take that into account. If so then go ahead and do nursing!  For psychology you help people deal with a lot of their problems. You can get people who are violent, aggressive, withdrawn etc. You have to try and figure out what is going on in their minds and try to help them. There may also be a lot of traveling involved so you might need your own car (if you haven't already).    There is a lot more to consider but it really is up to!    Good luck with your decision!

There are many ways to join independent clauses including using semicolons; colons; periods; coordinating conjunctions and a comma; or subordinating conjunction, which makes one sentence depend on the other, that is, a dependent marker.      Here is a few ways you can link these sentences together to make them more interesting to read.    When we went to the beach, we stayed there all day drinking pepsi, eating twinkies, and building sand castles. However, once it got cold, we went home feeling tired; that night, I slept like a rock.       While we were building sandcastles, we drank pepsi and ate twinkies.

He is often known as the "Alton Giant" because of his Alton, Illinois hometown. Wadlow was noted for having the largest and broadest hands ever in recorded history being capable to hide a 2-litre bottle of soda in them easily.    Wadlow reached 8 feet 11.1 inches (2.72 m)[1][2] in height and weighed 490 pounds (220 kg) at his death. His great size and his continued growth in adulthood was due to hypertrophy of his pituitary gland which results in an abnormally high level of human growth hormone.

C5PAlvoiaa	The problem is further compounded by the separation of literature from history and of both from political science in this age of academic specialization, creating policymakers ignorant of the very books that explain places like Haiti and Somalia far better than any social science "methodology." While the usefulness of history is accepted and needs no elaboration, the usefulness of literature is less so among the policy elite, even as Marco Diani, a senior researcher at the Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique in Paris, writes that, "The anguish of any society can be found in its literature, often earlier and more clearly revealed than in its social sciences."(1) That is because the future lies inside the silences, inside the very uncomfortably sensitive issues that people are afraid to discuss at dinner parties for fear of what others might think of them. And yet it is a principle function of social science to accumulate information precisely on what people are not afraid to talk about in front of a researcher's tape recorder (which is also why conventional journalism is often the most deceptive form of reporting on a society).

And in literature's vast canon there is no book of which I am aware that both defines and dissects the problems with the world just beyond our own as well as Joseph Conrad's Nostromo: A Tale of the Seaboard, a 1904 novel about Westerners and indigenous inhabitants of an imaginary South American country, Costaguana.(2) Nostromo is neither overly descriptive and moodily vague like Conrad's Heart of Darkness, nor is its ending entirely unhappy. For a civil society-in-the-making does emerge in Costaguana, but it is midwived by a ruined cynic of a doctor who has given up on humanity, a deeply skeptical journalist, and two bandit gangs, not by the idealist whose actions had helped lead to the country's earlier destruction. Conrad never denies the possibility of progress in any society, but he is ironic enough to know that "The ways of human progress are inscrutable", and that is why "action is consolatory" and "the friend of flattering illusions." Charles Gould, the failed idealist of the novel, who believes absolutely in economic development, "had no ironic eye. He was not amused at the absurdities that prevail in this world."    Nostromo is at once Conrad's best and most difficult work. It is rather long, 465 pages of small paperback print, and to skim it for even a few paragraphs is to risk losing the thread of the narrative. In this media-obsessed age - when "intellectuals" spend their evenings watching C-SPAN and CNN - people may be better acquainted with Heart of Darkness than with Nostromo only because the former is exceedingly short, as well as amenable to skimming, on account of a thin plot and lengthy landscape descriptions. In Nostromo, however, landscape ambiance is a tightly controlled, strategic accompaniment to political realism. The book is Conrad's "statement on what he thought of as the truth about the world", writes Martin Seymour-Smith in his introduction to the Penguin Classics edition.    It is a tribute to Conrad's insight that his description of Costaguana and its port, Sulaco, captures so many of the crucial tidbits and subtleties about troubled Third World states (particularly small and isolated ones) that foreign correspondents of today experience but do not always inform their readers' about, because such details do not fit within the confines of "news" or "objective" analysis. There are, for example, the handful of foreign merchants in Sulaco, without whom there would be no local economy; the small, sovereign parcels of foreign territory (company headquarters and embassies) to which people flee at times of unrest; and the obscure army captain who has spent time abroad hanging about cafes in European capitals, and who later finds himself back home, nursing resentments, and at the head of a rebellion provoked by soldiers who drink heavily. There is, too, the "stupendous magnificence" of the local scenery - what Conrad calls a "Paradise of snakes"; the conspiracy theories begot by deep isolation and the general feeling of powerlessness and "futility"; and a wealthier, more developed part of the country that wants to secede because its inhabitants are even more cynical about the political future over "the mountains" than any foreigner. Conrad shows us, too, how bad forms of urbanization deform cultures: "the town children of the Sulaco Campo", for instance, "sullen, thievish, vindictive, and bloodthirsty, whatever g|`|Vk1FoxsRaa	They both include rough voyages.
C5PAlvoiaa	Its a fact: other peoples lies make our lives more difficult. They distort and twist the truth, con us into believing things never happened, or took place when they shouldnt have. There are literally thousands and thousands of ways peoples untruths and falsehoods taint and make living our daily lives more of an effort than it really should be.  So what can we do about it?  How can we put a stop to lies the second we hear them and reveal the real truth, the actual facts, the exact situation?  The answer is natural lie detection  techniques, strategies and knowledge that give a person the rare and invaluable ability to separate the real from the fake and always know what to believe and what to question.  So, what does it consist of? Well, natural lie detection uses no machines, test papers, no video or audio recordings. It is, as the name suggests, a science based on human perception and skill.  It has 3 main components. They are the interpretation and analysis of: body language, psychology, and verbal communication. By having a deep and expert knowledge of all three, you can become capable of spotting 99 out of 100 lies, whether theyre spoken over the phone, in person or even over the internet or via text message. Although learning these special techniques isnt difficult when you have the time and proper reading material, it does require more space to explain than this short article allows. However, that doesnt mean we cant go over one way many liars give themselves away. This collection of principles falls under the body language category of natural lie detection and focuses solely on how a dishonest person uses, or avoids using, their hands when theyre being deceitful. There are 3 main hand-related signals of deceptiveness.  Signal  1: HAND GESTURE FREQUENCY. People use their hands to visually illustrate and emphasise their statements  its a way of painting an abstract picture in the air to better help the person or people theyre talking to understand the concepts being covered. When someone lies, however, their mind works differently to how it normally operates. Their thought process is dominated by the act of being dishonest convincingly and they therefore tend to change how they use their hands. The first change you should look for is in how often they gesticulate with their hands while talking. The majority of people, when they lie, lessen the amount of movements they make with their hands because they subconsciously want to restrict the volume of information being given to the person theyre lying to  out of fear of saying too much, either verbally or physically, and getting caught out or questioned. More proficient liars, or people who have rehearsed or planned a lie before telling it, actually tend to increase the frequency of their hand gestures. Theyll slice the air more with the blade of their hand or point their finger and clench their fists more frequently to illustrate and back-up what theyre saying. So, in short, look for a marked difference between the amount of hand gesticulations a person uses when in normal, day-to-day, obviously truthful conversation and when you suspect they may be lying to you or have a good reason to twist or otherwise alter the truth.  Signal  2: HAND-TO-FACE ACTIONS. The second signal you should look out for is an increase in the number of hand-to-face actions a person makes when you think they could be lying. The main reason they touch their faces more often when lying than when telling the truth is because of the internal social pressure theyre feeling, which leaks out in the form of hand-to-face actions. Look for moments when the person momentarily covers their mouth with their hand or fingers. This is a subconscious attempt to stifle themselves and physically block the lie from leaving their lips  they do this to futilely try to block their falsehood from reaching you and thereby decrease the chance of getting caught and lessen their feeling of guilt. However, many people are on some level aware of how mouth covers may be interpreted (as a sign that theyre lying) so instead try to camouflage the action by instead lightly touching their nose (which indirectly covers their mouth with their hand). Another reason many liars touch their noses is because of the increased blood-flow that occurs in its deep tissues, which creates an almost imperceptible tingle that, although not consciously felt and reacted to, causes the liar to unwittingly touch their nose for a moment. So, always keep an eye out for increased hand-to-face actions, especially those that cover a persons mouth in some way or another.  Signal  3: THE HAND SHRUG. When people dont know the answer to something or want to convey the messages: Im not sure, or I dont care, they often lift and quickly drop their shoulders in a shrugging motion. A variation of shoulder shrugging is the hand shrug: a quick lifting and dropping of one or both upturned hands.

lQIKWXDuaa	People that study other language are called linguistic.  That is actually a major. I dont know why you would want to get a master degree in that if you are interested in studying music. I love learning different languages as well. What I have done is buy Rosetta Stone and teach myself the language that I want to learn without wasting money in college, especially if you dont plan on becoming a translator or somebody like that. Also, I dont think it is possible to learn all these languages in a two year master's degree program. It might take longer. Remember the whole point of going to school is to get the skills that you will need to get a great job/career. Try thinking about a master's program that will give you the edge that you will need to make it as a great musician. Meet with a counselor at your college to get advise on this. You can also start studying these languages as an undergraduate while majoring in music. It is a great idea to know more than one language.

You have to really tell the whole truth and get some people to go with you. if another teacher knows about this and you can prove it, then they can get all of you a better teacher.    You could possibly even get the other algebra teacher to teach you (at lunch or free periods) and see what your algebra teacher says about the test grades next time.

GUsGRFWdaa	It really depends on the classes you are taking in college and how much homework the professor assigns. I was in IB in high school, similar to AP,  and was taking five college classes my first year in college. Honestly, the homework load was about the same, but the class schedule was a lot better, more relaxed, so I actually had more time my first year in college than I did my senior year of high school.|`|AA12205301	You can take as many classes as you want up to the credit limit of the college. It isn't that the workload is more, it is that the work itself is harder and you don't have a teacher holding your hand all the way. They lecture, then tell you what the assignment is then it is up to you.  It is different than high school.|`|4flomCyJaa	Depends on where you go and what kind of student you are now. My experience is that college classes aren't necessarily harder, they just demand more work and you have to plan the time to get assignments done - gone are the days of in class assignments; everything is done on your own time. If you can prioritize well, college shouldn't be too bad. Also the number of classes a day depends on what days the class meets - not every class meets every day. Actually, it's not uncommon to have just 1 or 2 classes a day, or to even have a day off.

0kaZhdBgaa	your going to need to attend either a two year university to get general education requirements out of the way or enroll into a four year university program. You will need to get a bachelor's degree in biology, which includes a lot of courses such as anatomy/ phsyiology, college algebra, botany, genetics, mollecular/ cell biology, chemistry, organic chemistry, phsyics I and II, statistics, ect. Most of the science classes also have labs that go along with them and are very time consuming. After you get all of your bachelor's requirements out of the way, you will need to start applying to graduate medical schools that have a pediatrician program (probably stary applying in your junior year of college and studying for mcats at beginning of junior year). I would suggest trying to get all A's and working as hard as you can- the graduate schools (especially medical) can be kind of competitve to get into and challenging as well, so it pays to get the high gpa. The pediatrician medical program at graduate schools is traditionally 4 years and then you have internships and residencies to complete for a couple years after that before you can fully practice on your own and get going in the career field. Hard work- but definitely worth it if you apply yourself! Good luck!|`|T42Nt3Lyaa	YOu will need very good school results, mostly A's.

yJSPecgoaa	It's important to first figure out what matters most to you:  figure skating, or being in school with your friends.    If it's being in school with your friends, then you might have to accept the fact that you can't continue to progress with your skating in the ways you had hoped.    Then again, if it's skating you value most, then your dad's idea of homeschooling is an excellent one, especially if you are intent upon skating competitively.  Keep in mind there is no reason to give up spending time with your friends, just because of being homeschooled.  You also can continue to attend high school sporting events, plays and musical performances with your friends, in addition to hanging out with them after school and on weekends.    Definitely take time to really think about your priorities. Because of having to reserve private rink times for practice (which of course is usually only available at odd hours--i.e. well before dawn or very late in the evening) competitive figure skaters need to structure their lives around their skating, or they will unfortunately fall behind.  For this very reason, many of the competitive skaters we know personally are homeschooled.     Good luck to you, no matter what you decide.|`|yLQuYBcsaa	There are ways to be home schooled that aren't isolating.I know that some home schoolers are allowed to take certain classes at school that they can't take online, such as PE. It allows them to be home schooled but also able to attend a class with their peers. Plus, they are allowed to participate in the extracurriculars the school offers, such as sports and clubs.

RgSCstkAaa	Don't worry about it, as the article is complete nonsense from start to finish. Quote therefrom: "Perversion primarily is a temporal verb". As the word perversion is a noun this does not enlighten. If the author meant to refer to the film or its plot as a temporal verb, it is equally meaningless.    If you want a word to describe the author, that word is "pseud".|`|iPSM76Xyaa	Temporal as in, "it applies to the moment in which it is used."  What is deemed perverse 'today' may not be (and often isn't) perverse 'tomorrow.'    For example, the motion picture, "Blindness (2008)," is (for me, anyway) a perverse work not worth the the hard disk space used to edit it.  But, I didn't find, "Audition (1999)," anywhere nearly as perverse.  I wanted to walk out of Blindness - that's a first for me, ever (I found it nearly as annoying as, "Wife Swap," or, "Nanny 911," or any scene where the mom yells in, "Malcolm in the Middle!")  Both films, however, may be as cliche and puerile as, "Halloween," and, "Friday the 13th," have become.
AA11527276	Actually, it does state how this quote reflects the position. By that statement, he is essentially declaring that a nation that feels "morally superior" does not feel the need to "stoop" to the levels of nations who resort to violence in order to prove their own might. In other words, it could be said that the US felt so secure in its knowledge that they were standing on moral high ground that there was no need for us to get involved in a war overseas that had nothing directly to do with our nation directly. If that makes sense to you, you should be able to answer the questions now.

VERrlErvaa	Hi,    Depending on what referencing style you are using.  Generally, they don't count in the word count.  When I was studying using the Harvard referencing system and the APA system, neither of them were graded taking quotations in as part of the word count.    It depends on your school/college/uni...    Might I suggest you check with your teacher/lecturer/tutor and double-check.  Last thing you want is to come up short, or worse, to go way over.    If you are only quoting Shakespeare you would probably not count those as part of the coursework; but I would make sure you reference it properly - also, don't forget that references don't count in word count either.    Your example would show 6 words. 'to be or not to be'    Hope this helps.
AA10023710	There are quite a few schools near White Plains that I think you may get into. In addition, White Plains has a train line - commuter rail called Metro North - right into Grand Central in NYC, takes maybe 30 minutes? So you also have access to a lot of schools in the city.     The schools near White Plains that I think you should look at, which might be good fits for you, include: Mercy College, Nyack College, Concordia College, College of New Rochelle, Manhattanville College, Fordham University (they have a campus in Westchester County, which has an adult bachelors degree which may be great for you), Pace University, Dominican College, and SUNY Purchase.     If you don't mind going into the city, you can also look at Pace University's NYC campus, Fordham Lincoln Center (which seems to have more adults than their Rose Hill campus), Marymount Manhattan, Baruch College, Lehman College, Hunter College, Columbia University School of General Studies, the New School University, New York University, College of Mt.

If it is something that held you back academically that you figured out how to overcome, and your GPA reflects this improvement...I would include an addendum to your application that notes as much.

We just had some law school admission's head honcho lady from a fourth tier school come talk to one of my classes. Although they are pretty liberal in their acceptance policy, she also spoke about how the school has a legal responsibility to only accept students who have a chance of passing the Bar. In the end, it doesn't matter what it is holding you back...if you can't handle the material, you're out of there.

I would suggest taking the ones that will knock generals that you HAVE to take out of the way (English, Math, History, Science are all usually required Gen Eds). I haven't had to take a psychology class, so in my case it wouldn't have been worth it. In the end it depends on what you're in to. Do you like the subjects? Are you confident that you'll be able to pass the AP tests? It's not worth taking the class if you can't pass the test, in my opinion.     If you're going to major in one of the subjects, take the class. I'm an English major and I passed the AP Language & Composition class, so I didn't have to take ENGL 1010 (basic college writing class) and was able to start out farther in my major.

eno37i5Paa	I'm not sure if this is right, but...    we learned in history about something called the "headrights system." it was a system they had in the colonial era. it was used for attracting people from europe to come to the new world (north america) to cultivate and settle the land. the headrights system stated that if you came over to the new world and worked the land with your family, you would be given xx amount of land in exchange.    there was also something called the Morrill Land Grant Act we learned about recently in history, but i don't trust myself to give a completely accurate answer, so i looked it up instead:    "The Morrill Land Grant Act allowed many states to receive land to build colleges. Without this grant, many states would not have been able to afford the land needed."    basically, the government gave the states land so they could build colleges and provide education to the people. a more educated population = people vote better, people succeed more in the market, and so on.
6itHY4gDaa	very good but and a hook, something to grab the reader's attention! maybe a better conclusion restating the thesis.|`|VFcLhj69aa	I work for Ferpect Edit (http://ferpectedit.org) an online editing and proofreading service. Please see my profile for more info. I won't revise your entire essay here, but I will show you the changes I would make in the first paragraph.     I am biracial: my mother is Mexican and my father is Black. I was raised in a community where most of the population was Latino. Eventually I learned how to speak fluent Spanish. This community is part of my heritage. I want to do research  to help improve the lives of the Latinos. I try to treat everyone that I serve with dignity and respect, regardless of our differences. Diversity means that one can listen to others whose background is not the same with dignity and respect, recognizing the differences between us without belittling or exaggerating them.     When in doubt, start with the concrete--which is why I changed the order in this paragraph. I also removed some phrases either because they were awkward, redundant ("I know for myself...")  irrelevant to the point at hand ("...to me as a Black woman"--unless you include there some sort of link from the Latino community specifically to this identity) or repetitive  (I tried to cut down on the number of times "learning" was used.)     Putting a less repetitive version of your thoughts on diversity last makes a good introduction to your second paragraph, especially if you include more of your own experience in that second paragraph--which I would recommend. I would also suggest making the essay not just about your triumphs, but also your struggles and possibly even your failures in embracing diversity. Any instances of less than perfect assumptions or behavior on your part will make your essay stronger and the reader more likely to identify with you. Take care and good luck.

IfR2oaFnaa	I Just found this on the internet, I didnt write this     I hope I helped!    Abstract. The paper reviews how we can learn from the pastabout climate-human-environment interactions at the presenttime, and in the future. It focuses on data sources for envi-ronmental change at local/regional and regional/global spa-tial scales, and shows the scope and limitations of each. It re-views alternative methods for learning from the past, includ-ing the increasing use of simulation models. The use of mul-tiple records (observational, palaeoenvironmental, archaeo-logical, documentary) in local case-studies is exemplified ina study from China, where independent records help unravelthe complexity of interactions and provide a basis for as-sessing the resilience and sustainability of the landscape sys-tem. Holocene global records for Natural Forcings (e.g. cli-mate and tectonics), Human Society and Ecosystems are re-viewed, and the problems of reconstructing global recordsof processes that are only recorded at local scales examined.Existing regional/global records are used to speculate aboutthe veracity of anthropogenic forcing of global climate, withspecific consideration of the Ruddiman theory. The paperconcludes that a full understanding of causes of earth sys-tem change through (at least) the Holocene can come onlythrough the most rigorous reconstructions of climate, humanactivities and earth processes, and importantly their interac-tions, at all locations and at all scales. It follows that we needto promote inter-scale learning: regionalisation and general-isation of existing data would be useful first steps. There isnow a need to develop long-term simulation models that canhelp anticipate complex ecosystem behaviour and environ-mental processes in the face of global environmental change and resolving our past is an essential element in that en-deavour.Correspondence to: J. A. Dearing(j.dearing@liv.ac.uk)1 IntroductionIt is tempting to draw our perspectives of climate-human-environment interactions from either the destructive impactof humans on their local environment or the impact of natu-ral forces on societies: resource exploitation on the one handversus climate determinism on the other. Both types of im-pact are still often exemplified, but new scientific ideas andevidence increasingly make this dichotomy less useful. Forexample, complexity theory, with related concepts such asnonlinear change, feedback and regime shifts (e.g. Schefferand Carpenter, 2003; Schneider, 2004) suggests that humanactivities and environmental change should be viewed to-gether as a co-evolutionary and adaptive process (cf. Holling,2001; Lenton et al., 2004). Positive feedback loops may leadto a conditioning of landscapes that makes them more sensi-tive to new perturbations. Hence, some historical societies,like those on Easter Island, became more prone to collapsethrough continuing resource depletion and ecological degra-dation (e.g. Diamond, 2005). Others, such as the Akkadiansociety of Mesopotamia, became increasingly vulnerable toclimate perturbations as their dependence on irrigated cul-tivation increased (Weiss, 2001). Further ideas stem fromnew palaeoecological and archaeological information aboutthe beginnings and extent of human activities in the past. Insome instances, these may change previous conceptions ofundisturbed ecosystems and the beginnings of agriculture.Recent data syntheses show that measurable human impacton equatorial forest may date to at least 3500 cal yr BP in theAmazon Basin and the Congo, and to 70008000 cal yr BPin SE Asia (Willis et al., 2004), the earliest maize cultiva-tion in the Andes has recently been extended by more thanone millennium to 4000 cal yr BP (Perry et al., 2006), andthe earliest Asian rice cultivation is now dated to 10 00014 000 cal yr BP in the middle Yangtze region and possiblyto 9000 cal yr BP in India (Yasuda, 2002).Published by Copernicus GmbH on behalf of the European Geosciences Union.

Bi-directional arrows represent potential flows ofenergy, matter and information between the three state systems thatmay define externally-driven causality and feedback. Circular ar-rows within each box represent internal dynamical processes (Dear-ing, 2006a). In other studies, piecing together data from different lo-calities has permitted new theories about the early humanrole in effecting change across regional/global spatial scales.For example, Miller et al. (2005) argue that human use offire in Australia was the most likely driver of major vegeta-tion change and megafaunal extinction, 50 00045 000 yearsago. This conclusion is not just central to a complete un-derstanding of anthropological and environmental change inAustralia; it also gives credence to the view that early hu-man im

coAKhCi3aa	I went to UCF for my Freshman year of college- 2001.  I am from Chicago originally, so it's not like you where I was coming from a small town/college type atmosphere.  I will tell you that it was the best year of my life.  The campus was great then, the people that I met were wonderful, and the classes that I took were extremely upper end.  Since that time, the school has grown astronomically.  It has the 5th highest enrollment, behind Ohio State, Arizona State, U of Florida and U of Minnesota.  With just over 50,000 students and a new medical school, it is bustling with eager students.  UCF was ranked the 7th best up and coming university by US News.  The school has a great layout which is circular in nature with 3 circles- Apollo, Pegasus, and Mercury. The layout is also very conducive to getting to classes within only a few minutes.    As for the fun aspect that you are looking for, I would say yes.  It's hard NOT to have fun at college to begin with, let alone the fact that you are going to school in a beautiful state on a beautiful campus.  The first time I set foot on campus, looking out at the Reflecting Pond, I knew that UCF was the school for me. I had some great times and brought home a slew of absolutely wonderful memories.

Let's try it with the second equation.    4x + y = 9  4x = 9 - y  x = 9/4 - y/4    Then, substitute this expression for "x" in the first equation.    2x + y = 5  2(9/4 - y/4) + y = 5    And solve the rest!    Or you could do it like this:    2x + y = 5  4x + y = 5    Multiply everything in the first equation so you can get the "2x" to become a "-4x".    2x + y = 5  (-2)[*2x + y = 5]  -4x - 2y = -10    Now, subtract the two equations:    -4x - 2y = -10   4x + y  =  9  ____________     - y = - 1  therefore, y = 1.    Then substitute "y = 1" into one of the equations, to find "x".    4x + y = 9  4x + (1) = 9  4x = 8  x = 8/4  x = 2    Therefore, x = 2 and y = 1.|`|tTg1XU8faa	Solve for y in each equation:    2x + y = 5  y = -2x + 5    4x + y = 9  y = -4x + 9    They are now in slope-intercept form y = mx + b, where m is the slope and b is the y-intercept. If the equations are exactly the same, there are infinitely many solutions. If the m is the same but the b is not, there is no solution. If both m and b are different (the equations are not the same at all), then there is one solution. So, knowing that, you know that this system has one solution.    ANSWER: One solution|`|4yaZE0Rpaa	you wanna get y by itself       2x+y=5                             subtract 2 on both sides     - 2x     -2x    y= 5-2x      you still wanna get y by itself        4x+y=9                      subtract 4x on both sides    -4x      -4x  y= 9-4x      They both have solutions

eyiot3mmaa	I agree with Fluke.  If you live on the island it's considered to be in your backyard and you take it for granted.  Usually its sort of looked down upon. There are better schools out there, but it has gotten some to their intended professions or into better grad schools.|`|vmgu7bbeaa	it's average. there are better schools in NY.
eno37i5Paa	Write about any interesting events that the school hosted that you may have attended. You could write about a memorable pep rally, or homecoming (if you attended), etc. If your school held a sponsor dinner or anything and you attended (for example, just last week my school held a Carrabbas' catering dinner as a fundraiser), write about it. If you're in student government or any clubs or extracurriculars, those would be good bets as well. Although I am in neither, I hear a lot of my friends saying that they made great friends and had great experiences being in Band or Orchestra (those particular classes often go on field trips to Disney land, etc.) Don't feel embarrassed to write about what your friends mean to you -- friends are practically the other half of high school, next to studies, of course.    As for designing it, I'd recommend using a graphic design program such as GIMP, Adobe Photoshop (or even Adobe Indesign), Microsoft Publisher should be alright, too, if it's just a page or a section in the yearbook. You could try looking up interesting backgrounds on google (make sure they are semi-transparent, so you can actually read the text you put on it). good luck!|`|nmWa7nr9aa	just write about whatever you like in the school year. the assignment never said it has to be about what your learn or specifically anything.maybe you can reveal a little secret in your yearbook that no one else knew or about random stuff.As for decoration, you can put some heart since valentine is almost here and some ribbons around it|`|562qoBUUaa	Maybe try adding to your current ideas (which sound good), with specific memories from the year at school...memorable events at homecoming or funny things that happened in class with friends or teachers. Type the paragraph into word, then cut it out and paste it onto a sheet of construction paper. On the border, add cropped photos and clip art that relate to what you are talking about in your writing.    Good luck, hope this helps.
XBJVU0Gtaa	Do you have a planner?  This is a notebook with a calendar and spaces to write notes for each day.      If you get a planner and write your homework assignments in your planner with due dates, you can start to plan your time more carefully.  You can add social dates, clubs, and events you want to attend.      If you have a long-term assignment, break up the work into sections and add a plan to complete each section in your planner.    Keep a separate 3-ring binder for each class.  Get the kind with pockets, or add an insert with pockets.  You can keep completed homework and tests/quizzes in the pockets.  Another plan is to 3-hole punch these papers, and keep them in a chronological order in the binder.      Learn how to take notes during class, and take notes in your 3-ring binder for that course.      If you set aside 2 hours every day devoted to homework and study, it will keep you on track.  Do not schedule anything for those 2 hours if you have homework.      Good organization skills will help you in college and are very important when you work.
