20090225150503AAWT9J2	Cars & Transportation;Other - Cars & Transportation	In the freezing morning do you scrape, de-icer, pour cold water on you car windows, or warm the engine for air?	I find pouring cold water just a tiny bit warmer than mains supply (5C max) is best for clearing icy car windows. It is instant, enviromentally safe and requires not a lot of effort.    I find de-icer not that good. since the glass is still very cold and often froze up again after applying the wipers. Scrapers are work.   The slightly warmed water warms the glass just above freezing thus not going to freeze up again. Use to little water and the cold glass can freeze the water. I use about 3 pints for the windscreens does the trick.

20090128192804AAgAbIV	Cars & Transportation;Maintenance & Repairs	Hit my car into a snow bank.  I need to know how to repair my car damage.?	If you look at weather reports for upstate NY (my zip code 13148), you will see that we had a bad winter storm today.  Everyone on the road including myself were travelling probably no faster than 20 or 25 in a 45 MPH speed zone.  Well today I was driving my 2006 Ford Crown Vic Police Interceptor.  I ALWAYS make these VERY slow turtle turns in adverse weather conditions so that I don’t slide badly.  A lot of cars today were sliding like crazy. I was even sliding at slow speeds but it wasn’t that bad as long as you drove slowly.  Well, I made a left hand turn on to 2 lanes (I proceeded to go in the slow lane and travel slowly since I had all season tires and not winter tires) and my baby started sliding ...I was confident that I would be able to manage her since I was only going 10MPH…however there was a car coming in the left lane, so I attempted to drive my car into the Dunkin Donuts parking lot and turn back out versus staying on the road and risking the possibility of hitting the car on the left of me just incase my car wanted to slide in the direction of the car on my left.  If there wasn’t a car next to me I would have been able to fix my sliding problem since I would have more room.  Anyway, my turn wasn’t that great LOL, I drove into a snow bank at the Dunkin Donuts entrance.  It was SUCH a SOFT hit if you know what I mean.  It’s almost like the hit wasn’t even noticeable.  I was able to back up and leave with no problem.  However, when I went outside this evening I happened to notice a bang on my bumper, I said WTF…I said crap, that probably happened when I drove into the snow bank.        PLEASE SEE THE VIDEO I POSTED (THE LINK IS BELOW). IT SHOWS THE MINOR DAMAGE.  My question is trying to figure out how I can repair the damage.  It doesn’t look that bad, but in my own opinion, it feels like I will have to go get a whole new bumper but maybe not.  Hopefully someone on here can give me a recommendation.  If the video isn’t clear, let me know and I will try making another video. If you have yahoo messenger, Please IM me at gmanzari0038 or just leave me an answer here.  Please no rude comments.  I’m a little stressed I banged it up like that considering that I paid $13K for the car and only had t since October.        http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fbx4UrpQX...       I’m only 21 - never had an accident in my life and this just upsets me - I can’t undo the damage.  PLEASE HELP!

For the state of Illinois, or just in general, what happens (or may happen) if you are caught driving a truck without a CDL license for your summer job? The truck is not a full-out 18-wheeler. I would consider it like a half semi truck, or better yet, like a big U-Haul truck. But the truck does use air breaks.

20090128202136AAv5WC7	Cars & Transportation;Maintenance & Repairs	Is this a problem with bad gas/water in our gas tank?	Me and my girlfriend were taking a trip (about 280 miles) and stopped about halfway through the trip to change drivers. We were at about half a tank of gas, so we topped it off, then continued our trip. We arrived at our destination without any issue. The next morning we started up our car (a 2001 Mustang) and it was hesitating, driving really rough, and making a popping type of noise in the back of the car (didn't quite sound like a backfire). We did a tune-up on the car just to be safe, but the problem persisted. The only thing I can think of that may have caused this problem is bad gas or water in the gas tank. Do you think this may be the issue?

20090128201609AAld1Fv	Cars & Transportation;Maintenance & Repairs	OBD II Scan Codes Help - 00' Hyundai Sonata V6?	I did a scan on my car when my check engine light came on...I got 2 reads:    1) P0449 - Evaporative Emissions Control System Vent - Valve Solenoid Circuit Malfunction.  2) P0705 - Transmission Range Sensor Circuit Malfunction (PRNDL Input).    Now the first one might make sense with the current problem I have at the gas station. Every time I go put gas in the tank (and I don't fill it up till its over filled) I have trouble starting my car up! I literally have to wait a minute, start my car and once it gets to that point where its on for a second or two, I have to rev the engine...or press the accelerator pedal. Now I figured its an electrical issue because it mentions its a "circuit malf." Does anyone have any idea with whats going on with my car and what I need to check? I don't want to spend an arm and leg at a garage tellin me I need a new part when that might only temporarily fix the problem.    Oh and same goes with the second code. I don't feel much of anything changing except when im in traffic going continuously slow. Sometimes it wants to do a slight jerk... but I don't know if thats normal.    BTW I have over 107,000 miles on my car... Need to change oil in about 2-3 weeks.
20090128201837AAGBA0Y	Cars & Transportation;Insurance & Registration	How does GAP insurance work?	My car was recently totaled and I have GAP insurance, but I'm unsure as to how it works. Under my GAP insurance, it states that the purchase price of my vehicle was $19,999. I still have about $16,000 left to pay on the car. Does this mean that the insurance will just pay the car off, or will they pay the entire $19,999?    Also, is there anything special that I need to do with the GAP insurance...like forms that I have to fill out or people to notify?    I've never gone through anything like this, so any information would be helpful.  Thanks
