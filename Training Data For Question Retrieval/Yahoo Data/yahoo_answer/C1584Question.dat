However, Milwaukee has only one flight per day to that destination, the one leaving Milwaukee leaves at 8:45, forcing us to leave Oak Park at about 4:30 AM, which is on the early side =].

20090220153311AAQAqJ0	Travel;Canada;Other - Canada	What motivates Canadians to join forces in Afghanistan?	First off what is that experience like from a Canadian perspective? Like Obama said, I'd say ditto, USA thanks Canada a million for involving itself in a war that is not even a direct threat to Canadian national security really.  It is extremely kind.      But Canada joined this effort under the watch George W. Bush, a president who didn't even make his first visit to Ottawa.  Perhaps Bush was the only national leader on earth to have an issue getting along with Jean Chretien.       Why inspired individual Canadians to say, "You know what? Despite Bush-Cheney-Rumsfeld and the troubles they caused themselves, despite the US electing this moron, despite the Iraq War based on lies, despite the torture chambers in Guantanamo, Despite the lumberjack trade war, despite a country where the average American knows absolutely nothing about Canada,      We...the Canadian people...feel we are STILL going to help these unfortunate USA people to the South of us and we will help in the effort to battle Taliban forces in Kandahar and support our role with NATO.      Would USA ever do this for any other army?  Not to mention WWII was result of Pearl Harbor 1941 and no action taken before that, and WWI Paschendaele, where was the USA when the Canadian corp was fighting to the death against Germany?

20090220153808AAf45lA	Travel;Air Travel	How do you know where your seats are on tickets?	I just got my concert tickets in the mail and I thought I bought floor seats because I spent $70 each on them. In the confirmation emails it says that the tickets are general admission, but that they're floor seats. On the actual tickets it says general admission, it says the price as $37, and gives a seat number, but it doesn't say the row or the section.      I've tried looking at the venue's floorplan to get an idea, but that was no help. Any ideas on how I could find this out? Could it be possible that I was swindled? Would the box office be able to tell me?

I'll be attending the International Academy of Art and Design this summer and I'll be moving to Orange County Orlando next month.    The apartments I'll be moving into are called Millenia West it's on S Texas Ave and it's near an Americana Blvd.    Apartment Area code: 32839    International Academy of Design and Technology Area code: 32809      I've heard really bad things about the area but I'm hoping it's not as bad as it seems. You know how some places have certain streets that you just don't go down? And certain streets that are a little safer... is this area like that? Is S Texas Ave one of the safer streets?      I've already paid money to hold the apartment and the lady says that other college students live there... so if other students live in the apartments can't be that bad right?      I hope I haven't made a terrible mistake...      This is the apartment that I am getting ready to rent out       http://www.berkshireapartments.com/realp...       The location should be on the website too...      I seriously hope I haven't made a mistake... I've grew up in a ghetto up north and I've seen the ghettos in Florida as well, but these apartments don't look as ghetto... And it seems to be set back from the rest of the neighborhood... Is it that bad?   I'm currently in West Palm Beach and over here one side is really ghetto and the otherside (where I live) is very nice. Hopefully Orange County is like that too...   I mean that's where the International Academy of Design and Technology is located, a college wouldn't be located in a really ghetto area would it? ...I was looking on Google maps' satellite view, and the area looked very decent... kind of like a small town...      The apartment is about a 20 min walk from the school...   I don't have a car   ...I think I've made a huge mistake... :'( But I've paid already...      :(
