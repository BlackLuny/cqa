20090309194605AA3Gxe9	Education & Reference;Special Education	I want to become a special education teacher?	and i am not sure how to go about it. I want to work specifically withj severely handicapped children.  i am currently attending a community college that does not offer a degree to teach special needs children.  However, they do offer an early childhood degree, and have been told getting dual certification is best.  Should I change my major to that? I am planning on attending a four year university after achieving my associates and my community college, where i can earn my certification to teach special needs kids.        Currently, I am enrolled as a Liberal Arts General major, which is basically the broadest spectrum to take the basic courses needed for most degrees.  However, if I were to switch, it would put to waste may of the 30 credits I have already achieved.      So my question- is it worth it to change majors from Liberal Arts General to Early Childhood Education and spend more time getting my associates? or Should i stick with my current major and concentrate on special education once i enroll in my four year university?

If I do well on MCAT and try hard in college, and do what ever else I love (volunteering, getting involved in church, etc), would that be enough for med school? or do i have to follow all the other things people tell me to do such as research, clubs (taking leadership), etc?      Btw, I'm not one of those kids trying to get into harvard, stanford, and alike, but rather I'm shooting for my state med school.

20070502102944AA5c0UK	Education & Reference;Trivia	Aimez vous recevoir des  cadeaux ...? ;-)))?	Un jeune homme voulait acheter un cadeau à sa blonde.   Après m?re réflexion, il décide de lui acheter une paire de gants.   Accompagné de la soeur de sa blonde, il alla les acheter dans un magasin à rayons.   En même temps, la soeur de sa blonde s'acheta deux paires de petites culottes.   Durant l'emballage, la vendeuse mélangea les deux articles, le jeune homme hérita des petites-culottes et vice-versa.   Il envoya donc le colis à sa blonde avec la lettre suivante :   Douce chérie,   Voici un petit cadeau pour te prouver que je n'ai pas oublié ton anniversaire. Mon choix est d? au fait que je me suis aper?u que tu avais l'habitude de ne pas en porter lorsque tu sortais le soir. Si ce n'avait pas été de ta jeune soeur, j'aurais choisi une paire plus longue avec des boutons, mais elle porte elle-même des paires plus courtes, facile à enlever. La couleur est plut?t pale, mais la jeune vendeuse ma montrée une paire qu'elle avait portée pendant trois semaines et elle était à peine sale, elle en a fait l'essai devant moi et ?a lui faisait très bien.   J'aurais bien aimé pouvoir te les mettre moi-même la première fois, mais sans doute que beaucoup d'autres hommes les serreront dans leurs mains avant que je puisse te revoir.   Lorsque tu les enlèveras, souffle dedans avant de les mettre de c?té afin de chasser l'humidité qui reste toujours après l'usage. Sois certaine de les porter quand tu les laveras pour empêcher leur rétrécissement. J'espère que tu vas les aimer et que tu vas les porter pour moi vendredi soir prochain.   P.S. Pense juste au nombre de fois que j'aurai le plaisir de les embrasser au cours des prochaines années. Enfin, la dernière mode, c'est de les porter avec les rebords pliés montrant la fourrure

20070526004117AAsd749	Education & Reference;Words & Wordplay	Is it: "I could care less" or "I couldn't care less"?	I think this phrase is misspoken all the time.  It's supposed to infer  that something is unimportant to the speaker.  I've heard people say "I could care less" all the time, but I think that's the wrong saying.  That would imply that presently one CARES about the subject, at least somewhat.  If you say "I couldn't care less", that means you already do not care whatsoever.  I've argued this with friends for a long time, and they still don't agree.  What do you think?  Or do you not care?

20070604082557AAFCNlr	Education & Reference;Other - Education	Why do so many students cheat? Ethics down the drain!!?	I have worked in the education field for several years, and have noticed (even since I graduated from H.S. 10 yrs ago) that there is a huge increase in cheating amongst students.     I also have noticed that Yahoo Answers "Homework Help" is flooded with students wanting answers to their homework assignments, rather than researching and learning on their own.      Is this generation just lazy?!?!..or is it due to the technology that they have available (i.e. yahoo answers, internet access, more creative ways to cheat & not get caught)       Do you think it is due to the fact that our states and country are putting less of an emphasis on ethics, morals, beliefs?        Or do you think it is the parent's faults?        Or perhaps, the blame lays in the school systems...teachers and administrators not doing enough to crack down on cheating?        Where has the drive to accomplish on your own gone to???      Maybe you have a better idea as to why!      Would love to hear your thoughts and comments!!

Hey, I'm a high school senior, and will be attending college next year.  I was always a pretty good student in high school, but never really one of the "top, best" students.

In high school, I worked hard, but I often got distracted while I studied, etc.  Basically, I'm just wondering if it is possible for me to make this transition as I go from high school to college.  I'll but studying for a pre-medical pathway when I go to college.      Thanks

Marie, dit le patron d'un restaurant, je sais bien qu'avant de travailler ici, vous étiez employée à la cantine d'une école maternelle.

Aussi invite-t-elle souvent ses amies pour leur montrer. Un jour que, devant une nouvelle compagne, elle lave minutieusement les tasses minuscules et les soucoupes, l'invitée s'extasie:   - Tu sais bien faire la vaisselle, Marine!   - Oui, lui réplique sérieusement la petite fille, et puis je l'essuie aussi parce que je n'ai pas encore de mari.   ***********************************   Un petit gar?on prend son manteau, ses bottes et demande:   - Maman, est-ce que je peux aider papa à mettre les cha?nes à la voiture?

Interloqué, il se relève et se recouche. Une heure plus tard, il retombe et, heureux, se dit:   Si je ne m'étais pas relevé tout à l'heure, eh bien, je me serais tombé dessus.   **********************************   C'est l'histoire d'un paysan avec sa vache, qui fait du stop au bord d'une nationale. Un homme s'arrête et le paysan monte dans la voiture. Le conducteur lui demande :   - " Et votre vache ?   - Ne vous inquiétez pas, on va l'accrocher derrière ; elle a l'habitude de suivre. "   Et ils partent. A 40 km/h, la vache suit. Le conducteur accélère alors un peu à 60 km/h. La vache suit. A 80 km/h, la vache suit toujours sans problème apparent.   Le conducteur commence à s'énerver, et accélère encore. Le petit jeu se poursuit jusqu'aux limites de sa voiture. A 160 km/h, le conducteur regarde dans son rétroviseur puis, triomphant, s'adresse au paysan :   - " Elle fatigue, votre vache ; elle tire la langue !   - De quel c?té ?   - Euh ? A gauche.   - Alors, c'est qu'elle veut doubler... "

20070703100550AArefNU	Education & Reference;Primary & Secondary Education	My friend needs help!?	my friend, nai nai, is in the 7th grade. our school has recently adopted a new math system which makes it difficult to skip grades in math because so many asian kids were skipping grades in math. she already took 8th grade geometry, and now her parents want her to skip 9th grade algebra so she can take pre-calculus next year as an 8th grader. she's not a genious, maybe above average in math, but her mom is pushing her to take summer school at a community college. i've tried to tell her mom that kids who skip grades often end up antisocial because they dont have any friends in the higher grades, and end up losing all their friends in their own grade (which unfortunately happened to me). i dont want her to go through this, but her mom won't listen to anything anyone says unless it is a recommendation to study more.

My first LSAT i took in September of my Junior year and i received a 163 which is about an 83%. My 2nd LSAT ( Law School Admission Test) was on June of 2007. i got a 172 which is about a 98% i believe. i am also participating in my schools student government and law society. i have 3 solid recommendations from professors. my personal statement paper is halfway complete.
