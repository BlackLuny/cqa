In birds and in other non-mammalian vertebrates the compartment containing the sensory cells for hearing is occasionally also called “cochlea”, although it is not coiled up. Instead it forms a blind-ended tube, also called the cochlear duct. This difference apparently evolved in parallel with the differences in frequency range of hearing and in frequency resolution between mammals and non-mammalian vertebrates.'<br>  <br>  [from Wikipedia.] So it also seems to be something to do with the frequency range.|`|CYtMRC4eaa	It is coiled to save space.

For every proton it loses, the tendency for it to lose another proton is weakened because there is a greater charge (more negative) on the sulfuric acid molecule. This is highly unstable. <br>  <br>  The dissociation constant, Ka, for H2SO4 is considerably much higher than HSO4. In fact, SO4-2 is rather BASIC, in other words, it would prefer to take a proton from the surrounding to get rid of its -2 charge.

The series of reactions is as follows.<br>  <br>  CO2+H2O<---->H2CO3<---->HCO3^- + H^+<---->CO3^2- + 2H+<br>  <br>  This buffers seawater, because as more hydrogen ions are added (more acidic), carbonate can remove them from solution, raising the pH.

Therefore, higher ferment temperatures increase yeast activity, and vice-versa. Published literature indicates that within the range of temperatures in which yeast is operative, every one degree rise in temperature increases the rate of yeast fermentation by 3-5%. Likewise, a decrease of 1°F will cause a similar decrease in the rate of fermentation. The temperature range for optimum yeast fermentation is between 75°F-85°F. The process of fermentation also generates heat, and its measure is often used by bakeries as an effective way to monitor the degree of fermentation."<br>  <a href="http://www.dakotayeast.com/help-fermentation.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.dakotayeast.com/help-fermenta...</a>
uYNBdnZiaa	You need to convert to Kelvin at the beginning of the problem. Why is this? Think about it. You can have a negative temperature when working with celcius. So let's say you have a beginning volume of 1 liter. Your beginning temperature is negative 30 degrees celsius and your ending temperature is positive 10 degrees celcius. When you begin to solve the problem, you run into, well, a problem. You end up with a negative volume! Obviously, this cannot happen. Therefore, you must use Kelvin to solve the problem. This simply ensures you do not end up with any negative answers where it would be impossible to be negative. When you are done with the problem, you can convert back into celcius. :)|`|yCaS0H7baa	you need to convert from the very beginning or else your answer will be off by a lot.

x384qQ3Iaa	In these problems, often the hardest part is figuring out exactly what all the letters stand for (at least that's how it is for me).  In your problem, p is the principle or the amount to invest. So here, p=18,000.  r is the rate in decimal form, not as a percent; so r=0.045.  n is the number of times compounded per year; since we're compounding monthly, n=12.  and finally, t is the number of years that you will be accumulating interest.  <br>  <br>  Ok, so your question is to find t when the amount invested has doubled. So that means that A = 2*p.  We have 2*p = p(1+0.045/12)^12t.  Cancel p from both sides and then take the log of both sides:<br>  <br>  log(2) = log(1.00375^12t)<br>           = 12t * log(1.00375)<br>  <br>  So t = log(2)/(12 * log(1.00375))<br>  <br>  I put the right side of that equation into Google and got 15.43 years. Hope this helps.

The proper diet for box turtles can be pretty intense (it needs to be varied) - so instead of writing it here, I'm going to put some good links about box turtle care in the source section.<br>  <br>  ***Addition*** They will drink water, but they get most of their water from their diet and from "soaking".  You will need to provide a dish of fresh water of which the turtle can easily climb in and out (they can't swim, so it needs to be shallow, but deep enough that the turtle can submerge at least 1/3 of its shell.)  Elimination in the water is common, so the water will have to be checked and changed often.  Some box turtles do not always do what they are supposed to - so if you have one that won't soak itself, you will need to do it - put a couple inches of warm (not hot) water in a plastic tub and put the turtle in it for 20 minutes - constant supervision during this is crucial (they are escape artists and if they flip in the water they could drown).  Get a gram scale and weigh your turtle before and after soakings.  If the weight stays pretty close to the same, things are fine.  If the turtle gains a lot after soaking (more than 15%) - it was probably dehydrated and you will need to increase how often you soak it.<br>  <br>  Along with a proper diet, putting a little vitamin E on the carapace (although a little sticky initially) helps keep it in good condition.<br>  <br>  *** I don't know what is going on with Bills Box Turtles website.  The google "gods" now have it listed as an attack site.  I've never had problems with the site - I don't know if it got hacked or if it is a google problem.|`|nKwcGLQraa	depends on what kind of turtule you have.

Gnfc4wRlaa	I'm sorry but I believe your premise is flawed.  Magma does get released into the atmosphere (as lava) quite regularly from volcanoes.  The lava itself doesn't have a significant effect on the atmosphere.  Drilling a hole and releasing magma (which becomes lava when it comes out) shouldn't do anything that a volcano doesn't already do.  The volcanic effects on the atmosphere are from aerosols and from ash and particulate matter ejected during an eruption.  Lava can't reach the upper layers of the atmosphere.  Even when being blown 1,000 feet in the air, it quickly falls to the ground and cools.  Flowing lava burns everything in its path when moving along the ground, but it doesn't destroy things away from its path.  If you want to have dire atmospheric effects, you would need to have it be from aerosols (accelerating the ozone depletion) and particulates (blocking the sunlight).  I don't think this would happen from a drilled hole.  You would need a massive volcanic eruption, a supervolcano bringing what is sometimes called a "nuclear winter", see below.  Or you could change to an asteroid impact.  A major one could have this same effect.<br>  <br>  "Large volcanic eruptions can have an indirect effect on ozone levels. Although Mt. Pinatubo's 1991 eruption did not increase stratospheric chlorine concentrations, it did produce large amounts of tiny particles called aerosols (different from consumer products also known as aerosols). These aerosols increase chlorine's effectiveness at destroying ozone. The aerosols only increased depletion because of the presence of CFC - based chlorine. In effect, the aerosols increased the efficiency of the CFC siphon, lowering ozone levels even more than would have otherwise occurred. Unlike long-term ozone depletion, however, this effect is short-lived. The aerosols from Mt. Pinatubo have disappeared, but satellite, ground-based, and balloon data still show ozone depletion occurring closer to the historic trend."<br>  <br>  "Nuclear winter is a hypothetical global climate condition that is predicted to be a possible outcome of a large-scale nuclear war. It is thought that severely cold weather can be caused by detonating large numbers of nuclear weapons, especially over flammable targets such as cities, where large amounts of smoke and soot would be injected into the Earth's stratosphere. The term has also been applied to one of the after-effects of a comet or asteroid impact, also sometimes termed an impact winter, or of a supervolcano eruption.<br>  Mechanism<br>  <br>  The nuclear winter scenario predicts that the huge fires caused by nuclear explosions (particularly from burning urban areas) would deliver large quantities of aerosol particles into the stratosphere, where they could remain for months or years, and which would significantly reduce the amount of sunlight that reached the surface. The ash and dust would be carried by the midlatitude west-to-east winds, forming a uniform belt of particles encircling the northern hemisphere from 30°N to 60°N latitudes (assuming most targets in a nuclear exchange are located between these latitudes). The dust clouds would then block out much of the sun's light, causing surface temperatures to drop drastically."<br>  <br>  In reference to ScottsdaleHigh's answer:  Yes, he is correct about the book and the extinction.  This agrees with what I said about a massive eruption:<br>  <br>  The Permian extinction came during the greatest relative drop in oxygen (and was also accompanied by a shorter-term rise in atmospheric carbon dioxide, one of the largest in Earth’s history). Both of these events took place amid the amalgamation of the largest continental landmass and the greatest volcanic event (the flood basalt eruptions left lava fields the size of Alaska).|`|SBBnWsJJaa	Magama doesn't come from the center of the earth.<br>  <br>  Plus this happens all the time - it's called a volcanic eruption.|`|WPPIaLORaa	There is a clear example of this.  Approximately 251 million years ago there was the greatest mass extinction in the last half billion years.  It happened because of massive flows of lava in Siberia.  Associated with the lava was a dramatic rise in atmospheric carbon dioxide with an associated greenhouse effect.<br>  <br>  The subsequent rise in air temperature and ocean water temperature caused a reduction in the level of oxygen dissolved in the oceans.  The oceans did not put out enough oxygen to prevent the atmospheric oxygen levels to fall as well.  In the end, about 90% of all animal species went extinct.|`|o6LrQTw6aa	There's already several movies and books about this.<br>  <br>  If you want to get a good idea watch a volcano and the multiply it 10 fold

So it's the derivative of the outside times the derivative of the inside. Ignore the 4 for now. Find out what your outside and inside are.<br>  <br>  The outside is cos(x) right? So the derivative of cos(x) is -sin(x). So that would be <br>  -sin(7ln(x)).<br>  The inside is 7ln(x). So the derivative of 7ln(x), using the product rule, is 0(ln(x)) + 7(1/x) which equals 0+(7/x)= 7/x. <br>  Now multiply these together, which gives you -(7/x)sin(7ln(x)). <br>  <br>  Now that we know the derivative of the second term, we can use the product rule to find the derivative of the whole problem. <br>  <br>  The derivative of 4 is 0.

A function matches each thing in its DOMAIN to exactly one object in the RANGE.  Objects in the range may be "reached" by one, two, or none of the objects in the domain.  For example, if...<br>  f(4) = 4<br>  f(5) = 94<br>  f(-3) = 39<br>  f could be a function with domain {3,4,5} and range {4,39,94}.  But if we have<br>  <br>  g(3) = 4<br>  g(3) = -4<br>  g(39) = 3<br>  <br>  g is NOT a function, because 3 is mapped to 4 and -4.  However, g IS a relation.
nTKuRFlKaa	*Creep resistance is dependent on slowing the speed of dislocations within the crystal structure. The body centered cubic gamma prime phase [Ni3(Al,Ti)] present in nickel and nickel-iron superalloys presents a barrier to dislocations. Chemical additions such as aluminum and titanium promote the creation of the gamma prime phase. The gamma prime phase size can be finally controlled by annealing. Cobalt base superalloys do not have a strengthening secondary phase like gamma prime. Many other elements, both common and exotic, can be present; chromium, molybdenum, tungsten, aluminium, zirconium, niobium, rhenium, carbon or silicon are just a few examples.<br>  <br>  *Just put the search term "creep resistance of superalloys " in any search engine like yahoo, google , you will have a bunch of references.

G5QC5f5baa	VFD manufacturers often set the carrier frequency at 3 kHz or less. Higher carrier frequency frequencies result in higher switching losses and can contribute to problems with ringing voltages stressing the motor insulation. There should be no problem with harmonic distortion of the motor current waveform at 1.5 to 3 kHz. There could be problems with acoustical noise generation in the motor if the motor is installed in a quiet area. VFD manufacturers offer a switching frequency increase adjustment to 15 kHz or so to reduce acoustical noise at the cost of reduced efficiency and perhaps de-rated output current rating.

Do you think that there is extra senses besides sight, hearing, touch, taste, and smell?  Is there a name for the sense that contains all of those?  How many 1's are in 5?  But then 5 is separate than 1. Each human being has ESP.<br>  What about deja vu?  What causes that?  Every time that sight, hearing, tactile, taste, and perception happen together, that causes deja vu.<br>  For example, you are in a room with a few people and you are watching TV.  It's the same show you watched the other night and you get to the scene where their is a good looking girl dancing on a table.  Well, the other night, this girl got up on this table beside you and danced just for fun when that came on.<br>  Your brain is going to replay that memory and you'll feel like it is happening all over again.|`|duVTqRM4aa	I once had a deja vu incident where I knew exactly what someone was going to say before they said it.

Five hundred lbs is only about 9 bu and would require about 1/10 acre to grow.

LU38ZyCVaa	Thermodynamics (from the Greek θερμη, therme, meaning "heat" and δυναμι?, dunamis, meaning " power") is a branch of physics and is used extensively in chemistry. Thermodynamics studies the effects of changes in temperature, pressure, and volume on physical systems at the macroscopic scale by analysing the collective motion of their particles using statistics. Roughly, heat means "energy in transit" and dynamics relates to "movement"; thus, in essence thermodynamics studies the movement of energy and how energy instills movement. Historically, thermodynamics developed out of need to increase the efficiency of early steam engines.<br>  <br>  With these tools, thermodynamics describes how systems respond to changes in their surroundings. This can be applied to a wide variety of topics in science and engineering, such as engines, phase transitions, chemical reactions, transport phenomena, and even black holes.

Thus, the potato gains weight and/or swells.  <br>  <br>  In the opposite situation (when the potato is put into a solution that is more concentrated than its contents), the potato cells will lose water.  <br>  "Plasmolysis is the process in plant cells where the plasma membrane pulls away from the cell wall due to the loss of water through osmosis."  The potato loses weight.

CYtMRC4eaa	Here is how they agree:  When molecules are contained in one area, it is considered an ordered system;  energy is/was required to keep them that way.  If they are allowed to move freely according to their degree of kinetic energy, they will begin to diffuse, and the amount of disorder (entropy) increases.

I think that most of the things that you are looking for are actually part of the farming business itself. Dog breeding, chickens, herbs are specialty farming, and can bring in some good income. Others to consider are mushrooms, Christmas trees, strawberries, blackberries, raspberries, orchards, or vegetables, all can bring you in a lot or extra money. If you wish to go organic, you can get higher prices.

This office is found under the county listing in the phone book. Also, since Martinsville is a fairly good size town, they may have a city emergency manager with the listing under the city listings. <br>  <br>  I would check there first. <br>  <br>  If you are dealing with a realty in looking for a house to call home, the realtor often will have copies of these maps as well.<br>  <br>  I would check at least two different sources to make sure the house you are looking at is not in a flood plain or close to a flood plain. <br>  <br>  Another suggestion is to make sure your route to work or shopping is also well above flood plains and are safe from flooding. <br>  <br>  The most common causes of death by weather events are flooding and lightning. And most of the time the cause of flooding deaths is a person drove a vehicle into water of unknown depth and drowned.<br>  <br>  Again, you are very wise to look at this before buying a house. I wish more people would check this. It would save a lot of grief for them in the future.
i0ypGmlQaa	I'll just summarize the idea.<br>  <br>  Write 1/(1-x) as an infinite geometric sum. Now consider just a finite part of that sum ( sum x^i from i=0 to N).<br>  <br>  Now you have the limit of an integral of something integrable -- x^b logx -- times some finite-degree sum (a polynomial!). You can use term-by-term integration. Each term will look like:<br>  <br>  x^b logx + <br>  x^(b+1) logx + <br>  x^(b+2) logx + <br>  ... + <br>  x^(b+N) logx<br>  <br>  You've already established that these are integrable.<br>  <br>  Then you want to make it back to the infinite sum. Take the limit (outside the integral), then pass that limit (an infinite sum is a limit) into the integral by Fatou's lemma or some such. QED
4fWZL4TRaa	My ideas are a bit too complicated, involve a vacuum cup that lifts the top sheet, like some printing presses. I think a roller with little vacuum cups might do it. I am sure I have seen something like that, but cannot remember what it was.<br>  <br>  I think something that would suit you is like the PC printer rollers that get a new sheet of paper. As you might have an old printer around, there is the mechanics. These work for envelopes etc. so I guess would work with play money, even if it has to go sideways.<br>  <br>  The link below shows an existing toy ATM.

q4XSkBQFaa	The three main components of a clotting time test, otherwise known as a coagulation panel, include prothrombin time (PT), partial thromboplastin time, and total bleeding time.  Without getting too technical, suffice to say there are several different aspects of blood clotting and with each several different steps where things can go wrong.  A coag panel can give important indicators on these pathways and, depending on the results and the symptoms, can help a physician differentiate between the different kinds of clotting problems like hemophilia and vitamin K deficiency, or help manage a patient whose blood is intentionally being 'thinned' by coumadin or some other drug.

KUVRekuZaa	One does not need to take the dogmatic literalism of many modern creationists to see that evolution pulls the rug from under any belief in some sort of divine creator, from Yaweh, to the Invisible Pink Unicorn (bless Her Holy Hooves) or the Flying Spaghetti Monster.<br>  <br>  Evolution by natural selection does not require any "Intelligent Designer"  to account for all the "Forms most beautiful" and provides an entirely natural explanation, rather than a fanciful supernatural explanation of life on Earth. <br>  <br>  A few people may take some hope in abiogenisis (i.e. life originating from non-living materials) as the place where some old guy in the clouds waved a magical hand and spoke a magic spell, and theories of abiogenisis do strictly speaking lie outside Darwinian "natural selection". While the exact mechanism of abiogenisis is debated within science, there is no reason to suppose we wil not, through rational enquiry, discover the mechanism. To me it is just implausible that some Divine being (Even then Flying Spaghetti Monster, sauce be upon Him) would breath life into some puddle of chemicals - Why?? <br>  <br>  As for the point in the question "if evolution was really an undisputed fact of science then everyone including religious people would have had to surrender to it?" - amongst rational scientists, evolution by natural selection **is** an undisputed fact. Unfortunately the Hairless Apes that ponder such matters are not entirely rational, and some people prefer to belive in fairytales, crystal healing, the world ending in 2012 (or pick many other dates)  and refuse to surrender to the avalanche of facts that disprove their deep rooted belief in magic.|`|wmBK9uASaa	Given time (and we`ve only been taking things seriously for a few hundred years) science will be able to explain everything,we are on a learning curve and we don`t yet know how far we`ve come or how far we have to go,|`|mV1YscV7aa	I understand your arguement and I am approaching the issue as a university geology graduate, a creationist and an evangelical Christian.<br>  <br>  There are people who believe in theistic evolution and they are welcome to their beliefs. However, these opinions (as far as I reason tthem) are neither supported by science nor are they supported by the Bible.<br>  <br>  The Bible is not just concerned with establishing the existence of a god. It is rather concerned that the one true God referred to in the Bible, created a PERFECT world and made two PERFECT people who then disobeyed Him. Jesus was then, in the New Testament, referred to as the 'Second Adam' because by dying for the sins of the world, Jesus redeemed truly repentant people back to the perfect state that existed before sin entered the world. As such, the arrival of man on Earth by Darwinian genetic mutation, is not compatable with Biblical Creationism.<br>  <br>  Science is also incompatible with Darwinian genetic mutation, however. Evolutionists cannot explain, chemically, how the first life came to Earth. They cannot explain the Cambrian Explosion. They cannot explain how the first amphibians got their rib cages and their strong legs - they certainly hadn't evolved from rhipidistian fishes! They try to argue these things away with 'punctuated equilibrium' but there is no evidence for this! Evolution is philosophy, it is not science.<br>  <br>  The Bible doesn't claim that the sun resolves around the earth. It was simply that this was believed at that time, rather than being a specific Biblically believed doctrine. You should also consider that the Reformation did a great deal for the advancement of science. A number of great scientists have also been evangelical Christians e.g. Boyle, Kepler and Faraday.|`|5eQeHJJiaa	The argument is not, If we evolved from single celled organisms then god doesn't exist. Many scientists are religious. The Catholic church is the one who has it backwards in their dogmatic and overly pragmatic view of the bible. The argument started because the bible was meant to be taken very literally by religious scholars. Which is why when the bible said the earth was the center of the universe people were killed who disagreed. The creation stories and the fact that they are taken so literally (adam the first man) shows how very little progress the church has made in its public views since the middle ages.|`|oblPeWxlaa	God never existed.

Christians have surrendered nothing scientific. Contrariwise they have led the way and still do. As in discovery of DNA <br>  Unfortunately due to mass indoctrination in evolutionary concepts even many Christians succomb to some element of evolution. And one could argue that Adam and Eve "evolved" from the dust of the ground quite literally.<br>  But against what time frame?<br>  Does such an  all knowing God  need to practice His shots to get it right by " Natural Selection"? Of course not everything on Earth is interfaced such that survival of any one species depends upon contremporaneous life on Earth.<br>  You cant have viable link species. No such fossils have really been found only conjecturel fragments , like the mixed up baboon bones we lanbelled " Lucy"   a supposed half human.<br>  <br>  No, sadly we are all conned into scientific Darkin/Darwin delusion without thinking through ourselves to relaise the impossibility of lawless evolution.

When all that is left is an organism-shaped hole in the rock, it is called an external MOLD.  If this hole is later filled with other minerals, it is a CAST.  An internal MOLD is formed when sediments or minerals fill the internal cavity of an organism, such as the inside of a bivalve or snail.

Aty76cgqaa	In an area far from city lights, one can see two or three other galaxies or dwarf galaxies. But these are fuzzy patches in which no individual stars can be detected with the unaided eye. So the individual stars seen in the sky are all within the Milky Way galaxy. <br>  <br>  The Milky Way is about 100,000 light years diameter. Approximately 9,000 stars can be seen from Earth. At any one point on Earth, one can see about 2,500 of these in the sky under optimal conditions. <br>  <br>  The nearest one is Alpha Centauri at 4.3 light years away. The farthest is a little over 11,000 light years away, Rho Cassiopeiae in the constellation Cassiopeia–and though it appears to us as a fairly faint star, it is in reality a supergiant star over 100,000 times more luminous than our Sun.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.absoluteastronomy.com/topics/..." rel="nofollow">http://www.absoluteastronomy.com/topics/...</a>|`|QPWjtDzcaa	Most of the stars you can see with the naked eye are less than a couple hundred light years away.  There are some exceptions, such as Deneb, the brightest star in the constellation Cygnus, which is in the neighborhood of 3000 light years away.  <br>  <br>  Anything along the lines of millions of light years away is not in our galaxy, and is so distant that you cannot resolve individual stars.  <br>  <br>  The Andromeda Galaxy is an example of this.  Assuming you have excellent eyesight, and live in one of the rare areas where there is no light pollution, it can be seen with the naked eye as a fuzzy patch of light.  The Anromeda Galaxy is roughly 2.25 Million Light Years away.|`|79529314dfb5ac7be366558924c3393baa	All the stars you see in the night sky with the naked eye are inside the Milky Way, and relatively nearby inside the Milky Way at that. Most of them are within a few hundred or at most a few thousand light years; in fact, even the brightest stars in the Universe (not counting odd short-term events like supernovas and gamma ray bursts) would not be visible to the naked eye on an individual basis from a distance of more than about 10000 light years. For example, Eta Carinae is about 8000 light years away and is slightly dimmer in apparent magnitude than the dimmest stars the human eye can perceive on its own, although stars brighter than Eta Carinae may exist. In any case, this would mean that no star you can pick out individually in the sky could appear to you as it was more than 10000 years ago, because light moves at the speed of light (obviously) and takes exactly one year to travel one light year through space. Most of the stars in the night sky appear as they were perhaps a few hundred years ago.|`|5gG42iOpaa	the closest is about 2 light-years, the furthest is millions away, in other galaxies, the closest visible to the naked eye is Andromeda collectively (the nearest galaxy) it is 2 million light-years away.<br>  <br>  (The sun is the true closest star at 8 light-minutes away)|`|17d2136cb28b3dcd96bfa98507022f5eaa	4 years to 3000 years, though most stars we see with the naked eye are within a few hundred light years.

AA11513203	Because Archaeopteryx has features of both dinosaurs and birds, (such as teeth AND wings) and thus meets the qualifications of a "transitional fossil."   In fact, skeletally it has more features in common with dinosaurs than it does with birds.<br>  <br>  The fact that you now require the finding of another "transitional fossil" between dinosaurs and archaeopteryx is a common tactic you will see on anti-evolution sites ... but this is just playing a game of 'moving the goalposts'.   It is not actually really *looking* at the evidence we *do* have.<br>  <br>  But the fact is that archaeopteryx is not the only transitional fossil between dinosaurs and birds that we have found.   Look up the evolution of the theropods, including Coelophysis, Deinonychus, Lisboasaurus, Protoavis, Sinornis santensis, Ambiortus dementjevi, Ichthyornis, Hesperornis, and others.<br>  <br>  And do not ignore the basic fact that even if not a *single fossil* had ever been found, the DNA evidence alone is enough to establish common ancestry between birds and mammals.   The fossils only allow us to get a glimpse of what those common ancestors looked like, and to start putting names to those species.   <br>  <br>  The problem with the Creationist sources is that they would have less to complain about if there were *no fossils at all*!  But the more fossils get discovered, the more the Creationists just shrug at it, and then complain about the fossils that have *not* been found ... the "missing" evidence.   Focusing on the evidence that has not yet been found instead of the evidence we *do* have right in front of us, is the opposite of how science evaluates evidence!|`|a781bc434ae321dd9513d859b0eee56baa	Archeopteryx has teeth.  No living birds do.  The skeletal structure has a mix of dinosaur-like and bird-like features.  Most notably, the pronounced keel for anchoring flight muscles is absent.<br>  <br>  There are numerous early feathered dinosaurs showing earlier flight and gliding features.  Yixianosaurus did not have sufficient wings for gliding, but feathers on the legs and tail provided additional lift.

Bones from dead animals are rare, fossilised bones are even rarer. There may have been millions of Archaeoteryx spread all over the Earth, but scientists have found only a few. Does that tell you anything?<br>  It is considered a transitional fossil because it has characteristics of both a dinosaur and a bird, namely both teeth and wings. However, this has become less of a surprise, since there have been fossil of skin imprints which suggest that many dinosaurs may have had feathers. <br>  You might well want to see a transition between lizard and birds, but, in fact, lizards did not evolve into birds.

Bats and bees can fly but they are not birds.  Ostriches, Penguins, and Emus can't fly, but they are birds.<br>  <br>  And, if you want a creature whose forelimbs were kinda in between wings and arms, look at Microraptor.|`|h4wNRqf9aa	this is a perfect example of the gaps arguement<br>  <br>  <br>  there's ALWAYS another transitional fossil... asking for EACH AND EVERY FOSSIL EVER is COMEPLETELY unreasonable, but would be the only way to convince anyone using this arguement<br>  <br>  you asking for the transition of the animal between dinos and dino-birds... seriously?  get a clue...|`|RtlL0PDcaa	Archaeopteryx is the first clear candidate for a transitional fossil between dinosaurs and birds.

AA11513203	You need to think of this a little deeper than just quoting "sciencemadesimple.com".<br>  <br>  Is the following statement scientific?<br>  <br>  Statement A: "The sun is made of hydrogen."   <br>  <br>  Of course Statement A is scientific.  But WHY?   Surely scientists can't *DIRECTLY* observe what the sun is made of.  We can't send probes to "land" on the sun and bring back a sample.   So we have to rely on *INDIRECT* observations of sunlight, and look for the tell-tale markers that show what hydrogen gas looks like in a spectrum.<br>  <br>  Statement B: "Oak trees come from acorns."<br>  <br>  Again, this is scientific.  But WHY?   No scientist can *DIRECTLY* observe an acorn growing to a fully mature oak tree in an "experiment" ... because oak trees can take 300 to 600 years to grow.  So instead we know this from *INDIRECT* observation. <br>  <br>  <br>  So if you can understand how we apply the scientific method to derive *INDIRECT* observations that show that Statements A and B are scientific ... then and only then can you understand that macroevolution is approached in the same way ... from *INDIRECT* observations ... the *tell-tale markers* in DNA that shows common genetics between individuals (and that these work just as well between species as they do for individuals of the same species) ... the existence of so much non-coding DNA ... the locations, stratigraphy, age, and structure of fossils ... and on and on and on.    <br>  <br>  To deny that evolution ... including both microevolution and macroevolution ... is scientific, reveals far more about your own lack of knowledge of how science works than it does about evolution.|`|WPPIaLORaa	You do not understand science at all.

If I tried to criticise the design of a nuclear reactor, knowing as little of the engineering and nuclear physics as I do, I would undoubtedly make a fool of myself.  If I was depending on the engineering explanations of a social philosopher to base my criticisms on, I don't think I would do much better.

Every cell has a membrane potential (a difference of charge between the inside and the outside of the cell) because of the differential distribution of charged ions.  Cells have relatively high concentrations of sodium and chloride outside (and low inside), and have relatively high concentrations of potassium inside (and low inside).  Because of this, there is a constant leakage (by diffusion, due to the concentration gradient) of potassium out of, and of sodium into, the cell.  Therefore, the cell must expend energy to maintain the appropriate concentrations.<br>  <br>  The sodium/potassium ATPase pump, in the cell membrane, does that.

When boys enter puberty a variety of changes occur. These changes will result in many, but not all boys experiencing episodes of embarrassing erections and wet dreams. If these episodes do occur there is no need to worry or feel guilty because they are part of normal sexual development. Many boys experience wet dreams between the ages of 12 to 18. Generally boys have less wet dreams once masturbation is begun or once puberty is over. Wet dreams are part of the many things that are changing in the body during puberty. Not all boys have wet dreams and that's normal too.

During the months of December through February, the southern hemisphere gets more than 12 hours of sunlight per day while the northtern hemisphere gets less than 12 hours per day.

f1beDbKIaa	Skylab had two goals.  First, the question was if humans could live and work in space.  The second was to actually do something that couldn't be done from the ground.  The project that was chosen was xray astronomy of the Sun.  X-ray astronomy can't be done from the ground because the atmosphere blocks them (a good thing, IMO).  At the time, x-ray astronomy by remote control wasn't feasible.  The Sun is quite a bright x-ray source, so the modest x-ray instruments that could be built at the time could be used.  And, the Sun is extraordinarily important to us back here on Earth.  Having some idea how it works is becoming increasingly important.  What are the cycles of the Sun?  What causes CME's?  How often do we get them?  Can they be predicted?  And so on.<br>  <br>  I'd be much harder pressed to talk about the significance of the ISS.|`|WkWedRnoaa	Rather than waiting around for someone to do your homework for you, why not just do a little searching on the web (google, wikipedia, etc) to find sources that you can read and then assemble into something that is your own?

This includes alligators and Caiman's.  <br>  You never said which crocodile your talking about so I could easily assume your talking about the African dwarf crocodile, which grows 190 Cm's in length.  <br>  <br>  Assuming however it is the SW Crocodile your talking about the Great white would win.  Special ed is a idiot SW crocs are sometimes found many miles out to sea. The ocean waters are to frigid for the SW croc to stay out there long, and because they often swim on the surface and not diving very far a the GW shark can easily do a attack from below much like it attacks seals. When breaching and given the fact the GWs can reach 5000 lbs and swim 25mph during a breach the impact on the croc could take it out.  <br>  <br>  The GW doesn't have the jaw pressure of a croc but it does have razor sharp serrated teeth that when held in a human hand can make deep cut marks in steal.  <br>  The GW also has a unique system of keeping itself warm and even though it has cold blood it can keep it's blood temperature warmer then the surrounding water, it's called the "rete mirabile" which is a system of veins and arteries warmed by working muscles and keep the inner parts of the shark warm up to 14 degrees warmer then the surrounding temperature. This ability gives the GW more energy and higher stamina then the SW croc, the croc will tire faster and then be killed by the shark.  <br>  The shark is also more at home in the ocean so it already has a greater chance. <br>  <br>  GW shark wins for sure|`|4c54zUjuaa	Salt water crocodiles do occasionally swim out into open ocean, and if a great white shark attacked there, it would probably be no contest. Great whites like to attack from below at very high speed. In this situation the shark would have both the element of surprise and access to the crocodile's relatively vulnerable belly. <br>  <br>  Crocodiles, on the other hand, would have more of an advantage in shallow water where they can sit on the bottom to protect their undersides. Crocodiles typically try to kill their prey by holding it underwater and drowning it. This would obviously not work on a shark, so the crocodile would have to rely on holding on to the shark long enough for it to bleed to death. A small great white shark may succumb this way, but if the shark is at least as long as the crocodile, I don't give the crocodile much of a chance. <br>  <br>  Given equal sized opponents, I would suggest that the shark would win in open water, and the fight would be a draw in shallow water.|`|FLgDn3OTaa	Crocodile.

They huge.<br>  <br>  If the crocodile would be able to prevent the shark from moving ( eg. cut fin, bite in jaw the front of the shark), it could get an advantage since the shark can't breathe. But as they both fall into the depths of the ocean, the crocodile needs to breath, so it swims up to the surface. The shark isn't totally lost. It's still alive. It sees the crocodile's vulnerable tummy. It swims quickly and BITE! <br>  <br>  Ding-ding! The Great Whit wins!<br>  <br>  ps. Saltwater crocodiles have been known to swim in seas in search for new habitats or food, so this scene might possibly happen.|`|YzrbkZggaa	it depends on the kind of crocodile you are talking about! if you ′re talking about a great saltwater crocodile, I believe  the crocodile would win  great!  besides having a very strong bite, saltwater crocodiles  have stroger muscles all over their bodies providing them being better prepared for both attacking and defending!  plus, the shark won′t get to bite the crocodile because its hard shell......|`|3BzLab9yaa	It would be close call.<br>  <br>  I think the shark would win as it's a lot bigger and sharper and more teeth.

Gnfc4wRlaa	This is kind of a two pronged question.  Chlorofluorocarbons are the main culprit in ozone depletion, but they don't, as CFC's, actually react with the ozone.  They break down, releasing Chlorine and Bromine, which actually react with the ozone layer.  If your teacher doesn't know this, the answer he/she will want is B.  If he/she does know this, the answer wanted will be C.  In other words, the true answer is C, but it stems from B.<br>  <br>  "All of these compounds (CFC's, methyl chloroform, carbon tetrachloride, Halons, and methyl bromide) have atmospheric lifetimes long enough to allow them to be transported by winds into the stratosphere.

ha5XzunHaa	there is one active ingredient: PCP. it is a pure compound, not a mixture of ingredients.|`|OUXO6g6Laa	It's a checmical, not a cake.  The full name is phenylcyclohexylpiperidine, which means it consists of a phenyl group, a cyclohexyl group, and piperidine.  You can look all of those up on Wikipedia if you're really interested.<br>  <br>  But what "goes into" the synthesis?  It depends on which synthesis you're talking about.  A brief look at Erowid shows seven different routes.  The simplest and supposedly most common of these starts with cyclohexanone, piperidine, and potassium cyanide or sodium cyanide to form PCC and then uses bromobenzene, phenyl grignard reagent, magnesium, and ether to get PCP.  Since you probably don't know much about chemistry, I'll go ahead and tell you that just because something is in the synthesis doesn't mean it's in the final product, which is just PCP.

You could make a very charming poster by incorporating a picture of sweet peas in the border.  The vines climb fences & are very sweet & beautiful.  They are mainly white, red, & pink. <br>  <br>  Genetics charts are also used to help people make decisions about whether to have children because certain conditions & tendencies can be inherited.  Singer Woodie Guthrie had such a disease that he passed on to his son Arlo Guthrie, also a singer.  Genetics is pretty interesting stuff. <br>  <br>  Some people believe that Mendel's results were too perfect & that he must have fudged his results.  In fact, there were some studies on scientists whose results turn out too perfect & wondering whether they had lied.  Then they discovered that kids as young as junior high age started lying about their experiments in science classes.  They would find out what the results were supposed to be, & that's what they reported in order to get good grades, even if they didn't see a thing happening.  It was on a PBS special years ago.  Their statistics would be interesting to see.  <br>  <br>  Your ideas for your poster sound good.  I love butterflies, & symmetry is a good topic.

Over the lower 48 those states are relatively north in latitude and have the best chances to tap arctic air from Canada and combine it with more moist air from the Gulf of Mexico/Atlantic Ocean to produce the strong low pressure systems/winter storms.

This allows the stomata to close sooner so less H2O is lost.<br>  <br>  3 - CAM changes how the stomate opening is timed so the gases are exchanged at night, and the CO2 is sequestered by the C4 pathway. Time delay plus physical CO2 storage.<br>  C4 is most common in regions with high temperatures and intense light where there is lots of light to offset the extra cost of gathering the CO2. These plants separate the C3 C4 cycles. This makes C4 water loss ~25% of a C3 plant, thus they conserve water. CAM adds a time delay by opening the stomata at night for CO2 uptake to the first step of the C4 path.<br>  This is why tropical grasslands are C4 and temperate forests are mostly C3. <br>  Typical C3 plants include: barley, sunflower, rice, tomatoes, wheat, peanuts, cotton, sugar beet, oats, and most trees. <br>  C4 is found in ~1/2 of the known grains, grasses & sedges plus maize, sugar cane, and millet.<br>  <br>  CAM is found in cacti, agaves, and some bromeliads
FY4cCjsOaa	(1) a, b, and c<br>  <br>  If you think about it, you should be able to satisfy yourself that each of the statements is true. Let's start with c (because it will be useful for one of the others) and work up.<br>  <br>  c. If two planes intersect, then they intersect in exactly one line.<br>  <br>   A line and any other point, not on that line, determine a plane. Therefore, if they intersect in more than one line, their intersection (which is part of both planes) determines a single plane, and the two planes would be identical (and therefore not intersecting).<br>  <br>  As to why the intersection is at least a line, I'll just have to ask you to imagine two intersecting planes. If they intersect in more than one point, then any two points of the intersection:<br>  - are in both planes, and<br>  - define a line, which must also be in both planes.<br>  <br>  This doesn't cover the possibility that the intersection between the planes might be a single point. I can't think of a formal proof, off the top of my head, but if you imagine two intersecting planes, I hope you can see that they can't intersect that way.<br>  <br>  b. If a plane intersects two parallel planes, then the intersection is two parallel lines.<br>  <br>  Knowing (from c) that the intersection of two planes is a line, we know that these intersections are two lines. Both are in the intersecting plane, but because they are also in the parallel planes, they cannot meet. Therefore, they are parallel.<br>  <br>  a. Through a given point on a plane, there is only one line perpendicular to the given plane.<br>  <br>  Suppose there were more than one line perpendicular to the plane through a given point (which we will call A). Then these two perpendicular lines must meet the plane at two different points (or else they would be the same line). Call these two points B and C, and consider triangle ABC. It has two right angles (at B and C). That's impossible.<br>  <br>  Our supposition must be wrong, and therefor there is only one line perpendicular to the plane through point A. Since the plane and point A can be any given plane and point not on that plane, this proof applies in general.|`|6bca9f7fb5c095a46621e8ac664fc41faa	(1) a,b, and c

Now y^2 - x^2 can be factored into (y^2 - x^2) = (y+x)*(y-x) so the last eqaution can be rewritten as <br>  <br>  (y+x) * (y-x) = 175 (call this Equation A)<br>  <br>  we also know from the larger triangle that<br>  <br>  (x + y)^2 = 15^2 + 20^2  or (x+y)^2 = 625 or  x+ y = 25<br>  <br>  So take what we have now learned about x+y and substitute it into Equation A<br>  <br>  (y+x) * (y-x) = 175 or 25 * (y-x) = 175 a simple division yields (y-x) = 7<br>  <br>  So now we know<br>  x+ y = 25<br>  y - x = 7<br>  <br>  I will leave it to you to find x and y from there.

J4cSgIreaa	As with any medicine, side effects can occur with Abilify (aripiprazole). However, not everyone who takes the medication will experience side effects. In fact, most people tolerate Abilify well. If side effects do occur, in most cases, they are minor and either require no treatment or can easily be treated by you or your healthcare provider.<br>  <br>  Anxiety, headaches, and insomnia are among the common side effects reported with Abilify. Side effects that are not as common include hemorrhoids, gas, and acne. Certain side effects are more serious and should be reported to your healthcare provider. These can include feelings of restlessness or jitteriness, high blood pressure, or abnormal muscle movements.

Gnfc4wRlaa	No, it isn’t.  None of the claims by the doomsday prophets are based on science, just wild speculation.<br>  The Mayans didn’t predict doomsday.  It is just the end of the current cycle of their Long Count calendar.<br>  Nostradamus didn’t predict it.  He never mentioned 2012 and all the Nostradamus "quotes" being thrown around aren't what he actually wrote. They are what some people have decided that he meant. Even Nostradamus scholars don't agree on how the various centuries and quatrains should be interpreted.<br>  The Bible never mentions 2012 or references it in any way.  It talks about the end times, but there is no mention of when.<br>  There is no actual scientific theory or evidence that anything unusual is going to happen in 2012. It is a collection of myths and disproven theories being promulgated by doomsday predictors, who predict a new one every few years. <br>  This timing is based on the end of the current cycle of the Mayan long count calendar. Their calendar was done in ages or cycles and their years ended at the winter solstice.  The current cycle ends December 21, 2012.  The Mayans didn’t predict the end of the world, only the end of that cycle.<br>  <br>  Nibiru (Planet X) doesn't exist. Zecharia Sitchin is not a scientist, but is an author of books promoting the ancient astronaut theory for human origins. He attributes the creation of the ancient Sumerian culture to the Annunaki (or Nephilim) from a hypothetical planet named Nibiru in the solar system. The Doomsayers predicted that it was to hit Earth in 2003. Undaunted when it didn't show up, they just moved it out to 2012 to coincide with the end of the current cycle of the Mayan calendar. <br>  <br>  Alignment of Solar System with galactic plane – There is no galactic alignment occurring in 2012.  It takes 36 years to precess through galactic equator, and we will be 6 degrees off in 2012.  Even if we did have an alignment, it would have no effect on us.  The vast distances involved outweigh the effects of gravity.<br>  <br>  Planetary alignment – it is impossible for all the planets to form a straight line out from the Sun (or viewed superimposed on each other in the sky) because each planetary orbit is tilted slightly with respect to the Earth's orbit.  John Gribbin in the late 1970's book  The Jupiter Effect  predicted the end of the world would occur in 1983 due a once in a millennium planetary alignment.   The 1983 event was ALL the other planets lined up as seen in our view of the sky -- not in a straight line as most people would misinterpret with the term alignment.  In 1999, The Survival Center had claimed the destruction of the Earth to occur in May 2000 due to the "planetary alignment."<br>  <br>  Asteroid Apophis - the collision alert was for 2029, and was canceled after additional observations showed it would not hit us.<br>  <br>  Geomagnetic reversal - These reversals of the magnetic field have occurred in the past, as shown by magnetic striping, but we can’t predict when they will occur again.  However, the time between reversals is not constant, varying from less than 100,000 years, to tens of millions of years. <br>  <br>  Although fast by geological standards, reversals are by no means quick on the human time scale. They take roughly 5,000 years, with estimates ranging from 1,000 years to 8,000 years.<br>  <br>  Homo Erectus and their ancestors survived previous reversals. There is no evidence of any extinctions resulting from these reversals. Although the inspection of past reversals does not indicate biological extinctions, present society with its reliance on electricity and electromagnetic effects (e.g. radio, satellite communications) may be vulnerable to technological disruptions in the event of a full field reversal. <br>  <br>  Photon belt - We are not heading for a photon belt in the Pleiades. The earth isn't heading toward the Pleiades but away from them. In the 1850s it was conjectured that the earth orbited the Pleiades, but this has long since been discredited. No photon belt or other such region of increased energy has been discovered. Photons in any case are merely particles of electromagnetic energy, which we commonly experience as light. Upon exposure to excess photons the most common transformation of your being is sunburn. <br>  <br>  Solar flares – These do increase and decrease in an eleven year cycle. They haven't caused any serious problems in the past. The direct effects of solar flares are mainly related to communications and radio transmissions.

AA11824362	Your question doesn't make much sense. I think this is you are asking: Why are continents higher in elevation than ocean basins?<br>  No process is involved, it is a simple matter of density differences. Oceanic crust is 3000 kilograms per cubic meter and continental crust is 2700 kilograms per cubic meter. Since the upper mantle has a density of 3300 grams per cubic meter, isostacy dictates that oceanic crust will displace more of the mantle than continental crust.

lIEUegRiaa	First of all, you'd need a wider gene-pool that just one family per planet, otherwise there would be only your brothers or sisters to breed with...<br>  <br>  Second, food and water to get the colonists where they were going is all well and good, but what will they do when they arrive?<br>  <br>  There would have to be the technology to build an environmentally sealed habitat, safe from Venusian air pressure and immense heat, safe from the sandstorms of Mars, safe from bombardment by cosmic rays and unmitigated solar radiation. Would you be sending the same generic habitat module to each planet? Or would you tailor each family's habitat to the destination planet? In any case, it's a difficult feat, technologically speaking. <br>  <br>  Immediately upon landing, the habitat has to be able to get power, protect the inhabitants, and allow easy access to the outside. <br>  You'd have to bring your soil with you, because until you have tested you local mineral deposits, you don't know what you are going to have to work with on your new planet. <br>  <br>  And of course, you're not going to try to 'land' on Jupiter or the other outer planets, but they all have moons with solid surfaces, so you could plonk down your habitat on one of those. <br>  <br>  You'd need to have a fully self-sufficient biosphere planned before you set out. Probably small animals rather than large ones. Chickens, because they are small, simple and produce eggs regularly for your protein. <br>  Plants would need to be fast growing and high yield, but you'd probably need to do some selective breeding on your new planet to maximize output based on the local set of nutrients. The soil you brought with you from Earth will only be fertile for so long unless you are able to replenish it with compost and local minerals. <br>  <br>  Large animals are out of the question. They take too much energy to feed, and give too much waste. Human beings are the only large animal you'll ever see again. You might need to bring honey bees or some kind of benign insect in order to pollinate your plants, unless you wanted to do all that manually, which might be okay inside your habitat. <br>  <br>  But there will be no natural ecosystems to exploit, no herds, no fields, no forests.

K6LwyKWcaa	I am not positive but I don't think you can get it out of your system in 24 hours. your best bet is to go to GNC and buy a drink called "stip". My friend works there and when I had a drug test he told me that was the BEST product they had and do not settle for detox pills because they are a waste of money. However, the drink is a bit pricy (around fifty dollars). If you are worried about a drug test for this interview I recomend diluting your urine. to do this simply drink a lot of water, tea, basically just liquids in general, however no alcohol or sugary drinks as these willcause your kidneyes to filter out the alcohol/sugar instead of the xanex. Drink the water/tea VERY frequently. you should be going to the bathroom about every hour the night before and then about every 20-30 minutes a few hours leading up to the test. The only drawback to this is that they might question the results due to the diluted sample and ask you to take another test, but at least it will buy you a bit more time. Good luck with the drug test and I hope this helps.<br>  <br>  P.S. I'm sorry about the loss of your pet. Goodluck with the job interview :-)|`|EN32vSsCaa	Sorry about your pet.

I drink quite a bit of coffee and usually had consumed at least three or four cups before I knew anything about the drug test, that may have helped. I wouldn't worry about it, go to the interview with confidence and if you do fail a drug test they will know what it is and may ask you about it, if so just tell them the story. If they are pet owners they will understand, if not it probably wasn't that great of a job.   <Good Luck>

bxxmaycraa	The natural frequency, or frequencies, of any physical system or object are the frequencies at which it will vibrate if physically disturbed.<br>   <br>  Resonance is the phenomenon that occurs when a physical system is periodically disturbed at the same period of one of its natural frequencies.<br>  <br>  Even small amplitude disturbances will then reinforce the energy stored in the system, causing the amplitude of the vibration to increase.<br>  <br>  This will continue until the energy loss in the physical system due to non-elastic motion (resistive loss) equals the energy supplied by the disturbing force.  In extreme cases, the system will exceed its limits and self-destruct before equilibrium occurs.<br>  <br>  The above is true of any physical system<br>  a:  Tuning forks disturb the air around the fork, and the air transmits the periodicity of the tuning fork motion to one's ear.  In reverse, striking the piano key causes the piano sounding board to vibrate and disturb the surrounding air which reaches the tuning fork and, if the frequency is the same as the natural frequency of the tuning fork, it will start to vibrate in your hand.<br>  <br>  As for electromagnetic systems, they are just different physical systems, their energy being stored in the electric and magnetic fields, and their natural frequencies being determined by their physical construction and the relations between that construction and the rates at which their energies may be built up or dissipated.|`|6a29fa9432cd11f6628b8d1ef1265ca6aa	The resonance frequency of a system is the frequency it naturally oscillates at.<br>  <br>  For instance a tuning fork has a resonance  frequency. Every time you hit it it ocsillates at that frequency. A violin string also has a resonance frequency. The resonance frequency of a mechanically system is a function of its size and the materials it is made from. A thicker violin string has a lower resonance frequency. A thicker tuning fork has a lower resonance frequency. Perhaps the simplist system that has a resonance frequency is a pendulum. It's frequency is set by it's length. The longer the pendulum, the lower the frequency. <br>  <br>  Electromagnetic induction is the same as magnetic induction. When a magnetic field collapes or expands around a conductor a current is induced in the conductor.|`|SYZQZGesaa	Think of resonance as an ideal flow, harmony or balance. In circuits, reaching a resonant frequency means that the resistors and capacitors, for instance, are just the right value for the signal or oscillation speed. It is somewhat of a phenomenon because when you tune to "resonance", you see current increase or resistance decrease through the circuit. <br>  <br>  From a vibration standpoint, all the various items on an object such as a violin also have this resonant or ideal frequency. When in this ideal mode, the energy is best utilized and conditions are optimal which explains the other violin vibrating. Another example would be a bridge. Bridges were known to collapse from wind gusts that shouldn't have been strong enough to do this. What happened was the wind blew just right to cause a hum to occur - like a wind instrument. AS this hit resonance with the steel and concrete, the vibration intensified and traveled all across the structure.<br>  <br>  Inductance from natural or electromagnets is essentially the same. In the natural magnet, a force does not have to be applied to cause the effect whereas in the electromagnet (artificial) it does. Each electron has some magnetic field about it. When these are multiplied in mass and then focused on some item such as a metal bar, the field intensifies to a usable level.|`|H6COtFH4aa	REsonance is the phenomena which occurs in a.c ckt.where both inductor & capacitor are used.<br>  two type<br>  1.series<br>  2.parallel<br>  The ability of radio reciver to select a correct frequency ,transmitted by broad casting station & elliminate frequency frm other station.<br>  it is given by;<br>  f=1/(2*3.142*sq rt of(lc)).->for resonant frequency..

None of the claims by the doomsday prophets are based on science, just wild speculation.<br>  <br>  The Mayans didn’t predict doomsday.  It is just the end of the current cycle of their Long Count calendar.<br>  <br>  Nostradamus didn’t predict it.  He never mentioned 2012 and all the Nostradamus "quotes" being thrown around aren't what he actually wrote. They are what some people have decided that he meant. Even Nostradamus scholars don't agree on how the various centuries and quatrains should be interpreted.<br>  <br>  The Bible never mentions 2012 or references it in any way.  It talks about the end times, but there is no mention of when.<br>  <br>  There is no actual scientific theory or evidence that anything unusual is going to happen in 2012. It is a collection of myths and disproven theories being promulgated by doomsday predictors, who predict a new one every few years. <br>  This timing is based on the end of the current cycle of the Mayan long count calendar. Their calendar was done in ages or cycles and their years ended at the winter solstice.  The current cycle ends December 21, 2012.  The Mayans didn’t predict the end of the world, only the end of that cycle.<br>  <br>  Nibiru (Planet X) doesn't exist. Zecharia Sitchin is not a scientist, but is an author of books promoting the ancient astronaut theory for human origins. He attributes the creation of the ancient Sumerian culture to the Annunaki (or Nephilim) from a hypothetical planet named Nibiru in the solar system. The Doomsayers predicted that it was to hit Earth in 2003. Undaunted when it didn't show up, they just moved it out to 2012 to coincide with the end of the current cycle of the Mayan calendar. <br>  <br>  Alignment of Solar System with galactic plane – There is no galactic alignment occurring in 2012.  It takes 36 years to precess through galactic equator, and we will be 6 degrees off in 2012.  Even if we did have an alignment, it would have no effect on us.  The vast distances involved outweigh the effects of gravity.<br>  <br>  Planetary alignment – it is impossible for all the planets to form a straight line out from the Sun (or viewed superimposed on each other in the sky) because each planetary orbit is tilted slightly with respect to the Earth's orbit.  John Gribbin in the late 1970's book  The Jupiter Effect  predicted the end of the world would occur in 1983 due a once in a millennium planetary alignment.   The 1983 event was ALL the other planets lined up as seen in our view of the sky -- not in a straight line as most people would misinterpret with the term alignment.  In 1999, The Survival Center had claimed the destruction of the Earth to occur in May 2000 due to the "planetary alignment."<br>  <br>  Asteroid Apophis - the collision alert was for 2029, and was canceled after additional observations showed it would not hit us.<br>  <br>  Geomagnetic reversal - These reversals of the magnetic field have occurred in the past, as shown by magnetic striping, but we can’t predict when they will occur again.  However, the time between reversals is not constant, varying from less than 100,000 years, to tens of millions of years. <br>  <br>  Although fast by geological standards, reversals are by no means quick on the human time scale. They take roughly 5,000 years, with estimates ranging from 1,000 years to 8,000 years.<br>  <br>  Homo Erectus and their ancestors survived previous reversals. There is no evidence of any extinctions resulting from these reversals. Although the inspection of past reversals does not indicate biological extinctions, present society with its reliance on electricity and electromagnetic effects (e.g. radio, satellite communications) may be vulnerable to technological disruptions in the event of a full field reversal. <br>  <br>  Photon belt - We are not heading for a photon belt in the Pleiades. The earth isn't heading toward the Pleiades but away from them. In the 1850s it was conjectured that the earth orbited the Pleiades, but this has long since been discredited. No photon belt or other such region of increased energy has been discovered. Photons in any case are merely particles of electromagnetic energy, which we commonly experience as light. Upon exposure to excess photons the most common transformation of your being is sunburn. <br>  <br>  Solar flares – These do increase and decrease in an eleven year cycle. They haven't caused any serious problems in the past. The direct effects of solar flares are mainly related to communications and radio transmissions.

AA10335036	The voltage V, which equals the PE of the electron in electron-volt (e-V) units, is very simple to calculate.

I'll echo the 1st answer's complaint that we aren't given signs, and we also lack units.<br>  OK, the formula for V is:<br>  V = kq/r, where k = 8.98755 N-m^2/C^2 and r is the distance between the electron and charge q.

HyUE9ON0aa	Habitat and natural range: <br>  <br>  Rousettus aegyptiacus is found in Southern, Western, and Eastern Africa, Egypt, the Middle East, and Cypress, There are three subspecies R. a. aegyptiacus, found in North Africa, Cypress and the Middle East; R. a. Leachi, from Eastern and Soutthern Africa; and R. a. Occidentalis, from Western Africa. However, they only occur where there are suitable caves for roosting and freedom from human disturbance. <br>  <br>  This species is unique among bats of the Megachiroptera in choosing to roost in caves instead of forming the familiar ‘camps’ like those of the flying foxes. Some of the more noteworthy roosting caves of this species are found in such remote locations as on Mount Cameroon at elevations of 6400 feet or 2000 meters. In 1810, this species was found roosting in the passages of the pyramids at Giza. Other substantial roosts are found in the Nile Valley as far north as the Mediterranean Sea. Aside from caves, other roost sites chosen by this species include dark ruins, deep cellars, Roman Aqueducts and burial chambers in Egypt. They are known for roosting in very large colonies. <br>  <br>  Wherever this species chooses to roost, they do so in large numbers. In fact, mass colonies of this species are among the largest animal groupings in the world. They prefer large caves, and usually roost on flat cave ceilings relatively close to the cave entrance. Dog Bats have a very unique way of roosting. These bats hang, tightly packed together in very close groups with both sexes and ages mixed together. The larger the colony, the more they crowd together, and the more aggressive and quarrelsome they seem to the human observer. There is a constant din of their squabbling and fighting throughout the day. It would seem to the observer that they never sleep. These bats fight over roosting spots, females and food. They do this with their wings half open, but with their mouths closed. It appears as though they are ‘boxing’ with each other with their wings. This fighting is symbolic, and is accompanied with loud screeching. As a rule, the bats rarely injure each other.<br>   <br>  ? Natural diet: Although the full extent of the natural diet of this species is unknown, it is known that Rousettus feed upon a huge variety of fruits of tropical shrubs and trees and are known to fly vast distances to find ripe fruit in season particularly ripe figs. <br>  <br>  ?

l0SN3nWCaa	Humans already use reverse transcriptases such as telomerase, which adds sequences to the DNA chain at the telomere area of the chromosome. These repeated sequences protect the chromosome from damage. <br>  Reverse transcriptase inhibitors are used to treat people suffering from retroviral diseases such as HIV. These drugs are similar to the nucleotides in humans, so now the virus may use this reverse transcriptase inhibitor nucleotide instead of one already present in the cell. This new nucleotide has a different composition and will disrupt transcription because it won't bond with the nucleotides found naturally in the body. This leads to an unfinished DNA chain.<br>  The thing is because the nucleotides are so similar to nucleotides of human cells, what's stopping the human cells from taking up these nucleotides when our DNA is being duplicated? This isn't too much of a problem in humans as we use DNA polymerase, which halts at a defective or foreign nucleotide and allows nucleotide excision repair to fix the problem.|`|b9c206476271de6c0a321ebe042eb7f6aa	It has - on mRNA, anyway, to make cDNA for recombination into prokaryotes.|`|BAcAbtIZaa	In what context? Do you mean to lengthen the telomeres to prevent or reverse aging in some way?

Just like the invention of PCR for DNA amplification someone will have to take acid and drive down the highway until it comes to them! But seriously, don't do drugs :)

Gmvldblraa	Each of the data points on the graph will have error bars showing the uncertainty associated with each reading.<br>  the best fit line cuts through as close to the centre of as many of these data points as possible. The "worst fit line" cuts through the error bars as close as possible to the top and bottom of the error bars, while still touching them.<br>  So it isn't just any old line....<br>  One rule about the worst fit line..... it MUST cross the best  fit line. So the easy way to draw it is to take your top data point and start at the top of your "Y" direction error bar. Go to the bottom data point ( the other end of the line) and find the bottom end of the "Y" direction error bar. Join the two with a straight line - that's your "error" line - a much better name for it than "worst fit" .<br>  <br>  Just relax a bit about the teacher....."worst fit" really is a silly name and you are right in that it can be misleading, but teachers try to keep things popular, and have to rush on and there are so many of you , the students and it seems so obvious to the teacher........smile , forgive them, find out for yourself and think...you could come to grasp the amazing stuff physics has to offer, with no help from the teachers - how impressive is that?<br>  And tell him to change the name....., error line, uncertainty line....anything but worst fit line.|`|t5Nrj6Txaa	There are very standard way of determining the quality of a fit, but they are likely above your grade level.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chi-square_distribution" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chi-square_...</a><br>  <br>  Because of this, it's a common place behavior in physics education to make something up that takes the place of the actual way of doing things, like "percent error" and other garbage.<br>  <br>  So, the point is that's it's supposed to be easy, not rigorous.

b52af1d124dc0f4c77d464ddd9f35cddaa	Most neurons have many thousands of inputs from other neurons, sensory inputs, etc.  Some of the inputs are positive, and some are negative.  These inputs are said to "sum."  If there are sufficient positive (excitatory) inputs to cause a depolarization to threshold, then an action potential (AP) will be fired.  <br>  <br>  Summation that can make a neuron more likely to fire an AP can be spatial or temporal.  Let's take the example of sensing the touch of something on the skin of your arm.  If a larger area is touched, then more neurons, with sensory endings in that area of your arm will fire.  If those multiple sensory inputs converge on the same neuron, each of them sending excitatory signals, will make the neuron they all innervate more likely to fire an AP.<br>  <br>  Similarly, temporal summation can occur.  If a stimulus is larger than usual, it causes the sensory nerves to send excitatory messages much more quickly than usual.  Each additional excitatory message causes more depolarization in the neuron they innervate, again making it more likely to fire an AP.|`|8y72SEoLaa	ur mom occurs

f1beDbKIaa	By the IAU definition, Pluto is not a planet, as it has not "cleared it's orbit".<br>  <br>  Pluto is a Dwarf Planet.  Now one can argue that Dwarf Planets are planets.  But around 1850, when Ceres got kicked out of the Planet club, it became the first (and at the time largest) Minor Planet.  Now that we're finding small rocks that we can track, and giving them Minor Planet numbers, one can really say that being a Minor Planet is not the same thing as being a planet.  And, Pluto has a Minor Planet number.<br>  <br>  What the IAU means by "cleared it's orbit" is not very clear.  There are hundreds of Earth crossing asteroids (Minor Planets).  And although the Earth has some gravitational influence on them (and so does Pluto), these objects are not, in general, in any kind of resonance with the Earth.  This suggests that the Earth should be given a Minor Planet number.

duIpmozQaa	A thyristor is a four-layer semiconductor that is often used for handling large amounts of power. While a thyristor can be turned on or off, it can also regulate power using something called phase angle control. This allows the amount of power output to be controlled by adjusting the angle of the current input. An example of this is the a dimmer switch for a light.<br>  <br>  While thyristors have the advantage of using phase angle control and handling large amounts of power, they are not as suitable for low power applications. This is because they can only be turned off by switching the direction of the current. For this reason, a thyristor may take longer to turn on or off that other semiconductors. Also, thyristors can only conduct in one direction, making them impractical for applications that require current to be conducted to and from each device.|`|AA12145054	The thyristor is a solid-state semiconductor device with four layers of alternating N and P-type material. They act as bistable switches, conducting when their gate receives a current pulse, and continue to conduct for as long as they are forward biased (that is, as long as the voltage across the device has not reversed).

AjM9c5oZaa	Well, the light reflects off of objects and shines into the eye. The cornea bends the light into the eye through the pupil (the hole in the middle) Next, The lens in the eye bends the light and focuses it onto the retina at the back of the eye. The retina is light sensitive and contains the receptors (called rods and cone cells) this then sends impulses down the optic nerve to the brain. <br>  <br>  I hope this helps you and i explained it clear enough to understand  :)  hehe|`|b52af1d124dc0f4c77d464ddd9f35cddaa	There are specialized light receptors, called rods and cones, in the retina of the eye.  The rods are very sensitive to light; the cones give you color vision.  Both types of receptor send signals to the brain, which are interpreted as sight.

YHNK9UrQaa	Exercise serves to increase respiratory fitness.  In a nut shell, this means increasing aerobic capacity.  With each breath, a fit individual can breathe in a greater volume of air (which includes oxygen) and can expell a greater volume of carbon dioxide.  As a result, fit individuals are more efficient at bringing oxygen into the blood stream and at removing carbon dioxide from the blood stream.<br>  <br>  Exercise strengthens the muscles involved in the breathing process:  The diaphragm (found below the lungs) and the intercostal muscles (found between the ribs).<br>  <br>  Individuals who enjoy respiratory fitness should have no problem blowing out their birthday candles.
iTetA3oCaa	nitrates exist as NO3- and are highly soluble.  As such they move readily to the roots and are  highly available to the plants.  They are also subject to leaching and if they move out of the root zone they can eventually cause contamination of the ground water.  This is highly dependent on soil texture.  Intensive farming, if care is taken to apply the nitrogen in a timely matter as the crop needs it and care is taken not to push it out of the root zone with excessive irrigation (this can come from excessive rainfall too.) there is little residual effect.<br>  the amount of nitrate is close associated with the amount of Carbon Dioxide that can be sequestered in a given soil Horizon as it is an essential constituent in humus (a lignin type compound) and one unit of nitrogen will retain about 7 to 10 units of carbon.  This will gradually be released for plant growth or additional decomposition of added organic matter.  Corn stalks for instance run a ratio of about 100 units of carbon to 1 or 2 units of nitrogen and take a long time to get to where they will release nitrogen for crop growth.  the excess carbon is released to the air as carbon dioxide so addition of nitrogen to corn stalks is beneficial in reducing soil Carbon Dioxide emissions.  Since this Carbon Dioxide is released in the field and more rapidly in the growing season it is normally always reabsorbed into the current growth.  Legumes on the other hand run about 15 to 20 units of carbon to a unit of nitrogen and withing one growing season start to release nitrogen for plant growth.|`|E0j6mhqhaa	mattsbro is talking about legume plants when he talks about bacteria on the roots of those plants enabling the plant to take N from the air and convert it into a usable form on the plant roots.  Legumes are never plants in the grass family but are plants such as clovers, alfalfa, lespedeza, beans, certain forbs, Black Locust, Kentucky Coffeetree and Redbud trees.<br>  <br>  Here's the easy way to remember what the three main nutrients do for plants.  Nitrogen promotes plant growth, phosphrus promotes stalk strength and potassium is necessary for seed production.  Grass plants need large amounts of N, less P and even less K, but legumes require no added N, quite a bit of P and large amounts of K.<br>  <br>  As far as intensive farming goes, high yields require more fertilizer.  Corn is a heavy user of N and as the amount applied increases, there is a diminishing return.  In other words, it may take 100 lbs of N to produce a 100 bushel per acre corn crop, but 200 lbs of N to produce 150 bu and 300 lbs to produce 200 bu.  <br>  <br>  Tillage of the soil allows soil microbes to break down organic matter and release nitrogen in turn.  The more tillage, the more organic matter is "burned up" and the more N released until diminishing amounts of OM limit N release.  The loss of OM caused by lots of tillage was the cause of many "worn out" farms in the 1800's and early 1900's.  No till planting and herbicides that eliminate the need for cultivation has allowed many soils to actually begin increasing OM levels, something that was unheard of before herbicides came along.|`|Erx6YeqQaa	Nitrates in soil are strings of nitrogen. Plans the the N2 out of the air and on knobs on the roots the N2 undergoes a process called nitrogen fixation where the N2 becomes N3 which is a form of nitrogen that the plant can use. A plant would rather take it out of the soil than make it because it requires energy. When a plant dies the nitrates are left in the soil for other plants to use. Intensive farming uses up these nitrates which causes the need for farmers to use fertilizer on their crops.|`|7HKTDcvYaa	Nitrate is a nitric oxide radicle, nitrogen plus oxygen forced together by an enzymatic process either in a bacteria  or in a factory.  When alone in water, nitrate is nitric acid. <br>  <br>  Nitrate is also a used in creating protein, so we can not grow food without it. Nitrate then is a limit to growth for every plant.<br>  <br>  If, in intensive farming we add more nitrate fertilizer we raise the limit to growth, and in so doing cause the plant to use up other nutrients until those other nutrients become limits to growth. This can leave a soil depleted of other nutrients, needing them to be supplemented, or we may be able to wait a few years for the rock particles to further break down, releasing the other nutrients.<br>  <br>  In particular, nutrients potassium and phosphate  are also limits to growth. adding extra nitrate can quickly cause deficiencies in these fertilizer components to become a problem. But there are 12 soil nutrients that can become significantly short if we add too much nitrate.|`|O9FojdEMaa	nitrogen along with potassium and phosphorus are the three main nutrients for plant growth although there are several more they are mostly referred to as micro nutrients since only a small percentage is required. intensive farming tends to delete these nutrients from the soil.

PsCCd63yaa	Not to be picky, but you've got the equivalent of mathematical sentence fragments there. :)  you have to say the antiderivative of (1/2)e^-2x*dx, and the derivative WITH RESPECT TO Y of e^y (also known as d/dy e^y).  The easiest way to show you why this is important now in calculus is that if you're taking the derivative of ax^2 with respect to x, you get 2ax... but if you take the derivative of x^2*a with respect to a, you get x^2.  It gets REALLY important in the third semester of most calculus programs.<br>  <br>  Enough of that - time for answers!  The first one, assuming you have a dx at the end, isn't that tough.  First, know that derivatives and integrals of exponentials tend to give back the SAME exponential.  So, try taking the derivative of e^-2x and see if that gives you what you want.  <br>  d/dx (e^-2x) = d/dx (-2x) * e^-2x by the chain rule.<br>  -2 * e^-2x<br>  <br>  Close...but no cigar.  We're off by a CONSTANT factor of -1/4.  If our answer is multiplied by -1/4, it'd be perfect.  So let's try multiplying our original guess by -1/4:<br>  <br>  d/dx (-1/4)(e^-2x) = <br>  (-1/4) * d/dx (e^-2x) =<br>  (-1/4)* (-2*e^-2x) =<br>  (1/2) * e^-2x<br>  <br>  Oh, and stick in a +C, because you can shift the graph up/down as you please and you'd get the same slope.<br>  <br>  Now, the second question really depends on what you mean by "the derivative of e^y".  If you mean that you're given x = e^y, and you want to find dy/dx, then you can solve for y in terms of x to get a normal function:<br>  <br>  x = e^y<br>  ln x = ln (e^y)<br>  ln x = y<br>  f(x) = ln x <br>  f'(x) = 1/x<br>  Or, since x = e^y, you can also say that dy/dx = 1/e^y<br>  <br>  If you just want to find d/dy of e^y, then it's just e^y.<br>  <br>  Notice the difference...one is taking d/dx, and the other is taking d/dy.|`|ow3LGXEqaa	Exponential functions are the most straightforward to differentiate and integrate as they don't change their form when these operations are applied to them. In other words, the answer to your second question:<br>  <br>  d(e^y)/dy = e^y<br>  <br>  It's as simple as that. A general equation for this is as follows:<br>  <br>  If f(x) = e^kx<br>  <br>  then f '(x) = ke^kx<br>  <br>  This is because of the chain rule (if you want to know more on this, I'll let you know) which means that with a nested function (you have the function kx inside) you need to remember to multiply by its derivative as well. The reverse applies for integration:<br>  <br>  If f(x) = (1/2)e^-2x<br>  <br>  then ∫f(x)dx = -(1/2)*(1/2)e^-2x<br>  <br>  => ∫f(x)dx = -(1/4)e^-2x<br>  <br>  Because here we have to divide by the derivative of the inside function.<br>  <br>  Hope the answer was helpful.|`|skGZk140aa	(a) -1/4 e^(-2x)<br>  (b) e^y (yes, that's true , function = derivative)|`|jRJBs4hxaa	If y is a function of x, the derivative of e^y is e^y (dy/dx)<br>  <br>  The antiderivative of (1/2) e^(-2x)<br>  (1/2) ∫e^(-2x) dx<br>  let u=2x<br>  du=2x dx<br>  dx =(1/2) du<br>  (1/2) ∫e^(-2x) dx = (1/2)  ∫ (1/2) e^-u du<br>  = (1/4)  ∫  e^-u du<br>  = (1/4) (-e^-u) + C<br>  = -e^-2x/4 + C

M6AySVxOaa	Well, I could stay it is a study of the development of an embryo. But to really understand what that means. You could go to a breeding farm an get some day old fertilized eggs. You see you can't use just any old eggs because the hen at an egg farm never see a roster she just lays eggs that are unfertilized and will never develop into baby chicks. So once you have got your 4 dozen fertilize chicks, you get a big Syracuse dish and a binocular microscope and a book on chicken embryology. You then crack an egg each day and observe its development and match it with the pictures in the book. You may even want to take your own pictures of the daily developement of your embryos. Some day your eggs won't be any good and you will have to crack two eggs. <br>      The care of the eggs is important since that keeps them alive. You would have to store them on something soft like cotton or hey at a temperature of around 100 degrees. The eggs would have to be rotated (turn around) twice a day. Towards the end of the experiment you will probably hatch some baby chick that will love you an think you are there mother.

O3TuQZItaa	One hundred years ago, welding was limited to small areas, primarily by hammer welding. Gas welding was just starting to be introduced. The only metal commonly welded were ferrous.<br>  <br>  Welding is now done by gas, arc, and electron beam. Dissimilar metals can now be welded.|`|XCzpQvDvaa	In the last 100 years welding has advanced considerably. We can now weld almost any metal together and the machines that we use to do are much more reliable and produce a higher quality weld deposit. Early welding was limited to forge welding by a blacksmith but even in the early 1900's shielded metal arc welding was just starting to be developed into a useable process but was still unreliable due to the flux of the time and the power supply of the welding machines. by the 1920's i believe they started to use Wire fed processes like metal inert gas( common Mig) as power supplys were more reliable and shielding gases were becoming available.

Helium would be little more than a trace gas, a few parts per million at most in any atmosphere because if its tendency to be blown into space by the solar wind.  CO2 is the primary componant of Venus's and Mars's atmospheres.
Gnfc4wRlaa	The outermost part of the Earth's interior is made up of two layers: above is the lithosphere, comprising the crust and the rigid uppermost part of the mantle. Below the lithosphere lies the asthenosphere. Although solid, the asthenosphere has relatively low viscosity and shear strength and can flow like a liquid on geological time scales. The deeper mantle below the asthenosphere is more rigid again due to the higher pressure.<br>  The lithosphere is broken up into what are called tectonic plates — in the case of Earth, there are seven major and many minor plates (see list below). The lithospheric plates ride on the asthenosphere. These plates move in relation to one another at one of three types of plate boundaries: convergent, or collisional boundaries; divergent boundaries, also called spreading centers; and transform boundaries. Earthquakes, volcanic activity, mountain-building, and oceanic trench formation occur along plate boundaries. The lateral movement of the plates is typically at speeds of 50–100 mm annually.<br>  <br>  The only planet on which this process has been observed is Earth.|`|QgXN2kB6aa	earth. <br>  ok so put some different colored pieces of plastic on the surface of water, now boil the water, as the plastic moves you see the basic idea of plate tectonics.

Liquids cannot transmit a shear wave. All that a liquid can transmit is a primary wave, also known as a p-wave or pressure wave. A pressure wave is like a sound wave.

p0SOWgb5aa	Yes. <br>  If there was some scientific or conservational value (Say captive breeding of endangered species) I might hesitate but captivity for entertainment is plainly selfish and cruel. They have little if any educational value and their breeding programs have nothing to do with conservation.<br>  <br>  I am pretty much completely against cetaceans in captivity. Cetaceans are large bodied fast moving animals with highly advanced cognitive skills which have complex behavioural needs which in my opinion cannot be met in captivity. While terrestrial environments are replicated at great cost for terrestrial predators in zoos, cetaceans have inferior enclosures and enrichment. The only thing that these enclosures have in common with their natural environment is that they are marine. Typically the enclosures are not structured, do not have different types of substratum, do not contain any other communities of animals like in the sea and are completely barren when it comes to sound apart from the continous sound of the pumps filtering the water. For an animal which is so dependent on it's acoustic abilities this is highly inadequate. There is a very good quote from Alexandra Morton, an orca specialist who worked with both wild and captive orcas which exemplifies exactly what I think:<br>  <br>  “Water itself began to sound different to me. In full flood Blackney Passage roared like an avalanche. Pebble beaches chattered, shrimp feeding on kelps crackled like frying bacon. Rock cod issued adorable, low serious grunts. Rain hissed, Herring burbled. Streams gurgled, I soon realised the vast amount of information a whale could pick up just by listening…with their exquisite sensitivity to sound, all that Orky and Corky could hear was the constant draining and recycling of their water."<br>  <br>  The main problems I see are the inadequate enclosures, inadequate social groups with mother-calf bonds not being respected resulting in premature seperation,unnatural aggression between animals due to inadequate social grouping, much reduced life span especially in orcas, inadequate space, inadequate enrichment, repetitive shows resulting in high levels of stress and aggression towards trainers, interbreeding of different eco-types, artificial insemination resulting in pregnancies (in a social species you do not know how this will affect a group), the propagation of false information about animals to visitors to make the park seem more positive, 'swim-with' programs which poses a risk (injury/disease) to both animals and tourists, lack of research carried out at parks.<br>  <br>  In regards to what fatefinger said,  unlike what some people think, this is not a sentiment restricted to a minority of extremists, it's in fact a very common sentiment within the scientific community and several countries have in fact completely banned cetacean captivity, unless you want imply that entire countries are 'peta terrorists', I think you will find this is an inaccurate assessment. There is an increasing trend away from cetacean captivity with increasing restrictions- and in fact lower attendance at marine parks.<br>  <br>  What was said about dolphins 'liking attention', they 'like' attention in captivity because there is precious little else to do and in the past, animals that did not get along were often kept together specifically for the purpose of making them seek attention from trainers rather than socially interacting...<br>  <br>  Concerning what Richard Long said; Claiming the animals have 'plenty of room' because the tanks are 'huge' is ill informed. They may seem huge to people but we are talking about large wide ranging animals that may travel over 100km on a single day....<br>  <br>  Concerning what Serena said, there are very few subjects we actually learned things on from captive animals; "communicate, travel, feed, socialize", these are all things impacted by captivity and if any information is gained, it will be inaccurate as often different eco-types are kept together. The only subjects that we could get some information on -and in actual fact  the only scientific papers I have seen by SeaWorld-is things like duration of pregnancy and nursing. And even nursing could be impacted by captivity.<br>  "They are happy and wellfed", wellfed is a nobrainer, but how do you assess happy? I personally think a high frequency of attacks on trainers by Kasatka and Orkid in specific is hardly an indication of great happiness.... and no, these are not 'isolated incidences' or 'accidents', unless both Kasatka and Orkid are especially 'accident prone, they have both been involved in multiple incidents with trainers...'Love' and 'best care possible' is just not enough, the last 10 orcas that died at SeaWorld were all under 22 years of age. The average age a female reaches in captivity is 40-50 and about 30 for males. IT doesn't seem like 'love' and 'the best possible care' are helping really....<br>  <br>  Education and conservation are often used to argue for marine parks but neither of these arguments holds in my opinion. Education is near enough non existent, in fact an independent researcher put it at the level of a good book aimed at third graders, and they also propagate false information (about ages for instance) leading to misinformation.<br>  <br>  If they were breeding for conservation, they would first of all breed endangered species. Neither the orca or the bottlenose dolphin, the two most common species kept in marine parks are globally endangered. Furthermore breeding for conservation is only ever effective if you intend to releasethe animals back into the wild at some point. SeaWorld has clearly stated they do not intend to do this. Furthermore they are interbreeding eco-types and subspecies which you should NEVER do if you intending to maintain the natural genetic variation found in different populations and they are furthermore maintaining these animals in enclosures that do not resemble the wild situation whatsoever which will no doubt impact survival skills should they be released.<br>  <br>  Well that is it in 'short' lol, i could go on and on about this!<br>  If you are interested in learning more I reccommend:<br>  Books:<br>  Alexandra Morton: Listening to whales what the orcas have taught us<br>  Ric O'Barry- Behind the dolphins smile<br>  Carol Howard- Dolphin Chronicles<br>  Toni Frohoff- Between Species<br>  One of the most comprehensive evaluation of what exactly is wrong with cetacean captivity:<br>  <a href="http://www.hsus.org/web-files/PDF/MarMamCptvtyBklt.pdf" rel="nofollow">http://www.hsus.org/web-files/PDF/MarMam...</a><br>  Some other web pages:<br>  <a href="http://www.wdcs.org/stop/captivity/index.php" rel="nofollow">http://www.wdcs.org/stop/captivity/index...</a><br>  <a href="http://www.orcanetwork.org/captivity/captivity.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.orcanetwork.org/captivity/cap...</a><br>  <a href="http://planktonforums.org/viewtopic.php?f=3&t=2733&st=0&sk=t&sd=a&hilit=captivity+articles" rel="nofollow">http://planktonforums.org/viewtopic.php?...</a><br>  <a href="http://planktonforums.org/viewtopic.php?f=7&t=4522&st=0&sk=t&sd=a&hilit=captivity+articles&start=10" rel="nofollow">http://planktonforums.org/viewtopic.php?...</a><br>  <br>  I am in two minds about keeping them for scientific research, bottlenose dolphins have been successfully captured and released again after participating in a research program, however it is undoubtedly stressfull to the animals and needs to be carefully weighed against how useful the scientifici findings that could be found would be.|`|rJ3Pb4Qbaa	Somewhat. I am on the fence about the whole captivity issue. We have learnt A LOT from having whales and dolphins in captivity - the parks are not just saying that. Back before killer whales were kept in captivity, in the early 1960s, they were treated as sharks are now. They would be shot at by fishermen whenever they appeared to come near their boats, and were shunned as violent animals. But when the public got to see these killer whales up close (in penned enclosures) alongside other humans, they were amazed. Now, we've learnt that whales and dolphins are INCREDIBLY smart, and we are still not sure of their vast capabilities. We have learnt about their breeding, childbirth, family life. Also, how they communicate, travel, feed, socialize, etc. <br>  <br>  But now, lots of parks have huge entertainment factors. Sea World, for instance, has their cetaceans (whales, dolphins) perform daily in shows. Some of the moves seem unnatural (where are you going to see a killer whale lift a trainer out of the air, in the wild?), but their moves are all based on natural behaviours. You learn about the ocean, and meet some awesome animals. Parks like Sea World are getting people up close to animals that are being threatened in the wild. <br>  <br>  Also, the specific park has a lot to do with it. Sea World, though they have their own faults, is very successful with how they treat their animals. They are happy, wellfed, and they have some of the biggest animal tanks in the world to swim in. Plus, their loving trainers are always keeping them happy and healthy. Miami SeaQuarium has one orca right now (and several dolphins) and they aren't so renowned for their history with animals. However, there is no denying that the trainers love the animals, and try to get them the best care possible.|`|RwRCwJXMaa	yes very much so I fell the same with circus animals that are kept in cages for their whole lives traveling the states for peoples amusement... if the circus comes to your town go strike in front of it thanks!|`|Qy9nZgBhaa	no, have you ever been to sea world.

J3TGyOnDaa	There is plenty more to be discovered on the moon. That's why the USA keeps sending satellites to it<br>  <br>  The space race with the USSR was won six times, world politics had changed (the Vietnam War was costing the USA a lot in money and politically), and there was a solar activity maximum in 1972. There were originally supposed to be 20 or 21 Apollo missions to the moon. There was a significant and dangerous solar flare in between Apollo 16 and 17. Some one on the History Channel said that it was serendipitous and completely coincidental that a solar flare did NOT occur when astronauts were on the surface of the moon. I think NASA decided that it just wasn't worth the possible risk to the astronauts lives to keep sending them up.|`|17d2136cb28b3dcd96bfa98507022f5eaa	Very simple: lack of money. Congress cut NASA's funding after the sixth lunar landing in 1972 because the public seemed to have lost interest in the Moon and the "space race" with the Soviet Union had been won. It was tragically bad timing, because Apollo 17 in 1972 was the _first_ Apollo voyage to have a trained scientist, Harrison Schmitt, on board, and was supposed to be the first of three scientific expeditions.<br>  <br>  More was learned about the Moon and its history in that voyage than in the previous 5 put together, and much more would have been learned if the two next voyages had been funded. Instead the US space program was redirected into the boondoggle of the shuttle and space station programs, neither of which has made much contribution to science.|`|2636a78d1ba5f08fe4ebe0aa2e504d3daa	I'm not sure that program cost is really the key factor. The total cost of the Apollo program (all missions) came to $135 billion in 2008 dollars. That's not a lot of money, all things considered, over a decade-long period, especially given what it achieved. I think it's more likely that a general waning interest in science in the public combined with the fact that the whole thing was more or less a pissing contest with the Russians was the reason we stopped going.<br>  <br>  I'm not sure we'd have to relearn the science. We'd have to rebuild the equipment, but our ability to do so now, when we can reliably send and remote-pilot robot equipment on Mars, is far in excess of what we managed to do in 1969 on the moon.|`|sJegUB11aa	Politics have changed from then.  I recall the time - candidates on both sides would say what they'd do for space exploration.  Now, candidates would be afraid to even bring up the topic.<br>  <br>  The other problem is the Moon itself.  It is not as dense as Earth, and therefore has less valuable metals.  It appears to have no use.  Mars isn't a whole lot better.  Some think there might be oil that's mine-able on Mars, but that's a long way to go to get some oil.<br>  <br>  The sad thing is that the exploration our solar system just doesn't look very profitable.  It would've been a lot different if there had been two habitable planets here, but there is just Earth.<br>  <br>  Perhaps someday we'll find something valuable in the asteroid belt.|`|2vRXS29iaa	The purpose it served had been accomplished. It was a political statement of American power. After Sputnik Americans felt seriously inadequate. Russians had accomplished something we could not. We had considered ourselves the worlds elite since our scientists had created the bomb. Actually European immigrant scientists had done most of the work, but we were good at ignoring facts. We were also very proud of our standard of living, so much better than the rest of those foreigners. Of course BEFORE the war many of those foreigners lived considerably better than we did, and their current impoverishment was due to wide scale bombing of their cities during WWII. But Americans firmly believed that GOD was AMERICAN.<br>  The moon program had a carefully painted facade of scientific respectability, but it was mainly to impress both friends and enemies of our might and resolve. We succeeded in our efforts, and continued flights were costing a great deal of money and had ceased to impress people. Politicians could care less about lunar geology. The moon was utterly useless: lifeless, deadly, and absurdly expensive to reach. So the flights ended. The immense infrastructure we had spent billions to construct was allowed to rust, and the pool of human talent was fired, forced to find useful employment. The political goals had been accomplished.|`|Fj1ojq3laa	The reason we stopped going to the moon is because there is nothing more to discover on the moon. We know that it was apart of earth billions of years ago when a mars type rock hit it and chipped off a piece and then was absorbed in the earth and still lies there today. the moon has the same soil as earth. We also stopped to save money, and study more on making a space craft that could go to mars. The next brand knew space craft is coming out in 2014, and its basically a pip type object that un attaches itself from different sectors of the object. Then when it lands on mars it will be the size of a hot tub or so. That's is why we stopped going to the moon|`|zf8BnU6Yaa	First you have to decide why go to the moon?  Part of the reason was to have a scientific justification for developing large rockets which also had military uses.  The USSR did the same thing.  It was part of the cold war package.  So there were some good scientific results but once having been there, it is then a economic argument on whether or not we have a reason for going to the moon or other planets.  At this point in time, if it were economic some large corporation would figure out how to make money out of going to the moon.  But there are enough smart people who are capable of doing it again if necessary.  It is not that hard with good engineering and remember the computer technology much less the materials etc. that have been developed since then is much advanced.  Not a problem at all to go back.|`|mH1Tnv5Naa	Basically it was due to finances.

M1D4iAuWaa	During the austral summer/autumn of 2001, habitat selection of Peale's dolphins (Lagenorhynchus australis) was assessed through a five-month land-based survey in two sectors on the central west coast of the Strait of Magellan, Punta Arenas, Chile. The main objective of this study was to evaluate habitat selection of Peale's dolphins in relation to kelp beds and the behavioural patterns determining dolphins habitat use. In 191 h of observation effort, habitat use of Peale's dolphins displayed a significant concentration in only a small part of the study area, which was strongly associated with kelp beds. Feeding was the most frequent behaviour observed, followed by traveling. The former behavioural state was observed principally inside and on the border of kelp beds, while traveling was observed mainly outside the beds. Peale's dolphins' preference for kelp beds, which seemed to be their primary feeding ground, was evident throughout this study. Kelp forests appear to be a fundamental habitat for Peale's dolphins in coastal ecosystems, and their protection might be crucial for the conservation of Peale's dolphin populations. <br>  <a href="http://www.ingentaconnect.com/content/eaam/am/2005/00000031/00000002/art00004;jsessionid=9h65wnmoxydb.alexandra?format=print&token=005d10693f582f206d3f6a4b4b6e6e42576b39272c5f7b3d6d383a4b3b257b552b465f737b4d2c3a4621a9b513d62" rel="nofollow">http://www.ingentaconnect.com/content/ea...</a>

rv2FJlIiaa	Organic foods are made according to certain production standards, meaning they are grown without the use of conventional pesticides and artificial fertilizers, free from contamination by human or industrial waste, and processed without irradiation or food additives.[1] If livestock are involved, they must be reared without the routine use of antibiotics and without the use of growth hormones, and generally fed a healthy diet. In most countries, organic produce may not be genetically modified.<br>  <br>  Organic food production is a heavily regulated industry, distinct from private gardening. Currently, the European Union, the United States, Canada, Japan and many other countries require producers to obtain special certification in order to market food as "organic" within their borders. Most certifications allow some chemicals and pesticides to be used, so consumers should be aware of the standards for qualifying as "organic" in their respective locales.<br>  <br>  Historically, organic farms have been relatively small family-run farms[2] — which is why organic food was once only available in small stores or farmers' markets. However, since the early 1990s organic food production has had growth rates of around 20% a year, far ahead of the rest of the food industry, in both developed and developing nations. As of April 2008, organic food accounts for 1-2% of food sales worldwide.|`|FadpfSoKaa	The word organic is improperly used, but with respect for food its food that does not use additives, preservatives, or used pesticides or hormones in its production.

5H7Wgaknaa	Eccentricites of various orbital curves are:<br>  0 = circle<br>  Greater than 0 but less than 1 = ellipse<br>  1 = parabola.<br>  Circles and ellipses are closed curves, in other words an object following one of these curves will return to its starting position. A parabola is an open curve. An object following a parabola will never return. An eccentricity of 1 is therefore the minimum requirement for an object on an escape trajectory.|`|KHSOVxViaa	OK, eccentric just means off-centre.<br>  <br>  If you're in a circular orbit round the earth and you get a great kick (in the direction of the orbit), you will now be going too fast to continue the same path.  It's similar to driving in a circle, when you accelerate.  Your path will not follow the same circle, but take a wider course (unless you turn the wheel harder).<br>  <br>  In an orbit, such a velocity increase means you will go into a wider orbit.  However, you still have to come back to the same place as orbits are repeating.  Hence your orbital trajectory will travel between a low point and a high point.<br>  <br>  This is an eccentric, or off-centre orbit.  The eccentricity can be measured and described mathematically.  A circular orbit is not off-centre, so its eccentricity 'e' is 0.<br>  <br>  If you get to escape velocity, the trajectory is a parabola - the orbit shape has reached the point of opening out so that there is no return path.  Anything travelling on this path has escaped.  At this point e is 1.<br>  <br>  In between a circle and parabola are ellipses.  These vary from being a little bit eccentric, when e is just above 0, to being extremely elongated, just below parabolic, so that e is just under 1.  Greater than 1 is called hyperbolic, and this would represent a very fast, almost flattened trajectory.<br>  <br>  OK, if you're read the above, you'll have the answer!|`|vSGQo6Pjaa	The eccentricity of an orbit is loosely based on the difference between the furthest an object gets from the center of mass of the pair to the closest it gets. So for a perfect circle the the two distances would be exactly the same and the eccentricity is 0.<br>  <br>  eccentricity = (far-close)/(far + close). <br>  <br>  So if two objects are still gravitationally bound, meaning that they have NOT reached escape velocity, you can see that the ratio here will always be less than 1. You can see that even if the "far" distance is very large compared to the "close" distance the numerator will still be a little smaller because of the minus sign and the ratio will be slightly less than 1. This is true for all gravitationally bound objects. <br>  <br>  In your case, one of the objects has reached escape velocity  which means that is it is no longer gravitationally bound. Therfore the eccentricity of the orbit would now be equal to one because the "far" distance is infinity.<br>  Hope that makes sense. This is a tricky subject.

When he heat-killed the smooth strains, then the mice lived.  But if he mixed the heat-killed smooth strain with the rough strain, then the mice died.  So genetic information was being transferred from the dead strain to the rough strain and turned them lethal as well.

You would connect the capacitor to it and slowly increase the voltage up to the max you want. A discharged capacitor is like a short circuit, so you want to increase the voltage slowly.<br>  Now, since you likely don't have a power supply, you have to find a source of voltage. There is a way to do a voltage multiplier where you would start from a 9 V battery, charge one capacitor, then connect that capacitor in series with the battery and charge another capacitor. It would now be charged with 18 V. You could repeat this procedure as many times as you want. You would then get 27 V, 36 V, etc.<br>  Not good for protection, but a nice experiment.|`|Gc82L3S4aa	You need an oscilater, a transformer, and a diod.
2636a78d1ba5f08fe4ebe0aa2e504d3daa	Since the sun doesn't have a rocky surface, it doesn't actually have a uniform rate of rotation - higher latitudes (parts near the pole) rotate at a slower rate than at the equator. The rate of rotation affects the generation of magnetic flux in the sun - and the differential rotation produces strange effects where the magnetic field gets looped up, resulting in solar flares and prominences. If the rotation of the sun increased, the probable effect would be an increase in the rate of these phenomena, resulting in more magnetic storms and particles ejected to Earth. The effect could be as little as more aurora-like phenomena in the atmosphere, or as much as a heavier solar wind stripping away our atmosphere entirely.|`|2vRXS29iaa	If the magnetic field of the Earth suddenly changed, and this DOES happen naturally every 250,000 years or so, the consequences would be fascinating. For life, we can see from the fossil record that the past field changes had no significant effect on living organisms. This is most curious because the field reversal ( North magnetic pole shifting to antarctica and the South magnetic pole shifting to the arctic region in the Northern Hemisphere) one might expect the field to go to zero strength for a century or so. This would let cosmic rays freely penetrate to the Earth's surface and cause mutations. This seems not to have had much effect in the past, so we probably don't really know what is going on during these field reversals. There have been a dozen of them over the last few million years, documented in the rock which has emerged and solidified along the mid-Atlantic Ridge where continental plates are slowly separating. These epochs form parallel bands all long the ridge where the rock has stored a fossilized image of the local orientation of the Earth's magnetic field for the last few million years.<br>  <br>  Magnetic field wandering would let the aurora borealis occur at any latitude, but other than that there would be no noticeable effects other than changes in the amount of cosmic rays that penetrate to the ground. Even this effect is minimal because we can visit the Arctic and Antarctic and only receive a slight increase in cosmic rays. So long as the strength of the field remains high during this field wandering event, the effects should be pretty benign.<br>  <br>  The Earth's magnetic field is believed to be generated by the rotation of the Earth's molten iron-nickel core. The period of field reversal is determined by the rotation rate of the core and its electrical conductivity. If you were to change either one of these, the field orientation, strength and '250,000 year cycle' would be increased or decreased. We also know from studies of the Sun's magnetic dynamo, that this phenomenon can change abruptly as it did during the 'Little Ice Age' on the Earth a few hundred years ago. There were no sunspots observed on the Sun for 50 years or so, then rather abruptly, the familiar 11-year cycle started-up over the course of a few decades. A similar 'chaotic' phenomenon may occur with the Earth 'suddenly' loosing its magnetic field for a few million years. Already, geophysicists have begun to notice a decline in the strength of the Earth's magnetic field, suggesting that the next field reversal epoch may be about to start. It may, however, take a long time to get here, and we don't really know if the decline is just a natural, ripple, or the portend of something far more sinister.

A new type of radiation that's safe for humans and it makes them mutate awesomely!<br>  <br>  You could also state how far it is from the earth and time, now what I'm about to tell you is fact!<br>  Imagine the earth, and then your planet 600million light years away. If it's 600million light years away, that means the light it produces would take 600million years to reach the earth whilst travelling at the speed of light.<br>  If it takes 600million years to reach the earth, then by the time we see the image, 600million years would have passed on the planet. So, we would be looking into the past, because it took 600million years to reach us, so by the time we see it, the time that it took to reach us would have passed.<br>  This means time is different where ever we are!

F9e0lY50aa	its your poop!|`|AA10744471	Stools are formed in the colon during the last phase of digestion. They are formed using water and waste particles. Stools are the means by which solid waste is eliminated from the body. A well formed stool is soft, flexible and easy to pass. It has good texture, volume and weight. <br>        A well formed stool measures about one and a half inches in diameter and about four to seven inches in length. Well formed stools make a clean exit from the body and hold their shape. <br>       The text below explains how the colon uses fiber and water to form stools, and how well formed stools promote regularity.<br>  <br>  What is a Stool Made From?<br>       Stools are formed from liquid waste matter called feces. Feces are comprised<br>  of tiny particles that are left over after <br>  the body has processed and absorbed nourishment from the foods we eat.<br>       Stools contain water, insoluble and soluble fibers, sloughed off epithelial cells, bacteria, by products of bacterial fermentation and decomposition (such as amino acids and fatty acids from protein), and any particles that the body cannot or<br>  will not absorb (such as excess calcium).      Feces also contain some inorganic <br>  salts called electrolytes, and several vitamins (some vitamin B and K) which are synthesized by bacterial action and then absorbed.<br>       In its final form, a stool also contains indole and skatole (responsible for the odor <br>  of stools), hydrogen sulfide (a gas), and urobilinogen-bulirubin which has been decomposed by bacteria into a brown pigment, the characteristic color of stools.

uGippMj9aa	I'm afraid it isn't really related to lifestlye or diet - its just your body going a bit bizarre. The body actually produces T-killer cells to fight off your body cells when they become infected/cancerous or even to destroy parasite cells. T-killers go around the body checking a special protein 'flag' that is posted on all your cells, telling the body what they are making and what they are. If your killer cell comes across a flag showing the cell is making something foreign, or saying that the cell shouldn't be there, it attacks and kills the cell. In mice (see the resource below) its been shown that special proteins that go around their body switch on or switch off the flags; if its foreign it switched it off and the immune system attacks and visa versa. There are lots and lots of autoimmune diseases (diseases where your immune system attacks the body - see second source), some can be treated and some can't. An example of treatment is immuosuppresive drugs which are quite dangerous, stopping your immune system and making you extremely vulnerable to illness (for example a simple virus like the common cold would have the potential to kill you). However, I'm not a doctor and there's just too many possibilities of the causes etc. I hope this helps.|`|b1ec839db1c1df60c33e8fd0fe8a46c6aa	There may be infection that triggers an immune response in you body.

axKQq9nXaa	Most of the time... no.<br>  <br>  Why?  For several reasons.  Mainly polar bears are extremely dangerous and they would have to drug the bear before they could move it to a different location.  Something that can cost a great deal of time and money... something that is not always there.  Plus with habitat shrinking where do they relocate the bear?  THey run into the risk of releasing it into a area with other bears or mothers with cubs that would be killed.<br>  <br>  But more than anything most people who deal with wildlife have a "hands off" approach.  We mess things up enough and sticking their hands into the pot be it for good or bad situations does not help.  I remember one nature video where a zebra foal got stuck in a mud hole during migration and could not get out.  Rather than put the camears down and help the foal out they left it alone and it died.  It might sound cruel but it is nature.  People also worry that if we constantly stick our hands in the pot that nature will begin to rely on man too much thus causing further problems.  For example a bear that gets fed by local people will keep returning to the area for food.  Sooner or later someone, be it the bear or person, will push the relationship a bit too far and get hurt if not killed.<br>  <br>  Like I said it might sound harsh but in most situations the choice is to let nature be nature.<br>  <br>  With polar bears if their numbers continue to drop they will probably look more into the relocation/release efforts... but for now it tends to be hands off.  Most of the catch/release programs with bears tend to be those that come into towns and cause dangerous situations with the locals.  The used to spray-paint a mark or number on the bear and if it kept coming back into the town after being relocated they shot and killed the bear.  Now they try to move the bear further away or move them to a zoo.  Might not be the best situation but it is better than a dead bear.|`|HJTs6qppaa	No. There is no need , a Polar Bear can swim for dozens of miles at a time.

YbVFL3SOaa	The question does not compute.  Blood does not flow from the small intestine to the stomach.  They have individual blood supplies on the arterial side and on the venous side they both drain via the portal venous system..  For example the celiac trunk supplies the left and right gastric arteries and the right and left  gastroepiploic arteries as well as the hepatic artery.  The superior mesenteric artery supplies the small intestine.  The superior mesenteric vein drains the small intestine and drains into the portal vein which also drains from the splenic vein.  The stomach drains via the  splenic vein, the superior mesenteric vein and into the portal vein.  The portal vein is how blood from the intestines gets to the liver for processing

If you have data based on the former definition, you should convert it to the latter by dividing by the number of cells in the field. <br>  The frequency of cell division is the inverse of the time T needed a cell to undergo one division cycle, and assuming all cells divide at the same rate, for a given population to. The mitosis phase of the cycle takes different times for different cells, so we use the variable t for that time (i.e., the time during which mitosis is observable). Let mu be the proportion of cells in mitosis at any moment. This of course is also the ratio of mitosis time t to cycle time T. Thus T = t/mu. Thus, if 1/50 of the cells are observed to be in mitosis and the mitosis phase takes 1/2 hr, T = 25 hr, and frequency = 0.04 cycle/hr. <br>  P.S. I added a ref. which clarifies the elements of the division cycle.
rbzoNe12aa	Wow, your question is all over the place. First off, perfection is subjective and full of opinion. What is your image of perfection? You mentioned the pain inherent in life; is feeling pain imperfect? If you're wondering if we will ever evolve as a species to no longer feel pain, I would say probably not. It is our bodies way of communicating that something is wrong. It helps us to stay away from things that can damage our bodies. Whether pain is a result of divine design or evolution is a totally separate issue.
FMM5qaW3aa	My school had a team go to Sierra Leone in Africa  and they tested the water, they almost all had bad things in it like ecoli bacteria. They all tested positive, except one and that source was so far away that it would take a bunch of engineers to fix the current water system in the town of Foria. Most water here is much cleaner naturally.(Mainly because we have sewers and don't wash in our rivers or go to the bathroom in our rivers.

5H7Wgaknaa	Nostradamus said nothing about 2012.

The Mayans never attached any predictions to this date.<br>  Native americans never made any predictions about 2012.

Every single one of them is unscientific nonsense.|`|BnR4LLhxaa	The worry about 2012 is complete and total hogwash. There is nothing about that year that is magically different than any other year.<br>  <br>  Keep in mind that there have been hundreds of predictions of the "end of the world" - but none of them have happened. <br>  <br>  The Mayan calendar ends in 2012, but that makes no statement, and implies no conclusion about what happens after that point -  it may be that they saw no reason in going any farther, or they knew that their calculation would get out of synch after some point. <br>  <br>  Sure, 2012 could be a year of great change, but so could any other year, and, in any case, no one can predict the future. I'd say that for native Americans, 1492 was probably an extremely important year (look at how they have fared since), but no one knew it at the time - and I guess no one predicted it either.<br>  <br>  It is very easy to look backwards and say that some event was predicted by someone's writing - but we are the interpreters of the meaning of that writing, and it is all too easy to ignore the predictions that did not come to pass, and only point out a few that we interpret now has having been true.|`|REdRmGnYaa	Plug in 2012 to the search for questions field, and you willget all the information you want and then some!|`|5gG42iOpaa	1)he did not,<br>  <br>  2)no, the mayan calendar ends on that date, the mayan's calendar worked with large cycles, one cycle ends on that date and if their culture were around today they would be making a new one.  they did not predict an "end" of the world<br>  <br>  3)Mayans are native american, and the tribes that I know of said nothing (I am Native American).<br>  <br>  - - - - - - - - <br>  <br>  many people in the past predicted the end of the world, such years as 1000, 1666, 2000, 2006 and houndreds in between were supposed to be the end of the world, but we are still here.

This is a unit circle, meaning its radius is 1, and the triangles we're using use the radius as the hypotenuse.<br>  Sine uses the y coordinate (think of a triangle of smaller angle: the opposite side would be represented by the distance from the x-axis, meaning the y value).<br>  <br>  So, back to the problem:<br>  y-coordinate is 1, so the Opp is 1 as well<br>  Hyp is 1, since its a unit circle<br>  sin(90)= 1/1 = 1<br>  <br>  Similar thing for the others:<br>  <br>  tan(360)<br>  There are 360 degrees in a circle, so that is the same as saying tan(0)<br>  Tangent is Opp/Adj, so we need both the x- and y- coordinates.  We already saw that the y-coordinate is used for the opposite side, but think back to the other triangle, and how the adjacent side would be the distance from the y-axis, meaning the x-coordinate.<br>  So for 0 degrees:<br>  x (adj): 1<br>  y (opp): 0<br>  tan = opp/adj<br>  tan(360) = 0/1 = 0<br>  <br>  And cot(-180):<br>  The negative 180 means that it goes the other direction tan how you normally measure the angle.  You can just do 360 - 180, which gives you 180 (this will be your angle).  Cotangent is adj/opp.  So similar to tangent, but the reciprocal.<br>  The coordinates for 180 degrees:<br>  x (adj) = -1<br>  y (opp) = 0<br>  adj/opp<br>  cot(-180) = -1/0, undefined.|`|fxL0DCYmaa	I dont rly know, but u could use an calculator to figure out the answer for sin(90),tan(360),cot(-180)|`|99OKc1lUaa	It's called the unit circle. Here is a link to it. You should become familiar with it. Also, know that coordinates are written (x, y). On the unit circle they are (cos(θ), sin(θ)). <br>  <a href="http://everobotics.org/projects/roboMagellan/img/UnitCircle.gif" rel="nofollow">http://everobotics.org/projects/roboMage...</a><br>  So if you want to find sin of 90, go to 90 and pick the second coordinate, since this is sin. Remember that tan= (sin/cos). So find each value at 360, then divide them. Also, cot=(cos/sin).<br>  Notice from the unit circle that we are traveling counterclockwise (this how the degree increases.) So if you have -180, you travel 180 degrees clockwise starting from 0. (You end up at 180.)
o04hl9ZFaa	Antigen presenting cells use molecules called MHC (Major Histocompatibility Complex) to present pieces of foreign molecules to our T-cells. These foreign pieces are examples of antigens. Once a T-cell is presented with antigen, it can coordinate a full-scale counterattack on the invaders (Adaptive Immunity).<br>  <br>  We must have a way to take invaders in our body, break them up, and show them to our immune system for the purpose of eradicating them. Think of it as cells calling the police =].<br>  <br>  This is just one dimension of the complex immune response that occurs in response to an invading pathogen.
axKQq9nXaa	Most places that have issues with West Nile will spray several times a year and keep a constant look out for problem areas such as pools of standing water.  There are also forms of natural pest control that can be used several times of the year.  For example there are species of fish that will feed off of mosquito larvae.  People can put those fish into small ponds to drop the numbers.  Depending on the sustaining life in that pond they might just have to put the fish in the pond once or every other year.<br>  <br>  The reasons that animals are vaccinated is that the virus can kill them.  No different than any human vaccine... just keeps us from getting something that can harm us.

The protection is simply putting mass between the astronaut and the source of radiation.  But putting up mass into space is extremly expensive so the astronauts accept a higher risk.

It was seen by a vet within a few minutes, and he said that it would be fine if it was rested for a few weeks, which the owner agreed to do with no problems.<br>  It's in the owners' best interests to take care of their stock, and most of them do look after their stock very well.

In the Hindu culture, the god Ganesha, an elephant with six arms, symbolizes wealth, prosperity and good fortune. Decorating and painting an elephant would represent an observance honoring Ganesh(a) in the hope of gaining these rewards. <a href="http://www.teachingk-8.com/archives/art_curriculum_that_works/the_art_of_animals_by_john_w_healy.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.teachingk-8.com/archives/art_...</a><br>  <br>  The paint is used from natural materials of the earth, such as vegetables, mustard oil, dirt, and non toxic powders, etc., that easily washes off with water without harm to the elephant's tough skin. People also paint themselves with this paint, it's not unlike makeup in this sense. <br>  <br>  The elephants have tough thick skin, and the piercings are no more harmful than they are on humans. But, most likely they are not piercings, but ornaments held on by a substance that is not harmful and not absorbed into the skin, or like necklaces and/or bracelets, beaded and draped over the animal or sewn into cloths which are then draped over the animal.

Then advil at 7...you get the idea.<br>  Just don't take them both at the same time.<br>  <br>  Also, stay hydrated! Having all those meds in you will cause back pains (kidneys) if you aren't drinking enough. Hot tea with lemon or honey will warm you up and help you relax while keeping you hydrated.

J3TGyOnDaa	You are in master's program, and you have not taken mineralogy or  petrology yet. I find that hard to believe. Mineralogy and petrology are usually lower undergraduate level required courses in the U.S.A for a bachelor's degree in geology. Sorry,  I just remembered that geophysics majors may not be required to take mineralogy or petrology. (Aurghh! Another middle age memory fart. lol!!)<br>  <br>  Whether or not a course is easy to pass depends entirely on the individual. If easy means little work, no course is easy if you are lazy  and have little or no curiosity or desire to learn. At Tulane University, mineralogy used to be the make or break course for geology majors, just like organic chemistry was for the pre-med students.<br>  <br>  Things have probably changed quite a bit since I got my bachelor's in geology in May, 1980. I didn't take a plate tectonics seminar until AFTER I got my master's degree in July, 2000.<br>  <br>  I've never taken a vulcanology course. All of the other courses you mentioned usually involve a significant amount of lab work. Field trips are always advantageous, but were not usually required. The only field trips I took was one for a sedimentology class (which was not technically required to graduate, because we had a choice of sedimentology + sedimentary petrology, or micro-paleontology) and another for a stratigraphy class. A geology field camp course was required to graduate with a bachelor's degree in geology. I'm still using many things I learned at field camp thirty years later.
