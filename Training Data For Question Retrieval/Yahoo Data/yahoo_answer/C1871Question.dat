20090307140102AAMNoCs	Computers & Internet;Software	Changing document creation/modified timestamps - Possible to tell this has been done?	Is it possible to tell if a document's creation/modified timestamps have been tampered with by changing computer date & time?      For example: I notice after the due date that I've made a mistake in a Word document project. I change my computer's date and time to reflect the original creation date, then copy and paste the corrected project into a new document and save. I then change the PC date/time again if necessary, to reflect original dates modified/accessed, and replace the original project file.      Can my computer professor tell that this has been done?      I know programs exist that can make these changes for you, but I'm wondering why they're necessary if you can do it manually. Therefore, I'm thinking there's probably something I'm missing. Help?

20090225054208AAalxeH	Computers & Internet;Hardware;Printers	One last printer question?	I have narrowed my choices down to the HP Photosmart C6380 and the Epson Stylus Photo RX680. I like the Photosmart because it prints up to higher resolution and the HP printer tray come in handy. The HP is currently 139.99 and Best Buy and the Epson is 85.00 refurbished from Epson. I like the epson because it can print on CD's and has Duplex printing. The draw backs to the Epson are: the ink is extremely expensive (unsure how well the knockoff ink is?), many reviews say that the paper trays are cheap. The HP is a lot more expensive but the ink is cheaper and you can buy a print pack from just about any store for $39.99. Which one is the best deal??

20090307110424AA1ENpG	Computers & Internet;Software	Fixing Sims 2 for MAC OSX 10.4.11?	Hey guys, I haven't played my Sims 2 game in a while and wanted to play it today.  When I clicked on it, I couldn't open it. So, by doing some research I found out that the new QuickTime 7.6 (which I installed at my last update) is what is causing the problem here.        By researching my problem on the internet I found that Aspyr released something that you can download to fix the problem. Found here:  http://support.aspyr.com/index.php?x=&mo...       However, if I do this, will it erase my Sims 2 files? I really really don't want to lose any of progress I have made in the game. By researching, I've found that I can backup my files...but I am not sure how to do that.  Do I need an outside source to put the back-ups on, like a flash drive? Is it as easy as drag and drop?       Also, I found that by installing the Aspyr solution caused some people's iTunes to mess up.  What do you think is the best way for me to prevent these two things from happening? THANK YOU so much!

20090307113742AAWtMWS	Computers & Internet;Software	I need help with my linksys router with my MacBook Pro! 10 points!?	Okay we have a linksys router and only a MacBook Pro for our home. The software for our linksys is for PC only so we can't setup a password on our router (I don't know of any anyway).      The problem is we just moved into a new apartment complex and someone is stealing our internet hard core. It looks like they're playing movies or games online because the send and receive lights are going crazy all the time.      My husband and I started shutting off both our router and our modem whenever we aren't using it to peeve them off and maybe make them get their own but it obviously didn't work because today when I turned on my modem and router "linksys" wouldn't show up in my airport dropdown menu. THEN I realized that there was one showing up but it was PASSWORD PROTECTED!      At first I thought "there is no way someone else put a password on my own router because it would have had to be reset when they did it but if they did it when it was on the last time then I turned it off and turned it back on it could have done it right? I checked the back of the router and the security light (little lock looking thing) was lit up!!!! I'm so mad that someone would do this! I had to reset the router 3 times before that light went off and GO FIGURE all the sudden linksys was showing up in my airport as no password protected anymore.      My first question is how would someone even do that?! Second, how can I put as much security on my linksys rounter/internet in general so that this can't happen again using my MAC. I have no access to a PC so a way to us my MAC to do this is my only option. I'm just at my wits end and ready to go banging on everyones doors to find this person! So any help would be greatly appreciated!      Also, I know there's a way to see if any other IP addresses are using my internet. But not sure what to look for. I go to my airport dropdown menu and hit "open network preferences", then under "airport" hit "advanced", then I go to TCP/IP and it shows me "IPv4 address" which is my address but I also see something under that that says "subnet mask" with some address in it then the Router address thing. Would any of these show me the other person's IP address or do I need to be looking somewhere different?      THANK YOU!

If I was getting FL Studio Express instead of Fruity Edition, how much would I be missing out on in practice? And how about the Producer's Edition? Because there's quite a range in price, and I probably won't use most of the features if I buy the most advanced version anyway.

20090227090014AAJCCfl	Computers & Internet;Hardware;Other - Hardware	How can i make my bedroom colder cause its way to hot in here?	i Have two windows  with two white blinds covering them to get rid of sunlight. my family doesn't own an actual air conditioner but we have a ventilation system, but when the air is turned on it doesn't    make my room very much cooler because my parents shut the cool air off after about 15 to 20 minutes.  i don't have a fan except for a ceiling fan.  Also i think another reason my room gets so hot is because of my computer.  When i use my computer i feel higher temperatures by it than i do anywhere else in the room.  I'm thinking its the power supply generating a lot of heat because ill run my hand across the top of the case and when i get to the back of it it's much hotter than the rest. Is there power supplies for computers that don't generate that kind of heat. Or could it be another one of my computers components?   If anyone thinks its one of my computers hardware components could you tell me where i could order the hardware at that doesn't generate heat but is also good and reliable?    thanks in advanced.

20090307162401AAxuHng	Computers & Internet;Other - Computers	How do I find and disable the hotkey that deletes entire paragraphs, while I type?	My keyboard is driving me insane.  I have one of the small Dell keyboards, which I don't recommend to anyone, but I can't afford another at the moment.   There is no space between the bottom keys and the edge, like on a normal keyboard, and sometimes my palm hits something and everything I've typed disappears.  This can be particularly infuriating on a long e-mail or something.      On either side of my space bar, there are alt and windows keys, which I assume I must touch with my palm, and then some letter I'm typing must delete everything.   At least I think that's what is happening.        How do I find out what is happening for sure, and/or disable the alt and windows keys?

20090307164046AAtaYiy	Computers & Internet;Programming & Design	Microsoft Excel VBA Loops????? helppppp plzzzzzzzzzzzzzz?	Hi, i have to create a lottery game in excel using vba.      i have 4 numbers going cross from C3 to F3      i have to make a button that when clicked, each number in the cells i listed above change randomly. This button i have to make using sequential VBA instructions. In other words, with no "for loop" structure.      The second button must have the same function, but this one has the "for loop" structure      The last button is the same but this one generates 4 random letters instead, in four different specific cells. This one also uses the "for loop" structure.      If anyone could jus explain what the "for loop" structure is, and how to use it, that would be great. Also, if you know what the sequential VBA instructions are for random numbers without the for loop structure, that would also be great.      Any Help is appreciated, thanks.

20090307170456AAQbGle	Computers & Internet;Programming & Design	C++ paragraph problem (reposted)?	Sorry to those that replied to my original question. Something happened. Anyway, here's the question again and more details.      Just for practice, I want to find out how to solve this problem:      Write a program that reads several lines from a data file and prints each word of the file on a separate line of an output file followed by the number of letters in the word. Also print a count of words in the file on the screen when done. Assume that words are separated by one or more blanks.      The above paragraph is the same one I will read from a file.       Here's what I have so far (needs a little tweaking). It gives me an infinite loop of Ws (the first letter in the paragraph).      //File: lab8b.cpp   /*Purpose: to read several lines from a data file   and print each word of the file on a separate line of    an output file followed by the number of letters in    that word. Also print a count of words in the file   on the screen when done.*/      #include   //keyboard I/O   #include   //for external file streams   #include   //getch()   #define in_file "data.txt"   using namespace std;      void main()   {    ifstream ins; //ins as input stream    char ch; //declare variable    ins.open(in_file); //open files       while (!ins.eof())    {     ins.get(ch);     while (ch!='\n')      {      while (ch!=' ')       cout << ch;      cout << endl;     }     ins.get(ch);    }       getch();   ins.close();   }

20090307164633AAzZKVv	Computers & Internet;Internet;YouTube	Why are YouTubers so stupid?	They never read the descriptions on videos, they spam anything that has the word "channel" in it, they use poor spelling and grammar, even the ones who claim to be intelligent, and they're always doing retarded stuff like sending people death threats even though they know it can get them in trouble.  They are also really easy to fool, and they can't see through the most blatant troll.  Since I moved over from YouTube to Yahoo I am refreshed to see that some people on the internet are actually smart enough to master a word that is more than two syllables in length.  What is it about YouTube that attracts so many morons?

20090307161236AAixeaY	Computers & Internet;Internet;Other - Internet	Excess internet usage with wireless broadband?	My son has recently moved to Gold Coast. We bought him a Toshiba laptop (Windows Vista firewall), with wireless broadband internet access. His monthly allowed usage is 3GB per month. Our monthly usage at home is 5GB per month and when he lived at home, we usually averaged about 3GB of usage per month for 4 people. Last month, he went well over the 3GB allowed usage and this month his ISP is saying he has used 2GB already (in 5 days!). 1GB downloads and 1GB uploads. He swears he uses the computer no more than he did at home; even less because he works full time now. Any suggestions why his ISP is saying his usage is so high? He says he pulls the USB for the internet out when not on the computer. Could someone be hacking in? Windows Vista to blame?

Is it possible to some how save the files by taking the hard drive/C drive out of old PC and putting it into a new one/internal hard drive? would a Computer shop do this and would they charge the earth? Or… are the files simply affected and gone ?      I know if I could help recover the files it would make my bf really happy!!!      Any info ?

20090307164839AAaVGer	Computers & Internet;Other - Computers	Why is my supposedly "Excellent Strength/58 mbps speed" wireless connection slow?	I supposedly have an "Excellent Strength" connection, that says it's speed is 58 mbps, yet it is SLOW. This other connection that I connect to most of the time is sorta fast, yet it says it has a "Poor Connection" and it's speed is about 5.5-12 mbps". And, it's FASTER than my connection. I have a D-Link Wireless N USB Adapter DWA-130.  In case this helps, the channel thingy (for my connection) is 1, and the connection that says it's slow, but it's pretty fast is channel is 8.      Does anyone understand why this is happening, and how I can fix it? Please, and thanks.      PS. Oh and if you need to know more information on the connection or whatever, just ask it in your answer, and i'll edit this.

20090307170617AA3VyfT	Computers & Internet;Software	What is causing my slow hard drive?	I am struggling with a very slow hard drive on an otherwise exceptional desktop computer.  It's quite bizarre because anything I do on the internet is fast, whereas doing anything on my actual computer is very slow (opening files, using Windows Explorer, control panel... anything! -- so getting data from across the world is faster than getting data from under my desk!).        If I disable my AntiVirus program (Symantec AntiVirus Corporate), then the speed gets better (see below)... not sure how to resolve because I don't want to run without AntiVirus!         Details:   1.  I have run diagnostics on the hard drive using both Windows Vista and Western Digital LifeGuard Diagnostics; no bad sectors or errors.     2.  DiskBench shows a transfer rate of between 15-25 MB/s for copying files (but occasionally as high as 118 if you keep trying), 145-160 MB/s for creating files, and 1-115 MB/s (huge range I know!!) for reading files.  The rate for copying files rockets up to about 330-360 MB/s when I disable the AntiVirus (no change for creating files; reading files changes to about 80-110 MB/s).   3.  I seem to have enough RAM - I'm never using more than about 70% of it   4.  Results do not change when I close background programs, except for my AntiVirus.   5.  I have already run CCleaner (registry cleaner), removed unnecessary programs, and defragmented the drive   6.  My system is an Intel Core 2 Quad, 2.40GHz with 2 GB of RAM, a Western Digital ATA 500GB hard drive, and an ATI Raden HD 3800 video card.  I'm running Vista 32-bit Home Premium.           Any and all help is appreciated!!

I hooked it up to my old PC which runs on XP and the device worked perfectly without any wait/extra downloads needed. Im thinking this is a problem with the operating system, but if anyone knows what the problem is or can point my way to a certain driver I need to download It would be greatly appreciated. The mouse is generic with no brand or website listed anywhere. Guess you get what you pay for huh?

20090307173332AAJGEL6	Computers & Internet;Internet;Other - Internet	Can you guys please help me?? I'm having an 'identity crisis' involving online usernames. PLEASE READ!?	Hi Guys, I usually go by 'DawnWolf' online, but recently I realize that name doesn't fit me. How about helping me find a new one? All you really have to do is paste 2-3 words together, try combinations of these words:      Wolf -- Spirit -- Autumn -- Archer -- Otter -- Art -- Deer -- Dawn -- North -- Bear -- Russet -- Leaf -- Cedar -- Winter -- Arrow --       Do you catch my drift? Those are the kinds of things that represent me. Those northern- woodsy- words... especially Wolves...      So could you guys take some time to smash a few combinations of words like that to help me create a username for myself?j      :3 Please and thank you. Many points rewarded for everyone!

20090307173551AAKLzwh	Computers & Internet;Software	Switch from XP to Vista help?	I recently got a new Vista in place of my XP and I moved every last file from the old comp to the new 1. But none of my games    (Battlefield 1942 and all expansions, Star Wars Battlefront II, and Ghost Recon Island Thunder and Desert Siege)   that I had downloaded and worked perfectly with the xp worked. The game will start up, but it will only load the menu. As soon as I click the button to load up a battle or anything (for example, I cant load Galactic Conquest mode or Campaign in Star Wars Battlefront 2, and I cant start a new game, either) Can somebody help me fix my programs? by the way, these are torrent programs, not CD-ROMs thanx.
