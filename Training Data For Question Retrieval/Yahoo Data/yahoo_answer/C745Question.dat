20090203073917AAUyPrn	Food & Drink;Vegetarian & Vegan	Vegetarian and Vegans, why did you give up meat? Are you Christian too?	This question is going to take a rather dark twist near the end. (I am athiest, more-less an Ex-Christian)      For the past few days I have been looking amongst the Vegan Vegetarian section because my new diet consists of not eating meat for the majority of the day (I can eat seafood whenever, but for red meat, I can only eat it within a 4 hour time frame)      I want to know why you gave up eating meat... For the Technical, healthy aspect, or for the moral aspect.      Did you do it for YOUR health, or for the life of another animal?      And are you a Christian? Or Believe in God (Jahova) and what if you learned that God is more evil than man in the ways of animals. Why? Because God likes the smell of burning animal flesh, That is the reason people made sacrifices in the "olden days".      In Genesis 8:20-21, after surviving the flood, Noah built an altar and "took of every clean animal and of every clean bird, and offered burnt offerings on the altar. And when the Lord smelled the pleasing odor, the Lord said in his heart, "I will never again curse the ground because of man".          Personally, I'm completely for someone giving up meat for their health. I'm not going to give it up  because I like it and I think it's natural for us to eat meat. As for the moral stand point. Animals eat animals, always have, always will. Even whales eat meat. You think we torture them? There are ants that have slaves. Cats and killer whales kill and play with animals and then leave them to rot without a second thought about eating them. To torture an animal and to eat an animal are two completely different things. To eat an animal is natural, to torture one is an instinct, a bad instinct, to release stress. Usually if you are insecure about something. Or as a cruel method of entertainment (Cat plays with mouse, mouse dies and doesn't get eaten. - We just do it more creatively because we have a more advanced brain and simple things don't please us anymore.)       (sorry, got off topic) Why did you give it up (and defend your stand point if it was for morals. Personally I love animals, but I wouldn't deny my instinct to eat them. Duh, I'm not going to eat an animal I've owned, or one that I knew. That's just as bad as someone asking you to cry over their child's death. You don't know their kid, you'll feel sorry, but there is no attachment so you can't cry for it.)

20090203073634AA5nWh9	Food & Drink;Vegetarian & Vegan	Vegan with a hairloss problem?	I've been vegan for little over a month now and have experienced a loss of about 6-7 pounds, which I know is drastic in a month. I weigh 109 and am about 5'4''. Additionally, my hair seems to be be falling out more than it typically would. I have just observed this during showers and when I brush my hair.      I have been on birth control for a couple of years (which can be a cause for hairloss), but it has never affected me before. It would only make sense that my new diet is the cause.      I have been trying to take in protein through veggie burgers, vegetables, and etc. I also add nutritional yeast to my food at least every other day for vitamin b-12.      I suppose I don't have as structured of a diet as I thought. Are there any ideas about what could be the issue, or even help in making sure I have a vitamin/ nutrient filled diet?

Hi, I've seen many questions regarding sprouted sunflower seeds for birds, but i'm asking for my human self. :)      I soaked, then sprouted some raw, unsalted sunflower seeds. They've been going for 3 days. Except for some brown spots on their little buds, they're lovely & seem eager to grow.       When I eat them, I feel a stinging/burning feeling in the back of my throat. It seems this is not a good sign...

Hey everybody,           I'm from Charlotte, NC and I'm wanting to know where I can get the good ingredients in order to make Chicago-Style hot dogs.  Mostly, I'm wanting to know if I can find sport peppers anywhere in the area and if so, where I can find them and how much I should expect to pay for them.  I've heard some people say that sport peppers are very much like Banana Peppers, but on the other hand, some people say that they're like Serrano peppers also.  However, one of the biggest things to look out for is the spiciness of peppers, which I don't want to make the mistake of using peppers that are so spicy that they take away from the overall flavor of the hot dog.  I have also had a real hard time find poppy-seed rolls around here as well.  If anyone can give me any pointers about where to go around Charlotte to get the sports and poppy-seed rolls, I would greatly appreciate it.  Thanks!!
