I am assuming you already have a court date.  What do you do when you get to court?  Look at your paperwork and see what time you have to show up at and which room (in court parlance, rooms are called departments).  Try to show up at the court about half an hour early so that you can go through metal detector and find the department where your hearing will be held.  Once the court session starts, a clerk will take roll to see who's present and you will either hear an explanation of what will happen at the beginning of the session or the judge will explain the details when your case is called.

The Croatian war of Independence and The Kossovo war. Also Israel and Lebanon was as well.|`|c34895fb3078ed6b839d8ec9443a9ab2aa	Normally I don't use this term, but your arrogance (and apparent lack of knowledge of WW2 and US History obliges me to)<br>  You're absolutely wrong, the UK declared war on Finland 6 December 1941, and ran several bombing runs against Hango and Tampere.  The US NEVER declared war on Finland despite Soviet AND British pressure to do so.<br>  The CSA WAS a democracy, your revisionist simplifications to the contrary, the voter enfranchisement was the same as for the North.  Also they had an elected Congress.<br>  The Thirteen Colonies were by any estimation-except yours apparently indeed a democracy, with enfranchisement and elected representatives in the Continental Congress.  The Articles of Confederation demonstrate this clearly.<br>  EDIT:  For your information in Britain, the United States and Canada women, and non-whites, (and non-land owners in the UK) were prevented from voting. Are we to infer by your statements that these countries were not democracies?  As with France, Italy, Australia, New Zealand and other countries in the mid 19th Century.  As for not being recognized, you are again mistaken.  The US itself gave de facto recognition to the CSA by instituting a blockade.  Such an act of war was instituted against enemy nations-not insurrections. In fact Britain, herself gave de facto recognition by admitting CSA gov't representatives to meet with members of the Cabinet and Parliament; they also pointed to the blockade as justification.<br>  EDIT II:  Sorry to be long-winded, but I just wanted to make sure I get the point across I am NOT a lost-cause Civil War historian.|`|44AkhdRnaa	UK vs Finland.<br>  <br>  Edit - they did the UK declared war on Soumi-Finland!<br>  <br>  5 December 1941.

D. Hanson: "[D]emocratic practices abroad meant nothing at home when it was a question of Athenian self-interest -- the Assembly might ...readily fight to exterminate democracies like Syracuse (415-413).... Athenians ... fought for two years against [Syracuse,] the only other large democracy in the Greek World."<br>  Punic Wars, 2nd and 3rd Centuries BCE <br>  Democracies: Rome vs. Carthage. <br>  Rebuttal, Counter-rebuttal: Same as for the Greek democracies.<br>  American Revolution, 1775-1783 <br>  Democracies: United States vs. Great Britain <br>  Rebuttal: On the one hand, Great Britain was more liberal than most monarchies and it had a reasonably independent parliament, but on the the other hand, the franchise was quite restricted until the Reform Bill of 1832. Also, the United States was run by a provisional coalition during the war, and the country did not become a working democracy until after independence. <br>  Counter-rebuttal: One of the most frequently stated goals of the American rebels was that they were entitled to enjoy all the civil rights quaranteed to native-born Englishmen (e.g. parliamentary representation, due process of law), but denied to the colonists. This certainly sounds like the Americans themselves recognized England as a model for their own democratic hopes.<br>  American Indian Wars, 1776-1890 <br>  Democracies: United States vs. various Native American Indian tribes. <br>  Rebuttal: The tribes did not have enough formal structure to be considered real democracies. <br>  Counter-rebuttal: Well, just for starters, the Iroqouian Confederation was rather complex.<br>  French Revolutionary Wars, 1793-1799 <br>  Democracies: France vs. Great Britain, Switzerland, the Netherlands<br>  Rebuttal: For Britain, see the comments for 1775. Also, France at this time was lurching left and right, with bloody purges each time, so it hardly qualifies as a stable democracy. <br>  Counter-rebuttal: Under the Directory, 1795-99, France was a relatively stable republic.<br>  Franco-American Naval War, 1797-1799 <br>  Democracies: United States vs. France <br>  Rebuttal: It was a Quasi War, for God's sake; even historians call it that. It was little more than a trade war with sporadic ritualized broadsides. <br>  Counter-rebuttal: According to official Navy statistics (<a href="http://www.history.navy.mil/faqs/faq56-1.htm)," rel="nofollow">http://www.history.navy.mil/faqs/faq56-1...</a> the US lost 20 sailors and marines in the Quasi War. Relative to the numbers involved, it was bloodier than the Gulf War.<br>  Anglo-American War, 1812-1815 <br>  Democracies: United States vs. Great Britain <br>  Rebuttal: For Britain, use the same two hands as with the 1st Anglo-American War of 1775.<br>  Franco-Roman War, 1849 <br>  Democracies: France vs. the Roman Republic. <br>  Rebuttal: Both democratic regimes were less than a year old, and therefore don't count as stable democracies. <br>  Counter-rebuttal: C'mon, that's just cheating. You're redefining your terms in order to exclude an awkward exception.<br>  American Civil War, 1861-65 <br>  Democracies: United States vs. Confederate States <br>  Rebuttal: The Confederacy was a slave-holding nation and therefore definitely not a democracy -- and while we're at it, the same could be said for the Union as well. Also, "[t]he South was not a sovereign democracy at that time... President Jefferson Davis was not elected, but appointed by representatives selected by confederate states. There was an election in 1861, but it was not competitive." [Rummel] <br>  Counterrebuttal: Both nations used almost identical Constitutions, which were easily the most democratic in the world at the time. Both nations conducted state and congressional elections on schedule, despite the difficulties of wartime. They both allowed substantial dissent within their Congresses, even if the opposition in the South never quite formalized into a two party sytem. Every major policy decision in both nations was enacted and approved by elected officials. (And since when is being "appointed by representatives selected by [individual] states" undemocratic? Technically, that's how every American president has been chosen.)<br>  Occupation of Veracruz, 1861-62 <br>  Democracies: Great Britain vs. Mexico <br>  Rebuttal: Yes, democratic Britain assisted France and Spain in seizing Veracruz from democratic Mexico (Juarez had been properly elected.), but this was achieved without fighting. As soon as their French allies geared up for military conquest of the whole country, the British pulled out. <br>  Counterrebuttal: An invasion is war, even if the defenders don't fight back.<br>  Spanish-American War, 1898 <br>  Democracies: United States vs. Spain <br>  Rebuttal: In Spain, "the two major political parties alternated in power, not by election but by arrangement preceding elections." [Rummel] <br>  Counterrebuttal: It's hardly unknown for rival parties in a democracy to make a time-sharing agreement or grand coalition. In one form or another, it has happened in Austria (1955-66), Columbia (1958-74), Switzerland (from 1959), UK (1931-45). More importantly, when Spain lost the war, prime minister Sagasta resigned, and national leadership passed to his parliamentary opponents, exactly the same as we would expect in any other constitutional monarchy.<br>  Anglo-Boer War, 1899-1901 <br>  Democracies: Great Britain vs. Transvaal and the Orange Free State <br>  Rebuttal: The franchise in the Boer Republics was limited to the white male elite.<br>  First World War, 1914-18 <br>  Democracies: France, Belgium, Great Britain, the USA, et. al. vs. Germany. <br>  Rebuttal: Well, yes, the Imperial Reichtag was democratically elected by universal manhood suffrage, but it was a largely powerless body, like the UN. The real power in the German federation was in the hands of the Emperor who appointed the Chancellor and commanded the Army, and in the hands of the Junkers running the undemocratic parliament of the Kingdom of Prussia, which made up around half the federation. <br>  Counterrebuttal: Sure, there were aristocratic privileges and traditions that were inconsistent with one-man-one-vote and full equality under the law, but Germany was every bit as democratic as the United Kingdom (cf. the House of Lords and English dominance over the indigenous peoples of Scotland, Ireland and Wales.) And the Reichtag controlled the budget, which is not exactly "powerless".<br>  Occupation of the Ruhr, 1923 <br>  Democracies: France vs. Germany. <br>  Rebuttal: Germany didn't fight back. <br>  Counterrebuttal: The same counterrebuttal as with the 1861 occupation of Veracruz.<br>  Second World War, 1940-45 <br>  Democracies: Great Britain, United States, et al. vs. Finland. <br>  Rebuttal: Finland fought on the same side as the Nazis against the Soviet Union, not against the democratic Allies. <br>  Counterrebuttal: Well, the British bombed Finland; that sounds like being at war. And 69 Finnish merchants ships were sunk outside of the Baltic Sea. [n.9] Also, every Finnish soldier fighting the USSR meant that one German soldier could be sent west to fight the Allies. Every Russian soldier killed by the Finns weakened the Allied war effort.<br>  First Indo-Pak War, 1947-49 <br>  Democracies: India vs. Pakistan. <br>  Rebuttal: These regimes hadn't been around long enough to qualify as a stable democracies.<br>  Iran, Guatemala and Chile, 1953, 1954 and 1973 respectively. <br>  Democracies: United-States-backed coups in Iran, Guatemala and Chile. <br>  Rebuttals: It's not certain how deeply the CIA was involved in overthrowing these democratically elected governments, but even if it was in up to its neck, these were coups and not wars. Covert operations by shadowy, bureaucratic elites are not democratic. They are not publicly debated and approved beforehand by the citizenry. <br>  Counter-rebuttal: Technically, every military operation in the modern world is enacted by secretive bureacracies without public debate. (Was D-Day put to a vote?) If using the CIA is undemocratic, then so is using the Army; and if using the Army is undemocratic, then democracies can't fight wars, period. QED.<br>  Lebanese Civil War, 1978, 1982 <br>  Democracies: Israel vs. Lebanon. <br>  Rebuttal: Lebanon hardly counts as a stable democracy.<br>  Croatian War of Independence, 1991-92 <br>  Democracies: Croatia vs. Yugoslavia. <br>  Rebuttal: These regimes hadn't been around long enough to qualify as a stable democracies. <br>  Counter-rebuttal: Even so, both nations had government that had been put in place through free elections. Even Weart admits that. <br>  Border War, 1995 <br>  Democracies: Ecuador vs. Peru. <br>  Rebuttal: President Fujimori of Peru had suspended the constitution in 1992, making himself a virtual dictator. <br>  Counter-rebuttal: Just as virtual reality isn't reality, so a virtual dictator isn't a dictator. It is usually considered legal for a democratic leader to exercise emergency powers in an emergency, isn't it? Also, when Fujimori lost parliamentary support in 2000, he quit/was fired. Isn't the peaceful surrender of power one of the major tests of true democracy? [see also the 1898 Spanish-American War and the 1999 Kosovo War for similar applications of this test.]<br>  Kosovo War, 1999 <br>  Democracies: The countries of NATO vs. Yugoslavia. <br>  Rebuttal: Milosovic was a dictator. <br>  Counter-rebuttal: In the legislative elections of Nov. 1996, Milosovic's supporters won a mere 64 out of 138 seats in parliament, and control of government probably would have gone to the opposition had not infighting and internal divisions prevented them from claiming their place at the helm. In 1997, Milosovic was re-elected president by a plausible margin of 59% to 38% [n.1] which suggests that these elections were not ent|`|Cn1tSHLpaa	Yes, the Confederate States of America fought the United States of America in the Civil War, for one example.

JDAbWnJraa	Sounds to me like maybe you are mind f'ing yourself. Understand what I mean? Little example from Ranger School...  RI's took us on a pretty good run in the dark to where you really couldn't tell where the heck you were, or how far you had gone. As we started to approach the barracks, the cadence changed to "going home, going home, good run!!!" stuff like that. So you were all jacked up that you had survived this hell run and then they ran right past the barracks and some guys dropped from the ranks. Did they drop because their bodies gave out on them physically? Nope, the human body is capable of more than that run. The mind f'ed themselves and lost it when that wasn't the end of the run.<br>  <br>  Don't focus on your phobia when you run, focus on your breathing. Deep in through your nose and a good push out through your mouth, to expel the CO2, and control your rate of breathing. To work on building endurance while picking up speed, while doing the airborne shuffle down the road, pick a telephone pole to start sprinting at and slow back down at the next pole. regain control of your breathing while continuing to shuffle and when ya got it under control again, sprint again. That will help you out a lot brother.<br>  <br>  Of course, this is all in the event that there is nothing medically wrong with you.|`|n2oEhdZiaa	I had a similar problem but nowhere near that severe...

AA11632370	The name of Pakistan Border Defense Force is Pakistan Rangers (PR). The Pakistan Rangers are a paramilitary force under the control of the Ministry of Interior government of Pakistan. There are two parts of Pakistan rangers. In 1995 Pakistan Rangers divided into two parts, one is called Pakistan Rangers Punjab with its headquarter in Lahore and other is Pakistan Rangers Sind, headquarter in Karachi. Both the Rangers have their different uniform and command. History: After the establishment of Pakistan in 1947, the protection of its eastern boundaries was allotted to particular regions, such as the Punjab Border Police Force, Bahawalpur State Police, Khairpur State Police and Sindh Rifles. Because the Rangers were neither correctly structured nor outfitted for a specific duty, in 1958 they were restructured and renamed as the West Pakistan Rangers. After the 1971 war, this force was federalised underneath the Ministry of Defence as the Pakistan Rangers and shortly in 1974, it was made a component of the Civil Armed Forces (CAF) under the Ministry of Interior. Pakistan Rangers are fulltime defenders of Pakistan because they guard the borders during peace and war. Headquartered in Lahore, the Rangers are also very active in securing important monuments and guarding national assets in that city. The Rangers have notably contributed towards maintaining law and order in Karachi in crisis situations, and were also employed extensively for the Lal Masjid Operation. The rangers also have an elite unit of ranger commandos known as "red commandos".|`|MfZU1UpFaa	it may be Peshmerga

Usually questions of fact are not disturbed, if they think there is a questioni of fact issue they will remand the case back to the lower court to resolve.<br>  <br>  Appellate courts usually decide if a law was applied correctly and so fort.

It is all decided using the record from the previous proceeding.|`|7uznrLBXaa	Appellate courts do not have juries; juries are only for the trial level court.  Why?

I would just say you are going on vacation, or visiting a friend you went to school with.

Just bring enough spending money. If you have a place to stay $1000 is more than enough for a week, unless you will be staying in hotels or shopping a lot and eating out in expensive restaurants.<br>  <br>  I made the mistake years ago by mentioning I was visiting a boyfriend and was questioned for almost 20 minutes because they thought I might try to stay in the country illegally or even get married.

Truly this would be a bad and ridiculous thing to do on the governments part.  Because every citizen who owns a gun in this country will not give up their guns for anyone.  Even if military force was enacted.  You'd still have barbaric people fighting the military as M1 Abrams tanks ruled in.  The die hard Second Amendment with holders might never retreat or give up.  Not even when the magnitude is far greater then what they can challenge.  For liberty if your a true patriot and Stand up for your freedoms, you will do anything you can at any cost of freedom. Life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness are in check here.  But Constitutional rights can be misunderstood and therefore wrongly enforced.  It would definitely be very interesting because I'd never allow my guns to be confiscated by military personnel in the name of domestic threats on terror.  They'd cause more terror trying to take the guns away from armed citizens then what so called terrors would be used in other ways.  Many not used for any type of threats at all.  The clear lining between guns and who uses them is a lining tainted because of criminal mischief.  Thanks to that, I'd still put up a fight.  Utilizing sniper tactics, one shot one kill.

Because of this, we are experiencing fly-tipping (the indiscriminate dumping of rubbish) and a huge rise in the rat population, which is why the law was introduced in the first place.<br>  <br>  We have people who have been convicted of terrorist/hate crimes who have been released because the European Court of Human Rights says we can't keep them in prison.  We also can't deport them because our Human Rights legislation says we can't, just because their own countries may not treat them as well as we do.  In the meantime, they live on our very generous benefits system.<br>  <br>  We religiously conform to all the diktats of the EU, while other EU countries continually flout the rules and laugh at us for our conformity, which costs us billions each year.  We cannot compete with the price of goods from other parts of the EU where the rules are seen as just advice, not anything to be adhered to or enforced, and so we are flooded with cheaper foreign products. An example: our next-door farmer neighbour has sold up because he was getting 17p a litre for milk, which was costing him 20p a litre to produce.  The low price is due to cheap milk being imported from Poland, where no-one bothers at all about checking health/safety regulations or the welfare rules.  Only the UK does that.<br>  <br>  Even our light-bulbs are regulated; we now have to buy low-energy bulbs, even though they may not be suitable for certain situations.  For example, they dont work in outside lights in cold weather.  We live in the countryside, where it is very dark; a visitor fell down our steps when leaving the house recently, and I fell down after them.  This was only due to the fact that we have low-energy bulbs fitted in our lights outside our entrance door and they are simply inadequate.<br>  <br>  I agree with the sentiment expressed in my newspaper recently; "Will the last person to leave the UK please switch off the (low-energy) lights?"|`|wz9szz3Gaa	Yes and there health care sucks and every third world countries flee there to get a piece of the hand-out.

Bush wasn't factually correct with the American people in his justification for a war, thought nothing of eroding the bill of rights, and gave the haves tax breaks while our national infrastructure decayed.<br>  <br>  It's possible that he was simply woefully under qualified for his job and made honest mistakes, though it does seem improbable doesn't it?<br>  <br>  And either way, I'd rather have a slimy president that did the right things for the wrong reasons than a stupid president that did the wrong things for the right reasons.  Which is why the Clinton years were more successful than the Bush years.<br>  <br>  Anyways, I can't think of a major ethical violation by Obama, so he gets the edge by a rather wide margin.

Soon, water access ceased in poor neighborhoods.<br>  <br>  HELLO!!!!!<br>  <br>  Do you really support that despotic level of 'free markets?'  The reason fascists hate communists is because fascists are the boot of the man.  And the man likes his boot on our neck.

It appears they are an organization to educate on healthy food standards.  <br>  <br>  Now is there a conspiracy to poison the food supply?  I would say most likely yes.  who is behind it?  Well there are elements in the Russian and Chinese Governments who would like to poison Americans and other pro Western countries.  Remember the Pet food that was poisoned that came from China.  I think this was a test to see if we would catch on.  We did and that forced China to act.  They executed the supposed person responsible for pet food quality in short order.<br>  <br>  Russians also have a history of using Poison.  Remember a couple of years ago the Russian dissident who was poisoned with a highly toxic radioactive element.  Alexander L. something was his name.<br>  <br>  Yes we do need to stay alert, just today the Chinese were flexing their muscles in the open seas with one of our monitoring ships.  And N. Korea is threatening War over our joint military exercises with S. Korea.  Something we have been doing for 50 years.<br>  <br>  Sounds like to me this is all ramping up for that test of the new President that Joe Biden promised would happen in the first 6 Months of Obama's presidency.

yQ0OzEbZaa	Hitler held many hysterical beliefs which not only include, God and Providence but also Fate, Social Darwinism, and ideological politics. In Adolf Hitler's Mein Kampf, he spoke, unashamedly, about God, fanaticism, idealism, dogma, and the power of propaganda. Hitler held strong faith in all his convictions. He justified his fight for the German people and against Jews by using Godly and Biblical reasoning. <br>  <br>  This is a quote that I think is one of his most revealing statements that makes this quite clear:<br>  <br>  "Hence today I believe that I am acting in accordance with the will of the Almighty Creator: by defending myself against the Jew, I am fighting for the work of the Lord."<br>  <br>  o_O
rUNlmQG5aa	Because the Bible, a 2,000 year old, superstitious text that has fathers killing sons, brothers, brothers, and is saturated with buggery, bloodshed and Mayhem is the guiding instrument of the 21st century in this country.|`|3UTlASavaa	I see that you are jumping right on this 18 month old story of a study done by a Reproductive Rights organization (perhaps they were trying to show the statistics in a slanted light?).  It is interesting that when you comapre the abortion statistics in comparison to the fertility rates you see that Uganda's abortion rate as a percentage of the fertility rate is actually lower than either America's or Western Europe's.  Western Europe's rate looks so low because they are actually not replacing their population (fertility rates well below that needed to maintain their population totals).<br>  <br>  If you are willing to be hoodwinked by such incredibly slanted statistics without being critical of them you are not really qualified to use the statistics in your argument.|`|0eFSeap5aa	You forgot to mention western Europe's declining birth rate.  Not only are they dealing with pregnancy problems, they are dealing with over-population.<br>  <br>  Look at the same thing in this country.  Jimmy Carter, Bill Clinton, and Barack Obama collectively have fewer children than Sarah Palin.  You can see who is contributing to rising global populations and who is limiting their reproduction.<br>  <br>  Of course in 20 years, Palin's kids will have one more vote than her less fecund political opponents.

Nobody has ever died from using marijuana.<br>  <br>  Look, I think 99% of gun owners are responsible - they are trained in gun use & safety, they keep their guns out of kids' reach, and they train their children to properly handle and - more importantly - RESPECT guns.<br>  <br>  However, there is just no way to prevent stupid (not to mention drunk, violent, unstable, etc.) people from getting guns.

That child has a right to an education funded by the taxpayer. Exactly how that is applied and administered is up to individual states. <br>  <br>  The answer is yes.<br>  <br>  EDIT-The assistant principal is not a lawyer. Talk to one of those instead. That kid should be allowed to attend another school...depending on what he was expelled for...or be educated by a tutor at taxpayer expense.

I've never done it myself, but when I was in HS and also college, I had some friends who did it regularly, and the stuff they grew was quite effective. It's called "weed" because it is just that -- a weed.

And making your own booze is WAY easier than growing strong chronic pot. If you think it is just throw them in the ground and wait, then your crazy. (ground? who uses the ground anymore?

awzXuJMDaa	Maybe you should do a 'little' research before you speak. <br>  <br>  Since Australia banned private ownership of most guns in 1996, crime has risen dramatically on that continent, prompting critics of U.S. gun control efforts to issue new warnings of what life in America could be like if Congress ever bans firearms. <br>  After Australian lawmakers passed widespread gun bans, owners were forced to surrender about 650,000 weapons, which were later slated for destruction, according to statistics from the Australian Sporting Shooters Association. <br>  <br>  The bans were not limited to so-called "assault" weapons or military-type firearms, but also to .22 rifles and shotguns. The effort cost the Australian government about $500 million, said association representative Keith Tidswell. <br>  <br>  Though lawmakers responsible for passing the ban promised a safer country, the nation's crime statistics tell a different story: <br>  <br>  <br>  Countrywide, homicides are up 3.2 percent; <br>  <br>  Assaults are up 8.6 percent; <br>  <br>  Amazingly, armed robberies have climbed nearly 45 percent; <br>  <br>  In the Australian state of Victoria, gun homicides have climbed 300 percent; <br>  <br>  In the 25 years before the gun bans, crime in Australia had been dropping steadily; <br>  <br>  There has been a reported "dramatic increase" in home burglaries and assaults on the elderly. <br>  <br>  At the time of the ban, which followed an April 29, 1996 shooting at a Port Arthur tourist spot by lone gunman Martin Bryant, the continent had an annual murder-by-firearm rate of about 1.8 per 100,000 persons, "a safe society by any standards," said Tidswell. But such low rates of crime and rare shootings did not deter then-Prime Minister John Howard from calling for and supporting the weapons ban. <br>  Since the ban has been in effect, membership in the Australian Sporting Shooters Association has climbed to about 112,000 -- a 200 percent increase. <br>  <br>  Australian press accounts report that the half a million-plus figure of weapons turned in to authorities so far only represents a tiny fraction of the guns believed to be in the country. <br>  <br>  According to one report, in March 1997 the number of privately-held firearms in Australia numbered around 10 million. "In the State of Queensland," for example, the report said only "80,000 guns have been seized out of a total of approximately 3 million, a tiny fraction." <br>  <br>  And, said the report, 15 percent of the more than half a million guns collected came from licensed gun dealers. <br>  <br>  Moreover, a black market allegedly has developed in the country. The report said about 1 million Chinese-made semi-automatics, "one type of gun specifically targeted by the new law," have been imported and sold throughout the country. <br>  <br>  Larry Pratt, executive director of Gun Owners of America, said the situation in Australia reminds him of Great Britain, where English lawmakers have passed similar restrictive gun control laws. <br>  <br>  "In fact, when you brought up the subject of this interview, I didn't hear you clearly -- I thought you were talking about England, not Australia," Pratt told WorldNetDaily. "It's hard to tell the difference between them." <br>  <br>  Pratt said officials in both countries can "no longer control what the criminals do," because an armed society used to serve as a check on the power and influence of the criminal element. <br>  <br>  Worse, Pratt said he was "offended by people who say, basically, that I don't have a right to defend myself or my family." Specifically, during debates with gun control advocates like members of Handgun Control, Inc. or similar organizations, Pratt said he routinely asks them if they're "against self defense." <br>  <br>  Most often, he said, "they don't say anything -- they just don't answer me. But occasionally I'll get one of them to admit it and say 'yes.'" <br>  <br>  Pratt said, based on the examples of democracies that have enacted near-total bans on private firearm ownership, that the same thing could happen to Americans. His organization routinely researches and reports incidents that happen all over the country when private armed citizens successfully defend themselves against armed robbers or intruders, but "liberals completely ignore this reality."<br>  <br>  Ya gotta wonder who the idiots are that give thumbs down to facts that go against what they would like to believe is true.|`|G1fDp1PEaa	It is simple. "Law-Abiding" citizens can snap too. In the United States, law-abiding citizens can own guns. Therefore people die.<br>  <br>  It is no coincidence that countries with gun control have lower crime rates.|`|6KaMW1Vzaa	Actually, there isn't a direct correlation at all. Some countries with the strictest gun laws have very low crime rates; others high ones. Some countries with less restrictions on guns have high crime rates; others low ones. <br>  The local traditions in both crime and gun use seem larger determinants, and they're not at all closely related.|`|4d5247fbc8be95ded60ba90440fe55ecaa	LOL! It is funny that you are asking about guns, because this is a loaded question! <br>  <br>  But the facts don't lie. Nations with strict gun controls have less gun crime. I think the answer to your question is pretty obvious.<br>  <br>  p.s. Senator Cadaver, there is a HUGE difference between "crime rates" and "violent crime rates." Look at the stats for homicides, and those European countries don't even come close to the U.S. Hmm...<br>  <br>  I know I, for one, would rather be "burgled" than shot to death any day of the week. And that same WorldNetDaily internet magazine that everyone is quoting to prove that there is more crime in Australia also has an article about how the NRA misinterprets the statistics to suit their political agenda. Double hmm....|`|BQ4M9ODnaa	FALSE<br>  <br>  World Top 10 - Countries With Highest Reported Crime Rates <br>  <br>      * Country<br>      * Iceland<br>      * Sweden<br>      * New Zealand<br>      * Grenada<br>      * Norway<br>      * England & Wales<br>      * Denmark<br>      * Finland<br>      * Scotland<br>      * Canada|`|9HdexsSCaa	Your premise is wrong. Some countries with draconian gun laws have lower crime rates and some have higher crime rates than the US. The crime rates in Great Britain have gone through the roof ever since they banned most types of firearms, for example.|`|0n7IvR5Naa	England's crime rates are higher than the U.S.'s, though its murder rates aren't.<br>  <br>  U.S. crime numbers, particularly the murder rate, are greatly skewed by gang activity. Factor that out and they become quite low.

mwEBrwlOaa	I am not understanding your question 100%. I am basing my reply on what I understand that you are asking. What I understand is that you do not have custody of your child that you had with your ex and you want to know what you can do to prevent April from being around your child? If that is the case then there is a big piece of information missing from your posting and that piece is why would a judge give a child less than 1 years old to the father? Unless there is a major problem with the mother judges almost always give children under the age of 5 to the mother. The only times a father will be awarded custody of a young child that I am aware of is when the mother it has psychological issues, drug issues, or the inability to provide a suitable home. Given the fact there is some major reason as to why the judge gave custody to your ex will influence what you could do to stop April from being around your child. My advice would be to follow the court's instructions and build a better home. Then worry about April and your child being around her.|`|7YTiooX5aa	Well really there isn't much you can do unless you can prove that she is unfit to be around your son, your ex has rights and unfortunately if there is nothing wrong with his wife as far as drug abuse, her being abusive.Things like that. A court won't grant you what you want if you can not prove to them that she is unfit to be around your son. I know this because my husbands ex tried the same thing just because she was angry with him for leaving her and because she couldn't prove that I was a bad person she was not granted what she wanted. Now if you are being threatened by this person then you can get a restraining order for the both of you but again you will have to prove it. Hope this has helped even if it isn't what you wanted to hear.|`|HbraP1cpaa	I HIGHLY doubt your in a position to raise a child either...do you have a job?? your own place?? This isnt even your child, you have no rights over that child. If you truly believe that child is being neglected, call CPS, do the right thing.

fKFvzlzQaa	Yes.<br>  <br>  Gang members are dangerous Felons.<br>  <br>  As Felons they do not have the right to own firearms.|`|8MUj24s6aa	Yes....Because I highly doubt gang members meet the needed requirements in legally purchasing and owning any firearms.<br>  <br>  You must be 18 years (for long guns) 21 (handguns). Must not be a felon or have certain misdemeanor convictions. Also...if they plan on using a firearm to commit a crime....that is not doing anyone any good.<br>  <br>  There is a different for a legal and law abiding citizen buying a gun for sport, hobby, hunting, recreation, or protection and a gang-banger buying one. <br>  <br>  Also, a gun is an inanimate object. It can't commit a crime. Only the person operating it.<br>  Also a "round" cannot be automatic. Fully automatic guns are extremely hard to acquire and require a BATF Tax Stamp of $200 and a clean criminal history. Any gun shoots one bullet after another. <br>  <br>  Automatic - bullets are fired from a gun with one pull and hold of the trigger until the trigger is released or the clip is empty.<br>  <br>  Semi-auto - One bullet is fired from the gun per trigger pull.<br>  <br>  There are semi-auto uzis and AK-47s<br>  <br>  Please watch this video as someone demos what these "military style weapons" can do compared to ordinary everyday hunting weapons.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vgr3kTU68uw&feature=channel_page" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vgr3kTU68...</a>|`|IsGo50kqaa	Most are big on following the law and not so absolute to believe known gang members should have carte blanche.

So I am guessing from your retort, that you think it is okay for gangs to have weapons that don't fill your definition of the word 'powerful'. Your original question was ludicrous and I was merely trying to point that out by being sarcastic. By singling out gang members in your question, can one assume that you think it is okay for non-gang members to have these weapons? I am not sure why you ask a question that has an  obvious answer? <br>  <br>  Do you think it is okay for children play with powerful poisons?<br>  See? stupid question...sorry if i stole your next 'thought provoking' question for YA.<br>  <br>  I believe you would be referred to as a troll.|`|xUMbS7KCaa	Yes I do. Anyone who breaks the law shouldn't  be allowed to own a gun<br>  From- for drug dealers, sex offenders, domestic abusers, felons, and gang members my feelings are the same <br>  <br>  90% of  Voters Support Requiring Background Checks for All Gun Sales.<br>  Common sense gun laws such as background checks for private gun sales and requiring gun owners to report lost or stolen guns to law enforcement should be a part<br>  <br>   These measure would require greater gun owner responsibility <br>  <br>  There is nothing wrong with laws for greater responsibility. We have many of them including on pet ownership<br>  <br>  I don't find it a hard question at all.  It's not being hypocritical neither- It's called common sense and responsibility-We don't let a 2 year drive a car do we? A five year old to buy liquor? A  repeated sex offender to work in day-cares<br>  The mentality of most gangs is violence why allow them to possess weapons if we know that- and they are known gang affiliated

DDbWKBKjaa	The spousal entitlement you describe isn't actually achieved through contesting the will.  It's an election available under the Provincial Family Law Act.  (Might depend on the Province, but this is how it works in Ontario.)<br>  <br>  In effect, if the spouse receives too little under the will, he or she is entitled to treat the death as a separation, and take whatever share of the estate he or she would have been entitled to upon breakdown of the marriage.  This election effectively writes the spouse out of the will, forfeiting whatever bequests were made, moving those into the residue of the estate.<br>  <br>  There are other Family Law entitlements for some dependants, as well, but outside of that there is no real entitlement to be left property under a will.  That said, if there's somebody who we would expect to receive under the will, and who doesn't, and it seems likely that the testator just plum forgot...this can undermine the will in certain ways.  (Hence why, if you disown a child, you should leave him a peppercorn.  It proves that you've put your mind to his entitlements.)<br>  <br>  Beyond that, the usual reasons to contest a will would be such things as capacity and undue inluence.  It's not about receiving a substantive entitlement under the will, but rather about concerns that the testator's actual settled intentions are reflected in the will.

Most conservatives I know realize this crisis has been decades in the making and that it has evolved through a series of policy mistakes beginning in the Clinton administration.

The B1/B2 would be his class of admission.
DTSUJe2oaa	Soma ( carisoprodol HCL ) has a first pass metabolitewhich is meprobamate (a barbituric acid like substance). This can trigger a positive EMIT screening test (urine) but will likely not be confirmed on a follow up GC-MS testing unless they are looking specifically for its presence. Soma is not a scheduled federal controlled substance but can cause dependance end impairment. So to make it more clear No! somas will not show up on a drug test unless specifically tested for it. That would cost extra unless they did a 14 panel test to really break it down. ~

yQ0OzEbZaa	Thats a good one. I feel this woman should first be married and financially stable before bringing a child into the world or even a whole litter of kids.  She’s still jobless and husband-less with 14 kids. On welfare. Splurging on video games. Moving out of a home owned by her mom, who’s $20,000 behind on mortgage payments.<br>  <br>  Now Octo-mommy is moving in to a half-million-dollar southern California home arranged for by dad and reportedly paid for with the cash she’s been raking in from her Octo-mom notoriety. <br>  <br>  I know I’m not the only one with the sick feeling that taxpayers will be on the hook for this financial basket case sooner rather than later.  o_O<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.tmz.com/2009/03/09/octomom-new-house/" rel="nofollow">http://www.tmz.com/2009/03/09/octomom-ne...</a>|`|wR1XyyrUaa	I don't think that the military has the right to force her children into the military.

9tcv3TiWaa	If you live on base, the only difference in your pay will be your getting BAS (eating allowance) of around $310 per month to pay for your food.  And if you married with 0 or married with 1 then you will not pay as much in taxes.  You still must pay phone, internet and cable.  In some areas where the housing is PPV then can be charged for electricity.  If you go over the average you must pay out of pocket. <br>  <br>  If you live off base, then you will get BAH w/dependents and that is to pay for your housing and utilities.  You can be under that amount and then again you might have to pay some out of pocket.  you will get the BAS and pay less in taxes.  <br>  <br>  E3 pay depends on how many years in.|`|AA11540967	You will have an extra 200 per month after taxes.|`|GLyty11oaa	Depends on your BAH rates. Check with finance they can tell you in about 3 seconds. On post It will be your base pay plus BAS. At least that's the way it works in the Army.

But firstly, do you have no morality about selling yourself in a marriage contract?  Even if there is no physical contact, in marriage you make a promise to be with that person until you die.  Divorce aside, this is a promise.  Can you make it that lightly?<br>  <br>  I have to believe you could marry someone of despicable character in this way.  It would be an easy way for a terrorist to enter the country.  <br>  <br>  Hopefully your layoff is a temporary situation.

Not everyone coming to the US is coming here for opportunity or the American dream. Many are coming to destroy them.

You will lose your right to vote and own a gun and you will be charged a fine of up to $5,000.

There are conservative libertarians and independents.

8dc5NMexaa	The law, its procedures, court dates, witnesses, opposing aggressive counsel, ripping attorney's fees, and issues that suffer from overbreadth such as "just and right" and "best interests," restraining orders, discovery, etc. do not correspond very well with the 6 stages of healing, but they do suspend healing.  Unfortunately but realistically, most citizens think that the attorneys who can get the most from the other side and limit severely their opposition are the best attorneys; however sometimes and often-so, there is a family unit, and that type of attorney is more like a "butcher" to a family tree.  Attorneys in family law attend state and local seminars where the dais is full of speakers who have "won" major cases, and they, as speakers, have no humility, and brag.  The attendees grow up in the law thinking that they must do the same.  There is no art of family law that is prevailing that is holistic to the parties or to the family unit.  Too much of family law is the presentation in the public forum of a court of the most negative caricature of the opposing party that can be presented; and that somehow is argued to provide "justice."  Instead of the parties grieving their individual losses of a dead marriage or of dead dreams and funeralizing those, they shoot at each other with exaggerated fault, and so many times beyond exaggeration into heartless fabrication.  Much goes down the river of divorce proceedings and through the large and non-constrictive bridge of the courts, and all parties have to bathe emotionally from the process for many months thereafter; hopefully while in counseling.|`|011830a2652ee7687c383f5f54db2d13aa	Every situation is unique.

t5ZWJIvlaa	hmmmm i think having a phone isnt priority on their list... usually work, missions, tours of duty, little bit of faith, coming home at night to eat dinner, and trying to make laughs with friends are.<br>  <br>  there are some things people in the military are taught, and that might make them change. they are taught to be obedient because it will save their lives. and they are taught to hold back emotion because when you are in war, focusing on how much you miss your family wont save your life but focusing on your rifle or grenade will probably get your butt safe back to your station where you can then let out a few emotions if you need to. people in the military do tend to change because they learn a lot of respect and they are not just serving for the country, they become part of a brotherhood. sisterhood also. <br>  <br>  they may change here at home even without being sent over sea because they are trained that way. just like training with live rounds instead of blanks. they have to trust and believe, if they screw up, they are able to be killed. so they must be trained and obedient over here that there is a time for work and a time for play and a time for tears if they need to be shed. because you cant predict what will happen over sea...     they are trained to survive.|`|YRtnn6GSaa	Its different for every person. Allot of times they may be busy to where they cant make a phone call. or by time they need to do what they got to do they cant make one. maybe after work they don't feel like talking. Its hard for me to talk about my day to my family because they don't understand and i don't feel spending hours explaining stuff. Allot of times civilians just don't understand and it would be better they don't. Also realize that if you are just a friend think of what one of there friends would do for them. Would you cover his back and make sure he doesn't have to take a round would u take a round for him. would u save his life. would u even get your but chewed out for him.

Secondly Thanks to all of you who are asking Questions I finally found something to do on the computer that I like.

My husband's friend just got back from USMC BCT a few months ago and my husband says he WAY more strict and rigid now, and now so goofy.<br>  <br>  I hope that doesn't happen to my husband, since he leaves in a few months.<br>  <br>  But anyways, I think it's dependent on both the person, the branch, and their actual job.|`|Ar00Kkgkaa	Go back and take some basic English classes.|`|7XAXcEBhaa	Well in basic training, don't be expecting to talk on the phone for more than 20 minutes total during your whole training!

You may think that you are so righteous that embryos can not be used but you apparently never spoke out about those unused embryos being trashed all these years.  No one buried them, no one did religious ceremonies over those embryos in Bush's years so where was his ethics and where was yours?|`|J3TGyOnDaa	Obama's compass is in the Constitution and the separation of powers, something which Cheney and his puppet W ignored with impunity.

k2Jbp9e6aa	Given your criteria, I'd have to say a 50-50 split.  Either way it boils down to "Hurrah for our side," be it a High School game or a National Election. <br>  It is inconceivable that any course of action would benefit everybody. One votes for the course of action that would benefit oneself personally. Thus, it is short cut from democracy to hegemony.<br>   When Winston Churchill said that democracy was the worst form of government except for all the others, I'm sure that he envisioned no bayonet being held against any ones throat.  But there are measures available to a democratically elected government that are just as lethal to a person's life as a bayonet.<br>  Until November, 2008,  these thoughts were just an academician's fancies.

AA11467290	This is exactly why we are losing the Republic and why we are being ruled by an olygarchy of liars.  The rule of law is what gave us the American Dream - because everyone had a chance to advance who followed a certain sets of rules.<br>  <br>  Now, if you are honest - you are a looser.  If you can lye and cheat, you advance.  There are no reprocations if you get caught breaking the law - just look at all the scammers and fraudsters on Wall Street - they stole billions of dollars and all they got is a slap on the wrist - or a big bonus for being the best scammers in the industry.<br>  <br>  The honest man is going to work, paying his taxes, paying his mortgage and does not need anything from the government.  The dishonest ones - will get government handouts paid by the honest man's taxes.<br>  <br>  The politicians do not work for us because we have lost a representative republic ruled by law.  They smell our weakness and will do whatever they want to - be it Constitutionally legal or not.  They will side with their friends and enablers who are allowed to steal from the taxpayers and fill they campaign contribution coffers.  If a law stands in they way, they will pass executive orders to trample the Constitution in the name of "security" or some other "public good".  Many times, they will either directly create a problem, or let a problem be created - with the hope of pushing through some agenda that benefits them and their friends in the olygarchy.<br>  <br>  So, ask yourself, if we the people no longer control our government, then WHO is it that controls our government.  Who sets the policies that are implemented IN OUR NAME domestically and abroad?  Does the CFR (Council on Foreign Relations) have more voice then the people as far as setting the country's agenda?  Does the IMF have more control of how OUR money gets spent?  How many generations must we obligate in the debtor's prison to pay down the Trillions of dollars the country owes?  And all because of lying, fraud, and lack of punishment for the lawbreakers.  Where the hell is our Department of Justice?  Is it even OURs?  Or is it also bought up?  <br>  <br>  So, will we go quietly into the night and let this "more perfect union" disintegrate right before our eyes?  Will we let the rule of law - The Constitution - become irrelevant?  Obviously, we've been letting it happen for some years now.  What's the solution?  Join the club of the liars and the thieves so that you will advance?  Ignore everything and take solace in "ignorance being a bliss"? Or something else?|`|gvfFLFS0aa	It takes a special kind of person to be a politician.  Generally, that kind of special means being two-faced and willing to obscure facts in order to please those around you.  Honesty makes you unpopular in politics.  It's the nature of it.

I am one of those.<br>  <br>  I used to shoot coke and heroin and meth. I smoked weed for decades. I quit on my own a few years back, not because any government entity made me, but because I simply wanted to.<br>  The whole time I was using I held a job, and as an adult, owned a condo and later two & a house and later 3, and paid all my bills on time. I never stole or whored, or any of the stuff you allude to above.<br>  <br>  The reason your scheme won't work is quite simple: It's a government scheme and everything government touches turns to feces.<br>  <br>  The only answer is to legalize all drugs; not just marijuana, cocaine, heroin, but also all drugs one now is required to get a permission for from a licensed physician.<br>  <br>  Either we're free or enslaved.

It's totally pointless.|`|knOdcrDkaa	What in Sam Hill are you talking about?|`|igwzwx13aa	Don't shave your head?|`|LcAiHBsaaa	I wanted to take just your first sentence, but it was one big run-on.<br>  <br>  Anyhow, I wanted to point out in Exhibit A, the first word in your rant... <br>  <br>  ONE.  <br>  <br>  That's exactly how many people are tired of hearing... blah blah blah blah blahhhhhh.  It's just you. <br>  <br>  Just how "proud" of your race are you that someone would label you a skinhead? <br>  <br>  EXHIBIT A:<br>  "One gets a bit tired of hearing how various ethnic groups have contributed to our society, not that they haven't, mind you, but that they have contributed to our society in spite of the white backlash which in fact created the very society in which they forcibly inserted themselves, for better or worse,regardless of blood soaked emergency rooms, and the shear cost of a Police presence during their, moronic, Macho-behavior fests of "respect"-which is obviously at the point of a fools gun and bears the meaning of virtually all that is moronic and meaningless yet borderline religious in the intensity of - I don't get this crap and I really don't want it in my country, period, end of story."|`|XqUvTCqJaa	I agree with both sides of the argument....yes as whites we are labeled racist if we even ask why can't we have some of the things minorities get, and it doesn't make much sense either way. Would Dr King want a Black History Month that causes even more controversy and isn't really even looked at by a lot? No I don't think so, from his teachings and speeches, he would  rather have had an American History Month, each day or week dedicating itself to the major points in our History that included all that the African Americans fought for. He didn't want to be further segregated by having such things, he wanted us to come together as brothers in a united country. We all are citizens of the United States, we all have our ancestors and history, and we all should be proud to be Americans more than what skin color we are.|`|bDpVRFRJaa	In my opinion,  it is possible. Just see how those white-skinned people treated black-skinned people before. Well, I guess this situation still continues in this society.

It is just so wrong if you feel superior to others just because your race.|`|TA1zYlYraa	We are all a mixture to varying degrees, so there are no pure races. Being proud of your race is daft: you had no control over your origin, and it is not possible to divide people into races other than saying we are all the human race.<br>  <br>  Political systems that have tried to govern along racial lines (eg Nazi Germany and apartheid South Africa) have been forced to define 'race' along totally arbitrary lines.|`|5WqBGmRVaa	Green Pagan 4.0 makes a good point.<br>  <br>  It’s time to get beyond ‘race’ regardless what ‘race’ you happen to belong to.|`|VS0PuI5paa	As long as you don't admit to anyone that almost every advancement beyond the stone age was invented by those racist white blue-eyed devils, you can be proud as you want.|`|E9XL5x3Paa	You could avoid shaving your head...then you'll only be known as a racist, and not a skinhead.|`|3DOQG6hEaa	Hahaha, okay, just to clarify a few things: The largest minority in America, African-Americans did not forcibly insert themselves into America.. you may remember that whole "slave trade" thing brought them here... Mexican-Americans didn't "force themselves" here either... the Southwest was Mexico until we illegally annexed it in the Mexican-American war (a war we started on some extremely dubious grounds) The rest of your rant confirms that you are not just proud of your race and white and totally not a skinhead, but that you are in fact, racist... a huge generalization about a scene of violence (apparently) and machisimo, followed by your assertion that you don't want minorities in "your" country... oh no, not racist at all.

CZlUhRfkaa	This is what I found on Wikipedia...<br>  <br>  Many people are not known by their first forename. This is often referred to as "being known by the middle name". In this case, wherever an additional initial is called for, the initial of the first name is used and the middle name is spelled fully. Examples of this form include G. Gordon Liddy and E. Howard Hunt. Some people don't even include the initial, such as Paul McCartney, whose first name is actually James, Sean Connery, whose first name is actually Thomas, and Trent Reznor, whose first name is actually Michael.<br>  <br>  Here is the link to the full document.  There is other information on there.<br>  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Middle_name" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Middle_name</a><br>  <br>  It seems to me the best way to go for official documents is first initial and full middle and last names, like someone else mentioned.  There will be no charge to change your name and no hassle.  Your first name will probably be used at some times in your life but you will mostly be known by your middle name.|`|PcP6fLixaa	It all depends on what you mean by "use my middle name". Like do you just want everyone to call you that. Do you want it on official documents.. or what?<br>  <br>  My father goes by his middle name, but on credit cards and contracts he signs his first middle and last name. <br>  <br>  People will call you whatever you tell them. So you can use your middle name for everything as far as that's concerned. <br>  <br>  For the legal documents. I'm pretty sure if you don't get it changed you at least have to put your first initial. But still, people would still call you your middle name then. <br>  <br>  If it really does mean that much to you, i would just get it legally changed. It honestly isn't that hard and it explains how to do it on the back of your birth certificate. <br>  <br>  good luck = )|`|FUL3Ez2Iaa	My husband has for thirty six years.

cMHxg372aa	Well, their simplistic herd mentality, bigotry, and religious brainwashing aside, because they believe a grossly distorted version of history. They actually think that the US - the first country to build a transcontinental railroad system, among many other projects - was some laissez-faire utopia when we developed. It's a laughably false notion - in truth, for most of our history, we had protectionist trade barriers, a federal government active in infrastructure investment, tight restrictions on credit and debt, and we paved the way in free public education.<br>  <br>  Moreover, even if the manufactured alternate reality of Fux News history were accurate, and a not-existent laissez-faire paradise is what made America great in the 19th and 20th centuries, that would not mean it is necessarily well-suited to today's world.

That means most people believe in the conservative philosophy. The conservatives in Congress and the president failed to uphold the ideas of their conservative base; small government, low government spending, etc. thus, they were rightfully and soundly thrown out as they should have been. Liberals tell republicans they need to be more moderate and work with them. That has been the problem. So called republicans have tried to become moderate and forgot what it meant to be conservative and it cost them the election.<br>  The ideology did not fail them. They failed the ideology.

a095159fe0597a1cbcdff915d247b333aa	I just saw the movie today.  Loved it.<br>  <br>  I'm afraid you're going to have to forgive me here.  I'm not sure how old you are.<br>  <br>  The Watchman was written in the 1980s, in the height of the US-USSR cold war.  Growing up in the 80's, the fear of nuclear war was always hanging over our heads.  I remember doing safety drills in school, where we would be under our desks, covering our heads, in case of attack.  Like that would have done -anything- to protect us!  But you get the idea.<br>  <br>  So, thankfully the creators of the movie did not try to modernize the story, using the current terrorism threat.  The political message in the movie, and the graphic novel, was very much indicitive of cold war thinking.<br>  <br>  That being, humanity is inherently savage.  We need an "us verses them" mentality.  The only way to resolve that is to have a common enemy to unite all nations as human.  <br>  <br>  It's a little pessimestic, but it reminded me very much of the 1980s.<br>  <br>  ETA: It is an alternate universe.  Remember Nixon is elected to 5 terms.  Presumably, something happened to stop the passing of the 22nd amendment.  There have been challenges to the 22nd amendment (including from Harry Reid) and I think it's a clear warning about the dangers of not changing leadership of a nation.|`|ofP7bbX7aa	It sucks to be a liberal extremists.|`|EHkmUVQIaa	Your nation is invincible as long as it has Dr. Manhattan on its side.<br>  Never trust smart, good-looking Greek businessmen.
b663010fec563a8838443a18a6bec461aa	It is against the law to use a private driveway to conduct a three point turn.<br>  At least, that is what I believe.<br>  I can't tell you where I heard this or who told me because I don't remember,<br>  but that's my understanding.<br>  That would mean the woman was trespassing on private property without the owner's consent.<br>  Especially if it's a private, owner-maintained road.<br>  But even though it's private property, considering the close proximity to a public street, I believe the owner is responsible for a reasonably safe area.<br>  But it doesn't really matter what I believe.<br>  The final decision would be up to a judge so it could go either way..|`|jlgfkyrEaa	Here is the law in regards to trespassers and injury, and basically the same for damages as well<br>  The owner or possessor property does not owe trespassers a duty of ordinary care. With regard to a trespasser, a possessor of property only need refrain from willful or wanton injury. <br>  <br>  The lady doesn't have a leg to stand on if she decides to take this to court. the law is clear plus the neighborhood has signs posted that specifically state that it is a private community and not to enter.|`|b1eacc63c481ff40082f035f83d011d1aa	Were there signs by the driveway of "Beware of Dog"? if a large potentially dangerous dog has free run uf an unfenced property, the owners should be liable for it.<br>  <br>  Signed? ... then your neighbour has a good case for Trespassing and the dog is the best way to identify cars that speed off after checking out homes to steal from.<br>  <br>  Upgrade the sign to read:<br>  "TRESPASSERS WILL BE FED TO THE DOG. <br>  BONES BURRIED IN MANY SHALLOW GRAVES"|`|yXx1nB0Qaa	if the dog was at the edge of the property then she may have a case for improperly restrained dog, if she pulled in and down the driveway well off the road then I would say she wouldn't have a leg to stand on.|`|a19b1f4db1d77cea5f81a0935b914989aa	She has no claim.

The insurance guys will duke it out and she will lose.|`|6cd7cae3f8d44a82dd6c9bf47a165cd6aa	just deny deny|`|xqrwDmyUaa	I think if she does decide to sue it will come down to how far up the driveway she drove, if she admits to driving all the way up a very long drive (obviously not turning around but being nosey) she'll probably lose. There is not really any way for your neighbours to prove how far up she drove on their drive. It'll probably cost her most in court costs to sue than it would to just pay the damage herself. It's likely she'll just let it go. Also does the neighbour have a beware of dog sign? I believe that actually can make a difference in these types of cases. I know it's hard to sue an owner of a dog when you enter the property of the owner, since it is totally legal to allow a animal to roam free on your own property, and the driveway is certainly their property. There is no reason to use a driveway to turn around, 3 point turns are easy, so I am not sure she can say she had to use their drive or anything. I say let her sue.|`|NmLMUOkXaa	It might depend on where you live. Here a guy got charged for murder because his shed was repeatedly being broken into, he filed reports with the police to no avail then he rigged the door to the shed, long story short the thief tried to break in again and died from his injuries.

q4EXFhV7aa	I fully agree. One good part about this bill, among the other obvious benefits, is that the law will allow the woman to determine how the stem cells are used. If she no longer wants them, traditionally, they would be declared 'medical waste' and thrown away. Now, she can choose: have them deemed 'medical waste'...have them available for 'adoption' by another infertile couple, or have them used for research. It is her choice to make, so that makes me quite happy.|`|S6XSLvjLaa	You DO KNOW that this is about federal funding dont you?  There has always been stem cell research.  This is nothing new.

Just think of all the deadly diseases we will now be able to research and find cures.  I know California was one of the very few states that was funding this research, but we needed the full force of the federal government to really fund the research labs. Like we did with the Manhattan Project for the A -bomb and NASA for space exploration.  Both of those projects really moved humanity into the twenty first century by ending WW2 and developing micro computers that are so valuable today.to name just a few.  I sincerely believe that President Obama is going to be one of the greatest Presidents this country ever had.|`|uFTO5rs8aa	My stance is that it's about time.  We should put science first before religious fanaticism. <br>  <br>  There are absolutely moral and ethical dilemmas that can arise in science, but this is not one of them.  Some people act like these embryos are 2 year old babies we're putting in a blinder (which WOULD be outrageous), when it's a collection of cells that were probably going to either go to waste by sitting in a freezer for decades or be destroyed anyway.<br>  <br>  Would these religious nuts be fine with putting a human in a freezer for 10 years? No.  But they don't mind putting an embryo in one, when they consider an embryo a human?  Hypocritical.<br>  <br>  This is a clear stance that the Obama administration will welcome science as a guide in our society, not anathema, unlike the Bush administration.|`|AA10138269	When I first heard of it I was completely against and then someone in the R/S section told me about the adult alternative research. Today, I listen to some news report about the embryos that were going to be destroyed and some that belong to couples who have the choice of using them or donating. I believe that's a nice touch but I am still skeptical of it period.|`|fo4sZWdAaa	People are so quick to answer that if your against it you are a right wing religious fanatic.  This is a moral issue not religious.  Just because it might mean curing horrible diseases that doesn't justify the fact of killing embryos. which no matter how hard anyone tries to deny they are living.  just because it doesn't look like a baby yet doesn't mean it isn't.|`|kB7Wuyknaa	I agree with you.

The ICC is completely independent of the U.N. mutually exclusive bodies...|`|1mZTOQHEaa	Yes they can. The ICC has the right to exercise universal jurisdiction with regards to what is legally defined as war crimes. And unlike our national courts, it may also give warrants for the arrest of heads of state even if they're still in office.<br>  <br>  It is true that there's no guarantee that such a warrant may be recognized by the states involved, but it will indeed limit the travels abroad for the fugitive.

People who do that seldom do anything well.<br>  <br>  The economy should obviously be priority number one.  The president should assemble a task force of top-flight business people and economists who know how things work and let them come up with a plan, or a series of plans addressing a variety of issues. Leave the politicians out of it.  They created the problem and they’re not going to solve it.  They’ll just make it worse.  We have 535 senators and representatives.  They constitute a big committee, and everyone knows that committees don’t make decisions.  Most of our elected officials are lawyers, and if you look at what happened in the mortgage crisis, it’s clear they don’t understand that industry or any other.  They spend their time crafting legislation we don’t need and resolutions nobody cares about, and then they bicker and debate trying to get votes.<br>  <br>  Put health care on the back burner for now. It will take years to develop a workable health care system (it took France 50 years to get its system fully operational).  <br>  <br>  I am not surprised the president is tired.  He’s going to have to set some priorities or he’s going to collapse.  And he’s not the only one.  His entire team is probably exhausted – and they’re not even eight weeks into their terms.  The president shouldn’t be worrying about stem cell research or taxes on cigars.  <br>  <br>  As former president Clinton famously said, “It’s the economy, stupid."  That’s much truer now than it was back in 1992, and it’s the economy that the president needs to be concerned with.  He needs to get his head screwed on straight and stop throwing money around or he’s going to bankrupt us, if we’re not already bankrupt.  He needs to make sure he understands what our problems are before he throws money at them.  He gives a troubled bank billions of dollars in bailout money and the next thing we know, it’s back for more.  And we don’t even know what that money was used for!|`|CVtwbIKLaa	shame man - all the other presidents got to sleep in and relax, right??<br>  <br>  this what comes of putting in an inexperienced, unprepared socialist|`|wl1wVZ4Haa	A concerned president?

FUL3Ez2Iaa	First I find it interesting that he waits until the announcement about such great strides in adult and umbilical stem cells reached before he signs the reversal.  Good timing...not, just wanting to keep himself in the limelight, yes.  <br>  Second, I support stem cell research whole heartily. The private sector has done some wonderful things with adult, umbilical and placental stem cells. In fact, just yesterday it was announced that the private sector has developed an adult skin stem cell that has the same capabilities as that of an embryo. Also, a young lady from our community who was born blind has had her sight restored by umbilical stem cell therapy.  This is amazing!  And a wonderful blessing!<br>  I am against killing embryos for stem cells as there is NO NEED. Look at all the umbilical cords and placentas out there. I also am against Federal funding for embryonic stem cell research as there is NO NEED, the private sector is doing a great job and we have no money for the Government to provide the funding.|`|gDn1LVRxaa	Stem cell research is needed. Millions of people have died from diseases that could be cured using Stem cells. We know how many lives it can save and improve. I do not understand why in the world anyone would be against it and I bet that most people who are "against" it would be the first to take advantage of it.

Hussein and Iran were at war with each other; and as any thinking person would do, Saddam Hussein used every weapon at his disposal (including the ones we sold him).  So Iran got a little miffed when they saw our weapons flying at them.<br>  <br>  Granted, we did not authorize them for that use.  But do you really think the Iranians have time to care about that one way or the other while our weapons are flying at their soldiers?<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  Christianity is a beautiful religion; at least the one Jesus gave us.

Only about 1 in 100 people serve their country in the military.  It is a brave thing to do because these are armed forces and its always dangerous in any branch.  <br>  <br>  The biggest benefit I don't think can be weighed for in monetary value.  You get the greatest gift in life and that is honor.  It is an honorable thing to sacrifice.  This is what those that won't sign up won't do.  This is why the military men and women are so respected.  Its not about fighting for your country, that is what we to prepare for but hope never happens... its about serving your country and doing a job that someone has to do.  If nobody signed up we'd have no security and protection and no peace here.  Everyone can't think like that... if they did, then America wouldn't be what it is today.  It is the great country it is today because it was built by those who spilled their blood and guts for it in the trenches, the skies, and the seas.<br>  <br>  Now the pay is fair.  You are compensated well.  they pretty much provide everything.  A salary full medical/dental, housing, food, etc ...etc..  You'll make great friends, have a great time in boot camp.  Enjoy the experience.  Some will retire at it.  Some will leave early.  Some will pay the ultimate sacrifice... but you get out of it what you want to.  Just don't worry about all the bells and whistles and the destination in life.  Learn to enjoy the ride.<br>  <br>  The military is a great home for a lot of people.  Camaraderie is unmatched... and you will have close relationships that you will never forget.  The military is a lifestyle and some say a religion.  For me its just my future.  I'm signing up soon.  My brother, dad and grandfather all served.  I'm next.  Good luck with your decision.<br>  <br>  I'll be in the Navy and the Maine Corps as a Navy Corpsman.  <br>  <br>  Just remember no matter what branch you sign up for.  We're all on the same team out there.|`|9db6577c31cba2dca461af45ce8d1b3aaa	Join if you feel motivated to do so...you might be surprised at how much you like it.

And file a CIVIL LAWSUIT against them aswell. By law they are not allowed to harass you the was they were, they weren't allowed in your home with out a warrant either. What the process server was doing and saying to you was harrassment. Also, I am not sure if this applies to you, but if you are DISABLED meaning collect social security disability then it is against the law for bill collectors to call and harass you.

The private army( Blackthorn) is costing Haliburtin a lot of money so the Bush cheney  team looked for an excuse to invade Iraq and get rid of Saddam. Since they had the power to do it they used  US troops to  guard Haliburtion for free, for seven years and send the bill to the taxpayers.<br>   Bush was aware that we were about to be attacked but ignored the warnings from the CIA, this has been documented.

The IRS has no choice but to take your employers word for their statement of the earnings you made. You do however have the opportunity when you file taxes to rebut your employers statement as to what you have made. <br>  <br>  Most private companies are under the impression that they are a collection agency for the IRS, and think they must take taxes out of your wages. Actually though this fallacy is untrue, they are not legally required to take out taxes on their workers. You notice I did not use the word "Employee" their is a reason for this.<br>  Most people fail to understand this, and are totally unaware of this fact, so don't feel like you are alone. The best way to learn about what to  do and how to make a rebuttal statement about your actual earnings to the IRS is go to losthorizons.com . Peter Henrickson is an accomplished author and researcher and has gone through the IRS's entire code book and has learned the truth about taxes that the Government and the IRS does not want the American people to learn. <br>  Peter has also written a book titled "Cracking the Code the Facinating Truth about Taxation in America". I would suggest you read the book and visit his website before filing your taxes. The book and the website are both very easy to read and understand. <br>  Also I almost forgot to mention  the definations of common words we normally think have different meanings in the IRS's code book as well. For instance if I was to call you an "employee" you would think I worked for your company but the truth is that the IRS definition of the word "employee is a person that works for the federal state or local government. They are called privledged workers because of all of the extra benefits they get, these people in reality for the most  part are the only people who are required to pay income taxes. Your individual situation may be different however sinse I do not know who you work for. If you,  fill out your W2 or W4 incorrectly, and send this in to the IRS you are catorgizing your self incorrectly as a government worker, and the IRS will gladly keep your money. Like I said visit the website and read the book to learn more. This is called the re-education of the American people.|`|3785eeef30e9bd9c24c59001fddabeb6aa	When you and I write the Constitution for the New Republic, we will be sure to add this definition to it so that this theft of property will never happen again.|`|nx7QtF0paa	The Federal Reserve.

HJR-192 superseded Public Law (what passes as law today is only "color of law”), replacing it with public policy. This eliminated our ability to PAY our debts, allowing only for their DISCHARGE. When we use any commercial paper (checks, drafts, warrants, federal reserve notes, etc.), and accept it as money, we simply pass the unpaid debt attached to the paper on to others, by way of our purchases and transactions. This unpaid debt, under public policy, now carries a public liability for its collection. In other words, all debt is now public.<br>  The United States government, in order to provide necessary goods and services, created a commercial bond (promissory note), by pledging the property, labor, life and body of its citizens, as payment for the debt (bankruptcy). This commercial bond made chattel (property) out of every man, woman and child in the United States. We became nothing more than "human resources" and collateral for the debt. This was without our knowledge and/or our consent. How? It was done through the filing (registration) of our birth certificates!<br>  By pledging your labor to the Fed for example, it gave them the ability to tax you for whatever labor you may do. Hence Federal Income Tax.<br>  This contract made to you without your knowledge, overrides the constitution, bill of rights, etc. Because they are not allowed to interfere with such a commercial contract. its all in the UCC - Uniform Commercial Code.

This one will be no different, irrespective of the Republican hangers-on who signed onto it.<br>  <br>  Edit: Do you not understand what "price fixing" means?  The Fed sets its own overnight rate for short-term lending and its own discount window rate.  That's it.  The rate controls the price of interbank lending through the Fed itself and some other securities issuance.  It has nothing to do with "price fixing," and it's not even an exclusive operation.  This is what we call an "open market" system, and it's a basic part of regulating the money supply, which is what the Fed is meant to do.  You keep going on and on about the Fed, but you don't even seem to understand what its job is.  And then you call ME an idiot.  Sheesh.<br>  <br>  Edit: Listen, my homey, my ace-in-the-hole, we've been over this before.  Congress is explicitly granted the power to:<br>  "To coin Money, regulate the Value thereof, and of foreign Coin, and fix the Standard of Weights and Measures;"<br>  in Article 1 Section 8.  Congress is further granted the power to:<br>  "To make all Laws which shall be necessary and proper for carrying into Execution the foregoing Powers, and all other Powers vested by this Constitution in the Government of the United States, or in any Department or Officer thereof."<br>  in Section 9 of the same article.

Either he is willfully ignorant of the Federal Reserve or he is an agent of mis-information. Anyone with half a brain can figure out why a central banking system ruins a country. To have the power of coining money in the hands of a few men, that the government cannot control. The golden rule is that, he who has the gold makes the rules. That is why these international bankers control the entire government, can start wars at a whim, and can take away peoples rights without thinking twice. Now. how and in what way is this a good system Adam B? to have an entire nation on its knees in front of a handful of ruthless bankers, its asinine. The only reason Ron Paul's bills fail is because he is essentially the only guy in congress really fighting for the rights of the people, as well as trying to take back the entire country from being ruled by its system of credit. its a dangerous position to take, and most other congressman have been bought up or threatened into slavery for the guys pulling the strings. Its a comfort to know there is at least one freedom fighter in congress, still trying to set things right.

The pig odor study.  A bridge of too great expense to serve too few.  However, when Congress does it at least it is in public.

Born in Texas, later moved to Chicago, said to have joined the communist party during the Great Depression and joined the unemployment movement which was protesting to get unemployment payments for people. He then joined the Abraham Lincoln Battalion, a volunteer unit that fought for the Popular Front in the Spanish Civil war in Spain. He died in 1937 after being made a commander of his brigade and was one of  80,000 Republican troops in Spain. <br>  <a href="http://www.spartacus.schoolnet.co.uk/SPlawO.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.spartacus.schoolnet.co.uk/SPl...</a><br>  <br>  As for Frank Davis, he was an excellent poet and moved to Hawaii to expand on his writing. Required reading when I was in school. <br>  His name was apparently placed on the "list" of many, many names for investigation by the House on Un-American Activities Committee which ran from 1934-1975.<br>  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/House_Un-American_Activities_Committee" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/House_Un-Am...</a><br>  <br>  My parents and all my friends parents lived through the Great Depression. One has to understand that whole era and things that were taking place for a good thirty years afterward, before jumping to the conclusion that all these movements were horribly bad per say, or that these people were all horribly bad. <br>  I suppose one could find some comparison of that time to the freedom movements of the 70's and the protests of the Vietnam war, as many during that time were also on the "list." <br>  I'm sure there were hooligans back in the 20's on forward that weren't good people, doing bad things, and then those who joined in that were attempting to be heard but went on a separate path after awhile. <br>  Each generation has some form of rebellious group or protest taking place so it seems. <br>  <a href="http://www.answers.com/topic/frank-davis" rel="nofollow">http://www.answers.com/topic/frank-davis</a><br>   <br>  In President Obama's book, it states that Frank" and his grandfather had become friends and his grandfather introduced them with the hopes that "Frank" could pass on cultural knowledge that his grandfather couldn't.  He was 9-10 years old at the time.  I think his grandfather doing that is admirable and a sign of strength. <br>  It is easy to assume that "Frank" is the same poet, and I do think he probably was.  Because he was referred to as only "Frank" in the book, does not mean there is some super secret being hidden, but rather a literary style of writing.<br>  <br>  This isn't of course the answer that people want to hear who want to join bandwagons that everything is bad about the President and anyone he ever knew in his lifetime.  I can look through my own lifetime so far and find things distasteful with people I've known over the years, but research and learning history can be an enlightening experience.

If the next President was to abolish the IRS, you would probably see Nancey Pelosi, Barbra Boxer, John Murtha scream bloody murder!

If they choose to restructure the welfare system, they might actually might make it for those that really need it!<br>  <br>   Ah-hah! You and I know that this is only a dream.

7HKTDcvYaa	No, aboriginal children would have continued to die as a result of disease no matter where they might have been confined. If anything could have saved them it would have been return of more of the land to their community, return of hunting rights over much more of the land, even providing some extra food.<br>  <br>  It would have accomplished nothing when so much of the problem with disease came from hunger, and want of immunity to common European diseases. With deliberate spreading of some diseases as acts of war, any pretense that there was any intent to protect aboriginal children has to be seen as a dastardly lie.|`|8840f90d1236990da5c34043fc11245faa	Treating them like Australian citizens and stop classing  them as Flora and Fauna as they were then would have been a good start.<br>  A lot of people don't realize that the reason for the stolen generation was not done out of concern for these children but to breed out the Aboriginal race that's why half-caste children were taken.|`|FUL3Ez2Iaa	A lot of the stolen generation were taken from a loving parent or other family/tribe member.

If it's fear of reprimand from the bosses and such, you can keep  your name out of it. If it's fear of being unemployed, there are other places to work.

I hope you make the right decisions and report it.|`|BvZvZaxzaa	That's nasty... I don't know if it's a health code violation to put the hot dogs back in the cooler and re-heat them, but leaving them uncovered is definitely wrong. Having mice is unsanitary and should be taken care of immediately. You can make an anonymous report to the health department but you might put your job at risk. If it was me, I would try correcting the problem and try to get the manager to do the right thing. If he/she refuses, then you have to do the right thing and report it.|`|201bdWmUaa	Yes i do think that you should report your work to the health department. I have worked with food for over 9 yrs and i have to follow strict food handling procedures. I always say if you have the slightest concern about if you should sell it or not then don't. Check online for handling procedures and maybe see if there is a mananger above your manager and speak to them.

It is just loss of water, dehydration.<br>  <br>  From a flavour perspective, or texture, there is an impact. So cutting the number treated this way will be best.<br>  <br>  Mice are a matter of concern, but not where the freezer is concerned. It is critical to ensure that no food is left exposed where mice can get to it. It is also helpful to make sure that mouse droppings are kept cleaned up. But health authorities are concerned mostly about having mice get into food. If that is happening you may want to make some proposals to avoid having the theater fined or have its license to serve food revoked.  Only when you have done that should you consider bringing in the health department.
cb3e9cf8eec00dc2d12cd586dec23a82aa	This act could ultimately claim that u r defaming islam if you say Jesus is the messiah or if u say God is Jehovah. Because you don't agree with them, it's insulting. That, to them, makes it a defamation. I personally wouldn't want to lose that right, but for decades it's been acknowledged that the UN would ultimately destroy religion. This is definitely the first step. UN is even trying to criminalize parents who rear their children religiously, with the backing of a US senator. This is totalitarianism. Of course it's wrong. Why should one religion be considered "untouchable" in terms of opinions? So if a muslim says "Islam is the only way to God," I can only agree or I can agree to say nothing, otherwise, if I disagree, I could go to jail for defaming islam.|`|UpZFb6X5aa	Since the UN isn't trying to restrict free speech, yur informant is mistaken.<br>  <br>  Now, the UN may officially condemn bigots who try to spread hate against others based on religion.

The ,"...false brethren creeping in unaware" are part of UN issues. In fact they do have a terrible Islamic and catrostrophic like experience with Islamic sources.<br>     Surely those that offend God and His word take their chances as such.<br>    Islam holds twisted concepts while using the name of the Hebrew profits and undermining Jesus?Yeshus, Moses and all the prophets while seducing and deceiving the nations.<br>    This is the plight of Islam like a wayward goat filled with strife, false teaching and having satan as their blind guide seeking to devour the innocent , meek.  Violence aand strife are her names!  Lies and deception are her teachings.<br>    My experiences again I will share is that they do employ satan  and demonic spirits and entertain satanic hosts.<br>     Those in Christ know them well and guard thygemselves from the demonic forces.<br>     The Un as a peacehkeeping force have been overwhelmed by Islammic sources,  bloodshed and strife.<br>     The bible, Christains and Jews are Islams source of hatred.

They know the truth about Islam and regard it as such.<br>      People can be offended with Islam as the Holy Spiorit confesses that satan is theiir guide.

I was just told that most of them only want money for booze and drugs. And its true.|`|q4EXFhV7aa	I was never taught that. Many feel entitled....due to circumstances, upbringing, a variety of reasons. Many feel that helping out others in legitimate need is 'socialism'. Many others think that we should focus on our country first, when our country is one of the richest nations in the world. The FACT is, a quarter of a million of our VETERANS are homeless in America. The FACT is, 3 million of our children have no home or family to care for them. The FACT is, 9 million children around the world starved to death in 2008. While we DO spend money on all of these programs, we don't spend enough, and we don't spend it in the right ways. Our focus should be on pulling people out of poverty....job training, education, infrastructure, sustainability....NOT just a hand out or aid. Unfortunately, in the short term, that means more money...for a long term investment of fewer people in permanent need......but, no one wants to take the time, spend the energy, or commit to the hard work and dedication it would take to actually make a difference...so we continue to throw a minimal amount of money at the problem...just to get them by another day.|`|GDbQQhPsaa	The only positive out of africa is the abundance of natural resources otherwise i dont know, i feel that people are mostly lazy and depend easily on food and money aid sent by the westerners. I know there are many issues like war and drought etc but tell me one country in this world where there isnt drought, floods and famine? What makes africa so much special? If aid is the most important thing for westerners then why did they ignore china and india all this time until both of these countries fought their way to the economic freedom?<br>  <br>  America has already made africa a miserable place to live by sending aid and money.. Its because when there is free availaibility of aid, no one will want to fight for a survival. "An idol mind is a devil's workshop" and because of this, most africans get involved in criminal activities and they are also sure that they will get the food and money aid no matter what. It'll continue to be a miserable place if africans dont find a way to sustain themselves. It'll be a struggle but dependency on aid will continue to worsen the situation. They can start with agriculture revolution which was successfully done in india which led to new jobs and abundance of food supplies. If you consider india to be poor then think again because since it's independence it has never depended on UN for food aid. Even if there was unemployment, there were no food shortages. <br>  <br>  Think about how much potential africa has to develop itself and manufacture smart people in the society if they learn to be self dependent.|`|hbOFDysJaa	We're not taught that.  My problem is that there are people here in America that are starving and suffering, but people are rushing to help other countries before their own.  I don't understand that.

I just think we should help our own people first, then help the rest of the world.  <br>  <br>  Side note:  It might help the Americans that do need more help if those who are taking advantage of the system would get off their lazy rears and work.  Not everyone who receives help actually needs it.

Yet, a UN study finds that the situation hasn't improved or is worse.  One problem is corruption.  African political leaders use the money for themselves.  They buy cars and mansions.  Other countries simply try to figure out new way to get free money, and not on improving the situation, mean while the citizens suffer.  <br>  If you want to donate money, then do it though a charity.  Charities are more responsible with the money, and most goes to the actual aid, and not a politician's wallet.  <br>  <br>  Watch this clip about foreign aid:<br>  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2oyRzzZ9Eig" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2oyRzzZ9E...</a><br>  <br>  This clip is about the people with the sign "will work for food"  in America:<br>  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AFYZoYI_SWA" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AFYZoYI_S...</a><br>  <br>  Both are interesting.

yQ0OzEbZaa	You are right, Obamas stimulus plan will cause inflation by the forth quarter of 2009. This is a story that I recently heard that I think best explains BO's form of stimulus.<br>  <br>   Shortly after class, an economics student approaches his economics professor and says, “I don’t understand this stimulus bill. Can you explain it to me?”<br>  <br>   The professor replied, “I don’t have any time to explain it at my office, but if you come over to my house on Saturday and help me with my weekend project, I’ll be glad to explain it to you.” The student agreed.<br>  <br>   At the agreed-upon time, the student showed up at the professor’s house. The professor stated that the weekend project involved his backyard pool.<br>  <br>   They both went out back to the pool, and the professor handed the student a bucket. Demonstrating with his own bucket, the professor said, “First, go over to the deep end, and fill your bucket with as much water as you can.”<br>  <br>   The student did as he was instructed. The professor then continued, “Follow me over to the shallow end, and then dump all the water from your bucket into it.” The student was naturally confused, but did as he was told.<br>  <br>  The professor then explained they were going to do this many more times, and began walking back to the deep end of the pool. The confused student asked, “Excuse me, but why are we doing this?”<br>  <br>   The professor matter-of-factly stated that he was trying to make the shallow end much deeper.<br>  <br>   The student didn’t think the economics professor was serious, but figured that he would find out the real story soon enough.<br>  <br>  However, after the 6th trip between the shallow end and the deep end, the student began to become worried that his economics professor had gone mad. The student finally replied, “All we’re doing is wasting valuable time and effort on unproductive pursuits.<br>   Even worse, when this process is all over, everything will be at the same level it was before, so all you’ll really have accomplished is the destruction of what could have been truly productive action!”<br>  <br>  The professor put down his bucket and replied with a smile, “Congratulations.

The government believes that throwing money at this economic crisis is the answer (the Bush administration gave away $8.5 TRILLION* in corporate welfare checks before Obama took office). Now, Obama's 'experts' are telling him to throw more money at AIG, CitiBank, GM, Chrysler, and other 'big' businesses because they're "too big to fail" and because "bankruptcy is not an option". This is ridiculous.<br>  It's like a father buying his irresponsible teen-age son a third new Ferrari after the kid's already wrecked two of them. <br>  Government needs to change the corporate culture that exists in this country be encouraging more 'small' business. The larger any corporation, organization or government gets, the less manageable it becomes, and the fewer people benefit from it.  -RKO-  03/09/09|`|fUh7LHzvaa	Actually, this will only happen if the economy actually recovers, we could see tons of inflation.

Lets say I have a counterfeit machine. If I print a million dollars, how much is the money worth?  <br>  <br>  A. One million dollars<br>  <br>  Q. Where has the value come from?<br>  <br>  A. The value has come from from all the other dollars, I have diluted the value of the other dollars by inflating the money supply, I have created inflation.<br>  <br>  I have stolen from every person who owns dollars. In this sense when a government increases spending without taxing they are leveraging a tax.<br>  <br>  People often say inflation is the rising of prices, this is not technically correct. If money is printed the supply of money inflates. The symptom of the inflation is a decrease in the value of the dollar, and the visible symptom is the increase in prices.<br>  <br>  So the answer to your question, how spending this much  money will not create inflation, is this: It already has, the money supply has already increased. <br>  <br>  Prices will rise in time as the market learns or the increase, it takes time for the money to 'trickle down' and increase everyday prices, but it will happen.<br>  <br>  But the money supply has already increased so inflation has already happened. Think about this, if the US government has spent 5T dollars since October in spending bills, and there are 200M tax payers, thats a unapproved tax of $25,000 per tax payer.<br>  <br>  The Obama budget has a 2T deficit, thats a tax of $4,000 per tax payer.|`|AA11359417	Well, some inflation is a good thing.  Think about it, prices in houses you want to inflate, then you sell it, for a profit.  Honestly, any inflation now is better then deflation.  When you have deflation, you are in a nasty cycle where everyone will wait to purchase because the price will be cheaper later on.  <br>  <br>  By not spending, history has shown that it does not help the economy.  Look at the 1930's.  FDR passed the new deal, and it was working.  He stopped the new deal, and started doing as his opponents wanted, and the unemployment started to increase again, so he re-instated the New Deal.|`|h1j1KPzJaa	ZERO answers when I looked at this question, is that because they have NO ANSWER!|`|M77i6Kdnaa	i dont think there is an answer..<br>  <br>  besides printing more money. how do we get all this money back?

Add that to the government interference in medical practice and you have a lot of disillusioned medical practitioners. <br>  <br>  It is not surprising that minorities are filling the gaps, various governments are offering all types of incentive to increase the rapidly declining numbers of practitioners.

You can't have a real democracy if only 40% of people vote, and when things get really bad it goes up to 60%.  It requires a certain level of interest on the part of all the people.  And a willingness to make tough choices.  And the brains not to listen to leaders who just tell us what we want to hear.  Or, as Paul Harvey used to say, you can't have self-government without self discipline.<br>  <br>  The only alternative is dictatorship!  I mean think about it.

BIQrsl4paa	The first answer just about covered the whole question. Just a few more details:<br>  1. There are at least 20 applicants for each pilot vacancy that exists in the entire military.<br>  2. A college degree is only the first of several requirements, you also need 20/20 vision, the ability to pass a Class 1 flight physical, and your body has to conform to a certain, almost inflexible, set of measurements (you have to fit the seat and be able to reach the controls properly). These are not the only requirements, just the ones I remember from 18 years as an Army Recruiter.<br>  Do yourself a favor, aim a little lower. While I am no fan of the Air Force, it can be a good place to get skill training and money for your continuing education.|`|1e2f43229ec8209aa65abb663da29738aa	I think what the other answerer was trying to say is that you have to be an officer to fly in the Air Force, and you have to have a 4 year college degree to do that. The Air Force Officer Training School is a little more difficult to get into than the other branches. They really emphasize excellence, so you'd need to a stellar college GPA to be competitive and it really helps to have your degree in a field they can use, i.e. mathematics or science. If all else fails just check the website: www.airforce.com|`|BMkVOR0caa	You do not take the ASVAB to fly aircraft.  The ASVAB is for enlisted members.

You really don't get a say in what you will do, but all Infantry is eventually ground whether you jump out of a blackhawk, plane, or a BFV, you'll end up on the ground. If I was to join all over again I would have gone Special Forces right out of the gate, do all the schools at once in the beginning if a lieutenant can do it, so can any smart man. It's all in your head what you need to do. Although now I suffer from arthritis in my back, ankles, and knees.

Benning's inprocessing unit) because the two go to different basic trainings. No, you dont choose which one you want. you signed a contract saying that you wanna be a 11x, which you gave them the authority to choose for you. as far as which one they try to fill, it depends on the classes running. but its a 85% chance you will be 11B. and thank God too. being a charlie sucks.|`|esOaJoqBaa	11B is a regular infantryman, they are the standard rifle platoon, while an 11C is a mortarman.

hqbt98QIaa	Unless you have business at the Embassy, you will be turned away. It's not like it appears in the movies. The consular section may have a walk-up window or something similar for citizens of the country they represent, but not always. If you have visa or emergency issues, a phone call will get you a lot further especially if its after hours. <br>  <br>  There are procedures for determining refugee status and an application process. The "refugee" in question would most likely get a brief consultation and some paperwork and be sent away. <br>  <br>  Embassies are technically foreign soil, but again, reality is different than the Hollywood version with which everyone is so familiar. The accords of the Vienna Convention give certain diplomatic rights and privileges which are honored based on reciprocity between the host and visiting consulate/embassy such that they can carry out their business. Each government treats the other (in most cases) as they want their diplomats and situations treated in the opposite situation.  This doesn't mean the local government can't enter the Embassy, quite to the contrary, the visiting Embassy works vary closely with the host country especially on things like extradition and international crime and a citizen who hopes to evade local prosecution by running to their Embassy will probably be held and handed over when the local police arrive as they are still criminals in that (the host) country.|`|JgU9vaP4aa	if u wanted to enter your own embassy just show your passport or some form of ID that proves your a canadian. there r times  your embassy would have to ppl who r canadian and for ppl who are not canadian and need to do business. so make sure to call and ask what times you need to show up if you have business.<br>  as for China and North Korean.........once inside they cant not pull them out. but the trick here is to get passed the gards outside the wall waiting for refugees to try to get close to the embassies.<br>  most embassies i know of in forgein countries have one road and they r garded heavly by police fromt hat country. not for reasons like this but for alot of reasons. <br>  im sure if they make it inside the gates.....they will get stopped by their own security and then called into the embassy by the consulete.

tT06e5zPaa	I agree; If people are against an abortion, then it is all their choice to keep the fetus, but trying to force people into not having abortions is ridiculous! <br>  <br>  Even if Abortions were illegal, women will still have them- only in very unsafe ways. <br>  <br>  More importantly, it's essential that we don't judge anyone else; how do we know what's going on in their lives?|`|Ch9TedMcaa	Its all about religious beliefs and philosophy. Anti-abortion people will tell you that a "fetus" is a baby. They don't want the government in our wallets, but they want the government in people's personal lives. Funny how these same people say nothing if a child in Iraq gets killed in gunfire or their parents strap a bomb on them and tell them to go inside of a market to kill hundreds of people. They also could care less about the "baby" once its born.<br>  <br>  No one has the right to tell a woman what she can or cannot do with her own body.|`|q4EXFhV7aa	They believe that every fetus is special....but DO NOT believe they should have to help an impoverished mother through labor and delivery. They WANT the government to force you to carry a fetus to term, but REFUSE to help out in any way to care for the child who is born.They DO NOT believe that a 1 hour old child is special if that child lives below the poverty level. The second the fetus become a child, the mother and child are 'welfare hos' and 'welfare thugs'....and, a new one from today's YAnswers....the children are 'litters'...as in dogs.<br>  <br>  They think that every fetus that isn't wanted should be carried 9 months and adopted.....<br>  Unfortunately, there are already 3 million children in the US alone awaiting homes and families..and 250 million worldwide.<br>  So, obviously, there aren't NEARLY enough parents for all of the children who need parents currently, much less when everyone is forced to carry fetuses to term that they don't want or can't care for. <br>  Anti-abortion is a fine stance....until it actually plays out in real life. The SAME people who are against abortion are the SAME people who repeatedly vote against social measures to care for impoverished children and their mothers, the SAME people who openly attack and criticize poor children, the SAME people who think everyone should 'adopt' but haven't ever visited Child Protective Services to help support some of the 3 million children that need their help. <br>  <br>  EDIT: Bluelot: AGAIN, Partial Birth Abortion is and has been outlawed by the supreme court since 2003.

It falls under abortion but the difference is the baby is born completely except for it's head is left in the birth canal and then a suction tube is place in the base of the skull and the brain sucked out while it's alive.

That's when the division of cells begins, unique DNA is formed, etc.  I don't think anyone could reasonably argue that said life is human... after all, it's not a fish or a dog or an oak tree.<br>  <br>  The kicker comes down to the point where that life is considered a person.<br>  <br>  A Pro-life individual believes that personhood begins with conception and therefore the fetus has the legal and moral right to equal protection under the law.  That morally, having an abortion is no different than killing a newborn, or a three year old, or a 50 year old.  Saying that "I woudn't have an abortion, but I wouldn't tell someone else they couldn't" is the moral equilivent of saying "I would never murder someone on the street, but if someone else wants to do it, I can't say that they shouldn't."  <br>  <br>  Conversely, a pro choice person believes that personhood either occurs at birth, or at some point during the preganancy.  Some people believe that abortion should be a viable alternative right up until birth.  Other people draw the line at the point where the fetus could survive outside the womb, or when brain waves are registered, or when the zygote implants. <br>  <br>  Therefore, before this point, the fetus is not a person and therefore has no rights.  So the rights of the mother override everything else.  <br>  <br>  But getting back to your point about choice vs no choice, a pro-life person doesn't see it that way.  A pro life person sees no difference between an abortion and murdering the child immediately after birth.<br>  <br>  ETA: I don't know how to explain it any differently.  Asking a person with strong pro-life views why they have a problem with other people having abortions is just like saying, "Well, *I* wouldn't go rob a bank, shoot someone in the head, kick the puppy (whatever), but if *you* want to, it's okay."|`|AA10317675	Because they honestly believe it is a human & killing humans is wrong.<br>  <br>  The central question in this debate should be "when is a fetus a human life?"  <br>  Before that point, aboriton is just a medical decision.<br>  After that point, it shoudl not be allowed except when the situation warrants the taking of a human life.  (To save the life of the mother, for example.<br>  <br>  Saying the fetus is a human baby, but that a person should be able to kill it if it is a girl when they wanted a boy, woudl not be "open minded,"  That would be heartless.|`|1i8i22oNaa	Because we believe abortion is not a choice... it's murder.<br>  <br>  We see it as no different than someone killing another person because they are inconvenienced by that person.<br>  <br>  Are we not taking away a choice by allowing a mother to kill their baby?  The baby had no choice... the father had no choice.<br>  <br>  Isn't "Pro-choice" simply a marketing term?  Couldn't people who are for abortion just as easily call it pro-murder?|`|AA10138269	Because abstinence and adoption is the only moral option. Abortion=Murder<br>  <br>  They are doctors and nurses out there who do it for a quick buck and botch it up and causes deaths that's why It should be illegal especially when some caretakers don't even have licenses. Some kids who are underage go to these illegal clinics and the parents don't know anything and its done without parental consent and done under a privacy consent but if something goes wrong who would be responsible Not the caretakers but the parents.|`|2aLx1P6saa	I view abortion as killing someone else. Sorry I cannot find a better way to put that. I personally don't care what people do to their own bodies, but you are harming a separate individual. I am happy to be alive and to have the chance to live. I don't think it is our right to "play god" so to speak.|`|AA11824333	Abortion is the taking of human life. It is murder.|`|kB7Wuyknaa	I agree with you but those who don't simply want to push their religious beliefs on everybody.|`|ofP7bbX7aa	its up to the woman, not anyone else.|`|v0PY0UDAaa	For the same reason people are against the right to choose to murder their newborn baby.  I think we can all agree that no one has the right to terminate the life of another sentient human being.  The question is: When does life begin?  Clearly it is not "at birth".  If you don't recognize it as being some time before birth you are not being intellectually honest.<br>  <br>  Also clearly it is not "at conception", because clearly a single cell does not constitute sentient life.  So it must be somewhere in between.  That ambiguity is the source of all the pro-life vs. pro-choice strife in the world.<br>  <br>  EDIT:<br>  "Nobody is answering the second part of my question. Like I said, you I respect you if you are against abortion but why must abortion be illegal?"<br>  <br>  If you believe that terminating a sentient human life should be a legal choice, then I suppose abortion should be legal as well.  A pro-life person believes abortion is the killing of another human being.  That should be enough to answer the second part of your question.|`|AA10404307	Many people are control freaks.

And they say liberals want to put government in our lives...|`|IvpGWInzaa	Can't we just stop killing babies ?|`|ID6bLAKBaa	Simple...pro lifers see it as murder. I am not against a woman's right to choose. Just against the murder part. Her body is no longer just hers. There is another person inside her. That persons rights needs to be considered as well. Woman have abortions for selfish reasons. There only concern is how this baby will effect them. No concern for the other life inside them.  <br>  <br>  I have many friends who are pro choice and like you would never have an abortion. We just agree to disagree. I look at it from the babies point of view and pro choice choose to look at it from the mother's view. I choose to take up the rights of the child you choose the rights of the mother. I feel she gave up her rights when she made her choice and knew the consequences and needs take responsibility for her actions. <br>  <br>  <br>  Birth control can be planned if you are not ready to be a mom. <br>  <br>  If you respect our opinion then why are you questioning it?<br>  <br>  <br>  My point you don't respect it or you wouldn't question it. You would just accept that this is how it is. This is my opinion. I answered your question saying it is no longer just her body. You just don't like the answer you got. You chose to laydown with that man and take a chance. Now take the responsibility of your actions. Do not expect me as a tax payer to pay for your choice.<br>  <br>  <br>  I do understand the question. I tend to be passonate on this subject just as you are about pro choice. My answer again stays the same. I think about the other life that is being destoryed by the mother's choice. The innocent child. I don't think about the mother because she made her choice. When she layed with that man and took her chances. Should the baby pay for her choice. I realize that you as pro choice choose not recognize it as a baby, because it makes the choice easier to kill. I pro life see it as an innocent life paying for the mistakes of his or her parents. So, I defend the right of the innocent to live. I don't how to put it any plainer.|`|PeI5rpK1aa	I am prochoice. As in I believe you have the choice whether or not to use a condom and go on the pill. There's your choice right there. <br>  <br>  People are against abortion because it's no different from murder. Your still killing a human being, whether or not they're fully developed shouldn't come into it. If you don't want the child, adopt it out. There are plenty of people who are unable to have their own children. More people than babies available in fact.<br>  <br>  Though I do realize it would just be driven underground, and for that reason I regret to say that abortion should be kept legal.|`|pemru8Ckaa	Making it o.k. to have an abortion is the same as making it o.k. to commit murder,no difference.An unborn child is a human being and nothing less.<br>  <br>  Further more,even if the child would come into an uncaring or unable family,how does that diminish the value of the life.Would you rather have a harsh childhood or die?There is always hope for a great future,no matter how your brought up.<br>  <br>  There is only one person who has the right to chose weather the life of the child should end,and that's the child,do you think the baby wants to die?!<br>  <br>  The statement that "what if Hitler was aborted",which I've heard quite often,is absolutely ridiculous;the potential of a life to do horrible things is the same as the potential for a life to do wonderful things,the same statement could just easily have been said  for George Washington,Abraham Lincoln and Martin L.

Makes no sense.|`|v0PY0UDAaa	The issue at hand is whether the proposition was legally added to the ballot according to the state California Constitution.  If it was, the court has no grounds to invalidate the result.<br>  <br>  "The rights of the minority are never subject to popular vote."<br>  <br>  Let's clear this up because this is a dangerous misconception.  The rights of a minority can absolutely be violated without protection from the courts in the case of a constitutional amendment.  The court has only the power to say whether something is constitutional, and an amendment is by definition constitutional.  One of the problems with California state law is that it is too easy to amend the constitution.  It's supposed to be hard to change the constitution since a constitutional change is so powerful and potentially harmful to a class of people.|`|rWdYBmPmaa	No.<br>  <br>  And the election of 2000 was stopped by the courts because al gore the bore only wanted to recount certain districts in FL. if he recounted the entire state then he still would have lost but later.<br>  <br>  And the libs would have still rioted looted raped and everything else they did.|`|q4EXFhV7aa	The 'will of the people' should NEVER be used to deny minorities their civil liberties. <br>  <br>  The 'will of the people' in Arkansas voted to deny single people AND gay people from adopting. While MANY on the right agreed with this decision made in November, the law violates civil rights....as does Prop 8. In Arkansas, the new law states that if your parents are killed in a car accident, and both your grandmother and your aunt agree to take you in and adopt you, BOTH would be denied the ability to care for you solely because they were single. Instead, you would be placed into a group home for children, to await a married, straight couple to foster you until a married straight couple could be found who would agree to adopt you...fat chance. ALL the while, your own family wanted you and wanted to care for you. <br>  BOTH votes should be overturned.|`|fL0wHyNNaa	There is a difference. With prop 8, there was no right of the people to vote on it in the first place. The rights of the minority are never subject to popular vote.

IsGo50kqaa	PETA and Earth First must be really busy of late.  Most violent extremists groups in the USA are left-wing or gangs that thrive in cities.  I suppose it is possible in the western deserts and mountains as there is a lot of uninhabited land to hide in where only the elites can afford to go (roadless areas) and the government (since Obama hasn't had time yet) doesn't track peoples movements.

uvWH4Ioyaa	You need to make a proper Last Will and include a guardianship provision for your children.  This assumes that the children's father is deceased or has had his parental  rights  terminated. Otherwise it does not matter what you put in the Last Will, the children's father will be awarded custody after you are gone unless he is in prison or is permanently disabled and can not physically care for the kids. You had better talk this over with an attorney.<br>  If you are in jail and can not care for the kids, they will go to their father unless he is dead, had his parental rights terminated or has been found by the Court to have abused or neglected the children.<br>  If the father can not be found, you have to explain to the Court what efforts you have undertaken to locate him. Contacted his parents, siblings, former landlord, employer, former employer, police department, motor vehicle registry, published notice in newspaper, etc? If the Court is satisfied you have left no stone unturned, the Court would be able to appoint a legal guardian for the children who could be your parents, brother, sister or good friend.|`|8dc5NMexaa	You place your wishes in your last will and testament.<br>  You do not need an attorney.|`|f4ef0b3a83cc1af75c8cb10f391cb5c9aa	You would put your wishes in your will, however, your children's father would have to agree to the arrangement. <br>  <br>  Same thing if you were to go to jail. The children's father would have to agree that your children should be placed with your mother.|`|51pUgWvGaa	you would have to write a will and get it notarized, or if you have a lawyer they can sign it and present it at the time of your death. But if the father is still alive, and he has some sort of custody of the children already, then you cant decide to give them to your mother, they would automatically be given to their father.  In that case your mother would have to fight for custody, and a note with your wishes would be taken into consideration. But for the most part the law likes to keep children with there parents.
esOaJoqBaa	Boot camp is the smae as Basic training. The Marine Corps has always called it Boot Camp, while the Army used to call it Basic Training. Now the call it AIT.<br>  Following completion of boot camp the new Marine or soldier goes on to their MOS, or job, school where they learn the trade they will be doing. After they complete that school they will be sent to the unit they will be attached to. They will do whatever their job is, be that truck driving, accounting, construction or artillery. This is the unit they will stay in and the unit they deploy with.|`|1W22DSbiaa	Boot Camp & Basic Training is the same thing. Some people call it basic while others call it boot camp. When you get out of boot camp in the Marines you go for your infantry training in North Carolina for 60 days. There, Marines receive instruction in Combat Marksmanship, Grenades, Improvised Explosive Devices, Convoy Operations, Military Operations in Urban Terrain (MOUT), Combat Formations, Land Navigation and Patrolling. In addition, Marines receive instruction specific to their infantry Military Occupational Specialty (MOS). The training cycle includes physical conditioning via Physical Training (PT), conditioning hikes, and sustainment training in the Marine Corps Martial Arts. Leadership Traits and the application of the Marine Corps Core Values in every aspect of the Marine's life are also emphasized. They learn alot more too.

However, try to imagine that you did get in somehow, and then later on found yourself in a situation that could result in injury or death to you or others should a seizure happen at the wrong time. This is why the military won't accept people with epilepsy.

JOXQrsw0aa	If your primary concern is being a lawyer then you should be aiming for the best chance to gain admission to a top tier law school. It helps to  understand the  extreme  stratification at these schools. Let's take a look at the  degrees held by the Yale Law classes of 2009, 2010 and 2011.  23% of the class holds a  lower degree from Harvard and Yale.<br>  Yale: 82. Harvard: 66<br>  <br>  28% of the class hold degrees from the next ten schools....Stanford: 33 Columbia: 30 Princeton: 24, Brown: 17, Berkeley: 15, Dartmouth: 15, Duke: 11, Williams: 11, Michigan: 11, Penn: 11.<br>  <br>  Of the several thousand accredited colleges and universities in the USA, Yale Law School  awards  50% of its admissions  to the graduates of a dozen. <br>  <br>  Stanford: 33, UCLA: 8, UNC: 3, Illinois: 1, United States Military Academy: 0. <br>  <a href="http://www.yale.edu/bulletin/html/law/students.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.yale.edu/bulletin/html/law/st...</a><br>  <br>  Also helps to understand the grading differences. UCLA is brutal in terms of competition for grades as is going to be the case at any large public university. Stanford in contrast has very lenient grading policies. A class can be dropped practically to the day of the final. It is impossible to fail a class because the grade of F does not exist. There simply is no record the class was ever taken. A high GPA required to gain admission to a top tier law school is much easier to attain at Stanford than at UCLA. <br>  <br>  In the Army 4x as many officers commission through rotc as through West Point. There no longer is the distinction  where the West Point graduate  is a regular officer and the officer who commissioned through  rotc is a reserve officer. <br>  <br>  I am not sure what the West Point 5 year program is, unless you are referring to being  admitted to the academy prep school at Fort Monmouth, New Jersey .<br>  <br>  If you gain admission to Stanford,  they will cover any financial need of  undergraduates:<br>  <a href="http://www.stanford.edu/dept/finaid/undergrad/how/index.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.stanford.edu/dept/finaid/unde...</a><br>  I'd  hold off on rotc till Law School. There are very few sources of funds other than loans to pay for professional school,  and law school has become extremely expensive in recent years, even at public universities for in state students. Berkeley Law( formerly Boalt Hall School of Law) is going to be $40,000 in state tuition next year. rotc, nrotc, nrotc mo pay full tuition. Army rotc has a three year program that could pay for all three years of law school tuition....<br>  Good Description of army rotc:<br>  <a href="http://military.berkeley.edu/army.html" rel="nofollow">http://military.berkeley.edu/army.html</a><br>  nrotc and nrotc mo have two year programs, so all but one year would be covered. This would also keep the active duty time to  4 years. If Law School is not an overriding priority go to West Point. <br>  <br>  Good Luck!
3HBs0pXWaa	indecent exposure in the workplace, sexual harassment maybe|`|6wGkycFAaa	No! It is not legal. Regardless of what the sexual acts are (and masturbation is sexual) the exchange of money makes it prostitution. It makes no difference if those involved physically touch one another or not. It is still solicitation. It is the involvement of money that changes the label.|`|BvZvZaxzaa	Sounds like you guys have fun at work... I'm running some scenarios in my head and as much as I want to say it would be perfectly legal to pay to watch, I wonder what would happen if someone unknowingly picked up an undercover cop and exchanged money just to watch. I think "John" would probably be arrested. Not sure how you could approach this and claim it's for entertainment without coming off as solicitation. I can't wait to see what everyone else thinks about it.

Our soldiers fight for the rights of people having freedom of speech.

Our soldiers are doing our job and they need to be supported. We all shoud be very greatful for everything our soldiers do. Its not easy for them to leave everything. I miss my husband so much, but they have to not only leave their spouse, but their kids, their parents, their friends and basically every single thing that most people take for granted.

75df635938894745156b654c93159941aa	Boiled down to essentials, reserving seats based on race is racist. If they want a seat they can go thru equal process of trying to get elected with everyone else. <br>  Not only is it racist in principle, you also kinda say, "We presume  you cannot get these seats by themselves [because you are incapable] so we subsidize these seats for you", which is not nice.<br>  <br>  But, my personal addition? We (well, you - we did the Siberian people) beat them! If they wanted guaranteed seats in parliament, they shoulda developed more advanced civilization! And now? Tough luck, this is our land, they can cope just like everyone else, and we don't give a damn! :)|`|rgCWPPLmaa	I say HELL YES, and I'm not native, nor is there any native person in my family.|`|k76mr7rKaa	No.<br>  <br>  This is a democratic republic so everyone votes for who they want to fill the seat.|`|AA11209831	Well, since the American Indians migrated here from Asia and wiped out the indigenous people, they probably won't need that many seats.|`|YXGdwwTJaa	Is this question about the Americas?<br>  <br>  I am puzzled as in Britain there are calls for Parliament, and other public arenas to be representative of the population.  This means that the number of seats in the Parliament should reflect the ethnic and gender make-up of the United Kingdom. So about half the MPs should be women and the whole chamber should be made up of various ethnic groups, in the same proportion  as they are in the whole population. Presumably the proportion would change with each election. <br>  <br>   I do not see how this could be done in a democracy, unless candidates chosen for each seat were of the same gender or the same ethnicity, as that would be the only way of ensuring the correct mix.  <br>  <br>  I have not caught up with this interpretation of representation.  BEfore it meant the an MP was elected to represent, that is to put forward the views of all of the constituents, whoever they were; now it seems that the MPs have to look like their constituents.  <br>  <br>  But, as for Native Americans, or other indigenous peoples having  reserved seats, this would be tricky unless they were the only candidates, as above.  <br>  <br>  An alternative would be to give them their own official parliament with powers as of an autonomous state, but within the Union.

LVZdzPmpaa	There are Landlord-Tenant laws in Ohio. Don't let the fact that the landlord is an attorney intimidate you. In fact, he should know better and should be ashamed to have put you in such a predicament.<br>  <br>  There are ways to minimize and eventually eliminate the smell of smoke from a previous smoking tenant. But if the vent systems are connected, you won't ever escape the smoke from the other tenants.<br>  <br>  I know one thing for sure and that is that you have a "right to quiet enjoyment," which means that you have a right to live on the premises without harm or severe inconvenience from the behaviors of othe landlord or other tenants. If the other tenants are stinking up the place and threatening the health status of your son, your right to quiet enjoyment is violated.<br>  <br>  You might also call the building inspector and ask about the shared ventilation system. Also call the housing authority and ask about it there, too.<br>  <br>  See if any of these sites offers any helpful info:<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.tenant.net/Other_Areas/Ohio/tenant_l.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.tenant.net/Other_Areas/Ohio/t...</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.ohiolandlordtenant.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.ohiolandlordtenant.com/</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.hud.gov/local/oh/renting/tenantrights.cfm" rel="nofollow">http://www.hud.gov/local/oh/renting/tena...</a>|`|77b89da50334d58ffae963702c00caaaaa	Go to a bookstore and buy a Landlord/Tenant law book for Ohio.  It will spell out for you what your rights are and how best to proceed.  Just because your landlord is a lawyer does not mean he is instantly out to take advantage of you because he knows the law better but it doesn't mean he isn't either.  Educate yourself.  The air filter he is talking about is the filter in the vent which does not filter out the smoke.  I suggest keeping the air purifier going and if you can, get another one or two.|`|AA12196812	I suspect that there is little you can do, and it is best to cut your losses and lose the deposit. <br>  <br>  A visit to a lawyer is still in order.

Your landlord, the lawyer, should have known that.  The fact that there are vents from a smoker's apartment directly into yours is a known condition that should have been disclosed in the contract.<br>  <br>  In my opinion your lease can be broken on the grounds that you were not informed of a known condition that renders the property unsuitable for your use.  That won't help you too much as far a place to live ... but at least you should not have to honor your contract with the landlord!<br>  <br>  I'm a smoker [my bad, I know the risks and realize that it will probably kill me], but I recognize that some people are very sensitive to smoke!  I rent an apartment, and smoke outside to help minimize the problems others might suffer!  When I travel with family [some of my family has problems with smoke] I usually drive my own (smoker's) car ... no reason to cause others harm for MY bad choice!  <br>  <br>  Your landlord is a lawyer, and probably pretty savvy about real estate law!  You need a lawyer too!  I predict that the landlord will "let you out of your lease willingly" rather than push for a civil trial.<br>  <br>  Good luck!  Hopefully the landlord will be a decent guy and let you out of the lease without too much trouble!|`|TtI7VtTfaa	Move out now.
9a65d9649ac752ad9b4eb1c1b2ab2804aa	It is murder because he was robbing a bank.  If you kill someone in the course of committing, attempting to commit, or fleeing from one of several enumerated felonies (e.g. Burglary, Arson, Robbery, Rape, Kidnapping, or forcible Sodomy) it is murder, even if it is entirely accidental.  This is known as the "Felony Murder Rule."|`|SEPButscaa	Please keep in mind that my experience is limited (mostly) to USA law.  YMMV down under.<br>  <br>  One reason for it to be considered murder is that the death occurred as a result of his actions during the commission of a crime, specifically bank robbery.  Absent the robbery, or any other crime, this would indeed be manslaughter, which is the result of acting with willful disregard for the safety of others without any specific intent.<br>  <br>  In a similar vein, if he had struck a pedestrian with his getaway car, and that person died as a result of those injuries, he would once again be guilty of murder.|`|48cooyKRaa	The killing you describe was committed during the commission of a felony raising it.  Manslaughter by itself would be wanton disregard for human life but without intending to kill.  It is more than an accident.|`|jlgfkyrEaa	The man was in the act of committing a felony with the use of a firearm thereby he knew the dangers and was aware of the possible outcome thereby it is murder. <br>  <br>  Manslaughter would be if an individual was in the bank and not robbing it and fired at the robber and missed and hit an innocent bystander|`|7HKTDcvYaa	If a man fired that gun out on the street, in celebration, and killed someone, we call that stupid careless, manslaughter.<br>  <br>  When he enters a bank armed and discharges the weapon we see that as part of the commission of a crime of robbery, and so is premeditated murder. He knew and planned to fire that weapon as part of  his robbery plan. It was not just a careless stupid act.<br>  <br>  This same thinking is usually applied to any other person present to commit the crime, even though they did not have a gun, and by inference the person without a gun had not planned to fire his non-existent gun as part of the robbery, The unarmed person might not have been aware that the armed person was armed. What we have here is gang thinking that is so dangerous. When we go into a crime with some member of the gang prepared to kill on behalf of the gang, we are implicitly authorizing that person to kill on our behalf if needed. We are implicitly taking the risk that he will do so, intentionally of by accident.|`|BUI2nlUVaa	techinally it's murder.  there's an old story in law school that goes like this.  a husband and wife are fighting in their fourth floor apartment.  the woman pulls a gun on her husband and shoots at him.  at the same time a man jumps from the top of the building passing the the window of the apartment where the couple are fighting.  the bullet misses the husband but goes through the window and hits and kills the man who just jumped from the building.  the woman is arrested for murder and convicted.<br>  <br>  you see, if you fire a loaded weapon the expectation is that the bullet coming out the other end can kill someone.  therefore if you fire and kill someone you have committed second degree murder.  manslaughter is for when your actions may not have killed someone on their surface.  eg a guy, showing off his new hot rod to his buddy races down the street and accidentally hits a kid on a bike killing him.  while the boy is killed the action of racing down a city street isn't, in and of itself, an act that could be reasonably forseen to have killed someone.  therfore this would be considered manslaughter.  now had that same guy hit a kid on a bike two days earlier and been fined for exhibition of speed then the case could be made that he should have forseen that his actions could have killed someone...ie murder.<br>  <br>  this is used all the time for habitual drunk drivers who kill people.  they are convicted of murder whereas a drunk who has never been convicted before strikes and kills someone he could get manslaughter.<br>  <br>  hope that makes sense for you.|`|GFOdY3nBaa	did you read what you wrote??? just the simple fact that he was holding the bank at the gun point is not going to make this death in any  way incidencial!!! how is it a manslaughter? because he claims the shot was "warning"? what the *** is "warning shot" at the bank??? <br>  intent is what will be put up front to get him for a murder. and if the man comes in to hold the bank at the gun point, there is no accidents like "oops", i didnt mean to. it will be murder.|`|kH0IxFa9aa	Everyone above is correct.<br>  Everyone above has said the same thing in a different fashion.<br>  <br>  Now I will say this. It's murder because of the "intent" his purpose of having the gun in the first place......to invoke fear which is kidnapping and the person holding the gun is invoking "risk" of death to the people within.<br>  Danger, fear, high risk.|`|8567eea50ee05006e45298c8a269c261aa	Bill is exactly right.<br>  <br>  Here's one better.

AA11494150	Charges were formally filed against four officers... Theodore Briseno, Laurence Powell, Rolando Solano, and Timothy Wind. Three were acquitted in state court, the jury was hung on Powell. Charges were then filed in federal court against the same four, alleging a violation of King's civil rights. <br>  <br>  Of the four officers, Powell was the only one found guilty in federal court. Also convicted in federal court was Sergeant Stacy Koon. Koon is the one seen with the taser in the video. He was found guilty of failure to act for being in charge of the incident. Both Powell and Koon received 30 months.<br>  <br>  King was awarded $3.8 million, and used it to start a record label, which soon folded. That, along with several other arrests that followed apparently took a large sum of this money.<br>  <br>  Koon is currently a part-time paralegal assistant. Powell enrolled in college after his release, but dropped out before graduating. Briseno was fired from LAPD after his acquittal, and  is currently employed by a private firm as a security officer. Wind was credited with giving one of the most accurate statements about the King incident during the internal investigation. He was also one of the least aggressive of the officers involved, and is seen in the video stepping back and evaluating his blows, consistent with academy training. After the acquittal, he took a job as a community service officer in Culver City, CA.|`|S6XSLvjLaa	They (the police) were acquitted which led to the riots where the truck driver was attacked and beaten.

AA11702773	RJ, way back when, before I knew who Ron Paul was (about a year and a half ago), I thought I might end up voting for Romney who I assumed would win the GOP primary (since 'everyone' hated McCain.)  I thought Romney was a RINO (neocon was not a word that really occurred to me) but was more bound by statements promising conservative action than McCain, so would need to be looking to a conservative base.<br>  <br>  HOWEVER, at CPAC yesterday Romney said some amazing things.  He said he was IN FAVOR of TARP (but the money should have been used better) and I got the feeling he wants MORE bank bailouts (with the money used his way.)  He said 'conservative principles' demand a 'free market, PROPERLY REGULATED', when it is the Federal Reserve, and government that needed regulation to avoid the crisis we are in.  He seemed to be buying the 'more regulation' mindset, if with slightly different tools than the Dems - he would grow the government and intervention into the economy.  <br>  <br>  He also wants mandatory health insurance.<br>  <br>  And was always for military interventionism we can't afford.<br>  <br>  So, to your question, yes, it would be reacting differently, but most differently if Ron Paul had been elected.  I think we are reacting to the uncertainty of what government will do 'to' the market, given that government has determined its whims should control.  There is no market analysis available to predict for investors 'what Pelosi might do next', once she has decided the economy is her doll house to play with.|`|KWa9vPVQaa	No they are true Americans, I think they would have never let our country go to the dogs!!

The government has partially or fully privatized many large companies, banks, and insurers, and has ceded stakes in such leading firms as Air France, France Telecom, Renault, and Thales. It maintains a strong presence in some sectors, particularly power, public transport, and defense industries. The telecommunications sector is gradually being opened to competition. France's leaders remain committed to a capitalism in which they maintain social equity by means of laws, tax policies, and social spending that reduce income disparity and the impact of free markets on public health and welfare.""<br>  <br>  The Venzuela Economy is a better example of a Nation increasing Socialism.<br>  <br>  ""President Hugo CHAVEZ in 2008 continued efforts to increase the government's contol of the economy by nationalizing firms in the cement and steel sectors.

AA10755943	Yes, it is a direct parallel to the Poll Tax.  It imposes an artificial burden on the free exercise of a Right, causing an infringement on that Right and perhaps pricing it out of the reach of some Citizens.<br>  <br>  According to the Constitution, the government cannot infringe, in any way, on our Right to keep and bear Arms (combat firearms).  That means they can't infringe on the supplies necessary to exercise that right, like ammunition.<br>  <br>  Notice how the Communists/Democrats keep using the phrase "sporting purposes" when justifying their new rounds of gun bans? They KNOW BETTER than that.  The preservation of a Free State has nothing to do with hunting ducks and bunnies.

IM30PoPNaa	Mismanagement by the party in power.<br>  <br>  Let me give an example.  There is a financial instrument called a "credit default swap" or CDS.  At the time the economy started to crash in late 2008, there were $62 trillion of CDS in circulation.  Check out <a href="http://www.contrarianprofits.com/articles/beware-the-62-trillion-cds-time-bomb/5574" rel="nofollow">http://www.contrarianprofits.com/article...</a><br>  "$62 Trillion in Credit Default Swaps Is a Ticking Bomb"<br>  <br>  <br>  $62 trillion -- that's about two full years of worldwide gross national product.  It greatly outweighs the value of mortgages in default (and by the way, do you know the number of troubled banks in Canada?  Exactly zero -- Canada never drank the deregulation koolaid.)<br>  <br>  The Bush Administration, in its wisdom, left CDSs completely unregulated.  The Bush Administration, in its wisdom, also passed changes to the bankruptcy laws that said that derivatives contracts are exempt from normal bankruptcy protections.  See <a href="http://www.marginalrevolution.com/marginalrevolution/2008/09/derivates-contr.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.marginalrevolution.com/margin...</a> and <a href="http://demosthenes.blogspot.com/2009/03/derivatives-skip-bankruptcy-courts.html" rel="nofollow">http://demosthenes.blogspot.com/2009/03/...</a><br>  <br>  You were wondering why AIG needs to be fed hundreds of billions of dollars in taxpayer money?  Why AIG and so many Wall Street investment banks are "too big to fail"?<br>  <br>  That's because they're so heavily invested in CDSs that effectively all their assets go directly to CDS counterparties without any bankruptcy protection.  There is no bankruptcy protection for these firms, thanks to the Bush administration.<br>  .|`|b1C3xs3Jaa	1) the national debt<br>  2) the federal budget<br>  3) the FED's below market rate credit<br>  <br>  Add to that, the policy to inflate the currency and throw spending to prevent bursting of inevitable bubbles, causes the bubble to delay but be larger later. This happened right after 911 to prevent this recession then.<br>  <br>  Obama is trying to do the same thing, to delay the bubble from fully busting. <br>  <br>  Allowing a bubble to completely bust, purges the market of the government intervention. So long as the government does not again get involved, things will slowly correct themselves. Remember, recessions are corrections to prices.<br>  <br>  Unfortunately, the national debt, and federal budget, and monetary policy are all guaranteed negative effects on the markets, ensuring future bubbles (distortions in a true supply and demand driven market).|`|YupMCYHlaa	The Bush administration ran the government according to ideology, not pragmatism.  Bush didn't listen to experts, he listened to ideologues.  He doubled the entire pre-existing national debt, which was already frighteningly high.  He fought two unnecessary wars, both of which cost huge amounts without actually doing anything.  He deregulated banks so they could lend money unwisely, and the loans were guaranteed by the taxpayers.  He refused to 'reform' Wall Street when it was clear there was terrible corruption there.  <br>  <br>  There is a theory that Republicans in the Reagan/Bush mold wanted to build up a huge debt deliberately so as to undo the New Deal, to say that we could no longer afford Social Security and Medicare and those kinds of programs that help people.  I don't know if that's true but it's consistent with their actions.|`|e7wD8sUiaa	The downslide started after January 2007. What is so significant about that? That's when the Dummycrats took over CONgress. The economy was relatively strong until then. Some of those "records" aren't the worst since the great depression. The late 1970s and early 1980s were just as bad and in some ways even worse. So in conclusion, while the first SIX years of the Bush administration weren't the best they were a whole lot better than they might have been without the Bush tax cuts. After 9/11 the unemployment rate went up to 6.1%. After the 2003 tax cuts the rate went down under 5% until January 2007 when the Dummycrats took over CONgress. Gas prices went from about $1.50/ gal in January 2001 to about $2.20/gal in January 2007. After January 2007 gas prices shot up to over $4.00/ gal in just 1 1/2 years and the unemployment rate started going up and hasn't stopped. Discretionary spending went up big time under the Dummycrats while mandatory spending has gone up very little.|`|c3be98a378a7f478cc0867a107078db7aa	the election of the pelosi/reid regime in 06 and obama in 08 are the proximate causes.|`|c8b96c428b5adcbe941b94e428a6e7afaa	Democratic Congress last 2 years <br>  now with the Presidency - that's icing on the cake<br>  <br>  goooooiiiiiiiiiinnnnnnnng - DOWN!|`|oTAPazvcaa	Nowhere near as bad as the great depression, not even as bad as the early 80's, or mid 70's.

Gun control is all about control and nothing to do with guns. Our country loves guns a lot because we value them a lot since our individual right to own guns in order to form our militias gave us the ability to fight a tyrannical government. Politicians have power, influence, control, whatever. And what do these kind of people like to have if they know how to get it? More power, influence over people.

I'd be interested to know how you think he would have killed that preacher.<br>  <br>  Making it more difficult to buy guns that kill people is, however, a rational way to reduce the number of people killed by guns. Nations with tight gun laws have, on the whole, less gun violence; countries with somewhat restrictive gun laws have some gun violence; countries with essentially no gun laws have a lot of gun violence...go figure.<br>  <br>  It’s true that in renewing the expired ban on assault weapons we can’t guarantee that someone won’t shoot people with a semi-automatic pistol, and that by controlling semi-automatic pistols we can’t reduce the chances of someone killing people with a rifle. But the point of lawmaking is not to act as precisely as possible, in order to punish the latest crime; it is to act as comprehensively as possible, in order to prevent the next one. Semi-automatic Glocks and Walthers are for killing people.  They are not made for hunting, and it’s not easy to protect yourself with them.

The 50,000 troops remaining in Iraq will constitute training brigades for Iraqi security forces and specialized units involved in improving the infrastructure of Iraq.|`|teKeLxX2aa	Steven almost got it right, in August 2010 they will be reducing the number of military forces in Iraq to 50,000. But it isn't going to be indefinitely, as 'all' military forces are scheduled to leave Iraq by 2012. This is a binding document between the US and Iraqi government, so anything short of a war with Iran it'll probably be carried out.

AA12351814	For now the biological father has the rights to your child if you die.  Until you get his rights taken away he will automatically get custody of the child if something were to happen.|`|fAaLjlI0aa	Basically, the court favors biology over all else, unless there is a reason not to. Not seeing her now is not enough of a reason for them to keep her from him should he decide to fight for her in the event of your death. What you can do is try talking to him about it. Tell him your reasons, that you want the kids to be raised together, and that she'll be loved equally with her sibling. Then, if he is agreeable, you can get the paperwork in order for him to relinquish custody in order to keep her with her brother. If, however, he is not willing to do so, your only option would be trying to force him to give up his parental rights (essentially, having them stripped), which is not very easy to do. Speak to a family law attorney, and then to her father and try to work it out. It's not likely that you will die before she reaches 18, but if you are adamant about this, you need to take care of it now.|`|hRYwuCFRaa	You can shoot for it... Consult a lawyer and put together a will (a living will and another for when you expire). But that's tough one because, quite frankly, that's not his child. Period.<br>  <br>  That said, whatever you put together - the child's father will be able to challenge. So take that into consideration. <br>  <br>  If your son's father is really the better end of the deal, and you two are married, you might want to shoot for having him legally adopt your daughter (at which point you would have no legal right to receive child support). <br>  <br>  At this point though, your son's father HAS NO LEGAL RIGHT to your daughter. Adoption would be the only way to seal that deal and even then, the bloodline parent still has some right to fight for visitation and what not. <br>  <br>  You should really examine your reasons for wanting this. Is it in the CHILD'S best interest and if so, WHY? Why isn't he in your daughter's life now? Are you the reason? Your personal dislike for the man SHOULD NOT be the reason for your decision. <br>  <br>  You can't cancel the other parent because you like someone else better. So, hopefully you have valid reasons for wanting to do this.|`|ZKSwZfLpaa	DISCLAIMER: ANY LEGAL ADVICE YOU GET ON THIS WEBSITE SHOULD NOT BE TAKEN AS ABSOLUTE FACT. ANY DAMAGES INCURRED FROM FOLLOWING ANY OF THESE ANSWERS IS RESULT OF YOUR OWN CONSENT.<br>  <br>  If you have a legal question like this, and yes, it is a legal question, you should talk to a lawyer.  They can help you draft a will that will say exactly what you want to have happen down to the letter and there will be no chance of screwing up.  If you cant afford it, at least buy a 'make your own will' kit from Staples or something, don't ask for advice in a forum like this. Honestly, if they were my kids, I'd make sure they had the best chance at the best life possible, it's worth the extra couple hundred dollars.|`|TtI7VtTfaa	If he's not the biological father the biological father would get custody regardless of what paperwork you signed.|`|GFOdY3nBaa	why? well, because it might seem cruel to you, but bio fathers have rights too besides the child support. to begin with if he pays he should be getting visitations. and he would if he wanted to. <br>  second of all, just because your relationships didnt work out, it doesnt mean he shouldnt fight for his child. there is nothing you can do, unless you get him sign his parential rights and then get your other man legally adopt that child. this is the only way. <br>  to make it shorter, you cant have both, its either child support or different father....

Yet no one is asking about this.Even the so called experts because they know its true and wise of him to do it.That's why so many are complaining,they will no longer make money they did nothing to earn because the government coffers is not the bottomless pit Bush said it was.I am holding the man to oversight,that way less graft although nothing is a hundred %|`|AA10652652	Obama really didn't give you more money.  For instance much of the income the plan calls for comes from cap and trade so you will be paying much more for utilities (and or force rolling blackouts).  Also Obama's plan calls for more debt across the board.  For instance he plans to tax the rich $318 billion over a 10 year plan, but the tax decreases will be over $1 trillion over a 10 year plan.  Obama wants to add over $600 billion over a 10 year plan.  None of that is from Bush.  Obama's plan, negating anything from the Bush era, will still result in more spending that Reagan and both Bushes combined and he'll do it over a 4 year period and not a 20 year period.|`|lvBUl3Zdaa	You are right.

First, you assume that everyone agreed with the debt to begin with. We don't. But you do not go and do MORE OF IT to the detriment of the country.

Most expect the government to do their jobs, how sad.  It is time for the government to let the parents help their kids with homework and learn to feed their kids, make them a sack lunch like we had to if you cannot afford to buy lunch.  We were poor, but had good parents.

35388c245298f734c446f07410c4ec69aa	It's a trial system in which you have two opposing sides (adversaries) each of which prepares and presents its own case.  So in a criminal trial that's the prosecution and the defence.  The judge is independent and is basically just there to decide matters of law and (if there is no jury) to determine the facts from the evidence provided by each side.<br>  <br>  It is often contrasted with the inquisitorial system, in which the judge takes a far more active role.  In a criminal case, for example, an inquisitorial judge will lead the investigation of the crime and prepare a dossier which is then used by the trial judge (which can be the same judge in some places).  In an inquisitorial trial the judge presents evidence and questions witnesses directly.|`|HUrLVofYaa	Our law system is adversarial in that there are opposing sides, much like at a debate.|`|DyRlZFJKaa	I think it means that we arrive at a decision regarding  a charge against any individual or group  (the defendant) by having an attorney for each side - one for defense and one for prosecution - spar with one another using the weapons at their disposal: language arts, legal precedents, logic, etc.  The rules of this combat are known to both attorneys and the Judge. They are adversaries.  This is very like when two warriors would duke it out to resolve a conflict, but attorneys are expected to refrain from physical violence!<br>  And we all agree to accept the outcome  under "Rule of Law" because that is the system we have deemed most likely to help us maintain the peace and preserve our rights.  It is important to remember that the outcomes of this sytem have  very little (if anything) to do with "Truth" or "Justice" - <br>  I hope this helps you to think it through...look up the word adversary in the dictiobnary and that will maybe help.|`|2pr32YNqaa	A replacement for the duel of medieval times which is just as unjust and causes great misery all round. <br>  The legal system has lost credibility due to the number of abuses and miscarriages of justice, at all levels through the system. <br>  Beyond  that, it is very maladjusted and unsuitable for carrying out the highly charged emotional needs of divorcing couples.<br>  How to encourage a nation of people with intense contempt for the law...<br>  get 90% of them into family court, to experience injustice and hatred, powerlessness in the face of authority.

If you don't have demand, you don't provide supply.  No supply, no employees.|`|3MM64geHaa	You are the confused one dear.  I know what 90 percent means do you.

How that work out.|`|11dGXLchaa	In the 1950's, we did not have the Alternative Minimum Tax hanging over our heads.   And, with tax shelters, a 90% tax rate never really meant 90%.    In the 1950's, nobody was paying 90% on all of their income in excess of $400,000.    <br>  <br>  Nowdays, the tax loopholes have been closed and the AMT hangs like a hammer over our heads.    There are still deductions, but one can never truly vary far from the scheduled tax rates.   In other words, the top tax rates in the 1950s were effectively lower than they are today.<br>  <br>  By the way, the tone of your question is needlessly condescending.|`|WL3KcegWaa	Sadly what you leave out is the the maximum tax rate of around 89% was on those that made over $400,000 per year.<br>  <br>  Now ask yourself the next logical question....  how many people made over $400,000 per year in the 1950s????<br>  <br>  <br>  Why is it that liberals can never be completely truthful when presenting an argument?|`|438e26d7b22965d7e9bbd6ed05be2455aa	because the first part of all of this is actually achieving status to have disposable income, and that means you have to earn $$ with a paycheck where the government takes a quick 90% of what you earn.  for those who have already amassed, well, you're right.  they'll find income sources elsewhere.  but families making $250k who wake up to find uncle sam taking 6 of 10 dollars they earn are not going to be able to invest in anything.  it's blatant wealth redistribution and it is indefensibly unfair...and that's coming from a political independent who will never earn anything close to $250k in a year.|`|7c5d1a76836b7ed2ed52eb7c751f6331aa	I would like to understand why you think it's NOT class warfare to target one group to finance the rest of society and our entitlement government.

No one is ENTITLED to a huge portion of your paycheck. Period. The government doesn't grow this crap on trees...if the government is GIVING money out, they TOOK IT from someone else. I realize that you and other capitalism hating people are convinced that the rich are greedy and took us down this road, however, it simply isn't the case. They are who ulitmately, held us up for as long as we have been. And you are talking about paying the employees more to get a tax break? Wow. And you want to claim YOU know about economics. Cute.|`|f4759393d980deadc3255b5837265f76aa	You offer alternatives but only a few.  What about the ability for these same top tax bracket earners to move their investments and companies overseas where costs are lower?<br>  Tax free muni bonds may be a nice alternative for a piece of an investment portfolio but the returns are comparatively low.  One can only expand a given business so far before it becomes a diminishing return and paying employees more only makes sense if productivity increases.  If a business can not make a profit, why go in to business?  I'd guess that 99% of businesses start with the primary objective of making a profit, not employing people.<br>  <br>  Lowering corporate taxes would in theory lower cost of product.  A company will produce what there is a demand for.  If a company can sell the same product for a lower cost, there will likely be an increase in demand.  More demand may mean more employment and greater profits.<br>  <br>  The reason very high taxes are a bad idea is mostly because of competition.  Many countries are lowering tax rates to entice companies move to there.  If a company can get a better deal outside the US, rest assured, that company will do all it can to take advantage of those circumstances.|`|WCkOUF9aaa	Because your argument is BS.<br>  <br>  Why shouldn't you pay more taxes instead of trying to justify taking it from me?<br>  <br>  People that earn more already pay more 35% is PLENTY.

Or do you even pay Federal income taxes?<br>  <br>  Gosh I'm just using common sense. Maybe you should try it too. You think people would stand for 90% taxes?

However, your likelihood of recieving a patent will be very low.  <br>  <br>  No one can buy a patent, except from the owner of the patent.  So if you own an abandoned patent application, then to acquire it, someone would have to go through you.  <br>  <br>  Basically, abandoning the original and filing the exact same application is a bad strategy.  The original application may be used as prior art against your present application.  There may be intervening prior art between when you first filed and when you refiled.  Your own actions may be 102(b) prior art against you.  <br>  <br>  Sounds like you need a patent attorney to help you.

It's only the lemmings who wouldn't trash a brutha for any reason, who are left in support.<br>  <br>  The same thing is happening in Illinois with Roland Burris, Obama's senate replacement.  The citizens want him out because he is a documented liar.   Governor Quinn wants him to resign too, but he refuses.  Now, the black politicians of Illinois are banding together,  threatening the governor with words like "some of us are taking notes" and they are circling the wagons around Burris to keep him in office.<br>  <br>  The blacks in Illinois will step over corpses before they will give up ground they now have.  If Governor Quinn forces a new election to elect a Senator, chances are the blacks will lose the seat.  Their hopes are to keep Burris in office until the next general election, so they can have a candidate of color ready to run.<br>  <br>  I'm all for a new election beforeTombstone Burris can chalk up another pension.  Other than a pleasent personality, Burris has no redeeming political qualities.  He will contribute nothing other than keeping the seat warm, so it only makes sense that he vacate it now.

Even with the stimulus package included we have a deficit of 1.75 trillion. Also, that includes the cost of the wars which GWB creatively hid by funding it outside the budget with emergency funds he asked congress for every 6 months. Also, if you tally up everything GWB spent in 8 years the total is closer to 24 trillion, so the 3 trillion budget isn't that different than GWB's 2.4 trillion annual budgets plus the approximate 800 billion annual emergency funds.|`|teKeLxX2aa	When he declares war on Iran unprovoked without any justification, then he'll be the worst President in history. <br>  <br>  People weren't entirely in agreement with FDR during the Great Depression either, but he must've done something right because America came out of it during his administration (counting Truman). <br>  <br>  Similarly, FDR assumed office in a bad position because of the prior administrations failings. If Obama were to take over for Clinton in 2000, we'd be immensely better off than we are now. With all the wealth we had amassed, if it were going to fund the three fields that tend to benefit society and the world at large the most (education, energy, and healthcare) we would be rivaling the Romans at the height of their empire. <br>  <br>  Take it for what its worth, Bush screwed up big time, and passed all the problems and unfinished conflicts onto the next guy to solve. While people might not be entirely in agreement with Obama's policies at the time (which I'm not entirely either) if things do get better in the near future, people should be willing to acknowledge his contribution. <br>  <br>  All this crap about passing on debt to the future generations is meant to incite fear and anger, in people that know nothing about our current situation. Do you think people really cared about the future generations when they couldn't even afford to eat in the Great Depression?

Might be best these days to stay away from the labels of Rep or Dems, they seem to be melding together and leaning further and further to the left. or as you put it to liberalism.|`|ZxhPwaruaa	dang. very very conservative republican. like i can almost see elephants flying from your avatar.<br>  <br>  you sound like my parents. <br>  not my style but that's okay.|`|OtgOYTHdaa	a very conservative republican.|`|qfkK4S66aa	Ignorant.<br>  <br>  Go learn something.|`|01r8k1iDaa	a very conservative republican.|`|Jx3WSjLwaa	Republican, and clearly not interested in thinking the issues through.  Having the positions you have, in and of themselves, don't make you stupid.  Your explanations, however, are very revealing.<br>  <br>  I'm not going to waste much time with every point, but seriously?!?!?<br>  <br>  Marriage is for procreation? Then why not make that the law?  Does that mean adoption should not be legal unless you first have your own kids?  And really, you think legalizing gay marriage will lead to only gay people getting married and no one else procreating?  Does anyone think that is reasonable thought?  Do you have any idea how far out in left field you are?  That's the kind of rant I expect to hear in the movie 13 monkeys or one who flew over the cuckoo's nest.<br>  <br>  And the Tax thing?  You think you're being taxed because of your college degree(which most of us doubt you have, based on your lack of critical thinking skills).  I know, Paris Hilton's hefty tax bill is just because she's such a hard working American with a prestigious GED, we all marvel at her brilliant decision to be born into the Hilton family.   Having a great leader like Dubya, I can understand why you appreciate a man like that, a self made man, a man from the projects, a man who I can only assume had no father, a poor kid who had to earn everything he ever got.  I can see why you feel such a way.   <br>  <br>  So while we know every wealthy person got that way by simply being smart and working hard, we must ask why they should pay more than you and I?  Take the fella that owns Fedex...  Why should he pay more taxes than me?  Does he and his 672 airplanes use the taxpayer funded airports more than me? Certainly not!  Does his fleet of more than 44,000 vehicles and nearly as many more contract vehicles use the taxpayer funded road any more than little old me?  Certainly not!  How many cops have protected Fedex compared to how many have protected my home? I'm sure it's the same number.  How many times have they sued someone?  how many times have they been sued and used or taxpayer funded court system? surely the same amount as I have.  So you are absolutetly right! I can't think of any reason why a rich person should pay more taxes than I do. It must be that fancy degree they have.|`|Ch9TedMcaa	neoconservative|`|b1C3xs3Jaa	You sound like a neocon republican.<br>  <br>  - You are for more big government expansion (you mention not one thing about cutting spending, just reducing tax income. If you do not explicitly oppose expansion of government, it is exactly what you will get)<br>  <br>  - Since you are not explicitly against reducing the size of government, and you are also against raising taxes, then you are for more national debt and monetary inflation.<br>  <br>  - You support a unwinable war, and I can assume you also support all 800+ of our military bases around the world - the reason the CIA explained to us, for 911.<br>  <br>  - You support preemptive wars, this is very unconservative if you look at history. Wars do nothing but drag down the economy, and expand the size and power of government.<br>  <br>  - If you support militarism abroad, you support it here at home - our foreign policy is mirrored here at home since the two are so closely tied together.<br>  <br>  - You care about what adults do in their bedrooms - something which has nothing to do with you. You wish to regulate adults private activities which create no victims.<br>  <br>  Most of these things are supported by neocon democrats and neocon republicans. It is the issue of gays that differentiates you from the neocon democrats.|`|v0PY0UDAaa	I think if you seriously have to ask this question, you don't understand a thing about politics.|`|u9g2Cl6Eaa	You sound like a Conservative Republican to me.<br>  <br>  But why not take the test and find out?|`|f4Yec6iNaa	Hardcore Republican, except for the pulling out of Iraq thing.|`|E9XL5x3Paa	Republican.  I would have said Conservative, but you want to stay in the Iraq War.  Conservatives only want National DEFENSE, not attack for personal vendettas and lust for oil.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  As far as your beliefs.<br>  <br>  1)  More or less I agree with you.  But this issue is far more complicated then you just tried to make it seem.  I am against abortion, but the Republican plan to stop abortion will actually make things worse.  If you'd like, I can email you as to how (or anyone else who requests it).<br>  <br>  <br>  2)  No one is getting forced to get gay-married.  Everyone will not be gay-married, because we aren't all gay.  All gay people are asking for is that we let them live their lives; not that we live their lives.<br>  <br>  <br>  3)  I agree.  But this is a fight that is irrelevant, because what Obama is doing is not Universal Health Care.  That is just something Republicans are saying to scare people away from Obama's ideas.<br>  <br>  Obama is only making the government a competitor in the health insurance market; not forcing people to take the plan.  On top of that, the government is focusing only on those "customers" who can't actually afford to be customers of the health insurance companies.  So its not even really a competition, because the health insurance companies can't really afford to cover those poorer individuals anyway.<br>  <br>  <br>  4)  If we don't pull out now, we will go bankrupt.  Then we lose both wars, and this country.  Truth be told, I don't think we should stay in Afghanistan.  I believe it is a just war, but it is also an expensive war.  We need to pull our economy back in line first, before we try to finish either of those jobs.  To do otherwise could serve to mean we don't finish either war.<br>  <br>  <br>  5)  The wealthy only get wealthy by selling to the Lower and Middle Classes.  Incidentally, the Lower and Middle Classes have no money at the moment; hence the reason for the economic slowdown.  <br>  <br>  They don't deserve to be forced to it, and they shouldn't have to give up their money if they don't want to.  I agree.  But if they don't give up some of their money to the Middle and Lower Classes, their businesses will collapse from lack of customers with money.  Then everyone is screwed.  The Middle and Lower Classes lose their jobs, and the Upper Class loses its businesses and main sources of money.|`|xd7tSmQeaa	I  would say Conservative.  <br>  <br>  To make it easier:<br>  <br>  Love America - Conservative<br>  <br>  Hate America - Liberal|`|81Iglngeaa	you share some conservative views, but we cant tell if your a hard core republican or conservative just from these few things|`|ViEgekyIaa	Conservative.

Take away rights from everyone you don't like. You don't seem to mind taking away a womans right to her own body but when it comes to actual born human beings they can essentially f-off and die unless they are rich. <br>  <br>  There are groups in Iraq already fighting for the freedom of Iraq, they would not have too exist if the U.S. wasn't occupying and destroying their country, some might call them terrorists but they are not Iraqis nor do they understand quite what it means to be occupied by another country without consent.<br>  Honestly if another country came and occupied the U.S. would not stand up and defend it? Or lets say I go and occupy your house and start destroying it what would you do?<br>  <br>  Honestly a woman's body is her own body and she may do with it what  she chooses. If a gay person wants to get married that is their choice. If someone needs healthcare they should have it and it should be decent and universal for all people. The U.S. government should not be in Iraq or Afghanistan unless they as a people/nation decide that they want us there. Furthermore taxes should increase for the rich if you make more money then someone else then taxes should go up for you. Lets say someone makes $30,000 a year and has too pay $3,000 in taxes and then some makes $300,000 a year why should they pay the same as someone who makes considerably less. They should pay more no matter how hard they work (though many do not work so hard compared to the average factory worker or janitor or something like that or just don't work hard at all and inherit money or use bad business practices and scams to get money) but I guess it should be proportionate up too a certain point then it just goes extra high if you are filthy stinkin' rich.|`|knOdcrDkaa	Well let's see:<br>  <br>  *you think being pregnant turns a woman into a second class citizen<br>  <br>  *you think being gay makes someone a second-class citizen.<br>  <br>  *you're unfamiliar with Medicare, the VA, and the government healthcare given to every member of congress, as well as the benefits of having the largest risk pool possible.<br>  <br>  *you'd have us compound our mistake in Iraq and allow our mistake in Afghanistan to fester.<br>  <br>  *and last but not least, you believe that society should be tilted in favor of the wealthy and against everyone else.<br>  <br>  I'd say you're a hard right-winger.

fAaLjlI0aa	Loss prevention officers do not wear store uniforms. Apparently they had reason to believe your brother shop lifted. They DO, contrary to what Mona Lisa thinks, have the right to detain suspected shoplifters long enough to confirm or invalidate those suspicions and/or call the police. You can try suing, but then you'd be out a lot of money and wouldn't get a dime from Wal-Mart. Your best bet is to shop elsewhere. The reality of the situation is, no matter how unjust it may feel to you, suing won't accomplish anything but taking money out of your wallet.|`|7HKTDcvYaa	It is standard practice to speak to anyone suspected of stealing, and to try to get them to produce the item they think you have stolen. As long as they do not lay hands on you, they have not committed an act of kidnapping. They do have a right to speak to you, and if that is the extent of what they did, I would advise against trying to sue, but for a different reason.<br>  <br>  If these people go into court and assert that they saw the boy secrete anything on his person, the defense would appear to be that he did not have it on him. But two witnesses saying you did so gives them grounds to suspect. Even if he spotted these guys watching him and ditched the stolen property the court is  likely to suspect him and refuse to reward him for ditching the package.|`|H7SQEM4Daa	Well,did your brother have a package of pencils on him that he did not pay for?

Other than that, I just write a report, have the complainant sign a few forms and that's it.<br>  <br>  Now if I get behind a vehicle and run the tag and it comes back stolen, I'm going to get backup, stop the vehicle, and conduct a felony takedown.|`|angW1Lkfaa	They have so m any cars stolen they take a report and file it and the car goes on the hot list.

OHfZFR31aa	You have to be qualified to work and hold a work permit BEFORE you move to the UK. <br>  <br>  You either need to be sponsored by a UK company before arriving (the company has to prove that there is no EU citizen who can fill the job), you have to be transferred over by a company you have been working for in the US for at least 12 months and are in a management position, or you have at least an MA and a salary around $70K that would allow you to qualify for the Tier 1 Highly Skilled Visa that is not company-sponsored.<br>  <br>  But at the moment, I wouldn't even think of moving to the UK. The economy is in much worse shape than the US with higher unemployment. There are currently 2.3 million unemployed and this is expected to rise to at least 3 million by the end of the year.

ayii2TKWaa	Two factors tend to make expunging a record take more time.  First, it depends largely on your jurisdiction.  Some jurisdictions have fairly streamlined procedures.<br>  <br>  Second, it will be dependent on the charges, and how many you have.<br>  <br>  The delay (after your paperwork is in) is typically the time it takes for all the computer data to be physically expunged by computer entry specialists.  Depending, again on jurisdictions, it may be that a backlog will slow it down... and some places have a schedule of times when such matters are routinely entered into their systems.  <br>  <br>  Anything that your jurisdiction allows you to participate in during this process can speed it up.  If you are able to hand-carry records to various jurisdictions (in case you have multiple charges or jurisdictions) then that might speed things up.<br>  <br>  Hope this helps.

pEDavW3caa	George Washington is said to be the first but some people said that there was a guy before him but he didn't do anything important.|`|Zf5gSpKnaa	GW|`|PnPVoakoaa	George Washington (February 22, 1732[1][2][3] – December 14, 1799) led the Continental Army to victory over the Kingdom of Great Britain in the American Revolutionary War (1775–1783) and served as the first President of the United States of America (1789–1797).[4]<br>  <br>  The Continental Congress appointed Washington commander-in-chief of the American revolutionary forces in 1775. The following year, he forced the British out of Boston, lost New York City, and crossed the Delaware River in New Jersey, defeating the surprised enemy units later that year. As a result of his strategy, Revolutionary forces captured the two main British combat armies at Saratoga and Yorktown. Negotiating with Congress, the colonial states, and French allies, he held together a tenuous army and a fragile nation amid the threats of disintegration and failure. Following the end of the war in 1783, Washington returned to private life and retired to his plantation at Mount Vernon, prompting an incredulous King George III to state, "If he does that, he will be the greatest man in the world."[5][6]<br>  <br>  He presided over the Philadelphia Convention that drafted the United States Constitution in 1787 because of general dissatisfaction with the Articles of Confederation. Washington became President of the United States in 1789 and established many of the customs and usages of the new government's executive department. He sought to create a nation capable of surviving in a world torn asunder by war between Britain and France. His unilateral Proclamation of Neutrality of 1793 provided a basis for avoiding any involvement in foreign conflicts. He supported plans to build a strong central government by funding the national debt, implementing an effective tax system, and creating a national bank. Washington avoided the temptation of war and began a decade of peace with Britain via the Jay Treaty in 1795; he used his prestige to get it ratified over intense opposition from the Jeffersonians. Although never officially joining the Federalist Party, he supported its programs and was its inspirational leader. Washington's farewell address was a primer on republican virtue and a stern warning against partisanship, sectionalism, and involvement in foreign wars.<br>  <br>  Washington is seen as a symbol of the United States and republicanism in practice.[7] His devotion to civic virtue made him an exemplary figure among early American politicians.[7][8]<br>  <br>  Washington was awarded the very first Congressional Gold Medal with the Thanks of Congress.[9]<br>  <br>  Washington died in 1799, and the funeral oration delivered by Henry Lee stated that of all Americans, he was "first in war, first in peace, and first in the hearts of his countrymen."[10] Washington has been consistently ranked by scholars as one of the greatest U.S. Presidents.|`|AoxkInedaa	ZOMG George Washington|`|qQxRDl59aa	George Washington|`|a9szL0S3aa	i am.|`|AA12300995	Pretty easy, George Washington, the guy in the $1 bills|`|Hf8DlmLqaa	George Washington..... why didn't you know this?|`|p2RzO7rxaa	George Washington

What we actually have here in the U.S. is anarchy: people pretty much pick and choose which laws they obey. This one cheats on his taxes, that one speeds in traffic, another one smokes dope or whatever - even the government officials seem to think they're "above the law." It's not working so well. Maybe if people were self-governing, anarchism would succeed, but when you consider how many people are ill-informed or just plain stupid, plus the pathological criminals and the mentally handicapped, we really need some kind of external controls. On a commune, you can hand-pick the other members, but where do the throwaways go? Does anarchism work for them?<br>  <br>  For example, the U.S. Constitution is a marvel that incorporates much of humankind's collective experience in government and civics over many centuries, and in theory, offers guidelines for establishing good government. Again, the people we entrust to execute it must have good character and the best intentions. Know any leaders like that? Then you need citizens who respond to their example. I guess I've grown cynical over the years, but it seems like people just aren't up to the task of living in peace and harmony. Sorry.|`|QqxrVVnlaa	I became a socialist at an early age and believed in the (old) Labour Party and reformism. However, as I got older I realised that we could never reform into a socialist society because the state itself is bourgeois to the core. <br>  <br>  I became a revolutionary, left the Labour Party and looked around for a party that reflected my ideas. I opposed Stalinism and Soviet Russia as I saw it as an oppressive regime so didn't join the Communist Party.<br>  <br>  Eventually I came across the Socialist Workers Party, (SWP), who are a Trotskyist party.<br>  <br>  The older I get the more certain I become that the only solution to war, famine, poverty and inequality is workers revolution.<br>  <br>  As for your college and university lecturers, you have to question their original commitment to the cause. They probably wax lyrical about their rebellious days while sitting in their ivory towers, enjoying their middle class life styles, and earning the big money.<br>  <br>  Socialism is the politics of the working class and whilst it can be useful at times to have these middle class intellectuals hanging around with us, it's the proletariat that will change the world...not the theoretical socialists!<br>  <br>  Edit: What Anarchists don't realise is that if you don't have the rule of the majority then you have the rule of the minority.<br>  <br>  Capitalism is anarchy in practise!<br>  <br>  PS. Trotsky was a hero. The anarchists tried to screw things up. Just look at Krondstat!<br>  <br>  Anarcho, when the battles are on the street I'll stand shoulder to shoulder with you but I will never be an anarchist. I believe absolutely in the dictatorship of the proletariat. I don't wish to appear rude but, with the defeat of the Russian revolution, the chance for workers power disappeared and therefore so did the chance of the state withering away. Also, I will never agree with your analysis of Trotsky.<br>  <br>  Having said that, lets support each other on here and show solidarity against the capitalists and fascists. We can argue other stuff after workers are in the saddle. OK?|`|6e6fb50d87f07492879715e4526ac64daa	here's what i've learned. <br>  <br>  most kids who are college age are still in their rebellious phase. they love the idea of "sticking it to the man" and thumbing their nose at authority and bad mouthing their country and all the typical behaviors of your average rebellious anarchist or communist.<br>  <br>  when i was that age, i also believed the concept that the rich are oppressing the poor and that they should be forced to hand over their extra money and etc.<br>  <br>  but once they graduate, here's what happens. <br>  <br>  they'll get a job, buy a home, get married, have kids, and realize that the real world is tough. they soon realize that things like food, clothing, shampoo, toothpaste, toilet paper, diapers, electric bills, gas bills, car payments, mortgages,and etc cost money. <br>  <br>  they'll spend years working their tail off just to get by and sooner or later, won't be able to tolerate it anymore. so they'll work harder for a promotion or go back to school to get a better education to obtain a better paying job. <br>  <br>  once they get that promotion or better paying job, their life becomes easier and more comfortable. by then, they're well into their 30's or 40's and will resent some 18 yr old know nothing college punk telling THEM to hand over their money to help out the poor.<br>  <br>  and around and around it goes.|`|fRCoMzXkaa	I saw very few communists or anarchists while in college.

I was previously an authoritarian socialist but the spanish civil war really got it into my head how the real socialist revolution was partly destroyed by the stalinists (who claimed they represented the workers) when infact the represented a small elite who were using communism to gain priviledge and power. <br>  <br>  I am against all forms of unreasonable hierarchy and am a firm believer in equality for all and real democracy, not the current farse which we call democracy.<br>  <br>  I think anarchism should be practised by everyone. I believe that the powers that be deliberately rubbish anarchism as unachievable when in fact it is the most natural way to live out our lifes. They see it as a threat (british warships were stationed off barcelona during the anarchist take over of that city-to crush any successful revolution).<br>  <br>  I would say I am more an anarcho syndicalist, as I see unions as a great way to gain power for anarchists. It happened in some parts of spain during the spanish civil war and I believe it can happen again. <br>  <br>  About teenagers, they are usually more open minded about things than 'adults' who have usually closed their minds and believe in the brain washing used by the status quo.<br>  <br>  p.s-Trotsky was just as worse as stalin. He destroyed opposition to the bolsheviks wen he was in favour. He helped destroy the workers councils and soviets and the anarchist movement in russia.<br>  <br>  To wolfie- I don't like your attack on anarchists. Me and you are pretty similar the only difference is you want a dictatorship of the proletariat and i dont. Give me an example of when the state has withered away?- the former ussr,cuba,china? No it has kept an iron grip on power. Anarchism would not mean anarchy, it would just mean a reorganisation of society were unnecessary hierarchy is abolished and equality is practised, instead of centralising power we would let autonomy and workers councils flourish.<br>  <br>  I don't mean to argue with you but to say what we have now is anarchism is not right. I and many ppl like me want the workers to actually be calling the shots, not some centralised elite who dont like dissent even if it has reason behind it. Have you read homage to catalonia?<br>  <br>  The Kronstadt rising of 1921 represented the last major upsurge of working class resistance to the by then Bolshevik dictatorship!<br>  <br>  The ironic thing about trotsky was that he was a counter-revolutionary murderous leader who got killed by a counter-revolutionary murderous assassin. Taste of his own medicine.<br>  <br>  Wolfie join us. We need people like you on our side.<br>  <br>  I would never say never wolfie. I support you on most issues that you bring up on here. I will fight the fascists with you, but im worried if the dictatorship of the proletariat comes to power here will they liquidate the anarchists afterwards like what happened in Russia, would you just watch and allow this to happen if the dictatorship said we were counter revolutionaries?|`|GG7WjH6Raa	I prefer neutral, open mind|`|VIhj7ghUaa	In my hippie days and for years after that, I favored communism.

If she is pregnant or has a very young child, perhaps she has a "pass" right now?<br>  Is she disabled?  <br>  In California, Welfare will help her to finish her degree and start a career.  But I know that there is a "lifetime benefit" that means she will run out of time to be on welfare.  At least in this state.<br>  She is very young to have so many children to care for and if she is not married to the "boy friend" she could find her life "going south" very fast!<br>  My suggestion: keep communication open, tell her you think she is making a mistake IF she asks your opinion, and never, ever give her money.  Let her figure it out on her own - otherwise you run the risk of becoming a meal-ticket for her and for the boyfriend!
DyRlZFJKaa	The answer is NO they cannot just take away a baby from the mother, unless you are shown to be unfit (take drugs and alcohol, abuse the baby, homeless, etc).<br>  The father is going to have to pay child support - you did not get pregnant by yourself - and that is probably what he is afraid of.  He has the right to visitation with the child and you can force him to get into parenting classes if he takes you to court for any reason.<br>  Court mediators see this sort of thing all the time - it is reasonable for you to insist he take parenting classes.<br>  The child support he pays belongs to the child (not to you) and is for the care of the child.  Visitation is also for the benefit of the child - because people need to know where they come from and the child has the right to have contact with both parents.<br>  You should get a job if you can, any job - and also apply for help from welfare, including medicaid and food stamps.<br>  Right now you need good prenatal care, as soon as possible!<br>  Your grandma cannot support you and your baby.  It would be wrong to ask her to do that.  Start paying your grandma some rent and find some sort of job - at least until you have to stop work for a few weeks when the baby comes.  <br>  And please, find out how you can get back into school, maybe a local junior college or a GED program if you did not finish high school.<br>  There is a lot of help out there and you have an opportunity to become an asset to yourself, your child and your community.<br>  Get some counseling as soon as you can: raising a child is a major commitment and you need help to make good decisions.  You are very young, but you can do what needs to be done.|`|ClKxHUJpaa	Even if you didn't have any money the state couldn't take your baby away.

rpDvbBkAaa	No and there is more to it.<br>  The concept of secularism is a conspiracy against the people of religious India.<br>  The belief that religion should not be involved in the organisaion of society,<br>  Education etc., is secularism. While the religious character of India was ignored<br>  in case of Hindus, in cases of Buddhists, Sikhs, Christians, Muslims, and Parsis,<br>  the term ‘ religious minorities’ is applied. This is the conspiracy part of Indian Secularism. Recognizing the essentials of life for the religious majority became anti-secularism, and favoring the religious minorities became secularism. If secularism should thus mean counting the numbers of religious groups, an honest approach will be<br>  to count the numbers of every religious group, without going by the factor of alien religion or native religion. In the name of secularism, people following alien religions are united under the banner ‘minority’ and people following native religion are divided under the banner of ‘reservation’. Hence, provisions of both ‘Minority Status’ and‘Reservation’<br>  becomes anti-secularism. For native Tamils, others are Aryans, having come through Kaiber and Polan. So, treat all north-Indians as alien religious group and bring them under minority-banner. If Brahmins only are Aryans having come from outside, then<br>  bring them under minority category. If Brahmins are less in number but they were occupying more positions, so also Buddhists, Christians and Muslims were our rulers in the past and they thus become rulers and do not apply minority status for them. If reason for ‘reservation’ is suppression by upper castes of lower castes in the past several centuries, bring all Hindus under reservation class because, Hindus were also suppressed in the more recent times by Muslim and Christian rulers. The reason for the tireless but unsuccessful attempt of the Indian polity to stage-manage a casteless society is only to hide the injustices of provision of minority status and reservations. For determining ‘minority’ status, castes are overlooked; for provision of reservation castes are taken into account. This is the hypocrisy of Indian polity and it is a sheer conspiracy.|`|ZZ32oTfwaa	No,certainly not.But our political leaders have spoiled everything just only for the sake of their vote bank.As a common man,I can say that common man has nothing to do with all these wasted propaganda.May good sense prevail to our politician.They are just trying to create differences among the people.|`|vCvsXbOCaa	In india so called secularist Parties' secular means exactly what you said"Anti Hindu and always appeasing muslims!" actually this is what  pseudo secularism.|`|GllB4mPZaa	We r being ruled by "Feroz Khan Gandhi" family.

If they obtain a judgment, (you do not go to court and they win by default) it will be good for seven years and can be extended for another years. <br>  <br>  State laws protect you from getting fired or from being denied a job, just because a garnishment of wages order is filed.<br>  <br>  Under your situation I would tell them to go to hell. There are statute of limitations for debt collections (with some exceptions like child support, taxes and student loans)  If sufficient time passes three to four years in most states, they cannot collect, unless they already acquire a judgment, in which case it is good for longer. If your situation improves, you can always pay them, if you want.<br>  <br>  Additional Comments: There is no defense if the debt is legitimate and time for collections has not expired. You can always file for bankruptcy if you have debts you cannot pay.

One example of such a thing is the "National Arbitration Forum".  These outfits should not - in any way - be confused with or compared to a court of law.  They are nothing but shams, and will turn your $4000 debt into closer to a $10,000 "arbitration ruling" (which they may call a "judgment" - even though it is NOT a legally binding court judgment).<br>  <br>  Review the wording of the document you were sent.  Also, review the disclosure section (the fine print) of your original "Discover Card" credit agreement.  Specifically look for any reference to "arbitration", "binding arbitration", "third-party arbitrator" or any similar wording.  My bet is that they will not be taking you to court (because it would cost them money up front in filing fees), and will use the "sham" arbitration process instead (because it costs them nothing and they add in thousands of dollars of "adminstrative" and so-called "legal" fees which are summarily awarded to them by an arbitrator who is on their payroll).<br>  <br>  There are strict federal laws regarding what may and what may not be levied; what funds may and may not be garnished, and what debt collection practices are - and are not - allowed.<br>  <br>  Just because you don't have anything right now, don't count on that being the case forever.  And they will wait you out - while doing all they can to make life a living hell for you in the meantime.<br>  <br>  Don't give them the satisfaction of winning.  Reply to them and a businesslike manner.  Do not go into detail with them.  Do not consider them to be living, breathing human beings.  But do keep it respectful and businesslike.<br>  <br>  KEEP A RECORD OF EVERYTHING.  You will need your documentation later.  What you must do now is build a case so that you can have any ruling against you nullified.  The only way you will be able to do that is to beat them at their own game (it's not that tough).<br>  <br>  If, after they rule against you, they attempt to file a "writ" in court (the only thing that legally allows them to garnish wages, place a judgment against you, levy property, etc.) you will be notified by the court and have a short time to reply.  That is when you must show that they did not act legally, ethically, and in a neutral fashion (trust me, they won't).<br>  <br>  This isn't going to go away.  It's up to you to take them on.  And win.

EWQncHVlaa	People who were in the Royal Navy did not get their pay stopped when their ship sank, but men who were T124 reserve that is men who wore navy uniform and came under the articles of war but were classed as merchant seamen still had their pay stopped when their ship sunk. The T124 men were seamen who required no naval training as they had been seamen in the merchant navy. The best known example of that was the men who went over to DUNKIRK with their own small boats they were asked to sign the articles of war as they would be under the control of the Royal Navy for the duration of the rescue from the beaches and were given orders and instructions by Royal Naval personnel. The least known were the men of HMRT His Majesties Rescue Tugs these were the men who maned rescue tugs all over the world, the Americans called them Fleet Tenders and they have an Association called NAFTS, in Britain they are called The Deep Sea Rescue Tugs Association. It was these brave men who took part in the convoys sometimes stopping there ship to pick up survivors, they also towed the Mulberry Harbours over to Normandy on the 6th JUNE 1944 to get a floating harbour so that food and supplies could be delivered for the troops fighting on the beaches.

CZlUhRfkaa	I believe they can come onto your "open" property to obtain the property they are looking for.  By "open" I mean your unfenced yard, driveway, etc.  They cannot, however, enter any part of your structure without your permission.  That would be breaking in, which is illegal.  From what you described, they are now harrassing or even stalking you and that is a criminal offense.  I would once again call the police explaining the situation.  Try to get the name and number of the business they are with (maybe listed on the side of the tow truck) and contact them or provide the police with that information and have them do it.  If you have contact with the previous tenent, either call them and tell them to take care of it or give the information to the repo company.  The middle of the night is when repo companies typically do business because there is a pretty good guarantee the vehicle in question will be at the home address and the persons at the house will be asleep therefore the repo persons have little chance of getting into a confrontation with anyone.  Most do not look glamorous so it is normal to be afraid of these people.  Maybe next time they come banging on your door, have the police on the phone with you and talk to them.  Everything will be recorded via the phone call and if you tell them to go away and they don't or come into your house anyway, etc., Police will hear the crime and respond promptly.  <br>  In slight defense of the repo guys/gals the information given to them by the company the vehicle lein is through is all they have to go by.  They are completing a job at someone else's request.  That's how they get paid.  They hear all the time the information you are informing them of, but most are lying.  They don't know that you aren't.  They are definately crossing the line though in your instance.  Like I said, file harrassment or stalking charges on them.

They are not allowed to break in garages, locked fence etc. if they do you could press charges "breaking and entering" if there coming by tell them to leave, if they don't you can press charges "trespassing or harassment" call the police when they come and harass you. and the police CANT let them take your car unless they have a court order witch they don't because you haven't been to court for that .|`|30R7gIXtaa	it isn't illegal , but they have no right to do it<br>  get a court order telling to stay away <br>  or call the police tell the are thieves trying to break in<br>  a few interviews with the police they wont be so keen<br>  <br>  oh mention you think they have a gun<br>  we want them on the ground with a police mans foot on their necks<br>  <br>  screw the doors shut<br>  photograph it so if you find the car gone and the door broken you can prove they broke in<br>  <br>   stuff them|`|Ovj9hjMPaa	When you default on a loan your creditor CAN come and get the car at any time of the day or night, AND go on to your property to do so.<br>  <br>  BUT,  taking a car from a closed garage, use of or threat of force could constitute a "breach of peace", so depending on the situation they may have been in the wrong.  Did they actually open your garage and take the car?  <br>  <br>  Was any damage done?  If so you can probably at very least get compensation for any damage done.  <br>  <br>  Eventually of course they could just get a sheriff to come down and make you open the garage, if you still have the vehicle.  <br>  <br>  If they did break in more or less, threaten force, or do any damage, I'd talk to a lawyer.|`|0Y0XuneKaa	no, they can't.  the actions you describe are tortious and possibly criminal depending on where you live.  if you don't own a gun already, buy one, and when a stranger bangs on your door in the wee hours, open it with the gun (loaded) pointing at him and advise him to leave at once and not return if he values his life.|`|ClKxHUJpaa	I would call the cops.  Without a warrant, nobody can force their way into your property.|`|jlgfkyrEaa	No, They must notify the sheriffs department before going out to reposes a vehicle. They are not allowed to harass the other tenants or the owners for this matter. <br>  <br>  The repo people work for a bank or a financial institution so my suggestion is get ahold of the bank and let them know that you are being harassed by their asset recovery team (repossession people) and let them also know that your former tenant has moved and that you would appreciate that they no longer come to your house. If they continue call the police and press charges of trespassing.<br>  <br>  You may also go after the bank for monetary damages due to their harassment|`|AA10672774	No.
1VaH8D3Raa	Because the government has got to have a lot of money to<br>  .<br>  Spend on all kinds of important things .<br>  .<br>  Like saving the world<br>  .<br>  Giving all kinds of money to nations that hate our guts<br>  .<br>  And always in the prep room of war some where on the planet<br>  .<br>  America is the only country on the planet that does stupid things with its money<br>  .|`|EhoJ9mgsaa	Because if you make it free then the quality would go DOWN fast.<br>  <br>  The idea of sending everyone to college seems like a nice idea <br>  <br>  BUT<br>  <br>  What if the kids you're sending to college aren't prepared to do college work?? Do you lower to standards to make it "fair"??|`|b8e7225eb1b9214f4836b0310368ade6aa	Nothing is every "free", and probably should not be. When the government provides something for "Free", it really means that it is free to you, and somebody else picked up the tab. I paid for my college alone by working 2-3 jobs, no loans, no grants, nothing. That experience taught me just as much as my classroom experience in terms of education and how to make it in the world. People need to take responsibility to make themselves aware, and to do what it takes to make their own way in the world. If you constantly "give" things to people, they tend not to appreciate it's true value and abuse it. This is not to say you go totally Darwin and let them sink or swim. Just make sure the artificial obstacles are removed and leave it up to them.|`|SkWzsnuxaa	Nothing free is ever appreciated. But that aside why do you think that education is provided by or should be provided by the government? What country are you living in that you believe this? If you are an American I suggest you read the Constitution and then ask not why education isn't free, but why so much is paid for by the government. After all it is your money.|`|1lCUPVAkaa	Nothing is free, the working class tax payers, are the ones who pay.<br>  Not everyone is college material, yet I do believe those that are need <br>  more help with higher paying scholarships, other then for sports, Sports seem to already get big time scholarships.|`|VuaOKpYXaa	Because the universities do not use their multi-billion dollar endowments built completely tax free to educate their students.|`|3Sr2FgRfaa	Nothing is free, and college is not a service provided by the government but rather one provided by private or charitable agencies. I'm betting that your taxes are not high enough to pay for your education! If you are truly seeking to "better the lives," there are a thousand programs out there that will help you pay off your loans, from high-needs teaching to Job Corps to the military. (Yes, the military betters lives -- who was first on scene in the Indonesian Tsunami? The US Navy and their hospital ships.)<br>  <br>  Why do you have to get a college education to get a job, anyway? You'll make tons more money today as a plumber, auto mechanic, or appliance repair person than you will as a journalist, a stockbroker, or college professor. I have an English degree and it never did crap for me. I started making money when I figured out it wasn't the degree, it was the attitude. You want education free, go educate yourself at Free-ed.net and Project Gutenberg. The education you pay for isn't about knowledge -- the knowledge is already out there. It is, rather, about connections and being spoon-fed knowledge. Oh, and getting a piece of paper that is usually pretty much meaningless.<br>  <br>  Sorry about the rant. I've just answered this question one too many times.|`|Bu4XeFVPaa	OMG...you understand that "it is a service provided by the government"....dude, no it isn't...NO IT ISN'T. Everything can not be free, and nothing is free...at the end of the day someone has to pay.<br>  <br>  I am really tired of paying for all the shi* that other people have.  Really really tired.|`|23XMpx4zaa	I live in Australia and there education is very much encouraged by the government financially for students..   Pop down for a visit!|`|3lur9XHOaa	Define "we" when you state "we pay taxes" because currently those that don't get charged with taxes are the only ones that the government believes should get free education.|`|jVUEohsNaa	gimme, gimme, gimme<br>  <br>  You liberals just want to live in my damn wallet!  STOP IT!<br>  <br>  NOBAMA!
