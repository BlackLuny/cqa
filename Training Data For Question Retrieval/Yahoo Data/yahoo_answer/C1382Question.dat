20090305084002AAOjVPA	Social Science;Psychology	Group university project where they're really unprepared and i've been made to do all the work. what do i do?!?	We have to do a presentation of a poster we need to make (3 of us including me). It's due in a in 5 days and for the last 3 weeks they've been ignoring my suggestions to meet (we're the last group to). Finally met today after saying we would come with journal articles so it won't take as long. Neither of them did so they spent 3 hours doing that while i was left with nothing so ended up having to start on the poster. I've done over 3 quarters of the poster now (theoretical work/ implications/discussion/results). Than they left early and told me to email it to them so we can all add on our own research (they have 2/3 each, i brought 6)!!! I've only written 3 of the results up. What should i do!?! This count towards my degree. We have to give each other peer assessment but them two are good friends and will give each other excellent whilst i'm going to give them all 1's (out of 5's). But still they out number me so it won't make a difference. Seems a bit childish to tell my tutor (even though i'm tempted to). What would you do?? Maybe i'll tell them to the rest of mine up since i've done all the other stuff (my work will take them about 5 sentences)? I know the other 2 but not good friends, i can avoid them easily

20090305055331AAznwOp	Social Science;Psychology	Emotional loyalty? Emotional passive aggressiveness?	Doesn't matter what the issue, even when I know I am in the right and it is crystal clear to the world at large, my so called boyfriend will always play devils advocate and stand up for the other person/side if an issue arises.  Drives me crazy.  There's a woman in the neighborhood that is notorious for her selfish ways.  I pick up her children for school each morning (along with my own) .  I went today and waited, like I have done every day of the year (snow, rain, etc) and finally figured out that they weren't there.  She had decided to drive them today I guess.  That's her option of course--  but not so much as a phonecall to me to let me know.  So I passed her on own side street in our vehicles and I slowed down to talk to her, and she drove fast right on by.  It was intentional.  So I told my bf who always says she's a ******, unless of course it's me complaining.  So I tell him and he  says "well maybe she wanted to teach you a lesson that if you say you will pick her kids up at 8:00 than she means 8 sharp."  I said I'm doing her a FAVOR by picking up her kids each day, no charge, just a neighborly good thing to do.  They have never been late, always greeted warmly and dropped off with a smile.  Why would she feel she had the right or need to "teach me a lesson?".  My bf then started on his long stupid rampage about "understanding the other person"... I just blew up at him saying you don't even understand ME nevermind HER what the f-- For ONCE I'd like him to just  stand by me on ANYTHING and not always challenge me.   I am from a very loyal have your back,  stand by your friends family background.  We speak to eachother honestly but in the end we stand together. I don't expect my bf to do anything about the mother or get involved but in the privacy of my own kitchen I'd like some understanding.  He consistantly puts me on the stand for cross examination.  I want an emotionally loyal man.  Not one that will agree with me ALL the time, but one that will at least be supportive when I am just looking for some encouragement or comfort.  One that will not blame me for things he clearly KNOWS are not my fault.  I think it's a passive aggressive way of putting me down.  What do you think?

20090305052011AAjFDqb	Social Science;Psychology	Do people cope with the problem of alcoholism in families by making it a normal thing to be?	I asked whether I was right to think a neighbour is a bad person because she encouraged another neighbour to drink who has two young children.  The police got involved, her marriage broke up and she lost the children.  The answers I got mostly thought I was being judgemental and wrong.  One even said we're not responsible for each others actions.  I tend to feel the answers were because it's a problem with alcohol rather than some other drug.  Alcohol is so accepted in our society we've normalised the problem it's creating.

20090305053007AAeYGhC	Social Science;Dream Interpretation	Please help this dream I had  when I was younger has always  bothered me!!!?	when I was in the fourth grade I had this dream I was in a house walking around...then I stopped into a room that had a clawed foot bathtub. The house was rather old with vines growing all over the walls. Cracks in the floors..The bathtub was filled with water so for some reason I got in it. After that I switched to a different dream. I was in my grandmothers living room "where I was currently sleeping at the time" and there were Indians surrounding me. I didn't know what was going on "I'm still dreaming" I thought I was actually awake even though I wasn't...A cheif was standing in front of other Indians. The cheif told me that I had betrayed my people. I had no idea what he was talking about. The Indian cheif said that I was being punished and that he wasn't going to let me wake up. I had a series of strange dreams after that. The strange thing is is that later on that day I woke up waaaay later on in the after noon. I'm currently a high school student and I still remember that dream perfectly. I'm 25 % Cherokee and creek Indian. My mother has always denied being native american. Could my dream have somthng to do with that. Well to this day both my mother and I are always having dreams about Indians and native americans. I would greatly appreciate it if you could help me out with opinions thanks! :]

20090305051008AAC731B	Social Science;Dream Interpretation	Weird nightmare what does it mean plse?	Ive had it twice in the last two months.    I'll describe it but first I will add:   I have no unresolved issues with the past   Nothing in my dream has any link with reality   It seems like a lot of BS but when Im dreaming it I get scared because its like its real      I dream that I'm at college and living at home and I ask my mother where my grandfather is, she just shrugs and says she doesnt know I go upstairs and find him lyingdead in the attic and it looks like hes been redecorating it and just dropped dead. It crosses my mind that my mother might have known but doesnt care (she ever cared about us kids when we were growing up), then I remember that it's just a dream and my granfather's been dead for years then I see him and he says well done but I get s**t scared and wake up with a jump.      I don;t know y Im dreamin this    My grandfather died peacefully in bed in real life long time ago   My mother's not a problem, I cut ties with her a long time ago and never thinkabout her any more   But I have had health problems   I am sorting finance and making plans to start my own business soon   And I am good at DIY etc like my grandfather recently I finished a big project and I thought, he would have been proud??Could be a link?   When I thought about it and played it back in my mind to try and make it change the story I found myself wanting to yell at my mother (me as I was then,) and say all the things I used to wish I could say but never had the guts to - but I dont know y because I have no thoughts or emotin towards her at all and she belongs in my past and I have a lot to look forward to as Im building a future and have a busy life - so I don't understand y this dream would come not once but twice.   Any ideas plse    thanks

20090305072801AAKVGCe	Social Science;Psychology	How can you work with someone who's slow?	By slow I mean that:   - she doesn't make connections by herself. If you explain a process stage by stage, she gets it and can repeat it, but if one element changes she can't figure out how to solve it, even when she has all the information she needs.   - she has a bad memory. I hear a bit too often things like "I've never heard about that before" even if I told or gave her something a day before. It's frustrating.   - she lacks intuition. I can guess what people want/mean, even if they don't express themselves clearly. She can't do that. If I intervene she gets upset.   - she doesn't understand irony/sarcasm. I feel bad when she takes things literally.      We work together. The first couple of months I didn't mind explaining stuff and repeating it. Now, I'm getting annoyed, especially since she used a few times my ideas to look good in front of people, she tells MY stories when I am in the room as if I weren't there (I don't wanna hear someone else saying how I've met my fiance, it's weird!), she doesn't like to work with customers and I think she starts to envy/dislike me.

Women don't actually like sex as an act but they like to be intimate with the one they love. Or they do it for other reasons: to get love, money, popularity etc. I do know that the female sexuality (if it exists) isn't half as strong as men's sexualities. They don't get orgasms and I guess they fake it most of the time. Since women have no sexuality, should they be virgins until they get married? What do you think?

20090305062651AAqlVGc	Social Science;Psychology	Why do girls say "Boys Lie"?	Girls say "Boys Lie" all the time, they even wear T-shirts about it.      I'm 27, and I've been teaching both elementary and middle school for 5 years, and I have to say "GIRLS LIE".      Girls LIE since they are 5 years old. They are experts at it, it's second nature to them. I can see how good they are to lie, and they NEVER feel any remorse about telling a lie. It's only when they get caught they feel bad, but they feel bad they got caught, they don't feel bad for the LIE. Girls since they are little, they try and find ways to lie even after they got caught, they are great actors, and they can lie to you with a straight face.      Boys are not natural born liars like girls are. Boys have a real hard time telling a lie with a straight face. You always know when a boy is telling a lie simply because they feel bad about when they do. Boys always stop telling a lie, and confess after they get caught.      Girls are natural born liars, you only need to work with children to see that.      The reason girls say "Boys Lie" IS because GIRLS LIE !      Can any girls out there prove me wrong without telling a lie?

But why does it seem like alot of people from other countries think they know how life is in the US when some of them have only been here on a visit to a tourist town and some have never been here at all?  Do they just believe everything they see on tv?  Do they think that every US city is like Los Angeles or New York?  Ive seen all the Harry Potter movies but I dont assume there is really a school of magic somewhere in the UK.  Your thoughts?

(im 16. he's 15. she's about to be 18.)   he's met her about three times. his grandma gave her his cell phone number and has been texting him for the past two weeks. our county rodeo and fair is this weekend and she asked him to go with her only if i wouldnt be mad. i told him over and over to do what he wants to. i want him to be happy. so he decided to go. (he's going in 2 days)   last night i had a dream that we were on the bus going to school when i looked in front of me and he was sitting with my friend ashlee. they were dating! something happened and everything got white for a second and when the color and everything came back, he was gone and she was running off the bus. that day they had skipped school.      (he told me that he just wants to go to the fair with her just to get to know her and if he doesnt like her as a person, he's not gonna go out with her. he said that if he gets to know her and he likes her as a person, he's gonna think about asking her out.)         i dont know what to do;i still want to be with him really badly and he knows that. he wants to be with me too but he just wants to take a break.          what does my dream mean?

20090305060730AALJliB	Social Science;Gender & Women's Studies	Do you think guy would hate it if women ask them out on the second date ? Why dont more women do it ?	If the first date was a good first date and he paid it's only fair for the women to ask the man out on the second date and pay. Reciprocate please      But I keep hearing this rule "whoever ask pays" and that sounds fair for good friends and business assoiates BUT im thinkin to myself how often do women ask a man out, really ? If were going to stick 2 old fashion rules in a more equal world how does that rule workout more equally ?      It seem to me that "whoever ask pays" is really " the guy always or mostly pay" because women rarely ask and women use lame excuse like "back in the 50's men were suppose that court women" but guess what it's 2009 and its okay for women to ask men out, I dare say most women these days are CHEAPOS . So yeah the "whoever ask pay" rule is BS....in dating and relationship.       So guys make it clear that you expect her to pay on the second date cause quite frankly she has a job 2, she doesnt have to bust her budget to take a man out (picnic,fishing), and if she is really into you she WILL ACCEPT if she doesnt she is a waste of your time.      Ladies trust me on this most guys think "If I dont pay for this date I wont get la&$". That is a big reason why guys refuse women paying the date also they think they are going in the friend zone ...all you got to do is push his money away give him a sexy kiss say sumtin sexy and he will loosen up...trust that.       What do you think about this ?

This and the dream actually happened to my husbands he was wondering about what it meant ...      My husband went to hang out with his mom and she went to buy a lot of shoes and he got mad at her for wasting her money and they got in a bit of a argument and she dismissed him. They ended up driving to a abandoned house and his mom started taking things he told her not to but she did anyway and so he started to.       ***Now for the interesting part***      They got back to his parents house and his younger brother (18) comes out and start and cussing at his mom to come to him and that she doesn't love him, and his brother keeps repeating you don't love me ... (the younger brother has been doing alot of illegal things latelty and their mom acts like nothing has happened since thats her baby). So my husband goes over there and beats his brother up and their mom is telling him to stop, thats my baby boy.  After he is done hitting him he  gets on a motorized water cooler and tries to leave. My mom calls and tells him she will come from Arizona and come get him and she supports his decision. His aunt popped in somewhere and supported his decision because his brother has been running a muck.      Then at about 7:00 this morning he woke up and looked to see a dark figure standing over him looking down at him .... he was startled and closed his eyes shook his head and opened them again to see a figure kneeling and praying by him ....       what does any of this mean??

20090227053141AAFVCqJ	Social Science;Dream Interpretation	What are your thoughts of this dream I had?	I was in a wooden cabin. It was filled with arcade game stations and people were playing them and there was a pool table in the middle of the room.      I saw my husband run his hand over a girls stomach before giving her a cuddle and kissing her forhead (something he often does to me).      Then I was standing at the bottom of our bed. He told me that he had slept with my cousin who used to share a house with me, 4 of my best friend and then told me he kissed my closest friend. To which she had told me (in the dream) 'don't worry we were only snogging... there was only a bit of under the shirt action'      I was then at the end of the road where I live and he was in the car, driving away, and got out to speak to me and I leaned in and took the handbrake off and let the car roll into traffic. We argued and he left. Then I woke up.      Sounds silly but I was really upset when I woke up. My husband and I have a really good realtionship. My friends featured in the dream are not in my life anymore due to them seriously stabbing me in the back....      I would love to hear your thoughts! Thanks :)

However, there is a lot of awareness about the violence perpetuated by men against women, but no one bats an eyelash when a woman hits a man. I know that some would argue that it's different, since for the most part, women are physically weaker than men. However, shouldn't the same principle apply in this case? After all, violence is violence.

20090305091403AAnnTuJ	Social Science;Psychology	Do you think a person's family history and genetics effects the way they act later in life?	For example, such as the way that person is with others. They act and say one thing, yet they do another. I've often wondered why some people are like that. I'm sure we've all known someone like that but it still baffles my mind but I think it has to do with their family and such. Another example might be if your parents never married and then as you get to be an adult you say that you yourself do not want to marry anyone which from the outside seems like for no reason, but inside you may feel that since your parents didnt then there is no need for you to do so. I think our family and genetics effects our lives more then we probably know.
20090305090047AAfxlVG	Social Science;Sociology	I don't like being social?	I don't know why. Humans just bother me. Its been like this for a while. (3 years) I wondered if its some sort of disorder.      It never became an issue. For example, I had some problems a while back. I mean, suicide was on my mind constantly. but the thought of sitting down and doing a little caring and sharing with a fellow human just irritated me. So I did a little research, and dealt with the issue myself, so people can't really say I need friends to help me through life, I'm doing good so far.      Its not like I hate people, I just don't care. Meaning I don't give a sh*t if someones rich or poor, happy or sad, etc. Lets say I am sitting at home doing nothing, bored, and I get a phone call from someone inviting me to see a movie, I'd rather keep sitting at home being bored.      Any thoughts? Is this a disorder?      (PS. I don't mind me being like this, I actually enjoy my lifestyle)

20090305075244AAgLH29	Social Science;Gender & Women's Studies	Are women more "oppressed" than men?	(inspired by feminecrom)      Everyone has been oppressed all through history by the small wealthy ruling class that held all the power. Men as well as women. But that fact is conveniently overlooked.      Oppress in times past meant "to work primarily as homemaker, chef, and clothier, as the husband engaged in back-breaking labour beneath the scorching sun".

I guess I thought NYC was it for me.  I've got about five more months here, since I am moving to Madison in August.  Some days I feel great about it--free.

Would love some words of wisdom from other people who have gone through a big move. Thanks.
20090305091522AA4tuLW	Social Science;Gender & Women's Studies	Do you think this is true when it comes to the way we raise boys and girls?  Why?	It's already known that boys and girls are raised similarly but we know that girls receive a lot more supervision and rules than boys do.  It's common in most families that have children of different gender.        However, let's turn to punishment and disicipline.  It seems like families are a lot more tough on boys than girls when it comes to punishing a wrong action.  Generally speaking, when a girl does something wrong, she may get a slap on the wrist or a lesser punishment than boys do, but when boys do something wrong, all hell breaks loose in the punishment department.  Why is that?  And do you agree? Why or why not? I know everyone's experiences are different, but we tend to socially believe these things.      Thanks for reading.

I have no idea what I want to do with my life though. I have considered architect, interior designer, biochemical researcher, forensic scientist (LOVED the course i took on it), doctor, veternarian, computer specialist...

Im just really confused and wish i knew more about what i wanted to do in life so i dont waste $50,000 a year at this private college I am attending.

20090305090840AA801aM	Social Science;Dream Interpretation	WEIRD DREAM!!! What does this mean?	Ok, so I've had this crush on this girl for the longest time. We have been hanging out a lot lately, just the two of us, one-on-one. I have been trying to bring up the subject of "us" for the past couple of weeks but have failed miserably to do it. However, this Friday, I told myself I am going to do it, no matter what! Yay me! Haha      Anyways, now that you have my background, on to the dream itself. So basically, the dream started out with her, for whatever reason, coming to my house. We ended up going up to my room and she was just sitting in my chair. Gradually we got closer and before I knew it, I was holding her from behind and we were holding hands. It was nice. Then it just got really weird.      So like I said, we were holding hands and I was behind her. However, I noticed that she was wearing a very low top and naturally as a guy who is attracted to her, I looked and actually saw her bare breasts for about a second or so before she covered them up. However, this is not even the weirdest part. So anyways, the next thing I know, we were on the bed (not doing anything sexually). We were just talking when all of a sudden she decided to get on top of my back. She started to walk all over it and at first, it was fine, it didn't hurt and I told her, "Okay, that's enough. Get off!" But she wouldn't. It was really started to hurt, like really badly. I told her this and she still wouldn't get off. So now I am starting to hear like the bones in my spine breaking and now I'm getting scared. I tried to remove her feet off my back with my hands but I couldn't. I was freaking out when I finally woke up and now I am here, telling complete strangers about my dream. Haha.      WHAT DO YOU GUYS THINK THIS MEANS??? HELP ME OUT! Thanks! :)

20090305092409AAQ5Xyw	Social Science;Dream Interpretation	I have dreamt this dream three times and so I would like to know what does it mean.Thanks?	Please,to anyone who has the intention of answering my question,please answer it seriously since I'm taking it very seriously.         I had dreamt of being in a castle..,a very old castle hidden abandoned and I had a key...there were few (like 2 probably) people (who I don't remember who they are) by my side and then there were other people that were trying to get inside this castle.For a certain reason I didn't want them to get it.So,I was pratically fighting with these people.Even,if I had the key they still managed to get in.Once I remember one got in by getting in from the window.It was as if,there was something in the catsle that I didn't wanted them to find and I was fighting with all my heart to stop them for reaching to it.The other persons that were on my side helped me too.I remember in the last dream,I was on a vechile.I wasn't the driver but I was on it.It took me to this hiddebn antique place,and there I met the intruders..and I was fighting again.         PS.I don't know any material art and I'm the type of avoiding fighting as much as I can
20090305095946AAqCe7b	Social Science;Gender & Women's Studies	Is porn an outlier of society?	By this I mean are the women who have done porn so far the only women who would do such things (have sex with anyone just to appease a social trade)? - And do normal women not operate in the same way albeit to a different degree? (as to say normal women aren't even swayed by the same attraction that the women who went to porn were/ So the fundamental applications that interested women to the degree where they would subjugate themselves to do porn don't even slightly interest the rest of 'normal' women)  ?
20090305093753AANkV86	Social Science;Gender & Women's Studies	Why do WOMEN say they want  a good MAN, when they tend to seek out destructive and unhealthy  relationships ?	Isnt that hypocrisy.  Oh girl,  I want a good man so bad.  They are hard   to find these days and time.  Oh hey,  you know that guy Josh.  He   and I are talking right now.  The other day he said something though,   that kinda scared me. I was creeping out,  he told me he was sorry though.  He says he loves me, so I guess I was just overreacting like   he said.  I can't believe he did almost hit me,  but he said he was just   playing.  He is such a great guy,  I felt guilty for doubting his love.      Did you hear that ladies ?  She feels guilty for hurting him,  when in   turn all he wants to do is hurt her.  Now what kind of a man is   that.  Destructive relationships.  You have to mature or you are going to   keep getting the same old,  same old.  It will not change,  and neither   will he.  What do you think ladies...............................

20090305092327AAecYDO	Social Science;Dream Interpretation	Dream: organ-keepers.?	Last night I dreamt I was one of several custodians of a large, cathedral-type organ, and had in my keeping a golden u-shaped tube and valve. The set-up was stable, until a new custodian appeared. He was small but very strong (he was cartoon-like, and reminded me of Mighty Mouse), and very very fast. He wasn't ill-intentioned, but he was trying to do everyone's jobs, and rushing from one thing to another, disrupting the whole system. I was taxed (along with my superior) with the task of slowing him down.
20090305094656AAaISv4	Social Science;Psychology	Have you been through a midlife crisis?	If so, how did you weather it and how did things end up?  What hope can you offer?      My husband and I are on the younger side of midlife and are approaching forty.  Our life is objectively "good" but not necessarily where we wanted to "end up" for example if it were another rung on the ladder of life it wouldn't be so scary.  We are both feeling that "is this it?  Is this all there is?  Is this as good as it is going to get?" with respect to our lives.  It isn't that we aren't grateful for what we have, etc. and it isn't that we don't feel love and happiness toward certain people like our little son.  It is just that we feel like we just can't fit anything else in and we are immobilized from really taking anything else on that would be of interest.  Feeling like it is too late to change careers (and we are strapped because of the economy) and really feeling trapped.        Anyhow, I'm not sure if this makes sense.  If it does maybe someone could offer some advice.
