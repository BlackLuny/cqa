20060618084807AAoGcLp	Computers & Internet;Internet	Where did my icons go?!?	I have Internet Explorer 7. Whenever I add a new website to my favourites or the quick links bar, it usually comes up with the web page's address bar icon. For example, if I was putting the CNN website onto my favourites the red CNN logo would appear to the left of the title. But I find after several days the logos dissappear and it only shows the default internet explorer link logo (the white page with the blue e)       I find this so annoying because the logos make it alot easier to navigate, and point out a particular website. Anyone know how to fix this?      (By the way, I had the same problem in internet explorer 6, and 7beta)

20060804211831AAe1Bc2	Computers & Internet;Internet	I'm 24, should I feel outdated for not knowing as much about computers?	When I was 13 in 1995, I was the only guy school with internet at home. At the time, everyone thought I knew so much because I knew how to surf the web, create websites, and I began buying from ebay when it started when everyone was still affraid of buying on-line. I began a business buying laptops on ebay, fix minor flaws and selling them. Overtime, I made a lot of computer geek friends. But during college, I studied business, and my friends studied computer science. I'm still considered computer savvy by other people, I  make money selling on-line, and I'm great managing with accounting and warehousing software because of my work. My friends, on the other hand, know everything about programming and networking, it sucks. I only know how to talk about making money and selling  online, and they only know to talk about computer stuff I don't even understand.      Should I feel stupid for not keeping up like the rest of my friends?

Dentro de un par de dias se vence un dominio .com.ar que me interesa (lo consulte en www.nic.ar, y se que vence antes del 25 de agosto) por lo que quedaria libre, y quiero saber si hay alguna forma de usar ese dominio para redireccionar a una página de cualquier servidor.      Para que se entienda, quiero algo exactamente igual a lo que ofrece www.dot.TK pero con .com.ar      Gracias de antemano.
