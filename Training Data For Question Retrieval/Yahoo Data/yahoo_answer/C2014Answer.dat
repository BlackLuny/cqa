HFuI8oVYaa	Depends on the charger. Look at the label on the charger. If it covers 100V to 240V, then it will work in any country. All you need is a plug adapter. <br>  <a href="http://easygoing.com/index.asp?PageAction=Custom&ID=1" rel="nofollow">http://easygoing.com/index.asp?PageActio...</a> <br>  If your camera uses AA batteries, take along a few non-rechargeable batteries.

Your trip to India is one of those special occasions where you don't want to miss those great shots.<br>  <br>  If your charger doesn't cover voltages above 130V, then you will need a converter. A small ** transformer ** based converter is recommended.

HFuI8oVYaa	For $50 or less, you won't get a good camera.<br>  <br>  That said, Kodak made a disposable film camera that took panoramic shots. That will be under $50 with processing. I don't know if they still make that camera. Check your local drug store.<br>  <br>  You can use any digital camera with modern stitching programs to make a panorama. I will suggest Hugin as it is free and works very well.<br>  <a href="http://hugin.sourceforge.net/" rel="nofollow">http://hugin.sourceforge.net/</a>
HFuI8oVYaa	That's the nature of Point & shoot cameras - lots of shutter lag. You can reduce this if you prefocus and set the exposure before taking the actual shot. This is done by depressing the shutter release button half way and holding it there - making the camera focus and determine exposure before you actually take the shot. When you depress the shutter release button all the way the camera will capture the image with a big improvement in shutter lag. I use this technique all the time, even on my dSLR.<br>  <br>  If you want a camera with minimal shutter lag, you need to step up to a dSLR type camera. They still have lag, but it isn't noticeable unless it starts to focus hunt. dSLR cameras also focus much quicker than P&S cameras. dSLR cameras also do well in continuous shooting modes allowing you to take 100 consecutive shots if you so desire (P&S cameras will allow 5 to 10 consecutive shots). The camera will readjust itself between shots, but it isn't noticeable unless your subject distance changes a lot.|`|fRE5u5p8aa	i do not know your budget but digital camera's hand held will tend to do that, pretty much all of them have a shutter lag and blurry zoom.  I would suggest a digital SLR, the xsi is a good beginner one for under 800 dollars and you can set it up so pretty much it will be point and click camera, with not shutter lag what so ever and depending on the lens size you will have unbelievably clear zoom. 
eVptHOOBaa	Do you need just buzz words, or the actual meanings?<br>  <br>  Ok, here are the buzz words, let me know if you want more explanations:<br>  <br>  First, don't mix depth of field and aperture in the same bullet. They are different beasts. depth of field depends on aperture, but not just on aperture. It also depends on focal length and distance to subject. So you can use it as separate bullet to demonstrate how it can be controlled in SLR.<br>  <br>  <br>  focus is good one - manual vs automatic. Multiple focusing zones, pre-focus, continuous focus vs. single focus.<br>  <br>  iso - you got it.<br>  <br>  shutter speed - yep, got that. Slow vs. fast.<br>  <br>  Other buzz words you missed:<br>  - Focal length (as mentioned above) and lens interchangeability (buzz words: bayonet mount, zoom lens, prime lens, fast lens vs. slow lens, image stabilization)<br>  <br>  <br>  Then we've got external lightning use. Buzz words here: strobe, flash, Hot shoe, PC-cord, slow sync (first curtain, second curtain), TTL and dedicated flashes vs. Automatic or manual, Guide number, etc. Flash sync speed, remote flash triggers and so on.<br>  <br>  Well, I don't think this list is exhaustive, but will give you some material to work with...<br>  <br>  LEM.|`|Ao3Fl3iSaa	what is "proper exposure" and what can affect the meter<br>  different types of metering<br>  <br>  |`|HFuI8oVYaa	You didn't state your target audience.

The D40 doesn't have a focus motor in the body. If you don't mind shooting in manual mode, you can use older Nikon lenses.

HFuI8oVYaa	Jewelery is difficult to photograph because of highlights. Do a search on the web on this subject. There are a few sites that give good tips. My favorite is using a plastic gallon milk jug as a diffuser. <br>  <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/photo/essays/vanRiper/020809.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/pho...</a><br>  <br>  You can also use baffles to take out highlights. Hold up dark cards to eliminate the highlights (blocks the light that causes the highlight).<br>  <br>  If the glare can't be controlled with lighting and various angles, you can try a dulling spray. It wipes off. This is good for product photography with shiny metal bits. <br>  <a href="http://www.calumetphoto.com/item/BR1115/" rel="nofollow">http://www.calumetphoto.com/item/BR1115/</a><br>  <br>  Last resort is to use HDRI techniques. This is a lot of work for something that can be controlled by proper lighting.<br>  <a href="http://www.tawbaware.com/tufuse.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.tawbaware.com/tufuse.htm</a><br>  <a href="http://hugin.sourceforge.net/" rel="nofollow">http://hugin.sourceforge.net/</a>  <br>  align_image_stack.exe and enfuse.exe from the Hugin set of tools are good combination of tools for HDRI.<br>  <br>  The lowest ISO setting is what you want to use as this will give you the cleanest image quality (least amount of noise). Set the white balance to your light source or use a custom white balance setting. Sounds like you have the basics in hand, it's now a matter of fiddling with the lighting setup.|`|vkzkXWfzaa	The problem with jewelry (or anything shiny) is solved by using a light tent such as this one on eBay<br>  <br>  <a href="http://cgi.ebay.co.uk/PHOTO-PHOTOGRAPHY-..." rel="nofollow">http://cgi.ebay.co.uk/PHOTO-PHOTOGRAPHY-...</a><br>  <br>  There are a number on eBay, browse to select the size you need, or you can make your own out of a large cardboard box. Muslin works well as a diffuser, some types of nylon actually radiate UV when its stimulated and can cause problems.<br>  <br>  The easiest way is with an off camera flash or two on the outside of the tent, but you can simply use a couple of anglepoise type lamps with the colour balance corrected, you can calibrate colour balance in camera (check your manual).<br>  <br>  As for camera settings nothing special is required just Aperture Priority and select a small aperture for depth of field. Basically its just a macro shot.<br>  <br>  If you go the anglepoise route shutter times will be long as there is not much light available so a tripod is necessary, with flash you can hand hold though even here a tripod makes life easier.<br>  <br>  Chris
aPYmvYImaa	its probly the music track, its deffo not the ear phones
n71t0xoCaa	OK here is my short answer. I have a D40 and I love it. The D40 has a full manual mode, Flexible progam, aperature priority, shutter priority modes. These are the same modes on all DSLR.  It also has several other programed modes for things like portrait, night, children etc. As a photographer improves and learnds to use metering better these additional modes seldom get used so they are usually found on the more amature cameras and seen as not needed on the professional cameras. I feel I have a fair amount of experience as a photographer and it performs well for me but I can give it to my 12 y/o grandson if set on program and he can get good usable pictures as well. His photography is improving as he is already learning to use many of the functions himself ( yes I'm a proud granpa) . <br>  <br>  I also would not get caught up in the megapixel hype and instead look at the entire sensor issue. Look at the article I linked below The D40 will do everything a beginner to intermediate photographer needs at a great price. It comes with an 18-55 lens. It will let you use any other money to buy more accessories. And by the time you outgrow it cameras will have advanced to the point that most of what is on the market now would be obsolete. I bought a D300 last year and only had a it a few months when the D700 came out. The canon would also serve you well but I am a Nikon person so I suggest them. I have friends that are very happy with thier canon's and take great photos. You will have others that like Pentax and Olympus and they are not bad cameras but if they were in the same ballpark you would see many more professional photographers use them <br>  <br>  Now for the longer answer as you already have some experience I will be preaching to the choir on a good bit of this. <br>  <br>  I would say the Nikon D40 Its an entry level DSLR. A digital SLR will give you a much larger sensor than any point and shoot camera. Larger sensor = more light to each pixel = clearer, crisper photo with better color saturation. DSLR will also let you grow and take more control as you learn more and you can change lenses when you have a need to. The sensor on the olympus is smaller than on Nikon or Canon<br>  <br>  I am a nikon person and have had nikons since the 70's I personally think the nikon D40 give you more for the dollar than any DSLR today. There are some that do more but you pay a good bit more. Do not let the lower megapixels concern you if you do not do very very large prints you will never notice the lower DSLR. My brother recently needs a DSLR for a class and I recommended the D40 to him So I would also say get the D40 not the D40X. The Nikon D40 does not have limited functions compared with other entry DSLR. Yes it has fewer funtioncas than a 1500 dollar camera body would. It is not a a cut down version its equal or above most any entry level DSLR.<br>  <br>  <br>  There is a great article in this months Digital Photopro Magazine that is titled "Megapixels how much is enough" EVERYONE  looking at buying a new digital camera can profit by reading this article. Its here <br>  <a href="http://www.digitalphotopro.com/studio/megapixels-how-much-is-enough.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.digitalphotopro.com/studio/me...</a><br>  <br>  I have a d300 and a d40 and when I am shooting for fun I grab the d40. Its weightless, a joy to use and gives good results<br>  <br>  If you have a bit more money the D60 give you a number of things you want. It has newer firmware and image processors, designed for the 10 mp sensor. It has an "Active Dust Reduction System with Airflow Control ". Nikon not putting a system on the D40 to deal with dust is one of the biggest drawbacks I see to the D40 ( though I think its still a great camera for the money) If you change lenses dust will get in and the camera needs a system to deal with it. With the D60 you get a VR lens. That will help with low light situations ( they may offer that now with the D40 but originally it was not) . The D60 has Adaptive Dynamic Range. Nikon calls it "Active D-Lighting," it lets you save some highlights that my otherwise be lost. It has a newer better metering system than the D40. So you can get the D40 not the D40 x and spend the other money on lenses or a flash <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  Some people will want to make a big issue out of the fact that there are some nikon lenses that will not autofocus on these cameras. Right now there are "only" about 39 lenses that autofocus on these cameras. They cover the range of focal lengths. I doubt any photographer would be seriously limited with "only" this many lenses to choose from. If you want to manually focus you can more than double this and do so at a low cost. Manual focusing is easy and how we did things for decades before the advent of autofocus.<br>  <br>  Cannon and Nikon chose to put the vibration reduction in the lens rather than the body. Somefolks put it in the camera and make of that. Yes that means you get stabilization only on lenses with that feature built in. In the body in theory it would work on every lens. But in fact image stbilization in the lens has proved to work faster and smoother with a lower impact on focus times than image stabilization in the body/ One problem with in body stabilization comes from the fact that the sensor would have to move different amounts for different focal lengths. A canon white paper says an in body system would have to move the sensor 1/4 inch to account for movement on a 300 mm lens. <br>  <br>  Now a comment on liveview. Have you ever tried to hold several pounds of digital camera and lens steady at arms length while you look at an LCD screen. It not at all the same as holding a few ounces of point and shoot camera steady in the same position. One of the things we preach to new photogrpahers is to learn to hold the camera properly so the body mechanics give you a steady shot. You can't really do that looking at the LCD. So liveview is really something that will have very limited applications in a DSLR. So liveview is really something that will have very limited applications in a DSLR. Usually only when its on a tripod. I have liveview on my D300 and have never used it. <br>  <br>  Nikon also has great service. I was just reading the other day on eyefetch in the Nikon forum where someone posted that they had dropped thier lens and broken it. It was not a fault of the company they messed up. The sent it to Nikon and Nikon could not fix it. Nikon offered them a brand new identical lens at half the price. They did not have to<br>  <br>  In closing all major camera manufactures make good cameras get out and compare the features and how they feel in your hand. Go to places like kenRockwell.com and DPreview.com to compare them. Nikon and Canon have the largest market share and I personally think there is a very good reason they do. Not bashing other brands but photographers tend to be very very demanding folks and they then tend to be loyal to what has worked for them well and consistently. That is not a pavlovian response anymore than it is a pavlovian response in my work at the fire department when I trust the brands of turnout gear and airpacks that have worked for me time and time again. Sometimes even going beyond the published specs. People in ANY demanding profession gain loyalty and trust from thier experiences. And if the product did not perform it would not be favored for long.|`|0AqkCOWIaa	Hey Cortney<br>  <br>  I have the Nikon d40, and here's some pros and cons, that i can randomly think of this camera:<br>  <br>  Pros:<br>  <br>  - It's size, very small, only a little larger than a bridge Point and shoot<br>  - The convenience of inter-changeable lenses at an affordable price<br>  - It's price- It's only five hundred and fifty, with an 18-55mm lens.<br>  - You can shoot in RAW mode, and have in camera editing. <br>  - The image quality is much better than that of a point and shoot camera, here's an image i took with it:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://flickr.com/photos/27145979@N02/2846179717/" rel="nofollow">http://flickr.com/photos/27145979@N02/28...</a><br>  <br>  Cons:<br>  <br>  - Doesn't autofocus AF lenses- which doesn't suit my needs, because i suck at focusing manually<br>  - Only six megapixels, Good for cropping- not the best though.<br>  - It's a rather slow shooter ( 2.5 FPS ) my Point and shoot can actually shoot faster. <br>  <br>  Basically, if you're just an average person, looking to get great shots, this would be a great camera for you, but if you plan on being a photographer, like me, you might want to save up your money for something a little more professional.

As others have said, the good is the small size for a dSLR, good image quality (way better than a p&s), the 18-55mm kit lens is pretty good quality which is able to focus to 11 inches (as measured from the film/sensor plane), full control of the camera, able to use my 25 year old Nikon lenses (in manual mode), AutoISO mode (this is a brilliant feature combined with the minimum shutter speed setting), color histogram mode (convoluted, but easily accessible), able to take 100 shots in continuous mode, long battery life (over 1500 shots without flash, 400 with 50% flash usage), and much more.<br>  <br>  Ken Rockwell has lots to say about this camera.

Biggest issue is the poor exposure metering. Tends to overexpose the highlights.

This is also a problem in some of Nikon's other dSLR cameras. The solution is shooting in Program mode instead of Auto mode. Program mode allows you to provide exposure compensation (EV) and doesn't pop up the flash when you don't want it. I find that setting the EV compensation to -0.7 works well for most situations. <br>  <br>  2. AutoISO mode remains on when the camera is set to manual mode unless specifically turned off. Obviously, the beta testers never used manual mode. This is only an issue if you use older Nikon lenses or do shooting that requires manual control.  AutoISO is a wonderful feature for every mode except manual.<br>  <br>  3. No exposure bracketing. With HDRI (high dynamic range imaging) becoming so easy to post process with great results (see Enfuse), it's a shame they didn't provide bracketing. Not an issue unless you do HDRI.<br>  <br>  4. Not a gripe, but just be aware that the D40 can only use the newer lenses if you want all the auto features. If you have a stable of older Nikon lenses, the D80 or D50 may be a better choice.
PRSji5dSaa	There are more than one company out there that makes very good HDTVs. The best HDTV for you depends on the kind of features you're interested in and the budget you're working with.  The higher the pixels, the higher the resolution but the price goes up significantly as well. If you want the latest HDTV, then go for a 1080 pixel but keep in mind that aside from Blu-ray and high-definition video games (X-box, for example) there are not many 1080 formatted products yet. On the other hand, I have seen over-the-air broadcasts in high-definition 720p and I can't imagine a sharper picture---it was that good. <br>  <br>  I spent several weeks researching HDTVs and I learned that generally Sony and Samsung are the two highest rated HDTVs across the board. So we narrowed our list between the Samsung 40” 1080p 120 Hz and the Sony Bravia XBR 40” 1080p 120Hz (Model: KDL-40XBR4). The Samsung already had an edge over the Sony as far as best-rated LCDs of 2007. Samsung dominated the top 10 list while Sony took the last spot. Furthermore, Sony is overpriced (costing a few hundred dollars more) and lacks many useful features that the Samsung includes.<br>  <br>  For example, Samsung includes two RF antenna inputs. I hooked up an amplified rabbit-ear antenna and picked up many of my local digital broadcasted channels. I live in a rural area where I can’t get cable or even satellite (trees block angle), so that was very important for me. The Samsung also includes a USB port. I used the port to hookup my Canon PowerShot digital camera and reviewed our family pictures in high definition. Samsung also includes picture-in-picture (PIP). I can play my xbox 360 and view something on TV  simultaneously in a smaller box within the main picture.<br>  <br>  For those reasons, I clearly saw Samsung as my best buy.<br>  <br>  For more information on the best rated HDTVs and to read reviews, check out the following websites:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://reviews.cnet.com/4321-6482_7-6591614.html" rel="nofollow">http://reviews.cnet.com/4321-6482_7-6591...</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.consumersearch.com/www/electronics/hdtv/" rel="nofollow">http://www.consumersearch.com/www/electr...</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://schoolofhdtv.com/index.php?/Samsung-HDTV/" rel="nofollow">http://schoolofhdtv.com/index.php?/Samsu...</a><br>  <br>  To learn the basics about HDTVs and become an informed consumer, check out the websites below (some are geared for the non-tech consumer):<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.hdtvinfoport.com/HDTV.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.hdtvinfoport.com/HDTV.html</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://buyinghdtv.com/html/hdtv_basics.html\" rel="nofollow">http://buyinghdtv.com/html/hdtv_basics.h...</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://hometheater.about.com/cs/television/a/aahdtvfaqsa.htm" rel="nofollow">http://hometheater.about.com/cs/televisi...</a><br>  <br>  Good luck with your purchase!|`|7I6kt1dmaa	1080 pixels are best.<br>  and i'd suggest a 40" but there are certain distances you have to be from the TV to get the best picture, if you are too close the quality will be poor, you will have to measure how far away from the TV you like to be|`|gLMhG9fVaa	I like sony bravia,the picture is almost 3D|`|ZNzLHGPkaa	the best is probably sony, they know what theyre doing. they do cost a bit more. i have a vizio, and it works great, 37 inch. i think you mean 1080p? 1080p is a better image quality than 720p, its very nice

HFuI8oVYaa	Where you place the file doesn't affect whether the OS can recognize the file or not (well, who knows what Vista does as Vista isn't designed to do useful work, only home entertainment). <br>  <br>  More likely you're missing a codec which interprets the video file. Find out what your video format is. I'll make a wild guess that it's MJPEG since Windoze doesn't come with a MJPEG codec. You can go to:<br>  <a href="http://www.free-codecs.com/download/Motion_JPEG_Codec.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.free-codecs.com/download/Moti...</a><br>  If your camera uses a different video format, the above web site may be able to help you out.
HFuI8oVYaa	You can't. Point & shoot cameras aren't optimized for video and the small sensor physical dimensions limit the quality under low lighting conditions. Plus, the amount of compression used on p&s camera videos is very high which places additional limits on the quality. If you want to take good quality videos at night, you need a decent quality video camera like the Sony VX2000 (oldie, but good camera, especially for low light conditions).<br>  <br>  If you insist on shooting videos with your p&s camera, you need lots of light to reduce the noise you are seeing. You are fighting the physics of the sensor. You should also set the white balance of your camera to suit the lighting type (incandescent, fluorescent) of your scene. This will make the color more natural. You can also post process the video with tools like VirtualDub. With VirtualDub, you can adjust brightness, contrast, and do some noise reduction. The convolution filter works well for noise reduction, but is hard to figure out if you're not into filtering algorithms.|`|AwbWKqGxaa	The poor quality with dimly lit subjects is not something that can be fixed with a setting. I'd recommend getting some lights (cheap clamp lights from a hardware store will work) and lighting your scene better. 
HFuI8oVYaa	Old Fuji Frontier systems go for around $20000 on EBay. New ones will probably  be more than $70k plus service contract.
lEYrs02Raa	Yes you can, but you'll need to use a card reader:<br>  <br>  Here's some example SD card readers from Amazon:<br>  <a href="http://www.amazon.com/s/ref=sr_st?keywords=card+reader&rs=172282&page=1&rh=n%3A172282%2Ck%3Acard+reader&sort=price" rel="nofollow">http://www.amazon.com/s/ref=sr_st?keywor...</a><br>  |`|HFuI8oVYaa	Yes, just copy them over. 
HFuI8oVYaa	Try installing the program logged in as Administrator. Vista was designed to be extremely user unfriendly. If that doesn't work, you'll need to install a newer version which you can download from the link below. Download CaptureNX, NOT CaptureNX2 which requires a different reg number. Hopefully, your old registration number will work on the newer version.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://support.nikontech.com/cgi-bin/nikonusa.cfg/php/enduser/std_adp.php?p_faqid=61" rel="nofollow">http://support.nikontech.com/cgi-bin/nik...</a><br>  <br>  If all else fails and you don't want to spring for another reg number, you can load VeiwNX which is free.

3mAgM405aa	The all time winner bargain compact digital camera is the Canon 7.1 megapixel PowerShot SD1000 [not the SD1100 [IS] 7.1 with an added 2- gig memory card which when set in the manual mode for "Vivid" colors and videos at 30 fps in 320 dpi format provides killer images and videos under low light conditions.

This might be a good camera to try out. You need to find someone with a G9 so you can listen to the audio quality. The limitation will now be the microphone. Unfortunately, the G9 might be slightly over your price range.
HFuI8oVYaa	A professional photographer acquaintance always carries around an old 3 mega pixel Olympus point and shoot when he's not on duty. Pictures from that camera get into a local newspaper periodically.<br>  <br>  "Pros" like to use SLR (35mm film), DSLR, or medium/large format cameras. A DSLR camera allows you to change lenses. Nikon D40 is around $450 these days, probably the cheapest DSLR around. Depending on the type of images you want to take, you may end up spending double that on lenses. Also, check out other manufacturer's lines of DSLR cameras. <br>  <br>  Taking nice pictures is more about the photographer's skill. Having a good camera makes life easier, however, you need to learn certain basics about camera controls and photography in general. Take a photography course. Borrow books from the library. You'll find that a small point and shoot camera can take very interesting pictures in the right hands. |`|coU37DqIaa	For your price I am suggestion Canon Powershot SX10IS 10MP Digital Camera with 20x Wide Angle Optical Image Stabilized Zoom.

VcPSzHrVaa	There is no way Sprint and Nextel phones are compatible...the former runs on CDMA (code-division multiple access) whereas Nextel's exclusive iDEN network runs on TDMA (time-division multiple access) just like GSM (but they're not necessarily 100% compatible). This incompatibility is why I find the merger stupid...but in any case, they're incompatible, and unless they come up with some miracle solution, will always will be. Sprint is very restrictive, and so the only phones you can use are they phones they offer, even though there are unlocked CDMA phones.<br>  <br>  If you insist on staying with CDMA, then the closest thing to a V635 would probably be an E815 or A840...technically these phones are already "unlocked" so you could technically use it on Alltel or U.S. Cellular, but as I said, Sprint is very restricted...

If you bought it on ebay, many Sony Ericcson phoens come factory unlcoked, in which case you are good to go.  You can go into a Cingular store and ask them to try a SIM card in the phone and it will tell you immediately whether it is locked or not.|`|VCSmsKVPaa	If it's a GSM phone and can be unlockes yes|`|DUvJNB3maa	if its unlocked. here's a link on ebay to unlocked ericssons

27d984cffcdc89fdac8b54891c0f46d9aa	XBox Live is a Microsoft online feature where you can send and receive text messages and voice messages to other users such as yourself.  XBox Live also has a "Xbox Live Marketplace" where users can download demos, trailers, even movies.  You actually rent the movies when you download them.  You can maintain a "Friends list".  Communicate with others "in game" using voice chat (that's is what the headset is for).  You can read more about XBox Live (and the related item called "Microsoft Points") at www.xbox360.com.<br>  <br>  XBox Live has two levels of membership: Silver and Gold.  Silver is free. Gold is a subscription service.  You can obtain a 1-month,  3-month or 12-month Gold level subscription.  The 12-month subscription costs about $US 50.  The 12-month subscription actually lasts 13 months since you also get one month free with it. The 3-month costs $20 while the 1-month costs $8.<br>  <br>  The 3-month and 12-month versions also have "Gold Packs" where a headset, a rebate for an XBox360 game, a free XBox Live arcade game and free "Microsoft Points" comes with the service.<br>  <br>  To use XBox Live, you will need a broadband internet service such as DSL or Cable and a storage device (either a memory card -- not recommended, or a harddrive).  You do not need a computer for this, just the XBox360 console.|`|f08064ac3fc140a06aaba40ad68ffd45aa	xbox live is where you can go online for multiplayer. it is very fun for halo 2. it costs $60 a year and i suggest getting it. you need a connection and the headset is for talking online. you can talk to whoever is in the online game

27d984cffcdc89fdac8b54891c0f46d9aa	If you are looking for "newer" games, the "next generation" of games, that have been coming out for the past year, then go with the XBox360.  The 360 has more choices, since it has been around for longer period of time -- like a year head start.<br>  <br>  However, it isn't simply the number of choices that determines the winner -- though that plays a very significant role as it shows game developer interests.  The more developers, the more likely that a game that you might like gets created.  <br>  <br>  The better choice is the console that has the most games that YOU like today.  A long list of lousy and dull games does you no good.  The important thing is what do they offer today (or the near future) that appeals to you.<br>  <br>  If you are unsure as to what games you might like, then go back to the default answer -- which is, which console has the most choices for next generation games and that would be the XBox360.<br>  <br>  For online game play experience of "next generation" games, the 360 wins hands down.  This is because the PS3 is so new that not many people have it; much less have the opportunity to play the games you might like.<br>  <br>  If you are looking to play the 'older' games (e.g. playstation 2, original xbox), then you might have better luck with the Playstation 3.  Microsoft went all out and made it a requirement that the game must be on the official list for the original xbox game to play on the 360.  I find that annoying.  I'd rather pop in the game and see if the bugs I might find are tolerable; rather than not play it at all.  I couldn't play my friend's Justice League Heroes for that very reason -- it isn't on the list.<br>  <br>  You can always check Microsoft's list ( <a href="http://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/backwardcompatibilitygameslist.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/backward...</a> ) or check of the compatibility status of playstation games ( <a href="http://www.us.playstation.com/Support/CompatibleStatus" rel="nofollow">http://www.us.playstation.com/Support/Co...</a> ) to see if the games that you like are on the list.  The console with the bigger list, either 360 or PS3, is the console you buy.<br>  <br>  Of course, if you already have the old console and plan to keep it then backwards compatibility isn't a problem for you.  So the choice boils down to which console offers the best selection of "next generation" games that appeals to you.<br>  <br>  I selected the XBox360.  I bought it in mid-December 2006.|`|0d85e26b936e7406c68bb2b3e762e2d9aa	i say ps3.<br>  but one thing they both dont have fans on them so the systems are going to get hot.|`|61a2233b9742cc652df14344f3e4ea74aa	If you really only care about the gameplay, then get a Wii.

27d984cffcdc89fdac8b54891c0f46d9aa	Your xbox360 will need to be connected to a wireless network.  For starters, you will need the XBox360 Wireless Network Adapter.  Costs about $100 plus tax.<br>  <br>  You will need a broadband service provider (DSL or cable).<br>  <br>  Your XBox360 must come equipped with a hard drive and you will need an ethernet cable (with RJ-45 connector) for the PC.<br>  <br>  You will need a network router.  Microsoft has a small list for you to review here: <a href="http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=52378" rel="nofollow">http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=5...</a><br>  <br>  Connect the modem to the router.  Connect the PC to the router using the ethernet cable (with RJ-45 connector).  Then connect the XBox360 to the router wirelessly.  You do not want both the PC and XBox360 connected to the router wirelessly at the same time.  Most wireless networks cannot handle the load -- if the PC is being used at the same time to stream video, for instance, while playing an XBox360 game online on your XBox360.<br>  <br>  You can read more about it here: <a href="http://www.xbox.com/en-US/pcsetup/xboxnetwork.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.xbox.com/en-US/pcsetup/xboxne...</a>

27d984cffcdc89fdac8b54891c0f46d9aa	Analog data (whether it is an image from a TV signal or sound from a radio) is represented by measurements of a continuous variable such as voltage.<br>  <br>  Digital data is represented by measurements of discrete symbols from a finite set, usually numbers such as binary.<br>  <br>  The bottom line difference is that one is continous, the other discrete.  <br>  <br>  Thus for digital sound and TV, the data in sound and images from TV are converted into ones and zeros, which allows for such things as data compression.
cb1c8e5fcd8492bc3787fd1b614481ecaa	Limewire is not used with anything. It is a program that allows you to get files from another persons computer. These can be mp3's among other things.

I had Sprint and then moved outside their coverage area, right after I signed a new two year contract..go figure, and they let me out of the contract for that reason. I did have to provide them with something that showed I was moving outside their service area, so it wasn't anything too time consuming on my end.<br>  <br>  You shouldn't have to return the phone instruments, unless there was something that actually stated that in your contract.  I know I kept all my old phone stuff.<br>  <br>  And as far as being able to reuse them it would really depend on how the phone is set up.  I know my sister was able to re use her phone when she switched phone carriers, she just had to get a new sim card...so that may be something you'll have to find out when you find a new carrier.

You can pick up a 320 gb hard drive now aways for a little over 100 on sale.  Sometimes a 500 gb for about 130.  <br>  <br>  Edit: Also if you have an ipod with plenty of room on it, you can enable disk use and just put your music onto that, it will be functioning as an external.

JEZgrx0Vaa	That would be you first problem.  The ipod being corrupt, means that there is a file or song or photo that has caused a break in the hard drives thinking ability.  If you haven't restarted your ipod do so and then erase everything that is on it.  Other than that, my ipods hard drive failed on me 3 weeks after i got it, not the greatest apple fan now.  I bought a microsoft zune after, never going back it is amazing.
e968f0ad75bc21a59b61b50c1fcfc1bcaa	The single-lens reflex (SLR) is a type of camera that uses a movable mirror placed between the lens and the film to project the image seen through the lens to a matte focusing screen. Most SLRs use a roof pentaprism or pentamirror to observe the image via an eyepiece, but there are also other finder arrangements, such as the waist-level finder or porro prisms.<br>  The shutter in almost all contemporary SLRs sits just in front of the focal plane. If it does not, some other mechanism is required to ensure that no light reaches the film between exposures.<br>  <br>  This feature separates SLRs from other cameras, as the photographer sees the image composed exactly as it will be captured on the film or sensor.<br>  <br>  Since the technology became widespread in the 1970s, SLRs have become the main type of camera used by dedicated amateur photographers and professionals.|`|eac8411737600cb69167ca52e369872faa	Single Lens Reflex..

d832de0f478ecb06f454896cd5d1bdf7aa	they are easy to manuver, cute, and fun to decorate, however if you are going to buy the one inch one, they STINK i would really reccomend the bigger one rather than the eency weency one. the bigger one is less breakable and doesnt get lost. the shuffle is also great for kids age 9+ for christmas. also good for runners, they hold up to i think 120 songs and the little one only holds like 75 songs. hope this helps :)|`|5fd3692928eab96b5a98d2e85ee88e3aaa	It depends on how you want to use it. If you want to use it while you excercise, are constantly on the go, don't have alot of songs that you want to put on it, and don't care for the games, photos, artwork, etc., a shuffle is perfect for you. They are inexpensive and very portable.|`|2bc9445750793249031e51d4dcb8c657aa	not really..considering they are not too popular or in fashion<br>  rather save up for an ipod nano..or even better a video|`|0314b7a167d34cf5ec12cf0dfe2d668eaa	It depends what you want. If you want 500 songs, than thats good. If you want a colored version of that with a screen, than an ipod nano does the trick. If you want to watch stuff on the pod, than a video ipod is what you want. Basically, it depends on what you want.

It may not be good for your CPU but your system is using less energy.<br>  <br>  Compare it to turning on/off your light bulb 20-30 times in a week and then compare it to leaving the light on for 7 days straight.  From an energy usage stand point, it is better to turn it off from time to time, in this case upto 30 times.  But on the other hand, all the bulb burnouts occur when I turn it back on -- if the bulb is that old.
27d984cffcdc89fdac8b54891c0f46d9aa	Both new console systems, XBox360 and Playstion 3 play, in high definition.  I have the XBox360 myself and play the games in high definition.  The clarity is far ahead of my old playstation 2 that I also have.<br>  <br>  The new Playstation 3 is far behind the XBox360 in terms of "newer" games.  This is because the PS3 is a year behind.  PS3 has some catching up to do. <br>  <br>  The PS3 has the definite edge in harddrive space.  The low end PS3 equals the high end XBox360.  If you want harddrive space, you will have to buy the high-end XBox360 version. The high-end PS3 has 3x the harddrive space of the high-end XBox360.<br>  <br>  The games, the saved games, the gamer profiles, and the like do not use that much space on the hard drive.  It is the other content that consumes hard drive space.   I have XBox Live and I use that to download additional content such as game demos for future games, Arcade Games, TV and movie clips, actual movies (some in HD), TV episodes (again, some are in HD), etc.  That's where all of my hard drive space go.<br>  <br>  The Playstation 3 has the edge over XBox360 in terms of 'compatibility' with older games.  For both consoles, the game developers are the reason for any compatibility issues (at least for the time being) and not all older games will play on the latest console, free of any major issues.  <br>  <br>  If game developers do not follow the standards layed out by Sony, there is no guarantee that the game will play in any future console.  With Microsoft, they took it one step further with the XBox360 -- too far, I think.  Microsoft has a list of compatible games.  If it isn't on the list, the XBox360 won't even let you play the old game.|`|4adf7466fc10afe51156d5ab34677ad2aa	I have both but like the 360 better. 360 has the new "achievements" system that keeps up with your gamerscore if your playing online.

I'm assuming that there aren't any newer games you want to play anytime soon.<br>  <br>  There is not a 100% guarantee that the original XBox games would run on the XBox360, however.

They claim that all Playstation and Playstation 2 games that follow the TRC should work with the Playstation 3.  However, not all game developers follow the rule. Unlike Microsoft, Sony doesn't give out a list or make it easy for users to find such a list.  Instead, they have you type in a name and search for the game in their catalog to see the compatibility status (<a href="http://www.us.playstation.com/Support/CompatibleStatus)" rel="nofollow">http://www.us.playstation.com/Support/Co...</a> with the description for most being "No major problems for this title".

27d984cffcdc89fdac8b54891c0f46d9aa	You can watch high definition movies, clips, videos, and trailers on the XBox360 without the HD-DVD drive.  These would have to be downloaded to the system's hard drive for viewing, however, and not loaded on a disc.<br>  <br>  I watched the trailer for the movie 300 in high definition.  The trailer is not on a disc; I downloaded through XBox Live.<br>  <br>  You will need a HD-DVD drive, which is purchased separately, to view high definition movies stored on HD-DVD discs.  You will need a Blu-Ray drive, which comes with the Playstation 3, to view high definition movies stored on Blu-Ray discs.  You do not need either of them if they were downloaded.  <br>  <br>  However, the selections for download is quite limited and the hard drive space is limited as well (meaning, you can only store about 2 HD movies on the hard drive at a time).  And it takes time to download them.<br>  <br>  Sony decided that all gamers will have to buy the Blu-Ray drive; regardless of whether you plan to use it or not.  If Gamer Joe has no plans to buy a Blu-Ray disc, then the Blu-Ray disc support that he bought with Playstation 3 does him no good.  With the XBox360, you choose when to go high definition.

AA10826682	It really depends on what features you want.  All have advantages and disadvantages.  If you want the most size, you're best off with the 80 gig Ipod or the 540 by Archos.  The archos model has some HUGE advantages.  It plays almost every video and musical format.  This means no timely conversions.  The Archos also works as an external hard drive without pain in the *** modifications needed by the IPod.  It also has a video recorder.  The Ipod doesn't.  You don't need Itunes to synch with it...you can dump things directly to it.  This is a MAJOR advantage. On the minus side, it's VERY large and heavy.  This mean it isn;t good for working out.  It;'s less convenient.  <br>  <br>  The 80 gig Ipod has the best battery life.  It's a little cheaper.  It has the most accessories available for it, and it;s got the best size for portability.  Their technical support STINKS so make sure you buy it from a place like best buy that offers an in store extended warranty service.<br>  <br>  The Zune has a ton of cool features.  It has a radio, wireless feature, you can set your own background art, it's got  a better screen then thre Ipod, it doesn;t scratch as easily as the Ipod.  It's much easier to use.  The downside is it's onl;y available as a 30 gig player.  That's not very large.  It also is a bit heavier then the Ipod, and it's battery life stinks.  They have GREAT technical support.

Some of the popular kids at my school have them, and they send songs and pics to each other all the time. It sounds cool. I'll try to get one soon too. And some of the gamers at my school have Xbox 360's and since the Zune integrates well with the Xbox 360, they want it too. Ipods are nice and all, but they're really getting to be the same old, same old. They also come in 3 different colors, and you can change the background on your Zune, so it's not the boring old white screen of the ipods. Zunes are the new thing, and usually people who say it's dumb, just are big Apple heads and don't care what else is out there.

abb29b8f09561585569587a34c39d081aa	?LCD o Plasma?<br>  <br>  La pregunta del millón. Hasta hace poco menos de un a?o la respuesta era muy evidente; todo dependía del tama?o que buscásemos. Si somos de los afortunados que disponemos de espacio para cualquier pantalla sea del tama?o que sea, es el precio el que nos marcará la más grande que nos podemos permitir. Si bajo esas premisas el tama?o elegido eran las 42 pulgadas o mayor, la respuesta era el plasma. Si no podíamos permitirnos algo tan grande, deberíamos optar por el LCD.<br>  Pero no podía ser tan fácil y en el último a?o han aparecido pantallas LCD de 43”, 46”, 50”… así que el tama?o ya no nos condiciona. La segunda gran diferencia eran las conexiones. Los LCD desde mucho antes que los plasma contaban con conexiones digitales DVI, lo que las hacían más apropiadas para usuarios de PC. La llegada de la conexión HDMI propicia que ambas tecnologías cuenten con las mismas posibilidades de conexión, así que tampoco nos sirve.<br>  Sin condicionantes objetivos que nos dirijan a una u otra opción, tenemos que empezar a buscar otros más subjetivos, del tipo de que “se vea mejor o peor”. Decimos que son subjetivos porque dos personas ante una misma proyección en un plasma y un LCD pueden disentir sobre cuál se ve mejor. Y es que aunque las diferencias en la imagen sean evidentes, a cada cual le puede gustar una u otra.<br>  En teoría una escena sobre un LCD resulta mucho más definida, más “viva”, mientras que el plasma ofrece más contraste y una paleta de colores más natural. <br>  <br>  Resolución<br>  <br>  En nuestra opinión esta es la gran baza del LCD ahora que tanto se va a hablar de alta definición. Mientras que sólo algunos plasmas de 42” alcanzan los 1024x1024, los LCD de ese tama?o se mueven ya por los 1920x1080. A comienzos de este 2006 lo más extendido son los plasmas de 1024x720 y LCD de 1366x768 pero es mucho más fácil para el cristal líquido que para el plasma seguir mejorando en este aspecto. Según nuestra opinión, es la diferencia más determinante entre ambas tecnologías.<br>  <br>  Brillo<br>  <br>  Al igual que con el contraste, no es una valor que podamos considerar del todo determinante, pero no por el hecho de que carezca de importancia, sino porque se valora de forma muy diferente de un producto a otro. Partamos de que el brillo es fundamental si queremos tener una buena visión de la pantalla con luz ambiental. Una pantalla con un bajo nivel de brillo nos obligará a apagar las luces o cerrar las persianas para verla con claridad. Cuanto más brillante sea la escena, menos influirá sobre ella la luz ambiental. El problema llega en las especificaciones de cada fabricante. Hay fabricantes que hacen las mediciones del brillo de sus pantallas con una imagen totalmente en blanco mientras que otros optan por una imagen en un gris neutro. Evidentemente, en una misma pantalla el brillo será mayor con la pantalla totalmente en blanco que en gris, pero es esta última situación la que más se acerca a las condiciones reales de uso de la pantalla.<br>  Bajo estas premisas las pantallas de plasma publicitan mayores niveles de brillo, situándolo alrededor de las 1000, 1500 candelas por metro cuadrado, mientras que un LCD medio ronda las 400 ó 500 candelas. Sin embargo si atendemos a pruebas realizadas por terceras empresas como los laboratorios VNU comprobaremos como el brillo en ambas tecnologías es muy similar, si bien sí que existe una peque?a ventaja hacia el plasma.<br>  <br>  Contraste<br>  <br>  En esta ocasión sí que hay una ventaja clara para el plasma y se debe a cómo funciona cada tecnología a la hora de oscurecer una parte de la escena. Mientras que en las pantallas de LCD son los cristales líquidos los que adquieren opacidad para impedir pasar la luz que “sobra” en una pantalla negra, en el plasma cada célula es “excitada” eléctricamente sólo hasta alcanzar el brillo adecuado o el ***** “verdadero”. Así, el plasma reproduce cada color exacto mientras que el LCD no llega a conseguir evitar del todo el paso de la luz a través de sus cristales. Las diferencias se hacen evidentes en una secuencia oscura, con muchas tonalidades de ****** y marrones. Sencillamente el ***** se ve gris. Lo mismo ocurre en menor medida en el resto de colores, más naturales y exactos en el plasma.<br>  <br>  ángulo de visión<br>  <br>  Otra de las bazas del plasma frente al LCD. La tecnología LCD se basa en la luz que se proyecta sobre los millones de unidades de cristal líquido, mientras que el plasma es cada “célula de fósforo” la que brilla con luz propia. Esto permite que sea posible mirar un plasma desde cualquier posición y ver la imagen con todo su brillo y definición, mientras en los LCD la mejor calidad de visión se obtiene mirando de frente a la pantalla, perdiendo mínimamente definición a medida que aumentamos el ángulo de visión hasta llegar casi a la perpendicular, en un ángulo de unos 160 ó 170 grados, en los que ya no vemos nada. Este problema es realmente importante en los retroproyectores (aunque no en los nuevos DLP) pero en el LCD pierde casi toda su importancia para cualquiera que ponga su pantalla en una ubicación “normal”.<br>  Esta forma de generar la imagen también crea otra peque?a ventaja a favor del plasma. En estas pantallas la luminosidad de toda la pantalla es prácticamente la misma, mientras que en las LCD hay una mayor luminosidad en el centro de la pantalla que se va perdiendo a medida que nos vamos alejando hacia los bordes de la misma.<br>  <br>  Tiempo de respuesta<br>  <br>  El tiempo de respuesta se refiere al tiempo que tarda un píxel en pasar del color ***** al blanco y seguidamente otra vez al *****. Este tiempo, demasiado alto al principio, fue el causante de que los monitores TFT y LCD de PC no fuesen recomendables para su uso con juegos o películas. Al tardar los píxeles “demasiado” tiempo en cambiar de color se producían efectos de estelas y emborronamientos o “ghosting”. En las pantallas LCD ocurría lo mismo y de ahí que se desaconsejasen para ver películas de acción o todas aquellas donde se produjesen imágenes con movimiento muy rápido. A medida que ha pasado el tiempo los LCD prácticamente en su totalidad han alcanzado los 16 ms, con lo que el problema anterior es inapreciable. Sin embargo el plasma no llega a tener ese problema por lo que es un punto más a su favor.<br>  Como comentábamos en el apartado del brillo, a la hora de medir el tiempo de respuesta cada fabricante tiene un protocolo. Hay algunos que miden el tiempo que se tarda en pasar entre blanco y ***** y otros que lo hacen entre blanco y gris. Evidentemente es más sencillo llegar al gris y volver al blanco por lo que los tiempos de respuesta son mejores.<br>  <br>  Consumo eléctrico<br>  <br>  La tecnología usada en el plasma requiere una gran cantidad de corriente eléctrica. El gas que contiene el panel requiere ser constantemente excitado eléctricamente para mantenerse en estado de plasma y requiere aún más carga eléctrica para hacer reaccionar el fósforo que se tornará azul, rojo o verde… Si bien los consumos se han reducido con las sucesivas generaciones de plasmas, aún es un electrodoméstico con un consumo más que apreciable. El LCD se basa en una lámpara situada detrás de las celdas de cristal líquido que se mantiene encendida constantemente, pudiendo ser de bajo consumo. Un detalle muy significativo y que nos ayudará a comprobar este parámetro es el calor que desprende una pantalla de plasma encendida, inexistente en un LCD.<br>  <br>  Vida útil<br>  <br>  Quizá la mayor leyenda urbana sobre los plasmas. La gente les teme porque piensan que van a dejar de verse correctamente después de unos a?os de uso. Realmente sí que es así, pero ahora mismo todos los fabricantes garantizan la vida de sus pantallas más allá de las 20.000 horas de uso, siendo más habitual ver ya las 60.000 horas. Y a partir de estas horas no es que “se apaguen” sino que el desgaste del fósforo que ilumina la pantalla habrá reducido aproximadamente a la mitad el brillo de la misma. Sin embargo el LCD es una tecnología “fría”, que apenas provoca desgaste y ni siquiera tiene ese problema. De todas formas, si hablamos de 20.000 de uso lo hacemos de 11 a?os a una media de 5 horas diarias y, sentimos decirlo, cualquier pantalla se habrá estropeado mucho antes de que la diferencia de brillo nos invite a cambiarla. Además, no sabemos qué tipo de pantallas habrá disponibles dentro de tantos a?os, pero nos gustaría pensar que habrá “algo” que nos permita olvidarnos rápidamente de cualquier plasma. En todo caso, por lo que estamos viendo lo más habitual es que los plasmas “mueran” por la fuente de alimentación mucho antes de tener cualquier otro problema.<br>  <br>  <br>  Concluyendo…<br>  <br>  Hemos de partir de unos mínimos que son las conexiones digitales y la certificación HDCP. Después el tama?o que nos interesa y luego podemos prestar atención a la resolución, el brillo, el contraste y demás parámetros que hemos detallado. Una vez con la idea más aproximada posible de lo que queremos, nos plantamos en una tienda y si es posible vemos las mismas imágenes en un plasma y en un LCD. Es recomendable no dejar de ver escenas oscuras y también todo lo contrario, escenas de colores vivos y con mucho movimiento como las de los dibujos animados. <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  Las tv's de plasma funcionan con gas a presion<br>  Las tv's de LCD utilizan una sustancia líquidapara trabajar.<br>  <br>  (Comparando 2 tv's de las mismas pulgadas)<br>  *La plasma es mucho más pesada que el LCD<br>  *Las tv's LCD se pueden girar, voltear, poner alrevés, zangolotear, etc; las plasma deben de estar derechas, hacia arriba siempre, porque se descomponen.<br>  *Las LCD, con buen cuidado duran hasta 30 a?os con un uso de 6 horas diarias. Las plasma 8-10 a?os con el mismo uso.<br>  *Las LCD son más caras aún que las plasma.<br>  *Aunque las dos pueden ser HDTV (high definition television), en las plasma se puede quemar la pantalla por un logotipo de un canal de tv (se queda la mancha), por la marca del reloj de la tv, etc, aunque se evita cuidándola bien.|`|4e00f4b9f7943a426bc9339e11d1c940aa	no son las mismas, hay televisiones de lcd el cual es conocido como cristal liquido y por ejemplo es de lo que estan hechas los displays de las laptops, las plasma es una tecnologia un poco mas nueva que funciona por medio de gas, esta ultima tiene una imagen un poco mas brillante, las 2 son excelentes opciones, cada una tiene sus cosas buenas y malas, por ejemplo la plasma produce mucho calor y gasta muchisima mas electricidad que la lcd, pero es mas barato producirla, por lo mismo las televisiones mas grandes son de plasma, las lcd solo llegan por lo normal a 37 pulgadas. saludos|`|222d51021dff5316079fb660396d725aaa	son tan diferentes que en lo unico en que se parecen es que ambas son pantallas planas :)<br>  <br>  Las diferencias tecnicas no son relevantes (a nivel usuario, claro) las LCD se hacen principalmente en tama?os peque?os y las de plasma se fabrican a partir de 40 pulgadas.

In my opinion the 2 is better than the 3 because it doesn't seem so fragile and because its the directional pad and scrolling function are easier to use.   The only problem is, the 2 doesn't have an alarm clock, which is sort of rediculous considering it is one of the things most people who own cell phones use the most.<br>  <br>  J-|`|adJzkc2Maa	wtf?? they still sell those pieces of ****?

While it's great for someone--usually kids--who want all the texting, internet, and email capabilities with the official looks, it does support MyFaves 5 free number calling it does not have any of the followin that most people would want when seeking a data phone.....<br>  <br>  ....such as:  No camera, Not bluetooth enabled, No expandable memory/ No memory card slot, No Music player for MP3s, No Voice Dialing, Not Wi-Fi-Broadband capable.<br>  <br>  The price differences: SideKick iD can currently be had for $99.99/2yr service agreement and after $50.00 mail-in rebate, $149.99/1yr service agreement, or $299.99 purchased out right if you aren't eligible for an upgrade discounted price!<br>  <br>  The other Dwayne Wade version Sidekick is just like the other Sidekick in terms of capabilities but is more expensive due to the fact it is a limited edition model with about only 2500 released in the U.S. and is customized by Wade himself.  All about marketing and money with that kinda stuff andif you're not a fan of him the regular Sidekick 3 is exactly the same as far as fetures and capablity and up to a $100.00 less in terms of expense!  Other thing to note too is that b/c te Dwayne Wade version Sidekick is a limited edition model there is a No Return policy on it--once you buy it you keep it!<br>  <br>  Hope this helps!!

imaeeL9Naa	Robert0 you are incorrect. <br>  My Macs play dvds that my other devices won't.<br>  <br>  Ellharp, check your dvd player region settings.  It may be as simple as that.  If that doesn't work you may want to try different dvd player software, try Windows Media Player and there are many others out there.  Intervideo, well i'm not sure if that's for macintosh.<br>  <br>  ~Shoe|`|AA11976863	Region codes limit your playing DVD that were not released in your region. It all revolves around this: Movies are released in theaters and also on DVD at different times in different parts of the world. They may be months apart in U.S. compared with Japan. You could buy a DVD from one country while the theaters were still trying to sell tickets for showings in another country. Because the theater owners hate to loose ticket sales to DVD buyers, they have a plan in place to add a digital bit to DVD movie disks to communicate the region to the player. Most computer makers agree to comply with this and add the bit detector to the DVD system of their computers. If you, or someone else who uses your computer, travels around the world and buys DVD movies in other countries, as soon as you put a foreign sold disk in the drive you will see the message warning you that you must change the region code in order to play that disk AND it can only be changed four times (5 codes including the first). You or someone else who used your computer, agreed to that and now you are stuck, no more changes.<br>  <br>  Depending on which Mac computer you have, it is either hardware or software that limits your changing the region code. If the software is out of changes, try another application such as VLC. If it is the actual drive, you have a much more difficult problem.<br>  <br>  As you seem to be completely unaware that any change of region code have ever occurred on your Mac, others must be using the DVD player and are agreeing to the big, scary warning that always appears when you insert any DVD that has a region code bit burned into it that is not the same as that of your DVD playing system. There may be options available to change the firmware of the drive back and remove the code lock but I can't tell you what those options are.<br>  <br>  Just for grins, here are the region codes:<br>  <br>      * Region 0: Compatible with any DVD player/region<br>      * Region 1: U.S.A and its territories, Canada<br>      * Region 2: Europe, Japan, Middle East, South Africa<br>      * Region 3: East and Southeast Asia<br>      * Region 4: Australia, New Zealand, Central America, Mexico, South America<br>      * Region 5: Africa, Eastern Europe, North Korea<br>      * Region 6: China<br>      * Region 7: Reserved<br>      * Region 8: International venues (airplanes, cruise ships, etc.)<br>  <br>  Additionally, I will tell you that from my experience, all DVDs sold in all the cheap markets in China are codeless and compatible with all scan systems (NTSC and PAL). They play on all players and never ask you to accept a code change. This is in line with China's typical loose compliance with all intellectual property rights. But somewhere there may be one I haven't bought that has a code so don't buy a hundred DVDs in China and get miffed if some of them have a code or don't play for you.|`|jTBM1Mvnaa	i know for a fact a mac does not accept any dvd with minor or major scratches and or bootleg/fakelly made cd's

bRJAqc8Baa	Check the watts on the system itself.  Make sure you are putting out enough watts to warrant new speakers.  You do not want to have a 200 watt system and buy 300 watt speakers.<br>  <br>  You can only play what the system will put out.  Once you know what that is then make a choice on speakers.  There are tons of speakers that will work fine - trust me.  Do not go out and pay for expensive speakers.|`|svt6B0I3aa	JBL speakers are the best. and use good quality speaker wires to get the maximum quality sound.|`|AA12381582	I agree with http, if the reciever is of a low wattage, which the cheaper ones tend to be, then your sound out put will be rather low.

But you also need an HD receiver in order to convert the signal to the quality from your cable.  It's not a scam.  All cable companies require it to view HD on your TV.  You can get a HD Antenna and get some local HD channels in larger cities for free however.  And some TV's have built in HD tuners that can do the same thing.  But to view all the HD channels available you need a receiver.  <br>  <br>  So yes HDTV is more expensive for the package and the receiver because it's higher quality television.|`|AA10594501	We've all been watching analog TV since the 1950's or earlier. Come this June 12, analog broadcasting will cease and all over-the-air TV signals, those that you pick up with an antenna, will use a digital system, with many of them HD. So, with a good antenna, you can pick up HD broadcast for free.<br>  <br>  None of that has anything to do with cable or satellite systems though, regardless of some of the misleading ads you might see.<br>  <br>  However, if you want the extra variety of channels that cable and satellite companies offer, then, to get HD, you need to subscribe to one of their HD packages and get an HD receiver from them, for an extra fee of course. HD channels consume much more of the cable/satellite transmission capacity (bandwidth), so it is more costly.|`|YwPmwKblaa	The cable and satellite companies encrypt the HD signals this is so that someone not paying for the HD channel and service are not just able to grab them. The receiver does no more than decrypt the signals. Now as for cable companies by FCC rules must broadcast the local channels free of charge. Generally these are decrypted Using what is know as a QAM receiver these are built in to most new tvs. So if you have cable then you should try to scan for channels and it should pickup your local HD channels however with Satellite since they already charge to give you locals they are not required to broadcast the HD channels for free. Another way to get the Local HD channels is to get an antennae that receives Digital and HD broadcasts.|`|jLTDqVHsaa	To receive over-the-air "free" digital signals, all you need is an antenna.  A few of those over-the-air digital broadcasts are HD.  Maybe a handful of them, not many.  The major networks are what you'll see...CBS, NBC, ABC, know what I mean?  Some of them might still be broadcasting analog (480i) or "enhanced" (480p) programming.<br>  <br>  Now, as for your satellite service, they are providing you with their standard-definition programming.  To upgrade and get HD service from them, you will need an upgraded box for all of those HD channels.<br>  <br>  So, to get your HD satellite channels like CNN-HD, Fox News-HD, ESPN-HD, Discovery-HD, and so forth, you'll need the upgraded box, or you'll only get standard-definition satellite transmissions.<br>  <br>  Does this make sense?  If you have any further questions, feel free to ask.|`|becbbc070b924453c0b189d4a9d17b80aa	There are 3 factors in a TV transmission system<br>  a) The Signal; needs to be in HD<br>  b)  The receiver needs to be able to receive HD signals<br>  c) The TV needs to be able to display HD signals<br>  <br>  Part a) you have no control, but now satellite, cable and off-the air do transmit in HD<br>  <br>  You do have part c)<br>  <br>  So, the issue is b). Your TV has an HD tuner, but you need to connect an antenna to receive off-the-air channels.<br>  <br>  If you need to receive HD from cable or satellite you need an HD-capable set-top box.|`|zLKsBm1Uaa	HD tv signal over the air is free, but you may need a outside antenna.<br>  The other sources charge money.

It causes static on phone lines very often.  If you are only having internet issues, I think this would be an ISP problem.  If there is a streetlight that isn't working now, check with you neighbors and see if they are having a problem too.  A cable may have been cut in the street if you have no connectivity.

Normally anything over 1Mb/s is good. When you get your results if you post them here someone can give you a better idea of how you will be on live. Secondly you stream netflix movies on the Xbox. You have to have netflixs to be able to get them. The movies you can watch VIA the netflix application on the Xbox are the movies that are in your netflixs instant Queue.|`|RqxdlF3faa	My DSL worked decently with Xbox live but I got disconnected every now and then.

HFuI8oVYaa	This should be in the computers area, not in cameras.<br>  <br>  Short answer: You will need to do port forwarding on your cable or DSL modem (router), assuming it is a NAT router. <br>  <br>  Long answer:<br>  1. You need to determine the IP number that the camera uses which is probably set by the DHCP server in your router. It will look similar to this example: 192.168.1.105. There are programs which will scan your local subnet for active IP numbers if you don't know what your camera's IP number is. Sometimes a device name can be used in lieu of the IP number when setting up port forwarding.<br>  <br>  2. You need to determine the port number your camera uses. I'm guessing it's a http (web) port which is 80.<br>  <br>  3. You need to set your modem (router) to perform port forwarding to your camera. You will need to consult the instruction manual on how to do this as all routers have different configuration interfaces. Your modem's configuration interface via a web browswer using the address 192.168.1.1 (this is what most manufacturers use for a local address).<br>  <br>  4. You will need to find out your modems IP number on the WAN port. Your modem interface screen will have this information or you can go to a port scanning web site which will tell you your IP address. Beware that this IP number can change at any time, especially if your modem has gone through a power cycle. Thus, it's a good idea to check the number before trying to do remote access.<br>  <br>  5. From the outside world, you will use the address discovered in step 4 to access your camera on a web browser. Depending on your ISP, they may block incoming traffic which means you can't remotely monitor your camera.|`|j5Apt8hWaa	If the cameras is an IP camera, all you have to do is type in your cameras IP address (123.456.789.012) into the URL address and if you  have your camera connected to your LAN and connected to the internet through your computer, you should be able to connect directly through your LAN but you will have to open a port through your firewall to see it and set up a password for access.
AA10594501	It would probably work, but be very careful of impedence. If you wire the sub in parallel with the L/R speakers, impedence can drop very low, possibly damaging the output stage of your amp.<br>  <br>  Some subwoofers have pass-through inputs. You hook up the L/R lines to the sub inputs and then hook your speakers to the sub's pass-through outputs. This arrangement protects your amp from low impedence and also filters out the low frequencies so that only the sub gets them, relieving your L/R speakers from dealing with the ultra-lows.|`|0NVypgGSaa	yes you can, just connect your tv audio out to your sub audio in. then just adjust the volume of your sub.  if you have a variable audio output its better to connect it there so you dont have to keep on adjusting the volume of your sub.

Ur6H8gwkaa	The D80 is a fine camera. Don't get too caught up in the idea of a 'starter' dSLR. There really is no such thing to be honest.<br>  <br>  Take a look at the D80 and what it cost, and the flagship Nikon D3. Look hard, all the controls are in the same place, all the rules of photography apply to all models regardless of price.<br>  <br>  The learning curve isn't much different when it comes to just picking them up and getting started. The only difference really between the top models, and the cheaper ones, are the extra features when you dig down into the menu. top models are better built, have better sensors, AF, and just about everything, but none of those things will make you a better or worse photographer.<br>  <br>  The flagship models, regardless of brand,  can do a lot of things for those willing to get further into things. But as far as just picking the camera up, they are all pretty much that same.|`|AA12307705	Look into getting Magic Lantern's guide to the D80.

Its better for more stuff.|`|9roHz7ZTaa	I have the first bag you listed. My problem with it is that I dont think it's big enough.

I would advise keeping a copy of each downloaded programme stored on your computer in a folder, as sometimes a download doesn't play properly on the player and has to be copied again.

If the Samsung has better contrast ratio: go with the Samsung :)|`|RyvKws7Laa	Sony customers are loyal to a fault.  So I'd be cautious of listening to those replies.  Don't get me wrong, you won't get a bad TV from Sony.  They make very solid very reliable products.  But they will often charge you more or the same for weaker specs (not talking about the contrast like the other responder).  I would look at how many inputs and outputs you're getting and what kind of built in speakers you're getting (at least if you think you'll ever use them).<br>  <br>  Picture quality is likely to be quite similar, but I bet the Samsung would win in an independent review.  Samsung is the leader in LCDs and the 6 series (which is what you're looking at) is one of their stronger lines.  You will be getting a very solid picture there.<br>  <br>  I agree with the comments of going Panasonic Plasma, but that's another debate entirely.  If you're settled on the LCD, then like others have said you're not likely going to go too wrong with either choice.  But I think the overall picture quality will be stronger with the Samsung.  <br>  <br>  I would also go into store and take a hard look at the viewing angle difference between the two.  The Sony doesn't rate quite as good.  So if you're going to need stronger picture from looking at a somewhat side angle (versus purely straight on), then you should look hard at that in the store.  Again, I think the Samsung will win that battle.|`|9531a5e374db145835852e9715fc4e49aa	Honestly both of those TV's are great.  Personally I like the Bravia better.  And I think it does come down to personal choice between those two.  <br>  <br>  The reviews on the Bravia are good too.  <br>  <br>  However looking at the specs, the Samsung has the edge with a 50,000:1 Contrast Ratio as opposed to the Sony 30,000:1.  <br>  <br>  But again I go with the Bravia, because for some reason the 52" Bravia I have is the clearest picture I've seen yet.  I have a 40" Samsung of a different model.  <br>  <br>  Both have a 120hz refresh rate.  <br>  <br>  So on paper Samsung gets the edge.  But I'd look at them both if possible.|`|sER6UGMWaa	OMG people are such idiots... first of all you can not go by a contrast ratio because there isnt a standard way of measuring it ... second of all... there is nothing produced in 120 hz in order to see it so thats a waste of money and time looking for it... if you want a television i would say go and order the new panasonic neo pdp coming out nxt month... its a inch thick has the deepest contrast.... wonderful manufacter.. lasts longer than lcd's and its also cheaper as well... you will get your moneys worth and you dont have to worry about a lag like the lcds you do and if everybody wants to go by the advertising scams of 120 the panasonics lists 600 hz...|`|HX6JjCTyaa	Both are excellent tv.Personally I would go with Samsung LN46A650 that come with higher dynamic contrast ratio (50,000:1 while Sony 30,000:1).<br>  <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001413D94?ie=UTF8&tag=computer0bd-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=B001413D94" rel="nofollow">http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001413...</a>|`|6srJbS6Vaa	Please look these for comparison at Amazon.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/remote-comparison?ie=UTF8&ASIN.1=B001413D94&ref%5F=pd%5Fcmp%5Fadd%5Fgrp%5Fe&ASIN.2=B0019HZINM&ASIN.3=B0017Q6DFC&tag=discount.save-20" rel="nofollow">http://www.amazon.com/gp/remote-comparis...</a><br>  <br>  Hope this help.<br>  <br>  Good Luck.|`|rteYGJKsaa	<a href="http://www.b-sidestore.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.b-sidestore.com</a>

5Sbbw8rXaa	My cousin had the same problem because of a scratch on his game. There were certain spots he couldn't go and certain people he couldn't talk to or the game would crash. You can try to repair the disk if it is scratched or get d-skin disc covers. If that doesn't work you might have to get a new game disc.|`|ZIciIWHTaa	this happened to me when i tried to fast travel to bruma. it's because your disc is scratched try to clean it with a cloth or go to gamecrazy and get it cleaned.
Z2HTjHlRaa	try checking if the router and modem that you are using are compatible with the xbox, you can see the list on the xbox website<br>  <br>  if it is not compatible it does not mean that the xbox will not connect but it will "always connect"  by the way, what issue are you having when connecting to xbox live? determining this issue will help in solving the problem..
QjS3zl3Yaa	Ok first of all why did you press the screen really hard, dont do that to any electronics, it will reck.<br>  <br>  Now the ipod touch first layer is glass to prevent sctraches, after there is this small film that sperates the glass from the lcd, I think its like to enhance the touch preformance, Well if you press the screen to hard you either damaged the lcd or that film was bent spread onto the lcd<br>  <br>   There is no way to fix it, if you get lucky the spot will go away after a while, but you have to be lucky, now you said you just got it so, I think you could just return it to the store and say somethings wrong with it and they will give you a new one, I think this is for like 90 days from purchase, or you can try calling apple and see whats up.<br>  <br>  Hope the gray spot goes away, and lol dont press the screen abnormally hard lol.|`|MsaJ30Mlaa	you cant fix that i dont think

475c01dc76b1f175b986a137414d9e50aa	I just looked up that radio:<br>  <br>  The Clansman PRC-349 is a modern synthesized VHF/FM radio Frequency range is 37 to 46.95 MHz in 25 KHz spacing providing 400 possible channels.<br>  <br>  In the USA, our small walkie talkies are in the UHF range.  You really need to check the frequency range of the civilian radios.  My best guess is that the Clansman radio would not be able to talk to the civilian radios.<br>  <br>  I would be careful using that military radio - the military does not like civilians using their frequencies.  They have ways of finding you if you transmit a lot.

164093cfac0cfd3d52d1c4b7beab3cbaaa	There should be an aerial connector on the back of your skybox for an aerial lead to go to bedroom via a special sensor which is quite cheap.  You can also buy a kit with this and a second remote control fairly cheaply.  You will only receive in the bedroom what is playing in the lounge. To receive a different programme you will need to pay for SKY MULTIROOM.  I recommend the Sky +box.  This enables you to record two programmes at once, or watch one programme while recording another.|`|AA11141136	<a href="http://www.satcure.co.uk/tech/extenders.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.satcure.co.uk/tech/extenders....</a>|`|aHVlY3fCaa	buy a digital reciver from argos.

qGfAlDd2aa	Yes, the same channels are used for both analog and digital, only the way the signal is sent is being changed.<br>  <br>  The FCC is using the transition as an opportunity to move the stations closer together and reduce the band.

XcF4L6KMaa	Well that depends. I have loaded several beta OS's on my storm. Some definitely work better than others. Also it's wierd because it seems like the betas affect each phone differently. I loaded .90 and it really crashed my phone all the time, where others were having no probs at all. I upgraded to .99 and my phone runs great, where others have had issues with it. There are now a few more out there. Go to crackberry.com, and read all the threads on there. Thats how I ultimately decide if its woth trying the new OS. Just remember that those are pirated beta releases, and there are resons that they never got approved for official release. I read all the time in those threads I mentioned, people crying about it not doing this or that, or this bug or that bug. Fact is that none are approved, and do contain bugs. In my opinion people have no right to cry about it because they shouldn't even be running it in the first place. Have fun!!!|`|wYg3del2aa	Crackberry.com is always your answer.

3FerQ9Ehaa	Most of the people I know who did this regretted it. At&t does not have as large of a network as Verizon so your coverage won't be as great as Verizon. I used to have At&t, Sprint, and T-Mobile and switched to Verizon for this reason. I have been able to take calls from my Verizon phones even under ground on some of the NYC subways. Their coverage is sick! I want an IPhone really bad myself, but I won't change from Verizon for anything. Good luck|`|CrbK3LnXaa	I just switched from Verizon to AT&T last week solely for the purpose of getting an iPhone.  I would not give it up.  I had to break my contract with Verizon which cost me $85 but that was worth it.   I tired Verizon's closest phone to the iPhone which was the Samsung Omnia but that phone is a joke compared to the iPhone.  The Omnia was slow with everything, not just the internet.  I couldn't get my music or phone book uploaded to it or anything.  So like I said, I have had the iPhone for about a week now and I haven't had any issues with reception or anything like that but you need to know that you have to pay for the phone, activation fees, the data plan which is a monthly charge of $30 and then in addition to all of that what ever your monthly bill for text and minutes would be.  It can get pretty pricey but I think it is 100% worth it.

fwdsp3dVaa	Is your cable package Standard def or digital/High def? It sounds to me like you're getting Standard def!<br>  <br>  With Standard def(480i), it doesn't matter what kind of cable you use it's always going to look crappy on a HDTV! Call up your cable company and order their HD package. That will make a huge difference!<br>  <br>  Just FYI, you don't HAVE to have a HDMI cable when watching HD channels! HD channels are only broadcast in a max resolution of 1080i. Which is the same as 720p. A HDMI cable carries a max resolution of 1080p. A Component cable carries a max resolution of 720p/1080i. So using either will give you the same picture quality! However, component cables are cheaper! Blu-ray, PS3 & Xbox 360 are the only true high def(1080p) sources out right now, so they warrant getting a HDMI cable!|`|FPsR2xi7aa	Just because cable went digital, doesn't mean it went Hi-Def.  HD channels are different than standard digital cable.<br>  <br>  If you aren't getting good picture, it's probably not an HD channel.<br>  <br>  In most cases, you have to pay more to get the HD varients of the channels.|`|AA11595360	its only great quality if you are getting HDTV through your box. If you do have HD and its still not really clear double check that your box is set to 1080i or what ever the highest setting is on your set.|`|Ae5IYHjVaa	You need to make sure you are receiving a HD signal, and that you are on a HD channel|`|pkHiGVYEaa	See first answer...<br>  <br>  You need to make sure you are watching an HD cable channel AND that you have an HD cable box.  I'm assuming that since your cable box has an HDMI port, it's HD capable, so watch an HD channel.<br>  <br>  ALSO, the quality will depend on a lot on the TV you have.  If you have a cheap TV, don't expect the HD quality to be as high as a high end TV (the cheapest LCD HDTVs have qualith that looks horrible.)|`|pRxzPiSbaa	only if you are already receiving an HD signal at your cable box. possible cable upgrade to get it if you dont already have it.|`|SZUzatcJaa	You see what you get. There isn't much else you can do, except get a better TV.|`|R4cZs9q0aa	call cable provider|`|UinOWcMUaa	Well just make sure your watching and HD channel you will notice the difference !! Regualr channels will only put out 480p but with and HD channel it should put out 1080p your TV is 1080p. Make sure you infact have an HD turner box and that your cable company idn't pulling your leg. If it is a smaller TV you should still notice the difference just maybe not as much as say a 46' or bigger...<br>  <br>  Also, you may need to go into your TV settings and assign the HDMI port.. to recognize your HDMI cable.|`|8213dbb28238df28f026dac640239fb1aa	The HDTV and HDMI cable can only show as good a signal as they're given.  If you are watching standard definition TV on them you won't notice an improvement over a regular old tube TV with RCA connectors.  Get HD cable and it'll knock your socks off.

I suggest copytrans, it works great.<br>  <br>  edit: copytrans or copypod gives you 100 transfer trial, however if you look on torrents you can find cracks for it.<br>  <br>  Good luck|`|bC5OAfs5aa	Here is an easy way.

He might have put another sim card in that was for another phone, and therefore, would not work with that one, or it could be a bad sim altogether, or he could have run up a bill so high on that one that they deactivated it.  Just make sure that the sim card is inserted properly and then give it a try.  The sim card can be tricky and won't work if it's not in the exact way it has to be.  If nothing works, then you probably bought a worthless phone.|`|DjMhDdEPaa	you can usually go to the kiosk in the mall and just ask for a free sim card , don't call t-mobil for one they will charge you $10.00 or more , then you call t-mobil and they can activate it over the phone , it takes a few min to connect , but a  much better way to do it right . Sounds like the sim was from a pre-paid account and yeah you got duped . it happens to the best of us

You'll have to unplug the computer and plug the PS3 into the modem in order for the PS3 to get the internet.<br>  <br>  Honestly though, you should really look into buying at least a router, if not a wireless router.|`|PmjeWyn2aa	I don't think that will work. Also, if you do connect your ps3 directly to your modem, I think that you need to contact your internet provider and have them reset your modem or something like that. Your best bet is to get a router. Get a good one though, such as a linksys. $50 should be enough.<br>  The only other option, besides a router, that I can think of, would for you to swithch your wire back and forth between your ps3 and your pc.

It has no blood or gore and it's mostly about strategy so he will have to use his brain causing him to get smarter and have fun. You might even play it your self.

It's a very fun, entertaining and interesting game.  Can be a little bit difficult at times but since your kid is smart, he should be able to understand it.<br>  <br>  I've never played Viva Pinata.  Sorry.|`|MUKhAsFzaa	It's rated E for everyone. A really nice physic game. Get it.|`|9auKzop0aa	It's a wonderful game, good and rated E|`|0e1e3b65b3c1de6ffdd4ebc197d8f144aa	Little big planet is for all ages although the narration makes u think its for little kids by the way he speaks. thers not much or no violence its just a game were u jump around over obstacles and figure out puzzles to get to the end of the level, and players can create their own levels and publish them online so everyone else can play and rate it. Its more fun to play with more than one player so maybe u could join him with another controller and u might find it intresting.|`|aROiy2Gnaa	First off it is Little Big Planet and it is a very good game no blood or anything and u could also play with him if  u want because it supports multiplayer and for viva pinate i have never played it|`|pl2SocVKaa	its actually littlebigplanet and its only on ps3 and viva pinata is only on 360 but yeah they are E so they are ok for his age

hXm1un0caa	It is easy to swap out the HDD on a PS3 but the 60GB console is the only console that can play ps2 games. There is no way of making the 40GB or 80GB PS3's play them as it is not a case of software but more of the standard hardware restraints on the consoles. The ps2 and ps3 both use completely different chip set types and so the backwards compatibility was sketchy at the least on the 60GB console and so they scrapped the whole ability to play ps2 games in newer models. There is a variant of the 80gb model that was just the 60gb with the bigger hard drive but these were only availible in the motorstorm and mgs4 special edition boxsets. I hope this helps and if you have any other questions let me know|`|3kgqmJ6Laa	bc has nothing to do with the size of the hard drive.  The old 80 gig models had software to play ps2 games.  the 20 and 60 gig models had a chip that allowed for around 98% ps2 play.  the 40 gig model was the one that started the non bc models.  they took out the software and cut the usb ports down to 2.  every model being sold now is that system....but with a bigger hard drive.|`|HekFanRvaa	and where will you buy it? do you know a store that sells Sony PS3 parts? wow, you should share that info with us!

There's a handy little slot for it that's accessible right on the back of the machine.<br>  <br>  That said, it might be hard to find the right HD, and another HD might not even solve the problem.  I know that the backwards compatibility issue with PS3 is firmware related - not sure if it's in the HD, or somewhere else within the box.<br>  <br>  Edit:<br>  For Gunman...it's a standard hard drive, and it can be replaced with just about anything.  I've heard the Seagate 360 gig drive is the most popular drive that's purchased as a replacement.

e8e0e4cc6750f11d7eebfe0f3af8eb0daa	You should receive more channels with the DTV box than you did before.  You should get all the same stations unless your antenna is inadequate.  You need to let the dtv box do a scan to find each broadcast stream.  It should give you a complete list when it's finished.  Each station can have more broadcast streams.  In other words, if you had a channel 7 in your area you could now have a channel 7-1 and 7-2.  Each station can have up to 4 separate broadcast streams, and maybe even more.  A couple of the channels in my area have 4 full programming streams plus a 5th music stream.  If you do a search for "digital tv channel listing", look for your town and see what station is offering what broadcast streams.|`|ULw1777caa	Pretty sure the same ones you pay for now.|`|e2NQUmusaa	You will get your Local stations that you receive with you antenna, or rabbit ears.

ABCD)  so u wont know what file song it is. <br>  and it would be a certin number of songs filed in different folders.<br>  i would copy all the folders over to ur computer or external harddrive.<br>  after its copied, highlight all the folders on ur pc , right click to properties, and uncheck "hidden files" so it can recognize it when u try to load it on to ur itunes.   if u have any questions, drop me a line.

Essentially, the white balance tells the camera what to interpret as white and it can balance the rest of the colors from there.|`|OdlhvQ4xaa	I agree with the other answers, but if you check in you cameras menu, you will find choices for your white balance, if you are in doors use tungsten or incandescent setting, this should do the tick for ya.

You can find ringtones like that on Blicer.com That's where I get my ringtones all the time. And if you can't find what you're looking for, you can message any of the top contributors and they'll find it or make it for you. Tell your friends & good luck!!|`|M1TgnTR6aa	search mp3 downloads..song TIDBITS!|`|lhzpq7ATaa	Try using Audacity to trim the audio file.|`|On57DVlAaa	Go to iTunes .. Right click the song ...

D0dcRRtMaa	The Voyager is exclusive to Verizon. If you get either of the blackberries, they come with a mandatory data package, which ranges from 30 to 50 dollars a month. The Voyager has no such package.<br>  <br>  It also depends what you are looking for in a phone. The curve is excellent for your everyday businessman. It wouldnt work for me, because i wouldnt want email and all that. I just liked the phone.<br>  <br>  I cant offer much on the Bold, as i have no experience with it.<br>  <br>  The Voyager is the multimedia lovers' phone. With its Vcast TV, Rhapsody, and other media outputs, including camera/camcorder it is a media based smartphone. I like the QWERTY keyboard, and the front touch screen, as well as the way it hinges sideways, and not up and down like conventional flip phones. I dont think you can buy the Voyager anymore, but you can get the LG Voyager in Titanium for around 149.99 after online or mail-in rebate, with a two year contract.<br>  <br>  If the Voyager is to pricy, i might suggest the Samsung Glyde. It is basically a Voyager, stripped of all the media accessories. Instead of flipping up, it slides. (or Glides) It still has the touch screen, and the full QWERTY keyboard, but it is much less simpler. Also alot cheaper. You can get it with Verizon for around 79.99 after online or mail-in rebate, with a two-year contract.<br>  <br>  You can see the Samsung Glyde here:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.verizonwireless.com/b2c/store/controller?item=phoneFirst&action=viewPhoneDetail&selectedPhoneId=3727" rel="nofollow">http://www.verizonwireless.com/b2c/store...</a><br>  <br>  If it helps any, this is almost the same situation i was in. I originally wanted the Blackberry Curve, but the 50 dollar monthly data package scratched that idea out.<br>  <br>  Then i decided on the Voyager. Right now i am just waiting for the price to go down, which i hope it does soon. If all else fails, Hello Samsung Glyde!<br>  <br>  I hope this was helpful to you,<br>  <br>  C17|`|8QiVEGNsaa	i'm verizon and i have a voyager, which i love. its the best phone i've ever had & if you do a lot of texting, you'd like it.

HekFanRvaa	dude, with the way your grades are looking right now, once you had a PS3, your grades will drop down to "Z". even without PS3, you are not doing good in school already. What more if you have one? Doing well in school doesn't necessarily mean an "A". It can be anything better than a "D". It's not a matter oF grades your parents are worried about. they're worried about your future because you are not showing some sense of responsibility with your studies. THERE IS NO WAY YOU CAN CONVINCE THEM UNLESS YOU SHOW SOME GOOD GRADES. Once you did that, you don't have to ask anymore. they will drag you to Bestbuy and reward you. Don't worry, PS3 will stay for another 10 years. And they are getting cheaper and better as years pass. <br>  Burn those brows and keeps those pages flippin' now!|`|aROiy2Gnaa	Playstation 3's r awesome and i have one but one thing u could tell ur parents if they have a nice HD TV u could tell them that they can also watch hD bluray movies at night when ur in bed that miight get to them after a while and besides in a couple month the ps3 price will go down i think|`|AA12041870	All you have to do is get decent grades to get this thing and you can't do that?  I don't blame your parents for not getting you one.  You may as well know that you have to work for everything you get in your life, s it's better if you start now.  If you don't get those A's, then when you get your own home, you can buy your PS3 then.|`|0AUTZt5Aaa	Are you serious???

Get those grades up even if you have to sacrifice TV and outside play for some time.|`|pl2SocVKaa	your just gonna have to dig deep and really pull in those good grades because thats the only way ask for extra credit and help from your teachers if you want to do better|`|ozWi3TJlaa	Well, if you had it, you'd probably do worse in school, not better.  Parents don't usually reward bad grades.  You ought to be able to pull your Ds up to at least Cs, and probably Bs if you get some help from your teachers.  As a parent, that would be the kind of effort I'd reward.|`|QxtdyNvgaa	so........... pull your grades up man!   you need to have good grades to get into college and you need a great future!<br>  <br>  im a ps3 freak and i still keep my grades up, never mess about and never bother my parents. <br>  <br>  education comes first and then ps3  gaming.<br>  <br>  <br>  when you pulled ur grades up,etc. then you can ask your mum for a ps3.|`|KQF5X9Vpaa	how about you try to do better in school...if your already doing bad and you get a PS3 then its just going to make things worse...you need an education in order to make it in this world now days so buckle down and get those grades up if you really want it so bad|`|o1pXRFtUaa	spend your money on a tutor or go for afterschool help.

Maybe its loading dishes into the dishwasher after dinner, or taking out the trash, being more tidy and respectful around the house. Your parents will begin to see this responsibility and perhaps will reward you - just don't forget to keep your grades up if you do get that PS3 or they may limit your play with it or just ground you from it....|`|7LWDRI2Uaa	Well of course it would be great for the whole family a PS3 is more than just a gaming system, it is an affordable blue ray player so its something everyone will enjoy. Also try being mature about the situation explain that you'll limit your use to 90 minutes a day ( or something reasonable like that) and should your schooling be affected you would stop using it entirely.|`|caTPi1e0aa	Well you need to assure that you won't get distracted from your homework when you have that PS3 because that is the main reason for most parents that they don't get their kids a console.|`|hSf8SgTuaa	Youre f-cked, and probably dont deserve it.

This is the same information you would use if you were configuring a laptop to use wireless.<br>  <br>  In the PS3's XMB menu, under Settings, you can configure the wireless settings.  Fill in the information and the PS3 should be able to establish a connection with your router and obtain the rest of the network settings (e.g. IP address, etc.)  Your PS3 is now online and able to access the internet.<br>  <br>  If you don't have a router, well....go get one.  They're like $30-40, and allow all computers in your house to connect to the internet at the same time.

HYrRkTjQaa	it is very much like the DS version. but there are good additions such as the city and being able to use ur mii in the game as ur central character. i bought both the DS 1st and love the wii one just as much :) there is more to do and u r able to celebrate xmas and easter in more traditional ways on the game. i would definitly buy it :)|`|9vLJbiHeaa	Shiz|`|bP5zyipXaa	its good teaches you a lot like paying your morgage , its fun|`|My0D4lmVaa	It's stunningly similar to the DS version, with not too many new features.<br>  <br>  However, if you REALLY liked it, to the point where starting over in a new version with more items, more events, and some new features sounds like a tantalising idea, go for it. I'd really reccomend it if you frequently play online with friends - WiiSpeak makes things a lot more fun.|`|17b959544fe5d0f04baabb39f366b6f5aa	It is just like the predecessor from the GameCube except you can talk to people online.  Boy I would hate to see the phone bill for that.|`|NlA4B6koaa	Its a really fun game. I like it and its the first and second game  but there is more stuff and its a lot more fun.|`|eYi3nAZKaa	i suggest you buy it. The quality of the game is high, there are fun new characters that can live in your town, brand new events for traditional holidays that are reflected onto the game [mothers day, groundhog day...]. The town you live in is a larger scale to that on the ds which is a bonus plus you can invite or visit other people's towns anywhere in the world if you have their friend code.<br>  All considered im genuinely pleased with the state of this game and currently is one of my top 5 for the console.<br>  <br>  But thats just my opinon, it'd really upto you<br>  :)|`|aRVYHsQ7aa	Animal Crossing is an awesome game.  And there are tons of people to play with over wifi.  <br>  <br>  You should go check out www.wiigameonline.com .. This is a site that allows safe trading of friend codes. You can find people to play and exchange codes with all times of the day.<br>  <br>  You can also buy the game right off the a link on the site!|`|GxaGHGBNaa	Updated remake of the DS version but still go ahead and get it.<br>  <br>  Animal crossing is actually called Animal Forest and was released on the N64 and then add on was added a year later.|`|dofUrFYAaa	Heyy peoplez...

syzUenkXaa	They can't handle it. Switch to Dish. Its really a leader in HD. One just needs to be patient and smart but you get the lowest priced programming across USA and that's guaranteed.|`|s7Muujxzaa	The problem is not bandwidth. Your locals are carried on Directv, just not in HD at this time (and there is nothing announced for Jackson MS for at leas the first half of this year).<br>  <br>  The problem is more complex and is in part due to lack of satellite transponders. They could start using mpeg4 on the current spot beam for that area for the standard def receivers in the area... but in doing so, they would disenfranchise all the Jackson people who only have standard def receivers.<br>  <br>  I would recomment that you consider connection an antenna to the OTA antenna port on your reciever and that way you will get your locals in high def along with all the other content Directv gives you.|`|vN4v4fR2aa	Chris is right about the bandwith. It takes a lot of data (a lot more than SD) to broadcast HD content, plus DirecTV has to integrate the local stations into their broadcast center's feeds, etc.  There is a lot involved in the process, and until the broadcast center gives an estimated date no CSR can do so.  Once the broadcast center gets a fix on it they'll start giving ETAs such as Spring, then center it to a month like April, then once the date is closer and they get a better handle on a date they can give you a specific day (like the 25th)|`|i9V7t3pRaa	Bandwidth.  A satellite provider can only support so many HD transmissions.  They don't have infinite ability to send whatever they want.  I am sure that's why I still don't have Travel Channel HD.<br>  <br>  Anyway - Dish Network isn't the answer either.  If satellite doesn't have what you want and you want local in HD - get an antenna or cable.|`|3Mnhvbrwaa	You're not the only one.  A lot of people are complaining about satellite providers (DirectTV and Dish) not offering HD local channels.  The only thing you can do right now is hook up an antenna and take advantage of the free HD broadcasts.  Or switch to cable.  There is no way of knowing when DirectTV will offer local HD.

Just spend some time looking around at everything in "account management" or in one of the system settings tabs.  <br>  <br>  If all else fails, you can call 18004MYXBOX, and see if they can do anything about it, but be prepared to get angry at whoever you are talking to.|`|vSTihS5uaa	I did the same thing sux but u gotta start over|`|TmDabvoIaa	you can change your gamertag. it'll cost you MS points to do it for some reason tho...

In my opinion the best stand-alone player is the Panasonic DMP-BD35.  It has good load time and features and is the only entry-level player that is able to decode HD audio.  The Sony BDP-S550 and Samsung BD-P2500 are also good.

Lift the rewind crank & turn until the film comes off the spool.  (You may need to hold the button down with doing this.)  After you're doing rewinding, lift the rewind crank straight up.  This will open the back & you can remove the film.

PNPqujCTaa	Hi,<br>  <br>  What "Little Dog" says is aslolutely true.<br>  <br>  To add to that, when Video Recorders first hit the market (around the early 70's)....crap.....gave my age away....... the Beta and VHS formats were in a war, as is now the DVD and BlueRay formats.<br>  <br>  Now, the first on the market was Beta.  It was manufactred by either Motorola or Magnavox.  Forget which one, but a US company none the less.<br>  <br>  They had the Patent.  Then, Sony developed (in short order, I might add) the VHS format which changed the record/playback head configuration so as to circumvent the US Patent.  So the war began.<br>  <br>  When I went shopping for my first Video Recorder I auditioned both formats side by side in record and as well as playback modes.  The winner, hands down, was the Beta.  Soooo much beter than the VHS.  That's what I bought, and I was sure that the Beta would win the "Format Wars" cause it was so superior to the whimpy VHS copy-cat recorder.<br>  <br>  I was wrong.  After about three years of going toe to toe in battle, Sony started selling the VHS machines at about half the cost of a Beta.  Knowing all the while they were loosing money (selling them for less than what it cost to make them) the VHS, for that reason alone, won out with the general public.<br>  <br>  What a shame.  The Beta was so much better.  But that's life and death in "Show Biz" and Marketing.<br>  <br>  Oh....Broadcast Stations and "off line editing houses" never gave up on the Beta format (cause it's so good).  Still in use today, both in the 2" tape, reel to reel format, and the 3/4" cassette, known as U-matic.<br>  db|`|3CJAUyqPaa	The cases are different sizes and the tapes are different widths. The tape cover (shutter) opens differently.

AA11056614	They all play Blu-ray movies more or less the same, so the differences are in the build quality/components, and in the features re extras and connectivity.<br>  <br>  First question is whether you are interested in on-line extras. If so you want a Profile 2.0 (BD Live) player. Otherwise if you are primarily interested in the movie and on-disk extras a Profile 1.1 player is fine.<br>  <br>  Second is whether on-player decoding of the HD audio formats is required (i.e. your 7.1 receiver doesn't do it  .. look for terms like decodes "DTS HD Master" and "Dolby True HD"). If you need it you want a player with discrete multi-channel analog outputs. But if you have a new receiver it probably does the decoding, so you just need to connect via HDMI (don't buy an expensive cable .. $10-$20 is fine).<br>  <br>  If you have lots of DVDs, and/or value CD sound you might want to look for players that do an exemplary job of upscaling DVD and have good CD performance. One of the best players is the Pioneer BDP51FD ... but it's not Profile 2.0. However, the techies at AVS Forum consider it the best as far as build quality, tweekability, Blu-ray and DVD video quality and CD reproduction. Others have rated the Panasonic and Sony players well ... but the Pioneer is better. You can buy at 6ave.com for $284 (See link). Current owners are grabbing them since this is a great price for a player almost identical to the $800 Pioneer Elite version.<br>  <br>  A few players (e.g. Samsung 2550 and PS3) will stream Netflix movies  as well as play disks. Samsung players have, arguably, had the most problems of the name brands. The PS3 is the most flexible player but is more expensive than most stand alone players, It uses much more power, needs a separate remote and while it's the fastest loading, DVD performance is mediocre.|`|5Wie7d3caa	Check out Abt Electronics. They have a good selection of Blu-ray players.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.abt.com/category/6/Blu-ray-DVD-Players.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.abt.com/category/6/Blu-ray-DV...</a>|`|8213dbb28238df28f026dac640239fb1aa	Does your surround sound system decode HD audio?  Can it handle multi-channel PCM?  If it doesn't decode HD audio then you should probably get a player that does.  I think the best player out there that does this is the Panasonic DMP-BD35.  The 2nd tier Sony and Samsung models do as well.  If you system does decode HD audio, then just get a well-reviewed player (Cnet, Consumer Reports, etc.) that is 2.0 compliant.

First, you will need an audio file or song in .mp3 format. You can email me if you need an .mp3 file for a specific song. Upload that song into Ventones. Once it is done loading, you will get to choose a 30 second segment from the song to be your ringtone. To make it sound more realistically like a ringtone, I would suggest choosing the one second fade at the end.<br>  <br>  Next, once the 30 second ringtone is done uploading, you will be given the options to either download the file to your computer, enter your phone number and have it sent in a text, or generate the download URL and enter it in your phone's web browser. (I would choose the last option to enter it into your phone's browser.)<br>  <br>  Once it is in your browser, it might get slow, just because the download files are setting up and all that stuff. It will automatically download (it's a very small file) in about a second or two. To find the file, go to your "My Music" section (name will vary based on carriers; just play with it a little) and set the song as RINGTONE. <br>  <br>  Congratulations, your song is a ringtone =)<br>  <br>  (Note: I'm not sure if you have to pay to download it because you're using the Internet.
