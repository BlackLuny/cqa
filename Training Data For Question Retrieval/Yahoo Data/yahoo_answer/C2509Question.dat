I wonder if I'm learning guitar the right, effective way.      Basically my daily learning sesion is like this: 5 hours of practice each day. with 2-3 breaks in between. I just practice the G major scale every day at a very slow tempo for hours, and slowly building up my speed (increase by 1bpm). and the next day I go back to the slow speed. I repeat it again and again, for weeks and week. I decided to master ONE thing at a time before learning songs and all the other stuffs at the same time. Next I'm gonna move on to other scales, chords, arpeggios.       :) any tips? suggestions on how should I learn guitar? thanks~!

Can you take them all the miles?  And then shred them into files?    Can up you listen to them pout?  Only to hear them shout?  Do you ever doubt where you truly stand  Among your very best friends?    Did you ever stop to think  Whether youre on the brink?  Or whether your friendships sink?

I made a guest list... and here is part two of my plan... rent a limo from 11:30pm - 2:30am.... a chrystler limo that seats 10 people... it's 65$/hour and for 3 hours it's 196$...  divide it by 10 people and it would cost everyone 20$ for a safe ride there and home...        I figured this because everyone will be drinking and the people who are going tend to always get plasterd!...       So is it wrong to ask everyone to fork up 20$ if they dont have to pay a cover to get in the club and what not?

In dusk my insides were laughing at the crackling leaves    I was the lone wolf    with the close skin of my brothers    and the waving hair of my sisters    we held hands    bumped shoulders in the forest    and all around us the kaleidoscope moved    to the music of our thoughts    and as the darkness began to creep through our skin   we emerged in a clearing    into the heavenly light of stars    dead and alive   on our faces like shadows    it was as if the gods reached out and touched us    reached out and kissed us    and like that    we became like animals    hooting, trilling and cawing at the moon    hugging each other    dancing    laughing    forever laughing    and all the darkness shivered
20090128155212AAKlO9n	Arts & Humanities;Books & Authors	To Kill A Mockingbird? (a question for people with the book)?	Can anyone with the book please cite (from the book) when:      Atticus told Scout why he is defending an African in court when he knows that he'll just lose the case.      I think it's on either page 74, 75, or 76 I just need to know what it says EXACTLY (cite it please).      This is for an essay and I need evidence from the book but I seem to have misplaced my book.      So if someone could please cite the part where Atticus tells Scout why he is defending an African in court when he knows that he'll just lose the case, it would be very helpful.      THANK YOU :)

20090128155256AAJlUtm	Arts & Humanities;Poetry	Any feedback? It would be appreciated.?	Paralyzed, she lies helpless and alone,   Frozen in her reveries of a love she's never known.   Love's not all she thought it was.   She lies there all alone. It's not sleep. It's not rest.   Broken. Cold.   Day by day she relives the misery.   Fade away. Tears she bleeds.   Tired of waiting.   Took too long to accept her flaws.   Too late now.   Your nightmares are her sweetest dreams.   Frozen over is her heart, covered in sheets of ice.   Falling fast on to the pavement. Hear is shatter.   Hear is crack. Shards of glass   Pierce through her skin.   This fallen angel lies alone tonight.   See the sunight glisten through her broken wings?   Your demons sing her to sleep again   Your lullabies of worthlessness echo in haunting whispers.   Oh! The agony that drowns her.   Emotions flood her existence. Clouds of grey surround her.   Your nightmares are her sweetest dreams.   Catpure her. Imprison her. Take her   And rape her of her hope.   Take everything away. Numbness.   She doesn't want to feel the pain much longer.   Pick upher fragile and torn soul...   Can you hold her withoutbreaking her?   Caution: Handle with care.   You don't care, do you? Won't save her in the end.   Only hurt her; you're her self-destructive cause.   Frightened. Anxious. How much longer?   Impatience. Darkness creeps upon her. Paralyzed.   Caught up in her bitterly-sweet dream. Taste it on her lips.   When will she awake? With your Judas kiss?   She knows your true intention; quit hiding it.   Why so much effort to deceive her.   She'll never be able to believe.   You don't care for her good. It's all on you.   And your worst nightmares are her sweetest dreams.   She's left there all alone, dreaming of a love she's never known.

I don't write poems that often, when I do I just post them here because I don't think I could/want to show it to anyone that I know.       Blue Collar Revolution!      Like drumbeats to the sound of murder,    Our footsteps perturbed the snow,    Sliding slightly, out worn out, gripless shoes propel us further,   We walk together, a demonstration of sorts against the capitalists that have deprived us of our rights and dough.      Some chanting like sages in the name of love,   Some screaming 'f*ck the power' with impassioned tongue,   Bound by common purpose, here united come the lost generation, we've stepped out of Plato's cave much thanks to the god above.   Up leading the front row, Tyler Durdens screams "No more!", there he goes bombing up corporations self righteously, helping us recognize that we don't have our freedom anymore - none.      Buying sh*t that we don't need, people scared of people they don't care about, this whole social system has been designed to put the average man down,   Watch now as reverse Darwinism prevails, a lesser evolved species equipped better to survive,   We are the reason that you now frown, here we come burning down credit card companies, and soon you'll be watching your billion dollar house burn down.       A country of enslaved men, punished for the single sin of a singel man,   We're pissed of, mad, enraged as f*ck, we come to realize now, that we suffer because you wanted to make a quick buck.   The vision of this revolution is the reason why you wake up screaming 'Damn!'      As the lost generation grows older, it grows wiser too,    They're finally realizing that you capitalists are the reason they toss and turn in bed at night,   Capitalists, you're climbing up on the bones of the collars of blue,   Hear, hear, now: the higher yoou climb, the harder the blue collars knock you down, does this image not fill you with fright?      The day is comine, when they knock you down,   Hark, it is now five minutes to midnight, the time to revolt is right!!!

20090128163352AAVxa11	Arts & Humanities;History	When did US Schools stop issuing history textbooks?	I see so many questions asked in this section that SHOULD be able to be answered by simply looking in the index of a High-School or Junior High School History textbook.      Here we are with kids SUPPOSED to be computer literate and they can't even do a Google search themselves ?? Do remember that according to "community guidelines" everyone should be over the age of 13... or with a 8th grade education.  Not to mention the atrocious spelling and grammatical errors.      GIVEN the fact that so many of the questions are asked in a "multiple-guess" format, I'm assuming that kids aren't doing their homework.  I honestly refuse to answer a question in that format.      Is there any question as to WHY the US is sliding down the tubes ?

20090225143043AAuFW7b	Arts & Humanities;Books & Authors	How do you like my book so far?	This is what i have typed so far. tell me your opinion.    (first paragraph is kinda slow and boring because that's how the girl feels.)         A Fight for Freedom   By: Meagan      The sturdy beat of the clock rang in my ears, I could hear the ticks, but I never saw the arms move. The day felt like eternity. I couldn’t wait to get out of this school. And I couldn’t wait to be a freshman either. The clock struck 3:40. School was out for the summer. The room filled with happiness, and loud cheers. I held my ears. I wasn’t one of the rowdy kids. I was more of the shy, quiet type. But school was a lot less…dramatic like that.   I packed my things into my blue backpack, and took off out of the room in a hurry. I knew my big brother would be waiting for me in the car. Once I got out of the school, his car was right there. I jumped into the passenger seat, and he took off.    “How was the last day?” he asked with careless eyes. I knew he was just trying to start conversation.   “Good, how was your last day of High school?” I asked, with real wonder in my eyes. If you couldn’t tell, I couldn’t wait one more second till I was in high school.   “Same as everyday of high school. Boring.” He said, and then chuckled. He was my best friend, and he was leaving for college in a few months. So I had to spend lots of time with him this summer.   The car pulled into the driveway. I hopped out. And I felt the feeling of freedom rush through my veins. Finally free of constant work. The only thing that really bothered me was that I hadn’t had a boyfriend, in the past 6 months. It was kind of depressing. I was too smart for the boys at school. Even though I had blonde hair and blue eyes, I wasn’t like most of the girls with blue eyes and blonde hair, who straightened their hair everyday, and wore gorgeous makeup. My mom won’t let me straighten my hair because “my hair is pretty the way it is,” or, “it will ruin your hair,” Either way, it was still stupid. And my dad says he wont let me even touch makeup till I’m 16.   I walked into the front door of my house. My mom sat at the table. Looking at a paper. Her eyes were swelled.    “Mom, are you okay?”   She looked up from the paper and nodded her head, signaling a no.   “Your brother isn’t going to college, he is going into the army.”   I caught my breath. I was astonished. I would have never thought that my big brother would have the guts even to sign up for the army. I was surprised and mad at the same time. He had never told me that he was leaving. He usually told me everything. But this time was different. I felt betrayed. I felt like he told everyone about this…but me.    Things between him and I would be different now.    Justin walked into the room.   “Hey Ma… What’s wrong?” he said while wiping a tear from her eye.   I looked at him like he was stupid. “ You never told us you were going to the Army, we thought you were going to the college a few miles away,” while I said this, tears streamed from my eyes, “ you lied Justin.”   “ Eliza, I didn’t lie! I was gonna go to the college, but I can do so much better in the army! I’m not smart enough to go to college!”   He wasn’t being the same. I got up and gave mom a hug, and left the room. I didn’t want to talk to Justin.      My room was dark, and the window was cracked. It let in cool streams of wind, and the sounds of crickets playing tag. My TV lit up the room, and didn’t make it feel so lonely. Justin left few hours back to take a spin in his Truck, he was not happy.

The water is still, blue, and clear.   The clouds gently roll by,   Casting shadows on the cold green grass.      I slowly lay down.   The grass is cool and relaxing.   You lay down next to me and smile.   Your smile is so lovely.   The most beautiful thing in my world.       You hold my hand gently.   Your fingers slowly weave through mine   And you hold my face in your smooth palm.   Your lips have a smile on them.       It is a smile that sets my world alight.    Before you,   My life was dull and dreary.   But then you came into it.   Your eyes ever so green,   And your hair the fairest of brown.      But your smile was the one thing that I noticed.    It was the smile that kept me going when I was sad.   It was you that held me when I needed to cry,   And it was you who gave me my first kiss.   You are my gift in life.    My love for you will never change,   Never be broken.   Every promise will be kept.   Every smile is one we will share.       And when you need me and I need you,   We will always be there for each other.   You are my center, my world, my love.        Thanks!
20090128163245AAZUS6I	Arts & Humanities;Poetry	What do you think of my prose poem-about my baby sister?	White Daisy         My sister, as fresh as the season that blooms, explores the world around her. I watch as she takes in the colors of the wildflowers, the sound of the babbling brook, and the smell of sweet, fresh grass. This is the most beautiful moment a big sister will treasure- to see her discover the wonders that is life. This fills me with overwhelming joy. My sister, with the innocence of a budding, white daisy, smiles at me with delight. My heart sings along with the birds in the trees, for I know another human being could not make me happier.         *It's the very first one I've written. I know it isn't great, but I like it. I enjoyed writing it. Feel free to suggest changes or give advice

20090128162502AAeqXfQ	Arts & Humanities;Books & Authors	Would you continue reading? Should I make it more interesting?	What Had Happened  "Hey, you." Jason said as I opened the door and he walked in. "Are you still going to Jenna's party on Saturday?" Jason asked me. Jenna is Jason's sister. They're both my best friends.  "Probably not." I replied. "Riley and I have a date, remember?"  "Come on, you two have been hanging out all week, you can't skip one date to come to you're best friend's party?" He gave me the puppy dog eyes. I hate the puppy dog eyes.  "Fine, fine. I'll go."  "YAY!" He screamed so loud I was sure the whole neighborhood heard him. Then he jumped up and down with excitment and hugged me.  "Jason! Would you stop that and get off of me?"  "Fine, I'm going home to tell Jenna you're coming."  "Oh, wait, before you go, that book you wanted is down in the basement." I said.  "Okay, let me go get it and then I gotta head back to my place. Jenna wants me set up the party stuff. And by party stuff, I mean beer." He gave me a wink.   "How are you going to buy beer? You're only 17."  "I hired Bob to do it!"  "You hired that hippy to buy beer for you?" I gave him 'the look'. I always gave him that look when he was about to do something I didn't like.   "Don't talk trash about Bob. He comes in handy, you know."   When he came back up, I opened the door for him. Then something totally unexpected happened. He kissed me. We've been friends forever, and we've never felt anything towards each other... or atleast, I hadn't. We always playfully winked at each other or gave friendly hugs, but never kissed.  "Uhm..." we both said at the same time.  "I better get going," he said.   "Yeah, you should."  --------------------------------------...  The Next Week At School  The bell rang. I walked up to my locker and opened it. I grabbed my Geography textbook, when I noticed a note sitting there. I didn't remember that being there. I opened it up:    I know about your little kiss last Wednesday with Jason, and if you don't do exactly as I say, I will tell. Come to the coffee shop tomorow at 3:30, and sit at the table by the piano. There will be a note under the foot of one of the chairs. Do what it says, and I just might keep your two timing secret.     How could anybody know about the kiss? The door was opened when he kissed me, but I didn't see anyone outside after I left. And since when did somebody know my locker combination? I've only told Jenna, Jason and Riley, incase they wanted to leave a note for me. No... did Jason tell Jenna about our kiss? Yeah, that's probably it. She's probably just playing a joke on me. Then, out of nowhere, Jason walked up to me. "Hey Jenna, did you find my note?"  "You wrote that? Why?"  "Because I need your math notes."  "Wait... what?" I was totally confused.   "I left you a note asking you for your math notes." The bell rang. "Hurry!" he said. I handed him my notes. "Thanks," he said, then hurried back to class. Just like he said, I saw a note.     Hey, Katie, let me borrow your math notes. I left mine at home.  -Jason    --------------------------------------...

20090225142418AATKJzB	Arts & Humanities;Books & Authors	Have you ever looked back on an answer and discovered a mistake?	I was looking back on an answer I gave about 'The Lord of the Rings', and was completely aghast by a very blatant mistake.  I said that Tolkien fought in World War II.  That is factually impossible.  He fought in World War I.  Unfortunately, the question was resolved.  Worse yet, I got BA.  Now it is stuck there as a monument to my stupidity.  I should pat myself on the back.      Well, after that, I was wondering if anyone else has done something similar?

Hello Mrs. Blue Eyes   Look to the skies   A whole life's fortune in disguise   Two steps forward, One step back   This is the rule to avert it's demise      Mrs. Blue Eyes look at you   Beauty beyond vi-irtue    The look on your face shows you haven't a clue   All this remains when the days anew      Hello Mrs. Blue Eyes   Look to the skies   A whole Life's fortune in disguise   Two steps forward, one step back   This is the rule to avert it's demise      Now Mrs. Blue Eyes   Take him by the hand   Show him he's the mand   Throw away the plan   Mrs. Blue Eyes get out of this wasteland!   Mrs. Blue Eyes to take your final vacation!

20090128154859AAHGBKM	Arts & Humanities;Poetry	I wrote a poem. What do you think again?	The love of our lives.   A title, to hear.   A mock of emotions,   Since no love appears.      Of who weakens when loves,   Is sure to be blessed.   While of those who are hidden,   With fear in their chests.      Here I stand, arms wide.   Gracious to feel.   My mind is soaring.   My heart has been healed.      To be broken.   To be lost within round.   I'm yours for the taking,   As soon as I'm found.      Any better? I'm 13, so I take critisizms wisely.

Could I have your opinion?  Do you think its cliche or cheesy?  Please be honest!  It's ok to say it sucks!      The days have never felt warmer   Nor the sunlight tasted so sweet   The days cry out for the night   And the sky mingles with the earth      Love burns on the skin   And passion runs so deep in the blood   That your every movement is fluid and natural   Like the flow of the sea      Every moment is a conquest   Every kiss a dance of victory   Till your very soul grows wings   And your heart flows from your mouth      The scent of love   Is like that of a rose   And it has the feel   Of sand beneath bare feet      Your thoughts are consumed   And your senses brought to life   Like a flower opening its petals   Or a fruit leaking its nectar      To wash one’s hands of material love   And submit to the inner confines    Of freedom in another’s arms   Is to glimpse the garden of eternity      You realize what you’ve always wanted   And what is the reason you are living

Ok, I am writing something, and I have all the names expect for one: my lead male. I already have the perfect name for my female; Stevie Rebecca Kruse (I love that name!) But I can't decide on the perfect first name for my male, I have a last name that I may or may not use, Perry, but please include full names just so I can look into it. These names have to be quirky, because that is what my two characters are. Like Paulie Bleeker and Juno from the movie Juno. So far I have gone through Dave, Conner, Luke, and some more I can't remember... but none of  them seem to fit him or are funny enough or I like enough.

20090128101151AATvrW0	Arts & Humanities;Poetry	What advice/criticism/praise would you offer this poem?	Now that I'm finally catching up   The pain in my heart hurts the rest of my parts.   You're here to remind me I'm not good enough,   Making sure I know that the going gets rough.      I'll fall like a tree when you cut me down,   When you dig up my roots and kick me around,      You never thought I'd fall like that,   You never hurt me enough for the pain to last.   But you did it this time, boy. Be proud.    The pain you unwrapped left me screaming aloud.      Cut me deep then throw me away,   Pour salt in the wound if the pain won't stay.   Kicking and screaming, I'll meet my end-   With your name on my grave and my heart in your hand.
20090128162326AAMHygY	Arts & Humanities;Books & Authors	Does anyone know the name of this book? DIFFERENT QUESTION?	I read this book while I was in middle school and really liked it, but I can't remember the name of it. Storyline is as follows:      A white girl is kidnapped and adopted into a Native American family. After staying there a while, she learns their language and pretty much becomes one of them. There are two women she lives with. One is kind and caring, but the other one beats her if she speaks English or tries to remember anything from her life with her family. A group goes into a local town about a year or two after she is captured, but the English colonists try to take her back when they realize she isn't one of the Indians (the blonde hair gave her away). I can't remember the ending, but I really want to find this book again

20090128161227AAQuJzg	Arts & Humanities;Philosophy	What do you think of this?	The future is capricious to human prediction, leaving only the pursuit of pleasure as an absolute for self gratification. Not engaging in hedonism only leaves one as a means for another to gormandize for their own satisfaction. This is why nature makes everyone an egoist, as a means to sustain life. Egoism is the only absolute.

20090128161723AA8nEB3	Arts & Humanities;Theater & Acting	Does anybody have any experience with vocal training or something along those lines?	I've been singing since I was four [I'm 16 now]. Not in front of an audience or anything-- just in my living room using a karaoke machine that my parents bought for me. And I've never had a vocal coach or anything; I just sing as a hobby in my spare time. I absolutely love singing and I'm not completely terrible either. I just notice that I don't have a very consistent voice. Sometimes I'll be singing a song and halfway through my voice will just become raspy or shaky. But it's sudden and unexpected and completely random. How could I strengthen my voice so it will be  more smooth and consistent?? Would drinking tea regularly be beneficial? Again, I don't sing in front of an audience; I never have. I'm just trying to improve my voice so I'LL be happier with it.         thank you so much, in advance. =)

On the internet it is the anti-Jewish sites that seem to rant madly on without giving hard facts to back up their scary claims. But it seems to be the Jewish sites that actually give specific, factual rebuttals to these 'Illuminati-type' conspiracy theories.      So I am wondering, is there a conspiracy against the Jews? And if so, why?       Why would some serious people deny that Hitler's Nazi psychopaths murdered millions of people unless there is an organised Jew-hate campaign?

20090128172057AAzAv4Y	Arts & Humanities;Books & Authors	My book ideas. Let me know how you feel?	heres another selction of my ideas.      Idea#1: this is weird but so are all my books.    Ok so the book is based 50years into the future. our economy is doing better but not great. global warming is our biggest problem. so one day the goverment realeases info that they have been building a spaceship since the first travelled into space. this spaceship has 45gigitons of propulsion and they think it will be able to reach Pluto in approx. 20 years. The most perfessoniol astronauts go on the trip. as they blast off, the book turns and tells about life on earth and the astronauts families. after the spaceship pasts jupiter, Nasa loses communication with the spaceship. the astronauts experiance many problems. then nasa gets a message from the spaceship that says chzzzz wchzzzz eeeee chzzz foun chzzzzaszzz heav chezzaz en chzzzzz. the communication is then lost. i dont want to reveal anymore.      Idea#2: tHIS IS A LITTLE BIT LIKE A SHORT STORY that i forgot the name of. anyway. the book is about a family that travels to Ranko toko, it is an island far off the coast of hawaii. the family goes there on vacation. the family is then abducted and brought to a warehouse in the jungle. there are 4 other families tied up. there are also alot of old man in the room. there is a stage and a podium.   i dont want to reveal anymore because it will ruin the story.         Idea#3: in a future militaristic america, the u.s govermant picks out 300 17year olds at random. they are then brought to a mall. every citizen is watching because this is a type of sport. The kids are then realeased into the mall. they have 1hour to hide and gather supplies. after one hour, a type of swat team bashes in the mall and shoots any teenage they see. the last one left wins.         Idea#4: a drugged out teenage is driving home from a party. he is then hit by a car and goes flying off the freeway. he goes into a coma for 4years. when he wakes up, he has pyrokenisis and telekenisis. he then abuses these powers.      Idea#5: The woman in the world all of a sudden can not reproduce. the earth then goes looking for the last pregnant woman. there is a woman in africa who lives deep in the forest. a hunter sees her and then tells everyone. she doesnt want her baby to be killed and she runs away.         i am only 13 i just thought of these ideas now so dont be so critical. let me know which one is the best, which one you like, which one is not good, which one i should finish, which one can be made into a movie. thanks alot guys

These are the book I love the most:   Twilight Saga (fave!)   Hunger Games (heart)  Graceling (love)  Narnia (can't live without it)  Princess Diaries (and most of Meg Cabot's books)   Books of Tamora Pierce (all)  Nobody's Princess (and sequel)   Inside Girl       So you see the problem that I have read so many books that I don't know what to do anymore.

20090128163751AAKIvRN	Arts & Humanities;Philosophy	What does it mean for something to be "important"? ?	Also, how do we determine something be more "important" than something else. For instance, if I were to say that love is more important than hate; or, if I were to say that person "A" is more important than person "B" how does a person determine this?      By the way, I'm asking this as a philosopher not as a general question I wish some else to answer for me. This question, I think, should be thought about an answered with good reason for me to believe your answer.

20090128164809AAfbGCr	Arts & Humanities;Books & Authors	Does this sound okay? Is it interesting? Would you read the rest?	What Had Happened   "Hey, you." Jason said as I opened the door and he walked in. "Are you still going to Jenna's party on Saturday?" Jason asked me. Jenna is Jason's sister. They're both my best friends.    "Probably not." I replied. "Riley and I have a date, remember?" Riley's been my boyfriend for about 3 months now. He's sweet and caring, and can even be funny sometimes.   "Come on, you two have been hanging out all week, you can't skip one date to come to you're best friend's party?" He gave me the puppy dog eyes. I hate the puppy dog eyes.   "Fine, fine. I'll go."   "YAY!" He screamed so loud I was sure the whole neighborhood heard him. Then he jumped up and down with excitment and hugged me.   "Jason! Would you stop that and get off of me?"   "Fine, I'm going home to tell Jenna you're coming."   "Oh, wait, before you go, that book you wanted is down in the basement." I said.   "Okay, let me go get it and then I gotta head back to my place. Jenna wants me set up the party stuff. And by party stuff, I mean beer." He gave me a wink.    "How are you going to buy beer? You're only 17."   "I hired Bob to do it!"   "You hired that hippy to buy beer for you?" I gave him 'the look'. I always gave him that look when he was about to do something I didn't like.    "Don't talk trash about Bob. He comes in handy, you know."    When he came back up, I opened the door for him. Then something totally unexpected happened. He kissed me. On the lips. Somehow, I knew it wasn't a playful one. We've been friends forever, and we've never felt anything towards each other... or atleast, I hadn't. We always playfully winked at each other or gave friendly hugs, but never actually kissed. Plus I was going out with Riley now... why would he do this?   "Uhm..." we both said at the same time.   "I better get going," he said.    "Yeah, you should."   --------------------------------------...   The Next Week At School   The bell rang. I walked up to my locker and opened it. I grabbed my Geograph textbook, when I noticed a note sitting there. I didn't remember that being there. I opened it up:      I know about your little kiss last Wednesday with Jason, and if you don't do exactly as I say, I will tell. Come to the coffee shop tomorow at 3:30, and sit at the table by the piano. There will be a note under the foot of one of the chairs. Do what it says, and I just might keep your two timing secret.       How could anybody know about the kiss? The door was opened when he kissed me, but I didn't see anyone outside after I left. And since when did somebody know my locker combination? I've only told Jenna, Jason and Riley, incase they wanted to leave a note for me. The note is probably from Jason. The kiss was probably just a joke he wanted to play on me. Then, out of nowhere, Jenna walked up to me.   "Hey, Katie, did you find my note?"   "You wrote that? Why?"   "Because I need your math notes."   "Wait... what?" I was totally confused.    "I left you a note asking you for your math notes." The bell rang. "Hurry!" she urged. I handed her my notes. "Thanks," she said, then hurried back to class. Just like she said, I saw a note.       Hey, Katie, let me borrow your math notes. I left mine at home.    -Jenna      --------------------------------------...

She is such a snot! She is totally rubbing it in Jane's face that she is 16 and married and Jane is 23 and not married. And she is always showing off her new husband and he is obviously WAY less in love with her than she is with him. Anyone agree?

No one see's the flower trembling in the rain.   It pounding forcefully on it's weakened stem.      Damaged.      The flower collapses against it's own weight.   Returning to the earth, in which it came.      Gone.

20090128171155AAYghIj	Arts & Humanities;Books & Authors	I've forgotten the title of this fantasy book. Please help?	I'm trying to remember a book that I really enjoyed, except it's been years and years. It's definitely a fantasy book. I think there was a unicorn on the cover, and other fantastical stuff...      Here's what I remember what happened in the beginning.      A girl (the protagonist) is being "chased" by a man somewhere near the beginning, but don't get me wrong, he doesn't have bad intentions. He needs to tell the girl something, because he called, "Wait!" at her. Anyway, the girl runs up the stairs to the top level of a clock tower, or some similar building. The girl looks down at the concrete sidewalk, feet and feet below her. The guy calls, "Wait!" or something at her, and the girl jumps to get away from him.  She braces for impact, but instead she goes right through the sidewalk into a fantasy land! and she lands in a beautiful meadow or something...   Does this sound familiar?   If it rings ANY bell whatsoever, tell me here. Even if it reminds you of Harry Potter, say it!      Thanks!!
20090128164012AAHPQrG	Arts & Humanities;Performing Arts	Summarize romeo&juliet..!?	Okay so we read the play Romeo and Juliet in English, and we have finals coming up. But the thing is, the play was SO long, and I always have so   much on my mind that I forgot most of it. I know the main idea. Romeo&Juliet meet at a party thing and fall in love. But Romeo's family (the Montagues) and Juliet's family (the Capulets) and enemies so they cant tell their family and they have to sneak off together. They get married in less than 24 hrs of meeting. Romeo is 16, Juliet is 13, almost 14. (if any of that is wrong, please correct me!)      I was wondering if you could summarize each Act??

Rain      It comes in the night,   Heavy and hard,   It wakes me from my dreams,   I open my window and breathe in the scent of it,   It makes me feel high and giddy,   But then I realize what it brings,   Some it is death and pain,   For others it is life and happiness,   Rain is truly an amazing thing,   For it is a curse and a miracle,   To us.

20090128181655AA53Tvc	Arts & Humanities;Philosophy	Why, as we get older, does life gets less exciting?	It seems like back in the day when we were 5 and 6, everything was exciting. Christmas was the best day of the year, the first day of school was incredible, making decisions was something we loved, and everything around us was awesome.   it seems that as I get older, things become much less exciting. When I was younger, going to college seemed like an adventure, like the time of my life. Now...I have no idea how to decide which to go to and what I'm going to do when I get there.   I can't help but wonder if anything will be exciting again...   It seems like life can be a big drag   of course there are some things that are still exciting in my future:   love, marriage, kids, buying a house...   but all of those seem so stressful and unpredictable...

20090128180114AAAe6XV	Arts & Humanities;Books & Authors	Would this prologue draw u in and make u want to read this story?	I was not your typical college freshman.  I was eighteen years old and still a virgin.  I had only kissed two boys in my entire lifetime.  I valued my virginity and I valued myself.  Most of my closest friends were also virgins.  You know that saying “Birds of a feather flock together”, well in my case that served true.  All of my closest friends were very smart and were heading places.  Most of us were still virgins.   I looked down on the females who openly had no sense of self worth.  I remember being in high school and hearing girls brag about what they did last night and how good it felt or how if their dude wasn’t doing it right then they will just go out and find someone who would.  I always wondered how they could think that way.  Not to mention what I heard the boys saying.  I would be sitting in class and behind me all I heard was “I beat that joint last night”, referring to having sex with a female or, “That hoe aint nothing but she got that good good.”  Those types of comments were the key forces to making sure I stayed grounded.  I would never ever let a boy devalue my character.     As a freshman in college, I had a new type of freedom.   I could virtually do what I wanted and had no one to report to.   I could stay up as late as I wanted without anybody telling me I should go to bed.  I could leave and come as I pleased.  I could go out partying without constant calls asking where I was and when I would be home.  Life was sweet.   Before I knew it, I had finished my first semester in college.  I achieved a decent 3.3 GPA and was feeling good.  Now, I could let loose a little bit.  The last couple weeks of the semester was consumed with studying for finals, so my girls and I didn’t get the opportunity to party as regularly as we liked; that and the fact that it was extremely cold outside.  But since the semester was over and we had two weeks to chill for Christmas break, we were going to fight that cold and get the partying in.  Come 2007, we would have to crack back down and become school oriented all over again.    “Ya’ll tryna go to Club Envy tonight?” Natalie, my second roommate and friend asked.     “I’m down” I replied.    “Me too “Essence also replied.     “Cool, we need to be ready by nine, I want to catch the early shuttle there” Natalie informed us.     Natalie was the more adventurous friend.  She came from a very conservative family so when she partied, she partied hard.     The clock struck eight and we started to get ready for our evening.  I put on my infamous outfit which was a black halter top with a hole in the breast area and a pair of tight jeans.  I finished up the outfit with my infamous black, calf length casual boots and my pleather jacket.  While I was modest in character, I loved to show my body.  My motto was “If you got it, flaunt it”.  I had it so I flaunted it.  Essence did all of our makeup.  She was the fashionista of the crew, the model chick.  Once we all finished getting ready, we left out and hopped on the shuttle to the club.   “Wow, the club is going to be popping” Essence said as we pulled up to a warehouse looking building with lines all the way down the street.     “Ohhh shoot” I responded, “I might get me a man tonight.”    Essence and Natalie giggled.  We stepped out of the shuttle looking cute as ever and headed to the end of the long line.  It was freezing cold.   We finally made it to the front of the line.  We showed our Howard University id for free admission and received that big black X that indicated we were under twenty one.  I hated that X, it messed up the flow of my ensemble.   We stepped into the club and posted up in the middle of the floor dancing among ourselves.  That is how we normally started our adventures in the club until one by one we would be grabbed up by a boy in which most time I rejected.     I surveyed my surroundings as I always did, looking to see the fine boys there.  It was dark so you had to strain your eyes because what looks good in the dark aint always good in the light, that’s true stuff.  I immediately noticed two dudes on the floor, something about dreads and a fitted hat always captured my attention.  One dude was about my height and the other was fairly tall.  That is where my eyes kept wandering to during the majority of the night.  The short one was always dancing with someone, and the tall one just stood there looking cool.     Not before long the shorter one grabbed Natalie up and they began to dance.  Natalie put in work while dancing with him.  She was bent over touching the floor.  She was shaking her behind so hard you would think she was about to break something.  I was looking at her, shaking my head as I always did.  In the back of my mind I was hoping his taller friend would pull me so we can dance but he just stood there looking cool.  I liked that.  Once Natalie finished freaking the boy he got her phone number.  Then he leaned over and whispered in my ear, “Was your friend sheltered as a child?”    I giggled

20090128175019AA3B7oC	Arts & Humanities;Theater & Acting	Does being a naturally emotional person makes that person a good actor?	As in being someone who is able to cry or laugh, or feel angry naturally with control...(like bringing the emotions of the past back to life)..      Rather than generic reciting of scripts and looking at other people (famous actors) at how they physical portray emotions..      By the way i worked as an extra for few ads and was thinking that i would make a good actor since i have so many emotions concealed./hidden in me as well as high level of self-control for it.   like making tears come out /or eyes water without saying anything or making silly crying noises..         ..Personally for me when it comes to me showing my emotions to other people in real life, I'm afraid to show it and than i end up learning to control/hide my feelings.      But once i get into character I feel its gives me the chance to express the characters certain emotions.

It's like looking through a one way mirror,   No one seems to care,   But when they need a shoulder to cry on,   You're expected to be there.      No one round to listen,   While your life falls apart at the seams,   You might as well be far away,   No one hears your screams.      Do they know that your daddy left,   While you were tucked in bed last night?   He couldn't handle mummy taking her life,   But they didn't see you cry,   Instead they come to you in tears,   Cos they got pudgy thighs.      Now you sit on your bed at midnight,   Pouring out your little heart,   But You know there's not enough time,   To clean yourself up,   Before your next act,   Your little sister pokes her head around the door,   She sees your tear stained eyes,   She doesn't have to say a thing,   Cos she's also been through so much,   You can both sit and cry.

What are some limitations of the steel guitar when used to play classical music? Would having a dreadnought steel string be a problem in playing in the classical position?      If the number of problems vs. benefits of playing classical music on a steel guitar is too great, would I get better results from replacing the steel strings with nylon?      Sorry for all the questions, thank you very much!

A Clear Midnight               THIS is thy hour O Soul, thy free flight into the wordless,   Away from books, away from art, the day erased, the lesson done,   Thee fully forth emerging, silent, gazing, pondering the themes thou   lovest best.   Night, sleep, and the stars.       Walt Whitman            I think it means the day is done, you don;t have to think about anything except going to sleep and dreaming.   but im not really sure   please help me

20090128175829AAGvcF1	Arts & Humanities;Poetry	What kind of poem is On Turning Ten by Bill Collins?	On Turning Ten               The whole idea of it makes me feel   like I'm coming down with something,   something worse than any stomach ache   or the headaches I get from reading in bad light--   a kind of measles of the spirit,   a mumps of the psyche,   a disfiguring chicken pox of the soul.      You tell me it is too early to be looking back,   but that is because you have forgotten   the perfect simplicity of being one   and the beautiful complexity introduced by two.   But I can lie on my bed and remember every digit.   At four I was an Arabian wizard.   I could make myself invisible   by drinking a glass of milk a certain way.   At seven I was a soldier, at nine a prince.      But now I am mostly at the window   watching the late afternoon light.   Back then it never fell so solemnly   against the side of my tree house,   and my bicycle never leaned against the garage   as it does today,   all the dark blue speed drained out of it.      This is the beginning of sadness, I say to myself,   as I walk through the universe in my sneakers.   It is time to say good-bye to my imaginary friends,   time to turn the first big number.      It seems only yesterday I used to believe   there was nothing under my skin but light.   If you cut me I could shine.   But now when I fall upon the sidewalks of life,   I skin my knees. I bleed.       Billy Collins

20090128180253AAmBqXz	Arts & Humanities;Theater & Acting	Pursuing an acting career?	Hey everyone,      I'm an 18 year old college student finishing up the second semester of my Freshman year. I've tested the waters for about 6 months now and I'm honestly not sure if this is the path I want to be taking. The only reason why I say that is because I've always known I've wanted to pursue acting since I was younger. Ever since I can remember I've been engulfed in television and movies -- now I think I'm old enough to start making my dream a reality.      I've heard stories of several actors who had left for Los Angeles on their own at age 18 to continue working on acting careers. I'm wondering if I should take the risk myself and see if it'll work for me. College seems more like a chore than a process of gaining my career. I'm not trying to take the easy way out or anything, it's just that I don't see the sense in spending so much money in an education just to get a job that I might not enjoy as much as I would if I were to become an actor.       I've brought the idea up to my family, and as you can understand, they weren't very supportive. People tend to see acting as a hobby and not a real job unfortunately. I'm sure they won't let me fly all the way out to L.A., but then again I know that I should be following what I feel is right.      To keep this somewhat short, I have no idea what to do. Any actors out there who have been through this or even casting directors that can lend some friendly advice? I've been battling with this for a while and could really use some help. Helpful advice only, please.      Thanks.

20090128181722AAD5mlM	Arts & Humanities;Poetry	Can anyone suggest a good poem for me to recite in the PoetryOutLoud contest?	I enjoy public speaking but I'm not very well-versed in much poetry, or rather I haven't found any poems that particularly pique my desire to read them aloud.   The organization's website is here www.poetryoutloud.org and I may only recite poems from their list.   Can anyone suggest to me a specific poem or author that would fit the following criteria?   For the contest I'll need something with a bit more length, upwards of twenty-five lines, and something shorter to memorize by next week. Of course, length is much more a preference than a requirement. Something serious and dramatic, not satirical or purely comedic. The kind of poem I'm looking for is what one may listen to at some sort of political conference that commands the attention of all in the vicinity and captures their attention, an oratory of power. In short, a poem that was written to be read to a large audience.   Also, more as a minuscule preference rather than a requirement, I would want it not to have a set rhyme scheme and more free-verse.    While these criteria are probably vague, any suggestions are welcome.

Do you hate yourself so you cant love him?   If so you should know that he’s more like his father    But he must have inherited you dumbness or why would he bother?      He wasted his years with one request--   Only your love nothing more nothing less.   I’ve have love here in large supply   But he would never meet my eye.
