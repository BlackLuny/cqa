20061226084750AAyEIsI	Consumer Electronics;Other - Electronics	My Canon digital camera broke itself on Christmas!?	I have one of the digital powershot "elph" models... it is 2.5 years old but has never had any trouble until yesterday. I went to turn it on and it would not function. It made a sound like the lens may have been jammed (it would not expand out from the camera), but then when I turned the dial to "play" mode (used to review pictures), it would not perform that function either. The power is working, because the power light comes on. And it makes a mechanical sound as if the lens is jammed, but like I said, I don't think that is the problem, since the camera normally plays pictures without expanding the lens. Does anyone know what I can do? I love my camera and use it all the time! Not sure I can afford a new one right now. Thanks!

Vi prego di aiutarmi perche Ã¨ da piu di un mese che sto diventando matto per realizzare tale progettino.      Cordiali saluti claudio

I currently have a family plan with 750 minutes total (we don't use it all that much) for 2 phones.  We are both using the LG VX8300.

Do you have any suggestions on what phone would be a good choice as an upgrade from the 8300?      Thank You.
