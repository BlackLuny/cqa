20090202103926AAie4qT	Health;Diet & Fitness	I have a little bit of belly fat around the mid section and I want to get rid of it.?	I am a 41 years old. I am 5'7". I weight 160 pounds. I work out an average of 5 hours a week doing cardio and weights (at the gym at least 3 times a week) and I've done this for the past 4 months. For my height my ideal weight should be between 133 - 163 lbs. I eat very healthy and watch my daily caloric intake. I think I am doing all the right things but I don't seem to get anywhere. The belly fat has decreased from day one, for sure, but I am at a point where it's not going away at all. No matter how hard I try, I won't go below 160 lbs. and the belly fat doesn't want to go away. Should I increase the amount of cardio per week? Should I eat less, even though I am already eating between 1500 to 2000 calories per day (smaller meals up to 5 or 6 times per day)? What should I do? Is there a website I can visit to get answers? Should I hire a personal trainer or a dietitian?       Please help....

20090202105202AAqMFGd	Health;Women's Health	Never had intercourse, but I'm having pregnancy symptoms! Why?	I have had my period for two years (since age 11) and it has always been regular until my third year was beginning to start (December) I got two periods during that month, then skipped my January Period.      I never had intercourse, I never been raped or drugged, the only possibility is being raped in my sleep. but, I wake up instantly when even someone comes near me half the time. So, I know I should have never had contact with sperm, Let alone kissed a guy with out clothing.       When my January period was supposed to be happening, I didnt bleed at all. I only got gas. I am beginning to get paranoid and develope a huge phobia of pregnancy. I am getting tender breasts and a tender stomach, I also have had food cravings and randomly for about two hours I feel tired during school.       but, the tired and food cravings isnt really a concern. I have been like that alot since I was eight anyways.          But, what could be happening to me? Is it even possible to get raped in your sleep and not notice it? Even if the man was thrusting fast or slow? Like I said, I never had consented intercourse. Meaning, I know I am a virgin. The only chance of this being pregnancy is from rape. I am thirteen years old and have had my period for two years now.     I'm really scared and need advice.

I don't use sunscreen because I think that it causes cancer. But the moles are not lifted, meaning they don't rise out of the skin. I hate the moles I have and I'm wondering if I can remove them even if they are not cancerous. Will it leave scars? How can I prevent getting new moles?

20070723225221AAmIuNo	Health;General Health Care;Injuries	My Ingrown Toenail?	I went in for my very first pedicure and I totally regret it. 2 days after receiving it my big toe really started to hurt. At 1st I thought I had a really bad infection from their instruments not being clean (which they weren't) But after about 4 months of just trying to get rid of it on my own it began to look more like an ingrown toenail. So not going on month 5 I went to the doctor finally. They said I would surgically have to have it removed because of the amount of time I would have it. Since I couldn't make an appointment then, he gave me some medicine to get the inflammation down. It really helped and cleared the puss, blood, and closed the wound completely up. I figured I had beaten it, but my medicine soon ran out and now I am back to were I started. I tried everything and I really don't want the surgery, for fear that my toenail will look all gross. ! So anyone that has had this done what does your toenail look like? Can you see a difference in what had to be taken out?

20081111215855AA40PtX	Health;Diet & Fitness	What are some suggestions that you can make to help loose weight?	I am really wanting to eat healthier and loose weight (at least 50 lbs, but possibly 60). I have tried Weight Watchers, South Beach, and simply counting calories which just left me feeling hungry and worn out. I need to find a diet plan that I can fit in with my everyday life that will feel natural.    I drink primarily water, though I am drinking other beverages now that the weather is cooling down. I am drinking tall hot beverages (including apple cider) from Starbucks, and I have been having some sparkling cider as a treat. Other than the small hot drinks and the rare sparkling cider (which I drink only on special occasions including Christmas and New Years), I only drink skim milk and water.    However, my eating habits are not all that great. I usually end up going to Ihop, California Pizza Kitchen, Applebees, or some fast food restaurant to eat. The healthy options there are not always that great, and I usually gravitate away from the salads and towards entrees with the fries because they taste better (and are often cheaper).     Does anybody have any tips to help make healthy eating a more natural part of life? I am not able to completely give up eating at fast food restaurants, so I need suggestions on making the trips healthier.    Also, what are some ways to sneak in exercise during my day? I want to be able to get some exercise and burn calories, but I don't want it to seem like a chore. I have a Wii with Wii Sports and the Wii Fit, but the most exercise I usually get is walking around the house, walking to and from the car, and helping stack and unstack chairs at church on Sunday.     I want these changes in my life to stick, but when I intentionally go on a "diet" I give up because I get hungry, tired, and irritated. I'm relatively impatient, so I don't want to feel like I'm on a diet or trying to loose weight because that sets me up for failure.    I gave up drinking soda and Slurpees (I went from drinking 1 or more 64 oz. Slurpees and soda with multiple refills per week). Just by giving up soda, I know I have given up a large number of calories per week. It has been more than 2 and a half months since I have tasted any soda, and I went more than 2 months drinking nothing but water (aside from some tea when I was sick). I don't miss the soda.    I gave up the soda as a month-long fast, and now I am still not drinking soda. Do you suggest I try that with other foods that are unhealthy? Should I try giving up something like candy, pancakes, french fries, or potato chips for a month like I did with soda? If I should give something up, what should it be?

I finally have been thinking the worst this week, that maybe my bad dreams of being diagnosed with stomach cancer or a brain tumor (which I haven't told anyone about because I don't want to sound like a hypochondriac) are coming true.      Here are my symptoms ~   *Severe nausea (five years, but in the last year has grown increasingly worse)   *Severe abdominal pain (last few months)   *Loss of appitite and painful boloating after eating (1 year)   *Black stools (past few weeks, I have not taken pepto bismal, ect. for months)   *30lb weight loss in 3 months (unintentional)   *Night fevers (last few months)   *Severe headaces (last few months)   *Dizziness/Fatigue/Blurred vision (last few months)      I am currently taking 25mg Promethagan once a day and 5ml of Zantac twice a day and they helped at first but not any more.      I have had tons of blood tests, some urine tests, and one stool test to test for a bacterial infection. No scans, mris, ect.      I went to a GI doctor before Christmas and he did nothing for me except a blood test for chrones which was negative. At that time I didn't have black stools though. My parents say that I have had almost every blood test possible and nothing is wrong with me. I can't go to the doctor on my own, so how can I get my parents to take me?      What is wrong with me? I just want to get better! Any help is appriciated!

20090205101120AAsLFAq	Health;Mental Health	Pedophile brother wants help but being convinced not to?	Ill make this as brief as I can.   Nov 06 my then 17yo brother was about to molest my then 3yo son. Thankfully, nothing happened that would severely traumatize my son. At the time, I took my son to the police, he shared his story but nothing ever came of it.    I tried getting at least court ordered therapy, again, nothing.   So, you see, I have already taken the route to try to "try him".   Now, my brother is 19 and wants to get help.He's nervous he will go to jail but is still willing to get help. My parents, whom he lives with dont want him to talk about it because they as well fear he will be locked up. My mom seems more willing than  my dad from what SHE says.   I tried explaining to her that I already tried that and as far as we all know, it never go to that point. I think my brother can go in and just simply say he thinks about touching kids, not that he did, just to say he has these thoughts. He cant be locked up for thoughts alone. My brother, even though he is an adult and can do this on his own, has always been slow and far behind maturity wise and wouldnt have a clue as to where to go.   I am thinking about trying to set something up myself. I know a community therapy place I went to several years ago for free. And I may be able to set him up. Im not sure what Im asking but Im just frustrated. They have this sick kid who tried hurting one of their little grandson's and may have hurt another or many others or maybe will and they just want to turn a blind eye. Not only would my brother be possibly saving children from being harmed by him but he can live a happier, more stable life for himself.

I try to make friends but at the same time i don't have the will to make friends. I sit in my room every weekend by myself and i type random stuff about loneliness in the google search engine. I am very socially isolated. I used to have 3 best friends one of whom was my girlfriend. Her and I broke up and then my other best friend moved to india. my other best friend goes to college not to far away and i still talk to him. I have been very depressed since my break up. We broke up 5 months ago. She was extremely far out of my league and we dated for 2 years.      Our break up and my friend leaving occurred around the same time and this really destroyed my support system. I am failing college because of my sadness and I truly believe things cannot get worse. I just want to die. what is the most painless way to die

Yesterday (Feb 1st) I started a 1200 calorie diet. And I plan to jog for about an hour 5 times a week. Now, my only question is this.... What is the proper amount of fat grams (including saturated fat) and carbs should I stay under in order to lose weight? Now let me tell you, I am NOT doing a low carb diet... I am doing a healthy low fat/low calorie diet, but I also don't wanna go overboard on carbs though. Is 15g fat 5g sat fat 100 carbs sound like good numbers to stay under? Help please!      Oh and also, as far as being healthy... what is a good number of mg to stay below for cholesterol and sodium??      How long do you think it will be before I start seeing results? And how long would it take to reach my goal of 130lbs?

I gained some from being in college and whatnot.  I wake up at 8:30 MWF and go to the gym for about an hour (20 minutes arc trainer, 20 minutes treadmill, 20 minutes lifting). On these days, I don't eat breakfast because I eat lunch around 11:30.  I'll usually get a salad or some fruit.  Then I eat just a little bit at dinner, and maybe a snack at night.  I burn around 500-550 cals at the gym, and eat about 1200-1500 cals a day.  On Tues/Thurs I do 100 lunges and 50 crunches, and eat the same way.  In 1 week, I've lost exactly 2 lbs. Any suggestions/critiques? Thanks a lot!!!

20081123034955AAoXTvM	Health;Women's Health	Period was four days late, having discharge and slight cramps. ?	I've read online about girls having thought they had their period, but it turning out to be spotting during pregnancy... I figure that means really light bleeding. I had my period four days late and for the first half it was heavy and had lots of clots (I usually get a really heavy period, the kind that overflows at night), then for the last half it was barely there, meaning I didn't use anything for the most part. Then a week later I'm having lots of clear/milky white discharge that is really stringy; I'm not sure how else to describe it besides stringy, it's just really gooey at times. I've never had discharge like this in my life, so I'm a bit worried about what it could be.. I'm also having slight cramps that aren't like usual menstrual cramping (I always get really bad cramps when I get my period). I've also read online that some girls don't show if they are pregnant for up to 9 or even 14 weeks (with multiple home pregnancy tests). I'm not sure if I should be worried that I'm pregnant or that I may have some sort of infection. Anyone with a similar experience or expert-like advice, your comments are very, very welcome!       PS: I've taken a home pregnancy test; it came out negative, but as posted above, I've read about many people who've had the same experience. (it was a cheap "One Step Pregnancy" test from Wal-mart)      - Had period on Fri.Oct.3. ended on Fri.Oct.10.   - Had period on Wed.Nov.5. ended on Wed.Nov.12 - was barely there light from the 9th to the 12th.   - Starting getting discharge aprox.

A life of rejection and lonerism throughout my entire schoolife however (Infant and Junior school etc) has caused me to have the self-conscious feelings I have.      But I fortunately did make friends in secondary school and we were a rock band that played in assemblies etc. I was never depressed before and always happy as a kid, but now, the loss of that band and a very great friend (the drummer) I have obsessed over in regret of loosing someone so close.      Now, I think non-stop how I look, from the moment I'm in the streets and walk out the front door. It's really uncomfortable and the funny thing is I feel that I don't give a damn what others think of me.

Ok so my now ex boyfriend, who out weights me by 50 lbs, held me down on my bed and gave me a bad hickie. I was trying to push him off me but he is just much stronger than me. All my struggling did was get the hickie on my jaw line where it meets my neck. Later that day he broke up with me and told me he did that cause he was selfish and wanted to make sure at least for a few days no guys would want to talk to me. That was on Monday and it is still there just as dark. Its like its not going away...where its at & the color makes it way to hard for make up to cover it (I've tried!). I really want this gone it looks really tacky and he knows I hate them for that reason. Any suggestions on how to get rid of them....please don't be mean to me about this.

20090205104640AAh63FP	Health;Diseases & Conditions;Heart Diseases	Is it possible that my blood pressure was high because i got extremely nervous when at my jobs medical exam?	Today I had a medical exam for a job i applied with, and I'm 21 years old btw. I have never before had high blood pressure and i went to the doctor last maybe a year and a half ago and i was as fine as can be.    However, i admit I am a bit of a worrier when it comes to things, I sometimes get anxious and really nervous.. I can't control it, I've been to the doctor telling them this but that doesnt help, they just say to relax ( i have been to many and they all say the same thing) Anyways, Ill state some more facts that will maybe help in determing this. I woke up really early to get to the medical. at 3:45 AM after some maybe 5 hours or so of sleep. before i got there i did have a large cup of coffee to keep me awake. As the medical proceeded around 6 am, i began getting really nervous. The medical examiners were pretty strict so i think naturally we were all a bit nervous but me, I was very nervous. Now, i am not one that gets angry very often, my diet is very good, i drink plenty of water, i do get my excercise, i do not drink, i do not smoke, and i rarely eat meat and i stay away from salts and soft drinks. But aside from all these facts, this morning I was feeling very nervous for some reason, I was shaking a bit, i made a few mistakes when following directions,  got some gaseuous cramps, and I could feel my heart beating and me breathing a bit harder as i waited my turn. When i got to them taking my blood pressure, they saw the big number was 151 ( dont remember the lower number) and said it was a bit high. I was shocket to be honest, so i assumed it was just a bit hjigh because i was extremely nervous and/or the caffeine from the coffee + the anxiety of passing combined. Is it possible that being really nervous can cause your blood pressure to read high ? ( Also i was shaking a bit as the man piut the strap around my arm, and when it got tight, i felt my pulse, beating really fast. I am a bit worried now as I do not want to deal with hypertension at 21. I am gonna go to the doctor when i am calm and try to get another exam. But could the nervousnous just have beent he reason why my blood pressure read so high?

20090205110641AAogO4a	Health;Mental Health	I am very depressed now that I know that I messed up so badly...?	Well I have been suffering from extreme anxiety and depression the last two years. I went from being the kid who had all the friends, was as skinny as a twig, would have straight A's, etc. to a kid who failed half of his classes last year and same this year, has almost no friends, and is now almost 150 pounds at just 5'5". It has affected my attendance so badly and it's awful. Everyone keeps telling me it's not my fault, but I just feel like it is. I feel like I have ruined THEIR lives as well. Especially my parents. They are very supportive of me and I know the last two years for them have been Hell and it's all my fault. Last year, my therapist and I figured out a plan to graduate with my class (I'm a Sophomore in HS). It went fine, but once again, I messed up this year. Nothing has improved. I'm suicidal and I hate myself. Now my therapist is telling me that it is basically impossible to graduate with my class. That is making me feel horrible. I am a very self-conscious person so now that I am going to be forced to stay another year and lose ALL my friends and all respect from anybody I have ever met, I want to die basically. I'm on medication, and yes, it works. But nothing cures my problems completely. It's almost as if my body works its way around the medication and figures out a new way to ruin my life (I now have mild ADD and OCD too). I just don't know what to do... Advice...?

I know this is a problem, but can anyone tell me if it is serious enough to get it taken care of right away or can it wait a couple weeks?

I cant sleep, cant eat, I'm constantly on edge, I'm suicidal, hallucinate and am never without a weapon.  I spend almost every night, and some days, either rigid with fear in bed or sitting with my ear pressed against my bedroom door, wielding a weapon in hand and literally holding my breath waiting for something to happen.

20090205112047AA7bWIi	Health;Other - Health	What *could* be causing horrible stomach pains, especially when I'm hungry?	This started on Sunday, the day after I ate a salad with Italian dressing. The salad looked really pretty and clean. The next morning I had severe acid reflux , but no Tums or anything for it. I just laid in bed hurting. I got up eventually and ate some crackers and drank a glass of water in an attempt to dilute the acid. After this, I had to go to the bathroom, and when I got done in there, I felt the urge to throw up. I threw up my salad and Italian dressing from the night before.      After that, the stomach cramps started. I thought I had food poisoning cause my mother said it gave her cramps. I called my parents and spoke to my dad and he said I may be dehydrated, so my husband went out and got me Gatorade and some Ginger Ale for the nausea.      After drinking the gatorade and a few glasses of water, I did feel better, but then it came back.      After 4 or 5 days of this, I am realizing a pattern. It hurts severely when I'm hungry, but hurts slightly the rest of the time. I have also noticed that I'm fine during the night (at least while I'm asleep) and it usually starts hurting horribly bad at around 6 every morning.      Also, the pain is right in the middle of my abdomen, I guess where my stomach would be.      I want to go to the doctor, but I don't know if they'll take it seriously. They'll probably just say it's gas and send me home or something. Also, my mother said they might have to do a colonoscopy. I'm scared. :(
20090205112247AAZRC6s	Health;Mental Health	Night Terror? what should I do?	I have a history of general anxiety disorder. Recently, i've been very stressed about my work, my mother, my chronic health conditions, and about having to drop a semester of school. My boyfriend and I are having to move in with his mother because of financial issues, just a whole lot going on.      Last night, we were watching Pulp Fiction before bed, turned it off after that crazy heroin scene and I was trying to go to sleep. He fell asleep before I did, which almost never happens. I like having the security of his wakefulness as I drift off to sleep because i'm often afraid of being injured in such a vulnerable state and have trouble falling asleep.      As I was laying staring at the window, a childhood phobia of alien abduction (spawned from watching one of those stupid dramatic recreations on the discovery channel) started running through my head. i started to think that possibly an alien would make him unable to awaken and paralyze me (mind you, I haven't thought about this since I was 9, and I'd forgotten all about that show until I started to remember the testimonies). I would drift to sleep and then snap awake, shake him awake enough to talk to me, then try to go to sleep.      Finally, I must've fallen asleep, but not for very long. A few minutes later, I awoke screaming, he was crying out, and I was very confused and disoriented. I couldn't figure out why he was mad at me until I started remembering my dream, an alien machine had been coming through my window and trying to take him and I was trying to grab, claw, bite at him to wake him up to make sure he wasn't sedated by the alien so I could get us to safety. When I awoke, I had punctured several places on his sides with my nails and teeth and he was bleeding and crying, very mad at me.      He told me he had been screaming and trying to shake me off for several seconds, and I only remembered trying to pull him away from the attacker and don't remember him even being awake, saying my name, yelling, or anything like that. i only remember screaming very shrilly when I saw that machine descending down on us.         We were both shaking violently for about 10 minutes like we were cold, and I felt like the whole thing wasn't real and couldn't remember if it had been a dream at all, was still a bit worried there really had been an attempted abduction until I calmed down and realized that was ridiculous, that it was just a dream.      He checked the window, a bit convinced that I had seen something, too, then when the plastic covering over our windows wasn't punctured, was satisfied that we were safe, went to cleaning up his scratches (some of which were fairly deep), told me that since this was an isolated incident, and he had been a psychology major, that he didn't think this was too big of a deal, then moved our guns to his side of the bed.      .   .   .      Over the summer, I had been trying to sleep with my mom and granny in a camper out in the woods. This was the first time I'd slept away from my boyfriend in a bout a year, and I was pretty nervous about no men being around with us out in the woods. I had my gun safely packed away (unloaded) in its case in the back of the camper, with the bullets on me in case i needed to load it quickly.      As I was falling asleep, I was hearing weird noises, had a weird nightmare about people crawling on the roof of the camper trying to poison us with gas when I awoke to a shrill noise. The carbon monoxide detector. It was going off, only a few minutes after I'd fallen asleep, I was convinced that my dream was real, scared the **** out of mom and granny trying to explain it to them, them thinking I was crazy, me running around the camper looking for people, holding my bullets in my hand, etc, finally having to call my boyfriend to come pick me up. It was the same sort of disoriented feeling upon waking from that incident that I felt last night, only, I actually responded last night, whereas with the first incident, I woke fully into consciousness, able to see and register events as they were, even if I was a bit freaked out and irrationally blaming the gas on intruders.
20090205112641AAlFgZW	Health;Women's Health	Is there anyway to postpone my period?	omg, I'm so mad right now. My bf and I haven't been intimate often and we have a trip to Vegas planned for the 6th-9th and we started getting intimate last night and I bled a little bit. I wasn't supposed to get my period for another week. I'm not bleeding right now and I really, really don't want to be on my period while in Vegas. Is there anything I can do to postpone it for a few days or trick my body into thinking its pregnant? I don't have anymore bc and I'm leaving in the morning so I can't pick any up...I do have some morning after pill which I know is supposed to make you have your period - If I take those will it raise my hormone levels a bit and postpone it a little or will it come faster? I'm just so mad and getting stressed about it since this is the first vacation in a while with my bf and I feel like its going to ruin alot of my plans for our trip.

I hear this "music" 24 hours a day over and over again. It stems from noises made by equipment, i.e.normal sounds coming from the refrigerator, car engine, air conditioner, train whistles, anything that makes noise turns into musical notes. I suffer from long term situational depression and have been on paxil for years but this noise is driving me crazy.  My hearing is excellent according to an ear specialist and I have had my teeth checked for cavities.  It is not tinnitus, ringing of the ears, it is musical notes that my brain makes up words that have no meaning.  I try to take the notes and make up songs to at least make sense of what I am hearing and may sing that song in my head for hours.    Has anyone had a similar experience or knows what to do.   My regular Dr. is sending me to a Psychiatrist and I am afraid of what the diagnosis will be. This has been going on for five months. Please help if you can.

I'm allowed one day a week to 'cheat', but when I 'cheat' (I'm talking about 12 cookies, a slice of cake, almost a whole jar of peanut butter - I'm sure I take it WAY past extreme) I end up feeling horrible about myself!  I always recover throughout the next week and pull it all back in - but this one day per week just drives me NUTS!  It's planned (not as far as I take it, though), but I still feel so outrageously guilty for it - it's almost not worth it to me, but I need it to keep my sanity.  The food calls and chants my name all week long - and the only thing that gets me through the other 6 days of dieting is knowing that, soon, I'll get to cheat (and inevitably feel horrible for doing so).  It just doesn't make any sense - does any one else feel similarly?

20070115003935AAUu5cx	Health;Diet & Fitness	Running versus Treadmilling.?	I'm trying to lose some weight and just become more healthy.  I'm  5'11"  251lbs, and have a 38 inch waist.  I've always been an avid cyclist and have pretty good leg muscles.         I've been running on the treadmill last few months as it's conveniently located in my basement.  My question is how effective is running on a treadmill in comparison to running outside?  Since the treadmill assists by pulling my planted foot back, there must be somewhat of a trade off.  Furthermore, I find that I can't run as far outside.      Basically, if for example, running at 5 MPH on a treadmill burns 500Cal/hr what would running at 5mph on pavement burn per hour?  I'm assuming no wind, no incline.  Purely the difference between the moving conveyor and the stationary pavement.      Thanks.

Thinking about the new medication I think it's called Chanix or something like that... Has anybody tried it? Does it work// I understand you are still smoking while you are taking the drug...With me it's not a health thing, its a social thing, just can't smoke anymore ANYWHERE... So what else do you do, but QUIT... the whole idea SCARES ME TO DEATH!!!!!!!

Bem , gostaria que nao leva-se minha pergunta para o lado do mal, acho que quem me dar a resposta tem que saber que tem que respeitar-me porque amo meu marido, e nao gosto de brincadeiras, E voces mulheres casadas ja se sentiram assim que temos que fazer, tomar remedio ou `e apenas uma fase?
