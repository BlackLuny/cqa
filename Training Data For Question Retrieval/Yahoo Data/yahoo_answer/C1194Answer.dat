HSXLzwE1aa	This yahoo group has tons of pictures of the latest hairstyles and new pictures are being added all the time.  It takes a little patience because there are so many pictures to view.  It might be of help.    http://health.groups.yahoo.com/group/fee...|`|Rf2r23sYaa	I think this is just your hair type. Probably the thing that would help the most would be growing it below your shoulders or even down to your bra strap. The weight of the hair will pull it down and it will be less poofy. Also, try not to wash it every day and try a shampoo and conditioner for course, wavy, or ethnic hair.|`|RBGc1Hytaa	Go to the hairdresser and get it thinned. It will feel much more light. Then go to any pharmacy or walmart or something and buy a hair tamer. Any kind that is a resonable price will work. It will calm your hair down to make it manageable. Try straightening serum too, it helps.|`|z0fomFCfaa	Go To the professional and get your ends trimmed then Flat ironed!!!|`|QNdJ5Rinaa	you could go for that whole natural look. its sexy nowadays.. u know with da curly afro n stuff.|`|3eede3c6bfcae1014bd3454cd6dac5e1aa	get a magic straight perm, if you have long hair then its gonna cost u around 200 buks but it lasts like 6 months to a year
oheJaFsPaa	i think the best way to do that would be to take a wide barrel curling iron and just curl your hair in about 1 1/2 inch sections, turning the iron vertically as you curl and releasing loosely. then, to add volume at the top, just tease your roots with a comb and get out the hairspray :)|`|GSbz9Zq4aa	if your hair is flat then you need to volumize it by moouse(dunno how to spell) k, so after your hair is thick, you curl it with a wave curler, or you can regularly curl it and just comb it a bit with a wide end comb for the wavey effect|`|GXEEvyflaa	you tease your hair:  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BzClJs4qN...  then you use a wave iron to get those waves:  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IKG_Bc9Iz...|`|4d39218667eb8c323bab12b2798e6a3caa	for curls yu get a curling iron and curl it pretty basic actually. for the bump. have you heard of that thing on t.v. that is like a clip that gives you body and volume. i forgot what its called. but you can google it. sorry i cant help anymore.|`|hO3rRFqBaa	first tease your hair with hairspray and thin tooth comb. then have a wide barrel curling iron. make sure you dont straighten your hair before you curl it.|`|DRFXicyyaa	curl it with a big barrel curling iron   straighten the bangs and   tease tease tease!! the top, for volume!  then use hair wax to hold &&  alot of hairspray   && u r done sweetie =]|`|ro3X9fs3aa	wow is ur hair really that long , pretty :)     just do some random curls with ur curling iron and hair spray it well tease the top of the hair and vua la la u got it ;)
f7fe854f34875855e7bddc879f7c8ff9aa	It depends on whether you see your hair as a defining attribute or just a fashion accessory.  If it really means a lot to you then keep it like you want it.  If it is something you may change depending on the current trends then think about getting it cut.  It will always grow back.|`|39dqBmoiaa	Don't do what everyone does, do what you like what helps boost your confidence/self esteem most important thing|`|1Kku5tTOaa	No, not if you don't want to. It will take a while to grow back. And if you like your hair like that, then keep it like that. But, if you don't, then don't It's all about how you feel.  BAD: People could make fun of you because you stand out.  GOOD: People could think that you're right and do what you kept.|`|QNdJ5Rinaa	nope. u need to wear your hair how you like it. it will make u stand out i promise. girls like dudes wit long hair...cuz im a guy wit long hair so we n da same boat. as long as you take care of it.|`|DRFXicyyaa	don't be a follower be differnt dammit u were born to stand out not blend in. im pretty sure u look sexy as is.|`|iJZ5Efb0aa	uh no.  1. why copy what everyone else is doing.?  2. why cut off all your long hair.?  3. guys with longer hair are more attractive.    DONT get one.|`|0frhtuGdaa	dont do it.  if you like your hair why would you do it?|`|l0mC7FIMaa	dont do it. its a stupid trend. keep your hair how you like it.|`|5yN05Habaa	No, if I were you I would be different and try to get that long hairstyle back in style! But that is just me. It is worth a try though, so give it a couple weeks or a month. Try it out!
1rlFqcVbaa	What if you got her the keyring and a custom made license plate for her car? That would look like a little more than just a keychain.|`|uUHMg5Szaa	well if you could get more than 30 dollars (like 50) that would be great because you are her good friend and it is her 16th birthday, if you can I would buy her a coach purse from an outlet store or ebay, if you can only get 30 then maybe a cute top or something, I know that has nothing to do with art or volleyball but all girls have to wear tops lol.      (=|`|Ea3HofRxaa	get her a coach keyring and some clothes or somethin or jewelry from claires that says best friends or someting|`|vWOlSbubaa	You can get her some cute decals to put on her car, I know a friend who has some and she absolutely loves them.  You can also get her something cute to hang around her rear view mirror. If she is religious you can get her a blessed cross from your church. We have one in each of our cars. You can also have your preacher or priest bless it for her. Another idea would be to go to Things Remembered and get her a personalized keychain.|`|GVkGNiTWaa	Maybe you should get her a giftcard or a cute top or stuffed animal.|`|yhkEyVXLaa	You should put together a gift basket of all the things she likes.  Things should be cheap enough to do that, but you may go over a little bit.  Kind of a collage of an assortment of things that she likes, will find useful, or are just plain fun.    SWEET 16 SURVIVAL KIT  http://www.sawyers-specialties.com/survi...    Just a fun survival kit.  I know someone who got one of these and loved it!  They got the biggest kick out of it!    ****  I don't know about the keychain.  I bought someone one, coach keychain, and they don't use it because they are afraid of the details falling off.  If you like it and know she will like it, then that is all that matters.    Hope this helps!|`|2XTkSV4daa	To tell you the truth, the thing I would like most is something you can't buy. Sure, buy her something too if you want (try a belt, a cool artsy belt is always fun) but I would make a scrapbook with your friends for her and all present it to her on her birthday. She would seriously love that. You could use sports and car stickers and it would still be artsy!! :D
a8cc321ca3aed60f5acd5dceb2dc1fbdaa	I say Black.  I nice strappy heel  Or Really Cute Glitzy flats  Diamond studs or any really cute studs would work  Red hair love it do a half due with it and clear lip a smokey and your ready....|`|X2lesqhRaa	Ok. A simple white knee-lenth dress with cup sleaves and a red belt around the curve area. Leave your hair open, if thats hard try straightning or curling, your choice. A nice strap heal some girls night out make up, and guess what? your golden!!!!1|`|Xg7i420Uaa	id say go with a black dress that has a little bit of red or pink in it..but stay away from pink or red solid color dresses..itll blend in with your hair and skintone.good luck! :]
FR2bKa7iaa	The tip of the, you know what.|`|EJNbwkjNaa	I think it depends on your pain tolerance not necessarily the spot cause I got a tattoo on my wrist and then the next week my friend got the a tattoo on the same spot I was in the room when he got his done && I honestly thought he broke a finger he was squeezing my hand that hard when I got mine done I looked at the person who was in the room with and they asked if it hurt I told her it tickled a little bit .. so it all depends on your pain tolerance ..    I have however heard that the top of your foot hurts ... I'm getting on on there when I get my tax returns so I will let you know|`|jeHTjvbaaa	Well my arm didn't hurt at all until I got right under my arm pits and that just kinda made my fingers tingle...  My ribcage tattoo I'm getting on the other hand.... that will probably hurt like a b*tch...|`|8THz1sp9aa	Everyone deals with pain differently. As the person said that their spine hurt terribly, my spine didn't hurt at all, it's the more fleshy areas that hurt more for me.|`|LBHJaqXoaa	My wrist was pretty intense. But over the top of the spine was almost unbearable.|`|62ed2c415d781a32b672aaa388d79f43aa	i got one just beside my vagina it hurt but not real bad it was barable.|`|GSbz9Zq4aa	most painful: eyes  there are actually eye tattoos look it up on google it's very stupid|`|pXTUMTdEaa	i have one that's on my side/lower back and it was pretty bad, going from a fleshy place to a not as fleshy spot, they were both pretty intense|`|ws99Yfzxaa	ribcage|`|HXO2vUcIaa	normally the areas with bones hurt the most like the spine and the ribcage|`|PV9YFZNmaa	the ankle bone, shoulder blade, ad the upper chest area is some of the most painful. anywhere the bone is close to the surface.|`|oAJLZSVZaa	It's different for everyone. you cant really avoid it until you actually get it done! It's all about where your nerve endings are most sensitive, and you wont find out until it hurts.|`|bT9SXnYQaa	I heard the chest hurts the most.    Source: LA Ink|`|GZ0E8Uksaa	your foot|`|JnXmSLDfaa	I am amazed that no one seems to have considered this.  I took a couple of Tylenol before I went and a px pain pill and I felt no pain.|`|zcwRIn5zaa	i've never thought on the bone hurts that bad...it's the fleshy areas that hurt like crazy. i got one tattoo that went from my hip up to my waist, and onto my lowers ribs. and i can honestly say the ribs hurt the least. when my hip and waist were getting done, i almost passed out from the pain. i've also heard that the inside of the leg and the inside of the arm hurt like hell too.|`|KHyPqJviaa	ancle|`|n9Bay8ujaa	i've heard the rib cage area is the absolute most painful spot to get a tattoo|`|Q0i9d4claa	My upper back
1uvrkDWNaa	You can answer your own question by going on Google and search for Donatella + Versace+ bikini and see what may happen in the future.  Not meaning to say you'll look like that, but they do look awful on an older woman.|`|24Xy8qWtaa	I personally find they look quite bad if not done properly or if women get them too big.  It's your body though, do what makes you happy. :)|`|8oBi8KiIaa	Pretty gross.  They look so fake.  Like someone pasted a huge blob on your chest.  I hate them.  What a turn-off.|`|XhpLwjCuaa	Most guys think they are hot, don't go above C big boobs are sexy giant boobs are nasty|`|IHa6FxE6aa	I'd rather be with a flat chested girl than a girl with fake boobs.|`|E4pXTZ5Naa	Wow, plastic in your chest to make you look like you have something you don't. Yeah, so hot.|`|e68a6a673385cf8ff6673cecb42f930aaa	More like weird.|`|H8XpaaPDaa	gross      i'd rather be with a confident girl, not over confident, but someone who's comfortable with their own skin. someone who doens't give into the pressures of the media to look a certain way.|`|VYWaL2graa	I am not a fan. They are completely unnecessary, except for situations like reconstruction due to mastectomy.|`|U25RAqyoaa	gross and fake|`|CuhJRewLaa	just think of how you would feel if later in life you found out that your mother had implants    nasty|`|UKGJxaoaaa	as long as they fit your body they are fine!|`|nRObJuJeaa	gross! Just look at some women on tv and there's your example. Just because they're popular doesn't mean they're the right way to go. They're also dangerous and unnatural looking. If you don't like the sagging, consider a breast lift rather than the implants. that will be safer and look a lot better.|`|0LdCigGQaa	gross,why get them at all|`|5b7An8jEaa	guys think their hot nut their just fake and thats not very cool and i don't like fake i like just being myself and being natural and god made you the way you are for a reason|`|AA11278326	EWWWWWWWW grosssssss. If you have no boobs and you get them like a size AA or B thats fine but a size DDD is mad messed up.    I'm considering a nose job but I want to love myself as I am and have a guy that loves me as I am.|`|01123eea1eeabc0f4537baaafd70a31daa	I personally think that they are not attractive, but I am also a straight woman.  I do not understand why women feel that they need to have large breasts to be attractive.  Be yourself! And if you think larger breasts are going to get you a guy, then you may be right, but it is likely that that guy will not be a good one.  That's just my opinion, but I'm sure many others will agree.  It is better to love yourself for who you are - would you rather die an original or a copy? Think about it.  Good luck in whatever you decide.|`|lxJaqQ95aa	personally i dont think thats a good idea. maybe when you are still young its fine.. it look hot but just imagine yourself if your on your 80's with this standing D boobies.. ewwww|`|A3axVsjuaa	they look ok, but they feel hard! i.e. NOT GOOD    besides do you want your body to be like your personality? FAKE?!|`|wvN4HLhLaa	I dont like em. But I wanna get my boobs SHRANK. To like an A. I dont want any. Lets trade.|`|bT9SXnYQaa	If they look natural, of course not.    So, I suggest if you were to get them,   to put them under your muscle, not just skin..   [my cousin did that, and they look greattt]    a lot of people don't do that, I guess because it hurts waaay more,   but it looks like they taped balloons to their chest.    So, I say go for it  just go to an experienced doctor, with prior great results.  :)  good luck    oh but btw, a D is a bit big :/  Stick with full C.    Sometimes.. less is more|`|5586ad15a09ab2f36457c1e8042071f2aa	I know a number of women who have gotten implants and only TWO actually look really GOOD, with the others electing to go way too BIG. Of the two who ended up perfect, one had reconstruction after a total mastectomy after breast cancer, a modest B cup. The other was so flat even A was being generous. She also elected to go only to B. AND, in my opinion, BOTH were perfectly proportioned and it took some careful manipulation to feel where the implants were. With the rest I know, gross. Slice something the size of a grapefruit in half and paste it on, and you get the idea. Hard edges, 90 degree angles, right at the chest wall. A real breast has a gentle curve an implant which is too big does NOT have, resulting in that hard angle. On top of the shape being wrong, the FEEL is wrong. Implants do not bounce right! If you are like my friend with the almost A cup or like my other friend getting reconstruction, OK, but be careful of the proportions. Men see a "perfect" proportion in women, 8-7-1`0. Which means if you take hip size and make that 100%, then bust size is 80% of hip size and waist size is 70% of hip size. But if you just are going bigger  just BECAUSE... then don't. Anything more than a hand or mouth full is wasted. Watch the "The Real Housewives of OC" and you will see what I (AND my 2 Lady friends) think of as WAY TOO BIG. 3 out of 4 have has implants and all it takes is to look closely to see WHO has and who has NOT had surgery. Just look for how they jiggle...The fakes DON'T and the real DO. If you look closely, it will become obvious. For most women, who end up top heavy like a Barbie doll, it is vanity run amok...    Edit: Since I started and finished this answer, 20 more people responded AND you added more detail...  which changes things a bit. OK, so here is the deal. My first wife was the barely A cup. She really LIKED how big her breasts got when she breast fed our son. Her maternity bra was a 34B/C. Her implants only made her as big as she was while she was breast feeding, a whopping 200CC's each. It sounds to me more like you could use a simple lift rather than implants if it is simple sagging. It also sounds like D is in the way too big category. Ever seen Dr. 90210? THOSE women were getting 400-500 CC's added and were in the sliced grapefruit category which looks and feels FAKE! Of course, there ARE the shallow guys out there who WANT the Barbie doll look. One woman I know who had the bigger 400CC implants, recent;ly had them taken OUT because of back pain  which was OK at first, minimal, but over a couple of years got to be worse and worse. It got so bad that even a Playtex 18 hour bra could not cope, let alone a lacy frilly thing from Victoria's Secret. Be prepared to support the weight, the bigger you go...|`|AA12133586	u do know that your breast will get firmer again over time after u stop breastfeeding right? buy a good supporting bra so your boob doesnt sag.. FYI u do know that after u have the boob jobs u have to take them out again after 10 yrs right?
xzNr2RmIaa	Overall you're best with organic plugs.  You're only at 00 though so the smell is nowhere near as bad as it could be if they were bigger. That's why you see people whose lobes are stretched pretty large wearing [generally] wooden plugs.  They're more porous so they absorb some of the oils and things on your plugs.  I have steel tunnels as well. It's not hard to slip them out and clean them off (and your lobes) while you're in the shower.  If you do this they won't smell for most of the day, if not the whole day.  But if you wanna go organic, I'd recommend wood.  Organic plugs can get REALLY expensive though.|`|SrF2uUzcaa	uhm i think thats nasty why ruin ur ears?|`|9WshfnFvaa	umm ear plugs make u look like a f******* freak...    unless u r some sort of tribal chick, dont do it.    its sooo not attractive    plastic surgery is the only way to fix it and even with that u still look like a f******* freak....|`|1PpT9MRSaa	I think glass looks cool but im not sure which tye is really healthier.

YwHl37Hgaa	Hair loss is caused by many reasons such as malnutrition, illness, tension and other health problems.Perming, straightening, hair dyeing and bleaching ,hot combing, using heated rollers and hot wax inevitably damage the hair.Badly damaged hair breaks at the scalp.

I look for a kind of cute guy who is fun to be with (makes me laugh) and listens to me, but basically I have to have lots of fun with him.  4. I would date a 16-year-old guy if I was 15, 16 (which i am), or 17, otherwise I don't want to be too much older than him.

And neither should what you are wearing. And also, every girl has their own taste in what they look for in a guy. Like, I love guys who wear skinny jeans and are kind of emo bad boys. Lol. And some other girls may not like that.|`|wvN4HLhLaa	Hmm....dress like Criss Angel and everythings alright =)  But I only date guys that are at least 4 years older than me|`|UNKTNLa3aa	if i was an older lady i dont think that i would date a sixteen year old sorry but usually what a lady looks fo in a guy is honesty and well mannered and doesnt act dumb and also not a guy that thinks of her as a toy!
YXRHgWb8aa	He is not ugly by any means but he has to get rid of the beard for sure. And turn that baseball hat around or don't wear it at all. It's so dated. But other than that, he's a good looking young man.|`|FLFOBFMzaa	old and dirtty looking|`|xehYhMpwaa	He's def not ugly. However he should shave and take off that hat. The "street" look puts me (and plenty of other girls) off.|`|UtiTJddfaa	shave the beard gio to a cluba nd find a girl. there is someone for everyone!! :)
Qe8LE7DFaa	THIS IS GREAT I'MMA MODEL TAKE MY ADVICE!  they look for your height, weight,face structure, and how you smile with your eyes not your face and can you walk the catwalk good and is your posture great. can you dress and are you pretty!|`|Ekb28A7Haa	Tall (5'9'' and above)  Thin (how much depends on what kind of model you want to be; runway models are very thin... like 100-120 at 5'11'')  Usually, they look for non-distinct facial features such as a small nose, short distance between nose and mouth, eyes at a good distance apart, and a child-like forehead (something that can be like an empty canvas that can be manipulated with makeup)... in other instances, someone might be "discovered" because of unique or striking facial features.  Buy Vogue and look through all the adds and articles for examples.|`|5412173baed2a21884761c1f6bde287baa	Aside from the physical features, I hope they look for girls who can be taught and who take direction. There's nothing worse than being on set with some girl who can't take direction. Pretty girls are a dime a dozen, but if I'm paying an agency to bring me a girl to sell my stuff she sure as hell better be able to do the job and not waste my time and money.|`|kX8lqxo1aa	it really depends on what kind of modeling you want to do if you want to be a catalog model you need to be tall and slender sometimes the modeling agencys tell you what kind of modeling you would be good for  hope i helped|`|R6UKeSRTaa	Height, Slim, STRONG face shape..

FIwhZSHhaa	its just the lightning (the main thing) and makeup in movies...i have met some actors who look so fair on screen but when i saw them in person they were a lot darker...|`|BGNdKvXzaa	Perhaps like black folks prior to our cultural revolution of the 60s, lighter skinned people have always been deemed more attractive by the masses since the beginning of time.  So, it stands to reason that perhaps people promoted as attractive by Indians or within Indian culture would tend to be more "European" in their appearance.|`|lOnmz6LLaa	it is the care they take|`|DoN0ayEFaa	I can't stand them. I don't like people who use skin whiteners.|`|XbCnarlHaa	lady they take their care abt skin  and make up  and they do yoga|`|fGu5tSUCaa	They take lot of care  by diet as well as lots of workout for flawless complexion.But itseems that they are not fair as they have shown onscreen.But we can improve the complexion or look fair naturally.To achieve that we need to follow some tips    1.Eat sprouts which can improve the complexion internally  2.take fruits which tend to improve complexion like banana which is rich in B vitamin,Black grape Juice ,Apple With milk,Orange Juice With Honey,Strawberries,  3.Drink carrot+cucumber+beetroot juice.  4.Apart from internal skin care,it is necessary to take care of skin externally.If you dont have time to follow above steps and if you want to improve the complexion and want to become fair in short span like 15 days you can apply Ultimate Fairness Pack which is mainly used for improving the complexion,it also cures acne and fades away the tan.Its a complete skin care.Worth trying.

g4AAZRuxaa	Just tell them I am sure they would understand they are you friends.|`|2ZOkyoSJaa	Firstly, it's best to just buy the bridesmaids dresses, but if you can't you need to sit down and explain to your friends the situation. You will just have to hope that as friends they will understand. Also, since they have to spend their own money buying the dresses then you need to give up the idea of having them dressed in expensive matching dresses. The most you can ask from them is that they have a certain color. What I would suggest is that you find someone to do the hair, if you find a hairstylist locally they will usually give you a rate to be available for say, 4 hours. That way you can help the girls cut down on some of their cost and everyone can afford to have a fun day and still look nice.|`|ZVHq9GcLaa	they should already know they have too, that is part of being in the wedding party...buying your own clothes, paying to get your hair done, buying shoes...    the bride MIGHT buy the jewerly as a bridal party gift (if she wants them all to match...)    http://www.goweddinggifts.com/bridesmaid...|`|cYFblmpVaa	you do not  that is awful to do  if you cannot afford them then you need to tone down your wedding|`|s7FBDZpbaa	say "if you have any money we can go shopping togather for it.|`|ot8tImmcaa	yea i think how thats its supposed to be|`|ltst5ELYaa	you dnt. you wanna have the wedding you should pay for it if they can seriously not afford it.  know how it feels when someone says i have to pay and i cannot afford it. you made the designs u pay|`|107405bbcdb915439a0fd322a6701663aa	i think it's normal protocol that bridemaids buy their own dresses. i always have. so just tell them. it's customary for you to buy them a gift though, and i've been in weddings where the bride buys like the shoes as the gift.|`|xoXkHOVsaa	Do you have a certain dress you want them all to wear?  If it is expensive they may not want to spend the money.    It might be better to show them the color you want them all to wear and let them choose their own dresses.|`|1vKiGBF4aa	just tell them. & they can do what all the other red blooded american women do, keep the tag on it and take it back.|`|2NzCS7ALaa	easy just tell them that in every wedding one is required to buy there own stuff trust me they will understand! It's always been this way!|`|neNfeluIaa	You don't.  That is a given when you agree to be a bridesmaid.  If they refuse to pay, do not have them in the wedding.|`|ynpaxeTmaa	Go to them and say "You need to buy your own dress and stuff"  That should do it.|`|G8ESMK3Iaa	Well they are suppose to, so I would just ask them if they know that is what they are suppose to do. But be nice and pick a b/m dress that can be worn to other occasions, a nice evening dress or something.|`|2OmvzvLoaa	You say, " Bridesmaids, you need to buy your own dresses and stuff."  Like that see?|`|vEv2YwWdaa	That is not normal.  At least not in any wedding I have ever been to.  I am at the age when everyone is getting married.  If you can not afford to buy the dresses maybe you should not have bridesmaids?  You do not need to have them.  To ask someone to a bridesmaid makes them feel like they can not say no, then you tell them they now have to spend money to do so.  It's not classy at all.|`|e4596390515e8d11a71ef13fed732cc9aa	When you ask them to be one tell them you would really like them to be a bridesmaid in your wedding and that if they are able to, they will have to cover the expenses of their dress, shoes, and accessories.  If they cannot afford it or disagree, they wont be a bridesmaid.  Just be up front with them so they have time to save/plan, etc.  Also, keep in mind, you may want to go with a less expensive design/style, etc. if they have to fork out the cost themselves.  If you cant afford them to be in a very nice/expensive dress too.  Some never wear the dress again so that's something to think about too.|`|n6hbo70vaa	It's tradition...unless you offer, bridesmaids always buy their own dresses.  They should be honored that you chose them to be in your wedding and shouldn't have a problem spending the money on a dress.|`|Ii0PpO8naa	Where I'm from, that is just assumed that the bridesmaid buys her own dress and shoes.  I've never been in, or heard of a wedding, where the bride bought the dresses.      The bride has enough to pay for.  Buying the dress is part of the agreement of being a bridesmaid.  The bride usually buys the jewelry for the girls, and gives it to them at rehearsal dinner.  I've never heard of a bride buying the dresses.    From my own experience, you should choose a dress that isn't too expensive and that can be worn again.  A floor-length evening gown is too formal to ever wear again and the girls will appreciate a dress they can use after the wedding.    Check JCrew.com, my dress for my cousin's wedding was from there.  $150 and totally wearable.  I love it.  http://www.jcrew.com/AST/Browse/WeddingP...|`|LU6vfqRzaa	Back in the day, bridesmaids knew that they had to buy their own dresses and shoes.    I provided them with the head pieces, earrings and necklaces and gave it to them at the dinner rehearsal party.    Go all together and decide on which dress will fit every ones budget and tell them that they are responsible for paying for it and the shoes, and you will pick up the tab for the accessories.    :-)|`|xv3opX9Maa	thats like inviting somebody to your birthday and telling them they need to bring there own cake and stuff  ( =|`|jHyHQJJQaa	tell them you will buy their dresses if they buy their own stuff|`|1hciyvKdaa	Choose realistically who you know can pay for thier own dress, my neighbor didnt realize this and asked 4, and the matron of honor, she would up buying for all and had barely any money for her own gown,  Heres was a hundred on sale theres were like 168.00 each not sure of the mh cost. I couldnt do it, so I asked my cousin to be my mh and she was flying in and I asked her at the last minute because I had no money to buy anyone a dress and knew noone would have that money and didnt want friends having problems with their parents trying to borrow it.

6YwLlYovaa	lol I know it looks so pretty! i bought it at first 'cos I thought it'd look nice on my vanity, but I find it works really well as a lengthening mascara. better then define-a-lash, which was my fave maybelline lengthening mascara before this one.  If volume's what you're after this wouldn't be the mascara for you (diorshow or lashblast would be your best bets)  but if you want super long flirty lashes then this is the mascara you need. it works great.  plus it's sooo pretty!|`|xhjSPd0uaa	its good for a natural look, it doesnt make a dramatic difference or make them very noticeable but just gives them abit of length, good for daytime looks x

cb1214610a5fdd53f968fe94fc3b7f26aa	Your hair color looks very nice just the way it is. The black would give you more of a goth look. I think you'd look really cute as a strawberry blonde.|`|ZMVs9bGxaa	keep your hair the way it is its such a pretty colour and if you dye it it might never get back to that! get a bright coloured clip in streak like hot pink would look edgy but removable!  if black hair really is what you want then just so you know you could definitely pull it off! your really pretty! but if you do go for black get an edgier scene haircut to complete the look, a bright streak would look really good though!  =) hope that helped!|`|UuYVehSsaa	Black hair would look fine on you.|`|b6356b9558163864dfaed163316ee3b1aa	noooooo ! your hair is gorgeous, please dont ruin it like 'scene' people do.

B8WEoAiKaa	Just scream like a mouse !:)|`|575UxSKfaa	I'm sorry I don't know what brands they use, but I know they want to achieve a very pale look and will probably use a cream based makeup foundation a shade of two lighter than their skin. Powder on top of that, translucent, or lighter.   The mouth is always small and reddish but not overpowering.   Cheeks are reddish to rosy, just in the center, and eyebrows are very thin and penciled over for definition.  That's my interpretation.  :)  I don't think the the eyes are overplayed because the baby-doll look wouldn't really emphasize the eyes.   They are already pretty enough. :)
TLgiTFh4aa	Although It's not in the same context really, I think It's still relevant in your case.  A wise man once told me this.

lIpjuMTHaa	Its basically emergency birth control that can be used up to like 5 days after sex. Its just like birth control but a little more controversial because some people believe the baby starts forming as soon as the sex happens and they say its like a really early abortion.|`|ro3X9fs3aa	Plan B is an emergency contraceptive that can prevent a pregnancy after unprotected sex, contraceptive failure, or sexual assault. If taken as directed within 72 hours (3 days) of unprotected sex, Plan B reduces the chance of pregnancy by up to 89%. But the sooner you take it, the more effective it will be.       Plan B,is safe and effective, is FDA-approved and contains lvonorgestrel, the same ingredient found in many birth control pills. The difference is that Plan B is two pills taken 12 hours apart and uses a larger dose of levonorgestrel than a single birth control pill. And, unlike many birth control pills, Plan B doesn't contain any estrogen, only progestin. Plan B? isn't RU-486 (the abortion pill); it won't work if you're already pregnant, and it won't affect an existing pregnancy.      Plan B isn't regular birth control and should not be used that way.  is not as effective as other methods of birth control used consistently and correctly. It's important to have another reliable source of birth control that's right for you. Plan B won't protect you from HIV infection (the virus that causes AIDS) or any other sexually transmitted disease (STD).     plan B is available without a prescription for consumers 18 and older. If you're 17 or younger, you'll need to see  a healthcare professional,|`|bAYVSfdJaa	It's the morning after pill... It's just a high dose of birth control that forces your period to come.

If it has already implanted in the egg, it will not cause you to become unpregnant.
f7PlvV4Baa	eww it probably looked greasy. i think use less and dilute it with water
pIBOSkfsaa	you need to take a trip to ikea check out their website for closet storage solutions and bonus ikea is predominantly environmentally friendly and dirt cheap. www.ikea.com|`|EYZFCalQaa	my friend has 78 purses, and stres them all in her closet.  she does this easily because she bought a hanging rack, and can just slide the purses in and off it when she wants to use them.  they are probably sold at some place like target or walmart.|`|xjuM12QVaa	i have a MILLION purses one to go with every outfit and i keep all of mine on a rack on the inside and out of my closet hope i helped=p

yTxVfUDcaa	honestly you dont need to get rid of it most people do know unless they actually look at it and think about it. it will only be a problem when its like black colored, all over your body has hair, most are so tiny you cant even see them, but the peach fuzz wont really matter. if you want to get rid of it just wax it off.    DONT SHAVE IT!! it will just grow back thicker and darker colored than before|`|qxAcwDsjaa	its a mustache. you shave it|`|nAvTMXmgaa	its little very thin hair on you upper lip. You can bleach it.
apvqcpEFaa	If you put a brown over those highlights, the highlights should turn into a pretty caramel color on the dark brown..making it look like you've got natural highlights. Also, if you put a blonde over it..the same thing will happen. It's like if you take a white shirt & wash it with some black jeans..the shirt will turn gray because that color went over the white. See what I mean? .?|`|WxTSgXTeaa	If you use a darker color it should cover the bleached out streaks.

VP2fsPWzaa	i don't think cutting can change your hair type. my brother shaved his head a few times and it grew back exactly the way it was!!!     there are some products like frizzease that might help n also check this website out: http://www.associatedcontent.com/article...
vUIoms0Gaa	Apply a light shade of eye shadow to the crease of the upper lid.   Curl eyelashes with an eyelash curler. Apply a coat of thickening mascara on the top lashes only. Apply Second coat while first is wet, waiting for just a few seconds will dry it out and will clump it and get in your eye and that would NOT be comfortable.Use a sharpened black eye liner to the inner corner of the eye and top. Use your pinky to steady your hand, by placing it on your cheek, just below the eye.     or maybe   Use eyeliner only on the outer rim of the eyelids, not the inner rim. Blend eyeliner with a cotton swab rather than leaving it as a harsh line.Avoid drawing eyeliner on the inner corner of the lower lid; instead, start the line at the beginning of eyelash growth or even closer to the middle of the eye. Use a light shade of eye shadow on the upper lid leading up to the brow, which will open up the eye. A darker color can be used in the fold of the eye.Consider wearing false eyelashes to give your eyes a more wide-eyed, innocent look. Be sure to use natural-looking eyelashes. Curl your eyelashes with an eyelash curler before applying mascara to give you the same effect as false eyelashes. Try a black mascara if brown does not bring out your eyes enough.  hope this helps :) maybe watch this video xD  http://www.videojug.com/film/how-to-make...|`|Pej2G6DYaa	will blue eye makeup works for me|`|SaJGn5q8aa	I line my eyes on the inside of my bottom eyelid and then to make them look bigger i glide liguid liner on my top eyelid and at the outside edge flip out like a "cats-eye" look. Lots of people have said my eyes look bigger like that!|`|rENVXGd3aa	yeah !  all you have to do is put eyeliner on the lower lid, on the inside of it, not under it. then, you lift up your eyelid and put on eyeliner on the inside of that. they also have some eyeshadow that makes your eyes look more defined, but it depends what color your eyes are. hope i helped !  ps:by the inside of your eye, i mean not INSIDE your eyesocket,just on the place where it meets your eyeball :D|`|p64xm6Qqaa	Heyy    Well First of all Line Just under your bottom eyelids,with black liquid/pencil eyeliner..    then just put on light goldy beige makeup up  to the brows    lots of mascara    and hey presto!    hope ive been of help somehow :D|`|TcZMjh2jaa	I like to use white eyeliner on the water line then lightly brush the lash line with black eyeliner and smudge

But i wouldnt be suprized if i did it when i get older and start having wrinkles. But im never gonna get my boobs done i know that much.|`|SWKcmKQ4aa	No, I would never get my boobs done, wouldn't you want to feel them when a guy is like feeling them or something, lolz.  and I don't know about the scar/stretch mark one, I'd probably get that done.|`|jycDSmPcaa	Erm, not sure if this counts as plastic surgery but I'd definitely like liposuction and possibly a gastric band or something.    I hate my body, and no matter what I do it will not change. I don't lose weight no matter how little I eat, I don't tone no matter how much I exercise. . . I hate myself.|`|o34YHLiraa	Yes, I would have plastic surgery... my chest is pretty seriously deformed (aesthetically, not medically) and I want to get it fixed when I save up enough money.
wVJ4PJJXaa	Whatever you do, don't go for all black.  You are much too young for that! Try a cute v-neck top with a camisole underneath (still shows off the girls without them screaming "HEY LOOK AT ME!"      Also a pair of dark wash, bootleg jeans slim down the legs & booty.  Go for a pair of comfy heels to round out the look.    I find that watching What Not to Wear on TLC helps a lot when it comes to dressing the female figure.|`|JdFgf575aa	Black.  YOU ARE FINE.

9VB4uWhMaa	Clearasil Ultra Face Wash is a great product.       The best thing you can do is to start taking some vitamins and minerals that help fight acne from the inside out.  http://www.alteracne.com/vitamin-treatme...|`|dTG5UXACaa	clearasil, but if youv got sensitive skin use claritin|`|TxSTwLQUaa	What I use is acnefree. I got it at meijer. It was about $20 maybe? I've had it for over 2 months & still haven't gotten a new bottle. & I use it everyday! It lasts. But I also use a washcloth & put soap & water on it & scrub my face for about 2 minutes every other day.    Hope I help! I hate acne, it hurts.  Heres a website for acnefree.  http://www.acnefree.com/af|`|NHKOVg4Taa	Firstly you need to be taking care of yourself by drinking plenty of water and eating a healthy diet i.e limiting junk, fatty food as much as possible.  Also make sure that you wash your face regularly and even changing your bed sheets/pillow cases often helping to keep the bacteria at bay stopping re-infection of sensitive skin.    Here is a website that I do recommend it works for curing acne fast and effective from inside out!
VKLyDiQ7aa	I would firstly skip the hair spray unless you really think your hair needs it to hold a style.  Secondly, make sure you are using some sort of heat protectant product (Herbal Essences has one in their "Dangerously Straight" line of products).  Also, I am assuming you live in a place that gets below freezing in the winter.  Your problem may be that your hair needs moisture, so use a moisturizing shampoo,  Lastly, if all else fails, use a dryer sheet!  Seriously.  Get a cheap pack of the fabric softener sheets and keep some in a sandwich bag in your purse/backpack/whatever.  Whenever your hair gets really staticky, just lightly rub it on your hair in a downward motion, it really works.|`|CnHIHCwtaa	use anti curl and frizz stuff. the anti frizz is the best but anti curl works too idk y|`|zPFclJznaa	dont wear winter hats: wear hoods instead! use leave in conditioner, its designed to keep your hair smooth and in place: but it doesnt make hair sticky and brittle. also, use a comb, because brushes make your hair static!|`|ZAgxSKlLaa	get some uncented dryer sheets from the grocery store and rub them on your hair after you blow dry it then straighten it...cheap way!|`|SWKcmKQ4aa	Get lotion and rub it into your hands really good then put it in your hair, I do it all the time.|`|QKW3aHGUaa	It might be your brush... Mine does that when I use this one plastic brush... Other than that, a little moisture usually gets rid of the static.
IbI487CYaa	Even if you put your face on here I doubt anyone you know will recognize you. Also, it's not like once they see your face they will instantly know where you live and be able to stalk you. But I understand wanting to have your privacy because I feel the same.    Anyway, no it's not dangerous to do that.|`|SC3jqHZCaa	..wow|`|fU1WLz6Qaa	I don't think it's dangerous to put your face on the internet. Just don't but pictures of you doing anything you might regret.   as for your face shape, here's a chart you can look at to compare|`|QKW3aHGUaa	In my opinion, just a picture of you doesn't put you in any danger... Unless you have your home address painted on your face... Like anyone out there is going to go "Alright, that one right there... I'm going to find them and rape them... Well, it's not my mother... 1 down 6 billion to go... I'll find him/her someday!"|`|a38LoaBiaa	its fine.|`|tYztvzDkaa	no|`|ftWsPGNfaa	omggg, no youll get raaaaaped.|`|T7HSCKqBaa	Just put your entire face on, loser.  Why the hell would it be dangerous??  Don't you have Facebook? (Everyone does) and your face is there..  So why would you have to worry about something like this??|`|Z0ou5lqvaa	the only way putting ur face on the internet is unsafe is if you:     Have your school, street address, social security number, or phone number..|`|J3uQqHDtaa	It's fine. Putting an actual picture of your whole face is fine too. Think of all the places you could live in the world.... People aren't going to be able to come get you or something by just seeing a picture.    If you're worried about people using your picture and saying it's theirs.. Um.. That won't happen?    Sorry. Just read the first part of my answer.|`|CmRYICAUaa	Don't do it!!  From the tiny thumbnail you have on here you'll be tracked down by Identity thieves and be kidnapped!!|`|ncPdftafaa	yeah if that pic has your phone number, address and social security number on it.
LXCfeUbjaa	yeah, you can. when you go to check out online, there will probably be a spot to put a promotional code or a pin number or giftcard number or something. the number will be on your giftcard.  if you have trouble finding it, maybe call their customer service.

Take them out in the morning and flip your hair upside down and comb your fingers through it. Works for me. :)

Ky46fsYuaa	i think that hairstyle is sooo cute!  you should go for it.  i wish my hair was curly  :P|`|yjGJHGlsaa	i have the same (side swept bangs and really curly hair) and all my friends always comment on how good it looks definitely get them!  it also look really good with a curly up do and leave the bangs out but left curly not straightened!|`|KzuGcaAxaa	it depends on the shape of your face.  if your face is round i dnt think the style would look on you because you do not want to give a lot of volume to the sides of your face.  but if your face type is long you might just pull it off.  click on this link http://www.visual-makeover.com/face.htm    it will give you some advice on what type of hairstyles go with your face shape.    Hope this helps!!! and good luck!!|`|cIh5EI3eaa	NO!!! I have extremely curly hair. Unless you straighten all of your hair it will look rediculus/hideous.|`|XCxSXfKkaa	i am just like u and i have extremely curly hair and i've done the side swept bangs before and i dnt think they look bad.|`|CnHIHCwtaa	my friend has that and she looks sooo good. she burned her forehead doing it tho..be careful!! but it looks great|`|XVTH4C5qaa	I have REALLY curly hair...and i have bangs too!!  I actually Blow dry my bangs with a round brush..I think it would look weird if u flat ironed them...But having the bangs blow dried gives them a little fluff so it wont look weird...(I keep my bangs on the left..)...Out of curiosity how long is ur hair?
apvqcpEFaa	I have bleached platinum highlights in my hair & trust me, bleach does NOT come out. You have to wait for your roots to come through, that's the only way the blonde color with go away .?|`|vn16f38naa	I THINK you said that you buzz it every few weeks correct? I wouldn't get dramatic over it, it will grow back soon. And cutting it helps, it makes it grow back back faster too :]
6c5W7xl9aa	It depends on what price you are ready to pay.    try the site below, it's an ok site.i like it cos of the prices :)|`|hUdiFUaCaa	Try the Nike web site.
c56e8a27e1fe5b4843f30c8834cc5d35aa	Spray your shoes with something like ScotchGard or CampDry Performance Fabric Protector.
vI9sPiIGaa	you look great|`|wVJ4PJJXaa	Do you have bangs? Bangs are always a fun way to switch up a look. Maybe color your hair a shade darker to play up your features. Try a chocolate brown...      Ps-You dont need any makeup.|`|oCxBeEI6aa	I think you should go with dyeing your hair reddish brown. If you've already done it, you'll know you would look good. Also, if you didn't like it and you really want to try something new, go with dark brown. It's only hair and if you don't like it, you can dye it back. I saw your picture, and dark brown would look great! If you're using just regular chap stick, go with a brighter color. You could change your style with clothes to stand out, too. :)  Good luck!|`|voMoxvsNaa	go dark  a lot of people look a lot cuter with dark hair.    and foget the blush and go for mascara.       please answer my hair advice one.  Thanks.|`|c7EKakQ9aa	shave it all off like brittney|`|vUIoms0Gaa	I think you should maybe go dark brown looks like it would suite you xD maybe get a side bang?
5YMkieeXaa	i constantly get that question.    any way you dont tie it at all    you wrap it around your neck to the fit you like then you tuck the extra part under the main section.|`|eDP3YU5Laa	you dont tie it  its haird to explain it  sorry..|`|PGCswWFpaa	You don't tie it you wrap it around and kinda fluff it in the front|`|KmnHehkcaa	take the two ends n hold them n put it behind ur neck, tie it in a knot n loosen the front up.|`|EQPE72hpaa	Fold the scarf into a triangle, then; tie the back into a regular knot.|`|fwsn1VWsaa	Just the same? Size and shape?   If so, then just fold it in half - from point to point - and then tie it around your neck like a necklace. (:|`|XzeGabPUaa	You fold it diagonaly so it makes a triangle like a few times and tie it around the neck|`|f7wz4GcUaa	http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ltN2G8Mx...
aSP60sZraa	something like this--> http://www.hairfinder.com/celebrityhair/...    or this-->  http://www.womenshairstylesonline.com/Ha...
wVJ4PJJXaa	Try navy, hunter greens, plums, anything where the color is deep and rich looking. Try to stay away from baby pinks, yellows...that will only make you look washed out.  You can do any color really as long as it is vibrant.     You have pretty skin tone, so show it off!

SDlusCUuaa	A lot of black people I know have highlights that are visible in the summer.  And I also know black peoples eyes that change with the sun.  So no, you're not an oddball :-)|`|AA10241709	I'm not sure about your eyes, but for hair, yes.    For me, my hair turns auburn red when I'm out in the sun quite a bit.  It's a very exotic look - people actually think I dyed it.  It comes from my mothers side which has Scandanavian ancestry - this happens to many of my relatives.    I don't know about your eyes, but it sounds quite unique and attractive!|`|Hq4iwWVzaa	No. My friend is half black half white, she only has black hair but her eyes are green.
7igxiGrAaa	Koolaid would just wash out.|`|NZjnMKXAaa	is kool aid permnent? NO  Can you die your hair with kool aid?

AND PEOPLE THAT SAY U CANT DYE IT WITH KOOLAID HAVE YOU TRIED LOOKING IT UP ON GOOGLE???     http://www.wikihow.com/Dye-Hair-With-Koo...|`|6a0f5242e106e58c4ca1b110e61eb592aa	That hair you shown us is not dark brown, that is a chestnut brown, which has some red in it. Dark brown has no real red in it...this pictures does. Whatever you choose to do, you will have to pull the color out by using a bleach. I am not going to explain to you all the steps, so I will recommend you go to a professional colorist and if you cannot do that, go to a reputable beauty supply store and ask someone who is knowledgeable  about hair color and processes. But do not ask her about putting Kool-aid in your hair, she will  think you are fooling. Kool-aid is a sugar drink that has no cosmetically useful properties to it. It just a sweet drink period and would wash out and cause your hair to be stiff and sticky after it dried. It would also stain the towels, etc.   What you need is something that will chemically alter you hair, not sweeten it, to achieve a red/auburn color.|`|NOz2NIMTaa	NO, it won't work! Just go to the store and buy a box of hair dye!|`|tpx1AHoPaa	you might need to bleach|`|CpLLA6Niaa	hahaha!!! You must be kidding that you want to use koolaid!  No, it won't work....hahaha|`|K4PzwkDjaa	my friend tried purple koolaid. it gave her hair a tent of purple and it smelled delicious, but did wash out.|`|CgvmWNLYaa	just leave your hair the way god made it. black hair is sooooo rare....you should be proud! well, if you dont follow this advice, good luck. btw, i dont recommend kool aid.|`|iBrVER9xaa	You should dye it jet black then get an emo cut, long in the back, and layered all around.  Then get highlights.  Good Luck!|`|RC2aQBkgaa	Yeah your right. I've tried it before. It's better than hair dye. Don't listen to those idiots it really works trust me. Try it it's really cool it gives you a nice outcome!|`|AGaQ4lpiaa	If i was you, i would get it professionally died, that way there is less change of the colours turning out wrong    If you don't want to spend all the money getting it professionally done, go to your local hair dresser and ask    personally i don't think the red koolaid would work.     Hope i helped|`|eepVUqg6aa	kool-aid with probably not work, even for a tint, without bleaching.    BUT, a good way to do this without using conventional hair dye is henna, which you can find in hot topic, pagan, or health food/nature type stores. it's usually used for skin tattoos, but I figured it out one day and my mother told me all of the germans used to tint their hair reddish with it.
41f1a6cff0ef3c6047e8ad3318fe3796aa	After having spend hundreds of dollars on different mascaras over the years, I've decided to stay true to Clinique's Glossy Mascara.  It doesn't go on too heavy or gloppy, doesn't flake or run, but comes off when you wash it.  It's in the silver metal straight tube.|`|02797a7699a7653821ce2dbd3ba78a2eaa	revlon fabulash. it doesnt dry your lashes and it doesnt have the ugly flakes when dried. only soft lashes ;)|`|a433ce9cf03d5b4e4c87d3feef31fab0aa	I prefer MAC ZoomLash. Its only about $11 and it doesn't clump, and it comes off easily with water. I'm pretty sure it also conditions your eyelashes. Good luck!|`|1c1cd0fa87ec36e1456f2507928e5fa2aa	i would say cover girl, volumize.... it doesn't leave clumps, and it's affordable|`|AA10533108	AVON Super Full Mascara <br>  I love it!!<br>  Super easy to come off and great brush for full lash look!|`|a72c7fa37c43b3a0d61b74cac85dcab6aa	check the links below for  Product revew on - * Top Ten Mascaras<br>  <a href="http://homebeautytips.blogspot.com/2006/11/top-ten-macara.html#name1" rel="nofollow">http://homebeautytips.blogspot.com/2006/...</a>|`|1a7faf690622e5d28d395902f7634919aa	I think that the best mascara is COVERGIRL volumeexact mascara. i use it all the time and i does come all the way off.
a5e6665d256468f2c11e85128c88137eaa	Victoria's Secret enhancer swinsuits are good, their like push-ups, with a little padding. That never hurt anyone, lol.|`|b850c954a80102f1db7667308453f10aaa	If you're small on top, you may want to try the better swimsuits from Brazil, such as ViX, or Salinas. These designers have adjusted their swimsuit patterns to the fit American market, however, they still run on the small side.<br>  <br>  Look for bikini tops with a touch of padding, or an under wire, demi-bra style that makes the most of a beautiful, dainty, bust line. Try to find a swimsuit top with adjustable straps at shoulders and around back so that you can tighten and adjust things, to help fill out the top line. Also, you might want to try a bandeau top, with, or without the neck straps, that has some gathers, which will give the illusion that there is more there.
36439efa77037bfd10ac9d0216e58cfeaa	Well doll, my friend Brooke and i lyke the Jessica Simpson looks better , the dress and the hair.<br>  but if its casual why go all out for the hair, just do soft curls or something.|`|AA11303176	Honestly, I am a hair dresser and didn't see much difference.  They were both sophisticated and classy.|`|d3d7636ff6834643b28574e594e34f52aa	i like the second one|`|5807f71fcd21b3e28723174575b4a771aa	I like the second one...but all that hair in your face is going to get annoying.|`|76ddf2723e3b90ed64a3dea97565ce63aa	I personally like the first one. They're both similar, but the second one, her hair is in her face, and I think for your dance, it should be pushed back a little like the first one.|`|AA11109495	OK. . i definitely LOVE the second look the one she is by herself. i think the hair over face makes it look very interesting...specially for a homecoming...good luck!|`|053d68439271469cf402d86b18ddcde6aa	did u mean the hair part cos you dont really see the dress the Second one defiantly luks sexy but casual jus work the hair and you,ll luk fab n dont forget to smile enjoyxx|`|AA10871206	i like the jessica simpson look in the first picture good luck|`|c1c2fd07a86913c82a84582b406efd6faa	they look similar to me, too. but its really completely up to you, and to tell you the truth, its not that  big of a deal. they both look sophisticated and pretty, but you shouldnt base YOUR hair on a picture of jessica Simpson. be creative. do it YOUR way. its ok to get ideas, but dont get all stuck on have EXACTLY her hair. thats impossible. sorry to burst your bubble!!! <br>  <br>  and if you really want to look your best, ask your FRIENDS. your DATE. your FAMILY. they know you best. not a whole bunch of Cybergeeks like myself.<br>  <br>  sorry!
2cb31040cb07da20afe36799509911d9aa	You could either get a perm, and it will be curly then start getting less curly/more wavy until it fades to straight. otherwise, getting your hair cut shorter makes it more naturally wavy, but that wont work the same on everyone, it just depends on your hair type. good luck! :-)|`|beaa8a241d938cfc5a0d8be729a83d7eaa	Sometimes if your hair wants to be naturally curly or wavy you can find the right length by experimenting.  You have to let all the perms and hot roller crap grow out though.  If you go natural though, you will be subject to the effects of humidity changes.  Culry when high, straight when low.  I am a man, but it works the same for either|`|67f0ca4f52e8261c971699622968dcf3aa	You could get a perm|`|0c96e0ab32f1042239d7cf9f6e63a4c2aa	some hair is wavier when it's shorter.and even people with straight hair can get a wave if they let their hair air dry.|`|eb8e3bbf96553c27c58dd5d8b1ecd32faa	you could get a perm, get a short haircut, then wear a doo rag as much as possible

(I am a white woman so that's not really a good look for me!)<br>  <br>  I haven't tried the Restorative Hair Treatment like they said to use before shampooing your hair.  I just can't stand the smell!  It's kind of a burnt wet tobacco smell.

AA12005273	The previous answer gave you very sound advice on the diet part. Eating a healthy, balanced diet, avoiding artificial foods and being physically active is the way to do it.<br>  As far as the fake breasts are concerned, I think they are impressive when you look at them but I do not personally like how they feel, so all other things being equal I would prefer the girl with the reall ones.<br>  I would not recomend them.|`|ff2269a2bd5d7e9e24e4faa811238c43aa	Well, as far as the diet goes I would say just eat a balanced diet with very little sweets, chips, etc... and excercise regularly: walk, jog, lift light weights, even if you don't loose alot of weight you will look & feel 10x better.
b00db8841749394d3e2ccafe8aca7886aa	You two are not together. If you're not sure, you're not BUT clear it up with her. If she gave you a kiss and a hug and accepted your date, then maybe she likes you too. You already told her you liked her, so the tough part's over. Just ask her and COMMUNICATE :]|`|c98178d9efa19f35dc0877676eee4639aa	Ask her directly, maybe she's a bit shy to show her true feelings.|`|77fee0ad1f690baf9e078ef624eb4f35aa	Wait a bit. Then give her a call and make random conversation. See how she responds to you. Observe what her vibe is like. If you're comfortable, ask her if she wants to go out again. But if she seems to acting odd, I would leave it alone. Trust me, if she's into you, you'll know. You went out once. There's no reason for her to pretend or hide the way she feels if she likes you. If she doesn't, it will show itself.|`|AA10075107	OH YES YOUR GOING OUT STEADY|`|a2ca0f3d8ee699425d1efbfde540a800aa	Wait a day, and if she doesn't say anything... ask her out again.<br>  Try inplying that you really had a good time, and that you would like to see her again. try to get her to say it, but don't pry to hard. All I have to say is that, she might be private. So don't try to push it.<br>  <br>  Good Luck!!

NOz2NIMTaa	Well, you stop growing about 3 or so years after you get your period.... But, i was your height at 11, and now I'm 16 and 5'11... Maybe you'll turn out like me, eh?|`|8vo6CRhZaa	Im pretty sure you will, you wont officially stop growing for like another 8-10 years. But everyones different.|`|l8yfpyy1aa	You will almost certainly grow taller.  Look at the rest of your family for an idea of how tall you will become.  Women generally end up as tall as their mothers, and perhaps an inch or more taller.  However, there are many factors that influence your ultimate height.
Ij6JMY4Xaa	that sounds so cute! with the dress being short...it is sure to bring attention to you especially if you have long legs!|`|mh0QRDE9aa	You would never get out of my house dressed like that.

Maybe an extreme sport or volunteering?|`|Q0Cq3G2Taa	go to the us|`|RUvQtskcaa	cheerleading is a team sport. i would advise taking a few gymnastics classes first so you can learn some tumbling. then contact an elite cheerleading team (i used to do it for the titan all stars now i do it for my high school. but honestly i don't even think the titans are around anymore...)    look online for elite cheer teams in your area. it is honestly the best sport around. you meet great people and you get sooooo fit! also if you are small you could get to fly like i do :P    i definitely recommend cheering. i decided to try it and now it is my life. it is all i think about and it is my favorite hobby/activity.   also take up photography. that's cool too

The further you go from your natural color, the more you're going to have to get it touched up. <br>  Go in to a salon for a consultation, they should have swatches there for you to hold against your skin to see what looks best. Take in pictures of other peoples hair color that you like. <br>  <br>  As a general rule, once your natural color is determined by the stylist, only go at the most 3 shades lighter or darker than that. This will generally give you an idea of how far you can travel from nature with out the process or upkeep being too drastic.<br>  <br>  Any time hair is lightened, it is a permanent process.<br>  <br>  You could try changing the TONE of your hair using a temporary color. Either warming it up or cooling it off. The subtlety is up to you. <br>  Beware of redken shades, it contains silicone and is difficult to reverse. It also contains a higher concentration of peroxide than what I use to cover my clients grey hair.<br>  <br>  Walking into a salon saying things like strawberry blonde, caramel, champagne blonde, chocolate, mahogany, auburn etc...will get you nowhere.<br>  First of all, every clients interpretation of a descriptive color is different. <br>  Secondly, each color line has a different interpretation of colors as well.

62c8033983f74ce307586eb112bcf4fdaa	First, a pattern maker draws a jeans pattern based upon measurements (of samples) that were supplied by the jeans designer or the buyer's merchandiser.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  It takes approximately 15 pieces that make up a standard pattern for a pair of standard 5 pocket jeans.<br>  <br>  A person, or a computer program, will then calculate the optimal fabric consumption by puzzling all the pieces of the jeans pattern on a paper that is placed on top of the denim fabric. After drawing the cutting lines onto this paper:<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  the fabric is ready to be cut, the denim is laid out in layers on a cutting table. Up to 100 layers of denim are stacked and weights are put on top of it to hold the denim fabric in place, while it is being cut. <br>  <br>      <br>  <br>  The separate parts of the jeans are cut with a textile cutting machine and each piece is then marked with it's size, using a piece of chalk so it won't show after washing. <br>  <br>  All of these pieces of cut denim are then put into bundles by size.<br>  <br>   <br>  <br>  It takes about 1.6 meters of denim fabric, several hundred meters of sewing thread, 6 rivets, 1 or 5 jeans buttons, 4 labels (usually imitation leather), and optionally a zipper to make a pair of jeans. An average jeans factory can make about 2.500 pair of jeans per day. <br>  <br>  There are different machines for each handling. <br>  <br>      <br>   <br>      <br>     <br>  <br>  On average, it will take about 15 minutes and 12 steps to make one pair of blue jeans.<br>  <br>  After the denim jeans are sewn together, they go out to a jeans washing plant where they are washed in what could best be described as: standard, yet very big, washing machines.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  A stonewash for 150 pairs of jeans takes 150 kilos of pumice stone and more than 750 liters of water. Depending on how faded the look will have to be, they will be washed somewhere between 30 minutes and 6 hours.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  After the stone-washing process the denim garment is inspected for faults and loose threads are cut.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>   <br>  <br>  Next the button(s) and rivets are placed using a special type of press.<br>  <br>      <br>  <br>  After that the jeans go on to the garment packing room where final quality inspection takes place and paper tags and labels are placed or attached.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  A typical pair of jeans will have a hang tag, joker ticket, pocket flasher, leg sticker, inside care label with product of origin and assorted product id tags. When all is done, the jeans will be placed in a poly bag with proper warning text<br>  <br>   <br>  <br>      <br>  <br>  and packed in a box or bag, depending on the destination country, as some countries or territories have more strict packing regulations than others. <br>  <br>  xoxox best answer.*)|`|c178981b5b65aa5c946dfca53b95a9b7aa	from china.|`|AA11766439	there made in a sweat shop in taiwan by 9 yr olds out of high quality denim|`|650597474263dab6f3548b45e1f4b0f3aa	tightly spun and then tightly woven dyed cotton. they might dye it before or after they assemble the actual jeans. usually after though|`|811001cb57a181518c53e7a4d24804e8aa	read this article about jeans - <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeans" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeans</a><br>  <br>  Ad

What I do is a shampoo with Garneir Fructise Sleek & Shine, and use the conditioner. If you want your hair to not dry out only shampoo every other day, and make sure to ALWAYS use conditioner. Also use the Sleek & Shine Deep Conditioner product twice a week which helps make your hair healthier and stronger.<br>  <br>  Try not blowdrying your hair before you straighten it. If you can wash your hair at night and let it dry naturally over night and straigten it in the morning. If you must blow dry, before you blow dry use the Sleek and Shine Anti Frizz Serum when your hair is still wet. Then after blow drying put a dab through your hair before straigtening. This helps with the flyaways and such, and prevents it from drying even more.<br>  <br>  I also just recently bought a Chi hair straightner, they are a bit pricy but they are the best straigtners. They lock in the moisture instead of taking it away from your hair.<br>  <br>  Also, if you want extra sleekness/shine use Biosilk Shine On.

Also, I don't know if guys do this, but if you only wash your hair like every other day or every every other day, it will be a lot healthier. I straighten my hair almost everyday with my chi.

They also have an assortment of make-up bags/cosmetic purses, etc. (Also, more than $1 a piece) but everything is priced VERY well.  If you have a Target store near you, and don't want to pay for shipping by buying it online, go to the store and buy it there.  Some of the items seem a bit small compared to what you're used to, but remember, it's only a buck! I'm quite pleased with my purchases so far especially considering the entire price of my purchase...for $14 I got (1) black mascara, (1) clear mascara, (2) lip bams, (1) lip stick, (2) make-up brushes (great quality brushes, btw!), (1) cover-stick and (1) eyeliner with sharpener and I got it all shipped to my house in 3 days!  I would have paid that much at walmart for just foundation and mascara!|`|EVd2NvhWaa	I've never used it before, but i read in teenpeople that the elf plumping lip gloss didnt really plump very much, but had a nice shine.<br>  <br>  if you REALLY want to get cheap cosmetics, do what i do and wait for maybelline and cover girl to go buy one get one free or 40% off, and usually you can find $2.00 coupons on the products somewhere like rite aid, eckerd, or cvs........most places will take a coupon off both the regular priced item AND the free item, so you're getting off super cheap...and they're good quality|`|bd31fda524ce298ab76d8641e4a524d3aa	Yeah, I ordered some lip gloss from e.l.f. It's just OK, nothing to write home about. And it took forever to come. The good news is it's dirt cheap so even if you hate it, you haven't lost much.|`|J6pOBbZAaa	I saw a brief spiff on one of the fashion channels, it's made by a guy that saw how much his wife was spending on cosmetics so he made his own that is more affordable.  The E.L.F. stands for Eyes, Lips, Face...  I haven't tried them yet so I don't have any reviews to share but if they're as affordable as they said on TV it's not too much of an investment to experiment.

Short if you can.  Go to the black hair care section and start reading.  Get a super conditioner or oil to use at night and put a plastic cap on it.  A warm towel over cap if you do it in day.  This is great.  Also see your quaility shampoo shop for best hair product especially for your dry and damaged hair.  And do not use the hair dryer for a while. Do not perm if you have damage.

Image consultant Nancy Penn suggests that because white reflects light and heat, wearing white would make you cooler in winter, and thus should be avoided. But others suggest the rule stems from a class issue. Acting Director of the Museum at the Fashion Institute of Technology Valerie Steele notes that in the late 19th century and the 1950s, more people were entering the middle classes.

EKuArspmaa	First off.. NO. 13 is not too young to wear Mascara. Makeup is fun and a cool way of expressing yourself and creativity. ;D.     And some really good Mascara's ARE....    Maybelline Great Lash. It doesn't clump much and it makes your lashes really stand out.     But if you want a mascara that makes your lashes FULL and LONG and very noticeable you can try     CoverGirl LashBlast.   or  Maybelline Colossal Volum' Express.  Colossal Volum' is especially good for you because it makes your lashes stand out so much, you dont need any eye liner because it makes your eyes pop enough.    And even though 13 isn't too young for Mascara or eye liner.. your mom probably would like less. Hehe. ;)    Heres a video of the commercial...  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kc8c1t3xd...

7xQIBvU0aa	you can use a black eyeliner because i have blue eyes and white skin also, the black eyeliner i use is jordana because its not very hevy.  but i would suggest brown eyeliner and either a brownish eyeshadow or a golden with a hint of black on the crease.  also you can try a very very light blue with a brown or gold on the crease which will really make the brown pop!    hope i helped anymore questions let me know!! =)|`|djhCah5Maa	I have porcelain skin too.  I look good in gray eye shadow and charcoal gray eyeliner.  You could wear blue and purple too.  I just prefer nuetrals.  Cool tones look the best.

DjircW6waa	You could try having some long layers put in to add a little texture and lift.  Part your hair on the side with a long side-swept bang.  Carmel highlights would look great. Subtle, not blocky so you don't notice the roots as it grows out.|`|bI7yzhkTaa	why don't you go on loreal.com. There you can upload your photo on the website to see which style suits your face and than print it and take it with you to the salon. One thing you must also consider is your hair texture. Your so young and pretty that you should go for something hip. Anyhting shoulder length or above would look fabulous on you. Good luck and make sure you go to a great hairstylist.

It may not say Black head tape.  You can use the one that is made especially for the nose.  Clean your face of all the oils & dirt first.  Then follow the directions.  Use Biore brand.  I do.  It works.  Its really for the nose, which sometimes may develop tiny little blackheads, etc.  I use it also on my chin.  I don't know where you wanted to use it at on your body, but its worth a try.  Found at Duane Reade, Rite Aid, etc.|`|n7N6xq2aaa	screw the tape. get the black head eraser by clean and clear omg totally is amazing works fantastic|`|c1d312af4250951e942d357ba46d734caa	It doesn't work at all :(  Save your money.|`|ZqkPBwrVaa	It doesnt work that well, clean and clear blackhead removal works though|`|PaKdsomYaa	you can get it at safeway or anywhere really but DO NOT BUY IT PLEASE SAVE YOUR MONEY IT DOESN'T EVEN GET THE BLACKHEADS OUT IT JUST PULLS OFF SKIN please please please don't buy this it hurts way to much use clean and clear blackhead eraser|`|yazZH4khaa	I have the REAL answer. www.acnefree.com   The best ever...

6YwLlYovaa	for your under-eye circles, try a using different concealer. I've  found the maybelline age re-wind concealer works well, as it lifts and brightens circles as well as covering them. If you're willing to spend a bit more try using a MAC concealer in an NW shade. both these concealers have pink undertones, so they will help to cancel out the darkness while providing good coverage.  as far as concealer not looking the same shade as your face goes make sure you set your foundation and your concealer with a powder foundation. this will make sure they look the same shade.  if you don't wear a liquid foundation then try using a primer (rimmel makes a good cheap one) to give the powder something to stick to.    now, for the blush. the best way to make your blush last longer is to use a cream blush underneath the powder one. MAC's cream colour bases work great underneath blushes, but if you're after something cheaper several drugstore brands sell cream blushes.  it's best to apply the cream blush before you set your face with the powder foundation, as cream doesn't apply so well on a powdered finish.   so you're routine should now go; primer, liquid foundation (if you wear one,) concealer, cream blush, powder blush, powder foundation.   if you still have trouble with your blush lasting try using a setting spray like MAC fix + as your next step.  hope this helps you!|`|AA12133586	one trick i learn was if you use a powder foundation, you can mix the powder with ur moisturizer to make it as a concealer.. it work I love it.. with the blush try buying a smashbox light primer it help the makeup to stay on and apply on some loose poweder after the blush|`|dKDkehWIaa	Hm....concealer always work for me for eyes so don't know what to tell you there.  But you can try a different type of blush? Either powder or cream? Try using the one you dont already use.|`|pgF6i0L4aa	I put a hot washcloth on my eyes before i go to bed and when i wake up, that works for me. Try butting a buff on and then your blush. and try not to touch it during the day. if that doesnt work, bring your blush with you in your purse and put it on when u need it.|`|bI7yzhkTaa	I use benefit makeup and they make an awesome under eye brightener. As for the blush, are you using moisturizer before you put on your blush. That makes it adhere to your skin better and last longer.  It could also be the kind of blush you use. I used to wear clinique blush but if faded really quickly. I've since switched to Bobbi Brown cosmetics blush and it lasts all day long. Another alternative if you don't want to spend that much money but still buy quality makeup is Sonia Koshuk products at Target. They work really well too.
pOsV0Tu2aa	If this is your bat mitzvah, I'm really surprised your parents are allowing you wear anything like that.    If you're going to a bat mitzvah, that dress or anything like it really is not appropriate.  Your knees should be covered(this doesn't mean leggings) as well as your shoulders.  You should dress modestly.  If you want a cute modest dress, I'd check Target(that's where I got my dress for my boyfriend's bar mitzvah).  And if your dress doesn't cover your shoulders, wear a cute cardigan over it :)|`|U0ae2atdaa	just saying that, that dress really isnt that expensive for a bat mitzvah dress. youre probably going to end up going to so many bat mitzvahs so why not wear it again or save it for a school dance or something. but i would try wet seal for a similar dress. their dresses are reasonable
pC2jGRKraa	I kinda get what you're on about, and yes the 'hook' type does lend itself to more creative design. However as long as you purchase high quality leather belts you should be alright. My Dolce&Gabbana is going strong even after a year of wearing. And I still have a wearable Pierre Cardin of the same type which is over 5 years old.|`|pjgQAXM7aa	I actually don't know what you're talking about. Are you saying just the old fashion belts? The one that everyone uses? It's like just holes on the leather belt and then you hook it, and slip it through? If you're talking about that, and if you like to make your belts tight, then sorry, no can do. The only way is to make them at a more "comfortable" level, rather than super tight.    EDIT: The seatbelt kinds?|`|DlEwI1XPaa	yea
xoXkHOVsaa	Use a marker, pen is shiny.      The most realistic effect comes from an airbrush.|`|LBHJaqXoaa	Permanent marker IS safe to use on your skin and you won't get cancer from pen ink. Its stupid people wandering around answering questions they don't know anything about that really confuses everyone.|`|10KYfxctaa	you should get it air brushed   its temporary and will eventually come off  using a pen or marker could be dangerous.the ink could bleed into your blood and you could get cancer...  the best answer would be to get it air brushed or to buy body paint and work with it to make it look as real as possibe    ????|`|99nsVz1raa	I think that pen works better. but if you use permanent marker make sure you get the fine tipped ones.

j2I0IHM9aa	Well, if you want your hair lighter and you don't want to use dye, I think you should go with some bleach. It lightens your hair. The longer you keep it in the lighter it gets, i don't know exactly like what kind of bleach but it is some kind. My friend did it to get light brown streaks in her hair. It looks good. As for style, maybe get layers to add shape? (unless you already have them) Hope this helps you :)
HuFP02Wdaa	Yeah, there is. Well, it still has chemicals but without the damage.  I've never used it, but I just came across it on this website: http://www.girl.com.au/bio_ionic_hair_st...  It costs about $500 :(  Good luck!

Stay away from the color block sacrf, as it will overwhelm the shirt, especially with the capris. I would stick with the simple necklace, and (maybe) the bracelets.

(and I love the shirt!)|`|XkWTsyJdaa	umm no, the tight shirt with tight cropped jeans dont work together. not flattering even if ur skinny. try a full length skinny jean or normal shorts. also, u cant rly wear that scarf with the shirt cuz its the same colors, but dif patterns and itll just look like ur clueless about fashion cuz u think it matches just cuz of the colors. the start necklace is cheesy. try one of the already made outfits from forever21. try...  http://www.forever21.com/looks/looks_pro...  (u could definately do different shoes)|`|Zb0deAf4aa	Yes! I love it!|`|PHcXRePhaa	im not quite loving the red scarf because it is too much red with the shirt|`|K9q4eliPaa	it is not my type of style but it's cute|`|lH6gjlQuaa	I like it but capri's aren't really my thing|`|t24aL6qVaa	Ehhh...it's alright, not top-notch, but okay...I think it's too matchy-matchy and it would look better with skinny jeans or denim shorts. I'm not a fan of those capris. The necklace is tacky, but I do like the bracelet. This is just my opinion, though, hun. Everyone has a different style... ;)|`|yOrSG49vaa	cute|`|eDP3YU5Laa	cute! but i dont really like de jeans!

AND it stays on all day long!!!    i had really bad acne over the summer from using neutrogena foundation, and it was like 2 weeks before school started and i was freaking out so i went and got bare minerals and in about a week it totally cleared up and now my skin is soooo healthy.    i love it!|`|KMnyaCwUaa	ok, i put on liquid foundation by Neutrogina then the mineral veil by bare essentials & ABS. love it. also the bare essentials makeup works great for red-ness.|`|K0SOqyAbaa	my sister uses bare minerals and it works great for her and she loves it.|`|LkWBF0Deaa	Bare Minerals work wonders my skin is so clear and it has 15 spf (sunscreen) you can buy it at Ulta or Sephora quite pricey but it's worth it.
aQF1FR79aa	They've gone up in price, but still inexpensive.    From 20-35 on average for a pair.    Sometimes they're 10-20 on sale.|`|vZnGAHUEaa	try the site i think it is www.stitches.com|`|sGRFbAMGaa	Sitches jeans are actually pretty good!  They look great and they sell them fer a low price of $25 each.  They have a lot of variety's of skinny jeans,boot cut,slim fit,and many many more!
GyKkb3ezaa	Purple shadow because purple makes brown eyes pop to great lengths.     Also golds accent brown, blue is complemtary to purple, and brown because brown is soft and warm on your eyes.     You can also try a light pink just above the eyelid and a dark brown in the crease.|`|jGqZdS2xaa	Purple and light green would look the best.    Hope this helps! |`|xbFhE5Tkaa	something smokey and shimmering  like..  http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_LzmOBE33yWc/SH...    http://www.nexternal.com/makeup/images/8...

2BjpRnL0aa	do NOT get the revlon 3d ! omg it clumps soo bad ! and you have to take off more that half of the formula because when you pull it out it has tooo much ! its really thinck also >:/ hated that mascara !    sexy curves by far is the best mascara ive used ! it gives you a lot of legthening and volume. if u take a picture of it of the side you WILL be amazed.! love it !    i have lash stilletto but havnt used it just yet.|`|PPyMhRJAaa	The best thing for that look is only to wear false eyelashes! Even in the adverts (in the corner in small print) it says 'with lash inserts. They are they only thing that look fab and all the celebs wear them. It's a bit fiddly at first, but just practice (there are loads of how to videos on youtube), and you will see the difference it makes.|`|TFYodMSGaa	None, Maybelline Lash Stylist is the best for a false las effect :)|`|GIqACtxvaa	My fave is maybelline XXL extensions.  Don'r forget to curl you lashes  first, that is the trick. Lots of Luck  :)|`|ZN5CyENLaa	I agree, maybaline (or however its spelled) lash stylist is DEFINITELY the best. You may need to comb your lashes after you put it on but it works great! I have tried lash stiletto and it doesn't do like the commercial says but I like it for an everyday look!
hQNHzc6faa	Longer bobs like this is cute. I would definitely recommande it    http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2259/1725...|`|OOz5ox6aaa	bobs look nice and require very little styling.

It's classic, cute, kinda preppy in my opinion. Im kinda a prep too haha so hope you like this :)|`|q4HofNCJaa	wear some fishnet stockings, with a mini skirt and some combat boots. for the top, wear a tunic.|`|h5Q2wsJCaa	i think that you should wear skinny jeans, and cute flats like these:    http://www.charlotterusse.com/product/in...    if its warm, wear something like this:    http://www.forever21.com/product.asp?cat...    or    http://www.forever21.com/product.asp?cat...      if its a bit cooler, wear a plain tank like this:    http://www.forever21.com/product.asp?cat...    or    http://www.forever21.com/product.asp?cat...    or    http://www.forever21.com/product.asp?cat...    under a cardigan like this:    http://shop.pacsun.com/sale/girls-sweate...    i hope this helped :)
g3WA7B8faa	That happens to me all the time.  My mom says: Train your hair.  XDD!  When your hair is wet, use pins to keep the bangs together.  When dried, it should stay still.  Do this for a few nights and it should stay like that automatically soon!  For the greasy look...use conditioner or something.  I have no idea for that one.  Good luck!|`|Fsq9qvkqaa	You should wash your hair in the morning. If you leave it over night, it will just do as it pleases and part whichever way it likes. If you have a blow-dryer with a brush attachment, it will be easier. When your bangs are still damp, pull them out in front of your face. Then, take your blow-dryer and blow dry them from underneath, pulling them out in a sort of circular motion. If you don't have a brush attachment, blow-dry your bangs to the side while brushing them in the direction you want them to go.  Try not to touch or fiddle with your bangs throughout the day. The oil from your fingers will transfer into your hair and make them look greasier. If you want, once you're done styling your bangs, spray a little hairspray on them to hold them in place.  Also, it is important to use a good shampoo. I always use Head & Shoulders, it makes my hair shiny (in a good way!) If you are using conditioner, make sure you rinse it out really well so that your hair doesn't get greasy and dandruff-y.  Hope this helped :]|`|hQNHzc6faa	Once I set my hair to the side for a long time, it's pretty much set naturally that way. Pin your hair at night to the side.|`|HwrmAgzuaa	Train your hair :)  After you wash your hair, use a bobby pin or two to keep them in place where you want...and then use a little hair spray. It'll take maybe a week (at least for me, depends on how long it takes your hair to grow) of this for it to work.
7bbfUYUOaa	Um, I don't.  Looks are the least important of all attributes I look for in a man.  Luckily my man is pretty nice to look at lol.|`|mh0QRDE9aa	This goes to show you how shallow people are.  Shallow people have big egos and they lack everything else.  Just look at the questions on this forum.  No common sense, very materialistic and no values.  The problem is beauty is only cosmetic and they will never know it since they don't take time to know the inside person.|`|OFNmZbPCaa	well, its not all about looks but they count for something. would YOU date a hideous, nerdy girl that everyone made fun of even if she was nice?!|`|C8zrNMRjaa	well dont be acting all selfish, girls have it the same way too!    and besides a guy could be wicked hot but if he has a horrible personaliy, like hes a jerk or something, i know i wouldnt want to go out with him!|`|bI7wMCJXaa	So where is the question? I don't see the part about guys doing the exact same thing, looking for girls with the smallest waists and biggest breasts.    If you're going to generalize and get nasty at people for doing what nature has designed us to do, please include both sexes.|`|rB82Ujlgaa	um guys do the same things! so there for everybody does......  : (  we are just human if we get use to someone just maybe we would talk to them like if they where sweet n funny but not creepy sweet|`|32ucqySMaa	Better luck next life..........   or get plastic surgery!|`|svSSjAsbaa	Puberty.  But I know how you feel. :}|`|0b719092b4d69772e046d90f96e26879aa	I don't base guys on looks.  Personality comes first.  Looks do play a part in who I date, but I would rather have a guy who can make me laugh and have a good time.|`|lwTk5YMEaa	I don't choose guys based on looks; in fact "good looking" guys look terrible to me if they have a bad personality.    Really, unless a guy looks downright terrible, looks don't matter much at all. But if you think you look "downright terrible", maybe try working out or changing your style of clothes a bit? I think everyone's a little superficial, whether we like it or not. =(    I'm not sure how old you are, but the older you get the smarter girls get and they start choosing brains over looks.    Good luck!|`|VKSApEJXaa	I'm sorry you haven't had much luck in the dating department but I have seen some...suprising couples. It's sad that some people (NOT JUST GIRLS!) pick based on looks. It all goes back to nomadic times when survival meant reproducing and you picked what was the most attractive (animals do it too). Luckily we live in a time where people are a less (well, somewhat) vain and look inside the person's heart and not just looks.    I'd also like to correct you. Maybe you feel this way from a guy's perspective but I'm pretty sure every girl here would say they feel more pressure to look pretty than any guys they know. You guys are born with the looks and all you do is maybe get a haircut. We have to shave, wear makeup, and everything under the sun because society tells us we're not pretty or skinny enough. So, just thought I'd clear that up...
BsifmqzPaa	primer.primer.primer.  it's whole purpose is to keep the makeup on.|`|WLZFuBVBaa	use primer.

js5KYcg4aa	Not a problem at all.|`|AA12241120	Generally tongue piercings will have the least amount of scar tissue. Though there can still be some, the area heals very quickly and very well. So if you want it redone, get it redone.<br>  <br>  It MIGHT be more painful to get it re-pierced and it MIGHT take longer to heal, everyone is different, its hard to say. All in all if you go to a reputable piercer they will know exactly what they are doing and you'll be fine and problem free. Good luck.|`|09dd5275c2367d51ecb3cfad74050309aa	i agree with meg try to put the ring back in mine didn't heal up after 2 years and i put it back in. i would stongly suggest if you need to get it repierced do it further back or more forward on your tongue rather than in the same place. because if you repierce it in the same spot it will take a lot longer to heal and will probably be more painful.|`|8dbf6f65322270770c514c9c816dcd2faa	sure go for it if you like it|`|nfGo9ZARaa	go ahead and get it redone, it doesn't hurt anymore then it did the first time getting pierced.  I did the same thing took mine out for about 3 years then repierced and a year later i added a 2nd piercing.  Both are out now for professional reasons but i would still get it repierced if i could.|`|zvYdqwSuaa	I took my ring out for about a year. Before you pay the money to re-pierce it try putting a ring in it. Try from the bottom of you're tongue it worked for me.|`|j1E3luUSaa	scar tissue hurts like hell to get re-peirced so if you have any, good luck!|`|wioTnojraa	Child I did the same thing. Just go somewhere where it is hygenic, clean, and professional. You'll be fine. And they have the little invisible balls for when you don't want people to know that you have a piercing but you can't go without it for an extended period of time.
5NsgLFPRaa	get a knife and stab a hole in it|`|SCQphK96aa	my sister is a professional piercer and highly advises you get it done professionally    i know you dont wanna hear that but she says and i quote "i've seen many people come into my shop wanting their tongue pierced due to failed attempts at trying theirselves. Sometime's i cant even pierce their tongue because they've caused damage to the nerves and the body will not be able to adapt to the piercing on its own like normal."    she tried doing it herself as well and she did fine but thats because she's a professional|`|SWKcmKQ4aa	How is telling you to get it done professionally not relevant to your question? It has something to do with you piercing your tongue doesn't it. Not saying it's a bad thing, I've pierced my lips before but yeah...|`|aDElEo4Xaa	um, you don't.   There are many nerves and if you hit one you're ******, so don't.|`|3akYIFUhaa	If you feel comfortable with the possibility of loosing all taste for the rest of your life, get a body piercing kit. Otherwise, get it done by a professional who knows where to pierce at. From what I hear if you're off by not even 1 millimeter, you loose your taste permanently.|`|4F9eAbEMaa	don't do it. If you can't get a professional then don't even bother. It is a very dangerous area to be piercing, is it really worth the risk. Think about the rest of your life and not just the near future. If it is really important to you, you willl let a proffesional do it, if it is not that important then don't do it at all.|`|JJKgzN1laa	ok i know you don't want to hear this but getting it done professionally is the Best way to go i understand that you have given yourself other piercings as have i have pierced my nose and belly button and ears myself but i would divinely go to a pro due to the veins and nerves if you hit the wrong thing due to not being able to see the whole picture you can become paralyzed or bleed to death yes i know there are mirrors and stuff but professionals have the proper Equipment to hold your Tong and they can see the whole picture on were it can and cant be pierced other than that if you want to take the risks i would do a little more Research first good luck and dint forget to mouthwash    and percing yourself may cause your toung to look like the second link do what you do good luck|`|xoXkHOVsaa	Just cough up the money and get it done right.

luQ46kJeaa	OMG that so just happened to me!!! my sister went crazy and cut my bangs but now they are nasty and ugly. there really isnt a way to make them grow faster but... i think i will think of some creative ways to wear them while they grow out.. but i will probably wear them poofed back, clipped to the side, pulled back and with some really cute headbands. i hope yours don't look as bad as mine. lol    hope this helps XoXo    ps. ill let you know if i come up with anymore!!!|`|mh0QRDE9aa	Nothing will make them grow faster.  Your hair only grows 1/2 inch per month and this is based on your genetics.|`|JwdU9nVBaa	there is really no way to make them grow faster.  but, untill they grow wear them cliped back or something.
67w7Znrwaa	If the bar is tight around your tongue, like touching it on both sides and is being pressed down on it because of this, then either your tongue is still swollen (which it shouldn't be after a week, so it could be infected; go back to the shop, get it checked, and keep it really clean with salt water rinses until then), or the bar they pierced it with is too short and you need to go get it changed for a longer one.   If its not that it could just be that its being pressed down on your tongue by the roof of your mouth. My tongue has a little dimple in it under my piercing that the ball sits in, but it shouldn't be totally flat..    I wouldn't worry about it falling through or anything before you can get back to the shop, lol, the ball is far too big to fit through the hole. If it doesn't hurt I wouldn't worry too much, but do go get your piercer to check it.|`|qQzWECQ2aa	is your tongue swollen? or maybe the piercing is rejecting. i suggest cleaning your mouth with sea salts & going to your piercer ASAP. if its painful go to your doctor. :]  good luck!|`|bM3nTH5Faa	is it swolen? thats why its stuck in your tongue?|`|W8RqiKbVaa	ummmm, well does it hurt?  if so like call a dr. and ask them.  if it doesnt DONT TOUCH IT!  that might infect it if you play with it.   if its really bothering you that bad read the directions the people at the palce where you got it done should have given to you, and see what it suggest.    hope i could help in some way

xoXkHOVsaa	Vintage is wearing clothing from past decades.  Like 50's style shoes, or 80's jackets ect...    You need to first research different eras and decide what you like.  There are stores that sell only vintage clothing.  You can also try e-bay or even goodwill.    Vintage clothing makes your style more unique.|`|VgE6HSdtaa	Vintage is when people dress like "old".  Like from the 60's & 70's and so forth.     Here's a website  http://www.unique-vintage.com/|`|KMnyaCwUaa	thrift stores. vintage shops online. & old items.|`|BDboz1eAaa	If you don't know what it is, why would you want to know how to dress it?|`|EyAAFfaMaa	Why would you want to dress vintage if you don't know what it is?    Vintage clothing is basically old things, in good condition. You can find some real steals at thrift shops and such. However, vintage shops and sites tend to be expensive, because people don't realize that clothing isn't wine and it doesn't get better with time.     Urban Outfitters has an "Urban Renewal" series, which is supposed to be like vintage clothing.     What Comes Around Goes Around is known for modern vintage, meaning it's vintage styled, but modern made.     So, I like modern vintage, because it's actually new clothing,so I don't feel stupid paying hundreds of dollars in a shop of used clothing. Gross.
OgQOVsxPaa	I am pretty and cute..people just come up to me and say "Aww, hun I could just eat you, you're gorge!"    :)|`|C0KejMfVaa	yes, were prettier than you, but not as pretty as bob.|`|GQpTI2GWaa	I've came to the conclusion that a lot of people find me attractive as they have told me so. It'd be wrong to assume that makes me good looking to everyone since aesthetics are entirely subjective.|`|b418f2cdb879b4a8266bb262f2fee70daa	No I'm not good looking.  2/10  No-one really|`|3m4YrL8qaa	I would say so kinda.  I guess I'd like to look like Adriana Lima, but personally I think I look like Megan Ewing. (long brown hair, hazel eyes, freckles from the sun)  but I get told I look like Belle from the beauty and the beast a lot haha.    I don't rate so I'm not going to rate myself. I think everyone has beauty in some form or another. Just some people are more oviously attractive|`|Tjr9aObNaa	Id rate myself 7/10 but everyone is different. I think SJP is ugly and that Scarlet Johansson is pretty but my bf differs on this opinion.|`|p3GZERIsaa	Nah i ain't pretty AT ALL!! :] I'd say like 2 or 3 outta 10 and that's being generous.. i hate the way i look and i wish i could look like angelina jolie or however you spell it! :]|`|zGHcWhtUaa	I think your personalty makes you pretty and to think that you are good looking is self confidence. But dont get this mistaken for being big headed or self pitty. Im not good looking, but i have learnt to live with what i have got. i think aslong as your nice and kind then your as pretty as can be! Also remeber there is more to life than looks. who cares if someone doesnt think your pretty whe in some ones elses eyes you will be.|`|Rvp2VBjKaa	yes i think i'm good looking,i know it sounds bigheaded but when u do your hair & make-up nice,you KNOW when u look good.  i've been told i look like megan fox & angelina jolie cos i have big eyes,big lips & long dark hair.|`|DtG4zpM2aa	I think so, from a mixture of peoples' reactions and my own assessment on looking in the mirror, since I have strong opinions on what I like and don't like aesthetically and if anything, tend to be overly critical.  My body's not perfect but okay and I think I have a pretty face...and I try and make the most of what I have going for me.   I'd love to look like Audrey Tautou - think she has an amazing face, great bone structure and is slim but not without curves - or maybe like Agyness Dean - think she looks fantastic but a bit different, and I like a slightly androgynous look both on girls or guys.|`|ymnlQsNIaa	Are you good looking?  Yeah, I think I am.     If so how do you know?   People often compliment me, my boyfriend tells me that I'm beautiful all the time, I notice people watching me. Ha, I must sound so conceited. I think beauty has a lot to do with how you view yourself though. I know a few girls that are, I swear, gorgeous girls, and they always think that they're not good enough. The way you carry yourself, your presence, will attract people if you carry yourself with confidence.    How do you rate your looks and how did you come to that?   I'd rate myself a 8.5/10. ha, I guess like what I see in the mirror.    Is there anyone famous you'd like to look like?  No, I'm happy with who I am. I look like no one else on this earth, we all have all own unique appearance.|`|WwXbso7saa	all y'all can hush okay? everyone nose i am da sexiest babie-gurl aliveeee and no one can say otha wise. serisulsly. i is sexy. leave meh alone.   ya want sum proove? http://i171.photobucket.com/albums/u294/...  dangggg i am so hot|`|p4sXZTtFaa	Yeah.  I get random people stopping me in the street telling me I should model. People I know think i'm goodlooking, etc    I couldn't care less. All I wear is t shirts (skate or band) tank tops, shorts or jeans, and converse, and I've only worn make up once or twice before. I spend 5 minutes at most getting ready, 10 min for school (coz my uniform is so confusing and button-y)    I think I look 8 or 9/10  Little thing called self esteem.    And I guess if I had to pick someone famous, Ruslana Korshunova, Yfke Sturm or Cintia Dicker.|`|UJabzQwTaa	I would never rate myself good-looking. :/ Maybe "cute", but that's where I draw the line, aha. But I don't put myself down because of it. I am who I am and I can't change that. :) I also personally don't idolize any sort of celebrity.|`|dQ21VvHUaa	letsz just say...... im confident in myself.

62T9Kozfaa	do like half of ur hair up but instead of using a hair tie use bobby pins|`|sPmeVxlpaa	Try instead of wearing it in a headband wear it completely out|`|l1VA4W6kaa	You could put short pigtails in, or braids. another cute idea:  -divide your hair in half down the middle  -start with a even lock of hair and tie it in a rubber-band  - continue to add hair and tie it until you are at the bottom  - do the same with the other side  i tried to explain it the best i could, i hope this works:D
bI7yzhkTaa	My daughter has very fine straight hair. The rollers I found worked best on her hair were the foam roller. Remember, the bigger the roller the bigger the curl. In other worrds, if you want tight curls stick with the smallest size roller.|`|m8kF5U84aa	soft ones

Then there's less of those other horrible chemicals which actually dry out your skin even more.    Look at what's actually in the product before you buy it xD|`|nXkX7BPEaa	I use lay it on think from bath and body works. I love it and my husband works outside all day and it works for him as well.|`|bI7yzhkTaa	If I were you, I would go to Sephora and speak to someone there to see what they recommend. They will give you samples. Buy the one that works best for your skin.|`|Ydi04lLDaa	I recently purchased all natural, organic body lotion from the health food store, has a different smell then the drug store brand, but works very well.|`|YvuCN6qWaa	do you over wash your face? =\  you should stop with cleansers and stuff if you use them... and try to use vaseline or something and then when it gets to the point where it's alright, i would continue the cleansers and products.    good luck!

874e9ed8d38f4753f6cca93e708cd95baa	Water based markers usually wash out, but if you color your hair already, you might want to test it in an inconspicous area first to make sure the red pigment in the marker doesn't adhere to your hair color.|`|G0ljmbAvaa	No.  If you want nice healthy hair then you really have to be careful about what you use.  Only use hair products on your hair.|`|2WciWCEQaa	Yeah. If not straight away it will fade pretty quickly after a few washes. Nothing to really worry about.|`|h6NqNzHAaa	I doubt it will all come out, how about using some ribbons?|`|6oli1iF4aa	If they're washable it shouldn't be a problem.    If you're worried then make sure you use a deep conditioning treatment before hand. This will stop any of the colour actually going into your hair.
AcxJ0veKaa	I think those shoes look like those red hot candies.

Like the silver detail on the front of the foot, and the color is pretty too.
kqboJuvvaa	Shoes need to be flat or cute boots would go great. As far as a top, it would have to be very plain, black, brown, any neutral, but plain.|`|SIW9gnazaa	wear either a pink or black or white dress. and whatever top color you decided to pick wear the same colored flats. you will look super cute!! maybe a gold necklace wouldnt look bad either!!

SSvRfxhaaa	You should file them straight across on the top and kind of filed on the sides so theyre not shart|`|f4ehvRQlaa	file them round or square.  =]|`|RhjUmfh9aa	I like how people do squareish nails that would be cute on alot of people. You should try it out
rT3MfFvuaa	Of course it does!  I am known in my circle of friends as 'the brainy one'.  Just for one night I would love to be the sexy, red hot one that I am inside but no male has yet had the intelligence to realise this.  Red hot intelligence helps you in your job but not in your love life.  Men are absolutely terrified of someone with an IQ higher than the average girl's bust size!|`|9mPSCh4jaa	Actually not really. You see if that guy doesn't think i'm cute or attractive enough to talk to, then that's his opinon.  I wouldn't get upset or annoyed. I go there to have fun not to feel annoyed.|`|7oYmZgodaa	Well that hasnt happened to me in my whole life... but i dont even care... i dont go out because i want people to see me, i have a life. Pff... and if guys didnt look at me thats better... its annoying when they look at my butt or... other parts of my body. THAT is extremely annoying.|`|QGidc6owaa	I go out to have a drink, wind down, relax, dance and have a laugh with my mates, I've never really not had some guy trying to chat me up or flirt with me. I don't go out for it, so I don't think I'd miss it or get annoyed if no one did|`|mp5Vg7Peaa	I've noticed that because I have a boyfriend and I'm not giving off that 'oh please notice me vibe' guys chat me up and pay no attention to my equally as attractive single friends.    Its nice to be smiled at but its real annoying when the older scuzzy men  start trying to dance up behind you (gag)|`|tFoSy2YRaa	Just as annoying when the only guys who are interested seem like they just crawled out of a stagnant pond somewhere...|`|gafi3P4Faa	Nope.   I go out to have  fun with my friends,  not get hit on by some guys.|`|HkyOtIeTaa	Yes!  It makes me feel unattractive, like no one even noticed me.|`|GKJEgidzaa	nah, not really. I usually just go to dance and have a fun time with my mates!|`|Sv8bZtM5aa	no because i know that i wouldnt have to go to a club to get noticed.|`|6SJ8QHKcaa	I get dressed up like that to feel better about myself!  I do it for ME ... not someone else, but if someone else wants to join in on the fun, then let them.  If they don't, then it's their loss!|`|599206d14a7e26d18e3c466bc747a349aa	no because if i put on my best dress and make up i get flirted with!!! get a life|`|D2TWz9anaa	I don't dress up to get chatted up but YES it defo does annoy me! I get paranoid that there is something wrong with me.|`|LF6Ox2k2aa	The thing about flirting is it is a two way process.  Sadly some people dont quite seem to grasp this.  I know of one extreme case of a man who when reminded of a restraining order involving him and a young woman said   "She is just playing hard to get"  Try to think of it this way.  The better the girl looks, the less chance she is doing it just for you.
I6zQeNGzaa	Get razored layers, It looks like you just got blunt ones.  Getting them razored really makes the difference because it makes the ends thinner. Also, make use of  straightening iron to get straight hair  then use a styling wax on the ends of the layers to seperate them.   http://www.emo365.com/uploaded_images/ho...  To make the hair stand up in the back, tease it and apply strong hold gel or paste then you might to use some hairspray for extra hold.  http://img221.imageshack.us/img221/799/1...|`|Hzzdalavaa	Go to the barbers and ask for it to be cut into a mans cut.|`|Rvp2VBjKaa	chop the ****** off,it's like an overgrown bush.  u look like edward scissorhands|`|wpZA7vJtaa	hahahhhahahhahahhaahahaahhaahahhahahaahh...  thats the funnniest picture, or thing ive seen all day!  hahahahahahahahahhahaa  i burst out laughing.  sorry thats lame, but it a hilarious picture mateee|`|eea2pK2Laa	ask the hairdresser
Je26LwSqaa	it just depends on your skin and if you tan in the sun or tanning beds. you should try those instant tanners along with tanning in the sun so you don't get too much exposure to the sun.|`|W9GTkt3Jaa	not long. for me, im filipino and if i stay out at the beach for a day, i can get pretty tan. xD|`|22621f93a7534ed2f1a71acf45cf11a4aa	well it depends on ur skin type and how long it takes ur skin to absorb the color in...the time it take to get a tan varies between different people.|`|YvuCN6qWaa	depends on your skin tone now, and how many rays your catching.. it's not the same for everyone.    be careful though.. might wana use a lot of sunscreen if you're gona tan for days!
WSziasfMaa	Yep, its the same kind of motion sickness that can occur in a car or on a boat.  There are anti-nausea meds you can get, like Prochlorperazine, to help prevent this type of thing.|`|gZn622dEaa	Yeah.|`|AA12133586	yes since there not that much oxygen up there|`|A57LMS5Qaa	yeah. i dont though. and i get EXTREME motion sickness.
6YwLlYovaa	try using shades of green, lilac (or purple if you're game,) beige, pale pink, and gold. these colours will help to enhance your eye colours and make your eye really 'pop'
ht4Pb8OPaa	usually the same quality as any other one  the hole concept is useless any way. "put this on and you'll smell like a fish"  "oh...ok..."  it just makes you smell
SYpVGGJTaa	Tampons/pads. I ALWAYS have these in my purse. Even when you don't need them chances are someone will be in a pickle and need supplies unexpectedly and you will be her hero !|`|dYN3bdnKaa	Gosh, I have everything in my purse!

Good luck! (:  Decide what kind of purse you need and buy it. Many smaller pockets will make things easier to find and help control the jumble and mess.   Consider what you need to carry in your purse every day. What items do you use (or find you need) frequently? Make a list of the items.   Consider where you are taking the purse. If it's to go to school or work, stick to everyday items like money, a mirror, breath mints, cell phone, hairbrush, makeup, deodorant etc. If it's to go out, you may want to vary the contents with more makeup.   Evaluate how much makeup you use each day. If you wear makeup every day or go out a lot, you may want to put a makeup bag in your purse. Tissues and a hairbrush are always useful even if you don't wear cosmetics.   If you take medication every day, you may want to put that in your purse as well. If you are prone to headaches or cramps, you may want to keep a small container of pain reliever in your purse.   Gather or purchase the items you want to keep in your purse.   Be sure to include a wallet containing money and an ID. In addition, make sure the purse contains keys for your house and car.   Put everything inside your purse.         [edit] TipsInevitably, you will have too many items to fit neatly in your purse, so you will have to take everything out and select something that you can live without.   Clean your purse regularly. Throw out any old receipts and trash. Evaluate everything you carry and make sure it is serving its purpose. If it doesn't earn its keep, don't lug it around.   Make a point to use up your change, otherwise it will all sink to the bottom of your purse weighing you down.   Alternate the cosmetics in your makeup bag. Otherwise, you'll end up toting around ten different kinds of lip gloss.   Keep zippered bags inside your purse to keep smaller items together.   Other items you can include are: mace, a swiss army knife (or Miss A Kit), a book (if your purse is large enough), an mp3 player, a mirror, tweezers, a business card holder, a notebook, a pen, a small flashlight, pads or tampons, hand lotion, a transit pass, an address book, a planner or calendar, a PDA.   For special events, you may want to keep nail polish in your purse to patch up runs in your pantyhose. Or, you could scrunch up a pair of tights or stockings into a ball and keep them in your purse in case of emergency (for example: you have holes in your stockings at an important business meeting).   If you are traveling, it may be a good idea to keep a hand sanitizer like Purell in your purse.   If you are keeping electronic items in your purse, you may want to get protective cases for them. It's also a good idea to "lock" mp3 players and cell phones, so you don't waste power or end up calling your best friends by accident.   If you are "on" or maybe a unexpected mentruation should hit you (especcially if you are a teen and they are not regular) always keep a few pads/tampons in your purse, but be sure to put them in your purse pocket so if you ask someone to hand you somthing out of your purse they don't see it/them.   ^^ thats from the website.|`|WLZFuBVBaa	wallet, make-up, keys, pen|`|4UQegWk0aa	Why would you buy a purse and then need things to put in it?

Oh yes and some gum or mints.|`|aIiGOudwaa	Ok a girl must always have some lip gloss, or lipstick.  And tissue papers are also handy.  How about a nail file, some tic-tacs, gum, or candy? And a little mirror if you want to check your hair or anything.  Also, carry a few bobby pins, some tylenol (in case you get sick), a safety pin (in case you need to fix something), and some hand lotion.  Have fun!|`|4uKbpwVtaa	well you shouldn't bring a purse around in school anyways because first of all you're young and you don't need it and it could get stolen but w/e here are some things that are always in my coach bag:  - lip gloss  - mini body spray  - mascara and eyeliner  - mp3  - cell phone  - coach wallet  - hand lotion   - pack of tissues (how would you feel if there weren't any tissues around and you had to wipe snot on your sleeve disgusting!) lol  - gum  - keys  - credit card   - tampons     yup i think that's it|`|LId3qnI1aa	I don't know what 'should' be in a girl's purse,  but in my bag i have my phone, foundation, eyeliner, hair ties,  deodorant, money, hand sanitizer, hairbrush, mints, mini torch and four lighters.

RkimYgEtaa	I am not a black female but I have used and am currently using Pantene, it makes my hair look shiny and soft but I have heard from several users on here that all it does it coat your hair in wax making your hair look healthy but actually damaging it in the long run. I am waiting to see for myself. I suggest using John Freida's line of hair products or Redken, I've heard they are a bit pricey but have seen and heard lots of great results from those. If not ; I suggest buying a natural shampoo and conditioner like one with shea butter and vitamins to improve the overall health of your hair.    If you have any questions about this or anything, contact me at;  curleynicole@ymail.com    Much love.|`|7euKjvG9aa	I'd say ApHogee... but depending on the Pantene line... I hated Pantene it was too drying I switched to better shampoos with no sulfates cause I'm a hair care junkie (I'm growing it out to waist length so I can't afford to use crappy products)  maybe you'd benefit from looking at this site  http://www.komazacare.com/aboutus.html|`|48f8983f73f30668fc628cc4100d78dfaa	aphogee strengthens hair if it is breaking or if you just want it stronger...pantene isn't as conditioning as aphogee.. but it is more of a moisturizing shampoo.. Since you are black   pantene may work better|`|KoXkotGxaa	i think you shoul really be using garnie or head and sholders but panteene works just as good

Dejar de jalarme excesivamente las pensta?as cuando me las enchino con la cuchara (trata de hacerlo muy suavemente)<br>  <br>  2do. Usar un fimel que se llama "Splash", que tiene colageno, Vitamina A, Cera de abeja y queratina, si vives en Mexico, lo encuentras en cualquier tienda de articulos de belleza, es muy comun, aunque es barato sale muy bueno.<br>  <br>  3.- Desmaquillate tus ojos y pesta?as siempre con un producto de calidad, no uses crema, usa un desmaquillador para ojos de marcas como L'oreal, Pond's, Marycay, etc.<br>  <br>  4.- Cuando te las enchines, trata de que queden paradas, no honduladas porque si tu las hondulas el efecto visual es de pesta?a corta, apoya la cuchara o el enchinador en donde nace la pesta?a y aprietalo ligeramente fuerte para que queden paradas, espero haberme explicado, si no escribeme y te mando un diagrama:  celeste.amber@yahoo.com.mx<br>  <br>  5.- Usa siempre delineador en la base del parpado movil, de preferencia ***** y delinea desde el centro del ojo hasta las comisuras del ojo y dibuja una rallita que sobre salga para que de el efecto de pesta?a larga.<br>  <br>  6.- Por ultimo (y mi tip favorito) cuando apliques el rimel aplicalo desde la y hacia arriba, y luego con tu mano izquierda jala tu parpado movil hacia arriba y con el cepillo del rimel aplica mas rimel por debajo de la base de las pesta?as, ten cuidado, no estoy diciendo en el globo del ojo. este efecto sirve mucho y te da un efecto de pesta?as largas.<br>  <br>  Espero te sirva.|`|2JCQ5mseaa	Hola!!

When they fall out a little bit they look natural and really cute.  I do this to my hair almost everyday; my hair is about the same length as yours. With spiral curls it doesn't become as short.

zMqPSxypaa	same here its good u stopped straightening your hair. it gives u a lot of spilt ends. well only thing u can do is eat healthy drink a lot of milk to make ur hair stronger. when u hair is wet brush it then dont wait until it dry cuz when brushing tangled hair can damage it.  trim the ends itll make it grow a little faster b/c when u have spilt ends it slows down the growth of your hair.|`|YwHl37Hgaa	Rub olive oil into the scalp and massage to promote hair growth , leave for 1 hour and wash.

Or you should wash it 3 times a day. YOu should also striten your hair. I have my hair long enough for my prom, because of that.lol|`|Wkxifzsxaa	This is what i've tried and it works....  It's greesy but only use little of it and rub onto your scalp with fingertips....It is called Doo Gro and they sell it @ Sally's and even at Wal-Mart by the hair styling section.      You also want to try brushing your hair from back to front with head down. This helps me too.|`|jkoUoWOBaa	I'm not actually sure (besides everything that was already mentioned), but DO NOT BRUSH WET HAIR!! when your hair is wet it is much more delicate and WILL make it fall out!!

0Yqjaj15aa	i have bangs too and this is what i do.  youll need herbal essence scrunching gel its in a purple bottle or you can use the mousse, and panetene always smooth anti-frizz serum and a hair tye.    take a shower at night!do not brush your hair after you get out of the shower do that before you get in.  Now dry your hair off alittle like your scrunching it with a towel.  Take the anti-friz serum about a dime full and rub it into your hair gently(not too much or your hair will get greasy)  Then take the gel/mousse and put it in your hand, now rub your hands together.  After dip your head over and scrunch your hair.after you scrunch put your hair in a loose bun for 15-20 mins.  RIght before you go to bed take it out and sleep on your damp hair.  I hope this works for you i have wavy hair but my friends do it and it works perfectly on them too!=D
EbGBhTw1aa	Keep your nails trimmed and filed. Taking care of your nails can help reduce your nail-biting habit and encourage you to keep your nails attractive.     Have a manicure regularly or use nail polish. Men can use a clear polish. Wearing artificial nails may stop you from biting your nails and protect them as they grow out.     Try stress-management techniques if you bite your nails because you are anxious or stressed.     Paint a bitter-tasting polish, such as CONTROL-IT or Thum, on your nails. The awful taste will remind you to stop every time you start to bite your nails.     Try substituting another activity, such as drawing or writing or squeezing a stress ball or Silly Putty, when you find yourself biting your nails. If you keep a record of nail-biting, you will become more aware of the times when you bite your nails and be able to stop the habit.     Wear gloves, adhesive bandages, or colored stickers whenever possible to remind you not to bite your nails.     Snap a rubber band on the inside of your wrist when you start to bite your nails so you have a negative physical response to nail-biting.|`|LwW1wacHaa	Usually people bite their nails because they are bored so always keep yourself occupied. Or my friend said her boyfriend said chewing her nails is gross and she immediately stopped.|`|BJyXx5hKaa	http://letmegooglethatforyou.com/?q=How+...|`|vITZgKthaa	try to think something  like ewww and yeah then you will be like wtf ima doing? lol    try :]

If you do get the clip ins be very very careful as over a period of time where the clip has been can leave you bald!! believe me I have seen some pretty nasty scalps all through clip in hair extent ions..So keep an eye on the area if you can where the clips are if you see the hair thinning around that area dont do it no more..|`|75QDk3iNaa	yes the clip ones are great i used the glue and it naffed my hair up it gets greacy and stuff the clip ones are really good you can put them where you want and its really good trust me hunny  goodluck xx

Cute picture!  Maybe next time, if you are looking for something different, you could try asking a stylist what shade would go well with your skin tone, i think brunette because you seem fair from the picture, but not like extreme. Maybe you could do side bangs, or a deep layer cut, which would look nice, or lighten the colour a little, and then go lighter in colour with your eyeliner, and shadow to a chocolate brown, to s reg/soft brown, which will compliment your skin tone, and hair colour, and not look so dramatic when you don't need it.    honeychild.

C0HZ8ZB4aa	I've never heard of an unpiercable nose - they get people in all shapes and sizes, so I'm sure you'll be fine!    The needle will still go through at the same speed, if your nose is thicker then it might add a fraction of a millisecond to the amount of time it takes to push through, but nothing I would imagine that would make any real difference to the pain you feel. I've had my nose pierced twice (healed first time) and I didn't bleed either time, I don't think many people do, and if you do it won't be serious, just a dabbable amount!    Good luck and enjoy! Nose piercings are one of the less painful by far in my opinion. I complain a lot about pain, but I didn't think that one was too bad, not much worse than ears, it just makes your eye water a lot!!|`|bZgfiVrJaa	It would hurt because you're putting a wound in your flesh. Since your nose is thicker (thicker flesh) it would hurt more (honestly) but it's just a 5 second pain. Just make sure you take care of it during the healing time! Good luck!|`|pGF6Xdghaa	ooohh.. yeah that would hurt.. even though the bone is made from cartilage and tissue, it still would hurt because of the tiny bones on the sides of your nose..    Just try a fake one.. they sell them on ebay and they look so real.. that way it won't hurt.. but if you do decide you want one, then that's okay.. it could hurt though, and maybe bleed, depending on where it is at..  Good luck and God bless you!!|`|LBHJaqXoaa	Congratulations on your upcoming piercing! I doubt your nose is too thick to pierce. I have seen several people with thicker noses have their noses pierced just fine. My own mother has a thick nose and when she pierced it she said it didn't really hurt. My nose is thin and mine didn't really hurt. So my guess is that it won't hurt more because it's thick. And most nose piercings don't bleed, so don't worry about that part.    Hope this helps!
GIqACtxvaa	If you want subtle you should stay away from green, even its light.  The best shade for blue eyes is brown. It makes blue eyes POP!   There are so many options for brown that are super natural and great for your age.  When I say brown I'm thinking like a really light shimmery color . Not like tree brown.    For powder maybe you should try a loose powder and apply it with a big round brush.   I never use the brushes that come with make-up.   It would allow you to apply the powder really lightly and appear more natural.    And for the mascara, its possible that you are not applying it correctly.   Maybe you could go to you tube and see a mascara  application video.  Possibly your mascara is old and going on too thick.  You are supposed to change your mascara every 1-3mo.    Lots of Luck!  And keep on trying, you ll get it! :)|`|KMnyaCwUaa	ok,     liquid foundation make SURE that it's oil-free. i suggest something by Neutrogina. also over your foundation i suggest to put "mineral veil" from bare essentials on. there foundation is powder & amazing also however i prefer liquid.    for mascara i say CoverGirl Lash Blast in the orange tube & only put on one coat.     if your young don't wear eyeliner yet because it's very dramatic.     & personally i hate eyeshadow but go with something neutral because bright/random colors looks really bad. [[please don't match your eyeshadow to your shirt, highlight your features.]]    hope i helped.|`|xbFhE5Tkaa	BLACK would be too much  GREEN would look fine  PINK would look cute  PURPLE would look elegant  WHITE would look cheesy  BLUE would match your eyes too much unless you get a dark one  RED would look romantic  BROWN would look the best :]|`|CL18wBxjaa	that green would look awesome! but what i do is i always put some black just above my top eyelashes and then put whatever color(s) i want over it. It gives it a faded look. :)    maybe for blonde hair try tan/pink/silver/brown colors.    also my favorite mascara is covergirl lashblast. :) it doesnt clump.    and i can't go anywhere without eyeliner!|`|SCTMtrjhaa	If you want it to look natural wear the following:    Foundation  Powder  Blush  Clear mascar  and browns for eyeshadow  lipgloss (optional)    This look very natural, but make you look more beautiful!!|`|iiItR2eOaa	Hun, go to MAC and talk to the makeup artists there , they REALLLLY help you with colours, etc. plus their products are really good!! :)

TyFoi2ONaa	Buy some of the lengthening mascara. Also take a dark brown eyeshadow and and take a flat brush and rub the eyeshadow into the lash line. It gives a fuller look.

(the middle one)|`|ply8AJrcaa	fake eye lashes.|`|z8AlY7Vmaa	Tip:dont wear black eyeshadow that makes your eyes look smaller.  Try brown eyeshadow,And eyeliner.  And you could buy fake eyelashes and that would make them look altra bigger (: and if you put eyeliner on your upper lid that makes your eyelashes look a tad bit thicker.|`|gdrdkSRLaa	beats me...    hahah well if you aply olive oil to your lashes  it softes and strenghens them and also makes them  appear fuller(:     yyyyyyyuuuuuuuuuuuuuhhhhhhhhhhh|`|x7sfh3saaa	Try putting some powder, like powder foundation before you apply your mascara. This will make them look thicker. : )  For your eyes, don't use black eyeliner, and if you use it just do it on one side (up or down). If you use white eyeliner on the bottom inner part of your eye it will make it look bigger because it elongates the white part of your eye.    (for your eyelashes: there is this one product that just came out called Latisse, its a prescribed product that its meant to elongate your lashes naturally, you can check their site, (it is pricey though))|`|tzfKhULYaa	You should definitely try wearing false eyelashes-- I've been doing it for a year, and they make your eyes look absolutely stunning!    Here's the kind I buy:  http://www.cvs.com/CVSApp/catalog/shop_p...  They're size 33, and the size is the same for most brands. I buy mine at CVS, but you can get them almost anywhere.    They make your lashes look super-thick, and they also give them a ton of length. (However, if you want your lashes to look a little more natural, they make thinner, whispier ones that you can buy instead.) It may seem like an expensive makeup habit, but it's really not if you know how to take care of your lashes. As long as you're careful when you apply them and take them off, they should last for several months.    If you decide to start using false eyelashes, they may feel a little uncomfortable at first. But don't worry! Once you begin wearing them consistently, you'll get the hang of applying them correctly in no time. Just make sure that you don't use too much adhesive-- when you glob on the glue, it'll make a huge mess. You only need a teeeeny bit to make your lashes stick.    Hope this helps! :DD|`|AA11695522	You should buy Lashblast by covergirl.  It lifts and extends your lashes pretty well.  I believe Revlon also sells lash curlers they cost about 8 bucks.....use it after you apply your mascera for best results!  ;-)
ply8AJrcaa	pretty , if you know how to use it|`|wDnP5b0Oaa	it all depends on how you naturally look and how you use the makeup and how much you use|`|VR3soAktaa	it can go either way.  if you know how to use it, and how much to use. you probably look prettier.     but if you're just gonna glob some on then it probably wont look so good|`|gXBPLitzaa	Depends   If put on properly & used in small amounts pretty.

Skinny jeans are your type(and my type, I have skinny legs) of jeans. Dark blue or black. I wouldn't wear purple, hot pink, or red too often, though, because of your green eyes. BTW: I've always wanted to see green eyes in person! Do you think you could add a picture? Ha. Oh, also, don't wear brown or orange( also orange, more like peach, is my fave color). And yellow.|`|JOR9dSSuaa	it would help if i had a picture.... but i personally stay away from yellow, and i somewhat match your descirption... just 6 inches taller than u...|`|bbFUKYcEaa	DONT wear- brown, dark blue, hot pink, orange  Do wear- cream (Omg if you curl your hair this would be so pretty with green heels!!!) and an emerald green|`|AClmBnM3aa	you should wear red, but you can prob just wear any, thats what i do|`|j2I0IHM9aa	I kind of match your description.

Boots (not high heels, not disgusting huge leather boots either, nice suede black/brown boots look nice, some tall people can pull off Uggs, not sure about you though.).  Button down shirts, first few buttons open (not so you look like a whore though..)  I have a friend, she's 6'1'' haha.|`|grG9hxmeaa	I'm six feet tall and I shop at urban outfitters.

Look at celebrities that are tall, such as Mischa Barton, or Paris Hilton. And take some ideas.    P.s: the website is slow.  P.p.s: Start from the 'last page' of whoever you're looking at because some threads started like 3 years ago and some of the pictures  from backthen aren't even there anymore..  P.p.p.s: You can't join.    But overall - it's a good site! Go!|`|6WbJKTJAaa	First of all, I always think that pencil skirts with a nice sweater look very classy and sexy on tall girls. Don't wear heels, wear flats. Skinny jeans would look nice as well.    Also, I would like to say that I am very offended by you using the word "fat". You should say overweight or obese. Sometimes it's not people's fault, and they're born big boned. I know what this is like. People struggle with weight their whole lives, and they can't help it. Then people like you have to throw the word "fat" around so casuallyand make them feel worse. It's hard to resist a pie sitting on the table... Sometimes you just have to eat it. It's hard to not eat when in your dreams there are cakes dancing around your head. Try to be a little more considerate.|`|Q8wDjvZ1aa	I am the same height, and have been since i was 12.   when i buy clothes i often opt for the longer shirt styles because they fit best on me.  i also would wear a lot of mid calf capris shorts as i found they didn't look like short pants but obviously aren't shorts either.    try stores like tall girl. i know they are older in style, but sometimes you can luck out with some really cute pieces from there.|`|PrAFdWw6aa	I am truly offended that you said " I'm not fat"   I am a larger person, and know that its tough to lose weight .      your a inconsiderate self centered brat.  think about ohter peoples feelings for once!|`|J9C90TIbaa	aeropostale

lH6gjlQuaa	I think knee high boots cut off the line of your leg causing them to look shorter. If you want them to look longer I would go with something with a heel and lower cut|`|AA12133586	it make ur leg look longer get a black pair that would go vwit everything|`|6X6rK7BFaa	It depends on what else you're wearing whether they make them look longer or not, but they definitely make thick thighs look a lot thinner. (try saying that five times fast!) Just make sure they aren't tight!  If you pair them with dark tights, or a long skirt or long pants, they'll make your legs look a lot shorter than they are. If you pair it with bright tights, and say a short-ish skirt or shorts, it will make your legs look a looot longer.|`|DL7GY6hYaa	i saw this short fat girl wearing knee high boots and they sooooooooo dod not look good at all. maybe if u wore them with short shorts but dont wear them with a skirt. it makes u look ridiculous.

uVhE16v1aa	Well Proactive didn't work at all for me but I think your supposed to clean your face before applying that so the answer is..no.

The greatest deal of damage from hair color is the fumes. The only thing you have to worry about is being in a well ventilated area. And try to avoid doing hair color during the first 3 months as this is when most of the baby's developing takes place. Just follow these tips and you should be A ok to color your hair while pregnant.|`|0pHBnkaNaa	You can't use the harsh chemicals that are in the dyes, like peroxide. You can use loreal jazzing but that's about it. That's a temporary color with no chemicals, it washes off in about a week though. That's really the only temporary hair color you can use too because other ones still have chemicals in them that make the color adhere to you. Jazzing is just color deposit and you can get it at a beauty supply.
A34HXSXtaa	A nice and subtle place to die your hair is one part off from your normal part. For example, part your hair how you will normally wear it, run a comb through horizontally so the part is more on the side. then take a front section or just behind the front section and dye that the "funky" color you want.    To make a lighter color stick, you will need to leave the dye on for a bit, depending on how dark your hair is. Also, if you are planning on dying a certain color, then lighten the place first and then dye blue or purple or red or whatever color.    Some other general tips:  --Don't wash hair for 24 hours before dying  --After, be sure to run hair through luke-cold water until no more dye comes out. Otherwise, the color will bleed onto everything -- clothes, sheets, etc.|`|RkimYgEtaa	No tips from me, I'm no professional but I suggest going to a salon and asking them to suggest something for you.    If you have any questions about this or anything, contact me at;  curleynicole@ymail.com    Much love.
voGSTX1Saa	When you go from a really light color to a dark color you need to take the color in steps... Say you have bleach blonde hair level 10 andyou are trying to get to a level 5 brown-    you need to color it at a level 7 first. This is called a fill.  Its replacing all the missing colors your hair needs to replenish the color from when you bleached the color out.     Id go to your nearest salon to have it fixed as soon as you can.  Usually just trying to fix it yourself just makes it worse, but ifyou insist on coloring it yourself again, I would use the same color you used again but Im not making any promises. If you are worried about damage use a Demi permaninent hair color....Good luck.|`|Kq2rFuIyaa	if your hair is green that means that it has too much chlorine in it.. conditioner is very important. but before you dye it you need to go to a salon because its very possible that more dye will just make it worse. or use an all natural dye with no harsh chemicals and a low chlorine count|`|A34HXSXtaa	A darker brown should do the trick. Don't go black.|`|8LRxz8tVaa	Brown should cover it, and it won't damage your hair. Six weeks is lots of time, especially if your hair is already in good shape now.
AA12097239	It depends on the shape of your face: for long, narrow faces I prefer curly hair because it creates an impression of "fullness". On the opposite, I like straight hair for people who have a round face, it elongates their face. Wavy hair is easy to wear and very nice on everybody, that's my favorite way, it's very manageable too.  Of course, all that depends on the length of the hair. I'm talking about medium length hair (shoulders).   As for the hair itself, it's shinier when it's straightened.|`|jPJaSIXPaa	all haha|`|4k5MkmInaa	i love curly and bouncy hair that are full of volume because i have hair thats straight and flat!|`|neiXxJ4Paa	all|`|HOl6N45iaa	I think they all look good.|`|AA10956801	go curly!!!!|`|S55mhoSgaa	after watching malcom in the middle, i hate curly hair.|`|ZqkPBwrVaa	curly|`|tJ9zAY9gaa	i like all of them, especially wavy long hairrr... it looks really pretty especially on a brunette:)|`|cMecXnVraa	love curly hair and love straight hair  so i think wavy!!|`|atAwNvDfaa	Curly is more fun to look at  while straight hair is kind of boring, but it is easy to live with. wavy is just weird to me

Nah.....don't feel like lookin for that stuff.      Stay Cool|`|DvKpx0Reaa	your hair is covering your face and im too lazy to answer the other questions|`|vB8MT41Baa	17

OpdHN6Ivaa	I wouldn't use gel because it dries really hard and it's really unhealthy for your hair. Even though you have short hair straightening it will really help. I would use heat protection spray if you want to try that.    Or you can wash your hair in a shampoo or conditioner that makes your hair straight. I would get out of the shower put in some mouse and blow dry it with a brush make sure you pull so it would in a way "stretch" your hair and make it straight.|`|r1xJIPDeaa	well gel it after you shower but if you think it will look to glossy use hair spray that should help a bit...but if all else fails get a perm!!! jk...unless you want to...remember though whe your using the hair spray you have to comb it while your spraying it cuz it won't just straighten on its own lol. hope i helped
CtHi5L78aa	you need a toner.. or you could go to sallys and get a shampp called brillant lights its a toner shampoo that takes the yellow and ash color out you leave it on for about 5 mins then rinse.

SaxjkMbSaa	Blonde Hair & Blue Eyes was very popular even before the 1950's dating back to the 1900's with Iillian Russell & in the 1930's with Shirley Temple.  In the 1950's Marilyn Monroe + Bridgette Bardot + James Dean + Troy  Donohue exemplified the Blonde Hair & Blue Eyes look.  Dating back to the 1920's many Black entertainers like Cab Calloway & later in the 1950's  entertainers like Little Richard , Muddy Waters & James Brown used to straighten their hair ( using lye + egg white ) into a " pompadour " style known as a " process " or " conk/ conkaline "  Even Malcom X had a " conk " when he was a young inmate in jail.|`|dd2d386096f95b4c9c13d046234f4dddaa	Blonde hair and blue eyes for women came from Barbie.

It's up to you if you want to give someone a chance. Females of all people are pretty good at liking someone for who they are, they don't seem as superficial as most guys. So if you spend a little time around certain guys, you might find out they're better than you initially thought.|`|nrnVqh7iaa	do you have boobs?  I would never date a girl that didn't have long hair and boobs....     the personality would come out over timel.. but the hair and boobs got me interested.|`|l1zvTRVAaa	haha, i hear ya. my view, its the guys. they're intimidated by you :) even tho you bf less, intimidating guys is quite the accomplishment :D :P|`|q7I1Ek3kaa	Tell us, how are old are you ? because if your 19 or something i would say ....dont worry about it u have plenty of time for looking|`|DySUxIn4aa	Maybe you're afraid of being committed to one person. That's how I am (I think). Lot's of guys try going out or being my boyfriend, but I get bored too quick!|`|KuyTWJPZaa	Just hang in there! How old are you? You might be too young. You'll find a great guy soon!|`|CSrwFxF2aa	Clearly, there is nothing wrong with you if you are getting asked out a lot. Maybe you should just stop looking so hard! Lower your expectations, maybe you just need to give the boys around you a chance. Don't write them off just because you don't feel a connection, sometimes that doesn't happen right away. You most likely just don't know what or who you want yet, so you need to give boys a chance so you can figure out what type of guy you want, and what type of guy you don't.|`|GybjVZxtaa	I think I miiiight be able to help. But hear me out first.    My friend is much less pretty than me, but somehow she has a thousand more friends and guys all over her left and right. I've had one guy actually like me and one just want me for sex. I didn't understand it for a while, but then I realized the one big difference between us. I only let people into my life if they ask entrance (so to speak), while she drags people in and practically radiates confidence and life. I decided to try to be more open and confident, or at least try, and it's working so far.    Could you maybe need to be more... you? Accept people into your life more and maybe show more confidence? If you think about it, if there was a guy and he was shy, I think I'd be less likely to like him than if he came up and said hi to me.    Hope I helped some...|`|QQdOpG2xaa	i've never ever had a boyfriend before, i've kissed a guy once,  and I'm 15, soo yeah, don't think you have a problem,,  cause I'm pretty sure I'm fine,|`|YvvcsdUUaa	it could be someone or something that affected you in the past and is just totally a blockage to new things. and you may not even notice it but you could simply not be approachable anymore..you wont feel it. you wont see it. if anything you'll try to look good and look pretty..but just the way you give yourself out to people..doesnt attract them..and im pretty sure that its because of a past pain..or just something that broke you down so bad..that you dont know how to get up..and your standing and looking fine physically but mentally you feel like you might be getting nowhere..|`|wwSz1ht5aa	let's see a picture, then ill edit and tell you if your ugly or not |`|fcIzDGnBaa	If you get asked out a lot, I highly doubt it's your looks or personality.

pOx6vwMwaa	it dosnt i used to use biosilk silk therapy  and my hair is still curly as heck even though i straightened it while using biosilk just make sure you dont use to much or your hair gets REALLY greasy|`|aUlEgtRBaa	..ok biosilk..doesn't straighten your hair.. it holds it straight for a longer period of time after you straighten your hair. plus, it just keeps the frizz under control. so  ya u can keep you natural wave just don't use a straighten on your hair.
xOjCypnAaa	i personally think her hair looks better up or maybe it's just the different pose in the photos. Idk. However, she looks nice either way. She can change it from day to day to keep things fresh. when her hair's down it's kinda girly and cute and when it's up, it's kinda rocker and stuff... don't know if that helps.|`|1bHaB8xvaa	I liek it up, down is a bit too overdone.|`|7N0hbw6Taa	down, i dont really like it up as much...nice phone!|`|bRWirMT2aa	I like it up.

hlh15a3Maa	medium foundation, light pink or purple eyeshadow, black mascara,and eyeliner...you look pretty without makeup....natural is all ways the best....you don;t want to put allpowders on ur face,,that makes it look like a cake.....|`|5e9013e4acd951c6275d5a2e7e92b516aa	I think like a coral or pink shades would look pretty on your skin tone.

U1R87Ec0aa	Get it done professionally.  There are many things that can go wrong if you do it yourself.  And if you mess it up you will have to get it fixed professionally.  So, you should just spend the money once and get it done right.  I have tried highlighting my own hair before and it did not turn out the way I wanted it to.    I like the bold colors underneath: pink, purple, and teal are great.|`|ijyish4Baa	black would look best and have it professionally done|`|DQeUKMbPaa	um no black because you'll have to wait for it to grow out if you decide you don't want it. pink is easy and you can bleach it out if you don't want it after a while.  go to sally's beauty supplies and there stuff you don't have to mix, but if you do, they person there will help you out. you'll send a whole lot less. for the dye with all you need, you'll spend at most 20 bucks|`|Ym9bRgcDaa	I know a blonde with scene hair who dyed her underside this awesome reddish pink from Hot Topic. It turned out awesome! I watched her put it in and helped her- it was really easy! If you use this kind, you can definitely do it yourself!    It says red on the bottle and looks red, but it's more pinkish.  Good luck!|`|gRZT4pnUaa	professional if you want only part dyed. I like the black underneath.

Take my advice NEON COLORS! If you use five different neon colored nail polishes you are so cool! Don't make it rainbowed! Trust me! Pink, purple, blue, yellow and green!     OR, you can go to the dollar store or anywhere and get fake french nails...with glitter!     Tip...go to the dollar store! I would recommend Dollar General because they have the best cheap nails!     These colors are cool too! http://www.wnwbeauty.com/cosmetics/nail/...      Tan...IDK...YOU DON'T NEED A TAN! Just use a liquid conceiler for makeup!

Hair...I would reccommend this site...  http://beauty.tips.net/Pages/T0084_Top_T...    I would reccommend Taylor Swifts hair...for a blond teenage girl!     Toenails...like I said at the top! Just follow what I said.     Purfume...    I personally like....these  http://www.sephora.com/browse/section.jh...    I like the Vera Wang Princess!    Lotions....Go to Bath and body...pick out your fave! I have not preferance!    Lip Gloss....Ummmmmm.....well it's not so much the gloss as it is glitter! I would go to Claires and get a pink or purple glitter gloss!    Make up...Well...not cheap. When you spend $ on make up don't get it from a dollar store, you will end up lookin like a $20 hoe! Don't make that mistake!     Ok, for all of these I would go to Claires but it's up to you!    Ok...additional details to a great makeover...and a pretty one at that!    Jeans...skinny!

hzhi0jPAaa	Not long. Whenever I pluck my eyebrows, stray hairs appear like the next day. But growing them out might look a little weird because they won't be shaped properly and you'll have random stray hair.   Once I plucked my eyebrows too thin, I don't remember how long it took to grow back, but not long. Just be patient.|`|Jh235bFtaa	Girl, I know exactly what you're going through!! I used to pluck my eyebrows waaay too thin. But now I let them grow back in and they look way better. Well, unfortunately, it's going to take a while, a couple months if not longer :/ However, i bought this stuff called "Mavala Double Lash" or "Dream Lash" (you can get both on Amazon.com) Rub this stuff where you want your eyebrows to grow back (you can also put it on your eyelashes) every night and every morning and it'll speed up the process a lot, trust me. Best of luck!!|`|LZWHmSL6aa	i am not to sure but try putting some Vaseline over them also try castor oil   good luck|`|8np3kmvyaa	about 3 weeks

lNlL0Ag2aa	You can't stop them, just ignore them. But you should look at the bright side, you got the attention of guys who are way older then you.    EDIT:    Don't do anything worse then what they're doing to you. Whatever they say to you isn't as bad as you punching them. I like that phrase "sticks and stones break my bones but words will never hurt me" follow that because these guys will definitely not lay a hand on a girl like you.     But seriously, you should just play along and stick with them because remember, there are a lot of freshmen girls who everyone in school don't even know they exist, you should feel happy that you're getting looks from you because they should have a reason to make fun of you in the first place :D.|`|Sv9SQqyoaa	maybe they are just trying to get your attention  they think your cute or something..  if i were you i would start making   sarcasic remarks after they said that stuff  it'll more like kinda a game than them just making fun of you  i dont think you can ever get them to really stop  because if you do something really crazy  they will probably stop but everyone else will think you are weird|`|h2CyxOEnaa	whenever they say something rude to you laugh and tell them to get a life.|`|A4bdvg1Yaa	theres really nothing you can do to stop them.  however, you could simply use your backbone and say something back, be just as bad as they are to you.  or you could just ignore it.        but it really depends on what they're picking on you for?|`|jPJaSIXPaa	idk im miss popularr everybody loves me =)|`|KjF0p72naa	Do you have classes with them? You're doing well and it's over half over for the year.   Just need to know that some people will do anything to please their own selves no matter who they hurt. If they have picked you as their target I am truly sorry. They really aren't going to mean that much later on. It will be a stupid memory of your high school years.   Best thing you can do is just be confident in yourself and just act like you don't have the time of day for them. It's a step up from ignoring them, but in this case you hold your head up high and KEEP it up, even give them a little "yeah" and head nod on your way out the door if it fits, and sometimes guys like this are just lonely. Do they really hang out with anyone else besides each other? Maybe if you give them just enough attention then you can stand it. Don't expect to find a way to make them stop, just try and find a way to lift your self up in the mean time. Just concentrate on your grades and getting to graduation!   You can do it. Surround yourself with supportive people and be a girl who knows who she is no matter what those idiot teenage boys say. They don't even know you! :)|`|UEAdAuqbaa	Knee one of them in the gonads. Seriously. It doesn't have to be a "no babies for you" kick...just something that will get the message across. Or, if you don't want to do that, threaten to punch them in the face. And be dead serious when you say it.    Trust me...I know how you feel. I am in high school and I get made fun of because I have an....interesting...last name.|`|2DNpd4BLaa	kick them in the balls|`|3DPMU9ABaa	PUNCH THEM IN THE FACE!!!!! (they wont mess with u anymore :) lol)|`|szCv56RRaa	Tell them that  Just ignore them  They have NO life|`|vs7Qgrcgaa	They should get bored and stop eventually. They just have no life, and you should just laugh at them for it =]   try to block them out. If they really get to you where its hard to put up with it, then you should tell someone. Its not baby-isah, its responsible and you shouldnt have to put up with it.|`|BSF4PQEhaa	I've been in a similar situation before, and as tough as it may be, you may have to just wait it out. As stupid as it sounds, the very reason they're doing this is because they feel emotionally deprived, maybe their parents don't pay attention to them, or something of the sort. Yelling at them is just what they want - a reaction out of you.     I would advise you to stick with a friend when you're around them, or at least someone who seems decent enough to stand up for you.     Good luck.
eAznKEEkaa	i think you should go short and some blonde highlights.. :) and have more confidence in yourself i bet your beautiful :D|`|qCmrtQe4aa	Simple answer. Go to the hairstyler.com . You can even go to InStyle.com and then go through the links for a makeover. It allows you to put your picture through thousands of hair styles from short to long, straight, to curly, and even allows you to then try the style you like in every color imaginable. Then, you can even print off the ones you prefer and take it into your hair dresser. You have to take a face straight forward shot to then put into their program. It will crop it to size for you. I work in marketing/PR and I have to look great. I never change my look without going through this program. Trust me. It's the best.|`|0a99819843a04528d1280908d355a691aa	i understand u not wanting to put a picture up but dont call urself ugly or fat. that is was gets me mad. it is wen ppl put themselves down. and just 4 that, im not even gona answer ur question!

Nnqw6AU3aa	If it's knee length, yes, but I wouldn't  wear them with a dress that long.    I think they'll make you look like a  salsa dancer because of the black and  red and the frills. Cool! :)    Silver shoes might look a little better,  though.|`|l1zvTRVAaa	you could, but i'm sure there is a much better shoe that would match|`|i4epthHsaa	No. you can find better shoes than that.|`|DySUxIn4aa	That would look amazing.|`|7WTbwxTOaa	No.|`|bMMmTKRWaa	yeah, but not for that price!|`|r4CJ0NbHaa	They would look great even a silver shoe would go really good to.|`|AA10928232	Yes, should be nice.|`|yqgjjwbqaa	personaly i like regular pumps better but i would wear those|`|X7Zk82Rsaa	Dress looks like a costume but yeah|`|QQdOpG2xaa	yes!! soo cute!!|`|IDVFsy5waa	Yes, adorable combo!|`|AA10867495	noooo too darkk!!!!!  i would wear metallic shoes or something    black and red are too dark together. wear something to lighten it upp|`|sWFIJtGmaa	Personally, I think that dress could use silver shoes. Something a bit strappier that showes off the toes.   In my opinion, black shoes just dont go with red dresses. But maybe that's just me.|`|aYcdbSiDaa	Personally, i would choose silver shoes.|`|A4bdvg1Yaa	fersure.|`|E3wAsSjUaa	No. I'd pick a pair of shoes that are more streamlined, like a pair of silver or gold strappy heels.

c1d312af4250951e942d357ba46d734caa	Yeah.  My old roommate used it everyday (she's 24)  On the other hand, her Mom and Aunt also use it everyday and they're ladies in their 50s, so I don't think it really matters.  If you like it, wear it.|`|0lh4Cxx4aa	I think so. My sister loves it and she's in her 20s.
XIeXQJ21aa	I have the same problem.  I am super pale with freckles.  When I'm in the sun, I stay pale & my freckles turn black.  I look like a dalmation!!!    Anyways, I worked at a skin pathology lab & the motto there was "there is no such thing as a healthy tan."  You can do so much damage to your skin:  premature wrinkles, sunspots, melanoma, etc.    Stick with the tan in a bottle!  I've tried several & they've all turned me orange & stained my clothes.  Last summer I tried Nivea Sunkissed Firming Moisturizer.  It doesn't make you dark, but it gives you a nice, natural color.  Doesn't stain at all either.    It's supposed to work gradually but I noticed a difference the next day.|`|dd2d386096f95b4c9c13d046234f4dddaa	Don't spend "a few hours" in the sun.  You will get a gradual tan if you spend 20 minutes a day in the sun.  Build your tan slowly.  Sunburns can cause skin cancer.|`|Jh0yyYizaa	Wear a sunscreen that protects you from UVB rays but NOT UVA rays (those are the rays that allow you to tan, but also age you).     Keep in mind, tanning will age you so I recommend you don't tan at all.    Be happy being pale. Most movies these days have pale celebrities in them. And lots of models too.   Do you really wanna ruin your skin JUST because its "in" right now?   Tans are kinda going out of fashion anyway.|`|v0ra606Laa	You wont get a proper tan ever i'm afraid especially as your skin is as you say "super pale". You will have to resort to a St tropez spray tan or a cream.|`|AA10311246	Unfortunately, any burn or even a tan is sun damage.  Believe me, I hate this fact too!  I love being tan but the older I get and the more I read, I'm realizing its just not worth it.  But I've become pretty good at using the sunless tanning products.  It may take a few trial runs of different ones to find the one that works best for you, but its worth it to look great and know you aren't damaging your skin!    You may want to look into Mystic Tanning if you haven't before, its at the tanning salons but its just a booth that does an automatic spray of your whole body with sun-less tanning lotion.  Pretty neat!|`|wukXoRCMaa	dunno sorry but can you help me with my question?http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;...

Once they pass the initial stage (when they are red, purple, pink, or brown, depending on the color of your skin) and become white or silver (usually with deep indentation), it's far more difficult to minimize them.[1]   Massage the area with stretch marks three or four times a day with moisturizers that contain cocoa butter or shea butter as a prime ingredient. This hydrates the skin, making it more pliant. Again, this is most effective in the initial stage.[1]   Apply self-tanner. It will help minimize the appearance of stretch marks. Exfoliate beforehand for best results.[2]   Educate yourself about topical treatments. Many are advertised to "repair" stretch marks, but few have actually been proven to be effective. Here's the scoop on what's available:      Wheat germ oil - may help improve stretch marks in their early phase.[1]   Glycolic acid - increases collagen production; can be administered in higher doses by a dermatologist (costs about $100 USD and requires three or four office visits before you see results); has not been fully studied by itself[1]   Vitamin C - certain formulations might increase collagen production, but they'll only help with early-stage stretch marks; for best results, combine with glycolic acid; taking 500 mg of Vitamin C supplements three times a day may also help.[1]   Relastin - the effectiveness of this product is unknown and unverified[1]   Peptide-containing products - these "repair" creams are ineffective; there's no evidence that they work.[1]   Retinoids - they're fairly effective in increasing collagen and elastic production in the early stages, but they should be avoided if you're pregnant or nursing; they're more effective when used in combination with glycolic acid.[1]   Topical tretinoin can lighten stretch marks and reduce their size if applied in the earlier stages.[3] Specifically, tretinoin cream is effective against stretch marks that are less than 6 weeks old, and are still pink or red, but it should not be used during pregnancy. It works by helping to rebuild collagen, but it's not effective against older stretch marks.[4]   Consider laser treatment. It's used to treat both red/purple and white stretch marks, and generally it works by promoting the formation of collagen. It can be expensive, however, and effectiveness is limited.      vascular lasers - won't remove superficial skin, but are effective against redness by treating the blood vessels behind it; E.g. V-Beam, requires three to six sessions, about $450 per session[1]   fractionated laser - minimizes older, more entrenched stretch marks in a process comparable to "smudging"; expect to pay around $1000 USD per session, and you'll need at least three sessions; yields about a 30% improvement.[1] new generation fractional lasers can improve depressed skin, whiteness, and redness in one to three sessions[5]   pulsed dye laser therapy "remodels" the underlying layers of skin and trigger the production of collagen and elastin; it's most effective on new stretch marks, but might be effective on older ones.[4] The light heats blood vessels and makes them collapse so that the color is reduced, but it doesn't affect texture. Five treatments, one month apart, $500-800 per treatment.[2] It is not recommended for anyone with a dark skin tone (Fitzpatrick Skin Type IV, V or VI) because of the potential for skin discoloration, and it should not be used while pregnant or nursing.[6]   fractional photothermolysis also targets the underlying layers of skin; it damages small dot-like areas, not the entire area.[4]   the excimer laser triggers melanin production so that stretch marks take on the same color as the surrounding skin. This can be effective against older stretch marks.[4] Excimer laser is for older marks. 10-20 treatments, two weeks apart, $200-700 per treatment.[2]   Look into microdermabrasion. Microdermabrasion works by blowing crystals onto the skin to "polish" the surface; it's followed by a vacuum tube that removes the crystals and skin cells, stimulating new skin growth. This is effective against older stretch marks.[4]         x0x0_LEi|`|cmJPDAJyaa	Just keep using lotion regularly. Good lucck!

VqJ9SUScaa	i cant stand when people say shaving makes hair course or grow back thicker or anything like that. it's an old wives that that is completely false. when you shave you're simply cutting the hair short and at an angel which makes it appear coarser but since you're not altering the root in any way, it's not physically changing the shaft of the hair.    research hair myths.|`|5a2294193429f0a63be2865feaf53ad4aa	ok i have tried the hair removal stuff and dont use it! i only removes a little hair and smells TERRIBLE even if it is "scented" there is still this nasty smell that makes my whole upstairs stink whenever i try to use it! also its kinda expensive and u can only get like 2 uses per thiongie... anywasy i shave and it makes ur hair course but it is the cheapest and best way to do hair removal. i use venus embrace and i love it! hope i helped|`|YEA799x9aa	waxing|`|8vo6CRhZaa	Easiest, fastest and cheapest would be shaving, and I also got this natural honey wax stuff that i think is from sally hansen and it was really good except it takes a while to do and it doesnt hurt too much and my hair didnt come back for over like 2 months!! and was about 10$. I've also tried this Veet cream hair removal stuff and it sucks. It smelt bad, it stung and doesnt take the hair off too well.|`|6ca682078a28dd28529e2c5e757aeb2baa	I would honestly just say go with shaving.  Nair doesn't work too well and if your skin is the least bit sensitive you will have burn for days! It hurts, trust me.    I haven't really waxed anything other than eye brows, so I can't really help there.    Shaving, contrary to popular belief, does NOT make hair grow back coarser or thicker. Purely myth. So is the pore thing. All shaving does is get rid of hair.|`|933bc8d52e1217aa0f59e9df32d08548aa	Waxing hurts but the hair doesn't grow back nearly as quickly. Shaving is fast, cheap and doesn't hurt but has to be done at least every other day. Cream products in my experience don't work. In the summer when your legs are showing more often waxing is probably the way to go. the rest of the year I just shave.

I know every label says "dermatologist recommended," but I went to a dermatologist, and he actually did recommend it. :P     It's the only thing that works to keep my skin not too dry, not too oily, and clear as well -- I had tried everything before it, including Aveeno, Clean 'n'Clear, and Olay products.     Also, St. Ives Apricot scrub used to make my face burn, so I wouldn't recommend that.     I'd stick with the cetaphil products--cleanser and moisturizer.

OGiuTVEfaa	It said in the Seventeen Magazine that they have them at walmart and if they don't right now, then they will probably get them in within a month.    They usually show things in magazines before they actually come out in the stores. I looked on walmart.com and didn't see l.e.i. sundresses for sale, just other l.e.i. clothes. Try another walmart store if there is one near by or you could always call asking if they have them in stock.    Hope I helped. :]|`|ce1gJF6jaa	All of the dresses are at Wal Mart  I saw a lot of them today when I went in there. They just might not have any where you are located. If I were you I would wait a week or two to see if they have any in stock at the store
QQdOpG2xaa	nope!   fake is putting tons of make-up on and getting lots of surgery to make yourself something youre not,   youre just getting some corrective surgery, minimal, and not fake!|`|bLGCWCwNaa	well in my opinion yes it does, unless you do it for a medical reason. many people have their lips surgically changed but it could reck your face and make you uglier than before. some people would even love to have fuller lips.|`|AA10928232	Yes.  And it will look funny.    Instead, do not wear bright, shiny lip color/gloss.  That calls attention to your lips.  Instead, use a matte lip color in a neutral-ish nude, darker than skin tone but not by much.  Bobbi Brown has some great browns for lips in all shades.    Then, when you line your lisp, use a pale liner and line just INSIDE your natural lip line, not on the lip line.  This will make them appear smaller.  Then put on your matte, neutral lipstick.    God doesn't make mistakes.  He thought you were pretty the way He made you, so He made you that way.  Don't think about changing it!|`|nY9CFcziaa	it doesn't make you fake if it is something that you really want to do.|`|94GjnFjjaa	i think u should keep themm..a lot of boys luvv big lips|`|1nC4fVw3aa	if u have surgery then everyone would notice|`|vZyhHabzaa	No, I don't think so. It's just how you would feel more comfortable. I mean, that's why we wear makeup, right? But I think you're lucky for having big lips! Mine are super tiny.|`|ckuiowpKaa	Hell-o angelina jolie! You always want what you don't have and when you ARE older, the way your lips are now will probably make you look younger.

OkieSeJHaa	you could:  put pictures of your favorite products  your favorite model(s)  some fun makeup looks that you like    just get a magazine like seventeen or teen vogue and cut out all the things you like.  if you like only one thing about the picture(ex: eyes or lips) then only cut them out.  it makes your journal look different and unique because your journal is all about you.  have fun with it!  good luck!|`|FnQWXyp8aa	wow thats a really great idea! if i wear you...i would cut out more stuff from magazines, and then i would go to walmart, target, or michaels, buy some fake flowers and rip them apart, maybe place a flower on it. You can use ribbons or bows, vintage pins, just get creative!|`|ZvLmuCiOaa	put more pictures.   diva would be a good word.|`|CwEmzKVxaa	add more pictures from magazines!

vqlkecS5aa	Definitely! It's the most adorable designer brand! I love it! I must admit that it is quite pricey, but definitely a great brand and they are guaranted. Juicy Couture is an amazing brand in my opinion and they sell all kinds of things like clothes, jewelry, handbags, wallets, shoes, school supplies, coats, accessories, you name it! Great brand!  Good luck |`|xKE3ksx0aa	I love Juicy...It's expensive but everything is really cute and good quality.|`|U1VeiwNWaa	I  absolutely love Juicy! I own a couple of items from that brand and I think that its definitely worth buying. And plus, there stuff is so cute!|`|47af2fda89839c0ec02e273cff59d82daa	its great if your 12 years old or a b list celebrity like pam anderson|`|RI9itLSRaa	You'll get a lot of mixed opinions about Juicy Couture.  Some wills says its tacky, overrated&poor quality, while others are obsessed with it. I personally like their things. The brand is definitely pricey, but I don't mind spending the money on a nice sweater or bag from them. I'm definitely against spending over $250 on a velor track suit from Juicy though. Lucky my boyfriends sister works in Bloomingdale's and gets me a discount or I would never buy them (:    Overall, if you have the cash to spend&like the style, Juicys great|`|XLRx5decaa	I think it's overpriced and plain... but that's just my opinion.|`|h2CyxOEnaa	Eh it's OK. Its not really that cute. If you dont like the colors pink and brown together, then I suggest you dont buy anything from them. So, yeah, there stuff ranges from pretty cute to..EW.|`|RmZZ1MKraa	Its a very cute designer brand with reasonable prices. Macys sells alot of cute juicy stuff|`|NZt26n6haa	yesss i get allll my tracksuits from there..and alot of my pursess . its awesomeee|`|xY65R25kaa	Yeahh, they have some really cute stuff.  Very expensive though.|`|g3dlTCpxaa	I love it. Its very fun and girly brand :)|`|vsjCVgtjaa	yeah just kind of cheap prices but hot lingery i love the shorts that say juicy on th butt|`|xRXZCMSGaa	Yeah, it's a great brand. :] It's kind of pricey, though, so I usually just buy knock-offs.|`|szCv56RRaa	yeaaa|`|kdfQmu40aa	Ughh it's for materialistic people. I have a few of their jewelry and a purse, and I'm telling you that it is just like any other brand, just more expensive. All they are doing is selling the name, "Juicy Couture". Not the actual, good quality product.      Answer mine?http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;...|`|Zynzkj1raa	I think it's just another 'in' brand.    You could find other brands that have better quality, and much cheaper.    Unless you're really rich, I don't think you should really look into buying so much stuff.    One normal t-shirt with the words 'Juicy Couture' on it is usually about $78.00.    I mean, it looks okay. But def. not worth that much money...

1hciyvKdaa	Hair bleaches out through stages. In some people and I found thsi out the hard was, their hair stays in the orange and then orange to yellow stage for a  long time,and the bleach may not be strong enough or not left on long enough or dried out before going to the yellow and then yellow white stage. You can redo your hair but I would go to a salon, so that a pro can seperate all the hair that needs fixing and work on that hair alone. Its time consuming, and very difficult. She will know the right products to use and all. If you cant afford that, get a friend with alot of patience and the desire to help, and both of you go to a beauty supply store and get the advice for technique, proceedure and the correct product and after treatment to get this done. A rat tail comb, precut foil, alot of clips will be needed to keep the groups of hair together and the bleach from getting on other hair. If you do it again and fail it will cost even more for a pro to fix it. If you simply try to dye darker each bleached strand will pull the color more than your normal hair most likely and you will have a reverse highlight, which can look cool or, look disasterous. Good luck, been there, done that, more than once.|`|lHiPygmqaa	Give it some time the color will change slowly I put highlight in my hare 2 years ago and my hair was a yellow orange and I loved it but it slowly changed to blond.|`|7N0hbw6Taa	a month after you dye it.|`|72688aae7e472777b624289e7b6159acaa	you over processed it too many ways.  you're gonna have to let it be.  stop messing with it.|`|F49y3gImaa	Honestly, just try using shampoo and conditioner that isn't for color treated hair. It should strip all of the color out fairly quickly, and then you can fix it by getting a color you actually like without it looking unnatural.    Leaving it alone for a while would be much better, though.|`|lRKu28caaa	Buy a blue/violet based shampoo such as Aveda's Blue Malva or Paul Mitchell's Platinum Blonde... these kinds of shampoos cut the brassiness instantly- I LOVE them. This will at least make it better until your hair is strong enough to re-color.

Besides I love doing what I do and especially making my friends happy and I'm sure your friend feels the same way!|`|2V87n4PKaa	DO NOT GO TO SUPERCUTS.  the only thing they'll give you is months of misery growing out a bad haircut.  im still growing out my hair after they butchered it.|`|pMCqFDGwaa	well for me, color is about 50, but if you do it at home, the box of color is only like 20 bucks at the most. And a cut is usually between 15 and 25 bucks. So the whole thing would cost probably about between 35 and 75 bucks, so maybe like 50 bucks you should pay her.

JzgzvPxvaa	try braiding it tighter and spraying it with a gel while its still in the braid. in the morning do what you normally do, but be gentle to keep as much curls in as possible and then use some hairspray to keep in in place. dont play with it at all during the day. if this doesent help, go to a salon and see if they can perm your hair while its in braids. one of me old friends used to do this. she would french briad her hair and then perm it and it would always be that perfect wave.|`|hQk1uwnGaa	try to put some kind of hair product...like mousse or hairspray!! :)  by the way I love your edward pic.  lol|`|8YoL4Pnjaa	Well what my sister and I do is we leave it in for longer then when we wake up.

TdSaXkFSaa	I have dark hair and tried to go purple with some insainly strong stuff. Nobody could even tell my hair had been touched with dye. Without bleach, it's not going to work, and with bleach it will fry his hair. I would highly suggest going to a salon, even though it's pricey, it's worth it so that the color turns out right, as well as the bleaching process will not be so hard on his hair.|`|UEAdAuqbaa	Die all of his hair the dark purple, and then put bleach on the tips for a couple minutes just to lighten them :)|`|VN8kBnuRaa	Hmmm. so that would make his hair dark brown to black right now, correct??  Well first you need to GET the dye. Just get the purple dye. Dye his hair the dark purple first, wash out and dry.  Then you might have to BLEACH his tips. After that process and rinse && dry apply the purple, it WILL be light because the blonde it was dyed over.    I have NO idea why your brother wants that done to hair....but anywho.  Good luck

X2lesqhRaa	Heres a few tips...  1:Wash your scalp with conditioner, do not use shampoo.You can conditioner wash once or twice a week.  2: Never ever brush your hair, A wide comb or your hands are fine Just steer clear of all brushes.  3:Give your hair time to adjust. It takes 2-4 weeks for your hair to adjust to the no shampoo. It may even look worse at first. Hair is a long-term project and it may take a couple weeks for it to regain its health after being stripped of moisture for years by shampoo  4:Do the final rinse of your hair with cool or cold water. This will decrease frizz and add shine. Leave some conditioner in your hair, especially in dry sections like the ends. It is fine to run your fingers through your hair gently, but do not comb your hair after this point.  5: It's ok to use some products. Look for ones with no alcohol. Use them while your hair is wet only. Dont overload. Steer clear of as many chemicals as you can, try organic substances.  6:Get your hair thinned at a good solan. get layered haircuts. Ask the stylist for tips.  7:My favorite and most effectful. Hair oil you can find it in various international stores. If you only shop at wal-mart and stuff look for baby oil, will work just as good.  8:Use heat protecters before flat ironing wont damage at all.  9:Braid your hair before you sleep will keep the frizz away  10:Just tye it back, its a great times for a new style, but only if it looks good on you.  11: Dont be too afraid of volume Some people would kill for curly, volumized hair.  12: Suggested brands Chi and Bedhead|`|A6Yth8jHaa	well my sister is a hair dresser, and she makes sure that my whole family buys from salons. its only a few dolars more expensive, but what you dont know is that the grocery stores that stock shampoos, are from black markets which use anything from toxic waste to chemicals. so just go to a salon and talk to the worker and she should be able to give you a great recomendation  paul mitchel products work great for me.  good luck!|`|xfRoZF9Qaa	tresame, moisturizer|`|HC9uF5Ibaa	Aussie..That is the best shampoo around!!

ckuiowpKaa	Well I have one up my hip/ribcage and I think it's tasteful because it's hidden, just for me. But I understand why you're asking and that's why I got mine where I did, NO LOWER BACK, aka tramp stamp, lol. I also think on the bicep looks kind of weird on a woman , I think it looks classier in a more disguisable spot. I always picture 'how would i look in my wedding dress with this"? And remember to get it in a place where you're comfortable with it forever.|`|3OTE1t5eaa	I'm with the people who said there really isn't a particular area. Everyone is entitled to their own opinion and u shouldn't be worried about what somebody else thinks of where u get your tat because u should be doing it for u and nobody else. Only thing u should worry about is if it's something u don't mind having forever and whether it's going to interfere with any job/career u decide to go in. Otherwise if someone thinks you're trashy bcuz of it and u know u aren't then it shouldn't matter anyways.|`|9pXKZ5udaa	A woman with a tattoo has already shown she has no class.....location is irrelevent.|`|8THz1sp9aa	I really don't think any location is trashy, it's WHAT you get that makes a tattoo trashy.|`|WYa3UY6Gaa	I don't think it's a location that's trashy I believe that the person, and the tattoo can be whats trashy.|`|WiIUEObTaa	miss on a woman there is no bad location. original artwork ancient Egyptians first done on women. the disrespect shown to women has reached its all time low. it is not the art work it is the ignorance of ignorant males, and their female followers. they do not have any respect for them selves or others. through words and actions of disrespect . they really believe they are superior. the real answer they are idiotic, cowards and morons. they are inferior. you may place your art work were you wish. use your imigination to create what you want. ignore the ignorant morons. you will be fine. i am just a old guy. hate the disrespect shown to women. very small minority. go with what you want were you want. ignore the trash.|`|RU4Oxyllaa	i think tattoo places are your choice.     my lower back tattoo isnt going to be in the middle its going to be on the left side which isnt the normal tramp stamp. so you can make any "trashy" location cute and non trashy.|`|AA11881072	I don't think the locations really..i depends who it is and what it is.|`|wnVGeG8uaa	I would think anywhere that can be covered up nicely. Lower back is deff. trashy, arm/shoulder tattoos look trashy on a women to me too. I have 3 stars on the top of my foot, to me its not trashy because I can cover it up when I need to.|`|HGrK8JmDaa	I think that as long as it's not something stupid, you're okay no matter where it is.|`|Z1OszV3raa	It depends on if you want it to be seen or not...  If you want it to be seen a lot, put it on your wrist or ankle.  If you don't want it to be seen a lot, but it on the back of your shoulder.  "Tramp stamps" are generally thought to be on the lower back, on the hip & lower stomach, or on the chest...  Good luck!|`|LBHJaqXoaa	I don't think tattoos are trashy on anyone - wherever they get it. However, some of the more "acceptable" locations to get a tattoo is the ankle, the butt, the hip area, or the back of the shoulder.|`|tZTtPx3Waa	i personally think that tattoos aren't trashy anywhere except the butt if they are tasteful. for example im getting a tribute tattoo on my back for my dad because thats the place i  have the most space. when choosing a location look at what is underneath it if it is bone it will hurt i got my first one on my sholder because it was the place it would hurt less.    my personal favorite spot is the calf, but thats just me.|`|kCdISEGqaa	It's not the tattoo, it's the person that's behind it.  Put your tattoo wherever you want, make it special to you, you're the only one who has to live with it.  Attitude is everything!!!  Have fun with it!!!|`|JzgzvPxvaa	honestly its the design that is trashy, but the most common places for these kind of tattoos are lower back, crotch/hip area, feet, and breasts. but getting tattoos in these areas doesnt not nessicarrily mean they are, it all depends on what your getting. getting a nautical star or a butterfly on your arm is still trashy. use your own judgement as to whats trashy or not.|`|sv62BSBBaa	I think if you don't want to look trashy, go for your tattoo on your ankle. I know many women with tattoos on their ankles, and I don't think it looks trashy at all.

I'm pretty sure they can tho.|`|EE8hw8Agaa	If the girls arent busy,and your planning on buying a few products,they will be more then happy to do it for you! MAC can do scene,because most of the girls that are MAC ma`s are young and it tune with whats popular,plus most "scene kids" use mac|`|WLZFuBVBaa	i bought some of their make-up products that total $50 and up then you get a free makeover or if you want to pay $45.|`|be01e03cb1940d857445157f422d4379aa	Honestly, I've been to some great MAC stores with people who really knew what they were doing. Then I have been to some lame MAC stores where they have absolutely no clue what they are doing.     They don't cost anything to my knowledge, and you should buy some of the products when they do give you a makeover. They could definitely give you a 'scene look' if they are good artists. That's the tricky part finding good artists. However, I think if you bring in a picture of what you were thinking they could definitely give you the look you want. Make sure they explain to you how to do the look yourself too!     Good luck!
RkimYgEtaa	I suggest using veet waxing strips or go to a professional place and get your body waxed, always better results with that.

bLGCWCwNaa	mascara is always number one. you could also use longer eyelashes and eyeliner. you could use eyeshadow on the ends. the best thing to do is seek professional advice. they will know what to do.|`|UEAdAuqbaa	Use mascara that extends your lashes, and use it on your bottom lashes as well.|`|VN2wyTnFaa	Line your inner water line with white eyeliner. It'll make your eyes look more open. Good luck!|`|idhcqr5Daa	Apply your other basic make-up like foundation, blush and your lip wear.   Dab a bit of foundation under your eyes that is a shade lighter than your skin shade. This will make your eyes instantly brighter.   Create a smoky eye look with eyeshadow (that's a darker shade closer to your eye and adding lighter shades all the way up to your brow, and for this effect the color under your brow should be white).   Apply a white eyeliner on your waterline. This is the number one tip to making your eyes appear wider and more awake! It will instantly make your eyes bigger. You can find white eyeliner at almost any drug store or makeup store that you'd buy your other makeup at.   Apply a mascara that makes your eyelashes look longer, not fuller. Making them longer will give your eyes a better "awake" effect than making them fuller will. Making them fuller will just make your face look too dramatic.   If your eyes are a bit red when you wake up, use some cooling eyedrops.         If you add a small amount of shimmer powder under your eyes, your eyes will look 10 times brighter! It's a great effect!   It might be a good idea to make a thin line of a dark eyeliner under the white eyeliner if it looks a bit strange.         If you try to apply a dark colored eye shadow with the white eyeliner, you'll probably come out looking plain odd becuase your eyes will look bigger but too dramatic. You want your eyes to be softer as well!         Things You'll Need  foundation   darker eyeshadow   lighter eyeshadow   vanilla or white eyeshadow   white eyeliner   lengthening mascara   eyedrops         x0x0_LEi
gWXjNa4gaa	ok, so apparently not too many girl know about makeup. first, NEVER touch ur fingers to ur face. ur fingers carry A LOT of oils & oily skin turns into blemishes. use sponges. second, whatever foundation u choose to use, go a shade DARKER than ur skin. be sure to blend well at ur hair line & where ur chin & jaw meet ur neck. third, after applying ur foundation (which is darker) brush on a powder coverup that's a shade LIGHTER than ur skin color. trust me, this will work. if u have many blemishes ur looking to cover buy some concealer that's dark. apply to problem areas ONLY & blend with ur foundation|`|mhyL7Qw3aa	I really like cover sticks  because they are really creamy and cover everything really good. I like New York Color's cover stick concealer and it only costs $2. I apply this by just putting the stick on the spots I want to cover and blend lightly. When I want to cover something like a blemish I don't blend it all the way. I just tap on it lightly.|`|VjlCDrNtaa	Just look in the CoverGirl section. All of the products are great.|`|31EZgqIcaa	i use true match by loreal. they have tons of colors and it totally blends. put a little dab or 2 on your fingers and then rub it between your 2 index fingers. then dab it onto your problimatic areas and blend using your middle or ring finger.|`|VmSwqqN1aa	i wear almay's clear complexion makeup and i put it on with a brush.  i swear by this make up,it gives the best coverage without ever looking cacky and the brush really helps me blend it with my skin as with a sponge the make up is left "sitting" on you're skin.  hope i helped.

BDboz1eAaa	Well it is almost impossible to be yourself because yourself is a reflection of all that is around you, what you choose to take in and follow.   Rebellion is not necessarily being yourself if you are doing it to fit in.   Humans have the natural tendency to conform and yet we all feel a need to rebel in our lives. Therefore this question is unanswerable.     No one makes our decisions for us, it is our choice whether we want to follow or lead. Maybe our true self is the type that follows, maybe our true self just wants to be proper. Once again unanswerable.|`|RaqmXLbhaa	its a complex theory really... even when we rebel against what we are supposed to do we are still only simply doing the opposite of what we should do not neccesarily what we want to do.     Though I can honestly say I dont try to live to anyones standards but my own. I dont have a clue about fashion but my friends love my style and say its all of my own.  I taught myself to style hair and put on make-up so I do it all my own way.   I'm a self taught artist and musician though so I guess doing things my way just comes naturally.

If you are on a budget, see what the professional at the cosmetic counter recommends, then go to your local drug store and find a similar product for way less money!   Start with a freshly-washed face (and hands, too). Get a facial, or do one yourself. You want your face to be a clear and smooth canvas for you, the "artist," to do your art. Use a good deep-cleansing mask. Do not exfoliate if you have oily or sensitive skin. It will spread bacteria around your face from the already existing blemishes. Use antibacterial soap if you have acne. Also be sure that you replace the towel you use to dry your face every week. Lastly, apply toner by taking a cotton pad that has been dampened in warm water and sweep it over your face. Toner will restore the pH level of your skin and pick up any remaining dirt.   Massage a light moisturizer into your face no matter what type skin you have, avoiding the eye area! This will help oily skin dry, and dry skin become smoother. Wait a few minutes for it to soak into your skin. After letting it sit for a while, rinse face with warm water, and pat dry.   Apply a sheer foundation that matches your skin tone.      To find the right one, go to the makeup counter at a local department store and have the artist there help you.      Wear illuminator to make your skin appear youthful and dewy compared with dull, matte makeup. Skin illuminators come in powder, cream, mousse, etc. L'Oral, Revlon, Neutrogena, and other brands make them - it's like make up with tiny particles that reflect light.      Use a makeup sponge or wedge, starting around the hairline and working your way down. (Use the wedge for this routine because you can be more precise about where the make up goes.) If you want a proper look that looks as if it has been done by a professional makeup artist, try using a foundation brush.   Remember to apply the makeup all the way down to your throat area and keep blending so you can't see where the make up ends. Nothing is worse than looking like you have a mask on your face!   Around the eye area, do very light strokes inward, toward the inner corner of your eye. Don't apply it to your upper eyelid! All of the professional makeup artists say not to apply foundation to this area. This is why you need a foundation that matches your skin. If you want foundation to darken your skin then try putting it above your eyes, and see what you like. Be gentle with this part, because the skin is very delicate and sensitive here.   Remember to blend all the makeup into your hairline. (but not so that your hair is another color!)   Apply concealer to any red or discolored spots. In the corners of your eyes, where it's blue, and around the nostrils are good places for this. Do this after applying foundation, so you don't use too much (many makeup artists do this the other way around). First apply the concealer, then pat very lightly with your finger to blend. Only apply concealer to the area that you want to conceal. Afterwards, use the wedge to blend the concealer in with the foundation. Stand back away from your mirror to see if you have effectively concealed the areas. Try to stand about the distance away from the mirror that you stand away from people when you talk to them. Another way to conceal blemishes is to pat green concealer on the blemishes and red spots, then put foundation over top (the green reduces redness).   Apply a loose powder all over the face using a powder brush. Pat it into the powder; then, with a paper towel, tap the brush so the excess falls off the brush. Lightly brush across the whole face. Use a powder puff (small) to apply powder on the upper lid. Apply a bronzer to your forehead, cheeks, and chin, to give a sun-kissed look,if wanted.   Highlight your brow bone and cheek bones by applying a light powder just below the brow, and to the highest part of your cheek.   Apply a small amount of blush to the apples of your cheeks. Smile so you can see the apple of your cheek. Start the application at the apple and drag the blush outward toward your temple, following your cheek bone. Blend the color down a bit below your cheekbone in towards your earlobe.      If you added too much color to the brush, use the clear side of your wedge to blend it in more until the color is faded out a bit. Your cheeks should have a hint of color. You don't want to look like a clown!   If you don't have much cheekbones you can contour your face, to do so you will need a brown tone of powder, don't make it ultra brown, but a milk-chocolatey kind of color. Apply a it on the brush and apply it under your cheek bones, starting from the temple and going down until underneath the apple of your cheek. Don't make it too abvious as it's meant to look like a shadow. Then, on top of your cheek b|`|WLZFuBVBaa	ESTEE LAUDER WEBSITE...

fcIzDGnBaa	Well obviously diet pills are the fastest way, but I wouldn't recommend them. They aren't good for your health, and you'd gain all the weight back anyway.    Sorry but the only way to really lose weight is to exercise and eat healthy. Now it sounds like you exercise quite a bit, playing every sport and going to the gym 3x a week. I think your problem might be your diet. DON'T TOUCH JUNK FOODS. You want to aim for 5 SMALL meals a day. Be sure you eat a full serving of fruits in all 5 of those meals, and vegetables in atleast 3. Each meal should be around 300 calories. Good luck ~|`|HgRYP3cJaa	You're in the midst of puberty.  Not to worry,  if you're eating right and exercising and feel good, you're fine.  You're just maturing and the kids that are making fun of you - aren't.  Ignore them.|`|NPzDQmlQaa	I have been through it all and know what's it about. The main thing is to stick in there. You can't be an addict to food and never exercise if you want to live a healthy life and keep the weight off. I've worked out, done every diet, and all types of classes.    Nothing works, besides dedication and intelligence towards the subject of losing weight.    First, depending on how much weight you need to lose, your diet is the first concern. You can't eat 10,000 calories a day and expect the weight to come off, even if you are exercising a lot. Which brings us to the next thing. Duh, Exercising...    This is a must especially if you need to a lot of weight. Get at least 30 mins of some good hardcore exercising. Do some cardio, in the long run, it's good for the heart.    However, I find the most hardest part of losing weight/keeping it off, in my diet. It's so hard to keep your fingers out of the cookie jar or those chocolate goodies. I've found a great addition to help any one out, it's a natural weight loss supplement called Proactol. Now don't get all crazy on me and say diet pills don't work. That is true, but not in this case. This one isn't meant to burn pounds while you sit on the couch. It's an appetite suppressant, along with being a fat binder. I saved money on the pills at theweig htlossplace.com along with getting some good info. It basically makes those fingers not go towards the cookie jar. For me it's the best pill I've tried and I've tried cupboards full. Now this doesn't mean you have to follow my foot steps but I've successfully lost roughly 70 pounds and keeping it off til this day.    Well good luck and remember what I said, Dedicate.|`|ENBVkLaYaa	geez, your 12 for **** sake...|`|3AXJEoXoaa	gurl your 12 years old :( dont be thinking of dieting at this age. just live life the way you are and have fun =D go to the gym if you are un happy thats what i am doing :)|`|BLGUGzipaa	First you need to speak with your parent and have them take you to a doctor. Your family doctor can do test to make sure you have no hidden issues, and he/she can give you the right information to help you to lose weight.

Ask your parents to take you to the doc to have your thyroid checked. sometimes it is overeactive.Sometimes it needs meds to calm down. Can you ask them to take you. don't take crap you see on the internet, it's all a bunch of crap anyway. I don't know if i helped you or not. But I hope so.|`|UtT9BPNYaa	Do not use pills they can really mess up your metabolism.you should never use diet pills until your body is done growing seeing a doctor is  where you should start if you want medical help with weight loss.     on the bright side remember muscle weighs more than fat and while you may see your friends as smaller than you now, your 12 your body can fluctuate dramatically during puberty so calm down. More than likely your getting ready for a growth spurt, my brother has done this thing all through his teen years where he gains a few lbs then suddenly grows about 3 or 4 inches.

And for the money they really don't do all that well so I've stopped using them.  Sorry, I don't remember the brand names, it's been a while.  Volumising shampoos and such don't work - in trying to add thickness to your hair they often also make it heavier and if it's fine it'll just pull it down.    Sadly, nothing will make your actual hair thicker so you have to learn some styling tricks.    One trick I know of that does work is to tip your head upside down and spray a strong-hold hairspray on the under-side of your hair. Then brush your hair from underneath while drying it.  When it's nearly dry flip your head back up and, using a round brush, keep brushing from underneath as you finish drying it.  This last step helps stop the ends from sticking out.  The hairspray will give it a little volume and if you've brushed as you've dried it won't feel all stiff.  It might take a couple of practice runs to get the hang of it, but it does work.  However, it doesn't always stay, especially if you get hot or sweat it'll just go all limp.    The other thing worth trying is get a really small amount of hair wax and rub it through your hair while it's wet.  Then dry with a diffuser from the roots of your hair.  I use the diffuser to gently scrunch my hair and end up with a nice gentle wave and some body (my hair is dead straight and thin).

I'd say the healing would be the worst of it all.|`|UEAdAuqbaa	I would assume a nose piercing would hurt more, considering it has more to get through.|`|rcdPwIkXaa	monroe... i think soo.|`|9u9Bq5muaa	I have snakebites,septum and bellybutton.    Septum hurt the most.      I've watched my friends get there monroe's done, For some it hurt a bit.  One of my friends cried but she can't take pain. lol  I don't think it'd be that bad.
96RDuDofaa	A helix piercing is a single hole in the cartilage. An industrial piercing is two holes with a bar going across the upper part of the ear. Here's a diagram to help:  http://images.marketplaceadvisor.channel...
OuOOy8v3aa	You should go to a piercer and ask about it.  I don't think you would be able to change it into a industrial piercing though.  If you can and you don't want the helix piercing then change it into the industrial. If you do want the helix piercing then get it re-done higher.
AA10311246	There's nothing to it!  I used to go all the time but am afraid to now because of the sun damage it does.  It is addicting though because its so relaxing and there's nothing like being tan ;-)  You just go in and fill out a questionnaire about your skin it usually does out in the sun and they determine how long you should go in.  You shouldn't go in very long the first few times, probably like 5-10 minutes., but they'll figure all that out for you.  Then you just go in and get undressed and lay in the bed (or go in a standing one) and it will light all up (looks like a bunch of florescent bulbs) and relax.  It will turn off when you are done.  That's it!|`|j287TrG1aa	You fill out these questions have your parent sign for you.  They help you pick out your lotion theyll explain everything, and give you a tour. And they will probablly start you out for four minutes and then every other time move you up a minute. Idkk its hard to explain just go its not bad

Well you have to master eyeliner and mascara you don't really need anything else maybe eyeshadow if ure going for eagy or dressy. Skin? Wash your face with a face soap and use a face loation afterwards and body use a loation with a selfless tanner to get a little tanner.|`|5Um59Muhaa	I like to keep my face always fresh and clean. I wash it every day so my skin is glowing, and light makeup, using a Mary Kay highlighting stick under my eyes, to hide the circles. Brown mascara to match my original color, so as not to actually look like I'm wearing makeup.|`|vsWUHwAyaa	keep it simple =]|`|tzmCxzuKaa	Putting lotion on after every shower gives me glowy moisturized skin!!|`|DudwxNOyaa	Hmmmm.... well there is one thing I do :) When I wake up in the morning and have somewhere to go where I want to look my best,  turn music on and get ready. I wash my face twice, to get all the oil off, then moisturize with oil-free stuff. Then I put all my make-up on. But i always put one coat of mascara on, then my eyeshadow, then everything else. Then I put a bunch more coats of mascara on. THen i curl them. I don't know if it's the clor of my eyes or what, but something about putting more mascara on after everything else is finished makes my eyes look brighter and pretty :)|`|8vo6CRhZaa	Apparently vaseline on your eyelashes makes them longer

SLSX6QQsaa	If you have hair that is anything other than blonde, you should not use Sun In to get highlights.  Learn from me, I have dark brown hair and I wanted high lights soooooo bad in Junior High, so I sprayed Sun in all over my hair and it turned an ugly orange brassy shade, still brown.  Sun In is good for blonde hair that you want to make a little brighter from the sun.  You could actually get the same effect with lemon juice on a blonde.  For a brunette, I think the best thing I found rather than real highlights is actually hair mascara.  You would be surprised how real it looks.  You just take the mascara like wand and streak it down your hair, and it really does work. Then you just wash it out at night.  Its perfect because it doesn't damage your hair and you never get roots plus you can put them wherever you like.|`|fa03eac22d262830bdb32163b05eeb26aa	Sun In will only work if you actually go out in the sun. my friends who hav dark blonde hair used it and it really worked over the summer but then there hair started to grow out and the highlights looked awful but htey didnt want to go spend money on real highlights so it took a while for there hair to fade back to normal. my suggestion is to not go against your mom because it will probably look bad and you will get in trouble.
9QL9Wpo8aa	It depends on the face. Some girls were meant for long hair but some others have beautiful faces that are accentuated by the short hair cut.|`|oJQmzPahaa	long hair is ALWAYS sexier|`|U1R87Ec0aa	It is not dependent on the haircut.  It is more dependent upon the personality of the person and whether or not they can pull off the style.|`|mbHOvWxKaa	short hair fukk that long hair bullshit|`|d2cbefbb54e74c2f40a462040ba8e0c5aa	Depends on the shape of the girl's face, how thick the hair is and how well it is cut.

HGzKBc4eaa	Is that you?! No, don't go blonde. It will be really hard to get it light blonde  and it will turn a bronze like color most likely. By the time you get it the right color it will probably be fried.

Either make your hair darker, or with red tints. That would be fine, but with a color of blonde, that would be too much of an extreme change.|`|3Yfp3QUfaa	I think that since you have blue eyes that blonde would probably look good, but sometimes blonde looks bad when you have brown roots.     hope i helped =p|`|Ks3QlWMiaa	ehh...u wont look that nice though|`|s1YxUho7aa	it depends how you look! but i would say yes|`|At2JL4MVaa	I think your skin tone might be a bit too dark for the look you're going for.

be01e03cb1940d857445157f422d4379aa	The reason your roots are so much lighter is because bleach is activated my heat and your head, is heated. She should have put a heater on your hair while the bleach was sitting to even out the color.     Yes, the colorist at the salon should be able to make you look presentable. Depending on your natural color they may or may not be able to get it back to your color as hair color is a tricky process with many factors contributing. If nothing else you will have an even hair color *hopefully* close to your natural color.|`|ee74f3aa67efefa8e49e21be6f4ec61faa	If the hair stylist is competent and knows how to correct bad hair color jobs, etc. she should have no problems covering up the error.  Talk with her and make sure she sounds like she knows what she is doing.  If you don't think she does, get up and walk out and find someone else.  If done incorrectly, you can end up with really damaged hair that will end up breaking off, etc.  If they offer you some deep conditioning treatments, take them up on it.  Those will help prevent severe damage to your hair.  Best of luck.
Svgru3Tnaa	You sound beautiful the way that you are. But, if you feel like your ready for a change, maybe try something bold. I also have blue eyes and a narrow face and I actually went RED. I put a 6RR or a 7RR on my hair and it turned out amazing! It was the color of Ariel's hair from The Little Mermaid. (My girls LOVE it) as well as everyone else. I get complemented on it daily and it goes so good with my blue eyes. I dont know if your hair is short or long but either way it should still look great. If you dont like that idea and your just thinking of a hair cut maybe you might like something like short layering to thicken your hair all the way around, or some long layers to make it seem a little thinner.  What ever you decide Im sure you will look beautiful and if you decide not to change your look, thats ok too. Best wishes and good luck!|`|w4kdTalPaa	Wash it.|`|d83eb00973f7bbcaa0e054814594bfd5aa	Have a stylist cut hair to frame your face.|`|JhNI2gCgaa	short to your shoulders and a  layer to ur ear
CtHi5L78aa	no i wouldnt re color your hair if you just did it, go to sallys and pick out a toner just to make the color more vibrant you only leave it on for no longer than 30 mins. but ask the people there to help to pick out the right one with the right developer
ULI9BZPIaa	I am in the exact same boat as you, but you know what?  I hate my boobs and think they're ugly, one bigger than the other, hate the siza and shape of my areolas.....but my man LOVES them!...and so has everyman before him.  So, I wouldn't worry about it, hate them all you want, it will never end, but you'll leran to enjoy them when you need to.

Don't worry its not that bad of a problem. Try using air bras they could help you.|`|1P3usILUaa	Self image is a complex topic ~ however, talk to your Doctor about your distress and ask about what alternatives there are available to you.  One can have specialty support made individually for you as well; which would help on a number of levels in the day to day.    I would suggest too ~ you are fine just as you are.|`|QtSxulUBaa	I have uneven breasts too, most people do although the difference is usually slight. Depending on how old you are, your breasts can change size/shape drastically. Also if you gain or lose weight they will change accordingly. Eventually you may come to appreciate them for things like getting service in a bar quickly while wearing a low cut top.    I'm sorry you don't like them, is there anyone in real life you could talk to about it? If you are relatively young you might just need to 'get used' to them. It might be an idea to search for images of breasts so you can compare, I'm sure yours aren't the worst pair on the Internet.     Good luck|`|nVMAOJd7aa	I am with you on this one, but you know what it's mainly in our own head. I say the same kind of stuff about mine. I am getting older and I've notice gravity doing its thing and I am not happy not one bit!! But everyone telling me there average. Seeing my girlfriends change clothes I've notice their right, but why why why( ha-ha)? I use to be a D and now I'm into a C  , I am a skinny person , I've notice when I gain weight they fill themselves more. But is that my only option; to be over weight with great boobs , or skinny with saggy ones? Anyways you are not alone the only females I know that are happy with their breast are the ones with tiny ones , and they are just now happy with them . When growing up I was content with mine , they weren't now the table has turned. Oh-well what can we do about it? If we all had $$$$ we all be perfect on the outside! =)|`|GzlckRcnaa	don think about it..|`|V4iZcrVmaa	why dont u get plastic sugerey|`|LCIcUTwNaa	Be happy you have them and they are healthy.All women's breasts aren't the same size for them either.|`|T1CuRwm3aa	One of ways to figure out if girl have fake breast is to see if they be both same.

It makes it very hard to find a bra that fits. The problem is that this is totally normal and just natural so there really isn't anything that i know of that can help. You could try doing certain exercises that might help. But Almost everyone has difference size breasts just sometimes its not as noticeable as other (those lucky people) When i was pregnant, they were pretty even but after that, back to normal. You can get bras specially made to make them look even but it took me a long time to not be so insecure about mine. Now i joke about it. If you cant find any way to improve it, just try to be comfortable with it, you will feel a lot better about it once you aren't so self conscious about it (if you are.) Good luck hun. You could also talk to an OB/GYN about it and see if they have any suggestions.|`|u7bdK71Paa	Its only natural for your breast to be uneven.

I hope I helped. :D|`|AA11574978	sorry its normal, and even if a doctor did them they won't match perfectly.    I wonder I am right handed and do most of the heavy lifting with my left (carried my kids mostly on my left) and my left breast is smaller. Do you use your right one for heavy lifting?    If so try lifting weights with a smaller amount on your right and heavier on your left.  Maybe you might even out. Just a thought.|`|0a1txkfraa	stop looking at them...|`|anZirq1baa	I'd be willing to do an inspection.|`|6ca682078a28dd28529e2c5e757aeb2baa	Only 10% of women have even breasts, so don't feel bad on that part.  And no two girls are the same, you just gotta love who you are.|`|NVSambhPaa	Honey, no girls breasts are completely even, unless they get them done professionally by a doctor. Any girl with natural breasts, do not have even ones. Even if they try and say they do, they really don't. It's just like your feet, one foot is always a little bit bigger then the other. It's no big deal, everyone has that problem. Hang in there, I'm sure once you get older it will all start to even out a little bit. Give it time.
U1R87Ec0aa	You should wash and condition your hair every other day.  You can still wet it down on the opposite days, but do not use shampoo or conditioner.  If you are straitening it, you should use a heat activated hair treatment.  I suggest Chi heat treatment (therapy) for your hair.  It works wonders.  And it smells great.  Take it easy on your hair.|`|Wa2fpDLFaa	shave it all of!|`|IRH71dwIaa	One trick to keep you hair straight is to not wash it every day.  Depending on how oily your hair is you could probably wash it once a week. And instead of flat ironing your hair everyday to keep it straight, try adding some serum to your hair before going to bed and wrapping it. They is one technique I use (and my african american females use) to keep my hair straight without flat ironing it everyday. Here's a youtube link to show you how:    http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q3pOtV_QX...|`|KzljfKjpaa	i do the same thing  and once a week i use aussie 3 minute miracle  it makes ur hair smell wierdish tho  but its rly good i used it after bleaching my hair and it was silky again|`|r1xJIPDeaa	uhh try and get it styled a way it looks really good so you don't have to straighten it. don't blowdry your hair for a while until it is healthy again.brush it instead for a long time.take your vitamins and don't put too much product in it you should do this for a long time and a lttle while(3 weeks or so) after it is healthy.if you find that you like your hair better this way keep it up your hair will be beautiful if you do hope i helped!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!...

urCMCb1laa	Yes You can Use Airbrush Makeup In A Regular Art store Airbrush Compressor & brush!  When I went to Makeup school My Instructore Told us That the Makeup & Art stor compressors were the same (& thats all she used were the 50$ art store Airbrush System But with Airbrush Makeup)    I Use Both An art store System & a Dinair System I LOVE both But my Dinair System is Leopard & small (easy for travel) Plus it looks cool lol    It is cool to use any system BUT use ONLY Airbrush Makeup I strongly suggest Dinairs Makeup!!!!  Hope this helps!!!|`|VN2wyTnFaa	I'm not sure what you're asking. Do you mean can you use regular makeup in an airbrush tool? If so, no way. Regular foundation is way too thick to get through, so if you tried it, it would clog the whole thing up, and you'd have to disassemble it to clean it. Good luck!|`|uReFjOONaa	ah
be01e03cb1940d857445157f422d4379aa	Your hair will turn to mush. Literally mush, and it will fall out. That will chemically burn your hair to shreds!! PLEASE don't do that!     You can go to Sally's Beauty Supply and get tub of hair bleach to do that to your hair for really cheap. So please, just go get the hair bleach.     Besides, bleaching your hair doesn't turn your hair blonde. If your hair is dark brown that color incorporates all the other colors that are lighter than that. If you were to bleach your hair, it has to remove red brown, red, red orange, orange, orange gold. And then your hair is gold- meaning yellow because most non-salon quality hair bleach isn't good enough to go further. You also have to put color overtop the bleach, because bleach isn't a color. So then you have to figure out which blonde you want. So I would suggest if you don't want to pay for a Salon to go to Sally's Beauty and talk to them, and they will give you the right products.|`|k8Emqid7aa	Please just use bleach designed for hair.

hLCk5p0paa	It's really not bad! I got mine done for the first time over the summer and was scared,but it wasn't bad. Mine were only red for a few hours, and it only hurts for a second after it happens(like getting your ears pierced). just don't scrunch your face or close your eyes, because you can get wax on your eyelashes. also, they lady who did mine put her finger on the spot right after she waxed it because she said it like cools it down or somethingg..? hah idk but really mine didn't hurt, and i'm a huge wimp!  Good Luck!|`|HgrzVACfaa	it does sting a little for a second but when they're doing it try to think   of something else. after they do it , it does leave redness ( not to bad.) I Hope i helped.|`|etgjETFZaa	for your first time it will feel different but it shouldnt hurt too bad. personally i think plucking is more painful. the girl just does little sections at a time so its really not that bad. the warm wax actually feels good and it is relaxing for a little bit. then she puts the paper stuff down on the wax and quickly pulls it off so it only stings for a second. afterwards your skin around your eyebrows will be a little red and thats normal and maybe a little sensitive. then she puts lotion around your eyebrows and thats it! (mine stay red for a few hours and then it goes away) Eveyone gets it done and its really no big deal. i wouldnt call it painful it just lighlty stings for a few seconds and it actually kind of feels good. then wala! your eyebrows have a cool new shape.|`|sP4KSFvQaa	Much much less than plucking. You may feel a bit of pain for a second when the strip gets pulled. no big deal.
bogfZ6Xsaa	A dark green would be pretty.....it'll accentuate your eyes and hair and makes your skin look more olive colored. As far as the lips maybe put a bit of light cover-up on them with a wet make-up sponge before applying gloss and they'll lighten a little so you can use whatever color you'd like!  Hope this helped!|`|C3WlLuYoaa	I'm thinking green would be a nice color for you...teals or bright green should give your skin a little color and bring out your eyes.|`|U8TRm1Jtaa	get a aqua or teal it will go good with ur eyes and the brown hair|`|j2I0IHM9aa	orange, teal or aqua, or blue|`|Jnr7Eu7Jaa	yah i would say emerald green would look great or any other shade og green. if not, a nice rich blue maybe electric blue i love that color would look good too. red and black would look good on anyone. hope it helped!

No, really, your best bet is one of two things:    1) Go see a psychiatrist, these people are here to help you.

Sometimes, life is hard, it becomes impossible to think because so much is happenning and you end up harming yourself to relax it with some soothing physicial pain. But trust me, it really isn't soothing, it's worse, because this pain can affect your health. Don't give up. Try to eliminate the problems in your life, and then you won't need to cut yourself.

You have to respect your body and know who you are before you realize you're hurting yourself and putting a low self worth upon yourself ..

OpdHN6Ivaa	First you would have to bleach your hair. It's kinda of like when you use a yellow crayon on black paper and it doesn't show up but when you use it on lighter paper it shows up. Bleach your hair, than use the color that you want it to be. Make sure you look at the box because it will tell you what the color will look like if you have a certain hair color.Good Luck. :D|`|nz8q1tDfaa	First of all that is a huge change.  From a professional stand point I would tell you it could be done but only over a period of several processes if it is not your natural hair colour and by looking at it i would say it wasn't,  if i'm correct I would also tell you that your hair wouldn't look like that at all.( those are extensions)  it would probably end up looking very frizzy and damaged if you tried going that light at first.      I suggest taking baby steps it is an investment but in the end you'll have the health and the colour you want.  besure to cross examine the colourist you talk to and that they suggest what i said first.  if not then they are one of two things...inexperienced or greedy because trying to do it at once is very costly and harmful... becareful do not take it lightly     remember because they have a license doesn't mean they are meant to do hair.|`|eCJMXedMaa	I think light brown would be cute but I wouldn't go blonde|`|7N0hbw6Taa	omg! you would look so cute in that color! you should go for it!
idhcqr5Daa	Put loads of moisturizing conditioner in your hair before even entering the shower, because dry hair takes less damage than wet. Rub the conditioner in.   Detangle the hair by using a wide-toothed comb. Gently pull through until hair has lost the large large tangles.   Massage a bit more conditioner into the ends of your hair and start to detangle it with a finer-toothed comb.   Jump into the shower and shampoo. People with especially dry hair should use a shampoo for dry/damaged hair.   Condition just the ends of your hair once more.   Rinse hair with cool water for sleeker, shiner strands.   Comb and then brush hair. Comb first to prevent breakage.   Let air dry. Your hair has already suffered enough; blow-drying it will help dry out you hair. If you truly must blow-dry, keep the heat setting on cool.         If your hair is still tangled, try using a leave in conditioner after your shower.   Avoid tangled hair in the first place by securing long hair in a tight braid or bun.   Be patient.   Take care of your hair in general (wash frequently) and you will be much less prone to annoying frizz and tangles.         x0x0_LEi|`|QRG2L5Qjaa	You should go to the salon and get it proffessionally straightened.

My upper back was actually my most painful tattoo yet (first tattoo) but it was bare able. My back on scale 1-10 would be a 5, my upper arm would be 3 and my forearm a 2.

mKULeVN4aa	if u get tattered ends (uneven ends) it made my hair less curlier when i straighten it nd easy to work with. when u leave ur hair curly, i have tons of things i do to make it not poofy.  Rule  1: NEVER COMB YOUR HAIR DRY; it makes it frizzier.  what i do is i comb my hair in th shower, and use a lot of conditioner, use one tht makes ur hair slimyish, nd wash almost all of it out.  then, before u go to bed, braid ur hair into 4 or 6 sections nd hairspray it. then when u wake up take out the braids nd put in more hairspray. works for me|`|UEAdAuqbaa	Instead of trying to flatten it down with a straightener, try curling it or giving it "beachy waves". That way it can be poofy and without seeming wierd. :)

0hjx75hfaa	I have hair like yours too. I had trouble growing my hair too because of all my gross, dry ends. If you are trying to get healthy hair that grows this is what you should do:    Use a hydrating shampoo. I suggest Dove.   Use LOTS of conditioner, and only on your ends. Use a little on the top of your head and leave on for 3 minutes. Rinse it out, and if your hair still feels dry, use some more but only on the ends. Rinse.   Drain hair in shower, don't wrap it in a towel. Just use the towel to sort of pat the hair dry.  LEAVE-IN CONDITIONER! = Life savior. This stuff is amazing. Just a little will do wonders and make your hair feel like silk.   Don't use heat styling. However, if you must (like me.. can't live w/ out my straightener) use a good heat protector.      Foods that are good for hair are foods with lots of protein. Avocados are good for eating and for using as a leave in hair conditioning treatment.     Mash avocado in a bowl and leave on your hair for about half an hour and then rinse and repeat the washing steps above.     Also, if you're intrested in growing out your hair, massaging your scalp while lying upside down on your bed stimulates growth.     Here are some tips I found on various websites for split end remedies:        *  Take 1 egg yolk and a teaspoon of almond oil. Mix them well and apply it on the scalp and hair. After half an hour, wash your hair.      * Put a mask of mashed avocado or mayonnaise on wet hair. Allow it to stay for at least 15-30 minutes and wash it afterwards.      * After each workout or demanding exercise, wash your hair. This is because salt developed through perspiration erodes the hair.      * Use regular conditioner after every hair bathe and deep conditioner, once a month.      * Take one teaspoon each of castor oil, mustard oil and olive oil. Mix them well and apply it on the scalp to the complete length of hair. For 30 minutes, massage the scalp and then, wrap the head with a hot towel. Thereafter, wash your hair and let them dry naturally.      * Make a habit to trim your hair regularly. After every six weeks, you can trim your hair to avoid split ends. Infact, it is the only cure once you have got your hair split.    The Best Home Remedies for Rescuing Dry Hair:    Beat up on an Egg: Separate the white of an egg from the yolk, and whip the white thoroughly. Then add 1 tablespoon of water to the yolk and blend until the mixture is creamy. Next, mix the white and yolk together. Wet your hair with warm water, remove the excess moisture, and apply the egg mixture to your scalp with your fingertips. Massage gently until the froth is worked into your scalp, and then rinse the hair with cool water. Keep applying the mixture until it is used up. Continue to rinse until all of the egg is washed away    Go for the Mayo: Heat up one half cup of mayonnaise until it becomes an oily, white goo and apply to dry, unwashed hair. Cover your hair with a plastic bag and leave on for at least 15 minutes. Then, rinse and shampoo thoroughly.    Mix up a Tropical Treat: Mash one over-ripe banana (the blacker, the better) with a mushy, rotten avocado. Massage this exotic puree into your hair and leave on for at least 15 minutes before washing outin the kitchen sink!).    Grab a Cold One. Beer can give your dry hair a healthy sheen. Before you blow-dry or style, use a pump bottle to spray brew onto your hair. The beer will leave your hair shiny and sleek and its odor will disappear quickly.    In addition to using these home remedies regularly to avoid dry hair, try the following preventative measures:    Avoid overshampooing. Shampooing can wash away the hair's protective oils, so try washing less often and use a mild shampoo labeled "for dry or damaged hair."    Condition regularly. Conditioners protect the hairs cuticle layer from splitting from the shaft. Pick a conditioner that works well for your hair and use it after every shampoo.    Wear a hat. Too much exposure to wind and sun can leave hair thirsty.    Trim off split ends. The biggest problem caused by dry hair is split ends. Schedule a trim every six to eight weeks to keep fraying ends under control.    Ease up on the heat. Heat (in the form of blow dryers, as well as straightening and curling irons) can quickly dry out hair. Let your hair air dry occasionally. Try using plastic cylinder rollers to straighten hair by wrapping slightly moist hair under and around rollers for about 10 minutes. For curling, try using sponge rollers overnight or sleeping with moist braids.    Don't swim without a cap. Use a rubber cap to protect your hair from the damaging effects of chlorine. If you must forgo a cap, rub a spoonful of olive oil into your hair before diving in.    Deep condition hair after its exposed to salty or chlorinated water.       ***REMEMBER TO GET A TRIM EVERY 6-8 WEEKS***|`|HGrK8JmDaa	Mayonaise works really well... So does spraying beer on your hair.  (I know, sounds weird.)|`|7N0hbw6Taa	step 1  Go to the salon and get a trim. If you're serious about getting rid of your split ends, you'll first want to get a haircut. In order to remove split ends you'll have to have 1 to 1 1/2 inch of hair removed.    Step 2  Brush your hair before you shower.    Step 3  When towel drying your hair, do not bunch your hair up in your towel. If possible, let it air dry. Using a towel can sometimes be damaging to your hair when you bunch it up inside the towel and may even pull strands out.    Step 4  Do not brush your hair after a shower.    Step 5  Condition often! Do it every night if possible. Find the best conditioner you can and use it.  Step 6  Avoid curling irons, hair straighteners, and blow dryers. Basically, avoid anything with heat. Heat damages your hair big time.

Ceramic iron.|`|be01e03cb1940d857445157f422d4379aa	You can try to use a straightening balm or cream like Frederic Fekkai Ironless straightening balm http://sephora.com/browse/product.jhtml?...    Your straightener might not get hot enough either which doesn't hold the style in all day. You said your hair is sticking out, probably because you straightened the ends of our hair as well. Try to avoid the ends when straightening or curve the straightener on them so they don't stick straight out. Also, whenever hair gets wet it tends to go back to it's natural state, that's just what happens. You can try to put baby powder in your hair at the beginning of the day or before a show and rub in into your scalp. This will help soak up sweat so your hair can stay straight!

e1434520b7d6b7db2b483084c9ad434aaa	If you want to run out and pick something up locally, I recommend trying the following products:  - Drugstore: L'oreal out of bed weightless texturizer (black tub, use under gel), LA Looks or Herbal essences gels, Suave naturals or vo5 conditioners, L'oreal vive pro hydra gloss or nutri gloss for curly hair, red Cream of Nature shampoo  - Organic/specialty store (like whole foods): Giovanni Direct Leave in condish, G conditioners, G tea tree shampoo, Aubrey Organics Honeysuckle Rose or White Camellia Conditioners, AO B-5 Design gel  - ULTA: Devacurl products, Biosilk rock hard gelee, MOP-c curl defining cream (They also carry drugstore products and giovanni.)    These are all good things I have used, but be sure to tinker around with amounts and how you use any products. For hair type specific products check out these forums:  http://www.naturallycurly.com/curltalk/  There you can find others with the same hair type and try out some of their favorite products. However, the most popular ones are usually only available online.    Here are some basic tips for curly hair that you might find helpful:  *Try to find a stylist who knows how to work with curly hair. You can find reviews by region here: http://www.naturallycurly.com/curlsalons  *Don't shampoo every day.  *Comb conditioner through hair in the shower.  *Apply styling products to dripping wet hair. Scrunch or twirl hair to achieve desired shape.  *Use styling products suited for your hair type. Dont know yours? http://www.naturallycurly.com/hair-types  *Avoid terrycloth towels on hair; use linen, paper towels, or t-shirts instead.  *Air dry or use a diffuser with your blowdryer.  *Don't touch (or brush!) your hair while its drying.  *Once completely dry scrunch out any crunchy texture.    Lastly, it has made my hair so much better since I started the curly girl method! I used to almost never wear it down (it was a frizz/poof ball), but now I have pretty, shiny curls. ~:) Its pretty radicalno sulfates (shampoo) or siliconesbut its so great for curly hair.

tCCuF55uaa	Sure you can. But I would sell either. I hated selling avon. It's really hard to get customers and make money. Sometimes you have to pay out of your own money for things. It was such a hassle I just quit. Leave avon books (campaign books is what they call them) on everyone's door and put your number on back of them that way people can call you if they want to place an order. Leave business cards at public places. Give people some samples. Avon sells samples in packs. Make sure your family pays for the things they order because if they don't you do. You won't end up making money like that.|`|ncCWCIEFaa	I don't recall any provision saying you can't however I personally would not how can you expect any client loyalty when you have non yourself.  I would research both companies and choice which fits your needs best.   As for the client build up I don't know about Avon but in Mary Kay this is all part of the training you get after you get your starter kit.  I would start at the beginning your asking how can you make more when you haven't even started.  In Mary Kay you make 50% of what you sell so if you hold a class of 4 people and make $300 you keep $150.00.  so the more class you hold the more you make then you can decide to move into leadership with team building which gives you 4-13% commission and the ability to earn the career car.|`|AA10928232	I"ll bet one or both companies have a provision preventing you from selling a second line at the same time you sell theirs.  I'd pick one, and jump in with both feet.  The sales directors and your "higher up's" are great at telling you how to find clients and make more moeny.  Pick one and focus.

BB76pnzzaa	yes. My older brother used to use it all the time (he kept the peach black head remover in the shower), and it really worked. I even started using it too!|`|uReFjOONaa	dnt know|`|vkyfiiz2aa	Sure I would think so. Exfoliating is for men just the same as for women. It is good for your skin. I use st. Ives all the time. It does work.
T87pwfi4aa	Liquid eye liner is better than the pencil ones to me;    Close one eyelid and place the liner brush in your right hand if you're right handed and vice versa.    Put your finger at the end of the closed eyelid and pull your lid horizontally backwards (towards your ears). You don't have to pull too far.    Starting at the end of your eyelid closest to your nose, run the liner along eyelid staying very close to eye lashes. Only go 3/4 of the length of your eye lid.    Now open your eye and wait a few seconds for the liner to dry. Fan with your hands to quicken process.    When dry finish your lined eye. I like to draw a "tail" that tapers. If you mess the tail up, just dip a Q-Tip in water, wipe away and start over.    Now repeat these steps with the other eye.|`|3AXJEoXoaa	put thin thin line on the top lid, then put a thin line on the bottom lid. and curl your lashes :)|`|OvKkMscVaa	pull eye lid down and do staright like across wlo getting under eye|`|Jh235bFtaa	Just put eyeliner on your waterline and nowhere else - it'll look natural and pretty. Also, if you use black eyeliner now and want it to look more natural I suggest trying a dark brown eyeliner instead. You can find some very pretty brown eyeliners with hints of gold that will make any eye color pop and look pretty.|`|uUHMg5Szaa	don't apply it on the lid,  apply it on the area under the lashes (inside the eye) on the top lid, and above the bottom lashes.    (=|`|5xyP8ejHaa	Go for thin lines. If your eyeliner runs, dab a cotton swab in some make up remover and wipe away the smudging/excess eyeliner. (In case you don't do that already.)|`|d83eb00973f7bbcaa0e054814594bfd5aa	Use the eyeliner that comes with the sponge tip.  It can be used to "smear" the eyeliner.|`|9U5GV6xmaa	Don't use too much heavy eyeliner. Maybe tone it down a shade, and add a soft color, of eyeshadow above it.Or a light eyeliner, above the regular. Good Luck!!!    Oh, sharpen your eyeliner, for the dark pencil, to make it more fine. The other can be a bit smudgy.....Looking Good!|`|c1d312af4250951e942d357ba46d734caa	I use this:  http://www.sephora.com/browse/product.jh...  You can put on as little or as much as you like.  If thats you in your avatar, you'd be fine with the color it comes with but you can get a dark brown powder as well for a natural look.|`|DySUxIn4aa	Pull down your eye lid and apply it on the inner side, but slightly on the outside. That way, only a thin line it on the lashes. =]|`|bMMmTKRWaa	try to avoid black and go for like a dark indigo color instead.  And if you make it so that it's dark on top, but on the bottom only go about halfway across your bottom eyelid and make it light and faded.    good luck|`|ZMVs9bGxaa	apply less if you look glossy!  use a pencil eyeliner  just apply a thin line along your bottom lashes water line.  or try different colours other than black to look less gothy|`|l1VA4W6kaa	Try a lighter color instead of black, and don't put it all around your eye, just put it on the top, and then in the corner of your eye furtherest away from your nose.

dvevk1qbaa	none of the links worked for me.... but i think you should go super shiny cald anyways, thats what my BF said too. you probably have good skin and it will look good , no probs shaving, if you you do    EDIT__  but then again he is bald and tells everyone to shave their heads....girls like long hair, or not super short hair, in my experience but maybe you should shave it. Because if its hard to manage you probably need a lot pf product in it and NO ONE likes gunky sticky hair|`|6jHYanchaa	You might be able to use curl relaxer. It works pretty good.    But personally, I think puffy, curly hair is better than downward, curly.|`|jzrvA1pXaa	Well i'm a girl..&& i got the same type of hair.  Afro..>.>    You could do texturizer that's what i do to make it look like you want it.    (:  && it's easier to comb.    Hehe. :D
dvevk1qbaa	texturizers will not work at all.    Your hair is WAY to thick and coarse for that.     You are going to have to go to a salon and get it professionally relaxed. Make sure you bring a picture of what you want though. they might do it too long and your hair might become TOO straight. Also try to get a chemical straightener that has NO LYE, if they say its impossible they are lying. I did it to my hair once. If you have someone help you , you could do it at home, just go to the drug store and get some...read ALL INSTRUCTIONS VERY CaREFULLY.    then you will have to use products in your hair that contain natural oils, like jojoba or almoond oil, easy to find at any drug store    good luck, My hair is curly as hell and I know it can get overwhelming|`|jzrvA1pXaa	Didn't you post this question already?! :|    Oh well..    Like i just said..Do Texturizer!    It's like a curl relaxer..(:  Works good.    Go try it!

Some people like that flexibility, but if you want it bone straight you might need a super relaxer. On your next touch up you'll need to apply the relaxer from root to ends. Start with the new growth, then once all that is straight for the last 5 minutes apply relaxer all the way down to your ends as you smooth it with your hands NEVER A COMB. RINSE thoroughly and neutralize . A moisturizing shampoo followed by a deep conditioner or reconstructor like apoghee will be essential this time because you re-relaxed the entire hair shaft.  Then your hair should remain straight.

lPCjNkEnaa	Make youre Eyes Appear Bigger:  Many women want their eyes to really open up or look bigger than they really are. The best product to help you achieve this is mascara. There are so many mascaras on the market, all promising longer or thicker lashes. Try several brands and see which one you prefer. In addition to mascara, use an eyelash curler to get maximum curve on your lashes. This inexpensive accessory makes your lashes look longer and after applying mascara to curved lashes, they really stand at attention. To get an open eye look, try these steps:   Apply light colored shadow all over your eyelids. You can color your crease in a slightly darker shade if desired, but too much dark shadow makes your eyes recede. Peach, tan, gold and beige are all shades that will work.   Dab a spot of even lighter shadow in the middle of your eyelid.   Apply eyeliner in a thin line.   Curl your eyelashes with a curler.   Apply mascara in two or three thin coats. Make sure to place the wand at the base of your lashes and pull it all the way to the ends in smooth motions.|`|taYFAwlzaa	Put mascara on the outer part of your eyes. Dont line the inner.  Also use white kohl liner for your eyes on your bottom.|`|HsRRK6mWaa	instead of black on the waterline, use a white kohl pencil. :]|`|Gc08POCYaa	I read that wearing a thin layer of purple-ish eyeliner on your top eyelid helps!

There's no need to try for anything really unusual.  One of the classics -- Chanel No. 5, Arpge, Samsara, Ysatis -- will do just fine.  None of your girl friends will spring for something so costly, so you'll be unique.  All you need is a small spray bottle of their cologne.  Because it's sealed, it will be more stable and you can put it away in a drawer away from other people's sticky fingers.|`|YPAHeUucaa	Can Can by Paris Hilton is my signature scent.

7980boBUaa	Yeah, it's ugly and unnatural.  Screws up your face.  Do not do it, no make up is better than this permanent make up.|`|DB71vJozaa	don't do it. the make-up always ends up a different color and its not good for your face.|`|mWQfdEHvaa	If you go to the right person it can look very good.

rDsKB0uXaa	i would get something cute but i don't do tatts|`|LBHJaqXoaa	Get it on your wrist instead. WAY better location than on your thumb. Go ahead and get an ankh. It's a good symbol and can have lots of meaning, mostly that you've quit for life! Another good thing would be a forget me not, so you can forget you not. That's what I did.|`|JzgzvPxvaa	i think your wrist would be better, you have more options that way. you could do a kanji symbol for strength or concor or something of that sort. something that means something to you. you could honestly go with any design and it would remind you just because of the reason behind getting it.
AZoOruwcaa	you should do your eyes similar to how they are in the pic, but with less eyeliner. try lining with a wet brush and brown eyeshadow to make it smokey. you have really clear skin, do i dont know if you need foundation. but blush is great! it can really make your skin glow! you should get a light pinky blush and sweep it over your cheekbones. and smile! happy people are waaay more attractive than unhappy people.     you should either straighten your hair or make it really curly. and get it cut to around your chin. the colour it is goes well with your skin, you should just get highlights(but only a little bit lighter than your hair, really light ones look fake!) instead of changing your whole hair. it will look much more natural. and you could get cute thin headbands.    for clothes you should find what goes with your skintone. i think a deep green would look really pretty. like maybe a loose-ish dress cinched at your waist with a belt. and boots are great this time of year.    you are beautiful!|`|saIIuPOhaa	As for your hair, I think that the coffee bean color would look great on you! It really suites your skin tone.   & for make-up, I think more of a natural look would work good. Nothing too heavy!|`|qL4CFMHraa	I think you're fine the way you are. Which is why you shouldn't wear so much eye make up. I'd invest in a good blush or bronzer to sweep across your cheeks and save heavy make up for parties or special occasions. Otherwise dressing up isn't as much fun! Mascara is okay for most days. But if it's hot just use an eyelash curler or a clear mascara to give you the shape without the messyness.|`|9zAPrjNcaa	wear abercromcie (not skin tight) & wear eyliner mascar and eyeshadow and lip gloss|`|LC1fQjwGaa	instead of black eyeliner, try blue... you will seem too goth with black. and try sparklie eye shower and maybe curl your hair..  ....  do different stuff everyday.

s095tIYeaa	dye it back ONCE to close to normal color. and grow it out.     i know you already know this, but its the truth. theres no miracle treatment to help your hair become soft and healthy. i went through the same thing.    dont forget to trim and cut off as much as your willing (shorter hair grows faster than longer hair). it will grow out in a couple years (i know but be patient).    to speed up the hair growth process take gelatin  supplements (you can get these at Walgreens and CVS). they will let your hair grow up to twice as fast as normal. take ONE a day.     good luck|`|7N0hbw6Taa	dye it, or just let your hair grow out and cut out the dye|`|mp1MfFMraa	Just let it grow out and use some good conditioner.

laUWZapIaa	It is better to have it done professionally, but if you do want to do it your self make sure the hair dye does not contain any alcohol. I dyed my hair when I was younger a few times and learned the hard way. So be very careful when picking your product. I did hear Essences was a good one. Just make sure it does not have the alcohol like I said because alcohol does not react well with some chemicals and you could wind up with green tinted hair like I did LOL. No it was not funny at the time because I was young and going to school with green tinted hair, but I can finally laugh now. So just be careful or get it done professionally it really doesn't cost that much.|`|N0cmhQYJaa	noooooooooo dont dye it from a box its so bad just wait and save up for a salon but if you have to use clairol

sgo4z3U2aa	Any brand will do. What I make sure to look for while buying fake lashes are.... Ones that are full but not fake looking, not ones that are too long, make sure that they don't look "Halloweenish". Some that are sold as natural lashes look so fake when applied. White glue instead of clear is best. You can see it when you apply it to the lashes and it will dry clear. Individual lashes are better but a lot harder to apply. If you want them for a special occasion and not just to wear daily you can go to MAC makeup counters (at any store like Macy's, Sears, etc...) They have lashes and will apply them for $25. It sounds expensive but the lashes last for 2 to 3 weeks depending on how well you keep them up and how gentle you wash your face. The lash set is $25 and they put them on for free. So if you buy a new set of lashes and glue for 2 weeks you will spend over $25.|`|qOKFuXfLaa	Ardell is a good brand. Very natural looking lashes and very dramatic ones too.

P7L4Vd3Paa	In the winter use a good non-oily moisturizer under your foundation.  I use Oil of Olay non-oily combination skin moisturizer (because I tend to break out).  Then a great foundation that covers is the Revlon Custom Creations foundation.  You can change the color with a dial, so it's great when going from winter to summer.    I buy this stuff at Wal-Mart.  Target has good make up brushes - they have a few designer lines sold exclusively there.|`|WLZFuBVBaa	primer  moisturizer  foundation|`|MOBlSsvjaa	use a makeup primer before you put on your foundation; it'll keep your foundation fresh.    eco-tools makes great makeup brushes that are really affordable.  they're at target and rite aid, as far as i know.|`|qXEQ7ErEaa	i like rimmel stay matt foundation...its not expensive either and it stays on in my oily t zone. if i put a powder over it works even better...and they actually have my color which is amazing. in the summer i do get very dark (arizona lifeguard) so i have two foundations. if their inexpensive im fine with having two      i got a full brush set (like 20 brushes) at costco for around 25$ and their really nice. but yah target makes good cheep ones to|`|RaqmXLbhaa	I buy a powder for the summer that way when my skin starts to shine i can put some powder on and its gone, and powders have really good coverage too I use a maybeline pressed one.   I also use mineral powder foundation now tho as well, it seems to set better when my skin starts getting shiny and then when it gets too shiny i just use a little powder or use the foundation a little more.   another option is blotting papers they are little blue sheets that you dab on the oily parts and they get rid of all the shine so you dont have to put more make-up on...i use those when I can't carry make-up on me a tiny sheet of paper is easier to store somewhere.    oh and brushed are fairy easy to find I get mine at priceline. But if you buy powders or mineral foundations they almost always come with a brush or applicator!|`|1q3MZw9Qaa	use a primer, any type. if thats important your skin looks good while applying foundation get a good one. mac has great ones. thats the one thing id spendd my money on.    if you have dry skin, use a liquid - almay makes a nice one i got mine for 6 dollars and it has ingredientss in it that help prevent acne always a plus. then i suggest setting it with a light powder, uhmm maybelline has nice powders that are light. these steps will set your makeup/foundation and you wont have to worry about your makeup looking oily. setting your foundation is the key.      i got a really good set, it included face brushes a well as eyeshadow brushes. it contained 28 brushes and costed me 35 dollars at costco.

I have seen a lot of places go to strictly *single Use*    You should really do more looking than asking. They can tell you whatever they want. Make sure they are using new gloves...new needles..make sure you ask them to clean/sterilize the area before tattooing.     Yeah not a good idea to call it a "tramp stamp" cause in a way your calling yourself a tramp because your getting one.     All it is...is a tattoo on your lower back.|`|LBHJaqXoaa	Ask them if you can see their autoclave. This is where they sterilize everything they can't throw away. Look around and make sure the shop itself is clean. Ask to see their licensing. Know the laws about where you're from and exercise your right to ask as many questions as you feel necessary. Here's a link to the laws in Alaska. http://tattoojoy.com/tattoo_laws/united_...
tlOTYiCcaa	Well, on most people, yes.  it all depends on your face shape and the thickness of your hair.

atTJPGfwaa	I know that you might feel "manly" when you have a mustache but i find them utterly unattractive . But if you do want to grow it out more , shave it and then it will grow out thicker .|`|t8gWcBaeaa	draw on it wit eye liner XD =D  thaz the only way.  or u just have to b patient until it grows more =D|`|NGHdmQwoaa	dye it the colour of ur hair|`|EPTaL9Ajaa	I will never understand why people find mustaches attractive.   You could try shaving it so it looks thicker when it grows again.|`|BGKjKfINaa	lipstick and pearls|`|93LYbMlQaa	shave it off.   nothing personal, i just dont like facial hair.
Ce2bovaVaa	Baking soda is definitely a good cleanser. It's a light exfoliator, so your skin will be suuuuper smooth afterwards too. I use it all the time.|`|Hj6SFfK7aa	I hear that some people use Dr. Bronner's for a cleanser.

Its age appropriate, and it is winter( so it would be dumb to wear a little dress) I love the print on the top, dressy and it adds some fun but it isnt too loud.

You are going to look very nice.|`|so3SKTUjaa	no not really i would where  someing like a dreae or dreas like
Ce2bovaVaa	Ewwwww yes. Please don't do it, it just looks SO unnatural and gross. You won't be fooling anybody, sweetie. Just go to your professional stylist and ask what color would look best. Personally, I think highlights are so 90's, but if you want to look outdated, go right ahead.|`|z1QTV67raa	YESSS! please dont do it! some girl in highschool i knew did that, and she was known as zebra strips and it followed her for a while|`|swErAbpQaa	not really. it depends on the quality of the job. a professional can make it look real nice. i like the framed look, the blonde frames the face and the rest is minimum. or, do mahogany highlights, that would rock!!! it all in fun right. attitude helps. love it and wear it with confidence. rock it.|`|5b7An8jEaa	ya go for a dark brown maybe even a medium|`|Xg7i420Uaa	i wouldnt..it wont look natural at all!id go with chocolate brown colored highlights.itll be harder to tell you have them..but if your really set on blonde..go the darkest shade of blonde you can get and make sure theyre not thick highlights.|`|bT9SXnYQaa	VERY!  The difference between haircolor and highlights should always be subtle, so whatever color you want, you don't want the other color to be drastically different.|`|1rlFqcVbaa	Oh please don't do that. It looks very bad,   Get a deep brown, or something like that. You generally want to go only 1-2 shades lighter / darker when getting highlights or it looks fake, and can get too tacky.
fLDEHFKJaa	I think your current makeup is good and really works for your face :)  If you do want to explore your options, try a new color or a new product, but always remember, if you dress up your eyes, tone down your lips, and if you dress up your lips, tone down your eyes.... unless you wanna look like a street walker, but I can't see any reason that a beautiful girl like you would want to do that :)    B|`|2XTkSV4daa	Looks cute!! I don't think 14-year-olds should regularly wear too much makeup but on special occasions, why not.|`|Kt84kDvEaa	Beautiful. Maybe a tad bit of bronzer for that "glow"|`|sjSJ0mgoaa	noppe,  make-ups juuuust right :]|`|JRZAdToZaa	yeah i think it's fine. she's cute.|`|9AXKzzAjaa	Great amount, perfect for your face. Blush would even accentuate your cheek bones! Very pretty girl:)|`|2NtjYREkaa	it looks good, not to much make-up. Leave it at that.   NICE EYES!|`|6EpkITxnaa	too much eyeline can make your skin look extremely pale.   try fun colours like purple on your upper lids. works great for me.   also, you can try just a neutral brown eyeliner, so it is not as bold. The dark eyeliner makes eyes look smaller as well, so try to avoid that. Also, i suggest you get some bronzer and maybe some blush to give your skin a more natural looking glow and add more colour. Get a large brush for the bronzer and lightly dust it over your face.   sweep blush onto your cheekbones to define them.  hope this helped :)|`|2gRlqoAQaa	nahh i like it its pretty :)|`|IjMHcECzaa	You should go without, because you're already so pretty.    trust me, you want to save makeup for special occasions to seriously WOW the other people... i've seen this girl (who was pretty) go to the prom with makeup and all the guys were like HOT DAMN.... and she was known to be pretty without.  you dont wanna be a girl who everyone thinks needs makeup to look pretty.|`|nbWO3IANaa	1] liner should be a thin line along lashes only - too much/too thick closes up the eye  2] mascara looks great  3] add a little blush [ face looks pale ],   4] and lip color or gloss [ lips look dry ]  Really pretty girl!!|`|kogfFMgmaa	your barely wearing any makeup hun   ur just wearing a tiny bit of eyeliner.  im 13 and i pile on my eyemakeup
EKoRHgdgaa	Leave it the way it is!  :o)    If you really want to change it I like this look:    http://z.about.com/d/movies/1/0/Y/G/Q/in...|`|652c9c4ac00397e3d3a672481ae4771baa	Red hair dye never looks natural.  I'd go with a blonde. Perhaps a golden, honey blonde.  Black will make you look even more washed out. Personally, I like the pale look...some people don't.|`|YPVLgV3baa	,i love the hair color you have!!but if you wanna dye it I'd say black....well,wait,i take that back...it depends on the way you look so your should explain more or just ask d=firends opinions...lol  just do wat you want but i say black or dye it to a like a really light brown(((:|`|o0G9Z04Aaa	yes you would if ur a girl though|`|tlOTYiCcaa	Black hair=probably will only make you more pale, won't do you any justice, sorryy.    Blonde hair=probably will look very good with your pale skin, seeing as how blond is a light color, so it will look good.    Red hair=wil look better than the black, but not as good as the blond.    and your own, natural color probably looks the best, but if you're looking for a change, go with a bond.   not a platinum blond, but maybe a dirty blond.    good luckk picking a color (:|`|ZaUqhmFaaa	Red would contrast but not go over the top, probably the best choice to compliment fair skin but likely darker eyebrows. If you dye your hair red be very cautious. I know a girl who tried to go dark red and it looks positively purple. She is Not Happy.    If your hair is brown I'm betting your features aren't dark enough to carry off black hair. You'd probably look too pale in contrast and your features would get wiped out.    Nine and a half times out of ten blond is a bad way to go for people who naturally have darker hair. Blond hair dye always ends up looking yellow or sickly or white and strange. Ignoring what you'd look like as a natural blond, I'd say stay away from blond dye -- it's dangerous.    I think your best bet is a medium reddish with a hint of orange.|`|WZeUrVXFaa	try puce... thats a pretty color...|`|9WshfnFvaa	Get a streak of Colbolt blue hair!!!!    It would look sooo awesome!!!|`|uRMVVs3Aaa	i'm gonna have to say.........neon green....lol keep it da same|`|ZwLirOKzaa	go to makeoversolutions.com and u can try different hair colors on yourself if you upload a picture|`|NM0VJVYxaa	Try red like the color Hayley Wiliams has form Twilight.|`|zTEvTWXCaa	its seems to me you would look nice with blonde|`|1b65095a20c992d1520fc7e29282a0fcaa	no keep it da way it already is  if you insist then go with a reddish brown look  black is too plain and unnatural blond always looks fake

SbyCkzpkaa	Supra Skytops & Supra Vaiders run a half a size (.5) bigger then normal....    If you wear a size 10 in a nike dunks then get a size 9.5 for any Supra Shoe...but it you like a little room to work with then get your normal size (10).

fsyz8Qwoaa	hey i wouldn't be too worried about it sound to me like your packin! haha|`|XvvAfDAraa	It doesn't mean you have a small penis. The jeans themself, I find extremely uncomfortable because they rise too far up and feel very uncomfortable in the crotch area. If you plan on wearing skinny jeans, you need to choose one or the other;    1. Comfortable and free.  2. Uncomfortable and restricted.
Xg7i420Uaa	get a chi or a ghd...theyre kind of expensive but theyre deffinately worth it!  the chi is cheaper but the ghd is "god"of straighteners lol it makes your hair sooo soft and it doesnt damage it as bad.  but those are the best two kinds of straighteners..|`|jez0O0bXaa	Remington wet to straight is a good cheaper one $30 or Paul Michell brands are great $100.  Always use a hair protected when hot styling.  Joico Silk Result or PM Super Skinny Serum are great after.|`|lHEg75WEaa	I have the remington wet 2 dry straightener and I LOVE it. Its awesome and really works to dry your hair. Its the 2" wide one too.  You can get it at Walmart, Target...etc|`|AgFJyMjKaa	i have an aquage straightener. it works realllly good.      only 82$|`|GVkGNiTWaa	A Corioliss works really good. You could get one at the mall for over a hundred, or around $50 on eBay.|`|SRBC2Y8eaa	I would recommend a CHI.  I purchased my first chi about 6 years ago, and i swear by it... Because, i have very curly hair and this is the only flat iron that will get the job done and stay that way.  Yes, they can be pricey but it is worth it!    Hope that helps!|`|ANOvR67Gaa	I have a CHI straightener and it works great. It cost a little over $100 though.
w3kkABufaa	I do this:    1) As soon as you get out of the shower part your hair and clip up all your hair but your bangs.    2) Put a smoothing formula in your bangs.    3) Comb out your bangs until they are smooth against your face    4) Blow dry on the lowest setting for your bangs.    5) If you want some fluff in your bangs gently curl under your bangs with a straightener (take the straigtener like you were going to straighten the piee of hair and then curl it in more)    6) Take down the rest of your hair and blow dry and style it.    Hope this helps ! :]|`|2XTkSV4daa	Well you should use a bobby pin to pin them to the side of your face. That looks cute and keeps them down!|`|0frhtuGdaa	i used to have the same problem.  when your straightening them kind of curve the iron inward.  hope this makes scene to you.|`|oheJaFsPaa	blow dry them lightly with a barrel type brush and dont put anything on them that will only make it worse
Ce2bovaVaa	Just print out those pictures and show it to her! That's the best way. But it could be described as very layered with a deep side-part and long bangs. It's a cute style, although it will take a bit of work to make it look that way (unless you have naturally super-straight hair). Print out as many as you want, just make sure it shows off as much of the hair as possible. Good luck! :]|`|qsP6Umcpaa	use the first and last pics and tell her to layer it out and if u want cut it short  and yeah you could show the last one that u added but also take a pic from the back too but dunt cutt higher then the neckline then the hair will just look dull and not so good lower then ur neckline but not higher then ur neckline  remember     good luck|`|QQdOpG2xaa	print it out and show her!|`|whV7euJLaa	its pretty much hayley williams' hair form paramore  print a picture of her out and take it to the hair dressers|`|M3r1s6oYaa	Get the one that doesnt have a number by its side.....it is a 1000 times cooler.|`|5ZRLTz7Jaa	That hair style is so hot.Oh it was also the girl that posed|`|7N0hbw6Taa	2|`|0frhtuGdaa	i like the last one a lot.  if you show the hair dresser the picture im sure you wouldnt need to describe it but i would tell her that i want short layers all around.

7igxiGrAaa	I'm a girl but I'm going to vouch for the guys here....

LOL Had to get THAT outta me system since I seen this question (it reminded me!)  The answer to your question?  I have never smelled AXE, but have heard that it stinks.|`|U3WgkkpHaa	Hhahahahaha well in the commercials, it says that girls like it but im not too fond of the smell either.|`|8Zmt87LOaa	Axe really stinks.

They are funny =)|`|CNDdRFR2aa	Psh so selfish, y do we always have to smell good FOR YOU!!! geez sometimes we wanna smell good for ourselves, and we prefer cigarette smoke smell over flowers.|`|HWzUOrBAaa	i like the smell of it, it smells sexy lol    but not on me lmfao.

I think axe smells horrible too!  Tag is ok, but if you are gonna use any body spray, find a good cologne, like i use Giorgio Armani cologne    I bought some axe phoenix, the day i wore it to school, my friends were kinda disgusted!  It doesn't really do the job it is supposed to do (attract girls)|`|ANBdQcXBaa	i think tag smells manly|`|EKoRHgdgaa	I like the Axe Phoenix, I think it smells pretty good.   :o)|`|L1FqPE3Vaa	I know! It does smell bad and I always get a headache!|`|ZzXSITwmaa	chicken butt|`|5MxYOnzdaa	honestly I think its because the commercials make it seem like chicks love it so they love it to get the chicas to go Bam Chicka Waw Waww|`|u6EJnaVpaa	personally i think its a poor man's cologne|`|Ud8n4Lknaa	lol ur guestion made me laff, i used 2 use axe essence, the one time i did OD with it and i swear it catched everyone's attention when i wuz at school + now i still have this girl who adores my smell|`|qF1M8KQ5aa	OMG! i love the smell of axe!|`|r5Ki4dFIaa	i dont think axe smells that great|`|2K8HxLcWaa	In my opinion (I don't like the spray hardly at all but the deodorant is acceptable) it's a cheap rip of perfume. Who uses Axe? Adults in their mid-life crisis, and teens. Not to mention, male teens have their hormones RAGING ON HIGH so they want girls, and they want them easy, since we're leaving in such a sexist nation. We've all had (guy and girls) that one person we've liked but just didn't understand why they didn't even notice you so guys, and specially guys, identify themselves with this deodorant. It's a sort of subliminal message. The teen associates the body spray with good thoughts of getting a girlfriend, having sucess with women, etc, thus they when they think of girls, they think of axe, and etc. It's more a marketing trick, same reason why they always put a really hot almost naked babe on the most ridiculous adds that has NOTHING to do with getting hotter, Old spice also has a commercial very similar with LL Cool J showing how he was once a panzee dork until he started using old spice, as well as one with htis bulging football player. All this advertising is just to spread out to the idiodic masses. (Oh and no offense to those who actually like it, I was just pointing out there advertising)

It's important to see someone who really knows how to work with curly hair. Most stylists don't get any training with curly hair in beauty school.|`|23ac3d97dbeb83fb0aad313363b41255aa	Being a girl with curly hair I understand what a big deal it is to make things easier! You really dont want layers if your hair is thick because it may become more of a hassle. Make sure he cuts your hair when its in its everyday curls because when its wet its obviously straighter and a good hairstylist will know this already. You need something medium length, a little thined out and you should be good to go!
OaP5Zaaeaa	fix the link....    but here's a hairstyle that i think matches katy perrys bangs.    its a diff color but its awsome :]    http://z.about.com/d/beauty/1/5/d/f/asia...|`|1OEDcz6Raa	http://images.starpulse.com/Photos/Previ...    http://img300.imageshack.us/img300/7249/...|`|tlOTYiCcaa	Well, this hair style sounds like it would suit you.  http://gimps.de/pictures/albums/userpics...  her bangs are about the length yours seem to be at, and they look great with this style.  also, since you have wavy hair, this style would be simple for you to manage.  and if your hair is thick, or thin this hairstyle will work.|`|9Sq22Sneaa	Well I think you should get long layers and side swept bangs and maybe some highlights :) it would be super cute
jgimpZSpaa	ever tried the emo/scene look with black hair and viabrant blue undertones?  thats SAWEEET!  or electric blue with back undertones  hmmm....  a mahagony with bright pink strands in the front  or possible over all light purple with a few black and white strands throughout your hair you can braid together...thats a cool effect|`|f8ed328242d905d1e234676aa09ce11faa	magenta and neon blue|`|I0J6KUuaaa	bright red and dark red and brown :) good luck hun!|`|dCtph2RHaa	blue orange and blonde|`|NM0VJVYxaa	Okay do something [paramorish] do blond and then at the end let it go to pink but don't stop there make your own like do your favorite color at the very end tip!

tbYtlBh6aa	I love this purse! You don't need to be worried about the pink stripe, It makes it more unique. This would probably go with most of the clothes you wear too!|`|FCDLP2pGaa	it will go with a lot of outfits any color in that purse you get will go with a lot of things|`|a1LoDRJiaa	I would go with a color that matches you hair color more because your hair color doesn't change unless you dye it for me i would like the color next to it|`|a8cc321ca3aed60f5acd5dceb2dc1fbdaa	I think it can work the great thing about fashion is that you can play with color. If you love and your not afraid to go outside with the outfit and purse go for it. The pink is fair in color. The neutrals are nice so Got Get It Gurly!!|`|y1gsXEwOaa	uh yah mostly it's all neutral.   the pink is bold but its rlly cute.  and depends at u wear,,   but im guessing u wear skirts and jeans so prbbly.  hehe glad i could be of service :]]|`|Ivgd8sSCaa	I think it will go with most outfits. It is a very neutral pink.|`|Xg7i420Uaa	first of all...its ADORABLE!but since its not entirely pink i think itd be okay..like theres not much and if it was me id still carry it with everything.i say go for it! :]|`|5IYCSFVuaa	Yeah, it should be just fine.  It's a very light shade of pink and will blend in.    Nice choice! :)|`|D5aCSwsdaa	Omg that purse looks so cute!! I think it'll go with most outfits|`|1rlFqcVbaa	It will go well enough.   Or if you are that concerned get the same bag (really cute bag by the way) in the brown tones.
Q1nqxWguaa	Hey. Im 20 and work at Nordstrom Makeup Department. Here's a few tips.    Bronzer- do not overdo bronzer. simply highlight or t-zone. the tzone is the nose area and forehead. when applying bronzer use a thick make up brush.     Eyeshadow-well eyeshadow depends on eye color and mood. have fun with eyeshadow. if you wanna go by the book follow these rules   brown eyes-purple or green eyeshadow  green eyes-yellowish (not Bigbird yellow) but a subtle yellow  black eyes- purple or blue  blue eyes-any color except for blue  if you wanna add some spark to your eyes use a shimmery eyeshadow.     smoky eyes- this look does not work for alot of people, but if you wanna experiment take an eyeliner pencil break of the tip and let it melt in between your fingers then smudge it onto your top eye lids, it gives a perfect smoky effect    liquid eye liner- liquid eye liner is very intimidating. i would say first start out with pencil and then gradually start liqiud eye liner. just outline the tops of your lids NOT the bottoms. this will give your eyes a very edgy look.     blush- blush goes on top of the bronzer. as i said before dont overdo blush or bronzer because youll look like a clown. blush goes on the tzone use a light shade with shimmer     the best brushes i have ever used was the revlon brushes.. but they are pretty pricey   if you want cheaper in price but same quality i would go with bobbi brown brushed they work really well    makeup ideas- i would go to a professional makeup artist its free and you wont have to go through so much experimenting    hair ideas- straighten your hair always ( only when you want it curly) ot goves you a clean cut look 24/7   a nice hair idea is to pinn back bangs, or get side bangs which compliment every face another cute look i like to do is a side pony tail     Hope i helped!!|`|taYFAwlzaa	Thats not embarrasing at all(:!  Practice really helps. Brushes you can buy at Mac. Maybe a little pricey but its worth it! Youtube really helps too(: For liquid its kinda hard. Like i said practice(=|`|zkR4IUa8aa	Check out Jjacks48 on youtube! She has a whole series for basic make-up application and such.     http://www.youtube.com/user/Jjacks48|`|AA10379712	don't be embarrassed im 19 and i still want to know how to apply nice make-up on me..anyways the best place to go is on youtube.com and just search for "how to apply make-up" or how ever you want to say it.they will actually teach you how to put it on and what colors go together its pretty cool...good luck!!|`|JJKgzN1laa	ok your question is not that bad as far as finding the right brushes i suggest if you have one near by go to a makeup Representative at clinique not only will they find the right makeup for you they will explain how to put it on and what to use also its a fun way to get your makeup done and most clinique stands will do your makeup for free and help your knowledge on makeup brushes a little better PLUS you can learn the proper way of putting on that eyeliner and mascara|`|1q3MZw9Qaa	so basically if you know how to do mascarea and eyeliner pencil is enough makeup for a 14 year old, but im not the one to judge.  sooo, im going to go into everything you asked. soooo.    for bronzer, get a tone thats a little darker than your skin - and a warm tone.get a nice angle brush and find your cheek bones and apply it to them. be light with bronzer you dont want to look like you have streaks on your face!     eyeshadow, get a color that you think compliments your eyes. blue go for a nice brown, hazel a nice plum and brown eyes can pull anything off. to apply eyeshadow i find any eyeshadow brush to be great i like the 239 mac brush.    for liquid eyeliner, i like black its just more intense. if you dont like the intense look go for a neutral color. try being very careful and percise you dont want a big black line.    for blush get a nice soft tone thats a nice peachy/pink. for applying it smile and apply it to your apple of your cheeks. if you have a rounder face dont apply it to the apple apply it slightly closer to the edge of your face.sooo for brushes i like the 129 mac brush. its great!
frA6foyRaa	Dont take it out unless you want an infection. maybe put some band aids over it?|`|Ye4qdX4Gaa	Just leave it in, if they tell you to take it out, then tell them that you just got it pierced and your not supposed to take the earring out.|`|KjPfe3mZaa	Ummmm i guess ur skool doesnt allow piercings or somethimg but sticking something thru ur piercing is a bad idea becuz it could get infected especially if u jus got it done.
GpJX3tdEaa	they are headband you can get them any where in the hair accessories section    here is a link to the website of a popular brand:  http://www.scunci.com/product_detail.asp...    hope this helps|`|NnatPbU7aa	It's called a scarf
yhkEyVXLaa	Boy that's a tough one.  I guess I would try once more to approach him but this time be more aggressive about it instead of hopeful that he will just stop and listen.  From the way you make him sound, to me he seems like a jerk for ignoring you.  He sounds like he doesn't even care if he and you are even friends anymore.    Unfortunately because I don't know the full detail about the incident that took place, I can't fully say why he would be mad.  From the way it sounds it seems like a touchy subject.    I know though if you don't try at least once more to heal the situation you will forever be wondering what would have happened, or else you wouldn't ask this question to the mass.  So as I said, give it one more shot and if he chooses to continue on the same path he is on now, forget him because he is obviously not that great of a friend in the first place.  You lose nothing, but he does and that will be his loss not yours.    Well, I wish you the best of luck and hope this helps.|`|l5Q8lq35aa	First off, sorry to hear about that. Guy friends are the worst when  it comes to things like this! :/    Honey, take my word for it: don't try. Once something happens with  a guy, especially drama, they aren't the ones who really want to  deal with that. Guys don't start drama and all of our girl crap...   The whole on and off thing sounds a bit immature, and makes him  feel superior and in charge; like he can make you beg when he  wants. You even wrote,                        'If he's been ignoring me for so long how can I get him  to talk without making him mad, like ideas on how to start?'    Any type of good relationship involves TWO individuals to try and fix things,  not one trying, and the other one dragging on. Let him go. He'll  graduate and will be too busy looking at college girls and in  his studies. It sounds harsh and really mean to tell you like that,  but it will probably happen. That does NOT mean you're not worth it;  he's the problem here. He sounds and stubborn and clearly doesn't  deserve someone as friendly and loyal as you if he will act all  mysterious until the point where it hurts you.    Like The All-American Rejects once sang, "When all you got to keep  is strong, move along, move along, just to make it through, move along. And even when your hope is gone move along, move along  just to make it through!" Cheesey, but totally helpful and TRUE!  I myself find motivation through music. Maybe it can help you  with future problems, too. :) Good luck!|`|KM6PDz5qaa	forget him. theres better people around the world.|`|AA11950233	let me think real hard. hmmmmm    forget about him|`|d5zEYomEaa	I wish I could advise you to talk to him so you'd feel better and hear what you want to hear, but the truth is that he is a jerk and you shouldn't set yourself up to get hurt all over again.    You say "Well, basically I guess he thought I was ignoring him." I disagree. You obviously wanted to talk to him, he is the one who chose initiating the ignoring I'm sorry to say. It's his loss. i bet you try to smile and make yourself approachable when he's around. I would do the opposite. I have a bad feeling for him and don't think he's a good guy who is worth going after. Plus if a guy likes a girl even as just friends, they'll do ANYTHING to get closer to her, including talking to her!!! Good luck.|`|dDgwMinYaa	You should defiantly talk to him, and if he ignores you, keep talking he's actually listening even though he doesn't want you to know.  He wants you to show enough of a want to make it work to do almost anything.|`|8NHCUPyaaa	Write him a letter explaining how you feel. Don't send him an e-mail, write him a hand-written letter.|`|E2EDeCP8aa	if you really care about this person you should talk to them. & if they dont listen or care,than that should let you know what kind of person they are. Just get a hold of them and tell them you need to talk. Then let them know whats on your mind. : ]|`|PiRqWdhQaa	forget him...he is obviously a player.|`|1b65095a20c992d1520fc7e29282a0fcaa	leave him and find a better friend  there are billions of people in the world that wont use you  you just have to look hard :)|`|oyfZR1VSaa	um, yahh i would.  maybe just like crack a joke or something., or kinda bring up and inside joke or funny memory of something that happened with you two.  idk?    thats usually what i do and it seems to help.  cz then its kinda like they have to laugh.    sorry im not really  good at this stuff either, but, hope i helped !    =]|`|uF6bg3p3aa	I think that if he's ignoring you like that, it means that you hurt him in some sort of way. Maybe it's just a misunderstanding on his part. But you need to think about whether or not you want him in your life. Will you have to deal with this again? Will you regret your choice? If you really care about him, you should break the silence and tell him what you're feeling. Just be honest. Either write it in a hand-written letter or put it all out on the table face-to-face. Personally, I would go face-to-face. You can better express your emotions and seeing him might help you make up your mind about what you really want to do.    I hope I helped!  Good luck!|`|0nKeTB0Waa	k first of all you don't have to be the one going to him if hes the one that was acting all bitchy if he wants to act like that then let him you'll probably find a better friend then him i know its hard to loose a friend but you wont miss him so much since hes been a jerk just stay like that its not like your life is over all because of him and he becomes your friend again then don't depend on him to much cause hes not going to be there forever
412735380dd754d3ce81ecc058694db6aa	I just bought MAC minerals foundation 2 days ago, I'm in love with it now, I've used Aubrey Nichole, Maybelline, and another mineral makeup branches, they good, but they cannot be compared to MAC, it is expensive, but worth it... It gives u a super natural look, and full coverage,  on the other side, you should try magnesia milk before applying the make up, it is good FOR EXCESIVE OILY SKIN (that's what models use to keep the make up for hours) It is recommended by professionals, also u should try Clay mask.    You can google to find more about magnesia milk and clay for oily skin. It is good for you to take care of your skin from now, since you are a teenager, so you won't regret years later.    Hope this works.|`|4fde18698ca45acca92968ba1d2f7a8eaa	i used bare mineral for about a year (and actually still use it occasionally). I love how natural it looks and i even noticed a bit a improvement in my skin tone over time. what i didn't like is that it would never last on my skin for more than a few hours, except for when i used a primer (but even then it was hit or miss that it would last all day).     a couple months ago i switched over to MAC's mineral foundation in liquid format. it gives way better coverage and still looks natural. best of all, is that it lasts for most of the day (all day with primer). I definitely prefer MAC, but I will use bare minerals on weekends or days when i want less coverage.|`|lyp6JEcEaa	Neither, being a skin care specialist and makeup artist, I am very picky about what I put on my clienteles skin but especially on my own. I have used Bare Escentuals in the past they say they are natural but theya re not, they use chemical preservatives in their mineral veils. Not to mention the greasies set in after about an hour. Mac uses far worse chemicals. The best I have found to date is faerie organic minerals as they are actually good for your skin and leave you looking like you just left a spa. They really make everyones complexion look good. You can check it out here........http://www.faerieorganic.com|`|Kt84kDvEaa	The MAC mineralize collection is great. It gives full coverage and looks natural as well as making you glow. Use the liquid and powder.     I used to use bare minerals, but the coverage wasn't as good.|`|UyAA91zQaa	if you are going to choose from those two go with bare minerals or do the mac mineralized make up they are both very light but you want to definately stay away from macs studio fix and other pressed or creme foundation the are very heavy and bad for the skin THEY CLOG YOUR PORES!!!! if you didn't have acne problems before you'll more than likely get acne with mac's foundation of course you're skin could take it better and you won't break out but i wouldnt recommend it just out of personal use
Smai6vb4aa	Well I've tried several things myself. Doing braids while hair is damp and sleeping on it. Or wrapping hair in loose bun(s) while hair is damp and sleeping on it. Some people do more buns to get more definition but supposedly Gisele dries her roots then puts it in a low bun and gets her look that way. Um yeah didn't work for me. The only thing that does (but it's a little more time consuming depending on how much wave you want) I wrap my hair around a 1 inch curling iron. Not the whole thing (roots or tips) but just middle to give a little wave and volume. So when you wrap it around the barrel you hair should look like a spiral. Also, I'm sure Jessica is probably wearing some of her hair extensions in that pic!|`|53FA3PSNaa	Honestly I liked the way you had your hair in the picture where you are setting at a table with 3 other girls. It looked much better than that blonds hair.|`|9WshfnFvaa	Get extensions, dye ur hair blonde, use hot rollers, curling irons, or use a straightener to curl ur hair. Get ur hair layered, and get side bangs. SInce ur hair is thick, use a loooot of hairspray. Go on youtube to find some goood demos to style hair.|`|tynO3GEdaa	i would go with a big curling iron; http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/31... , as your hair wont get a tight curl, just keep the heat maybe a tad lower maybe, spray. and ur hair IS NOTT too short!|`|M06c7GU6aa	Your hair isn't thick at at all. It's really fine and thin looking. It actualy looks exactly like mine..but darker, and longer.    Edit: Oicic. It's just really fine then.|`|AA11850523	wear wavy clip on hair extensions like Jessica is|`|ULjZChqmaa	Hot rollers, or in the morning curl it then spray it with hairspray, or shower before you go to bed, pop up where you want curled in curlers, and then just sleep like that (you may or may not want to hairspray with the last one- it all depends on how well your hair usually holds)|`|QQdOpG2xaa	if you have that kind of hair, or that is you, your hair can't get that kind of look, it's way to short
l8yfpyy1aa	Are you anywhere in the northeast or upper midwest?  Go around the neighborhood with a snow shovel and make deals to dig people out.  Charge around $10 an hour, and work conscientiously.  If you know the people, give them your phone number and ask them to call you next time it snows.    You'd be amazed at the huge number of teenagers and the small number of them who are willing to do this tough job.  Many householders are elderly or ailing, and really appreciate reliable help with it.     If you're fortunate enough to live in a milder climate, there's baby sitting, helping with household chores, or yard work.  Here again, make sure you know the people before agreeing to work inside their homes.  Your folks might want to meet them as well.     Note:  The skateboard you like "does not come with trucks or wheels".  Evidently you have to buy those separately.  On the same page as the skateboard they show a package deal with wheels etc.|`|yo30g3pPaa	thats the bottom. the top is covered in griptape    its cute|`|e68a6a673385cf8ff6673cecb42f930aaa	Its cute.    I don't know much about skateboards at all, but I'm pretty sure that's the top; because the bottom would have wheels.    It looks plastic, so I don't know if it would break easily or not.|`|gkxb5OwHaa	hahah the panda sign is the symbol for the brand enjoi  and its alright, Ive seen better though  you could probably find other purple ones too  and no, its the top of the board.  it would depend on how much you already have, but unless you only needed like twenty dollars, you probably couldnt do anything in one weekend. but if its less then that then you could babysit.?|`|2XTkSV4daa	Personally this is not the kind of skateboard I would use (too conflicting images for me...i mean, plaid and flower or something?) but if you like it, you should go ahead!! Do this weekend...um...babysitting...call some people your parents know that have kids and ask them if they would like you to babysit this weekend because "i have free time" they will say yes!|`|d5ywPNYqaa	Yeah, it is great.  Enjoi and anything else made by Dwindle Distribution are pretty legit boards.  My favorite skater, Jerry Hsu, rides for them.    Hope you enjoi(lol) skateboarding.  These 7 years on my board have been the best years of my life.    To the guy talking about size.  Size of the board doesn't really matter at all.  They are all within a few centimeters of size from each other.  I have skated all the way from 7.5-8.5.  I have no problem adjusting to a new size board.  The bigger the board, the more durable it will be though.  That is why I usually skate a 8.5.|`|wvN4HLhLaa	That. Is.So.Hella.AWESOME!  I love it!  Dude get it get it!  You could do yard work for people|`|o3rTWrWPaa	yeah thats cute i love the pandas on enjoi skateboards :)  and thats the bottom the top of the board would have griptape  your probably going to have to buy wheels because thats only the board|`|nnC7FjwXaa	please dont order off the internet.  The size of the board that you are getting matters the most.  This one is a 7.7     Im a 16 y/o guy and I ride a 7.75 NO MATTER WHAT.  Like, I tried riding a 7.5 inch board, It would feel very akward.  I highly suggest going to your local skateshop.  Enjoi is a very trustworthy brand.  But again, if I were you I would go with a 7.5 since your 13 and a girl.    Have fun skateboarding!  Get the ollie down as a tip as that is the basis for all tricks.  It will take a long time to get it.  At first, it will fell like it is litteraly impossible.  Youtube is your best source.  Search  stuff like how to ollie.  Good Luck!|`|JGS287Eeaa	yup.  that's the bottom.  the top's covered in grip tape.    and i love it.  just read the reviews.  everyone said it's a good board.    just love the panda too.|`|SrUGmnALaa	haha.. my friend has the same deck cept in different color  but.. you should realize.. that the bottom will get scuffed up  i use blanks because i could just spray paint it for more original art  I suggest that you dont buy your first board online...  griptaping it yourself is going to be extremely hard the first time around
TIGZp5yzaa	turn those bangs into side-bangs  beautiful!
TfL5pFBOaa	Aubrey Organics  This certified organic company uses no chemicals and no animal testing. They are a completely natural company. Their shampoos include several choices for different hair types. my hair  feels softer and holds more shine when using these products . Some of my  favorite choices are  J.A.Y. and Honeysuckle Rose. There are matching conditioners as well.    for body wash i would try   Desert Essence Organics Body Wash Almond  This leaves your body feeling well moistened and soft|`|NoZAofgOaa	http://bodyandhomeorganics.com/results.p...      im all about organics!         http://www.thirdplanetorganics.com/shamp...        http://www.veganessentials.com/catalog/o...          http://www.vashonorganics.com/CategoryPr...|`|cMksTuRhaa	I love the almond wen, but man is it expensive.  In times like these, I can't afford it anymore.  I found something called "Christophe of Beverly Hills" at my local drug store.  It's about $8 a bottle and contains no laurel sulphites or other bad things.  It works really great.  Other than that, I've tried all of the organic shampoos/conditioners that are available at the health food stores, but I don't feel like they make my long hair shiny, soft, or managable.
LBHJaqXoaa	Yeah, it's not office attire to have visible tattoos. They'd probably freak out if you showed them with a short sleeve shirt. I'd just stick to long sleeves if I got the tattoo.|`|Xg7i420Uaa	depends on the actual company.but most places say as long as it can be covered up they dont care..but run it by your boss first just to make sure! :] good luck!|`|nzPZYgY6aa	i would ask people you work with first.. i dont really no what kind of office you work at .. and if its a serious job. They might care.. im not to sure.|`|i46ta7ygaa	I would definitley ask first. Every company is different with their rules.|`|9pXKZ5udaa	Nope...they wouldnt. But you will.

Either ask for a refund or a new lens|`|kogfFMgmaa	um go to an optometrist's office and ask them to put different lenses in them with the same tint. it should be cheap|`|L1FqPE3Vaa	http://www.thriftyfun.com/tf947057.tip.h...    or you can go on nordstrom or any dept. store website and go on live chat and ask people if they can fix it
ZtPCVAqtaa	Yes someone should help you the usually walk you threw the process of turning on the bed, wearing protective eye ware etc.... but you should always be fully clothed when someone is in the tanning room with you, and there is a lock in the room so no one will walk in on you while your tanning or whatever ....i love to tan... so just lay back and relax the outcome will be great!!
HWkXDSqkaa	Put deodorant all over your body.|`|bwKZ8MWWaa	You need an antipresperent, not deoderant|`|ySpHcjNkaa	I recommend using x3 Gillete Triple protection deodorant, its really effective.|`|lvAEDKPBaa	Make sure it's not just deodorant but also anti-perspirant.      If you still have a problem you need to get a stronger one. I heard there was a deodorant that came in powder form. Apparently it's very good.|`|sgo4z3U2aa	Hey, they have the clinical strength deodorants by Gillette. You should try that. Apply deodorant after shower (if taken at night), in the morning, afternoon and at night if your going out. I know it's a hassle but your deodorant is wearing off too fast. Under Armor shirts are made for sweat. It doesn't show through and absorbs great. They have off brand kinds also. I would maybe try deodorant stick and spray. Put the stick on you pits and then use the spray to cover the surrounding areas. Good Luck|`|N46yWUxJaa	This is gonna be your best friend after u get it. i also have hyperhidrosis (sweating a lot). I use this product called Driclor, and its amazing really freaking amazing! its not that expensive around $30 my country but i'm sure it will be cheaper if u live in the states.And i really stop sweating.i really sweat a lot, man i am glad i found this product.

It helped him a lot!|`|0frhtuGdaa	i saw a story similar to your problem on i think either oprah or trya show.  but yeah you should tell your doctor.  although the girl on the show had a major problem with this, she had to always carry shirts around with her and had to change constantly. she ended up getting botox in her armpits cause it would stop the sweating.|`|JvyfKTJYaa	Reapply deodorant a lot during the day, in the bathroom between classes.  Dark colored shirts usually don't show that you've been sweating. Try clinical strength deodorant, or going to a doctor.|`|dLXKNEmHaa	there are clinical strength deodorants, and perscription. you could also talk to your doctors about it. maybe over production of certian hormones in your sweat glands??? maybe you and your doctor can fine what is acutally causing it. sometimes stress or aniexty  antipresperents might also help. try to carry a stick or whatever you use with you throughout the day.    good luck!!!|`|s2FYeh4Iaa	certaindri. its amazing! trust me, get the AM and PM. but if you shave, then put the PM on  not within 2 hours after shaving. but seriously, it works wonders!|`|mdmjsei3aa	I think you might have a sweating disorder called hyperactive perspiratory syndrome. Instead of wearing deoderant, try to use different spices from your kitchen. Those will help to dry your skin when your sweatng. Also try drinking lots of salt water to disactivate your sweating folicals. Hope that helps!|`|saIIuPOhaa	I used to have the SAME problem. Then I tried Certain Dri. It's honestly amazing. You just put it on before you go to bed, and then the next day you wake up, (i personally put a little bit of deodorant to make my pits smell good), then you go! It lasts throughout the day!|`|SUWvLpaXaa	ur like me i use deodorant in the morning and at night

You listen to a large variety of music, from what's on the top charts, to more underground stuff (Modest Mouse, Kelly Clarkson, et c.) You like musicals, like broadway. lol. You also are a quiet & sweet girl. You're also smart. Not stupid not a genious, just a good student willing to learn.     That's what I think.

Braid your hair when wet, sleep on it. When you get up it should be wavy.|`|BvA2NmiGaa	i have the same problem !  sometimes what i`ll do is take a shower at night, add a lot of mousse to it & scrunch (do not brush your hair after getting out of the shower)  then i put my hair in a wicked messy bun while it`s still wet  & i go to bed like that  in the morning, i take it out & neaten it up a bit, but don`t brush it  i load it with hairspray so that it`s kinda hard, but still natural feeling...  it usually lasts a good 6 hours before it deflates :p|`|2q93vwy2aa	Try curling your hair when its a little dirty, what I mean is let it go a day or two with out washing it with shampoo. Dirty hair is less resistant. Also you might want to spray the hair spray on the curler, rap 1 inch of your hair around and spray again. Finally clip it and spray your whole head. This along works wonders with my straight hair. Good luck!

3mp22h1Qaa	What I do is squeeze out some of the tooth paste on to one of my fingers, then i take another CLEAN finger or Q-Tip, and dip it in the paste and then spot treat my areas (rubbing in only a little so there is still some on top). Usually I will leave it on overnight and wash it off with warm water in the morning. Sometimes though it burns a little and I'lll wash it of after 15 minutes if it hurts the whole time. Hope you are on you way to understanding and clear skin!    Note: I have never really gotten tooth paste on my pillows from doing this, however that may be because the paste is on my face for at least 15 minutes prior to me laying down. This might be enough time for it to dry so it wont get on a pillow, but i do not know because I do try not to tough my face while it is on. Also, I sleep on my back, so that may make a difference.|`|fXUlPjSIaa	It does work for me. I use any kind, Colgate , Crest, blah blah. I just leave it on pimple overnight then in the morning take a washcloth and wipe off with warm water gently. It really does take the redness out.|`|BnfvC6QGaa	Actually toothpaste does help acne ..acne that is only on the surface of your skin that is it doesnt really do anything for deep acne hidden withing your skin yea u just leave it it will dry off your pimple ...whatever u do dont scrath or touch or pop your pimples...this will only make it worse|`|0frhtuGdaa	sorry but im going to tell you that it doesnt work!!!  i saw it on either the ellen or tyra show.  but the lady on the show suggested crushing up aspirin and mixing it with water to make a paste and then apply it on your pimple and them rinse off.|`|cswHfmFdaa	i had a big pimple with white stuff in it in the middle of my forehead. i just put toothpaste on it just a dab enuf to cover it and left it on for like 15 mins it poped my pimple but didnt really make it go away|`|deJFYuHbaa	Its best to use some kind of toothpaste with baking soda or peroxide (whitening) in it b/c this is more effective. I take a q-tip and squeeze some toothpaste onto the q-tip and dab it on the pimple. I do this to all the pimples but don't use the same q-tip over and over. Let it dry so it won't get on your pillow, or sleep on your back. Wash it off in the am when you wash your face with whatever cleanser you use. Also you can do this all day when you have nothing to do or nowhere to go like on the weekends|`|hd8RHyZ4aa	Okay so i know from experience that it works. I don't have acne but it worked on one pimple. What i did was i took a q-tip (cotton swab) and dipped it in the toothpaste. Then applied it to my pimple . Maybe 3-5 minutes later, I washed it off with WARM water. Then I used one of those medicated acne pads to take off any residue. Now i know someone else said to leave it on over night. Tell me how to do that without getting your pillow all toothpastey. I would not recommend sleeping with it on unless there is some other method that I didn't of to keep it from getting toothpaste on your face...Ooh maybe a band aid. Hope this helps!!!!!!

TfL5pFBOaa	There is a brand at khols called Flirt! and it comes from the same company as MAC. It is really good and worth your money.  I would try the Flirt! Cosmetics Act Natural Light & Sheer Foundation     its truly "light & sheer," this is one of those foundations that enhances your own skin rather than covering it up. The liquid texture blends easily with fingertips and is light enough that you won't have to tug at skin to get coverage. I like that it neutralizes red blotchiness but lets my freckles show! It even feels soft on my face and I never experience any drying. The squeezable container with twist-off cap is mess-free and convenient for make-up bags. Most of all, I love the price!  http://flirtcosmetics.com/templates/prod...  *there its is on the website     if your using the foundation above then i don't think you will need  a concealer but you will need a pressed powder here is a good one also from flirt  http://flirtcosmetics.com/templates/prod...  *this is excellent at evening out your skin tone     also just for fun you may want to try out this special addition eyeshadow set it has some really pretty colors to play with   http://flirtcosmetics.com/templates/prod...|`|c3Ep0Ky3aa	The people who work there should be able to assist you with all of that.

Most of the really cheap stuff is but you can find good things at a reasonable price too. I use different kinds but L'oreal normally has good products. As far as asking if there's anything else you should put on, just leave it at that. You don't want to overload your face with make-up.

1nndEKDfaa	Hmm...I'm pretty sure that emo hair is just asian hair except that it MUST be styled on black hair for the emo effect.   Asian hair rule  1: Must use Gatsby =D  Gatsby is a asian brand of hair wax and it has 6 different styling types. The wax I would recommend for you would be Loose Shuffle. It's for long hair and gives the puffed out look.    Here's the video and it shows you how to do it too (briefly): http://www.gatsby.com.my/tv.asp?ch=techn...    Gatsby can usually be found in any asian mall or in any asian cosmetics store. It's alright if you can't find Gatsby hair wax where you are - just settle for the next best brand that has the style you want. Just make sure its for long hair.  Tip 1: Use the wax and make your hair ends sharp and pointy by twisting them together (move your thumb and pointer finger in a pinching motion). Make sure you don't take a huge clump of hair each time, or it will look retarded XP. Make sure you do it right on your bangs especially because if you DO do it right it will look AWESOME >3  Btw, to have emo hair you must first make sure you have long/ short enough bangs. Usually around your eye is where the ideal length for emo bangs to be. For more reference, google pictures of Visual Kei artists - here's a list of bands/artists: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_vis...    Hope I helped. =D|`|MObYVHWnaa	Well first of all emo hair should always be dark brown or black.

933bc8d52e1217aa0f59e9df32d08548aa	Maybe a natural body lotion without so many chemicals in it would work well for you. There's a great selection of natural skincare products here http://dealhippie.com/natural-skincare/|`|soByAneVaa	Two suggestions:    1) Have you tried St. Ives? It's light and fast absorbing. No stickiness at all, as I, too, hate that feeling. You can get it from the local store--Target, the supermarket, K-Mart etc.    2) Have you tried Bath and Body Works' lotions?    For the current items either go into the store or order them on line from their website. http://www.bathandbodyworks.com      For their discontinued items you can check them out here.  http://www.jewelry-city-and-more.com/cat...      Good luck.|`|C0K3Bo2Aaa	Well it's not a lotion but, have you ever tried Avon's skin so soft bath oil. You put it on while in the shower, rinse lightly and air-dry your skin.  Ooh, it's nice :)|`|zt70x6NYaa	I love "OLAY ULTRA MOISTURE IN-SHOWER BODY LOTION WITH SHEA BUTTER".  You put it on in the shower so you don't have to wait around while it dries. I love it!
PuPQF8QIaa	Use a sheer or mineral foundation if you need to use it at all.  a thin line of a soft brown or navy blue eyeliner on the upper lash line and halfway from the outer corner on the lower lash line.    Use blush only if your foundation makes your face looked washed out, I'm fairly pale as well and I have a problem with that.|`|b6mEH2jIaa	NO FOUNDATION!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!... Very bad for skin. I am same age and I would do a light brown or light gold eyeshadow. Black mascara, little bit of eyeliner(half on top and bottom) and some lip gloss. Have fun with it!|`|KhdkXEPGaa	with your youth you do not need make up havent you seen what it does to actors /actresses? make up ages you faster & by the time your 25 you will have craters in your face . stick with eye shadow & lipgloss if you have to have any on at all........also to keep your natural skin always looking new stuff like noxema,masks,&neutragena soap works for the natural beauties|`|6ca682078a28dd28529e2c5e757aeb2baa	Depending on if you have acne or not, I've found that Rimmel mineral mousse and foundation are amazing at looking even. However, they aren't great at hiding inflamed acne.    Since it is winter, you don't really need to wear blush-- the cold will do that for you!! (:    Mascara mostly depends on what you are going for. I use the orange Lashblast mascara by CoverGirl- it thickens and lengthens (:    Other than that, add your favorite clear/sheer lipgloss and you are looking good!    Good luck!|`|JvyfKTJYaa	Just wear a little foundation. And try brown or black eyeliner, with mascara maybe. :)|`|AA10233645	a TINY amount of eyeliner, a mascara in dark brown and tinted moisturizer|`|B2dUw6Zpaa	If you don't need a lot of coverage then I suggest a Tinted Moisturizer.  Cover Girl Aqua Smoothers is a really good one.    This is optional but you can have a powder on top if you want, I have Maybelline Dream Matte Powder & its really good for setting off your foundation & gives you a nice matte finish.    You can apply a little blush/bronzer if you like.  **N.Y.C has a really nice cheap matte bronzer.      For eyes, I'd say just go with mascara & a neutral eye shadow for all over lid color.  **I love Cover Girl & Maybelline mascara.  a few of my favorites:       -CG Lash Blast       -CG Eye Lights       -Maybelline Define-A-Lash Volume       -Maybelline Lash Stiletto    For lips, just a good lip moisturizer [I love love love Burt's Bees]  & a lip gloss.

If you have a hair straightner, then turn the heat down. It's probably from using them too hot. The heat can damage your hair.  Try using a different shampoo and conditioner. You can get some that protect your hair from heat and smell nice. This would solve bth problems!|`|AgFJyMjKaa	the reason is because of your straightener. you may need to buy a new one? or simply just turn down the temperature on it. use special hair products to put in your hair.|`|eZ6dmiAGaa	Maybe you should think about stopping the over blow drying and over straightening your hair. that might help slightly|`|TIGZp5yzaa	Use shampoo two times  rinse and repeat! =)|`|2dd5ead8a0ebfd17db4114329eae540caa	A good smelling oil sheen.|`|SEMYH5Ccaa	i think thats a good idea  (:|`|Zvc3rSKsaa	i say go for it!    got nothin to lose!  :)|`|jez0O0bXaa	Turn down whatever you are using it's too hot & use a protectant.

Ul1OCP8Iaa	A college bar? That sounds pretty cool and fun. I'd say to wear a colored shirt or v-neck sweater (preferably pink, green, blue, or red) and wear a black vest over it, with comfy jeans.

1OEDcz6Raa	thin it anyway. dont listen to your mom lol. she probably thinks that you should be greatful to have thick hair. if you have short hair and its thick, well then it just looks thicker. dont go past shoulder length ... ever.|`|62T9Kozfaa	wtf is wrong with emily ,, who said guys dont like girls with curly hair thats bullcrap   embrace ur curl , thin it (dont know if its bad for u but ive been doing since i was 13|`|fNNvKvpjaa	dont get it short just get layers to thin it out ,and side bangs would look nice|`|ULjZChqmaa	First off, my hair is exactly like it- don't sweat it! You can thin it out, and your Mom most likely disagrees due to the fact that maybe your hair isn't that thick or she thinks you might get it too thin. Trust me- thickness comes back fast! Tell that to your Mom. I like my hair with sidebangs and to my shoulders but if you want to do more than straighten it, try getting it a bit longer. Don't be afraid with your sidebangs- ask for razor use and to get them up to your top eyelid and it'll look shaggy but professional at the same time!|`|tlOTYiCcaa	I have the same hair as you, basically.  It's to my belly button, and use to take me forever to straighten.  Here's what i did:  I got side bangs, and asked my hair stylist to help me make it more thin. She took some special kind of scissors and thinned it out, and it feels so much healthier and less heavy.  I recommend you try it (:  I don't think thinning your hair is bad for it at all, in fact, it might even be healthy.  Also, go for the side bangs, they look amazing on anyone.|`|Smai6vb4aa	Ok I just have to say Emily doesn't know what she is talking about. Plus curls/waves are very much in right now. Thinning it could help.|`|9zAPrjNcaa	well i cant help u because ur hair is thick and guys dont like curls! so get a flat iron|`|qF1M8KQ5aa	me 2 i hate it my mom got her hair chemicaly flat ironed or if u dont want 2 spend that kind of money on hair then get a FLAT IRON!|`|ImQIqEIHaa	ok emily not true at alllllll.  I have thick wavy dark hair too and my boyfriend LOVES it. if a guy doesnt like you because of your hair then hes the wrong guy, plain and simple.  Go for the side bangs! i have them, they look great!  and if its causing you problems then get it thinned. theres nothing wrong with it. youll use less conditioner and youll spend less time in the bathroom every morning which your mom should like! haha.|`|PiRqWdhQaa	America Is A free Country.  do Whatever you Want.
y075ayrKaa	sexy pair of glasses. the price is kinda steep though.|`|oCG2JxsEaa	i like them a lot. but i think they are a lot of money. i think it depends on how much you like it.  hope this helps|`|8McJOHhqaa	Ur paying for the brand hun. So if ur all about brands (like me) then by the Gucci's. If ur just trying to find something that does the job, then buy wot works.|`|2ja54L20aa	so i've only bought prada and gucci spectacles, so i'm going to say def. go for it.    think about it... every time anyone looks at your glasses, they will subconsciously have respect for you (i know it's backwards, but it's basically how it works haha). although 300-4000 isn't that much for a fulll pair of glasses, it's a lot for just the frames. my special edition prada glasses or w/e were only 400 for the lenses and the frames... perhaps you are being overcharged if it is just the frames?|`|n1D90COxaa	Save your money and just get the basic frames. No one cares or will even know the difference, frames are frames..I am sure that are a lot of other things that you would rather spend 3-$ 400.00 on.|`|dOelpoecaa	no, you shouldnt|`|VQzYYYaEaa	The glasses are probably 20 dollars. But you're paying 380 dollars for the "Gucci"s that will be stamped all over them.  I don't think it's worth it.  People use 400 dollars to buy a laptop, or pete's sake, not sunglasses.|`|TfL5pFBOaa	Any good-quality glassses you get are going to cost that much. Whether depending on name brand or not. Personally i think those glasses are a little plain,but if thats what you like then great! But here are some suggestions for some bolder glasses.  http://www.lenscrafters.com/webapp/wcs/s...  *i love these in berry     http://www.lenscrafters.com/webapp/wcs/s...  *these are pretty in rose     http://www.lenscrafters.com/webapp/wcs/s...  *so cute in black     http://www.lenscrafters.com/webapp/wcs/s...  *these are my fave i love them in all colors but black has to be my fave|`|Q7xkVvlBaa	It depends if you want it more for the looks or for your eyesight. If your doing it to look good and you really want it, then get it! Cause if you get the gucci glasses you get good looking and eyesight.|`|2UxpVVd5aa	I would definitely not spend that much money on glasses just get some cheaper pairs at you local eye doctors it will probably be much cheaper and they have some cute ones! Hope I helped a bit!|`|170GrvE0aa	It is definitely not worth paying that much for a pair a designer glasses. The design isn't really special either. You can find some pretty cheap knockoffs too. ; ) Try lookin here: www.optical4less.com
KIPtj6Gpaa	Wow, you have the perfect body measurements!  You should be able to pull off anything.  If you feel better dressing up then do so, but girl..... enjoy your figure.  You are able to wear anything!|`|VQzYYYaEaa	You've got the figure most women would kill to have.    Pick up a seventeen magazine next time you're at the store, they always have sections on finding the right clothes for your body.    Especially the "hourglass" body.|`|8idLIc84aa	Just because you're going to school doesn't mean you have to dress blandly.    Casual skirts and dresses are a nice way to feel dressed up without looking like you're about to go clubbing.  This also works with your preppy style.  To spice that up a little try adding some bright colors.  If you don't want to go full out, go with an accessory.  Bright shoes or a bright skinny belt.  It makes your outfits more interesting.  To keep things from getting too bright add some gray, that always tones things down.    To play with the standard jeans and a top, a really cool jacket or preppy blazer really helps.  Something about a blazer makes people feel nice.  I'm not sure why.  The accessory thing works here too.    Really, I just suggest you trying something new, adding a trend to your everyday look.  Or finding a signature, empire waists, neon colors, belts etc., to make you fell good without leaving your comfort zone.

Ce2bovaVaa	For the first two pictures, try grabbing hair from different spots on your head rather than working in sections. Make sure you still work layer by layer, but grabbing a centimeter or two that aren't exactly next to each other will give you that unorganized but still chic curly look. You could also try curling your hair with a flat iron (look on youtube for instructional vids), or wrapping your hair AROUND your curling iron and leaving out the last inch or two of your hair; it will give you more of that beachy look. And for the second two, release your hair from the curling iron directly into your palm, and then push it up to your scalp and secure with a duck-bill clip or a bobby pin. Do this with each section, and allow them to cool. Not only will this make your curls last longer, but they will be tighter as well. Check youtube for videos, there are always TONS of ideas and suggestions on there. Good luck!|`|Ea3HofRxaa	thats what my hair lookes when curled yu just have to grow ur hair out at a long length then by 1 inch curler  and just curl vertically

MrZiEWcxaa	yep looks pretty good with her. but u know where it would look best>? on u babe :)|`|BSWAkgCvaa	haha that's funny i was looking at that today and thought it was sooo cute.  I was actually looking for a school bag too  haha wow thats so wierd!  So anyways yea i think you  should definetly get it.   it's not too crazy for a school uniform but still really simple and cute|`|tbYtlBh6aa	It looks very nice:)|`|b57swrJxaa	i like it. it reminds me of cotton candy =)
I6zQeNGzaa	Well I happen to think that it would look good. You have the hair for it.   I dont know how the cut is done but it looks like it was buzzed to a certain legnth and then scissors were used . Just take the picture to a proffesional hair salon and maybe someone there will know how to replicate the look for you.|`|TIGZp5yzaa	you are really cute  no, I don't think you should cut your hair|`|0frhtuGdaa	i like how your hair is now|`|fNNvKvpjaa	i dont think that hair style will look right on u,try another thats not so short but not what ur hair is now :]|`|7fGG81bfaa	omg dont change it!|`|7es1yEVmaa	u really shouldn't change it  i love the way ur hair looks rite now|`|sIEwJ1pjaa	No, dont cut your hair like that
1kZenfZzaa	It's always dangerous to use something that you can't spell.|`|Hj6SFfK7aa	It's most definitely dangerous...|`|VihV4Troaa	no not possibly; definitely dangerous.|`|VryeGYNTaa	YES!! are you crazy!!|`|xSk6McMXaa	Yes, it is very dangerous!! there was a lady on the tyra banks show that said it burned really bad. i don't think it will lighten your skin.|`|0Z2aBH0Daa	It is really dangerous. And dumb. But if you want to look like a freak like Mikey Jackson, go ahead!    But seriously, there are over the counter products, Shiseido has tons of whitening creams and is respected, but they are $$. And, you should be careful with these too. There is Kojilac cream too but it's meant for spot treating.    There are Rx products like Hydroquinone, and also Tri-Luma. But they cannot be used long term because it's not safe; they are meant for spot treating. SOOOOO wear a 30 SPF physical sunblock religiously so that your skin doesn't get darker and you will also see some initial benefits of improving your current skin color.    Hope this helped!|`|39dqBmoiaa	looooooooooooooool WTH are you insane looooooooooooool get a whitening cream not bleach|`|oMbkA4kGaa	OMG yes! Well ummm, good luck on figuring out if that's a good idea or not.|`|7b38b61080467ca9ef0e36649d4985cdaa	It wont bleach your skin, just dry it out terribly. If you have poison ivy that is the best way to dry it out. If you want to bleach your skin try skin bleaching cream, it has a lot of other ingredients that are safer.|`|KjPfe3mZaa	Omg yes very dangerous!!!! Dont do that u will regret it! I dnt kno from personal experience but im sure it will burn nd u will probably break out very badly!     U should love urself no matter how dark u r or whatever.

If not, you'll most probably end up looking fake.  I would go with some highlights to change it up.    But some other advice to you.. the more natural the better. You seem to have big eyelids, a lot like me, and colored eye-shadows are best to stay away from. Try softer tones in brown or beige or gold.  While you're at it, bother your mom or friends to pluck your eyebrows :) But if you want to be safe, get them professionally done, and be sure to specify that you don't want them too thin!|`|pnUKuHGMaa	it looks pretty like it is. maybe a darker brown|`|Lmm24jRdaa	http://i8.photobucket.com/albums/a14/Kai...       You could get that color and put some thin strips of highlights: blonde.    Or you could do this:  http://img.metro.co.uk/i/pix/2007/03/loh...     Ok hope I helped, these colors I just thought would go good with you so :)|`|l9I8IbuZaa	black!!!!!|`|CfhcNdIKaa	maybe like a golden brown or if you want to go dark try dark brown.. or you can even go light but it might not take..|`|r2k79COCaa	put thin blonde highlights in, it'll look cute|`|wHaTTUYlaa	it's the way you feel comfortable with, i go with my favorite color- violet- but i think you should never put color in your hair because the way it is is the way it should be, i meant that was our God gave you right? please be content with it but if you really want to, color it rainbow. hope it helps.

Oval heads should  get it shaved bald.|`|223ab248dfedd490d2d3c156d9fbc755aa	If you have an oval shaped face,..not head then it is the perfect shape for any style out there. For square shaped face..not head..a bi-level cut. That is body on top, none on the sides and the lenght and style long enough to see from the front. Like behind your ears, kinda curled at your shoulders so it can be seen when someone views you from the front.|`|70b31770f6128d7827a67ecbbc6531faaa	you could try having straight hair form the top to mid way and having cure form mid way to the end,cause for a square head what people would think is that u have a bigger face than normal so u need some part of ur hair to cover some part of ur face    for ur friend she could have a natural cure done all the way down cause she have a oval face which means the width of her face is short the mainpoint is to make hair hair look wild like a lion which is also the most popular hairstyle nowadays

But then again, what gay man doesn't love a nice stud every now and then? ;-)|`|bafba0d7944b755f0f32244881386872aa	I think the simple hoop works if it is small and silver. But the stud thing is pretty lame. I had one small hoop in each and never went for anything too extravagent. I liked the subtlety of it. Silver is better as the cheaper metal hurts. Is that the opinion you were looking for? Hope that helps.|`|AA10100873	(Not! )  A guy with a single diamond,or gold stud looks good all the time. Stud earrings are appropriate  for any occasion: (work,church,an evening out on the town,and the basketball court). If you decide to go "Stud",then make it a small one!  Most of all:  It's sexy too!.
AA12263545	A good plastic surgeon/dermatologist.  You can get chemical peels, from lesser to greater strength.  Microdermabrasion, derma abrasion, and laser treatments are good as well.    Hydroquinone is good but can be irritating to your skin.  Murad sells a good product for this.    But, see a professional (doctor) and get their opinion on what you need for the best results.    Also, make sure to exfoliate with something like salicylic acid or glycolic acid.  These are wonderful for clogged pores, dull skin, to light scarring.  There are many products from lesser to more dollars sold over the counter.  (Loreal, Olay, Lancome to name a few.)|`|AA12317259	You may think I'm crazy, but trust me it works.   You can do this even if you're a girl. Get some shaving cream, and put it all over your face, get a razor and shave the the areas where the scars are, sounds nuts right? Do this every other day, and as you shave you remove dead skin and exfoliate, and it makes you face baby smooth. Just don't do it on your forehead.|`|AA11371841	I would recommend seeking advice from a dermatologist or a cosmetic surgeon to determine the best course of action.     For very mild scarring you can try a few at home procedures and products to help reduce the appearance of the scars. At home dermabrasion and chemical peels can help diminish some scarring especially if you also use retinol or alpha hydroxyl acid lotions or creams. For sensitive skin you may not want to apply retinol or alpha hydroxyl products right after dermabrasion or peels because it can cause redness and irritation. Other products you can try are scar reducing creams like Mederma or Rosehip seed oil which is said to be great at reducing scar tissue. Aloe Vera juice and gels and lavender oils are also said to work well on reducing scars|`|AA11750295	Aloa vera lotion will do it|`|14bb8ebbaea81484675b761db2403ee7aa	layser , my sis had it done|`|AA12013676	Go to a dermatologist and ask about "derma abrasion".|`|AA11088616	if you can get your hands on it (you need someone who's going tothe Vatican, Italy), there is this one ointment called "Vatican Medicine"...you just dab it on the problem areas, could be any scar (acne or otherwise) it'll help a lot just within a few weeks. Other than that you could consider laser therapy, that would work wonders.|`|AA12280909	honey & lemon|`|AA12029126	Try echinesia mother tincture (a homeopathy drug).

0d3b7082bccdc3a6dd61b034694249f6aa	Use cocoa butter (Palmers is good) and drink atleast 6-8 glasses of water daily.|`|4a6ebd34b4f4455a93c8aa20dd29feecaa	skin care|`|71d4c2c3863a2984642dc132ae50f433aa	Make sure to exfoliate in the shower with a gentle exfoliant. Then make sure to use a moisturizer intended for your skin type- summer skin needs extra moisture. Put your lotion on right after you dry off since your skin is still moisturized from the shower and your pores are open. I would not recommend baby oil for oily skin, and be careful it can make the tub slippery and causes a film on the tub. Make sure to reapply a couple times a day for maximum benefits. Also drinking your 6-8 glasses of water a day will give your whole body an overall better appearance.|`|f20f12d523956f3ba3996bb876c8ec98aa	Your beauty routine should also include a cleanser and an exfolliant in order to slough away dead skin cells.  Leaving Dead skin cells behind creates a dull surface and adds to wrinkles (especially under makeup)  You must always use moisturizers after exfolliants - such as adding Toner with a moisturizer built in.  Then add on a moisturizer with sunscreen in it (I used the old standard Oil of Olay) only because my mother and grandmother have used Oil of Olay and they aged very well, with little wrinkles into their sixties.    At night I apply camellia oil which is found in healthfood stores.  This helps to balance out the skin and add moisture at night while you sleep.  When I say balance out, it helps to even out areas of your skin that may be lighter than others, reducing splotchiness and creating a smooth complexion.  If you have combination skin you may want to smooth more moisturizer on the cheeks and less on the T-zone area.  Camellia oil is a trick I learned from a book written by Shalini Vadhera, "Passport to Beauty" and it works wonders|`|AA12126255	Exfoliate......it is a godsend!!!|`|b75ffce69aefa252b0afd91d25c18721aa	drink a lot of water so ur skin wont get dehydrated(dried out)|`|AA11307823	Take Vitamin E orally once a day and use aloe plant oil every night|`|dfe0047dbae93a303100457a5f5a66d9aa	A massage is the best way to make your skin smooth.
