20090220170614AAVBcGy	Cars & Transportation;Other - Cars & Transportation	Is aftermarket exhaust illegal in CA?	Ok, so i was driving my dad's supra STOCK except for the HKS dragger exhaust... and i got a ticket today. The officer accused me that my exhaust was unusual and too loud. I agree that it looks unusual...but I REALLY doubt his accusations about it being loud, becuase it is as quiet as a stock muffler. The only thing is that my muffler looks like a big fart can.      He then also said he is going to write me for a bent up license plate. (Which is even isnt...it is just hanging off from an angle.)      So i kindly asked him, i asked if he had a decibel reader that checks noise. He stated, "No i dont"...then i procedded to ask, how would he see why my exhaust was loud?       and he instantly raged at me! THen he said, "DO you want to get into an arguement with me? I am going to write you a ticket too then!" and he takes off to his patrol car.. i gently apologized when he returned, and said i didn't intend to argue. I decide to take the ticket with no hessitation.         -So could he have written me a ticket as well? What do i do with my fix ticket? i dont have the stock exhaust anymore....

20060720201656AAgr4nw	Cars & Transportation;Other - Cars & Transportation	Why are gas prices priced the way they are (such as $3.25 9/10)?	Did you ever notice that the gas price is not $3.25 (or whatever it is where you are)...but it's $3.25 and 9/10, which means it's really $3.26, since 9/10 is "nine-tenths of a penny."  Why do they price it that way?  Is it just to trick us into thinking it's cheaper, like how things are priced $9.99 when they should just price it at $10, but $9.99 "sounds" cheaper to us?  What do you think??

Te gustaria tener TIPS PARA EL LLENADO DE GASOLINA?	a qui  van             Hola, Algunos tips para que ahorren un poco en gasolina,            No sé cuanto estén pagando por su gasolina, pero aquí en California   también está cara, hasta $3.50 por galón. Mi área de trabajo es el   petróleo,  por ya más de 31 a?os, así que aquí les van es algunas   ideas para sacar más         valor por su dinero en cada galón.            Aquí en la compa?ía de tubería Kinder Morgan Pipeline donde trabajo   en San José, CA entregamos cerca de 4 millones de galones en un   período de 24 horas por la tubería. Un día es diesel al día   siguiente combustible de jet, y gasolina regulares y Premium.   Tenemos 34- tanques de almacenamiento aquí con         una capacidad total de 16.800.000 galones.

Recuerda que   todas las         gasolineras tienen sus tanques de almacenaje enterrados bajo tierra.   Entre más fría esté la tierra más densa estará la gasolina,

20080219123431AANTmYA	Cars & Transportation;Maintenance & Repairs	Painting tips for car doors?	My car was hit on passenger side doors. Yes there is a significant dent on the rear door and a medium dent on the front door. The car is 10 year old. The insurance company found me at fault for some reason but paid me some 1400 dollars to get the thing fixed.       I personally believe that only a good paint job (since I am not too keen on building a good deal to sell the car) should make the car look much much better and would make me feel better and I can then forget about the dents on the piece of metal.       I am looking for tips. I am looking to do it at home (just as an experiment). It is a white 1998 Honda Civic. Any suggestions/websites that describe it and links to shops that sell paints/spray cans for cheap? or do we get a car paint kit (do it at home kind) somewhere? Please help me on this one. Thank you.

20090203081645AAoVFOL	Cars & Transportation;Commuting	My hubby felt dizzy in the PATH train this morning commuting to work. I am so worried. Please help i'll go mad?	Ok here's what happened. We ate dinner at 9.30 pm yesterday and he got up as usual at 7.30 to go to work. I dont know if you know this but the PATH trains stations are unbelievably hot. He did not have breakfast, he usually does not. He eats breakfast inside the office cafeteria. He says he wore his muffler, heavy jacket everything and did not get a place to sit in the train and started feeling dizzy. After this a person gave up his seat for him.      I love him so much and am so so tense today. I am thinking about the worst possible situations.Please help me. Could it be something very bad..should I ask him to go for a whole body check up?

20071226153331AAJvp5f	Cars & Transportation;Buying & Selling	Que es mejor para un Taxi un Tsuru o un Atos?	Bueno yo despues de mucho investigar y todo eh concluido que estos 2 son lo mejor de lo mejor, pero me he quedado estancado al tratar de elegir uno.   Diria que el tsuru es el mejor ya que es un nissan y es un tsuru, eso significa economico en todo sentido, piezas faciles de encontrar, durable y con una mecanica exageradamente sencilla y por eso cualquier mecanico puede meterle mano, ademas otra ventaja es que tiene una cajuela mucho mas grande que el atos, y eso es bueno para un taxi, ademas de que es amplio por dentro.   Ahora el Atos, bueno la pricipal cosa que me atrae es que es mas de 12mil pesos mas barato, su motor y su bajo peso lo hacen mas economico en combustible que el tsuru, ademas como va a ser direccion mcanica, pues sera mas facil girar con este, su tama?a interior no sera muy bueno, pero si lo es su exterior, ademas de los asiento trasero son altos y de facil acceso y decenso (no se si los de adelante sean igual).

So my car was hit when it was parked, I faxed the estimates to the insurance company and got a call later on saying they  were going to cut me a check. Then today, the guy that hit my car came to my job and asked if I had already faxed the information, I said yes, so he asked if he could have a copy of the estimate and if he could take pictures of my car.    Ok, I'm confused. Is this what usually happens??
