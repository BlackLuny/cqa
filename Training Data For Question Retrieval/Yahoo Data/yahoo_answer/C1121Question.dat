20090222163508AAlHRCL	Beauty & Style;Other - Beauty & Style	Question to all girls who think they've got a Big Butt in comparision to the rest of their body?	Hey, I know this question sounds a bit silly but hear me out..!     This is something that i've heard quite a few times from other girls whose booty is quite big in comparison to the size of the rest of their bodies.     A lot of them say that having a bubble butt shape makes it feel more comfy and soft when they sit becuase they have more cushion to sit on!    I didn't think this was true before, but now I've been working out more and eating more than I used to, so my butt is a lot more bubbly, sexy and curvy shaped . And now I notice when I sit, it does feel quite cushy and soft. Sort of like better cushioning lol!!    So my question is to anyone who also has a big butt, does your butt also feel quite cushioned and comfortable to sit on? Do you also think there's some truth to this?!!!   Serious answers only lol

"I'm 13 and I want to be a designer" or "How can I break into the fashion industry". Most of those questions were met with "You're too young" or "It's too hard". No one could give a real answer. If you like fashion design and really want to be a fashion designer, try checking out  http://www.designerbloc.com/  It's a website dedicated to aspiring fashion designers (of any age) so they can display their designs, receive feedback, and meet other fashion designers. This way everyone has a chance to show their talent. I know this wasn't really a question, but I was tired of seeing talented young people getting their dreams crushed before they got a fair shot. Maybe this question will be the answer to many questions.

I don't have acne, just an occasional pimple but that's rare and they are pretty small.    My problem is dry skin. I have eczema so in the winter my hands dry out and sometimes crack/bleed a little. They are very course. The area of my arm opposite my elbow also get very dry sometimes. I live in Michigan, and the cold weather aggravates this.       I can deal with the dry hands. However, my face is very dry too. I don't know whether or not this is related to the eczema. Mainly around my nose, the skin peels/flakes. My cheeks and occasionally my forehead feel dry too, but it's mainly just around the nose. How can I moisturize my face or stop the flaking?       Thanks!

20090222232343AAP4mSA	Beauty & Style;Skin & Body;Other - Skin & Body	Typical photos of monroe or angelbite scarring?	I'm debating whether or not I want to get angelbites. My main concern is the scarring that will occur after I take them out. I know it's generally inevitable, and I'm fine with that, to a certain extent. I'd probably leave them in for a year or two. So, I was wondering if anyone had some photos of the scarring that would result in a well cared for monroe or angelbite piercing after it was removed.      I currently have spiderbites on the right side of my lip, combined into snakebites. I'll probably be taking out the single ring on the left if I switched to angelbites, leaving only the spiderbites on the bottom lip. Opinions?       http://c3.ac-images.myspacecdn.com/image...

There's a lot of pigs out there who'll answer your ad if you're not careful.
20060709094230AAdxsp3	Beauty & Style;Hair	How to do the Hair Hump without the weave? I've got your answer!?	Without the Weave:What You Need: Black Elastic Bands, Hairspray, Gel, Bobby Pins, Clip, Comb, Soft Bristle Brush   Divide the front of your hair from the back. This hair should come over one ear to the other. Clip away the back of your hair. Divide the front section into one big section in the front and 2 small ones on the side.  Clip away the two small sections.  Take the bigger sectionand using an elastic band tie it into a ponytail. Spray the part of the ponytail towards your eyes. Pouf up the section, by pushing up the ponytail until you get a hump.Secure this with bobby pins in an X shape and then put one bobby pin through the middle of the X, so the hump doesn't slump, then respray it with hairspray.  Now work with the two smaller sections. Brush it out with your comb to take away any tangles. Now with the soft bristle brush push them back on the sides. Secure it with bobby pins where you have the X and smooth it over with gel. You can put it up or down for a casual or formal look

I do have gym class, and that makes it alot worse, but even before I started my gym class, it still smeared/ran.

20070218153548AAaSdSS	Beauty & Style;Hair	How do I keep my hair straight and flat?	I am a guy with hair down to the bottom of my ears, and bangs just below my eyebrows.  My hair seems to get curly wherever it feels like, no matter what I do, I have learned to live with it by taking Sunsilk Straightening shampoo and conditioner, then putting in the 24/7 straightening cream, and it helps slightly, and I can live with the curly-ness.  My hair isn't curly really at all, and it just goes in and out in places I really don't like.      I really hate my hair being poofy at all, what I do is once its sort of dry but still damp, I put my hoody on and pull down for about 20 minutes and it appears to be fine like that, but this is a daily routine and I am sick of it.  I don't want to try anything like going to a salon or ironing my hair, I want it to look natural, a little wavy is fine with me, but I just want practical solutions.      Any advice?

20070406071541AAz7IiC	Beauty & Style;Fashion & Accessories	Would you pay $250.00 for a custom made linen blazer, cut from a drafted patter designed for you body only.?	My girlfriend recently had a co-worker, who asked her if I could make a linen blazer similiar to a Tommy Hilfiger blazer he saw in a magazine and how much would it cost. I told her it would be $250.00 and that's cheaper than what Tommy wanted. Besides you will have a custom made drafted pattern designed just for your body only and if you ever decided you would need a suit or any type of jacket I have a custom made pattern already to asure that you get the fit your looking for each and everytime. So she came back the next day and said the co-worker thought the price was too high and she felt the same way too. She said since I'am a nobody no one would pay that much money and she too would go to any department store and buy the Tommy blazer and just have someone alter it for her. So do you think I'am chargeing to much for the blazer, It is custom fitted and not altered. I take what I do very serious and I'am not satisfied until my customer is and I also leave the design process open.

Come?a a luta e os caras come?avam a se cacetear, dar com a escada na cabe?a um do outro entre outros sinais da carinho. Só que na hora de subir e pegar o cintur?o, toda a energia era perdida e os caras ficavam dormindo nos degraus. Ent?o, quando um pisava no último degrau, a bela adormecida entrava em um berseker momentaneo e derrubava o adversário de tudo quanto é jeito, com tapa nos zovido, sentando a bica derrubando a escada e towww ! Lá ia pe?o no ch?o para come?ar o frison de quem irá chegar no topo primeiro :P      Até parece que eles estavam t?o mortos a ponto de n?o conseguir subir…      O pior é que tudo que isso n?o estraga o programa, ele continua divertido do mesmo jeito !
