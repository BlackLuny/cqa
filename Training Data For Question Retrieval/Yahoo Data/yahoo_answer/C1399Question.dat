20090306220022AAFTSZ1	Social Science;Psychology	In-Home Counselor Job?  Should I?	I am thinking about taking a job as an In-home Counselor.  They tell me I will me working with people who have lost their children to social services or are in danger of losing there kids to social services.  My job would be to work with them in the capacity they need (i.e. drug rehab, anger management, AA).  On one hand I like the fact I will have the direct opportunity to help people.  On the other hand I know who I will be working with.  At its worst it will be sexual abuser and child abuser.  They will have either served time or were not able to be prosecuted for it.  I have no issue getting my hands dirty when I can make a difference, but will have trouble if I have to watch a bad thing happen to a child for what ever reason.  Should I take this job?  Any one in social services with experience in this avenue?

Here is a very strange and disturbing BBC UK video of some anti-feminist, misogynist, homophobic, right wing fundamentalist Christian men attacking parliament in the UK and storming Prime Minister's Question time - which was televised.      Do you think their underhanded tactics should have been allowed and do you think they should have been arrested? Why are these misogynist homophobic trolls allowed to do this?

20090306225158AAFuamT	Social Science;Psychology	What does it mean to dream about intense cuddling and sometimes kissing a made up guy character?	In my dreams i often find myself cuddling with some guy. The feeling is like a very concentrated version of a crush. I can't even describe it because I only feel it in non-reality. That barely makes sense. It's like pure quenching of thirst. A very potent love, I entangle with these various characters. No intercourse - nothing more than kissing and entangling. It's so nice and when I wake up i find myself missing these made up characters for a split second until i realize they were only figments of my imagination.

I am wondering... how come most of the guys who are funny, cool and have a lot of friends of the opposite sex are good looking, good posture and also natural at sports they have good form and learns REALLY quick.   While the losers tend to be boring, uncool little friends of the same and opposite sex, bad looking, bad posture and also sucks at sports.   So when people are born is it only a coincidence that they end up beautiful or handsome depending on how they act or the environment they are exposed to when they are young or is it just a matter of chance

20090307030846AA93nQB	Social Science;Psychology	Obsessive Compulsive Disorder?	My psychologist believes I have obsessive compulsive dissorder in the form of fearing homosexuality. When I was about 8 my dad said that having three sisters would turn me gay and that's stuck with me.      I remember when I was young whenever my sisters said "that guy is hot" i would get anxious because I was scared I would agree with them. I've been fine for the last few years because I had a girlfriend who I was in love with. But after a messy break up and a few hook ups to move on I woke up one day and something had clicked on that was saying "**** am i gay"      From there it's become much more realistic, I started putting thoughts about guys into my head to see if I liked them and basically the more I did this the more comfortable I became with it.      I have to keep fighting these thoughts because gay is not me, before this the gayest thought i have had was 'that bloke is good looking' or 'that guy has a good body' but nothing more      I've had sexual relations with a girl, never had thoughts about guys, and have always been attracted to girls.. so what happened?      Now i look at every guy and think something gay, and I know it has become obsession.      But I don't know how to go about this because if i'm gay i can't just deny it.      Furthermore as far as the OCD goes, if thoughts about guys come into my head i often say certain things over and over such as 'you're not gay' or 'don't get aroused' and sometimes i pray as well.         What do I do?   Am I gay?

20090307015147AA7mEMo	Social Science;Psychology	Is it possible to be cured of BPD?	I am something of a hermit, but this is partially because I am introverted and enjoy solitude. But honestly I lack social skills somewhat. I am more like Aspberger's but with empathy and eye contact.   I just looked at the DSM definition of BPD and I do not match any of the criteria there. Much less the five required.   When I was younger I set out to "beat" the illness by taking on the symptoms altogether.   I will say I am still a little "thin-skinned" and feel left out easily of the online groups I belong to. But in my defense they do tend to be cliques. I am particularly sensitive to clique-ish behavior.      Tell me the truth. Have I overcome the BPD? Or if I were to become more socially active would it come back? I do not plan on doing that however.

20090307044532AAUeNF0	Social Science;Psychology	I feel like beating her *** to a pulp, but i can't do that, what should I do ?	OK I have just moved back home from Chicago and couldn't find and apartment for me and my dogs before I moved back so I was living with my dad and brother until I could find a place. I am 24 years old and haven't lived at home since I was 16. So things weren't the greatest there. my brother also has a very bad anger problem, that he has had all his life and is hard to control. So him and I got in a fight for stupid stuff, well we hit each other and then he ran outside and busted in my car window to my BRAND new car. I was pissed and took my things and my dogs and went to my friends house. We sat for a while deciding if I should call the police. My brother called later and told me he would pay for my car, just don't turn him in to the police. So SHE convinced me it was a good idea to call and make a report but say it was broken into over night and I found it that way when I woke up so I could get my insurance to pay for it & just have my brother pay the deductable. I also wasn't completely convinced I would see any money from him, and I didn't have it to pay out of pocket. Well to sum it up, my deductable was $400 which Is WAY more then what it would cost to just go to the junk yard and get a glass and have my dad put it in. So i cancelled my insurance claim and my brother bought me a window. Through all of this I was staying with that girl, just to get away from my family. I only stayed with her about 2 1/2 weeks. In that time period one of her windows broke and she said I did it, when I didn't and told me I owed her $400 to get it fixed. WOW , I didn't even break the window and it was in HER room on the other side of the house. So I told her I am NOT giving her any money to fix that. NOW HERES WHERE IM PISSED!!!! She called the county police dept. and tried to turn me in for a false police report and insurance fraud. OMG... I have NOTHING on my record and she is just being trif. cause thats the way she is. I am soooo mad that I want to beat her face in and anyone who knows me knows i am not a violent person... except for my brother sister fights..lol, but I am not confertational at all, and my blood is boiling right now. I went to the police station and they said they know her and know her record and know she is crazy and I am fine, but I can't help but to still be sooo ******* pissed that i want to know how somone like her sleeeps at night... What would you do ??

20090307042332AA5jQR1	Social Science;Psychology	Is the life i want, actually the life i had?	back when i was only 6 or 7 i had a dream, in that dream i was a somewhat tall man and i was wearing a military outfit and was armed with a thompson but somebody had hit over the back of my head and when i came to i was laying on the ground my hands were bound my weapon was gone and it was very dark i could see almost nothing and i could hear somebody speaking in german very quietly, i was very calm at that point and all i could think was "if i let them know i am awake they will kille me" so i laid there completely silent not moving not speaking and breathing so carefully that i could not even hear myself, the two men all of a sudden were standing over top of me and were wearing german outfits and had realized i was awake, they started speaking to me in german and i had no clue what they were saying, they were getting frustrated because i was not responding to them so they lifted me up and threw me in the trunk of a car and they slammed the trunk closed and at that point i woke up      i am starting to believe in reincarnation now, and i honestly am starting to believe i was killed in ww2, i am so ******* confused about it though, i have had a couple other dreams like it since then but that is the one that keeps coming back to me, i have flashbacks to that dream very often and it just sends chills up my spine every time, and the reason it ***** with me so bad is because in this life my worst fears are small spaces(the trunk) the dark and having no control over a situation like if my hands get cuffed or tied i get really anxious and severely angry all of a sudden and i start to hyperventilate , but the reason i am as worried about this as i am right at THIS moment and asking this question now is because i always liked the idea of fighting for the country and i am pretty handy with a rifle , i have been debating on joining the army and in my opinion being a sniper for the United States would be a very high honor and i have thought that for a long time      basically what im asking is      is it possible that these really ARE flashbacks to a date long ago? And is it possible that it actually was me in the trunk of that car??      i know that nobody here can answer this question with it being 100% sure i am simply posting this as a means of venting, or just more like thinking aloud, but feedback would be appreciated

Last night I had a very strange dream that I was driving my car and died. I've always been curious of what will happen when I die and in my dream everything turned to a purple black color and I knew I was dying as it was happening. The stranger part is what happened after that, wherever I was wasn't what you would imagine as a Heaven or Hell. I remember knowing in my dream that I was truly dead and what was happening wasn't a dream. I knew I didn't belong there.      When I woke up in the morning I was so confused. I started to think about things and wondered if I really had died. I take anti-anxiety pills and they make me somewhat forgetful so that day I took more that what I was supposed to because I couldn't remember when I last took them.      The last part, and the strangest part of it all to me, was that when I went to start my car in the morning it wouldn't work. The battery was dead.       Please don't make fun, I'm completely honest about this.    I'm confused by this and looking for input.

20090307030825AAyEb6n	Social Science;Psychology	Obsessive Compulsive Disorder?	My psychologist believes I have obsessive compulsive dissorder in the form of fearing homosexuality. When I was about 8 my dad said that having three sisters would turn me gay and that's stuck with me.      I remember when I was young whenever my sisters said "that guy is hot" i would get anxious because I was scared I would agree with them. I've been fine for the last few years because I had a girlfriend who I was in love with. But after a messy break up and a few hook ups to move on I woke up one day and something had clicked on that was saying "**** am i gay"      From there it's become much more realistic, I started putting thoughts about guys into my head to see if I liked them and basically the more I did this the more comfortable I became with it.      I have to keep fighting these thoughts because gay is not me, before this the gayest thought i have had was 'that bloke is good looking' or 'that guy has a good body' but nothing more      I've had sexual relations with a girl, never had thoughts about guys, and have always been attracted to girls.. so what happened?      Now i look at every guy and think something gay, and I know it has become obsession.      But I don't know how to go about this because if i'm gay i can't just deny it.      Furthermore as far as the OCD goes, if thoughts about guys come into my head i often say certain things over and over such as 'you're not gay' or 'don't get aroused' and sometimes i pray as well.         What do I do?   Am I gay?

20090307061451AA5HIw7	Social Science;Psychology	My mother is obsessive about my weight. What should I do?	I know this is long, you don't have to read the whole thing but I appeciate any advice you give. Hi I'm 19 and I am 5"11 tall. I've always had my baby fat, and I'm trying to loose it. I'm not gigantic or anything, I just have a spare tire that doesn't want to go away. The problem is my mother is very insensitive,  she forces me to eat foods that I don't like, and says hurtful things and mocks me and my weight. For example, this morning I went into the kitchen to make breakfast and she said "I noticed that you spend alot of time in the kitchen, are you interested in the culinaryy arts?" I said no and she snapped back "well you spend alot of time in the kitchen and If you don't want to be steryotyped as a big woman that loves to cook and eat then I suggest that you do something else with your life." Which is so hypocritical because she always calls me in the kitchen to cook this and cook that, stir this, fry this and bake that. She sometimes asks me to help her bake three pies at a time and they sit around the house forever beause who eats that much pie?! This was totally uncalled for, I went in the kitchen to get breakfast like a normal person. I go there for breakfast, lunch and dinner. and during lunchtime if I have a sandwhich with two pieces of bread she looks at me like im eating a baby leg and grabs it and puts everything on one piece of bread, and I have to eat that for lunch whille they both eat freaking heroes.  She sometimes even makes something that has nothing to do with my weight about my weight. like she asked me what kinds of fruits do or don't I like, and I said I don't like apples. She mocked me and said, well you better learn how to start eating them or your going to look like this for the rest of your life. I actually like eating healthy. And there are fruits and veggies that I dont like. just because they are healthy doesnt mean I should force myself to eat them. Because there are alot of healthy foods that I love. I told her this and she said that if i continue to think that way,I will be big for the rest of my life. My sister is very skinny and my mom glows when she sees her, slapping her but and proudly saying "hey skinny minny!' my sister eats all the food in the house (litterally) and when my mom finds out she laughs and goes oh I guess you were hungry! heh he he. But if I eat the last of the cereal in the box, its oh you just ate what you wanted to didnt you?  And to make it even worse, my  sister has always been skinny, but recently Ive notice that she has been getting skinnier. She told me that she's taking diet pills and laughed heh he . So I told my mom because I was worried about her health she seemed to be acting diffrently and my mom didnt say or do anything. wtf? Sometimes I think i should be popping pills just so she will glow when I walk by instead of looking at me like i am a piece of dog poo. Sometimes she even makes me replace something if I finish it.  I get the feeling that she wants me to loose weight not to get healthy, but because she is ashamed of me. Yet she brings ice cream and brownies, and chips and unhelaty stuff that none of us should be eating on a regulr basis, and when I tell her to stop she goes you are right, you are right. and does it again. It actually makes me feel even more insecure about my weight, thus making it even harder for me. I really just want to loose weight to be healthy, so I sometimes buy my own healthy food and tell everyone that I'm on a diet, and not to bring unhealthy. I honestly think that she is contributing to my weight gain. I love eating healthy, and If It were my choice I would have all healthy foods. and i would loose weight because I wouldnt have my mother constantly telling me that im fat and stressing me and causing me to eat the junk she brings into the house.  and I bet you I'd be a skinny minny. I kid you not. When I go to the doctor for a checkup, the doctor doesnt bring up my weight, my mother does. She says oh im so concerned are there any classes she can take? and the doctors always look at her strangely and then suggest something. it almost like they can see that she is obsessive about my weight.  The worst part is when I tell her how I feel and sometimes i start crying, she says "dont look at me like that, stop crying." this is your problem. Im not the one who has to look at this (she grabs my spare tire and shakes me in the mirror) Im not the one who has trouble buying clothes because I can't fit into them." Then she sometimes doesnt buy food for the house for weeks at a time and we have to struggle to make a meal. we are not poor or anthing, she has lots of money, but I think she does this on purpose so that I will starve and loose weight. Then when I say im hungry she says"you are not hungry. eat a piece of fruit" i just feel like crap. if we are eating with a group of people she looks at my plate then looks at me and rolls her eyes in disgust. Once we went to eat and she told me to orderr whatever I wanted so
20090307071111AAgaHkD	Social Science;Gender & Women's Studies	I need a replacement word for "feminist" -- can you help?	I used to call myself a feminist, despite being male.  I believe in such things as equal pay for equal work, abortion rights, gender equality, etc.  In some ways, I even believe women are superior to men -- primarily because the X chromosome has more information on it than the tiny Y chromosome, so women are "superior" in the sense that they start life with more genetic material to work with.  Men also start virtually all of the wars, commit most of the violent crimes, etc.  I do not like men, as a general rule.       The problem is that the word "feminist" has become tainted with the stain of Marxism, due to the Marxist-feminists' work.  Feminists who say things such as "All sex is rape" don't help, either.      An even bigger problem is the treatment of my fiancee I have seen from some who call themselves feminists, or others influenced by feminism.  She wants to be a housewife, and raise our children (they're not here yet, nor on the way), and we want to homeschool them.  I would have thought that feminists would support a woman's right to make her own decisions, and those decisions are hers -- I did not impose them on her.  However, the reaction has not been like that.  Instead, she is harshly criticized with Marx-influenced feminist rants -- particularly about the housewife thing.  Should that not be her choice to make?      Since the words "feminist" and "feminism" have been ruined for my by these circumstances, I would like a replacement that fits my beliefs as I have described them.  Any suggestions?

20090307065921AA1WxO2	Social Science;Psychology	Do you think i have some form of social phobia?	ive convinced myself that i have some mild case of social phobia, but i want others opinions.       whenever i have a one on one conversation with someone im usually too busy thinking if i should look them in the eyes, if ive been staring at them too long, what i should say next, what theyre gonna think of what i say next, and in the end i usually dont even pay attention to what they say because im too busy worrying. i get embarassed really easily when talking to someone. all they have to do is give me a look that says 'why would you say that?' and my face will turn red. i get even more embarassed if someone points out that my face turned red.      unless my friends are around, i have so much trouble meeting new people. if the new person isnt really outgoing and cant start a conversation either, i wont know what to say, and i end up looking around and it gets really awkward. im also afraid they can tell im nervous. im just so afraid if i be myself they wont like me.       i fear going and hanging out with one person ive never hung out with alone before. im just so afraid of awkward silences and them not liking me.      its even worse with adults. [i had selective mutism when i was younger which mean i wouldnt talk to pretty much ANY adults except for a select few until i was about 8.] i get embarssed so much more easily with adults. i was never sure why, i guess i think adult's opinions of me are more important? its like, certain teachers i talk to as little as possible because im just so nervous, but others, its like we're best friends.      what do you think of all this?

Aren't there good reasons for underground dwelling, like low cost heating, wind protection, and importantly freeing land for agriculture and parks? I would have thought a thinly lined underground cavity, say in stainless steel, would resist most subterranean corrosive substances, and I understand there are tried and tested ways of providing all necessary household services, including daylight via periscopes. Is the main reason why not, simply one of custom. I would be very interested to hear from architects exposing my naivety.
20090307063832AAEXtdD	Social Science;Gender & Women's Studies	Do feminists deny women's history?	The modern feminist movement originated in the rebellion of white middle class women. They like to promote the idea all women were kept in the home, a slave to the cooking, cleaning, and child-rearing because they themselves were.       Even if you only focus on Eurocentric women, there were many educated (if affluent) women acting as physicians, leaders, scholars and whatnot. (Not to mention all the poor women doing backbreaking labor in the feudal system.)      Do you think emphasizing women's oppression discredits the achievements of women in the past? It's like when men edited the Bible and omitted or changed female figures, like Junia. The more women started to agree with their oppression, the more we were written out of history. And now we act like we never had a place in it. How does this help the feminist movement?

20090307054839AAnWBbH	Social Science;Gender & Women's Studies	Should women give up abortion for lent?	For those of you who are pro-choice most of you are probably not worth the explanation of why abortion is almost always wrong, because most of you probably won't change your minds.There are two kinds of people. Ones that have brains that comprehend stuff like this and ones that don't. Evolution provides humans with survival related know how. The kind of brain required to understand why abortion is wrong, many people just don't have, because this kind of reasoning won't increase the chances of survival, and therefore isn't reinforced through natural selection. Some get, it some don't. It's too bad. Your brains are not developed enough to understand. This thinking makes you sub-human ironically enough, because you think there is a time in every human's life, including yourselves, when you were sub-human and your life or any one else's didn't matter. Where is your sense of self worth? The difference is you don't deserve to be killed for believing this even when you believe (oddly using the same level of cognizance that you believe helps make you not sub-human) that a life that isn't sub-human (like you are) should be killed if some one like you sees fit. Dehumanization is a necessary tool for people to commit crimes against humanity. It is a way to eliminate guilt and justify their actions. Holocaust, Slavery, etc.       Have a wonderful day!
20090307061728AAMIxeL	Social Science;Psychology	How do i appreciate the little what i have....the life i have that i hate?	my life sucks all because of the person i am. i am not social and i believe that the best you can get from life is the relationships you have with people, happiness comes learning and interets through communication which i dont have. everyday i lead is full of emptiness and depression. my brain functions abnormally, how do i be grateful for this and not angry and wanting to die every single day. i dont have thoughts and im not happy with the emptiness in my brain so instead my brain gets clogged with suicidal thoughts and death every second of every day. without the ability to talk what do i have. i can look but there isnt much to look at. it just causes jealousy. i cant accept my self or my existence. every second is painful. what do i have to be thankful for. suffering? i just cant.
20090307052715AAx9pzu	Social Science;Economics	Stimulate the economy?	Why not bailout the people? Unemployment is keeping money from being in the cash flow.  How about pay everyone $1000 or $2000 a month for a year or two? Instead of stimulating the ceo of company s that make millions..      The money would be going back to the economy when the people use it and will just recycle. There isn't a cash flow to the economy because foreclosures and bad loans.      $2000 would be a great help. Bailout the lower and middle class and well as the upper class.

20090307070357AAfa3kd	Social Science;Economics	Where did the dollar go and why.?	Three men go into a hotel and get a room for $10.00 a guy.   3x $10.00 = $30.00    They go to thier room, about an hour later the manager relizes that he overcharged the men by $5.00. So he gave the money to the bell hop to refund the men. On the way up to the room the bellhop wonders how to split the money 3 ways, The only way the bellhop could do it, was to keep $2.00 for himself and give each man back a dollar. so .......3x $10.00 = $30.00 minus $1.00 back so ......they only paid $9.00 a piece 3x $9.00 = $27.00 plus the $2.00 the bellhop kept = $29.00.  Where did the other dollar go?

20090307074853AAUTMoH	Social Science;Gender & Women's Studies	Women, we can control the future here?	In ancient Greece, the women got tired of the men going off to war for the usual silly reasons. They devised a plan to withhold sex until men came to their senses. Think of the possibilities here. Men live for sex. Women can take it or leave it. What if we demanded Equal Rights, an end to the illegal war against the Iraqi people, and social justice for all....or no nookie! We could bring about a kinder, gentler America. Done world-wide we could lead the people into a new era of peace and justice for all. What do you think?
20090307073233AAwqEgN	Social Science;Psychology	How can I approach this girl?	the girl next door, sexy, tall, pretty, ... she told me that she have broken up with his boyfriend and haven't been with anybody for four month, I like to ask her on a date, and I told her casually couple of times, it doesn't seem to be like she doesn't like me, but she said no, " I'm not feeling good ... I'm tired ..." she said. we have been out once to a coffee shop and I spoke about the school, I'm trying to get permission for my masters, she talked about her last boyfriends. I mean everything look like it is a perfect time for starting a new relationship for both of us, I haven't been in a relationship for almost a year.   I assume she is an INDOOR kind of person and she rarely goes out for dinner or something.   should I speak about my intention to start a new relationship with her in her place or like casually wherever I saw her if she doesn't like to go out for a dinner or something.   other thing is I think maybe she is not over her ex-boyfriend yet cuz she told me several times that she loved him, but he left the country and he is with another girl right now and is not responding to her calls and mails!   I think I can be a good friend to her!   thanks for the comment!
