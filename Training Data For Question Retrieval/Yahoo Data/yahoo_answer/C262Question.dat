20090219123808AAJxyeo	Entertainment & Music;Polls & Surveys	GUYS: I need advice about showering in a guy's locker-room on college campus for the first time?	Ok. I am a college student, at a community college. I work-out at the gym, and I might plan on working-out before one of my classes. I won't want to go to class all sweaty after a work-out. So I'll probably hit the dude's showers in the lockerroom. I've never showered on a college campus before. The showers in the dude's lockerroom are public, so students see eachother showering. I never did this before, and I'm getting out in the world trying new things. Should I shower in the locker-room with boxers on to (cover my guy's down there) or should I shower naked. (Other dude students will see me.) Also i usually go commando, so need advice...thanks.

20090219124121AAILMjR	Entertainment & Music;Polls & Surveys	What's a good name for a boy chipmunk band?	Well, I'm one of those people who make up little chipmunk bands. I need a name for my boys. Like, a word to put before munks.    Examples: Magicmunks, Hotmunks, etc. but those are taken.   Here's a little something about each one:      David-The shy, quiet cousin of my main band, The Saraettes. He is one of the most powerful and useful of the band, despite his quietness. He has the power to bring back any person or animal. He often avoids fighting, except fighting with his cousin Sarah, who he's loves to annoy.      Alex-The sweet, father-like figure to The Saraettes. He is a half-vampire, who will protect Sarah and any of her friends. His special talent as a vampire is Invisibility and can heal about every wound.      Nick-The shy, old vampire friend of the Oakwind (Oakwind is The Saraettes' last name.) He has been roaming the earth for 250 years. He is able to create illusions.      Ben-The mysterious, quiet and creepy vampire. Not exactly a friend of Sarah and her sisters, and they try to avoid him. His special talent is he can get certain people to trust and believe him.      Any ideas for band names?

20090219130418AAf6X3g	Entertainment & Music;Polls & Surveys	Poll: WHAT DO YOU THINK OF THIS STORY PEN PAL SENT ME ( CAIMS ITS TRUE)?	My family moved into this house in Colorado in 1980. I was 11 years old at the time. Immediately I learned there are such things as ghosts. It would say my name every night when I went to bed, and I would just lay there shaking, thinking "What was that?"       Many things happened over the years with this ghost. Most notably every night we would hear someone digging in the rocks on the side of the house. Even with three feet of snow on the ground! Of course when we would look the next day there would be nothing dug up. This is the encounter I want to talk about, however.       I was sitting downstairs just chilling, watching TV, and the ghost was probably trying to scare me in one way or another. After seven years with this thing, I didn't get scared anymore, it just made me angry that it was trying to scare me. Anyway, I'm tired, I turn out all the lights, and run up the stairs with this thing chasing me like it always did. I get into my room and shut the door, my heart racing a bit, getting ready for bed. Then it occurs to me I have left something downstairs that I cannot let my mother see. Probably a crack pipe or something. So I open up the door to go downstairs, and I swear this ghost is standing right in front of me. A huge rush of cold and fear hit me and I shut the door, scared silly. It left me breathless for a minute. What a horrible feeling. And yet an even worse feeling was when I told myself it didn't matter how scared I was, I had to open the door back up and go downstairs to get my stuff. Eventually the fear of my mother overcame my fear of the       . Never my mom, though (I know she did hear the digging). I think the ghost was afraid of her too

20090219160242AAJXQRZ	Entertainment & Music;Polls & Surveys	Girls: Would you rather have a son or daughter if you could only have one?	I've always wanted 3 girls and no boys. I just think that from my expierence they're easier because boys always want the latest game consoles and stuff. and like my grandma always said "a son is a son until he gets married, a daughter is for life". and my grandpa always said "man will kill man" because they like violence so much.      boys are trouble, they're soo hard to raise and if you don't raise them right they could even become criminals. I'm not saying that all men are wife beaters and rapist BUT if you don't raise them to respect women you never know. I mean what's the worse a daughter can become if you don't raise her right?      I just find it annoying that when I say I only want daughters people get offended but it's OK for men to say they only want sons.      but thats just my point of view. how about you?

20090203044606AAR8pa0	Entertainment & Music;Jokes & Riddles	Is this a sad story .. After working for years,?	a hooker finally retired and, being afraid of spending the rest of her life alone, she decided to marry. She had been with so many perverted men over the years that she felt she needed a change, and would only get one by marrying a virgin male close to her age.      She took out ads in newspapers around the world seeking a male virgin who was 55 years old. She finally narrowed her choice to an Australian computer programmer. After a thorough background check, she was satisfied that he had indeed never been with a woman and they were married.      On their wedding night, she went into the bathroom to change into her nightie.      When she came back out, she found that her new husband had taken the bed, and everything in the room, and stacked it in one corner of the room.      Thinking this was rather kinky, she said to her husband, "I thought you had never been with a woman."      He replied, "That's true, but if it's anything like sex with a kangaroo, we're going to need all the room we can get!"         (don't worry im an aussie its a joke ..and i haven't done anything like that ..well this year anyway)

20090219162642AAfbXTC	Entertainment & Music;Jokes & Riddles	This is a good joke.....?	A woman is at home when she hears    someone knock at the door. She goes    to the door and opens the door to see    a man standing there. He asks the lady    "Do you have a vagina". She slams the    door in disgust. The next morning she    hears a knock at the door and it is the     same man and he asks the same question    of the woman "Do you have a vagina".    She slams the door again. Later that night    when her husband gets home she tells him    what has happened for the last two days.     The husband tells the wife in a loving and    concerned voice "Honey I am taking tomorrow    off to be home just in case this guy shows up    again". The next morning they hear a knock at    the door and both run for the door. The husband    says to the wife in a whispered voice "Honey, I'm    going to hide behind the door and listen and if it    is the same guy I want you to answer yes to the     question because I want to see where he is going    with it". She nods yes to her husband and opens    the door. Sure enough the same fellow is standing    there and asks the same question. "Do you have a     vagina"....... "Yes' she says...... The man replies..    "Good!!! Would you mind telling your Husband to    leave my Wife's alone and start using yours???

20090220083024AAYiO6z	Entertainment & Music;Horoscopes	I am an Aquarious, and I am struggling with my commitment to my fiance? How do I deal with these urges?	I have been battling some serious urges here lately. I am in a serious relationship, we are getting married in april, he is a Gemini I love him more than anything, and that is what has kept me from cheating so far. Why is it so hard for me to just say no lately? I have never cheated before, but now there is this guy from my past.. He doesn't even compare to my fiancee, not emotionally and not sexually but I have these urges for him. I have these dreams about him. I think I see him everywhere.. I just can't get this guy off my mind. We were sexual in the past, but nothing spectacular came from it. I ended up leaving this man for my fiance. We had a very drama free split. We were only intamite twice, and decided we were better as friends. But never kept in touch. Now here lately for some strange reason I can't get him out of my head. When my fiance and I make love I see him... this disturbes me.       I've talked to my fiance about having trouble getting him off my mind (I didn't mention the part about making love and seeing him), and he was more than open to a three way, but I'm not sure I want something like that. I don't know what that would do to our relationship. It would cause trust issues to arise.. this isn't something I think would help our relationship grow. And as an aquarian I don't even want to think of him being Intimate with another woman let alone be apart of it.. But how could I tell him no if he let me do this with this other guy?   Maybe being with him one last time is all it will take to get him off my mind? Maybe this is just cold feet... I don't know...    Maybe these urges are just something I need to learn to deal with, but I don't know how.. Any insight would be helpful.      This isn't a problem I feel like I can speek easy about. It's very embarrising, and well just something I'm not proud of.    How do I deal with this?   I'm sorry if this offended you.

20090203055055AAF3Qwc	Entertainment & Music;Movies	Which Cinderella movie is this? Can someone help me find it?	It's a rather old one. probably from the 1940s. It was a part-musical. The girl's name was Ella or Ellene, I think, her step sisters would call her 'cinder'ella. She had very short hair and often worked in the dirt in their pumpkin patch. She met the prince while he was swimming in a forest pond and he introduced himself as the royal chef. An old wise lady (really, a fairy) helped her by providing her with a ball gown and she slipped into the royal ball looking for her 'chef'. The girl was something of a tomboy and the movie started with an incident with a monkey on the street.   I really loved it, the only time i saw it. I think I saw it either on TNT or ZeeMGM.   Help? please?

It was about a monster, i guess that's what he was, with yellow and black stripes and longish yellow hair living in the mirror or a girl called Lydia. And he came out of the mirror and everything.   The intro of the show is that he sits in a roller coaster with her and takes of his head. And in the background there is a spiral moving.      I dont know what the program's name is, can anybody help?   I want to live those 90's memories again!

Please, if for some reason, you hate Nirvana or their genius frontman, don't answer this question. Let's keep negativity to a minimum.   Are you doing anything to commemorate his life, today?    What is your favorite Nirvana song?   Favorite Nirvana album?   Let's not make this about the "Courtney killed Cobain" conspiracy or anything related to his death. It's better to celebrate life than dwell on dying, ok?

I personally think Tupac and Biggie are completely garbage & annoying.

20090203065830AAQIljM	Entertainment & Music;Polls & Surveys	Do you know if you are instant messaging (IM) ... Others can hack your computer!?	by tracing IP address (Online Fingerprint) and hack you if you're not having enough security!      Few different way of doing it as well protecting own IP:      1.Most common way of compromising IP is to pass link to someone in IM. It is easy to create web page (containing anything: funny pic, video etc – even with free Yahoo Geocities  http://geocities.yahoo.com/gcp/)  than by adding script to page with help of free service like StatCounter:  http://www.statcounter.com/  log IPs and system info (operating system name and version, browser name and version, last visited site prior to clicking – etc etc) of all people which visited site. There are also free (bit gay and fishy) programs which allow to send link in IM which when clicked display IP of person in it’s window.      2.By taking advantage of fact that some chat communications: some IMs, cams (supermode always) as well other chat communications are connecting sometimes via peer-to-peer connection, by using monitoring tools like mentioned netstat command (type: nestat –b), firewall monitor, this free tool: ( http://www.microsoft.com/technet/sysinte...  ) or best - packet sniffer, it is possible to monitor (and/or log) all connection which allows determining IP of person with which you instant massage, watch cam (or allow watch yours) etc.         To prevent someone from getting your IP you could:      1.Download YTunnel which allows blocking peer-to-peer connection in it’s preferences:  http://www.ytunnelpro.com/  (you could also set firewall rules to do same however using tunnel is probably just easier).      2.Don’t click any links, especially since beside giving your IP you could get trojaned in totally invisible manner by briefly visiting page alone (unless you know how to do it safely) – to see how download and listen to audition #7 (fast forward it to 20 minutes 50 seconds) from this page:  http://www.grc.com/SecurityNow.htm       3.Use proxy, or better (and safer) VPN client which will hide your IP both when clicking links and from sniffed chat communication – free, extremely easy to use zero configuration VPN client  http://www.iopus.com/ipig/       4.Set your home to dynamic IP connection which allows changing IP on fly, should a need arise as when you suspect someone might have compromised your IP.      Another one important thing! Yahoo! Answers hides email but when you enable the option "Allow Answers users to contact me via Yahoo! Messenger." ... Your email address is exposed! So there is a possibility to hack your email and track your IP address!      So it's better to uncheck that option!      Star and rate if you like! OK? :o)

20090220095607AAAd5zg	Entertainment & Music;Celebrities	A question for all Chris Brown fans (especially women)?	How do you feel about Chris Brown after his "violent outburst" with Rihanna?  Will you ever feel the same way about him as you did before he physically abused Rihanna?      Will you still continue to support his career (buying his albums, concert tickets, paraphernalia,) ? Or are you done with him, and will potentially boycott his music, endorsements, and anything else related to him? Do you believe his career can recover? Or do you believe that it's over? Details=10.      P.S.   Would you mind saying if your a man or a woman. Because I know that domestic violence has a stronger effect on women and I want to know how they feel about this.

20090220094356AAyhc40	Entertainment & Music;Jokes & Riddles	Rabbit joke ..................?	A rabbit    walks into a pub and says to the barman, 'Can I have a pint of beer and a Ham    and Cheese Toastie?'. The barman is amazed but gives the rabbit a pint of beer    and a ham and cheese toastie. The rabbit drinks the beer and eats the toastie,    he then leaves.                                                              The    following night the rabbit returns and again asks for a Pint of Beer and a Ham    and Cheese Toastie. The barman, now intrigued by the rabbit and the extra    drinkers in the pub (because word gets round) gives the rabbit the pint and the    toastie. The rabbit consumes them and leaves.         The next    night, the pub is packed, in walks the rabbit and says 'A pint of beer and a Ham    and Cheese Toastie, please barman'.  The crowd is hushed as the barman    gives the rabbit his pint and toastie and then burst into applause as the rabbit    wolfs them down.         The next    night there is standing room only in the pub, coaches have been laid on for the    crowds of patrons attending, the barman is making more money in one week than he    did all last year. In walks the rabbit and says, 'A Pint of Beer and a Ham and    Cheese Toastie, please barman', smiling and accepting the tributes of the    masses. The barman says, 'I'm sorry rabbit, old mate, old mucker but we are    right out of them Ham and Cheese Toasties'.         The rabbit    looks aghast, the crowd has quietened to almost a whisper, when the barman    clears his throat nervously and says,  'We do have a very nice Cheese and    Onion Toastie'. The rabbit looks him in the eye and says, 'Are you sure I will    like it?' The masses bated breath is ear shatteringly silent. The barman, with a    roguish smile says 'Do you think that I would let down one of my best friends, I    know you'll love it'. 'Ok' says the rabbit,' I'll have a Pint of Beer and a    Cheese and Onion Toastie'. The pub erupts with glee as the rabbit quaffs the    beer and guzzles the toastie, he then waves to the crowd and    leaves....         ......NEVER    TO RETURN!!!!!!         One year    later in the now impoverished public house, the barman (who has only served 4    drinks tonight, 3 of which were his) calls time. When he is cleaning down the    now empty bar, he sees a small white form, floating above the bar. The barman    says, 'Who are you' To which he is answered, 'I am the ghost of the rabbit that    used to frequent your public house'. The barman says, 'I remember you, you made    me famous, you would come in every night and have a Pint of Beer and a Ham and    Cheese Toastie, masses came to see you and this place was famous' The rabbit    says, 'Yes I know'. The barman said, 'I remember, on your last night we didn't    have any Ham and Cheese Toasties, you had a Cheese and Onion one instead' The    rabbit said 'Yes, you promised me that I would love it'. The barman said     'You never came back, what happened?'         'I DIED',    said the Rabbit.         'NO!' said    the barman,'what from'.    After a    short pause. The rabbit said...            'Mixin'-me-toasties'

20090203070012AAoEjPc	Entertainment & Music;Movies	Attention Movie Buffs! What's this movie called?	I don't remember any of the actors in it, and I saw it a couple years ago.  It's a movie about multiple personality disorder. It starts off as a story about 7 (give or take) different people, and in the end you find out that it was actually all one person. He suffered from multiple personality disorder. I remember he was a little heavier, and bald. They had him strapped to a chair. You find out that everytime he went to therapy, he was one of these "people". He had different voices for each, different handwritings for each, etc.      All I remember about the different "people" is there was a woman who was a hooker, a little kid, and a man who was the "hero" in the story. The actual man who had the disorder kept saying something along the lines of, "Whores never win" or "Whores never live" (referring to the prostitute)      Does anybody have any idea what movie I'm talking about? It's really good. Can't remember the name.

They happen to walk by the condom display, and the boy asks, “What are these, Dad?”      To which the man matter-of -factly replies, “Those are called condoms, son… Men use them to have safe sex.”      “Oh, I see,” replied the boy pensively. “Yes, I’ve heard of that in health class at school.” He looks over the display and picks up a package of 3 and asks, “Why are there 3 in this package?”      The Dad replies, “Those are for high school boys. One for Friday, one for Saturday and one for Sunday.”      “Cool, says the boy. He notices a 6 pack and asks, “Then who are these for?”      “Those are for college men.” the Dad answers, “Two for Friday, Two for Saturday and Two for Sunday.”      “WOW!” exclaimed the boy, “then who uses THESE?” he asks with bright eyes, picking up the 12 pack.      With a sigh, the Dad replied, “Those are for married men, one for January, one for February, one for March…”

I have a fond, well not exactly fond, but distant memory of a television programme I watched when I was younger about a group of people that were trying to kill each other in order to gain custody of a small infant. From what I remember, it was a reality TV programme, hosted by some naff american with an annoyingly white smile. At one point, a man blew up an entire hotel building in order to catch one of his opponents that was staying inside.      Everyone I have spoken to denies this programmes existance, but I am not so sure. If anyone has any recollection of it ever existing, it would be nice to know. However, it may just have been a dream...

She shaved her head and got 100 k for the pic, lucky her, some of us are fighting to keep our families together and fighting cancer at the same time. I don't want anyone to feel sorry for me but feel she has lived her life without any dignity popping out children in unsteady relationships,at least she should try to die with some. Who is she anyway a bigot and a bully who had been shunned, now she is back....why don't all the people fawning over her give something to cancer research..

20090220114954AAuhKoT	Entertainment & Music;Television;Reality Television	Rock of Love Bus: Who else thinks he's just doing it for some extra cash?	I realize he's already rich but who is going to turn down an extra fifteen minutes of fame and a pocketful of cash?      I ask this because of the following reasons:   1. Even though he has fallen for types like Pamela Anderson before, I can't honestly see him falling for any of the girls in this season. They're nothing but silicone and grease! Was it cast that way on purpose?   2. Though him and Ambre "split" he has said that she is open to him doing another season and that they "left the door open." Do you think the "split" was really just a clever publicity move and advance for a new season? It would explain why they couldn't choose better girls. Don't get me wrong. There's rarely a classy girl in these seasons but the last two were at least Playboy-esque. The current girls are just trailor trash with some boob jobs and bleach.      What are your thoughts?

Leading male: I love Emile Hirsch. He's a great actor. So, it would be pretty sweet to get him to star in a movie of mine. Or... Phillip Seymour Hoffman because, come on, has he ever been in a bad movie?      Leading lady: If the main female was older, I'd go for Kate Winslet. I agree with Leo's remark about her being one of the best actresses of the last decade. If the lady was younger, Evan Rachel Wood. She's been in some really dark, great movies. But, she's also capable of being funny and light hearted.

If my friend, in my friend's list,has his or her webcam 'on' and is showing himself or herself to about 3 people, then is there any way to know how people my friend is showing his or her webcam to ? say if i don't know and i want to know, without asking my friend, how people are watching my friends webcam, then is there any software or something through which i can know ?      Because there is a software which actually scans the id and says whether the webcam of some yahoo user is 'on' or 'not'.The name of that software is "Buddyspy", but it doesn't tell you how many people are watching the user through the webcam. So, does anybody know of any such software or procedure through which i know that ? Thanks :-)

I hadn't been on it for awhile. And do you guys like this new layout?

20090220074902AATZ22h	Entertainment & Music;Polls & Surveys	How much did this surprise you?	Have a history teacher explain this---if they can.   Abraham Lincoln was elected to congress in 1846.   John F Kennedy was elected to Congress in 1946.      Abraham Lincoln was elected president in 1860.   John F. Kennedy was elected President in 1960.      Both were particularly concerned with civil rights.   Both wives lost their children while in the white house.      Both Presidents for shot n Friday.   Both Presidents were shot in the head.      Now it gets really wierd.      Lincoln's secretary was named Kennedy.   Kennedy's secretary was named Lincoln.      Both were assasinated by southerners.   Both were succeeded by Southerners named Johnson.      Andrew Johnson,who succeeded lincoln was born in 1808.   Lyndon Johnson,who succeeded Kennedy was born in 1908.      John Wilkes Booth who assasinated Lincoln was born in 1839.   Lee Harvey Oswald who assasinated Kennedy was born in 1939.      Both assasins were known by their three names.   Both names are composed of fifteen letters.      Now hang on to your seat   Lincoln was shot at a theater named Ford.   Kennedy was shot in a car called "lincoln" made by Ford.      Lincoln was shot at a theater and his assasin ran and hid in a warehouse.   Kennedy was shot from a warehouse and his assasin ran and hid in a theater.      Booth and Oswald were assasinated before their trials.      And here's the kicker...      A week before Lincoln was shot,he was in Monroe,Maryland.   A week before Kennedy was shot,he was with Marilyn Monroe.      Creepy?   This is one history lesson most people probably will not mind reading!

However...my grades went up, my stress level went down, I saved more money, and got loads done.      For another two weeks, I seized the day. Carpé Diem was my motto. I planned nothing. I took everything on a whim and had fun. Lived life as if each day was my last.   However, by three days I had no money. I failed two tests. My room was a mess. My skin got bad (a few spots) and life was pretty hectic.         I thought it was interesting. I would of thinking the second would have been WAY more fun and uplifting. It wasn't.
