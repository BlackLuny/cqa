20090307160907AAkSs6p	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Scared for a moment, do they think i.....?	ok well tonight as my boyfriend's birthday and i decided for him to come over. my parents went out for dinner since it was a business meeting and my bf came over. we messed around for a long time. we did some amazing things that i never did before. when we were in the middle of it i heard a car door slam. of course we were using protection . anyways i looked outside and my parents were home. so we jumped in the shower and still messed around. it was awesome. but then my dad walked into my bathroom and said hi honey were home. and my bf quickly bent down between my legs. i answered him and said hi daddy can u leave because this is arkward and he did. then my bf did some things down between my legs and i giggled. my dad said what? then i said nothing. he left then i jumped out of the shower and dried off. my dad was leaving my room when he found a condom. he took it and locked my door. i walked out of the shower with my bf and we sneaked him out. but then my dad asked me why is there a condom in your room. and i said ummm  our teacher gave it to us for a project for family life stuff. he was confused but said ok. do you think he suspected something?
20090307160832AAXvNqJ	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Why was he afraid when I told him my religion?	I went to a dance with a guy my friend set me up with. We got along great (chemistry was there). I drink, but only in moderation (never gotten drunk) and he said that is very respectable and asked if my parents are strict like his. When I said yes, he asked if I was Catholic. I told him my dad is, but I'm the religion of my mom: Jehovah's Witness. He gave me a weird look and said, "Oh, so you DON"T celebrate your birthday?" (It was my bday the day b/f and he wished me happy b-day). The thing is I am not as devout as I should be and am still learning about the religion. So, why are people so scared to date JW? If i'm willing to try, why aren't they. I won't make them be a JW!
20090307160836AAPKjCu	Family & Relationships;Weddings	Does it make sense I have mixed emotions about the wedding ring?	Me and my husband haven't been married long, and we did it through the Justice of the Peace since we don't have such a good income and only get paid monthly. Last week I decided to buy him a wedding band on ebay which was very cheap but worth a lot (I was the only one who bid). He was flattered, yet sad since I didn't have one. Unfortunately, even though my monthly pay is small I make a good amount more than him. Today me and my husband were at Walmart which we barely ever go since currently we don't have a car, and since we had the chance to buy things he wanted me to get a ring. The thing is his account right now is basically empty so I bought it. I feel sad yet happy I have a wedding band now. I paid more for my ring than his (it wasn't expense though). I feel you figure its practically always the man who buys the rings. He is the one who asked me to marry him though; that wasn't me or us when marriage was very first brought up. Though on that part I don't have an engagement ring. I'm happy it can show that we're now married and have rings but it kind of hurts that I paid for mine. Does that make sense or do I sound like a cry baby? Me and my husband do love each other and just this week we had our first daughter. What do you think?

20090505180451AAun2id	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	How can I tell if this shy girl at school likes me?	So there is this girl at school that I like. She seems to have a somewhat shy personality in general, but seems to get a lot shyer when she is around me. Earlier this school year, she found out I liked her and got really weird about it. I talked to her and straightened everything out. She said she didn't like me like that and I told her I would rather stay friends. We talked a lot on the bus the other day, and now she seems to be extremely shy around me again. What do you think, does she like me, or no?

I'm 7 years younger, could it be i've higher sex drive?       2. He got low sex drive, could it be that I'm less attractive to him after giving birth?       3. He also ended fast before i'm ok.

June 6,2008. to a man that i have been in a relation ship with for 12 years. he has a 10 year old daughter that he conceived during one of our drama periods.       her mother has always controlled him with this child until recently he had enough and is now battling it out in court with her. in the past 6 months we have been 8 times..some newly weds huh. my problem is that this drama is getting on my nerve and truly so is he. he drinks alot now because of it and stays out all the time doing that. he does not like to talk out his problems he tries to drink then away.      now  public aid just took just  took his income tax saying he is behind in child support and he is not and he is really going crazy now.i do not think that it is fair for me and my kids to get the short in of the stick from him because of his **** up 10 years ago when he was weak as hell and cheated. brake or no break if he was going to sleep around with an ex he should have protected himself and we would not be about to divorce after 7 months

20090307151639AAcGkpq	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Is it just me? I know that I'm probably still pretty naive...?	Not too surprising, considering I didn't know many boys or lose my virginity til I was 20 (now 24), but it seems to me that unlike most girls, a lot of guys enjoy mostly (speaking of sex) when a girl is being pleasured then themselves. I never understood this, because if they're not feeling something how can it be fun for them if it's just the woman that is? I'm sorry, I'm still fairly new to all of this (scary I know), but Does anyone know why guys are like that? or how they can enjoy a woman being pleasured so much over themselves? I just still don't get it!

20090307141730AAbwcIH	Family & Relationships;Other - Family & Relationships	Confused feelings about my boyfriend? Should I just leave him?	We get along well, he is mostly a gentleman and has been properly raised and he is the kind of person you can really trust. However he does have a selfish streak. Whenever we argue he turns it around and makes everything my fault, he is totally unaware of emotions and gets angry if I get upset, and sometimes he is inappropriate about sex and doesn't know how to treat a girlfriend. He isn't a very good listener. Even with all his faults I love him dearly and when I look at him all I see is a gorgous guy who loves me. I am torn between being with the man I love and cares about me too, but maybe doesn't know how to treat a girlfriend. What do you think?

I have very good friends and in social gatherings, people really like me and tell me that I have a good heart, I am sweet,easy to talk to and very likable, but for whatever reason most of my family is my enemy. ( like my uncles, my aunts and my cousins). I don't know why???? They say I am manipulative, *****, untrustworthy, and sometimes they call me prostitue ( because in the past I had boyfriends). I must say my family is Iranian and my friends are all foreign nationals mostly Americans and Europeans.      My own husband listens to my family and has a very negative view on me. I have totally lost contact with the family, but my husband is in touch with them and call them daily. Even his family hate me so much, and they are all Iranians. They all call me liar, ***** and disgusting.      It's so sad, I am now a mother of a 2 year old girl and I am studying phd genetics. I don't know what I have done to them. I don't know why they all hate me so much. I was crying today for 2 hours when my husband said they are all telling the truth and he better watches himself with me. He even tells me that I am a cruel mother and don't deserve my child.      I am so sad.....

I thought that the light shined out his ****. I spent ages flirting with him, going to where he worked just to see him, bought him drinks hoping that he would say something. Then last november he asked for my number, i rang him and he told me that he liked me. and he said that he wanted to meet up and that i was the only girl he wanted. i believed him and was absolutly thrilled! However, next day i rang him to see when he wanted to meet but he was with his mates and acted like a complete twat. I rang him after but never got hold of him. It took me so long to get over him and now ive found out he has a new job at my local fair. And i know this sounds pathetic but i really wanna make him jealous. My mates have no suggestions. How do you think is the best way to make him jealous? Or to make him kick himself for letting me go lol. Btw i havent got a boyfriend. Heres some pics.

All I get is complaints about my smoking sigarettes (I do outside) even though the place is mine and I pay for it.   She's looking the reason why she left her 68 year old husband for?, well it's a baby...and I will not give it to her.   This all is like, she is lacking respecting my person, regularly insulting me and why do I keep putting up with this?   Once I showed her the door and we got back toghether.   I hate her mood changes and I do not know how to handle them.   I let her have her freedom while cutting down mine.   Yes she did not have to go to work when with her ex and regularly could travel to her homeland.   As I told her, if you were only looking a baby, you could have seduded any man in that cafe that night, why me?   Why did you make me buy a place?, why did I sell my motorcycle?, why did you make me settle with you?, why you took away my freedom?   Can anyone advise me what to do in this relationship?   Am I going wrong somewhere?
20090307152141AA0OAa0	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	I'm deeply in love with him. Help??? answer fast for best answer!!?	There's this guy who i really like a lot. Ever since i started liking him i started falling for him more and more. He has this great personality and makes me laugh all the time. He is the most amazing guy i've met and yet he's the sweetest guy ever. He liked me too and said i was a really cute and nice person. He even told my friend that he thinks i'm a very wonderful girl. Then, he suddenly got a gf....i was really crushed. He cares about me a lot cuz he said that's what friends are for and he thought i'd be mad when i found out but i wasn't, i was only upset. Now he wants to be my close friend. He says i can do better than him. I was afraid that with all this waiting he'd end up with another girl, i'm afraid of what hasn't happened yet, but most of all i'm afraid i'll never find a guy that could compare to him. What do I do??? Please help me? The thought of him with another girl makes me cry so much.=( I don't think i could ever forget about him because of how much he means to me. I've never felt this way about a guy before.

20090225073957AAzBOmH	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	How Can I Communicate Better With My Boyfriend?	We got in an arguement a few days ago, and I really, really want to talk about things.   However, he doesn't. We argue pretty often, so I'm guessing he's just kind of fed up with it all. He's also very busy and stressed out with work, that that also might have something to do with it.      But he's not picking up his phone, he's not responding online, and if I go to his house to visit him I might piss off his parents (his dad doesn't like girls coming over to the house), which will piss my boyfriend off.      In the past, whenever he gets upset, he resorts to drugs. I did speak to him online 2 days ago, but he was acting really strange. I don't know if he was just messing with me, or I'm not sure if he's high. He did say though that he would call me...which he never did.       Should I wait for him to talk about things, or should I go make sure he's ok?

20090227084659AAdrYFx	Family & Relationships;Friends	How can this be taken wrongly?	Recently, a friend and i had a little tiff. I've known her for close to 20 years so she should be aware of my bizarre sense of humour.    She phoned me on my mobile and asked if i would like to go watch a movie. I actually thought it was a good idea and was willing to go. She went through the list of movies. The only one she was interested in was one we both saw about a month ago. We both agreed that it was a, 'not very good' movie.   So why would i want to see it again? Why would she?    She tried to persuade me but i wasn't having it. In the end, after saying to her like 12 times in 20 minutes, no, i felt a fart coming so i held it to my **** and farted long and loud.   She clicked off and now won't speak to me. it's a shame because that was 4 days ago, now i'm starting to miss her. How can someone let a simple thing like farting down your ear get in the way of nearly 20 years of close friendship?

Almost a  year ago now a girl liked me and she is somewhat shy so her friend ended up helping her let me know. I thought that it was really nice but I just wasn't ready to date and it was kinda vague whether I was allowed to date or not. Anyways I told her this and we decided to be friends and it wasn't ever awkward. Anyways, this year I started to hang out with her friend and it led to us being dating. I know the girl who liked me likes someone else now and she seemed cool about it. I just found out how much she really did like me last night though from the girl I am dating. Now I feel like a d*ck for asking her friend out but I really like her. She talks about a new guy she likes but I don't want it to be awkward if were hanging out and I want to like hold hands/kiss the girl I am dating. Am I  a dick for asking her friend out when she used to like me?      We're all 15/16 and sophomores and all go to different schools

I lost my virginity to him& i had some of the most amazing times of my life with him.But now at 18,those feelings have somehow changed into a more brotherly love,yet my feelings for guy A have never wavered,& he told me he feels the same way.We now want to be together properly but im scared for some reason,though im never happier when im with him.Most would probably say guy B was my first love because of the time we spent together etc,but is that really true when guy A was the first one i had feelings for & its the same now?

So my boyfriend and I have been broken up for a couple months now and we are still very good friends but I want to get back together with him,the bad thing is I did have sex with another guy.. I rebounded horribly =( So he has been very upset about that! But I know he still loves me, and he still says things like "when I saw you yesterday you looked amazing" "you have a wonderful body" he always talks to me when I'm upset and If I'm really really sick he will come over.. I want him back so bad. So I was thinking I was going to ask him to come over in the next couple of weeks watch a couple movies together and try and get him back together with me. But I don't know what to say to get him back!! So I really do need a lot of help here. So what would you say to get the one you love back? And I'm only 17 soo I can't really do much, I just want to be with him. And please none of this you shouldn't have to convince him to be with you and stuff like that please!

I love you and I'll be 18 soon so you won't have to be around my family so much. But please I miss you so much!"   What do you guys think of that? Do you guys have any better ideas?

20090225073402AA42Udp	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	A girl in my building lives alone in her flat. How do I nail her?	I am an Indian guy living in India.
20090225073750AAnjf7Y	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	What may be the reason?	I have a pretty decent job and earning good. Four years back I met a girl. She was in search of a job then and asked me if I can help her to find one. From then we used to talk on phone quite regularly and the call frequency increased to 2-3 hours a day. Some how that is the most awaited call for me. Finally after an year she got a job in a good IT company, she credited that to me. After her job got a month old, I said her that I am disturbed because of these daily calls and would stop it to avoid any further change in my feelings on you. I have a lot of friends who got to love some one and then break up for all right/wrong reasons and saw their suffering and mourning periods. On my saying this, she understood and stayed away. But after a month she called me and said 'how can you alone say that? I need you'. For me this is the first time talking to a girl. I have a reputation in my family and friend circle that I always stay away from girls. She is my best friend. I am very happy that she is willing to part me. She is well aware that her parents would not say no if its me. But then I asked to wait for sometime so that she would settle well in her job for her job is important to her family. This all continued for 2 years and my heart moving towards her. Then I ask if she is  ready to marry me. She bashed me like anything. I then realised that expressing fellings is such a bad thing. This all happened exactly year back. All she want is a tall and good looking guy in her own stupid caste. I am short statured. She know me more than anyone does. I can do nothing except to respect her decision.       Are looks that important? She know very well that I really care her.      My parents could get someone for me but I am against arranged marriage. Not because I do not trust it but I hate dowry and caste should not be my qualification to get a partner. Now I am under an impression that the chances of finding a partner is very bleak      Now, why should I share this here? Just one reason, all my friends know her as she is from my school. I can get some pain off of me by sharing this with my friends but I do not want to give any place for any gossips.       I am not a kind of person who keeps thinking about this and hate her saying she ditched me. Its her life at the end of the day. I am not far away from my aim to become a civil servant and I am waiting for the inverview date of Civil service exam-2008.   I can get anything if it demands my efforts but nothing that she wants. The only bad happening to me is I am getting more resistant to marriage. Any ways I feel that I missed some one I love and admire the most.      She is getting married this week. Best wishes to her please:)

20090227083915AAx9GX9	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	I just found out my boyfriend of 2 years cheated on me with a good friend of mine. How do you begin to heal?	My boyfriend cheated on me with a good friend of mine. I caught it before they could sleep with each other, but nonetheless is still cheating. We've talked and decided that we want to work it out and remain a couple. My problem is that I can't stop thinking about it all. The last 6 months of our relationship we just stopped talking to one another. That's how he started talking to her. We all work at the same place and we are scheduled on the same days sometimes. I just need some advice on how to start the healing process. I can't help throwing everything that happened in his face every chance I get. Please help.

20090307120913AAwQZFx	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	How Do I Tell My Her I Don't Feel The Same?	Me and my girlfriend of a year split up about a month ago, since then she has said to me many times that she realised what she's lost and she loves me more than ever. This is probably an exaggeration but by any means she wants me back. I thought I felt the same until she asked me whether or not i wanted to be in a relationship with her to my face yesterday. I said that I needed to think about stuff and I would tell her when I've figured stuff out. i've realised now that I do not want to be with her, but I really do not want to make her upset. I know that I have to but I'd like to do it in the nicest way. Since we broke up I have said to her that I still feel the same for her, because I thought I did. Also recently I have started liking one of her friends, and they like me, I won't go out with them because I know it would hurt my ex, but how do I let my ex know that I don't want to be with her anymore in the nicest way?      Thanks x

It seem as if he's bragging to his friends that he has a girlfriend because he's always saying gushy things on my wall on facebook instead of just sending me a personal message..and His personal message on MSN  says: "I have a girlfriend " and on his facebook it says : "I miss my girlfriend" and changes it all the time to things like that...Do you think he is just using me?

The day before my close guy friend (we are long distance friends for now) texted me saying how he is ridiculously bored and was going to have a very boring day. I texted back and kept the texting going, and we were essentially talking on and off throughout the day. Last night, he started texting me a again. He said how he was just at home cleaning. Then I texted him saying I was bummed my Friday night plans fell through. What does he do? He goes "Nothing planned for tonight huh?" And when I go "Nothing at all. Sooo disappointing!" And then he stops texting after that. And at 1am, he texted saying I change my profile picture wayyy too often, and when I texted him back he didn't respond. It was just dissappointing he didn't make an effort like I did when he said he was bored...am I just overreacting?

A covenant marriage is a legally distinct kind of marriage, in which the marrying couple agree to obtain pre-marital counseling and accept more limited grounds for divorce.

20090307110732AArsDEu	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Does this mean she doesnt like me?	I posted a question a few days ago about wether this girl liked me, everyone said yes and that i was stupid for not realizing something so obvious - and that I had to ask her out as soon as possible.      So yeah, there was a lot of evidence to say she liked me.   But the one doubt i have is that I talked to her best friend whos also my friend, and the three of us (me, the girl i like, and this best friend) always hung out. I was expecting the best friend to tell me that this girl secretly liked me too - but she didnt, she just said she was surprised and that if i really liked her i should tell her cuz thats the only way Ill no if the relationship could be anything more, but at one point she said "i dont know she could just like you as a friend", and so im concluding that this best friend either doesnt know she likes me, or that that girl really doesnt like me. My question is, does that mean that she definately doesnt like me, since if she did - wouldnt she tell her best friend?? i mean maybe she could have been embarrassed.. or maybe she thought that that friend would tell me against her wishes, but maybe im just convincing myself      oh and also, when a girl asks twice if you like anyone new, and upon saying 'no', she responds with 'well be careful next time', is that a good sign?

Then he cut everyone in line ( Lunch ) to be by me.      Then when he passed me in the hall he waved his hand to say Hi. But he did it in a not so sure way.      Does he like me? Please be honest.

20090227085016AA0TvgW	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	I like a girl. does she like me?	i like a girl that is a strip club waitress(fully clothed). we have been friends at her job for 2 months. she broke up with her boyfriend on valentine's day but went out with him a couple of days ago. she said they might get back together. everybody thinks this guy is a jerk. however the other girls say she likes me.  anyways last night i went to ihop with the waitress and 4 of the other girls. i sat next to the waitress and she started feeding me blueberries from the pancakes. also she got something on my shirt and spent a couple of minutes trying to clean it off. she then sent a text to see that i got home okay. does this girl like me or not? her best friend said she is confused and she doesnt know what she wants.
20090307121425AAmVBqI	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Can anyone give me advice on how I should ask out this girl?	I'd prefer the advice come from females.      Ok, so there's this girl I've got the hugest crush on.  She's just my type; quiet, intelligent, beautiful.  The problem is I don't know her in the slightest.  She works at this place where I cash my check, that's how I know her.  I have only seen her twice, but each time she gave me a killer smile and yes, I definitely should have asked her out by now.      So my question is really, how do I approach her at her place of work without any official business to conduct?  Do you think I should just wait until next Monday when I get my next check?  That feels like too long.      Also, what do you think I should say to her?  I have gotten a few giggles out of her with banal chatter, but haven't even asked her name.        I was planning on introducing myself, then if she immediately told me her name I was going to ask her if she'd like to have a conversation sometime.  Nothing too much like a date, just a getting to know you session.      Thanks to anyone who's kind enough to read and comment.

I don't know how to get the confidence to try and say something to him. And even if I could, he's never alone. He's always surrounded with friends and other girls flirting with him. When we walk by in the halls he seems to look down at the floor or his shoes and has trouble making eye contact. Apparently he does drugs but so do most of the kids in my grade.

20090307120010AAYAdKJ	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	How can I break up with my boyfriend and remain friends?	Hi all,   I've been with my boyfriend for 5 years. We've been great together, but about 7 months ago, we had a one-month breakup--- he left me for another girl. But it didn't work out, and I took him back. Ever since, it hasn't felt the same between us. Now he's sweeter than ever and I know he's sincerely sorry for what happened 7 months ago, but I haven't fully forgiven him. I feel like I want to break up and have more time to think if I REALLY want to be with him. I want him in my life, he's a good guy and I enjoy his company, but I feel like we'd be better friends than bf/gf. I don't know what to do... any suggestions?   It seems selfish that I want to stay friends, but what can I do?

Yesterday I was at his house, and he was sitting on the bed, and I was on the couch. But the couch was really weird and more like an over-sized armchair, not big enough to be a couch but bigger than a chair, and he got up from the bed and sat by me on the couch.      We went to our school at, like, nine o'clock and sneaked into the auditorium, and there's a couch and a mattress in it, and he was on the mattress and I sat on the couch, and he got up from the mattress and sat by me on the couch.      He never messaged me on MySpace before and now he does and we talk all the time.      Does it sound like he likes me?

20090307102759AAuepuO	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	How to get over  a serious relationship?	We dated for about 9 months, and we had dated before. He tried really hard for that second chance with me, and I was reluctant at first but after I saw that he actually really cared about me I took him back. I thought we were really good for each other and that it would last but nine months later he dumps me.       He said that it was more like friends than dating so he dumped me. How should I begin to get over this, I have become really depressed, and I don't know what to do about it. I'm seriously considering anti-depressants because I just seem so low. I have happier moments but I know that I am sad all the time. I can't sleep and I cry somedays.       Does anyone have any advice on what I should do?

And he’s friends with people that don’t really like younger kids? It’s really dumb. But his friends are really stuck up and they don’t like hanging out with kids in younger grades I guess. But he invited me to hang out with him and his friends at a  party and one of his girl friends is trying to talk to me and get me to hang out with her and stuff, but I can’t tell if she’s being serious or what. I really want to start something with him, but I want his friends to like me. And I’m really nervous to hang out with them. And eventually I have to, because I’m going to prom and stuff with them. So how do I feel more comfortable around them and get them to like me?

20090307112156AAL1gcN	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	What should I do ? I have deep feelings for a guy and idk if he feels the same or if he's serious. Need help !?	I have known this guy since freshman yr in HS. We really didnt get close until junior year. But senior year we began talking all night and somewhat flirting throughout the day. He was always sweet, funny, and very smart. He was like a dream guy everyone wanted. But towards the end of senior year, he wanted to take me to the prom but my friends told him that i wasnt wearing the same color he wanted to wear so he took one of my friends instead. Really i wasnt bothered by it 4 2 reasons I was his first option and we were all friends having a good time. Well later that night I got sick and i went home but my friends including him went out and got drunk. The following week I got news saying that my friend and the guy im attracted to kissed. I was very upset because my friend knew i had feelings for him and he somewhat knew i liked him. S o i just let that incident slid because i'm young and i dont need to feel as if I lost out on a lot. So towards the end of year, they began flirting and it was weird because he would flirt with me and then flirt with her. It would happen in front of me. I didnt want to look but i couldnt help but to. I felt as if i was stabbed in the back and she forced the knife out so i can bleed to death. Well now that it's been 2 yrs and we both r in college, we still talk. It's not the may I add. He tells me that I'm stuck with him and he loves me but idk whether to believe that or not. His habits have gotten worse too. He's always having sex and smoking weed and drinking to the point were its getting mind blowing. SO I NEED HELP. Do you think he's serious about liking me too ? I should be able to answer this question myself but as you can see I cant. I've been through a lot and idk if he's even worth fighting for anymore. My friend did confirm that she kissed him but she's not attracted to him. But then again she calls him her baby daddy (they dont have kids together). So i need positive feed back....

20090227085250AA1mPAZ	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	Why is she so pissed off?	My long term exgirlfriend and I split up one year ago, when she dumped me (I was overseas on work for a few months) via the phone and married some other guy, some ex of hers 5 months later. It hurt so bad, and still does. I still dont know what happened, she later told me she thougth i had no intentions of marrying her (we were together 3 years) and she got desperate. I tried to get her back when she split with me, but she never changed her mind.      I was cleaning out my closet and found so many things of hers that she left with me, stuff like cosmetics, books,etc Instead of just throwing them in the trash, I was still so upset and sad, I decided to mail them to her parents house (I dont know her address). I didnt mail flowers, just her old possessions.      The next day, she called my 2 best friends on the phone (she didnt call me) and they told me she was so pissed off at me, that I should have just trashed them, etc. Then her sister called me as well, yelling me, etc. I was the one who was DUMPED in a terrible way when she married someone else, I NEVER called her since she was married (but she called me several times) and never mailed her anything before. I was too upset to even talk to her (but she called me and emailed various times since she got married) Why was she so angry? She is married to some other guy, why even care what I did? One year after her marriage, why? I still feel terrible over this, it is too hard to describe. I do love her, and wish I didnt but I do.

My gf of 2yrs. caught me sniffing on a pair of her undies.  Up until then, I secretly enjoyed her scent.  She was a little upset.  We were lying in bed, and she asked me: “What did they smell like?”  I kept trying to avoid the question because I just thought that any answer would make her more upset.  So, I told her that they smelled like her “essence.”  She responded by telling me that I was “fv<king sick.”  What is the best way to handle this situation?

I got fired from my job a few weeks ago, then my parrot died and my friends decided to make me watch "Pirates of the Caribbean" to make me feel better because theirs a parrot in it.  It didn't make me feel better because all I could think about was my poor little Winky. Thru high school, he was the only person that talked to me! I would talk to him and he would talk back! He would tell me the things I already knew and repeat it to me but it was all i had! It was all I had!!!! WINKY!!!!!!!!!!! :'( :'( :'( What do I do? Where should I go? I thought I had human friends but they made me watch "Pirates of the Caribbean" so now thats over because they were just messing with me! They started calling me Big Foot to my face because I have a big foot! And they're supposed to be my friends! But they make fun of me because I have alot of problems :( I just want people to accept me no matter the size of my foot. It doesn't make sense. I feel lost. I don't know what to do :( How do I make people accept me? Sorry for putting all this on you but sometimes these feelings just burst out of me. Its like an itch you get at the pool and you feel like you have to itch all the time. I hate that itch! I hate that ITCH!!! It keeps happening to me but I love swimming but I don't like the itch!!! It just gets to me. Its like that all the time :( So what do I do to make my life better?

Alright, as title says, I dont know why but I just find it very difficult to get decent conversations going, and taking into friendsips. I guess you can call me shy, but i really dont think i am shy.

Ill give an example, this one girl i talk to for 2-3 weeks now, but dont have her number or anything, our conversations are very casual, nothing flirty, she does have a bf, so i am kind of scared to get close to her, what do you guys think.      And others, like this too, we just talk but dont really know what to do. I am a really nice guy as well, decent looking but very considerate, and love conversations :O      anyway, let me know, try not to be to harsh :)

Ill give an example, this one girl i talk to for 2-3 weeks now, but dont have her number or anything, our conversations are very casual, nothing flirty, she does have a bf, so i am kind of scared to get close to her, what do you guys think.      And others, like this too, we just talk but dont really know what to do. I am a really nice guy as well, decent looking but very considerate, and love conversations :O      anyway, let me know, try not to be to harsh :)

20090307095251AAENKlx	Family & Relationships;Friends	Friend problems... (kinda long) sorry?	Okay, so basically I moved to a different place far away from my hometown about a year ago and went to this school... Well, i found these two girls that were cool about hanging with me and I just kind of blended with them... friend A is very nice, kinda nerdy and studies all the time... not that this is bad because I admire her for not screwing up her education... and friend B seemed all nice and shy and quiet at first but I am now having problems with friend B because she told friend A that I was annoying and she is starting to ask friend A why she likes hanging out with me and why me and her always talk (friend B says all this behind my back, I obviously don't consider her my one of my closest friends anymore and i think that she's probably jealous) ... friend B doesn't have a reason to be jealous because both friend A and B share ALL the same classes together and i dont share any with them... now friend B told me when me and her were just talking one time, that she doesn't like those people who backstab, seem to be all nice at first and then kinda fade away and not want to talk to you anymore because you dont go to the same school... etc... but she's doing the same thing to me... like she acts the same as she always had around me       The problem really starts when friend A keeps saying she is getting pissed at friend B for always being negative and and says things to her about me behind my back, but then she keeps hanging around friend B because she feels thats the only person to hang around... not only that but before i knew friend B didn't like me anymore, friend B would get her little sister to tell me off on the phone when i would call (mind you i'm one of those very involved friends) and friend A knew about it but didnt tell me until recently... mind you friend A has really no backbone when it comes to defending her friends... call me desperate but when friend B isn't around friend A is so much more fun and awesome but when friend B is around with us I don't know what to say to her because she thinks one way abut me and acts another... oh and my parents wont put me in a different school so switching schools isn't an option available to me. I'm just asking for opinions on this and possibly some advice on what I should do with both people...      Thank you for listening :)

20090307095716AAwrnWu	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	What does a man mean when he says "take it slow"?	There is this lad that I like …. And well I am confused!!  - We are at the early stages of dating (so far 2 dates – and just for the record no sex).  We get on great and I really enjoy his company.  From the moment I gave him my number, he texts me several times a day, and guaranteed to ring me 1 or 2 on a daily basis! Yet when it comes to actually going out it never seems to happen. Both of us work long hours/ away from home.      It’s almost like I am having a relationship with my phone!!! I have never been like this when it comes to men, but I put this down to just the fact that he isn’t putty in my hands – and he is keeping my on my toes!   He is hot one minute and cold the next!! So I told him how I felt… and he responded…”I like you a lot, and I just wanted to take things slow.. iv been hurt before” (this boy is a “bad boy” type, don’t want to judge on that – but its doubtful a guy like him would be “heartbroken” over a girl….)      Now… to me that line says “look, I like you, but I like the other 5women I am meeting too, I don’t think you’re the favourite yet so I don’t want to commit to you”
20090307114658AASbXa3	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Is it okay that my boyfriends co-worker texts him dirty jokes...oh and calls him after work....?	Its not just anyone though, it is someone he has a sexual past with.  It is someone who has been an issue between us in the recent past.  This woman is much older than him and is some what his boss.  He was taking a nap, his phone vibrated, I looked down and the text was displayed...a dirty joke about a big penis.  Then she tried calling.  I am also upset because she called when he was supposed to be at work (he got out early and since it is Saturday, she was not working, so she wouldn't know this) but Im guessing she was trying to reach him before he got home around me...sound right?  I let him know before I was not okay with her texting him, hanging around him at work...etc.  But I think instead of confronting her, he just hides it from me.  Does it sound like maybe he just wants to be flattered, or maybe, just maybe he is still seeing her somehow?  Am I right to think this is wrong and unprofessional of the both of them?  How do I confront him?  I know this may be really obvious to some people, but I have never had to deal with this type of situation in the past...so any input/advise, male or female.  What is going on here?

20090227085508AAeHIFf	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	Will this marriage work out in the longrun?	There is a woman who dumps her boyfriend of 4 years and marries another guy 4 months later. She was deeply in love, more than she can ever know but her ex stalled and stalled to marry her, and she got desperate and didnt want to wait any longer.      So, she gets back with another ex from her past, he immediately proposes and she accepts. When the other guy found out, he begged and begged her to get back with him, he tried to stop the wedding, but she said it was too late.      Now she is married for one year, and this entire year she called her ex once every week or so, she was upset, confused, regretful of her choice, knew she was desperate.   Her husband treats her VERY well, but her heart is still torn after one year, she cant believe her reality is what it is, but she has decided to "make the best of it." SHE WISHES HER EX COULD LOVE HER AS MUCH AS HER HUSBAND DOES, BUT THE REALITY IS THAT SHE IS MARRIED NOW.   If this is how she feels after one year, will this marriage work out and WILL she be happy? Or will this "bad" decision doom this marriage in the longrun?

20090307101541AAigYHT	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Why is he playing with my emotion?/?	My bf and i have been going out for about a year, then all of a sudden he just broke up with me, saying that he needs some space, he doesn't know what he wants and said that since he's in college it's really hard for him to see me. But through out the whole year, we had like an on and off relationship, because he don't really put much in to the relationship. I was the one that was actually doing everything. Every time there's a problem he would push me away, and then he would come back to me whenever hE wants to. we also fought about him being a big flirt, even though he was with me he was also talking to other girls online in myspace telling them that he's single. so anyways we finally broke off it's been about 2 weeks, he hasn't called or talked to me, but when i came online today on myspace he send me a mesaage saying that he's missing me and that he wants me back. So what do you think?   Should i go back? Should i trust him?   Is he playing me?

20090227085233AAImvc2	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	How do you let go when your heart is still in it?	In August 2007, I sunk to my lowest as a result of my daughter's father making a commitment to another women. Six months later, he reached out to me telling me he wanted to make it work, he wanted to wife me, and have that family that I once wanted....all while still involved with his girl. I believed him (silly me) so once they broke up (July 2008) we started what I thought was a monogamous relationship. In January 2009, she calls to tell me they are still seeing each other. As a result he revealed to me, in her presence, that he was still in love with her. Me thinking, "feelings come and go maybe we can make it work" so I stick around. Two weeks later we mutually break up and they are together living that happy life that I want. Although the break up was mutual I didn't think it would hurt so badly. It's now like "we" never existed. No phone calls, no text, no how's your day...nothing!!  Not even for the child's sake. The condition of my heart wont allow rejection again from this guy. I find myself thinking about what they share constantly. How do I move past this hurtful situation and begin to live, smile, and laugh like I use to? How do I separate him as a lousy man from him as a good father? How do I feel like I never really had a fair chance with him since his heart was never in it?

20090227085153AAk9rHS	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	I fancy one of my managers - help!?	He is not the boss but one of the managers in my workplace. I dont work in his department so dont have to speak to him on a daily basis but we do cross paths and see each other often.    I really fancy him - i am 19, he is 26. I know there is a spark there already and everytime i saw him today (3 times) he'd walk past me, give me a smile and a wink and say hi. But thats how far our conversation always goes - i often see him looking at me and i always look at him too...we're both very aware that we like each other. Today i think he was going to say something else to me but i was with someone else and i don't think he wanted to approach me unless i was alone.    HOW DO I TALK TO HIM?? i.e. start a longer conversation. I cant ask him any questions really about work because we work in different fields and i dont just want to jump straight in there and ask him out for a drink or anything - i want to start to get to know him. Does anyone have any ideas about what i should say to start a chatty conversation next time i see him? (baring in mind the limited time limits we have together). Thanks.

20090307121309AAEua3k	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Why isnt he texting me?	I'm a soph, girl and have a thing with this senior guy. we've hung out a couple times and connected pretty well. he tried to make out with me the second time we hung out but i pulled away cause i had a cold and i wanted to get to know him better. i asked him what he wanted from this and he said he was open to a relationship but he wanted to get to know me better and not plan things. we hung out before march break and he was playing with my hands and my hair and told me i was pretty and all these things and then walked me to my class and gave me a kiss goodbye. i talked to him later that day and we made plans to hang out the next day. so the next day i texted him about a time and he was like sure and so then the time came around and i texted him and he said he was busy at that moment so i was just like oh okay no big, and then i saw him awhile after and asked him if he wanted to hang out still and he said yeah sure and i told him to text me      well he never texted me and i havent seen or heard from him since. we're on march break and im just wondering why he hasnt done anything yet. he thinks i'm at my friends house for a couple days but i didnt end up going. even if im gone why hasnt he texted to just say hey? he seems like he likes me and we actually live really close to each other. whats up??
20090307115646AA7pjxP	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	What should i do about this guy?	hey everyone. so im 17 years old. and about 7 months ago i had a fling with this guy at work for like a week. then he got rid of me and started dating this other girl. he literally dated her for like 2 or 3 days and then dumped her because he realized that he made a mistake and he should have just stayed with me.  i took him back because i really liked him. and we never ended up dating but we had a thing again except this time it lasted for like a month. and throughout this time we had a thing we saw each other just about every day... whether it was at work together or just hanging out.  then after a month or so, he dumped me for this ugly girl.  they ended up having a thing for a few weeks. and throughout this time i thought i was over him because he is such a player.  and its not like i could avoid him since we work together. so i thought that the best thing i could do is to just try to be friends with him.  and then about three months later, he came back to me again. and at first i was like '"no its definitely not gonna happen again." but after a while and a lot of him sweet talking me, i took him back.  this time it lasted for about two weeks. and he decided to end things with me because he realized he thought he wanted to date me but then he realized that he just liked me as a friend.  and after all of this, believe it or not, i still really like this guy.  we see each other at work and talk to each other on the phone sometimes, text, and talk via IM.  We also flirt a ton together. but he always talks about how he is pretty much in love with my best friend and how hot she is. It is so hard for me to hear him talking about her like that.  She knows how he feels about her and doesn't want to be with him. But if i tell him that it bothers me then he will know that i still have feelings for him.  And we cant get back together again because i will be disowned by everyone at work and by all of my friends.  Everyone thinks he is not good enough for me and that i deserve way better.  They have told me that multiple times.  But i cant seem to get over him.  I've had feelings for him for about 7 months and i have to put an end to it now. what should i do?

20090307095443AAgbXVr	Family & Relationships;Friends	I was hit by a firework in the changeroom!  I fought the girls who did it!?	On Friday was the final volleyball game of the season.  Our school was going up against another school.  So like 1 hour before the game, I was in the change room talking and getting ready.  So I was sitting down.  Then some girls from the other school came in.  They looked around, pretended they were lost and then left.      About 15 minutes later I said that I was going to go get my phone and see my boyfriend.  I was walking to leave and then the change room door opened, and someone threw something in.  It took me like a few seconds to realize it was a firework!  I screamed and I turned around and I was about to run but it went boom and I fell on the ground.  It was one of those ones that explode then after the sparks keep coming out.  My friend Courtney quickly grabbed me and dragged me.      I ran out and I saw two girls laughing and running.  They were like "nice one...BOOM!" and they went out into the gym.  I told my teacher EVERYTHING!  Then I went to the gym and identified the girls who ran and laughed and said boom.  My teacher yelled so much at them and said their team looses automatically.  Then the coach came and yelled at my teacher so much.  The other teacher was like "wheres the proof" and my teacher said that I am human proof of what happened, she showed her the ash and stuff on my leg and she said I saw two girls running.  Then the teacher said I am a wild, wicked s!ut and I am lying!  The teacher said there are no cameras in the hallway so they can't prove anything.  Then they were like "lets start this game" and my coach said hell no, we are not starting this game, a student was assaulted by the opposing team, and our team automatically wins.  We got the entire PE department and they backed us up.      So the other team was waiting for their bus to come.  I dressed up super sexy and I went to the girls and I yelled at them for what they did.  They pushed me and I got so angry I slapped one of them so hard and I kicked the other one and pushed her and she fell onto the ground.  The one I slapped grabbed me and tried to pull my hair but I backhand slapped her and then kicked her shins with my heels.        I ran when I saw their coach coming and I went to the mall and then I saw the school bus and the girls were inside and me and my friend Courtney threw rocks at the bus but then it turned around and came after us so we ran so much.      Should I worry?  And was I did right?

20090307102720AAq5iTe	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Love story advice or something? =(?	I met my boyfriend when I was 12, back in my school when he was still there. I've been crazy about him since I first met him, and 3 years passed and he never cared much about me. He knew right from the start that I liked hm. But he didn't know me that well. And he was already 15 back then. I was way too young. But anyway, I never gave up and I always fought for him. When he moved to another school I was forced to stop trying to get his attention, and we sorta lost contact... But 2 years later, when I was 15 and he was already 18, we started talkin' again, and for the first time in my life he was really interested in me. We started dating and we was the sweetest boyfriend on earth! He'd do me surprises, said he love me all the time, that he wanted to be with me and so one...the usual couple stuff...  Never in my life time (wich is not that much, but whatever - lol), was I so happy. I really love that guy. Of course we had our fights and I somethimes I was a bit abusive with my jealousy. But so on... Almost one year passed and it seemed that I was the most important thing to him, as he was to me. But happens that, somehow I found out that he was talkin' to a girl that he had liked a lot... and he was trying to meet her and stuff. This was the worse thing that ever happen to me. I lost 18 pounds in 3 days (and I'm not kidding) and I cried myself out for at least a week. And I still do... It hurted me so much, that I even changed everything about the way that I used to be. "Dramatic", right... I couldn't believe he'd do such I thing 'cause I really thought I loved me for real. He has always been this weird guy...somethimes I just can't understand him! I said he didn't know if he still loved me, and that he didn't know if he wanted to be with that other girl. .|. (you can't imagine how that hurts AND PISSES THE HELL OUT OF ME)...But anyway, I'd never give him up that easy. So we broke up for a week...and he was still talkin' to her and ****...but I was always beggin him to come back in humilliating myself... till we met again and he did. I'm glad so 'cause I think we're better now. But I can't forget what happend and it hurts me so that I don't know what to do... I don't even know if he still loves me, although now he says e does...and he's with me...and he also said he wasn't talkin to that other girl anymore. But I don't know...some times he doesn't treat me that right... And things changed since that...he's not as sweet as he used to be before... :( (although he looks much better now than he did 2 months ago...by far...)  I'm just scared I may find out he has someone on his mind other than me :( I've always did everything for him...why this? :( this happen like 3 months ago by the way...I'm 16 now, and he's 19 and we're dating for 1 year and some days. What can I do? How can I be sure he really loves me? this is so silly... :(

20090307102828AAEQcHS	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	How do I become less shy?	I don't know why, but ever since I moved to this city around 4 years ago, I've been really shy.  Like, I can talk to the less popular people fine, but when it comes to the hot chicks, or generally the cool guys and chicks, I can't talk to them.  Where I lived before, I could basically talk to everyone fine, but where I live now, it's hard for me to talk to people.

Every time she tries talking to him problems start to occur.  She has tried so many times to break us up spreading rumor about him cheating on me and just talking a bunch of ****.  Months ago i found out he was hanging out with her while i was on vacation behind my back of course he apologized and cut off all ties with her.  Now out of the blue she texts him wanting to let go of there grudged which i understand but this has gone ot talking in class, texting, and even hanging out.  I need to know if i right that i don't want him talking to her? And better yet if i am right i need to know how to make him understand.  Every time i try to talk to him about it he says i am wrong and i don't trust him.  Really I am just uncomfortable about the situation. I have asked friends about this and they all agree with me so now i want to get some outside opinions.  Please help I need lots of advice. Thanks so much!

My boyfriend cheated on me a few days ago and he told me about it the day after. I know if he didn't I would probably never find out. The other day I decided I was going to forgive him because he showed true remorse and his attitude towards everything has changed. We have great chemistry and I think that's why we didn't break up. He knows I will never forget and the pain will never go away. Do you think I did the right thing?

I really really like him. I told him I liked him, he told me that right now he only likes me as a friend, but he might like me later as more than a friend. It usually takes him a while to like girls. His last crush it took him a year to like her. He told me of all the girls he knows he would date me. He thinks I'm pretty, amazing personality, fun to be with, and an amazing friend. So I don't know why he doesn't like me...he just said give it time...but the thing is he doesn't like me, and I don't know for sure he will end up liking me. So while I'm "waiting" do I try and get over him? Or do I just still like him but not expect anything? Or like him? Or ugh i dont know! HELPP! :(

20090307111408AAfcaWB	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Can someone please offer me some relationship advice?	Alright... So here is the situation. It's driving me kinda crazy.      A girl moved to where I live from Ohio... I met her through a mutual friend and man we hit it off... One of those; finish sentences for one another, start singing the same song. It was a connection like none other...      The problem was... Me. I have been or had been single for 5 full years with NO real commitment between. She was extremely loving and kind but I was standoffish and kind of stupid... One day we had a REALLY bad fight. She broke down... and I told her I'd change. I finally felt like she REALLY DID love me and this WAS REAL. So I started returning her kindness... She said she lost our connection. She tried too hard to get me before and now she can't... So we worked together... and finally; another fight happened due to PURE MISCOMMUNICATION via text message. I had no idea she was mad... and said something in jest which really offended her... She freaked and decided she wanted to go home.      Now; she claims her decision is only 2-5% US and is MOSTLY HER. Saying she moved too fast. All that...      But; She loves me. Now were in a situation... and this is where I need advice...      Shes moving on the 16th to go home. Right now. Were broken up but she is claiming she doesn't want to see me date anyone else... She isn't going to either... She needs to just take time to herself... So; I feel like by telling people were still together is a lie... but yet. I want that future.      I'm in love with this girl... and it took me almost losing her fully to realize it. Now; when together she'll still hold my hand but she won't really kiss me as much... Help me here....      Is space all she needs or is she leaving... and not coming back?   I just don't know how to deal with this and nobody has been able to offer advice...

20090307112616AA90R8d	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	How can I get over my Boyfriend's sexual past?	My boyfriend is much older than me (by 10 years). I'm 25, and he's 35. We've been dating for the last 6 months.      The thing is: I have only been with two men in my past, in relationships that were 3 and 4 years long.      My boyfriend, however, was a CRAZY dater before I came along. When he was younger, he slept with as many women as he possibly could. In the last few years, he began "looking for a serious life partner," but because his relationships never worked out, he still slept around during this time.       He has told me that he thinks that he's slept with over a hundred women!       When we first started dating, I made him go to the doctor to be tested for any STDs (I went in with him to talk to the doctor). He turned out to be clean. My boyfriend isn't unintelligent (he has his masters in accounting) and is highly successful. He treats me like a queen, and has never done anything to make me unhappy. We've really integrated our lives together, and I'm thankful to have him in my life. He's told his family (whom I've met) that he wants to marry me, and he's asked me to move in with him.       I want to build a life with him, but every time I'm intimate with him (or whenever we do something amazing, like go rock climbing), I think: "I'm just another one of those women. He's already done all of this."      Because I'm young and inexperienced in dating around, a lot of what I experience with my current BF is new and amazing. But again, I keep comparing myself to the women that he's been with the past.      We've almost broken up a few times over this, because every time one of these women comes back into his life (maybe to just say hi or invite him to a gathering; some of them are even married), I feel this heavy feeling inside of me that tells me he'd rather be with them than me.      How do I get over this, or should I even? What should I do?

I don't understand him. Why wont he ask me out? I don't want to ask him out because it goes against my nature. What's his problem? (Oh, and I know he's not gay)

20090307134156AAEdNUU	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Why DOES LOOKS MATTER?? I always wanted to know but it seem like no one can give me a correct answe?	for example say you find someone attractive you would let them go as far as they willing to take it,    and for someone you dont find all that attractive you hope and pray they touch you.      Im not shallow I dont judge ppl on their looks in life just when sexual attraction comes into play.    It seems  this way to me; When guys know they are attractive they dont push up on you all crazy. When guys are attractive (and they know it)and just they want sexual fun they make it appoint to be all over you and that dont seem that bad. you like the flirt game but you know not to go all the way since he just want one one thing.      Then it's the dude you dont find all that attractive they are the nasty ones, that try to make you feel unatttractive and then want to be all over you or try and disrespect you in different(sexual) ways.         To make it fair Men do you treat attractive girls differently as oppose to unattractive girls like would you spend more money on attractive girl and take her out cause you like her more. and the ones you just want to have sex with you find them.

20090307145801AATnSDo	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Do you think this female is going to call me back?	I was outside and I got this female's phone number that she gave to me. I asked when was a good time to call her and she said anytime is fine. I got home about 3 hours later deciding I'd call her. I talk to her on the phone and she answers, "Hello" I say, "Hey How are you doing this is (my name), and she's like "oh, let me call you right back." She didn't even call me back. I'm upset, I don't want to call her back now. She's got my number on her phone and she said she will call me back if she doesn't then it's her loss. I ain't got time for games. I hate when women do that, and I believe she's one of those type of women. Nothing but a tease! She's going to be shocked that I didn't call her. O.K. so what I called her on the same day but it was 3 hours later and it was only to see what she was doing for the night. I mean....Hell...How am I supposed to do it. Call 3 days later. I did that mess in high school. This girl is older than me, if she's on that then I don't really need her. She said she was calling me right back. She probably won't call back will she? It's been 2 hours now, and she was supposed to be calling me right back. If she doesn't call me back by tonight, it's safe to delete her name and number from my cell phone isn't it?

20090227090522AAdWyd4	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	I am so confused about what to do here...?	Okay...this is going to be long but your advice is really needed.   So I have this friend named, um, lets call him, Tyler. Okay, so my friend Tyler and I have been friends since December/November time. I would always tell him all my feelings, who i like, ask him for advice, that kinda stuff. Then after him and my best friend, lets call her Mandy, broke up...he admitted to me that he liked me. And I realized that I kinda like him too. Except we agreed that we both didn't want a relationship right now. So then got in a big fight, because the last three weeks have been nothing but fighting and one night i was sick of it so I called him and told him I didn't know if we could be friends anymore. And now we're working on it and stuff...but recently he told me that he loves me and that he wouldn't be able to live without me and stuff..except I don't like him like that...only as a friend. I have somebody else in mind to date...but i don't know how to tell him that i just want to be friends, if anything...and then ask out my crush..how do i do this??

20090307145458AAt4pWf	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	How many chances should I give this guy?	Just to start out, we have never gone out, and we're 15. It looks long, but its not that annoying or detailed.      Okay, he has been trying to get to know me for 4 years, and has told me many times that hes liked me and that I was attractive (through texting). Well, we'll say hey every once in a while in person, have a chat, flirt a tiny bit, then all of a sudden we'll stop talking, or rather, he'll stop texting and flirting with me. I definately do admit that I hardly ever initiate conversation or flirting. I'm pretty positive the reason why he stops talking to me is because he thinks I don't like him, but then after a couple weeks or so, he'll start texting me again and be like, "Hey, we haven't talked in a while." Don't think hes a player or anything, its not like he gets girlfriends in between us talking.Anyways, hes probably the most outgoing, rebellious guy I know, and he talks to a whole bunch of girls during the day, but why does he only talk to me and tell me I'm attractive through texting? Why doesn't he talk to me in person like he does the other girls?       So since this guy isn't technically using me, how many chances should I give him? Hes not really hurting me, but I don't want to seem needy or clingy like he can do this all the time to me. I do like him though, and I want to see what can happen.

I had my first time and I hated how stupid I was for overrating it just cuz my friends exagerated about it.      It was not pleasurable at all and no fun. It felt nice but IT DIDNT COVER THe PAIN and NOW I REGRET FALLING FOR PEER PRESSURE. I guess everyone lied about how fun it was cuz there was no pleasure and I think I enjoyed sex more when I was thinking about it. My bf agreed that the making out and foreplay was much funner and I agree too.      IS ALL THIS NORMAL? Sorry but I never want to have sex again, so that technically means I could say I'm a virgin right?
20090227090138AAq0wgn	Family & Relationships;Friends	A college guy stearing at me..after he didn't want to become friends?	I know this is going to be a long story, but I'll make it short.      I'm a college dude.  A couple semesters ago, I tried making friends with this dude in one of my classes.  At first, we were cool.  We talked a little walking out of class and we were almost friends.  But a couple weeks later, all of a sudden he wouldn't look at me anymore.  It was when I asked him if he wanted to hang-out, that he wouldn't look or speak to me anymore.  This dude is 6 foot, real muscular, and he has a football player body.  Girls go crazy over this dude, cause he has abs and huge biceps.  I dont know if he ever played for a football team, but he has the body to.      Well a couple weeks ago, after my afternoon class I went to the library.  As I was walking to the library, this dude (that I tried to make friends with) was sitting on a bench.  He was all by himself, and he looked upset.  I was wearing my New York Giants football jersey.  As I walked to the library, he stared at me..He had to see the football jersey I had on.  I was surprised that he was stearing at me like that.  I got thinking about this a couple nights ago.  What do you think?

20090307123234AAMY3QC	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Did he leave me because he has feelings for another girl?	I had an online relationship I'm in California, he's in Tennesee, we dated 8months, and well I went to see him for the first time on Feb 12th-19th. Everything was perfect, we were each others first EVERYTHING. And now he broke up with me on Sunday, because we weren't connecting, and had a BAD arguement two days ago, I think he likes this girl in his band named Courtney, they're both in band which takes all their time, he thinks shes pretty, he does that "denial she doesnt like meee thing" When it's completely obvious, his voice sounds like its smiling too, and I was on facebook and read this;      is friend Niki said:Teddy dont be stupid ok i know she does lie to your self if you wish, im a girl i know what its like ok your not shes not going to tell you.      Niki:well then go to sleep im sure you will dream of her...      I used to tell him how I hugged other guys, but is that REALLY the reason?       It hurts me to one: Think he likes someone else ands that concerned about it RIGHT after we broke up.          Two: for him to even think I'd cheat on him , after I devote myself so much to him.      Do you think he left me because he likes her? ...   What can I even do, I feel so helpless, why would he have showed me that he loved me when we were together in person, then do this all of a sudden? I thought doing this would stabilize us. I don't know what to do. ._. ps: And she comes right after me on his top myspace friends. >_>"

I am a high school grad, I went to college to for medical assisting and finished. I also am a licensed phlebotomist (someone who draws blood). I currently work as a ambulance dispatcher full time with full medical/dental benefits, which means my child will have insurance too. I also have an AA degree from a community college. I am still in college working towards to a nursing degree. He is looking for work(got laid off, not lazy), and is in school to be a medical assistant , he has about 7 months left to complete the program. I alone have the potential to make about 3,600/month. I still live at home only because my grandparents want me there, I help them out.I have a brand new car which means I will have means of transportation when I have my baby and before. I am not asking you u think I am ready or not, but are there other things that I am not considering. I  will still be able to go to school, after I take time off, because they offer child care, I know it will slow me down a little but I have accomplished a lot since high school, and there is never a PERFECT time to have a child. He also wants a child too!

20090307125556AA2Ds2W	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	How do I become less dependent on my boyfriend?	We're both 20 and have spent almost all of our college years together. We used to see each other nearly every day and it never used to be a problem. But recently we've both become particularly stressed. I suffer from depression while he suffers from anxiety and extreme stress. He always seems to be angry and stressed out, and while I feel like I need to see him more, to make me less depressed, he wants to see me less and he finds it difficult to make time for me. I've learnt to depend on him, emotionally and generally for company. I just end up nagging at him and getting depressed and upset at him for not spending more time with me. I get very lonely and depressed when I'm on my own. But he doesn't have as much time for me as I am prepared to make for him.    I'm scared I'll drive him away. I love him so much. But I've even considered breaking up with him, as I just don't think I can handle being so upset and him being so stressed. I feel like us being together is making us both worse. And with important exams coming up for both of us, maybe it would be for the best?
20090307135834AASoaRA	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	I need help getting over a guy?	So me and this guy have been hooking up for awhile and we started liking each other a lot.  We talked about absolutely everything possible and we answer each others questions and we've had a really close connection.  And he called it quits on me for this other girl (who's not allowed to date yet) and he feels like hes cheating on her b/c he's supposed to be "dedicated" to her according to friends.  And it really hurt me when he was like "If it doesn't work out, then I'll date you."  which makes me the rebound!!  and I'm really heartbroken every time I see him.  Any advice for me to get over him??

20090307151311AARvoWC	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	She told me she's seeing someone but their not dating, what to do (please answer)?	She told me that she been seeing someone a bit. I kind of feel defeated and I don't know whether or not to give up. When I asked if they were dating she said no. Though she admitted that they are a little more than friends (don't know what she means by that though, like are they just fb or what). I guess I kind of showed my hand with that conversation (didn't tell her I like her, but it's obvious). What should I do? And quick advice would be nice. Oh, I should add that this didn't come up because I asked her out. We were talking about something else.
20090307142539AA6KIQB	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	I don't know how to read this girl...?	I'm afraid I'm over thinking the things that she's doing... for some reason, I guess I can't accept the fact that she might just be a shy girl toward guys like me she doesn't know in the hopes that she might have a thing for me. I've liked her almost since the beginning of the school year, we sit right next to each other in history class... Here are some things I've noticed, all MIXED:      -When another friend and I used to talk, she tried to enter our conversations, but we always sort of shrugged her off because she's really quiet and we didn't know if she had actually said anything   -She spends a lot of attention on me when my friend and I talk (could be that she's just interested in the convo, though); she'll consistently do it though   -She'll text a lot during the lecture   -Every time I walk up the row, she'll be staring at me like if I'm walking back to my seat after throwing something away   -However, a few times, she's even glared at me for some reason :x (trust me, we sit next to each other, she doesn't have eye issues)   -Whenever I actually turn my head in her direction to look at the teacher, she isn't looking at me and gets sort of squirmy (I guess I Would too, if a girl I Didn't know started doing that)            So...any insight? Am I probably just over thinking everything and mistaking her for just an ordinary human being? the glaring thing that's going on is throwing me off a bit and making me discouraged   We've spoken before, but it was only polite talk and school-related...
20090307140321AA71W0d	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Do you think im a bad kid like people think i am?	So people think im a bad kid. they have thought this since the fifth grade. and because everyone kind of thought that i started thinking it too. they think im wild and do stuff with boys that i shouldnt and dont get good grades because im bad and drink and do stuff i shouldnt all the time. but i dont. i have tried beer twice. once in eighth grade at my friends family party. we put some of her dads beer in our kool aid lol. then a few months ago with my older brother. but i couldnt take it down so i didnt even finish the head of the bottle. i sometimes talk back to my mom. and i dont get the best grades but i struggle with depression and sometimes feel like nothing matters so i just dont do the work. which i am working hard at. i have kissed a boy once. i dont go out to parties or dances or anything because i dont like them and dont want to be put in a bad situation. i prefer staying at home with my family and doing things with them... we dont ever do anything because my parents arent really into the whole do-stuff-with-your-kids thing but at my dads me and him do stuff a lot because its only the two of us. and thats wat i prefer doing.. but people still think im a bad kid. i dont get it. i may say some stupid things sometimes but i dont think im wild. do i seem wild?
20090307140140AAwpZIe	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Have you ever reach to a point to say enough I want to break up with him?	well I had this feeling lately... he loves me so much but the thing is that I can't talk to him because every time I talk to him he turn it back on me 2 times even more worst and I get the whole blame for everything and I feel 2 times hurt and I wish I never say to him what ever was bothering me.... I try to change my way of talking because I might be the one who actually cause these arguments and still the same. I reach to a point of not telling him anything but I can't keep going on like that even if I know how much he love me. I need an advice

20090227090444AAsODyP	Family & Relationships;Family	What should I get my sister who's turning 14 for her birthday?	She wants a tripod or a demo cd, but I can't afford them. She likes reading, but I don't know what books to look for for her. She's really preppy in clothes and makeup, but she's not really in attitude except for her hair, she won't swim or get sweaty after she's washed her hair. I was also thinking maybe something with singing or guitar because she got a guitar Christmas 2007 but only knows how to play 2 strings. She is also a really passionate singer, and I am too but we're pretty much complete opposites so I don't know what to give her. Thanks :)

20090307132949AAUBWXD	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	TEENAGE boys please answer this!?	Alright, I have this guy I really adore and I think he likes me back but I also think he cares too much about what his friends think about me. I mean, all his "friends" hate me because of me bein atheist. You know, the usual teasin (called a satinist, being hit, bruised, occasionally cut). I kissed him at the Valentines Day Dance at our school and now he doesn't even act like himself anymore! We got into a fight the other day txtin eachother and heres what we said:      Me: Look, im sry for callin u an ***. I dont actuly hate you. Im just getin stresed out cuz your not sendin very clear signals to me here. I mean do you like me or not? One second you're actin like you do and the next you're completely ignorin me!   Him: Huh?   Me: Don't say "huh" like you dunno wat im talkin bout. You did get the txts I sent you erlier rit?   Him: Yeh. So?   Me: Well, im tryin to apologize here! ur strtin to irritate me 2 all get out over one little kiss!   Him: And your point is?   Me: Look, do you rely car dat much bout wat others think? If its Harold (his buddy and my enemy) no one cars wat he thinks!   Him: Dats wat u think.   Me: Then wat is it? Whatever it is, its seriously botherin you and is scarin you so wat is it?   Him; You   Me: ur scared of me? why exactly?   Him: You just do   Me: Be more specific here...   Him: idk   Me: Fine then! Just make up your damn mind alredy! Do you like me, hate me, or am I much more than just a friend? Pik alredy becuz ur strtin 2 piss me off!   Him: (Silent)   Me: Please just tell me. I can take watever it is.   Him: I DONT LIKE YOU!      Now I know thats sounded harsh of him. But the next day at school I was talkin to my friend and he and Harold walk ovr by us. "Ooh Alex, are you still mad? "Are you mad at me Joey" "Am I just a friend or what?!" He just keeps going on and on about wat I said to Joey. So I get mad and stand up. "You showed him?!" I yelled at Joey(the guy I adore) "I spent the night at his house" he replied "He went through my phone when I wasn't looking and saw all the texts you sent me.    Now I think he didnt mean those things because his friends were around.       What should I do to get him to like me more? What would you hope for a girl to do to get you to llike her even more?

But the problem is this....He'll do things like contact me 3 times in one day, or say something absurdly sweet and romantic. Then he'll pull away and I won't hear from him for a couple of weeks.          I really don't understand what he wants. He does things that make it seem like he wants a relationship, but then never follows through.       What do you make of this? Is he just waiting until he sees me in person?

Ok, basically we are on msn and shes talking to her mate and literally atm she is arguing with her about being left out from other mates. From the convos shes been sending me between her and her mate she is in the wrong for whats shes done. Shes asking me for advice on how to help her. How can I help her when I know what shes done is wrong? I can't tell her straight up as we have a long history of bad patches, where we didnt talk for long periods of time, and i dont want that to happen again. thanks.

20090307141223AAeYUwq	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Is he worth this? or should i go on?	(i'm a girl) Okay, so there is this guy and i have REALLY liked him since last year (the beginning of the school yr) We were friends, but then something happened and he knew i REALLY liked him...so we never talked....ever again....my friends got mad at him cause they were almost positive he liked me back, but then he told them that he liked me, but he didn't " like like" me because of my looks.....then he got red and turned around and i was there behind him....then my emotions went haywire and i ran away crying cause we were such good friends and i like him so much....he felt really bad so he tried to say sorry a billion times, but he never built up the courage to say it to my face....this year we never talk even though we see eachother a lot......it seems like he is looking at me whenever i look at him, but it could just be a cocincidence (however u spell it) I had a bf, but i think i stil might like my longer crush more...i keep telling myself to get over it but i can't.....idk why....what should i do?????
20090307133615AAsG9cJ	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Well last night I had sex..?	..for the first time, ever.   Hormones are what started it, and he slipped himself inside of me without a condom at first.  But then he went and got one and he did me again.  Then, He pulled out before he came.  So, do you think I'd get pregnant because he didnt use a condom before hand, but then went and got one, YET pulled out before he came? :|    I'm new to all this stuff now.
20090307122430AAPbiTb	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Can... somebody help me?	I've been with my boyfriend for a month...      He's 18, I'm 16, and... He's more experienced in "certain" areas, if you catch me...      Recently, as in, yesterday, he mentioned he hadn't had sex for six months and he was really frustrated, I laughed it off saying "I can't miss what I've never had!!", and I'm slightly worried, I mean, he's never forced me into anything, and he doesn't seem like the kind of guy to... (Although his ex-girlfriend says he did "try" once, although I don't believe her, because he's so kind and nice, and she's a liar, and she's done it before, and she lied to my brother as well.)      But, I wonder if maybe, he'll slightly resent me if I don't do anything for a while... Because, I'm a virgin, and obviously, he's not.      I mean, I don't want to do anything until I fully trust that he'll stay with me, when I do let him...      But, I guess, my question is, what do you think?      I mean, does it seem like he only wants me for sex? I'm not quite sure...      And, if you're a boy, what would you do in this situation, if you were my boyfriend?      And, girls, what would you all do, if you were me?      Thanks, everyone :]      ?

I have had crushes before, but i was able to convince myself I didn't like them, and it went away. But this new guy, I've tried so hard to not like him, but it doesn't work. Even after the rumors I heard about him (negative rumors), I still like him and find myself thinking about him all the time.               I really honestly tried to not like him, but I can't. It's like trying to stay awake with no caffeine for three days and nights straight. I just cave in, and it's hard.           So my question is, is there anything wrong with me, and if not, what is it? If it helps, I'm turning 15 this Fall.           Thanks to anyone that leaves an unsarcastic response!!!!!!!! :-)

20090307132511AAsbAd7	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	How can i get over my hatred of women?	Ok i know i have a problem with women over the years due to not getting dates when asking them out, or hanging out with women when i ask to just lets go to the movies, so now i am just so fed up with them not giving me a chance and dont careless for them.. Anyways, last week i was with a friend who acrouse is a jerk to his girlfriend, i was driving them home from school and they started arguing in the back seat to the point when he started to hit her in the face a couple of times and broke her nose it really didn't faze me as i didn't even turn around to help her as she cried and was kicking and screaming, because i just didnt give a damn about women at the time. And there was another time where i was walking home from the fun park and saw a guy, which i know i would beat him to death with me being 6'8 258 pounds and him very small hitting and kicking his girlfriend because she locked the key in the car. He basically beat her into the ground as i just passed by and look and kept on walking with saying anything because i just didnt care about saving her and watching this Rihanna crap i guess it is true that women like jerks, so should i continue being a jerk?

20090307151509AAtonT6	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Help, shy girl and I really like her..?	Well, I have been talking to this girl for about 2 weeks now. On MSN/Face book/Text messages etc, and we get on reasonably well we are both quite flirty.       Well, I met up with her Friday night and she was with her friends at a GIG.. She was very "shy" around me when she saw me/came over and said "Hi" and everything.       I'm a little shy myself, and I get a little bit "gutty and quite" when her friends are around her etc.       It seems like I can only really talk to her 1on1 for now, and she is like she wants to be around her friends and talk.       So literally we Said "hi" on friday, had a little talk about things. Hugged her once, said goodnight.       He friends told me that she talks about me "alot" at school/college. And that she likes me, but she is very shy around me....      But when we talk on msn/facebook/txt she seems fine.       She even said that she misses talking to me, and was sorry for leaving early on Friday night.      So we text's the morning after, the usual how are you etc.. Asking questions out of randomness. She said she was in the city today, and that after she wanted to meet up with me for a "walk/stroll" and talk.       She knows she is shy around me, and I get a little shy because she is shy... You see the problem?       Well, I met up with her at around 7 today up the town Centre and I met her friends, I said "hi" how you doing, what you been up too :)?, get anything nice.. You know being the casual type of person.. Her friends are talkative, once spoken too. So I tried to spark up a conversation with the "shy girl" I like and she just seems to feel awkward around me, and im finding it really tough to say something/interact with her so I can gain her trust..      So one of her friends had to go, so we walked her back to the taxi drop off point until she went.       Then we decided to goto the Park, so we walked to the park, gently talking/confronting her about what to talk about. Once we got to the park, we went to the swings.. Sat down and started to talk about things.       Her other friend, had to use the phone so she wondered off leaving us 2 on the swings, awkward I know!       But I really want to get to know this girl and become more than a friend to her.       So I said, like " how you doing, bought anything nice today? " Her replying blankly and dull like "yeah, I got this and that". Being shy.       After a bit of talking, I asked her.. How Do I get to know you more, how can I gain your trust so we can talk... She didn't really know, and kept being shy...       Anyway, her friend came back and she needed to go home. So we walked back to the "shy girls(who i like)" house and we went in to be picked up / talk.       After her friend went, it was just me and her.. In literally, utter silence. So I said " Would you like to go upstairs, and talk a bit" because her brother was in the room at the time. And she was like " You have seen what my room is like, a compelte mess " Let's talk out in the kitchen.      So we walked to the kitchen and I said something like, " You are quite shy I can see, would you like a hug " and she literally walked into my arms and had a little hug..       So I said I should be moving on home as it is getting late, so I got my stuff and said goodbye, and hugged her again to say good-bye. She was still being shy..       I wasn't quite sure at the time, and I said " Could I do something else" and she was like " no"  I was like ok (Smiled) and said talk to you later ill let you know when I'm home.      So I started to walk home, and she text me saying "what did you want to do" I replied " I wanted to peck you on the cheek x", no response... When I got home I told her I was home, logged onto msn and said       Me: Hey, did you get my text's   Her: yup   Me : Alright   Me: Sorry if I, confronted you a bit.. I don't want you to feel iffy around me x I thank you for letting me come out tonight :).. x   Her: loooooooooooool   Me: ??   Her: Just funny   Me:Ok, im heading for the shower.. talk to you later x   Her: i wont be on so bye   Me: :] bye bye x   Her: Bye      *after shower*      Text:   Me: You okay?   NO RESPONSE   Me: Night, talk to you later x   NO RESPONSE      (IM STUCK HERE NOW WRITING IT OUT, now I feel sick and tired)      Have I blown it? I really like this shy girl, and I don't want her to be shy around me.. Iv'e confronted her too much and I don't know what to do...      I really like her, and she said to her friends and myself that she really likes me also...       Did I push it too far? Have I lost her?   :(      Thanks,      Sam x

20090227085901AA4lMsW	Family & Relationships;Family	I think my BF's brother has a thing for me!!?	I live with my BF and his older brother sometimes comes over and just hangs out here. Yesterday I was getting out of the shower and I could hear he was still in the room next to me and I was waiting for him to leave but I waited 10 minutes and he didn't leave so I was just going to hurry and get into my room and when I open the door is see's me and starts walking out staring at me so  I go back into the bathroom and he goes but he was just gawking at me when I was trying to walk out. And when I 1st moved in he came over for dinner and we were making fajitas me and my bf and I asked my bf if he wanted more cheese then I asked his brother and he said I can put cheese in his tortilla anytime and he always tried talking with me when my bf isn't around and always offering to do things for me and when my BF is around he will make fun of him or get mad for no reason like he's tries picking fights on him when I am around and tries to point out my bf's flaws.

20090307135131AAHTzYJ	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Is it worth the trouble?	A guy played me and my friend at the same time but we didn't know. After this the guy started telling his friends and anyone who cared to listen lies about me or my friend, like he never liked us and we are bitches etc.    Now that we both know ((me and my friend) want to confront him together. My only fear is that sometimes people like that are so messed up that it doesn't matter what anyone tells them but I feel he should know he can't just play people and then lie about them behind their backs! Any advice? Thanks!

Ok, so guys, let's say you are shy and really like a girl and are watching a movie with her at your place. If you finally work up the courage to hold her hand, how would you like her to react to show she likes you back? Basically what would make you feel all warm and fuzzy inside? Should she turn to you and smile, not do anything, put her head on your shoulder, WHAT?

I'm 18 years old and I have never been kissed by a girl and I have been ignored by a girl every time and everywhere I go.   Girls around me and girls that are in the same race with me, they stare at me like I'm a freak or I don't belong. They don't asked me If I had a girlfriend or anything. I feel like they are judging me based on my looks and that's not fair. I have tried to talk to them but they just ignore me. No matter what I can't get a girl to like me. I feel like the reason they don't like is because the size of my head. If I was in a different race and had a smaller head then girls would like me and respect me

20090307123704AAHxNJ4	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Why would my girlfriend do this to me?	Me and this girl were dating for a good 3 years over the internet. We dated often when her father came through my state, and we talked for a little over 8000 hours on the phone.   I knew everything about her. I knew exactly what to say to make her laugh, smile, and best of all, to make her happy. We told each other that in a few months she could transfer to my state so we could begin college together. We talked every night at 9, and the relationship, in my opinion, would be perfect.   Her father said he would move to my state shortly after she graduates high school (3 more months). So, I knew then that she would be perfectly happy moving near me.   This past valentines day she admitted to cheating on me and I still haven't gotten over it yet. Everyone keeps telling me "move on, there's someone better for you," but I just cannot see that happening. Since I love and cherish everything about her, I cannot simply replace her with another girl. I would do anything and everything to have her back.   I cannot go to sleep sometimes because of this. I have tried moving on and dating other girls, but things just aren't the same. I can't feel the same "spark" as I did with my past girlfriend.      I feel very stuck at the moment. There is a chance of her coming back, because she admits to still having feelings for me and contacts me often. I do forgive her for cheating on me. I understand that she is about to start college and has a big future ahead of her, and having a loved one who is distant doesn't do much good for her.       What should I do? Should I move on and forget her? What if she comes back?

Its just not right anymore>>Why are they so b*tchy?	i have quite alot of hasstle at home from my mu (she stays sometimes) so i live with my nana. She is really, really strict and does not let me do anything. I relise it must be hard for her having to bring up her grandchild and she doesnt want me to make the same mistakes as my mum but any way   because im never aloud to stay at friends houses, go down town, have friends over, go to parties.. my friends just stop asking me.   i never get invited anywhere even though sometimes i could go.   at school they all laugh and joke about whats going on etc but i never know as i am never there.    also my firends have changed greatly. They all used to be really fun understanding etc but now most of the smoke (3 of them have been smoking for about 2years) they are really b*tches alot of people who i dont hang around with but are good friends with say the hate how they think they are better then everyone else. i am always the one not told things but yet i am expected to tell everything about me. i just dont feel the same around them anymore. Its like i havent changed over the past few years (like ive become more mature) where as they act like they have grown up but really they are just being immature and stupid. alot of them lie about everything and like have private jokes and makes the rest of us (especially me) feel uncomfortable. Alot of them act all hard even though they are not most are all over boys getting with anyone they can with bright orange faces   i just miss the way it used to be   why have they changed so much?   how can i get my nana to let me out more (btw i always do the house work and i make dinner 3 times a week for everyone) so i help her alot?   how can i join in more ( i am not going to start smoking and being bitchy tho)   or should i just try and find new friends?   will they ever change back to how they used to be?   thanks

20090227091734AACcK1H	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Is there something wrong with my sexuality?	Since puberty, I've never really had the expression of sexual desire. When ever I've had sex, it just was; there was nothing particularly special about it.    I've went to doctors, had my hormone levels tested and everything biologically with me is fine. I could care less if I have a relationship (I've been with both men and women- to verify that I'm not either gay/hetero) and thus far... nothing. I feel so unfulfilled inside- especially when my friends are either dating, having kids, or married.   I want to know why I don't experience sexual desire.
20090307140528AAaHyd5	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	I don't know how to read this girl... ughh?	I'm afraid I'm over thinking the things that she's doing... for some reason, I guess I can't accept the fact that she might just be a shy girl toward guys like me she doesn't know in the hopes that she might have a thing for me. I've liked her almost since the beginning of the school year, we sit right next to each other in history class... Here are some things I've noticed, all MIXED:      -When another friend and I used to talk, she tried to enter our conversations, but we always sort of shrugged her off because she's really quiet and we didn't know if she had actually said anything   -She spends a lot of attention on me when my friend and I talk (could be that she's just interested in the convo, though); she'll consistently do it though   -She'll text a lot during the lecture   -Every time I walk up the row, she'll be staring at me like if I'm walking back to my seat after throwing something away   -However, a few times, she's even glared at me for some reason :x (trust me, we sit next to each other, she doesn't have eye issues)   -Whenever I actually turn my head in her direction to look at the teacher, she isn't looking at me and gets sort of squirmy (I guess I Would too, if a girl I Didn't know started doing that)            So...any insight? Am I probably just over thinking everything and mistaking her for just an ordinary human being? the glaring thing that's going on is throwing me off a bit and making me discouraged   We've spoken before, but it was only polite talk and school-related...

20090307144913AAnaK1g	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Should I date a girl who is way out of my league?	I have known this girl for two years now and have always been completely smitten with her.  She is just amazing.  However I've always been too shy to act on my feelings for her (even though they've increased and increased).  Instead we've been really good friends.      However she has just told me that she likes me and I don't know what to do!  She goes away for a month tomorrow, but said she had to tell me the way she felt before she went (a big deal for her as she is shy too).  She said it would give me time to decide without being pressured.  She said that she begun to like me after I was there to help her after a guy broke her heart.  She said that she can't stop thinking about me.  But that if I wanted to just be friends that too would be fine with her.  She said she just had to let me know how she felt.      I have always wanted to date her, to be her boyfriend, to be the one to hold her and kiss her, but I feel she is out of my league, and not just physically.      -I live at home with my violent father and have never had a stable home-life.  He is an alcoholic and never works.   -She lives with her wealthy family with an adoring family (father especially).      -I am working to support my mother and sisters, while studying part-time at my local college.   -She is waiting to go to university.      -I am shy, almost introverted, with only a few close friends.   -She, although shy at first, is bubbly and popular.  Quite adorable really.      -I'm 19, 6ft 8 and 19 stone (all muscular btw).  I have never had a girlfriend, only once casually dated a girl who messed me about, and am still a virgin.   -She is 19, about 5ft3 and tiny.  She has had boyfriends and has slept with 2 guys (the latter information I only know because of our close friendship).      -She is this bubbly girl, full of fun and laughter who is hardly ever angry or upset.   -I am guy with low self-esteem (as you can probably tell by this question) who has serious baggage.      I don't want to bring her down or destroy her innocence.  Yet I know I will be good for her.      I will protect her, make her laugh, and just be there for her.  A more intense form of the relationship we have at the moment.      I've always wanted to be with her, but now that I've got the chance I don't know what to do.      Should I date her? Or should I just remain friends with her?  Can I do that when both of us have a crush on one another?      Is she out of my league?  Would dating her be selfish considering my personal problems and home-life?  (If you want to know more about that just look a previous question of mine)      What should I do?  Please please help.         sorry for the long question, but I just don't know what to do

20090307123235AAjiQJk	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Yea i know.. DO YOU THINK HE LIKES ME?	***REALLY LONG!!!***   so i like this guy and i think he likes me back, but not to be conceited or anything. i guess we have "weird history"? [long story].  anyways, i was going somewhere for lunch then he saw me and blocked my way. he punched me in the stomach in a joking way and i tried to get away from him because i was not in a good mood. when i tried to get past him, he wouldn't let me. so i guess we ended up talking on that spot. our conversation: "oh yea you're not in blabla anymore huh?" "yea i switched out" "you know mr. blabla told me yesterday that he didn't want you to switch out..?" "really?" "yea.. i guess he likes you" then when he said this i got confused so i said "ohh really? well i don't really like him..." "you don't? so he likes you but you don't like him?" "i guess.." "that's a good thing though. you can use him for recommendations for college". after talking, i remember i almost hung out with him this one time at lunch, but i chickened out. so i thought to myself, 'JUST ASK HIM TO GO WITH YOU!!' so i asked him if he could go with me to the lunchline. he said "yea after i get my food from my locker".       so we're almost to his locker and he asks, "so how are youuu?"   me: "i'm good i guess.. (i was gonna ask how he was doing but he already said something)   him: no you're not..   me: what? yea i am      then we get to his locker. i lean into the side of the locker waiting for him. he was kind of fumbling with it and i sensed he was nervous so i looked away. then all of a sudden he asked, "do you know why i walk slow....?" i thought he was gonna say something about me and i realized i wasn't ready for anything so i started feeling REEEALLY nervous and avoided looking at him. i asked "why?" but i guess it was too soft. so he asked again but just stares at his lock, "you know why i walk slow now? remember i used to walk fast in middle school? but i don't anymore?" *then we look at each other for a few seconds. me: "yea... why?" him:"cause i realized i took walking for granted... i appreciate it now.............. when you run you appreciate walking..."then we walk to the lunchline. he asked me if i always get food then i said sometimes. he was like, "you should bring food from home. it's easier. YOU KNOW'M SAYIN?" haha that was funny. he also said,"i'm just gonna walk you to the line.." then i begged him not to go. he looked at me but i kept looking ahead. he had to go to this one dude. bleh. we get closer to the line and he was like "why aren't you hanging out with your girlfriends?" he said 'girlfriends' kind of hard.. idk. then i said,"idk.. i don't really feel like it." "why?" "idk.." "why? DID SOMETHING HAPPEN? tell me tell me." then we got in line and he said,"the line is long" me (quietly):"it moves fast." he stayed with me for a couple of seconds and left to look for the guy that needed him. he said something before he left and said "Love you" really loud. i just said "bye" quietly. do you think he likes me? and do guys usually do that to a girl? i'm just curious because i don't want t be in over my head. thankyou very much. i know it was SUPER long. thankyou

20090307133658AAoYQNo	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	I'm causing my boyfriend to be disrespectful to his parents and causing him to be grounded.?	We go to different schools. He is a junior, i am a freshman. He is only a year and a half older, so he is technically a sophomore, but is kinda smart. His grades now, matter more than mine, and his parents are strict and middle eastern (nothing bad, they just technically are stricter with grades and education). I guess his mother saw that he had a C+ in History, and she freaked, and she wouldn't let him explain that he just turned in his homework's and a paper and that it should go back up to a 90%. They started to argue, and kind of lost it, and told her to shut up, and he felt extremely bad about it (as he was telling me) because he hates being disrespectful to his parents. He almost convinced his mother today, and she said to talk to his father who said he already made the decision. They told him, "You are spending to much time with this girl. Letting her distract you from your main priorities," So now i cant see him in till next weekend, and its killing me. Anything i can do???
20090307144247AA9Am2v	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Do you think he is to good for me? (Pictures!)?	Okay. I know what ur thinking. Just rate both of us and give me your opinion. He is a junior, me a freshman. I think my friends are thinking when they saw a picture of him and some met him, "Wow he is too hot for you." They didn't say that, but all my friends think he is extremely hot. I just feel so ugly around him, i don't know why he likes me. Be honest...      My boyfriend:       http://i296.photobucket.com/albums/mm176...        http://i296.photobucket.com/albums/mm176...        http://i296.photobucket.com/albums/mm176...

20090227090904AAsHWh9	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	What would U do if your hubby has brought up divorce twice?	My friend's husband had brought up the subject of divorcing her twice. The first one is 7 years ago and the next one is just last year.  She is very upset about it. They decided to give each other one year trial period to give a go for their marriage and see if it could work again or else they will split. One year had passed but the husband never brought up the subject again.  But this subject bothers her.  Should she pretend nothing happens or bring out this matter and discuss with him. Sometimes she find it hard to forgive an unfaithful husband who kept chasing other girls  and always left the wife alone with the children.

He always has to be the center of attention      2nd guy, is blonde hair blue eyed guy, still a troublemaker, bossy, really funny, makes me feel good about myself, by complementing me.                I think guy #1 is hotterrr by far but which one do you think? I wear ed hardy, also. Like personality wise i am loud with friends, but quiet with guys. I can be pretty bossy, too. Which guy is right for me??
20090307123809AA5H0uu	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Scared of Dating. help!?	I've never actually been in a real relationship before, boys have asked me out, but im scared?
20090307130249AArJCCa	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Oh god, i'm so f*cked...?	so this guy i've been dating for about two months is part of my main circle of friends, which is mostly made up of guys. i just like hanging out with guys more, they're funnier and less annoying. so the problem is that i don't think i really have feelings for the guy anymore, and i am afraid that if i break up with him the other guys i hang out with won't treat me in the same way because they were friends with my bf before me. oh and he is either in love with me or really really likes me a lot, i don't want to break his heart and seem like a *****, it's not my fault i don't like him, but i don't think the others will see it that way.       sorry this is so long but i should probably add that if i do break up with him he will probably be shocked because he thinks i am in love with him or also really like him
20090307150644AAGTL3X	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Do guys like girls who aren't afraid to make a fool of themselves?	I'm a crazy person who likes to make my own fun and be a complete idiot at times. But i hate it when guys always give me weird stares. It's not my fault I'm confident with who I am. I usually shake it off. But I'm really wondering. I'm crazy, but that doesn't give them the right to automatically judge me. Do I intimidate them or somethig?

20090307133822AA7Ui5Y	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Whats the story with him? Would it work?	Noel asked me to hang out with him last Sunday so he can show me the social world because he thinks I am too sheltered at home.He said my social life is poor and I should have to plan events or occassions. I text him once saying I don't like flings but don't mind passionate kisses so last Sunday he text offering to give me a kiss which he said he was good at. he insisted we hang out so he persuaded me, After alot of chatting he looked at me in fascination and said I don't believe this I am starting to get into you and I wasn't before but I am now. Noel is my sisters friend. He offered to give the kiss but I rejected him, then later he explained that I shouldn't worry about the result of the kiss or the consequences and that frienship is first anyway, He tried to kiss me again and I kept turning my head thats when he asked why, and I said I don't know I am scared, He said he thinks I am very cool and now wants to be with me and we ended up snogging in the end. In the taxi he said we will hang out again.He said when ever he is in sligo town again and we can go to a waterfal or cinema. That night he send me a few texts saying – (1st text) Goodnight. Sorry for kissing you, (2nd) text Dunno why I am into you. Cant be described sometimes.x, (3rd text) I liked the kiss but I feel like I was on my own. That’s why I said sorry. I don’t say sorry to pple that love kissing me, but he text me a few days later saying he is still inlove with his ex and that hey were thinking about getting back together. He doesn't think I am bord but said I text way too much and that we may hang out next week.He also said he doesn't regrest kissing me that night and he kissed my neck, wrapped his arms around me and carresed my hair as I lay falling asleep on his shoulder. He believes that there is only one woman for him and he only likes cool women.He said he wanted to be with me and earlier he said he doesn't want his ex back. He is single but he is in touch with his ex who he may get back with. What chance have I got??? What should I do??? Will I ever see him again??? That sunday night we always me eye contact.Don't forget he was the guy who asked me to a picnic and he actually asked me to hang out with him for an hour a few weeks before last week but I told him it is too much of a short notice but I would like to hang out with you maybe another time so I didn't turn him down last sunday. wb

We've known eachother for about 2 years and we finally got together. Shes very beautiful though, She has an extremely nice body and everything about her is (Not to seem conceited) but shes almost perfect. Thats what I'm afraid of.

He's rarely on cuz i dont think his parents allow him to have it but he only goes on his firends account when hes at his friends house. Well Ive known him for many many years so its not like i dont know him. This is because we went to elemtary school together and now were in grade 9.  hes just so awesome and says really cute things to me. For example. This year on valentines day he was like so you doing anything with anyone tonight? i was like no, no one really asked me... Hes like seriously? Wow those guys are really missing out on something amazing.maybe not the exact words but It was something like that. This guy is beautiful and i know Its all genuine because i havent heard him say this stuff to anyone else. The thing is I feel out of his league... I really cant get him out of my head, he visited my school the other week(we dont go to the same school) I didnt know he was coming but when we locked eyes it was like a movie...really. anyways what can i do to see if hes actually interested into just hanging out? I really want to get to know him on a diffrent level.    Oh and..   I DONT MEAN OUT OF "HIS LEAGUE" AS IN IM TOO GOOD FOR HIM.   I MEAN AS IF HES TOO GOOD FOR ME!!!!!

20090227091105AARuanR	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	Relationship advice help needed lazy husband?	I would really like some advice genuine advice. I have been married 4 months and with my husband 3 years. I guess we jumped into things too fast too young, we have 2 children and are feeling the stress. I have just come to a point I am finding it really hard to like my husband. he has lost his job and since then I find him incredibly lazy, for example today I have washed the kids, done the school run, done all the laundry, cleaned the hole house top to bottom, minded the kids fed them, done all the dirty nappies etc and minded them even when I had a bath.  I asked him to pay some bills and he literally took all day even going missing for 2 hours and not answering his phone, he wanderd off to the library and the barbers. I have no problem with him doing whatever he wants he is a grown man, but I think he should have had a little consideration not to disappear and not even text me to tell me he would be delayed. Then he makes me feel like I should have to tell him when I will be back when I go for a walk in the evening ( he doesnt say anything but he does be in a strop). I really dont want to be intimate with him. I feel that he's neglectful, he doesnt care, and I know its bad but I feel like he is the biggest waste of space even though I love him and want it to work. He never shows affection, only gropes me when hes up for it, does inconsiderate things like dissappears and tells me hell be back in 5 and not come back for an hour and half.  He leaves me to do eighty per cent of all the work, he leaves me to sort out all his and our finances, hes put us in debt from losing his job, hes lazy and only helps out the odd time, usually hell make and effort for a day after I have a major moan, I am blue in the face telling him how I feel and telling him he's damaging our relationship and that I dont feel like I love him romantically anymore, I dont know what to do? what should I do? there is absolutely nothing that works with him it's one ear and out the other, I want him to change because I dont love him like I used to, I cant even like him sometimes but I want it to work, any advice?

20090307144404AARpZwd	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Ladies, after a really good first date?	I went on a first date with this girl last night that i met at a fundraiser. We had an awesome time, and during our drinks at the lounge i took her to, she said we should see a movie sometime. I told her i was all for that, the rest of the date, we really hit it off common interests, some great flowing conversation got a little touchy but didnt go in for the goodnight kiss.      Now, I dont wanna come off as needy or desperate so should i bother texting her or something before i call her again? She knows I had a great time, so i dont see any point in stating it again in a text, or what else should I say???    i figure i'll give her a call tomorrow evening then go from there, but i'm not sure if this is the best way to go about this?      any help?

20090227091857AACQoGv	Family & Relationships;Family	I need advice about an alcoholic family member?	I have a close family member who is an alcoholic. This person has many issues but one of them is that they always have to be the center of attention. If they aren't the center of attention they will do something to make sure the focus always shifts to them. I have witnessed this behavior at a wedding, a funeral and countless family functions. It always begins with too much alcohol because "it's a party"  and ends with this person either becoming belligerent and making a scene or crying and lamenting about their life. Of course the blame never lies with this person, they just have so many things wrong and so many people have wronged them that they have to drink (I'm being sarcastic here!). You also can't say anything to this person without getting them defensive and angry, they talk over you and won't let you finish a sentence. I am having a big family function soon and not inviting this person is not an option, as I said it's a very close relative. I am terrified of what will happen. We have many friends and my spouse's family coming and I would be mortified if any of them witnessed this behavior. I'm not being a snob, we have all tried to be understanding and help but there is a limit to what we can do.I love this person dearly but they are already talking about going out to a bar, drinking etc. I am at my wits end, I don't know how to handle this. Should I do a preemptive strike and warn everyone ahead of time or just say nothing and hope for the best?

BTW I'm in 10th grade and there's another girl in the same grade as me....so yeah.       She's kind of outgoing when she's with her friends, but really shy when she's by herself.      Yesterday in school I was in the hallway and she was coming towards me by herself, there was no one else in the hall and it was almost for sure we would cross paths...but she looked hesitant at first and then took a right into another hallway...         So thats what I'm asking, if you liked a guy...would you "avoid" him if you were shy?      Plus, how can I get her if she's so shy. I'm not sure if she likes me though, so I don't want to be too cocky I guess, but it's hard to talk to her cause I'm not friends with any of her friends, and I usually never see her.      But I have talked to her before.

(i know pathetic), but i told him could still be friends.           after a while of  unresponded emails and comments, i decided to call him. i thought he was mad at me. we talked for a while and he told me he had met someone new. he was was going to ask her out on valentines day. i felt awful. now i realized it was a stupid mistake i dont know what to do. should i fight to get him back or just let him go?   i love him sooooo much.       thax for  reading   :)

20090307135656AA6VvrJ	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Does she like me back or am I reading her signals wrong?	I know this girl for about a month now and we talk almost every day after class on our way to our dorms. And we got together a couple times outside of class to study and get lunch afterwards.       When I first asked her out on a date she said yes at first but when I asked if she was sure she said that she "kind" of have someone and that it is "really weird" between them. When I asked her to clarify she wouldn't elaborate and just said her life was really complicated and she isn't even sure whats going on. So I got the "not right now" but "I'll keep thinking about it." response.      So I dropped it and and left the issue alone but we continued to talk everyday after class as if I haven't asked her out. For the last few days she seemed to be a bit different when we talk. She would laugh a lot more and and give me really random details about her plans for the weekend and started telling me things about her family.       I'm just really confused if she likes me back or not. She is really shy and innocent so idk if her initial response was just her way of outright rejecting me. Should I ask her to clarify her feelings again or just keep talking to her and perhaps move on?

It seemed as though he liked me a little because when other girls were around he wouldn't ask them anything (he would always turn to me). Then there was a school dance and I asked him to dance and he said yes and first he was kinda joking around by putting his arms on my shoulders, but then he put them on my waist. It was amazing for me because it was my dream come true. Then when I went back to school he totally ignored me and this happened about 3 or 4 weeks ago. But he is still kinda ignoring me. I try to text him but that's it. He won't look at me in school or anything. Do you think he hates me now? I know hes never had a girlfriend before but he turns his head when I walk by or and stuff. He isn't shy around other girls either, hes like really outgoing and stuff but I don't know at all what to do. Any advice?

20090307141312AAkP5Ig	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	GIRLS, how would you react?	I'm thinking about going up to this girl in my class who I never talked to before. I plan on talking to her after class. She knows im in her class so its not like she doesnt know i don't exist. Anyways, if I said this to her would it work? "Hey, i'm in your class and I know you really dont know me that well but I was wondering if you wanted to maybe get lunch sometime"      I know a lot of you are going to say sounds good but maybe I should talk to her a little before but I just want to do this first, and then depending on her answer, i'll talk to her. So for example, if she says yes ill say okay cool sounds good, and then continue the conversation to get to know her after i asked her for lunch. kind of working backwards but im more comfortable this way. plus its just lunch so its not like a serious thing

20090307134125AAanR8n	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	I can't understand this boy! Help?	We've been talking and dating for about a month. We're 17 years old. And he's really sweet and it's obvious we have feelings for each other. Thursday we were at the park and he kissed me. I'm the second girl he's ever kissed so he's not very experienced in the relationship field. Here's the problem, he'll never ever text me first. Once I text him he has no problem texting and calling me sugar and babe and telling me how he wants to hang out and how he loves when were together. It drives me nuts though! I don't know what to do. I was thinking about waiting until after the weekend is over and if he doesn't text me or call me or IM me I'll confront him about it Monday. Is that the right thing to do? Why do you think he does this? Shy? Uninterestedd? Afraid of being clingy? I justdidn'tt know!

We're nor REALLY good friends, but we joke around sometimes. Some days, he flirts with me and walks with me and my friends to class, and others he doesn't pay much attention. One day, he asked me to sit next to him, and we talked all calss period, but i don't know if he was just bored and wanted someone to talk to (none of his friends were around) or if he wanted to be near me. I'm not that serious about him, but he can be pretty sweet. We went on a field trip one time, and he took my cell and tried looking through my texts... he does little things like that. I'm really shy, so how do i let him know that i like him without really saying it?

20090307141228AA7lVR7	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	My bf has been rly depressed lately idk y, neither does he. what should i do to help him?	My boyfriend has been so upset lately, it kills me to see him like that. Idk what to do.   The other day we were talking and he almost broke up with me, he said he wasn't good enough. I was heated once that happened and cried all day over it. I could hear him crying on the phone when i called him. And I knew he was crying over what happened. He never lets nobody know what hes feelin or that hes crying so it was a lot for him to cry with me and admit to it. At the end of the conversation he said he was so depressed and upset that he was just hurting me and that he didnt know if he loves me, cause he finds it hard to be happy or love things now that hes going through so much psychologically, he said he wants to be with me but he doesnt want to hurt me. I told him id be there for him and that i love him. I really do want to help him, but i dont know what to do. Later that day though we were talkin about what made him happy when he was younger, we shared our childhood memories and stuff. it was great. and we were talking about movin in together. we are very young, but we do think we could spend forever together. and movin in would help both of us, cause we both go through a lot of problems at home. we have been through a lot, please dont judge us by our age. hes 17 and im 16.    I'm so confused, i want to help, and i think moving in together might help a little. Please help, idk what to do.

20090227091106AA1SvCf	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	Did i hurt her, on unheal her pain?	My ex fiance (!), told me that she was virgin. I did not believe that and started questioning her. We did not trust each other and broke up. She never admitted the truth. After a while, I got an email from her ex bf, telling me the details... Even though, I was right about my concerns, I felt sorry for her. All I wanted was to hear the truth from her, not from others. I did not blame her for anything. After I learned the truth, I said " it is okay" to her, but she doesn't want to come back. She says " I hurt her feelings".   How did I hurt her? By being smart and not believing her lies? It was my right to ask her past, as she asked millions of questions.    Why doesn't she come back?  Did I hurt her by questioning, or by reminding her past?

20090307131612AAbZSvP	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	What Would A Relationship At This Age Be Like?	My boyfriend went out with this girl from when he was 16 til he was 20.      I find it a little strange to have such a long relationship when you are so young, because I find that those 4 years are the times you really want to experiment and see what you want.      I was just wondering what a relationship of someone from when they are 16-20 might be like? Sure, it's 4 years, but could it really have been that serious? Would it be more like 'puppy love' or just a hormonal teen sex-filled relationship, or is it possible that they had a strong, mature, loving relationship?      Also, now that he is older, will his relationship with me (and others after me) be different to that of his relationship when he was 16-20?      Just curious :)

20090307122427AAsenFf	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Why is my life like a bad soap opera?	There is this amazing girl that I asked out a few months ago. She said no and I have tried to retain a respectful distance since then. We have spoken on occasion since but not like before and lately we have been rather annoyed at each other and haven't spoken at all and in fact gone out of our ways to avoid each other. I saw her yesterday for the first time in several weeks and she made a point of saying, well yelling across the room really, good bye to me. Why won't she just leave well enough alone? What does this mean?
20090307122531AAPJQB8	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	The girl I'm seeing is upset with me and says she doesn't want to see me right now, what should i do?	This girl is so amazing and I really like her, but I guess I'm bad at showing it. We were talking one night and I told her that I won't be able to see her for a week. She instantly assumed that I'm not interested in her and became very depressed. I wasn't sure how upset she was, but I wanted to make her feel better. Apparently the next day I found out she had taken a bottle of sleeping pills and was just very sad. Her friends called me and tried to ***** me out, which I wasn't concerned about. I still want to go out with her, but I'm not sure she's going to be interested in me anymore. I tried to see her at her job and she told me she didn't want to see me and that she'll call me. All I can do is wait, but I feel like by not trying to make her feel better she'll just think I'm ignoring her, and that I'm insensitive. She also told me she thinks I'm not trying to have a serious relationship with her, when in fact I just wanted to take things slow.       BTW, I'm a shy guy, so I have no clue how to prove to her I care. My way of showing it, is very subtle. I brought her flowers to her job and never try to push her to do anything. Maybe that makes me indecisive?

I have this Church near my house so I could get the guy to drop me off there and then say that she goes to that Church?      Which one seems more believable?

Me and my girlfriend have been together for 1yr and 3months now, we've had our ups and down but we kept pushing through. There's this guy who was always (in my eyes flirting with her) messing with her like grabbing her sides and teasing her and i think at first she would get mad and hit him but then after a while i think she was playing with him back.. still hitting him but probably playing. They became friends and then later she started saying she thinks she has a crush on him, it bothered me but I told her she could be friends with him if she wanted to later she told me she told him in a note that she couldnt be friends with him anymore, he confronted her and asked why and that it could only be if she likes him or something else, she told him it was that she kinda liked him.. then he confessed in a note the next day. From what i know they only talk in notes now but she still thinks about him sometimes she says. I feel like im losing her to him and if they start talking again with him other then just notes it'll escalate. Any advice would be appreciated, your thoughts as well.

My best friend is advising me against it as she says he is a jerk who is only after one thing yet I feel I need more opinions.       He didn't want to use protection which makes me think he really is a jerk but I'm still really uncertain. The friend who is obsessed with has been kinda on my case for a while about me losing my virginity and I kinda feel like I might as well just do it.

20090307124740AAyMYRS	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	How can you tell if you're getting too clingy in a relationship?	I'm starting to think that I am getting too clingy because I've called her everynight since monday (since we got together). And for the first three nights, we talked but Thursday and yesterday she didn't call back. She told me she couldn't on Thursday cuz she was asleep when I called her. So maybe I'm overracting. But still I wonder if I'm getting too clingy for calling her every night. All I want to do is talk to her and get to know her more and get more comfortable with her and 'm wondering if I'm getting too clingy for doing so and calling her every night. If that's the case, then please tell me what can I do to help this and what other things could show that I'm getting clingy. If someone could tell me this, I'd greatly appreciate it. I really really like this girl and this is the first girl that actually shows that she likes me. It's the first relationship that isn't only me who shows affection. It's like my first real relationship and I don't want to mess it up. I don't want it to end so quickly and so that's why I need to know. Thank you very much!

20090227090512AABePXV	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Two-timing boyfriend and i dont mind?!?!?	I dated this guy 3 years back, v were madly in love with each other but broke up. An year back v started talking again and things started heating up. I had just broken from another relationship and he said he was single. 3-4 months after we started dating, he told me that he has a girlfriend. He told me just cuz i mean a lot 2 him and he doesnt wanna lose me again and begged me not to stop talking with him. I relented cuz v were falling in love again( kinda stupid i know!). He told me all these cheesy lovey-dovey stuffs, talking about a future and life long things. We both were seriously falling in love again and i never felt insecure about the other girl, they hardly met and were 0% physcial. But lately i started feeling this possessiveness and didnt want that girl in his life. I hinted to him that i wanted him to leave her, he didnt get it. Few days back i told him point blank its either me or her. I dint wait for his answer and gave him a week's time. He told me yesterday that he cant ditch her but he cant let me go also. I ditched him right away but he has been messaging me and leaving voicemails non-stop begging me to take him back, not ignore him like this and that he really loves me and wants a future with me adn blah-blah. I really love him a lot and i know he loves me too but why is he so reluctant to leave her?! Im terribly tempted to return his calls but if i do, he will back to the two-timing without giving any thought to what i said. Do u think he loves me? What do i do?
20090227090544AAgL0d9	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Does this sound like he blew me off?	Ok- me and this guy have been texting for a few months and we had made plans to hang out the other night. Well the night before he was supposed to come over we talked til like 1am and were real flirty with each other and whatnot.. well usually I get messages from him throughout the day just saying hi or howd ya sleep, stuff like that.. the day he was supposed to come over (yesterday) he sends me a text saying he needs to take a rain check on us hanging out cause he needs to help his buddy move.. im pretty sure he is just blowing me off, but why after us talking the night before and everything was ok..?? i haven't tried to contact him or anything and neither has he.. kinda strange. What should i do, if anything?
20090227090758AA8K1S8	Family & Relationships;Friends	What do you think of this, can I trust her?	here's the thing, I used to date someone from work long ago, it didn't end good because he was controlling and jealous, and i have the feeling he cheated on me, cos after i broke up with him he had a gf in less than 3 weeks. Anyways this guys has a girl friend at work, they go to work together and stuff, I don't talk to her much cos I she is her friend and I dont know what they will say about me, or what he said to her about me (I dont really care but I prefer not to talk to her, i obviously say hi and bye but only to be polite), anyways,last weekend i was at a club with some friends and she approched me and said that I didnt talk to her and maybe I thought that she had something to do with my break up with this guy, I told her that I didnt think that, it was just that she was friends with him and i wasn't such a close friend with her. She told me that after me and him broke up , he told her everything in his relationship with the new girl, and she thought that he was very jealous, that he wouldn't recommend him as a bf to her friends or any person cos she felt that he was very very jelous. She told me she knew him since they were 18 but she never knew him in a relationship level, and as a friend he is great , he gives great advice but he doesn't apply it to his relationships.   I'm very confused cos I think this girl was telling me the truth but I don't know why, cos we aren't close friends, why would she come to me and say such a bad thing of her supposed friend. And most importantly, should I trust her?
20090227090943AAiqbWH	Family & Relationships;Friends	"Friends" ........wicked coool!!.........are'nt they?	Hey u guys, i am a real great fan of the telefilm "fRienDs" shown on STAR WORLD. The thing i like the most about them is their chemistry in acting out every scene. It seems to me as if they show me their real life.       This is the very stuff i wanted to ask you guys, that " do such people really exist who keep up the true sense of friendship?" (i mean, is the real life of the people of New York being reflected through it???)   They attract me the most when i find them helping each other to solve their own problems in life. They speak everything so frankly and clearly. I feel that they are the ones who really deserve to be friends.       And when i see all these, I often regret to be "WHERE I AM" because i feel that my life is limited everywhere, niether my social world entertains such attitudes nor do i have such friends. They  consider western attitude to be BAD.   People living here always try to take advantage of every situation. They go finding profits everywhere. Even if i try to create such a surrounding of what it is to be like "FRIENDS", people laugh and mock at me, I dont know why? My friends want me to behave with them according to their taste. They want every advantage from the western world i.e technology, modern styles, inventions,cuisines etc ......... but never stop blaming them for their culture, like I mentioned before. For them western culture seems to demoralize their character. But my argument is that, if it was so, then how is the western world more successful than ours????       In my point of veiw, a person apart from being an INDIAN, AMERICAN, RUSSIAN...............or whatever, as a human being wants to achieve his best in life. So naturally if his conditions favour him he would select a better world for him everytime. May it be another country or state other than his own. Isnt what i have said reasonable?           Infact to sum up i should say that living in such a society is living for the sake of others and not according to what I need. In my point of view, it is still wrong to say their are no social divisions existing in India because in my school rich guys make a group and consider the poor and middle class students as inferior. Being so called "rich" they are more benefitted in their studies........how????..............for example, poor guys are not able to afford for going to tuitions but the rich guys(who perform well in their academics) do, so who is benefitted more? who would possibly score more marks? They can also afford to buy every possible surroundings and study material they need. They take advantage of their conditions.   Tis not necessary that all poor guys are good at studies! Did u get me?? Another example is that students whose parents work as teachers also have to take very less effort for studies. For an instance if it takes me an hour in solving a difficult math problem, it takes just a minute for these guys by just taking the pain of asking it to their parents. Isnt it true?       At last i want to ask you whether it is right for me to expect a life as that of "FRIENDS" in  my future provided i am successful in my life to get a place abroad (possibly in USA,UK.......)????       I am asking this question not as an INDIAN but as a human bieng, dont I deserve such a life?(a life of perfection) In fact i dont like my own cultures and traditions. Niether do I like the attitude of the people in my community. For me living a "PERFECT" life is to live like a citizen in a developed country rather than living in a "rickety" country which always claims to be developing. Why should i ruin my life here when the modern world is waiting in front of me??? I love the western cultures and traditions very much.      I am also deprived of appreciation for my achievements, rather my friends are jealous of me and want me to be always down. Fascinatingly, in my community there is not even one person who could be called as my BEST FRIEND. This always puts me into a mental frustration, i feel cut off from my world. And even if i try to take my situation as a challenge, i always fail. So rather than changing the unchangeable i think it is better for me to escape from my world to be with my so called "FRIENDS". And for that, i swear to myself that i would work hard to get up to a good position and then i will probably achieve my will. And i hope that i can provide a good life to my family too.

20090227091535AA4Dx9Z	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Girlfriends Parents Dissaprove?	My girlfriend's Parents liked me a lot. That is until I got into trouble and they discovered I've had a history of a drinking problem....They still like me, they are just worried for their little girl....Which I can understand...I have a little sister......The thing is, I love this girl and I'm changing my ways. I've been sober now for 94 days and going strong a day at a time....I expect them to be skeptical of me until I prove for a good while that I've honestly changed and am solid with my recovery.....      My question is how long do you think is reasonable for them to begin to worry less and ease up on stressing her about our relationship? Their words and opinions mean a lot to her and I don't want them to pull her away from loving me...or make her feel bad about being with me.      Same goes for her.....She worries too? How long should it take before I gain total trust so I don't have to walk on eggshells anymore?
20090227091751AA4Wibc	Family & Relationships;Friends	Can you tell me if this is weird?	I have lately been getting pissed off by big headed people both on the internet and off it. For example: lately one of my friends was being a hypocrite as he always seems to think he's "solid" (although past experiences have proved otherwise), and was chatting behind somebody else's back saying they were acting "hard" when in actual fact that's what he was doing himself. I have told him that to his face, he seems to hate the fact that I said it.       My question is, is it human nature or "weird" that I currently can't stand obnoxious people? Yet in the past I have been able to tolerate them.       Thanks in advance,      Matt.

20090307130950AAikd4i	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	I really like this guy and don't know what to do now? Can you help me?	...well, I've been liking him on and off since we first became friends in 8th grade, and now we're in 11th and I have fallen for him altogether. So we chat and flirt and I ask him out online, and he gives me somewhere between a "no" and a "probably in the future" kind of thing. Well, we're drama geeks and are in a musical right now that had its first show yesterday, and we don't talk really much there but several times I would randomly smile at him and he would look right at me and give me a smile back, and (we both play middle-aged people, so we have lots of make-up on) we usually end up sitting next to each other while 2 girls do our make-up and whenever one is doing my make-up I know he's watching me, and once I even looked back and he turned away in a second as if he wasn't staring at me.   So we flirt and all...but he's still single and didn't say yes,   I used to be shy but now am seeming more open around people, so maybe he could take his word back and ask me out?   Opinions plz, and thanks:)   Also, if there's any proceeding advice you could give me, that would be great. He seems like my only option for prom too, which is May 2nd.

20090307131720AAaYlfe	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Question for the ladies - asking out a girl?	Alright, so there is this girl that I've had a crush on for a while.  We have a class together that meets once a week.  I've talked to this girl on a few occasions (unfortunately, not every week the class meets) and I really like her.      Anyways, I was invited to a party where I could bring a guest.  I really wanted to ask this girl to go with me to the party...but I also didn't want to weird her out since we don't know each other very well.      I called her this past week to ask her to the party.  She said something like "Oh, I would totally like to go, but I have a soccer tournament that day..."  Argh!  I know she isn't lying about the soccer tournament -- I knew about, but had just forgotten it was that weekend.  After she said she would be out of town for soccer, part of me just wanted to ask her out to eat/movie for a different day...but perhaps she just wasn't interested and the soccer event was just a convenient excuse?        I know in my life, I really don't like it when someone asks me out and I politely decline with a friendly excuse...only to have them ask again and again.  It's like, "Can't you take the hint???", but you don't really want to be mean and say that.      So with this girl, I really don't feel that her excuse was necessarily to avoid me...but I am not sure.  I figure one good thing about asking her is that she should now know that I am interested in her.  But I feel somewhat hesitant to ask her out again.  It would be nice if she would just ask me :)  Monday is the first time I will see her since I called her to ask.      Right now I am planning just to observe how she behaves around me on Monday.  If she seems like she is avoiding me...I'll get the hint.  But if she comes up to me or mentions something about the date she couldn't make...I would probably try to schedule another date :)      So girls, what do you think about this?  If you were the girl, what would you want me to do?  Any tips/suggestions?      Thanx, Nick =]

20090307133508AAM1mcN	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Follow the heart or the brain? Help!?	Okay theres a girl who is essentially the girl of my dreams. I'm not with her but ive been round her house a few times and we've kissed quite a lot and cuddled lots too. She basically has a fear of sex but it doesnt bother me because i love cuddling her. Things were goin really good til my 'friend' who fancies her told her pretty much all my faults: I get angry easily, im violent with guys who 'push me too far', im a deviant (work it out), and that i was accused of blackmailing an ex into doing 'it' (even though i didnt - that one was just an accusation to make all her friends hate me...)... This girl believes that it wasnt true, but with all the stuff my 'friend' went and told her shes basically scared she'll say something that makes me angry, even though i would never hit a girl (and never have since i was 5) and im very calm when someone i love insults or offends me... She's not completely put off me but it doesnt look like anything official would happen for a long time... if at all...      Here's the dilemma. Someone i fancied a while back has basically asked if we can 'hang out' tomorrow and ive said "i kinda like someone sorry - plus we'd have nothing to talk about it would be awkward because we havent spoken much recently" and she just said 'i wouldnt mind if we spent all day doing it' and thats actually got me interested.      I don't NEED it but i would enjoy it, and i really feel comfortable having the safety of an official relationship as opposed to a potential one. When it remains potentiality i tend to get paranoid.      I guess basically what im asking is - should i go for what is essentially the girl of my dreams and im in love with, though there is very little chance of it ever actually happening (follow the heart), or should i go for the logically correct stance and enjoy myself, have a fun relationship and cry myself to sleep at night over the loss of potential life happiness.      I just hate potentiality. I really hate it. - Sorry for being so long im just really quite agitated and anxious right now.

20090307134022AAxipnj	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Should I break up with her?	Ok, I have a girlfriend and shes a little immature. shes 15 and im 16 and we been goin out since september of 08, and i feel like im making to much effort into it. Im always the one who calls her, she never calls me, I ask if she can come over, but she never asks me if i want to come over (She says its weird when she ask someone to come over, and wants them to ask) I dont really understand why lol.      She broke up with me once, for a guy and this guy had a year long relationship and thought he loved his gf. but he broke up with her and my gf broke up with me than they started dating and like a week later he broke up with her on valentines day, and he went back to his ex, and now me and my gf are back together. (Which is probably a dumb move)       Than I went to her friends house with my friend and hes dating my gf's friend. and they were all over each other but, i gave my gf hugs and stuff and she would not really hug me back, she would not do anything (Im very affectionitive) and i felt like a retard because i was hugging her and all this stuff but i didnt get anything back.       What should I do?

I guess I kind of showed my hand with that conversation (didn't tell her I like her, but it's obvious). What should I do? And quick advice would be nice.

The problem is all my guy friends end up developing a crush on me, and when i turn them down decide to take on the idea that I'm a huge ****.  I'm not a ****, but I really like this one guy.  Numerous girls tell him that I'm a **** and i'll cheat on him and have sex with all his friends.  My guy friends all say they've had sex with me, but I'm a virgin.  Now i have this lovely reputation and this guy actually put off asking me out to "get to know me better".  I've been looking forward to him asking me out, but now I need to prove all these people wrong.  I don't blame him for behaving like this, considering it's my word against a bunch of people's, but i want to prove i'm not a **** and that I'm still a virgin.  Any Ideas, and please be creative(:

20090307141114AAX09u1	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	How can I get over this girl?	How can I get over this girl?   I knew her since August 07, she used to sit next to me in my class. I changed schools in March 08, and I barely talked to her since. Not that I ever talked to her much either. We were just classmates. Anyway, now it's March 09, and she has a Boyfriend and they've been dating for a year or so and I can't stop thinking about her. Ever since I've seen her I've been in love, and I haven't liked any other girls since then. Not even any supermodels I see on TV or magazines I can compare with her...even though not everyone might think so, I do. She's pretty good looking, and has a good personality.      I can't get over her, even through my friend's encouragement. We're both in 11th grade but go to different schools, but we will be going to the same college. I need help and tips to get over her, because as it is right now, I think about her 24/7.

He was talking about how he wants to have a relationship WHILE we were intimate, to which I responded somewhat badly...This role reversal is confusing to me and I really don't want it to get in the way of what could be an excellent opportunity.      This IS a gay relationship, and please keep in mind that we are about 18 years of age.      Any suggestions for me?

20090307141644AA2gNJj	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Relationship Trouble; please help?	So I have been with my girlfriend for 2 and a half years now. For the first year and a half I was in the Navy, and the bread-winner of our family. She lost her job at one point, and I was taking care of her and her daughter ( Not my bio child, but she might as well be compared to how much she interacts with her real father ) for close to 6 months. Recently I was laid off of my job ( Help Desk/Tech Support for a major company in Seattle ) and am having a tough time finding another. I keep our house spotless, I do all the cooking and laundry, and I help our kid with all her schoolwork. Since I lost my job, though, she has been exceptionally moody. She snaps over the dumbest, smallest thing. Now Im sure some of you are going to want to know what these "dumb" and "small" things are, so I'll elaborate: Just this morning I woke up and gave her a kiss, and she says 'Don't F***ing touch me. I ask her what's wrong and she goes on about how I woke her up last night and she couldnt get back to sleep. I got up to pee. Didn't turn the light on, didn't flush (For the sole purpose of NOT waking her up) and was as stealthy as I could possibly be. But all morning she glared and made snide comments to me. Another Stupid Incident: A few days ago I told her I would have some roast pork ready for dinner when she got home. Well, when I opened the package of pork and it smelled vile (I returned it). So I made baked chicken breast and mashed potatoes instead. She went nuts when she got home and found out she wasn't getting what I said I would make ("You lied to me, I was expecting that, I could have eaten at work, I could have picked up fast food...") Then she went off on me (after explaining the pork situation) because I ate 2 granola bars (She saw the two wrappers in the trash). "Your eating all of her (her = daughter) lunch snacks! Your going to get fat! All you do is sit around eating crap!" Keep in mind, I ate two out of a box of 60 bars that I bought for MY lunch before I lost my job. And it's not like Im fat, or out of shape. I am 6'2 about 205, and I swim 3000-4000 yards 3 - 4 times a week. Anyways, I suppose Im done rambling, I just need some good advice. I fear our relationship may be coming to an end if something doesn't change soon.

So I dated this girl for 10 months, and she broke up with me almost two months ago saying that, "she needed her space and time to herself." I never loved anyone or anything as much as her, and I was crushed when she left.  Yesterday she sent me a text saying, "I hope you're doing well, been thinking about you everyday." I responded to her telling her that I was really busy and that I had to run. Why would she be texting me this? Should I just let it go?
20090307142913AAFhfI1	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	How can I make him happier, or put him in a better mood?	Ok, so I'm dating this guy and he's pretty mean to like everyone, except me. He's such a jack a** sometimes, and I just wish I could do something to put him in a better mood. And sometimes when he works on things he thinks are difficult, he gets too overwhelmed and just plain mean, I always try to say things to make him laugh, but nothing ever works. And I really do like this guy, and I wish that when he was in one of his "moods" like that, that I could just be enough for him and make him forget all the stuff that he hates putting up with. I've talked to him about it, because for a while, I would try and cheer him up and I would just feel like I was being annoying and in his face. He said it wasn't me, it was just whatever was making him mad at the moment. I just really can't take much more of it though, it really upsets me to see him like that, I want to just break down and cry everytime it happens. I almost did once, too, but he didn't notice, he had to get somewhere so I told him to enjoy himself and my voice was cracking cause I was about to cry. I care so much about him, and I wish I could make him happy. For a while, I considered just breaking up with him, but I care too much about him to do that to him. Any advice would be nice and very appreciated. Thanks. :)

20090307143257AAMcUi5	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Is he the right guy for me?	im 14. my boyfriend and i have been together for 4 months and he is a really sweet guy and he is very caring. i love him. but he wants to have sex now. he says he loves me and will stay with me forever. he is also really insecure. he only lets me hug 1 other guy and it has to be a side hug. ugh. but anyways he wants to have sex and i dont. i have told him i am not ready and he thinks i am. but i refuse. then he got all mad and said that i should do it to save out relationship and that he waited when he didnt want to so i should do something for him.      is it me or does he sound very jerkish?   should i stay with him, will things get better?
20090307144229AATsZYA	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Break up for no reason?	He says we should talk. We talked. He said we should take a break. Asked if I was okay. I said mhm and walked away. He didn't go to school for the next two days (supposedly really sick) then goes to school yesterday(Friday) I saw him in the hall and didn't really want to talk to him but didn't want to avoid him. I talked to one of my friends later and she said that he had wanted to talk to me but I was avoiding him(didn't mean to but okay.) I saw him in the hall later and our shoulders almost brushed but he didn't even notice me. I wanted to talk to him so this morning I texted him just "hi" he took an hour to respond and this is how it went. "hi" "hey" "I heard you wanted to talk. We didn't really get to see each other yesterday at all..." "Yeah. Kayla said you had some questions" "I kinda just wanted to know why" and that's the end of everything. It took him about 20 minutes or more each time to respond to my texts and he never responded to my why. It's been over 2 hours and I still don't know why. I really want to talk to him in person, but that'd be hard. I don't know what to do...

My last couple of relationships have been a disaster and the guy I was talking to recently gave me the run around. I'm at the point where I just don't even want to date ever again and I honestly don't have any faith in guys at all anymore...every one I've ever been involved with have told me whatever they have to tell me to get in my pants or get me where they want me.

20090307144655AA5IjU5	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	How to get my ex back?	We've been together for a month, everything been perfect, then suddenly the words came out of the blue sky that she needed to talk to me.      She said that she needed a break or some space because she realised that she still has feelings for another guy.   I took it as it was over for good.      I didn't take it that well, I was totally confused because she recently opened herself to me and told me everything about the difficulties she had in her childhood etc. so I thought that this is IT, she is 'The one'.      After that we hadnt spoken to eachother for a day, then she seeks help from my best friend and said this :    "Hey. I don't know what to do. :( I found out that I was not ready for a relationship yet, then Mich became quite mad about it. I still care about him, I still indescribable care about him, but I still have a crush on a another guy, for 2 years and I can't get him out of my head. I think It's wrong to be together with Mich when I still am in love with this another guy. I don't want him to be mad at me, I want him to still have the same feelings for me like he used to have when we were together. Because I want me and Mich back together because he is a part of my heart now. It's just that I don't think that I was ready for a relationship yet :( Help me!! :("      Both me and my ex knows that she won't get the other guy she is in love with because the age difference is huge and I dont think that he really sees her in that way.      I was only depressed HARD-CORE 2 first days but today I feel quite ok with it. I mean, the depression ended sooner than I thought. But who knows, it might be deep inside me trying to hide it.      So now I have been acting,  like I am happy as I would be when I am together with her, because I know if I am showing that I am REALLY depressed I am just pushing her further away from me.      Then suddenly I got this text message from her that she hasn't found a new boyfriend. I thought like "err k?".   Deep inside I know she still wants us back together.      I have learned that I need to express myself to show that I dont exactly NEED her but I WANT her if I am going to get her back.       So now I am begging for some advice or some step-by-step guide, I still have feelings for her, I still love her.   But what movements should I take?      The tricky part is that I am away from the city where we both live in for a week, so I can't exactly meet her face to face, only MSN and text messaging.      I know that if I act like im happy as I would be together with her is a somewhat risk to take, since she might think that I am ok with it that we are over, so she might move on.      Thanks in advance.

20090307145157AA4TOLj	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	My boyfriend dumped me?	I was going out with this boy for about 3 months and he really did mean everything to me. He finished me over IM about 2 days ago. We spent christmas, new years and valentines day together. About a week ago we didnt see eachother for about 2 weeks because we was with eachother every single day since we had been together, so we decided to take a break and only see eachother like 2 times a week. He finished me because as we had so much time apart he didnt feel the same anymore, but he was fine with me all this week until thursday night when he told me on msn that he didnt want to be with eachother. I dont believe that was the real reason why he did it because i got told, if you love someone and have breaks from eachother you grow stronger. One minuite im fine and then the next i will just start bursting into tears, im really taking this whole thing so badly. how can i get over him? the thing that is really bothering me is when i see him around town with other girls. i really dont know how iam going to handle it. any ideas?

20090307145341AAcphfq	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	How do i know if i really like him or not?	I know this question sounds silly... most of you would say, "well, if you're questioning it, then you probably don't." but the situation is what's making it difficult for me to know for sure. I met this guy at my work over christmas break. at first i didn't think anything of it, but then i started getting to know him, and became very attracted to his personality. I hung out with him and his friends once before he went back to college. Since then, we've talked on line, and through texting, and i have seen him a few times (on his visits back home) but we haven't hung out again. Its his spring break and i suggested that we should hang out. He agreed and said we should..  But for the past few weeks i have been unsure of my feelings. How are you supposed to know how you feel about someone when you're never with them? I didn't know him all that well before he left for college, so how can i tell if i like him? do i have to spend more time with him to be able to tell? or what?? please help!!

I was talking a close guy friend (dating) of mine on the phone and I think he was jerking off, I could kind of tell by his breathing and the questions he kept asking me.      But nothing like "what are you wearing?" just like normal, flirting questions.   Which I found pretty funny but now whenever I talk to him, I feel like he may be touching himself again.      So I'm wondering if many guys do this? My friend said her her boyfriend always does it naturally...but I don't get what she means? just touching or actually masturbating?

20090307151414AAutGVA	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Should I carry on talking to him?	Hiya, was just hoping for a bit of advice...   Basically, I met a guy whos 4 years older than me at work (don't work together anymore) and we got on really well. So I started speaking to him online & by text and we met up outside of work once (but havent since).    BUT there is a slight problem...he has a girlfriend.. and I don't want to get involved with that.   He knows that I like him and has told me how great he thinks I am etc (though I do know he just sees me as a friend)   Thing is, it ends up upsetting me a lot whenever I think about/talk to him and know things could never work out.    So do I carry on talking to him as a friend, whilst wishing it could be more?? Or do I just try and move on by not contacting him as much etc??   Thankyou in advance :) x

20090307163336AA2Gtab	Family & Relationships;Family	Who should I live with? Mom or Dad?	Okay, I just moved well not just but at the beginning of the year I was the new kid. I've made some pretty good friends, but an enemy (or 2). My mom lives with her boyfriend and they are constantly having fights because he thinks that she is cheating on him. I have a lot of friends, but no matter where I go I can never be me. And I catch my mom and her boyfriend having sex a lot, especially in the morning at 9 and stuff when I wake up.      Okay now my dad. I was supposed to live with my dad and go to this advanced school with an orchestra and I could get college credits. But he has a different religion and he makes references to it a lot and we get into arguments quite often. I would live with my step-mom and little brother who is 3 and has an 85% chance of being autistic so I would have to help out a lot. And they don't eat healthy often (micro-waved foods are more often then cooked one's and everything comes from a can).
20090307163236AArJlBv	Family & Relationships;Other - Family & Relationships	How do you forgive and forget when it hurts so bad?	About 2 years ago my husband relapsed into a terrible drug addiction.  I went to a male friend for help and ended up getting emotionally involved with him.  I never kissed him or had sex or anything, I just became very needy and clingy with him because of my problems at home.  My husband and I decided to work on the issues and we both stopped our bad behaviors.        Now, its like we have issues with truly forgiving each other. Whenever something new comes up, its like all the past hurts keep coming up along with it.  I think he's untrustworthy and he thinks I'm a slut.      He lied to me so much and did many bad things like stealing from me and my daughter when he was using drugs.  My wedding ring and even my Chihuahua went to a drug dealer.  I was traumatized.  I don't mean to justify my actions, but I was scared and heartbroken with what he did and I was only reacting.  I was only using the other man in order to feel safe.

When my husband and I first started dating (6yrs ago), his sister was a young stay at home mom (16) she didn't have a drivers license (so she was at the house every time we were there) or many friends. She sort of clung to me and we began to develop a friendship. Right from the start I wasn't all that impressed with her but did feel sorry for her, I would invite her out to lunch with me once in a while and such.      Lately, she's been driving me NUTS. I've really tried to distance myself from her but she continues to call and come by. She calls me to rant about her other friends, husband, parents, pretty much anyone she can whine about. She's been telling me lies, and I HATE liars.       Now, here is my dilemma, if this weren't someone that I had to see in the future I would have told her off a LONG time ago, but since it is my husbands sister I don't want things between us to be awkward. Now, I know many of you will say to have my hubby deal with it, but I don't think that is wise. They already have a troubled relationship and he can be very hurtful with his words, especially to his 5 sisters.       My question is, do you think I should call her on it next time she is pissing me off, or should I just bite my tongue and let it go for the sake of it? My hubby tells me all the time that I should tell her, but she is a grudge holder and a crap talker, I'M POSITIVE that if I say something to her, she will turn around and whine about me to the rest of the people she knows. Please help.

20090307161556AAHd4pF	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	What's wrong in not wanting a man to spend the rest of ur life with?	According to some I know, I have a knack for falling for losers. I'm not outgoing. I choose not to be. I like the way I am, and if no one else seems to, that's cool too. But there are some who just want me to find a man to take care of me. Even though these ppl know I have nothing a man who'd want to do this would want. They already know that I found a guy who's marginally acceptable, and could care for me. It was an arranged marriage, so they had a hand in it. It didn't work out. Their solution is to try again, but not to wait too long since I'm not getting any younger.      This isn't me being down on myself, I know who n what I am. Facts are facts. I just need to get on my feet, but even after I do this, ppl will want to hook me up in the name of security. Do they want to hurt me to make themselves feel better? NE thoughts? thanks.

20090307163600AAFTfLI	Family & Relationships;Friends	I'm scared of losing my best friend, help me? (Kinda long, sorry)?	We've been best friends since 3rd grade. Her name is Sandra. We know everything about it each other, and she's closer to me than anyone else. Being friends with her is like the sun rising in the morning. It just happens, it HAS to happen.      But lately she's been lying, and doesn't hang out with me anymore. I have no other friends, and don't really plan on making any. All of the other kids at my school are stuck up, and think I'm weird. (Which I kinda am, but my best friend is just like me, we're weird together!)      But like, this weekend she lied and said she had an eye appointment to go get glasses. I believed her and said it was okay, but then this girl, Sarah, comes up to me and says, "Hey Sandra is coming over to my house today!" I wouldn't mind the slightest bit if she was going over to that girls house, she can have as many friends as she wants. The thing that bugs me is we haven't hung out for like...2 months...and she could've come over this weekend but ditched me and lied. I find it weird because just a few days ago she said, "Oh man...one thing I hate is liars!" But she's been lying to me like that the past few weeks. She also talks bad about Sarah to me like saying, "Sarah is sooo annoying!" Why is she going to her house then? Same thing with a girl named Brianna. I've found out from them that she was going to their house. I don't care, but it's weird that she's lying and won't come over to my house ever. :(      Maybe she just doesn't like me anymore. If she doesn't, I don't plan on making a new friend. It won't work, I've tried. It's just not the same.       Do you know how I can get my friend back, or am I going to be friendless? I would miss her, but I wouldn't want a new friend. It's complicated. I find hanging out with other kids awkward, uncomfortable, and boring. No one can make me laugh except Sandra.      :(

20090307170547AA3BePz	Family & Relationships;Weddings	What to do about my maid of honor's hair?	I am extremely frustrated with my maid of honor.  She is my best friend, and has been for fifteen years.  She has a unique sense of style and any other time, I wouldn't care what she does, but right now I do and I don't know what to tell her.  About six months ago she decided to cut off all of her hair.  We are talking, as short as a boy's haircut.  It looked good.  She had done it before, I wasn't worried and just asked that she not grow it out before the wedding since her hair is thick, curly, and when she grows it out, it looks really bad for awhile (she has done this before).  But now, six weeks before the wedding she just told me that she is letting it go.  Now her version of letting it grow is just that, letting it go.  She gets no trims, just lets it do what it will.  It had gotten too long on her neck so she was planning on taking scissors to that part herself today.  I expressed some concern but she just looked ticked off and said it would look fine, asked who would be looking at her anyway, and asked if I was trying to say her hair is ugly.  I can't afford to pay someone to do her hair for her, she won't even listen to me about going to a professional to get a trim, and I wouldn't care except she is going to be up front in the church, in a lot of the pictures and I have put a lot of effort into making everything look nice.  I haven't asked her to do anything,no bridal shower, no wedding errands...I fear being a bridezilla and asking too much, am I out of line to be annoyed and wanting to address this?  And if not, then what do I say?

20090307170612AAU4VGx	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	Serious help my friend is with an abusive partner and she's pregnant the way he treats her is making her ill?	At first i would say "you're better than him" or "you're stronger than this" and she would agree but always contemplate if she should stay or go because he's the dad. Lately he's basically flat out disrespected her and denied his love for her and she's still thinking she can make it work. I'm afraid for health because she's repressing her emotions. I told her that she should leave now and not worry about him because he really doesnt care about her or her baby but she just keeps going back to him. I think she's mad at me for telling her to leave. She's only 16 and having to deal with the stress of becomnig a mom and now some guy is saying things like "I'm not going to change for you." She's very depressed and afraid but she thinks being with him will make everything wonderful. I just want her to know she can make it without him or at least work a deal out to where he supports her and her child seperated. Was i wrong for saying she should leave or should i just forget the whole thing and let her deal by herself?

20090307162113AAnTuda	Family & Relationships;Weddings	Does it make sense I have mixed emotions about the wedding ring?	Me and my husband don't have such a good income, so when we got married we didn't have rings. Last week I decided to buy him a wedding band on ebay which was very cheap but worth a lot (I was the only one who bid). He was flattered, yet sad since I didn't have one. Unfortunately, even though my monthly pay is small I make more than him. Today me we were at Walmart and since we had the chance to buy things he wanted me to get a ring. The thing is his account right now is basically empty so I bought it. I feel sad yet happy I have a wedding band now. I paid more for my ring than his (it wasn't expense though). The man is usually buys the rings. He is the one who asked me to marry him, but on that part I don't have an engagement ring. I'm happy it can show that we're now married and have rings but it kind of hurts that I paid. Does that make sense or do I sound like a cry baby? We love each other and just had our first daughter. What do you think?

I do tell him not to cause my lady doesn't like it but still does it. Shes also has very low self esteem about her body and breasts. It took me months for her to take off her bra (shes thinking about buying bigger ones) when we started having sex but still like keep it on sometimes. Sadly my brother doesn't have a life of his own or a girlfriend. Like once I was talking to my girl on the phone until my brother just randomly grabbed it out my hands and called her a b*tch (he sounds a lot like me) then handed the phone back to me. She gave me hell then hung up on me. We made up a week later but now she won`t come over to my place anymore. Is brother ruining my relationship

20090307170911AAZnO9a	Family & Relationships;Family	Do I have a right to be angry about my family's reaction about almost being raped?	When I was 12 years old, I was in Africa for the summer visiting my relatives. I am fluent in the language in Eritrea. I was walking one day and this older guy ( in his 20's) that was walking whistled to get my attention. He said to me in the Eritrean language , " Rose told me to  take you to her house." I don't know anyone named Rose so I told him that. He repeatedly said that Rose sent him to take me to her house. I looked at the man confused and he said to me," Aren't you going to greet me properly?" and he stuck out his hand so I can shake it. I looked at him strangely and then he said to me in English, " Do you want sex?" Instantly, I turned around to run away and I saw my two friends with their aunt. I ran to them and screamed, "This guy is going to rape me." The man just stood around smirking and I just ran home. It was hard for me to explain to my aunts who couldn't speak English that a man was trying to lure me. I told my cousin that could speak English about what happened but she just laughed it off and said that the man was just kidding and that he did it to scare me. I was horrified by her reaction. I was just almost raped and she just laughed it off? Her older brother said the same thing and said he just did that to mess with me. Instantly, I was convinced that no one really cared so when my dad asked me about it, I just lied and said that it was some kid my age that did that but I scared him away. I didn't want everyone to go crazy over me and forbid me to walk alone. My mother didn't come with me on the vacation so when she called the next day, I told her what happened. Like everyone else, she laughed it off and said, " People in our country would never do that, only people here in the U.S. would do that. There's not much crime in our hometown." I was crushed. That really hurt my feelings. My mom didn't even care. I knew it was because stuff like that wasn't common in Eritrea and it wasn't considered a big deal there. Something like that happened to my sister once and the only one that took it seriously was my aunt and my cousins from Texas. Again my mom didn't really take it seriously.      To this day, I am angry about how no one took my situation seriously. I don't want that happening to any other kid. But my mother was right. There isn't much crime in Eritrea. But that doesn't mean that everyone can just not care about what happened to me.
20090307163929AAcMzRN	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	He is confusing me....?	So my guy friend called me up and wanted to go to the movies last night. Two of HIS friends were coming too (a girl and a guy). I had met them once before. (btw I like him and think he likes me back). Anyways, as we were walking into the theatre, we were talking, but when it came to sitting down, he let me and the other girl in and said "ladies first." I kind of got bummed cause I wanted to sit next to him. But then, his friend said, switch seats with me and he did and now he was sitting next to me. Does he like me and are his friends in on it??

20090307161114AAFQtKm	Family & Relationships;Family	I hate my brother so much!!! What can I do?	I've never liked my brother ever since I was a child. We never get along (like most brothers and sisters). But I honestly want to kill my brother and I want him to suffer. I'm 17 and he's 23 (we're 6 years apart). I know that he has a lot of temper problems as well. (We're pretty much the opposite person). When we were little, he used to always abuse me, verbally and physically. He also sexually abused me as well but I can't seem to tell anyone about it because I don't know what his intentions were since we were so young (he was about 12 or 13).      I always knew that he hated my boyfriend, but I recently found out that he even tried to kill my boyfriend. His girlfriend (at that time, now ex) told her brother (who's a good friend of mine) who told me that one time when me and my bf were in my room, he was standing out side my door with a knife preparing or something like that. I was so shocked that I became scared of my brother.      I accidentally opened up an MSN conversation history with his girlfriend on my computer and he told her that when he saw me and my boyfriend walking together he wanted to run him over and reverse, etc. His gf jokingly replied that I'd run him over and he replied "... with what? She doesn't have a car. But then again she's quite fat so she'd probably run me over herself." He went on saying about how I'm so lazy and how my parents spoil me so much and how I'd never survive on my own or when I have my own family.      I can't talk to my parents about this stuff because my parents have never been "true" parents to me... I can never trust them.      I feel like I want to run away or emancipate myself except I don't know where I would go...       What can I do??

20090307172147AA8c3Vd	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Is my boyfriend cheating on me?	I was on his laptop and he had his email on and the message was from a girl named lisa.  She attached a picture of her topless and said that they hadnt spoken in a month and was wondering if my boyfriend had remembered her.  About a month ago he was on his myspace every night talking flirtatiously to this chick named lisa.  He asked to meet with her one night and i asked if he would cheat on me and he said no.  He stopped going and writing messages afterward.  Now i find this on his yahoo.  She had said to write back to him asap but he didnt (at least not yet).  Could this be the same chick or just some spam that was sent to his inbox accidently???
20090307163327AAJEts0	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	Is it wrong for a female to not work, if her and her partner made a deal to where he works and she doesn't?	Yeah, a friend of mine, doesn't work because she said she wanted to stay at home, and clean, and cook, and work online, getting her blogs, and her site started. Her boyfriend was ok with this, but he eventually lost his job. He hasn't really been up to making much money, but then he starts saying that she needs to pull her weight, when he can barely pull his own weight. Is it wrong for a guy to work a crappy job, knowning that he has a girlfriend, and knowing that he wants children?

20090307165841AArH2yd	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Somebody please answer my questions, I really need help!?	So my boyfriend and I have been broken up for a couple months now and we are still very good friends but I want to get back together with him,the bad thing is I did have sex with another guy.. I rebounded horribly =( So he has been very upset about that! But I know he still loves me, and he still says things like "when I saw you yesterday you looked amazing" "you have a wonderful body" he always talks to me when I'm upset and If I'm really really sick he will come over.. I want him back so bad. So I was thinking I was going to ask him to come over in the next couple of weeks watch a couple movies together and try and get him back together with me. But I don't know what to say to get him back!! So I really do need a lot of help here. So what would you say to get the one you love back? And I'm only 17 soo I can't really do much, I just want to be with him. And please none of this you shouldn't have to convince him to be with you and stuff like that please! I just need help please!   Well I was thinking once were both standing up or something I'm just going to walk up to him and hug him so tight and whisper in his ear, "be with me" "Please! I love you and I'll be 18 soon so you won't have to be around my family so much. But please I miss you so much!"   What do you guys think of that? Do you guys have any better ideas?

20090307162652AAfJpGy	Family & Relationships;Other - Family & Relationships	Is my boss strange and out of line or am I too closed off and up tight?	I have been at my current job 6 mos. In the time that I have been there I have learned that my boss bonds with her employees (there are only 4 of us who she manages) by acting as though she is our BFF. FYI: She is in her 40's and has a house full of boys, while we, her employees,are all women ages 22-26yrs.       She behaves as though it is very important to her that we are her friend and that we each like her as more than just a decent boss. However, if one of us behaves as if they are frustrated with her for some reason, she immediatedly begins talking to the rest of us about what a b*tch that girl is and just in general takes it too far in her conversations about what she then feels for that particular employee. She allows her conversation to gets too personal in the info she shares about them; info that obvisiously that person may have confided in her about. This goes on until she makes up with that employee and life goes on like nothing ever happened...until the next time.       She offers to pay for things, like lunches, movie tickets, and spa treatments, but it's not for everyone and it's not paid for by the company, but out of her own pocket. I have never allowed myself to take these kind of gifts from her because I am not comfortable with it. While I do get along well enough with her, I am getting the sense that she now favors her other 3 employees over me due to the fact that they tolerate how she manages. One employee really is o.k. with it, while the others are not. They've admitted privately that it also makes them uncomfortable and that they don't totally understand it, but they feel stuck as I do in stopping it.       Although I feel that my refusing her gifts is starting to put a strangness between us, I know that she can't punish me for anything since I do my job as well as I can and I don't cause any issues in the office. But since I hold her at arms length when it comes to anything more than a boss/co worker relationship, I am getting the vibe that if a real problem were to come up at my job, that I couldn't trust her to really help me. I have also noticed that she is just this side of a little more hard on me. It's not how she says things these days, but what she is saying.       If anyone has been through a similar experience or has some helpful and SERIOUS advice please share. I would greatly appreciate it.

20090307161549AAzEfrF	Family & Relationships;Family	My mom makes fun of me about puberty?What to do?	Okay, my mom always makes fun of me and laughs at me about this stuff. I am having discharge but I don't tell anyone because I don't feel comfortable about it,not to my mom or my dad or anyone, I don't even have a best friend.I can never have a boyfriend because she will laugh at me and tell everyone she knows about it and it will ruin my life. I wish I had a mentor or someone in my life to trust. Dad makes me wear bras and I tell my mom that the more she pesters me about this stuff, the more I'm gonna not wear bras and ruin my life to make her and him look horrible but it doesn't work she laughs at me cruelly and she makes me cry and nobody cares because they all take her side and she says that she is not making a big deal about it but she is.This is so sad but i consider the people from my animal crossing:wild world game to be nicer friends and more trustworthy.I can't even tell my mom the name of anyone in my class because then she'll spread a false rumor like celeb gossip.  What can I do to comfort myself about this situation(talking won't help,already tried it)?

20090307160515AA5KEAp	Family & Relationships;Family	My Relationship With My Mom (advice?)?	Well, me and my mom NEVER had a positive relationship. When i was younger (1-2years old) she never let me go out and play in my sand box which my dad spent about a hundred dollars on.(it was a pretty big sandbox i was told)      She never let me see my grandmother (dads mom) and she told me (as i grew older) that i wasnt going to my senior prom. Wenever my dad went to work or the store she would invite all my little siblings in the room with her to watch tv. I would go, excited, but she would reject my presence. They would laugh and play around for hours; i would sit in the living room or outside alone.       She would say things to me like she wish she would had aborted me and she wish i wasnt her child. She said i was useless and i dont contribute to anything but dirt! I grew up to hate her!!      One day, wen i was in the 11 grade she said somethin that realli got to me. She told my dad that i need to get out of her house becuz no one wanted me there! It realli struck me becuz im such a nice person. I screamed and said WELL WHERE DO I BELONG??? and she went balistic!! She attacked me, hitting, kicking and punching me.

I am living off them which they cant really afford. my doctor is worried if I do not get away formthe stress I could get preclamsia. So my cousin offered me a place to stay in illinois, is it okay for me to go? I have a job waiting and everything.

20090307162321AAQpIcd	Family & Relationships;Family	Mad At My Sister, Any Advice On How to Forgive Her?	This past weekend I had a miscarriage with my first child. I've been upset, naturally that's a given. I blogged about it on my myspace and my sister replied to my blog. She told me to get over it and quit with the "woe is me" bullcrap. She said I didn't need the kid in the first place and I wasn't ready for one and they are expensive.She told me to just worry about my college and forget about babies. She also said alot of other extremely hurtful things to me and it upset me. Yes, my child was unplanned and a huge surprise(my husband just got layed off from his job so yes, we weren't financially secure). Yes, a baby and school would be extremely hard but I have my husband and my college has a daycare. It's just the stuff she said to me hurt my feelings and I don't want to go around her right now. Is there any advice on how to help forgive her for what she said? I admit she had some points about the job and school thing but I'm 23, married, and I have my life in order so I don't feel like she should have attacked and lectured me like she did. I don't want any tension between us, she is my twin so we've always had a strong bond and this fight is killing me.

20090307163516AAVhArZ	Family & Relationships;Family	A painful problem with my 23 yo girl, any solution?	I have a 23 yo daughter, graduated, a very respected and great young adult. Unfortunately, she simply doesn't speak with us. This strong resentment began when she was 14. She went through a bad phase, something I could never understand happened in her brains and she turned into a very disrespctful and disobedient girl. Joined bad crowds, sometimes she drank. She was mean to her lil sister, she was jealous. Once she jooined some troubled teenagers and they graffited a wall and eneded up breaking 2 windows, she was drunk. She got a really harsh punishment that lasted for 4 months. She had to work as a janitor to pay for the damages and was grounded from almost everything. She got devastated, she realized wat she had done, apologized. Then she heard from us some words she could never get over. She begged for our trust and forgiviness and we said she had lost our trust, would have to face the consequences of her actions and only time would show if she had learned from her mistakes. She took from this we didn't live her, didn't consider her as a child, would never forgive and trust her again. That wasn't what we meant, though I agree we werer harsh and made her have a bad time. Fortunately she changed completely, never messed up again, made us proud but could bever see us as loving parents anymore. We tried everything but her life with us was then marked by pain, resentment, she coudn't get over. She never forgave herself and living with us was a terrible emotional pain to her.    And nothing has changed. Though she wrote us off, we know she still has emotional problems, still live those days, though she's a respected young professional. We had 2 daughters, but it's like we had only one. Last week, with the help of some of her freinds we convinced her to talk with us. We travelled 500 miles just to see her, she didn't want to talk with us in her apartment, so we had lunch with her. It was painful, our presence made her relive those days, she got emotionally disturbed, kept repeating the words we said when she begged for our trust. Then she said sorry, can't bear with this, and left. I was terribly upset, she left the restaurant in tears and on the verge of a nervous break down.   We got devastated, why had those things happen when she was 14? I can't understand how it could have a so bad effect. I don't know what to do, seems we lost our oldest daughter.

20090307164231AAAbcG9	Family & Relationships;Family	What can I do to make him leave?	My dad won't leave. My mom and dad had a fight yesterday. It started because my (probably bankrupt from gambling) dad asked my mom for $3500. My dad is a very lazy person. He hasn't had a job that would stick for about five years. He doesn't even try to find one. His excuse is that there is nobody hiring. Once he stole , yes STOLE, $2000 that my grandpa had given me. My parents are already divorced. My dad does nothing for my family. He is also the reason we are so poor. He spent it all on crazy business ideas and gambling.    Last night, when my parents were fighting, my mom said, "Why don't you leave, you don't do anything around here anyways!"   My dad responded," HAH! You want me to leave when I have no money? I'm not leaving that easily. If I were rich you wouldn't want me to leave, would you?"   I hate my dad more than anything in the world because he never listens to anybody and he thinks he's so smart. It irritates me that he won't leave us alone. He also treats my mom horribly. There is no beating, but my dad always yell at my mother. Once, my dad dropped a bowl of food and blamed it on my mom. My mom was just in the living room watching television. How could she have caused him to drop it?   So, now that you know more about him, is there anyway to make him leave? Is there any legal action that would make him leave?

You have to make a lot of pointless sacrifices   8. You are always dragged into doing something that you don't want.   9. Fight a lot      I can go on and on. Married life is so freakin depressing.

20090307165028AA1M73n	Family & Relationships;Friends	I hate my friends. Help?	Friendship. I don't know why, but I'm really starting to hate my friends. I've had this small group of friend since 7th grade and now we're all 9th graders. The more I hang out with them, the more I feel as thought I really hate them. I want to hang out with other people, but when I do they make me feel guilty about it or get mad at me. And I don't want to just flat out say, "I don't want to be your friend anymore."      I still enjoy hanging out with them and all, but their like totally different people during school. That's when I see them the most of the time.      I really enjoy school and I'm a really positive person when it comes to most things. My friends on the other hand absolutely hate school and/or are always complaining about how they hate life or something rather. Their attitude really annoys me.      And then they always tease me and bug me about liking school and crap. It pisses me off to the point where I don't think I ever want to talk to them. And then school ends and their the best friends I've always loved.      I've tried talking to them and it sort of helped with the teasing, but I still hate their attitude towards everything. I don't want to just tell them to change completely or anything.         What should I do? Any bit of advice might help. Thanks in advance and please no rude answers. Thank you.
20090307165053AAqLmk7	Family & Relationships;Friends	Is this guy gay? ?????	okay this guy is kinda my friend, and he is kinda cute   okay but he likes kinda like jefree-starish music and wears skinny jeans and takes like really modelesque photos and this is what he wrote on his myspace about his "best friend" is this really just a bromance and is he gay    "friends name - I love you no matter what. I don’t care what my parents or your mother thinks. I love you. I barely know what we are anymore. This is all becoming confusing and I just end up sad all the time. I want to be around you every second of the day. Sadly, that can’t happen because we don’t go to the same schools. I get to see you about once during the weekend. I hate that. I wish I lived right next to you. I think you’re the only friend that I’ve had that’s actually made me cry. Don’t think of that as a bad thing. Because its not. It just means that I care about you more than anything, and you mean so much to me that it’s worth crying over. I hate every second I’m not able to talk to you. It makes me impatient, arrogant, and pissy. It’s funny, because our friendship used to be held up by texting. We went for about 3 months before we actually met in person. And I was really nervous. I remember wanting to be your friend even before I knew you. I wished every night before I went to sleep that I would someday get to know you. And my wishes came true. I love being your best friend, no doubt. I’m so selfish about you it makes me sick. I want you all to myself and I don’t want to give you up. I hate being that kind of friend, so I don’t show it all the time. I don’t want you to feel that you have to spend every second of your time with me because it’s your choice and you don’t really have to. We’ve done so much. All the good times we’ve had and I can’t think of any bad times. I’m hoping there will be millions more to come. I never want to lose you as a friend. I’m making a promise right now to always keep in touch with you. Even if I’m on the moon and you’re on mars, I’ll still talk to you. Or at least think about you everyday. I will NEVER be able to forget you. I don’t think I’ve ever had a best friend like you. You’re unique and I love that. Don’t ever change for the worse on me. I can tell you everything now and I like that. I don’t think there isn’t one thing on my mind that I don’t tell you. I give you the truth and nothing but the truth. If I’m lying, I feel compelled to come out and say that I am. I absolutely can not stand lying to you. I hate it. It makes me feel like I’m betraying you, and I think a truthful friendship will be much healthier. Now that I think about it, I was a freak before I met you. I used to visit your MySpace page every day. And if you posted a new about me, I would be the first one to read it. Call me a stalker, call me a freak, but I just wanted to get to know you more. You’re really the only person that I enjoy talking to 24/7. That doesn’t mean that I don’t like talking to other people, just that I like talking to you more than anyone else. I was really looking forward to going to Spain with you, but I think I’m too young and that’s why they didn’t pick me. I’m not happy about you going to Florida over the summer. If I’m only going to be able to see you for 2 weeks out of my whole break, I’m going to buy a webcam and talk to you on the phone as much as I can. I don’t know what will happen when we grow old. I hope we’ll still be as good as friends as we are now. Don’t let us drift apart. Please. I hope you go on to follow your dreams. And I’ll do whatever I decide. But no matter what, I’m going to make the best effort to keep you in my life. Once again, I’m becoming too selfish over you. You say that you’re world does not revolve around me. And I know that. But I still hate it. I know it wouldn’t be right because you have to have a life and everything. I still would like it to though. Its never going to happen (: yeah, I’m willing to share you with Deneza. That’s fine with me. I got my phone taken away. And we can’t talk as much. I hate that too. I try as hard as I can to get as much talking time with you. But I still end up drifting off and sleeping on top of my iPod. My life would seriously be nothing without you. I would have to find something to do with the 18 hours that I wouldn’t spend talking to you each day. You’re very fun to be around. And I always envy your MySpace page/ pictures. I know I’m not doing my best for your birthday. I didn’t really get you anything. But I gave you something to remember. I could’ve went and ordered those glasses that you wanted, but my mom said no. I hope you accept late birthday presents (: I’d like to write something that will make you cry, but I’m just not that good yet. Maybe after a couple months I will be able to. When I’m older and withering away, I’m going to write a novel about our life story. Everything that we’ve ever done, everything that we will ever do. Its title: , . When you told be that I was your hero, I almost burst into tears. You make me

20090307165250AATxsny	Family & Relationships;Other - Family & Relationships	How can I get out of this?	Story: It was a Friday and school had let out early and i went to work to pick up my check. i walked to my nephews house (hes older though) to hand out, so we went to the football game at out school and walked around in an indirect path to his house, along the way we ran into 2 of my friends and one other person that i had never seemed before, he was very quiet and shy, but polite, the guy asked me if i could buy him a cheap set markers for a school project and said that his parents hated him and didnt give a damn about him so i felt bad and gladly bought him some markers and after i handed it to him he thanked me and one of those 3 guys came along with me and my nephew and stayed at his house that night. the next day when i left my nephews house my other friend came with me and as we were walking up my street we saw our friend that we saw the night before and went to my house for a half hour and when my mom came home we left and as we were walking down the road my mom called me and told me to come back because she was mad at me, so i told them that i would see them later... never saw any of them again that weekend.      Ok, well everything started october of 2008, i heard rumors in school saying that i did graffiti around my neighborhood and i didn'tt think much of it until 2 days later police arrived at my house while i was babysitting my little brother and sister. one of the two cops that were standing on my front porch was a family friend and seemed upset that i had did something, the other had an attitude with me the whole time and was saying that i did it and that i was going to get interrogatedd at the police station a week later. my mom wasn'tt too upset because i told her my story about what i did that weekend. when we got to the police station, the same cop that was harassingg me on my porch suddenly seemed like a gentlemen now that my mom was present. he showed us photos of the graffiti of what i had supposedly done and 2 other graffiti names that were being blamed on 2 of my friends that i had hung out with that weekend. i told the officer that i had only been with then for a matter of minutes to an hour. after being recorded and saying my story we left the police station. the graffiti was being blamed on me and 2 of the friends that me and my nephew ran into that night. 4 months had passed until court but the court messed up and my lawyer was unaware of the trial so my case was discontinued for another month later. But the other 2 people had to stay and get trialed along with another friend of mine that the police did not tell me about, after court my friend called me and told me that everyone got convicted of 8 accounts of graffiti and got fined $450 each, work 50 hours of community service, and 20-60 days in juvy. but when the guy that i hadnt seen that weekend was called to talk to the judge he kept saying that i didnt do anything over and over until the judge got aggravated and kept repeating himself until the guy said that he saw me do something. the other 2 people had confessed to doing the graffiti and one of them said i never did it, the other guy is the guy that told the police that i did it. everyone there had been to court before. this was my first time and hopefully the last time until i go to get my licence. later on the day i texted my nephew to see if he still wanted to be my alliby and he said that he would see what hes doing that day (obviously doesnt want to because he has to go to court for other reasons) so i backed off and figured i didnt need him because they have no proof that could say that i did it (so i thought) they told me they have me on record buying the markers, i didnt care because that didnt mean anything). a day later he texted me asking why he got subpoenad to appear in court and i told him why that probably was and he got really pissed off and he knew that everyone got convicted already and knew my chances were slim and said hes saving his own ***. he was my only alliby other then the guy that got convicted already and he is going to testify against me.    because of him i am going to get conviicted for a crime that i did not commit and now my dad and my stepmom dont belive my story whatsoever, they believed their lieing grandson that had charges for posession of marijuana, grand larceny, and posession of tobacco, over their own son who had never been to court before.   from the beginning i thought this would be nothing, well now it has come to a point where it is the biggest fear in my life right now and lately ive been more depressed than i have before (my school counseler suggested me to several mental health professionals) and i have been contemplating suicide more than ever. my life was great, my parents always believed me, i loved to help when i could and now they dont trust me at all, i quit smoking a month ago and told my mom and she was proud that i was able to admit that i was smoking and now today i put on body spray and she said i put it on to cover

20090307170355AAx9f2P	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	ANSWERRRRRRR!!!!!!!!!!!  PLZZZZZZZZZZ!!!!!!!!!!?	Ok, so, there's this girl I'm not really sure I like or not. Lets just cut to the chase here. This is the weird part. She says "Hey" to me at school and waves at me sometimes, and said "Hi (my name)" at the dance last night. BUT we used to message each other on MySpace, but now whenever I message her on MySpace she never messages me back. I don't think she thinks I'm annoying, because she says "Hi (my name" and "Hey" and waves at me. So what do you think could possibly be going on.....? I know, it's kinda complicated!?      P.S. I would have asked her to dance at the dance last night, but she was dancing with other people, and I couldn't find her during the slow songs.... and no she was not trying to avoid me.            She does not currently have a boyfriend.         I know she wasn't trying to avoid me because sometimes she was in a seeing distance from me. And at the last 2 slow songs, I was gonna ask her to dance, but she was dancing with someone else when I found her.         She has gotten on her MySpace, because the messages that I send her say "Status: Read" so she reads them. And she's on her MySpace everyday. But now I don't even really bother messaging her.         I couldn't possibly tell her how I feel because I don't know how she feels. It'd be SOOO weird telling her or not having her respond, and knowing that I have to see her in school.... and not knowing what her response was. Or even WORSE she says she doesn't like me, and that makes things WAYYYY awkward between us, and I've just ruined everything, and we don't talk anymore.... I'm not being dramatic because that has happened between me and people. I AM NOT GOING DOWN THAT ROAD ANYMORE. Plus people would make fun of me!!!      I don't follow her, because we don't even hang out at school AT ALL, we just say "Hi" or "Hey" or wave to each other. And she's actually always the first one to greet me!!! We didn't even hang out at the dance either, and we never do. And she was also the first one to greet me at the dance.         I'D LIKE TO MAKE THIS CLEAR TO EVERYONE!!!!!! THE MESSAGES STATE SHE HAS READ THEM, AND HER ICON SAYS "ONLINE NOW" WHENEVER SHE'S ON!!!!!! SHE GOES ON MYSPACE A LOT!!!!!!!!!!!!!         She also made a pic comment of me saying, "omg (my name) your sooooooooooooo hot!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! ilyyy ;)"         We USED to message each other on MySpace!!!      If she wanted me to make the first move, then wouldn't she not greet me at school/school dances?..... Because it's JUST MESSGAES she doesn't reply to ANYMORE.      And like I said, I DON'T MESSAGE HER ANYMORE, because she never replies. And WE NEVER HANG OUT. Just greet each other. So she doesn't feel smothered.         WHEN SHE FIRST SAW ME AT THE DANCE SHE DIDN'T SAY HI, BUT AFTER SHE WALKED BY ME A COUPLE OF TIMES IN THE SNACK AREA SHE SAID, "Hi (my name)"
20090307170401AAXWtun	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	IMPORTANT QUESTION (girls should answer)...Do you believe this guy did a good thing!?	I'm going to write this out in a 3rd person perspective:      There's this story I know about a guy who met this girl online. They are both juniors in high school, him 17 and her 16. He messaged her once and it went from there. They talked religiously to eachother like every day, either through phone (six hours straight once), texting, IM or webcam. He is a poet in way because he enjoys the hobby of writing poetry about specific events in his life, because he feels that writing about them will cause him to one day find out who he REALLY is inside. Him and this girl talked to eachother all the time and they started liking eachother. He wrote her poems that she liked a lot and she always made fun of him in a teasingly way, and it went on for about 3 and a half months. He remembered a lot of details about her and she as well and they would sometimes quiz one another on how much they knew. She told him once that she was so glad she met him. She lived in LA and he lived about 1300 miles away from her, unfortunately. But he asked her out anyway since he knew that he would be able to see her when he went to visit his grandparents who lived near her. She agreed to it, but kept teasing him, saying she never agreed (thats the kind of humor she had, haha). She had to travel for about two hours to see him, but she wanted to, so she did it. He was COMPLETELY nervous about it since he has never done something like that, getting to know someone so well and then finally seeing them in person.   The time they spent together didn't go so well for two different reasons: 1) The date was kindof controlled because she had a time limit and he didn't get to do the things he really wanted to do to with her, since he couldn't drive and his grandparents kept trying to take advantage of the situation. 2) He is normally a pretty shy person, but he knows how to be outgoing with people he knows real well, but he couldn't be his real  self when he was just SO nervous about the whole thing and the situation. Basically, because of these two reasons (maybe there were more), he didn't get to really return the "investment" that was being saved up all that time getting to know eachother, the date was not as satisfying and it was brought to a bad closing. She ended up telling him later that she didn't really feel a connection and just wanted to be friends, and she also blocked his IM, probably because she knew he still liked her and it would be difficult to continue talking to someone you just had some interesting feelings for. That's where the grief came in for him. Here he wanted to just not talk to her and give her LOTS of space and time to heal the wound that had just happened. He traveled back to his hometown and went through immense grief because of it, having lost such a great friend like that and not attempting to talk to her again since he felt it would only make things bad to make contact so soon again. Thats where the idea of his "journey" came into his mind. This girl changed him in a big way, changed his outlook on life I guess you can say. He normally lived a life with not so interesting people in his small town and has never had someone like her come into his life like that, and you can get an idea of the sense of loss he felt after she was gone. He's always had the notion of wanting to travel places and see a lot more of the world when he got older, especially once he became a legal adult at 18. He decided he was going to try and talk to her again but decided to wait a long while before doing so and when he did, he wanted to let her know how much she affected him. SEVEN months went by without any contact and he suddenly turned 18. That is when he contacted her, and he kept his message very short and simple: He told her he was writing a book and wanted to know if she'd be interested to read some of it.    The book he was writing was about his life in general and how some things in his life had affected him (keep in mind, he wasn't looking to publish it or anything big, he was just looking to write something special to himself) and she of course, said that she would like to read some of it, sure. But then he put in motion a "journey" that he had planned for quite a LONG time, all the way since about a month after he returned from california. He was going to go biking through a part of the country, which was something he wanted to do for a good portion of his whole life. He always thought that getting out there in the world in such a big way like that would make him, a good way to describe it would be, to "find himself" out there in the world. But he could only do it once he turned 18, because then he would be considered an adult. So right after he sent her that quick message and verifying if she'd like to read it, he left home and biked for 1300 miles. Along the way, he stopped at many different places and wrote in a journal about his experiences and also wrote poems about it and continued his passion for writing by traveling and seein

20090307172019AAUrd3G	Family & Relationships;Other - Family & Relationships	How do I tell her without being awkward?	Hello,   I recently got married and my husband has an Absolutely wonderful daughter.We are very close because we are alot alike,when I was 8 and even now,and because we went through alot of the things I did as a child.Her mother died when she was 2 so she never really got to know her.I have known her and my husband for four years and we are very close.Apparently in her class the boys talk about sex and girls privates.I feel comfortable enough to teach her about those types of things and I know her dad couldn't handle that.Anyways,though I am comfortable enough I don't know how to describe this.   The other day she came home and told me the boys were talking about pussy and what was that.At the moment I didn't know what to say. I told her I would tell her about it later.My problem is that I don't know how to talk to her about pussy without being to weird or giving to much detail for an 8 yr old.Does anyone have a way to describe it to her.I have contacted the school about the boy's behavior but if they are going to be talking about it I want her to learn so she knows it's wrong.And her father agrees.   Thanks for the help,

20090307171103AAQBoGC	Family & Relationships;Friends	What should I do about not partying?	Okay, so I'm a college freshman and I'm having trouble with my social life. Me and my friends always used to hang out all the time, go to parties like every night and get totally shwasted.  When we came back from winter break I decided that I wasn't going to party hardcore or drink and go out all the time. (It's just really not me.)  I go to a small private college in the middle of no where and there is nothing really to do besides get drunk and go to frats.  My friends still go out all the time and I always stay in ALONE! I feel so left out and when I try suggesting new things to do, they always oppose.  I've tried looking for some new people to hang out with but it seems like everyone decent enough to be considered a friend goes out.  I've of course tried going out without drinking and it is a TOTAL waste of time and NO FUN! I'm transferring schools next term so I really won't have this problem for too much longer but at the moment, I'm totally lost and I feel like such a loser hanging out by myself all the time.  What should I do?

Ok this is strange my husband got word from a co worker that I was sleeping with my boss after work at motel. Well my husband followed me after my work and caught me sleeping with my boss at a motel. After we did our thing we where leaving motel room and my husband was there. He said hello to us both and ask to talk with me privately and told my boss (Gary) to have a nice day. My husband close motel door and I was shocked and thought he was going to freak but instead he just started kissing me and my husband was totally turn on by me sleeping with another guy. He was kissing me all over and had no issues going down on me after I was just with my boss. I never even had time to clean below.  He said he was so turn on that I was with my boss. My husband was asking me all kinds of question on what we did, how big is my boss, how good and was turn on by everything I told him. My husband and I had amazing sex because of it. Is that normal for a guy to be turned by his wife sleeping with someone else? I kept asking my husband if he was upset and mad and he told me no he is so turned on. He is totally ok with me continuing to see my boss after work. My boss is a little confused and doesn’t know if we should still see each other after work but so far we been and my marriage with my husband has never been better. Sex has been better too. Do any men relate to this? Has this happen to other couples? I know I am going to be called a **** by a lot of you women but its not about if I am or not. I just want to know if it’s normal for a spouse to be turned on by there wife seeing someone else.
20090307171921AAD5I4f	Family & Relationships;Weddings	Is my fiance really worth it?	I'm asking this because i need to understand if i am being irrational or he really isn't worth being with....sorry if this is really long, it's just really complicated.....we've been together nearly a year and it started out amazing and 90% of the time it still is but i've noticed he has a really angry side and gets angry at the smallest of things, for example, me not getting out of bed straight away as soon as he asked to take him home, he had a hissy fit and started calling me lazy, selfish and over sensitive because i get upset when he shouts at me. he says he cant cope with me when i am down because i get down about silly things....i disagree with him, i am down sometimes because i have had some money trouble and i have recently had an abortion and 100% regret it and hate myself for it, i did it because he wanted me to and somehow convinced myself or maybe he convinced that it was the right thing to do. i dont feel like he's given me a chance to grieve and gets angry at me when i try and talk to him about it. when i say im going out with friends the first thing he says is for me not to cheat on him, which i would never do, i really do love him but i feel like he is trying to change me, saying things like grow up and that im childish, selfish and over sensitive. I am actually starting to believe all these things but only because like i said 90% of the time he's great.Please help, please tell me i'm not convincing myself....i really dont know :(

He is an alcoholic and has had numerous major drug problems. He tried committing suicide about 7 months ago. The doctors had to revive him. He disappeared and I didn't see or hear from him for 3 months. He has no job and stays with friends. He just called last night, talked to our daughter. She had tried calling a bunch of times but he never returned her phone call. Anyway, he said he wants to see her tomorrow and take her somewhere. I told him we need to take it slow, and requested he come to my place and visit here. He told me if I don't let him take her by himself that he was walking away from the situation. What do I do now? My daughter is 7. She loves her dad. She cries for him all the time. I don't feel I'm being unreasonable. Thanks to all who take the time to answer.

20090307155650AAJHy7n	Family & Relationships;Other - Family & Relationships	Did you find meaning in life?	I'm a 21 year old college student, who doesn't like my major and just doesn't care anymore. I don't even know who I am nor passionate about anything. I just feel like I'm kind of drifting along. Adding to that, I've never been in a relationship, which is fine with me..but I'm not even sure of my sexuality and would never want to kiss a guy. (I kissed a guy before...and just know that I wouldn't want to do it again. I could possibly see myself in a emotional relationship with a guy, but not a physical.   I would say I'm an extremely philosophical person, kind of interested in nihilism, because I don't really believe life has meaning. But part of me wants to find my own meaning and truth.   Adding to that, I've never really had close friends, and don't share my emotions with anyone. Part of me is like, what's the point, we're all just going to die? What's the point of any of this?      I know that I can't look to anyone else or anything to make me happy. I have to make myself happy...and I am trying to really get to know and love myself...but I just can't seem to get there..?

Something that sounds like it's from us (not a made up poem) & about 3 lines or so.

20090307173521AAuJ4kQ	Family & Relationships;Other - Family & Relationships	I need some advice please..I cant figure this guy out!?	I have known this guy (23) for over a month through my friend. At first, I didnt really notice him too much and kissed his roomate (while drunk) I found out the roomate is a manslut so I just forgot about him and started talking to the other guy. My friend told me that he is looking for a girlfriend and actually respects women. I also heard that while he is outgoing, he is a little shy when it comes to asking girls out and he is used to girls chasing him. I have gone over to their house a lot and everytime, I would make small talk with the guy but when we were both drinking, we would get into deep conversations and find out about each other. Last night, we finally kissed and he wanted to have sex but I said "Im not that kind of girl" and he said "I know youre not but you cant blame a guy for trying because you're sexy as hell" I told him I liked him and asked how he felt about me and he said that I was "very cool" I said that I dont have sex without a commitment and asked him if he wanted to go slow and try dating and he said "I dont know, we'll see." I told him about kissing his roomate and a few weeks ago I saw him kissing his friend while drunk but I know that is all they did and I told him "I guess we are even now." He was a gentleman and walked me home. He asked for my number and I said call me tomorrow and he said "I just might do that" but still hasnt called and he is going clubbing with the boys tonight. I dont know how he feels about me. I mean obviously he is willing to have sex with me but does he want to date me? Should I be worried?

I'd like to marry my boyfriend - or thought I did - until I realized just how different a lifestyle I lead from his mother... Different beliefs, stuff like that.  And I mean BIG differences, about as black and white as you can get.  She really meddles in the relationship, and I really can't handle it.  I fear that if I marry him I'll end up having to deal with very uncomfortable things like her telling me how to raise my children (as far as beliefs go, etc)...  So, in your experience, is a crazy mother-in-law a reason not to get married?

Then i will most probably get feedback,  but i know my best-friend might hide the worst his got to say but i am shy so i cant do it in person or phone or email. is my 16th wohoo!.      i was thinking she could start it this way like "hey karl, is keisha's B.D did you get her a gift, he'll say no because he doesn't speak to me that much and she'll say shame because she likes you out of everyone she met"      or i wud tell her to say keisha like you to karl.

20090307163429AAG3zP7	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	Whats a funny Myspace comment/message to send to a teenage kid as a joke (ATTACHED to this funny photo image)?	 http://img27.imageshack.us/my.php?image=...          He's a good kid, he just ended up wtih community service for doing something dumb. His dad allowed him to have myspace finally, and he just got his first girlfriend 2 months ago. He's 14      Something funny to go with the image like "oh you better watch" or... or something along the lines of that.      The image is of the wonderful and famous Samuel Jackson from the movie "black snake moan". He's the best. It just happens to be a funny image. THanks =]
20090307174023AA0HkdL	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Boy Problems! Is he begin dramatic?	There's this boy he is very quiet. He is a junior and I am a senior. One day at lunch my best friend asked me who that boy is and I said his name is John and that he seems nice but is very quiet. Well I think someone at my lunch table heard me and told him what I said so when I got home I went to check on his online away message and it said "Think im quiet probably because you never said anything that I could respond to, so pissed off." Why would he be "pissed off"?   I didn't mean it in a bad way Im really quiet too. I want to talk to him but I am scared to and he keeps looking at me but wont talk. He stears at me alot but wont say anything, my friends tell me he is a psycho for acting all dramatic..then one day he had on his away message saying " I have given up on you." Then it said "No one takes me seriously eh its all good"   what does he mean?    I know though away messages where about me because it happened the day that I said he was quiet.   why is he getting all mad?      also my teacher changed our seats in class and he sits up front now and I sit in the back and he gets like nervous and I always see him looking out of the conner of his eyes and sometimes he will get up to get a tissue witch is right near my desk but wont talk but just stear?   Tell me what you think.   Also,He has never had a girlfriend and doesnt talk to many girls

20090307174010AA3hiMp	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	Need suggestions about divorce?	My husband is a good man,  but shows little attention to me.  Its been like this for many years and I have talked to him till I'm blue in the face. I'm lonely most of the time and he does not seem to care.  We have two children 5 and 8.  He does not help much with them and I am with them at home alone.  We have known each other since I was 14 and I am now 35 and he is 41.  We dated until I was 20 and married.   He has always been independent and I was also, until the children came along.  Now it seems I'm the only one that takes care of them and I do not mind,  but it would be great if he was to help.  This has not happen since they have been born.  Now to the root of the problem.   The subject of divorce has come up a time or two and this is his reply.   The first time I mentioned it he said he would kill me if I divorced him and this scared me.  The second time it was mentioned he threaten to kill himself and had poison that he was going to drink.  I took it away from him.  The feelings I have from him are not there like before and never will be the same.   I do not want any harm to come to anyone,  but I'm not happy with the way things are now.  He has been trying to make things right,  but I feel its to late.  Anyway I also feel he would just go back to the way he was before in a matter of time.  With out going into details,  let me say I can not get away from this relationship within the next year without the possiablity of a dangerous situation.  He seems to think he owns me and a women place is not the same as mens.  I would like some  opinions on how I can handle this.
20090307174009AAVwOpH	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	I told him I won't sleep with him?	I just met this guy a few weekends ago randomly at a party. He doesn't get a hold of me very often except for on the weekends and what not, he is in the Army if that helps. I know he is really busy during the week and doesn't have time to do anything because he is still in school so whatever not like i really care either way. So he texted me tonight asking if I'd like to come to his place to 'chill'. last time we were together, things got a little frisky and i ended up leaving before i ended up sleeping with him. I told him i was busy tonight with some friends and he asked if i could come over and chill tomorrow then he'll take me out to breakfast. I know exactly what chill means so i straight up told him I'm not going to sleep with him and like, i understand that he wants sex but i have too much respect for myself to do that with someone outside of a relationship. i didn't really word it like that but whatever. so then he said that i'm freaking him out and he just wanted to chill because i'm a cool girl. now i feel like an idiot. i didn't mean to freak him out at all.. i'm definitely not one of those people.. i just thought if the guy wanted a piece of a$$ i might as well tell him up front that he won't get it rather than playing games with him.. or am i in the wrong here?
