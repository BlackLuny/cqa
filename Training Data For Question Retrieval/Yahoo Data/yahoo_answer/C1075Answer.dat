b68cb130bd5473016fa285d79b2e6333aa	In my opinion Lukas Podolski is the deserving winner of the Young Player Award. Not that the rest are not good. Most of the world hasn't known who Podolski is before start World Cup Finals. He certainly become more prominent when he and klose scored most of the goals for Germany in the tournament.|`|e8ffb468fdbbc65a436afe47872f894baa	Cristiano Ronaldo should have won it and probably would have had Portugal reached the final.    But Podolski isn't a bad choice either.|`|a45f2f51507158ee9fadaab1576e886eaa	Cristiano Ronaldo!! i cant belive he didnt win though..that Podalsko won just cuz hes GERMAN..that's probably the only reason..lol but idk.. they are both good players..but Ronaldo has my vote.. i dont understand why they made us vote if they were gonna pick the winner themselves..so i think that was really point less..but GO CRISTIANO RONALDO!!|`|6df4097400362ee8bfc71e8546d6d8b1aa	Just not german piggy head (Podolski) he is nice man born in Poland and just he is living  in Germany.|`|AA12187978	Don't call Podolski a piggy head!

C. Ronaldo probably wouldn't have deserved it because of lack of goals and alleged unsporting behavior.  Messi is probably the best of the players, but he didn't play enough to merit much consideration.  Schweinsteiger would have gotten my vote, he is only 21 after all.|`|f9c0af39ff27b9ea2050dafee9d8c966aa	Lionel messi, but Lukas podolski won it..

Fjz9rGyraa	Like you wrote is very unlikely because of Kobe and Shaq salary and mainly beacuse that would take to trade Wade for Kobe and I don't think that the Heat would do that. Two reasons why: first, the difference of age and that their skill level is not to much of a difference. Wade still can improve, he's not in his prime yet. Second, Shaq ma y have supported Kobe on his statement, but that doesn't mean that he likes Kobe as a person or would like to play along side of him, instead of keep playing with Wade. Although I'll give you that is very cool thought!.|`|8i2cfIMtaa	i thought i had an answer for this question, but i just dont know what to say|`|c2V1QvB5aa	yes it is, but I don't think Kobe is going anywhere. He is just putting the Lakers front office in the spot, to make something big happen for sure, like getting Garnett, or Jermaine O'neal. And I think you will see a good and improved Lakers next year with Kobe running the show. Look out West the Lakers are coming back. And who knows we might see them in the finals next year.|`|wgMXtO5aaa	I don't think so, shaq pays for women, Kobe is a <br>  gentleman that treats women right, he does not have<br>  to pya like Shaq...<br>  <br>  I think Shaq still remembers that ... does not want to<br>  get in that situation again .. Shaq's wife does not want<br>  Kobe near Shaq either.|`|4XfNLoS8aa	Heat wouldn't trade Wade for Kobe so it will never happen|`|59d038792cffdac9cf4a3d90ccea79a2aa	yeah it can happen the heat are nine million plus over the cap so they just have to make a deal?? and get kobe with and trade some of their veteran and make cap room so......|`|7IzlD6bgaa	great thought but like you said highly unlikely|`|AA11807203	cant happen dawyne doesnt get paid enough so the heat doesnt have enough money to get him so yea sorry|`|wgjhm8y4aa	It won't happen.  Even before Shaq left for Miami, the two of them just had differences.  Just because they share the same feeling about the Lakers doesn't mean they have forgotten about their personal differences.  Let's face it.  Shaq is no longer the player he once was, and Dwayne Wade is a peak performer whom is much younger than Kobe.  I think Miami would be foolish to give up a player of of such high caliber for Kobe who comes with a high price tag and has a lot of miles considering he is only 28 years old.  Besides, if Kobe wants to win now, he should seriously consider taking a look at the Phoenix Suns who could easily dump Marion and Diaw and some draft picks for him.  Nash, Amare, Kobe, Raja and a drafted big man...that would be an outstanding squad!|`|NaI2wAHzaa	The Heat would have to be stupid enough to trade Dwayne Wade.  It's not going to happen.  Kobe has too much baggage to be traded for DWade.<br>  <br>  But if I'm the Grizzlies, or the Celtics, why not try and put the two of them back together?  Shaq is slowly sliding towards retirement, and Kobe has his problems.  Those two will take 70% of the shots and have the ball 60% of the time, so three rookies could fill the other positions.  And the seats might be full....|`|AA12360723	yea but unfortuantl its never going to happen
G8F2zkn2aa	The Lions have improved considerably this off-season and should be in store for a drastic jump in wins this year. They also solidified their QB situation for the future by drafting an awesome player in Drew Stanton. They could have anywhere from 6 to 10 wins and could conceivably win the NFC North.|`|6de9d780784e3c5d6b28a0dc0a8cf6dcaa	They will have descent yr but they aint getting to the superbowl they still have to make a better running game and fix the offensive line who ever the qb he needs time so he can throw to the receivers.|`|Cfep7wheaa	Detroit did not really fill their needs through the draft and therefore will struggle.  Their offensive line is overrated and will not do any better than last year.  Also like you said Kevin Jones will be out for a while and they have to count on Tatum Bell and TJ Duckett to carry the load. They do have some talent but I still think they will be picking in the top 10 again next year.|`|wDjS9gLNaa	of course they will....look at the scores from last season....so many way close...this yr. the lions will turn some of them 3 point loses into 5 point wins....Detroit Lions should go 9-7 this yr.|`|6pr9hGERaa	6-10 is most likely how they will finish.  8-8 a slight possibility.  No chance for the playoffs this year.|`|76a14bbf0c24f195fdb28dd354d80789aa	NO.  What has Matt Millan done consistantly over the past few drafts?  There is no way the lions will be 6-10.  Yes Johnson is a good player, but who is throwing to him?  Plus, the scedule.  The AFC West is the best division in football and so they will lose at least 3 of those 4.  Chicago and Minnesota will beat them twice, and so could Green Bay.  They also get the NFC East, the second best division in football and they will again lose at least 3 of 4.  This puts them at 3-11with games against Tampa and Arizona.  The Cardinals will be better this year, but Detroit will beat the Bucs, putting them at 4-12, an improvement, but not enough of one.|`|JLZxdtuCaa	the lions will win more games it hard to stop a 6'5 wideout in calvin that can run my most cb and go over any cb and you no what roy can do and they got better on the offense line|`|mY0pmXdxaa	6 wins max - still going to struggle to stop other teams when it counts.<br>  Look at their schedule - its brutal<br>  Going to have to win a lot of 38-35 games|`|f371c0dc9701a6e16fcb7e488a7909c8aa	maybe|`|d81b576e57b5acf2f3f9ac6ecd40a51faa	They will have a shot if Drew Stanton gets the opportunity to beat out Jon Kitna for the starting qb job.<br>  <br>  Kitna was the main reason the Lions were bad last year. He led the league in picks and some of those picks came in crucial moments of very close games that completely turned the tide.<br>  <br>  I think 9-7 is possible for them this year. <br>  Green Bay is old and all of their players are gone.<br>  Minnesota is rebuilding.<br>  Chicago is ok but could go either way.

4349e8160556cc383c890ace0bee032caa	Es una pregunta algo complicada de responder, pero si analisas a detalle el tipo de juego al cual esta acostumbrado el Tricolor y por las caractersticas de sus jugadores atacantes podrs concluir lo siguiente:    1) Bravo, Kikin, que son jugadores luchones, que no tienen la atribucin el tiro de media distancia, son jugadores sobre todo Bravo acostumbrados a jugar por la banda, al desborde y a terminar la jugada dentro del area.    2) Jugadores como Borgetti, que su unica funcion es jugar de poste ( solo remata de cabeza y si la toca con el pie da un pase) no tienen la capacidad de jugar con los pies por su carente tecnica con los pies.    3) Franco es un delatero que muy rara vez recibe la pelota de frente al arco, no posee las cualidades de voltear al arco con gran vicion sino que sus opciones son las de abrir el juego por medio de un pase.    4) La media mexicana, que posee jugadores con atribuciones para el uso del tiro de media distancia, Pavel, Morales, Torrado, Guardado etc..., sin embargo no utilizan esta variante por el juego por extremos que muestra Mexico (En la justa mundialista la mayoria de los goles todos fueron a pase por un extremo del campo ya sea a balon dominado o pelota parada). Que yo recuerde los ultimos jugadores que no carecian de la variante de media distancia son Garcia Azpe y el propio Luis Garcia que tenia una media vuelta formidable.|`|db7b00dbc95f7a0863cdbc6b55634587aa	PORQUE NOS ESTRENA UN ARGENTINO U_U|`|93b1ca87851a5beb36611194a8b228f6aa	No hay confianza de los jugadores de que si pueden anotar un gol desde fuera del rea, de hecho esa fue la diferencia en el partido contra Argentina en el Mundial|`|66f0a7736d6a8c12e2375782ab93899caa	Por que hay muchos que simplemente no se atreven o no tienen la capacidad, pero si yo fuera futbolista creeme que si lo haria de echo me gusta mucho ese tipo de disparos.    viva mexico!!!|`|6ee1a3c86108df3671eb425d60553a6faa	Porque creen que es mas fcil desde adentro del rea y no tienen la suficiente confianza para tratar todas desde afuera|`|9eb4c0ae2902aad49adb222b93b1522faa	por pena x que piensa que la va regar|`|AA10975730	?Por qu en Mxico todos creen que podremos ganar la copa del mundo?  ?Por qu Rafa Mrquez levanta los brazos cuando el baln se acerca? ?Por qu??????!!!!|`|b64825764aa2580e41709b9b8afc9004aa	porq es el estilo sudamericano, aqui en argentina es igual y asi nos va en los mundiales;somos poco efectivos porque no usamos otras opciones de gol|`|c757cd0efd70c7c0c7191205af7ffc33aa	Porque el estilo de juego de los jugadores y de la mayoria de los equipos de america en especial los sudamericanos es asi el jugador es gambetero y casi siempre hace jugadas vistosas y trata de llevarse a todos y los mexicanos no se quedan atras.|`|11cdb3444f1a54140c4143b92fcf862caa	Porque por mas que entrenan patea mejor un amateur que un profesional.

RcXug1OWaa	You don't have enough speed to create separation by blowing by a guy, so you have to be sharp on your routes and always make sure you are between the ball and the defender. Your going to have to definately be physical though to earn your keep on the field.  Since you have good hands a five yard bump and run would be ideal.  If you can, watch some game film on guys like Chris Carter, Tim Brown, Keeshawn Johnson. Great hands and can create separation.  But you also have to take what the defense gives you. If he's playing you tight then you have to fight him off for your route, or if he's playing you deep then you own him within 10 yards.|`|2fa0c14266b4adfa5e7018131d478e57aa	Are you tall?<br>  <br>  Try shortening your steps (pitty-pat steps) when going into breaks.

This site lets you add up the totals for ANY amount of games from any period in baseball history.<br>  <br>  For example, run a search for "Helton;" it will open Todd Helton's page. On the line right above where the stats begin, click "Gamelogs" (it's next to "Batting  Glossery/..."). The page it opens up is interactive. The red and blue numbers can be clicked on to provide you with certain cumulative sets from preset temporal parameters (such as career numbers up through the game you choose). However, if you want to define which games you want total stats from, all you have to do is click on the black stat lines of the first and last game in your set. So, to see the cumulative stats for Helton's last 21 games, click somewhere on the BLACK text of any of the stats for career game number 1480 (the career game numbers are found in the left-most column). Twenty-one games before 1480 would be game number 1460, so now click on the black stats somewhere on the career game 1460 row.

OBh7uEd1aa	YET   damn right coyotes skunks fox  bob cats   possoms bats cats dogs horses stock,,, generly shoot dead  them once more// burn in place with tires an wood, ,,, there not all foamed up   either, last thing you think of  ,, especially after  lookin at pups an cats at flea market,, then the sherif calls,,an the hand scrubbin begins  an you start watchin the other folks  you were with // scary stuff // later pull the whip cream joke on the others,, boy scared the hell out of granny..|`|h2KkiKK3aa	he told you to shoot them so if they have rabies, that they can't infect any other animals from dogs to even humans.  if you do shoot one, you should have rubber gloves and burn the body, so no other animal comes and eats it and gets rabies too.  they burn them.  I'd watch everything personally, especially if their acting weird like being too tame, attacking, out of place like staying up during the day when their supposed to be sleeping like opossums and raccoons, drooling and really sick looking, never handle a rabies infected animal without gloves, dangerous.  I'd still watch your animals closely even though they have their shots, you never know if the vaccine was bad.|`|HMgDJ8EEaa	lol that Christain S. is a dumb a$$  anyways I'm sure your dad will know what to do with the dead animal. I would look out for the coons especially those things....man there vicious. Stay away from those things. Keep your dog's and cat safe as possible. Even if they have there rabies shot it can still affect them just not as much. But anyways I would defiantly shot any of those critters.   Be Safe!|`|AA11729094	Rabies affects the brains of infected animals, it WILL change their habits, if you see a rabid critter, then kill it if it's possible, then LEAVE it right where it drops.Coons and possums may be nocturnal by nature, but if infected they may roam during broad daylight and be dangerous to you, your pets, other critters etc. If you can't shoot it, call animal control to report a rabid critter, they'll do everything they can to catch and "dispose" of it.|`|nooi0ldjaa	they take it out and kill it(by gasing it), and burn the body. when they "dispose" of it.      your dad wants you to kill coon's and opossums because that's one less critter that can get it around your house.  don't worry, its not like your going to run out of them. trust me. and if i were you i'd be taking coyotes out to.    but if you get your dog's their shots, they should be ok, thats why they give them a rabies shot too.    "and what other critters should i watch out for too?"  any other mammals near you or your animals.|`|6KaMW1Vzaa	Good and consistent advice from all. Coons are statistically the second most commonly infected animal, bats being  1. Possums and cats are more likely to be rabid than dogs. Rabbits and rodents pose no risk.  Be careful with the disposal, as others noted.|`|AA11694178	Your dad is right in killing such animlas as posoms and coons if they are coming around your house (providing you live oujtside an incorporated area).  These animals can carry rabies.  Rabid animlas loose thier fear of humans and will be more likely to come around your house.  True, they show a greter liklihood of coming out in daylight than non-infected animlas but rabid animals still do move about at night.  When an animal becopmes infected with the rabies grems, he will have a period of time before he exhibits the classic symptoms and during this time he can infect another animal or you.  If there is a rabies outbreak in your area, be very careful about wild or domestic animlas that are not acting normal.  If you kill a rabid animal or one that you suspect of being rabid, pick it up with a shovel and put it where other animals can't get to it.  You will need to notify your game warden and he will take it for testing.    I think it quite a show of confidence that your dad shows in you to allow you to use a rifle on your own.  Use his confidence in you wisely so that he will always feel that way.  At all times, be safe.  Be safe with guns, be safe around animals and be safe around strangers.|`|WGP5E9X5aa	lol, "dispose"= kill, im not sure how.  I wouldnt want to get close to it.  Some states just shoot them...quick and painless|`|DV4xyeChaa	what do i think?   ive seen some rabid animals..South West Virgina.  1 a crazy raccoon got slobber on my friend and bit her dog...both got 21 day shot schedule  2 i saw a baby raccoon crossing the road at 2 in afternoon...like a idiot i put on my gloves and picked it up...brought it to vet because it acted like it was having seizures,,[i know i said im an idiot]..it died 2 days later and was found to be rabid,,,no i didnt get shots or rabies  3 last yr a raccoon was running all over the hood acting crazy but took off before anyone could shoot him/her|`|dpSr0icwaa	your dad told you to kill and coon and possum you see because if you see one during the day 95% likely it is rabid.  If you see one during the night, while that is more likely, it still stands a pretty good chance of being rabid, as even at night most coons and possum will be successful at avoiding people.  So an animal you end up seeing at night probably has a 25% chance of being rabid.  By the time you get the gun, if that animal is still in the vicinity, then it is probably a 95% chance it is rabid.      Shoot and put in a garbage bag.  Use a stick or a glove to put it in the garbage bag, then burn the animal, bag, and whatever you used to put the animal body in the bag.  Then burn another load of old papers and junk on top.|`|MPavjXO6aa	Good advice so far, but here in Germany, all hunters are encouraged to kill fox at all times of year due to the fact that they are routinely infected with Rabies (Tollwut in German) and the Lesser Tape Worm.  Most often times, these infections can be spread to other animals and to humans. While in your particular area, you may be encouraged to kill these animals on sight, make sure that you are in accordance with your local and state statutes regarding the taking of wild game. Fox maybe different than possom or raccoon, but just be sure that you aren't violating any laws when you shoot one. If you do take one of these animals, make sure that you protect yourself while disposing of it and if you can, take it to a vet to determine if it is indeed infected.
MPavjXO6aa	You have a lot of options available to you. There are different types of forestry and wild game management positions in Federal, State and private enterprise.     Start looking at each state's Dept of Land and Natural Resources or Dept of Fish and Game.There is everything from game management, to law enforcement and forest management, search and rescue as well as counter narcotics.    Some jobs do require an associate's degree in any discipline of forestry or wildlife management, other positions can be had without college but with experience from the US Military or other Federal Organizations. You have to realize though, that the more education you have behind your resume', the better you'll look on paper. This also doesn't take into account your physical conditioning and ability- most jobs in the forestry service that are outdoors in nature have certain physical requirements. One good place to look is www.usajobs.gov and you can search for federal positions that will tell you up front what is a requisite educational background.    I am planning on retiring in a few years, and opening up a hunting reserve, so we need good game wardens and wildlife managers to keep our game wild, healthy and viable. Good luck!|`|f3f63c87e27f64c3e9f1679c165409b8aa	I'm assuming there are probably lots of jobs within the Forestry Department that don't require a degree.  The problem is that those jobs are highly sought after and probably have lots of competition for them so you probably don't stand much of a chance without a degree.|`|DV4xyeChaa	1 there are forestry courses in collage...better go  2 Competition is tough for state/federal jobs   3 go to US forest service...or [whatever state] dept of forestry...or state fish and game dept if you are bent that way|`|OBh7uEd1aa	start leaning toward  law enforcement via ride along,,   an theres a chance due to the nessesities of same in what was a out door field, that has evolved into law enforcement,, other fire , related .. general  vacationer go that way director, ,,then maintaince of areas,, trails  habitat,  ,personel,

3ULjjUNlaa	Well, I'll say teams best is Lidstrom or Datsyuk    For Nick... the first pick in the NHL Draft, because we can work with later picks... and a top line defenseman, like Mike Green    For Datsyuk--the first pick in the NHL Draft and a likely pick for next years first pick in the NHL Draft and a first line forward who is locked up for long term around Dats price.

dDhTMacAaa	Well, Wade does a ton for fantasy teams and he has been amazing this season.    But, Duncan has been very, very, very good all across the board, even with assists and some blocks here and there. Nate is a good scorer but doesn't do much else.    If you need a big man, it isn't bad.    Personally I would try for a little more though, for a uy like Wade.    good luck|`|Pa3LKeBtaa	no. Dwayne Wade is putting up good figures right now, is an all-star and an mvp prospect.

595902780e2c09920890743b229c9c08aa	I think your idea is brilliant. Nascar needs to change things up every so often to get the Nascar fence walkers aboard like we are. It would help Nascar in the sponsorship dollars.    I don't know if you can do it or not, but send your idea to Nascar and see what happens. Probably nothing but at least you tried.

Sad but true.|`|ziPiHdcHaa	i like it seems to put more on people that are good though|`|i8soZLfRaa	Try keeping track of it on your own. Track/Review the results and compare them to both to the current system and the old system. It would be easy enough to set up a spreadsheet or a set of spreadsheets (if you want to be able to sort by leaders on a weekly basis) to do the math for you. All you would have to do is type in the points for each race based on the system you are using. It would take a little extra time, but you could automate points awarded to finishing position to simplify things. This may allow you to directly import data from official results on NASCAR.com.    It might even be interesting to go back a few years.    When you have definitive results, share them with Yahoo Q&A & for review/comments.      Edit: It only took me less than 5 min to build a spreadsheet and import the data & delete the irrelevent data from last year to get a race-for-race comparison between Jimmie J. and Mark M.|`|yt4PN1R4aa	sorry dude but I don't feel like reading this.|`|Qw4l9R68aa	I like the idea of no points for 36th through 43rd but I'd like bonus points for the pole sitters in there.

If you need a play-off, you need to be a football, or baseball fan..  If you need shorter races watch the Nationwide series, or WoO, or IRL...  It's OK with me if anyone isn't satisfied with NASCAR, they are welcome to go elsewhere...  Please don't come here for a couple of years, and try to make changes to my sport..  You don't do that with any of the other sports.. They would laugh at you if you even tried...|`|EHtFxGxMaa	I like the idea of thinking outside the box.

The key to their offense is Larry Fitzgerald and Kurt Warner's ability to complete short passes, that's not going to happen against the Steelers.    Steelers might lose if the following happens:    A) Roethlisburger chokes and throws a horrible game  B) The Steelers D blitzes constantly and allows the short completions to Fitzgerald (Man-Man cover)  C) Bad calls by the officials which we've seen a lot of throughout the season|`|bdTxnZg7aa	cardinals because i hate the steelers. who do you want to win?|`|AA10342692	the cards because i always go for the underdog (evidenced by the fact i was one of the few people on answers who correctly predicted last years superbowl outcome)|`|PECWaLnAaa	cardinals   just to give cubby  fans another reason to cry   if the cards dont win its still not a loss they have 39 more years and counting to win a title   GO WHITE SOX !!!!!!!!!

af8a53d818d9eccc44276375b03f40c0aa	Well, I really hope so. Punk has been out down latley. Why would vince have punk suffer his first loss to hardcore holly? Thats a JOKE!!!! What's wrong with vince. Punk is one that ACTUALLY has talent and he should be ecw champ. He is just stuck in retarted matches|`|55924ff2fad0b520bee69199bd0830bdaa	Well, Punk was, inofficially, the "project" of Paul Heyman. Paul liked him alot, loved his wrestling style and wanted him to be successful. McMahon never liked him, neither did Stephanie and HHH. Now Paul has no power any more, and McMahon has a grudge against him (he claims that Paul was responsible for December to Dismember, though everyone else says he is only the scapegoat, because McMahon screwed it up), so Punk has no more supporters backstage. None of the other officials dares to support him, because he was "Paul's Project", and McMahon would be angry on everybody who tries to help Punk. So, I guess Punk should go to another promotion as soon as possible. He is a good wrestler, so he can make it everywhere else.|`|05e0938136cd75ae06163b928bc23b86aa	push him how|`|AA10440464	they may be working on changeing his chacter to a heel or they may bring him into wwe itseflf who knows with vince|`|fb37e72a27b53be72dc74e2353b0906caa	seems like theyr doing it slowly. hopefully him and lashley for wrestlemania.

For me, i was born in 1978 so i m a Horse Woman.     Horse people are said to love travel. They are energetic, intelligent and ambitious. They can also impatient, hotheaded and egotistical. They have a great sense of humor and fall in love easily.    The female horse is often the life of the party although just as happy in their warm, comfortable home. Dignified yet loving of bright, colorful clothes the female horse enjoys working with her hands and creating crafts.    The male horse can be impulsive and erratic. Freedom is a top priority so the male horse is often slow to settle down with one woman. Charming and hard to resist, older males make the better mate if you are looking for a long term, stable relationship.    Best matches are horse to tiger, dog or goat.    Beware of horse to rat, snake, ox, monkey or pig.     and this is you, Michy Giovanni--> YOU ARE A SNAKE    The Snake:    1917, 1929, 1941, 1953, 1965, 1977, 1989, 2001    Snakes have magnetic personalities. Charming and sophisticated in a sexy way, they usually have a good sense of humor but can be jealous and overly possessive. The snake seldom lets anyone know what he or she are truly thinking and are known to be secretive.    The female snake is bewitching and sophisticated. She dresses well with special attention to the tiny details.    The male snake isnt strong in the communication department. With a Don Juan personality he often finds attractive women hard to resist, even when he already has a mate. In regards to that mate he can be very possessive though.    Best matches are snake to snake, ox, goat or rooster.    Beware of snake to tiger, pig, horse or monkey.       :-)    Cheers guys,  Katej|`|Dyx2y7lVaa	1995|`|5qRJUFeIaa	1690 watp wasp glitter-dome nonce|`|cttRd8Yqaa	1969|`|VgwXLHl5aa	I believe it was 1991 that i was bought into this world.|`|7Tw7s6HSaa	1986|`|217ff35a8ea8ca73e63af6072240aa24aa	1961 ya young numpties|`|bMaK4KQTaa	1994|`|8IzeMTmLaa	1992.|`|EAuMJrs4aa	1980|`|F8m1VaoYaa	dont know someone told me my date of birth  is engraved in some historic cave somewhere  up north in them there hills whatever that   means.
QYfvgFsXaa	Everyone plays football. It's because you don't need to book a court or buy equipment, all you need is something to kick and two objects to put down as a goal.  Badminton is probably more popular than tennis in parts of the world, mainly Asia and I know far more badminton players where I live, than tennis players as it's cheaper to book a court and they are usualy better quality than the tennis courts.|`|CxmXiCGzaa	badminton isn't very entertaining to watch and small kids look up to football players so they start playing football.|`|nYLzis9Saa	I like both badminton and football too but I think the reason is probably because badminton is a sport people prefer to play that watch and people like playing or watching football.    Team sports are also generally more popular too.|`|LdJFFvSVaa	Badmington isn't as popular! Simple.|`|nJ5kceMBaa	I like playing badminton, but badminton just doesn't appeal to as many people as football does. I wouldn't want to watch much badminton - it's not exactly the most entertaining spectacle.|`|s94e8F6eaa	The first 3 alphabets of the word "badminton" is self explainatory of the game.....BAD!
40kCOPicaa	i think derby can win on penalties, then kick Man u out of the FA cup is the best!
pSiwm8rmaa	Penn is most overrated fighter ever in MMA. He is knocked out.|`|g7xaB57Xaa	Though on both sides with the kind of attraction this match is getting, I'm not surprised (with their history and whats at stake too!) were hearing cocky remarks from both guys, maybe more from Penn indeed from what I've seen so far.  But not only is there that notion that being a bit cocky and feeling a bit superior can help your spirit in a fight, but again these guys have a heated history, so I'd be lame for me to be hearing Penn act so cocky against a guy he's never fought.  How bad would Muhammad Ali have looked if he had lost a third of the fights he had fought after making even one cocky remark beforehand?    The only things I hope for this fight; 1. The fight isn't too timid through out and goes to a unan. dec. at that. 2. The feel out part of the fight doesn't go into the end of the second round. 3. The fight isn't over in 30 seconds, especially if the loss is a fluke.|`|rmhfMtQjaa	Honestly, I can't pick a fighter I would rather see win.  I think they are both on top of their game and it will be a great fight.  Penn may have been brought up differently (wealthy), but that doesn't make him any less of a fighter.  GSP on the other hand worked hard for everything he has, and if he wasn't so cocky, I would probably root for him.  The first fight was very evenly matched and I think that they both have progressed in leaps and bounds since then.  It will be great, but I honestly couldn't intelligently put my money on either.|`|Cg8rKbaJaa	Penn doesn't come off as a very likable guy from the primetime show and interviews he does. So I'm with you on this one. GSP knocking him out would be great.|`|sLVGdCOTaa	I think Penn is too full of himself-Did you hear him on Rome the other day? so cocky, Although there is no doubting his ability, But I've watched them both their entire mma careers, and I think Pierre will win for sure, Many reasons for this opinion, Pierre is heavier, taller, better conditioning, seems more focused, after watching him beat Fitch to a pulp I think he is going to knock Penn out,|`|Z9HOEvdqaa	Both Rashad Evans and I would like to see GSP knock out BJ. I would prefer to see GSP toy with BJ for some time and then knock him out in the final round. Honestly, I think GSP is way too good for Bj right now so the fight is not going to last that long. Have faith true fan!
LIKkt8djaa	The best boots are the ones that fit your feet the best I highly suggest not buying boots online without atleast first having tried them on. Theirs a good chance the boot may not fit your feet properly and have bad pressure points. Something I suggest doing is trying on a bunch of different brands with your boarding socks on, make sure you walk around and even do some hops in them. You want to make sure they fit very snug, your toes should just be touching the end of the boot but shouldn't be crunched.     Also another thing most new people don't know is that when picking a snowboarding boot size you typically downsize one full size from your normal shoe size. You do this because one as I listed above the boot needs to fit snug and also with time and use the boot will actually pack out, so if you buy a new boot that is already loose it will only become looser with time and use, negating control over the board.    As for suggesting a board for you without knowing you're riding style that's impossible, I'll just suggest some good brands for you to look at and some of the quality boards they make.    For good brands I'd look at.    GNU  libtech  Omatic  Stepchild  Capita  Neversummer  K2  Forum  Rome    Avoid pretty much all the brands sold at those big retail stores "D&icks,sports check,sports authority,big 5 ect ect". Pretty much all the brands sold there "Lamar,LTD,Sims,morrow" are low end garbage decks that any boarder planning to go a lot shouldn't bother buying, They'll only end up holding you back.       FREESTYLE/ALL AROUND ORIENTED RIDES    Never Summer SL-R  Libtech Skate Banana  GNU Street  Burton Hero  Capita Horrorscope  Omatic Awesome  K2 Darkstar  Rome Artifact 1985    Some bindings to checkout    Rome 390's  Rome Arsenals "Not THE ARSENALS"  Union Force  K2 Formulas  Bentmetal Biscuits  Flow Team  Flow NXT        For clothing I would look at these brands    686  grenade  burton  sessions  special blend  foursquare      Another tip is to try and stay above 10k on waterproofing and breathability for optimal comfort in warmth and not getting wet. I don't ride below 15k on either and stay very warm on the coldest of days with only one pair of thermals on underneath.    For helmets I would checkout the Burton R.E.D Hifi, I use it because it's lightweight comfy and if you like listening to music when boarding "i do" than you can buy audie earpads that attach to the helmet.

These cleats and light and comfortable,but because their so light when you get stepped on ouchhh!    http://www.soccer.com/IWCatProductPage.p...  These cleats are comfortable and light.It just takes time to get used to them.Their one of a kind.    http://www.soccer.com/IWCatProductPage.p...  These are comfortable and it doesn't really help you kick.But buy them at a perfect size or after a a while ill rip!    http://www.soccer.com/IWCatProductPage.p...  These are my personal weapon of choice.Right from the start once you try them on they feel really good.Just imagine once they are broken in.You have to play a lot with them to make them really soft.They provide good protection.It has nothing special(technology), but its very comfortable.

ypB3QDWNaa	This is the best and strongest epoxy in the world.  I'm not sure what you mean by 'buy(ing) at any store'?  To find this stuff, you will need to find a marine supply store or a well-stocked harware store.  Home Depot or Lowe's might even carry it.  Click link:
3GViYtjtaa	You should stay within the bounds of the rating of your rod first off!    Normal leads will be from 1oz to 4oz off of piers unless you are fishing a heavy out going tide.    The size f circle hooks used will be determined by what you are fishing for so a normal assortment of 1/0 to 5/0 would be good for most fish you will fisnd off of piers.If you think you may get into a few larger speicies ie: grouper,kings,cobia you may want to add in some 6/0 to 9/0.    With your double dropper rig you can alternate the lengths of each loops and tie your own with flurocarbon leader to your main line using a uni to uni knot and limit swivel use!|`|VDpmh2VJaa	Depends on what your fishing for and how strong your mono or braid is ....also water depth, water current,etc.. For example, For pompano you can use smaller diameter mono/ braid you can use 2-4or 6 size depending on what your rod size ..You have to keep pyramid sinker buried so it keeps your line tight so when pompano hits your sand flea or crab it hooks itself....Circle hooks tend to run larger in size than ordinary size hooks...Remember you hook gap, sharpness and strength of hook.  Big amberjack, grouper,snapper can straighten small shank hooks..|`|q8dX0MsNaa	you can probably purchase bank sinkers for less than pyramids. l use pyramids mostly for surf fishing. they don't roll in the surf. use just enough weight to hold bottom. that will depend on the currents.  match your hooks to the size of the bait you will be using.|`|PGlZn1wEaa	3-5 dependng on the tide that day.  1-3 hooks depending on your bait size and fish.    Easy enough?  Later|`|xU9e7uGTaa	Spring is right depends on several factors Rod Line and Tide.  I have used every thing from 1/2 oz praymid to 9 oz pryimids.  Depending on how the Tide is runnig Outgoing is easier to hold bottom than incoming  Line weight my bass rod which i use for Croaker and Spot is spoiled with 8lb mono I have gone no larger than 1oz My surf rods I have used up to 9 oz sinkers depending|`|AA10184408	Steve, you will need  to have a selection of sinker weights and determine which one to use based on the tide and current at the time you are fishing. As  the day goes along you may want to go lighter or heavier depending on the conditions. The wind will factor in as well. Have 1/2 to 5 or 6 oz.weights handy and you will be covered. And like I said before, ask questions, the other fisherman are usually good about sharing information and if you dont get the answers that you seek, ask someone else. Good Luck bro!|`|c81fa0395c7807a69ecfa0cdd3674cb1aa	where i fish everyone uses 8oz of lead|`|LBW2N6Skaa	It depends on the depth and current and tide  .. If your fishing for flounder for example they are a bottom fish so they will stay only on the bottom they wont come up so you would need any were from 2-6 ounces. Say it was high tide deep and choppy you would may even need more but that usually doesn't happen. Oh i almost forgot that you don't want to much weight that it looks and feels that you hooked a fish especially with a smaller rod.

Y'see, during the "stirring moment", between a good knockdown and when they rise to reveal blood, they cut themselves with a hidden razor.    As far as wrestling being fake, well, it is. But between the strenuous training, the toll on the body, and the overall chance of getting seriously injured, it's pretty dangerous.

ILVCgXcYaa	Gurkhas are best known for their history of bravery and strength in the British Army's Brigade of Gurkhas and the Indian Army's Gorkha regiments. The Gurkhas were designated by British officials as a "Martial Race". "Martial Race" was a designation created by officials of British India to describe "races" (peoples) that were thought to be naturally warlike and aggressive in battle, and to possess qualities like courage, loyalty, self sufficiency, physical strength, resilience, orderliness, the ability to work hard for long periods of time, fighting tenacity and military strategy. The British recruited heavily from these Martial Races for service in the colonial army.

Hopefully they wont give Orton the win.  I don't expect Edge to have a 14 and 0 legacy or anything, but I'd just like to see him fall to someone more worthy than Orton.

a149d3952e957b71de363613a42dbb37aa	Mira, te lo voy a explicar claramente para que entiendas.  Rafa Marquez no cambio de nacionalidad, simplemente adquirio la doble nacionalidad espanola/mexicana. Rafa va a seguir jugando en la seleccion mexicana e incluso ha declarado que se encuentra deseoso de trabajar con hugo sanchez. Ahora, esto lo hizo por que los equipos espanoles solo tienen lugar para tres extranjeros en el equipo principal. Antes de que se nacionalizara, los extranjeros eran Ronaldinho, Samuel Eto' y Rafa Marquez. Ahora que se nacionalizo, deja el lugar libre para que juegue otro extranjero y ademas rafa recomendo que el jugador extranjero que entrara en su lugar fuera Giovanni Dos Santos, otro mexicano. Por lo que esto, lejos de ser una perdida para el futbol mexicano, no es mas que darle la oprtunidad que se merece a otro talentoso mexicano.  saludos|`|61560a4a5a0bda07e5e37976b28d915aaa	Asi mi estimado se hacen los chismes...

De esta manera ahora Giovanni dos Santos podria jugar con el barca en la primera porque ya esta vacante la plaza para otro extranjero, que de hecho asi va a ser.     Ahora, siempre va a jugar con la seleccion mexicana, independientemente de no ha dejado de ser mexicano, porque la FIFA no permite que un jugador represente a dos diferentes selecciones. Si ya jugaste con Mexico siempre vas a jugar con Mexico. A menos que Michoacan se separa de mexico y se haga un pais podria jugar con la seleccion de michoacan, pero mientras esto no pase siempre jugara con la seleccion durante su carrera profesional.|`|02833dc4d5259dadf04a2044efe4c6b4aa	La verdad no me interesa ,vamos me da lo mismo.|`|47eff689065353acd4654018a12b9dafaa	El sigue siendo mexicano, en espa?a le dicen el "Kaiser de Michoacn", que mas prueba quieres, el asunto de la doble nacionalidad fue solo para ayudar a su equipo.

nRBC4E5saa	OK, this isn't really a question, but let me help you out here.    The current "Shaolin monks" aren't monks.  They are basically acrobats and street performers who are used by the Chinese government to promote tourism.  Think about it: how can there be such a highly-promoted Buddhist sect in a country that has outlawed Buddhism since the 1950's?    The historic Shaolin monks weren't the mystical warriors people think of either.  They were dudes.  Mostly religious dudes.  They did a lot of begging, praying, meditating, cleaning, and scrupture studying.  Some of them were part of the militia, which all major land-holders had.  The myth that the Shaolin temple was the epicenter of martial arts in China is just that: a myth.  Most martial arts practitioners learned local styles, or styles used by the army.|`|w1p1slURaa	thank you.... hope that high schooler comes back so he can offer up some of that great wisdom he learned of that youtube video...|`|AA12171405	Dharma from India taught martial arts to Shaolin monks bcoz at that time those monks were weak. Until now, Shaolin monks practise martial art to keep their bodies strong.|`|bhlbwoIeaa	They don't practice for self-defense.. well they do.. but that's not the main reason..    They believe in perfecting themselves through body, mind, and spirit. So.. martial arts helps better their body. It's also a way of meditation for them.|`|ewlVffW1aa	reason for this is that they have fought      this is a story from shao lin temple      it is also historicaly part of china        this is what causeed an almost overnight interest in the martial arts      2 dynasty armies yes armies were fighting one another to see who would get the final control of chin[china]      one of the dynasty leaders knew the shaolin monks and asked for help      overnight the shaolin monks killed the entire enemy dynasty and ended the war        t6hey have used their strength before and this ggives them almost mythical statis        let me see      anderson silva, fedor emilianako, brock lesnar, randy couture, bj penn, gsp, chuck liddel, faber, kimbo slice, evander holifield, bruce lee, rickson gracie, vitor belfort and tito ortiz all combined wih weapons take out an army|`|Km9QC8a9aa	The Internal Martial Arts are often called "meditation in motion."    These martial arts are a means to:  physical exercise,  health, preventative and corrective medicine,  Self control and  meditation.|`|hQWucH5uaa	First of all the Shaolin monks do use their martial skill in self-defense only.    Second of all, the Shaolin monks use the martial arts to teach self-reliance.    Third of all, since the Shaolin monks had travelled in remote areas of China transporting valuable religious items they had to protect themselves from bandits, which means both self-defense and self-reliance.    Shaolin monks are 'priests' first and warriors last; they are not soldiers though they had provided service to the Emporer on occasions.    Being only human, not all the Shaolin monks over the past 500 years adhered strictly to the tenets of Budhism so some did become renegades or disillusioned with religion broke off after a life time of teaching.  The same happened with the Japanese samurai some of who became bandits or Yakuza (mafia).    The same holds true for the 'Wudang' Taoists priests who also practiced martial arts for the same reasons as the Buddhists Shaolin sect.|`|Qpx6gCwFaa	So you're saying they don't learn martial arts?     That's not the case. They do learn martial arts, but only for self defense (which is what martial arts is for anyway), and they also believe there's a profound spiritual side to it (this is the main reason actually). We know as a fact that they do practice martial arts. That much we know for sure. We just don't know all the details. The government has a lot of influence over what happens at Shaolin, so a lot of the skilled monks have left or been expelled.    You're right. They don't fight unless it's self-defense. I do think they spar though. They do practice Sanda (look up Fight Quest). That's not the same as fighting, though.|`|g7xaB57Xaa	I would only wonder if a true (of course they practice Martial Arts to some degree.) Shoalin Kung Fu (SKF) practicing expert could find a circumstance to do MMA fights.  But the only two I can think of to prove the effectiveness of semi-ancient SKF today (other than word-o-mouth by an MMA expert who travels to a temple and makes challanges) is A. Some young expert does exhibition full-contact matches just to prove the mystic effectiveness in modern times of SKF or B. It becomes a matter of doing the matches to make enough extra money for a temple/community that really needs it to survive.  But not only am I starting to sound like I'm naming plots for movies, but I don't think this semi-ancient/ancient SKF's modern effectiveness question will ever be solved with having yourself trained in MMA and then going to a true practicioneer and forcing out a challange.  Same thing I'd like to know with all the other ancient/mystic Kung Fu and Asian MA types.|`|1oMjCTGVaa	you don't know much about their "religion"    most buddhists are into self preservation.    if they were not going to defend themselves, why would they wear clothes to protect their body against the cold?    self preservation is why they train self defense, to help attackers realize that they should not be trying to hurt someone without a real reason.    and as for their ability to fight, I dont know anything about the actual shaolin monks, ive never been there.    i train a southern style known as hung ga, which originated in the shaolin temple... one gong fu training method is sparring, which at my school is done 2 times a month (as many times as you please on saturdays as saturday is a free workout day.. and as much else as you want during the week but in the week if you are training properly you will not have any energy left after a class)    so sparring in my experience is to make some blocking first nature, and to learn reflexes.. not to learn how to fight necessarily

njtFoQd4aa	I did a martial arts that had the belt color system thingy. I started it when i was young so I didn't know much about martial art, or that there were so many different styles.. Too me it seems nowadays those dojo's only care about the students staying with them, then them actual being good at and it so normally no one ever failed a belt exam. (Unless they REALLY fail at everything lol)  Thus the reason I left. I just didn't feel like i had achieved anything when passing the belt exams. Though it did keep me fit, and its good for people new to martial arts or aren't as seriously committed to it.... =\|`|NJMzhcKhaa	There are lots of McDojo out there and actually a lot of them are JKD dojos too.  Judging from your comment, it seems like you are in one too.    JKD is not an Art, JKD is a philosophy. McDojos across the country pick up JKD and teach it as a martial art to jump with the Bruce Lee bandwagon, which I never understand since to me, Bruce Lee is a movie actor first and martial art second.    the 'belt color thing' is a symbol of achievement, one that is admittedly tainted by the numerous McDojo that even give brown belt or black belt to 12 yrs old.  Belt started with white and as the person train everyday, his sweat changed the color of the belt into yellow. The more he train the more the belt got stained and the color got the hue, then he push himself harder and his blood run to the belt and give it the red color and when the person good enough in his art that he stop bleeding in fights, the blood dry and give you the brown.  Black belt does not attest to the skill as brown does, black belt is awarded to student to show his maturity in the art and the achievement of both physical and spiritual side of the art.    That's what belt meant in my kyokushin dojo back then when I was younger (although I'm pretty sure there are variation of the belt meaning eventhough it usually goes on the same line)  Don't go about mouthing things that you do not understand when you do not even understand the thing that you study yourself.|`|3DnX9NmAaa	The belt color system isn't lame, but some people do make too much of a big deal about it. Just because you met an ignorant person who thinks belt color is important and doesn't know about Jeet Kune Do doesn't mean that all martial arts with them are lame. Never put down another martial art, yours in no better than theirs and vise versa. There is no best martial art.|`|Qpx6gCwFaa	Don't hate something just because it's different.|`|uToFh7Beaa	No, I don't think it's lame. Belt coloring is a way to mark a student's progress. Before the coloring system, students only had white belts. As they trained and progressed, their belt would become dirtier and dirtier until it almost appeared black. They didn't train inside a dojo, they trained outside. Hence, the coloring system to mark the progression between the white belt and the black belt.    As for the student you spoke with, he was an orange belt. That indicates that more than likely, he is new to martial arts as a whole and since JKD is a relatively rare style in that there's not much exposure to it, I can see how he may not have heard of it.    I study Okinawan karate, but had a room mate who studied JKD and we trained together from time to time. So, no, I don't believe the coloring system is lame. You merely have to understand the history behind it.|`|Pa3LKeBtaa	JKD owns dude. If he thinks its bad, spar with him and see what he says.    Though the belt system isn't bad. It's just a way for people to distinguish skill levels.|`|kYdxJGt6aa	First of all for karate to be recognized in Japan it had to adopt to a system of ranking much as kendo and judo had, therefore they went with a belt ranking system. Over the years school found that they could make money off of belt testing and before long they had up to ten kyu belt ranks.  Some traditional schools stayed with two to four belts.  Second if I have a student enroll in my class and all they're interested is is when do they get their next belt, I suggest to them that they need to find another school. They earn belts in my class. I don't give them away nor do I sell them.|`|hQWucH5uaa	When I began Kodokan Judo, Goju ryu karate and Hakko ryu jiu-jitsu in 1968 you were a white belt until brown - then black.  That is the Japanese method of which I still adhere to this very day.  You earned your rank.    But as time went on all the American students began to piss & moan about having something to show for all their work.  So the Shihan put a dot at the end of the obi with a black magic marker.  This mollified some of the whining, but students began to leave and get disillusioned.  So the USJA (United States Judo Association) began their multi-colored belt system which seems to have satisfied a lot of American students.    Today up north Jimmy Pedro's Judo Club initiated half-colored obi's for his Judo students further increasing the color spectrum of rank.  All to appease the club due's paying student.|`|YDpT2ClBaa	jkd is not martial arts, its a philosophy,  the belt systems serves serves purposes,  one is it is a goal orientated system for people to strive for.  there are several other reasons as well|`|bqqGZfiSaa	the idea of belts and ranks isn't necessarily bad- just people don't seem to understand that a belt is worthless if you don't have the skills to back it up and then all the little mcdojos in the world realized they could make lots a money selling belts so they do. and don't knock something till you try it
bhlbwoIeaa	I don't know.. i used to think when I was a pure kickboxer that my jab and my right hook could take on the world. And then I got pwned by a wrestler.     Now I feel like My brazilian Jiu-jitsu can do just about anything.. but I know i can always resort to my wily days of kickboxing to back that up. Oh and also the fun Muay thai that I've added over the years.    I guess it's just natural to assume you're stronger.. especially when your instructors keep telling you that if you learn their style you will be unstoppable( which happens alot).    (to: RossBoss)    I don't mean that i'm like this anymore.. I'm just trying to explain the progression of a fighter..     And my instructor doesn't tell me this, but I've encountered many who will say "Yeah If you learn this you'll be able to beat anyone *cough* sucker *cough* GIMME MONEY!"    Anyway I wasn't implying that I can beat everyone, but I used to think that way. It's like as soon as you get beaten by a style, and learn another style.. you realize exactly how incomplete you are, and from that point on you always strive to be better.|`|hlqj0pvxaa	Here is where the "problems" really come from...    Someone Implanted in to the western mind, that "all martial arts have at least one glaring hole".     This is a myth... a myth of the western mindset.     The reason people believe this is because there were very few people who received the correct training in their arts. They were not taught how to discover these things in their art. So to not look bad, they created this myth.     I for one have trained in different arts. You do not need to mix any arts to be better.     It's like the myth of multitasking.     If you were trained correctly, your techniques will manifest themselves without conscious thought.     If you were trained to think, you have to make up for lack of proper martial arts skills.     What do you think the term "karate" is supposed to mean... empty hand? No! It refers to the hand that comes from the void - nothingness.     This is a concept that is too difficult for the western mind to comprehend.      It is an old and very deep concept of Chinese philosophy.     Chinese martial artists on this forum can identify with this - in the beginning of a form, before you begin, you are standing - relaxed. This is referred to as "empty". When you start your form you have to become "full". It is the same concept.     Those who will give me "thumbs down" for this answer are just people with no real knowledge of martial arts and those who refuse to accept the truth - real knowledge. You can't accept that your shallow ideas of martial arts are challenged and you remain what you are - un-knowledgeable.|`|4WszPA0Paa	This is just psychology of idiots haha    Pride in their style  Ignorance from common sense  Arrogance in their ability    i completely agree with u and even if ur the best in everything.. there is a lot more to it then skill    Luck of the other fighter  A mistake u make  etc    even though some ppl r undefeated (fedor... his loss was illegal and cuz of blood)    I have yet to c the perfect fighter,NOR the perfect style and doubt i ever will.... as much as i hate to say this b/c i love Fedor  haha    edit: aikage if ur instructor is telling u that then ur in the wrong gym haha  & never assume ur stronger//better... thats how u get knocked the **** out|`|9xgGd9praa	Because when people start learning martial arts, they always seem to think they can take on the world.  I can kickbox, but there are an awful lot of people that could kick my bum, and my preferred martial art is not completely perfect.|`|1oMjCTGVaa	taking moves from different arts will often contradict what you have already learned.     example: my chinese art teaches a front kick with my body upright and a forward mindset.    a korean art may teach the same kick, but leaning the body far back when executing the kick    it is not possible to use both of these moves at the same time, so doing more than one art may be pointless    why would I want to practice an art that is not complete? that does not have methods i can figure out to handle all situations?    most "MMA" (i quote because in UFC/pride/etc the "mma" they practice has no martial technique or killing/lethal technique which is what makes a MARTIAL art, a martial art) is punching and kicking... my chinese martial art has punching and kicking, but various other hand movements (second knuckle punches made for vitals, finger strikes for vitals, claw hands for gouging/grabbing, etc)      i DO NOT think this art is better than any other art, but my art is practiced for self defense in a street scenario where the attacker does not care about my life, the "mma" that ufc fighters practiced is an art practiced for a fight with rules that is meant to be non-lethal and thus it shows in their art    so what would i practice since i live in a dangerous city? I feel an art that is not practiced by the bounds of non-lethal rules is not complete.|`|r5AMG8g7aa	I'm 110% with what Sensei Scandal said. Both he and I have been seriously involved in the martial arts long enough to have a totally different perspective of traditional martial arts than 99% of the people out there that have less martial arts training. This is not meant to put anyone down. It is just to say that we were around when the martial arts were much different than what is taught in the last 20 years. We know that it is not that there is anything wrong with the martial arts themselves. It is that no one teaches the martial arts in their entirety. Instead of teaching the whole art they must teach an abbreviated version of the art. This is due to many reasons. Two main ones are obvious to me.   1) originally martial arts were something that a student did seven days a week. Now people do it part time. Instructors simply don;t get enough time to even teach 10% of the art to the students.      btw- My answer is not to put anyone down. It is not to win your approval or disapproval. It is simply the most honest answer that I can give to explain what has become a big issue within the martial arts community.   2) generations of instructors were not taught the whole art themselves, so they can't possible teach it all. Even if their student trained seven days a week the instructor can't teach what he does not know.      NOTE: I've spent my life mostly as a full time martial artists and instructor. I meet people all the time with many years of training. What is sad is how obvious it is that they have not been taught but a small part of their style. most don't even know it.  But as I said having trained back in the 1960's when things were different allows me to see things newer martial artists did not experience.    So to answer you question anyone that says that a single martial arts has holes in it simply has not seen or learned all that the arts has to offer.  It is not their fault since there are extremely few people that have learned all of their martial art.   So lets stop all this nonsense about a single martial arts having holes in it. for those of us that are doing a complete martial art the question only shows us just how little most people really know or understand about the real arts.|`|dc6f042f0a1f241b0647713f95aefc3aaa	Honestly I don't think I will waste time on this question again since you can not help anyone who is not open minded.    But Sensei Scandal and Shihan J are on the nose with their answers.

dpSr0icwaa	yes, absolutely.    However, the BB gun must hit a handful of vulnerable spots.    A lot of BB guns have the power to pop an eyeball and continue through into the brain, killing the person.  Even those with not quite enough power to kill can still blind people.    Besides the eye, the temple is a vunlerable spot and the BB gun can kill there, or it can enter an open mouth and kill.  (Happened to a kid being attacked by his brother. Kid was lying on the ground yelling for brother to stop, brother kept on shooting thinking it would just cause pain.  BB entered the open mouth, went througth the back of the throat and killed the kid)|`|t3y5PxKGaa	NO|`|X2ZsYRNWaa	People are killed by pellet guns every so often.  They get shot in the eye, ear or temple from close range.  Sometimes the brain is damaged but most of the time the wound gets infected and they die from that.  The other possible ways are having a pellet enter the bloodstream and cause a stroke or heart attack.  Dick Cheney's hunting buddy had that happen and someone killed an elephant with a .22 like that.|`|Z8UV6S3baa	People are actually pretty fragile in alot of ways. Further, "BB gun", depending on whether you are someone who knows something about air powered weapons or not really is a pretty term.    If your question is - can someone be killed by a Daisy Red Ryder BB gun? The answer is yes, but it is highly unlikely. However, you can indeed shoot your eye out with them if you are careless in your handling.    If your question is - are their air driven weapons that can kill someone? Absolutely. I can probably think of at least half a dozen models without spending too much effort. There are air rifles which people can hunt big game with.    Thinkingblade|`|nooi0ldjaa	Jesus christ...    yes, if someone is stupid enough to shoot them self with a strong bb gun, it COULD kill someone...not likely but it can happen.    just like a man can drowned in one teaspoon of water, not likely but it can happen.    ok, now you give us details on your gun, are you looking to kill someone? because posting that on the internet is NOT a good idea.|`|DV4xyeChaa	didn't your mother tell you someone could get their eye put out...mine did...people have been killed but depends on what gun... a daisy red rider doesn't hit hard.[i hit dogs pooping in my yard...but ive seen pump and co2 powered the i think would break skin|`|o9nSygbEaa	Yep, sure can. When I was in school (I believe it was Jr high but maybe high school) a kid a year older than me was killed with a BB gun. It wasn't anything fancy; just a regular BB gun that kids shoot tin cans and targets with. His friend happened to shoot him and happened to hit exactly the right spot on his temple and killed him.|`|AA11729094	Yes you can kill someone with a BB gun, if you BEAT THEM TO DEATH with it......|`|LqSciCrhaa	It would be nearly impossible to die from a BB gun shot.  BB guns generally can't penetrate the skin and will likely leave a mark on the skin.    If you shot someone in the eye it could go into the brain and cause damage.      I suppose if you stuck the gun right up to someones chest above where their heart is and pulled the trigger it MIGHT kill them but it is highly unlikely.|`|OBh7uEd1aa	bb gun are killers number of people shot .knifed,beat to death   for having one.. just joking around, or playing bad guy and displaying to wrong person,, get you killed,shootin  pellets ,,bbs  water or caps .
O8lLBrXpaa	that depends.  are you playing in a recreational or travel league?  if it is a recreational league, then it's most likely not as competitive, which could mean a potentially nicer atmosphere.  not that teams in travel leagues aren't nice! ;) the atmosphere on a competitive team is sometimes more tense and people could get frustrated if you're not playing at the speed they are. If you are, you're golden.  i doubt that would be a big issue though, because usually soccer is a pretty easy sport to pick up if you have a good coach and you put the effort in.  If you do play, regardless of the team, you'll probably make some new friends, especially since you wouldn't have a preexisting friend to cling to. Just be nice and open to advice, especially if you're not as advanced as them. If you're new to the sport and you join the team with an air that you don't need anyone's help, that would probably tick some people off.  Personally, I think soccer is VERY fun (i guess i'm a bit biased though...) and say go for it! What have you got to lose? (:|`|vs7ALZHmaa	If you really love soccer you shouldn't care about other people.They only thing you should have on your mind is to chase your dreams.Do what the heart tells you!|`|5X0p45Zbaa	Dude dont tell somebody to decide for you its your future u can play it or not its u not us|`|RAjycr4waa	Play the game and stop being shy. theres nothing to be shy about. and if you are trying your best no one will care.|`|T7Ms0TC4aa	I think that it doesn't matter if you're shy or not because for me, anyways, I play soccer to play soccer, not to make new friends. To me there are tons of places outside of sports where you can make friends, and when you play soccer you want to focus on playing the game, not working out relationships with the other players. Even if the players don't accept you because you're shy (which they shouldn't do) it's not a big deal because you'll only see them maybe two or three times a week for about one and a half hours each day. Also you should look at the good exercise part. Even if you don't like soccer that much, which you shouldn't, the one season you play will get you in great shape if you maybe want to try some other sport. Finally you should look at the fact of it will be a good social experience, because of this you will learn social skills so that in sports, as well as other areas of life, you will make more friends.
otKIUViRaa	Yes as long as it is not too old to learn, you will have to train and help it learn. Usually a black mouth means a good breed.  My uncle trained coon dogs and he preferred hounds, it helps if you have a pet coon as he did. He had a platform he would put in a creek and chain coon to it and let dogs swim out to coon, it was funny and amazing to watch coon get on dogs head ,He would try to drown dogs, but my uncle was always there to get him off dogs head. It did not take long for dogs to learn to gang up on coon and circle him to get advantage.  He would put coon in tree about 10 ft up and you almost thought those dogs would climb tree.  A squirrel dog is easy to train especially if you have in yard, most dogs are born with the hunting instinct but they still have to have training of some sort. I would prefer a small cur for squirrels and a larger hound for coons.

NR5LhOpPaa	Yeah, they are pretty much the same.  Only real difference on the specs is the swingweight: The Two is actually barely headlight, making the swingweight a fair amount less that that of the regular nTour, which is even balanced.    They really are meant to be the same, though.  The nTour Two was meant to replace the nTour when wilson changed up their nCode line.  Though they pretty much only updated the paint jobs.    The only reason the Two is more expensive is because it is slightly newer.  I'd say that you should just save the extra money and get the regular nTour, unless you don't care how much you spend and like the Two's paint job better.|`|kfPfhScEaa	Those rackets are not new,they're old,About 3-4 years old.And there is no major differences between the two they're about the same the only differences between is the planting.

AA10288947	We used to use an axe. The problem is is cuts and cracks more ice than you need. State fishing regulation limit the width of the hole you make. I think 12 inches is the maximum in the lower USA states. With an axe, you get lots of ice flying into your eyes and it is painful. An ice chistle would also work. But, it's not easy if the ice is more than 6 inches. It it's like a foot or more, you'll chop so long that by the time you reach water it either 1) Will be spring, 2) You'll have scared all the fish away for many hours, or 3 You might  need to go to the eye doctor from all the ice that flies into your eye. Ouch. A Crow bar actually works too. The bottom must be sharp though.|`|2bqmotqlaa	they sell chisels to cut through ice but as said before go with a chain saw  dont use a saws all  you will do damage to the blade and never go through enough ice|`|RxTIzsyhaa	As already mentioned a' chain saw may do the job and or a' hand chisel with a rope attached to it (video link) ;)...     http://www.expertvillage.com/video/12320...

FyAGwtA1aa	Well size shouldn't matter too too much because you can either gain or lose depending on which position you really want to play.    If you want to score and you want to finish plays and you want to be the aggressive attacker on the offense, then you want to be an attackman.    If you want to continue run up and down the field playing your heart out on both offense and defense, if you wanna stay in control of the game on whether you win or lose, or if you wanna make both big hits AND big scores, then stay middie.    Sometimes a change of pace is good, sometimes you'd be better off with what you are doing. The question is whether or not you want to play anymore defense?

f3c8c8668b9cda889ca66130af32d416aa	That's a very decent 40 speed, I'd suggest Running Back if you're looking to play offense.  You're going to be one of the smaller young men on the field, but that can work in your advantage, too.  Tuck in behind a lead blocker to get through the line then turn on the jets and you're making yards.  But if you're like me and favor defense, your size and speed are aligned with Corner or Safety.  While the linebackers go in on blitz, having someone quick to cover a quick pass is a huge benefit.  Good luck with your game, Friday nights are a blast!|`|9074478db0544852db1911805014119aaa	tailback would be best.. keep getting bigger and faster and you will have no problem... good luck|`|AA11537485	depends what level you are referring to.  if you are targeting high school varsity, it's not looking to good.  if this is for middle school or even freshman football, i'd recommend half back.

AA10759365	Sport must include two things. First is physical skill, second is physical competition. This is a very basic formula but interestingly it outlaws certain athletic endeavors as sport. Bodybuilding for instance requires athletic effort and physical competition but no discernible level of physical skill upon which contestants are scored. This definition is what the International Olympic Committee uses, so don't kill the messenger.|`|AA11639799	I think there are two criteria for something to be a sport.  It should be physically active (poker is not a sport) and it should be a competition, with the winner defeating the loser based on some objective criteria (versus a popularity contest or someone's determination of 'artistic impression').    This does not mean that sports do not have rules and defined penalties for breaking the rules.  However, there are defined methods of scoring (making it around the bases, crossing the goal line, hitting the ball into the hole, recording the fastest time, etc).  To me, this means that most of the traditional sports (baseball, football, running, golf, tennis, bicycle racing, swimming, etc) are sports.  There are also new sports (lumberjack competitions, strongman competitions) that meet this creiteria and rightfully take their place in the list of sports.    Then there are a group of other activities which meet the first criteria (physically demanding) but are more artistic expressions than true competitions.  These are activities such as gymnastics, rythmic gymnastics, platform diving, figure skating, ballroom dancing, and, even sillier, cheerleading.  The 'winner' of these events is the one who scores the highest in the mind of the judge based on how much the judge 'likes' the 'artistic impression' of the routine.  If contestant 'A' does the most challenging routine and has mistakes, and contestant 'B' does a less challenging routine perfectly, it is up to the judge which one is 'better' based on their own personal bias.  This is different than a referee or umpire, who is there simply to decide if the rules are being followed rather than directly deciding the winner.    Cheerleading is even sillier because part of the 'judging' is based on the involvement of the crowd.  So if the crowd seems to react better to one squad, that squad will score higher (giving it a simple element of a popularity contest).  Also on the 'silly' scale is freestyle skydiving, where the team has a position of 'cameraman'.    If you ever watch the olympics with a group, you can almost always get a reaction by saying 'that's not a sport' while watching figure skating, diving or gymnastics.  Almost invariably, someone will say 'I'd like to see you do that'.  But that's not the point.  There are many physically demanding things I can't do well.  I am not necessarily great at withstanding g-forces, but being an astronaut is not a sport.  Neither is animal training, juggling, or most of the things that you will see at your local circus.|`|1e10485444f1a6d11a4a824d5af9e3cdaa	if u don't have to work hard, and get sweaty, or real injured, it just isn't the same. when u can cheer someone on, like in football or basketball, it's a sport. golf,u just swing somethin at a ball, there's no interaction with other players, etc

AA10137828	Here is a rule book definition;    An infield fly is a fair fly (not including a line drive or attempted bunt) which can be caught by an infielder with ordinary effort, (rule does not preclude outfielders from being allowed to attempt to make the catch) and provided the hit is made before two are out and at a time when first and second bases or all bases are occupied.    When it seems apparent that a batted ball will be an infield fly, the umpire immediately announces it for the benefit of the runners. If the ball is near a baseline, the umpire Shall declare, "Infield fly if fair."      It should be noted however that in the case an IF happens (whether announced, or not) base runners are under no obligation to run. The batter is out which removes the force out at all bases. If the ball is caught, runners must tag up or stay put. If the ball is not caught, the runners may advance, or stay put.    The only difference between an IF and any other fly ball is the batter is automatically out.|`|5EuOTAjJaa	Probably the "only" rule in baseball that looks like it is written in clear and concise English, but it is almost incomprehensible. This is also probably the one rule that the Rules Committee has revisited and revised and/or amended more times than any other. I could quote it as printed in the rule book and you probably would still need some one to tell you what it means. br549 is the best answer here.|`|3yvuMkzTaa	The easiest, way to explain it, when there is a force at third, less than 2 outs, the batter hits a pop-up to the infield, batter is automatically out, runners may advance at there own risk after ball is caught, or hits the ground. It's to prevent infielders from dropping the ball & turning a double play.|`|369d24460cee0d5d9f3f17939e366470aa	its so that u cant drop the ball on purpose and get two outs... say if the bases are loaded or if there are guys on first and second.... you could drop the ball and turn two because the runners have to stay on their bases|`|Yeiop9ejaa	i dont type so well this page explained it well     http://www.qcbaseball.com/baseball_rules...        why is everyone getiin thumbs down??|`|MXdvbZAgaa	basically to sum up everyone elses answers, it is when there are runners on first and second or the bases loaded and less than two outs. the ball must be up apop up which would ordanarily be easily fielded by an infielder, including the pitcher. the rule prevents teh fielders from letting the ball drop and making an easy double play on force outs. if the ball would normally be fielded by an outfielder the ruling can not be made. note, the ball must be a fair ball fo rthe infield fly rule to be applied. also the runners cannot attempt to advance until the ball has made contact with either the infielder or the ground. however if the ball lands in fair territory in the infield and goes foul before a player touches it or it passes first or third base in fair territory, the ball is still considered fair and runners can advance|`|9a1c1c3e11c94fc756292dcf4084bee5aa	its so you couldnt just let the ball drop and get a double play. would be kinda a stupid way to end a inning bc the guy didnt catch the ball in te infield and stiff got a double play to get you out lol|`|aabkRFNbaa	any fair fly ball which can be handled by an infielder with ORDINARY EFFORT, with 1st and 2nd occupied or bases loaded, which is neither a line drive nor attempted bunt|`|omEPZWa2aa	To add to that, I believe there has to be less than 2 outs. So what the other guy said wouldn't happen. You couldn't end an inning with it. It's a pop-up on the infield with runners on at least first (anytime there's a force play) and less than two outs. It's not as hard as people make it out to be.|`|mS77sEUMaa	The infield fly rule in baseball is where there is less than 2 out and there's runners on 1 and 2. the rule was implied considering you could purposely drop the ball and turn the double play.|`|syERClh5aa	bases HAVE to be loaded  and a pop up is hit to the infeilders  batter is automatically out   and runners can not proceed

The buildup is great, and am really looking forward to the match. Finlay's acting was great, and he made me really hate JBL for a few moments when he was beating up on Hornswoggle. Thats hard to make happen with me! impressive.    the World title Streak vs. Streak should be good. Undertaker's winning streak isn't going to be broken at WrestleMania and he was promised last year the long title reign that got curtailed due to injuries.     HHH/Orton/Cena should be a good match. would like a NO DQ stip or something added though, which will prob happen as they tend to to that with Triple Threat Matches lately.    the MITB Ladder Match is bound to be good again, as always, and will prob be one of the best on the show, but its a shame Jeff has gone out. i still hope they bring Matt back as a surpize right at the start of the match.    Flair/HBK will be incredible if given enough time, if not, it will still be great    Big Show/Mayweather. i am not into the acutal match, but if kept short, say 5 minuites, maybie 8, then it should be entertaining. i am looking forward to this though.    Umaga/Batista, not too sure, but i dont think it will be as bad as Khali and Kane from last year.    From what i understand, WWE creative wants Orton to hold the title until WM, He will face HHH who was most likely win the Raw Elimination Chamber Match, and of which he did. HHH is planned to win. This will most likely set the stage for a Triple vs. John Cena program this summer.     As for the WHC, in the meantime, WWE creative plan on having Edge hold onto the title until WM, where he will face Taker in a streak vs. streak match, after Taker won the Smackdown Elimination Chamber match at No Way Out. Taker is most likely to walk out as WHC again, before he retires in the next few years, then goes to real estate.     Jericho and Cena are expected to fued at a later date, as when Jericho returned, he was supposed to face Cena, and pick up where they left of when Jericho was fired.    Ric Flair will also be facing HBK at WM, as he is a legend, and a great friend of Flair, meaning they will both have great match, and HBK wont get heat as he is respected enough to end Flair's carrer. Flair is scheduled to retire at WM 24, and has been for almost a year now, so seems likely HBK will win.     this is the plan right now, as i understand from WWE Creative, but plans can always change in WWE.    Hope this helps|`|PFm3GR4Gaa	you could watch it on this site http://www.freewebs.com/watchwrestlingwe...|`|q5MQUGk2aa	A+M, i'm 100 percent positive|`|HCar7lBwaa	Ashley and Maria win|`|AA10440464	ashley and maria|`|rjBoc7B7aa	it will be   undertacker  markhenry  Y2J  John Sena   Mitchell Mccool|`|XzABhKQraa	a+m wins|`|ZGdasYQAaa	who cares wrestlemania is big but that should be replaced with the battle rotyal and throw this crapola on wwe.com maria and ashley should win but why do you care

I think the money in the bank was my fave just cuz it was sooo intense but I will admit I was looking forward to the mayweather / big show match the most.    2.) heck ya what a ***** waste of time and money to promote the match    3.) oh my heck,, yeah I think he was hurting bad,, you could see his side start to bruise up by the end,, I am pretty sure he broke some ribs.    4.) to order it?? HELL NO money well spent!!!!    5.) Matt Hardy for sure,, no one expected it,, I don't think anyone was really surprised to see Hornswoggle.|`|ihBDG5tmaa	1. what was you favorite match - Flair VS HBK  2.do you think they made a bad desicion on orton winning - No i was very surprised thought  3. how bad to you think hbk was hurting after he hit the table - It mush of hurt  4. money well spent or a waist - Well Spent  5. o ya whos comeback was better Hornswoggle or Matt Hardy - Matt Hardy|`|Ynevc9jNaa	1.mitb  2.no everyone and their brother knew hhh was going to win  3. he is tough but of course he was hurting bad he hit the table  4. wasted  5.matt|`|FaCUVLewaa	i like the money in the bank it is always so crazy with all the jumping and ladders and tables     yes i do he is a bad champion he sits back on mondays and does nothing  i rather john cena then him he acutally did stuff   but i think HHH should of won its his time to have it    when i saw that it looked like he broke all of his ribs but a lil after that he was doing the same move and seemed fine but i think he might of hurt something    i didnt go but i bought i think i got my money worth    hardy|`|AA10440464	1 undertaker vs edge (that was the only reason we got it)   2 HE!! YES IT WAS A BAD CHOICE i heard that he broke storylines i dont know if it is true or not but that is what i heard that hhh was gonna win but randy pined cena instead  3 bad he might be out a few weeks  4 well spent   5 hmmm good one but i m gonna go with matt cause he kept the power ranger wanna be from winning|`|MLTnC4K8aa	1. what was you favorite match Edge v Taker  2.do you think they made a bad desicion on orton winning?(i do) Defninty      3. how bad to you think hbk was hurting after he hit the table? he was winded and he has an injury from it    4. money well spent or a waist? Half half    5. o ya whos comeback was better Hornswoggle or Matt Hardy? Hardy|`|reXTM1riaa	favourite match was edge v taker, two guys who i dont care too much  about, but they pulled it off, and kudos to them, nah if theyre not confident enough of h's face reaction then they would of handed him the strap, cenas off to do a movie, and orton ain't done nowt wrong, so why not? hbk gotta hurt after that, it was a sick bump, judging by the buy rates and the revenue grossed, mayweather was probably money well spent, he succeeded in getting the mainstream media attention Vince craves and the match came off pretty well, and u count hornswaggles return as a comeback, it barely registered,hardy by far (but even so,Matt hardy? not a main eventer)
DfPyyDssaa	ECW Title.  Most Likely.|`|d60a80b5cc492392701bfef472d33f7daa	Orton I think,, you would think the ECW would be easier,,, but Kane is insane and huge,, I think it would serve Orton right to lose it to him,,     but truely,, what about Matt Hardy??? HELLLL YA!!!!|`|pHZAue1Baa	He's kind of small to be messing with the likes of Triple H, Orton,  Cena.  ECW might be good but Kane is no midget.|`|Ynevc9jNaa	the only title he has a chance to win is ortons the taker or kane would kill him|`|E6RNcXxeaa	i hope not ecw i want wwe. think of the fued orton and punk could have. that would make the best summer fued since the rock and brock lesnar.|`|AA10440464	i hope he gose after randy cause he would make a better one then randy|`|jmFlx7N1aa	world heavy weight title|`|fBpZMa9yaa	i think he wants to get the ECW champion but mostly likely it will be the world title|`|B7rao8lAaa	He'll go for the world title as I doubt they'll waste the contract on the ECW title, and they won't let him touch the WWE title since that's the biggest title in the company. Imagine Orton defeats Triple H, Shawn Michaels, Jeff Hardy, John Cena, and then he loses the title to CM Punk. LMAO.    He'll either:    A - Lose the briefcase to Kennedy    B - Cash in on Edge after he screws Undertaker out of the title.|`|reXTM1riaa	if rumours are true, he'll go to the a show on Monday nghts, maybe take on Orton, but i would wait a while, build him up until he gets a halfway decent crowd reaction, he cant go to smackdown, cuz face v face matches dont work. ecw? hmm|`|5GCTI0jiaa	there is going to be a swerve its fairly obvious wwe doens't like punk much|`|ZOHyGnoPaa	Smackdown need him to stur things up as you said, but I think he won it at the worst possible time cause the champs are Kane Taker and Orton. If I was him I would wait until one of the champs are wounded and go in for the kill.

qW1L5S3Haa	It was just a glitch I think the lights above the ring went out so they aimed some Spotlights at the ring and it worked...They still had power because they had the spotlights and Titantron|`|4284e409c8e26999c7eb4ffd92352976aa	Yep that's right.The lights went out after some sort of glitch with the lighting rigs.But the spotlights rigged up nearby & the Titantron had provided enough light til the technicians got it up & running.There's bound to be a massive amount of cables & wiring needed to put on that kind of event.So there was bound to be a few hitches like the pyros failing to go off right at the end.But it was still a good ppv though.|`|IMu3wBu8aa	did you notice whenever there is a power issue it's always when the divas are out..    did you notice(i think it was jerry) ..said is the undertaker coming out...i thought that was hilarious...|`|3f34579a79400c853e74aa1bd4881024aa	bunnymania.... haahhaaa... what a name|`|b1bb1949f6bd80a6b260437ca822b177aa	yup, and a fireworks malfunction at show's end with several (non serious) injuries to 35 or so fans.  here come them lawsuits.|`|AA10440464	yeah someone said that undertaker was trying to help ashley out lol but i dont think he was|`|niLWVHJnaa	Yers thier was,|`|96amTA13aa	yeah, and that's also why they had a band play Cena's entrance theme because the titaniron was down.

6bijfmG0aa	John Cena made some comments about the Rock saying he's not giving back to the business that made him a household name.    "He is a genuinely nice guy and a fantastic human being. What I kind of get peeved about, and this is my Achilles heel, is that I've wanted to do this my whole life. Rock falls into that category. At one point he loved wrestling and wanted to do this all his life. So explain to me why he can't come back. Simply put it's because he wants to be an actor and there's nothing wrong with that. He's very good and very successful. Associating with sports entertainment doesn't do much for his acting career. I get it. Just don't f*** me around and tell me that you love this. That's the only thing that gets me really p***ed off. Our fan base have so much admiration for him, he's got to respect that. He doesn't give anything back."|`|XdYOoFb5aa	Cena sucks and he lost i bet....|`|10QWdkwVaa	When did this happen?|`|dbhjpX70aa	Cena made some comments in an interview that were "taken out of context".    Cena basically told The Rock to stop bullshitting about how much he loves the business and it is his home, etc. yet never comes back for appearances or gives back to the fans.    That's basically it. Not really a fight, or a match people.|`|AA10440464	huh they have never faced off that i know of.....unless u talking bout out side of the ring then my only guess would be b/c of rock not ever comeing back from hollywood

Yea, there are alot of stupid posts that have nothing to do with wrestling, but there are the occasional true wrestling fans on here who ask good ole' fashioned wrestling questions.  I just get annoyed how when you ask a question half of the answers people give you have nothing to do with the question.|`|AA10440464	i have no idea on what happend cause i m like u i can rember when it was to ask questions and get answers not this stuff|`|Ynevc9jNaa	because this section is full of people who will report you if you say their fave isn't your fave and god forbid if you go against the wwe mentality of the y a crowd|`|jKlye7bIaa	I personally don't like the user battles or the check this out user booked senario's but you can just ignore them. I still don't understand the point, where is the question in all these that's related to wrestling. Every time I come on here I see, USER BATTLE ROYAL SIGNUP HERE, and I just think man people are wasting their time. I could care less, and believe me we are in the majority.    Just ignore it though, answer and ask legit questions, and don't worry about the people who like to fantasy book or whatever, they have the right to do what they want, and we have the right to ignore them.

L77OlY1naa	Play pepper.... you need to work on your hand eye coordination here is a few links on how to work on it, Good luck hope I helped|`|PvIFahGjaa	To improve hitting, go to the batting cages, have someone throw you soft toss, have someone throw you batting practice, another soft toss drill is take 3 balls. Color them 3 different colors. Say red, blue, and green. Have the person throw up all three balls and then he'll yell out a color and thats the color ball you have to hit. For example. I was batting, the person thats throwing the soft toss to me throws up all three and yells blue. So then I would hit the blue ball. It makes you make up your mind quickly and improve coordination. And also you can hit off a tee. But make sure when you do all of these you do them with the correct mechanics. If you practice the wrong mechanics then it will be very hard to fix. Also keep your head completely still when you swing. You will see the ball better. Take a short, quick stride and have quick hands. Watch videos of good major league players hitting and pause it when they make contact and look how their swing is. And pause afterwards to see their follow through and pause the beginning to see how they load their hands back and stride. When you follow throw you want to have good bat extension. Hit to all fields.Be able to pull the ball, hit the ball up the middle and hit it to opposite field. When taking batting practice try to hit 15 balls to left, 15 balls to center and 15 to right. Have a line drive swing so you hit line drives instead of groundballs or pop ups. Dont swing down at the ball because you will just hit easy groundballs. Dont have a loopy swing because you'll pop the ball up and hit easy flyballs. To improve feilding have someone hit you fly balls and try to hit the cut off man and throw it to 2nd, 3rd, and home. Practice your range in the outfield. Have the person hit the ball to your left and right and over your head and shallow. For infield, have someone hit you groundballs, line drives, short hops, back hand plays, and pop ups, and charging the ball. If you're by yourself you can bounce the ball against a wall. You want to feild the ball out infront of you not between your legs. Get low and watch the ball into the glove. All in one motion, get to the ball, field it, transfer it to your other hand, and quick release. When you throw you want to step towards the base you're throwing to. Practice turning doubles plays. Play catch everyday and do some longtoss.  At try outs be confident, dont compare yourself to anyone else, and just be relaxed and dont worry about the other people there. Just worry about you. Do whatever the coach says, hustle, focus, and play the hardest you possibly can.|`|d065d40a6781127c80dc5959554a2d4faa	Practice, Practice, Practice|`|k7zH1HQvaa	practice makes everybody better but i had a tire hanging from a tree and practiced throwing through it everyday then my dad would throw the ball to me as hard as he could and would hit me grounders and we lived in country so they had bad hops alot which made me better at getting ground balls just practice as much as you can it paid for my college|`|tvy8qFKCaa	Well if you're a 52 year old freshman, you probably shouldn't be playing baseball.

Good Luck|`|O4bLFBM2aa	I think you should be more confident in yourself.

hODNT0nZaa	Welcome to buying flow bindings. I run a snowboard shop in Manhattan, NY and we stopped carrying flow bindings about 3 years ago for that reason. Flow bindings have the highest warranty issues of any snowboard company in the history of snowboarding.    Nothing you can really do, you got suckered in due to the heel entry system. They don't fix them and they don't return phone calls, but unfortunately you never read the fine print, you bindings really have no warranty. We and our customers found that out the hard way. We consulted a lawyer once and when he read over their warranty clause he informed us that basically it is filled with loop holds and backdoors. Sorry dude I would recommend cutting your losses and switch to a company like Ride. They have the best warranty dept. in the business.

LUnscegvaa	Read.. The art of stretching and kicking by James Lew.    Best wishes :)***|`|bqqGZfiSaa	wall stretches are good and so are partner stretches|`|hT1VWQywaa	Hip/Glute Stretch  Cross left  foot over right knee.  Clasp hands behind right thigh and gently pull the leg in towards you, keeping upper body relaxed.  Switch Legs    Hamstring Stretch  Lie on floor with knees bent.  Straighten one leg and slowly pull it towards you, clasping the thigh, calf or ankle.  Keep knee slightly bent. Switch legs.    Inner Thigh Stretch  Sit on floor with feet pressed together.  Keeping abs in, lean forward until you feel a gentle stretch in your inner thighs.      Lunge Stretch  In lunge position, rest back knee on the floor, with front knee at 90 degree angle, abs in.  Gently press forward until you feel a stretch in the front of the leg/hip. Switch legs.    Kneeling Hamstring Stretch  From above lunge position, slowly move backward until leg is slightly bent. Bend forward at the hip, keeping back flat until you feel gentle pull in the back of the leg. Switch legs.    Piriformis Stretch  Begin on the hands and knees and bring the left knee in, resting it on the floor between your hands (you should be on the outside of the knee).  Straighten the right leg out behind you and, if you can, bend forward and rest the forearms on the floor.    Knees to Chest  Lying on the floor, pull your knees into your chest and clasp your hands under your knees.  Gently press your hips to the floor.     Knee to Chest  From above position, straighten one leg and pull the other knee into your chest until you feel a stretch in your hip.  Switch legs.    Calf Stretch  On hands and knees, straighten your legs, but keep them slightly bent.  Gently press one or both feet towards the floor, keeping back flat and abs in.    Kneeling Calf Stretch  On hands and knees, bring the left foot in between the hands and gently press the knee forward while pressing the heel towards the floor.      Spine Twist  Lying on the floor, place right foot on the left knee.  Using your left hand, gently pull your right knee towards the floor, twisting your spine and keeping left arm straight out, hips and shoulders on the floor.  Switch sides.    Quad Stretch  Lie down on your side using elbow for balance.  Using other arm, slowly pull your foot towards your glutes, keeping both knees together and bent knee pointing down.  Switch legs.      Warm Up First   Most people believe that the best time to stretch is right before your workout. After all, thats how they did it at football practice! Heres the reality, though: the best time to stretch is after a light warm up. When the muscles are cold, injuries can occur. Besides, after a light warm up or workoutthink jumping jacks here the stretch youll be able to accomplish will be far better than when the blood hasnt really started flowing.       Breathe Properly   Proper breathing is important in any physical activity, and flexibility training is no different. While stretching its important to breathe slowly in through the nose, hold it for a moment, and then exhale (usually through the mouth) in order to get the most out of stretching. Proper breathing helps to relax the body, increase blood flow, and even serves to remove some lactic acid build up after workouts.     During most forms of stretching, practitioners should hold the stretch until they exhale, at which point they may increase or make the stretch more strenuous, if appropriate.       Stretch Consistently and Regularly   As with anything else in this world, in order to see improvements you need to be consistent. Stretching is something that you should do four to six days per week. That said, each day shouldnt encompass a rigorous flexibility routine: doing so could cause injury. Still, make sure that your rigorous flexibility routines fall on the same day(s) every week.     Also make sure that youre pretty consistent with the stretches you engage in. Generally, each stretch should last at least 20 seconds in duration.       Increase Strength and Flexibility Together   When increasing flexibility its always a good idea to increase strength in the area being discussed. For example, if youre attempting to increase the flexibility of your legs, make sure that youre also doing something to increase strength there.       Consider Mixing Stretching Within a Workout   As was noted earlier, stretching before warming up isnt a great idea. Youll get a better stretch if its done after the muscles are warm. While training in martial arts , consider stretching within your workout for the best results. Also, dont be afraid to try static stretching after a workout in order to relax.       Stretching Cautions   Always check with your doctor before attempting any flexibility or training routine.   Stretching may cause a mild sensation or burning in muscles. It should not cause outright pain in your joints or muscles. If it does, stop and see a doctor.   Always stay hydrated when working out or stretching.   Depending on the type of stretch, you may be tightening your muscles during flexibility routines.

6pUzzsuhaa	shooting with the gun 'tightly' against you shoulder helps with recoil and accuracy as some one else said..   also, when first teaching someone how to shoot, you teach them the basics, you wouldn't them shooting from the hip the 1st time would you? no   you teach someone the basics and then you add to what they've learned, with anything.. you wouldn't start, say a 11 year old, shooting a 12 ga, you start with a gun that's like a 410 and build up as they get older.     and with momentum, say with a semi-auto, the gun has to 'kick back' to eject the spent shell, and the momentum from the recoil and the gas from the shell being shot is captured and used to 'force' the action open to eject the shell       and actually pedro7of9  i know a lot of people who can shoot from the hip, and each person i know who does shoot from the hip shoots just as good as someone who shoots a gun from the shoulder.. ever saw Tom Knapp, obviously not, because then you'd know it can be done, and shooting from the hip- you do NOT get bruised up  shooting freehand and from the hip takes a good bit of practice and dedication, and after practicing a lot, someone shooting freehand and/or from the hip can shoot as good or better than someone who's shooting from the shoulder  see, it can be done:  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1nZe6_QLZ...|`|6KaMW1Vzaa	This is one of the reason "hunting" is in the "sports" section. The process of shooting needs to be as consistent as you can make it from shot to shot. That means the same snugging of the butt to the shoulder, the same cheek weld, and as much as possible consistency in hand positions, etc., though these often have to take a back seat to field expediency.  Also, having a good shoulder and cheek weld keeps it from slapping you on recoil.  If you look into the history of them, you'll see there were muskets in the past that had stocks meant for a cheek weld without a shoulder part, but that's only of historic interest.|`|AA11729094	That's where the butt goes, where else would you put it.... never mind, don't answer that.|`|nooi0ldjaa	...because thats where it goes?|`|DV4xyeChaa	you watch too much TV...shooting freehand or from the hip and you will usually hit nothing and get bruised up...guns kick...KICK..on TV they dont....on TV nothing is real...if you shoot a gun out a car window you will be  deaf for a week...ears ringing|`|c474fd81caa3e43b78b2c3cb23eb0a39aa	Sourdough,     Large recoiling guns aren't inaccurate, at least, not on the first shot.  That second shot is always alot less accurate.  By then, you know what you are getting yourself into.    As to answering the question.  I believe it is more a a bio-physics than straight momentum.  The momentum of the firing gun doesn't change on how you hold it.    If you hold a gun out, like a pistol.  The recoil is absorbed by the muscles and tendons of the arms.  If you lock your arms, I guess you could get some of your back muscles into the recoil, but I don't think that is proper firing position.    Most rifles have alot more kick than a pistol.  (rifles tend to fire bullets in the 2500-3500 FPS, while pistols are in the 800-1000 range.  There are some pistols that shoot 1600fps, but they are a handful.  Rifles tend to fire smaller bullets, but not by a lot and not always.)  Your arms and back cannot absorb all the shock and the gun flies back and hits you.  Possiblly damaging you by the force of the impact.      Putting the Rifle on your shoulder allows you to transfer  the energy to you torso, legs, and pelvis.  These muscles are much stronger than your arm muscles.  They are strong enough (usually) to control the recoil.      As to accuracy, it is easier to hold a rifle steady when you have points that are further apart.  Essentially, you are holding the rifle up at the butt and where your hands are.  Unlike a pistol, where really the two points are the front and back of the grip.  Simply pup, it is easier to point a barrel at a point with a rifle than a pistol.  If you don't put the butt against your shoulder, you close the distance of the two point from your forward hand and the butt    to the forward hand and your trigger hand.|`|vK7pKFvvaa	It is not just when you are learning , you should mount the rifle solidly into your shoulder each and every shot . It helps absorb recoil and it aids in accuracy .     With the rifle snug against your shoulder it will simply push your shoulder back instead of slapping against your shoulder . It also allows you to follow through on your shot and makes it easier to have good trigger control . Also your head must be in the same position on the stock each time so that you are seeing the sights from the same angle . With your head up straight mount the rifle into your shoulder and bring the rifle stock up to your face , not your face to the rifle .|`|OBh7uEd1aa	one is for steady hold// helps direct the slug to aim point // second it lowers the impact to a hard push /instead of the butt having a running start that impacts on your shoulder or scope ring on your eye brow,// if new to shooting add a sand bag between butt and shoulder  lessens felt recoil by cushion an absorption of energy delivered to shoulder// pair of muffs help to,,,once you adjust to gripping with hands youll loosen up some,.and absorb recoil thru hands arms,|`|dpSr0icwaa	umm, you need it there first and formost to be able to hold it as steady as possible and properly align the sights.  This is true of even a 22LR which has basically zero 'momentum and impluse' recoil.      Truthfully speaking, holding a gun loose at the hips and allowing it to swing back like a pedulum is probably the best way to handle a heavy kicking gun...if you just want to make noise.

The best thing to do here is to go to your local sports store and talk to the tennis person there.  Some places let you rent racquets out so you can try them before you buy.  Check in to that. Go with what you feel is the best racquet.    Exercise: work on moving your feet with quick steps.  Also try running and maybe lifting weights.  But when playing tennis it is important to keep your feet moving.    Try your hardest and don't be disappointed if you have trouble.  It is easy to get frustrated but give yourself time and keep practicing especially in the off-season. Play a lot this summer and just relax and have fun.  I find my game is on the most when I am relaxed.  And remember, it just takes time.    For tryouts just wear your gym shorts, a t-shirt and some comfortable shoes.  If possible get some shoes that do not have a black sole.  Some places with hard courts do not allow players to wear black soled shoes because of the black scuffs they leave all over the court.    Relax and have fun, and you will have a better time playing.  Good Luck!|`|sptrtwxlaa	okay.  I dont think it's a good idea to join the team then start playing.

Some good begginer raquets are:  Prince O3 speedport platinum  Wilson n1  Babolat DriveZ 100  Head Metallix 4    You need to start working out, some excersies would be:  sprints-suicides  endurance runs-minimum 1.5 mi nonstop  Core traning  long times oncourt  footwork drills    Atire: since you are a guy   at least dress like you've played tennis before.

Never happens to me because I have good stocky blood lines from Germany.    You should run 3-4 days a week, and on those day run as hard as you can so you dont have to run everyday.|`|QEyCJyF9aa	depends on how serious you are and how good you are:    for beginners five days a week might be plenty but you'd better be cross-training too    for serious runners that are of skill it's 6-7 days a week and cross-training on the "off" day if you take it
kD4BBKARaa	Moccasins, Body Paint (washes off with soap and warm water), beads, a long staff (like an old pool cleaner)    There are also sites that offer indian clothing or ideas    http://www.whitefeatherdesign.com/womens...|`|pf8OEAG6aa	lololol uhm like them little headband thingys with the feathers.  I'm gonna sound real dumb answering this but..  put feathers everywhere uhh try to look like this.  http://i93.photobucket.com/albums/l60/on...|`|bb4bqAYAaa	hmmm well first of all for your horse, get ahold of some feathers and weave them into her mane and tail. After that get some multicolored pain and make hand prints on her hindquarters and shoulder, you could also make other designs, sort of like "finger painting" suns, stars, swirls, etc. As for you, wear earth tones preferably that look like leather. tan to dark brown clothing can simulate buffalo or deer hide. beads and feathers are also another way to spice up your costume. Are you going to be riding her? If So to look authentic I advise you ride bareback!

OYYYNCyCaa	it part of the game when you have injuries    there is no use making excuses when a player gets injured    you have to accept that and not complain like some other smaller clubs    Liverpool, Chelsea, Arsenal etc|`|HxET88bDaa	Yeah you're right, because no matter what people say about our players... Fergie nearly always utilises them properly. He will never play a player if he doesn't have to, or he will never rush a player back.We have quality and experience in all areas of the pitch, whereas a lot of sides DO actually rely too much on a few players no matter what people say. We haven't moaned as much because we have a workhorse in Tevez and a creative player like Berbatov and anyone of them to score. Also, we have broke a cleansheet record without key defensive players! Amazing....lol|`|Gr99OjQuaa	berbatov is finding his touch and starting to click|`|Hzzdalavaa	Because they have loads of other good players.|`|sm2RK9Nxaa	Is Robson on his way back yet!! Damn his dodgy shoulder!!LOL|`|InCpu9Vfaa	the only reason you dont make excuses is because you guys are winning and Tevez is a beast who gives his all|`|XzhjWTA2aa	why would anyone complain when you can bring a player of tevez's quality off the bench.|`|B7LyNQtBaa	Yeah probably  And they don't want ogger on the pitch.|`|UmWfQ6u7aa	its because Rooney is an animal beast and his injuries heal in minutes|`|QuWgt3Aeaa	Hey Terry, Don't be hating coz you guys are a  dump of sh%t team and can't do anything to win. I know you are frustrated but you gotta suffer. Your Gunners team is never ever going to win in the next decade atleast. and guess what, if Fabregas leaves them in the summer, you guys are going to be in the relegation zone....PEACE....UNITED ARE THE BEST|`|fLpnC8qtaa	**hides face** speak for yourself..Ive been moaning..lol ! I love watching Roo play :))    Seriously, no use moaning about injuries, it doesn't make them fitter or recover any quicker. It gets frustrating but what can we do. Our depth is showing it's worth now. I don't think it's got anything to do with winning or not. We have a squad that is coping well with injuries and we know he'll be back soon enough. The supporters at the match against Everton were chanting his name nice and loud..so he'll be welcomed back with vigor !|`|9P0OxjWGaa	Hang on - a one man team - surely that would be Ronaldo then, not Rooney?    Man Utd have no way had the injuries in key areas like others - luck I guess... Arsenal lost about 5 first team players, long term too - Liverpool, er cant think of any apart from Torres - and Chelski had Terry and Lampard out... If you lost Rooney, Ronaldo, Ferdinand, Vidic and Teves all at the same time you would notice - if not results then style of play and moral.|`|5c0ea2e937929dc820b4f96293aa83a2aa	because teves is better|`|3638ecbacff09303c04d9f60a89e841baa	Perhaps because he isn't a prolific goal scorer and scores less then most strikers and some mid fielders.... make your mind up if he gets criticised for NOT scoring goals yous mancs tell us that's not what his game is about... make up your mind braggart.    edit: well that's why you don't miss him... most strikers you rely on to score and in rooneys case you don't .. you asked why most Mancs ain't moaning and that's  the reason why.    RVP oh that makes change early on this year you was saying Cesc and  a couple of seasons ago it was Henry .. at least we're a three man team then unlike you your one trick pony, aka any ref.|`|cf4d6d60fab75efc136a4d66dd5c03b4aa	coz rooney is one factor for win  we have manage win withut evra/neville/ ferdinand/rooney that is quality

I think the 2nd best passing offense in the league vs. the best pass defense in the league is a fantastic matchup.  My favorite matchup in the modern era is Colts vs. Patriots with a healthy Tom Brady. I realize that can't happen in a Superbowl, but I think it's the best matchup in the game.  I think the ultimate possible Superbowl matchup though would be the Giants (with Plax) vs. the Steelers. I love great defensive games, and I love that both of those offenses have the weapons to get a couple of big plays off against great defenses.|`|201gZ8w0aa	eagles and patriots     i want revenge and i want brady on the patriots team|`|1d627596e14caafeacfad98d799d9a7caa	Well my dream matchup has always been Oakland (my team) vs. Dallas (my dad's). But obviously 5-11Oakland wouldn't be a sensible choice. Maybe another Dallas/Pittsburgh game? I can't think of a more classic matchup.
bvnzv923aa	Well, I don't know what make/model of skate that is. You just need to find a description of those skates and what level they are made for. Try them on first and make sure they fit. They will be uncomfortable while you break them in. Just warning you now. You will not be happy at first because they will be painful.|`|MQg3mBibaa	they look fine, they are going to kill your feet.  take like a thin pair of socks, and get them wet, not a lot, but put them on your feet and then put the skates on and tie them tight. they are going to take months maybe years to break in. I have had mine since september, and mine are still breaking in|`|JiEvzbjVaa	I thin you should get skates with leather/wood soles, and make sure that they actually fit before you buy them. Skates like Riedelles, or Jacksons, might be better in quality, and without good skates, there's a greater chance of you losing interest in skating. (painful feet!)   you could even try getting used skates:)
af3a28b07826dce8ecfc28a5eaa91e13aa	3 to 6 times per week, 15  to 30 minutes per time. If you are older walk 20 to 30 minutes briskly. More time for more fitness, but any is better than none.

Indy scored 35 2nd half points to pull the upset after being down by 18 at half time to go to the Super Bowl and win it.|`|se6I1xFhaa	Either this years Cowboys team which was over hyped and everyone thought the team was going to the superbowl this year.    Or     Possibly last years Patriots team who went all the way only to be denied a perfect season by losing to the superbowl by the Giants.|`|62ca1a09937292cf311358116b02a9d1aa	giants patriots     or one of those old school matchups you know , jets vs whoever they played lol..."the guarantee"|`|AA11511741	The New York Jets and the Monday Night Miracle, where they scored 40 unanswered points in the second half against Miami to win the game.

4c21e2f4c011e6cd394d8baf6024f878aa	I agree about Chris Carter.  Last year they didn't vote him in because of Art Monk but I figured he would have gone in this year!  I just hope he won't be screwed as long as Art Monk was all those years!  But will Carter get in next year?  Jerry Rice will be eligble.    I'm glad Derrick Thomas finally got in, way past time again.  I think that is a theme for these idiot writers (being idiots).    Not sure about Shannon Sharpe.  But I do know Tight End doesn't get much respect.|`|eIOlBzm8aa	Ralph Wilson? lol I guess its because he could kick at any moment.|`|aaKYVMk2aa	Cris Carter should have.

We see enough of their corrupt faces on the nightly news.|`|ySjHowZqaa	yes they are idiots|`|1d627596e14caafeacfad98d799d9a7caa	I don't know about Sharpe. He was definitely good, too good in fact (I'm a Raider fan). But it is hard for a TE to get in, there's only 7 right now.    I agree with Carter. He was just awesome. He'll get in. But he'll have to wait for Jerry Rice and then hopefully Tim Brown. :-)|`|PSMsDalLaa	I don't think they are eligible yet.|`|acaAycEXaa	Cris Carter was a big coke-head. He should never get in!|`|VbCRId2Uaa	Yeah, I know, they haven't put Jerry Kramer in their yet either and it really sucks.
uKWcgLLoaa	I agree with 49-ers and Broncos in 1990.     I fervantly disagree with the poster who said Steelers-Seahawks though. That was a VERY CLOSE game in which the losing team outplayed the winning team and would, in fact, likely have won if the officials hadn't messed up so bad.|`|YCwmCDkUaa	I would have to say it's between 2 of them...    SB XXIX between the 49ers and the Chargers...does anyone even remember this game??

C4um90Pfaa	Ok hun its pretty good but ur like a quarter an inch off the ground buts its good that you are not leaning foward... umm u should just keep doing it and you'll be completely on the ground... again its really good...  and to make it better try doing the extended splits which is when u put your front foot on a 1-3 inch high mat and do the splits... you welcome|`|yz06jQrJaa	its good, but it could b better. try doing "over splits" or "hypersplits". that is where u put ur front let on like a pillow and still go down.|`|1MOqg0yzaa	yes... but try going down more, and leaning more on your back leg.|`|NEH7JWNMaa	Who's the hottie on the wall?|`|a6S1dyEraa	that looks pretty good to me. its more than i could do.|`|0QN7xDNeaa	Yeah, perfect!|`|1d4TrRoEaa	yeah. actually taking pics of yourself and comparing them to some you see on like gymnastic sites could help you ensure your doing it right

AA12339493	you're probably looking at old mocks or simply bad mocks. all the good mocks ive seen have moore in the 2nd round. he is now the 2nd best S behind louis delmas. as for cushing, i think his stock is more or less the same, fringe 1st rounder but sure fire 2nd rounder.     as for teh saints, we all know they can score with the best of them and have no problem on offense. it's the defense that lags and keeps them from being a great team, especially the 2ndary. sedrick ellis hasn't been as dominant as we would have expected but give it some time. I think the saints need to either go CB since no saftey is worth the 14th pick and with malcolm jenkins likely off the board by the time the saints pick (unless they trade up), i think the saints draft Vontae Davis or a LB like Lauranitis or Maualuga or the best defensive player available.|`|PSMsDalLaa	Who the hell really cares.    The Saints should get Williams Moore actually.    Cushing is overrated badly and I hope the Giants don't get him. We need Speed at LB if that's what we're getting.    I actually hope the Saints are dumb enough to resign Vilma now so that the Giants can get their first round pick.|`|eIOlBzm8aa	Moore is a 2nd round prospect now. Cushing is basically a mid to late 1st rounder or early 2nd. Delmas is a late 1st to early 2nd. Chung is an early 2nd and personally I think the best safety in the draft. They should go for Davis at CB or Cushing or Peria Jerry so they can have 2 studs at DT.

G0m2kONTaa	A big part of the Super Bowl is the pre-game festivities - Saturday plays a very big part in that.    If the game were on Saturday, then you'd have to do the pre-game events during the week, when turnout will be lower due to the workweek. And then Sunday would be wasted; who wants to party after the game is over?|`|9Wt6MjVPaa	no neveer|`|aN9osRq8aa	no because all the other games are on sunday|`|ecwhBLnxaa	Nope Sunday is the best|`|0T3qOcUFaa	Just make monday a national holiday...|`|ySFQ2TDWaa	I agree, I'm 15 years old and I go to school the day after, and since i live in Sweden I have to go up in the middle of the night to watch the game, so if the game would be played on a saturday instead that would be great! But i think theres no chance of it. And since the Super Bowl always have been played on a Sunday I think they'd keep it up|`|GcZPVMpkaa	No because people have work on Saturdays and they usually have day offs on Sundays.|`|ak5A435maa	if its not broke, dont fix it|`|rzkFHAEJaa	no. Sunday.|`|aaKYVMk2aa	For me it's on Monday 7 AM. ******* school!|`|Jf8LiEw2aa	disagree    idk why just a gut feeling.. don't mess with a good thing, ya know?|`|3b5ba5b8de4869c1b6a9d5e51ae1d8e5aa	I agree with you. In fact, the NFL is currently thinking of extending the regular season by a week or two, which would make the Super Bowl the Sunday before President's Day, meaning a day off after the game!

He just needs to stop dropping the ball at key times...|`|ZPJyVOpTaa	Probably, he had a great rookie season and he is FAST. Any fast WR has a chance to just dominate defenses. Here are some examples of fast WR in the league that have impacts: Steve Smith, Santino Holmes, Devin Hester in the return game, Randy Moss, Calvin Johnson, there are just so many fast WR in the league that have impacts week in and week out so i definitely think he will be a pro bowler someday and this is coming from a Giants fan.|`|48c83727f449473c97be31a3baff4f99aa	I hate to say it, but yes.|`|8wmjYlfaaa	yep.  he did this good on his ROOKIE year, imagine what he'll be like 4-5 years down the road.  i think he's going to be like another Randy Moss.|`|Mi3rHjcYaa	lol at all the Philly fans that think he's soooo good.    LISTEN, I watched this kid at Cal, I watched him in HS (Long Beach Poly).

KTp27Fokaa	Of course I remember him.    He played for the Arizona Cardinals in the early part of his career, and wasn't very good. He was a consistent 20INT a year thrower. Then they traded him to Denver. In Denver, they got him to run a lot of bootlegs. He was mobile and elusive. His interceptions went down from year to year, when eventually in 2005, he threw only 8. The last time he played was 06. He has a rough season, throwing more INTs than TDs, and was benched in favor of Jay Cutler, for good.|`|XZTwrn2Qaa	He was traded to Tampa Bay after Jay Cutler was going to start, but he retired when he got traded.|`|D9axbzwzaa	Goal Line Blitz is a web-based American Football MMORPG.

You can click on a ski, and the sizing chart tab should be available under "sizing info". Each model and style is different and not everyone publishes the charts online.

39d77d396b6018aac260eb632b7665f9aa	The Benjamin 392 or (.177 caliber 397) are both very nice, great value rifles....But, the RWS 34 is the best value and quality air rifle for the $$ made anywhere in the world....    I prefer the .177 caliber RWS 34 - I like the added velocity and nice flat trajectory....    Example:  RWS 34 + RWS Superdome(8.3gr) pellets   If you sight-in at 42 yards - The pellet will be 1/2in low at 8 yards - dead on at 14 - 1/2in high at 28 yards - Then 1/2in low again at 48 yards...That's a very flat trajectory!    Considering the RWS 34 is an effective small game hunter out to around 50 yards...This gives you a very flat trajectory out to those limits.....    Besides good quality .177 caliber pellets are about $3 less, on average, per tin(500)....What can I say, I like to shoot a lot and I'm frugal(cheap)    RWS 34 - .177 vs .22 = Same rifle & same powerplant = the muzzle energy is going to be very similar....The .22 because of the added mass will carry better at longer ranges....The .177 has an advantage in velocity....IMO, if most of your shooting will be at 35 yards or less, the .177 has the advantage....If most of your shooting will be beyond 35 yards, then the .22 has the advantage....    You can still hunt small game(rabbit) with the .177 out to around 50 yards. The .22 will add around 5 yards to that....You will have to practice a lot more to learn the trajectory(hold over/under) of the .22|`|EGe0k8P6aa	Both guns are good quality and accurate. However the RWS 34 is the more powerful of the two. If you can shoot a spring-piston gun accurately, get the RWS 34 since the extra energy it delivers will give you a bit more range when it comes to hunting small game.|`|Y0DFqcdzaa	The benjamin is a better quality brand gun|`|05f0ed7a9964bfcd8e3e5fe172f1cf21aa	that is not even an issue  the rws 34 is a powerful and very accurate spring piston gun that is a one cocker design.  it has no o-rings and seals associated with pneumatic pump guns .  the benji 392 will require 8-10 pumps and will be a noisy pain in the butt ( as well as tiring ) to charge  don't get me wrong, the 392 is a great little gun but it is not in the same class as the rws 34|`|4mb6xaxBaa	they are both tops in quality! i like the benjamin because you can adjust the power by the   of pumps and made in USA! plus mac1airgun.com can steroid it in the future and make it one awsome gun!
oWlQ5lH9aa	They usually go in with the team they spent the most time with.  But I think it is his choice.  I believe he'll go in as a Steeler because that is where he spent the most of his career and where he made a name for himself.  He left because the Steelers wanted him to to switch to Safety...which is what he ended up doing anyways.  But, he did leave on bad terms with the Steeler's staff...but the fans (at least this one) will always think of him as a Steeler.  He was the "Human Eraser" cuz when he was covering a WR the opposing QB might as well have erased him from the playbook...    Go STEELERS!!!!!!!|`|LiBZKwlEaa	He said on the NFL Network awhile back that if he got in he would go in as a Steeler.|`|AA11760438	Raiders.. dah.. he loves the life in California.. and keeps wearing the Silver N Black.. like he did 2yrs ago in the show..

AA12323603	Why would you ask about negative aspects.  I can't think of anything anyways.  Henry just makes a great rifle to wander the woods with.  If you are lucky enough to have one, grab a pack of ammo, and a bed roll, and hit the trail.    Won't be quite as accurate as a bolt action, but your not shooting targets.    Won't give as quick a follow up as a semi-automatic.  Still faster than a bolt action.    Range is limited dur to mandatory bullet shape, but Hornady Leverlution ammunition negates this disadvantage.    Super reliable, thin in a pack, or scabbard, with smooth sides.   Easy to find ammunition for.  Accurate.       What's not to like?

Its not respectful of some one, to not respect others interests. By you saying this will not make my interest in the game of cricket should go away.

In fact 20/20 cricket is with more action than football at least in that sense.  Some maturity is essential to enjoy any sport.

AA11615514	I've seen things that are like walking sticks sold as aids for learning to ride a unicycle. I think riding along a fence or wall is a cheaper and effective alternative. You could also enlist the help of a friend to walk beside you so you can hold onto him/her when needed. When I learned (years and years ago) I just pushed off my parents old station wagon and fell a lot, but that may not be the safest way to learn!|`|ZGTyk7kWaa	no|`|DOVbF4Piaa	You can make something like two hiking sticks to help you keep your balance.  A doorway is good for practicing balance and a walkway with hard rails is even better.|`|tBGnLPe7aa	try using something like crutches to keep you balance on it maybe that will help|`|ysrC2Q0gaa	no ther arenrt cause if u put them on the sides u can still fall forwaerd|`|KibKSdkhaa	Well...no not really...as far as I know.   But the best way to learn to unicycle is to cycle along a a wall or fence where you can grip the top an stabalize yoursel if neccesary, this is very helpful because you do want your balanced to be focused parallel to the ground...always make sure that your back and body is inline with the seat that is parralell to the ground!

(:  I had picked the giants/steelers|`|LpR9sLSlaa	I was hoping for the Steelers n the Redskins,  but expecting the Steelers against the Giants.    so I was at least half right?    thought the Cards would make may the 2 nd round of the Playoffs, but didn't see them going to the SB.    the Wiz has done a good job, changing the "mentality" of the Cards.    They expect to win now, and that's new to them.|`|ecwhBLnxaa	I picked the Giants and the Colts|`|n5xy7i2Faa	I had the Giants vs the Colts and had Indy winning the game.|`|yxaOg0QDaa	i was thinking colts giants with colts winning it all, the colts pissed me off this year, they beat the ravens, and the chargers, and the steelers, and the pats, all these teams that are supposedly so awesome and deadly, and we beat them all, a few of them at their own stadium including pittsburgh at heinz field...then the playoffs come and suddenly we dont know how to stop the run and get like 3 or 4 consecutive penalties in overtime to give the chargers great field position

It will take a monumental collapse by Man Utd for them to win the premier league.    The headline is not wrong in calling them lame, for sure.
7x4VtGtFaa	1-0 loss is enough. A draw is the best case scenario.|`|FPxXiabNaa	Chelsea will easily win 3-1 because Liverpool can't score more than 1 goal unless a Chelsea player is going to help them.    Rafa is such a crap manager and should thank god for what the players did and not the manager in Istanbul. He would be sacked at any other club for buying Lucas alone.|`|e245e32c7124764cfd9b12f11c93cdf3aa	2-1 to chelsea! Come on blues.!!! Blue is the colour!!!!

CttL3LmBaa	The only good about leaving your bike under crystalline water is that unless it melts the chance of rust is lessened.  The bad is snow is H2O crystals after all.  Water + ferrous metal (steel) = iron oxide (rust).    If it stayed below freezing the entire time you may be lucky.  Then you would only have to deal with frostbite of your (spoke) nipples.    EDIT:  Actually under a tarp is worse, as it draws moisture out of the air and causes rust faster than snow.  Bring the poor thing in your room if it's going to sit for 2 months.|`|JSGLKnA4aa	if your gonna keep bike outdoors put a tarp over it atleast. you'll probably wanna replace brk & der cables or at least relube and give a push into housings. clean & relube chain. possibly relube hub bearings depending on the seal thats on them. if you take your bike indoors to warm-up remove seat post to let moisture out of frame.|`|OCMrQVRxaa	omg the bering will b shagged get sum liniam grease if u gna do that|`|VxW3bAjzaa	No good will happen.

YweJ1PfUaa	After a season of NFL the top two teams with the most wins come together at an event called the "Superbowl" in order to see who's better and im guessing on the winning team the players get bonuses on their paychecks.|`|hMkb7H31aa	The Super Bowl is the Championship Game between the winner of the two National Football League Conferences - the American Football Conference (AFC) and the Nation Football Conference (NFC).    The winner is declared the best team in U.S. professional football.  The format to determine the two teams is similar to Major League Baseball, the National Basketball Asociation and the National Hockey League.    Tomorrow's game is the 43rd (XLIII) in the Super Bowl series which began in 1966.  Last year's Super Bowl was won by the New York Giants, who defeated the New England Patriots.    See attached link from Wikipedia for more details of what the Super Bowl is.    http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Super_bowl    Hope this helps.  Enjoy the game.|`|TS55G97faa	Is this some kind of sick joke? You must be new to America.|`|vuh0i3Axaa	are you serious?|`|0T3qOcUFaa	a very large bowl|`|ySFQ2TDWaa	Super Bowl is the big game. Its the final of the NFL. The two best teams in the NFL play the Super Bowl. The team who wins the Super Bowl is the Best team in the league. The Super bowl is the final game between the winners of all previous games in the elimination tournament(known as the NFL playoffs).|`|KNTofuxMaa	Can I really call you stupid?

ETarSy9Maa	Yes, technically he is eligable for Super 14 play, but it is likely another Nothern Hemisphere club will bring out the big bucks for him.|`|TMTgdm3saa	Yea he just has to be offered a place by a super 14 team and then pass that teams fitness requirements. It's the same in any proffesional league|`|AA11678048	*sigh* not anymore. He's spent too much time up there with those of lesser ability to be able to play the proper game anymore.|`|glm5lfY9aa	Its not too late because he is too good,and a physical player|`|wRe6CGbDaa	Los is now 33, his experience is paramount,the blues should take him back,they dont have a quality first five,Lavea & the other guy from harbour are no where near Los class..If I was Lam I would, they can get 2 seasons out of him.since Los left Auckland they have been crippled in that position.|`|7WaNwojqaa	only if its a north island team we wouldnt want the show pony down here lol|`|4UGJE4sVaa	no not if i has not been living in new zealand or involved in the air new zealand cup last year.|`|OxJ4hIJuaa	Im guessing that its too late. Even if they could, he's probably gonna get snatched by another english club who can pay more cash than the super 14 franchises.

8rasqlUgaa	Federer 14 majors....Forza Federer!|`|uWYlumvsaa	Sure Nadal said he's tired, but it doesn't mean he doesn't have something left for Federer. Don't be so quick to assume Federer will dominate this. The complete opposite could very well happen, given the history of these two playing one another. Nadal may not have gotten as much rest time as Fed, but what he lost in that semi against Verdasco, he'll be getting some of that energy back. Don't think Nadal's just gonna roll over and crumble so Federer can equal Sampras' record. It's just not that simple!!!!! Besides, all the pressure is on Roger, not Rafa, because of the history at stake.     I'm a believer in miracles, and I've seen Nadal pull off some amazing ones already in his short career. As grueling as his semifinal may have been, it's not going to stop him from his pursuit of another grand slam title. People would be foolish to underestimate the possibility that Nadal could walk away as the champion.|`|AA12034105	Yep I'm totally ready to celebrate Rafa's victory tomorrow xD  Vamos Rafa :) !! xx|`|w8fP7aBNaa	well if thats the attitude of nadal of giving excuses of being tired after the humiliation him and his fans had to go through after tsonga slaughtered him, then i say nadal needs a hard look at himself in the mirror! nadal owes his fans after the insults his fans had to put up with after the tsonga match last year, it was an absolutely disgraceful performance last year against tsonga! i dont care how tired he is, he owes his faithful fans!|`|AI2SRjLaaa	I hope Federer wins, though I am just looking forward to a good match.    Both are great but I am leading towards Federer.|`|8FM4xpBQaa	I'm defiantly going for Federer...all the way!!  I really hope he wins, he deserves another 14th Grand Slam Title|`|e7f9613d5b480e9758d037bfe66ac6b9aa	yup|`|gP7IB2XCaa	rafa's just making excuses in case he loses.  i hope roger wins, but nadal will NOT be tired|`|6QhACK70aa	rafa just putted the pressure on roger's side!  rafa will look GREAT TOMORROW WATCH!  VAMOS RAFA|`|U7BkuEU9aa	I wouldn't count on it...Rafa won't be as well rested, that's a fact, but he knows how to play Fed. I still expect him to win tomorrow...|`|zMSdChKgaa	I pick Federer for the title. However, Nadal recovers easily so I don't think it is going to be easy for anybody.|`|a31kUn1Naa	I'm so ready to celebrate for Federer.

1uSoU8Lpaa	If Ryan Braun went to the Cubs I'd be upset. It would be tough. Good thing he's locked in with the Crew for years.|`|c6q3EERdaa	If Pujols left for the Cubs, I'd be really PO'd. I doubt he would ever leave St. Louis, let alone for the Cubbies.|`|1yuUIN9Aaa	Perdroia in Yankees uniform?

What do you think the chances of that happening are?|`|g9P7oWyeaa	Josh Beckett in a Yankees uniform ? Dont even wanna think about it.|`|nASsjD44aa	not as mad as I would be if your star player left for more money...    *cough cough* AROD      ever wondere why he gets boo at when he comes back to seattle?|`|ecwhBLnxaa	I would get pretty mad to|`|E6EyY1klaa	It depends. I'm a Yankee fan, and I'd be pretty upset if one of my favorites went to another team, particularly rivals. I wouldn't hate them, though, unless they signed for relatively the same amount of money. For example, 90% of the Sox fans who hate Damon for signing w/ the Yanks would've never left those $12,000,000 on the table. Not to mention he gave them a chance to match.|`|AYiVipawaa	i can't stand it. i'm a red sox fan, and it always happens. damon did it. even if we don't have the player yet, the yanks always come and bid higher. like arod, teixeira. the yanks don't even earn their money. they just get money cause they're new york.|`|6tGYe5roaa	That would make me very upset. Seeing Posada in a Red Sox jersey would just make me sad. And it just wouldn't look right.
4293a0ff696620f3c5a721afbba4df64aa	Because the idiot who owns thr Astros actually pitched a fit when Beltran turned down his offer to re sign and went with the Mets. Mc Lane went anywhere that had a microphone to bad mouth Beltran over his decision and how Beltran shunned the Astros. You'd think a major league owner would have a better understanding of MLB Free Agency rules ...then again, maybe that's the type of thing that explains Mc Lane.    "It slipped through our fingers in the last, last few minutes," McLane told the Chronicle. "It was just some sticking points. It should never, never have gotten to this." USA Today - 1/9/2005|`|Wo2TEbHPaa	There jealous|`|yk4S7uuraa	..because he signed a contract to play for the Mets.|`|E6EyY1klaa	They still boo him a little more than he deserves, but I remember watching a Mets-Astros game at Minute Maid Park where he made a sick catch to rob an Astro of at least an extra-base hit late in the game. At first, the fans booed him intensely. Then, after Beltran needed assistance to get off the field due to injury, they cheered him. Since then, the booing hasn't been nearly as intense from Astros fans.    EDIT: Yeah, it was amazing. I'm not even a Met fan, but I watch Mets games a lot. That and the Wright barehand catch always stick out in my mind as two unbelievable plays. There are a lot more, too, obviously, like Endy Chavez, etc.|`|8Rep9De6aa	Because he ditched the Astros fans who worshiped the ground he walked on for a fat contract from the Mets.|`|5WOAi8VPaa	I wont lie to you, It started when Carlos Beltran put on an amazing show in an Astros uniform in the middle of a pennant race. He looked like Mickey Mantle when he played in an Astros uniform. Astros fans wanted him in an Astros uniform more than any other player I can remember.   That made the stuff he pulled on the Astros really really sting.  What he did ...... Carlos Beltran used the Astros very generous offer as leverage to get a huge deal from the Mets.   Not only did he have no intention of playing for Houston, he did not sign the contract with the Mets until very late in the off season while stringing the Astros along the whole time. The Astros didnt offer anyone else a contract because they were waiting on an answer from Carlos Beltran..that  pretty much left the Astros completely screwed that off season.  The "Carlos Beltran/Houston situation" has become the text book case.  You will never see another team put a huge offer on the table for 3 months again.  Teams now put dead lines on deals and pull deals off the table.  And when they do, the pundits bring up the Beltran/Houston situation|`|juFG3VCQaa	cus he played wit the for half a yr and the bolted for the money|`|ZRoxiQ8Raa	because he played for the astros before he came to the mets. just like the red sox boed clemens.|`|KWxwishQaa	im an astros fan and i live in houston beltran sucks after he left he kept complainig about how bad houston was and how he wouldnt reccomend it to other players and since he left no one likes him|`|ikf0UN36aa	because he is retarted
yuZbdQzSaa	If a hook is to big. Put a couple of straight pins in your tackle box or safety pins will work.|`|cJ4EGdwWaa	Paperclip if the swivel point is not strong enough to puncture it, or an old hook.|`|q8dX0MsNaa	there are fishing tools sold for this. or use the point of a hook. l do.    http://www.basspro.com/webapp/wcs/stores...|`|qU03Jegpaa	I would have to go with the  poster that said to use another hook..it's easy and convenient while on the river. If you would rather take care of it beforehand I would suggest using a fly tying tool called a bodkin. It's a pointed tool that is used for intricate applications such as picking out dubbing and applying head cement.     Here's a link    http://www.kmdtackle.com/spirit-river-al...|`|Ct0DRr5maa	they make a tool for just that.  i use it all the time because i make my own jigs/darts.  it's got a small hole in it where you put the eye and then you squeeze down and a sharp point comes through and pops it out.  otherwise a hook you don't mind getting dull will work just as good most of the time.|`|N4t2t3dMaa	there is no use to buy anything for such a small hasel just use another hook and poke out the paint with the sharp end it works fine!|`|z4IcQZGdaa	they make special tools to punch the eyes out, you can get them virtually anywhere they sell fishing equip. usually they come in a kit too with a scale, filet knife, etc... if you don't want to buy one try the point of a compass, (for drawing circles not North South etc..) it worked for me
ySjHowZqaa	I think he won't be much help because of t.o. T.o. will demand the ball and wade phillips will not tell him to shut up.  Roy will not get the ball as much because of selfish t.o. I don't know why they treat t.o. like a god in dallas.|`|0T3qOcUFaa	I think he can do something, he seems like a player that can be a leader on the team down the road. He has tons of talent and didn't have much chemistry with Romo due to limited playing time together. I think they need to get rid of Garrett though for the offense to click.|`|1m60MbsHaa	You can tell that he really does have talent.  Hopefully with  a year to really learn all of the plays and romo being healthy, he'll come on strong and be a big playmaker like TO.|`|fHxpycJSaa	He's the kind of guy who makes a 6 yard reception, with his team down by 20 points and gets up gyrating and dancing. He's a clown. The Lions are better off without him.|`|eIOlBzm8aa	Both Roy Williams suck.|`|ZPJyVOpTaa	Absolutely, especially if T.O goes this off-season like everyone is saying. I mean you cant expect Romo to get everyone the ball, Witten, T.O, Williams, Barber, there are too many playmakers, with limited amount of snaps. T.Os days are done in big D in my opinion and Roy Williams will have a pro bowl season IF TO is not there.|`|uj6v5MWBaa	I dont know what happened to Roy E. Williams. He used to be a Pro Bowl reciever for the Lions but then the ever-talented Calvin Johnson came into the mix so he just stopped trying. The Cowboys will definitely let him go but should shine again in a situation where hes number 1 completely. Maybe in a place like Oakland or Miami or maybe the Titans|`|fHGsk18Laa	Yeah check the stats but also check the facts.    He was sent there to help Dallas but also he was sent there as an eventual replacement for T.O.    If Dallas would just put some discipline into place, they would be unstoppable.  They have so much talent but no leaders.  They need a better balance.  Most of the players are self players not team players, including the owner.. I think if Jerry would let Romo and Phillips lead that team he would be holding the trophy at the end.

FyAGwtA1aa	Stay in shape then if you are already in shape. And yeah, hit the wall and stay on it, always work on your stick skills and running with the ball and shooting and all that. I never had anyone to practice with either so the wall became a nice friend. You'd be surprised at how much better you can get from hitting the wall once a day.    Also work on groundballs, I'm not sure how they work in girls lax but they win the game or lose them in guys lax, so work on scooping, scooping on the run, and etc.    Work on running with the ball in your stick, cradling, and changing direction and all that stuff.    A little practice a day can do wonders.|`|zrb0AC4haa	go for runs. If you can run it makes you just that much better.     If you want more things to do with the stick then go on youtube or something and find some videos about some sweet lacrosse tricks and try to do them.     The faster you are and the more tricks you know with the stick the better lacrosse player you are. =]|`|nqOqaNIEaa	stay on the wall and never get off, lift weights, speed drills, shooting drills|`|Fl1MqgJRaa	defiantly keep at it with the wall drills. Even though you are still in shape, you should do these drills to keep your agility up to speed. Lay your stick on the ground and shuffle around the stick for 3-5 minutes, [change directions randomly to keep things going] Also do quick feet up and over the stick, where you move forwards and backwards over the stick as fast as you can. You also want to have a really strong cradle, so the best drill you can do is to start cradling with your dominant hand, then (while your still cradling) slowly move yourself to then ground. You should be able to lay completely on your back and still cradle the way you started. Strong muscles are necessary, so a couple routine trips to the gym to lift weights wouldn't hurt.   Besides that, you'll have conditioning weeks where you'll coach will have plenty for you to do. These drills will get you ready though. Have fun :) lacrosse is one of the best sports.

VZIHy5fLaa	Yes my feet get real smelly in any of those boots.  But I like it because I like to smell my feet when they smell totally funky like cheese.      I also love not using deodorant and working out like friday night, saturday, and then sunday, and then smelling them all sunday night.    I like smells.  I like how sweaty balls smell too.  I sniff the workout equipment at the gym I go to.

OCf7y5FKaa	I honestly do not know if your particular club will. Leisure centres that run gymnastics clubs are under British Gymnastics, which organises regional competitions once you are of a certain level so you can get involved this way. Competitions are fun and rewarding after you work towards it for years.  I know at my leisure centre the club is split into ages and abilities which train on different days. Every couple of years an interclub-competition is organised, which is a good fun day because we meet everyone else and work as part of a team to get medals and positions. The Best-In-Club overall gymnast receives a cup! Anyway..I hope you enjoy the wonderful world of gymnastics!  You may do Proficiency awards, which are badges/certificates you work to complete.

x9GODf8eaa	I have tried the 9k in the past, and was not overly impressed. They were heavier than the vapor xxxx (I use the vapors as a comparable, because thats what you use), not as stiff (powerful), and their main selling feature (the pump) did not make a huge difference for me. Sure, it was slightly more comfortable once inflated, but overall, the skates do not compare with the vapor xxxx's. They are a good skate, but just not as good as the vapors.|`|ll2y4YIGaa	they are all right, i mean dont get me wrong, theyre really good quality, but i prefer the bauer skates over any others...|`|ugth9FDoaa	I like my 9k skates there pretty good
AA10895669	Are you going indoors or out? It's best to just wear clothes that you feel comfortable in and won't limit your movements. I prefer to wear when I'm indoors just a sport bra, long tank top and tight leggings or loose capris. Out side of course it depends on the season. in the middle of the summer I dress as cool as I can, early in the season or late in the season I want to layer up with loose clothing over stretchy clothing, a polar fleece vest and long sleeves. There are such really cute outfits to wear that you can pick up in the clearance area's from places like ems or rei that are good quality and cheap. I buy a lot of my clothing thru Sierra trading post http://www.sierratradingpost.com/ on line

But you should do squares.  You need a grid that is 10x10 and then sell grid squares for $1 each. People just write their names on the squares they buy. Then, BEFORE kickoff you randomly draw the numbers 1-10 and place them across the top of the grid to represent the Cardinals score. Repeat this process and place the digits 1-10 along the left side of the grid to represent the Steelers score. Then after each quarter you take the last digit of each teams score and see which square on the grid it corresponds to. Whoever's name is there gets a monetary prize.    Maybe something like:  1st Qtr = $10  Halftime = $30  3rd Qtr = $10  Final = $50
JQXCdGHYaa	depends on what league|`|l0pHybvxaa	Yes there is, but it depends on your league settings. Check "league settings" when you log-in to your team and it will tell you.
c2666c20df7b27c2859938d7ac3b140daa	Generally its 16 but there are many half marathons and the age limits vary for each one.    Did you have a particular half marathon in mind? You could e-mail the organisers to ask if there is a minimum age limit. You could look at runnersworld for a list of half marathons and find one that will accepts runners your age (look in their 'events' section).|`|nqOqaNIEaa	no age limit|`|MChcDQvYaa	Any age!  go for it! =)|`|LNL1kdhNaa	yah i ran it this year and im 13 and by sis is 15 and ran it's fun!|`|eE7Np0n6aa	Yes, why would there be an age limit?|`|BsDv3k5iaa	I'm sure you can sign up!|`|IITnJjAjaa	Normally in proper races you gotta be 15 (:|`|a955299a310a71175625cded5cea1a76aa	I'm assuming walking is crucial so perhaps 2 years of age works, depending on the learning curve of course. >_>|`|Z7hBhHV7aa	Yep you are.

982f2da475e8bb55ef16be73049cd9a6aa	The more you do it, the more stamina you will build up. So keep going!  I am assuming you are doing a walk/run, so run for 4 mins, walk for 2, run for 4 walk for 2. Or whatever you can manage. Aim to be out for at least 30mins and gradually decrease your walking and increase your running.  The first achievement will be to run for 20mins non stop, when you can do that just increase the time spent running (no walking now!).   Try to do around 4 runs a week to keep the stamina, remember that you will lose it quicker than you can make it. So continuity is the key.    Best time to run is whatever feels right for you, I think that energy levels are said to peak late afternoon. So you might find it easiest then.  If you are an early bird then go in the morning before breakfast, this will give you a great energy boost throughout the day.    If you can run with other people this also helps motivation! Keep going with it and it will become easier!    Good luck and let me know if I can help further :)|`|IITnJjAjaa	Always have a rest day so your body can heal. Or else you will end up with injuries like me for example medial tibial syndrome (shin splints). Make sure you have a decent pair of running shoes and SLOWLY increase the milage/amount you do. Don't rush into and pile a load of training on because you won't benefit from it in the long term.|`|lg2RfcrQaa	You will get better with time.  To start off, do 5mins at 5mph, 5mins walk, 5mins at 5mph, 5mins walk. That will be 20mins in total and seeing as you're a beginner, it'll probably tire you out.  Every few weeks notch up the speed a little, or even better don't walk at all. See if you can do a full 20mins at 5.5mph. Again, every few weeks notch up the time and the speed and eventually, you'll be able to do 30mins without really having to put much effort in.  This is what I did when I started running. I do an hour now without stopping. I vary the speed as well from7.0mph upwardsto make it more interesting. It's taken me since march last year to be able to go from nothing at all, to running as much as I do now.  Hope this helps!  x|`|qrtMPSxSaa	a good 20 mins walk each day is better than a running the more you do it the fitter you become|`|85aEJ2Zlaa	Well, you will definitely improve just keep pushing yourself and you will see great results. Don't expect things to happen overnight this will take time. Personally, I think the best time to run is in the morning. It will start your day off right and you will feel better. One thing is the first guy who answered said to do it so people wouldn't see you struggle. I say that if you are trying your best you shouldn't care what other people think. Hope I helped!|`|1w6m03RNaa	you well get better if you keep on trying just never stop I have been running for about a year now and I'm still getting better. The best time to run is in the morning that's is the time I go because I look like i'm dying. just remember to have rest day's also.|`|WRzl1qsUaa	i think all PRIOR answers were/are good and should help (i'm NOT, however, a fan of just walking -- but that person apparently believes that and it must 'work' for them).      one thing all prior people have emphasized is to KEEP AT IT, don't quit!  the person who said you walk & run, right? --> that is a good approach.  at first you'll have to walk (recover) some.  run/walk.  go for however much time you are allowing yourself, but don't overdo it.  one thing to do is to keep track of the longest workout each week -- and try to go a bit longer/further during your "long" workout each week.    and ... best times to run depends on YOU and where you live.  i live in a high desert environment and cannot tolerate hot weather and running.  THEN i have to run real early in the day (or bike ride, which i do more in summer).  winter:  doesn't matter -- i can run anytime (not at night!).  by "YOU" i mean that some people are naturally more heat-resistant -- i know people who LIKE (love?) to run mid-day at temps of 90 or more!  i was just visiting a place (mid-winter) where daytime highs approached 90!  so, my running "career" / habit would definitely be in jeopardy if i lived there.    YES:  if i run every day (take a day or two OFF each week) i believe that you will improve.|`|LLVg3bSTaa	It really works if you run in the morning . TRUST ME . i usually run for about 20 min.     Monday  wensday  Friday  Sunday|`|B3Cd58ehaa	keep it up and the best time I think too run is at 6-8 am in the morning bc its it gets my day going and I can consentrate more in school bc im fully awake|`|dSmoB64Yaa	The best way to break into running is to jog for as long as you can, then walk briskly, untill you can run again. Eventually, you will become fit, so that you don't need to rest by walking and you'll be able to run continuously. Do not be dicouraged by people who are biased against walking. Walking is good for beginners and people with knee and heel problems. If you walk very fast, it can really get your heart rate going and you can sustain it longer than running, if you aren't used to running. I could run, with my heart rate topping 185BPM for about three miles at about 8.5 minute per mile pace and it took me months to get to that point. I can power walk for five miles, at around a 12 minute per mile pace, with no practice at all, for several months and my heart rate tops at 165BPM. Think about that, 185BPM for 25 minutes or 165 BPM for an hour. I'm guessing the hour would burn more calories than the 25 minutes.  Walking works. I dropped 25 pounds just from power walking. Also walking is something you can do more often, because it doesn't stress your body as much, unless you are true race walker. World class race walkers can walk 12 miles at a 6:20 minute per mile pace. Tell me that won't get your heart pumping|`|Xverqpu4aa	Yes. Practise makes perfect. You will improve.    Do it early in the morning or late at night. This way nobody will see you struggle. Also, it will calm you nicely for the day ahead/ bed.
MKS2JalGaa	What I find is making me better is I run before every single meal I eat. My buddy is in wrestling and he does this. Like run a couple miles before every meal. It gets to the point were every step you take running you can feel the burn!!  Stay away from breads and sugar! I know you think it doesnt affect you body or make you fat, but if you eat a lot of fruit and eggs you will be the star.  When you run think nothing but FORM, how you run, push yourself and think MEDALS. If you dont win, thats ok because you know you tried your hardest, and thats the best. I like to run track not because of the medals, i like it because i like to run.|`|zTRy7Et5aa	what she said:)|`|WRzl1qsUaa	if it's medals you want, then find events where EVERYONE is awarded medals!    if it's developing what will hopefully be a routine and habits that you'll develop for LIFE, i'm somewhat disappointed you even have to ask about eating, "and those other stuff."  don't your parents or someone close to your family have ideas on nutrition?    never mind -- i would like to think most your answers should be obvious.  avoid alcohol to excess, cut back on the smoking, don't get started on cocaine, and don't eat spoiled food from the dumpster.  i'm being a little harsh aren't i?  but get my point?  i would think that anyone would have some idea as to proper nutrition, etc.      again, if it's MEDALS you want, i think EVERYONE in the special olympics gets 'em.  but if you really want to be in shape and condition and demonstrate the prowess to "EARN" medals -- THAT may not come easily.  don't rush into any program.  but once you start an exercize routine, consider keeping at it for life.  i started running in 1964 and have been basically a regular runner ever since.  i know it may sound hypocritical, but since i run regularly, i figure i burn the calories and basically can eat whatever i want.  and yes, i've "won" medals, often (and unfortunately) just by showing up.  but i WAS fairly fast "in my youth" and won stuff then.    whew.  you still with me?  that's perseverance, or boredom.  you should specify WHAT EVENTS you are to do on your school's track team -- if you don't have "natural speed" (i don't) then, sorry, you probably never will win medals for sprint events.  but i think ANYONE can develop into a distance and middle-distance runner -- and you might have aptitude for the hurdles, for example.  depends in part on WHERE YOU LIVE also -- and what kind of access you have to coaches and information.  good luck !|`|aYsPBtXHaa	uhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh...|`|RqkiKtyOaa	It depends on what distance you are running. Do a lot of quad stretches and remember BATH. Back, arms, thighs and hamstrings. Those are the muscle you need to stretch for running. Drink a lot of water and stay out of the sun at a meet. Get good sleep and warm up before a race. Eat lots of noodles the night before a race and protiens. Don't eat right before your race!!!! Wear sweats over your shorts when warming up to right before the race. STretch before and after running. Wear proper shoes and clothes that don't cause drag in tohe wind, wera your hair out of your face. Practice, practice practice. I will add more later but I have to go. I know what it  is like because I am 12, but don't hurt yourself, good luck|`|stqRSCfwaa	Try running a certain distance, until ur really worn out, then each time u do this exercise try and push yourself further, or run and time yourself, try to beat your record each time......... eat energy food, if you only each sugary food it will only give you a quick boost of energy, eat some pasta and other long engery carbo. also do alot of walking/jogging in your free time|`|SjNpWwSfaa	Practice a lot and drink a lot of water|`|OKTMuTO5aa	ok well first you might want to switch soda for water ,and next first you might want to jog a mile ,Once you can do it without stopping ,you might want to jog half of it ,and then run the other half ,do that for a couple of days ,and then run the whole thing ,you have to really push your self because when I was jogging like the first time ,I really wanted to give up and start walking ,but that makes it so much worse because then you want to walk the whole thing ,so don't stop ,even if your legs are begging you to stop ,don't do it ,continue .    oh also you might want to only eat a few hamburgers a week ,like one a week or maybe even two or three . Oh also french fries and sweet stuff .  switch the sweets for granola bars and hamburgers for salads or one plate or cucumbers .don't eliminate them ,just fewer|`|af3a28b07826dce8ecfc28a5eaa91e13aa	To get better, run 3 times per day until you can run farther, faster, and longer. Stay away from bakery items and mayonaise, butter, deep fried foods and french fries, cut down on red meats.
ydDEKTyoaa	You might not be stretching enough, or you may also be stretching too much. Try to warm up properly to help get your body moving. Stretching before you run isn't necessary in most cases and can actually increase your risk for injury, but stretching after you run is REALLY IMPORTANT. So do it.   You could also just be fatigued and not used to the strain on your muscles. Try drinking more water and take things slower if you're pushing things really hard.   A heating pad, heat compression wrap, hot water bottle, warm shower, etc. will help with the discomfort. I pulled my calf muscle last week and slept with a hot water bottle on it and it was loosened up by the next day. If it becomes a real problem, try talking to your doctor. Good luck!|`|4gZYucHMaa	Perhaps you're not stretching enuf before and afterwards    I always find a hot bath helps loosen me up tho.    Are you doing too much at one time, I find that's how I get after I do a big run|`|7D44tO9Daa	this happens to me when i run after a long break of not running... its just because your muscles are not used to the running...|`|CFSfyXCbaa	Avoid potato and oily food.. drink more water.|`|a2b21f2cee1471018ba8eafddb953922aa	your sore. its means u worked really hard and ur muscles are tight. just stretch. it happens to eceryone.

jY6cis4Kaa	Regardless of how well each fighter prepares himself, there's no great significance in a third fight, especially at their age and point in their career. Holyfield wouldn't be a step closer to acheiving his endless quest of being champ again by beating Tyson. And if Tyson some how surprise us with a win over Holyfield, then the age of Evander will come to question.|`|I1w0HfQbaa	I think Tyson will go 0-for-3 against Holyfield in this fight. I agree with the above posts about Tyson. His fighting style includes blazing combinations, head movement, good defense, and one punch kayo power in both hands. At his age, the only thing he has is one punch kayo power. Holyfield should win because judging by his last fight, he at least put up a good effort against Valuev for an alphabet soup title. This is going to be like Fenech-Nelson III a rematch that took a decade too late to happen and both fighters are too old and no one cares anymore.|`|l4WEwTWwaa	This fight is nothing but a chance for both fighters to get a payday they can actually live off of since they both blew their money like asses. It would be pointless because Holyfield at least stayed in shape while tyson weighs over three hundred pounds and would have to train like hell just to get in shape let alone put up a decent fight. This is a fight almost everyone is expecting Holyfield to win and if Tyson pulls off a huge upset then Holyfield will really be done and reach a milestone we all hoped he wouldn't, eleven career losses. A milestone he never should have reached. Both fighters are old and done I don't want either one to get hurt or lose anymore. Plus this would be a very boring fight to watch. Based on his last performance Holyfield will be carrying the whole fight and when you are carrying a fight by throwing 30 to 40 punches a round that don't even hurt your opponent, you get a very boring fight. This fight will be boring, pointless, and someone is going to have to retire with brain damage before they stop.|`|OVQ4CGTvaa	this fight is unnecessary even if boxing isn't what it once was. facing reality Holyfield and tyson are done this would only be to receive a paycheck because there both broke. really someone is just padding there win or lose column here   Tyson hasn't fought or even trained hard in years. he's no where near in shape for this fight holyfield atleast looked in good shape in his last fight. no question it should Be a easy win for hoylfield.  If tyson somehow pulled off a win idk even know what people would do they would go crazy. lol.  even if Tyson trains seriously at this point in time he does not have the speed he relied on... he still might have power but it will probably won't be enough.   i doubt rooney or teddy atlas would train tyson at this point.|`|kqP7GwOcaa	This fight is no more ridiculous than the Azuma Nelson vs Jeff Fenech III fight so I guess if they can make money watching old men they will, boxing actually may be the world's oldest profession.  Thumbs up to Woody, I agree with him that the fight (if it happened) would be meaningless.  I hope Holyfield finally retires while he can still enjoy life after boxing.|`|Ghiy6Cwlaa	you have to look at the whole thing tyson needs the money holyfield needs to feel he lost in is heart so he can retire but bottom line people will watch it tyson wins to get out of debit holyfield wins yet again that is how i feel|`|3906124cfbe15ee474641dd5c529df6caa	No please boxing does not need to get this low...Tyson hasn't really trained for a fight in years,he is older,heavier and he has back problems...holyfield is showing the early signs of pugilistic dementia (have you heard him talk?) and should not even be fighting at this age. Both fighters shined greatly during their time, and both have achieved a lot, they don't need to go at it again,they have already paid their dues. Moreover at this stage in their careers Holyfield would beat him easily, he is in better shape and can actually compete. Tyson's style of fighting requires blazing speed,agility and conditioning, and right now he has none of these attributes,he has gotten older and his last fights showed that his reflexes are not what they used to be plus I doubt he would want to taint his legacy even further by participating in such a freak boxing match., what we need in the heavyweight division is a unification match to end all debates, wlad needs to step up the plate and face his brother and then go against Haye to raise interest in the division once again.|`|2yhtsxMWaa	ridiculous, old men, no not the ideal fight.

iK9UCuS3aa	I'd seriously doubt it. Their at one of the highest forms of racing in the world and they know what kind of opportunity they have been given so i don't think they would ruin it by drinking before a race. Plus i heard some where that sometimes drivers are breath tested before each race. Now whether that's true or not i really don't know but i think this might just be going over the top.  I think the comment bout Kimi was good. Yea he tends not to show much (if any) emotion.  I see most of the drivers drinking Red Bull or something else during the race weekend. I don't know where an expert opinion might come from, unless one of the drivers actually answers you. If they do then you'd be very lucky.|`|FPJSoxYwaa	I don't think there's ever been a documented race where an F1 driver was drunk but back in the 50's there was a guy named Duncan Hamilton who participated in  the Le Mans race while drunk.    http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Duncan_Hami...|`|e9bv4ijlaa	I don't think so, there was rumours of cocaine use but that was all lies|`|EfxExqrkaa	Maybe only Kimi Raikkonen but hes still one of the best drivers
c12ff2f01aee1d7228df9c10d0d77908aa	This is tricky.  If you have viable gloves then it is down to keeping your hands out of the wind.  I do not know what sort of bike you have, but try this if you have flat or riser bars:    Take 1 washing up liquid bottle and cut it in half, vertically.  Cut the bottom out of the bottle halves and angle the cut on the top, also cutting the pop top out so that you have a circular hole.  Use gaff tape or cable ties to attach this to your bars so that, with some cutting and adjusting, this sits in front of your hands, but just away from the levers.  This is an old trick for motorbikes and should work OK for cycling.  This will keep your hands out of direct wind and therefore negate direct wind chill on your hands.    When I was on motorcycles, as well as heated grips, which are not viable on a cycle, you might look at handlebar bags.    You should be able to make these yourself, although you might have a look at a motorcycle shop and see if you can get a set to fit your bike.  This allows you to put your hands into a warm space.  Again, this takes direct wind chill off of your hands.    Suggestion 3 is to peddle harder.  Get the blood circulation going and this should help.  You might want to get your general circulation checked out.  Perhaps eat more garlic, since this thins the blood, improving circulation.    Luck|`|ENARd1Bfaa	You can buy these heat pack things very cheapily at most homestore. e-homebargains, if you live in the uk.

XQoH9ZI5aa	NO. I prefer to look at the whole picture! I'll look at the 4 years that both of them have been in the NHL over some 2 week period (even if Crosby is 2 years younger). Guess what? Crosby still has more points per game in less ice time.     I would like to know where people get this Ovechkin is a tough guy stuff too! Do I need to post some videos of Mike Richards smacking him around?     Many fans just don't seem to get it...yes Andrew the Caps fan, people like you.........earlier this season, Ovechkin passed Crosby and you were on here saying to get used to it, it would be like that for the rest of the year because Ovechkin is better...yada yada yada........stand up and admit you were wrong.     LITY posted a great answer on the Ovechkin/Crosby debate last week! Did you see it Biology Man?     Then we get answers like the guy above Jay.....Datsyuk is the man. LOL|`|VC5mEULTaa	Crosby could be ahead 166 to 62 and OV fans would still say that Ovechkin's better. The same goes for Crosby too.|`|O5Q4GP59aa	Well, that's just a streak. You could say right now he might be better, but overall, it's going to take some solid convincing.|`|sqfjfR3iaa	No, Ovechkin is better than Sydney crosby and Evgeni Malikin may be as well. Ovechkin does things on the ice that make you jaw drop in amazement.|`|J4xsLrnoaa	ovechkin is MUCH better,stronger more physical|`|x9GODf8eaa	To answer your question, no, this 4-point lead will not change anybody's opinion. At least not the opinion of anyone who is a true hockey fan. Ovie fans will be ovie fans and Crosby fans will be crosby fans. Each will battle and argue for their side until one of them retires ("Ovechkin retired first, Crosby must be better!").     I prefer to stay out of it, mostly because it doesn't matter. They play for separate teams in separate divisions. They are both MONUMENTAL assets to their respective teams. They will both go on to win multiple Rocket Richard, Hart, Lester B. Pearson, Art Ross, and possible Conn Smythe trophies, and eventually reach the hall of fame. Crosby may end up with more points, does that make him better? No. Ovechkin may end up with more hits, does that make him better? No. If I had to choose one to be on my team, I would probably go with Crosby....    Yooperchris - Where do you get off saying that Ovechkin is the better leader? Last time I checked, his team disagreed with you, as Chris Clark is the captain (therefore the best leader) of the capitals. I can't say the same about Crosby.    Bob - I loved reading your answer, I thought it was hilarious. If I had to be picky, as I flames fan, I must point out that it is Cammalleri, not Camalleri.|`|oJsrGmmPaa	How many whines-per-game does both players have?|`|wS1ePD8haa	well at least ovie has never donkey punched a guy...    and Crosby is not even the second best player in the league.

The pens have had 2 games since the caps have played last.  Ovechkin will catch up they have another game tomorrow and then one tuesday and thursday.  Crosby is not beter than ovie.  Bob I'm always on here after caps games looking for questions abou the caps or the games.  When i see when related to ovie i usually answer it.  I have pleanty or reasons why i think ovie is better but its a huge paragraph and I got tired of typing it over and over.    Ovechkin's 1st goal today, thats all i have to say right now    about those turnovers, ovechkin said he was still a little sleepy from the early start  and I'd just like to point out that the caps are 31-1-1 when ovie scores|`|FG3qT6BWaa	We are talking about ALL-AROUND players. You forgot to add Plus-minus = Crosby +5, Ovechkin +13  Shots on Goal = Crosby 148, Ovechkin 314  Hits = Crosby 50, Ovechkin 160  Take-aways = Crosby 34, Ovechkin 38    just to name a few. I would still pick Ovechkin over Crosby and maybe even Malkin, Savard and Krejci too.    P.S. Ovechkin just scored goals 32 and 33 today.|`|nmHCu44oaa	Ovechkin 33 goals    Crosby 19    Ovchkin leading his team to the playoffs     Crosby 10th in the standings ( i think)    Ovechkin throws his body around and is more physical and plays better defense    Crosby sucker punches people ( i like how crosby punches ovechkin in the face in the boards and quickly skates away before they fight)    Ovechkin doesn't get half the calls that crosby gets    Crosby gets a penalty if you look at him the wrong way    Ovechkin is a better leader and has a much better character and loves the game.    Give me Ovechkin any day of the week. and twice on sunday.|`|Jb5itwHtaa	If all you base your decision on is offense, you can believe that. But Crosby will never be the two-way player the Ovechkin is. Suck it up and be a man, your hero is not, and never will be the best.|`|a9f693c71e4b465afcc9a6b377b02694aa	CBM (if people are calling me LITY, I'm calling you CBM), Bob and FlamesFan said it best.  You aren't going to change anybody's opinion but if but if both players were available today in a draft, Crosby would be the pick of choice by 29 teams.  The GMs are the ones that matter.    Both players are great players.  Both are destined for outstanding careers (if the first 4 years are any indication).  Crosby may be a bigger whiner, but he's more mature and sees the ice better.  For a lot of the same reasons I chose Datsyuk over Ovechkin yesterday, I would choose Crosby over Ovechkin today.    Also, keep in mind that the point total is really irrelevant, Jarome Iginla has 55 points, and he has been an overwhelming choice of NHL GMs and scouts as the best player in the game according to NHL Central Scouting.|`|Uathep5Yaa	Ovechkin all the way, 2 clutch goals in the 3rd vs the Defending Cup Champs.|`|KBUPMW2Yaa	No, because he's not.    Ovechkin has a true passion for the game. He gets down and dirty during games, he can fend for himself. His skills are incredible. He LIVES to play hockey. It's undeniable..    UPDATE: Ovechkin has had TWO amazing games back to back. Two clutch goals yesterday, and now a hat trick v. the Senators. What now?!!|`|PmO8XT5Baa	Whoa, there buddy! Better not get ahead of yourself now...|`|7COIkGNsaa	Ovechkin is still the man|`|qcDHyhdtaa	Here we go again!    Can't we like both?  I like AO better.

Ovechkin might be a bit more fun to watch because of the hits and he involves himself more (both a good and a bad thing) in areas of the game you may not see Crosby. However, in the long run I believe you will win more games with Crosby than Ovie, and winning is the bottom line. I also believe Crosby will have a longer career so if I was a GM I'd take Crosby.|`|G02yovrpaa	There is one big stat for Crosby that you forgot, the whine factor|`|UG1wEbBJaa	Dude no offense but the Crosby Ovechkin debate was so 2005-06.   I thought everybody learned that a center and a winger have two different roles to a team. They aren't the same age and they weren't even drafted in the same season. You're better off comparing guys like Crosby to Thornton or Savard, and Ovechkin to guys like Malkin and Iginla, and all of them are bad debates because all 6 have different styles of playing the game

Swedes or Swedish are very cheap and pretty popular, they have very low profile and sink back into your eyes. Adding the fact that they are held on by basically a glorified string, and their drag in the water is about as low as your going to get. On the other hand, some people, myself included, cant wear them because they dont feel right, this can be a personal deal so i suggest trying them out to see.  My personal favorite, as well as that of almost everybody on my club team, are the Speedo Vanquishers. They have very low profiles, but they feel great and fit excellently. and if that doesnt sell you, they come in a bunch of pretty dope colors too.  Finally, there are all the new LZR (read LZR replace with: hey buy this stuff cause we made one uber fast suit, thus everything else we touch is gold) goggles. I dont know much about theses, except they look like the Vanquishers. They might be worthwhile, and on the plus side, they only filled up with water in one of Phelps 8 finals *sarcasm*.  Hope this helps.|`|K9r8fQtFaa	with different types of eye socket bones it just varies to what fits your face ill be honest i like the smaller goggle that fit snug not the huge ones some would be speed sockets (a.k.a. phelps) sometimes for races ill throw on a pair of swedish goggles (a.k.a. sweddes) but only for races  cause if u have them on too long they hurt my eyes      also take into consideration if your doing out door swimming go with mirrored or tinted goggles when inside stay with normal lightly tinted goggles

Stop talking like dumbasses. They have it they're using it. If your team had money, would you be saying stuff like that. Probably not.   Now to your question, they need to get a bit more help in their bullpen. A big hurler with some consistency. Other than that, I think they're set. They don't wnat ben sheets because of his injury problems. they made a mistake before on a big game injury prone pitcher. I like the idea of sending Joba to the bullpen but why waste such a talented arm for just a couple innings. From what we've seen last year, he can throw.He was one of the most explosive pitchers when he was throwing. I'd recommen signing someone to that bullpen.

1w6m03RNaa	I don't think so unless your sprinting it won't help it would also add weight so then you couldn't run as     fast.http://sportsmedicine.about.com/od/anato... hope this helps|`|J6xmZqj1aa	Yes, actually pulups were some of the only upper body exercises the Bill Bowerman used on his runners.  I am extremely competitive, and I do lost of chin ups to try and balance out the body.  But in all honesty its mostly vanity, I can do 41 in a row|`|AA10241450	Couldn't hurt - try a balanced approached working all your muscles especially your legs along with intervals and hills.  Good luck!|`|ocHNtbQZaa	The only thing that matters for running is how much muscle support force you have at ground contact. Pull ups do not add to support force so have nothing to do with running.
8qpvfL1kaa	You can definitely still learn how to figure skate. There are adults many times older than you who are also learning how to skate for the first time. Don't let your age stop you ;-) You can check to see if your rink offers group lessons. They're usually cheaper than private lessons and a good way to get started. Sometimes there are Adult classes offered that teach the same basic skating skills to adults or teens--basically so you don't have to be in the same class with five-year-olds if you don't want to, haha.|`|JiEvzbjVaa	sure, I started figure s8ing at age 11, and now, after just two years, I can do all kinds of spins and double jumps. You just gotta be committed cuz you really want to, and love what you do.  Don't give up easily either!:)|`|ttbho89Vaa	you actually pass through the levels faster than you would if you started when you were like 3. because 3 year olds have a short attention span and they are more difficult. i started when i was like 10 and now im 14 in fs7!! sooo good luckk!!!|`|OFQoL7H9aa	well sorry you will need money no matter what unless you teach yourself at a free skating pond. But if you don't take private lessons you'll have to take group lessons to learn the things....or know what to learn. Besides the money I think your totally fine being a "figure skater". I started at 6 and now am 12 and still skating having the best time ever in competitions but you don't have to do the competitions but it's realllllyyyy funn!  hope you will!  sry if i didn't help|`|THyCWTMAaa	I started skating when I was in 7th grade, so it is possible!  Check out this YouTube account:  http://www.youtube.com/user/Gina10179202  This girl taught herself how to skate, and now she makes skate help videos.  She is very good/helpful!|`|TzENTI8Saa	idk|`|GGEAttkgaa	ugh!!!!! never call spins "twirls" lol. I hate when ppl do that.

95bb76d0439c02bb72678f77c90632acaa	Just about the best reef diving you can experience without crossing an ocean. At many resorts there, the reef and wall are a shore dive, not a boat dive. It's right there. Good choice for a destination and the beer is cheap too.   I stayed and dived at Anthony's Key. It's a full service dive facility. They even had a chamber. If you haven't picked a place to stay yet, I'd give them a big OK sign.|`|fHJqqMzLaa	I have been to Roatan several times.  The scuba diving there is great.  The reefs are well established with larger marine life than a lot of other places that I have been.  I will put in a plug for the Bay Island Beach Resort as that has been a more than pleasant stay.  The resort is located right off of spooky channel which offers some great shore diving.  Non divers will enjoy the snorkeling trail  right off of the beach as well.  Here is a link to their website.  http://www.bibr.com/  Roatan is also where I did my first shark dive.  It was with Waihuka Diving and is offered as a side trip for those interested.  I was very impressed with the professionalism of Waihuka Diving with regard to the shark dive.  Shark diving was never on my list of things I wanted to do while scuba diving but I am glad that I did do it.  Their website is under construction but it is http://www.waihuka.com if you want to check it occasionally.  They Bay Island Beach resort offers a place away from the hustle and bustle.  Our Dive store ( http://www.visibilityunlimited.com ) has done several Murder Mystery Trips at the Bay Island Beach Resort.  If you stay their you will see our t-shirts on the ceiling of the outdoor beach restaurant.  I hope you enjoy Roatan.

They included the following;    1) The event is televised all over the world.    2) The commercials    3) You have the two best teams in the NFL competing for the most valuable trophy is sports.     4) The Super Bowl helps pizzerias make money since Super Bowl Sunday is the day that pizza places make the most pizzas.    5) The Super Bowl is good for discount retailers (like Target) and grocery stores (like Kroger) because people purchase snacks to serve to their guest as they watch the Super Bowl.|`|v1fo0ZWnaa	I dont get ot excited but i play football so it is cool to watch for me i dont know about why others spend alot of money for a one day thing that is just stupid.

So with the World Cup you will see companies in some of the Countries shut down for the game. Come on now, you don't see a company shut down for the Super Bowl, which is part of the idea of having it Sunday when most places are shut down. The thing is people like to see a Championship game. They like to see the best teams go at it. Then you get the ads because so many were watching it. That brought more viewers, so companies focused on making the best ads for the game.|`|W1XZ4kAVaa	Because it's only the biggest football game of the NFL season|`|f9sL3WgQaa	its hobby nothing more.|`|26e1b99c52b8488a8109c1f532ad3a59aa	0H I D0N'T KN0W...

In his aussie football style, he has kicked the ball 80 yards straight, but ave about 43 with the Cardinals|`|kE1S2bTpaa	cardinals. although I like the steelers better. they've won some super bowls - the cardinals are newbies. they have a great coprs of receivers and k warner throwing the ball. look for edgerin james to have an impact. fantastic career who has done nearly nothing the last two years. a chance to go out on top. pitt will be playing the pass and the run game should be there. two amazing receivers - fitzgerald for cards and h ward for pitt. hope i didn't slight boldin but it is fitzgeralds year. he's the man. not much of a rothlisburger (spelling???) fan either.
ebR3nOL1aa	America has this idea of being a must-be the most powerful, popular and influential country forever. Tennis is an English (or French) sport. So in any way, it's never an original American sport.     When you hear the word 'football', the picture that first comes to the minds of vast majority of population is the type we see in Premier League, not American football. And American Football is more popular type of football to Americans. You see, Americans should support their 'own football' to maintain that influence to other countries and create a power of trend. All eyes is on America, right? So when other countries see what's hot in America, other countries tend to follow it.    You see fast foods, cars, appliances, banks, gadgets, music, movies, and so on, America has established to be the first, except sports. They used to be  1 in the Olympics. Now, when it comes to tennis, Americans won't adapt or support this cuz it's not theirs. There's no solution nor chance that Tennis will be popular as much as basketball or American football, unless they will modify the sport and call it 'American Tennis'.|`|d44d8834433f98c3a93f35f420d4a381aa	Because they don't have cheerleaders.|`|zMSdChKgaa	I think that people in America are too focused on the sports they grew up with. Many people don't try new sports, they like to stick with what they're used to. In order for them to like tennis, there needs to be something or someone that promotes the sport.|`|U7BkuEU9aa	Right...well, I bet if Roger or Rafa were American it would be right there with...hum, maybe not football and basketball, but it would at least be among the top 5 sports in the US. But tennis not being popular in the US is news to me...you guys idolize the Williams sisters!|`|iyDXt5d9aa	I've heard people say that tennis went into a slump for awhile where it was just really borin...same people winnin on their amazin serves and what not. But its different now and I wish people would watch more, its so amazin!!! =)|`|bwygouP8aa	The players being produced in the sport like a like-able personality. Serena has the potential but the media choices not to push her.|`|uWYlumvsaa	To produce the kind of American players that are worthy of drawing in more American fans. Most American players lack fitness, focus, confidence, consistency, and a well-rounded game. They've been trained to just pound the ball hard and serve big, which is not the complete solution for winning, and until the US figures this out, American tennis players will always stay far behind the competition. Once Serena & Venus are done, it will be an awfully long time before we see an American who can produce the kind of tennis, worthy of winning Grand Slam titles.     The same can be said for the men's game. Delic looks promising. Then there's Sam Querrey, John Isner, and Donald Young. I don't think Querrey or Isner will be around the game for long, considering they have serious disadvantages with their height. Donald Young showed major promise when he almost defeated James Blake at the US Open last year. His problem is that he doesn't have the right people around to take him to the next level, which will always hold him back until he makes the change.     Russia, Serbia, and Spain are producing some stellar players and they will continue to dominate the talent of the tours, until the US gets its act together in producing more quality tennis players.|`|E8dcbmwJaa	Tennis needs to stop being promoted as a rich, old-school type of sport.  That means that the grand slams need to embrace technology such as the hawk-eye and maybe good background music for the matches to spice things up. Perhaps, if the court wasn't always shown from the same angle, that would attract more attention, as it makes the game seem more like it's in motion. If you're not a tennis player, you have to have interesting, glamorous things to keep your attention.  How many people would be fans of football if it werent for the cheerleaders, the bands, the crowds, the glitzy animations and commercials? Thats how people get sucked into it.  If the USTA doesn't want to go that route, it needs to make tennis one of the most played sports in america.  It can do that by starting to make its own inexpensive racquets (i think theyre starting something like this for kids 10&under), clothes, balls, and other equipment.  Also it would help if the grand slams were promoted less as a "good old tennis match, like back in old-tymie england", and more like a boxing match, where there are two intense rivals facing off on the court.  What with the level of pro tennis matches today, that shoudnt be too difficult.  If the USTA does its research, it would be pretty easy to promote it as the new popular 21st century sport|`|ea059efe053f1e8b4703c42abc3c7a5caa	Even when Pete or Andre were winning, Americans still focus on their football or baseball.  Tennis is something fat people watch and less than half of the population is actually fit.  They like football or baseball because it allows them to identify themselves with the players who are equally heavy, if not heavier.|`|sywoTNKgaa	I don't think a lack of American talent is the problem. There are a lot of talented kids in America who aren't getting the PERSONALIZED help they need. Most coaches go abroad to "recruit" talent for the same reason some American minor league sports stars play abroad: the money.     Tennis needs to drop the grandpa image and urbanize the sport. Venus and Serena were great marketing tools, they had the ability to reach an urban audience beyond the country club.    At the height of their careers they started to do just that. Rather than embracing them as great champions the way golf embraces Tiger Woods, the tennis media ripped them apart. Scrutinizing their every word and every move, making them more villains than heroes, more hated than celebrated. This was a huge blow for tennis popularity and an opportunity missed for American tennis.    On the men's side the two best players in the world are Nike players and it's unfortunate that Nike is taking them down a very "metro-sexual" road with their looks (Federer's outfits, the very purse looking-handbags, Nadal's bedazzled shorts, capris, etc) further adding to the tennis is a "gay" sport image.    The bottomline is tennis has an image problem. Until the sport cleans up its image there is no way it will be as popular as Football, Basketball, Baseball, or even Golf. Just being a fun sport alone is enough to keep people interested. I think it was Andre Agassi who said "image is everything"|`|OMgZgBxEaa	Quite honestly, if you don't enjoy tennis, it's really boring to watch; i mean "woo hoo, they hit it back, and, whoa, they hit it back again". they can't appreciate it. i know i used to not like tennis, so, in turn, i didn't enjoy watching it. sorry, but music-- wouldn't work. you really couldn't do it except during switchovers. and tennis is SUCH a mental game. i know andy roddick hosted an event called rock 'n racquets recently. it was really fun, because there was music. and, while they were playing, since it wasn't a tournament or anything, they were having fun and talking. i think if they had more of those, tennis might seem less serious and more fun. also,i f the players were shown more, people would think"hey, i want to watch ____________ play tennis, becuase i saw her on __________.

lDNZMmOZaa	I almost completely blew out my knee my junior year of football (torn ACL, MCL, and PCL) and it took me a until the winter of my senior year to get back to snowboarding.  However, my injury was a bit more severe than yours and was late in the season (late October), so by the time I was healed up, the season was over.    Typically with a torn ACL, recovery period is 6-8 months after the surgery before you should resume full regular activity.  I'd consult your surgeon or physician before giving snowboarding a go.

Rub Shaving cream all over the glove.  Make it a light coat, all around and especially in the parts that prevent you from closing the glove all the way (the outside part of the glove that touches the pinkie-side of your palm).  Do not use shaving gel or those kinds of products because they don't have the key ingredient that softens the leather.    2. Then place your glove in the oven, at 125 degrees for about 15 minutes.  Once you bring it out, put shaving cream all around your hand then put your hand in the glove so that it forms around your hand.  Try to keep your hand on the glove until it isn't warm anymore.  Don't keep the glove in too long or have the oven too hot because this process slightly lessens the durability of the leather.    3.  Play lots of catch.    4.  Keep a Softball in your glove at all times when your not using it so that you get the pocket exactly how you want it.      5.  Be rough with it.  Grab the thumb and pinkie sides of the glove and break in the pinkie side of the glove that touches your palm.

q8dX0MsNaa	if you are using lures, don't use any extra hardware. just tie your lure on with a good knot. if the lure manufacturers wanted you to use a swivel to interfere with the lure's optimum action, the would have supplied one. most recommend against the practice. there are a few that do supply a very small ultralight stainless snap. those aren't so bad.    after you use the 15 for a while and get used to the intricacies of casting a BC, drop down to 12 or even 10lb line. l even use 6 and 8. you will see a BIG improvement in your casting abilities.  and fenwick makes a great rod. l'm sure you'll be happy picking up a baitcaster. best fishin' to ya!    P.S. stick with a good brand of mono.|`|TGm36rBWaa	I agree with bassplay.    When fishing with lures, tie directly to them. A snap swivel can extremely effect the action of the lure.     The only time that I have used a swivel is on a spinner and a buzzbait. Which I would not recommend if you are fishing these lures through weeds. The swivel has a tendency to pick up or snag on the weeds and can become frustrating.    You can though depending on the lure, use a swivel (not a snap swivel) attached to a leader to avoid line twist.     Let me explain;  You have your main line, tie on a swivel and then tie a piece of line to the other end of the swivel and that is the line you would tie to the lure. This is your leader and all you would need is about 6 inches.   Use this mainly when fishing plastics and it will help reduce or eliminate line twist.    Also, if you have never used a baitcaster, don't get frustrated. They are a little harder to get used to then spinning reels. It will help once you get the drag and the brake resistance set up to avoid back lash and turning your reel into a rats nest.     Keep practicing and have fun.
1d4Vin3Waa	The Lee kit will get you reloading, but in the long run the RCBS,Hornaday and Redding offerings are much better, and worth the extra money. You will never kick yourself for buying a quality produce with rock solid performance and the cast metal and heavier duty presses like the RCBS RockChucker is even better then their Partner model. Reloading equipment is a life long investment, and most quality equipment will outlast you and end up with the grand kids.|`|AA11694178	I have used various pieces of Lee reloading equipment and have found all of it to be well made.  It may not be as beefy as RCBS but it is certainly strong enough for most reloading applications.  If you want to do some reshaping of cartridges to form other cartridges from a parent cartridge, I would recommend that you go to an RCBS press.  Otherwise, Lee is a good choice.|`|K5AeQuSNaa	I have used a Lee aniversary kit for over 10 years.  It is great for most reloading.  I got a better scale eventually, but I got along for several years with the basic one that came with the set.  You can't get as much torque on the lee reloading press as you can with some of the heavier duty ones, but that only matters if you are forming the brass from one caliber to another, very different one.  For that you need a bigger press.  For normal reloading, it will work just fine.  I really recommmend them for starting out.  Lee dies are also good, and I have used them for just as long.  Their price is hard to beat.|`|mmIihkZaaa	I've used RCBS and Hornady. Both are terrific. Currently going with Hornady because of the collars that allow you to maintain die settings.  Also Hornady has a great promotion going -- 1000 free bullets with their progressive, 500 with the classic kit (good kit but the scale is on the chinsey side), and 100 with each new die set. At the price of bullets these days, that is a great offer.|`|KDOIKIq2aa	I have a Lee Challenger press, however I'm not thrilled with the new Breech Lock Challenger presses.  Lee Copied Hornady Lock-n-Load design and to get the most use out of the reloader (loading multiple calibers) you need a set of Quick Change Bushings for each set of dies.  My opinion the added a extra piece (or pieces)  that they can sell you.  If using Lee dies this wasn't needed in my opinion.    I like the Challenger press kit and think it's the best for a new reloader to start with.  All it lacks is a reloading manual, dies, case length gauge (if loading rifle cartridges) and components to start reloading.|`|1jmXT4Vvaa	I bought the lee anniversary kit, but it's not really comparable to a good rcbs or hornady.  I have almost entirely replaced all the Components of the lee set with rcbs.  I guess it was more expensive in the long run.  Buy the rcbs and you will be happier.

bB5d5YVeaa	I am assuming you live in the USA.    This is what I THINK you should do.  Talk to your parents and ask them for permission and have them buy you a genuine reproduction of a black powder revolver.  I own 4 of them at present, and they are REAL guns in the sense that they can be fired.  BUT, it takes a great deal of effort to load and fire them AND you have to have the right accessories to do so (powder, roundballs, caps, chamber lube).    Tell your parents that all you want is just the gun and none of the accessories to make it go bang.  Explain that it will only be used for decorative purposes and can't possibly hurt anyone.    The nice thing about this is, these reproduction cap and ball revolvers cost about the same as the non-firing replicas.  But, they also have a higher resale value AND could be shot later in life when your parents feel you are old enough.    Also, these guns are legal to own in about 95% of the USA and they can be ordered and shipped by mail order.  (I bought two of mine through Cabela's.)    Here is a link to the kinds of revolvers I am talking about..    http://www.cabelas.com/cabelas/en/templa...    Be sure to get a revolver with a STEEL frame and not a brass frame.  Steel framed guns last longer.|`|mOTCr8Pxaa	Ebay. there are plenty of online stores that sell replicas.    http://www.trueswords.com/true-decor-fra...    http://www.replicaweaponry.com/replicagu...|`|6sPcYQr0aa	If you just want it to look functional. you can just buy an all metal airsoft gun. cheap and realistic and you have a large number of options to go with. try looking on www.redwolfairsoft.com    they have to ship from japan so look for a shop in the US if you can near you. Like Airsoft Extreme is based in southern california.|`|XAv3og6raa	i've got lots of revolvers, rifles, swords and knives, but the guns have been decomissioned so they cant be used. they used to belong to my father before he died, so im not interseted in selling them, sorry.|`|3b8557f01cef58611c2e78e57d57b1e5aa	Just type in > Replica Firearms, in the search area and you will find lots of them*.. There are lots of them on Ebay new & used.*|`|S2tBYhCKaa	You have the option of weapon replica purchases at some outlets proffering USA western wear attire.  Usually these are lever action  Henry pattern rifles and Colt Peacemaker Model single-action.  It  is also possible to purchase replica badges, spurs, and leg-irons.  Suggest you search Internet for purchase.  Ten minute ride on my DR650SE takes me to such retail but I only traffic in non-replicas.
GRRpbWLoaa	Federal Law requires that only persons over the age of 18 can purchase and own an airsoft gun.  Persons under the age of 18 can only own or use one with parental consent.  You will have to check with your local law enforcement agencies for use restrictions in your area.|`|QTd8MVDjaa	I know dozens of stores in MA (including major retail stores) that sell them. It's only illegal to have if you're under 18 and/or waving it around in public, or if remove the orange tip. I've bought several airsoft guns online and they shipped them to my house in MA no problem. If you're really nervous about buying online and shipping it, find a paintball or sports store in MA and they'll probably have airsoft guns. Or don't buy the gun from the website that says that. I'm sure there are a bunch of other online stores that don't say that on the site.|`|PCZBySLJaa	Yes. It is a bad idea to attempt to buy anything that is illegal in your area, especially a weapon. If you did manage to get hold of one and a police officer saw you, at best you'll be in a lot of trouble, at worst he might think it is real and take aggressive action. This has happened before and people have lost their lives.|`|QqQ6Hghuaa	you must be 18 years of age or older to purchase airsoft guns, however they can be shipped nationwide as long as they have the orange tips on the gun.|`|PPnYJD0laa	as long as you keep the orange tip on you will be fine, and if you're not try to use the airsoft gun for any negative activity

TBD6SPaTaa	Thank you,K.  Oh,no.  You want the Steelers to win?  I've rooted for the underdog before and I'll do it again.  I feel that Arizona is going to win.  They are due for a Superbowl win.  The Steelers have won before.  I'm looking to see a new champion grace the NFL.  Like history has shown us.  Anything can happen in a Superbowl.  Last year,A mediocre New York Giant team dashed the hopes for a New England Patriot team to go undefeated.  And I loved every minute of it.  In 2006,A 2nd ranked Florida Gator team spanked a number 1 ranked Ohio State to become National Champions.  No one expected the Gators to do that good.  But they did.  btw,That backup QB for that team led his team to another national title again this year.  K,To tell you the truth.  I hope both teams do well.  It's a first Superbowl for alot of players on both teams.  This win could only help both teams.  I've gotta run.  I still are going to root for the Cardinals.  Thanks and have a great Superbowl evening.  Bye for now.|`|X4O7W1Vvaa	Trying to stay awake with lotsa coffee.

AA11760438	Raiders dont have much of a D-line problem.. the thing is over the last 4-5yrs.. they have always been trying to play catch up.. which means the other team will keep running the ball.. and after 35-40 HB carries.. they will break at one point.. remember the Carolina game.. were they shutted down the run.. but still had to play catch up.. and then Carolina kept running.. until they broke one big for a TD.. if only Oakland can play like they did in the last 2 wks.. they wont have to be catching up from behind much... instead it will be the other way around..     and the Raiders going 3 and out didnt help the defense either..|`|PSMsDalLaa	you signed Tommy Kelly to a big contract. I doubt even undead al is that dumb to spend all that money on another one.|`|q6NGxNR3aa	yes the raiders will bring back Asomugha surely they will right ? al cant be that dumb|`|8kDAgDAzaa	Nnamdi is the heart and soul of that defense and the unquestioned leader.  He wants out.  Frankly, I don't blame him.  Al loves a big name CB in his secondary and I can't remember a time when there wasn't one back there, so I think Al slaps the Exclusive Franchise Tag on him again.  That'll soak up a lot of cap space, but after last year, I don't see how Al can be a big player in Free Agency anyway.    As for Haynesworth, he's working on a deal with the Titans as we speak.  Never say never, but there's little chance of him being in Silver and Black in '09.    As for losing your faith... well, let's not go there.  Either you're a Raiders fan, or you NEVER were.    --RFM|`|fHxpycJSaa	As long as Al is in charge, the Raiders will be a total mess without a chance of winning, and players know that. They have no chance at Haynesworth or any other big name player from another team.
8kDAgDAzaa	No, I don't.  They have a mess on their hands with Javon Walker's contract and if they tag Asomugha, cap money will be tight (especially with Russell's guaranteed monies).    OTOH, Al Davis could be betting on 2010 being an uncapped year.  If that's the case, he could put some hefty roster bonuses in a contract after 2009 that just might be enticing enough to draw an Anquon Boldin or a Chad Johnson type of Receiver.    Stay tuned.  This could get interesting!  Draft Maclin!!  GO RAIDERS!!!!    --RFM|`|1d627596e14caafeacfad98d799d9a7caa	I think they might get Boldin. But on the other hand, they might be looking to draft Michael Crabtree from Texas Tech.     I wouldn't want to trade Michael Bush. I like a big guy like that in the backfield to work in tandem with McFadden. If they have to trade, trade Fargas.    I don't want Chad Johnson or T.O. Remember Randy Moss??? ;-)|`|AA10495394	They should keep michael bush and just draft Jeremy Maclin from Missouri. They should be looking for a tackle for the O-Line in free agency.|`|3b5ba5b8de4869c1b6a9d5e51ae1d8e5aa	Terrell Owens maybe. The Cowboys will probably release him in a couple of weeks.|`|AA11760438	they always do.. they will get the receiver even if they have to trade the  7 pick to chad johnson or Boldin.. maybe a 2nd rd for T.O. the point is, the Raiders will get a Dominant WR in Free Agency.. Trust me they will.. weather a player wants to go there or not, doesnt matter.. the $$$ and the brainwash of Al Davis will land them there.. Expect Al Davis to make a big move for a WR. a bigger move that will even leave Jerry Jones with the mouth open..|`|PSMsDalLaa	unless its by trade. I doubt they would try, although they are dumb cuz of what happen with Javon Walker
2m1hbw2iaa	Well, obviously you don't *have* to be huge.  But hugeness comes as a side effect of the massive amounts of weight lifting you have to do if you want to be a successful shot put athlete.  I'm not sure how old you are, or how serious you plan on being, but if you want to pursue a long-term shot put career it's inevitable that you'll become huge.
zFTSg47waa	If it's really slate, it'll be pretty heavy. I think most 7 foot tables have 1 piece slate too, so you'll need a moving truck to do it. If you can get a few more friends together, you can do it yourselves. Just be careful not to damage anything and keep track of how you took it apart so you know how to put it back together. The next hardest part will be leveling the table once you have it set up, but that can be done by yourself too.
UictPrl5aa	not breathing is usually the result of being choked, ufc or not|`|M5XjqI40aa	Yes. They can "tap out" or the ref will stop it if they pass out.|`|5ExSaZ9Qaa	That's where the phrase, "Tap out or pass out" originated from.    But yes you can choke your opponent unconscious.  If you do so the ref will call an end to the fight.    That individual will get a win via knockout submission.|`|b236e9c68adebf7ae2fb536ad0c0a09aaa	I guess you could. Its not among the list of fouls:  1.   Butting with the head.  2.   Eye gouging of any kind.  3.   Biting.  4.   Hair pulling.  5.   Fish hooking.  6.   Groin attacks of any kind.   7.   Putting a finger into any orifice or into any cut or laceration on an opponent.  8.   Small joint manipulation.  9.   Striking to the spine or the back of the head.  10. Striking downward using the point of the elbow.  11. Throat strikes of any kind, including, without limitation, grabbing the trachea.  12. Clawing, pinching or twisting the flesh.  13. Grabbing the clavicle.  14. Kicking the head of a grounded opponent.  15. Kneeing the head of a grounded opponent.  16. Stomping a grounded opponent.  17. Kicking to the kidney with the heel.  18. Spiking an opponent to the canvas on his head or neck.  19. Throwing an opponent out of the ring or fenced area.  20. Holding the shorts or gloves of an opponent.  21. Spitting at an opponent.  22. Engaging in an unsportsmanlike conduct that causes an injury to an opponent.  23. Holding the ropes or the fence.  24. Using abusive language in the ring or fenced area.  25. Attacking an opponent on or during the break.  26. Attacking an opponent who is under the care of the referee.  27. Attacking an opponent after the bell has sounded the end of the period of unarmed combat.  28. Flagrantly disregarding the instructions of the referee.   29. Timidity, including, without limitation, avoiding contact with an opponent, intentionally or consistently dropping the mouthpiece or faking an injury.  30. Interference by the corner.  31. Throwing in the towel during competition.     However choking someone in the sense of resiting air is not what most trained submission artists do, those are blood "chokes" which close the carotid artery not allowing blood and therefore oxygen to be carried to the brain causing someone to passout.     The kind of choke you are referring to is seen as not as effective because you have to use some sort of brute strength to close one's airway and time to take effect may vary, while closing the carotid arteries will yield results because of leverage uses little strength and more successful and consistent in the length it takes for someone to go out.    Anyways regardless you can get "choked" to the point you tapout or passout to which the ref will stop the fight.|`|V5ZpqRs8aa	Yupp. Once the person getting choked can't take it any longer they either go unconcious or tapout.|`|fRosDAZEaa	Yes, that is how many matches are won and lost my friend.|`|wRLJM7Rvaa	yes... but that only if they havent already tapped out  otherwise then the ref will break them up

ywlNjeWmaa	You are in the prime of puberty. You are growing like a weed right now. If I were you I would eat protien like mad. Meats and stuff like that. The building blocks of growth. Try to make it somewhat healthy. Alot of my friends drink those protien shakes. I am not a fan of them, but they work. Then obviously work out. Lift weights and improve your strength. If you do this you will fill out.   Now here is the key. Stretch. Stretch. Stretch. All fast runners are very flexible. Before, during and after every work out and game stretch. Stretching helps blood flow and the nerves that are key to speed. Also, practice sprinting. There are various drills that you can do to improve speed. These go way beyond just sprinting alot. Go out to the pitch and run 10 yard drills. High knee drills. Arm pumping drills. Wrist wipping drills. Start drills. Starting drills. If you research them on the internet you should be able to find videos on them. I would look at youtube.   The key is to stretch. Unless your are getting to be a bodybuilder, as long as you stretch you will not be slowed by the muscle. Besides, stretching will help you thru your injuries. I played 7 years of Rugby. Its not if you get hurt; its when, how bad, and what you do to recover. I love the game. I was your age when I got involved. Have fun.

AA11570394	In the frontier days a large pistol was called a hog leg or a sheeps leg. At the time its was used to be more dramatic about their pistol on the hip. Since the shape of the pistol curved like a leg it was referred to for large cap and ball revolvers. So it was describing a large bad azz revolver hung on the hip. Just as pea poppers were describing small caliber, small frame handguns.  A Hog Leg is also the nickname for an 1860  Colt .45 Revolver.    http://books.google.com/books?id=i33BWgx...    http://books.google.com/books?id=ioHbdtj...    Today many use hog leg to describe large handguns.|`|eZiOe9kFaa	DUE TO THE SHAPE OF THE GUN . THE HANDLE RESEMBLES A HAM|`|nooi0ldjaa	never heard of it? guess its just a nick name.|`|1jmXT4Vvaa	Has to do with the shape of the hammer on old single action revolvers.  Some where, some time, somebody thought they resembled the shape of a pig's back leg.
99amr13kaa	hmm dont get mad  if i choose the wrong sport, but i would probably go with basketball if you arent done growing. if you are that would help. also if you can feed the ball would be better. nobody likes a ball hog. also you rebs. and in baseball it would depend on your arm. if its weak then go with basketball. also your agility for running the bases. nobody likes a slowpoke. hope i helped.

oNR7il8baa	He's been injured how is he expected to score when he hasn't played.     I love Torres it'd be a shame if Liverpool make his quality bad after this season. He has so much skill and potential. Back to Atlti he'd go... Maybe haha.     AUPA TORRES =]    @Med Amine: He'll pass Pato this Weekend hopefully :P hehe    Yes but Pato has not been injured for the amount of time Torres has been. So it does say that if Torres wouldn't have been injured and played the amount of games Pato had he would have surpassed that ratio.    Edit: I said for the amount of time lol, not that he hasn't been injured.     I don't follow Pato so much so I wouldn't know. I think Med Amine was just trying to prove the point that Torres hasn't done bad... Which he hasn't.|`|8xPYbHAHaa	torres not better than pato.|`|fEWhwumZaa	Hopefully tomorrow...|`|YmV3TNTpaa	He has the same ratio as Pato..    Torres: 5 goals in 11 games = 2.2  Pato: 9 goals in 21 games = 2.3    EDIT:  I'm not comparing the two players (Torres is obviously way better). I'm just comparing the numbers of this player you're making fun of to the star striker of what I believe being your reference club (AC Milan)    @Stefy: You got that right. Thanks for clarifying

DcEBhY02aa	LOL Canadian Snow Bunny, your such a character. You should run a marathon and tell me if you feel guilty not running for 4 days because of recovery :) If you do feel guilty after that, you will end up running your feet to a stump.|`|0bzIkdyOaa	No, your body needs at least one day a week to recover.a person can be as addicted to running as a person with an eating disorder can be to food or lack of.|`|4A6O6omkaa	Yes I do feel guilty right now!  I went running today but I went so SLOW!  Seriously, I felt really sick.!  Anyway,  I think runnning is simillar to an addiction.  Yes, it is better to be addicted to running than to smoking or drinking, but it also can be a bad thing.  You see, for me at least, all I think about is running.  I think about running when I am at school, watching TV, even when I am sleeping!  So, you are not the only one.  Feeling guilty can get you to run but it also can screw up your brain.  Try to run 5 times a week but don't run everyday!  Then you won't be like me- addicted to running.|`|JZnHYhCwaa	probably, you are guilty of your life b/c you are not training for anything,, just run for fun is not life,in case you are resposible in you life. so you must live your own life.whatever fun has it,s time and when you win your life by hardworking that,s afun.if not you are guilty|`|qnDk8xjPaa	dawgmeat...what an jerky answer.      Hey--  You probably subconsciously do run for exercise.  It makes you feel good because it releases endorphins.  You probably feel guilty because it was part of your schedule even if it was just for fun.  Maybe you can go to a local health club or college/high school and use their indoor track.  I'm a college runner and I have been doing that a lot in this weather.  It is fun because when other people are running on the track too it gets kinda competitive.|`|zSEyaCzCaa	yeah i know what you mean. when I run, I listen to my iPod and get away from everything and everyone. It just clears your mind. If you feel bad about not running because of the weather, just run inside (in place) it might not be the best "trail" you were looking for, but you will feel like you accomplished something that day, even though you didn't go outside or something.|`|JfVxCDb7aa	yes, I work out at my helth club, It's close so I walk------------It's been freezing, to cold to go under zero at night for 2 weeks now, I've only been there about 10  timed in January|`|BzH7l27oaa	yep, I know how you feel, but you have a rockin' body, it can take a vacation every once in awhile!|`|WpqwaqcQaa	how's that song go?

But just ensure that it does not affect your comfort level.|`|Taf5yWUbaa	Yes I do, I feel like I've gained like 20 pounds when I don't work out for a day, especially 2 XD Make sure you run tomorrow or else you'll beat yourself up even more.|`|nqdDe3cJaa	sounds like you should be posing this question to a psychiatrist, and not to the Yahoo Answers community.|`|ydDEKTyoaa	I haven't run this week at all either. It's been -20 or more pretty much all week and I've just felt really lousy. And yes, I feel guilty. That's why when I go running on Monday (If I'm going to take the week off, I might as well rest on Sunday too :p) I'm going to push myself extra hard. Guilt can end up being a great motivator!|`|h1qCOpFEaa	AWFUL, FREAKING AWFUL!! the ONLY time i skip a workout is when i am sick, last Friday i had the flu so i couldn't workout, to be honest i was so sick i didn't care but that is the ONLY thing that stops my workouts.|`|3Tqfmtxwaa	i felt guilty during the cross country season when i didn't get to practice cuz i was sick, and i felt guilty today because i didn't go run my driveway (1/4 mile long). for me it's cuz i love to run though.
F5Jms9OBaa	I think it's absolutly stupid that they might even consider getting rid of RONDO....They had all this talk about him being the future of the celtics and now they want to trade him for Stephon Marbury...A NOBODY....He used to be a somebody for about a year but then he just...HE SUCKS!<br>  <br>  He is a bench person not a starter and to fill and take rondo's place would be very hard and a stupid move by the Celtics. I don't mind if that Mikey Moore guy comes to the Celtics cause we need at least two centers. Cause Big Baby and Leon Powe are Power forwards.<br>  <br>  ANd back to the rondo thing...Rondo has showed that he is capable of being the future of the celtics and has shown that he can step it up to the plate and fill in for anybody taht gets hurt!|`|vFbzBo4eaa	LOL,replacing Rondo,they would ruin the chemistry of the team and for Moore,he can do good job in the Celtics in stead of Big Baby Davis|`|JhrdIVBgaa	I dotn think Stephon will replace Rajon. If they do sign him then they will probably make him the 6th man. And yeah I agree about Mikey Moore, honestly I think as logn as someone is there covering for KG they will be fine because they have so many other great players.|`|ED7bwcdnaa	I see marbury as a bench. Not as start for Rondo.|`|ur1bnkrZaa	celtics are stupid they make me sick.<br>  <br>  old men. <br>  i hate the celtics players, coaching staff, and stupid fans.<br>  <br>  dosent matter who they add lakers are gunna treat them like a dirty step child. and i cant wait!|`|CO2o0YYMaa	No, the Celtics will not trade Rajon Rondo. If they sign Marbury, he will be a bench player. Moore would not be a bad signing if the Celtics get him.|`|8oKjViUOaa	dude i would be so pissed if they traded Rondo.  is mikey moore a good center?

It is very unrealistic for them to fight and lose to anyone other than each other. Umaga and Kozlov are not in that category.   For what it's worth, all things considered, Umaga is potentially the best wrestler in the WWE (my bias says Edge!). For his size, Umaga is incredibly fast, agile and he is definately strong. At WM 24, the Raw vs smackdown match was Umaga (Raw) vs Batista (Smackdown). For the first time I can ever remember, Umaga got the greater cheers - more than Batista! I hope they push him again because he is super-talented, more so than his over-rated cousin, the Rock!    As for Kozlov, I think his most suitable opponent is Jack Swagger (the ECW champion). WWE can play on the America vs Russia angle.|`|YwEFJWR7aa	Kozlov vs Umaga

I think he suffers from having a similar player - Lampard in the same team. He does appear to be coming into a bit of form of late, so let's see what he can do at Liverpool.|`|2dgVkcVAaa	i'm a Bayern fan since 1996 and i don't want him back with us nor i want him 2 play 4 Germany b/c he brings bad luck.|`|cd8fb1a8552a48786a6354cd99f5f249aa	Ballack is a great player, you dont hear so much of him in Chelsea because he would be injured, remember how he beat manchester united on his own last year, scoring both goals and closing the gap on them in the league. and his leadership was important in the Euro, Germany wouldn't have gotten to the final without him.|`|M0gdrhB2aa	yeh, i agree i did like him in Bayern better...i don't realize he's playing half the time so i guess i don't focus on him much..he can be a great player..and definitely was..as for now..i dunno much!

sNAjM7ttaa	Football American  Basketball  Baseball|`|Hv28Z6qdaa	Soccer + Gymnastics|`|deuYlqvwaa	TENNIS  no doubt about it  i can't put into words my love for the game.|`|OCf7y5FKaa	GYMNASTICS and TRAMPOLINING!  Gymnastics because it is tremendously rewarding! Practice, strength and flexibility are key. In my opinion it is the best sport in the world because it is independant and beautiful. Your effort does not affect a team's and you work to build the three key elements. On the other hand, teams competing require everyone's input. I also think gymnastics is the best because olympic gymnasts are young and desirable (not in a perverted way, more like in an inspiring way) and go on to do great things. The gladiator Cyclone is a stunt double, trapeze artist and former gymnast. She is a highly skilled acrobat who has a wide variety of performances which include abseiling, trapeze, and acro-balance.  Trampolining because bouncing is fun... But seriously, trampolining has a wide variety of skills most of which can be performed piked, tucked or straight. So it is interesting to watch too!|`|qixdmJ5raa	Tennis.  Second is football.(american football. NOT soccer.)  Third is soccer.|`|7b3LPDCpaa	1. FOOTBALL (American)    2. BASKETBALL    3. NONE!|`|5YVfVhRUaa	that is a very bland question.and your going to get a whole bunch of different answers.i do olympic style weightlifting(NOT body building).this requires strength,speed,technique,and comitment.it takes forever to learn but get a lot out of it.football(american) is a very tough sport with speed and strength,like lacrosse.soccer reguires a lot of stamina and speed.so yea it depends what you like|`|RzIiywZ6aa	SOCCER  hands down.

1XEUETPKaa	If you want something light and Nike (because you like them), then go with the Nike Mercurial Vapor IV's. For a light adidas shoe, F50.9's.     Otherwise for Nike shoes, T90 Laser II's or Air Legends, or Super Ligeras are pretty good (but they're heavier than vapors).    For adidas shoes, I would most definitely say Predator Powerswerve. If not them, then either AdiPures or AdiPure II's (they're the same thing technically, just different stitching and different look)        oh, and DEFINITELY NOT ABSOLADOS.

Joe Torre is one of the most respected managers of his time and he was treated disrespectfully by the Yankee's ownership.  And I'm a Red Sox fan.  I hated Joe Torre when he was a player.|`|AA12374240	i think 230+ years ago, a bunch of farmers decided that they had had enough with being a collection of colonies and decided to do something about gaining their freedom. once that was reached, they did the best they could that anyone living in the country would be free to speak and write what they think. im not saying i would do it, that is, talk poorly about a former employer. but, as citizens, we have the right to say what we think and so, joe has the right to say what he wants, and i have the right to not agree with him for doing it. it's not perfect but at least we're free to do it.|`|k1J2slCQaa	I say thanks|`|AA10399154	Well, there must be some truth to his book otherwise the Yankees or its players could file a lawsuit for libel.

mJvZhdAuaa	Eventually, yes.  I think it is high time that Matt got to be the "bad guy," even when he was trying to kill Edge, he was the good guy, and everyone thought "poor Matt."  Now, it's going to be "damn, Matt, why did you do that?"  But, remember that the Hardys used to be "bad" when they were with the Brood, and then they went back to being good!|`|YgVtCX3raa	Matt will suck as a heel. Saying he was no longer Jeff's bro looks unrealistic.|`|4tvI9WYjaa	some how i like him as a heel better as a face  i think they probably have him a heel til wrestle mania is over but i think  they should keep matt hardy as a heel and plus it help out the heel section on smack down.  because you really only got edge chavo curt hawkins and zack ryder and vickie the big show so i think it be good if matt stayed heel and maybe finish off with the united states championship.|`|AA10034255	It depends on the script!|`|0P40aUA0aa	yes he will be|`|az5NtgN6aa	HOPE SO

GCOrku95aa	Two races does not a season make. Just think about this: IF the Daytona race hadn't been shortened by rain, how many other drivers could have won? IF Brian Vickers did not have to start from the rear on Sunday? IF Greg Biffle hadn't screwed up his on race by running over his air hose? IF Mark Martin and Dale Earnhardt, Jr. Hadn't lost engines on Sunday? It's too early to start calling out championship contenders when over half the field hasn't really gotten a chance to show what they've got. Let's wait until the Chase cutoff becomes closer, then we'll see who is going to be there when it counts. Keep in mind, Kyle Busch started last season out on a tear, and look where he ended up. People don't understand that wins are great, yes, but it's where you finish when you DON'T win that makes a season. Kenseth proved that in '03, when he won 1 race and the championship. He consistently finished in the top 10 when he had to.|`|4uf044sFaa	He definetely has what it takes to become this years NASCAR champion.  I can name ten drivers that have a good chance at winning the championsip this year.  Hopefully he won't pull a Kyle Busch and do good in the chase.  That is the only bad thing about the chase.  You can win the first 26 races and dominate, but if you do bad in the chase, you aren't champion.|`|YHYT8qMKaa	Yes, I think is capable of winning his second championship. I predicted before the season started that he would finish third in points. I'm still sticking with that prediction, but if he continues to win races like this, he can do even better than that. <br>  <br>  It's a little too early for me to predict how he will do in the chase, but he lost the title to Johnson in the 2006 chase when he started the chase with the points lead. I guess we'll just have to wait and see.|`|IrGapExUaa	Matt Kenseth has what it takes. I think bring Drew Blick over to be his crew Chief was a great idea and there going to have some good wins this season together. Drew Blick has won the last 4 races he has been the crew Chief in. 2 win kenseth and the last 2 nationwide races with Edwards. i think ever one better watch out kenseth could win 7-8 races this season.|`|3971fad8bfeb5090ffc3629ffe9dbd80aa	It's a little early to say, but yes, anything is possible. Matt is pretty consistent and a calm driver. Bad thing is, he always seems to get caught up in someone else's mess. I would luv to see him get another Championship.|`|739f14d79f8285fdffb364bed6c305feaa	I think it's still way to early to tell anything about any of them really..LOL!  The #17 sure has started out impressive he wins the Daytona 500 and backs it up with a victory in CA.  Congrats to him and his fans.  Heck he could 3-peat this weekend Matt really like Vegas too.|`|MWSv1yfhaa	He is definitely off to a good start and he has momentum on his side.  It will be interesting to see if he can keep it up.  I think it is possible but it is still too early to call.|`|p8JfOlTzaa	Yea he could but it would be a long shot. The guy didn't even want to drive last year, he lost his confidence, but i'm sure he has it back now.  he's a great driver so who knows?|`|ec96a7005525b280dafea257208badeeaa	he has what it takes.don't know what lady luck has in store.just have to waite and see.|`|WmqfsK7Taa	theres no dout that matt has what it takes  and roush cars are clearly the consistant teams but luck is allways a factor|`|MYC6Xv1Xaa	Jeff Gordon will stop him from doing that.|`|y3j27KMYaa	he won because Roush Fords are the best, stay tune as Carl Edwards will come back soon to victory lane LOL|`|7B3TwoaSaa	To early to tell...

Last year he stunk up the place in the first half of the season and was way out of chase contention then he caught fire and squeezed into the chase. He looks pretty focused and his crew chief Drew B.(im not even going to attempt to spell his last name) has made the right calls.|`|op9iJRvBaa	I know it is early in the season, but I do believe he could become a two-time champion. However, he will have stiff competition. Jeff Gordon and Kyle Busch are both looking strong too and could give him a run for his money.|`|W2R8TRDmaa	He has totally proven he can win a championship. No doubt there.  But time will tell.  Is he THE favorite? Probably not right now but he could end up being.   Come October November, it's going to be the same ol' cats. 99, 48, 17, 18.|`|EHtFxGxMaa	I think he definitely has a chance.<br>  <br>  But so do a lot of other drivers.<br>  <br>  Lets see the standings @ Lowe's......|`|71c0e431058e396595b5a2772f5b2d6faa	I think he has a chance but its still to early to say for sure if he is going to win the championship. I am still holding out for Jamie McMurray.|`|52Ycgnozaa	I think that it is way to early to predict that. I do think he has a chance though.|`|IRbkrJUWaa	He can... but he has to stop Jeff Gordon...|`|xTTP2Bv8aa	He definitely has what it takes and if the luck holds he can get that championship...oooh yessssss

The punches and kicks are not exactly real, but they do hit each other with a little force and slap and knock each other around pretty roughly in order to make the fights look a little bit real. Wrestlers get injured by mistakes and some of the crazy moves they do and they get beat up pretty good trying to "sell" the moves and strikes. The best way to describe what they do, is to call it a stunt show. Stuntmen definitely take a beating and get injured sometimes, even though what they do, is not completely real|`|H09OAJxSaa	WWE IS REAL!!!!!!!!!!!!!!|`|26fb51ead612e7006829de7144c65343aa	its "scripted"    in other words, the outcome is pre-determined but sometimes they do get hurt doing what they do|`|xPy6ZePkaa	WWE wrestling is staged.

XQoH9ZI5aa	I just caught the last 3 minutes of that game....apparently all that was needed!     Gauthier was at the recieving end of some Avery racial remarks after his hit on Roenick resulted in a concussion (can't remember if there was a suspension for the hit).......he also suckered Kaleta of the Sabres last month (no suspension). He was suspended 2 games for a hit on Wellwood awhile back. (I think he was with the Flyers...go figure he got hit with one). One game when he was a Flame for a hit on Dallas Drake. He put Yzerman out once. Two games when he was a Flame for an elbow to Tim Taylor.....LOL...they are adding up! Put Lupul out of action when Lupul was a Duck.   So yeah, he has a rep.|`|3g08yf94aa	it was a dirty hit he jump off the ice, your not allowed to jump when you body check, remember when downey hit mcamond|`|HsJiUVkYaa	i watched the whole game. the hit its self is suspension worthy. the hit could of knocked Gorges on consious. what trew me off if no Hab players went over to Gauthier to knock some sense into him!|`|hMo9z0TSaa	He got a game miss conduct, I think he should get atleast a 5 day suspension|`|ZcGq6Mjfaa	The refs should be suspended for the way they officiated this game|`|N1OnviExaa	Yeah, it was pretty cheap.

l4WEwTWwaa	I agree with you one hundred and ten percent. Chad Dawson does seem to be ducking this guy and even vacated his title just to avoid fighting him. He so blatently ducked him I'm surprised the guy hasn't called him out. Next Abraham-Pavlik is a fight I've been praying for for two years. They both own the middleweight division and this fight would not also be a fan favorite, but it is necessary too. Next Ivan Calderon is a great fighter but I feel that he has not been challenged by a real opponent. He has no power and therefore has to rely on slick boxing and I would love to see him match that against a guy like Asloum.

4c479c9c27bebd404d7ba657763fe54faa	Delap was right to be sent off for lashing out with intent but SWP really should've went as well for that kick afterwards. Such a cowardly move from Shawn! It was absolutely pathetic that SWP got off with nothing, not even a yellow|`|5c0ea2e937929dc820b4f96293aa83a2aa	Delap was a complete muppet..... But SWP should have had a yellow for the little kick back|`|UZUl0vG8aa	It was right for delap to get sent off even though he was proveked SWP should of gona off right behind him|`|3638ecbacff09303c04d9f60a89e841baa	SWP should have got a red what a disgrace he is not fit to have the surname Wright... good he wasn't given a yellow now the panel can give him a red instead.|`|OYYYNCyCaa	the FA should review this match and then SWP should be suspended for his disgraceful act|`|4BppP7Mkaa	I haven't seen the incident yet but from what i heard he should  of been sent off.|`|Rds4eGIyaa	They both should have been sent off. Delap for his obvious lashing out and SWP also for his petulant kick. The commentator said it was reminiscent of the Beckham kick on Simeone in 98, which he was rightly sent off for, and I have to agree.|`|dKi2R2oHaa	Wright-Phillips deserved a yellow,  a red would have been harsh.  The referee does have discretion not to give a red, although he would have lost some brownie points for it.    Delap certainly deserved to be sent off.  His actions were premeditated and dangerous.|`|6KZA7D97aa	respect ot delap for having passion for his team/team mates. swp should have got a yellow|`|m2zXOREJaa	Look at Shawns tackle,not once did he connect with ball or player,then Delap runs up the back of his heel and cleans him out so 1-Delap should have been shown a Red 2-Phillips should have been shown a yellow 3 -Stoke awarded a freekick which they were,so overall the ref was spot on apart from SWPs Yellow.
a9f693c71e4b465afcc9a6b377b02694aa	The Washington Capitals last year set a record for overcoming the largest deficit (17 points) to make the playoffs, so they are the answer.    To the first responder,   The year they were 2-11-2, they were still ahead of the Winnipeg Jets at that point in the season, and they didn't win the cup that year (90-91) but did make it to the semi-final round (losing to Minnesota).    Tfoley, Edmonton was never below 0.500 after game 13 in 2005-06, Here is Jarret Stoll's game by game log for that year, notice all the Oiler wins early in the season (8-6-1 after 15 games)?  http://sports.yahoo.com/nhl/players/2528...

If you are getting it for adults and want the best possible ball, get wilson's "the duke"  However those balls are not as durable as a synthetic ball because the duke is make out of high quality leather.  I suggest getting a Nike ball, those last a really long time and I like the feel.  Rawlings and Wilson also make balls out of the same type of material, those are good too.|`|0BgzkLdUaa	lmfao, as if there are any professional football players using YA|`|nqdDe3cJaa	Wilsons "The Duke" is the official football of the NFL.|`|tEW4SjBnaa	Wilson makes a great football i perfer the college grade over the NFL type don't waste your money on a nike football.
TeNIStN1aa	Haha... good one.    Carp DO eat everything. They just won't eat everything all year round. There are times when they prefer a nice piece of steak, spam or a chunk of bacon. There are times when they prefer vegetarian diet with little or no oil. And, there are also times when they chase down and eat small fish.    Bigger carp will eat small fish around this time of the year. Around my area, they will feed on small fish until around mid March. Small fish is a hit or miss bait because it will work only if there are bigger fish around. They will feed on small fish again later in Fall.     Oil is not your friend when the water is still cold. Greasy stuff works much better during warmer months. When underwater vegetation is blooming, vegetarian baits usually won't stand out. Scents will help in this case but there is a catch. It will work much better on smaller carp. Scents do attract bigger carp to the area but those big ones usually don't take scented baits. You will need to figure out a way to use attractants effectively (and legally). Like Bassplayer stated, carp prefer natural foods. You can get away with some artificial colorings and scents but I would try to stay away from them as much as possible.    I used to search the web for carp baits. I found a lot of those baits won't work for me. After years of trial and error, I realized many of those baits are seasonal and/or only works locally. There are some common mistakes in a lot of those recipes. Many people love scents too much. Many people love to dump in too many different ingredients. Many people failed to realize you need different baits depending on water temperature.     Let me personify carp a little like you did. Well, let us be carp for a while to be exact. If you are a carp preparing dinner, would you like to have the exact same spices on all of your foods everyday? Would you want your foods to have a lot of different exotic, unknown spices on them?  Will you eat foods made with a dazzling array of ingredients that don't seem to blend too well together? If you are young and curious or adventurous, you might  want to try those kind of stuff just to have a taste. If you are fortunate enough to be exposed to those kind of stuff the 2nd time (ie: released to live another day), it is very likely that you will remember and avoid those foods. If you are an old fart to begin with, you probably have developed a preference on foods already. In this case, some changes and variations might be good as long as they are not excessive. Preparing carp bait is very similar to cooking. A lot of ingredients are common but how you prepare them will make a world of difference. Carp baits are very scientific and there should be a good reason behind every ingredient. Bait fishing for carp is the ultimate bait fishing.    PS: Please do forgive me for not sharing my cold water bait recipes. I only gave you the concept behind my baits for I do not wish to ruin your joy of discovery.  PPS: There is a good chance that you are missing a lot of bites because you failed to detect them. Carp could be very light biters. May I recommend old fashion ultra sensitive quill floats. Tight lines.|`|h2KkiKK3aa	you are an idiot and you should remove this stupid question before we do.|`|q8dX0MsNaa	he's still here. or at least his new/newest/other one is. l tried to tell you that they were vegetarians and preferred natural foods but NOOO, you had to go pick someone else and give him best answer. now you'll just have to live with it. l hope they sue your pants off. they should get you for littering with all those bits of unnatural non-biodegradable fishing rod also.    but l'll give you one more chance. besides, l need more best answers to get to the next level of semi-conciousness. that or another beer.      Hey! wait a minnit! do you honestly expect me to believe a 5'5" carp jumped out of the south branch of the raritan river and shrieked at you?    l know way better than that. the raritan river doesn't have a south branch. everyone knows only trees have branches|`|YczLYtWjaa	quit using drugs would be a good start because if you are seeing talking carp you are on some really good drugs|`|933YqFLNaa	you shouldn't be mixing beer with the carp bait it could really cause some issues as demonstrated here!!   That old Milwaukee beer really packs a punch...|`|2bqmotqlaa	use bread dough|`|Ok3XlTV3aa	Dude you just wasted ten minutes of your life describing to us one of your acid trips when you were fishing.  You need to get a girlfriend or something to occupy your time.      By the way saying a carp eats anything is a hyperbole because carp are considered a "trash fish."
bvnzv923aa	Don't worry about your height. I am 5'9". I still skate, and have been for over 8 1/2 years! A good weight would just be the average weight for your height.   And those jumps? They really are very different.     Lutz - a backwards toe-jump. Pretty much, you glide backwards and then you put your toe in the ice and spring up off of your toe.    http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CA4R0zchx...      Salchow- an edge jump. What you do is you do a slower 3 turn and hold the last edge for a split second longer. Then you just jump off of your flat foot, no toe to help you out.    http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ypxp1Z4db...      Loop - another edge jump. This one you start off backwards and hold an edge with both feet on the ground. You spring up -once again- off of a flat foot.     http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cq_8V8MjC...      Axel - One of the most difficult jumps. An axel, you start off forwards and land backwards. Which means a single axel is 1.5 revolutions, a double is 2.5 etc. It is yet again another edge jump, this time you take off forwards.The skater steps forward on a striat line and kicks their leg. When they kick (not really kick, I just couldn't think of a better word...) their leg infront, Theyre getting enough power to get off the ice and in the air, just from kicking their leg.     http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v2ji5zTCO...    As far as buying skates goes, I wouldn't go with Reidell. They messed up my feet and several of my friends'. I have been an SP Teri customer for a long time now and am so very happy with them. Look on the website of the brand you want to get and they will have a description of the skate models, i.e. "For recreational use and beginners" type of thing. It will also tell you about what level those skates are made for. WARNING: Skates cost a lot and so does pretty much every other aspect of skating.   1/2 an hr of private lesson time seems to run an average of about $20 dollars. 1/2 hr of ice time alone is normally around $6ish dollars for a freestyle. If I were you, I'd skate about 2 hrs a week minimum once I start to really learn stuff. Group lessons can run around $50 for a session (or more, as with all of these prices). Skates cost $100-$700 dollars (for most people, depends on what level you are at) and blades cost a lot too. Competition dresses cost around $100 at least, usually more. Then you'd need basics like, a skating bag (a suitcase works), a towel to dry your skates, a screw driver, Hard blade covers, soft "soakers" blade covers. All of those things total cost at least $100 (because of the bag...)   Level to level depends on the person. It took me a while, and other people just blew right through them (although generally, they do not look as confident/stable/graceful doing those moves as people who took their time). Just go at a speed that you're comfy with, it'll be better in the long run.  Hope that it all works out for you|`|8qpvfL1kaa	Lutz:  A jump where the skater glides backwards on the back outside edge of one foot (left foot for counterclockwise skaters), picks with the toe on the other foot, rotates in the air and lands on the picking foot. It has to take off from the outside edge because otherwise it's called a "flutz".     Salchow:  A jump where the skater takes off from the back inside edge of one foot (left foot for counterclockwise skaters), scoops up and lands on the other foot.    Loop:  Takes off from the back outside edge of the right foot for counterclockwise skaters and lands on the same foot.    Axel:  This is easily distinguished from the other jumps because this takes off by going forwards. The (counterclockwise) skater takes off from the left forward outside edge and lands on the right back outside edge.    Skates are an extremely personal issue. One person may hate Riedells, for example, but those might fit you the best. You should go to a professional skate shop and have people measure your feet. The skates have to fit *you* comfortably. Beginners' skates usually cost less than $100.    The costs of skating depend on your rink and how much you do with it. Check with your rink ^_^    It also depends on each person on how long it takes to go from level to level, and also which level it is. For example, I did one level in a week but took sixteen weeks to do other levels. It really depends.    A good weight would be a healthy weight for your height. You can still be fine with skating even if you're tall.    I'm sure there's plenty of sites on the internet or books you can find that may answer additional questions. You can also go to your local rink and talk to some people there.|`|u1XPgNJ4aa	Hi! First of all, Im glad that you have such an interest in skating, and I think that it would be great if you got into it. I have been skating for 10 years now, so Id be happy to tell you about it! The lutz, salchow, loop, and axel are all fairly different, and it is hard to explain them all in words. My advice would be to get a kind of picture book on skating, which will show you what you want to know. The most basic jump is the waltz jump, and then comes the salchow and the toe loop. There are many good brands of figure skates, but my personal favorites are Riedel and Super Teri. The type of skates that you personally should get is determined by what level you are in, and, for example, what jumps and spins you are doing. It can be fairly expensive to do this sport, but how much it costs is determined by a few factors: how much ice time you go to, if you get private lessons, and how much your skates cost. To find good skates, try to go to a professional skate shop. They can fit you for free, and then you can either find a good deal online for yourself, or just order skates from there. To get from level to level, it can take anywhere from 1 month to a year! It totally depends on how much time you put in, and your prior skills. Also, some levels are easier than others. I hope I helped you learn a little bit more about figure skating! Good luck :-)|`|OFQoL7H9aa	hi i luv your interest in skating!  well here are the jumps:  FLIP: can enter from a Mohawk or 3 turn. 1 revelution   http://www.ehow.com/video_2350207_the-fl... and thats entering from a 3 turn    AXEL: 1.5 revolutions around.. normally entering from back crossovers.  http://www.ehow.com/video_2350209_the-ax...    LUTZ: comes from crossovers almost like a flip but if you look closely you can see the toe pick doesn't reach to the side of the skater but directly behind the skater...  http://www.ehow.com/video_2350208_the-lu...    SALCHOW:not much to say about this but...  http://www.ehow.com/video_2350213_the-sa...    LOOP: it's like a backspin in the air....takes off of the right foot.   http://www.ehow.com/video_2350205_the-lo...    TOE LOOP: one of the easiest jumps!   http://www.ehow.com/video_2350206_the-to...    ummm.....im not sure of the price it depends on how much your getting into it if you skate 3 days a week for a month minimum is at least 100 dollars a month...but totally worth it. And going level to level depends on how much you practice them. And what the elements in that level are! And also how much you've skated before.  Best of luck  hope i helped
a6EndAPiaa	Not really.  I am not too sure about Ralph Wilson.  But the fact that he got in and Taglibue did not tells me that the voters probably made the right choice.    Shannon Sharpe is way to much of a blow-hard ego maniac to get in on the first ballot and I am very glad he did not get in (although he will eventually).    Russ Grimm should have been in on his first ballot and he has *still* not made it which I just do not understand.  The voters seem to have a pathological hatred of former Redskins (Monk should not have needed 8 year to get in for example).    Derrick Thomas finally got in another one which was long overdue.    I can not make strong arguments about any of the people who did get voted in not being in though.|`|KNTofuxMaa	I pretty much agree with the selections.    It's about time we got another Cowboy from the 70's there with Bob Hayes.    Derrick Thomas is beloved in Alabama and we are proud to have another member of the HoF a Bama Player.     Bruce Smith is as deserving as any candidate.     I was on the fence with Woodson.    Randall McDaniel was a beast.

He is the best TE of all time and why is Cris Carter is not in yet. I think he is one of the 5 best WR ever|`|lnHX0ETAaa	Not necessarily the picks, more the process.    Players should be eligible for only a period of time. 5 to 10 years after they retire, then its done. If you don't know right away, then they most likely don't deserve to be in.    I also think there needs to be some set guidelines, amount of yards, touchdowns, sacks, which would put you in automatically.

fCenYPLgaa	1. Jealousy  2. Mean  3. just for the heck of it.  People are always saying things about the celebrities, especially soccer players. Their fans are like crazy for them. They think that Critizicing other players will-maybe-make them to have a bad game, so it doesn't work really good because it's coming from both sides. Example:  C. Ronaldo and Rooney. Both are great players, good players...;b  but here comes the crazy fans and start saying brutal things to their opponent, "just look at c.ronaldo he has only the looks"...while other fans say, "poor rooney he could be a great player but who would like to mate with him?"

7rpILeYtaa	i would either have to pick between:      The Fabulous Moolah, who on her first title run, and first time the WWF Womens Championship title started, held it for 10 years. and held the title for a combined reign of 30 years, over 8 reigns.      Pedro Morales, who had only one world title reign but held that title for 1027 days. and was actually the first ever Triple Crown Champion      WQ. yes i would like to see Punk vs Taker  that would make quite and interesting match, with Taker being a striker and with the Muay thai kick boxing background of Punk.  it would be a great match, high flying moves from Punk and huge striking moves from Taker|`|24253948712de5dd1f43afb45a3a6dcbaa	Vince McMahon|`|09YK9Zboaa	Bret Hart in 97 when he got kicked out of the United States and eventually the WWE... in that feud was HBK, The Undertaker, and Bret Hart, it was a great title run    **No not at the moment CM Punk has not done anything wrong for The Undertaker to condemn his soul and deem him necessary to be sent to the fires of hell..

You have to Admit (Whether you love Him Or Hate Him) , that in the Modern Era , there has never Been a Longer Reigning Champ than Cena.     He Was the Longest reigning Champ in 19 Years.  The only person to Hold the title for over a year since Randy Savage I believe. (Correct Me if I'm Wrong).    And with "The Marine" , Promoting , Signings , Make-A-Wish , & Everything else that comes with Just Being a WWE Superstar - Not to mention the Champion , Cena has to be at the top of this List.    This is just My Opinion though.      BQ - Hell Yeah.  That'd be a Great Match.  Best Pure Striker vs. Punk's Muy Thai  Kick Boxing Background -   Awesomeness.

WrDGhduxaa	You can not move all of your weight onto your hands.  You should be balanced with the majority of weight on your hands so you do not sit back.  Something about 60% is usually thought to be about right.   If the front knee is about 90 degrees and the rear knee is about 150 degrees, your shoulders are over your hands, the back is straight the rear end is higher than the shoulders, your hands are only slightly wider than your shoulders, then you are in a good position.

4284e409c8e26999c7eb4ffd92352976aa	I think that for this year, it's just going to be Macho Man who will represent the WWF from that era in the Hall of Fame.Stone Cold will be representing the Attitude Era and The Funks will be representing other times that include the NWA promotion.I think WWE will want to cover as many eras as possible with the Hall of Fame inductees for the 25th anniversary of Wrestlemania.|`|F3VjJAdiaa	the rumor has always been that macho man was "messing" around with stephanie mcmahon. and that is why vince will never put him in the HOF.

26Wly05Maa	since when has John Kirwan come from the Pacific Islands    I'd have to go for Brian Williams (on whats been said about how he carved up in South Africa) Vai inga Tuigamala and Jonah Lomu while the current crop are good all blacks these guys had the x factor and did things no one else could|`|pYHtBxn3aa	im young (20) so my choices are players that i have seen play, cant really judge any player who retired before the 90's    Jeff Wilson  Jonah Lomu  John Kirwan|`|UYVqIISoaa	Beegee Williams, Jonah Lomu, Joe Rocokoco (sp?)|`|U9Jrt9MFaa	In reply to your question, how can JK be in the list, He was born in the North Island after all.  How can you compare say Billy Wallace to Grant Batty to BeeGee to Inga to Bernie to JK to Lonah to Tana, (Is Tana classed as a wing or centre?) different players different styles yet all class|`|O7dtwL3Maa	JK would head the list followed by Beegee and the last between Goldie and Jonah. Jonah was good on attack but didnt look for work and was dodgy under the low ball, chips etc yeah he was the most devastating thing on two legs on attack but hey there's far more to being the top winger than attack. Now more so than ever.    HOWEVER...    Top memory of Jonah was stomping on Mike Katt  Top memory of Beegee was his reliabilty and durabilty over years  Top memory of JK was the Italian try in the 1987 world cup  Unfortunately Goldies is that Gregan tackle    Jonah number 3|`|5cyFGDOdaa	EASY!    1.

Sorry, Bernie you miss out 'cause your phone no starts with 04!!|`|hs3wumXpaa	VIC P - Islanders who play for the AB's are classed as NZ born Samoans, Tongans, etc.... the indigenous people of the land are the Maori's.    Speaking as a NZ born Samoan, Islanders never forget our roots or our heritage....what you call ethinicity, just because we are born here doesn't mean that we forsake our blood ties.     We enjoy the advantages of being in NZ but never for one moment do we think we are white, maybe we see ourselves as Kiwi's - all this regardless of the education and trappings living in a westernised country brings us so we take it and exploit it just like you do.    Bee Gee, Inga and Jonah|`|4tNmMHYpaa	Bryan Williams  Stu Wilson  John Kirwin    Jonah never ever scored a single try aganist South Africa.|`|cRUb1xSmaa	vaaiga tuigamala  jonah lomu  joe rocothoco|`|nJcMFW0Oaa	I agree with some of the answers already given;  BG  Lomu  Rokocoko|`|Qq2MKeXUaa	BG Williams  Bernie Fraser  Jonah Lomu|`|0xfVyxxIaa	Bryan Williams  Bernie Fraser  John Kerwin.

By these lights, John Kirwan would be a British winger.|`|ekjZnu9daa	Define All Black Island winger as New Zealand is a Pacific Island Nation,Maori's and those of European decent born,bred and raised in NZ, are Pacific Islanders,it can be anyone including Grant Batty,Bryan Williams,John Timu,John Kirwan,Terry Wright,Mike Clamp,Bernie Fraser,Vai'inga Tuigamala,Doug Howlett,Joeli Vidiri,Craig Green the list is endless interesting question though,think deeply before you reply,on the world map NZ is in the South Pacific|`|OFSby06faa	Yeah, you're all getting a little anal and technical here.  You're all right, New Zealand could technically be defined as an island in the Pacific Ocean.    In real world terms and rugby terms (the Pacific Island Barbarians) New Zealand isn't really taken into consideration when thinking of the Pacific Islands.  When I fill out any official documents and Census forms I am a New Zealander that fills out that I am a "Pacific Islander" by ethnicity.    You can argue all you want and you'll be right.  The reality is that no one really refers to New Zealand in the same terms as the "Pacific Islands."  I've travelled around the world and that view seems to hold true.    My top three are:    1)  Jonah Lomu - dominated the sport.  He was the biggest name in the game during his time in the sun.  He had glaring faults but was devastating with the ball in hand.    2)  Bryan Williams - Like Jonah he took the world by storm with his good looks and natural flare he had for the game.      3)  Josevata Rokocoko - Jo took the 7's world by storm and is now terrorising oppositions in the 15 a side game.  Given space it's hard for tacklers to even get a hand on him.    NOTE - There's a Tongan, a Samoan and a Fijian in there.|`|3mMElwb0aa	Jonah  Joe Roko  Tuigamala    Williams had one real tour of brillaince as a19 yr old in South Africa and could not count as a great.

BTFFpdeOaa	I just put a BSA 3-12x40mm sweet 17 on my savage 93R17 and the instructions say to sight it in at 100 yards.The windage and elevation drums equal 1/4 inch per click at 100 yards,so if you are shooting 3 inches high and 4 inches right for example, then you will need to turn your windage drum 16 clicks left and your elevation drum 12 clicks down. Once you are sighted in,take the three set screws loose on the elevation drum with the allen wrench that should have come with your scope and set it back to the 100 yard mark.As for the yardage markings on the front of the scope,thats called the parallax ring.If your target is 100 yards away set the ring at 100 yards or your reticle will show what looks like apparent movement against a stationary target.

The Steelers' offense can take a while to show its potential along with the fact that Hines Ward, no matter what he says, is not above 90%. Their defense is amazing, though.    Verdict= Cardinals! (Great Offense > Great Defense)
L77OlY1naa	Billy "freakin" Wagner|`|KdhNCnEjaa	Jason Varitek|`|gVYfFSpRaa	I don't think any player on the Phillies is overrated, but if I had to pick one, I guess I'd say Howard.    edit:  Honestly, I don't know why I answer opinion questions anymore because I get crap about every answer I give.  Sure, Howard's a great player.  But he also struck out 200 times and isn't exactly the world's greatest first baseman.  And I'd trade homers for average or OBP any day. Sorry that my opinion is different from yours Bert and whoever else said that.  I really truly am sorry.|`|M0eyMvqlaa	I'm not aware of an overrated player on my team.

(like Reyes, Wright & Carlos Beltran)|`|XxG9SqYoaa	It's not hard at all. Derek Jeter|`|Kh4p4gPXaa	Before last season it was Rios,  but right now,  its Lyle Overbay.    The guy is hyped as a doubles machine,  but he led the league in Grounding into Double Plays last year and he tends to come up with nothing but outs in key situations.|`|g9P7oWyeaa	For me, Ellsbury is teeny tiny bit overrated, he is slump prone very often and needs to improve his power.|`|0yB3ZKFRaa	Red Sox fan here and I would say Diasuke..I find him to be very average|`|BjXiGRVYaa	Carlo Beltron|`|AA11519561	Prince Fielder|`|E6EyY1klaa	I am going to say...as of right now, Xavier Nady. Don't get me wrong. He's a very good player. It's just he had such a nice start with the Yanks that a lot of fans are giving him a tad more credit than he deserves. I mean, I think he only hit like .268 when he was with us last season. But his attitude/way he plays the game makes up for it in my eyes. 2nd place for most overrated? Derek Jeter. Still a first-ballot HOFer, just seems to be able to get away with anything and no one criticizes him (alright, almost no one). And I'm not talking about his hitting skills alone. He is a great hitter. But his CLUTCH hitting is overrated, and so are his skills at being a good captain. Tek is a much better captain to me than DJ.     Most underrated: Johnny Damon.    Lieutenant: Yeah, I know he hit like .250 with RISP last year, and he never seems to come up with the clutch hit, but due to this, a lot of people "rate" him where he deserves to be rated: not in the elite. He is not overrated in my eyes, because most people know he chokes. It isn't like Jeter where everyone thinks he's so clutch. That is why I consider Jeter more overrated than A-Rod. As more and more seasons happen where A-Rod fails to hit in the postseason or hits .250 with RISP (like last year), the more of a joke a lot of people consider him (as harsh as that sounds): Pure stats, unable to hit when it counts. I really hope he turns it around this year, but you can't tell me there's too many Yankee fans who want him up when it counts. Most Yankee fans would rather see Jeter at the plate, and he, regardless of any "stats" people whip out, is better, but not the BEST Yankee (or even close), in the clutch. He's had a some clutch playoff hits. He's also had a few horrendous postseasons and series (most notably the 2004 ALCS). Jeter has a high playoff average, but it isn't like he hasn't had his fair share of failures, as well. To me, they're both great players, but that's about it.|`|nqdDe3cJaa	Derek Lee is the most over rated player in baseball.  take away that one monster season he had a few years back and he is nothing more than a 20 and 90 guy over the other 9 years he played in MLB.  it doesnt matter that he did nothing special in 9 of his 10 seasons .... people for some odd reason think hes a stud because of one good year.    Ryan Howard is OVER rated ???????? he leads ALL major leaguers in HRs and RBIs over the past 3 seasons and hes OVER rated ??????? LORDY !!!!!!|`|B5BWocvZaa	jeremy guthrie|`|8Rep9De6aa	As a Cardinals fan, I'd say Kyle Lohse. He had one good season with the Cardinals and got a fat contract for it. The most underrated has got to be Skip Schumaker. Not a lot of speed but hits for average, decent OBP, and a solid fielder.|`|0pbQg0Ohaa	Big Papi but he is coming back from a wrist injury|`|dhs9QBMoaa	Lyle Overbay, which says two things.  A)  Lyle Overbay is overrated.  B)  There isn't much to shout about here in Toronto.  We have Halladay, Wells and Rios (and Ryan when he's healthy)...that's about it.  It's going to be a long year.|`|1TooRFX2aa	Alex Rodriguez =P|`|1I38E3XQaa	clay bucholz.  no one knew his stuff, he had tek behind the plate, and had  a good game, causing a no-hitter. who cares, he sucked in 08|`|4MuRyVXwaa	I would have to say it was Trevor Hoffman, but we just let him go.|`|ad3M8wViaa	A-Rod.

I see some people saying DLee here.  Since when is 20 HR's and 90 RBI's consistntly a bad thing.  His major decline offensively came when he injured his wrist and as any baseball player knows the wrist is a major part of a players swing.  DLee is not overrated in my eyes because of his consistency offensively and his phenominal defensive play.  In my eyes he's a top 3 DEFENSIVE 1st baseman.|`|Y4rI1v5vaa	george sherrill.  o's should have traded him last year, he's not a closer.

VleVKhyhaa	If the wheels are truly 'sticky' to the touch, something is badly wrong with them. I suspect that the skates are very old and have been kept in he heat of a car trunk or the like. Extreem heat makes the wheels deteriorate quickly. Most likely all you need is some new wheels and perhaps bearings for the wheels if they have become contaminated too. I would not recommend you skate on them as they sound really dangerous at this point!

I would rather see HBK vs Taker though|`|OHBvEYKHaa	because of the economy storyline no its going to be umaga vs undertaker or undertaker vs koslov|`|26fb51ead612e7006829de7144c65343aa	Everyone including myself would like to see Taker and HBK go at it 1 more time however WWE would have to come up with a storyline to begin a fued with those two because they are in different brands    i think HBK might end up facing JBL and Undertaker might end up facing the undefeated Kozlov at Mania|`|fU4b37pnaa	Well, if John Bradshaw Layfield  does'nt let Shawn Michaels fight against the Phenom, it's JBL's own fault unless if he did that to HBK. so it would be Chris Jericho vs. The Undertaker @ Wrestlemania 25.|`|0P40aUA0aa	Rumour are all liars    no|`|YgVtCX3raa	Maybe the big show.|`|D8a0X3oAaa	HBK might be facing JBL.

Pittsburgh Steelers (12-4)    Time: 6:30 EST  Date: February 1, 2009  Stadium: Raymond James Stadium  City: Tampa, Florida  Favorite: Steelers by 7  National anthem: Jennifer Hudson  Coin toss: Roger Craig, John Elway and Lynn Swann  Referee: Terry McAulay  Halftime show: Bruce Springsteen and the E Street Band  Network: NBC  Announcers: Al Michaels and John Madden  Cost of 30-second commercial: $3 million      Super Bowl XLIII, an American football game that will decide the National Football League (NFL) champion for the 2008 season, is scheduled to be played on February 1, 2009, with kickoff at 6:20 PM Eastern Time (23:20 GMT), at Raymond James Stadium in Tampa, Florida.    It will feature the American Football Conference champion Pittsburgh Steelers (14-4) and the National Football Conference champion Arizona Cardinals (12-7) . Of historical note, this game matches up two franchises previously merged into a single team (Card-Pitt) for the 1944 season in response to the depleted rosters during World War II. Pittsburgh will be going for its sixth Super Bowl win, which would place it in sole possession of the record for most Super Bowl wins, while the Cardinals are seeking their first league title since 1947 and only the second undisputed league championship in their history. It is the third Super Bowl in history to feature two pre-expansion era (pre-1960) teams, joining Super Bowl XIV (Steelers vs. Los Angeles Rams) and Super Bowl XLI (Indianapolis Colts vs. Chicago Bears). It will be also the first time that two quarterbacks who previously started for a Super Bowl winning team (Kurt Warner and Ben Roethlisberger) will oppose one another since Jim Plunkett's Los Angeles Raiders defeated Joe Theisman's Washington Redskins in Super Bowl XVIII.    The seeds of Super Bowl XLIII can be traced back to the end of the 2006 season. After winning Super Bowl XL in 2005, the Pittsburgh Steelers had dropped to a 8-8 record the following year. At the end of 2006, Bill Cowher ended his 15-year tenure as their head coach, leaving with a 149-90-1 record and a 12-9 record in the playoffs. Offensive coordinator Ken Whisenhunt and assistant head coach Russ Grimm were widely considered the front-runners to succeed Cowher in Pittsburgh. However, without waiting to see if Pittsburgh would hire him, Whisenhunt accepted the head coaching job with the Arizona Cardinals, a team that held the second longest championship drought in U.S. sports (1947, with only the Chicago Cubs last winning their championship in 1908) and had never advanced to the Super Bowl in their franchise history. The Steelers then passed over Grimm and instead hired Minnesota Vikings defensive coordinator Mike Tomlin. Once Tomlin was hired by the Steelers, Grimm joined Whisenhunt in Arizona in the same position as assistant head coach as he had in Pittsburgh.    Journey will perform during the pre-game show, and Jennifer Hudson will sing "The Star-Spangled Banner" in her first public appearance since the murder of her nephew, brother and mother. Hudson becomes the second consecutive alumna from the American Idol television series to perform the national anthem at a Super Bowl (Jordin Sparks sang the anthem at Super Bowl XLII).  The NFL will salute four decades of champions during the coin toss ceremony and the Vince Lombardi Trophy presentation. The coin toss will feature Roger Craig (Super Bowl XXIII, 1989), John Elway (Super Bowl XXXIII, 1999) and Lynn Swann (Super Bowl XIII, 1979). Roger Craig follows last year's participants and fellow San Francisco 49ers Craig Walsh (son of Bill Walsh), Ronnie Lott, Jerry Rice and Steve Young. Joe Namath (Super Bowl III, 1969) will participate in the Vince Lombardi Trophy presentation and he previously participated in the coin toss in Super Bowl XXVIII.  The Super Bowl XLIII halftime show, sponsored by Bridgestone, will feature Bruce Springsteen and the E Street Band.|`|j8FHQf5Xaa	Nope, the Superbowl  has been canceled. The realized with the large amount of fans who can not use Google, Yahoo, or any of the dozens of search engines to find out when the game is being held. They called it off.

r27M5SnNaa	I've been upset about the whole Matt hitting Jeff with a chair thing since it happened Sunday at the Royal Rumble. (which by the way, I was there). Although right now he's saying there won't be any more Hardy Boyz, I'm sure sometime in the future they will team up again.|`|09YK9Zboaa	The hardy boyz will be back eventually but over all smackdown was disappointing they are taking way too long to set up these story lines, this episode sucked honestly, and second they are screwing up completely by not giving triple h any sort of story line at all|`|eysDi4rIaa	Haha... I wasn't at all... things change in wrestling all the time and in real life I am sure they have brotherly love. It keeps their characters more interesting...|`|5JQFCQCkaa	Well, it's like the Khali Kiss-Cam. Do you seriously believe that it is going to go on forever?|`|az5NtgN6aa	I DO I LOVE THE HARDYBOYS|`|de14HtA9aa	They've split up as far as the storylines have gone before.  Remember when it was the Hardy's and Lita together?  Than Matt turned against his brother and started calling himself version 1.0 or something like that.  I'm sure they will get back together again at some point and time again.
0Dm3WEMcaa	They need the PPV's but they also need more time to build better feuds instead of rushing them into a big match at a PPV. I think they should return to having Smackdown/ Raw exclusive PPV's because that opens up the lower PPV card to matches that are currently stuck on weekly shows. US/IC and Tag titles would get more chance to shine and gives the writers more time to put more into the big feuds. Jericho and HBK last year didn't feel rushed but the matches happened at 4+ PPV's and they had some PPV's with just talking segments. More time to build story's and give the lower card more chance to shine would benefit more aspects of the WWE.|`|26fb51ead612e7006829de7144c65343aa	possibly, they would have more time to build up the feuds. it was better when the Brands PPV were seperated and Raw and Smackdown had there own PPV every other month and they would come together for Survivor Series, Mania, Summerslam, the big ones basically|`|D8a0X3oAaa	More time to build up rivalries.|`|H7p09fL2aa	well at least if they had some payperviews for raw and some for smackdown  example:backlash was raw and judgement day was smackdown  and they had the big four to be for all brands|`|rJMZdp04aa	No.  That would actually make it Worse.    Remember how long those 6 Weeks between Armageddon & The Royal Rumble are?  Not to Mention the 6-8 Weeks between No Way Out & WrestleMania.    Less PPV's would Actually make the Storylines Duller & MORE Boring.    PPV's are there for a Reason - Storyline Advancement & Build Up.  Usually with some Stip. and/or Gimmick Matches.    Personally , I think there needs to be 1 More PPV in the Calendar.  Either between Arm. & RR , or between NWO & WM.
H3nbC71eaa	1995 to me was the worst. That one HBK went coast to coast from  1 and won the match....but that's not what made it the worst.    What made it the worst was that the wrestlers were coming in at 1 minute intervals..instead of a minute and a half or 2 minutes. This made the whole Royal Rumble match last a little over a half hour only.    That's really the only one I really didn't like, I guess I'll go with 2008's when Cena returned also.|`|0P40aUA0aa	i agree with you|`|az5NtgN6aa	1st and 2009 j|`|6ahTfnVuaa	I don't like obvious Royal Rumbles.     For example - 1995, 2006, 2008, and 2009    Glad to be back|`|Be6HpTuoaa	happy to see you back rock  to answer your question i thought 2005-2009 it's not that i didn't like batista or ortan but just the ending was not spectacular|`|cBCVfzPVaa	2000 and 2008 were my two favorites. The WWE ALWAYS puts on a memorable show when they host from Madison Square Garden. They never fail to disappoint in that arena, IMO. The three that completely bombed IMO was 1998/1999 (tie) and 2006.|`|bRGdkOwqaa	i couldnt agree with you more
LLVg3bSTaa	try to impress them .  it should work .  start doing things they cant do .buy clothes that are cutter than theres     if you need more help ask me , i went through all of that , when i impressed them  they started hanging with me     Good Luck ;]|`|jPNptBtOaa	Don't try to be someone you're not. Be yourself. Just because you're not best friends with everyone on your team doesn't mean that's a problem! Its good to have friends outside of your team.    Prove to other people that not all cheerleaders are snobby and judge others. Be yourself and let other people see that cheerleaders can be nice, and accepting of others!|`|VTLQ4uHDaa	Find some common ground. Things you and the other cheerleaders are intrested in.  And if they are acting snobby stand up for the others!
WkpOrF64aa	It's possible that he could be a star, he seems to have plenty of talent.    It's way, way, way, way, way to early to start talking about him being a Hall of Famer.|`|uRGjwIvuaa	No Hall of Famer. He'll be a solid player though. Possibly an All-Star in a few years. Might be better than Bogut.|`|PbrGLvonaa	He is actually a slightly slower and less range gamed Tim Duncan... he'll be a star if he moves faster and adds more range game|`|AA10215715	He will be a future star, but I am not sure about him entering the NBA Hall of Fame.|`|LGLnItBcaa	star- yes  hall of fame- too early to tell|`|vuh0i3Axaa	maybe star, maybe hall of famer,too young to tell right now.

OCf7y5FKaa	You will be fine! Chances are that the younger children will look up to you, ask you questions and what-not! No-one will laugh at you because you're older, they will probably ask you how old you are etc.. Children aska lot of questions thoughh. Just Enjoy the sport!  If you don't feel comfortable with younger company, ask to move groups (after you've trained a while) or get friendly with your instructor. While not 'having your go' on the apparatus, you could be called upon to assist with helping them.. IDK if you have teen-coaches (like me, at my gym) but Remember your instructor is only human and would probably appreciate the attention. You could lead the warm-up or (like my gym) take little-ones to the bathroom.  Do not fret about starting Gymnastics at your age because, although younger people are said to be more flexible, the truth is that everyone could theoretically achieve the same flexibility with correct stretches and practice.  I sincerely hope you enjoy Gymnastics because it is fantastic!  ENJOY ENJOY ENJOY:-)|`|5yTnGALCaa	It's okay. There is a girl who just started at my gym and she trains with the older kids. Maybe you will too. Doesn't really matter what other people think. I'm  6 1 and I stick out. Just try your hardest!|`|n2O0NwR6aa	Yes, you'll be fine!  No one is going to point and laugh and say, "Look how old she is!"  Instead, the younger girls will look up to you!  You'll be a leader in the class.  And because of your maturity, chances are you'll progress more quickly than the younger girls.  It won't take long for you to move up to the next level, where there will probably be more girls your age.  Good luck, and have fun!  =)|`|SRvOO3M6aa	yes you will.|`|yz06jQrJaa	u will b fine. here is some encouragement, u'll prob. b able 2 move up levels faster becuz ur older and have more concentration (plus u don't have someone ur age 2 distract u)
T13xM9iJaa	Yes it was I was laughing the whole night about that one|`|XNbKc7Rzaa	Cena can be good and his older promos (2003-5) were gold but i think he got arrogant and his promos from 06 onwards were just terrible, shouting promos but the one he cut on Vicki wasn't actually that bad.|`|OfNTLq3Qaa	I'm not a big Cena fan but I will admit that was a good promo for Cena.|`|sqfjfR3iaa	Yes, that was a good zinger. I can't wait to hear John Cena rip on them some more on Smackdown.|`|1WgOj89kaa	Definitely, Cena has always had the talent to get the crowd laughing and has the charisma.|`|VU6ODC5Baa	I aggre,good example of his mic skills.That was really funny.|`|iWTdzJoaaa	I laughed so hard when he said that.|`|T8IFOfHCaa	huh|`|31269476570b3829c86de1e8c487e423aa	that was funny but i don't understand ur WQ|`|2FKHNIB2aa	While i don't care for Cena i have to admit he is very funny|`|AA11482019	I'm a Cena hater, but I did find that funny.
99amr13kaa	wow okay 7.5 is small... it depends on your shoe size. not your height or weight. im a size 10 1/2 and i ride 7.62 you can have that or 7.75 if you arent satisfied with the 7.5 or 7.62 hope i helped.|`|bQfMdIgIaa	all depends if you a fast catch get a mini (harder to land tricks since thinner) 7.5 if you want a regular catch (fairly easy to land) 8 for slow but easy to land tricks. i recommend 7.5 cause there not to big or 2 small
2Yijblbaaa	A lot of people rent skis, boots and poles regularly. And they're fine! Rentals usually run about $30 dollars per day. (I'm in NY and that's what I've seen around NY and Pennsylvania) If you end up loving the sport you should invest in buying your own set. Although, that will run you around $1,000. But it's a great investment if you go often.    Good luck!!! and Be careful!|`|wfnQNIhCaa	you can rent equipment in a ski shop for the season....    it will be cheaper than renting it in a resort daily...(well if you go a few times)    in the ski shop they have MANY skis, boots, poles, helmets. They are much better quality than they have at the resorts and the design is usually nicer also...You will def find what you need there...    also another nice thing about that is that you don't have to wait in line at the resort and you can just go ski after you get your lift ticket.|`|4REeX6lbaa	If you rent skis it usually is about 30-40$ per day but if you go downtown to the little ski shops they will have cheaper prices but they wont be as good quality. The skis you rent at the mountain are usually very good quality and not old or crappy (My mom rented skis once and she loved them, a lot more than her skis so she went out and bought the same pair.)  If you decide you like skiing and want to buy the equipment that would be the best choice but the boots have to fit the skis, the bindings. So you wouldn't be able to buy the boots without the skis. Also poles are usually cheap around 10-30 dollars and they don't really matter what kind as long as they fit your height.
xxtvhn5Naa	I would have to say the Cowboys, Steelers, Cardinals, Packers, Bills or the 49ers.    All of them are very old teams, that have gone thought many ups and downs.  They all have produced great players, great people, and great accomplishments.  I would consider these Americas Teams.|`|2kUHectjaa	Well, the Steelers have pretty good fans. Although they don't run the 4-3 anymore, their defense is still very basic with just filling gaps and things like in the old days of football. They also play with a power running game and a game manager at QB like the old days.|`|U7oDXHglaa	the browns and bears because they haven't really changed their jerseys|`|1ccf4408a6862b6272c7872e63b19c51aa	How about the Bears and Packers even the Cardinals are Old Fashioned|`|jUs6hygQaa	The Steelers are a very good option. The 49ers could do, but the aren't very good, and the Cowboys are a bit of a sellout team in my opinion. I'm a charger fan, but they don't have much of a history in that respect, so final answer, the Steelers.|`|Sn4ldoifaa	idk|`|O2jH0yVFaa	the Raiders have a big fan base in LA but I don't think they're really committed to their old winning ways. San Diego is a few hours away from Los Angeles so Chargers|`|ga4ZWsuZaa	packers, cowboys (as much i hate to say it), steelers, patriots, broncos, browns, 49r's, raiders|`|eIOlBzm8aa	Bills,Raiders,Redskins,Chiefs|`|Mf6cyniKaa	i personally dont like them but the browns are very old fashioned., theyre the only team ever to always have no decal on theyre helmet. its always just been a blank orange helmet. the steelers are also old fashioned|`|06TvcksDaa	I would go with Bears, Steelers, or maybe even Raiders.  Also, Browns are pretty old fashioned which is why I love seeing Browns-Steelers games....Go Steelers!|`|jLnXuam7aa	49ers since 1946|`|YCwmCDkUaa	Browns are a good one  Bears probably as well|`|qThmcR1Aaa	The Packers.    Last of the small-market teams from the old days. Been around since 1919, and in the NFL since 1921. Only team that's owned by the community and the fans. Some of the most legendary names in pro football. Lambeau Field is virtually a shrine to pro football. And 12 championships ... more than any other team.    How can you do better than that?|`|4pX3bXzvaa	I am also from LA, and I have been a fan of the Steelers since we lost our two LA teams. I've always liked the organization and the amount of respect people have for them. They draft really well every year, take care of its players, and feel like "the good guys" of the league.    But, you can't force yourself to like any team. Watch a few different teams and decide which one you like.|`|K81H2emuaa	browns,bears,chiefs,and bills

wi0CSqNSaa	They cause little to no damage to beachers. Beaches are pretty resiliant somebody trampaling through the sand isnt going to cause much damage.     People who surf are usually very environmentally friendly. If they litter or are causing a problem. Other surfers will usually comment.     Wikiki Beach isn't a surfers beach. Thats a tourist beach. It would be more correct to ask what damage are tourists causing to the beaches, Well thats alot... They litter, smoke, drink(illegally FYI its illegal to drink on beaches in Hawaii), they also cause sound and all other sorts of pollution. Look at a map of Hawaii though. The majority of the Perimeter is beach. The tourists are confined to small locations. The private beaches are safe and conserved.    Yes they are causing damage, but its concentrated into small areas. If you haven't been to Hawaii. Natives treat tourists differently then other natives.|`|xhPKkkELaa	NONE, but  rude and ignorant tourists are damaging every beach, and greedy developers, who build huge condos for people who don't appreciate the beach are ruining them. If we could get rid of all of these people (and all of the  rude, yuppie, kid, make believe surfers) the beach would far better off with just surfers.|`|yWcPOTsAaa	Surfers don't damage the beaches.

xa10rqMlaa	just keep sprinting, you will get better over time|`|ocHNtbQZaa	The only thing that matters for running speed is how much muscle support force you have so you don't collapse at the ankle/knee at ground contact. This results in the shorter contact times and longer strides of faster runners. Support force means strength. Try altitude drops where you jump off a chair and land on the balls of your feet, knees slightly bent. Only do a few reps until you get used to the forces of landing. Do short top speed sprints to practice staying  relaxed while running.|`|kJDWy3biaa	There is nothing unnatural about lifting weights. This is one of the primary ways to get better at not just sprinting but at running in general. But aside from lifting, a really good way to get faster is to run pyramid repeats on a track: 100m,200m,300m,200m,100m.|`|Oygq9Lvyaa	steroids|`|TzENTI8Saa	practice makes perfect
to8Vpp0zaa	I tie my harnesses up in different lenghts, from 36" to 60".  I also tie some with different sized hooks, either 2's or 4's, and some with a triple hook at the end.  I also tie some with a single hook, to use with a leech or a minnow.  When adding the beads, I'll use different size and/or color beads on some, and on some I'll add a float.  I'll tie a swivel on the end, instead of tying a loop.  Also, I'll usually put a quick-change clevis on, and snap the blade on when I'm out fishing.  This is how I prepare my harnesses for a season of fishing....hope some of this helps you.  I like to make up my own bottom bouncers and jig heads too....if you jig fish and you don't make your own, it doesn't take a lot to get started making them.....you could share some of the initial expense with a buddy.

My teammate was 6'0 175 3rd in the state in receiving, 1462 yards and 19 touchdowns and voted first team all California by Maxpreps. But he had no offers because he was TOO SHORT and TOO SLOW(4.8 40).

Have fun, football is the ****.|`|jisJ1Bj3aa	Weight is hardly a factor for a WR, and you don't necessarily need great height depending on your type. Lots of speed guys in the NFL are under 6'- around 5'10.    This was my first year playing football and i played WR and Corner. I'm about a hair under 5'11 and 165. Height isn't so much a factor as much as length and jumping ability. I have good sized legs and upper torso but i have long skinny arms that give me a 6'2 wingspan which really helps a WR reach to get balls away from my body. I also have a good vert that helps me get up.     You have great size- just keep eating and hopefully you can develop good hands and leg strength which you probably have from soccer.|`|rRICfQPZaa	You're fine. You just need to have good hands and don't worry about the weight... you'll get that over time.

If you want a personal protection gun, for crying out loud get AT LEAST a 9mm.  The best would be something in a .45 acp loaded with ammo designed for personal protection.|`|EGe0k8P6aa	Baring something like a .45 Sam Yan 909, .50 Career Dragonslayer, or Quackenbush .458 Outlaw, a pellet gun is not a good choice for self defense since they don't have the power to consistently stop someone who is attacking you instantly. (In point of fact an airgun like you're describing is more likely to piss someone off than stop them.) Even the three large-bore airguns I named are marginal choices since they're large guns designed for hunting not combat. If you want a gun for self defense, either get a 12 gauge shotgun shooting buckshot or a .357 Magnum revolver.|`|YczLYtWjaa	you would be better off using it as a club|`|zu9WVrY6aa	A 600 fps pellet gun can kill someone if you hit them in the wrong spot and is going to make more than a flesh wound regardless.  That being said it is a terrible choice for personal protection.  The others are right it will probably just tick someone off enough that they REALLY want to harm you.    If you don't know much about guns I'd recommend mace for personal protection.  PLEASE don't just go buy a gun unless you also get proper training on how to handle it.|`|z7f6uYR2aa	how old are you? 10? That's not gonna even stop a Chihuahuau, maybe piss it off. But if u wanna stop someone,at leastt buy pepper spray or a tazer, that'll be better than a little plinking pistol. And look at it this way...a crack head storming your house might think u shot a nerf gun at him, especially if he's high.

9tYvYUEWaa	Both feet should be central with your toes just in front of the edge of the board the way your facing(farthest edge from you).  Don't have your front foot hanging with your toes gripping the edge closest to you either.  Your basically in the kick flip stance if your doing that, so you board is responding to your position.  And also, if your not landing on the board after you get vert, you may be subconsciously afraid of landing on the board.  Another thing, when your front foot pushes up to gain friction from the concave front of your board, be sure that your foot is going out straight, and coming back straight.  If your foot is making a nike swoosh motion, your mixing the kick flip motion in there again.    Best of luck!  Would like to hear if that helps

Candle wax with mess up your board and make you go very very slow. The wax that you do want is called P-tex it is what the bottom of the snowboard is made of. If you get a gash just melt p-tex and fill in the hole and it will really be like it never happened. Get it on boardparadise.com or the-house.com or dogfunk.com.

iO12Vjnvaa	Usually the wait time for the Bristol night race is three years. Hopefully you've done the waiting or have got a source to get your tickets. Generally the box office is sold out and will place you on the waiting list. You CAN still get tickets BUT they will cost you an arm and a leg from scalpers, ticket agents, and some other websites. So good luck and happy hunting. Richard Petty tower would be my suggestion.    Just an opinion as always.|`|iT8CNh6paa	mid way up from start/finish line|`|VQHGqYXvaa	There all good at Britol !!!!

But you will have to take out a loan for them. No seats are available from the box office and they cost an arm and a leg already. Good luck finding affordable seats.

I have always had german shorthairs, but my uncle raised them so naturally i took to them.  I have never been a fan of cocker spaniels because the two I have hunted behind had serious issues getting through anything thick what with being so short.  Now I have met people who swear by cockers and say you have to really study for good hunting blood and hardiness in the bloodlines.  I have also been seriously considering an english setter.  Good hunting

Agsp62ttaa	There's 2 E&C matches, and about 5 minutes of "the totally awesome best of Edge and Christian", which is some funny backstage stuff and 5 second poses.    Other than that, there's about 25 matches, and when Edge does have his "commentary" between matches, he does keep up the cocky, self-assured persona. There's nothing on the DVD about how he got into the WWE or whatever (I guess he figured the book accounted for that), just a lot of matches, really.|`|6f41c712d34a30397cc9d83fa0a8d496aa	Well edge dvd is pretty awsome i'll have to say i have seen every dvd they have realese senses 2005 and i have enjoy every single one of them.

Don't be so stressed. When i tried out, i had to show them that i was willing to get better, so i had to listen to everything they said. DO EVERYTHING THEY TELL YOU TO. if you don't listen to the coachs, and give them a hard time, they aren't going to like you.   also, know that no one can be perfect, everyone can improve, so don't have a stuck-up attitude.    before the try outs just refreshen up your skills (jumping, diving, serving, setting ect..)|`|qkEPaCQSaa	I've been playing volleyball for a couple of years and have been to quiet a few try-outs,  Ok well to help i advise you to wear a brighter colored t-shirt so the coaches or whatever notice you easily, stay away from grays and whites and its pretty easy to stick out.  Be positive, even if you mess up don't get mad or discouraged.  Plus be loud and talk a lot on the court, coaches love to see girls that keep the team pumped up and working together.  Good Luck!:)|`|DeRRNCvnaa	I liked the girl above me that said the thing about team spirit and the bright shirts.     Also, dont focus on the other girls. Just focus on yourself.     When you get on the court and do a mini scrimmage or wash drill, work toghtether as a team.     Coaches dont choose "the best" girls. They choose the girls that have confidence, spirit and that enjoy playing volleyball.       GOOD LUCK!|`|e9zopZE0aa	school is a lot easier than club.  but if you go for every ball and fall down and stuff, and swing hard at serves/hits then they know you want to try :))

I would pick the Chicago set because they look easier to irons. Chances are still that it will be hard to find a really cheap sets for between 50 and 70 euros|`|def8SxE2aa	Go to a golf store and demo some iron sets and buy the one that feels and preforms the best for you. Also, do not buy them that day, go back and hit them a day or two later and if they feel the same as the first time you hit them then buy them. Also, get them custom fit to your swing and you will be on your way.|`|UKg4KhLqaa	Please do as a beginner's do.

I think that if he wins it, there's a high likelihood that he will win one or two more majors this year.  But if he loses, it might take longer for him to get back into it.    I just want him to solidify his place in history.|`|NPioEHKWaa	I really hope Federer wins  But I fear that the task is too big and Rafa will do it  Rafa may be tired but he's gonna be hitting bigger forehands which Federer can't handle.  The outcome of the game depends a lot on Federers backhand.  If Federer doesn't win.. There are going to be a lot of questions asked about him. But if he wins I think he could win all 4 this year. The French is a major possibility if Fed wins tomorrow.|`|dVXfDeGRaa	Roger all the way!! He is in top form as long as he gets a good start and keeps his serve and the serve percentage high its should go his way. Nadal is a good player and his forehand is great, but Roger has many tricks up his sleeve, if it even goes 5 sets Federer will win 100% because nadal is tired from his 5+ hr match against Verdasco.   Federer all the way!!!|`|U7BkuEU9aa	I adore them both and I always want them both to win all their matches, but somehow when they're playing each other II always support Rafa. Maybe because he's more vibrant or because he's the reason I *really* got into tennis in the first place...him being Spanish is not the reason, but also helps, since I basically love all things Spain. So yeah, I'm supporting Rafa. I want him to win, but it's not like I want Fed to lose, you know what I mean? It sucks that he has to for it to happen...|`|N9pKl35Xaa	Im all for Fed  but really dont care which one wins, both deserve it for different reasons|`|AA12149254	I bet Rafa's facebook page is filled with 600,000 teenage girls...Well, count me in.

I want to see him tie Pete's record of 14 slams, sooner rather than later.|`|AA12034105	Nope, Rafa all the way !!  I've supported him forever and I'm not gonna stop haha :P  Vamos Rafa !!!! xx|`|zWkhWSaIaa	It's the first REAL match between him and Nadal. By REAL, I mean it's a Hardcourt Grand Slam Final. Tennis is predominantly played on a hardcourt service. Nadal is a special clay court player, so any wins on clay against Federer aren't making that big of a statement. Now of course Nadal's win on grass in the Wimbledon Final was also a statement, but Federer pushed Nadal to his limits, and 9-7 in a 5th set doesn't show any dominance (plus Federer had the disease "mono" that season and was really out of energy and was not fit at all. And not trying to make too many excuses but the light was severely lacking in the final 2-3 games when they were playing, the game should have been delayed till the next day but the umpire knew it would cause a world wide stir)).     So yea Federer's wins on grass weren't that big of a deal as well (but grass is a little closer to hardcourt than clay is to hardcourt since the ball is faster on grass than on clay), and this match on hardcourt is definitely a big deal. You've seen Federer dominate hardcourt though at the US Open (5 times), Aussie Open (3 times), and countless other tournaments.|`|3b1KrGHTaa	I am Federer's woman through and through!|`|cjpWc8Fcaa	ME!!!

QNuzWDc1aa	I swim for my neighborhood team and we do drills to build lung capacity.  If you're just swimming in P.E., I would probally go with extending the time your under water by a few seconds each time you go under.  This will gradually expand your lungs, letting you hold more air and stay under longer.  If you don't have enough time to do that in the water every day, then while you're taking notes in class or taking a test, or whatever the case may be, you could just hold your breath then.  It sounds weird, but it helps!!!|`|Jx3TG0keaa	well if you just want to stay under water. you CANT think about breathing empty your mind of everything or if you cant do that think of one thing specifically. also not moving so much wont waste as much oxygen. however since your swimming around just take a deep breath from your stomach NOT your chest. oh and don't let out your breath right when you get under water. let it out gradually

uO0OAqWkaa	Relative to other brands the Rudy Project Kontact has a fairly low profile, but rests high on the forehead.<br>  <br>  However, how a given helmet will fit depends on the shape of your head.  Each brand and model of the same brand has a slightly different shape, which rests slightly different on each person's head.<br>  <br>  Given a choice it is better purchase a helmet you can try on even if it is not the precise model you would like most.  More expensive models do not protect your head better, but often provide improved cooling by way of more aggressive venting.  Giro, Bell, and other manufacturers which are more common also have very nice helmets and a similar price to the Rudy Kontact (e.g., Bell Sweep, Giro Atmos).|`|Z5xgSATSaa	Unless you know ahead of time how a particular helmet will fit, buying online is risky. Different helmets, even within the same brand, have a different fit, so it is really not possible to tell you how a particular one is going to look and fit on you. Stick to what you can buy locally.|`|JSGLKnA4aa	you should be fitting helmets in a store before you buy on-line to see how fit. depends on pads added & shape of head as to how it will sit.

Gku81sSXaa	The French Open is usually very fun to watch because on the red clay you have a lot of rallies.  Nadal is obviously the overwhelming favorite, perhaps as big a favorite as there has been in recent year because it seems he can't lose on red clay.  Federer only won four games from him in the final last year!<br>  <br>  I would think the main contender for Nadal this year would be Andy Murray.  The main reason is because he has a solid backhand and solid forehand plus, like Nadal he is very mobile and can run down almost anything.  Federer has a problem with Nadal's high topspin to his backhand but Murray is taller than Federer and with his height and two handed backhand he may be able to handle the topspin better than Federer.<br>  <br>  Tsonga is excellent but on red clay it would neutralize his big serve and his excellent volley somewhat but I do see him as a contender.<br>  <br>  I can see Djokovic doing well also but it seems his stamina isn't great and that bad considering the long matches he may have to endure at the French.<br>  <br>  All and all it still seems to be Nadal's tournament to win or lose.  He's the big favorite.|`|8Lc9d7TTaa	The only thing I am worried about is Spanish invasion from the top players of the world although it would be nice to see federer win at least once they shouldn’t be so harsh on him.|`|A1ohtlWsaa	yes but there are 5 masters first three of which are on clay so rafa and roger are likely to meet again  in the finals of those ones.|`|e7f9613d5b480e9758d037bfe66ac6b9aa	french open is waste of 15 days|`|RQBolYlXaa	yeah i can't w8 for the french open and of course nadal will probably win it but it should still be a good tournament, my surprise contender would be nalbandian(if he gets his act together) i fell that nalbandian is the only player that might have a chance of beating nadal at the french open. i have 2 admit tho that is highly unlikely nadal hardest ever match at the french open was a couple of years ago when he was a set and a brake down to paul-henri mathieu and he still won so i can't see any1 beating him there but like i said if any1 can then it WILL be nalbandian|`|XtFsntdSaa	I am counting down the days until the french open. I have been incredibly tennis deprived since the Australian open. I seriously have nothing to watch on tv since the Australian open finished. <br>  <br>  For the french open final, I would like to say Safina and maybe Ivanovic. I really have a feeling Safina will win. <br>  <br>  For the mens definitely RAFA, he is on fire, no one can take the french away from him.|`|FYd1ndVxaa	Absolutely excited and anticipating the world's top players play - I especially like Elena Dementieva and Rafael Nadal to win. (I do want Federer to breakthrough for a win in Roland Garros, but just let Nadal set the record for himself first). Jo-Wilfried Tsonga is hopeful especially playing on home soil with backing from so much enthusiastic home supporters|`|AA12034105	Yeah !!

c279a20ca4a74c949fd956abd236d8c7aa	I think Clemens is a roid boy too but he hasn't testified to it in front of a grand jury (yet). Clemens has always had a large head so maybe he's been using for a long time.<br>  <br>  Henry Aaron is still my HR king...!|`|58d6b4483a329162e1f9eeafcf972793aa	Well let's see didn't Clemens sit out 60 games last year because he was so called pondering whether he should retire or come back as an Astro?  Hmmmm the baseball steroid policy says for a third time offender the person should forfeit 60 games without pay. and miss a fourth of the season. And just when did Clemens Come back last year to pitch for the Astros? About 60 games plus a fourth of the season. Now I'm not saying that Clemens used but the argument can be made that he did based on those numbers.  As for Bonds it's simple, Many baseball players have been found guilty of using steroids, and not one of them hit 756 homeruns. Bonds is the New King No doubt about it.<br>  <br>  Below me, get your facts straight. No everyone would not know about it, because clemens is the poster boy for baseball.  And do the math little guy, 60 games pondering retirement or 60 games suspension by the league under- wraps. in fact if i'm not mistaken the article posted has Clemens named as one of the players Jason Grimsley saw for himself take HGH and or Steroids during his tenure as a player. Since we all like to blame others on other people's testimony I guess Roger is a user and cheater too.|`|I5yY4Styaa	To the guy above me...what the heck are you talking about??  Clemens used steroids because he took off the first part of the season??  That makes no sense whatsoever.  If he took the time off due to a suspension everyone would know about it, there's no way MLB could cover that up.  I don't think he ever used anything though, mainly because he's lost speed on his fastball as he got older which is the natural thing to do.  He's gotten bigger, but that seems to me to be mostly around the midsection which happens to most men in their early 40's.  I don't know who used and who didn't, but Clemens isn't a guy I'd be looking at even though more pitchers have gotten busted than power hitters.
AA10034577	Start Jones, but keep an eye on him.

hzQDocWaaa	who knows they both suck lol|`|yM8NiXmLaa	I believe that the Pirates will finish last. The Reds have improved their lineup immensely. They added Willy Taverez to give them speed at the top of the lineup and Jay Bruce will enter his first full year in the big leagues and I expect good things from him. The Reds rotation isn't shabby either with Volquez, Harang and Arroyo. Then they have Cordero to close. I wouldn't count the Reds out of 4th place to be honest with you. But yeah the Pirates suck.|`|2zWeTzafaa	pirates<br>  <br>  the pirates lack depth, they lack power, and are a very small market team.<br>  <br>  the reds, however, will not make a bid for last place.  with an improving rotation (volquez, harang, arroyo, cueto, bailey) and the best young talent in the NL, i don't see at all how we could be in last place.|`|hMkb7H31aa	Ironically, the Pirates and Reds play each other during the final three games of the season.  It could come down to this series to get the final answer to your question.|`|6vzpHTqQaa	The Pirates.

AA10940228	Romo.<br>  <br>  Romo may not play like that consistently, but there's no reason to think he'll have worse numbers than Hasselbeck next week with their given match-ups.  Seattle will run the ball if they establish a lead.  The Cowboys use the pass game to score more touchdowns than their run-by committee.<br>  <br>  Berrian.<br>  <br>  Lee Evans has to do well against a difficult Steelers defense.  If Buffalo gets behind early, they will be forced to throw, but Evans will not have better numbers than Berrian vs. the very weak and vulnerable Kansas City Chiefs.|`|01153ee4a5c79fd2f89196319c887bd1aa	I like Romo over Hasselbeck, my team partner also says Miami isn't any good... Neither of us have heard of Evans|`|2X5bJwhZaa	First, I would start Berrian.  Evans only had 5 receiving yards last week, and that isn't impressive if you are the #1 receiver on your team.<br>  <br>  As for the quarterback situation, Romo play very well, but since Hasselbeck is facing an Arizona Cardinals who only has one big name secondary player, Adrian Wilson, I would say Hasselbeck.|`|vqvH43L3aa	I would have to go with Romo..and im not just saying that because im a Boy's Fan..His numbers from last year (in only 10 games) and his numbers he put up on sunday night were amazing...and hes also going up against a very bad pass defense from Miami. expect him to throw for at least 2 td's and at least 200 yards next sunday..as for the wr's i would definitely go with berrian...even though grossman is as unpredictable as the weather..when he is hot and hits berrian..berrian can make plays happen..and berrian is goin up against a bad kc defense..where as lee evans is goin up against one of the best pass defenses in the league, and he doesnt really have a good supporting cast..so go with ROMO and BERRIAN!!...good luck man!!

LEN60u4faa	Jacobs has been diagnosed with a sprained knee and for now it is still unsure how much he will miss.  I would expect at least a week to two weeks depending on how bad the sprain.  Now, after seeing how Ward performed today, DEFINITELY add him.  It is still questionable whether or not Jacobs can be a full time back, and Ward looks like he can break tons of big plays (kind of like a Jones Drew).  Even if Jacobs comes back, expect to see Ward to get around 10 carries a game, which makes him a decent RB3 or flex option.  So yes, he is worth the roster spot|`|01153ee4a5c79fd2f89196319c887bd1aa	I'd say Ward is worth a spot as a #3 running back... Personally, I don't think Jacobs will be able to be the main guy all season long, his body is so big, I'm thinken he'll keep getten injured... They need to pass more, which they're doing, and potentially use Ward more, time will tell what they do|`|jaQ32s3paa	I think Brown is right, Derrick Ward would be a good guy to get along with Jacobs especially when Jacobs returns from the knee (not sure on that yet)... Ward should fit into the offense ok, breaking out every ounce in awhile as we seen in week one, good luck

AA11468064	Maybe..More then YOU wanted..Information wise..But what the Heck..Hope it helps,<br>  <br>  Kind Regard,<br>  S<br>  <br>  General cleaning can be best accomplished with Windex or something similar. There is some alcohol in Windex, although not quite as bad as straight rubbing alcohol.<br>  <br>  RR balls seem to resurface quite well. Since I have a ball spinner (as well as a complete pro shop) I can accomplish this task quite quickly. I have successfully resurfaced both Rhino's with great success both for myself and many others. Everyone has been pleased that the balls react much the same as out of the box. Depending on the wear before starting I wet sand in the spinner with 240, then 320, then 400, then 600 then some stuff a body shop buddy game me called EXTRA FINE, which I believe is around 1200 grit. Anyway, after this I use white and orange 3M rubbing and polishing compound followed by the 3M Finesse-it II Finishing Material. At this point I use a clean dry soft old washcloth and use the finnesse liberally. In the spinner the ball will get warm. Keep going until the finesse dries from this heat generated and then use another clean dry soft cotton rag or towel to "buff" the haze from the ball. If you've been diligent, your ball will shine like a mirror and react the same as out of the box (or at least out of the box and polished with Finesse for the teal).<br>  <br>  The down side of this is that the Finesse-it does not seem to work well at speeds generated by hand and a spinner is a must in my opinion. This stuff is designed to remove swirls from the final 1500 grit sandout. That it really does. It is also not cheap (around $25.00 at professional autobody supply centers) or a rip off at around $30.00 from bowling supply houses that buy it from the auto supply centers and then mark it up to us, just like any of the other stuff that you can obtain locally if you look hard enough, such as the wet or dry sandpaper, sandscreen, scotchbrite pads and the like. The good side is that a bottle seems to go quite a way as I have had mine for a little over a year (1 qt) and it is only about 2/3 gone.<br>  <br>  The way I see it is that if kept up (that is resurfacing every 75 games or so) most of the RR balls will continue to react pretty much just like out of the box.<br>  <br>  <br>  E. What is "Legal" for Cleaning Bowling Balls<br>  Steve then scribed the following in regards to teh ongoing debate about ball cleaning substance abuse... -bill<br>  <br>  Chris Cooper at Bowling Headquarters told me today that their tests have shown that denatured alcohol DOES tend to soften up some bowling balls, thus is not permissible for use as a bowling ball cleaner. He was kind enough to fax me a copy of the official bowling ball cleaners acceptable and unacceptable list. It is below. While not on the list, he indicated that Finesse-it by 3M is an acceptable agent as it does not chemically attack the ball, but just polishes it. In fact he said that for the most part it is their cleaner of choice at the testing center at Bowling Headquarters for most any equipment. Again, everything that follows between the double lines is verbatim from the fax from ABC/WIBC Equipment Specs department, courtesy Chris Cooper.

A plastic ball is basically as polish as you can get for any ball.  A plastic ball is made to travel straight down the lane.  If your asking how to clean a plastic ball, then use a towel and any ball cleaner sold in your local pro-shop.  I recommend Ebonite's Power House cleaner.

Jacobs- great pick. will be a suprise and will have a lot of TEs<br>  8. Driver- good pick. he is a main target for Favre in the red zone<br>  9. Coles- great pick for the 9th round<br>  10. San Diego- good D but maybe taken a lil early<br>  11. Kitna- stupid pick u already have a top notch QB<br>  12. Wilkins- why take a kicker anywhere else than the last round<br>  13. Witten- ok pick<br>  14. Betts- good pick for the spot<br>  15. Green- dumb|`|tXRKlyLDaa	Very good team for a 12 team league, but for an 8 team league, most teams are very good
a611e715d5b36bde1095ea94f48e8d61aa	Handcuffing is an interesting strategy, for example I would do the following handcuffs:<br>  - LT and Michael Turner<br>  - Portis and Ladell Betts<br>  - Jones-Drew and Fred Taylor<br>  - Julius Jones and M.Barber<br>  <br>  You are usually better off just drafing all the #1 RB's you can.  For example, last night I was picking 8th and got the following:<br>  <br>  - Manning (round 1)<br>  - Westbrook (round 2)<br>  - C.Benson (round 3)<br>  - T.Jones (round 5)<br>  - L.Betts (round 10)<br>  <br>  So I have 3 starting RB's and one timeshare, who has great potential to end up as the starter.  In round 15 I picked Tony Hunt, who is the handcuff to Westbrook just in case.<br>  <br>  Bottom line:  I would not handcuff Parker/Davenport, because I see no upside in Davenport mainly.|`|zMp0ceACaa	yeah|`|MwJlZZQgaa	Well if you do that you would have too pick up Kevan Barlow as well so no I wouldn't do that. Plus Willie Parker isn't injury prone.
LeQp4EN7aa	lynch cuz he starts|`|3KyIxMHuaa	Mos def Marshawn Lynch. He might be projected to score lower points but Morency is going to be splitting time with Brandon Jackson while Lynch is going to be the main back in Buffalo. So start Lynch.|`|Zk7JBwlhaa	Lynch looks like the starter with little competition for carries, Morency is supposed to start but he may split with Jackson - Morency is in a better offense but Lynch will get 20 touches whether he wants to or not, plus Morency has been out all preseason with a bum knee, I'm not a huge Lynch fan but I think at the moment he presents less risk<br>  <br>  I vote Lynch
2a8aced08792dbec6f549be460dde041aa	no brainer ... plaxico<br>  <br>  although dallas D is great, they are more of a pass rush/run defense not pass defend.  plus, plax is better than berrian and eli is better than grossman (qb's throwing to them)|`|eIlKNMSnaa	Burress vs. the Cowgirls.
YxlffUB5aa	Wow, Darknight, chill on the sarcasm.|`|R3SH9tPWaa	Well ... if it's YOUR stat tracker ... I don't know why you would expect it to work for MY fantasy football ... ?
