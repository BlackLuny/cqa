5HOyupgfaa	i say let her go for it, especially if hes a good kid. <br>  but, i dont mean to scare you, if she starts asking for birth control, you better talk to her.|`|285c8243564acc36040f290206c3ff28aa	No, don't 'hold your ground.'  That's just being stubborn for no purpose.  Let them be supervised, let them do group dating.  Otherwise, that which is forbidden becomes more interesting.  We always want what we can't have.  Forbid it and they'll find ways to do it anyway.  If you allow it, you can control it.|`|qxUNmdd6aa	hold your ground, i know i always wanted to date when i was 14 and so on, and i NOW wish my dad would have been way more strict on me. <br>  with any situation such as homework and reaching goals be pretty strict.. we like when the parent cares|`|S0BLaR8maa	Coming from someone your daughter's age.<br>  I know exactly how she feels.<br>  <br>  Really, I saw let them go out.<br>  If she really likes him, and he's not going to get her into trouble, or force her to do things, why not?|`|sXpGfHWWaa	Nope.. I dont think you are if I were you I would allow it, however no MAJOR lip locking, just a little peck ( on the lips is fine) just make sure it is appropriate.|`|5ULJZsqpaa	I think point blank refusing to let her date a guy she's somewhat smitten with could easily lead to sneaking around behind your back, resentment, disobedience etc. I think, at their age, it's probably a good idea to let them hang out together outside of school when they are with other people. You said any date of theirs would be supervised, and if that's the case then I really don't see what the problem could possibly be with letting her date. <br>  <br>  Maybe she'll discover that she's not really that into him after all, and it'll fizzle in a few weeks. Surely that's better than lingering "what-could-have-been" resentment towards you for taking the hard line? Maybe she'll find that she really likes him and that he really likes her back, and they end up with a really good quality relationship. That doesn't seem so bad to me either.|`|P5Iq6nufaa	It seems that your instinct is to let her date the boy with those conditions. Parents need to be more comfortable with those instincts, you have them for a reason. If you are comfortable with her dating the boy at 14 with some conditions, then do it. Holding on to the 16 rule just for the sake of not going back on what you said is silly. As a certain former President never learned, parents are best advised to change course sometimes when the payoff is positive and enough is known to prove the original course misguided.|`|Xb6Tso2baa	Personally i am 14 so i know how your daughter is feeling.<br>  If you let her date right now she will be more happy then anything, Kinds dont really think about how to take atvantage of their parents. Se just wants to date. If i was her I would think more about dating then wining the battle with you.And i would date him secretly anyway. So If i were you I would just let her do it. And everyone at her age is dating.<br>  If you dont let her shes going to be upset obiously lol by saying no to her its more just making a problem because if you think shes respnsible then you should just trust her.<br>  Good luck!|`|381bc01ff9a0d000383e935fd5d4d532aa	well the type of "dates" u said arent bad, i say theres nothing wrong with letting them date as long as u aprove of him. my mom said the same to me, but she let me have my school bf before that.|`|prqrQcd1aa	If you have told her that she could not date until she is 16 then it would be wise to hold your ground with her on this issue. I wouldn't be blind though, allow them to be "friends" tell her that he can come over and have dinner with you guys and they can hang out at your house supervised... This way she knows that you are allowing her to develop a relationship with the boy out of friendship. Once they are old enough to date, they will already have a strong bond together, if they stay together that long as friends. If not then well, she will thank you for not allowing her to actually "date" that guy!|`|706fa9fa645a352ed4dc9e7315894893aa	well i see your point on holding your ground...and hoping i can do the same when my daughter is that old....but I would just give her some slack. As long as there is adult supervision and they only see each other at school then it should be ok. But just let her know all the rules and make sure she understands. I'm sure everything will be fine! Good Luck!|`|8SjoUQmEaa	Well, I think you should allow her to "date" this boy. They'll probably just mostly see each other at school, and if they were to go on dates only allow her to go out with him and a group of friends. Hold your ground on the no actual dates until she's 16. At her age, kids lose interest in each other fast, it probably won't last more than a few weeks, a month or two at the max.<br>  <br>  EDIT:<br>  But if she starts having any problems such as falling behind on school work or making this boy her top priority, then any kind of "dating" should be out of the question.|`|Aj99vuqYaa	I started "dating" when I was a freshman in high school. My parents had the rule of "no dating before 16" and I broke it anyway. I called him, not my boyfriend, but my "special friend". The name stuck and while they harassed me about it, I ended up getting away with it. It didn't do me any harm by having a "boyfriend" at a younger age. I personally think they were worried about sex getting involved. But I know relationships aren't about that, its about love and respect for each other. To me, sex isn't something to just "throw around" and do when you're too young to bear the consequences. (No I'm not saying that teen parents are bad, yata yata. Just saying, I think it's a real bad idea to have sex at such a young age. Though I think it's bad before marriage anyway, but still. not the point here)<br>  <br>  Just make sure they're following rules that you set out, such as if you want them to go on group dates only, that they do that. Tell them when they're a year or two older they can go on dates alone. Stuff like that.<br>  <br>  Just don't make her feel like she's a horrible person. I got in lots of trouble for dating early, but I did it anyway since i really liked them. The relationship wont last long anyway, most likely, so just let her have some fun.<br>  <br>  It's good to hold your ground, but you can let this slide and not mess things up for her. Just tell her the rules you set up about if her grades are lagging behind or she starts giving you lip after she's hung out with him/talked on the phone with him, then you can tell her she'll have to stop dating him.<br>  <br>  Watch out though. I was told to stop dating the guy i was with (when i was 16) and it went horribly downhill in the relationship and my family when i continued to date him behind my family's back. =\ I wish I could take it back now, but I'm getting by. Just be cautious, not overly, but moderately.|`|cjqKMjWnaa	hold your ground!  if it's meant to be, it will happen ... and the waiting will make it that much better in the end.<br>  <br>  dating is something you can't undo once it happens, so i think it's better to wait as long as possible before you begin.<br>  <br>  in the meantime, cherish the fact that your daughter tells you so much and you are so involved in her personal life.  i'm praying that my relationships with my daughters are close enough for this kind of communication as they get older.  (they're only 4 and 10 months old right now).<br>  <br>  i hope everything works out!
Kaudz4Msaa	It sounds like you have normal, protective emotions.  If other people were treating your baby well, and keeping her healthy, you would trust them more.|`|8058fcf2650f54ecf2f7caea81639d08aa	i kinda have the same thing where my mother in law gets upset that she doesn't get to babysit and doesn't see my baby as often. (i think once a week is good). I tried to explain to her in a nice way telling her that i had a baby so I could take care of it, not everyone else. i tried saying like ' i waited to have my baby because i wanted to be sure I could take care of her and give her all she needs, i never had any intentions of depending on others to take care of her or buy her anything. I knew being a mother entail a lot of work and i was willing to do it' She tries to say things like she just wants to give us a 'break' so  my husband and i can go out and escape, which i tell her i don't understand what 'escape 'means , cause i love my daughter  and i actually like her and like to spend time with her even though it's hard at times and my hubby and i always knew we would do everything the same just include our baby... she says she just always felt like she needed a break from being a mother and needed to get away a lot.. I can't help but feel bad for her that she felt that way because i think motherhood is amazing, well at least it has been for me.  She also does thing and tries to give my daughter things i don't approve of... My husband and I are not active in religion and my MIL is very much so and is always trying to push it on us and i'm tired of it...we don't know how else to tell her we're not interested in that, mostly because i think religion a lot of the time makes people closed minded to certain things, just my opinion and we want our child to accept everyone and everything... for some people it works great but it's just not for us...<br>  oh and the child interaction is important for your child to develop skills, it's a good idea to at least take her to the park and let her play with other kids, or visit family with kids around her age.|`|jnLryjZpaa	this is not healthy for your baby, you will make her far too dependent on you, also if you continue to shut every body out it will effect your marriage, she not just your baby. share!|`|692c8795f68a0ba95a0d09139d70c98caa	I adore my babies very much but let my family and one close friend watch them when needed.   However they respect my rules, and the fact she gives your baby soda an junk food is enough for me to say nope you cant watch her!   I let my sister take my baby to church last sunday, and she went into the nursery.. however i know the 2 girls in the nursery and knew she would be well cared for.    I think it is normal for you to react like this, and it will be easier for you to trust people as she gets older.|`|b9035adcbdf28a53a5a80e18a3dc49d7aa	I think you need to do what is best for you and quit worrying about what pressure your mother in law is putting you under. There is nothing wrong with you, you are an attached parent and there is nothing wrong with that. I would, however, consider putting her in a playgroup with other kids her age, It is great to be able to socialize with other Mom's and great for her to interact with kids her age. As far as the junk food? Do some research on-line and find a few articles that support healthy eating for children and how junk food can have adverse effects on a child's health. I have come to understand that the older generation is quick to pass judgment. Probably due to there own insecurities. Fact is, they did not have as much information as we do now when they were raising there children. Make sure she knows that just because she did that with her children and they came out ok... does not mean other children came out the same. Childhood diabetes is at an all time high in the US (among other things) I am pretty sure it has something to do with parents over indulging there children with the wrong foods.|`|vm8HtVUYaa	'i know what my baby girl wants when she wants it but nobody else does not even her daddy ...'<br>  <br>  I don't think that it's wrong that you love your baby girl and you want what's best for her, I just think that you should try and let other people into her life as well. You can't be the only person in her life. She needs contact with other children, as well as other adults. If you raise your child with the mind set that you are 'superior' when it comes to taking care of her needs, you are going to have a child with really bad separation anxiety and you're going to have a hard time getting her to adjust to the 'real world' outside of the home.|`|75c40712ce4c1c9063d61b17387937f9aa	she does need child to child interaction, so if you don't feel comfortable with her being seperated, then do play dates with other mothers .|`|6zeZwQL6aa	I completely agree with Mark's wifee.  <br>  <br>  It's normal to be protective of your daughter but it sounds like you're over-protective.  Besides, don't you want a break every now and then?<br>  <br>  Why don't you think your husband knows what your daughter wants?  Why do you have such a low opinion of your him?<br>  <br>  You have to detach yourself from your daughter once in awhile.  I know it's really hard for you to do that, but you'll just have to take a deep breath and take the plunge and let a relative take care of her every now and then.  And take her to church and let her play in the children's room with others her age.  She is 18 months.  She knows what's going on.  (I have a son who's 18 months too and he knows what's going on around him.)  It'll be very hard on you at first but if you could just take it a week at a time, you'll get accustomed to letting go.<br>  <br>  As for your MIL giving your daughter junk food, it upsets me to read that she does it when you're not around.  I hate it when relatives think they know it all and don't respect the MOTHER's wishes.  Maybe give her an ultimatum: if she doesn't stop doing that, she won't see her granddaughter.  It may have to come to that.  It sounds mean and friction is never fun, but it's for the sake of your daughter.  I'd be angry as heck if I found out my own MIL was giving my son junk food behind my back.|`|HFhNML5saa	You are a normal first mom.  And you are also your little girl's mom, you and your husband make the decisions, not the mom in law.  Also the soda (please learn from my mistake) she  will get a taste for it and will not want the stuff that is good for her, the more you can limit that junk the better.  Be firm in how you want to raise your child, eventually your mom in law will hopefully get the hint and back off, if she does not than you limit your time there.  Good Luck|`|UVwRSpDjaa	I think that it's nice to have a break sometimes & grandparents want to be involved. Why not let them watch her for an hour or so every now and then. Just make rules. I know it's hard because my boyfriends grandma watches my son sometimes if I have school or work and she gives him junks. I asked her not to and she said the same thing. She thinks that's what grandmas are suppose to do. I had to have my boyfriend ask her not to do it. We will always worry about our kids no matter what. One day your daughter will start school and you'll need to deal with it so start when you feel comfortable and take it slow. It's normal and okay to be so attatched. Good luck:)

cjqKMjWnaa	As a mother of 2 girls, I can assure you that your parents love you both EQUALLY.  As an older sister (to my younger sister), I completely understand how you feel.  Especially when you and your sister (like my sister and I were growing up) are just SO different!  Even as a parent, when I found out I was pregnant with my 2nd ... I knew I would love her, but I couldn't imagine loving anyone as much as I love my 1st daughter just because I loved her SO much ... more than ANYONE.  It just didn't seem possible.  I knew it had to be ... but still couldn't really wrap my brain around it, I guess.  And then my 2nd was born.  And it just happened.  I loved her just as much, instantly.  And that love has never faded, changed, diminished or wavered in any way since.  Even though she's been a bit harder to take care of - a little moodier, definitely more clingy, and just generally not as easy-going as my first was .... my love for her has never been affected.  I may be a little grumpier at times (which is not entirely her fault either), but I still love her as much as a human can possibly love another human being - just as much as I love my 1st daughter.  I can't imagine my life without either of them.  They both complete me.  I'm sure that your parents feel the same way about you.  I'm sure they treat you and your sister differently ... but you sound like a very different person from your sister, so it seems like that should be expected too.  Every child, teenager, parent, human being has their good and bad traits.  You have yours just like your sister has hers and your parents have theirs.  While you may feel like you clash a little more with your parents than your sister does, there is NOTHING that can take away, or even diminish, that instant, complete, I-would-die-for-this-person-without-a-th... love that comes the moment you hold your child, first/second/third/etc-born, in your arms. ?|`|285c8243564acc36040f290206c3ff28aa	There's only one way you'll ever really understand this, and that's when you have your second child.  But it's not about being the firstborn, I think it's much more about whether they feel loved by you.  So, ask yourself, do you show them love?  Or are you just difficult all the time?|`|90baecbe3029033e6f4b3cb1f967a617aa	learn something right now. parents will never ever admit that they have a favorite child. i once asked my brother which one of us mom loves more and he said him. so he even noticed the favortism. well my brother was always the apple of my moms eye and could never do anything wrong.|`|rhPCJfeuaa	We don't have a favorite.  My daughter and son melt our hearts for different reasons and in their own way.  My daughter is 5 1/2 and seems like a little daddy's girl, and my 2 yr old son is more of a mommy's little boy.  But we love them equally.  I am the youngest in my family and my husband is the oldest in his.  Neither of us feel like we were inferior to our siblings.  Actually, it seems that our parents come to us when in need.  You really won't understand how much love your heart and soul can feel for your children until you have your own.<br>  <br>  The one thing to consider is whether or not they feel disrespected by you since you say you get in more trouble than your sister and are stubborn.  Maybe they feel like you push them away or need your space more.  Honestly...just sit them down and talk to them about how you feel.  it would be a shame to go through your life thinking one thing that might not be true in any way.  it's probably affecting your relationship with them and your relationship with your sister.  Feeling like this isn't doing you or them any good, so take control of the situation and choose to discuss it and change it.|`|LsVZAyC5aa	no i love my children the same the children r different i would die for ether 1 of them i love my son we r closer but i love my daughter just as much the children r different my son is the 1 getting into trouble my daughter is on the honor role|`|4YDpeKbOaa	I do, because I only have one child.|`|AA12245468	The only time I ever showed favoritism to any of my kids was when my third daughter was born.

And my dad has always told me I was his favorite daughter (I'm his ONLY daughter).<br>  <br>  I've always felt my mom favors my brother, whom is older. She didn't have a difficult pregnancy with him, which I think created a different bond. When she was prego with me she stayed on bed rest from 5months on and was sick all the time. It's always "He married an engineer" I'm marrying someone who doesn't even have a college diploma. "He waited to get married after he was done with college" I'm not waiting. "He knew her 8 yrs" Me- 3yrs with my guy. "He was prom king" I was far from prom queen, but I graduated with honors. "He has a new job" "he's doing great in his new job" "he's running a whole bunch of lakes" I don't have a job per say. I stay at home to help her take care of my grandma (who has alzhiemers), but I co-own a DJ business. I've just always felt inferior in her eyes compared to my brother. And I could name a hundred different examples. I just wanted you to know that you're not alone in this thinking. I think most younger siblings feel like they're inferior to their older sibling because of their parent. My fiancé even still feels that way at 24 about his sister with his mom and his grandma.<br>  <br>  Good Luck|`|prqrQcd1aa	I don't have a favorite child but i do have a child that takes up most of my time when she is home because she has a mental illness.

cvtYbKXXaa	Oh boy.  I don't mean to scare you, but this sounds like more than the flu.  The alternate constipation and diarrhea alone aren't of major concern unless it's causing damage (seeing small amounts of bright red blood? that's tissue damage) or dehydration from the diarrhea.  But the foul smell tells me there could very well be something else going on, and there are a few likely causes, one being Clostridium difficile.  Has baby been on antibiotics at some point?  This bacteria causes a form of colitis (inflammation of the colon).  An antibiotic that diminishes the normal colon flora may permit this bacteria to overgrow and cause problems in the intestines.    I would insist on a stool analysis myself.  This can be easily corrected, but must be diagnosed first.  Best of luck to you and your little one.|`|MMj7YcXkaa	definitly not food allergy.  children go through bouts of constipation and stuff.  is she getting enough water?  water shortage makes dehydration and constipation.

285c8243564acc36040f290206c3ff28aa	I think it's a mistake to have a child without marriage.  When you have to raise a baby alone, you never get an hour off, you never get time to yourself, and you have to financially provide.  Being single and a parent is much, much harder.  A man who will marry a woman will stick around and provide for the child and help raise it.  Kids do better when they have two caring parents.<br>  <br>  I think girls and women get this romantic notion that the baby will love them, forgetting that babies turn into toddlers and children and teenagers.  I wish more people would get married first and put off having kids until their marriages are more stable.  In fact, I wish it were illegal to have children before the age of 25!|`|WmKjeUELaa	I answered this, but you deleted it.  <br>  <br>  Anywho, like I said before, I think that if the parents of the child are in a steady relationship, meaning it wasn't just a one night stand or something, and they are in love, then why not get married?  If they aren't in love though, marriage isn't necessary as it will only confuse the kid later in life into thinking that marriage has nothing to do with love.|`|IDmaxViIaa	Yes you can have kids before your marrried i had 2 before i was married.

I think as long as you're loyal and support each other then it does not matter if you're married are not. Children thrive on happy families they don't care about a piece of paper. The only problem is if any one else as a problem with it, but I don't see why anyone would complain about a happy child living in a happy family married parents or not.<br>  <br>  p.s I am married|`|wfDzUSItaa	Not for nothing I know people who were planning on getting married until they saw what those child tax credits pay. They have 4 kids now and each claim 2 on their taxes talk about a win-fall, they just bought a new car, in cash, with their tax return and we're talking lower middle class income here. Just to think they still have at least 10 or 11 years of filing this way.|`|8RLGcshUaa	I think everyone is entitled to do what they think is right for them. Some people get pregnant on accident, and getting married to that person isn't right for them. Some people don't ever want to get married because it brings complications. A friend of mine just had a baby, and she is not with her past boyfriend. They are just going to do their own thing. I on the other hand got married and had a baby. We all do our own things as indivduals. I don't think there is a right or wrong answer here, especially in this day and age.|`|znnEJCZ3aa	I am 23 and have seen my fair share of marriages gone wrong. I personally do not believe in marriage. I have been with my boyfriend for four years and I know that I love him and want to spend the rest of my life with him. Getting a piece of paper that confirms that is not going to make it last any longer. One piece of paper doesnt prevent infidelity, growing apart or anything else. I dont understand the point. We are currently 3 months pregnant now and we couldnt be more happier. We have a house together and are very established for ourselves. Look at Kurt Russell and Goldie Hawn! Thy've been together for YEARS and have raised children together and dont see the need to marry. I really don't understand why people look down on people who are not married.  I have commited my life and myself to my boyfriend and I know within myself what that means I dont need a piece of paper to confirm it!|`|hJ69Aorgaa	Oh boy.....i don't think that couples should get married just because of a pregnancy.....and i don't think kids are happier coming out of a 2 parent household....i think that if being a single mother is what u got to work with then u just do the best job u can do....i am a single mother and my baby has no contact from the sperm donor....and i know that i have one of the happiest babies around.....and for the time off part of what that one response says, i have lots of time off....i have friends, and family that are willing to take my child when needed....it isn't like they think oh no ur a single parent so therefore no one will ever help u cuz u don't deserve it....|`|XNWqjgCuaa	<a href="http://innnanswers.freeallinsurance.com" rel="nofollow">http://innnanswers.freeallinsurance.com</a><br>  A very informative website, kindly stay in website and check|`|kEF6wuyzaa	I GOT PREGNANT AND IM NOT MARRIED, SO I THINK ITS OK, YOU SHOULDNT HAVE TO BE MARRIED JUST TO HAVE A WONDERFUL BUNDLE OF JOY! :)|`|4P3G4y0Saa	as long as u are commit ed together no marriage needed!|`|NaYb4CnGaa	i don't believe you should marry someone just because they are pregnant/or your pregnant with their baby. They would just set you up for a miserable life and if your that miserable then you won't be able to properly care for your child. It seems these days that pregnancy is a trend. I believe people should wait till they are married before they decided to have kids, but that's not how the world is today. Things with a child can be worked out to where both parents have equal time with the child. Don't marry just for the child it's not fair to you or the child.<br>  <br>  I'm also married, and expecting my first child. But my husband has a daughter by his ex- girlfriend, whom he never married.
ev8ZZYx2aa	It is not normal for a baby to have hard stools. You can try to give 1-2 ounces of water a day and see if this helps. I would talk to your pediatrician again because it is not normal for a baby to have hard stools.|`|rcXmEYoTaa	Defintely constipated. Give him his formulas but also give him more water to drink as well. Give him a couple of bottles of plain water a day and see if it improves|`|CiFR2xuBaa	I'd agree with the one that suggested gerber white grape or pear juice. It worked for my daughter, but another thing that "moved" her right away was gerber peaches.|`|jnLryjZpaa	1 teaspoon of orange juice in his bottle,,,works a treat!|`|qQJdi0p1aa	you can give him water...or gerber white grape juice or pear juice works really well for my son! and Its not normal for him to go every three or four days or have solid stool! have him rechecked|`|mIyUCey4aa	Buy some nursery water. If his bowels are coming in that hard he is a little dehydrated. If he needs flavor they have juice for babies at Babies R Us you can purchase.|`|8058fcf2650f54ecf2f7caea81639d08aa	my baby had the same problem a few weeks ago, she's 7 months old and she had two days that she would cry when she pooped. I just gave lots and lots more water and by day 3 she was okay again. I began putting more water in her rice cereal too.|`|3klIx1Egaa	a baby isnt considered constipated unless there stool is like rabbit poop. If its just hard, hes probably a little dehydrated, try giving him an ounce or 2 of water.
sLkruqYVaa	i started potty trainting my daughter when she was 20 months and it toulk about 2 weeks|`|DwFDF0A2aa	My husband and I go to the bathroom around my son and talk about what we are doing.  It has really sparked his interest in the potty.  He is a year and a half and goes pee and poop in the toilet almost every day.  I think that it is still too early to start him in training pants.  Two is an ideal age for children to learn potty training. <br>  I am a preschool teacher and feel that as long as children are potty trained by three, they are right on track.  Pull ups are easy but if your child is able to fully communicate with you, take the extra step and put him or her in underwear.  The accidents teach them cause and effect and help them understand that they are soiling their clothes as they relieve themselves.  <br>  It takes A LOT of patience and laundry, but can usually be done in a couple weeks to a month, give or take a few accidents.|`|MMj7YcXkaa	I started around 1 when he wanted to flush the toilet.  All I did was let him run naked.  When he peed, I would take him to the potty and tell him he is peeing and that it needs to go there.  by 2 he was going in the potty religiously peepee wise.  number 2 was a little harder.  He was not comfy sitting and pooping ( he loved to stand and pee in the toilet) and so he needed a diaper for that.  I never pressured him or disciplined him for going in a diaper.  By 2 1/2 he was pooping in the potty.  I have a 18 month old and he poops and pees in the potty.  so i guess it is different for each baby!|`|CJkrXeDgaa	As soon as my daughter started giving "signs" that she was about to poo, we started taking her to the potty.  Before she could even walk, we would watch that face get red and we would run with her to the potty.  <br>  It just helped her get accustomed to the potty and made that transition so easy.|`|dc500182581d351f03c845444a3479f5aa	Go find a book called   Potty training in a day.<br>  It work well for my kid and we started around 3 years old
4h4SNdGzaa	I wouldn't worry. While it's natural that you'd worry for your younger sister's welfare, it sounds very innocent & harmless. If it happens again and your sister wants to go out with a boy, perhaps you could take them along. It'd be good for your sister because she'd feel that her sister was taking an interest in her life, and it'd be good for you because it gives you peace of mind.<br>  <br>  But as the issue stands currently, I wouldn't worry about it. It's natural that your sister is going to start being interested in boys, and boys will be interested in her. You can't stop it. You can just keep an eye on it & ensure that everything's going as it should be. Hope that helps|`|XNc5moJEaa	I think 11 is young for dating. I agree with you about beginning to date your freshman year.  I just feel better decisions can be made when you reach a certain level of maturity. <br>  But it should really be left to the parents to decide.  Young dating can be very controlled by the parents because kids can't drive themselves anywhere.  So that way the parents  know exactly where their kids will be and what time they will be home.|`|utOVoGo3aa	Don't worry i'm in 8th grade, and in 6th grade everyone dated, it was never serious. You sister is fine, its normal, and relationships she will have will only last for about a week. It actually is important that she starts early because she needs practice for a real relationship. You are lucky that she is talking to you about this stuff because usually people keep it a Secret..|`|ThE1X2NHaa	yes it is hunny!!|`|uq0ga8bcaa	well maybe they should just be friends until shes old enough they should go out :D|`|gIT6xsz8aa	I guess it's okay for a little crush to be circulated around your sister's school, but they definitely shouldn't be rushing things. At your sister's time of age, her school work should really be her prioity. The kid who asked her out probably has an older brother drilling some girl facts into his head. I know having a boyfriend in school is cool in all, but you should be worried about her grades, behavior, and apperance if this BF thing really goes through. <br>  <br>  This site will really help:<br>  teenwire.com|`|lqIgEpg1aa	YES 11years old is WAY to young, I think your mother and yourself should be talking to her about boys. Appropriate age would be 18!!! In my minds a girl shouldnt date until she is 18 my first boyfriend wasn't until i was 18 in a half . so i think she should be tought the right way not the wrong way you don't want her to get pregnant by the age of 14 do you?<br>  <br>  <br>  OH my i can't believe my eyes people thinks that this is okay? NAw I don't think so if I had a daugher she would be in groups of some kind not thinking about boys and I think 13 and 14 is still young to date . Thats what happends people thinks that its SO cute for a "13 year old baby" to have puppy love until they experiment sex and get pregnant. GET IN THE REAL WORLD PEOPLE. thats why there is more teens getting pregnant these days because people thinks its okay to have puppy love when its not.|`|V7sfV5odaa	My Mom had a rule that I am gonna use for my kids,  No dating until your 16.    (Boy and Girl alone out together)<br>  <br>  That doesn't mean that they  can't like a boy/girl.  (Or go out in a group of friends)  <br>  <br>  Life go by way to fast to have the extra added pressure of dating at an early age.   If they know about the rule when they are young they will know that they won't have to have to stress about dating. <br>  <br>  They will also have something to look forward to...at 16!|`|F80jKUvYaa	In 6th grade and stuff like that is fine. This isn't a real relationship. This is a puppy love crush it always happens with young kids. If she likes someone and she says yes it'd be fine. It's a little cute puppy love thing that as I said all kids go through. And it's nothing to worry about it's not "Serious."|`|b8B0gXDmaa	6th grade is too Young i think that 17 years old and older is the age to be having a boyfriend if your going to have one its nice to have friends that's the opposite sex from you though.|`|VBCxQo8taa	If she doesnt do anything too serious, then there isnt anything wrong with it. 6th grade relationships arent anything too serious.|`|YHcOS0Sfaa	13 is good, but in todays world, I know Kindergardeners with boyfriends. In fact, I know Kindergardeners that are players, LOL.|`|USbujSnCaa	i am 13 and have had no one ask me and u know wat im happy i am still very young i dont need this now and yeah it is very young!!! she shud wait! let her live her life the right way!!! LOL! :D|`|H2V0wLbqaa	Going out in 6th Grade means nothing. It's funny because they'll go to the movies once or twice and then be over each other. Nothin' to worry about :D|`|Y2VYcoboaa	6th grade is fine, thats when i had my first|`|kEuVNTm1aa	i wouldnt be that concerned.<br>  <br>  but it depends on how old HE is.|`|r9ZoFpt1aa	I was asked out in 6th and 7th grade and it didnt bother me. It isnt like it is serious, in school they just announce that they are dating but nothing serious. The appropriate age that I think serious dating should start at is somewhere in the beginning of highschool.|`|GHnlSddKaa	She is definitely too young. The best age? Maybe in high school, when  she is 14-15. And I mean just going out, not having sex at 14-15.|`|AA10782309	well<br>  these days, i know 4th graders who are dating. it is pretty young, but its pretty common. just make sure things dont go too far. at this age, they wont be doing anything much anyways.|`|L5EXJnyzaa	Well, Its probably not too serious. Hugging, Holding hands , got my first kiss, at 11-13 (: So Its alright. as long as she's safe ?|`|aOCfLAJJaa	I think it's OK.<br>  <br>  tabi8407: he isn't the father, it's BASIC COMMON SENSE.|`|6Tpa4MXSaa	I dunno<br>  <br>  I strongly doubt it'd be a "serious relationship". Besides, it's cute.<br>  <br>  But oh well. She said no anyways.|`|qYZ2QFlbaa	Well. I hate to say it.... but some kids do have sex at the age of 11. Did you hear about that couple in UK that the boy is 12 (looks 8) and the girl 16 that had a baby? I'm  not saying your sister will, but you have to be aware.|`|aAj4dSyuaa	Well, to tell you the truth, I always felt there was no suck thing as dating in middle school. I think once you're a freshman you can start dating. But then again, I've never had a date. Maybe I'm just jealous.|`|c751f373c4b93a676106632ee074769aaa	11 is wayyyy to young to be going "out" with someone|`|XuFmnqSpaa	Eighth or freshman. mostly freshman. i gotta wait until im in sophomore summer! 16!!! ahhh|`|ujTH92cyaa	11 is too young! id say bout 14-15 and im 13 soo.....|`|pZu6Mk42aa	11 is a little young. plus how do you "go Out" at 11?|`|N1Wc8JPTaa	6th grade definately isn't too young to have a boyfriend. Usually at that age it's just fun and games when you go out with someone, nothing serious. But, if said no then she must not really want to go out with him and she shouldn't just say yes because she feels sorry for him. If she does want to go out with someone then she should, 11 is definately old enough but don't let her be pressured into it.|`|g52eSE06aa	Maybe he did it for a dare. When I was 11, the boys would play a game where they would spin the bottle and whoever it landed on, they had to ask out. But, a lot of the "players" of the game were unaware they were playing. I was asked to marry some one but I said you're not really my type, I'm staying single for now. Some 11 year olds go out on dates just I suppose topractisee for adult years. This could be the Disney Channel's fault, they always have 11, 12, 13 and 14 year olds dating and kissing. She should just keep saying no, he will probably give up. Just see how it goes over the next while and then you both can decide what to do.|`|692c8795f68a0ba95a0d09139d70c98caa	I had my first  "boyfriend"  in 5th grade, it wasnt serious, we would hold hands an sit next to each other on the bus.. and after school we played outside and rode our bikes.  Its innocent at that age.|`|xdnZd7WBaa	a lot of kids that age go out on dates but it's nothing real. just infatuation and going to the movies and holding hands. i wouldnt be worried about it!|`|CV8KIpIxaa	Well.. honestly let her have fun. Im sure its not going to be a serious relationship until shes older. I was in 6th grade when i had my first boyfriend and it wasnt really a boyfriend.|`|15jfF0tKaa	Please inform your mom.
HKKg2Vhxaa	Woah. huge difference. like they're different species.|`|CSzDV3gEaa	i think there is a difference. when girls are 10 they are still kind of immature. what i mean by this is most 10 year old girls still like to play childs games and watch cartoons etc. i'm not saying older kids don't do that but most 10 year olds think of that as very normal. i think when girls are 11 it depends because i was in elementary school at 11 because my elementary school went to 6th grade. when girls are 11 they feel more mature for some reason like they are so close to being teens and they have been double digits for over a year. at 12 that is when girls become kind of stupid and confused. at 13 some things are figured out but they are now teens and learning more life skills.|`|KbPrPuvhaa	no theres a huge difference, i acted way different during that time.|`|mfBkH3qtaa	There is a difference between 10-13 MOST of the times.

I like to look at old IMs and see how stupidly I talked :]|`|tKMrzW9Caa	I don't think that there is a drastic difference, no. However, I do think that there is a small difference.

I don't mean to offend anyone or make generalizations but a lot of girls at this age try to manipulate people (especially guys) by using their looks.|`|RALpRu54aa	The 5th graders are more mature. At least they're not into all that regular teen nonsense yet. They don't even know what it means.

R3OV3TJeaa	This is what happens when families have 3 or 4 children. I grew up with 3 children and it wasn't fun. My little brother got all the attention our whole life. I was always resentful that my parent's had another child since they already had 2 kids. I would never have 3 children. I too agree, that families get too big. So many people can't have even 1 child and other people just keep on pushing them out when they already have a couple kids.|`|prqrQcd1aa	I just answered a question similar to this.. My oldest daughter gets much of my attention when she is not in school because she has a mental illness. I spend as much time with the 2 younger ones while she is in school to make up for it. As the oldest of 5 kids, i do see my own mother treating the youngest way way way way differently than the rest of us were and are still ever treated. I think it is fairly common to happen this way when the ages are so far apart with the first and last child, then you get the rational going that this IS going to be the last child, so you may treat them a little differently than the rest, baby them more, allow them to get away with things the oldest or even middle child isn't allowed to even think about getting away with. It kinda sucks for the other kids if they see it happening, but honestly i think it's just part of human nature!|`|Kl1h5dCaaa	My last baby is actually Babies (twins).<br>  <br>  I do feel I am soaking up their babyhood more than I did with our Elder Sons. I know they are my last, and our actual youngest of the 2 has had a rough start to life.<br>  I don't see any problem with it, I still love playing with our Elder boys, and the adventures I have with them. But I am taking more in knowing there is no more.|`|KNxs4PrZaa	i think it would be prefectly normal to savor your last baby,  i have always heard people say that the baby of the family gets the attention and is spoiled, it was true in my family, i have no doubt that you are wonderful to all of your kids, you probably are just knowing that this is the last time you will see all of those cute baby things.  plus he is 2.5 so he obviously needs closer attention just because of his age, i am sure you watched closely when your others were young but its been a long time.|`|eY8b5fBRaa	yep! I have 2 others and I do the same with my third....  Same reasons too. I know now how fast their babyhood goes by now and I just want to keep it and remember it as long as I can. With my 1st, I couldn't wait for him to do stuff..... But with my baby, I cried the other day when he rolled over for the 1st time. LOL|`|JivuAmfiaa	I asked a question like this a couple of days ago, I do exactly the same thing. It's like you want them to never grow up and stay with you forever isn't it?|`|UwT0TXU6aa	i am the youngest i have an older brother and when we were little my mom paid more attention to my brother and my dad paid more attention to me. i think parents tend to pick favorites sometimes, but other times its hard when you have a 2 yr old a 9 yr old and a 12 yr old. I think it is good to pay attention to a young child they need the nurturing from you but make sure your other children do not feel left out. if i were you id set a day aside every once in a while to perhaps just spend a few hours with just the older ones. and i would do it seperately also.  good luck.|`|RJ20ezDOaa	I know you are a great mother simply by your concern of feeling differently about the last baby. Here is my thought. <br>  Your first two were born over nine years ago.  I believe both of those children enjoyed all the attention at the age of 2 that you now shower on the youngest.  Your care is appropriate and the older would not like to be showered with so much attention at their respective ages. <br>  In other words, keep up the good work and love on the little one as much|`|AA12245468	Hmm. I'm not aware of showing any special favoritism to my son who's now 5, who is my last child. I did show some favoritisim to my third daughter, my first biological child.<br>  I think if anyone was favored by mom, it was her first born.<br>  <br>   I was the baby in my family and my mom spoiled the heck out of me even though I had three brothers and a sister.|`|11kuwaOEaa	I would say I didn't treat my children the same at all.  I just have two, so first and last, so far.  Considering I had no plans to have another, my youngest has been babied her whole life.  I breastfed her longer, let her sleep in bed with me longer, little things like that.  My firstborn was just as spoiled, though in different ways.  He is such a mama's boy now for it though, and I wonder if I did the right thing to baby him like I did.<br>  <br>  Growing up, though, I was the oldest of three from my mom and 4 from my dad.  My younger siblings are totally spoiled rotten and favored by my parents and it is very obvious.  It doesn't affect me negatively like it does my brother who was the second child of both parents.  It is what it is, you never know how anything exactly will affect your kids.  They are all so different and allthough I wasn't favored by my parents, I was and still am by my grandparents. It all evened out for us....that is, of course except for my brother.<br>  <br>  In retrospect, when it was just my one brother and I, my parents had lots of time for things like coaching little league and homemade birthday cakes.  With the younger ones, it seems like its all about how much money they can and do spend.  I much prefer my upbringing. :)
sgEpyZUxaa	That's a pretty fair indication of something in there.

If it is a longer cycle then you aren't as late and obviously if it is a shorter cycle then you are even later.|`|IGcS9K62aa	about 2 weeks|`|U33q6Xlnaa	you would be about 10-12 days late depending on your cycle length.
AA11538461	My first labor was 19 hours; my second one was 15.  I never pushed at all with the second one.  She was born in the car.  My fourth labor was the longest; it was 33 hours.|`|kBqxRuPLaa	My mom has always told me that my birth was harder for her (I am the second born.) With my older brother, she was in labor for 4 hours. With me, 8. I suppose it's just different with every person.|`|HEdGGmkhaa	roughly 6 hours from active labor (4-5 cm's)<br>  20 mins pushing!|`|CiFR2xuBaa	In my case, my 2nd labor was 8 hours longer than the 1st,  a total of 19 hours.|`|EMKuBql8aa	My wife's 2nd labor was cut in half, it was 12 hours literally from start to finish. She pushed about the same amount of time, a little less (5 min. less) only 15 min.|`|Yyqhbyoiaa	First child was 21hrs labour, 10Min's pushing.<br>  Second child was was 6 1/2hrs labour, 2Min's pushing.<br>  Third child was 2 1/2hrs labour to pushing point and ended up with emergency c-section at 35 weeks.<br>  <br>  Last child's labour was worse cause I felt like I wanted to push but the umbilical cord was to short to let him come down.
7AYnWg3paa	i was ure weight when i got preggo and im 5'2.....maybe thats not the problem.....i got preggo on the first try as well...now of course i weigh a little more due to the pregnancy|`|4rV15ZYuaa	Honestly, I would tell you to consult with your doctor before starting to try. He/She will be able to give you more guidelines and help you set healthy goals based on your body. What's good for one may not be good for another :-)|`|9ZaoTkwwaa	It depends on how overweight you are.  Some things say that you may not gain any weight- if you eat like you're supposed to maybe you lose fat as you gain baby weight.?  I don't know- i'm pregnant now and overweight and haven't gained much the first 12 or 13 weeks anyways (haven't been to the doctor to be weighed since then).  I think it's because i have been trying to eat better.  It all depends on the person though and how you control what and how much you eat.  You should never diet when pregnant but you do need to make sure you get plenty of dairy, veggies, fruit...  So by doing that, you may stay the same for a while, and not gain too much.  Also, i started eating total recently, which has 100% of the calcium, vit.d, folic acid... which you need especially early on when everything is starting to form.|`|UVwRSpDjaa	I was "over weight" when I got pregnant and the doctors told me from the begining that you can gain 10 lbs and have a healthy baby. I gained 15 lbs and my son weighed 10lbs. You just need to eat healthy and not a lot. It's possible to not gain much if your already heavy. Skinny people are required to gain more.|`|HCmAoNjzaa	Do you know your BMI (Body Mass Index)? I would try and figure that out first. You should only gain 25-30 lbs during pregnancy.<br>  <br>  Okay your BMI is 30.2. They would  recommend you lose 28 pounds to fall within the healthy weight range.|`|sL6WzMPraa	its called doctor|`|Gmsmn5HYaa	you are not 'really overweight'. i am 255 pounds and we're trying to get pregnant too and my doctor said that though being in better shape/being 'less fat' would be better for me and a baby, at 31 i should just get going on it.<br>  <br>  losing weight is a good thing though before you get pregnant. just don't diet at all while you are pregnant. if you eat healthy and eat only what you need to eat healthy, you may lose some weight anyway or at the very least will gain much less weight than a thin person who is pregnant. you may gain as little as 10-15 pounds and still have gained enough to have a healthy baby.|`|05gBNxJcaa	Well...ok first of all you need a diet of food that makes <br>  you more fertile. Unfortuantley it's a strict diet.<br>  skinless chicken breast or fishlow fat meats, veggies and fruit..and one slice of diet bread a day. <br>  you can also have things that dont have more than 3gr sugar, low sodium, low fat, low cal, high protien. I used to be on this diet and the healthcare place warned me it makes people very fertile.<br>  well i got preggers very soon after. so just try it for a month at the same time u are trying to conceive.<br>  also...alot of people actually loose weight at first in their pregnancy and gain about 25-50 lbs. so maybe doing that diet before the pregnancy will do u some good if u dont want to get bigger.|`|U33q6Xlnaa	It depends on your diet and if/how much you exercise. The recommended amount of weight gain is: under weight 25-30 lbs.,healthy weight 20-25 lbs., over weight 15-20 lbs.,obese 15 lbs or less. But it really does depend on diet and exercise I have faith in you though. You can do it.|`|0rBEqVtHaa	i'd try to lose it before you get pregnant but then again you'll gain that weight once you get pregnant so maybe just try to enjoy yourself and worry about losing weight after you have the baby
aqto0hJTaa	It worked for me the 2nd month.  Good luck to you!|`|WBw9lDG8aa	i dont know im burly going to start taking clomid 50 mg next month but from the researches i've done it usally will get u pg's on the 2nd or 3rd round of clomid well if everything goes good well good luck.|`|bWyKAFwuaa	Generally if it doesn't work in three cycles it doesn't work...so typically by the third cycle|`|9ZaoTkwwaa	I have PCOS and had to use some of the same things.  I had to use the progesterone and Clomid, but along with those, we did 2 IUI's.. one on the friday, but it didn't look like my eggs had released so they gave me a shot in the butt (i don't know what medicine that was) and we did another IUI on the following monday.  My dr said with all this, and 1 good egg for sure plus a maybe egg, i had a 35% chance!  So $1250 later, plus a ton of dr appt copays, i figured it wouldn't happen and we'd have to try again later.  But it worked for us the first time.  I had wonderful drs- my infertility dr was researching in PCOS so she knew more than other people might have.  Also, my dr said to have sex every 2-3 days since that will give the sperm the highest concentration and not be old.  That's what she said, that's what we did, and it worked!  Good luck and if you have any questions, email me!  But keep in mind, this is not typical, and i'm a believer in the whole as soon as you give up it will happen theory!|`|Boubyng3aa	Although i can not tell you that i have got pregnant on clomid, i know where you are coming from. My hubby and i have been ttc for over 19 months now, and i have pcos. I too start clomid soon, this tuesday coming ( i cant wait to get started) we have waited so long. I have researched it a lot, and most of people i have read about have gotten pregnant within the first 3 cycles. More then you would think have gotten pregnant on their first cycle. I hope it works for both of us on our first cycle. You should be able to find out by april 2nd, they will most likely do a blood test, and they detect low amounts of hcg, so they can detect pregnancy earlier then a urine test. Best of luck and TONS of baby dust.
AA10792249	Congratulations! Your doctor will be the one to give you that answer. I'd go to a clinic that's open on the weekend or a minute clinic at CVS with those questions. Take the test with you. Not sure what causes false-positives. You have to remember, when I was having babies - there wasn't such a thing as buying a pregnancy test. At that time, some doctors still used the rabbit test. The way the rabbit test worked, your blood was injected into a rabbit & if the rabbit died, it meant you were pregnant. They'd do a urine test & the blood test for confirmation. I know folic acid is important to the growth of a baby. Assuming you're a health woman, should you miscarry, it's just how it was meant to be. I would imagine in the days before all this ultra testing, there were many, many miscarriages that nobody knew about. I think you're excited since this is your first & your husband has other children maybe so is looking at this through different eyes. That's how it's been with my husband's daughter & her husband. He's 15 years older than her & has children that are 9 &11 years younger than her. He's more relaxed & she was over the top. It's just how it is honey. Being older than you & having had children before will likely make him a better, more involved father. Good luck!|`|kEF6wuyzaa	I TOOK THREE PREGNANCY TESTS AND THEY ALL SAID POSITIVE AND I WAS PREGNANT, I HAVENT HEARD VERY MANY PEOPLE SAY THEY HAD A FALSE POSITIVE, LIKE MAYBE 1 IN 100 ARE, I WOULD SAY TRY AGAIN IN A FEW DAYS, WHY WOULD YOU WANT TO MISCARRY IN THE NEXT FEW WEEKS??|`|YnLqItJPaa	False negatives happen all the time...  False positives, not so much.  So you're definitely pregnant.<br>  <br>  As far as the chances you'll miscarry...  If it's going to happen, it will likely happen before 13 weeks.  However, if you haven't miscarried before and are healthy, your chances of doing so are relatively low, so try not to worry!  Let yourself celebrate a little! (Or a lot!)|`|4rV15ZYuaa	The chance that it is a false positive is VERY low :-) <br>  <br>  Without knowing your history of pregnancies and miscarriage's hard to tell but just to be safe, go ahead and make a dr. apoappointment and tell them you just got your first positive on a test (YIPPEE!) The dr. will be able to check hormone levels and all kinds of stuff to ensure to the best of their capabilities that you do not miscarry.<br>  <br>  Best Wishes!|`|mgiJVjaKaa	False positives are very rare. *very* rare. You can test again in a few days to confirm the result - or do like I did and test again every few days for a week before it completely sank in!<br>  <br>  Don't stress about miscarrying.  Just stay healthy, eat like you should, take your vitamins, and relax!! <br>  <br>  Congrats!|`|AA10916164	Congrats ! False positives are a rarity, so most likely, you are pregnant ! Thanks giving will be a fun time for your little Turkey ! Wait a week and take another just to be sure.|`|kBqxRuPLaa	False negatives are completely rare! And I wish I could say, but no one truly knows when someone is going to miscarry or not. But Congratulations, mommy!|`|706fa9fa645a352ed4dc9e7315894893aa	well you could always take another test in a few days or go to the doctors. Good Luck!
692c8795f68a0ba95a0d09139d70c98caa	I took my baby out into the world when she was a week old, we went out to eat and a friends house.  I also took her with me everyday to pick up my son from school, that was a pain though because i had to protect her from tons of little hands wanting to touch her lol..  i love taking her out, i want to show her off!  :)  As long as you use common sense and dont let strangers touch her hands or face its fine.  Baby cereal is ok to give after 12 weeks,babty food they say wait until 6 months and table food aftter 9 months..  but everyone does it different and doctors suggestions vary.  Your the mommy and know whats best!  Congrats on the baby to be!|`|1U7yLEf9aa	All the doctors I have talked to and what I have seen in books is............ After 6weeks you can take the baby out. Cereal in the bottle after 3months ONLY RICE CEREAL and not alot just a little to thicken up the milk. Then at 4 or 5 months you can give the baby cereal from a spoon and start on 1st stage green baby food. Green beans, peas..... Then after that you can start on orange then after that, yellow.  Then you move up on the stages of baby food. You should use the gerber toddler graduate food after that. It's the healthiest for the baby.  As far as snacks, you can do cut up soft fruit, cheerios and well just look down the baby aisle and there are all kinds of thinks. Good luck and congratulations!!!|`|Y4ZjGCr4aa	Babies can usually eat cereal and baby food around 7-8 months, and they can probably start eating table food around 2 years.|`|ev8ZZYx2aa	It is best to wait until after 6 weeks before taking the baby on errands. They can start to eat cereal at 6 months of age. Table food can start around 8 months (soft).|`|AA12299637	You can take your baby out as soon as you feel comfortable doing so.  there is no hard and fast rule. I took my son out after 1 or 2 days to meet family. As long as you are careful and take good care of them it is fine. And the child will let you know when they are ready for cereal and other food. When milk no longer fills them up for any amount of time, you can add just a bit of cereal to the milk in the bottle. You will gradually increase the amount of cereal, and than move to food.  No hurry.
SxPhldhhaa	In my opinion, it's better suited as a nickname than a real name. Also, a girl named L.C will most likely end up adopting a name with the initials L.C. eventually because a set of initials as a first name may not always be accepted in applications and such. Johnny Cash was born J.R Cash and ended up using John as his first name to use on applications and such.<br>  <br>  I'd suggest using it as a nickname for a name with the initials of L.C., such as Lillian Claire or Layla Charlotte (or any other name you like), or spelling it as Elsie to avoid confusion. L.C is cute and unique, but can also be confusing and strange.|`|Elxuvon8aa	lc is not a name it is initials|`|xv3opX9Maa	Elsie<br>  ( =|`|nSJ6q5SQaa	The other spelling would be Elsie, but if you are naming her, say, Lauren Catherine, I think it's fine.<br>  <br>  In my fourth grade class, there was a bunny named L.C. The teacher liked to shop and L.C. is the intitials of one of the malls near here. It's what I thoughtj of when I saw this....|`|rdGQMSyjaa	Maybe if it's a nickname for Elsa. Possibly with the nickname Elsie? Or perhaps as initials. You could use something like:<br>  <br>  Lindsey Karoline<br>  Lillian Klare<br>  Laura Katherine<br>  Lisa Koraline<br>  etc.<br>  <br>  Good luck! :)|`|34VXCyvVaa	No, it's not a name.  It's just initials.  That's like saying, "Is N.C. a good name for a state?"|`|CxRJwJsraa	I'd prefer it as a nic like for Lila Christine.<br>  <br>  or spelled Elsie.|`|QCIQP3Kbaa	No...ever heard of Lauren Conrad. I know that LC isn't her first name..but that's what everyone calls her...why not make her initials L C..or spell it diffently..like Ellsee or something like that<br>  <br>  but then I again, i guess it is your kid and you can name her whatever you'd like =)|`|sVPToYvKaa	I like it, it's different.<br>  It reminds me of LC [lauren conrad] from Laguna Beach & The Hills.<br>  She was pretty too!<br>  <br>  I wouldn't mind being called LC <3|`|BjDJfagmaa	I personally don't like it-the initials should stand for a name and maybe LC can be a nickname|`|tGGVeW3yaa	No, you could at least give your child's name some character|`|ot0TqzSvaa	i kinda like it.<br>  <br>  unusual.|`|XQe8rlH7aa	it's definitely unique.|`|FslUZLsyaa	i totally agree w/ P o p c o r n !|`|qTWIoVEraa	They are my two first initials, so the name is awesome! <br>  But I'd suggest something like "Elsie" if you're after that pronunciation. However, it reminds me of Elsie the Cow, the mascot to the Borden company.<br>  <br>  Naming a kid after a cow seems kinda screwy, to be honest. So maybe not ^^"|`|uSpHh1NPaa	Ellsy ... not L.C - people will get confused and its just silly.<br>  <br>  Ellsee.<br>  Ellsi<br>  Elsi<br>  <br>  they are some acceptable spellings.|`|Sob4zaUSaa	I like it. It's like Lauren Conrad:) I think Lauren Claire or Leah Cecille would be pretty.<br>  <br>  <br>  :DDDD|`|0sbhjGiraa	Ellcey|`|ctra63V6aa	I don't like initials for names. Just call her Elsie
hNr3GFvlaa	I imagine you are frustrated because you need some privacy and the members of your family do not seem interested in cooperating. Maybe you can try to convey to them how you feel (startled, etc.) when someone storms into your room, giving them a few concrete exampled of what happened.<br>  <br>  I would think that your sister sees that room as her own to some extend and maybe you can explain to her that it's not so much about the territory but how startling and uncomfortable you feel when someone storms into the room. <br>  <br>  Enforcing a rule is really difficult if people don't understand what you really need. If you can communicate what's going on for you then maybe (maybe!) they can see it not just as a pain in the neck, but as a way to be kind to you.<br>  <br>  Your chances in this situation are not very high so know that if you don't get what you want it's not because of you but rather the complexity of so many relationships in such a little space.|`|SbWXmrXiaa	ummmmm if shes sharing it cuz she wants to, not bcuz ur parents allow it, then kick her out and ya.|`|IDmaxViIaa	I really find that un-fare i mean i'm 25 and have 5 kids. Chelsey Lee Glittier (5), Annabella Maree Glittier (3), Rina malisha Glittier (1 year old twin with Lisa)        Lisa Shania Glittier (1 year old twin with rina) And I’ve just had my daughter Alisha Olivia-rose Glittier on the 8th of February. And i let chelsey and Annabella have there privacy and there only 5 and three that sucks man your parents are like so un-fair. Say i'm going through puperty and my boobs are big ok so ******* get out of my ******* room ok. Juat say that and see if it helps i mean gosh and hay there's always that spare room in grandmar's house hahaha maby you can see if you can like live or stay in the spare room or make your sister your the oldest you should get the first words not ya dumb 11 year old sister gosh. And if ya grandmother doesn't have a spare room then there's always her bathroom. Just a tip: If you have any trees out side climb them ans like stay in there so you can be alone. HAHAHAHAHA sorry i should'nt be telling you this stuff cause i'm 25 and have 5 girls anyways hope it helps. Lola xxxxxoooo|`|aac7c6d4d79683e9cae0fe6a541bbccdaa	Well, you should adjust to your living arrangements.  Change in the bathroom, not your bedroom-that way noone can walk in on you.<br>  <br>  No, your sister should not have to knock on the door, even if she does not sleep in there since it is technically her room as well.  And, no-your parents should not HAVE to knock because technically it is THEIR room and they just allow you to use it.  However, common courtesy would be for them to knock.<br>  <br>  Have you asked them about it without having an attitude/temper tantrum?  How about leaving the door open when you do not need privacy, and then asking them to knock if it is closed.  That is the best I can suggest, since your room opens into your grandmother's house (I do not understand that).<br>  <br>  And, at 16-I am sure you can figure out how to hang the curtains back up.<br>  <br>  EDITED TO ADD:  In order to become emancipated, as another answer suggested you could, you would have to go in front of a judge.  You would first have to have a good reason (abuse/neglect) and you would have to prove that you are self sufficient.  Living with a friend or relative does not count, you would have to prove that you could find a place to live and pay for your rent, utilities, groceries, etc.  You would have to have a job to do so, and the judge would laugh if you suggested dropping out of school to get a job.<br>  <br>  However, I do have a suggestion.  Since you ARE 16, and since you say your sister does not use the room really-perhaps you could work out an arrangement with your parents to pay rent, and in exchange have privacy.  It is worth a try.|`|jERh0J2faa	16 is not a child you are adolescent and deserve some respect you don't automatically go from child to adult at your 18th birthday party. Anyway just talk to them about it and technically since your over 15 you can divorce your parents and live on your own, its legal.|`|F6lZHRkVaa	Well technically if your sister "shares" the room in any capacity at all then she does have a right to come in without knocking.<br>  <br>  I never had any privacy growing up though myself. My husband was one of four siblings and he never got any privacy either. The only place you could be alone was in the bathroom. Try hanging those curtains back up for a bit of privacy. Good luck!|`|1s3nddaYaa	i don't think that is fair either. tell them how you feel. write a letter to them if you have to. tell them that you want privacy. or if they are gonna use that door knock 1st cuz you do get dressed. it is your room. i say a letter would work. that way you can express how you really feel and they can read it. she doesn't use the room, she should store her stuff somewhere else

bzkSIJYnaa	Great list, Noelle! It's hard to choose three! <br>  Let's see, I'll pick - Jesse, Roman and Jude. I rate them all 10/10 and they are on my favorites list as well. <br>  <br>  Jesse - Jesse is one of my favorite names. For some reason, I love J names for boys. I think Jesse is very masculine sounding, despite what a lot of people think. And I know this sounds a bit silly, but I think it's a very sexy name! It also has a bit of a rough, bad boy/outlaw image going for it. Think Jesse James. I don't know much about him, just that he was an outlaw. Here's the Wikipedia page on him, if you are interested <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jesse_James" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jesse_James</a><br>  <br>  Roman - I think Roman is such a cool name. It has this vintage/ancient charm to it,  but manages to feel totally modern at the same time. <br>  <br>  Jude - Jude is a great name! I tend to have him as a middle name on my list (my favorite combo is Nicholas Jude) I love the "feel" Jude has. It sounds strong AND soft at the same time, which is pretty cool. I can never decide if it's soft or strong, so I decided it was both. Great, underused, Biblical name|`|IuzaNq2Uaa	Blake: Because of my beloved William Blake. I wanted to use this as a middle name.<br>  <br>  Rowan:  I think this is just gorgeous; would also pick this as a middle because I think it would get confused with similar names, such as Ronan.<br>  <br>  Xander:  I love this name, but it's a guilty pleasure for me as well, because (like pretty Chloe) where I live this has become a really down-market name and would unfortunately "place" a child too readily.|`|y9TVkzQYaa	* Davian- I think this name is very cute!! I think it would sound good with the middle name Shaynne(Shane). I think you should add it to your actual list! lol <br>  <br>  *Kaden- I really like this name. It is actually on my list!! lol I think it sounds good with the name James. So.. Kaden James.<br>  <br>  *Mason- I also really like the name Mason. Mason Carter or Mason Alexander sound really cute together.|`|gNUQ0CDtaa	Blake, Tanner, & Mason!!! <br>  <br>  <br>  I love those names! I think they r great!|`|PNMxbktAaa	Jesse --- I really like J names for guys. I think Jesse is a little more unique then some other J names.<br>  Jude --- This is just a great name and it's not to popular, so that's always god. It's simple, and classic, and if your a Beatles fan that makes it even better!<br>  Xander --- I've always loved this name. It's the name of a character in my favorite show, and it's unique, because there isn't a lot of X names, but not over the top.|`|T0pkW783aa	Blake<br>  Rogan<br>  Mason<br>  <br>  I chose these three names because they are different and I personally like the way they sound.  I have always wanted to use Blake for a middle name and love the sound of Rogan Blake.  Mason is another name that I like which isn't used too often.  I like names that are strong, masculine and different from the rest.  All three of these names suit my tastes favorably.|`|nSJ6q5SQaa	In order from best to last.<br>  Aubrey -- I like Elizabethan names, and this is one.<br>  Bradley -- I have known a Bradley and he was super sweet. <br>  Mason -- Sounds nice.

I absolutely love it.<br>  <br>  Harrison - I have always loved this name. I never hear it around and adore the nickname Harry - once again a very masculine, sophisticated name. Love it.<br>  <br>  Kaiden - Very nice name, I love the way its spelt (compared to Kayden and all other ways I've seen it). Very cute, modern name.<br>  <br>  I love all 3 of these names, infact, they are my top 3 favourite boys names.|`|ot0TqzSvaa	Blake - This is a really strong boys name. All the Blakes i have ever met are very out going and have good character. Its a very cool name i reckon. :)<br>  <br>  Ryland - this name is alright, but i LOVE Rylan (without the 'd') Rylan is awesome because its kind of trendy, but he would never grow out of it. I have never met a Rylan but i imagine them to be very strong and popular. :)<br>  <br>  Xander - this one isnt as strong as the rest, but i still love it. Its really sweet and reminds me of a very nice personality and lots of smiles. The name suits a little boy, and an adult, but in his teens-twenties maybe he will need a nickname like 'Zan' or just 'X.'<br>  <br>  btw, i like Jude too, and Channing and Mason for middle names are cool as well...<br>  (Blake Channing, Xander Mason, Rylan Marcus)<br>  and Oliver is one of my fave names so maybe u like that one?<br>  <br>  hope i helped!|`|XQe8rlH7aa	The following are the three names I love and why:<br>  * Channing - a rare first name, it would be very unique and it means official of the church<br>  Zacharaih - biblical name, he was a prophet in the bible<br>  Harrision - because I like Harrison Ford...smile<br>  <br>  Good Luck on choosing the perfect name for your baby.|`|AXEp1Bu6aa	Bradley - I've always liked this name, it sounds really masculine.<br>  Jesse - I have liked it ever since I read Bridge to Terabithia and the character in Gilmore Girls, I like it's nickname Jess.<br>  Mason - I have just recently started to like this name and I think it's really cool and masculine.|`|RMYvrn1Qaa	Jude - I love the Beatles.

It gives an air of fun that is still serious.  I really like it.<br>  <br>  Blaine -- I really like the flow of this name.  It sounds a bit more sophisticated than Blaise and still has an air of fun.  It leads me to think of sports, it sounds like the name of a very active and well-liked person.  I would think of it almost as a good omen for the childs future--health, wealth and happiness.<br>  <br>  Edward -- This name has a classic style.  It's not a very common first name anymore, it gives the child a chance to really grow into himself.  It has a preppy but still sporty and masculine feel.  It's a very nice name.|`|1dHe0Hfdaa	Austin<br>  Blake <br>  Blair|`|Oxp6jWAnaa	i would choose<br>  Preston<br>  Robert<br>  Edward|`|Elxuvon8aa	Derrik Marcus and Trevor  jumped out first|`|nAXmkl3Zaa	Rowan LOVE, LOVE, LOVE, IT!!!<br>  Jesse VERY cute<br>  Derrek is REAL cute!
MMj7YcXkaa	Sounds like it to me.  I had most of the same symptoms as you.  talk to your DR.  tell them all your symptoms listed.  ask for someone to take the baby for 6 hours.  pump ahead of time so he will have his milk.  pump before  you sleep.  take a couple benedryl(you can take this while BF) and hit the sack.  If you dont have anyone to help(I didn't)  Don't panic!   you need to get your baby on a sched.  this will regulate his sleeping and eating patterns so you can function a bit better.|`|pZg05uygaa	For the first two weeks after your baby's birth, it's normal to be crying for no reason and feel really up and down. After two weeks, it's considered postpartum depression, which wont go away on its own. If you continue feeling moody, sad, restless, have trouble sleeping, etc, after two weeks, seek help immediately. Call your OB or midwife (whoever you saw for prenatal care) or a counselor. If you feel like this is too hard and you can't get yourself to do it, have your husband/partner/mom/friend call for you. <br>  If it's been less than two weeks, get help taking care of yourself and reevaluate in a few days. Talk to someone who is a good listener about the guilt you've experienced about your induction.|`|irGE84Qdaa	u kno what its pretty normal and it can goaway by itself if u make a lil effort to make urself feel better yh here is a question how to make urself feel better when i had my 1st baby i use to be like that and me n my husband had turn to feed him putting him on bed and changing diaper and slowly slowly i got use to it and times goes by but if its not in ur control and u had depression b4 then definitely u need some medicine i m right now in depression and i have severe anxiety and i dont take medicine for that cuz i feel better when i talk to someone my friend or if i go out and i have severe mood change that i dont kno whats going on with me so thats why m saying just try to relax and it will pass in 2 week or so talk to ur friend or anyone even talk to ur DR or husband boyfriend anyone may be u feel better thats how if not then u need medicine.<br>  i hope u feel better hun.|`|a03b0b5014fce6dc67440fe39f59a44aaa	You probably do have postpartum depression i did and its VERY normal. I know things are rough right now and you dont know what to do you feel like you cant do it anymore, but you can things WILL get better you may not notice it cause its just a little at a time. Babies go through stages where they dont sleep and keep you up but you got to remeber they also go through stages where they sleep sleep sleep. once your baby is on a schedule you'll be back to normal. I really do hope things get better soon :) congradulations.|`|PymLdXM8aa	Depends on how long ago  you had the baby. Generally speaking they say that postpartum depression doesn't actually happen until like 9 months. YOu probably just have the baby blues which should go away within a few weeks. Talk to your doctor though, especially if it really starts interfering with your relationship with your child.<br>  <br>  GL to you!|`|nyuB4POqaa	It sounds like you do, I had all those symptoms and they lasted for about 3 weeks.<br>  You should see your doctor and make sure you list all of these symptoms.<br>  It's very normal to experience postpartum..good luck hun
F6lZHRkVaa	I think the 50/50 custody is a good idea unless, like you said, one parent is unfit or the parent's decide different. <br>  <br>  A man should be made to pay child support though if he had a child outside of marriage. It takes two to tango. If he did the lay, he can do the pay.|`|b978f631fc787a963337206aa3833370aa	I don't know, but you should see what the child support laws are like in Italy and Greece! It's crazy!!|`|SlBsJ3NRaa	You ask an awful lot of questions regarding child support. If you are so worried about having to pay it, either keep your pants on until you are married, or quit whining about paying for a child you helped create before you got married.<br>  <br>  Men should be responsible for their children. Married to the mother or not.|`|frpCK0utaa	The custody thing :yes. A friend of mine, whos a good father, got shafted when his ex took him to court.<br>  <br>  Child Support : NO! a man is equally responsible in the making of the child, he should be made to man up and care for his child.<br>  <br>  "Man man will never have children unless the law is the same in America, becase thay don't want to pay court orderd child suport."<br>  <br>  BULLCRAP!|`|0jpep8S9aa	No, it shouldn't be the same.

ki5hZbcTaa	she may feel a little resentment. It would be best for the father to get her some counseling. What the father should not do however is never talk bad about the mom. Kids are very smart and will make up their minds about absent parents. No matter how bad the relationship was between the parents, the child does not need to know that. All she needs to know is that her parents want what's best for her.|`|cJRFbZUaaa	You'd have to ask the little girl herself.  No one else can or should guess at what she feels.|`|4eTyCuRSaa	Discarded|`|Jo2DfRzaaa	well is the little girl going to be a princess or a mermaid when she grows up.  does she have a brother or a sister?  it would depend on all of those circumstances.  sometimes a girl would like some chocolate cake or ice cream though.  is she getting that?<br>  if not then she would be sad
ggfE4rlvaa	If he just turned one and hasn't nursed for 10 months, you shouldn't have any milk at all. Or are you pumping? If so pregnancy would decrease your supply as the nutrients in your body would focus more on the pregnancy and not producing breast milk. I had milk at the start of my pregnancy and nursed through it. At 7 months it had turned to colostrum even while nursing. Best of luck!|`|VHYIx8vcaa	I think you might be pregnant, yes.

aac7c6d4d79683e9cae0fe6a541bbccdaa	Well, first of all if something happened in high school five years ago-I would say that you both could move on-forgive and forget.<br>  <br>  Play dates are very good for children.  It is an informal way for them to "socialize" with others their age, and learn skills such as sharing.  Some play dates might occur at locations other than the home-for instance, when my two older children were young and in a play group, we would meet at the play area of a local restaurant or the play area at the mall.  During nicer weather, a park is a good location.  And, sometimes you might do other things together-the children's museum, the petting zoo, etc.<br>  <br>  For play dates at home, you and the othe rmother would probably take turns hosting.  Prepare a light snack when it is your turn to host.  The children can play outdoors-bubbles, balls, sidewalk chalk-anything your daughter likes to do.  Indoors, they could do puzzles, play with blocks, etc.  <br>  <br>  You can get books from your local library and/or book store with activities for toddlers, and many parenting magazines have ideas for activities and arts and crafts, music-even fun snacks.  Try those!  Gymboree (the clothing line) has a book for babies and one for toddlers.<br>  <br>  If it goes well, yo ucould start a play group and ask several other mothers to join as well.  You could either keep it small and intimate (4-5 mothers and children) or larger, so that when ever something is scheduled, even if some could not make it someone is always bound to be there.  <br>  <br>  It would be beneficial for you as well-you would socialize with othe rmothers, exchange ideas about the best doctors, sales on children's shoes, share that great recipe, found a good book, etc.|`|pnL5WTXMaa	it sounds like your friend would like to mend things. children of that age aren't really capable of the socialization required of a true "play date". they might find each other interesting though. have her over your house and set up the toys etc. but be prepared for yours to be a little possessive of her things.|`|AA10188961	Have plenty of toys, toddler snacks and don't get upset with a mess.  You may want to commemorate the play date with a footprint or photos.|`|PumDOQC9aa	Yeah you should have a play date sounds fun . And you can talk things out with her. They probley sit there and play with toys and drink milk lol.|`|jERh0J2faa	Put them on a blanket together with toys, they will get along fine.

Anyway focus on goals ahead make a list of must things to do before you kick the bucket, it sounds corny, but its fun to think about all the things you want to do. Add stuff like traveling and seeing the world also think of it this way. At least everyday think of it this way: if i frown today I've had at least ten smiles to make up for it and if i Laugh today i have a hundred more smiles to back it up. And if you want exercise stuff think of taking a yoga class with friends or belly dancing it can be a lot of fun to joke around and act silly.|`|ULo8Cwdfaa	Stop worrying so much, it's hard but try. <br>  And another thing, I'm not religious, I believe in god, but am not all about religious and everything but if you listen to Joyce Meyer it really helps a lot, to think about things.|`|AA11029380	Play the Pollyanna glad game with yourself.

[but i don't do a ton of that]. <br>  -it takes a while to retrain your brain in to thinking about the positive things just keep redirecting your thinking... you will still get angery, sad, and upset about things [when that is an appropriate response] from time to time but it can be controlled by remembering this one golden nugget of information...."thoughts are just that...thoughts. feelings are just that....feelings. just because you FEEL  something or have a thought DOES NOT make it real. i can have the thought " my skin is pink and purple" but it doesn't make it so. you have to remember to to think about what is REAL and what you PERCEIVE  to be real.. hope it helps. you are very smart, i can tell by your question, i just learned about "mindfulness" which is what i described above and it has worked magic in my life.<br>  - and if you are female do not underestimate the role estrogen plays in your thinking! pms will slay your mind if you let it.  put your cycle on a calender and  write a word each day to chart how you feel and when you start and when you stop.  i did this for years and i now know when it is coming up and when i get upset, i know it is because of my cycle and not real. good luck!|`|TxV2DRpNaa	its kinda normal at your age...I have found it has only gotten worse over time, But before you seek medication, Exercise is the best method says my psychology professor.

Try making it a point that you babysat other peoples kids that you are not tied to.  People want to know that they can trust you so they would probably like to know that you have proper experience.

lGcpXteaaa	You will be absolutely fine to take him out. Protecting him from germs completely is not a good thing, it wont let him build his immune system up so therefore he could get ill easier.<br>  <br>  I took my daughter out as a newborn. I had no choice, i had to shop and nobody was there to take care of her while i went. So she came with me to wal-mart at around 1-2 weeks old.<br>  I didnt think it was that much of a big deal, and my daughter is completely fine.<br>  <br>  Try not to obsess about germs so much. That may help!<br>  Congrats x<br>  <br>  Edit: the reason why she is talking about him not being breastfed so not being able to go out as early as he is not getting the benefits of sharing her immune system. <br>  But honestly it wont make a difference. Go out and have fun!|`|TQScv7Tcaa	I took my daughter out and about when she was 4 days old, keeping your baby away from the outside world does him no good, not letting people touch him wont stop him from picking up germs. Dont worry about htese things so much and just enjoy him, dont stop your life, if you need to go to the shops take him, if you feel like going visiting then go. Remember when our race was born we didnt live inside and we are sill kicking!!|`|hh5E9n4Oaa	I'm confused as to why the formula fed thing has anything to do with it, my son was formula and not breast fed and he did fine.  I took him out when he was a month old we went to Walmart and he is now a healthy gorgeous vivacious two year old.|`|bNeL6Lftaa	wait till it is a sunny day and no wind. it may be cold or not but take him out cover face with blanket and go shopping girl. plan around feeding like get ready before and right after in to the car and go walk wal-mart i did all the time.|`|hr24wI0daa	Honey..... I had my son out the day we left the hospital. People shelter their children too much.

We did that with my daughter. After she had a feed (breast or bottle) we would take her out. It would give us at least 2 hours to do what we had to and she would sleep most of the time. Also try and pick places that have baby change rooms. Most baby change rooms should have a bottle warming device in them. Also to stop people sticking their faces right in the pram we covered it with a thin cloth and if someone asked for a look we just pulled it aside. I didn't care about people looking at her but it annoyed me when people stuck their faces right in the pram.<br>  <br>  I took my daughter out ofter 1 week. She had jaundice so it was recommended to get her sme sun light. Plus she only weighed 5 pound 11 ounces when born.|`|gyYXV3Bxaa	I took my baby out a couple days after I brought her home from the hospital.  I didn't have anyone to watch her, and I needed some things from the store.  She slept the whole time anyway.  People admired her from a distance-they never touched her or asked to hold her.  By 7 weeks,  she was out several times per week.  She's now 8 months old and perfectly healthy.|`|lGSUToFQaa	i breast fed my daughter, i formula and breast feed my son and i treated them the same, except she had rsv and was in the hospital for 3 months, i took him out when he was 2 weeks old, of course he was born in the summer. so whenever you are ready is fine.|`|YmEGCGtnaa	. the only reason id dint take my baby out very often at that age was bc i was still too scared to drive far with her int he back and her neck being so floppy still. youc an take him out now.|`|2448af06b59df00dd8a1a3ac6d057c75aa	first time like 3 weeks<br>   5 weeks for super shopping i was sooo tired and she was breast feed .

HZKsNwbeaa	Absolutely. They are treating children like criminals these days and I do not want some stranger to see my child naked, even for a search. I suggest going with private school, pay the extra money for some decency.|`|hNr3GFvlaa	Something being legal doesn't make it OK. I would definitely discuss it with my child, because that's their life we are talking about. If they feel humiliated and exploited, by all means, look for another school. <br>  <br>  If they don't care, I would not be so fast to act before I learn some details about the process and the people who are doing it.<br>  <br>  On a related note it is amazing how much abuse of children is happening in the name of the children, isn't it :)|`|17e9c7e9b8c52f6480ee24e65f4d402eaa	its been illegal, its an invasion of privacy<br>  unless teachers suspect something, like if you reek of weed, then they are allowed to search you (but with yo clothes on!)<br>  <br>  and yeah i definitely agree with 'Sassy'<br>  <br>  and it is wrong! boycott it and take it up with board of education is what i would do, maybe even sue.!|`|ngeBdq3Maa	Well first of all, it is wrong but still. Some kids bring guns to school and you never know it's either your kid getting shot or some other kid showing his privates and saving lives as the principle finds a weapon.<br>  <br>  Thought so.|`|M2yERqNSaa	well most kids in public schools THAT YOU ALL have raised are vicious little snots, so if they have probable cause, so be it<br>  <br>  this is why I home school|`|jIyvb2OOaa	hell yes fight the power!|`|JtPu0KBXaa	More metal detectors please!|`|31269476570b3829c86de1e8c487e423aa	um i think ur mistaken there is no way that could possibly be legal|`|XQkWiAksaa	Part of being an american is the ability to express yourself. If you don't like the fact the school does strip searches then pull your kids out of school. If enough parents pull their kids out of school then it will force a policy change onto the school. I know that if the school strip searched my child, that would be his last day at that school. I would call all the local papers and newstations to try to get this story out. If there is enough bad PR then the school will change.|`|LIrf00apaa	boycottin' doesnt do ****, but filing a lawsuit can get you somewhere. don't stop sending your kids to school, because the government can get involved and you can get your *** taken to court. now you need to specify if it's "stand up against the wall and let me pat you down", or "drop your pants and take your clothes off"|`|u5XEf5Wwaa	i would home school...and i probably will. thats messed up. at any age. call the police then call me, dont do it to a kid without the parents.|`|tQ4QlE8Waa	Kid wouldn't be stripped if they weren't suspected with drugs|`|ujN0hb73aa	i agree|`|QRG1Szn6aa	yessss boycute it|`|uMbToXcaaa	ewwwwwwwww..... thats nasty!|`|lzivF4Idaa	no. if they wanna strip search my kid they can call me and i'll come do it, or his father. that is the only possible way i could imagine being semi okay with a strip search on my son.|`|rIr781BXaa	if i was your kid. i'd walk out and refuse to do tht.<br>  imaa kid and i would never let them do tht to mee.<br>  but thats WRONG of them!!|`|SrcoG7JRaa	Yes, I'd pull them out and homeschool. I'm already thinking of doing that (it's either homeschool or private, but finding a secular/atheist compatible school/curriculum is tough for both!), but if they were violated like that or it was going to happen, you bet I'd protest it. They're kindergarten and second graders - not inmates.<br>  (Though public schools do seem to function and treat the kids much in the same way as a minimum security prison functions and treats inmates - for pete's sake, my girls' elementary school has fences inside fences that are 15 feet tall and locks and chains on the gates. They're literally imprisoned there...)|`|prqrQcd1aa	About the time they try to strip search one of my kids at school would be about the time i'd start home schooling!|`|ghz5D5iLaa	God help the person that tried to strip search my child.|`|35JIECGRaa	That is appauling! I would change schools if that happened!
whYlVR2saa	its just that their business is using up all of our taxpayer money while we support they asses on welfare. can u just tell me y you aren't doing ya' homework? get an education.|`|jdRKZe18aa	I doubt that EVERYONE looks down on ALL pregnant teenagers.  That's a pretty judgmental comment for you to say about ALL situations and people, don't ya think?  I think when people make assumptions about young girls when they really shouldn't and assume they are unwed, too young to be getting pregnant and assume she probably shouldn't be having a baby, shouldn't have had sex at her age already and probably isn't emotionally mature enough to be dealing with motherhood etc - then THOSE would be unfounded and unkind things to just ASSUME about a young pregnant teen that we don't even know.<br>  <br>  From an older mothers point of view, I always just feel SAD when I see a teenager who APPEARS too young to be having a baby, because I think they are really missing out on their youth and the free unfettered things that life SHOULD be about still instead of being chained down and stressed with young motherhood and babies already..... but I don't look down on them....|`|0ER34nnqaa	because there are people that cant have children who want them and teenagers just go and have children and kill them by aborting or just give them away. plus teens shouldnt be having sex at all.|`|e8259d706e4c0ff624821e09f8c00d53aa	I don't believe teens can care for babies. I'm sure they can love them just as much as anyone, but babies need to be taken care of financially too. Teens aren't prepared. In most cases the grandparents get stuck caring for the baby and also our tax dollars through food stamps etc. Someone should at least be out on their own with a job paying their own bills before they take on the responsibility of another person.|`|BiRujg8Baa	I always wanted 2 know 2...I'm 19 but look 14 and people look at me funny but I don't care cuz my baby gonna be well taken care of...I see adults that can't take of there kids but no one look at them wrong|`|AA11340179	because ppl like to bud their nose into other peoples buisness if they are to have the baby and raise it i dont think it matters what age as long as they raise their child right|`|RjoCYCkQaa	you even type like your black! 'thats they business" hahahahaha|`|DcLiW4bbaa	Because it takes a very serious level of patience, perseverance, responsibility, and common sense to take care of a child. And many teenagers don't have any of those things. Hell, a lot of adults don't either. <br>  <br>  Teenagers are still developing who they are and are still children themselves. Hell, I just had a baby and I'm 21 and I think I'm too young for this. Teenagers should be out having fun and experiencing all the things life has to offer without being tied down with a baby. Being carefree doesn't last very long as it is...<br>  <br>  Not to mention that teenagers have no way of providing stability financially for a child since they still rely heavily on their own parents.|`|RR35cmBdaa	the people that look down on then are normally older people that think u should have a house, money, a job and be married but these days people are not. but does not help when 12,13,14 year olds are having children. its like children are having children alot of children at that age dont know how hard it is to bring up a child and how much its cost they think because they can look after a doll they can look after a baby i just dont think its right having children that young.|`|wxbGmxbOaa	People look down on pregnant teenagers because they fail to take the time to know their stories. They see a young girl pregnant and automatically think they are a sl*t. Which in a lot of cases is not the facts. It's funny though that these people judge teenage mothers or mothers to be, because young mothers sometimes turn out to be some of the best mothers. Not all teens are irresponsible and can't support their child. I've seen plenty of "Adults" fail as parents and I don't see people judging them. I think people need to get their facts straight before they judge someone based on their age.<br>  <br>  I am going to be a teen mom. I'm not as young as some, but still I'm 19, so that one makes me an adult, but still a teenager. And if anyone has anything negative to say about it then let me explain my situation to you.<br>  <br>  I was 18 when I found out I was pregnant, I am now 19. I graduated from high school in May of 2008. I am still fully planning on attending college, I have a full time job. My bf and I have been together for nearly 4 years and we were together for 3 years and a month before we even had sex, oh and by the way I was a virgin before him. He has a part-time job for now and is still hunting for something more full-time. We do live with my parents, but we pay for groceries and help out around the house as much as we can. We offered to pay rent, but my parents being the people they are refuse to take any rent money from us. We are planning on moving out on our own a couple months after our daughter is born. So don't judge every teenage mother or mother to be. We can turn out to be great moms. And there isn't anyone going to tell me that I won't be a good mother to my daughter, because I'm fully confident in the fact that I will be and my daughter will NEVER go without, she comes before me and everyone.|`|PvaGOEAlaa	Yeah it's they're buisness but if you think about it ...it's foolish to get married and have a baby, let alone get pregnant without getting married as a teenager. People centuries ago would get married at the age of 18ish..but that was because kids were taught differently then. "Kids" were much more responsible and mature than they are today... I'm all for having a child and calling it my own..but I'd rather see what the world has to offer me before I settle down with a family.|`|2QBHT8Azaa	Ya, teens shouldn't be having sex until they are done with college, and are in a stable enviroment for that matter.<br>  The main reason everyone looks down on them is because they were oviously irresponsible and appear very skank-tramp-**** looking.|`|zmpk29BLaa	maybe you ghetto teens should close your legs and stop being skanks. you are just bad moms on welfare who will never have a real family, just a baby daddy and saggy ta tas by the time you are 19.|`|WqkOI7RDaa	That's they business until they're raising theys babies on my tax dollars.|`|LmswcIdtaa	Raising a child is a major issue for women of any age. The reason having children so young is an issue us that the welfare of the baby is most important.|`|xrNzLYhAaa	Because they view teens as babies themselves and that they are not able to handle the responsible aspect of it.|`|BEvx9Mh8aa	they think they should wait until they're older instead of gettin pregnet as a teen.
T0pkW783aa	Sarah Louise (Strawberry blond hair, very curly, light eyes, medium build, medium height).  She is a little plain and doesn't care much about how she dresses or what people think about her.  She is too pre-occupied with school and things that make her happy.  She isn't someone who spends time with other people because she is kind of shy and would rather be doing her own thing.  Studious, likes to read and write.<br>  <br>  Ainslie May (Blond hair, wavy with soft ringlets around the face; full face with pink cheeks; short in stature.)  Not into sports but enjoys being in group activities that don't require exercise).  Would rather watch TV or a movie than go outside or to an event.  She is more of a couch potato than a participant.  Enjoys eating out.  She can make a mean grilled cheese sandwich and would love to have you come and watch TV with her; she's even let you use her George Foreman grill if you want to make the sandwiches.<br>  <br>  Rachael Amy (Brunette with copper highlights; straight hair which is worn in braids or pulled back to keep out of her eyes; loves roller skating, tennis, swimming and anything competitive; constantly challenges others to compete with her for the fun of it.  Happy go lucky and someone with many friends.<br>  <br>  Amy Leigh (Very curly brown hair and dark eyes); olive skin that tans well.  Keeps her hair short and very stylish; dresses in the latest fashion and has a little bit of arrogance and an attitude when she feels that someone is "beneath her".  Doesn't like to be corrected and always feels as if she is right.  Short in height (5'3" but big in attitude!!)<br>  <br>  Lily Jean (Black hair with creamy white skin and bright blue eyes!)  She is a beauty but doesn't flaunt it; thinks there are more important things in life than mere beauty.  She is smart, talented (musical, artistic and original); designs her own clothing and is a trend setter.  Her smile lights up the room and she is a genuine, caring friend.  She is compassionate to all and gives of herself when she feels as if she can offer something special to someone who has less than she does.  Her heart is big and she is loved by all.  5'5" but you would think she was 6' tall because she fills up the space with her dynamic attitude and sparkling personality!!  If you want to be like anyone, you would choose to be like Lily Jean!!

Even try out some finger foods.<br>  My daughters faves are:<br>  Mashed Potato<br>  Apple pureed or chopped <br>  Banana pureed or chopped<br>  Melon chopped.<br>  Pasta to hold. Great for teaching how to self feed.<br>  Weetabix with breast milk or formula.<br>  <br>  idk...there so much they can eat, it just has to be a healthy choice. Its great for getting into healthy eating for yourself too! <br>  <br>  The only thing she eats already made is the nestle cereal powder breakfasts sometimes...she loves them!! If i do go out i sometimes keep jars as they are easy...i prefer the Beech Nut ones....<br>  <br>  Hope i helped x|`|BMfn0D9gaa	we like Gerber the best and we just use the 'regular' food, meaning no DHA or organic.  we have used some others like the beech nut and the natures goodness but i don't think they are as good as gerber.  natures goodness seems to have a funny taste, yes i like to taste my daughters food before she eats it if it is new, and that kind seems to be really 'tart'|`|bNeL6Lftaa	as for the best brand of food.... i just regular. my daughter is 8 months and is just getting into stage 2 food and eating all of it. so really i would have to say it is all about your little girl there is a stage 3 but that has chucks and you have to make sure that she is ready for chewing might want to hang out for a while and just do what your doing. fruit veg dinners that stuff. sippy cup well i am on the same page. even try water in the sippy to let her figure out how to suck on it at first she will be like... what is this? but she will get it even try taking out the stopper, let water flow out of it. like i said it is all on your little girl when she is ready it might be next week or a few months just go with the flow of the little lady.|`|Mr6U1TiHaa	i like the Beech Nut baby food...or if you like give him the same brand you have been giving him....its not much of a big different its smashed fruits with water... my  son loves the tender sweet potato
CiFR2xuBaa	I would think not, but as pleasant as that sounds, I would be quite embarrased having an orgasm in the delivery room....|`|9a98c6a2cb84fbfbec4be6a912bbb028aa	I doubt it. It broke my water and started everything twice, in fact. The uterus contracts when you orgasm, after all.|`|rkSBHqtQaa	No. But it might help start labor if she is close to her due date.|`|gFiRi5xnaa	An orgasm can CAUSE labor.|`|V7sfV5odaa	No|`|WU3iVaa0aa	why would you want to stop labor?<br>  <br>  <br>  But Anyway to answer the question.. It will not stop labor.. nothing stops labor.. :( it just keeeps going lol|`|NOjcTeT4aa	No it will not stop labor. It might help it.|`|gWiZAsfBaa	No, an orgasm will not stop labor.|`|OI3bf4yjaa	No.
xXnFx6qLaa	How was her birthday!??!?!?!?!<br>  <br>  And I agree - totally sh*tty.  Reminds me of Johnny's father's family.  They haven't even cared to see or even ask about him since Christmas of '07.  Bunch of @ssholes.<br>  <br>  Give her a birthday hug from me and Johnny!|`|lkhCeAdJaa	I agree with davya.<br>  The reality is that her Bday isn't as important to anyone else as much as it is to you....that's just how it works.  Not to say they are completely excused; they could have acknowledged it!  <br>  But really, this is how it is....they remember some, they forget some;-)|`|tkSXjqhuaa	Oh yeahhhhh. I'd be mad. Send them a card with a picture of her and a birthday hat that says "IM 1!" lol.|`|prqrQcd1aa	that IS pretty crappy!|`|a9YfUGzSaa	My mom forgot my niece's birthday for a few days this year.  We had a lot going on and we hadn't seen my sister and her family in a while, so it wasn't at the forefront of anyone's mind.  When there's no one around you talking about it, like I'm sure you were in your house, it's easier to forget than you might think-- especially if this is the first time they've been expected to remember it.  I don't even know my youngest nephew's birthday yet besides the month, even though I was THERE, because he's had so few birthdays that I haven't memorized it yet.  If I saw them more than every couple months then maybe it would be different.|`|aCUHzMrmaa	DId they just forget??  Thats very bad if they forgot and just really sad.  I would be pretty hurt too my ex's inlaws arnt even in my daughters life and i just think of them as shitheads.  I dont know the relationship you ahve with them but i'm saying it would bother me too.  Talk to your husband about it.|`|WxQFe0GYaa	Probably, but are you sure they remembered?  My in-laws love my son so much, but I can imagine they don't know his exact birthday unless they really think about it.|`|JT4OSUPeaa	Happy Birthday Kaylee!!!!<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  Yeah, that is pretty sorry of them. I would be very hurt and upset. I would probably call.|`|SjX72fPyaa	Happy birthday Kaylee!<br>  <br>  And I would be maaaad about that. They could have at least called.<br>  <br>  And like you said, they would have to have really really bad memories to forget their grandchilds birthday.|`|quTKsQPhaa	Awww! That's sad! My mother in law and I talk about her FUTURE grandchildren all the time! Haha! I know for sure she'd never forget...Hmmm....I'm sorry! Happy Birthday Kaylee!|`|JnLoHaoAaa	Maybe they have bad memories and forgot?<br>  <br>  EDIT: It's the only logical explanation I can think of. Do you not have a good relationship with the in-laws?|`|8Qxb7OZOaa	It wouldn't bother me but its definitely Shitty of them.<br>  <br>  On Xmas or other holidays don't spend it with them.|`|bd38b0a2b041268a6a8a5f21f80dfeb9aa	I agree with you that is very sh*tty and the only thing that could overlook that is if they were in an accident and or in the hosp- in serious condition. P.S. I'm a nana (grandma) and I love my grandkids to pieces and have either seen them each or talked to them on the phone everyday.What does your husband think of this? I hope it bothers him too.|`|oYmZUO8Caa	That's really awful. Even if they aren't close...they should still respect an important date like that. Not only are they outright disrespecting your daughter, but you and your husband as well!<br>  <br>  BUT..most importantly, she has a mommy and daddy who love her haha :o) and happy birthday to your daughter!|`|ja427oPHaa	Unless they have something terrible going on, like one of them is gravely ill, then no, there is no excuse for that. I would be really hurt if my husband's parents did that to our daughter.|`|6hT06oY9aa	Oh, I'd be pi$$ed.  There's no excuse to forget your grandchild's birthday.<br>  <br>  For Christmas, send them a calender with her birthday marked on it.<br>  <br>  Happy birthday to Kaylee.xx|`|WNn8WDPHaa	yes that is wrong. they should have that marked on a calender i agree wil princess cali, take a pic with a hat that say si am one on it and send it to them, lol.,|`|iX8S8UOiaa	well for 1 HAPPY BIRTHDAY TO KAYLEE!!!<br>  and 2 call them and tell them that today is her birthday and tell them how you feel.|`|vNLfQ8rSaa	Wow! And I thought my inlaws were bad! You have every right to be upset at them, she is their grandchild, the least they could do is call!<br>  <br>  Happy 1st Birthday Kaylee!!<br>  :D<br>  <br>  xx|`|lY2XI8kUaa	Happy Birthday to your daughter. and yes that is very wrong of them not to call and say happy birthday.|`|UTPEopylaa	Happy birthday Kaylee!<br>  <br>  Yes, that is very rude. Not even a 2 dollar card or a call? That's lame.......|`|ixV9SfK6aa	if they did know and didn't say anything that's incredibly rude|`|AA10167940	I would be like wtf?  I think it's extremely rare for someone to forget their grandchild's first birthday-<br>  <br>  <br>         *****Happy 1st Birthday Kaylee!!!******|`|M6c0hUefaa	Don't worry, my in-laws didn't remember my daughter's b-day either. It was in March, but OH GOD they have had plans for two months now to go see their other granddaughter on her birthday...which is in May. Oh well, it hurts my feelings, but meh, what can you do?...
laLW1Krwaa	Well she is old enough to do it. Tell her the consequences and give her condoms and birth control|`|W6o3UQLkaa	She's 18, old enough but make sure she knows the consequences of unprotected sex
OgzHcNMsaa	My husband watched the entire thing...when I was having contractions on the bed he was on the bed with me...he videotaped the birth...he cried when his daughter came out...he put on her first diaper and did skin to skin with her as soon as she was born and now she's 6 weeks and he's in love with her. I'm blessed!|`|ANHsv4ENaa	I went into labor at about 4am and as soon as I woke my husband up and he packed everything I needed, got it all into the car, helped me dress and talked to the midwife to tell her we were on our way. It all went so fast I needed to push on the way in the car and he talked me through every bit of it with the midwife on the phone. Never lost his cool even when she told him to pull over and check to see if the head was crowning! It was only a 15 minute drive but we weren't sure we'd make it to my parent's where I was planning on delivering. He was amazing! Supportive, reassuring just all around really a good guy to have in times of "crisis." Lol. He was nice enough to tell me repeatedly that screaming was ok because I kept hollering and apologizing. When we had to pull over on the way and the midwife met us she let him feel the baby's head as it crowned. He did cut the cord too after Columbia was born.|`|AA11210211	No my hubby didn't get to either time,I had a c-section with both and my OBGYN wouldn't let him even look over the curtain so....He stood next to me the whole time holding my hand though.|`|CVdcrY3kaa	My husband was in Afghanistan when our daughter was born, he didn't come home to meet her until she was 4.5 months old. However, he was on the phone with me for the last several hours I was in labor until she was born. We were both thrilled, he cried a little...bittersweet, I think. He wanted to be here so bad, but he was so happy. I video taped the entire thing (not too much detail!) but he loved getting the DVD.|`|YmEGCGtnaa	youa re so lucky. my boyfriend just stood there the whole time i was in active labor. even when she was coming out. he says he was just in disbelief but still no excuse|`|7rCeCVl2aa	I don't have a beautiful story to share. LOL! My husband was green the entire time. When I started puking from the epidural instead of helping me he stood there and stared like a deer in headlights... He slept through the baby's heart rate dropping, me getting flipped over and being put on oxygen...He stood over my shoulder with his jaw wide open... not knowing what to do... When they offered for him to cut the cord he almost puked. I will be the first to admit that he was an awful birth partner. I cut his cord when my husband chickened out. He was scared to death!!! <br>  <br>  Finally though he calmed down and we just started at our son in awe.<br>  <br>  Fortunately he got over his fear of babies and I would nominate him for dad of the year now. =)<br>  <br>  <br>  **EDIT** Oh yes and to add when he came out the umbilical cord was wrapped around his neck twice so he was really purple. The first words out of my husband's mouth when seeing his new son were "He looks black!" Yeah... no awards for birth partner of the year here. LOL!|`|IXBl5l5kaa	My husband was there for the whole thing. It was awesome...<br>  <br>  He stood by me encouraging me while my mom took pictures from behind. I caught him sneaking a peak over my legs once in a while lol. At one point I was told to stop pushing for a few and he thought the doc meant for him to go down to the foot of the bed. WHOOPSY, he was about to see the doc give me an episiotomy lol!<br>  <br>  He had a HUGE smile, his face was red and his eyes were glossy the whole time. When her head came out he started crying, then after they cleaned her mouth and nose out, pulled the cord from around her neck (I didn't know that at the time) I got to pull her up to me! He probably would have crawled in the bed with me just to be close to Jaiden.<br>  <br>  He did get to cut the cord and the nurse took the camera from my mom so she could get all of us. He started cutting too soon and they told him to pose again.. both pictures are hilarious the look on his face hehe.|`|lGSUToFQaa	mine was amazing, i have a wonderful hubby, he cut the cord, and i had an emergency c-section and he watched it all, he was so amazing and supportive, he lit up when he saw our son, he held my hand, massaged my shoulders and back, combed my hair because i couldn't reach that high with all the stuff in my arms, my son is 7 months old now, the first time my hubby changed him in the hospital, i was asleep and he used gloves, it was too funny, he got to give the first bath, and he watched the nurses while they cleaned him the first time. <br>  <br>  happy belated birthday to your daughter.|`|e7ElUQ9Raa	yea with my daughter and he will do it again when my son is born in June. He didn't freak out at all. He was happy and proud to do so!|`|rAkWoweOaa	He wouldn't come anywhere near the room until they told him the baby was here, then he just covered his eyes and made it in there to see and hold the baby.|`|FHT6wsUpaa	I had an emergency c-section after 14 hours of labor, and due to complications with my epidural that they attempted to bolster (meaning, it didn't work!!), I had to go under general anesthesia. They kicked my husband out of the room, and not only was he not allowed to cut the cord, he couldn't even witness the birth. However, one of the nurses allowed him to come to the window just minutes after our daughter was born so that he could see her (I was asleep for the next three hours, unfortunately). He was allowed to hold her almost right away, and I found out later that, with the help of a nurse, he gave her her first bath.<br>  <br>  This is a great question...my daughter is one year old today, 2/20! I've been thinking about holding her for the first time a whole lot today....<br>  <br>  Best of luck!<br>  <br>  ETA: Happy belated birthday to your little one!|`|cab8f3eed982d7c810bf2e8fc14f2cecaa	No my husband didn't get to cut the cord. I had a c section. They wouldn't let him behind the blue curtain. He said he stood up and looked one time before they took the baby out and he wished hadn't lol. I think maybe its right after they cut and was playing with my insides. He said that was pretty bad. He also said that when they finally brought him to sit next to me it smelled really bad like burning flesh in there. Bc they used a laser to cut me. During the labor tho he told me he thought I handled it really well and he couldn't have done everything as calmly as I did. Course after he knew I and baby was ok from having surgery you could see the "proud dad " smile all over his face.|`|h59Bc4wfaa	My hubby didn't get to cut the cord. Neither one of us even got to see our son until 4 hours after he was born. I had a vaginal birth, but I had it in the O.R. (was very impersonal). My hubby and my MIL were in there with me. The nurses asked if I wanted a mirror, but with my MIL being there, I decided against it.<br>  <br>  My son was born at 31 weeks and I have a severely bad heart, that's why I had to deliver in the O.R. So my hubby didn't get to see anything, he didn't get to cut the cord. =( My son wasn't even out all the way, but he was crying. As soon as we all heard it, we all started crying. (Me, hubby, and MIL) He got to hold my hand, and he helped hold me up with every push....He seemed very calm, but his hands were sweating, so I knew better.|`|oUtEVKDHaa	haha yeah well he didn't cry but he nearly fainted. <br>  He did cut the cord and was there the WHOLE time! he saw our little girl coming out and i still remember his eyes opening up sooo wide when she was coming out. i was just thinking wow it must look really nasty down there or something ahaha... he was holding my hand too while i was having contractions.. he told me everything would be ok. i'll have you know he isn't really affectionate with me but that day he made up for it because he really took care of me. and as a father well what can i say he loves our daughter sooo much i couldn't be more lucky. and that's my little story hehe|`|uLdeIhHqaa	Unfortunately Not :( <br>  <br>  I had a C-section due to some complications during my Pregnancy. Plus, my Daughter was born 1 month early but she was still as healthy as a horse! She weighed 6lbs 12oz and was 19 3/4 long. <br>  <br>  But, he did get to watch as they cut me and pulled her out! He was snapping pics, he was very excited! Plus, he was the first one to get to hold her, so that made up for him not getting to cut the umbilical cord.|`|VASlTn6Faa	my fiance cut her cord and he saw her come out but he said he got tricked into it. the nurses told him she was out and when he looked around she was still coming out. He was a little freaked out at first but he is now glad he got to see it all.|`|J87cQEuzaa	Well with my 3 yr old daughter we where both really young and very nervous! He didn't look "down there" at all! not even when I had to push. He just kept looking at my face and telling me it was going to be ok. I guess it all kind of happened so fast and it felt so surreal we where both kind of like in "shock" when she came out and they handed her to us. <br>  <br>  With my son tough he was much more involved and even held my legs while I was pushing. He was definately  looking down there and was like "I see his head! he has a lot of hair!" and because I pushed much longer this time around (he was 9 1/2lbs!) he was definately rooting me on and even got teary eyed when my son came out. It was special!|`|a57c02189e8a496f061aa934ef40807baa	I'd rather tell about seeing my grandson, Cyris Allen Banes, being born than my own baby tales. My daughter, Gina, was only 16 at the time..<br>  ...God Bless her! !  WOW....having 4 children of my own was one thing. My first born was even photographed throughout the delivery and there were mirrors all around so I could see "everything"...but I'll tell you what Kelly...."Nothing" could compare to what I witnessed my daughter go through that day. If you, (not you in particular) don't believe in God.....watch the gift of life being born with your own eyes and you'll reconsider...I gaurantee it! !  It was the most amazing thing I've ever in my life had the pleasure of seeing. A little scary for me, ofcourse, seeing my daughter in pain.. But she was a trooper. The girls in my family on my Mothers side are very small. My daughter started out weighing only 89 pounds, (she gained 30).....but gave birth to a full term whopping 8 pound baby boy. Whew....I was hella tired just breathing with her and holding her leg up to help push! ! <br>  Short story....My daughters father was killed by a drunk driver when we were on our way to get married...I didn't even know I was pregnant until 2 weeks later in the hospital, as I was seriously injured. So, she, in herself is a Miracle child to have lived through a horrific head on collision just being a small person in my injured body.... I swear when I first looked at my grandson, I seen his Grandfather look at me telling me everything was going to be okay. My daughter was kind enough, even though she's never known her father, to name her son after him. Hence the middle name Allen and his last name Banes. I'm so grateful to her for that. I could go on and on about this wonderful story, but as any Parent knows, it would take a novel to tell all the details. But I'd like to thank you Kelly, again, for letting me relive yet another cool memory.<br>  My grandson is now 5 yrs old and in Kindergarden. Doing well, and just as cute as can be. When I get this darn new camera I got figured out, I'll send a photo...<br>  God Bless everyone...I'll enjoy reading some other stories after I've submitted mine.<br>  Goodaytoyou! ! <br>  P.S. Yes, the father was there and able to cut the umbilical cord...but in retrospect, it shoud of been me! As you know me by now, that's a whole other story!  : )|`|os36Q3P2aa	For my 1st 3 kiddies  yeh my hubby was there from start to finish crying and all !lol (had 3rd baby at home on sofa in a bit of a rush lol)<br>  But with my 4th he was an emergency c section ..we had both been awake for  24hours due to complications  and by the time  i was in theatre(sp?) he was ready to faint  through worry ,lack of sleep  etc (he also didnt realise  that there was a curtain up ,he thought he'd have to watch everything  and hes quite  erm..squeemish!lol )so  i had the section  as soon as baby was out he came in  held my hand,kissed me,showed me our little man  and was then sent up to my room to wait for me !
MHOxPs8Oaa	No, not at all.  You are a good mom because you were trying to get him to the doctor as soon as you could.|`|bfb230dc1ac989ed2a0e37264327e8a1aa	At his age, just put cherrios in a baggie and let him eat them on the way.|`|fdnbXfvfaa	No, not at all. He had had a bottle, and you were trying to get to the doctor<br>  I say well done for fitting everything in before you had to leave|`|T3BXC8qXaa	KNY stole my answer! <br>  <br>  When you become a parent, you learn to improvise. You also learn to tune out your mother if she's ranting about something silly......|`|xyrSl2nSaa	NOPE!|`|Hl7OvXruaa	good mommy.. even if he didnt get the cereal you r still an excellent mom|`|1B91qtNQaa	IMO no it does not. It is not like you are starving him to death. <br>  <br>  You are not going to be supermom and I would bet everything I have that your mom is not one either. Getting him to that last minute doctor's appointment was more important than cereal.|`|31269476570b3829c86de1e8c487e423aa	no it's not like he wouldn't have gotten anything he would have gotten a bottle an any case|`|ENYkIOPDaa	No, you were just trying to<br>  get him to the doctors office and if he wasn't<br>  starving and had food then he's ok|`|X0B8P8Yiaa	NO NO NO NO NO dont think that it is so not irresponsible dont beat your self up about it|`|pnL5WTXMaa	wow - no.|`|949517353a847c7e512b934758a0b451aa	i know what you mean and what it feels like. i live with my mom to and my son is almost three sometimes i give him milk in the morning but most of the time i jus take him to school early so he could have breakfast and my mom always says its not right he needs his milk but in the end you have to do what you think is best for YOUR child|`|TSsT8QGgaa	try trying to get out the door for an appt with TWIN 11 month olds,,,we also lived at home with my parents (thank GOD) and we still didnt get to places on time (sometimes)  it does not make you a bad parent.  the day i felt like a bad parent i was out shopping/running errands and we didnt eat lunch,,,after the kids being cranky for awhile it dawned on me they had NOT had lunch.  i could NOT believe i forgot to feed them at all.  we then went to have lunch,,they calmed down, and live went on.  <br>  my suggestion,,,keep some food in the diaper bag,,,you could have fed a jar of something when you got there.  i always had oatmeal, jars of fruit, cereal bars etc in the diaper bag. (my grandfather asked me one day if i had any DIAPERS in my diaperbag).<br>  it is called life,,,sometimes things dont work out as well as planned. you just do what you hafta do and try not to worry about it.<br>  <br>  (honestly,,,i would have looked at my mom and TOLD her if you are so worried about him eating YOU feed him.)|`|sagjCRvKaa	No, your mom, is a mother hen, she is just trying to make sure every one is getting everything they need. I to feel this way at times, (it's not my mother, my husband) but I feel there is only one of me and I am doing the best I can. Do not feel guilty, you did nothing wrong.|`|w6OyaSPzaa	No of course it dosent make you a bad mom!
6eaWRGaqaa	Talk to him first, maybe he honestly didn't see you! I do that all the time and then people get mad at me because I ignored them.<br>  <br>  If you are 100% positive (make sure you are positive because you could be losing a really nice guy) that he DID see you, then dump him. It's stupid to be with a guy who chooses his friends over you in school. I get the entire "bros before hoes" saying, but he can't just ignore you! That's just not nice.<br>  <br>  I've run into a few guys like your boyfriend (well from the description of him) before and you'll just end up getting hurt if you don't dump him. Honestly, he sounds like he's not so much embarrassed to be with you, but that he's using you because your probably really pretty or popular or something.<br>  <br>  Next time go up and say hi to him! Make sure he knows your there!<br>  <br>  -Catherine|`|NJv2zKxnaa	Sounds like he is embarrassed to be with you in school, but out of school he worships you.<br>  <br>  If he says I love you at night or something just be like, Then show it.<br>  He'll be like WHOA WHAT DO YOU MEAN?<br>  Then mention little incidents. Just be like, I'm not trying to be picky, but you ARE my boyfriend.|`|kc2Sa7ibaa	Aw :( That's sad. I think you should say something.. If you are getting sick and tired of it I would break up with him. That's not how you are meant to be treated. You shouldn't have to be the girlfriend only when he wants you to be.|`|3w7VztEWaa	he sounds like a pig!!!<br>  he is embarrassed to what his friends will think|`|llMxMUyQaa	ive had this same problem many times. if he is like many guys... then he is just being a guy i think that all guys are bi polar sometimes. i mean one day they are all cuddly the next they act like enemies... if i were u i would bring it up suddly like maybe "hey i was wondering if u were mad at me because u didnt say hi at lunch?" dont make a big deal about it just see what he has too say. also do the same thing with the hallways. the best thing is to tak about it without starting problems.|`|Fcv0ol0Vaa	what, is he like embarresed it be with u during school or somthing? if i were u, id go right up 2 him and ask him whats up, and if he is embaressed of u r dosnt want to be seen w/ u or somthing, DUMP HIM. u deserve better.|`|97jVTdFCaa	I would dump him he sounds like an a**|`|d8MvSJr4aa	Brake up with it!|`|HX0t8bdwaa	he might just be playing hard to get or sum idk really <br>  <br>  another thing is he could be cheating on you or trying to talk to another girl at your school because after school she might not be around and thats when he'll get all lubby dubby<br>  <br>  if i was you i wouldnt bring it up just talk to him more try to communicate more with him and when you see him at school go up to him and say hi be lubby dubby with him and sooner or later he'll do the same and if you all of the sudden stop you'll have him wondering too<br>  <br>  and after a while he'll expect you to go up to him and say hi n show love but at the same time he'll want to do the same<br>  <br>  <br>  good luck|`|UrZ8SFpqaa	Well...I would just leave it for now, but if it really becomes more obvious, just ask "hey, are you okay?" <br>  <br>  The one thing I've learned about guys is that they do not like conflict at all...I don't blame them either!|`|89eacaf706726be6ca9f259d599c0f27aa	ask him whats going on<br>  <br>  maybe he doesnt mant to be in a public relationship<br>  <br>  its probably not that he is embarrassed by you but its abt him
DWl8nfyWaa	Nah, I didn't have a boyfriend or my first kiss until I was fifteen.  Don't feel babyish and stupid.  They're making bad decisions and will probably regret it later in life.  Wait until you find a good guy.  Don't waste your time on some loser.|`|AA10186411	I think you are SMART.  While they are bitching and whining about a guy using them for sex, or scared they are pregnant, you can be having all the fun you want without any worries! :)|`|rFtKFp03aa	Good for you! <br>  <br>  Having sex at 13 is over rated and stupid...|`|mpGjPV6Xaa	Sweety, it's ok that you didn't kiss a boy yet. Think about it, you're the smart one out of the group, I'm so sure that one or more of your friends are going to end up pregnant at a young age and will regret it. See you, you won't have that problem if you just wait a while. It's not a race now to see which friend can kiss a boy first , you know. So, just concentrate on your schooling and don't think about boys to much. Thinking about boys can interfere with your school work and will cause you to start doing bad in your class.<br>  <br>  So, just wait till you're like 15 - 16 years old before kissing a boy, because trust me it doesn't take much to fall really hard for a boy. Once you kiss a boy and you like it, you're going to want to do it all the time and might even take it to the next step which wouldn't be good at all.<br>  <br>  Just think about what you're doing and the consequences that you may face.<br>  <br>  Hope I helped :<br>  <br>  Joseph D : )|`|tDKQ8lwsaa	it's sensible that you feel babyish, but age isn't the requirement for when to have a bf or when to kiss a guy, it's when ur ready or when the right guy comes to you. this could be in 2 months or 2 years, whenever the time is right.|`|qqiVKUBpaa	No of course not! That's a wonderful thing. Your first kiss will mean more if you wait until you meet a guy that you really like and you want a kiss. Don't feel pressured to rush things just because your friends have. If they are really your friends they'll support you and they won't pressure you into doing things with guys anyway.|`|mfBkH3qtaa	Thats good. NOT bad. Don't be rushed. Because i remember the exact date i got my first kiss and make out. It was this huge rush and I still can't believe it. But trust me it isn't THAT great. Like instead of hugging or anything my b/f would rather kiss on me or make out.|`|bRwjqN3baa	no...i kissed or dated a boy until just a few months back.lol. i turn 18 last month. you have nothing to worry about :)<br>  just get to know the guys you DO like and make an impression.<br>  [a good one...not a slutty one.]<br>  <br>  lotz of luck :D|`|F3iEnj2Caa	No, not  at all. <br>  I was 13 when I got my first kiss, and i'm glad it was with such an amazing guy. (: <br>  Im not with him anymore, but he is a good friend of mine now.|`|8xCtSGsCaa	I'd rather be 13 and never kissed a guy than be 13 and pregnant.|`|fJiUa5ykaa	That's great!<br>  <br>  Wait a few more years before dating.<br>  <br>  Wait until you are married to have Sex!|`|meAr7GIYaa	17 & never kissed a guy.|`|ymuLw18vaa	if your embarrassed about it,<br>  then if any of your friends haven't done anything they'd probably be embarrassed too<br>  so most likely most of them haven't done what they say they've done.<br>  im not saying you should confront them, as this would probably embarrass them more,make everyone uncomfortable and maybe ruin your friendship, but most likely some of them are exaggerating<br>  its okay to wait<br>  you shouldn't feel any pressure, if your happy as you are then stay that way, or ask the guy you like out if you think he likes you|`|0YmH0Zfkaa	WOW i cant believe I am reading this! Kids are growing up much too early these days. If you are a loser than I must be a HUGE loser because I never kissed anyone until I was 16 (I am 21 now). And the reason was a good one. I respected myself, and wanted to kiss someone I knew could respect me. You should hang onto that and be proud, knowing that all those other people are losing respect in themselves. Pride is a very important thing to have once you become a teenager.|`|IF9MAgjAaa	You're not babyish... you're more mature. I think you're saving it for someone really special, not just a random kid with cool hair and a good taste in music, and that's really responsible of you not to eff your life up to be cool. When the time comes, it'll happen, but you'll never find if you're looking for it (haha, to quote The Used -- Blue and Yellow). But really, be patient and the time will come ;)|`|1cTKIHUraa	I just love it when people think, wow sex at 13 thats disgusting! Well when u were at that age, it wasnt was it? Now that your a big old girl or guy you say its disgusting, what if i said, omg sex at 18? thats disgusting!  Or sex at 85? Thats wrong! Its just how you look at it, and to answer your question, its alight, you seem like a good, healthy (mentally and physically) Enjoy life, and when the time comes, grab it.|`|U2VF8cqNaa	my first time kissing a guy was when i was about 7, got finger when i was 8, had sex when i was 11. and i regret it . I really do, i wish i knew more then what i did then, guys they just want sex , They still do and im about to be 20, just wait til ur at least 17 .. its good for u ... oh n their is alot of stds out there|`|gmkUgFx5aa	i am 13 also, i have never kissed a guy... i kinda feel stupid but when we are 16 years old we will see who the ones that get pregnant are gonna be i already had a friend that had sex....and a bunch of other people that i no longer call firneds.|`|SNgcvrrXaa	No its not bad at all! im 12 and a lot of gurlz at my school have never had a bf but most of them hav. no one at my school cares whether u hav a bf or not. u should just wait until ur ready and dont take anything too fast!|`|8Vbd1ia3aa	no, you're really too young to have a bf let alone KISS one.<br>  <br>  why do you feel babyish? that's disgusting having sex at 13, why do you think like that!? if you want to then go ahead, but it's stupid. (no BEYOND stupid)|`|Y3DR1EBUaa	This isnt babyosh it is very resposible.. 13 is way to young to be having sex anyway... If i were u i would be very pround.. & when u meet the right guy u can share that special moment with him & not be labled|`|E2OKRhwYaa	No, you're waiting for someone you like and not just any old guy. It's not bad at all.|`|reb1AJcfaa	both my best friend  and me are 12 and never been kissed so don't feel alone. there must be millions of kids our age the same so don't freak over it.|`|wBOIDk2haa	nope, you'll do it in your own time and when your ready.|`|EWFtQNSdaa	Good for you!<br>  I think it's good actually.|`|EGiIcGOiaa	dont worryy it will happeeenn ... eventuallyy gl|`|Ij8OBOYqaa	no, its not bad. your still young and got plenty of time|`|aLAmvX5Naa	I think the problem is that society makes you feel bad for not kissing a boy at such a young age.<br>  <br>  If you haven't found a boy you like then you don't need to just go kissing some random stranger. It is good to value yourself and wait for the right guy to come along.|`|6qsTmMQaaa	Of course not! I'm seventeen and never kissed a girl.
1FhrbLOjaa	omg i have this exact same problem<br>  <br>  wat i do is frist,,,  , if u can cut the pill in half(make sure u chech with a doc. first tho cause sometimes its dangourous)<br>  <br>  second,,,  , take a small sip of ur drink and then put the  pill in and the take another sip of ur drink and kinda swish it round in ur mouth a bit and then just swallow<br>  <br>  or u ould try puttin it in icecream<br>  <br>  just dont think about it to much just pop the pill in and act like u would if the was just ur drink in ur mouth<br>  <br>  practise makes perfect it might be tough at first but after a little while ull get the hang of it<br>  <br>  good luck =) <33|`|eISzHe5maa	I know exactly how you feel. Before I turned 15 I hated taking pills, I was terrified of taking them so whenever I got cramps for my period I would have my mother crush me some pills and put them in my drinks....it was so nasty. <br>  <br>  Now I can swallow two pills without any problem. I guess just swallow it like you'd swallow your gum or any other food that doesn't involve chewing. Drop the pill in your mouth, drink something and tilt your head back and let it fall into your mouth. I usually for some reason leave my head tilted back for like five to ten seconds. <br>  <br>  Sorry I'm not that much of a help, but I hope it might somehow work!|`|27CpQJMCaa	You probably cant swallow pills because your scared of what might happen (choaking) <br>  i used to have this same problem, the pill used to just float in the water and i was scared to swollow<br>  <br>  what worked for me was not thinking about and just swallowing it <br>  u dont even feel it in your throught|`|PHVDwHfSaa	just swallow it directly when you put it in your mouth so you don't have that weird feeling of trying to swallow it or not.|`|yOr4SOO4aa	Show your tongue as long as u can and put the pill on the back of your tongue, then close in and swallow a big drink of water.|`|rPHGTyK2aa	it works better when you take pills with soda.<br>  idk why.<br>  but it does.|`|wnkoTEqVaa	put it on the top of your tongue get a class of water and take a big gulp of water.|`|yIdwMPsoaa	I used to be like you. I couldn't swallow pills. Just practice and take a lot of water.|`|mfBkH3qtaa	Well if i take a drink AFTER the pill is in my mouth I can't swallow it either. So I take a HUGE drink put the pill in REAL fast and swallow as fast as possible. Or I put the pill in my mouth on the back of my tongue and I get a glass of something i like to drink(Orange Juice, Chocolate Milk, Soda wtv) and I drink and drink until i know the pill is down.|`|A3zAXntxaa	I never used to be able to swallow pills either, but I just put a huge gulp of water in my mouth, then I threw in the pill then swallowed, it takes some practice. But, now I'm so used to it, I take pills without water. Haha. Good luck.|`|ZX2so3twaa	put it on the back of your tongue [sometimes you have to kinda push it there] and take a really big sip of water.|`|JgDRKLuLaa	Put it in your food and trick yourself like an animal.
rI0d7K9Zaa	I'm 39 weeks and 2 days and yesterday and last night I was dizzy and nausous too. I'm always tired so I can relate to that. Everything else you've said I'm experiencing the same things too. I'm not sure if it means labor is soon. My Dr. said that the nausea could be a sign that labor might start soon. But as of today nothing is happening. I know exactly how you feel though. I've been obsessing about going into labor for the last week or so. Everything even remotley out of the ordinary I think is a sign of labor. It never is though.|`|b457ca42a84d649f207ac8de710d5a89aa	My lamaze teacher told me that your body wants to clean itself out before labor, so maybe. I did get sick before mine. Good Luck and Congrats!|`|FfGHHhqBaa	heck yeah i had the same signs hun and went into labor in a matter of hours..... congrats|`|6cc543542598d9c7bc967e59c411667aaa	My niece did that with all 4 of her children. I hate to tell you this but she was sick all through labor.|`|8RfmosODaa	You could be close to labor. Some women to get sick and throw up when  they are in labor. If I were you I would take this time now to just sleep since you say you are tired.|`|qgJLZPDJaa	OH YES :) its a sign not many people talk about.<br>  but its very very much a sign. it happens before and sometimes during :)
bfb230dc1ac989ed2a0e37264327e8a1aa	It will take years of loving and caring for a child to accept someone as a father figure.  Just have patience.|`|pnL5WTXMaa	years and commitment|`|X0B8P8Yiaa	my best friend never had a dad and her step dad is so cool she says that never if she meat her dad would he replace her step dad she felt this way about him for a long time ever  senths she was 5<br>  <br>  she calls her step dad daddy and loves him very much <br>  <br>  her dad walked out on her a age 2|`|AA12107793	It will take some time and patient.
cP1Asd7waa	I prefer Annie because I havent really met anyone named Annie so it sort of seems kind of unique in my opinion. But in the end its all up to you. I hope I helped!|`|mgCvQx9jaa	Annie. Maria is over-used to me, but Annie is cute on a little girl but still suitable for a teenager and adult.<br>  <br>  Annie Charlotte sounds pretty to me. Or Annie Isabella.|`|0ZgoLkz8aa	maria is better because anni sounds really old|`|6BLDaRqJaa	neither !|`|jHDeIPEfaa	Maria is prettier.|`|UrZ8SFpqaa	I like Maria better because I can see a baby being named that but I can also see a grown woman named that.<br>  <br>  For Annie...it just sounds too old fashioned and boring to me.|`|Am54a7c0aa	I like Maria better. I just like the sound of it and it is very feminine.|`|u8slDDkLaa	I like maria<br>  it is true annie is common and little girlish but so cute<br>  (M-aa-rrey-yaah) spanish roots aah|`|2JTtd1z5aa	Maria- It's just a cute name<br>  Annie- Ew, reminds me of the orphan Annie, and I hate that movie :l|`|1sQAtgTaaa	maria..<br>  hmm idk it just sounds better and its pretty|`|sIqzhWMLaa	I'm not fond of either-both are old fashioned and boring. Marybe Marie for a middle name:<br>  <br>  Natalie Marie<br>  Charlotte Marie|`|MUp3wMThaa	I am not a big fan of either to be honest. However, if I HAD to pick one, I would definitely say Maria. I just really dislike Annie. It sounds old to me and is very boring.|`|qTWIoVEraa	How about Annemarie or Annemaria, or even Marianne?<br>  <br>  Maria sounds more Spanish/Latin.<br>  <br>  Annie reminds me of Annie Oakley or Little Orphan Annie. A very American-sounding name.|`|IE1TrA4Qaa	Maria is soooooooooo beautiful!! It reminds me of an exotic beauty whos friends with girl named hannah and maddie! ;)  Someone with big brown eyes too. And hair that is perfect. Who know me!!!!!!!!!|`|nfSZPpAHaa	I LOVE Maria :)<br>  <br>  Maria Annie is adorable and cute<br>  :)|`|lnZjIhDCaa	Um neither, they're both really plain and boring. If Maria was a middle name I wouldn't mind as much but Annie is sooo common.|`|KFT6ZbSbaa	maria. annie is gay, it reminds me of little orphan annie, the annoying curly haired BlTCH!|`|6QmVSwhsaa	How about Annie Marie, because Marie is a good girl middle name.
NePgB9b2aa	Not at all. Beautiful names, you have great taste! :)|`|uSpHh1NPaa	I love the name Bridgette. :)<br>  its really nice.<br>  It would flow perfect with lleana<br>  <br>  I really hate the name Margaret though. sorry.<br>  Evangeline is pretty though|`|6XRJT6Xbaa	No they are actually really different. The biggest different is that Bridgette isnt an ugly name.|`|3AfQ9UXYaa	No not at all. They're both lovely names by the way.|`|Elxuvon8aa	britt and maggie are okay but other wise they are quite similar.|`|ot0TqzSvaa	well if you like both names then you should name them that. but people are going to think that you deliberately named them similarly. But i suppose that doesnt matter once they're out of school no longer really asscociated with their twin as much. If you are still unsure, then u could maybe go with Brittany instead of Bridgette, or Marge instead of Margaret or something.

You can buy separates or bulk this way for really, really reasonable prices. <br>  <br>  If you prefer to go new, check amazon.com and Target. Also really affordable. <br>  <br>  Don't let boutiques or department stores lure you in to spend $100+ on one pair of maternity jeans. You won't need them for more than five months at most from this point and it just isn't worth it. <br>  <br>  Flowy shirts are in right now so I just buy longer shirts in my size or the next size up. :)<br>  <br>  GL|`|n8vBnA9Iaa	I stopped wearing maternity clothes after my daughter. We love thrift stores and when I was pregnant with our son, we bought a lot of stretchy dresses. For really cheap.

Anyways, thats what works for me.|`|59OfAFvTaa	ummm..... target has some maternity clothes so thats definatly cheep. and if target does walmart prob does too. usually malls have stores that specialize in maternity clothes and im pretty sure department stores (macys,carson perie scott, jc penny...) have maternity clothes <br>  <br>  <br>  GOOD LUCK WITH YOUR PREGNANCY AND YOUR SEARCH!!!!!!!|`|1pxKM9Buaa	motherhood maternity is a specific store, but most retail/department stores have a maternity section.<br>  <br>  i believe walmart even has maternity, old navy, kohls, jc penney etc|`|OCTvfDsxaa	Congratulations!

Xh00k0TRaa	My car definately, I can lock my car doors and if someone comes near it i could blow the horn to alert of danger. Which is much safer than a windowless house.|`|UrZ8SFpqaa	I'd stay in my car. I can lock the doors, set the alarm, and have radio! <br>  <br>  I also carry non-perishable food in my first aid kit.

In the guest house, I might feel kind of scared cause there aren't even any windows.|`|xyrSl2nSaa	i would take the guest house... and i would paint windows inside =) I don't like small spaces so i could not sleep in my car|`|PHVDwHfSaa	house, with a gun with me so I can protect myself while I'm sleeping.|`|dn2tsXlBaa	Car for one night|`|frA6foyRaa	Guest house. I wouldn't be looking at anything while i sleep, so not having a window is not a problem. What's more, sleeping in the car with everything closed and the engine running might cause you to die in your sleep as the poisonous gas from the car fumes might seep in and cause you to die. As the guest room is styled according to what i like, i wouldn't feel uncomfortable in it. If it is too dark, i might just get a nice soothing lamp in it.|`|2KqklP0Saa	Guest house. <br>  I can always buy a lamp, right?<br>  Build onto it maybe..<br>  Why the heck would I choose a car over a house. even if it is small it's bigger than a car..|`|rPH05I2jaa	Guest House some peps don't have an option like that and are forced to live in a car, make the best of wat you have!<br>  <br>  Does the house have no windows or a big hole? u might want to clarify!|`|Y3DR1EBUaa	mmm depends if it wasnt creapy & it was warm the guest house<br>  but if not the car|`|Uo0b2aShaa	car
jnuBYMAiaa	This is something you and your mother should discuss when both you and she has nothing to do and will not be interrupted. If she's curious as to why, explain your future plans of becoming a Gynecologist and this in-person action would help. Explain also that she's the closest female to you that you'd trust with something like this. It's not really odd, for there are children that are in the room with their parents when they're baby brother/sister is born. Just talk to her and respect whatever decision she makes As for the birthing videos, ask her about this. If she says yes to you witnessing the birth, I'm sure she won't mind the viewing of your birth video. As long as your motives are pure and your interest is in this medical field it's fine. There's nothing wrong with being a male who wants to deliver babies or study the female body earnestly and not out of hormones, for I wish to be Urologist and I'm a female. I think I'll be really good at it. Hope this helps.
zgBelCROaa	He is probably very stressed and nervous! Also it is really upsetting to lose a job and it really makes you feel bad about yourself. It is also very intimidating looking for another job. I would encourage him a lot and help him see all of the great skills that he has to offer. Also you should not tell him that he can't see his friends once the baby comes but explain that he will have to cut back (maybe have a friends night every friday and allow the same for you). Another problem...the pot. Everyone I know who still smokes is very immature, can't keep a job and is going nowhere in life. <br>  <br>  But he may change once the baby comes. I've seen friends do a complete 180 when their baby was born.|`|Y3DR1EBUaa	uhm I would be checkin him i think... that sounds pretty low to me i would straighten him out or leave him hangin.. you dont needto be under that kind of stress & he needs to step up & be a man & too helped make the baby He needs to take care of his child & woman|`|TorfpKnDaa	kick his *** into gear. Let him know that if he isent going to do anything to help support the family than he will be forced to support the baby by paying child support. Dont allow him to become a deadbeat.|`|62N5DC8qaa	Even tho' it sounds like he is trying to have his fun before he has to get down to buisiness he does need to really get busy with looking for a job ASAP because babies need's cost alot and he need's to be there for you , you are going thru alot your self, he may be down in the dumps over being layed off but he has alot of compition in looking for work as there are many, many people right now with out job's and you dont want to live on wellfare haveing the goverment own you so to speak but i would advise if you havent already apply for W.I.C. they will help with the nutrious foods that you need now and do the same for your baby girl after she is born, and yes ! i do think you have a right to get made at your boyfriend if he is going to be a big part of you and your daughters life then he need's to step up to the plate !!!|`|WmKjeUELaa	It sounds like he isn't ready to become a father.  I would tell him that he really needs to learn how to be more responsible if he is going to father the child.  Babies do not come cheap!  Also explain to him that stress is not good on you or the baby and that he needs to start looking after you more.  Also, if he is into drugs now, and hasn't changed his habits by now, more than likely he won't, even after the baby comes.  My friend had this same problem with her boyfriend when they had their first baby.  He promised to stop hanging out so much with his friends and stop smoking pot, but kept doing it after the baby was born.  In fact, they have 2 kids now, and he still does this.|`|rI0d7K9Zaa	You do have a right to be mad and frustrated. My boyfriend lost his job when I was about 29 weeks pregnant (I'm 39 weeks now)  and it was about 3 weeks before Christmas too. I worked in retail so I was working over 40 hours a week and I was really resenting that fact that he was just sitting around at home. He applied for some jobs online but wouldn't actully leave the house and go hand out resumes. It took him about 3 weeks to start working again and we have never fought so much as we did when I was working at 7 months pregnant and he was sitting around on his ***. Hopefully your man will get his sh*t together and start working before your baby comes. Keeping in mind that even after he gets a new job it usually takes 3 weeks before he'll get a full pay cheque. You have every right to be mad!!!|`|w9jx0JYLaa	yes you have every right to be upset..he's not being responsible at all! I would snap if he was my boyfriend, I would tell you parents to make him pay rent or something so that he has no choice but to have an income|`|i0Xboevfaa	hes a PUNK no dude should aact that way girlseriously dont put up with that plus what is he doing with his friends all day ask him to take you hes so immature i thimk he should be with you right now cause your going through your pregnancy|`|wMPjuKycaa	Yeah you do have an excuse to be upset.  It's not fair to us that we can't do the same things they do.  We are carrying the baby.  You gotta remember girls mature faster then boys.  And just make him keep his word on what he said. You guy's need to do something fun together so he'll want to hang out w/u.  Some guy's want to get out bc we are nagging them, and they're doing fun things w/their boys and they can't do it w/us.  So find something fun to do together so he'll want to stay and kick it w/u..
OLXv3DEAaa	The problem with this name is its too much like Deja Vu which is a really dumb thing to name your kid and is what most people will associate the name with, not the idea behind it that you think of. Its very silly even though I kinda like the idea. You don't have to put that in her name though just raise her like that and she will get it. <br>  <br>  Also you'd kinda have to spell it Deja-Belle, 'daja' doesn't mean 'already' in French or any other language as far as I know? So Daja would be pointless IMO plus she'd still get the teasing just from having it pronounced like that. She would definitely get teased.|`|dVJOF4Bhaa	Right when I heard it I thought of Daja-vu, and maybe other kids might if she gets teased. <br>  <br>  What about names that mean beautiful like:<br>  Aerilyn<br>  Ayanna<br>  Arabella<br>  Callia<br>  Callie|`|98cJg2pCaa	How is it pronounced?<br>  <br>  And no offence but I do think it sounds silly and she probabley will get teased for it :(|`|UzGGflRfaa	I was going to name my baby Deja KAILANI.............whhich is an awesome name...........that sounds better than Deja Belle....and BTW my last name is Bell.....u know how much we got made fun of cuz of that last name?,,,,,LOL|`|qTWIoVEraa	Deja-Belle reminds me of Deja-vu. Once the kids in her class learn about deja-vu, they will annoy her with it for a while.<br>  <br>  Daja-Belle has a bit of an oriental flavor to it.<br>  <br>  The name's meaning and the thought behind it is cute, but I think its a bit of a mouthful for the playground. Maybe name her something else with a similar meaning, or shorten it to "Belle". Then, when she is older you can tell her the story of why you chose her name, and she'll be thankful that she won't have to deal with so much teasing for having such a unique name.<br>  <br>  Good luck in picking the right name ;)|`|zGjZG1wSaa	I don't like it. Just remember, even though they are called 'baby names', they will have those names for the rest of their life until they die. Don't be cruel and give them a name that is silly. Sorry.|`|1dHe0Hfdaa	I like Deja-Belle...<br>  <br>  <br>  But I would add a note to all of her teachers to call her Belle...she might get made fun of cause of the "Deja"...|`|5JwGaB6haa	find another|`|j0Jkq4z2aa	no.<br>  i dont like it<br>  sorry<br>  Isabelle or belle is nice on its own<br>  daja or deja maybe a middle?|`|4BBjhHAnaa	I think it would be a great nickname for staying in your family.  I, personally, dislike when people make up names.  Perhaps her name could be Isabelle or Anabelle or something like that?|`|mZi7R0Enaa	I love Belle but by itself!!!!!
drI1vsJdaa	She's insecure. I'd tell her you think it's ridiculous what she's doing, and needs to decide on who she wants.|`|tDKQ8lwsaa	ur friend is seriously stubborn because she doesn't know how to handle herself. tell ur friend that she has two choices:<br>  <br>  1. stay as his bf<br>  2. break up with him PERMANENTLY<br>  <br>  swapping and alternating between the two makes her a whore. tell her she's being really stubborn, but she can fix the problem if she makes a decision.|`|Fcv0ol0Vaa	o, i hate when ppl have on/off relationships. <br>  <br>  tell her that breaking up w/ him is not worth getting mad over. now, she can go out w/ better guys. plus, on/off relationships never work, the two are essencly cheating on each other when they date during them.|`|TXKKOa1Jaa	she has insecurity issues.  I would talk things out...
BeNazR8Jaa	Sounds like your friend was just jealous of your good friendship with her husband. Some women are like that, even though deep down they know nothing is going on. Or maybe she just has trust issues. But since it happened while she was pregnant, maybe it was just her hormones talking. You know how sensitive we can get during that time..that's understandable.  <br>  Seems like your friend is sorry and is happy to see you again. I would just forgive her and be good friends again like the good times. A little misunderstanding, a little conflict is okay to have. They're all forgiveable.|`|wLTWHUYyaa	Be honest....did you fu*k her husband? <br>  <br>                               Best of luck<br>  <br>                            your pal in the pen|`|yT3Jyo3Laa	I say just go ahead and talk to her and try to get that friendship going again. Ya never know!|`|5EFc1QYbaa	You're clearly a woman of faith and realize God has placed this person in your life for a reason.  I've made mistakes in the past and lost friends by putting up a wall and closing the door.  I recently reconnected with one of my very best friends and we have a wonderful relationship again.  I knew I was taking the risk of being hurt (I would have deserved it if she told me to take a hike!) by contacting her, but she looked beyond our past and was willing to move forward.  You obviously had a pretty good relationship.  Take it slow and see how things progress.<br>  <br>  Good luck and God bless!|`|OXaT6E2vaa	Well If you feel that her friendship is very important than talk to her and ask her why she stoped talking to you. Get answers so you guys can become close again.|`|q7HvkRpyaa	It may have just been the pregnancy hormones making her act the way she did to start with. I know I was kinda nasty when I was pregnant with my son and tuned out a lot of people that I normally wouldn't. Maybe your friend was going through some troubled times with her marriage and the fact that her husband was coming over doing stuff at your house bothered her. There's no telling. However, if she is back to her normal self and trying to talk to you, I'd go with it. Everyone goes through things and reacts to them differently. Regardless of past situations, she does deserve a second chance, even if you are cautious about it until you know that she is sincere and is truly your friend. Remember, God says to forgive and not to hold grudges for past wrongs.|`|LMc23g9Maa	I'd be giving her a cool shoulder for a while until I can suss it out.  I find those people who are friendly then ignoring you quite annoying.

kM8dCoYqaa	my son didn't eat ANYTHING for 5 days and he threw up about 30 times. I did have to take him to the hospital because he was so dehydrated.  if your little one only through up a few times then he will probably be ok. As long as he is taking in liquids and is keeping HYDRATED! That's the most important think, wet mouth, wet eyes (not sunken in), and at least one wet diaper every six hours. Be sure to introduce liquids and foods slowly. give him 1 oz of milk every 15-20 minutes. if he gulps it, it's too hard on his tummy. just make sure he's putting in more then he's putting out.|`|M3gUcMdOaa	Definitely no milk or dairy products, plenty of fluids-warm water with glucose does helps.

DsLx6Sixaa	No wearing a condom is not perfect. But it is pretty close.<br>  <br>  Here is my advice: Wear a condom (latex condom with a built in spermicidal lubricant), and then when you think you are going to ejaculate, withdraw. Don't ejaculate inside.<br>  <br>  Perfect? No. But pretty close.<br>  <br>  The condom will protect you and her from transfering STDs. Even if the condom does break or comes off, the spermicide may be enough to protect you from pregnancy if there is a little leakage.<br>  <br>  No, it is not 100% sure, but if you do it right, it is probably the best form of birth control since condoms do reduce the risk of STDs.|`|jK9H6PHiaa	the only 100% way to prevent pregnancy is abstinence. female condoms are less effective as male condoms. also don't use just birth control as it won't protect against stds.|`|cj7sSPZEaa	You shouldn't use a female condom and a male condom together, but you can use just a female condom and spermicide or a male condom with spermicide and a diaphragm with spermicide for the girl.  A condom is highly effective if it remains intact, but they can easily break and make them ineffective at preventing pregnancy, so the safest thing to do is to always use more than one form of contraceptive.|`|K5IOSGXAaa	Nothing is enough, if you don't want a child don't have sex. If you are of age and married, then you should consider one of the birth control devices that are out there that are inserted by a doctor, either under the skin etc. that are the most effective, and use a condom as well.|`|5yAsj29Vaa	The only method of birth control that is 100% effective is abstinence.  A condom alone is not enough, but then again nothing is ENOUGH if you don't want a baby.  Unless, of course, you get a hysterectomy.|`|3cLE5L7Saa	Check this out|`|4WgsBvq1aa	no wearing a condom isn't enough,<br>  we all wish but there's too many chances you take with a condom, if it breaks, has a hole, comes off etc...<br>  and sadely enough some people have had no problems with the actual condom and still fallen pregnant even by using one.<br>  because there's no 100% guarentee with any contraceptive, is always safer to use a number of them to decrease the risk of pregnancy, eg: the pill, comdoms etc<br>  best of luck.|`|w2kofruFaa	Scroll down until you see Cervical Barriers in a blue-green color.

There is only one way to be 100% covered and that is just by not having sex.|`|AA10327722	One of you needs to be wearing a condom, not both.  If you both wore one then the friction would make a whole it one or both.|`|1B91qtNQaa	Listen I got pregnant on the pill.

They are 9 and 5 and from the time we met they were drawn to him and he loves them and treats them as his own. We are now expecting a child together and the kids are so excited. My husband had stated many months ago that he was worried that he would favor his child over mine, but I don' t think that will happen. He wants the kids to be there after the baby is born and for them to spend as much time with him as they can.<br>  My sisters husband also loves and treats her kids as if they were his own.<br>  I have heard of bad stories also, but it's all about how you introduce and keep an eye out for how he is with your child when you are around and when he thinks you are not.|`|AA12221392	my husband is better than their father.

It's a fine balancing act.|`|ghz5D5iLaa	You just have to make sure that they are good with your kids. When step parents treat the kids bad the other parent ignores it sometimes.

He was great with him and treated him like his own. We had two more children and he still treated him like  his own. That child is going on 19 and closer to my husband than anyone.

RGMnbDPNaa	wow you are superwoman, i think that what you want to do is an awesome idea so go for it, when you kids start going to school why don't you suggest to you husband to get a part time job.............. i think you'll <br>  will do an amazing job<br>  God bless|`|NEPUONqyaa	from personal experience its probably not the best idea but if its your dream go for it. nursing school takes up ALOT of your time. i graduated a 2 year program so i know. theres tons of studying and you take lecture classes plus clinicals. in order to learn everything it takes a great amount of time. plus your going to be working which i also did thru school. at the end of your program you have to do a preceptorship which consists of anywhere from 120 hours plus depending on where you go. imagine your working your regular job too. then you have your family to care for. i did not have any children when i went through school but several of my classmates did. i know it was exteremly hard on them and they didnt get much sleep. the world will not end in 3 yrs and if it does you will take care of plenty of patients in clinincals. you sound like you have a real passion to care for people but you need to be able to take care of them and your husband in my personal opinion i think it would be way too much to handle but shoot for your dreams only you know yourself. good luck! nursing is a great profession|`|ETcBRko3aa	REALITY CHECK<br>  <br>  Um, doing all this, do you really think you are "caring" for your children.  It sounds like your husband is doing or will be doing most of the caring as the stay-at-home dad...(while you are studying, driving to and from college, waitressing, etc)<br>  <br>  ...that being said, since foster children are not "easy" he SHOULD have a major say about this....as he is going to be doing the majority of the work.<br>  <br>  You are being selfish and it is unreasonable to take in a foster child who is going to have ALOT of issues and NEEDS and then you abandon that foster child for everything else YOU WANT  to do.<br>  <br>  Again, here we are with YOUR WANTS AND DESIRES.<br>  Children should come first and foster children really NEED to come first.|`|aed5cad075214254f2f176a51206a7d7aa	I don't know about unreasonable.  I think you're superwoman to juggle all of that.  Boy, you must have some energy, send some over this way would ya|`|P2yRAWiJaa	Wait.  You have 3 kids, go to school all day, work on the weekends and your husband stays at home???  How is THAT fair???<br>  <br>  I'd make hubby get a job...even part time...to help with bills.  That way you could definitely fit an extra child into your schedule without things being unreasonable.|`|33c0b6060f319b3537f5ec8348f23f45aa	I am not sure you would be able to foster. Most counties require at least one parent to be a stay at home parent. That way the foster child is getting the attention they need and not being pawned off to a babysitter or sitting in daycare all day.|`|2zMtWFnNaa	Think about it this way.  Being a career woman and a mom is very hard to begin with.  You can do both, but something will suffer at one time or another.  If your child is sick then either your job suffers the loss of you not being there, or your child suffers by you not being there for them.  <br>  <br>  Waitressing will take you away from home on weekends and holidays when your children are home from school, taking away what little time you may have to spend with them.  If you have to, then you have to though.<br>  <br>  A foster child needs the extra attention and time.  Regardless of the situation, that child needs the extra support.  There are many career women that do it.  BUT, when a child is removed from the home, even if it is a matter of losing both parents to an accident, they have what they at least, felt as the stability and love from someone (not saying that it really was love or stable).  When they are put into another home, they get even more confused.  They really need someone there to help them through their rough spots, not just someplace to lay their heads at night, no matter how much better the family structure is.<br>  <br>  If you really want to help, then either wait until you have more time, or spend the time you can.<br>  <br>  The world MAY end in 3 years, or you may end up dead in an accident tomorrow.  One never knows.  But trying to do everything isn't always best.  Doing what you can best is much better.  In other words, a half-a~~ed job on a lot of things is not better than a great job on a few things.|`|511e806a702f7f4b678843ad2696165faa	If you are doing all these wonderful things, who is taking care of the children?  It would be a shame to bring in a foster child and put them immediately into day care.  More likely than not, this child will need special care and attention at the beginning.  If you don't have enough time to devote to this, it isn't fair to the child.  You already have 3 children.  Bringing in someone who is going to need extra time and attention might make your other children feel less than special.  I would say wait a while until you are done with school and can take time off from working to focus solely on child care.  Then you would have your ducks in a row and could do all the things necessary to ensure that the child gets what they need.  Your other children need to be taken care of first and foremost.  I agree that you are biting off way more than a person doing all those things can chew.  I am a stay at home mother, and I hardly have time to do all that needs to be done here.  I can't imagine working AND going to school AND taking care of another child who may have special needs.  Give yourself some time, there will always be wonderful children in foster care who you can help.
uCnmYEPBaa	start by going to a local pet store and find a flea treatment that is non-toxic, sprinkle or spray it in your on a saturday morning with the windows rolled up so the fleas will die, then in the afternoon vacuum it thoroughly including in the crevasses as much as you can. Take the baby seat and take the cloth out and wash it in hot water, check it over well before putting it back on the seat and check the rest of the seat well too.<br>  All you can do it the best you can and keep an open eye for any little critters.<br>  And treat your dog for fleas and don't let it back in the car until the fleas are gone.|`|GxMSrrFLaa	never heard of salt. hmmmmm...... I know lavender works from experience.|`|AA11210211	Salt,Put some salt in the floor board and leave it there for a few days it will get rid of the fleas.

You seem like you have varied interest (tap. flute, piano, cheerleading, volleyball...)|`|p25p9jTYaa	you're practically just like me, except i think i'm a little less average...|`|tDKQ8lwsaa	hmm well i don't see anything that's not "average" or normal.|`|dn2tsXlBaa	wow u sound like a kool chick!!! lol<br>  don't listen to ur bro|`|8e5YBwd7aa	Yes ,But its good,I wanna be a day In you're shoes!<br>  It sounds fun:)<br>  He he<br>  <br>  -Hope I helped Adrianna?

AA10280194	My husband goes with me to the ultrasounds but there's really no reason he needs to go with me to routine appointments.  When it comes time for classes he will go with me though and he will be there for the birth.|`|VHHis05Naa	He has gone to a couple, but has been to every ultrasound.   My appointments right now are very short and there's not much reason for him to be there.|`|AA11210211	My husband came to just about all with our first but none with our second,but that was due to work,he was a Cadre for Deployment Training so he worked long hrs.|`|6PhSENcXaa	Chris came with me to everything with all 8 children.  He never once gave it a thought he was there for every appointment that there was.  <br>  I never had to tell him about appointments he would ask me each Sunday night if I had and appointment that week and if I did he would mark it down and put it in his wallet.  Just when I thought he forgot he would show up 30 minutes before the appointment.  Never later never missed and appointment.|`|q7HvkRpyaa	My husband has never gone to any of my normal appointments  with either pregnancy. He has gone to all the ultrasounds except one, but normal dr. visits he doesn't go to. I don't really care though. It's not really a guy thing. Plus he has to work the same hours the doctor's office is open so he really couldn't go if he wanted to.|`|XhIYAH6Laa	My husband only went to 2 of my appts...and only one scan (because we thought something was wrong). His job made it so he couldn't come (Active duty CG) but it didn't bother me....now this pregnancy he is gone until I will be 22 weeks so no appts or scans this time around either....it kind of sucks but there isn't anything I can do....|`|aLAmvX5Naa	My husband went to the 20 week ultrasound and was there for labor and delivery. The rest of the appointments were pretty boring, no reason for him to sit there and watch my blood pressure be checked.|`|5WYeHh0paa	My husband has come to every single doctors appointment with me and will be attending lamaze classes with me and will be there for the birth. He comes into every appt. ever scan, he's there for it all.

Personally I like going by myself.|`|dCLnLlsCaa	Nope.  My husband only came to the ultrasound and birth!|`|qMJCKw0qaa	As the husband i did and it was great|`|w9jx0JYLaa	My boyfriend has been to all the scans, trips to the hospital and pretty much every doctors appointment. He doesn't go into my checkups, but always takes me, and just waits in the waiting room.<br>  My boyfriend however isn't going to prenatal classes with me, but thats because its too conflicting with his work scheduale, so i understand.|`|Fp86T7yjaa	Both my husband and I are in grad school full time and we both work, so it's hard enough for me to get the time off to go to my doc, not to mention to coordinate for both of us to go. But he did go with me for anatomical scan and to one emergency appointment. He's also planning on going with me to childbirth class and hospital tour. I don't mind that he's not there for regular check ups.|`|XRCGaQW5aa	My fiance I think only missed 1 of our appointments with our daughter. This time he hasn't missed one. I personally think it is an important part of sharing the experience with eachother.|`|QKfjIy7Naa	I'm 36 weeks pregnant and my hubby only missed 1 of my appointments so far :) this is our first and we both are very excited!|`|WmKjeUELaa	My husband has been to every single appointment with me thus far, and he plans to attend all of them.  We start childbirth classes next week, and are both excited!  =)|`|TorfpKnDaa	my BF has only come to my 2 ultrasounds and my first midwife appointment 2 weeks ago.|`|d6r5hRjYaa	my ex husband came to the ultrasound and was outside my room when i delivered. its normal.  on the other hand my sisters husband was there for every appt. but i dont think that is necassary|`|jlrfkXj2aa	my bf comes to every appt and u/s. it's really nice that he does, otherwise my mom would go. that would be ok too.|`|c20207b79edb6a1d68e27d7750bd7d9caa	pretty much all of them =D
cP1Asd7waa	In my opinion you should choose Mirie because it means Sea Bright.  Maybe you want Miriam because it means sea of bitterness.

It was one of my favorites and I was so bummed when it ended.  For awhile I thought about naming my daughter Michaela Nicole but my husband thought we had too many Mikes in the family already (my dad's first name, my brother's middle name, my husband's uncle, one of his cousins,  and two of my sister-in-law's dads are all Michael) so we went with Rose Elizabeth for the baby.  Rose because I love both the flower and the movie "Titanic", and Elizabeth because it's my grandma's middle name.|`|uKpkOss0aa	I know someone whose name is the same as yours but different spelling.

7lmtBhdMaa	You might need to see a head Dr.. First you might want to get married. That would keep the baby from being born out of wedlock (that means they aren't little bastards, and you have some nerve wanting a baby so that YOU'LL feel better. How does that baby you aborted feel now. Having a baby now won't fix anything. You just need to grow up and get a life. Your b/f has more sense than u do.|`|uCnmYEPBaa	Sounds like you are the one who needs to make things right.<br>  Don't' try to force or trick him into having a baby before BOTH of you are ready.<br>  Hold onto your fiance to make you happy until you are truly ready to have a baby to hold.|`|dPULl5hjaa	troll|`|jcTnOE8uaa	No. It wont fix it, it wont make it better. <br>  You had an abortion and some people will say you were wrong for that, it is what it is. But the worst thing you can do it try to have a baby when you arent ready to try to make up for it. <br>  Just wait. if he loves you and you were meant to be then he will get past this as will you. Dont rush and do something silly like have a baby when you arent ready.|`|5yAsj29Vaa	Having a baby won't "fix" the fact you already had an abortion.  That is a life that you can never re-create.  If your fiance wants to wait, you should respect that.  If you can't, then you're not the one for him.|`|7add460ae24c9452ae87b5a99c5aa756aa	Its the past.  You need to work through it before you can have another baby.<br>  How old are you?

That is not reason enough to have a baby! Neither is having a baby to make you happy.<br>  <br>  Think this over. After you get married, you two can talk this out. Right now if you want something, get a pet or something. There, you can love it and pets make you happy.|`|SxgOy9uPaa	I will answer your,question first## No will not make things better,probably make Fiancee take large steps away from you..IF your not comfortable or happy with yourself.then you will continue to beat yourself up & no amount of clutching @ straws will help that..Will only make things worse if it appears to be not working..You sound like a good person,who has lost direction..Please don't be angry with me,for what i'm about to suggest.."MY" suggestion is to make,yourself available,to a SHELTER in your neighborhood,perhaps a Police blue light program,or an Orphanage that's close to where you live##Thereby being able to see,first hand what trying to make amends can lead too..Sorry if i sound bitter,i'm not. Just would like for you to see for yourself,the consequence's of trying to get happy @ little peoples expense,when they didn't ask to come into this world..My best wishes to you,good luck in whatever you decide,stay well.."PS" you may EMAIL,if you think it will help..|`|IA5zVfk0aa	just give him time :) and its fiance*.. i know people are gonna be mean because you had an abortion, but it is in the past, nothing you can do now.. if you want a baby, give him time and than he'll be ready :) dont try to make it up for what you did, just wait until your ready !|`|9bhZVJ61aa	Hunny having an abortion is a big big big big big sin that precious child will not fix only confession will. I only say this because im was wondering if you will be able to tell your new child some day that you killed there little brother or sister before they had a chance to take their first breath.|`|AA11206135	You can have 10 babies but it will never fix what you have already done...|`|xMy0QEvFaa	Your trying to bring a baby into this world for the wrong reason.|`|EbUJ7ML5aa	i think that you should wait until both you AND your fiance are ready...if you try to force responsibility on him (which is what having a baby when he's not ready will do), then it might result in resentment and perhaps an end to your relationship. Also, a baby should not have to fulfill the duty of making you happy or to reconcile a regret that you have, and to have a baby for that reason is wrong and selfish. I empathize with the guilt you might have for having an abortion, but I think that this guilt is something you should try to let go of. What's done is done and there's no point in worrying over something that you can't change. Hope this helps :)|`|izSUt509aa	you may need to get some counseling to help you deal with the abortion.  Unless your bf is ready, coercing him will not make everything right.  You really need to be happy before you have a child.  don't depend on having a baby to improve your outlook.  children can be very stressful (as well as an absolute delight).  Please, get some help for yourself and make sure you are a happy and loving family before you bring a new life into it.  if a child does not change your outlook and you end up still unhappy, you are only punishing yourself, your bf and the innocent new life.<br>  <br>  And to Baby Bens....please don't tell anyone they have sinned.  You are not God and only God can judge someone|`|KMtd5gr0aa	Past or furture? Well it is a bit selffish to say i want one and ur going to want one to. In time he will want one too. Also i would wait tell ur married before trying to become pregnant. There is too many women out there that are alone with these babies when there WAS a man there promising them the world and then dipped out because kids were just too much 4 them.|`|uBGFJr1taa	another baby isnt always the answer. It will fill that void that was caused but may not help.|`|Y3DR1EBUaa	If u wanted a baby u shouldnt have killed the other

f9fmvB9gaa	I prefer Audrey Ann. I think it flows better and is just cuter. With Aurora all I can think of is Sleeping Beauty, so again, I don't prefer it!<br>  <br>  Also, the meaning of a name is really important to me when considering it and the meaning of Audrey is noble strength. The meaning of Ann is merciful or gracious. Considering the meanings of the names as well, Audrey Ann goes together perfectly. The meaning of Aurora is Goddess of the Dawn-you don't want to jinx yourself if these are names you're considering for a new baby  ;)|`|6zDZ9ZBOaa	Audrey.<br>  The English name Audrey means - "noble strength." Among notable people with this name are actresses Audrey Hepburn and Audrey Meadows|`|eqPFKpVqaa	I reaaaaallllyy like the name Audrey.<br>  But if the middle name is ann, i like Aurora better.<br>  Aurora is a really cute name as well :) <br>  good luckk.|`|4vPgwOwDaa	audrey ann|`|ZX2so3twaa	they're both pretty, but i like audrey better with ann.|`|u7UnUZXnaa	aurora|`|pFxNunMxaa	Aurora -because it is so unique and very beautiful.

23MPcnNqaa	Is there anyway you would consider using it as a middle name??<br>  <br>  I'm sure your mom will understand if you decide not to use it.  A baby's name is the first gift in life that you give them, and they will have it for life.  You should pick a name that is special and meaningful to you!!<br>  <br>  Good luck.|`|ZX2so3twaa	i don't care for that name either.<br>  i would ask her if there were any other names she likes.|`|kKmuFi4zaa	I like Presley, but it is your child, it's your decision. Maybe you two could sit down and discuss other names together.|`|qUS9Zwl6aa	What about Preston for a boy? It still has that Pres sound - and you can use it as a middle name. For a girl I dunno, can't think of a name to get the combo. But honestly the name is up to you, your mom had her chance (not being rude) and now it's yours.|`|jcTnOE8uaa	OHHH NOOO! dont do that. thats a horrible name. tell her that maybe she can pick out of like 10 names or something that she can help with.|`|o9Ckf0h4aa	Tell her the truth!!!! You are older now, you have changed your mind! It's your prerogative.|`|6QmVSwhsaa	If you dont like the name dont name it that, you will regret it trust me. You will have this baby 18 years im sure saying a name that you dont like for 18 years will not make you the happiest mom. I know you want you're mom to be happy so compromise with her like maybe Preston instead of presley. But dont let her talk you into something you dont want|`|ea325e13e7dc9a824f29fe89faa7edafaa	I have to agree- it is your child and thus your privilege to name them. I also agree Preston is a good compromise if you like that name. If not, asking your mother to assist you in the naming would be a good idea- then she will feel included and, as was said, if you make it fun you both will be happy in the end.<br>  <br>  Best of luck!|`|bvjvV8k9aa	No, I don't like Presley as a first name but as a middle name it is fine. Why does your mother have to be involved with the naming? The baby is yours not hers. If she absolutely must be involved, how about you choose some names first and out of those names let her pick what she likes.|`|D0y3MwDcaa	I LOVE the name Presley.. one of my friends is named that(: It is spelled Presleigh so it looks more feminine.

Hes really nice and funny also!<br>  <br>  I think you should at least use it as a middle name just for your mother!|`|aohKqXraaa	This is your baby and while I understand you want to please your mom, this is your chance to name your child.. she had her chance to name you Presley and didn't do it.  Don't feel bad.. this is YOUR baby.. name it whatever you want.|`|lnZjIhDCaa	Give your daughter her middle name, she'll get over it. You shouldn't feel bad about it, it's her dream not yours. If it makes you feel any better, I don't like the name either.|`|1sQAtgTaaa	you can give your mom more option andd see if she changes her mind..<br>  but if she insists in the babys name to be that.. well put it as a middle name..|`|3w7VztEWaa	its your baby you name here/him what you like.|`|eqPFKpVqaa	Well if you don't like it then don't name your child it.<br>  Talk to your mom about some different names and see<br>  if she likes them. Its YOUR child, im sure your mother<br>  will understand if you wannah name it something you like.<br>  Its gunnah be your child for 18 or so years, so you mine as<br>  well name it something you like.. its your kid. Not hers. :)<br>  <br>  But i understand you want your mom to be involved, so maybe<br>  just sit down and talk with her about some different name combo's.<br>  :D GOOD LUCKK!|`|cZ1M59wAaa	I love the name Presley! My cousin named her now nearly 5 month old daughter that!|`|qTWIoVEraa	Maybe the two of you can look at baby name books together and make a list of names she likes and that you also like. Try to pronounce the strangely-spelled ones in weird ways (aloud). Then compare the lists and laugh about the funny-sounding ones. Even if you don't agree on the names she chose or vice-versa, it will still be a fun bonding experience for the both of you, and she will feel involved. <br>  <br>  Another possible solution is to give the baby you mother's name as a second name or use some variation of it in the baby's name. Ex: Your mother's name is Charlotte, so if the baby's a boy you could give him the second name Charlie or Charles. A girl version would be to call her Lottie (Char-LOTTE) or give her Charlotte as her second name. Or give her your mother's second name. I'm sure your mother would be proud to know her grand-baby was named after her.<br>  <br>  Best of luck ;)

veO1RXrCaa	Honey labour hurts.  Its not sunshine and roses.  Being induced while not fun is fast.  So instead of lingering with painful contractions for days waiting for it to get rolling, you are being put on the fast track.  Be prepared that it will come fast and hard.  But you can do it!  I was induced and was in hard labour + pushing for only 8 hours.  I say only bc it seemed fast to me and I had complications.  My son was face up and had he been the right way Im sure I would have been done sooner.  You will be amazed at what you can handle.  Don't be afraid!  You can and will do this and be great at it!|`|Fy9S6hjIaa	Well, I was induced at exactly 39 weeks.  The put the pill on my cervix and were going to start pitocin 12 hours later just like you.  Well, the little pill thing worked so well that they never even had to use the pitocin.  As a matter of fact, my son was born 9 hours later.  The actual being induced does not hurt, but the contractions do lol.  <br>  <br>  It's normal to be nervous, but no need to worry.  Honestly, I would ask my doctor why he was planning on inducing me early if I were you.  That way you don't have to worry about it.  It's probably nothing to be concerned about.<br>  <br>  Good luck and congrats|`|dCLnLlsCaa	I would tell your impatient, idiot doctor that you don't want to be induced!  It's up to you if you want to be, but you sound like you don't want to be induced so don't do it.  It's your body, I am so sick of this bs from doctors!  We are women, our bodies were made to go through childbirth!  Go to www.dona.com and find a doula to attend labor with you. YOu deserve to enjoy this experience.  Good luck to you and congradulations!|`|KMtd5gr0aa	Well ofcourse it will hurt. This is going to be one of the mos painfull things U ever go through. Alot of people say having pain meds are 4 pussys i didnt have anything with my first 3 but the 4th i did and i wish i would have taken pain meds with the other 3. They make having baby easy!|`|xjZNnFLtaa	It didnt hurt me, that's all I can tell you.  Good luck.|`|W1p6LetFaa	I have heard some awful stories about induction like some of the other answerers have listed, but I've heard some really good things too!  One of my good friends had to be induced.  Yes, her contractions started off with a bang and they were very painful, but because of the induction, she dilated very quickly as was able to get an epidural almost right away.  She said she didn't feel the rest of her contractions until she had the urge to push!  She said she still felt it then and it was still a little painful to push, but that she overall really enjoyed her experience and hopes all of her births are like this one!  So you never know!  Best wishes to you and your little one!|`|ofGZHZt1aa	I was 38 weeks pregnant and induced because of sudden blood pressure spark.   I Would NOT recomend it at all!! I was induced and because ofthe medicine my contrations were 2x worse but it did not do anything for my dialation.... After 26 hours of contractions I was still only 2 CM dialated.... The babys blood pressure slowed  because the pain medicine and 2 failed epadorals and i was rushed in for an emergency C section ....  The baby was fine and healthy and 5 months old now but i will never foret the experence.....<br>  <br>  <br>  As for you, Since you have already been having contractions it might be a little better but anymore i think that doctors are pushing women to be induced because it is mire convenent for them and they can work around it......   I highly recomend future women to try very hard to not be induced!!!|`|NEPUONqyaa	first off if there is nothing harming your baby - you do not have to be induced. just tell your doctor you would rather wait for natural labor to begin. if your already having contractions it will probably not be that long anyways. i personally don't know your doctor so this may not be the case but being in the medical field i know some doctors induce for there convience not yours. they induce you at a certain time so they won't be up at 2am delivering your baby. if you want to wait just tell them you have patient rights for everything
BjEr7FGUaa	women who get abortions should HAVE to get their tubes tied after|`|aLAmvX5Naa	Two Yaz pills does not in any way equal plan B. Plan B has way more hormones. You are actually quite fertile after an abortion.<br>  <br>  Did you go to a check up after your abortion? Even if you don't have time to go to planned parenthood you should get a post-abortion check up and possibly a pregnancy test as well.|`|Yn2n26zXaa	You really need to get to a doctor. While taking high doses of birth control is /technically/ the same thing as plan b, it has been considered to be not enough. My advice? Stop having sex. I'm not saying it to be mean, but honestly...if you can't handle all the responsibility that comes with sex, including unwanted pregnancies, then you shouldn't be having sex. I understand condoms break. So having said that, if you have been taking your birth control and you used a condom the chances are slim. BUT they are there. I got pregnant during my period while on birth control and using a condom. Make sure you/him are putting the condom on correctly. That means putting a lubricant with Nonoxynol- 9, {spermicide} on the inside and outside of the condom. You can also try using condoms and a vaginal contraceptive film {see the link}. Abortions can mess your cycle up pretty good so I would wait about another week and do an at home test. If it comes back negative and you still don't get your period, go to the doctor. Good luck.<br>  <br>  ETA:<br>  Actually plan b contains LESS hormones than most birth control pills. plan b is progestin based while daily birth control pills contain two hormones, progestin and estrogen.<br>  <br>  <br>  This chart shows how to safely take daily birth control as plan b.<br>  <a href="http://ec.princeton.edu/questions/dose.html" rel="nofollow">http://ec.princeton.edu/questions/dose.h...</a>|`|oQ5oKILHaa	You should be ashamed of yourself. You were had an abortion and your next move was to have sex? It seems like the logical thing to do after doing something so traumatic is to STOP HAVING SEX! Abortion is wrong. And even if it is right IT IS NOT #^&!*&^ BIRTHCONTROL!|`|dCLnLlsCaa	You and your partner are way too irresponsible to have sex.  Taking 2 BCs doesn't have the same effect as plan b so just go to planned parenthood and get what you really need.  And take a sex ed class for goodness sake.|`|TSxbN0Asaa	I cant believe women like you are even able to get pregnant. This makes me sad. And the women before was right!!! You should be very ashamed of yourself. How irresponsible.|`|vZwJyqc6aa	Shame on you! I sure hope you are not pregnant, you will just kill this one too because it's an inconvenience. What a loser....I can't believe people like you exist.
S7vNqiOpaa	Some women don't get positive urine tests until they are 5-6 weeks pregnant. But that's kinda uncommon.

It is just not their field.<br>  <br>  There are millions of healthy vegetarians in the world. Heaven knows what your doctor fantasizes that beef might offer over a bowl of beans and cheese, but. <br>  <br>  Googling "vegetarian children" (or "vegetarian toddler" or "baby") will get you loads of advice on how to manage a healthy diet for him with no meat. Mostly, step up the protein and iron from other sources. If he is eating plenty of milk and eggs B12 is not a worry.<br>  <br>  If the aim is simply to get more fat into his diet -- butter and cream and parmesan makes a fantastic pasta sauce.|`|AA11286455	I think that the posters above have some very good ideas to offer.  <br>  <br>  Consider that your child may, quite naturally and honestly, not like meat and simply be a vegetarian even though they don't really know what that is or means.  <br>  <br>  I've seen kids like that and I've made deals:  Take two bites of meat, leave the rest and eat the veggies.  <br>  <br>  Consider having him take a multivitamin, as vegetarians often need a supplement to replace certain nutrients (B12, I think)in meat that they are not getting.  <br>  <br>  If you see that the kid is actually losing weight or does not seem as active and lively as others his age, can't keep up with others, then you need to get the tests done and figure out a plan from there.  <br>  <br>  This doctor is, basically, on the right tract, just don't like his attitude or ultimatum style.  I'd get a new pediatrician, seeking one with experience caring for vegetarian families.|`|TJezsCkHaa	Get him lunch-ables!<br>  That's all the meat that my little one would eat.He is 2 years and 6 months and he weights 28 pounds.His doc says he is just fine.<br>  Try meatballs,or get ground beef and lay it flat in a pan (let it be little thick though and cook it;either in the oven or on the stove,then get those shapes(the ones we use to create the home-made cake from) and cut the meat with it.|`|PLgNsOF9aa	My 23 month old little boy doesnt want to eat much meat either.

Also try feeding him graham crackers and whole milk that will add the calories and weight. <br>  Hope this helps!|`|J5TbYvVZaa	My son wouldn't eat meat until just recently and he's 2.5. I couldn't figure out why but knew it was time to get creative. I started to buy chicken nuggets as shapes...dinosaurs and rings.

Good luck!|`|XaGw9B8Gaa	My daughter won't eat it either....they don't really need to eat meat.

ArDBlPKYaa	Wow, I'm impressed that you've even had sex enough to wonder, so soon after giving birth!!  LOL <br>  <br>  A big factor is, are you breastfeeding?  If so, it's not impossible, but very very unlikely that you'd be pregnant again so soon.  It's still unlikely if you're formula feeding - it's pretty soon after giving birth to be pregnant again!  How long ago did your post-partum bleeding stop?  Because it's even more likely that you'd get pregnant while that's still going on.|`|DTUOvJm0aa	my sister didn't get her period until my niece was 7 months old. might take more time for your body to get back into the swing of things.|`|WmKjeUELaa	It sounds like your body isn't back on track yet after having your baby.

Usually with induced labor they like to get the baby out sooner then twenty four hours though.

jG8b3Mz0aa	Honestly you shouldn't take any. I took some when I was pregnant with my daughter and it made her end up having a BM inside. When she was born the doctors took her immediately so they could suction out her mouth and make sure she didn't inhale any of the poop in. I didn't get to see my daughter for almost 2 hours because she was in the NICU, they were watching to make sure her breathing was fine and stable. I know that is something you wouldn't want to put your baby through. You are already at 40 weeks, what harm can a couple more days do for you? Take it easy sweetie and try to relax, your little one will come when she is ready.|`|5yAsj29Vaa	None... your baby will come when your baby is ready.

aJLx0nhNaa	You had your baby!  Congrats!  Is your pelvic pain any better?<br>  <br>  Anyway, my son had jaundice.  My experience is that a)I was pressured to supplement and did and that had dire effects on breastfeeding and b) after we brought him home we needed to take him back for bilirubin light treatments and leave him overnight.  So, all in all, not a very good experience.  Probably the single most stressful thing about my delivery.  However, he was pre term, and I think that affected how aggressive they were.|`|lTeXIjpOaa	jaundice is a build up of bilirubin, something that is produced by an organ, kidney or liver, i forget which, my son had slight jaundice when he was born, they said the way to get rid of the bilirubin is when he poops his body is getting rid of it, i was not producing enough breastmilk so he was not eating quite what he needed to, so we supplemented with formula when we needed to so that he would poop more, he had to gave blood tested a few times and got over it in a week and a half|`|jHmF9Ak1aa	When babies are born they have an abundance of red blood cells. Those blood cells die and have to be filtered by the liver. Usually the liver isn't developed enough to filter all of those blood cells. The cells get backed up and turn the skin and eyes that yellow color. My son had to do phototherapy. The light helps break down the cells. A bili-light was brought to my house and my son had to stay in it all day and all night. He came out for feedings and diaper changes. The pediatrician asked me to stop breastfeeding and give him formula. My son never wanted the breast again.|`|YLXpwqceaa	My daughter was born premature, and was up in the 90% range.  She was in NICU so she went under the bilirubin lights for a couple of days.  She looked like a carrot! The only other thing they can do is to supplement with formula because the only way to get rid of jaundice is through the stools, and if you're milk isn't fully in, then it will stay longer than it should.<br>  <br>  It's a problem dealing with the liver.<br>  <br>  Supplementing is a good thing at this point.|`|PIeSyhfkaa	In the country I come from they never made such a big deal out of jaundice, nearly every newborn has it. I had a baby three weeks ago and they were so pushy about the bilirubin test, it came back really low. The best thing is to have the baby in the sun as much as possible if you have south facing windows, or outside if you live in the south.|`|nTgNw43gaa	my mother said that i had it and its all about the liver not working.  most of the time they keep the baby in an incubator and tell you to put your baby in the sun a lot.  most of the time it clears up and is a normal problem that babies have.  while it is frustrating and scarey, i hope that your baby doesnt have to live with it.
vm8HtVUYaa	Well, a couple weeks ago my 19 month old had a fever of 104.8o which got him his first trip to the ER (at 2am!)<br>  Turned out to be RSV and a mild ear infection.<br>  He was given an antibiotic and frequent doses of Tylenol & Motrin and after a couple days he was back to perfect =]<br>  <br>  The only thing was his appetite was gone. We ended up giving him deluded Next Step Formula (we added an extra 2-3 oz. of water to every bottle just to get the liquids in).<br>  He wasn't eating much (or drinking much) and the Doctor said the liquids was way more important than the foods, so we would give him 6 oz. of water and 2 scoops formula instead of the normal amount (6oz. water and 3 scoops formula).<br>  We kept doing that to make sure he was having wet diapers (they said that having a fever will make the baby urinate more, which can quickly dehydrate them).<br>  <br>  He continued having wet diapers and after about 3 days he started getting his appetite back. <br>  <br>  The only other thing I can recommend to get his fever down is to give him a cool bath (but not too cold, since he has a fever, because with his body temperature being raised it will make the water feel even colder to him) and I would periodically take a cool wash cloth and dab his forehead (don't leave the wash cloth on his head, just dab him enough to cool his head).<br>  Also, give him Infant Tylenol and Infant Motrin (alternating between the two). Giving him Tylenol and then Motrin every 3 hours. (just make sure there is a 6 hour span between two doses of Tylenol and two doses of Motrin. You can give him Tylenol and then Motrin 3 hours apart, but you cannot give him two doses of Tylenol or two doses of Motrin in less than a 6 hour period.)<br>  <br>  Good luck! Hope the little guy feels better soon! =]<br>  <br>  PS-<br>  If his cough gets worse or you can't seem to get the temperature down, make sure to take Noah to the Doctor.<br>  My son started out with a runny nose (very mild runny nose) and a slight cough with the fever, then after a couple days it turned into congestion and the temp. got up to 104.8o and turned out to be RSV. <br>  RSV is very dangerous if it goes untreated (it can quickly turn into pneumonia if it's not monitored). Just make sure to monitor his fever and make sure it doesn't get too high too fast. Also make sure to watch for congestion. My son went from having a dry cough to really bad congestion within 2 days. I thought it was just a cough (because his nose was barely running) and it turned into really bad congestion really quick. He ended up having to get a nebulizer because his oxygen levels were so low.<br>  Just make sure to keep a close eye on him, RSV is spreading quickly where I live.|`|GR07LyyTaa	oh no sounds just like my daughter but she doesn't have a temp yet... my dr told me that if she gets over 101 that you need to take to the dr if they're open or the er if they're not open.. my daughter sleeps in just a diaper if she has a temp.. i hope your little one gets better and hopes mine doesn't get what he's got but the way it looks she's on that track.|`|9X09kM4oaa	a cool mist humidifier and try to wipe his face with a cold cloth every hour. keep an eye out on him, if he is still running a temperature by saturday mornin at 5 am take him to the er, you do not want it to be to late.|`|Mr6U1TiHaa	if you already gave him tylen there is nothing you can do..if you see no improvement in couple of hours take him to the Er...also put a little hat on him or something, and make his formula warm.. hope he gets well soon|`|46tTmMT7aa	Have you tried a bath? Cool wash cloth? Alternate tylenol and motrin?<br>  There really isn't much more that you can do except keep giving tylenol and keep up with the liquids.|`|1k6UUC8qaa	let me say Noah is a beautiful baby.  It sounds like hes got himself a nasty cold.  To bring down a high fever you can also put him in a normal temperature water then slowly make it cooler just enough so that the water is cold not warm not too cold if you make it too cold its not good or cold very fast.   Fever is just the body fighting infection, if there is no fever the immune system is not doing its job, we won't get any better. so just watch it so that it doesn't go any higher and give him that tylenol as directed and he should be fine. If its a stubborn fever children's Motrin or advil usually bring fever down faster and keeps it down longer.  Call your pediatrician or E.R. again if he gets any worst.  A cool Humidifier isa very good  decongestant and will help him breath easier.  I think this is just one of many colds Noah will conquer. Good Luck I'll pray for Noah tonight. i don't know how cold it is where you are but maybe if its warm inside the house loose the socks.|`|AA11795652	Our sons were born pretty close in time and my son is 10 months also, had a fever of 101 consistently two days ago, and now has a runny nose.  I kept giving Tylenol every 4 hours, I still breastfeed, so I let my son nurse as often as he wanted, gave him water with just a tiny bit of juice and kept offering that to him, and that worked.  I also usually try a cooling bath too.  I didn't call the doctor this time, but before when I did, his pediatrician said that a fever is a good sign that your baby's body is fighting off something and as long as he's sleeping, eating okay, and doesn't seem too irritable, then he's okay.  If you have Motrin, I've heard to alternate Tylenol and Motrin every 4 hours which is supposed to bring down the temp.  As for the runny nose, the humidifier always helps my son.  I know you are a smart mommy and probably know all this but I'm sure you're just like most of us moms who like to know that you're doing everything you possible can.  Take care and I'll say a prayer for Noah!<br>  <br>  I've always paid attention to your questions and love seeing the pics of Noah.|`|rdpZrBc9aa	Been there, done that, washed the t-shirt--and the blankets, and the baby, and the teddy bear, and Mom's and Dad's pajamas. . . <br>  <br>  Give him a lukewarm, not cold, bath.  Alternate Tylenol and Motrin/Advil (store brand is fine) every three hours.  Have him sleep in his car seat for tonight so his sinuses can drain some, or put a small pillow UNDER his mattress at one end to keep his head up a little..  Use saline nose spray or drops to loosen up the gunk, and use a nose-blower (I never can remember the official name for that, but you know what I mean) to gently clear out what you can.  Put some Vaporub on his feet.  Back off on the breast or formula because it encourages mucus production.  Go with Pedialyte, Gatorade, diluted apple or pear juice, and water.<br>  <br>  There are gel patches available that will stick to his forehead and stay cool for several hours.  They don't have any kind of medicine in them so it doesn't matter what you're giving him, they won't interact with anything.  The kind we have is called Be Kool patches and you get them at Wal-Mart.  There are other brands, and I've even seen them at the dollar store.  Those work, too.  You can cut them in half if they're too big.  We've used them at our house for everybody from infants with ear infections to 50-year-olds with the flu!  <br>  <br>  Be careful when you hold him--it's our experience that babies ALWAYS throw up when they're sick, no matter what they've got, and he's not old enough to warn you!  You might be lucky, but if he does, stuff gets clean better if you throw it in the washer and use the second rinse cycle before you do the regular wash cycle.  Also, if you can find Absorb-A-Mess or similar stuff anywhere, you just sprinkle it on the vomit and vacuum a few minutes later.  It's good for carpet and such.  Unfortunately, Wal-Mart doesn't carry that!<br>  <br>  AHA!  I just remembered it's a nasal aspirator!<br>  <br>  Last thought--I don't know what time it is where you are, but most big cities these days have an after-hours clinic and some are specifically pediatric clinics.  They're usually open until at least 10, and on the weekends, too.  They're faster and cheaper than the emergency room.  My daughter loves the one we use because they have satellite TV in every room.<br>  <br>  Good luck!  You'll all survive.  Remember Mom and Dad need sleep, too.|`|ab5bb53a6a149b3a198f0faa854d477daa	Don't take any chances.

Good Luck....|`|uLdeIhHqaa	Something I always do when my Daughter runs a High-Temp, I let her Have licks of Popcicles and she loves them!

Hope this helps!|`|tQVBDx5Paa	Motrin works better for high fevers than Tylenol....otherwise your doing all the right things.  The fever will run its course and he will be fine.  No emergent situation unless it goes to 104 or so.|`|5EFc1QYbaa	Our pediatrician recommends alternating between Infant Tylenol and Infant Motrin every 4 hours to really get on top of a fever (ex. give him Tylenol then in 4 hours Motrin, then in 4 hours Tylenol, etc.).  Elevating the head of his mattress a little bit (stick a book or a small blanket under it) and a warm mist humidifier will help with the congestion too.<br>  <br>  You can also give him a warm bath.  I find when my boys don't feel well, no matter what they still enjoy a bath (it helps with the fever too!).  Just make sure he doesn't get cold.<br>  <br>  Hope your little guy is feeling better soon!|`|5q7uPqVmaa	I think you're doing all you can but he's a little guy to have such a high fever all day.  You're doing a great job so far and keep it up but I'd definately keep an eye on it and would definately head to the doctor in the morning.  Has he been able to keep any liquids down?  My daughter is older but got an awful virus last year that started with a similiar 101/102 degree fever but she stopped drinking any liquids because she was sleeping so much.  After a while, I couldn't even get her to take any Tylenol to keep the fever down so the fever shot up to 104.6 by the time I got to the ER.  She ended up being okay because they forcefed her tylenol but we spent a long night in the ER and she ended up needing IV fluids because she was so dehydrated.   In the end, I think you're doing all you can but take him to the ER if he seems worse or you can't keep him drinking liquids.  Try Freezie pops if you can---a little flavor to the cool ice seems to make it easier.|`|AOvtRBU9aa	Peyton has been running a temp since Tuesday. It even went as high as 104. We gave her a warm bath, set our alarm to wake us up every four hours to give her tylenol, stripped her down to a onsie and thin PJ pants, and it her temp finally went back to normal today. Our Dr told me to nurse her a lot so I've been nursing her around the clock but if you don't BF he said to give pedialyte. We got her baby vicks vaporub and ran the humidfier in our room. Peyton slept a lot also during the day but she seem to get worse at night. She wakes up like almost every hour. She can't breathe and is snoring. It's so hard for babies that age when they are sick. Hope your little one gets better soon.|`|X4ZBrRD7aa	Always keep in mind that the temp will be a few degrees higher when taken rectally and at night.  I just went through this with Juliace last week.  As long as he's acting okay(aside from sleeping extra cuz everyone sleeps more when they don't feel good) the doctors say they are fine.  You can give him a cool/warm bath if his temp gets to 103ish, other than that just keep giving him Tylenol or Motrin every 4-6hours.  I found that the walmart brand of Infants Motrin (Equate Ibuprofin) works better than Tylenol when trying to bring down a temp.  Good luck and hopefully this helps.|`|7rCeCVl2aa	Cool wash clothes on the back of the neck work well. Other than that you are doing mommy duty very well.|`|h59Bc4wfaa	Okay, I know this is going to sound REALLY strange, but my best friend's grandmother, who is like 147 years old (not really, but she's pretty old) told me to put Vick's on the bottom of my little man's feet. I was like: "oh yeah, riiiiight, Vick's on the bottoms of his feet. Why didn't I think of that before?" =\<br>  <br>  But when all else failed, I did it. AND IT WORKED! I'm not sure why, and I really don't care, lol. All I know is that it did the trick.|`|t0mb150gaa	Bathing him in luke warm water helps lower the temperature..and make sure you are giving him tylenol at the recommended intervals. Also have him drink lots of fluids as they already recommended. You can also try warm ginger ale..he may be too young for this so check that with the doctor before giving it to him. Dress him lightly for bed or just in a diaper and don't bundle him up in blankets. Good luck and hope his temperature breaks soon!|`|JP2h62qiaa	I like to put hunter in a really cool bath. Not like cold, but not to warm either.  It helps to break his fevers. I give him a quick soak in some cool water and then put him in a onsie.  You seem to be doing all that you can. Hopefully that will help him though, the bath. Good luck I Hope he feels better soon.|`|EyKJ737daa	Sweetie, there are a few things you need to remember with fevers.  Number one, it's our body's natural way of fighting off any sort of foreign object in the body, usually a nasty bug.  With the body's temp going up, it kills the germs.  Secondly you need to remember that as long as your son's temperature doesn't rise too fast or drop too fast then he is not at risk of febrile convulsions.  Unless there is a family history of them, then he will be fine.  You can give him warm baths but not cool or tepid as this will cool his core body temp too fast.  Warm baths are just fine.  If he is generally happy and not too worried about the high temps then try and avoid treating it with paracetamol as it will give his body a chance to fight it rather than masking it and not killing whatever is making it go up in the first place.  If however he is miserable, then most certainly treat it!  Definitely let him sleep when and as much as he wants too as that recuperation is fantastic.  You yourself know that when your sick, all you want to do is sleep.  Again it's your body's way of recovery.  Definitely keep his fluids up to him. As he is 10 months old, give him water at room temperature.  Cold water cannot be absorbed into the body until it reaches room temperature.  Keep offering him foods, generally finger foods and this will also help you gauge how he is going too and if he is improving.  As you mentioned, he has a runny nose, I would certainly make an appointment to see your doctor when you are able too as runny noses and high fevers can lead to ear infections and can come on very quickly.  A quick once over by the GP will be good for him and put your mind at ease too so definitely organise that as soon as you can.  At night though when you put him down to sleep, give him a dose of baby ibuprofen as that will act very fast and keep his temp down longer during the night to aid recovery.  My youngest 16mo, just got over a 40 degree temp last week.  Hers happened to be a viral infection combined with teething.  Your son could also be teething too, so take that into account too if you find he's still not interested in food or he could just have a sore throat.  Poor little mite though, give him lots of cuddles too, very important.  Get yourself some vicks baby balsam to rub on his chest, back and feet and if you only have or can only get adult vicks, just rub on his clothes under his chin so the vapours go up into his nose and helps keep the passages clear.  Also try saline drops up his nose every nappy change and every time he is laying on his back as that will help keep the runny nose loose so it doesn't block up and will help it to all flush out especially if he sneezes, be ready with a tissue really quickly then but it will help him immensely.  Good luck sweetie, I hope all this info helps you and your poor little son, but he'll get better soon.  thankfully little ones generally aren't sick for long and it does help build up their immune system.|`|PFO1jxZGaa	I would not run him to er yet unless the fever spikes up. Just keep an eye on him like you were told. You can give him a luke warm bath. ( not cool) , it should not feel warm to your hand nor cool. He might not like it but just few minutes will help bring the temp. down. It always worked for my kids. ( remember, not cool, just lukewarm) <br>  Also if he stops drinking or peeing you should be concerned because small babies get dehydrated really fast. He should pee at least 4 times a day. You can rub some vicks babyrub on his chest ( helps wih congestion) and also on the bottom of his feet ( I dont know why it works, but it does) <br>  Now dont wake him up for the bath, but once he is up I would put him in for a minute. If you have a humidifier, put it in his room too. <br>  Good luck and I hope he feels better soon
OgzHcNMsaa	Personally I like the sleepers with feet...but I  also have the nighties with the elastic bottoms. Those seem to work well too. At babies r us they sell 2 piece pyjamas so that's another option|`|pXSKSS3daa	I never asked my son if he likes them, guess I should. :P<br>  <br>  Lol, he doesn't seem to mind them and they are nice for keeping his feet toasty. They are especially nice for newborns because you don't have to worry about dealing with socks or anything like that. My son was born in April(last year) and wore a lot of light weight sleepers(kind of like the ones they sell in the Gerber 5 pack) and he was fine weather wise. I wouldn't put your baby in anything heavier than that, though, so avoid fleece sleepers.<br>  <br>  They do make regular PJs(just bottoms and tops) but I'm not sure if they make them in newborn size. Sleepers are usually the ones with feet in them.|`|aJLx0nhNaa	In the summer, my son was a newborn and we did not put him in sleepers.  We swaddled him, sometimes in a onesie, sometimes in just a diaper depending on the heat.<br>  <br>  Now that he's older and it's winter we always put him down in sleepers with feet.  We have a few sleepers without feet but they are pointless because if we put socks on him he always gets them off.  And then his feet get cold.  But sleepers without feet are certainly available.<br>  <br>  They do get too small.  I have put him in a few and then realized that they were too small when he couldn't put his legs down!|`|OrKpKxkHaa	I think they can get hot that is why I buy the cotton ones not the fleece ones, even in the winter. There are pajamas out there that are a onesie with pants (most baby clothes and pajamas are interchangeable really) and you could put socks on but most babies kick them off. I dont think they are too warm in summer since then we have the airconditioner on. If you dont, I would just put the baby to bed in a onesie. My daugter doesnt seem to mind the feet and like I said, its easier for me because I dont have to keep replacing socks. Maybe you just have long legs ; ) Good luck!|`|SaRDq9iLaa	I did the same thing as April Mommy.  My daughter was born in August.  I would put her in a onesie and either swaddle her with a receiving blanket or put her in a sleep sack.  I started using the sleep 'n' plays when it got colder out.  She didn't mind either one.  She actually loves to hold the bunny ears or bear ears on the feet of her sleep 'n' plays.  Good luck and Congrats!|`|b978f631fc787a963337206aa3833370aa	When they're that young, they'll wear whatever you put on them. LOL <br>  <br>  The cotton ones are nice for cooler nights and then you might not need a blanket. We have several fleece ones (plus my daughter's room gets cold at night) and she loves them. She's 2 1/2 - but will always snuggle and get cozy and say "I love jammies!" when she has them on. LOL But I do buy new ones when they get too short. Although the ones she has on now are getting too small and she doesn't even seem to notice.|`|9X09kM4oaa	Taylor was born in November and it was already cold so we automatically got the sleepers with the footsies :) she didn't mind them at all. You can still get sleepers for your little one but just make sure since it will be in the summer make sure it is a more light weight fabric that breathes easily.|`|5wmrZEQ9aa	I had my baby mid April, and we mostly had her in a onsie, and swaddled her at night.  We also used the sleep sacks.  We started putting her in footie pjs in September, when it got cooler.|`|gJrHBtp1aa	I don't think babies really care. My son will sleep in anything.<br>  When he was younger he always slept in the sleepers with feet. Now that he's 12 months he's wearing real pj's now.<br>  He hasn't really noticed a difference at all.|`|rdpZrBc9aa	Not unless your house is warm at night.  We can't sleep unless it's cool, so our baby definitely needs his feet covered.  They can't take off the sleeper feet like they can socks!
7rCeCVl2aa	Either your mattress is too small or you didn't put your crib together right. There shouldn't be a gap at all.<br>  <br>  As for bumpers you can safely use a breathable mesh bumper found at babies'r'us for about $30.00|`|gx4s68s8aa	You can get mesh bumpers for the spaces in-between the spindles<br>  like this one<br>  <a href="http://www.toysrus.com/product/index.jsp?productId=2266849" rel="nofollow">http://www.toysrus.com/product/index.jsp...</a><br>  <br>  They have them at other stores as well.<br>  <br>  Not sure what you need to do about the space between the mattress and crib.  My crib mattress fits very snug.  Is your crib a hand-me down or something?  Maybe that is the problem.|`|F6lZHRkVaa	Your mattress should definitely be tight against the sides of the crib. If you can't get a new mattress or crib right now though, go ahead and tuck the bumper down around the sides. You don't want any of the bumper to be jutting up over the side of the mattress.<br>  <br>  But do look into getting a different crib and mattress set. There shouldn't be enough of a gap between mattress and crib that a baby could fall in between there. Good luck!|`|AA10624857	Crib mattresses do come in various sizes.  Your best bet is to take the measurements inside your crib and buy one that fits snuggly.|`|IFDfpbFJaa	There shouldn't be a space. The bumper doesn't go down into anything it sits along the mattress so the gab would be there anyway. <br>  Sorry.|`|c4e0f4398cbb2577d252628c76d0781baa	You can get a mesh bumper.  They sell them at Babies R US.  That is what we have and I LOVE it.  There are no strings and it's mesh so the baby cannot suffocate or strangle themselves.  The one I have does not go over the top of the crib rail, but you can find the kind that do online.  Here is the one I have:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.toysrus.com/product/index.jsp?productId=2266849" rel="nofollow">http://www.toysrus.com/product/index.jsp...</a><br>  <br>  I know that doesn't solve your problem, but it solves the problem of the baby getting one of his limbs stuck in between one of the slats.  Are your crib and mattress both new?  If one is older, maybe that could be the problem?  I have no idea, just a suggestion.........|`|o1StMQeyaa	i think it is possible to get crib mattresses in different sizes and it is ESSENTIAL that the mattress you use fits the crib snugly. If your crib is very old, it may not be possible to find a mattress that fits. If this is the case, you need to buy a new crib!<br>  Shoving crib bumpers, towels, blankets or anything else down the sides of a crib to block gaps is extremely unsafe.<br>  Please read the SIDS foundation guildelines so that you can minimise the risk of SIDS and protect your baby:<br>  <a href="http://www.sidsandkids.org/safe_sleeping.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.sidsandkids.org/safe_sleeping...</a>|`|KNxs4PrZaa	thats definatly a problem, is your crib old?  most cribs and mattresses come in standard sizes these days.  you may have to buy a new crib that meets safety standard, check out the cribs and mattresses at your local baby store for reference to see how they fit so you can see what it needs to look like.  as for a bumper look into "breathable bumpers" they are made out of a mesh material that allows air to flow through it so the baby is safe but there is a barrier between their arms and legs and the spindals.|`|jkDbDjcRaa	There shouldn't be space in between.<br>  <br>  If there is though, I think you should fill the gaps like you said.<br>  <br>  I didn't use bumpers...in canada they've advised against it for years...but there was no space between the matress and the bars, so I'm not sure what you should do about that.|`|ME62Mtv4aa	I use the bumpers but not for any particular reason(other than protecting arms and legs) but I also use a sleep positioner that has sides on it so baby doesn't roll around the crib as much and their head is on an incline.|`|DSZTruuqaa	Sorry to say that the only safe thing to do is get a bigger mattress or a smaller crib.  It will cost, but the it is worth it!|`|rdpZrBc9aa	You get a bigger mattress, one that fits your crib.|`|YLXpwqceaa	Bumpers are safe as long as they are not too plush.  You just don't want your baby to end up with their nose and mouth to get right up against it and not be able to breathe.<br>  <br>  You can always use a sleep positioner, they are fairly inexpensive and did wonders for my little one!<br>  <br>  Good Luck!|`|dpig5odPaa	They have mesh bumpers now. You can get them at babies r us. It keeps the baby from getting their leg or arm caught between the bars. The mesh bumpers come in two peices that velcro around the corner bars. One goes around the main part of the crib and the other goes around the front section so that if you have a crib you can lower in the front it can still be lowered. There shouldn't be gaps between the mattress and the crib. Some cribs are different sizes. There is a standard crib mattress, then there is a portable crib mattress, and then there is a standard crib mattress for a convertable crib. The size from smallest to largest is porta crib, standard, and the largest is convertable crib. A convertable crib is the kind that goes from a crib to a toddler bed and sometimes to a twin head board and foot board. With any crib you should not have gaps, you should have to practically shove the mattress into the crib. Hope this helps. If I were you I would get a new mattress.

LDYAGJCxaa	I think every mother at some time or another feels as though she's a bad mother.  Generally, I don't.  But when the kids are acting up terribly and the house is a disaster (even though I cleaned it only an hour ago) and I burned the supper....I just want to scream and wonder why I ever wanted children.  After everything's calmed down I feel pretty guilty for those thoughts.  I end up thinking that any decent mother would never feel that way no matter what the situation.  But the truth is, we do sometimes.  You'll find other times you think you're a bad m other because you're not playing with your children enough...even though you are.  Or you'll think you're a bad mother because you can't keep the house clean.  The simple fact is...when you have children, it never stays tidy.  We just have to remind oursleves that we're not super mommies.  Mothers tend to be very hard on themselves.  <br>  <br>  My suggestion to you is to tell these people that your days of smoking weed and drinking every other weekend are over.  Once you're a mother, you have different priorities.  Does this mean you never go out or that you can't have a couple of drinks?  No.  It simply means you'll be more responsible about it.  <br>  <br>  If you don't have children, then there's nothing wrong with going out drinking a few times a month.  You're only young and free once!  As long as you're the sort of person who knows how to put that style of living behind her (for the most part) then I don't see any problem at all.|`|IDmaxViIaa	well yea but look i am and have 5 girls. HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA|`|LwbwMFX9aa	you need to have a clean system so I would wait before trying. Be clean for one year. Alcohol and drugs can lead to your child having all sorts of problems even if you're not doing it while pregnant, it does effect the mans sperm, even cigarette smoke does.<br>  <br>  you need to practice keeping your partying VERY limited and get used to that stay at home lifestyle for a while<br>  <br>  this has nothing to do with tats or peircings, its about bringing a baby into a party house, which isnt safe<br>  <br>  I always didnt want to be a mom cause I thought I would grow up to be a yeller like my mom which was horrible. As soon as I felt myself starting to go that way, I got help so I dont yell lke she did|`|e4596390515e8d11a71ef13fed732cc9aa	I dont want to come across harsh straight out but as a mom of two young children, it is the parents duty to teach them good moral and ethical skills until adulthood.  Be their role model.  Everyone drinks here and there.  Just as a parent you can get all sh!t faced and take care of a infant/baby.  You may have to cut back a lot or totally.  As far as weed.  There is no question that doing that will not be an option.  Its either quit or dont have a baby.  If that child were to grow up and decide in their adult life to do drugs and the consequences that go with that.  <br>  <br>  As far as worrying.. that worry goes away after you have the moment of having a baby inside of you kicking and growing and thinking every day what he/she will look like.  Then when the time comes that you have the baby, your life will change forever.  It is truly amazing to go through the labor, birth and hearing that first cry.  From that point forward, its your job as a mom to do anything for your child.  No more selfishness or time for you, it's all about the baby.  You mentioned you both know what its like to grow up with alcohol.  Why not make a better example by not showing them that.  Break that chain.<br>  <br>  I have a 2 and 4 yr old and my life has changed.  I havent gone out in a long time and are now a mom that works, comes home reads them books, bath them and do whatever.  I dont stay up late anymore and I am constantly wondering if they will be ok.  <br>  <br>  I'm sure when you do get pregnant your instincts will kick in and you will choose to do what's right and you will do just fine.<br>  <br>  Good Luck|`|f4HsyUfQaa	Ella, from reading your question you sound like you really want to be a wife, and a mom. From reading your profile you say that your 17? You and your fiance want to ttc right away. Personally, I would hold off for just a little while. Enjoy married life, and being together. Being a military wife is the TOUGHEST job in the world (IMHO). ;) I know I enjoy being a wife, mom and a small business owner. <br>  <br>  I just wanted to give you a heads up, that if you smoke weed around your spouse, and the military finds out.. He could get into a lot of trouble. <br>  <br>  I've been a military wife for 8 very happy years. Our wedding sucked. So were having a renewal of vows for ou 10th wedding anniversary. I hope your renewal (if you decide to have one) is a happy one. <br>  <br>  I wish you much joy in your up coming july wedding.|`|F6lZHRkVaa	You'll be a fine parent. I was the same way before I had kids, but it sounds like I probably partied much harder. I would just advise you to seriously enjoy your freedom as much as possible before you get pregnant. <br>  <br>  I never worried once that I'd have a hard time giving up the partying when I had a baby. However, I was very worried that those motherly instincts wouldn't kick in and I'd end up with a baby who screamed at me all day because I didn't know how to change his diaper. But something switches inside you when you see your kid, and all those fears are laid to rest. You'll be a fine mom, don't even worry about it.|`|UYfqzCoMaa	I felt the same way when I found out I was pregnant with my first. My sister was the biggest problem. She actually told me that if I wasn't going to have an abortion then I should consider adoption. I drank but it wasn't even once a month. I never smoked weed a day in my life because my brother was almost killed in a car accident that was cause because the driver of the other car was high. If you feel like you are ready to be a mother then go for it. You sound like you know what's best and you are thinking about your baby. Just be prepared to not drink at all now and it's hard to do it after you have the baby. Just because you drink that does not make you a bad parent or else more than half the world would be bad parents. I have piercings and tattoo's and I know that I am not a bad parent. Good luck and baby dust to you!!

5QLxmPptaa	Oh my goodness! I was almost Isolde, but my dad vetoed it. I love the name though! <br>  <br>  Instead, I was named Susan Sojourner, after Susan B. Anthony and Sojourner Truth. In third grade, I decided I didn't like Susan and started going by my Hebrew name, Shoshana. Four years later I got it legally changed (my parents were supportive). <br>  <br>  Now, my name is Shoshana Sojourner, and I love it! I sometimes have to repeat or explain my name,and I always tell the starbucks people "Shauna" instead of "Shoshana",  but I'm ok with that. I also have a hyphenated last name, so in total my name is 31 letters!|`|Z6NlNRLoaa	Audra isn't heard very often.|`|5FfQkPQ2aa	celia. it's not short for cecelia or anything. my mom got it from a soap opera while she was pregnant.|`|Xi5Jno6haa	When I was a kid I hated my first name Sonya, pronounced like Tonya but with a S that's what I always have to tell people who cannot pronounce it.

Study formulas.|`|rPH05I2jaa	Same I really dislike Algebra but I'm a little higher. I got a C- now it's a B-. Tutors helped me a lot just hang in there i felt as if ALL hope was lost to an dI know if your like me you are trying hard but it's not doing anything for you. The teacher and tutor thing is what I'm doing and it's working just give it time. Work on not making small Computational Errors and ALWAYS ALWAYS check your test twice do every problem twice i got my grade up so much higher because of it. Do your homework all of it no matter how stressing don't half *** it ok? Now tests can always bring you down which is why i don't know how to stress the importance of double checking, no sign errors and such. Hope you can relate and I could help, Good luck!|`|mfBkH3qtaa	Well instead of doing homework by your self, take it to your tutor. There is a girl in my Pre-Algebra class who has a tutor and goes once a week on Friday's. So our teacher let's her turn in the work on Friday's.

ojVl4Gowaa	It's great that your reconnecting with your family!<br>  <br>  Since it's been so long I would suggest eating out at a casual place like Applebee's so it's low pressure and you can just talk about normal catch up topics like your job, friends, relationships, etc. If things seem to be going well and your father seems interested in connecting more you can invite him to your home for dessert. This might be a better time to express deeper emotions and give your father a chance to talk about his feelings about how your relationship was lost. Hopefully, all goes well after that. But the 'serious' talk can be reserved for another time if it's more comfortable and you should just focus on reconnecting and finding out more about your siblings.|`|qouUjd7Raa	first of all just be yourself ' diner is fine but you may feel more comfortable meeting at a coffee house like starbucks or just a casual informal lunch|`|WlU3NFu6aa	find a place to eat. maybe not super noisy so you get to talk, but not too quiet. <br>  congrats. i think its awesome that you will get to reconnect with your family.|`|7rCeCVl2aa	I would go to a restaurant setting. Everyone feels comfortable eating. Plus you are in a non threatening environment which will set an easier tone for everyone.|`|Mr6U1TiHaa	go out to eat..wow you have a good heart..because if my father lost contact with me for 13 years.....i would'nt even look at him, but its good that youre going to get  a chance to reconnect with your siblings....go eat then go watch a movie together, you know? good luck and tell us all about it|`|jkDbDjcRaa	I would go out to eat, because then you will have a lot of opportunity to talk. :)|`|MaDN7knJaa	Go out to eat<br>  <br>  Happy Eatting!!|`|BySnX7Gvaa	I would go out to eat....but make them pay lol
3GHXk05saa	Lead by example, and if she asks for advice give it.<br>  Be a mentor. Offer to help her in areas where she needs improvement. Share a meal with her and the kids, teach her how to cook and budget if she needs it. Offer to watch her kids so she can have some quiet time. If she has a problem let her talk it out on her own first. Lead her to the answer but don't do it all for her.<br>  Set limits. Don't let her take advantage or make your life miserable.<br>  DO NOT get in between her and the ex if he comes back. Call 911, but if he hurt her, he'll hurt you. Don't give her your keys or let her unsupervised in your house and don't lend her more than a few dollars at a time. Better to buy groceries than give cash.|`|jCy0J2ueaa	i think the third answer says it all|`|Yn6pM2Xyaa	be her cheerleader not her doormat.  Offer advice, people she can talk to, organizations to help her.  Basically shorten the legwork she's going to need to do to get her life back in order but don't do everything for her and don't take on burdens yourself.  That is very awesome you want to help her out just don't get taken advantage of.  I used to do it and it kills you and to show for it I had friends who DUMPED me because they didn't like it when I started to move on in life and get a bit of a backbone.  Worst part is after not seeing one particular offender for over 10 years I just found out she moved in to a house like 4 streets over.  I have 'seen' her a few times in the area, not sure if she has seen me but I hate it! and I would hate for that to happen to you.|`|AA12221392	I am sure you will be able to provide her with a lot of encouragement. <br>  Everyone needs that someday if nothing more than that. <br>  <br>  Just let her know that you are their for her to talk to and that you may have been in her shoes and look you know it is hard and not a easy road but look it can be done.. :)|`|EMKuBql8aa	So you can help, but not get super close (don't want to get mixed up in what sounds like drama) cook her a nice roast once a week, like every Sun. or something, she will appreciate the gesture and it'll take her mind off of one meal at least.
86oPkfzOaa	I guess if Harry and Ginny had another kid it would be a girl, since they already have 2 boys. I think they might name her after someone else in their lives but I can't think of anybody else. Maybe Tonks? Idk, Ron and Hermione most likely didn't name their kids after anyone, but their kids names are Rose and Hugo, which start with the same letters as theirs do. But, since there are only two parents, I don't know what else to think! Maybe after their middle names, Jean and Bilius? Incidentally, Harry's kids' full names are Albus Severus, James Sirius, and Lily Luna.|`|CMuL7XpKaa	Ginny & Harry- I think they have a girl Ginger Harriet<br>  <br>  OTHER<br>  Boy: Evan Fred (for Lily EVANs & Ginny's brother) George Vernon  (for Ginny's brother & Harry's uncle)<br>  <br>  Girl: Virginia Ronnie (for Ginny & Ron) OR/AND Ginger Harriet (for Ginny & Harry)<br>  --------------------------------------...<br>  Ron & Hermione- I  think they have boy/girl twins<br>  <br>  OTHER<br>  Boys:<br>  Girls: Veronica|`|AXHz5tmiaa	I think if Harry and Ginny had another, they'd name it after Remus or Sirius. They were both really important to Harry. <br>  <br>  If Ron and Hermione had another, hmm. Since George aleady named his son Fred..... well. I think it would have an H and an R in it - like the other names. Like, Harriet. Or possibly something after someone of the family. Like Ron's middle name. <br>  I originally thought twins - but identical twins are complete chance. <br>  But for the sake of names, they'd have twins. Harriet and Roland. Something off, and R and H - but alternating. To go with Hugo and Rose. <br>  <br>  Gosh. I've thougt too much about this.|`|UrZ8SFpqaa	Well, Harry and Ginny have James, Albus, and Lily...they were named after people who died (even their middle names are after people who died...except for Lily's because I'm not sure if Luna actually died or not). I would have to say Remus Lupin for a boy? Not too sure for a girl though...<br>  <br>  Ron and Hermione didn't name their kids after anyone...at least I don't think so.|`|lnZjIhDCaa	Ginny and Harry would have a girl name Ima Wetard|`|u7UnUZXnaa	they already have kids together?<br>  since when?|`|C0Lby79Iaa	When I read the last one, I had a sort of menatl blank and thought Dumbledore came back, because of how it says "Ginny kissed Albus",and I'm like WHAT?<br>  <br>  Then I realised. <br>  <br>  Harry & Ginny: Girl -  Molly Tonks, Boy - Remus Hedwig LOL<br>  Ron & Hermione: Girl - Molly Jean?, Boy - Victor Bilius|`|QAeyvDdwaa	Harry's kid would either be named DUDLEY VERNON or PETUNIA MARGE!<br>  <br>  Ron and Hermione's kid would be DOBBY CEDRIC or BATHILDA HEDWIG!
SnQvsOPwaa	Kids will bond very quickly to one they believe they can trust.|`|O1m2PaMjaa	Usually the step-father can give things to children that a biological father can't. If bad things have happened with the relationship between the child and the biological father- it is not easily forgotten, or especially forgiven. With a step father, a child has more leeway and can get what they want. Also many step parents are viewed more as friends rather than parental figures; hence the reason many children call some of their parents by their first names.|`|J4hOL3oLaa	My dad and I were very close when I was a kid. I was raped when I was 15 and my dad blamed me. He told me he hated me and wanted me to die and spit on me a lot when I was younger. I am 24 now and it still hurts so bad. There is many nights I wish my mom would have left him. I crave a father figure so bad. <br>  <br>  Some biological fathers don't see there kids as often as a step father would if the mom had custody, so naturally the bond would be closer.
T3BXC8qXaa	I think that should be up to her. My 18 year old niece wanted to watch (she was just starting nursing school) my last childbirth.  She was thrilled, amazed and yes, it's also good birth control! lol|`|EtCRnDJMaa	I think if she wants to then do it.  If she doesn't want to be right there front and center she doesn't have to be.  She can be by your side and not see anything too.  You have to be front and center in front of all the action to see anything anyway.  She doesn't have to be looking right Between your legs, she can be behind you at your side.  If she doesn't like it she can leave and sit in the waiting room or just hold your hand.<br>  <br>  I think it would be great for her!|`|1ezYfkX7aa	I would ask her if she wanted to be in the room and leave it up to her. My mom had a baby when i was almost 21years old and i was there with her lol|`|853cc6887209cde2bce97ac152f218d0aa	im 14 and i dont think i would want to be in the delivery room<br>  i would probably faint or throw up<br>  <br>  lol|`|e8yt5PrGaa	yes i would that would be awesome|`|UYfqzCoMaa	I think it would be a great idea. I was 14 when my nephew was born and my sister let me be in the room when she gave birth. It was the coolest experience. It made me not want to have kids for awhile and I didn't have my first until I was almost 21. The funny thing is that I even had the same ob that she did. He's an amazing doctor. Then when I had my last baby my daughter had just turned 5 and I let her be in the room when her little sister was born. She stayed up by my head the whole time so it wasn't too graphic for her and she loved it. So if you feel that it would benefit her than why not??|`|xyrSl2nSaa	That really depends on her maturity level. If she is mature enough to handle it, i say let her be in there! And i guarantee that image will pop in her mind when she wants to have sex for the first time! If you don't want to have her in there while giving birth you could have her be in charge of things for the new baby, like decorating the room or something to that nature|`|H6GYZqHvaa	Well, I think that it might be a little too much for her. But I would reccomend talking to her about it, and letting her decide.<br>  <br>  Answer my question!<br>  <a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;_ylt=ApWkIBTBROqe8KPREC1kQzPsy6IX;_ylv=3?qid=20090220180710AAoTAbF">http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;...</a>|`|2dd5ead8a0ebfd17db4114329eae540caa	I,m not God but I feel like it is not a good idea. She already see what parenting is all about by seeing you take care of the younger three. She has already said she don't want kids.|`|lY2XI8kUaa	maybe you should ask your daughter if she wants to be in the room. but i would let her decorate the nursery for the baby. with help from you and your husband of course.|`|bdWO9wSAaa	I'm 14, and if my mother were having the baby, I'd probably be allowed in, although I'm not sure if I would want to be.<br>  <br>  Screaming babies make me angry.<br>  <br>  Leave it to her.|`|ENYkIOPDaa	You should let her be in the room,<br>  So she'll see if she does have kids what she'll<br>  have to do, and this could help her stick with not having kids|`|Jm6mkvlWaa	Giving birth is a graphic ordeal, but I don't find it inappropriate for your 14 daughter to be in the room. Just make sure that you ask her opinion of it and don't force her to. She might find it cool and interesting, or gross and not want to be a part of it.  And as for using it as a scare tactic-- I think it could definitely work. So many teens think that one day they can just wake up with a baby "to love them" and that everything will be rainbows and butterflies. But it doesn't sound like that is real problem here anyway.<br>  <br>  If she doesn't want to be in the room, you can let her help do things for the baby but not things that make her feel like its another kid to have to watch. Like let her decorate the nursery(as mentioned above), or go shopping for baby stuff with you.  <br>  <br>  Keep in mind that if she is feeling overlooked, involving her with baby stuff might not be the best idea. Maybe you should just schedule Mommy & Me time and take her out to lunch and to a cute chick flick (before or after the birth.) Let her talk about her life, don't talk about the baby or other kids.<br>  <br>  Hope this helps!!|`|e4596390515e8d11a71ef13fed732cc9aa	For one, she's your daughter and the oldest so why not have her in there.  It will serve as several duties.  Bonding with your oldest to share a special moment with your youngest as well as what you said by letting her see first hand what having a baby entails.  And make her think again when she wants to have sex or unprotected sex.  It is also a very happy experience for someone to witness.  She may have a very special bond with her youngest sibling and feel connected to the family again.|`|6ddNezzSaa	im 14 too. i would want to be there. give her a chance! if she has to close her eyes then...she can! it would make her not want to have kids. i know i dont!|`|SJU7XRfKaa	I'm 14 and if my mom was going to have another baby I'd want to be there in the room with her. It may be a bit graphic so she can cover her eyes at the gruesome parts. :D|`|LwbwMFX9aa	yes, it will help prevent her from wanting to be a mom anytime soon, do natural so it hurts and you scream really loud =)

I ate alot myself.|`|mpGjPV6Xaa	You're fine, just eat at least 3 - 4 meals a day. Make sure you drink 6 - 8 glasses of water, eat fruit and vegetables. Also, get 8 hours of sleep, because staying up late can cause you to loose weight rather than gain it. If you're trying to gain weight, eat right and get lots of sleep, since you can only gain weight in your sleep. But, as of right now , you're healthy.<br>  <br>  Hope I helped !!!<br>  <br>  Joseph D : )

jbjoO4V7aa	I totally agree! Whenever some poor innocent freaking out 14 year old asks if their a slut for making out for the first time they get answers like "what are our youth coming to! I didn't to that until a month ago and i'm in high school!", Its actually sad that people can't put aside that little wall called age and help the person out. They were asking for answers like "yes take it a little slower" or "no your fine". Definitely not telling them their a shame to society.<br>  <br>  Also the questions where pregnant teens ask questions in which other teens answer. One 15 year old tries to say "oh it's going to be ok just tell someone" then some angry 20 something comes along and says "Oh don't listen to that dumb child! She knows nothing!" then goes on to say the same exact thing. <br>  <br>  Adults may be wiser in some ways, but they shouldn't put down teens or children because of it.|`|8cd6d1064a8d6379febc6914e867a26baa	I see this A LOT.<br>  I quit telling my age to people.<br>  I answer many good questions, and people dont treat me like an idiot, cause they dont know how old I am.|`|3fcf101a2615a631d556e32ec980eae0aa	I understand what you are saying and agree that sometimes this does happen.<br>  <br>  I personally know (especially from my experience as a junior high teacher,) that there are many teens that are incredibly intelligent and have many wonderful ideas to contribute.  Especially in a setting like Answers.<br>  <br>  Perhaps one problem is that we adults remember what stupid things we did as teens (because of course you don't remember most of the good you did...the bad choices always stick out!) and we project that on to anyone that is younger than us.  <br>  <br>  You are right though...how can we expect you to make good choices if we have already decided you will make a poor choice...|`|mfBkH3qtaa	I am a teen. And i agree i ask some questions and they say you are irresponsible, or here is the next teen mom of Y!A, or something stupid. It really drives me nuts.

I hate it especially when it occurs in the education system- You know, typical mean teachers who think we're good for nothing idiots? I mean come on, I have met adults who treat me like a human being and I respond to them quite well. To the other adults who treat me like I'm too young to understand anything, I just ignore them or treat them like idiots.<br>  <br>  The golden rule applies here- Do unto others as you will have them do unto you.
qRElKKjXaa	How would whipping her rehabilitate her in any way? It would probably humiliate and emotionally scar her, and make her more likely to lash out. A girl who steals from a church has some emotional problems, and giving her an inhumane punishment like whipping her would be like throwing a match onto spilled gasoline. <br>  <br>  A 17 year old is not a child. She is a young woman, and needs to be treated as such. I would let her make the choice. <br>  <br>  If she'd never been in trouble with the law, I'd get a lawyer to push for a more reasonable punishment such as paying back the money in full plus a fine, doing 1000 hours of community service, seeing a counselor and being put on probation.|`|R47Bj9Q6aa	id rather be whipped as long as it had no long term side effects then go to jail<br>  weird /bad things happen in jail id never want to spend a night there|`|FiUprYsvaa	I think the whipping would be better than things she would endure in prison. <br>  Whipping or being someones bytch?<br>  I think the whipping.

Whipping her is child abuse and YOU will go to jail. No court will approve of whipping. That is protected under an amendment in the constitution. That is cruel and unusual punishment now a days. Anyone that chose whipping hooray for you I gave you a thumbs down =D|`|Oj1xB57Waa	I would actually consider having her goto prison just to scare her, or make her work at the church with no pay. I dont think the whipping would actaully get any sort of message out at all beside pain.|`|drI1vsJdaa	I'd rather go to prison. Whipping would hurt, and is considered abuse so my parents would go to jail too.|`|WnxQRmfLaa	these are both poor consequences. Physical harm (whipping) isn't going to teach her any kind of lesson, it's going to hurt like hell but that's it. The only thing it may teach her is that problems can be solved through violence. Secondly, prison isn't going to teach her anything. She needs to feel the consequence of her action. If it were my choice to make I would make her work for a charity to donate her time and energy as a way to repay what she has taken.
hYRYO5GYaa	hey girl, im getting all those questions too, my husbands in the marines. we decided that its our lives, we can handle it, and we've made it over every bump in the road so far|`|AA10196172	Years ago, before ultrasounds, I could ask women "have you picked names for twins?" Dang technology!<br>  <br>  I think the worst I heard was someone who wrote to a dear-abby type column complaining a co-worker actually(!) said "You're not planning to have a second child? What if the first one dies in an accident?" Never underestimate the capacity of others to be beyond rude!<br>  <br>  So good luck and congrats! There's nothing wrong with two people in a stable loving relationship having as many kids as they want. I think when it comes to "can you afford it?", a child gives more enjoyment that being able to afford the big-screen TV or a fancy car.|`|1jwbQaZTaa	before i got pregnant i used to go out on the weekends and drink with my friends, because i could. i had a friend who ONLY cared about drinking and partying and the first thing she said was "OMG, like, how are you gonna go that long without drinking???" and i was due the day before my birthday and she actually said "I hope she comes on her due date so you can come party on your birthday!!!"

Then when I told them I still had a few months left, they would look surprised and ask if it was twins.

mpGjPV6Xaa	I would say a tooth ache hurts worse because I've had both and the ear ache didn't hurt me as much as the tooth ache did.

The pain on your jawline can radiate to your ears. Take some tylenol and try to sleep. You might want to make a trip to the dentist to make sure the wisdom teeth are coming in straight. They can grow in sideways and damage your back molar causing both teeth to have to be removed if caught too late.|`|mfBkH3qtaa	Not really. Your throat nose and ears are all connected. So when one hurts its not odd for one of the others to hurt. Happens to me all the time. I would take some pain killers or sleep medicine and go to bed. Then when you wake up make an appointment with a Dentist if you haven't already. Most people need there wisdom teeth pulled.|`|QIDhVAjjaa	i don't know, i've heard of people dieing from both i would think the ear ache is worse since it's closer to your brain and if left untreated there is a possibility of going deaf the tooth might only have to get pulled though so i would treat the ear ache first then the tooth ache it isn't really that odd.|`|UHbh9kn2aa	well i had a very bad earache. my eardrum busted and i had to have a tympanoplasty done twice. thats a total of 18 stiches and one UGLY scar on my left ear :[<br>  i hate it. :[ people always ask to see it :[
IGcS9K62aa	This sounds exactly like my problems!! My daughter was a really lazy eater so it added in an extra curveball. <br>  <br>  First off, it is not too late to go back to breasfeeding exclusively. But it is more important that your daughter get back up to her birth weight. As much as we want to succeed at breastfeeding because it's "best" it's also best that they be healthy. <br>  <br>  Fundamentally, the more demand there is at the breast the greater your supply will be. I would get the syringe and tube, that would be the best option. It encourages her to be more aggressive at the breast. However, if you do not have it. Take a bottle and dribble a little bit of forumal/breast milk at the corner of her mouth. It'll encourage her to keep going. Feed as frequently as possible, 2 hours preferably. Pump after feeding (it'll help your supply). Once again get the syringe, it will be your best bet.  I had a lot of success with this tip: nurse for a few minutes, like 5, on one side, burp, switch sides, and do it again. This keeps them awake and more active vs. emptying a breast before moving on! Also if you "prime" your breast before feeding. Hand express some milk to give her a taste, it encourages her too! You can hand express while feeding her to help you flow a little faster. <br>  <br>  Also, there are some things you can take to get your supply up if necessary. Fenugreek works for most people. Take 2-3 times the recommended dose on the bottle. Take it until everything about you smells like maple syrup. (You can get it at most health foods stores, GNC, etc) I had success with a product from Motherlove, More Milk Plus. (You can get it a Whole Foods, Pharmacia, and a few other places). The link is below, it's expensive so I'd try fenugreek first. Goats Rue is supposed to help as well, I took it in conjunction with the More Milk Plus. Mother milk tea isn't too great.--you have to drink a lot of it. People have had luck with oatmeal (I didn't though). If you have problems with let down, have a beer/glass of wine. Visualize the milk flowing from your breast, techniques like that help! Just relax! Makes sure you're drinking plenty of water too!<br>  <br>  If you have access to a lactation consultant give it a shot. They can be really helpful. I know mine was!!<br>  <br>  Good luck. And whatever happens, try not to get too discouraged. I know it's hard not to. You try so hard as a parent--and you still feel kinda like a failure. But don't! If you have any questions feel free to email me!!! I've been through the ringer and then some!|`|avx7bLnKaa	personally Id say ditch the bottle for now [but slowly as you don't want her to lose weight].... and breastfeed only, pump after each feeding to help build supply and  maybe drink mother's milk tea , eat oatmeal and such to help build supply... also drink plenty of fluids and make sure you eat....<br>  <br>  get help from a lactation consutant as well|`|5wmrZEQ9aa	That is opposite what my pediatrician and lactation consultant told me.  You may want to get a second opinion.  My baby was a preemie, and at her 3 week appt., she was barely at her birth weight.  I was told from birth to feed her more often, instead of supplementing pumped milk, because that just lowers your  milk supply.<br>  It isn't too late to get your supply back.  I was told to feed my baby every 2 hours.  She would not cry to eat, so I was told to wake her up and feed her.  She never acted interested, but would eat if prompted.  She gained all her weight back and then some by 5 weeks.<br>  Drink lots of water, eat oatmeal, and feed more often.  <br>  My baby had  a latch problem because she was a preemie.  you can buy a nipple shield at Target or at your local lactation consultant's office.  It is more like the bottle, and it helps your baby transition.  I had to use one for a few months, then she latched perfectly without it.  Go with your instinct.|`|KDb96QS7aa	Ugh! How awful! My suggestion (aside from consulting the lac consultant again) would be to stop offering the bottle and nurse, nurse nurse to get your supply back up.  Also, pump in addition to try to get your supply back up.<br>  Edit - I just thought of something also...my kid has a preference for my left boob because it is leakier than the right.  So what I do is try to feed him from that one when he isn't cranky and he has just woken up from a nap - generally when he's in a good and patient mood.  So maybe since you need to nurse frequently to get your supply up anyway, you should also try to nurse when your baby is in a good mood/before he gets really hungry and cranky.|`|CVxdveTcaa	when i was breastfeeding my daughter wouldnt even nurse so i had to pump if thats the only way a baby will drink it then thats fine..as long as the babys getting breast milk and is happy and healthy...even though i couldnt nurse i still felt tht special bond wht my daughter|`|kuXhcmsJaa	stop the bottle and just nurse nurse nurse and your supply will go back up. if you want to use the bottle use the slow flow nipple because it makes it harder to get the milk out.|`|Jswomud7aa	Starting to change things before the baby is 6 weeks can cause nipple confusion, it's not necessarily flow preference, though it may very well be. <br>  <br>  Don't give her a bottle anymore. Whenever she cries, bring her to your breast. She will suck when she's hungry, it's a natural reflex, but it will take dedication on your part to get her back on track. Don't give up.<br>  <br>  To help my supply I would drink a beer. For some reaons it really would bulk me up. Also, there is mother's milk tea and fenugreek (tincture form taken with tea) which are natural ways to increase your supply.<br>  <br>  It's just about demand and supply at this point. The more she sucks the more she will demand and the more your body will supply.<br>  <br>  It's not to late to go back to breast feeding exclusively and I would do this for as long as you can.|`|b978f631fc787a963337206aa3833370aa	It's normal for babies to lose a little weight initially after leaving the hospital. How much did she lose?<br>  <br>  I can't believe they'd tell you to use a bottle - that is a surefire way to introduce nipple confusion, as you know now. You can take a chance and eliminate the bottles completely and she'll just eat when she's hungry. Or you can hand express or pump a little milk to get your flow started so she doesn't have to work as hard. Maybe try to nurse when she's just starting to get hungry as opposed to when she's all worked up and irritated and wants milk right away. It's not too late to keep nursing - you can keep pumping as well but know that you won't get as much as if she were nursing. And one thing I noticed with my second child - I couldn't pump as much as with my first, but I tried nipple stimulation and that helped to get my letdown going. <br>  <br>  You can also try using Fenugreek supplements to boost your supply. But other than that, as frustrating as it might be, if you want to continue nursing just keep trying to get her back on the breast and hopefully she will.
53QQ9KXEaa	I hate how insensitive people are. I am in a similar situation... I am working in a kitchen and am also pushing myself more than I'd like and still getting flack! Some of the people in there were saying that I didn't want to lift anything, when it was one thing that I didnt' want to lift! I even attempted to and decided not to push myself and told someone that I don't think I should do it. <br>  <br>  It's like, hello! I'm pregnant! Shouldn't you encourage me to work instead of mooching off of YOUR tax dollars? <br>  <br>  Anyway, if it's stressing you out that bad, I don't think that you should continue with it. It's not worth it to put you and your sons health at risk. Since he obviously doesn't get it, I think you should start looking for a job elsewhere. <br>  <br>  Good luck... Glad I'm not alone, but at the same time, it's also a ashame.
ELbs3Dpwaa	Legally you have the right to a break after so many hours.<br>  Look into your states employment laws.<br>  Call the employment commission for advice or what website to visit.<br>  Also, look into contacting OSHA (I think that is correct).  It is an employment safety organization.|`|LKIhUMCgaa	i agree w/ above answer, it's illegal for them not to give u a break, literally. when i went to alternative school, we had a class to teach us bout jobs, i don't remember all the info, but there is a law on how many breaks and for how long u're supposed to get depending on how many hours u're working. <br>  <br>  it does seem like they're trying to make u quit bc it's illegal for them to fire u if u're pregnant unless they have another reason (u not doing ur job). <br>  <br>  honestly, i'd suggest finding another job, u're only 10 weeks pregnant and it's gonna get a lot worse. u'll start to get a lot of back pains, will be hard for u to move around as much, and u cannot inhale the Clorox and u can legally refuse to clean the floors on ur hands and knees since inhaling harsh chemicals can complicate ur pregnancy. <br>  <br>  find urself another job hun, the stress can harm the baby by giving u high blood pressure and it's better to find a new job as soon as possible, bc the closer u'll get to ur due date, the less chance there'll be someone will hire u bc they'll consider it a high risk.|`|2292675077dae921390116e7862cc989aa	Call the labor department, your congressman, and the local TV Station that helps people with problems.<br>  <br>  Understand - workers do have "rights" as far as work is concerned--but also understand when you challenge these bad guys they can fire you.<br>  <br>  Also get your self a lawyer, your civil rights may be getting violated too.<br>  <br>  Good luck---|`|585b7dfd77e867b2877fe507e55eb149aa	It is against the law not to give you a break after so many hours.

Thanks!|`|GPdUBsaqaa	You should look into what the labor laws are in the state you live in - every state is different, so I don't want to be too specific, but not getting a lunch break is usually illegal. Some states even require additional breaks plus your lunch break depending on how long your shift it.  Being forced to work with chemicals while pregnant may be too - but the problem there is that your boss can argue that it is not possible given your job description for them to keep you away from them (I'm guessing you shouldn't be inhaling perm chemicals either). <br>  <br>  All of that said, you need to be careful - can you afford to lose this job? With unemployment the way it is most places, you're going to find that employee rights get stomped on a lot more than they used to, because employers know there are plenty of other people out there looking for work if you quit. And if you file a complaint, employers aren't supposed to be able to fire you, but they often find a way.

More profits mean more taxes paid?<br>  <br>  I am betting you get bored, take a stupid job, hang out with smug people and get married to the average good looking guy.  <br>  <br>  Then finish university, drink coffee or colas, get that bigger behind and juggle your mortgage.

Also apply this to other things in life! HOPE it helps.
RR35cmBdaa	yes u can still be pregnant and have a negitive test as i did said i was not then went to the doc she felt my tummy and stuff said i was about 5 weeks pregnant. if u want feel free to email me|`|1B91qtNQaa	Yes. I did not have a pregnancy test come up positive for almost a month after my missed period. <br>  <br>  Try the first pee of the day and try to wait a few more days before retrying the test. I wish I had bought stock in EPT for as many tests I went through.|`|qCj3BzWZaa	I am currently 37 weeks pregnant and when i missed my period i didn't get a positive test till almost 2 weeks after my missed period. All you can really do is not to worry cuz that can cause your period not to start, and keep taking test or go to the doctor and they can do a blood test.|`|q1Swxe3qaa	Yep! my very first test said negative! i went to get on the pill and they gave me a test, it said neg so I got the pill. They told me to start it when my period came and it never came! Two weeks later I took a test and it said positive, so i took 3 more, and all were positive!
lzcglDnMaa	Here is an awesome website with great info on SIDS.  Gives you details of what might cause it and ways to prevent it.<br>  <a href="http://www.emedicinehealth.com/sudden_infant_death_syndrome_sids/article_em.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.emedicinehealth.com/sudden_in...</a>|`|aLAmvX5Naa	No one knows for sure.|`|7rCeCVl2aa	No one really knows unfortunately. =(|`|LWXRVO5Haa	The cause of SIDS is unknown.<br>  The best thing you can do for your baby is breastfeed him and sleep close to him.<br>  The incidents of SIDS occurring is three times higher in babies who are not breastfed.<br>  There is a prevailing theory that carbon monoxide poisoning may be responsible for many of the deaths of Sudden Death Infant Syndrome (SIDS). There have been similarities seen in both carbon monoxide poisoning and SIDS|`|EyKJ737daa	Precisely what causes SIDS is still somewhat unknown but there are certainly precautions that can be taken to reduce the risk of SIDS occurring. SIDS is also reduced with age, I believe from memory, risk is non existent after 2 years of age!! I hope this doesn't happen to you or anyone else.  I know someone it happened to and I just felt so so so sorry for them.  Its so sad.  Good luck and all the very best.|`|HmXViQipaa	True...The cause is unknown..But there are some things to avoid. Smoking in home, putting loose blankets in bed with baby, stuffed animals in crib w/ baby, and laying newborn on stomach are big No No's.|`|DSZTruuqaa	What Can Be Done?<br>  <br>  Unfortunately, we cannot expect to prevent all SIDS deaths now. To do so requires a much greater understanding of SIDS, which will be achieved only with a commitment from those who value babies and with a considerably expanded research effort. However, there are things that can be done to reduce the risk of SIDS.<br>   <br>  <br>   <br>  <br>   <br>  <br>  Parents-To-Be<br>  <br>  1. Get medical care early in pregnancy, preferably within the first three months, followed by regular checkups at the doctor's office or health clinic. Make every effort to assure good nutrition. These measures can reduce the risk of premature birth, a major risk factor for SIDS.<br>  <br>  2. Do not smoke, use cocaine, or use heroin. Tobacco, cocaine, or heroin use during pregnancy increases the infant's risk for SIDS.<br>  <br>  3. Don’t get pregnant during the teenage years. If you are a teen and already have one infant, take extreme caution not to become pregnant again. The SIDS rate decreases for babies born to older mothers. It is highest for babies born to teenage mothers. The more babies a teen mother has, the greater at risk they are.<br>  <br>  4. Wait at least one year between the birth of a child and the next pregnancy.The shorter the interval between pregnancies, the higher the SIDS rate.<br>  <br>  Parents<br>  <br>  1. Place infants to sleep on their backs, even though they may sleep more soundly on their stomachs. Infants who sleep on their stomachs and sides have a much higher rate of SIDS than infants who sleep on their backs.<br>  <br>  2. Place infants to sleep in a baby bed with a firm mattress. There should be nothing in the bed but the baby - no covers, no pillows, no bumper pads, no positioning devices and no toys. Soft mattresses and heavy covering are associated with the risk for SIDS.<br>  <br>  3. Keep your baby’s crib in the parents’ room until the infant is at least 6 months of age. Studies clearly show that infants are safest when their beds are close to their mothers.<br>  <br>  4. Do not place your baby to sleep in an adult bed. Typical adult beds are not safe for babies. Do not fall asleep with your baby on a couch or in a chair.<br>  <br>  5. Do not over-clothe the infant while she sleeps. Just use enough clothes to keep the baby warm without having to use cover. Keep the room at a temperature that is comfortable for you. Overheating an infant may increase the risk for SIDS.<br>  <br>  6. Avoid exposing the infant to tobacco smoke. Don't have your infant in the same house or car with someone who is smoking. The greater the exposure to tobacco smoke, the greater the risk of SIDS.<br>  <br>  7. Breast-feed babies whenever possible. Breast milk decreases the occurrence of respiratory and gastrointestinal infections. Studies show that breast-fed babies have a lower SIDS rate than formula-fed babies do.<br>  <br>   <br>  8. Avoid exposing the infant to people with respiratory infections. Avoid crowds. Carefully clean anything that comes in contact with the baby. Have people wash their hands before holding or playing with your baby. SIDS often occurs in association with relatively minor respiratory (mild cold) and gastrointestinal infections (vomiting and diarrhea).<br>  <br>   <br>  9. Offer your baby a pacifier. Some studies have shown a lower rate of SIDS among babies who use pacifiers.<br>  <br>   <br>  10. If your baby has periods of not breathing, going limp or turning blue, tell your pediatrician at once.<br>  <br>   <br>  11. If your baby stops breathing or gags excessively after spitting up, discuss this with your pediatrician immediately.<br>  <br>   <br>  12. Thoroughly discuss each of the above points with all caregivers. If you take your baby to daycare or leave him with a sitter, provide a copy of this list to them. Make sure they follow all recommendations.|`|B1xrI9ZYaa	What is SIDS?<br>   Sudden Infant Death Syndrome (SIDS) is a medical term that describes the sudden death of an infant which remains unexplained after all known and possible causes have been carefully ruled out through autopsy, death scene investigation, and review of the medical history. SIDS is responsible for more deaths than any other cause in childhood for babies one month to one year of age, claiming 150,000 victims in the United States in this generation alone - 7,000 babies each year -nearly one baby every hour of every day. It strikes families of all races, ethnic and socioeconomic origins without warning; neither parent nor physician can predict that something is going wrong. In fact, most SIDS victims appear healthy prior to death.<br>  <br>  What Causes SIDS?<br>   While there are still no adequate medical explanations for SIDS deaths, current theories include: (1) stress in a normal baby, caused by infection or other factors; (2) a birth defect; (3) failure to develop; and/or (4) a critical period when all babies are especially vulnerable, such as a time of rapid growth.<br>   Many new studies have been launched to learn how and why SIDS occurs. Scientists are exploring the development and function of the nervous system, the brain, the heart, breathing and sleep patterns, body chemical balances, autopsy findings, and environmental factors. It is likely that SIDS, like many other medical disorders, will eventually have more than one explanation.<br>  <br>  Can SIDS Be Prevented?<br>   No, not yet. But, some recent studies have begun to isolate several risk factors which, though not causes of SIDS in and of themselves, may play a role in some cases. We share this information with you in the interest of providing parents with the latest medical evidence from research in the U.S. and other countries in the hope of giving your baby the best possible chance to thrive. (It is important that, since the causes of SIDS remain unknown, SIDS parents refrain from concluding that their child care practices may have caused their baby's death.)<br>  <br>  Where Can You Turn for SIDS Information and Support?<br>  <br>  The Sudden Infant Death Syndrome Network, Inc. is a not-for-profit, voluntary health agency dedicated to;<br>   eliminate Sudden Infant Death Syndrome through the support of SIDS research projects,<br>   provide support for those who have been touched by the tragedy of Sudden Infant Death Syndrome, and<br>   raise public awareness of Sudden Infant Death Syndrome through education.<br>  <br>  Some Basic Facts about SIDS:<br>   SIDS is a definite medical entity and is the major cause of death in infants after the first month of life.<br>   SIDS claims the lives of over 7,000 American babies each year ...nearly one baby every hour of every day.<br>   SIDS victims appear to be healthy prior to death.<br>   Currently, SIDS cannot be predicted or prevented, even by a physician.<br>   There appears to be no suffering; death occurs very rapidly, usually during sleep.<br>  <br>  What SIDS is Not:<br>   SIDS is not caused by external suffocation.<br>   SIDS is not caused by vomiting and choking.<br>   SIDS is not contagious.<br>   SIDS does not cause pain or suffering in the infant.<br>   SIDS cannot be predicted.<br>   SIDS is not new. It is referenced in the Old Testament (1 Kings 3:19).|`|o1StMQeyaa	The exact cause is unknown, however there are many things you can do to decrease the risk of your baby dying of SIDS.<br>  The biggest single risk factor for SIDS is sleeping on the tummy. This is NOT only because of the risk of suffocation when the baby is face down!<br>  For the complete SIDS foundation guilelines, visit their website:<br>  <a href="http://www.sidsandkids.org/safe_sleeping.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.sidsandkids.org/safe_sleeping...</a>|`|DcLiW4bbaa	No one knows for sure. But there are a lot of things recommended to do to prevent SIDS such as making sure baby doesn't get too hot, making sure they sleep on their back in their own crib, and keeping toys and loose blankets out of the crib during sleep time.|`|1SGl03Zlaa	The most recent research claims that SIDS may be caused by babies breathing in recirculated air due to lack of air flow where they are sleeping.|`|ME62Mtv4aa	It's still unknown there's only precautions you can take to try to prevent it.|`|d1df7701087311fcf1008982d372a396aa	No one really knows that's what experts are still trying to figure out, sadly.|`|cWP73qEsaa	It is still a mystery but they say one way to be safe is baby sleep on back.
Kpn4xceEaa	I've wondered the same thing, and I really don't know. You should celebrate this new baby just like the first, but somehow it feels greedy to me (I'd be kind of embarrassed because I don't really need anything). I like your idea of having a party and telling people not to bring anything. I don' t think that's rude at all.|`|Coc593Ikaa	It is understandable to want to have a party to celebrate. Consider not calling it a shower, as you don't want a shower anyway. Maybe a baby celebration or a baby party or a baby non-shower. People will probably get the idea, especialy if your husband is doing it as showers are generally not thrown by the parents themselves. Also maybe have a different style, like a Baby BBQ.|`|JnLoHaoAaa	If you don't feel comfortable having one, then just tell your hubby you don't really need one. Those few things you want I'm sure you can buy. It's only 3 things and if 20 people were to come what would they buy you? The extra stuff that you don't want. You can maybe go out to lunch with a group of friends to celebrate the new baby, but in my opinion a shower isn't needed in this situation|`|iKPSOMiSaa	well since you are asking, it is rude for the mother/father of the child either one to throw a shower. that should be done by a close friend or co worker or someone like a cousin. also, since your last baby was born just 17 months ago, i wouldnt agree to a shower. hopefully if you absolutely cannot afford what you will need then maybe family members will give you things a little along until the baby gets here|`|avx7bLnKaa	you will need diapers and wipes<br>  <br>  when I had my second baby shower I asked for diapers nad wipes... of course people bought everything under the sun but I asked for diapers and wipes....<br>   I wish I'd recieved more diapers|`|aJTBF7opaa	im gonna have a second one, im going to tell everyone to stick to the register cause i have lots left over from my first. Its not rude its the truth. Im going to register, and tell people i could use things like diapers, wipes, bottle inserts. If they dont like it then, they can deal with it, or buy you something u dont need and you can always return it, or save to give to a friend in need or even donate it to a teen pregnancy clinic or something|`|WmKjeUELaa	My friend had a baby shower for both her babies.  For baby #2 She just let people know in the invites that what she registered for were the only things she needed.  Even if you get something you need, you can always return it for something you want for the baby, or another need you had.|`|oQ5oKILHaa	You can still have an celebration of the new baby! There isn't anything wrong with a party. If its a baby shower people wanna bring gifts. Try to make it a not baby shower. I don't know what you would call it tho!!! LOL. Let hubby do it thats sweet of him.|`|ME62Mtv4aa	Just put gifts are not required, and that it's a celebration for the baby. Obviously in better format than that but you know what I mean. You will still get gifts I'm sure but people will come as a celebration for your new addition.|`|04833260a508ecf8d2a4938012444526aa	It is not proper to have a shower for a second child and even if you do it should not be given by your husband.It is rude to ask for very specific items making people believe you are very greedy and unappreciative of what they choose to buy.A lot of men think the more stuff people buy them the less they have to buy so it is ok.My own husband wanted to tell people we only wanted money for wedding gifts.Needless to say that idea didn't go far.For my second child some friends from our small church group threw me a little shower (surprise).I in no way expected it,but it was nice.I also find people will go ahead and buy nice gifts after the baby is born (without being asked).|`|AA11795652	My sister and mom threw me a 2nd baby shower.  My kids are three years apart and my 2nd was a boy (whereas my 1st is a girl) so I did need some stuff.  Not a lot of people came unfortunately due to the weather.  I didn't register because I had all the big items from my first child and I also didn't want to seem like I was asking for gifts.  Instead of regular gifts, you can have a diaper shower where everyone, if they want, can bring you diapers, wipes, or something that you'll obviously need.  A diaper party might be good because people can spend as little or as much as they want.  If I had to do it over, I wouldn't have had the 2nd shower and just let friends and family bring gifts to the hospital if they wanted to.|`|HF2HiUQJaa	You could write on the invites:  Presents are optional as I already have all the necessities for this baby but if you do insist on bringing a gift then I ask that you bring something very unique. The most unique gift will win a fantastic prize.<br>  That way you won't feel like you are pressuring anyone to fork out big money for expensive gifts but at the same time everyone will get the message that you have everything you need already and that if they are going to bring something then it should be something you can actually use!<br>  Goodluck with it and don't feel like you are being greedy or rude by asking guests not to bring the usual baby things, it's your shower so make the most of it and in the end i'm sure everyone would feel better knowing you are going to get use out of what they buy you.|`|d949d6371febf9695b8f8993df12ab4caa	You could let everyone know (if they ask) that you have most of the stuff you need except for some bigger items and you would like to purchase them yourself since they are a little bit pricey. If they ask what to get you maybe suggest gift cards, then you can get what you need..I see how you don't want to come off as being rude or seeming that you don't want their gifts. <br>  <br>  I would say its perfectly fine to have a baby shower for #2. Best of luck to you sweets!|`|513baad318d6fe572e9a3f122067f767aa	it ok to have a baby shower just ask for gift cards or diapers you going to need it anyways|`|1B91qtNQaa	To be honest I have always thought you were not suppose to have a baby shower for a second child. Unless of course there is some huge age gap. The biggest reason for this is because you already have most of the stuff a baby needs. <br>  <br>  I did not have a shower for my second but I could see why people would want to have one. The second baby is not any less important so why wouldn't they get a party too?<br>  <br>  I thought I would add that I have been to a baby shower for a second born before but the shower was after he arrived. It was kind of nice for his extend family to meet him. She got gifts but since we were family we knew what she still needed.|`|1ezYfkX7aa	I would still have a baby shower for your 2nd baby...each baby is a blessing and should be celebrated. I would still make a baby registry and send out a cute little card to where your registered in the baby shower invitation. Just put the things you need on your list such as diapers, wipes, the boppy pillow, carseat, baby shampoo and lotions, binkys, bottles...things of that nature. Everyone loves to shop for a baby and i know i would never go to a baby shower without a gift even if it was your 10th baby. Get the girls together, have lunch, play some games and enjoy your day!! congrats!
6o9lqSRfaa	That sounds like a really wonderful, comforting routine for your child! My two boys are about the same distance apart as yours, about twenty months. So I was also pregnant with a toddler, and know that it can be difficult with a bulging belly! What I did was just try to modify our position and the place we were cuddling (we invested in a larger, comfy rocking recliner). I knew my older son would soon be losing that one on one cuddle time with mommy, and I wanted to give him all the comfort I could to fortify him for those times when I would have to tend to his baby brother! For some great ideas on raising siblings who are close together in age, see The Baby Book, by Dr. Sears.|`|Yn6pM2Xyaa	at that age I was always able to just tell daughter it was time for naps and she just knew that was going to happen and accepted it as with bedtime.  From day 1 we always just placed her down in crib, tucked her in and walked away and she learned quickly to put herself to sleep.  Seems its time for your little one to learn that very hard lesson.  It will take a few times and will emotionally kill you to hear your child go through it but if you are consistent and persistent it will work and you will gain a little bit of freedom as your child gains a little bit of independence.|`|sB5dyaczaa	My brothers he is 4. When he gets cranky I hold him and rock him. Normally right after lunch he starts to get cranky. If he doesn't fall asleep with me rocking him I put him in the car and drive around for a while.|`|1WBimx1laa	I always put my daughter in her bed and lay down either on the floor or in a chair with my eyes closed next to thier bed and tell her its time to take a nap and she usually lays down and goes to sleep or try singing to him a song. Cover him up and give him his pacy to make him feel a little more comforted. I think he is a little old to be rocking asleep. I quit doing that with my daughter when she was 10 months old.|`|kM8dCoYqaa	My son gets up at 7am, i feed him him lunch at 11:30, and after lunch i pick him up and we say night night to the TV, night night to the horse, night night to the cat, night night to the ball and whatever else we want to say night night to and then i take him up stairs to his crip put him in it and he goes to sleep at about 12:30 and sleeps for <br>  1.5 - 3hours and then he goest to bed at 7pm and sleeps throught through the night, he is 17 months old|`|gGMERRkgaa	My daughter is 18 months old, usually around 12 after she eats lunch I tell her is nap time and she climbs up the stairs and I lay her in the crib, tuck her in and she goes to sleep.  I used to lay her with me for a nap and It always seemed to be drawn out and she just didn't sleep as well.|`|feAlXABSaa	After lunch time like around 12:30-1"30 anytime in between then he should have a nap then he'll sitll go to sleep through the whole night.
471ca0c8552c4633e525815ba702310aaa	Because mum does ;) LOL<br>  <br>  <br>  OK it's because it resembles the gentle rocking motions they felt in mum's womb.|`|DSZTruuqaa	THere is a lot of vibration in the womb.  The heart is pumping, mom is breathing, etc.  I think there is a familiar feeling attached and it distracts them from the weird outside noises.|`|ME62Mtv4aa	soothes them and reminds them of being in the womb|`|LWXRVO5Haa	I am not sure why, but the vibrating chair does soothe my daughter. It did a better job when she was younger.<br>  Your friend should not put his son's chair on top of anything! That is very dangerous and he should be ashamed.<br>  <br>  EDIT: I apologize. I just re-read your question and you do say he stands there with him.
WYk0zYdhaa	congrats!  Well every one and every pregnancy is different.  With our first it seemed like the soreness went away with my extreme nausea.  That would be into my 4th month.  This time though, man they still hurt and funny thing is that the size increase really isn't as dramatic.  The pain has decreased some, I mean I can hug my husband now lol.  I'm at week 20 though and keep waiting.....  I find that they hurt more at night when I take my bra off.  <br>  <br>  If you find that other symptoms are going away though I'd give your doc a call.  I called her for everything lol.<br>  <br>  I pray your nausea goes away soon so that you can enjoy your pregnancy;)<br>  <br>  Best of luck and blessings:)|`|hYRYO5GYaa	about 12 weeks for me...i heard they start hurting again towards the end tho|`|jcXSNjowaa	my breasts never hurt with any of my pregnancies.|`|vygYFdsSaa	You're lucky...my boobs hurrtttt so badly up until my 13th week.|`|AA11582608	Remember every woman and each of her pregnancies are different, (Me myself being pregnant 8 times)!!!  It is very normal.  Here I'm at about 8-months pregnant and my sore breast didn't start until my 7th month.  What's more I'm leaking brest fluid since my six month of pregnancy.  Both experiences are new for me.  I usually don't have sore best until after I give birth.  And leakage didn't begin for me until after birth either.  <br>  <br>  So you see things change from not only person to person, but from pregnancy to pregnancy.  None the less rest easy and Talk with your doctor if you have any further concern.<br>  <br>  Relax and take care|`|Ir9jGOo2aa	Ok mine hurt terribly for my first 3 months or so then they stopped now Im 18 weeks and they started hurting again, and guess what Stretch Marks! Yeah, I went from a C to a D..Keep rubbing cocoa butter or oil on your breast. Good luck|`|QCUPeW8aaa	My boobs never hurt so im sure its normal that yours are less sore.<br>  All of a sudden one day they went from a c to a d I feel like I just woke up one day and they were right there.<br>  Haha its crazy!|`|KNxs4PrZaa	mine didnt hurt very much in the beginning, they were a bit sore some days but not consistantly, i am 30 weeks now and they are very sensitive, its normal for them to not be sore constantly, your symptoms will come and go adn change the whole nine months.
c04001ac73fadc6492af9530145e7b3baa	It sounds like your in pre-labor. I just had my baby a week ago and it you will know when the pain doesnt go away and it happens back to back when you have pain/contractions every 5 minutes|`|WKxi3gWBaa	the sharp pains is the pressure of the  head lowering and when you walk it may hurt more because gravity pulls its head more so ... its what i felt when i was about that far along... then i went 2 weeks over due.... call your er and ask actually.. call the labor delivery and ask a midwife on call where ever it is your giving birth at if she /he is concerned they will have you come in and they will make sure everything is A-ok<br>  <br>  good luck!! and congrats|`|GR07LyyTaa	i didn't have a sharp pain in my vaginal area but i had very very bad contractions.. (was eating and doubled over in pain).. but that morning i had cleaned my house extremely well which they call nesting.. it's a sign of you going to have your baby soon|`|WHN5cuGZaa	yes|`|FLnEqAivaa	Sounds like your baby is engaged in your pelvis. Is this baby #1 for you? First babies tend to drop sooner than later babies. Usually it means labor is on its way sometime with in the next 2-3 weeks. Are you having other symptoms? Some to look for are diarrhea, pink mucus discharge, a gush of fluid ( your water breaking), contractions that start in your back and spread to the front...these are things that happen in early labor. If you notice these symptoms, then call the OB or midwife.|`|AA11906603	I don't know about your vaginal area. For me it was my whole belly. Are you still leaking a little? You might want to tell your doctor.  Maybe your baby is in a weird position. I think you should go get checked again today. My mom played tennis the day before I was born. Weird, I know.<br>  <br>  I didn't have any problem walking, even the day I went in to give birth. False Labor started on Friday. Real Labor by Easter Sunday and birth on Monday. When your contractions are regular and about 5 minutes apart, you need to start paying attention and get over to the hospital or birthing center.|`|jkDbDjcRaa	I never had extreme pain at 37 weeks.<br>  I was induced though, and didn't go into labour on my own, so I don't know if that's what happens.  I've never heard of that.<br>  <br>  Unless you're having contractions already.<br>  <br>  I would talk to your doctor to make sure everything's ok.<br>  Good Luck!
7rCeCVl2aa	Awww! Don't take it personal. It Sounds like she is playing the "I want you but I don't want you" game. It's really normal. She's testing you to see where you take it.<br>  <br>  The world is still new to her so she is pushing her limits with the one person she knows can can push. It will pass with time. 1 year olds are fussy. It's frustrating being 1. There are so many things to touch and taste and they hear, "no!" so many times...<br>  <br>  It'll pass. Give it some more time and just keep doing what you do best. Being a mom. =)|`|1k6UUC8qaa	she might be having difficulty being understood try to get to the core of what she wants, but remember the terrible two's are right around the corner and baby's to change with age.  ask your pediatrician just to be sure but keep your cool because you don't want to turn this into a power struggle with her then on one wins.  Try to understand your baby.|`|ME62Mtv4aa	Yeah it's normal and it's just a phase after a few weeks she'll be past this one and on to the next phase lol just hang in there|`|DiRRKyipaa	Its Called Growing up|`|rdpZrBc9aa	Is she teething?
cWP73qEsaa	you will probably get a pap smear done first and a std vaginal and blood test but thats in the lab. then they will do an ultrasound but depending on how far along u are. if your 10 weeks preg or less they will do a vaginal ultrasound they put a wierd looking think in your vagina and tada u will see your baby! if you are more than 10 weeks it will be a top of the belly ultrasound.|`|2RFgrJCBaa	Hey hun!!!!<br>  <br>  CONGRATULATIONS and welcome to the club!!!!!<br>  <br>  Well first off, if you have insurance go ahead and call around to find an ob/gyn.  Every Gynocoligist is not and Obstetrician.  So do your research first.  If you don't have insurance, go to your local health department and they should sign you up for pregnant women's medicaid if that is available in your state.<br>  <br>  Once you make your appointment this will be your first prenatal appointment.  The only thing I can tell you is that this will be the beginning of the poking.  My first prenatal appointment is on March 18th.  I'll  be 8weeks 5days by then, and I'm to freaking excited!!!  If you want go ahead and do some research on the web and you'll find out all about it.<br>  <br>  I wish you a healthy and happy 9months and welcome to the club!!<br>  <br>  Take care of you and baby!!<br>  <br>  Oh yeah if you haven't started yet, start taking your prenatal vitamins with folic acid.<br>  <br>  Again, take care hun!!!!|`|t4Ud4ySDaa	At my first appointment, they just asked about family history and discussed what I'd be going through the next couple of months. I did not get a sonogram until 18 weeks and then got another one at 22 weeks. If a dr. cannot hear the heartbeat he will often give an ultrasound however I don't think they do them "just because"|`|WmKjeUELaa	No ultrasound on your first appt. because its really too early to see anything.  Normally they do those around 18 weeks, sometimes sooner or a little later.  You will have to answer a bunch of questions about your medical background (and family's), as well as the father's.  You will have a urine test, some blood work done, they will give you a pap smear and breast exam.  You will also have your weight and blood pressure checked.  You might meet with a nutritionist as well.  It all depends on the doctor's office.  They should also let you hear the heartbeat, but it might be hard to find at first since the baby is so tiny.   Good luck to you!|`|4b7808b550192ac7ad93353a410ef2e4aa	yess you will get an ultrasound . you will also have to pee in a cup . (you do this most appts anywayss] . they will takee blood from youu<br>  theyy wil do a pap smer or how ever you spell that . <br>  <br>  and the doctor will ask u if you havee any quesitionns <br>  <br>  =D <br>  <br>  good luckkk <br>  <br>  imm hoping for a girl|`|W1p6LetFaa	It really depends how far you are.  I called the doctor as soon as I found out, so when I was about 5 weeks pregnant.  I was a little appalled that they just prescribed me some prenatal vitamins over the phone and didn't schedule an appointment for another 3 weeks, since they don't like to see pregnant patients before 8 weeks, because there is nothing they can really "do" before then.  At that first appointment, I didn't even meet with a doctor, just the nurse.  She gave me a urine test to confirm the pregnancy and a ton of "Congrats, You're Pregnant" type pamphlets with a ton of information on pregnancy.  That's it!  It wasn't until a month later that they scheduled the other stuff (like a pap, although I didn't need one before I had had one when I was a week pregnant but didn't know it).  I also got my first ultrasound at 12 weeks.<br>  <br>  So, (sorry, that was a long answer for a simple question) it really depends how far you are and what the practice of your doctor is.  They might do a lot, they might do a little.<br>  <br>  Congrats and best wishes to you and your little one!|`|eeyGYRcPaa	i went to the lab first to get a positive blood test. then when i went to the actual doctors they did a complete medical history on my husband and my families. they took a urine sample, checked my weight and blood pressure. ten did a pap smear and a chlamydia test.  we had a problem determining time of conception so i had an ultrasound at 6 weeks to determine my due date. but after that they didn't want to do another until i was 12 weeks (which is when most women get their first....) i hope this helps! :D|`|pR4nLjyRaa	First off you'll probably have to fill out alot of paperwork about your medical history, insurance, etc. You'll pee in a cup (this is required EVERY time you go), have your blood pressure checked and be weighed. They might do some blood work to check your iron levels. (Usually just a finger prick) Not all doctors offer ultrasounds so it really depends. My doctor does not offer ultrasounds so early, but some do.<br>  Congrats on your pregnancy! :)|`|5Eg8dpnMaa	At my first appointment, I got an ultrasound done and it was really exciting to see my little one in there squirming around. But I think it all depends how far along you are. I went to see my doctor for the first time when I was 12 weeks because I was seeing my gyno before that.<br>  <br>  Congrats!!|`|Ks7lENScaa	I had a ultrasound done in the doctors office.  I found out my actual due date.  I also had my weight and blood pressure taken.  Then I had to get blood work done.  It seems so strange around this time last year I was going through this.  <br>  Congratulations!!|`|2UIEE856aa	i made my appoitmen right when i found out, and the first appt. was my medical history gathering and questions

rK9lDXnCaa	Are you enjoying being a mum? Relax, if you are pregnant again you have time to adapt to another baby. Just enjoy this time with number one, get dad involved with the loving and caring and when number two comes along, he can feel able to watch the first baby while you have the second. Then I think maybe you could both think about waiting, or having protected sex for a while. Back to back babies are only a problem if you let them be, or you let people tell you! If the babies Dad is OK with it, no problems! Relax.|`|PEGWnd5kaa	It is about like having twins.  It will be much more difficult than having one.  Humans are designed to breastfeed, and through breastfeeding have a natural birth control for at least six months after the birth of a baby. Breastfeeding also tones the uterus and gets it back to pre-pregnant size.  <br>  Your first child needs your attention and focus.  <br>  Siblings that are born close together have some pain associated with the loss of friends, ones that gravitate toward their sibling who is of similar age.  When a greater distance is between siblings it is unlikely that friends will choose one sibling over another, also when a sibling is old enough (around 3 years difference) they are interested in babies, and also have the ability to help a bit to care for an infant.|`|PHAmW5m2aa	It's not terrible its actually a blessing of course, the main concern is that your body has not been given time to heal properly. I found out I was pregnant again when my son turned 9 months old. I had a c-section with my first so the fact I was due to have another one so  soon after my elidgibility to have a natural birth went down and they're going to do another section. I honestly think aside from being tired and the challenge of having 2 children under the age of two, its really amazing!! Im due in June with #1 and my son just turned 1 years old =D! I think the good out weighs the bad and your baby will now have a playmate that's close in age and it will eventually be easier with 2 because they'll entertain each other. Buy a pregnancy test and confirm you're pregnant and if you are I'm sure you know the drill =P Best wishes to you and Congradulations!!!! <3|`|t4Ud4ySDaa	bless your heart|`|AA11763588	It is hard on the body.<br>  <br>  And it will be hard on your mentally. I had 2 kids 13 months apart. There were days where I would sit in the shower and cry wondering how I got myself into this. Attention was hard to give to both when they both wanted it at the same time. <br>  <br>  They are now 5 and 6, and it's the same. I can only compare it to having twins! You can't buy or do for one without doing for the other.<br>  <br>  But, on the other hand they are close, thick as thieves if you will. And for that I'm happy.|`|uQc4UA2Caa	i dont think it would be bad. for a minute i thought u meant a prosterior labour|`|ugq1Dgsuaa	My sister and i are 11 months apart. My mom was only 15 when i was born, and 16 when my sister was born. She said it was tough on her mentally and physically. Her body never really got a great chance to recover with me, and then my sister was born not even a year later. The stress was hard, but she tells us that we kept each other busy so it wasn't so bad. My sister and i are inseparable!|`|jkDbDjcRaa	It's hard on your body, but you should be ok.<br>  I know lots of people who have children that close together, and everything turns out fine :)|`|SDKwVtuMaa	it depends on how old you are<br>  <br>  but if you are over 20 then yea it's not that bad, hun|`|LUNne2O5aa	It's callled Irish Twins.

WmKjeUELaa	Noxzema is what I use.  It seems to help rather well.|`|QIDhVAjjaa	I think any one is okay to use just make sure you read the warning on the bottle before you use it and clearasil seems to be safe.
3w7VztEWaa	I think once her or the guy can drive...then she can date.|`|NGJCUYeraa	Honestly, you're lucky she told you at all. A lot of my friends' parents don't even know the people their children are dating, much less know that their  children date at all. And I certainly would never tell my parents that I'm dating, even though they would be totally cool with it. Reward her for even telling you by letting her do it. Because when she's older and the stakes are higher,  you want her to look back to how awesome you were about this and tell you about it then. In my experience, it's not the people who start dating at an early age that have sex early, its the people who go behind their parents backs to date that do. Plus realistically, most likely nothing will come out of it and she won't date again for a couple of years.|`|SrcoG7JRaa	It depends on what kind of date this is.<br>  If it's boy and girl alone without anyone else or a parent, no way, Jose!<br>  But if they're just going to a movie (or public place) as friends with a group of similarly aged peers, holding hands and stuff, I would probably be okay with it, provided I knew the people she was going with and had met the boy.<br>  <br>  For real boyfriends, alone one-on-one dates and such, my husband and I agreed we're not even THINKING about letting that happen until 16 with our daughters, and son if we ever have one. <br>  I think there's something horrifically wrong in the world if 10 year olds (4th and 5th graders! WTF?!) are thinking about dating. My little sister is 11 and is totally bewildered by the trend among her peers of hand-holding and hugging all the time, which I'm actually glad of, LOL. It means she's less likely to do it so soon.<br>  <br>  13 year olds, and certainly 10 year olds, do not need to and should not have real boyfriends/girlfriends. Period. That's just sick and I am not going to jump on board with this trend of allowing little children to try to act like adults and engage in adult behaviors.<br>  <br>  If nothing else puts you off letting kids date at such young ages, just remember the 13 year old father in England. Betcha his parents never thought it could or would happen to their family; they're surely kicking themselves for it now.|`|Enzrj1hKaa	How thick are you people! - (joking, don't start dishing out thumbs down, I'm entitled to an opinion)  If you tell a teenager they aren't allowed to do something they want to do, they are more likely to do it. The fact that they know its wrong makes it more fun.  <br>  <br>  I have friends who hate their parents because they try to impose stupid restrictions and rules like this on them.  <br>  <br>  What happens when your kid goes behind your back and does something stupid like gets pregnant - after being told she isn't even allowed to ask boys out, she definitely isn't going to feel comfortable telling you is she?  She is going to be scared and wont feel she has the guidance and support that you should be there to give her..<br>  <br>  You can't wrap her in cotton wool all her life.  Treat her with respect, and she will give it back.  Would you rather be open with her, and know who she is with and where, and what they're doing; or would you rather she snook around behind your back and felt distanced and pushed away from you.  <br>  <br>  To answer your question, there isn't an answer.  I started when I was 12, my girlfriend started when she was 14 with me, and we have friends who have always been single.  We're all pretty similar though - we all go out together, we talk to each other, and none of us are pregnant!<br>  <br>  So stop worrying, let her live her life and enjoy herself.<br>  <br>  Happy Parenting  :-)|`|mfBkH3qtaa	I am 13 and not allowed to date. I go behind my parents back and date anyways lie about where im going etc. So I would just let her. Or she will go behind your back and she will be scared shitless if she got pregnant.

Many parents are too relaxed with their children and want to just be their friends.<br>    When teens start entering middle/high school their hormones start clouding their thinking.You should make the rule that she should move out before she dates because hat shows true maturity.<br>    At 16/17 it just seems like your more mature because your parents still provide for you and your mind will change 100s of times from 13-24 about who you wanna be with.<br>      You shouldn't go by what other parents do because many people today have too relaxed atitude about moral issues especially in America.We tend to do things just because we have the "right" to.<br>    We(I'm 14) as teens have the rest of our life to date but while we're young we need to enjoy ourselves because really when your 18, your on your own with bills and everything.<br>    There's going to be a lot of  people your daughter and every other teenager is going to like but we can't date all of them. <br>      All these people talking about dating at 12, 13, 14 ; its not real love.Come to my school, my classmates are always breakin' up and they sound like adults when they talk about relationships.And these people saying that dating whenever you want are probably the same people who are rebellious against everything, think there always right and want to get a small burst of excitement from something wrong.|`|woNDzxGKaa	I think that once a kid enters middle school (6th or 7th grade) they should be allowed to date, but have limits. Maybe holding hands and kissing for short periods of time if they feel ready, (no make out sessions!) but no going over to the other's house without a parent around, not going out on dates that aren't in a public place, and so on. It mostly depends on the child's maturity.<br>  <br>  As to your question, if your child thinks she is ready to date, than go ahead and let her! Just make sure she knows the rules and risks.|`|owpjHPOxaa	my mom started "dating" when she was in grade six, so that's when i was allowed.. but then again, that's just like movies and hinging out and (lol) holding hand in hallways and stuff, usually nothing gets rough til high school, so i think that's completely reasonable<br>  <br>   but you know my experience is that if you are less strict to begin with then your child will be less likely to rebel against you, you, it's the same with makeup etc...  <br>  <br>  like since i was pretty much free to do whatever i wanted with boyfriends, makeup, clothes, drugs.. i really think that it's rewarding to do what you know is right.|`|hxUXjg1faa	I'm 17 and was told I wasn't aloud to date till I was 16, but i ended up breaking that rule at a young age. So i think as long as your daughter<br>  is open with you about it you should let her. I think it will make her trust you a little more.|`|LUNne2O5aa	I"m 13. Trust me, at this age it doesn't matter if you "date" someone. All the couples at my age just go to movies or ski or something w/ friends. It's not serious.

It makes out society look really stupid. 15 MAYBE but usually 16-17|`|a448ILgCaa	too young! thing will lead to things and by 15 she would most likely had sex. wait till she is 15 or 16|`|AA12080472	i think that as a parent you need to get your rules together and stick with them.  your daughter may not even be telling the truth about her friends being allowed to date by their parents.<br>  <br>  anyways your daughter follows your rules not her friends parents rules.<br>  <br>  what you allow is based on  your own personal beliefs.|`|AA12005593	well, at around 13 you should take them to the movies and things like that. but you should supervise them.<br>  but, when she's 15 and older you should let her go to the movies/mall/dinner without supervision.<br>  <br>  that's how it is, at my house.<br>  except, i didnt start dating until i was 15.|`|Cx5Zo7IIaa	Dating should be reserved for adults who are contemplating taking a mate. It used to be a way for for people to get to know one another to decide if they are the one. So what if she likes him, are you seriously going to let your 13 year old daughter act out on these feelings? If she wanted to jump off a cliff and told you all her friends were doing it would you let her? If you let her start "dating" now, she will be jumping off a cliff just a different kind. Sorry so harsh but I saw plenty of my friends start "dating" this young and most of them wound up pregnant by the time they were 16 and dropping out of high school. If she must do this you have to supervise, anything short of complete supervision would be giving her the chance to eventually ruin her life. Offer to take them to the movies and sit two rows behind them or have him come over to your house and watch TV again where you can chaperon and supervise. My parents were like that with me and now that I look back I am glad they were.|`|kc2Sa7ibaa	My house doesn't have a rule... At 10 relationships aren't real though even when they think they are. Heck 1/100000000 14 year old's 'relationships' are real. I'm 14 and it is scary to think that some people my age are out having sex. If it is something just like a special friend - hugs and peck kisses than it is fine. If you are worried about something else happening.. You should step in. <br>  <br>  It is scary and most parents have a blind eye to this sort of thing. I am not saying it will happen to your daughter but there are pregnant 13 year olds out there... scary|`|AmqQ9it5aa	14 Graduated 8th Grade....................Depending on the maturity and self esteem level of the teen.<br>  <br>  You don't want to turn loose a teen who is not sure of themselves.|`|DWl8nfyWaa	I think that's a little young to date.

McQanl5Aaa	The person who said that sperm dies when it hits air got inaccurate information...sperm CAN live outside the body for a little while. Its highly unlikely for a woman to actually get pregnant because the sperm would have to travel such a long distance without dying, but it has happened. There are a few documented instances where a woman was a virgin, hymen still intact, but still wound up pregnant because of fooling around.|`|Q27cXlGbaa	yah it can happen.<br>  sperm can live outside the body but not for that long.|`|hYRYO5GYaa	it can but not likely the sperm has to get inside of her and find an egg, unlikely if he just got *** on her|`|SQMMOeqnaa	hmm...sperm dies when it hits air, but there's always that possibility b/c of the moisture so both of you are wrong and right..it goes either way.. this is a question that has no exact right answer..if sperm comes into contact with the vagina, it thrives off of the moisture and therefor can enter and the woman can become pregnant. but sperm also dies once it hits air and if it did that and then got into the vagina, chances of getting pregnant can decrease, but its always possible.|`|nIP5bRVzaa	yes it can happen it's rare but can happen. your friend is right

Also she is booking me in with fertility specialist if I'm not preggers.  She seemed optimistic that it could still turn out that way so I'm encouraged.  I have similar symptoms but more often mild cramping and boobies are sore and heavy but not itchy.  OH!  and deep nasty breakouts!  yuck!

Jswomud7aa	If your doctor fills out the papers for pregnacy-disability, you can get disability payments from the time you apply to 6-weeks postpartum. Then you can apply for a form of unemployment insurance for maternity leave that you can get. It's for another 6 weeks.

EyKJ737daa	Check baby's medical history book that you take with you to the doctors where they record all of baby's shots.  I'd be curious to know what it was.  Unless of course she had a live injection at 6 months and a new one has come out in the meantime that is also live and free but generally they'd make you come back in a month but no I haven't heard of 9 month injections, just the standard 2mo,4mo,6mo,12mo,18mo and 4yrs.  Be curious though to know exactly what it was sweetie just for your own piece of mind.|`|pLNDY4BRaa	nope.<br>  <br>  There actually is a chart at our dr.'s office that states when babies are given there shots. it says 2 months, 4, 6, 8 and then 12. says nothing about 9 months there.<br>  My daughter nor any other child I know has had a shot at 9 months...<br>  <br>  maybe its different depending on were you live?<br>  (dont know why it would be tho =S)|`|GlzVQclpaa	Nope you can check out your states health department website for information on recommend vaccine schedules.|`|UMRdHuuVaa	WOW here in australia we get needles at 2, 4, 6 and 12 months.|`|jkDbDjcRaa	My daughter had shots at 9 months too.|`|pXSKSS3daa	I think I answered your question earlier about this.<br>  <br>  Anyway, no, my son did not receive any shots at his 9 month check up. It was just basically to check his height, weight, and to see how he was doing developmentally.
OgzHcNMsaa	Here's something i tried with my daughter and it greatly decreased her gas. Mix the formula in  one bottle and shake,  then pour it into the bottle she's drinking from. You leave all the gas bubbles in the bottle she's not using. It's worth a try because it worked for me.|`|BMfn0D9gaa	its a good thing, a bad thing would be for it to build up in her belly.  I used mylicon for my daughter when she was newborn and it worked really well!|`|aca803aafd407291581b58b9be71df4daa	I agree that it is better that it isn't trapped.  Like the others suggested try some mylicon.  You can even drop a little in the bottle to reduce air bubbles when mixing.<br>  <br>  My baby is breastfed and still got gas...so it just happens with little babies.  It will get better!|`|DSZTruuqaa	actually passing the gas means it isn't trapped causing more pain, so that is a good thing.  Formulas are generally harder on the digestive system.<br>  <br>  Do you have access to gripe water?<br>  Go chat with your pharmacist about gas drops|`|ME62Mtv4aa	try gas drops like Mylecone or Little Tummy's. Also lay her across your lap sideways with her belly down and in the crease of both your legs and rub her back. Make sure her head is open to breath though (of course)|`|QjM16GBKaa	My son went through tons of Mylicon. It will get better. Hang in there!|`|o1StMQeyaa	All babies pass a lot of gas and it's completely normal. The fact that you changed her formula is likely to make her more gassy and unsettled while her body gets used to it.<br>  It's not advisable to change a baby;s formula unless you really have to. If it is necessary, change it gradually over a period of 1-2 weeks, 1 part new to 5 parts old, then 2:4, etc. This will help to minimise tummy pain, etc.
QIDhVAjjaa	Try waking him up an hour earlier and sending him to bed an hour later also if he takes naps try to keep them in the morning or cutting them shorter in the night or afternoon.|`|jkDbDjcRaa	My daughter just started doing the same thing 4 nights ago!<br>  She's 21 months old.<br>  <br>  We took down her crib and put her in a toddler bed (she figured out how to jump out).  <br>  I'm hoping this will be the answer.<br>  <br>  But what we've been doing in the meantime, is sitting in the room with her so she knows someone's there, and trying to keep her up later, trying to wear her out so that she'll have to sleep lol.  It's worked a bit.<br>  She went from 2 hours of sleep a night to 6 hours.|`|rE15gSFraa	How old is he? Family background? any medical problems?|`|m4YALsU9aa	Too much caffeine. Don't give him sugars and soft drinks, feed him fruits and milk.|`|kM8dCoYqaa	how old is he?
b10aMPdOaa	Hey, things will come naturally for you.  My daughter turned 14 in September and I had my son in October.  She's great with him.  She feeds him, bathes him, dresses him and generally she's a mini mum.  She was scared at first but now 4 months on if I needed to I would trust her completely to leave him with her for an hour or so.  One thing she does hate about the big age difference;  when we are out shopping everybody thinks that Michael is her's, she gets, "is that yours?" "how old is your baby".  She thinks that people think she is a sl*t and tells them that he is her baby brother.  Just a little tip for you, beware of other people judging you without knowing the facts.  I'm sure you'll be a super big sister.  Good luck to you all xxxx|`|AjBpAPpdaa	Aww...just care for her, treat her appropriately as she gets older, i made the mistake of swearing and doing whatnot infront of my sisters (cos of my bro) and now they are fiesty ones. Just be nice and friendly.|`|kmY4uD2Oaa	Ahhhh, good luck being a big sis xxx|`|CvESLNnkaa	First of all things will change for good and bad.  The baby will need alot of attention expecially in the first 3 months.  She will depend on your parents for everything, you do not, so don't be suprised if you don't get as much attention as you are used to in these first few months.  Be mature and understanding with midnight feedings and constant care your parents are trying their best im sure.  Just make sure they know you are willing to help but also need things sometimes too.  Your little sister will not be much fun at first most likely because newborns cant do much a baby can't even sit on their own until around 6 months old.  About 6-9 months she will become a lot more fun.  I hope this helps.  You will be a geat sis im sure.|`|OPrgBGAjaa	you are doing great so far helping with the room picking toys being a big sister just comes naturally your relationship with your parents will not change just be prepared for your parents to be spending a bit more time with your little sister as they need alot of care you can help a bit by doing some house work like washing up just wee thing like that i have 2 smaller sisters there is 10 years between me and the youngest when she was born we went to see her and the first thing she done was graped my thumb and would not let it go as she got older when she was not well she always came to my room never went to my mum and dad good luck you will be a great sister|`|4hNdYjjraa	Im going to be a mum and im only fifteen, and I'm asking the same questions, and you know what everyone is telling me, they are saying your going to love this baby so much that you wont mind looking after her and putting up with her! and either will you, your going to be a great sister, and when you get older she will look up to you.|`|1B91qtNQaa	I would see if the hospital that your mom is delivering at has a sibling class. My daughter went to one and they showed very basic baby things like how to hold them and how a diaper went on. <br>  <br>  Just realize that things are going to be different and at first your parents might be in a sleepless daze but it will get better. I am sure if are feeling left out if you just let them know in a kind way how you feel they will make sure they give you some extra love.<br>  <br>  Holding your sister will be a great way to bond. If possible bottle feeding her every once in a while will help you bond. I would say one of the best ways you can help your parents is by helping take care of domestic chores like dishes and bathroom cleaning.<br>  <br>  You are going to be a great big sister!|`|ncWigo1Laa	I was 12 when my mom had my brother. Just be your self and she will wanna do everything you do and follow you everywhere(wheather you want her to or not:)) When she gets home from the hospital your mom will be EXAUSTED. It would really help her out to take out the trash, sweep the floor, start the dishwasher/a load of laundry without being asked. At first the baby will wake up every 2-3 hours to eat, pee etc...Other than that theres not much mor the babys going to but sleep. It will be a month or two before you can really play with her, but until then just enjoy holding her. Ill be honest if the baby has colic she will cry ALL THE TIME and that might be a good time to stay with family/friends. Luckilly it only lasts a few weeks. When she is 4-6 months old is when she will start to really play, but untill then she will enjoy funny faces and peek-a-boo.when she gets a little older you can play dress-up, paint her nails etc... and she will have so much fun. Things dont have to change between you and your parents. It will be totall chaos at first, but things will soon calm once everyone gets back to "normal". Just realize that your parents will be with the baby alot, but friends and family(or even a sitter) can watch the baby while you and your parents go out and spend time just the 3 of you. Yes, your parents are going to be proud of their new baby, but they are also proud of the things you do. When you get a good report card, do chores without being asked, help with the baby they will want to brag about you to. Theres no answer on how to be a good big sister. You can decide if you want to help her get away with things(only small things that aernt a big deal of course) and she will want to be your best friend, or if you want her to no that there are rules and she needs to mind them. Rember that she is going to want to be just like you so dont do anything you wouldent want her to be doing if she was your age. You will be her role model and and your decisions will have an impact on hers. Also shes not YOUR responsibilty. If you want to go out with friends, then dont feel bad about leaving her. Play with her all you want, but do your own thing to. I always wanted to have a baby sister, but a brothers cool to.<br>  <br>  <br>  congradulations,hope this helps|`|OrKpKxkHaa	It is very sweet that you are concerned about being a good sister. I love having sisters, we are like best friends. When she is little, she will look up to you with the utmost respect (as long as you are sweet to her) and when she is older, you will become the best of friends! Adults might be all over the baby and might leave you feeling a little left out. Most of the time with younger kids, people realize that they need attention too but with you being a teenager already, they might think you are just fine with all of the attention going towards the baby. Try not to take it too personally. At first she might cry a bit but it wont last too long. Your parents might keep her in their room for the first few weeks or months and that will help you also since they will be able to tend to her quickly and quietly at night. My daughter was 7 when I had my second child and she actually enjoyed waking up at night to watch her eat and get her back to sleep. When she is very little, you can help your mom by watching the baby while she cooks dinner or maybe if she isnt feeling well. You might be surprised at how much a new baby sleeps in the first few months. Other than that, she will poop a lot and need her clothes changed from spitting up and drool. Mostly though, she will sleep. Hopefully your parents dont put too much pressure on you as you are her sister not a third parent. Just be yourself and I am sure she will love you! Good luckI know you will be an amazing sister and help to your parents!
HUl4yvDBaa	It's an awesome name! <br>  <br>  I love it. I loved the spelling, especially.<br>  <br>  Don't know about that capital E, though.<br>  <br>  Jayelle-Ryan Taighler, is better. Minor details such as capitalization is what makes or breaks a name.|`|qxy9xCAsaa	No, it's not nice the way you have it.  It wouldn't be so bad to have Jayelle as a first name, but adding Ryan to it makes it really weird.  And spelling Taylor that way is just goofy.|`|LSmPH2usaa	really cute, I have always liked the name Ryan for a girl, I would have spelled it Rhyan.|`|aigFTh1Vaa	its very unique I like the spelling of Taighler, never thought to spell it like that|`|kvCa4xCmaa	I love it!!|`|Hupx8wr0aa	i've never heard the name jayelle but its really pretty! and if taighler was the first name i would say spell it taylor but since its the middle name it doesn't really matter how you spell it.<br>  ?|`|farAMKNpaa	I think you should drop the Ryan.It kinda makes the name a bit of a mouthful.Just stick to JayElle.Sounds pretty unique.|`|JIOfbDxVaa	Sorry but I think it's a bit much. I don't really like the boys names it in it. (Jay and Ryan) It also looks kinda long. You should at least spell Taylor right.|`|Am54a7c0aa	Not really, it's a bit complicated and will be misspelled a lot.|`|jkDbDjcRaa	Nope.<br>  <br>  First name is too long and complicated.<br>  Middle name, will be mispronounced.|`|s14GvRHLaa	cuteee<br>  <br>  thats a beautiful name!

Those menstrual bits? They're kittens, and you better try to put them back until they've had a chance to mature - The urine is #1 cause of pregnancy in the developed world, so again, I'm so sorry, but it seems you are. Best thing in the world for sore breasts? Get a cucumber, slice it lengthwise and stick it in between them - something about enzymes or fumes from the cucumber help to numb the pain. I hope this helps, and good luck with your pregnancy!|`|PeoOb4aHaa	I'm truley sorry for your lots.<br>  <br>  On the bright side, you'll be getting a new mucous plug!|`|GtPnXzPAaa	Urine luck.

One that takes after your incredible hawtness and hairyness.|`|snUDfcfgaa	Yes you are pregamint.  You can get pergo from urine.  Urine babbies are jaundice babbies.

He just wants to look cool. Heehee|`|ozATw7s0aa	No. It looks weird and he's going to want it off in 10 years. It's unattractive and no one wants to see a boy with his ear pierced.|`|X6wFMuu0aa	Your son is certainly old enough to have his ears pierced now.  I think boys looks nicer with both ears pierced rather than only one.  When my son got his ears pierced we never even considered piercing only one ear.|`|iH3piuBkaa	i got my ears peirced before i could even CRAWL! let him doo iht . wat harm is iht guhnna do . nothing . wat iht might boost uhp his confidence buht ihts better then havin be madd aht yu for sumthing stupid .|`|7f065a5f8c99309ffaeba42afcaa6331aa	tech places cannot perform this unless they are 18.. i believe that to be the law but not sure...i this person wants this..he/she will find a way|`|dn2tsXlBaa	12 is okay|`|N5AE9O97aa	Thats a good age.|`|woNDzxGKaa	Totally!<br>  <br>  I got my ears pierced when I was 3.<br>  <br>  no big deal!

EzrciMgXaa	if you used condoms and they didn't break you have 99.9 percent that she Is not pregnant.  periods can be late for no reason.|`|t4Ud4ySDaa	For some reason I get that you all are a young couple. If you used a condom I doubt she is pregnant. However, there is a slight possibility. Maybe her periods are just irregular. I wouldn't worry just yet. Wait a couple of days to a week for her to start her period, if she doesn't buy another test.|`|1B91qtNQaa	There is always a chance of pregnancy when you have sex! If you are not old enough to realize that then you are not old enough to have sex. I don't mean that to be snotty but it's the truth. <br>  <br>  Her being stressed about missing her period could also being causing the delay.|`|4KDDFobnaa	If you used a condom and it didn't break, and she took a pregnancy test and it was negative, she isn't pregnant. A lot of things can cause a period to be late, such as stress. No worries, I'm sure it will come soon.<br>  <br>  <br>  Good luck.|`|ACjPwIc1aa	WELL WHEN U NEVER HAD SEX BEFORE UR PERIOD CAN GET MESSED UP FOR A WHILE! SAME THING HAPPENED TO ME THE FIRST TIME IT WAS AROUND 2 WEEKS LATER BUT WELL IF U WANT TO MAKE SURE TELL HER TO TAKE A BLOOD TEST THAT ALWAYS BETTER!!!! OR JUST WAIT A WEEK N SEE WHATS UP<br>  <br>  HOPE I HELPED!!!|`|aa3AmAHZaa	i really doubt she is pregnant...... <br>  <br>  just relax, if you make her anxious it could delay her period.<br>  <br>  also its a bit early to for the pregnancy test to work accurately.|`|eG6tjXp8aa	dont worry. womens periods arn't always regular. if your really really worried take another one to be sure. ive been weeks late before or not had one some months so its really nothing to worry about :)<br>  just breath|`|sj3BK68Waa	Some girls can have late periods but if it doesnt come within the second week from when its due get another test there not always right or you could get another one sooner|`|uRqm4Bxcaa	Chances are pretty low, but you'd better have her take a test anyways.  Have her get on bc too, man.  A kid will change your life in ways you'll never comprehend.|`|Ztgxd5Jiaa	wait for a week and let her take the test. then if your thinking about do it another time. check with her first no living in the moment thing ok.|`|ITOBWVakaa	Your girlfriend shouldn't be pregnant.<br>  <br>  I'm pretty sure I used a condom that night...|`|3twUwEEWaa	u bang anything that moves dont u?  u're responsible bro now u might have a bastard child...|`|AmghCxQ3aa	the chances are probaby that you have KNOCKED HER UP, dude what were you thinking how old was she??|`|9OpNX6rCaa	i'd say just calm down and wait.<br>  and take another pregnancy test|`|v7WCry37aa	wait a few more week then take the test and visit the doctors...|`|Y6jOPMboaa	Yea she could.|`|5nfqY9T7aa	Four days isn't that abnormal for periods to be late.  Just give it some more time, and I'm sure you'll find out!  Since you had safe sex I'd say the chances are low.|`|AA11763588	It would take about 2.5 weeks for hormones to build up and POSSIBLY give you a positive result, better to wait 4 weeks.<br>  <br>  It could be from stress or just having sex for the first time. <br>  <br>  You'll just have to wait it out.|`|5GL2eFhyaa	If it didnt break she is probably late because of the trauma to her vagina. I mean by having sex for the first time, it hurts and its probably still 'recovering'<br>  <br>  Not saying you were too hard<br>  <br>  Oh and pregnancy tests dont show up until a few weeks in, so its going to show up negative anyway at this point in time|`|9X09kM4oaa	Do not panic, wait 2 more weeks. Sometimes periods are thrown off by hormones- and her not being a virgin anymore may have messed up her hormones. Just be patient. I do not think she is pregnant, but you never know. The chances are slim though....|`|1awiFO6paa	it is normal for her not to get her her period yet<br>  <br>  and theere is a still small tiny tiny chance she might  there is always a chance<br>  <br>  but i doubt it|`|0i4sNq2waa	Don't panic just yet. Wait a couple more days.|`|FZ80qm3Eaa	If you used a condom then she's probably not pregnant, but there's always a chance.  Every time you have sex, no matter what birth control you use, there's always a chance.  Those pregnancy tests are inconclusive so you may want to get her a doctor's appointment.  But it's probably nothing.  Periods fluctuate a lot.  They don't arrive perfectly on schedule every time.  Mine have been really weird lately.  I've been getting them like only every two months.  If she still doesn't get her period for a while, she may want to get herself checked out.  But, like I said, it's probably nothing.|`|UTgz8yNnaa	dude calm down i was suposed to get mine last week too and it did not come yet if you used a condem your probrolly fine. dont worry so much the pregnency test said she was not pregnent so chill for a little and then have her take one on sunday or monday.  you most probrolly fine.<br>  <br>  <br>  I ASURE YOU THERE WILL BE NO BABY COMING!!!|`|SDKwVtuMaa	there is a possibility, man....there is a possibility|`|5MFBoWSAaa	Sometimes periods come late, that's all.|`|831a7af670f2985636729db688219516aa	I'd say no . . . not enough time has gone by to worry . . .|`|q34vCB3Qaa	very slim|`|K1GYtYryaa	dude you are wicked screwed|`|bb3299947b02635429d1636917fa08aeaa	First of all she is probably late.<br>  <br>  Second BEFORE you have sex again, Before she has sex again know that CONDOMS break, and are put on wrong, or late ECT ECT.<br>  <br>  YOU CAN STILL GET PREGNANT using "protection".<br>  Slim but it happens!  <br>  <br>     Facts about Fertility<br>  <br>  <br>  Ovulation (the release of one or more eggs from an ovary) occurs within a 24 hour period and only once during a menstrual cycle. <br>  <br>  Day 1 of menstrual bleeding is the first day of the cycle.<br>  <br>  The time interval from day 1 to ovulation may vary.<br>  <br>  The time interval from ovulation until menstruation is about 2 weeks.<br>  <br>  Ovulation will occur early in a short cycle and later in a long cycle.<br>  <br>  Observing the cervical mucus symptom gives information about being potentially fertile or infertile on a day by day basis.<br>  <br>  The fertility and infertility patterns ahead of ovulation vary from woman to woman.<br>  <br>  Once released from the ovary, the ovum (egg) lives for 12-24 hours, unless fertilised.<br>  <br>  Sperm cells need suitable cervical mucus to survive and reach the ovum in the Fallopian tube.<br>  <br>  Sperm cells may live for 3-5 days in suitable cervical mucus.

pR4nLjyRaa	Yes its normal. I'm 8 weeks preg. also and the past couple weeks I have not had much of an appetite, I've actually been losing weight because I'm not eating much. <br>  Just make sure you're taking your prenatals. Soon enough you'll be wanting all the food you can get! :)|`|hYRYO5GYaa	yea its normal, if you start especally if you have morning sickness, i remember i would be hungry one second then i just didn't want anything.|`|t4Ud4ySDaa	being hungry and the cravings come and go. Honestly I slept my first 12 weeks of pregnancy.... you will gain your appetite back|`|471ca0c8552c4633e525815ba702310aaa	We're you able to have your stomach removed as a cure for "morning sickness"? If so, LUCKY! I wish I could have that done.<br>  <br>  On a serious note it's normal food aversions, even if it's all food. Just remember to take your prenatals and eat what ever you can stomach, even if it's just crackers. If this continues into your 2nd trimester bring it up with your doctor/midwife.|`|6L9jJnchaa	I couldn't eat at all from weeks 6 to week 14, so everyone is different.

tDyNwGdcaa	I am of two minds about this. on one hand 10 is such a young age!<br>  <br>  on the other if her parents are tattoo artists then she would be brought up in that culture and see her family and family friends have these pretty pictures and want one for herself.<br>  <br>  as stated in the topic it is a small little star which is harmless. frankly i'd be more worried if the child got a tattoo of a skull and crossbones.. or a dagger or a naked lady.<br>  <br>  a tiny little star with both parental and child consent is not a big deal. i'm sure that it wasn't a spur of the moment thing at all and they probably listened to her beg and plead for one for a long time leading up to it.<br>  <br>  my sister who i raised (is now 17) wanted a tattoo at the age of 10 and that tattoo she is getting next year is the same attoo she wanted back then. so just because i child is young doesn't mean that their wants or beliefs are transient.|`|gkUOBRj4aa	The thing is that a ten year old child could do rash things that they might regret later on in life. It is a small tattoo and sounds cute, but a lot of people may feel disgusted by the permanent ink on themselves. It's a terrible process to remove it, so...Also, neither the ink nor the laser is good for a child that young's skin.<br>  <br>  How do you feel about this?|`|jHmF9Ak1aa	10 is too young and tattoos are too permanent. Piercing the ears is completely different, the holes will close up. I don't think it is so much about the pain, if the girl really wanted it she probably was somewhat prepared for the pain. It is just that she may have a different idea in the future.|`|J4hOL3oLaa	Tats are more permanent and should be an individuals decision to receive one. 10 yrs old is way too young. I do know a child that young too who has a tat. I disagree with it 100%. I have several tats and my kids love them...but I would never allow them to get one til they are 18 and old enough to make their own decisions.|`|LwbwMFX9aa	because ink is permanent unless you go thru the painful process of getting it removed<br>  <br>  I think you are not being truthful, every state has laws, and if you arent fibbing, sounds like your friend is trash for inkng his daughter, tatoos hurt, most kids cry when they get shots|`|1B91qtNQaa	I think that her parents are not very responsible. She is not old enough to make that decision and as her parents they should have told her she had to wait until she was 18 and mature enough to make that decision about permanently doing something to her body.|`|h4IWXPNoaa	Tis the way of the world now.  Parents not parenting, letting children influence decision making because its easier that way.  This has to break some kind of child abuse law even if one isnt clearly defined. this is awful IMO.|`|949517353a847c7e512b934758a0b451aa	there is a big difference but i dont think you are lyin about the law some states do allow minors to get tattoos with parents consent but i think she is too young for that|`|AA10920990	A 10 year old isn't old enough to consent to anything.|`|AA11473256	those parents are dumb, i hope that tattoo ends up looking like crap when she is fully grown|`|sp1x3ZUAaa	My view is, she is 10 years old.... while she might not make the 'right' decisions, she can think for herself - and I don't think her parents would've given her a tattoo if she didn't want one, or if she was very scared of any pain.<br>  I am pretty sure she won't want to get rid of it any time soon, if she doesn't like it she can cover it up somehow or get it removed (though that's painful)<br>  I do not think it is in any way child abuse or wrong if the child consented to getting a tat.<br>  <br>  Maybe some people on here are being a little bit too strict/nosy abou this? Sorry guys, but whats with thumbing down non-offensive opinions because they dont mind the tattoo?|`|EtCRnDJMaa	Nobody's business.  He's the tattoo artist.  If his not coming home drunk off his a$$ & beating her or having her involved in child pornography, then what's the problem???   Are you going to go and take the girl to have it lasered off, then you would be arrested for abusing the girl, not him.  <br>  <br>  Mind your own business or go find some other parent who is really abusive to their children|`|ZcrsqMbcaa	sure ..a 10 yr old SAT through a tattoo..thats really believeable|`|wZAeBisbaa	10 is pretty young, but on the other hand, I don't think it will cause any harm.  A small star is not likely to embarrass her later, and it's not really offensive. Her parents are allowing her freedom of expression that she may possibly regret later, but it is not irreversible. I would think there many more serious cases to worry about when it comes to child abuse.|`|AA12080472	u can take an earring out of your ear if you no longer want earrings.  the wholes are barely noticeable when not wearing earrings.  tattos on the other  hand is a different story.  its permanent and will get distorted into odd shapes as the child ages.   <br>  <br>  however, its their kid and their decisions.|`|AA10307482	The Parents are an outward and visible sign of the poor Education system in the USA.|`|T3BXC8qXaa	Totally trashy and totally immature (on the part of the parents).|`|qYZ2QFlbaa	well.... hmm.... The only harm I really see is that tattoos often become a bit of an addiction with some people..... also, I can only imagine what kind of tattoo I'd have gotten at that age, a ninja turtle.... man, I'm glad my parents didn't let me get a tattoo as a kid :) It may not be illegal in your state, but it is poor judgment on the part of the parents IMO.|`|tkkYIdIvaa	Tattooing is stupid for a ten year old. Piercing your baby's ears is cruel.<br>  To me it is so heart breaking to walk in the mall and see a hole get stuck completely through a baby's ear so you could put jewels on the ear, it's selfish in my point of View. I was talking to my friend about her baby's ear being pierced and she said "Janie wants her ears pierced." Oh of course Allyson, your 7 month old baby said "Hey mommy I want you to stick a needle through my ear and put an earring in it please!" What a looser.|`|LAsYy7C8aa	i guess its between the father and daughter, it will be special thing for them to remember years down the road.  and it may curb her behaviour down the road.  she won't want the tattoos and peircings so bad then.  I don't agree with it and I wouldn't allow my 10 year old daughter to get one but it was their decision.  As long as its tasteful  its fine|`|Icbz7tdiaa	i think it was a bad idea<br>  seriously<br>  and about ears being periced <br>  im 10 almost 11<br>  im female<br>  and i have 2 holes in EACH EAR!<br>  i think as long as the child is OK with it and all its fine<br>  i got my 1st hole at 11 months<br>  but my mom only did that because she wanted me to get them done young so i wont endure pain<br>  i got my second hole like 4 weeks ago<br>  it didnt hurt<br>  and even if a parent pushed a child in the shop hitting them saying "UR GETTING UR EARS DONE IF U LIKE IT OR NOT YOUNG LADY!!!!!!!" the kiand still not wear earrings or as soon as they pierce them take them out so they close up|`|jvW3a5GYaa	I feel it's none of my business how other people choose to raise their kids. As far as my kids go - I don't have a problem with tattoos but I think 10 is way too young to make a permanent decision like that.|`|DMhAPurkaa	oh my goodness!<br>  <br>  It s permanent!<br>  <br>  I guess she can have it lazered out later...<br>    <br>  not my flavor of ice cream , thank you...|`|qTVkydt1aa	I think that's terrible.  She'll probably regret this in just a few years.|`|jCy0J2ueaa	this is not good!
9X09kM4oaa	You will have a vaginal exam, and they will talk to you about your family history. And more than likely they'll schedule you to have a ultrasound to check the estimated delivery date =)|`|QYYWBrG7aa	at my first obgyn appointment the only thing that was done is i had to do some paper work,blood.height,weight,blood pressure,and urine sample..and then at my next appointment she done the pap smear.BTW i was only 9 weeks when i had all this done|`|OBn4a7rzaa	they will take your weight, blood pressure, and urine sample (they will do this at every appt) and they will probably try to hear your babys heart beat with the doppler, which they should also start doing every appt. Other than that, its quick and easy. They will ask you if you are having any problems, or questions, and if so, they will talk to you about it. And thats it!
1ezYfkX7aa	It could be braxton hicks contractions and at this point your baby is probably very low and causing some discomfort to you. If you dont feel ok i would call your doctor, wont hurt to ask and get checked out. The worst thing is you will be sent home. Goodluck =)|`|GR07LyyTaa	id call the dr sounds like you are goin into pre-labor.. you need to get checked out asap to see!!!|`|AOVlNkbTaa	It could be the baby's head engaging.  If you are really concerned you should ring labour ward and speak to midwife, they will be only too happy to help.|`|gaWZ79gNaa	call your doctor :)<br>  <br>  NOW!<br>  <br>  if something doesnt feel right usually you are right and if you arent then better safe than sorry!|`|DTUOvJm0aa	use your mommy-intuition. if it doesn't feel right, phone your dr. go with your inuition|`|ME62Mtv4aa	call Dr. and they will know what to ask you and if it's worth going in or not.|`|W5DqkUCiaa	vomit alot|`|QyzBu3eiaa	take some tylenol but contact your doctor just to be safe<br>  you can never be TOO safe when you are pregnant|`|pYvkB0Heaa	it could be a few things but in all reality... you should have called your doctor and not sit here on yahoo for answers from people who can't give you the right answer.  call your doctor right now and tell them.<br>  <br>  you can start to go in early labor, which is ok because you are far along enough for a healthy baby.  the baby could just be rotating.  they can do that up until the doctor tells you to push.  you could have a mix of baby rotation and gas but then you have the pressure.  so you can be going into early labor.  umm, yeah call your doctor right now and ask for an ultrasound.<br>  <br>  worst case... the fetus is dead and your body is trying to expell it out.  sadly, i had a patient who was due in 5 days and came in because she felt the baby move and then she didn't and then she said..oh i think i felt it this morning move from one end to another.  so after trying to hear the baby's heart and they didn't hear it... they called me in to do an ultrasound to see if the baby was healthy and most importantly alive.  um, it was a mess and so difficult to tell where everything was.... the baby had been dead in her body for a good amount of time.  i say at least over a week.  <br>  <br>  so, call your doc (RIGHT NOW...right now...right now) just to see how things are in there and request for an ultrasound to make sure everything still looks great in there.<br>  <br>  I am sure you will be ok.
wZAeBisbaa	Show them a specific plan for how you will get your work done and stay up to date on what is being covered in your classes.  If your teachers approve and are willing to be flexible, the "can't miss school" objection doesn't really stand up. Point out that since you are a straight A student, you obviously have some organizational and independent study skills.   Explain how hiking can be educational - at the least you should learn something about the area you will be hiking through.  But if those arguments don't work, there may not be much you can do.  Your parents don't need a reason to say no.  They can do it because they are your parents.|`|45nSn7Rcaa	No there isn't.  You need to respect your parents decision.<br>  That doesn't mean if you were my child that I would make the same decision, but you aren't my child, you are theirs...respect them and accept it.|`|prqrQcd1aa	If your parents are that strict then it's going to be quite impossible to get them to allow you to go..sorry, i had to say it. Maybe your aunt and uncle will see this and go hiking when you don't have school.. that way you can go too!|`|BRT2teSqaa	Save it for spring or summer break.  You get plenty of time off school.  No parent should allow a child to miss a week of school for a vacation.|`|Lkik9Sr7aa	make a deal with them that if u do good on a test or something then u can go or get ur aunt or uncle to convince them.<br>  u could also take the easy way out and say that u want more bonding time with ur aunt and uncle|`|F6lZHRkVaa	Talk to your teachers about it first. See if they would be willing to give you homework and assignments ahead of time. They will most likely be very happy to help you out. And then tell your parents what your teachers say. Good luck!
1RwZZ2aPaa	A 13 year old keeping a baby?<br>  No way.<br>  <br>  She might say she won't have a hard time paying for that baby but she's going to get a wake-up call soon enough.<br>  <br>  Babies aren't easy to take care of. Especially At 13 she's gonna to have breakdowns all the time. What if she takes it out on the baby?<br>  <br>  Adoption.|`|dn2tsXlBaa	ya thats really gross to be pregnant at that age. wait until ur married!!!!!|`|jkDbDjcRaa	It's totally up to her.<br>  If money isn't an issue, she still needs to consider other things, like will she be able to stay at home with the baby?  Will she be able to finish school?  Will she be mature enough to take care of the baby, or will she have to rely on her parents for help?<br>  <br>  There are many things to consider.<br>  She should talk to a counsellor or doctor for more info and advice.|`|X3QBqLSHaa	Just wondering why are you asking this? Haha it's her business and you shouldn't try to talk her into anything she doesn't wanna do. I think she should give it up for adoption cause she's only 13 and probably doesn't know much about raising a kid. ANd it would be kinda rude to just make her parents take care of the kid while she;s at school and stuff.|`|1lE3FLqOaa	that is an obvious answer for me..i am against abortion so i would say she should def have the baby. she took the chance on getting pregnant when she decided to have sex....so she should be responsible and take care of her child. tho she is 13 and it is a bit ridiculous still she made that decision.<br>  <br>  adoption is another option..just not abortion...|`|Bcfw1rweaa	oh lordy.<br>  <br>  just pray for that girl...<br>  <br>  that's all you can do.|`|FFv8i4aYaa	Even though that she is 13 you still have to take responsibility she needs to keep the baby because abortion is awful and that is killing someone. what if you never got a chance to be born because your mom decided to go kill you cuz she didn't want you cuz she  was too young.... keep the baby and think about adoption|`|XIdDqwVVaa	she should put education first and not having unprotected sex. In these hard times we're facing , education and a good job is important. Not sitting at home all day and producing offsprings you cant take care of. Thats why half of the teens you see out there are on welfare , once they get on welfare they become to lazy to get off their butt and work.|`|D6Xfc5Wtaa	I say she should have the baby, but give it up for adoption. She is only 13 for pete's sake!

G0QugnQ8aa	Is it safe to sleep on my back during pregnancy?<br>  <br>  Expert Answers<br>  Catherine Lynch, ob-gyn, director of the division of general obstetrics and gynecology, University of South Florida, Tampa<br>  <br>  Once you get to the third trimester of pregnancy, I don't recommend lying flat on your back for any prolonged period of time. When you lie on your back, the increased weight of your uterus presses on the major vein that returns blood from your legs to your heart.<br>  <br>  Of course, when you're sleeping you can't control what position you're in. If you wake up on your back, it's probably because your body was telling you to shift your position.<br>  <br>  I recommend sleeping at an angle, tilted slightly to one side or the other. You can put a pillow between your legs to make that position more comfortable.<br>  Russell Turk, ob-gyn and founder of the Riverside Obstetrics & Gynecology in Riverside, CT<br>  <br>  If you typically sleep on your back, it's safe to continue doing so through the first trimester. But as the uterus gets heavier in the second trimester, it's best to choose another position.<br>  <br>  When you lie on your back, your uterus presses on the vein that returns blood from your lower body to your heart. Lying on your back for an extended period of time could interfere with the flow of blood and nutrients to the placenta and your developing baby.<br>  <br>  This is potentially unsafe, particularly if you have a condition like high blood pressure that affects how much oxygen and nutrients the baby is getting. If you have such a condition, your doctor will advise you to sleep on your side.<br>  <br>  Don't be alarmed if you go to sleep on your side and wake up flat on your back. It happens all the time and shouldn't have any serious adverse effect on your baby's health.<br>  <br>  Nonetheless, try to train yourself to sleep on your side or sitting propped up. If you need to, place a pillow between your legs, under your hip, or behind your back to make your sleep position more comfortable.<br>  Post your own answer<br>  Community Answers<br>  <br>  At my last appointment a couple of weeks ago I was around 21 weeks. My husband and I were waiting for the doctor in the room. I decided to lay down on my back while we were waiting for the doctor (I knew that I was not suppose to lay on my back for a long period of time but I thought that it was ok for me to lay on my back for a couple of minutes). When the doctor came in and checked my baby's heartbeat, the heartbeat was slow. He told me to sit up and as soon as I sat up the heartbeat was normal and fast again. He reminded me that I should not lay on my back...for any period of time.<br>  posted 9/28/2007 by Adanna78<br>  <br>  Was this answer helpful?<br>  488 out of 529 found this answer helpful<br>  Thank you!<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  Well i'm now 23 weeks and I was a back sleeper. Now i have gotten use to being on my left side that when I am lying down on any other part of my body I am not comfortable. It is said that being on your left side the blood flow is increased and is well distributed among you and the baby. So i would suggest to you expecting mothers, those in their early trimesters, practice sleeping on your side preferably the left so as to be comfortable when your belly grows. Use pillows as a source of comfort. I sleep with one pillow at my head and another below my breasts and under my abdomen. its comfy to me, hope it helps you guys.<br>  posted 4/08/2008 by Anonymous<br>  <br>  <br>  What's the best sleep position during pregnancy?<br>  <br>  Expert Answers<br>  Jodi Mindell, pediatric sleep expert<br>  <br>  Although there's no real harm in sleeping on your right side, lying on your left side is actually good for you and your baby: It improves the flow of blood and nutrients to the placenta and it helps your kidneys efficiently eliminate waste products and fluids from your body. That, in turn, reduces swelling in your ankles, feet, and hands. If you train yourself to sleep on your left side early on, you'll have an easier time falling asleep when your belly is bulging later.<br>  <br>  During the second half of pregnancy, avoid sleeping on your back, a position that puts the full weight of your uterus on your spine, back muscles, intestines, and the inferior vena cava (the vein that transports blood from your lower body to the heart). Back-sleeping can also put you at risk for backaches and hemorrhoids, inefficient digestion, and impaired breathing and circulation. Lying on your back in the second and third trimester can also cause changes in blood pressure. For some women, it can cause a drop in blood pressure that can make them feel dizzy; for others, it can cause an unwanted increase in blood pressure.<br>  <br>  Post your own answer<br>  Community Answers<br>  <br>  I also sleep on my side and sometimes feel an uncomfortable tugging sensation on my belly. When this happens, I use a thin pillow and place it under my belly. With a thin pillow, I can still feel like I am completely on my side, but my belly is supported. That way, it doesn't feel like there is that same pulling or pressure. This works wonders|`|b978f631fc787a963337206aa3833370aa	Whichever side is most comfortable. LOL<br>  <br>  As long as you're not flat on your back, I don't see how sleeping on either side will do much harm. If you do sleep all night on one side, chances are you'll wake up so numb you won't be able to feel a thing. I know at least that's what happens to me.|`|S4pNsW3Taa	Its on the left side that your suppose to sleep|`|LDYAGJCxaa	Actually, it's the left.  <br>  <br>  "It improves the flow of blood and nutrients to the placenta and it helps your kidneys efficiently eliminate waste products and fluids from your body.

But once you're in your second trimester, you shouldn't sleep on your back.|`|i9M0U9Meaa	the left side because it opens the airways and the baby can breathe easier. but that doesn't mean that your suffocating your baby when you sleep on your right side, its just better for the baby on the left side.|`|eS4CSdQ5aa	left side<br>  it can get uncomfortable sleeping in that position for so long.<br>  <br>  my belly rests on a pillow - pillow between legs as well<br>  <br>  as for this resting thing its easier in the first two trimesters<br>  <br>  good luck!|`|rdpZrBc9aa	Left.|`|WmKjeUELaa	They say the left side is best, but I asked my doctor and they said  either side is fine really.

It suggests you sleep on your left side.|`|itiJVgRsaa	NO......it's the left. trust me.|`|bNeL6Lftaa	it is the left because some how laying the the left give the baby more Oxygen. ask doc. i Always felt more perisher when on right discomfort.

And it didn't hurt her. Your baby is in a well protected water balloon, lots to absorb a shock. I worked in EMS for 4 years and women get into car wrecks and have other traumas a lot and the babies turn out fine. It would have to be a really hard fall to cause any real damage. <br>  But so you'll feel better, call your doctor on Monday and let him know what's up.

Cx5Zo7IIaa	Definitely get the hospital if you can't right away drink half a shot of liquor. It will stop you from going into labor. Before  they had all these different medications for preterm labor, they would actually use a IV of alcohol to arrest labor.|`|uQc4UA2Caa	those are signs of labour so i think it will be anytime between now and the next few days. 34 weeks is a safe time to give birth and if u and baby are ok u will be allowed to take it home as normal, unless it doesnt weigh enough|`|tDyNwGdcaa	Call the midwife on duty at your ante natal hospital and ask their advice.<br>  They will most likely tell you to  come in but calling them first lets them know you are coming and that  there may be some premature complications.<br>  <br>  33. 5 is still very early and is considered premature. don't delay call them now because as said above they are able to either give you medication to stop the labour or prepare for any complications that may arise.<br>  <br>  i wish you the best and hope you have your happy healthy bub in your arms when the time is right!|`|wa3AvezGaa	Have you been visiting a doctor throughout your pregnancy?

Good luck. sounds like some early labor signs to me.|`|04kOtcGgaa	the doctor should have told you what to do in this situation. i'm 33 weeks and 3 days and at my visit the 17th my cervix was soft and dipped into my vagina and he made sure i knew what to do if i start to have blood or any other preterm labor signs. he told me to go to labor and delivery. they can stop it. i think you have a crappy doctor. you and your baby will be fine and the baby will live but it's always better for baby if you carry full term or at least to 36 or 37 weeks. i hope the put you on bed rest. if not then thats not fair to you. i was put on bed rest. good luck and i hope you don't have your baby yet so baby can get the best.

EyKJ737daa	Wow that's scary.  I guess that's why here in Australia the baby is marked with 3 forms of identification.  This is done while the mother is in the room after she has given birth.  They have an arm band, leg band and even something like masking tape on their little backs with their mother's id number and baby's surname.  That one is really sticky and doesn't come off easily.  My baby's had their tags on their backs for about a week after birth when the bath water finally soaked it enough and it came off by itself.  I am stunned to think this isn't practised elsewhere in the world! or is it?!<br>  I have no idea why they would pump a baby's stomach unless that is just what the mother wanted. I actually didn't read that or hear it on the clip though.|`|pXSKSS3daa	It doesn't say anything about a baby's stomach being pumped, sorry.|`|aJLx0nhNaa	No stomach pumping mentioned in article.|`|F8KmTbqjaa	OMG That is horrible!!!!  That would never and has never happened at the hospital I delivered at.  They seriously put on a wrist band on the baby and the mother that are color, number and letter coordinated to each other (& on the Dad if he is present) before they even cut the cord!  That way they know for sure the Mom has her baby.  Pumping the babies stomach is a little out of control unless the other Mom has HIV or some catching disease like you said.  I know a lot of people would disagree with this or think its disgusting, but when my friend had her son she was having a lot of trouble nursing and I had been with my daughter for almost 5 months so I nursed her son once to help him latch!  It totally worked..............he latched on great to her the next time she fed him!  It was the last resort she had and I would not do it fo anybody, but she was desperate to breast feed.|`|vKEYa8aeaa	i think they would do it for extra precaution. if that happened to my baby [was breast fed by a woman with aids] i would want his stomach pumped ASAP.<br>  <br>  <br>  EDIT: ive had my stomach pumped before, its not comfortable but its not like it is the worst thing in the world. people on here are acting like it is some horrible painful procedure....|`|LWXRVO5Haa	The mother probably just pitched a fit and demanded it be done.

It's very possible that the birth mother of the child who has its stomach pumped has severe allergies.

GGH0HVdvaa	I KNOW HOW YOU FEEL. I seem to have the same problem too, mainly whenever I wear close fitting t-shirts. Like at work, part of the uniform is a close fitting t-shirt and I ALWAYS end up with pit stains, even when it's not even hot! I always seem to break a sweat.<br>  <br>  What I do (since deodorant doesn't seem to stop it) is I just try not to wear clothes where the sweat is going to show. I wear more tank tops or dark colored t-shirts. And if it's chilly then I make sure I have a jacket or hoodie with me. It sucks I know. I think it's just something with our body chemistry that makes a person sweat more or less than others. And I'm 22.|`|UrZ8SFpqaa	Hey there,<br>  <br>  I have the EXACT same problem. Eventually I just got so frustrated that I went to the doctor. The doctor diagnosed me with hyper hidrosis (excessive sweating...look it up on a search engine). She told me that I didn't need prescription deodorant but that I should start using a product called Drysol.<br>  <br>  Drysol is about thirty dollars sold at any pharmacy, but it LASTS.

Because when you're nervous you end up sweating at times. When does it occur ? Does it happen before or after exercising ? Does it happen daily or when you're around other people ? If so, then you're just nervous.

It could be many things and many things can be done to treat the sweating. It could be down to hormones creating excess sweating or to malfunctioning sweat glands. Treatments can be a simple course of anti-biotics, creams or for extreme conditions surgery is a possiblity. <br>  <br>  Believe me, your not the only one! Nor should you be embarrassed, now get yourself to the doctor!|`|yGGQdmeXaa	Have you tried the clinical strength deodorant?  If that doesn't work, you can go to the doctor and they will give you a prescription.
Coc593Ikaa	Because there is about 14 days between when you ovulate and your period. Meaning, you can never know if you have become fertile again. You never know if you have already ovulated and just not got your period yet.<br>  <br>  Sure condoms are not as reliable as other methods, but they are better than nothing!<br>  <br>  As for finding out, you'd have to look for symptoms, or you could just test once a month to be sure if you want.|`|GU3RauKOaa	Hmm... that's a good question. I got pregnant while breastfeeding (Yes I knew you could get pregnant while breastfeeding, in fact I was counting on it. It took several months of trying) but I didn't have a period... how do you ovulate without a period?<br>  <br>  Well I just googled it and didn't find out much except that if you start ovulating it will be 2 weeks before your period comes, so you wouldn't even know that you were ovulating and could get pregnant then.|`|DcLiW4bbaa	You can get pregnant without having a period because you ovulate BEFORE the period. So you ovulate, and then 2 weeks later, the blood comes out. If you ovulate for the first time, you wouldn't know it, and you can get pregnant then.<br>  <br>  But condoms should be just fine, that's what I'm using and I haven't had a problem yet. (Knock on wood!)|`|cj7sSPZEaa	You ovulate before you get your period- not the other way around.  Usually, in a typical cycle, you ovulate two weeks before your period.  So when you are breast feeding and you cut back even one feeding a day, you will ovulate.  If you have sex during this time you will get pregnant before your period starts.  Take a test, and if you aren't pregnant, then get on birth control.  There are some that are safe to take while breast feeding.|`|ArDBlPKYaa	The egg comes into the womb waiting to be fertilized *before* menstruation, or period (the bleeding that indicates there was no fertilization).  So, the egg could come into the uterus, be fertilized by intercourse, and become a little baby before you even knew ovulation was back in full swing.  <br>  Because the bleeding happens after the window for fertilization (aka ovulation), you don't know you're pregnant until the bleeding doesn't happen, or the period doesn't come.  if it happens that way and you never have a period, I suppose you just need to get tested to be sure.  This obviously happens, but I think it's pretty rare.<br>  My period came back around 7-8 months, very light at first, and I was still almost exclusively breastfeeding then.

Punishing her now won't do any good, she is already pregnant.  BUT... be stern so she knows that she has to assume responsibility. Let her know that you will be there to teach her and advise her, but that this baby is her job assuming she keeps it rather than opting for adoption, or abortion. Personally, I do not believe in abortion, but that is her decision and she'll have to live with it. Help her to talk to the father's family and see if you guys can come to an agreement of how the child will be raised, provided for, etc. Enroll her in a parenting class for new/teen moms so she doesn't feel she is being judged and can focus on bettering herself for the baby. If it is still early in the pregnancy and she has a job, I suggest she keeps working until the doctor recommends her to stop. This way she has more to contribute.<br>  <br>  Just keep in mind that by now she has realized her mistakes, and she is probably scared and needing you more than ever. Assure her that you still love her. <br>  <br>  Good Luck & God Bless|`|ENYkIOPDaa	Just be there, let her make the decisions<br>  but if she goes to you for help make sure you listen.<br>  Don't try to make her do something she doesn't want to do<br>  (ex. give the baby up for adoption when she wants to keep it or vice versa)|`|pnL5WTXMaa	a little late for that... but adoption is better i suppose than abortion. don't let her be a statistic.|`|QjgxH7Ouaa	Be with her and comfort her.|`|J4hOL3oLaa	I got pregnant when I was 16.

AA10196172	The leakage from the male is often called pre-c*m. Some people talk like it definitely contains sperm, but there's some debate if it does, Mainly it depends - on a lot of things, whether he had an orgasm recently and hasn't washed out the plumbing with a good pee, how excited he got, does his prostate leak, etc.<br>  <br>  I suspect the answer is that only sometimes does it contain sperm. Generally there's only one way to find out if/when it has sperm, and you're working on it.<br>  <br>  If those fluids make contact with your fluids at the entrance to your vagina, then the sperm can get where they have to go by swimming in your fluids. Sperm can live in the uterus for 2 or 3, possibly 5 days waiting for ovulation.<br>  <br>  So what you're up to can maybe cause pregnancy, but it's very long odds - just not impossible.<br>  <br>  Most of the cases I heard of (I talked to an ex-priest who counselled these nice Catholic girls in trouble, long time ago) were from dribbles or spurts from a full orgasm. Get that on your wet opening and enough will swim where they're going to pose a serious risk.<br>  <br>  Also, for future reference... Condoms don't work with this kind of play. Rubbing a condom on dry, unlubricated skin will cause it to tear open very fast. Try to imagine ways to please each other that don't involve genital-to-genital contact.|`|gh5x9nROaa	No sperm usually dies when it hits air.  Unless your pouring it down your vagina it won't get you pregnant.<br>  <br>  <br>  IT;S A SLIMM! CHANCE &&I MEAN SLIM!|`|DTUOvJm0aa	it is possible to get pregnant at any contact near your opening. look at this site, it will tell you all you need to know|`|y8DLyE5raa	This may be what is called "Pre-Ejaculation Sperm"  Sometimes this comes out before the actual ejaculation during sexual intercourse.  It's actually a lot harder to get pregnant than what people think.  But then again, nothing is impossible.  Why don't you wait it out until you get your period, if you don't get it take a pregnancy test.  But also know that if you miss you period, it could also be b/c you're stressing out over this.  Isn't being a woman fun? LOL  Good luck hon!|`|1awiFO6paa	unfortunatley  you can be.... because  sperm could even be in pre-*** and if he was wet it wasprecum ..... so u can<br>  <br>  the only way that u cant be pregnant is if u guys have cloths on well like at least the bottom part  u kno?    <br>  but other than that   there is a small tiny chance|`|AA12127418	no|`|WmKjeUELaa	Without intercourse it is VERY unlikely that you are pregnant.  Of course people will tell you that intercourse is the only way to get pregnant, but we know this isn't true because there have been cases of girls getting pregnant from semen being inserted inside them.  I would say wait it out and see, but I wouldn't worry about it.  And if you want to fool around like that, have him wear a condom, or you go on the pill.|`|AOVlNkbTaa	Sounds like pre *** to me, and it can get you pregnant. Do a test.|`|WYXDA7o5aa	no because its prolly jz saliva if its not sperm|`|w6cyPEIMaa	no. the only way u get pregnant is if cemen goes into your youknow.
AA10196172	There's always the risk of sperm in pre-c*m; not always, but sometimes. Like everything else to do with conception, only time will tell.<br>  <br>  However, keep in mind that some people use "pull-out" for birth control and it usually works (until it doesn't). People using full deposit at the right time trying to conceive sometimes take several months to catch. So the odds that this one time you'll catch are pretty darned low.<br>  <br>  If it happened outside your regular ovulation time (usually about days 10 to 18 are the ones to avoid)  then you're even safer.<br>  <br>  Nothing's 100% though. Get Plan B asap if you can.|`|lTkYWiy5aa	There's always Plan B.|`|C42zVqrSaa	You can get pregnant from pre ***.  It all depends where you are in your fertility cycle as to how likely you are to be pregnant.  You chances are probably pretty good that your not.  But you are exposed to some risk.|`|uBGFJr1taa	you can get pregnant from a guy c*ming close to you. theres always that chance.

PFO1jxZGaa	Make sure you boil them at least 2 minutes. I would boil them after two uses at this point since he is sick, once he gets better once every two or so weeks<br>  You notice when they start to get worn out and they will get to it lot faster when you boil them a lot. Once they do just change them and boil the new ones before use. If you boil them once a day then maybe as fast as within a week or two, depends on the nipple. Rubber goes faster than silicone. But onse its cloudy, or sticky when dry its time to change them <br>  I would boil mine before first use and then once every two or three weeks and  I replaced mine every 3 or so months.<br>  <br>  edit. If you boil them for the two or so minutes it kills all the bacteria so theres no need to buy new ones unti lthey wear out( if you are concerned about the trush coming back etc)|`|Mr6U1TiHaa	buy new nipples?? i never heard of that, you can get silicone implants..  keep boiling them??/ girl, are you crazy. how can you handle that, it burns. how good nipples are good for?? ummm an entire life i guess, if you have a husband.  Lmao..im just kidding sweetheart.. u should boild the nipples twice a week, you can also boil the bottles...better if you buy a pot just for that.  also they sell bottle sterilizer where u put the bottles and nipples in there and put it on the microwave..plus, my son had trush and i always boil his bottles..so i guess trush just happens sometimes...and to that girl who respondes saying that you need to noil them EVERYDAY..its obvious that she donesnt have anythingbetter to do..who boils a nipple everyday?? that's just crazy|`|OrKpKxkHaa	You are supposed to sterilize the nipples, bottles and rings after each use. Either by boiling (for at least 2 minutes), in the dishwasher, or with a microwave sterilizer. Hope you dont get offended but that might be why your baby got sick to begin with. I hope your little boy feels better! Good luck!|`|080iXsSfaa	i commend you for going through such pain to keep your baby from getting thrush again.  i cant imagine how bad boiling your nipples hurts, but i think it takes a dedicated mother to do this.  my mother never boiled her nipples, and i got thrush several times.  as far as how many times you need to boil them, i would say at least once per day would be sufficient.  hope this helps.|`|QIDhVAjjaa	hope he gets better.  I don't think you should have to buy new ones I think you can boil them for a long time.  I would only buy a new one if it rips or looks contaminated or something like that.|`|CVxdveTcaa	i boiled the nipples as soon as they got dirty..for the frist two weeks..then i would boil the nipples every couple of months after that then around 6 months i brought new ones|`|aJLx0nhNaa	Just my personal opinion - if he's had both thrush and rsv on the same batch of nipples I'd probably toss them and start over.|`|1ezYfkX7aa	Well if the baby didnt have thrush and rsv i would only boil them once when i got them and just wash them really good after each use. But sinse hes been very sick i would boil them every few days...no need to do it everyday.
FfGHHhqBaa	i think you should do what is best for your child in your eyes not someone else, i don't give my kids sweets all the time, maby once or twice a week but my sis in laws kids have candy 24/7 her son had to have surgery because his teeth were so bad.|`|V0QZyGlraa	I think you are on the right track for fruits and yogurts for desserts, because it is much more healthy for the kids, yet it is good for satisfying sweet teeth. What I do with my kids is they get a choice on fruits to make fruit smoothies that we keep in the refrigerator in a lemonade pitcher and use it throughout the week for after-meal treats. We normally stay away from sugary sweets except for special occasions. <br>  Anyway, it's all up to you and what you think is right. You are definitely teaching your kids a good example in moderation by keeping the dessert choices healthy, and limiting the sweets is just what you should be doing. God bless.|`|bYUdtQZsaa	I agree with previous people. If you let your child view sweets as treats or something special, they are going to prefer them to healthier snacks. A lot of children only get dessert items if they are good and things like that. It teaches them to want those things and becomes a big issue later on.|`|kSEO2w8Aaa	I have read that always giving you child sweet things after a meal teaches them that it is more desireable and therefore setting the wrong example.. my family never had desert after dinner and now I am an adult and have no real sweet tooth..|`|RpwYzQvEaa	For our daughter, I always have her eat something healthy first and then after that allow her to have chocolate or whatever she wants in very limited amounts.  Set limits.  As long as they are eating healthy meals during the day, a little treat won't hurt!! =)  It works well for our daughter.|`|REfpF8G6aa	I don't think it's a good idea. Stuff like that should be a treat, besides that sounds unhealthy. If she thinks it's fine then ok, but if you think you should try "healthy" treats.|`|EMKuBql8aa	I think you are on the right track personally. Follow your gut and what feels good to you. Anyways, people don't need candy, it's not even good for you, but fruit is nutritious and yummy.<br>  <br>  EDIT: Have you ever heard the saying a DR is the worst patient? Well, same thing applies to her probably, lol.|`|QIDhVAjjaa	your child can have candy everyday just make sure your not giving them big hershybars and cake for every meal because that will make them sick and have vomiting.  if you arent comfortable with giving your kid that much chocolate then thats okay to it is your kid suckers are also good.
1ezYfkX7aa	They will do your weight and blood pressure, get a urine sample, do a breast exam and pap smear....some may do an u/s right there or send you out for one....give you paperwork to get blood work done..give you an estimated due date and answer any questions you may have.|`|zSABr7praa	They may do an ultra sound, however I had to wait and schedule one for a couple weeks later.  They'll do LOTS of blood work, a pap smear, and get some medical history.  Write down all the questions you may have, they are there to answer your questions!  Also, you may not meet the doctor, you might just meet with the nurse.<br>  Best of luck and congrats!|`|ArDBlPKYaa	I didn't go until 14 weeks.  I did go to a doctor at a hospital, but I asked for a minimal approach to everything - the least invasive with little meds.<br>  Anyway, at 14 weeks, the first thing the doctor did is ask a million questions (of course), and then listened for a heartbeat.  Every visit, you have to pee in a cup and get your blood pressure tested.  I got an ultrasound at 18 weeks, mostly to make sure they weren't twins since they run in the family. <br>  For me, every visit was the same - talking, then heartbeat listening - until around 28 weeks when they want to do a lot of tests.  Then around 32, you go in every two weeks, then every week around 36 weeks.  <br>  Hope that helps!|`|WmKjeUELaa	Its about a 3-4 hour appt.  They will more than likely give you a pap smear and do all of your blood work at this visit.  They will weigh you and take your blood pressure (which will happen at every appt.) You should also be allowed to hear the baby's heartbeat, although sometimes it is hard to find, so just relax and try not to move or talk.  They won't do an ultrasound more than likely since its too early to see anything.  They will probably go ahead and get all your medical history, so its good if the dad goes with you as well, if possible, because they will need his as well.  As far as questions to ask, that is pretty much up to you.  Just ask about anything you want to know and pick up a couple of books like "what to expect when you're expecting" and "your pregnancy week to week"  These are the books I read and they help me out sometimes when I am in between appointments and want to know something.  <br>  Best of luck to you!!!  =)|`|y38cvIn9aa	You'll be asked lots about health history, they will give you a pelvic exam and do a pap smear. She will do a boob test, like your regular yearly exam. And they may take blood, they will take urine. Do all those sorts of tests. You won't have an ultrasound on the first visit. You may not have one until 20 weeks, just depends on your doctor, on your insurance and what they need it for. <br>  Ask what to do and not to do. Some foods aren't safe, some activities aren't safe. Ask about anything you're scared of!|`|1jwbQaZTaa	they probably wont do an u/s, maybe schedule one though. they'll go over a huge list of medical history (yours and the dad's), draw your blood and test your urine. they may try the dopplar to see if they can get a heartbeat and if there is an ultrasound machine in the office they may do a vaginal ultrasound (basically an enourmous dildo with a camera on the end, lol) . but if they keep the u/s equipment in a seperate office like some docs do, you may need to wait till your next appt. good luck!!!!|`|QyzBu3eiaa	most likely you won't have an ultrasound done on the first visit<br>  you should ask what kinds of symptoms are normal when you are pregnant...etc.<br>  but prenancy books are really great for those things.<br>  the doctor will answer probably all of the questions you are wondering especially if this is your first
aJLx0nhNaa	Having a newborn is one of the most stressful things you can do as a couple.  When our son was newborn both me and my husband were very sensitive.  I once burst into tears because he realigned the tabs on a diaper I'd put on.<br>  <br>  Sleep deprivation does terrible things to people and at 3 weeks post partum you are not at your best emotionally or physically.  It does get better, I promise.<br>  <br>  My only advice is to try to not let things get out of proportion.  Don't make rash decisions (ie. "I'm leaving this asshole!") right now.  Take some time to talk to each other.

It probably wouldn't hurt to get away for a few hours so you can both recoup from each other a bit.|`|t0mb150gaa	Having a baby can be a very stressful time,and being new parents only adds to the stress. Arguing and fighting is only going to build on that stress and is not good for the baby to be around,they can sense everything going on around them. Just take a step back and realize this is going to be a tough time for both of you so do your best to work together and enjoy the joys of being a parent. Do not make any rash decisions under these kind of circumstances because you both may regret it later on and it truly sounds like you love him and want to make this work..maybe you should try telling him that! also you could try to ask a family member to babysit for an evening so you can go out to dinner with him to rekindle the relationship you had before and discuss what is going on.|`|ME62Mtv4aa	Seriously maybe you guys need a little time apart this is NOT a healthy environment for a newborn to be around, think of baby first also you can't deal with that kind of pressure right now either you need to have a straight head being in charge of something so fragile. You both are really young and a baby is a BIG adjustment so maybe taking some time away will help clear both of your heads and you can go from there.|`|e6Kyqb22aa	Just tell him. but be sneaky about it....like don't go yelling at him.

Do yourself a favor even if that's what you don't want go to your parents for help.  Don't take any insults from any man.  Remember that no one can do to you what you don't allow them  to do. You were brave enough to have this baby at 19 be brave enough to get rid of someone who is getting in the way of that baby's well being and happiness.  Don't cry don't let him bring down your self esteem.  If you don't have parents to help you there are lots of shelters for single moms and their baby's that can help you get your life on track.  Do not ever take abuse|`|GNLYxY7kaa	hey there...just be strong girl! having a baby is so stressful...the sleepless nights...the responsibility....the diapers and feedings and cleaning. that alone will stress you out. your boyfriend is probably 'grumpy' because of the new change in yalls life. my husband and i had a rough first three months with our son. our baby was very colicky and high needs and both my husband and i were exhausted. we got into many arguements and snapped at each other a lot, but now here we are seven months later and things are so much better. our son is not as high needs and we are sleeping more, getting more time to ourselves..ect. things WILL get better. and trust me, you need the extra help!!! being a single mom might be worse than dealing with arguments here and there. im sure it will work out.|`|OrKpKxkHaa	Its hard to be parents at 19! I was a mom at 18 and her dad was 19. If you arent ready for it (most arent), it cant hit you like a ton of bricks. You are still on a rollercoaster of emotions from your hormones being out of whack. He is probably in shock. Maybe he is trying to get you to leave.  It sounds sad but maybe he just doesnt want to be the jerk who left his baby and if it can be someway turned around on you....it will look much better on him. I dont know if this is the case. Maybe its just a rough patch and you guys need some time to adjust to your new roles as parents. I hope everything works out for your family, but dont beat yourself up if it doesnt. Move on and just realize that you got a beautiful baby out of it. You are still young, dont stick around just because you are scared....you deserve happiness and so does your baby! Good luck!|`|CVxdveTcaa	me and my boyfriend had our baby and i am 16 and hes was 18...it was hard but we new that sometimes there is alot of stress on new parents...my boyfriend would do something wrong and i would snap at him its just a normal thing a guy has to be understanding to a girls needs after a baby cuz of the wild hormones but the girl has to be uunderstanding of his needs too|`|EIJm83Psaa	All i can say is talk to him about it. It could be the stress of havin a new born. That what happen with me and my bf. He could just be scared and worried. Cause you both are new at it. But talk to him. and keep your head up things do get better.|`|ncWigo1Laa	He has no right to make you feel worthless. Try staying with family for a few weeks and bring the baby over to visit every day so you can both have some time apart. A new baby is stressful on every one, but there is no excuse for him to yell at you. Mabey him and his parents could watch the baby for a few hours so he can see what its like(and you can have a break). If nothing works move out and get your own place. Stay on good terms with him, as he is your babys father, meaning you have to be in contact with him for atleast the next 18 years, but do not allow him to mistreat you in any way infront of the baby because it will think thats-and its not.<br>  hope this helps.|`|Jswomud7aa	Think about the reasons why he is acting like this. If you haven't done anything wrong than it's probably NOT you. He is just venting his frustration on you which isn't the appropriate outlet obviously. BUT if you can figure out why he would be acting this way then YOU can try to do something about it. If he's stressed because he realizes now he's not a kid anymore and has REAL responsibilities then you can sit down and brainstorm. Come up with a financial plan for your lives and for your baby, set 5 year and 10 year goals (it goes by fast, trust me, and the goals really help you stay on track).<br>  <br>  I doubt that you are the problem. Talk to him in an UN-emotional manner and really try to problem-solve. You obviously can't continue being verbally abused and need to let him know that while you will be there for him through this tough time, if he continues to treat you like a door matt you won't be around for long.|`|pXSKSS3daa	Having a baby can change EVERYTHING when it comes to a relationship, no matter how long you were together beforehand. Maybe you two weren't really ready for a baby but he/she is here now and you need to find a way to make things work.<br>  <br>  Have you told him about how you feel(him making you feel worthless and stupid)? Have you asked why it seems as if you two are fighting all the time? You're new parents and it's overwhelming but you CAN work things out together. <br>  <br>  If you need to, and are able to, take a break. Pack up yourself and your baby and go to a family member's or friend's house.

I would definitely think about going on the pill to help regulate things in the future and think about making an appointment with your doctor in the next couple of weeks and if you get your period just cancel it if you dont want to get on the pill.  don't panic!  ?
H6uYThgjaa	if you had unprotected sex, there is a chance. the pregnancy test works by detecting the hormone hGC (i think that's the one) which is produced upon implantation of the fertilized egg. so, if you did the test too soon, i.e. right after your unprotected sex, a test would have been negative.<br>  take another test.|`|NCvX4I0baa	Throwing up in the morning is a myth.

I'm guessing you had unprotected sex to be thinking you are pregnant. Well protect your self!<br>  <br>  Symptoms you've described aren't necessarily pregnancy symptoms. But check it out cause you never know.|`|rdpZrBc9aa	You tested WAY too early.  Test next week when your period is due.
AA11763588	ANYTIME you have unprotected sex you are at risk to get pregnant.<br>  <br>  If it was just last night then you can get her Plan B from a pharmacy. You have to be 18 to purchase it though. It has to be taken within 72 hours of unprotected sex, but if the sperm already met up with the egg then it won't stop it, just so you know.<br>  <br>  It doesn't matter if it was her first time or her 100th time. It only takes 1 time.<br>  <br>  In the future wrap it up or go to Planned Parenthood and get her on the pill.|`|AA11865529	Go to a drug store and get plan B, or as someone else suggested, contact a local birth control clinic like planned parenthood.

However, not all pharmacies stock it so call ahead.  <br>  Plan B is about $50.00 or so.  <br>  There are ways to use contraceptive pills as emergency contraception however it is not nearly as effective as Plan B.<br>  For information on the dosage of contraceptive pills as emergency contraception:<br>  <a href="http://ec.princeton.edu/questions/dose.html" rel="nofollow">http://ec.princeton.edu/questions/dose.h...</a>|`|4KDDFobnaa	Never have unprotected sex, unless you're able to handle the possible consequences. My advice would be to get the morning after pill. It's good for 5 days after unprotected sex. Or you could get plan b, which is good for 3 days after unprotected sex. Good luck.|`|yMZHhOYgaa	it does depend on ovulation a little bit and your telling me she was a virgin well highly probably that she might be im no expert i would Just wait now and have protected sex from now on abortion is possible but im not one that likes abortion take her to docs if she misses next period|`|gccK6q20aa	yes their is a chance as long as semen comes in contact with the vagina. Get her on birth control 9 the the pill or shot) and always use a condom. that is the best way to make sure a un wanted pregnancy does not happen. that or no sex. but you knew that already :)|`|04kOtcGgaa	she can take Plan B.
AA10144812	R u breast feeding? Sometimes that could cause the problems. when I was breastfeeding I had the same problem. But if the pain is really bad call your doctor as soon as possible, and make sure nothing is wrong

Acne is more of a sign of PMS rather than pregnancy.<br>  <br>  Don't stress out, wait another week then if you don't get your period take a test.|`|tDyNwGdcaa	i would say it is something else.<br>  <br>  I'd actually say that your period is due now and that is what is causing the outbreak of acne :)<br>  <br>  good luck and if in 2 weeks you still haven't got your period i'd take a HPT (hormone pregnancy test) just to be sure.<br>  <br>  however the fact that your period is not late and that you have used protection while having sex leads me to believe you just have a shockingly bad hormone flush before your period.|`|7zMtmKJaaa	dont you need like a week more til your period comes?<br>  if it doesnt come by next week take a test. if it comes out negative, to be extra suuree take another test a few days after.|`|86DNwJESaa	well.. if your a teenager still  i would maybe just consider it teenage days with sucky acne..  and if you think you have been being safe too  its more likey your not pregnant then you are.|`|9X09kM4oaa	buy a pregnancy test to make sure. all the stuff you maybe experiencing may just be only hormonal changes.

Take a test 2 weeks after you had sex which would be..around the 25 of februrary.<br>  <br>  btw it is not spelt pregnante - pregnant.|`|4WgsBvq1aa	i'd say because you couldnn't get to the store on time that it's possible your body's a little bit messed up and may be thinking about when to give you your menstrual cycle, therefore the pms signs like bloating, ovulation, try not to stress but buy a test and have a read about it, just incase.<br>  best of luck|`|SQMMOeqnaa	you could be pregnant. all you can do for right now is wait until the time comes for your next period and see what happens, although i recommend going to your doctor and telling him your situation. hope it works out.|`|8cd6d1064a8d6379febc6914e867a26baa	Always a chance.<br>  Wait, see if you miss your period, then take a test.<br>  Or go to a doctor..<br>  Its all you could do.|`|jkDbDjcRaa	You could be pregnant.|`|4KDDFobnaa	Most people ovulate around 14 days after their period ends, so if it was 2 days after your period ended, I would say you probably weren't ovulating. You may be feeling sick and bloated from your period ending. I would wait and see and take a test. Remember to always take your birth control at the same time, because if you take it even a few hours apart, it is bad. You need to take it at the same time everyday. Good luck.|`|yOr4SOO4aa	i don't think so, it would be a rare case... but wait until your period comes.|`|8C1C9szXaa	U SHOULDN'T OF HAD IT IN THE FIRST PLACE BUT UR MISTAKE NOT MINE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

BNCpLcLoaa	You may find that as the pregnancy goes on you feel closer to the baby. I am 15 weeks pregnant now, and although I was trying for a baby, when I found out I was pregnant I freaked and just pretended it wasn't happening, even though its my second. I think you may find that when you go for the scans and you see your baby there, you'll soon start to feel a bond.<br>  <br>  Its a hard thing to get your head around and alot of changing to do, but raising a child isn't as hard as it sounds, you just need to be there for your child. Parenthood isn't as big and scary as people make out.<br>  <br>  Hope this helps.<br>  <br>  Chin up :)<br>  <br>  (UPDATE)<br>  <br>  I don't think people here are being very fair. Yes there has been a mistake but it happens, at least he is being honest about it and trying to get help. Isn't that better than running away or putting his head in the sand? There are millions of great dads that paniced when they found out there was a baby on the way. Its natural to fear what you don't understand and the unknown.|`|hTieELhTaa	well there is not really much to be said if you are already going to be a dad. At least now you can understand why people say dont have sex untill your old enough or mature enough. They really mean wait till you can see and understand the whole picture and understand the consequenses of choosing to not use a condom and protect yourself. There isnt much that can be done now but to start growing up and get ready for your child. There are easy ways out I suppose if its ok for you and your gf to murder your own flesh and blood before it has a chance to live. I would suggest looking into adoption and start talking to your gf and finding out what she wants. Odds are you better get ready to be a dad or pay child support for the next 18 years.|`|8cd6d1064a8d6379febc6914e867a26baa	When people say, "Use a condom." They are serious.<br>  <br>  Trust me, we dont want any more teens running around here complaining about their pregnant girlfriends, or being pregnant. Thats the only thing you could do next time.<br>  Should have thought about it before you had sex with her, huh?<br>  <br>  If you dont want to be a father, good luck with child support.<br>  <br>  <br>  Edit:<br>  So you ****'ed your friend, got her knocked up, and now leaving her with a baby that shes going to have to raise all by itself WITHOUT a dad.|`|4WgsBvq1aa	you dont seem 25<br>  seeing as your in the adolesent section :S<br>  as well as you say your going to be a   dad,<br>  so what use would condoms have now?<br>  you're old enough to know better and be immature<br>  geeze.|`|w9TzZCt8aa	i dont get the question if you dont want to use a condom ask the girl to go on the pill|`|VWcmRuahaa	hey u got more than a million ways. dude u can have sex during her periods(that realy does work).h|`|yOr4SOO4aa	Tell your girl to take the pill|`|jkDbDjcRaa	Question doesn't make sense.<br>  <br>  Dont have sex?|`|c2415d71b96d211b01cd85ea7ebe2899aa	The only thing I can say is<br>  help her make the decision on keeping it or not<br>  and please please please stick with her.<br>  You have no idea how hard being a single mom is esp. if you are still in high school.<br>  she probably doesn't want the responsibility either but unlike you, <br>  she is stuck with it.<br>  I won't tell you crap about teens and sex (im 15 and sexually active)<br>  but I didn't get my period once and I freaked out and was so scared when I wasn't sure if my boyfriend would be there for me.<br>  good luck.|`|dq16ybzgaa	All you can do is take responsibility for your actions and be the best dad you can. You don't 'want' to be a dad but we all have to do things we don't 'want' to. Good luck|`|Tq6R4DN3aa	sex it comes with responsibilities .i think u must be a man and stand on your actions .it's you how bring the child and it must be you how must maintain it|`|AA10920990	At 25 you should be smart enough not to get a woman pregnant. And what's wrong with using a condom?|`|wnkoTEqVaa	well using a condom wont help you now.|`|Osn1xpu6aa	I think it's time you start reading some parenting books, picking out some baby names, knitting some onesies, buying some stuffed animals for you new child.<br>  <br>  the time for condoms is long gone.|`|Eg1G2mvVaa	There is nothing you can do about it.  It takes two to make a baby, but once it is made it is out of your hands.  No contraception is 100% effective, so when you chose to have sex, you also chose the possibility of having children.  All you can do now is learn to live with it - and do not tell the mother how you feel, it won't help anyone.|`|QGP930C6aa	sorry bout that. it sounds like a really sad thing to say but maybe once you see your child your fall in love with it. i guess if your not with the girl then you can choose to have as big or as little part in the kids life as you want (as long as you help out financially or something).<br>  <br>  But, things might change when you hold the baby for the first time. So good luck and i hope this helped :)|`|laLW1Krwaa	The condom only works in the moment not after the moment|`|C8Djjxqkaa	Once you are going to be a dad condoms are ineffective.
weadibPeaa	you're not taking this very seriously if you forget to take the plan b pill lol|`|IA5zVfk0aa	i hate to tell you this, but my friend forgot to take the second one until hours later and she got pregnant :/ the first pill is just have the dosage|`|jcXSNjowaa	its not as effective. take the second one as soon as you can.<br>  <br>  I took the morning after pill on january 7th (day 12 of my cycle, 2 days before ovulation).. i took BOTH pills (the best way to do it)... i took them both at the same time AN HOUR after having sex...i am now 8 weeks pregnant.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>   TAKE THE SECOND ONE NOW.. thats the best way to do it...even though.. it didnt work for me.
W1p6LetFaa	It's probably just her raging pregnancy hormones and all of her self-doubts coming out.  She needs YOU more than ever right now!  It is PERFECTLY normal for a first-time mom to be frightened about these things.  I know I am all the time!  She just needs encouragement from you.  Tell her how much you love her and how much you love this baby, and because of this, there is NO WAY she will be a bad mother.  Be a mom is a learning process, she will get the hang of it.  Just be there for her and calm her fears as best as you can.  She will probably go through this repeatedly, but just hang in there... It's those crazy hormones talking!!  Make sure she knows how much you love her and how great you think she will be at motherhood!  (Ps.  Random flowers for no reason can always help!)  :-)<br>  <br>  Best wishes to you, Laura, and your little one!|`|tBx1M0g9aa	just confort her and tell her how wonderful she is<br>  heres someyhing that i remind myself<br>  <br>  <br>  We may speak diffrent languages<br>  We come from diffrent cultures<br>  But no matter who you are or where you are even what the situation is<br>  You are not responsible for your past<br>  But you are responsible for your future<br>  <br>  tell her this and say you will be a good mom because of who  you are now not becuz of your past|`|19JRf8Cxaa	It's just the hormones. She will get over it a couple of weeks after the baby is born. Reassure her that you will help her get through any hard times with the baby and that the baby will always love her. (And you)|`|5Eg8dpnMaa	Laura is just scared because she wants a better life for her child than the life she has as a child. She will be a great mother, she's just getting more scared because she's getting closer to the arrival of your new bundle of joy. <br>  <br>  Once she becomes a mother, all the doubts she's ever had will go away and she will do anything she can for that baby.<br>  <br>  You just have to hang in there and reassure her that everything will be okay.|`|LmvWzsKZaa	the answer is you,,, you should tell her that there is nothing to worry about,, she is a nurse and that evidance of how great she is treating other people,, then how the kid from her blood and flesh <br>  <br>  just assure her that you are with her,,, you are going to be there ,, nothing to be afraid of... she need to have intimacy from you now sooo badly ,,, so don't draw back my friend<br>  <br>  good loook|`|ZSSUfSXwaa	Facing with the realitis of being a mom one comes very much in contact with her own childhood and the role model she had. Many of us have had bad experiences or not the best childhoods, I pray every day I dont become my mother... seriously. And I have a very good friend of mine whose mother was verbally abusive to her and an alcoholic.. amongs other things... however she is a wonderful mom, not just a good one, or an OK one.. an AMAZING MOM! Me? Well I cant say that, but I consider myself to be a good mom, or at least I try very hard to be one. <br>  You need to tell your fiancee that now she has a chance of righting all the wrongs she had in her life, she had a bad childhood, but she isnt her mother and now she can do things differently!! At least she will know what NOT to do! <br>  And Child Services wont take your child away.... just get her to relax, and maybe even to a doctor, fears of being a bad parent are very common in first time moms.<br>  Just tell her, that your baby will be soo loved by you and by her...and it's not like once you become a mom you're in automatic pilot and will do everything your mother/parents do... not at all!! You're still in control of your own life.. so you need to tell her that...the same way she's in control of her life now... she didnt follow the path of her parents.. why does she think she will now?<br>  And as for parenting, is hard, and babies dont come with a manual!! LOL but listening to your child's needs is the best thing you can do... feed him when he's hungry-not after 3 hours or 4.. place him to sleep when he's tired... and follow his cues... your baby will tell you .. by crying most of the time LOL but it's such a wonderful thing.<br>  <br>  Your fiancee's hormones are also all over the place so she's more sensitive and vulnerable... so try and talk to her.. if you think her situation is worsening or not improving please dont hesitate to talk to your doctor!! <br>  <br>  Blessings to you and your family and good luck!|`|4scMHGGvaa	I would just talk to her. Tell her you love her even though she already knows. Tell her that god can get her through this and being a mom is going to be an amazing experience. She will have her ups and downs, she will see how much fun it was and how she would do it all over again. A baby is a gift from god and he will help her through it.
QR7OMouXaa	ummm....<br>  he's gonna die<br>  <br>  yeah.....<br>  you should PROBABLY do something<br>  probably|`|aJLx0nhNaa	Just call.  I called my doctor after my son's shots for much, much less than this.  <br>  <br>  Even if they say it's nothing, they will tell you what signs to look for.  And they will write in his medical record what shot he reacted to.|`|jkDbDjcRaa	Um, I would take him to the hospital to get checked out...just to be sure.  He may be having a bad reaction to the shots.|`|cWP73qEsaa	it is very normal. keep giving him infant tylenol (or whatever u liek to give him for pain and fever) also cold lil towels on the area relieves them and vickx vapor rub, those are the home remedies i use and try not to let him come in contact with anything there (like dont lay him flat on his belly for awhile so his legs have time to heal after the vaccine. hope i helped =0)|`|1d96f37d161f5b36db2cdf3bb334c59caa	Put a cool washcloth on his legs. My daughter had the same and I got really scared but she said that it didn't hurt. It's probably nothing but you might still want to call the doctor just to be on the safe side.|`|PW3hcVZiaa	Warm compresses and encouraging him to move his legs will help.|`|d8a746804766b70bab5d2cadd408c158aa	If you are concerned call your Pediatrician. He may run a fever for a few days and his legs might be sore for a few more days. Give him a warm bath and try and bring down his fever. I'm sure he will be feeling better soon. I'm NO doctor just a mother of three.|`|DSZTruuqaa	ALWAYS call the doctor.  Worth it no matter what.  If money is a problem, call the pharmacist first.
AA10196172	Sometimes tests read negative because they can't detect lower levels of hGC (pregnancy hormone). Sometimes women don't always produce enough, especially at first. But if they detect enough to read "Positive" you are.<br>  <br>  Congrats!|`|W1p6LetFaa	False positives are extremely rare.  Even rarer are TWO false positives.  You are definitely pregnant!|`|W4J7Ary0aa	You can get false positives but also false negatives. I couldn't believe I was pregnant until I had about 4 positive tests. But I am 18 and who would not freak if they missed a period at my age. Now my fiancee and I are just waiting on our baby girl to decide she wants to come out.|`|rdpZrBc9aa	You're pregnant, sweetie.  The only reasons you would get a false positive are if you have been pregnant recently or are taking certain fertility medications.<br>  <br>  Congratulations!|`|5Eg8dpnMaa	Hun you are definitely pregnant. That's exactly the same thing that happened to me when I found out I was pregnant with my daughter.
vygYFdsSaa	I had an ultrasound at 10 weeks. They'll probably do one. Congratulations!!|`|53QQ9KXEaa	I went to my first appointment at 13 weeks and my first ultrasound was scheduled the following week.|`|BMfn0D9gaa	my 1st appt was when i was 11 wks and they did an ultrasound and told me my due date!|`|SQMMOeqnaa	they may do an ultrasound...14 wks is kinda a long time to wait to be seeing a doctor honey, but i understand that situation...they will check everything to make sure that the baby is ok, they will do a doppler to check the heartbeat and measure your stomach. they will do a pee test and may do a blood test. i hope you are already taking prenatal vitamins, if you dont mind me asking? thats a very important thing to remember..this first appointment is very exciting bc you will hear the heartbeat...good luck girl|`|HYrs7qzBaa	THEY WILL CHECK YOU .. GIVE YOU A PREGANCY TEST .. MEASURE YOU .. TAKE BLOOD .. CHECK BLOOD PRESSURE .. PROCK YOUR FINGER .. WEIGH YOU .. FEEL YOUR BELLY SEE WHERE THE BABY IS AT ..  CHECK YOUR INSIDE .. THAT'S  IT I THINK ....|`|BnpEoMD4aa	They usually do an ultrasound around 18 to 20 weeks. That's when they can detect the sex of the baby.|`|g9vw4ovGaa	Depends on the doctor, if they feel that you're gaining a good amount of weight and the heart beat sounds good, the probably wont. I didn't have my first ultrasound til i was around 25 weeks, when they can tell the sex of the baby and most of the organs are really starting to develop, Alot of doctors want to make sure its not two or three, but you can tell that by the heart beat or beats. Expect a pap smear and quite a bit of blood work!
aJLx0nhNaa	Babies want to chew on everything. As adults, it's our job to take away from them things that might potentially hurt them and replace it with something safe to chew on.  Paper is not safe to chew on for all the reasons other people have said. You are right, they are wrong.|`|7rCeCVl2aa	It's a choking hazard! You are not wrong at all.|`|xBd96wvRaa	Inks and colored papers, as well as the dioxins usually found in them can lead to long term health effects.<br>  <br>  My personal instincts say no don't let him eat it. <br>  But you are not in the position to dictate that.<br>  <br>  What I would do in your shoes is actually call a pediatrician and ask if eating paper can harm the baby. If the doc says it is ok, then it is. If not you have a professional opinion to rely. <br>  <br>  Some parents boggle me - as parents we stress over every breath yet some will allow their children to eat paper..<br>  <br>  Maybe point out the FDA allows X amount of bugs in our potato chips, what exactly do they think the regulation on paper is? <br>  <br>  Go figure. <br>  <br>  I found this advice column answer:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.drspock.com/faq/0,1511,10626,00.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.drspock.com/faq/0,1511,10626,...</a>|`|vKEYa8aeaa	definatly not. there are chemicals in paper. chances are it wont hurt her[the chemicals] any but none the less its really gross. on top of that she could get a paper cut or choke on it because it could get all clumped up in her mouth.... why wont they just get her a teething toy???|`|jkDbDjcRaa	She should NOT be chewing on paper!<br>  She could choke on it, or cut the inside of her mouth.<br>  <br>  I don't know how you can get them to stop letting this happen, but you definately have to figure something out.|`|jCy0J2ueaa	tell them to stop making excuses for being lazy a** and take the paper from the baby. and if they don't then shove some paper in their mouths!|`|SQMMOeqnaa	no, paper is one of the most unsafe things...babies can choke on it as when paper gets wet and tears off...tell them to find something else for her to teethe on, like a  baby teether for instance|`|ME62Mtv4aa	NO I wouldn't say its safe theres chemicals all over it but you can't say much when it's their child.|`|DSZTruuqaa	No not safe!<br>  1.  Toxins in paper, chemicals they are made with, etc.<br>  2.  choke on pieces that come off.<br>  3.  Germs from people who have touched paper.|`|bGCscBlbaa	no
IX9znFLAaa	A very, very small chance.  There's a possibility the sperm slid into the vagina.|`|YXL0jneEaa	If you sincerely don't know the answer to that...you shouldn't be having sex in the first place|`|SQMMOeqnaa	only if the "stuff" drips to their vagina|`|a6e7SRYzaa	Yes you are right! That was a stupid question|`|471ca0c8552c4633e525815ba702310aaa	Yes, it is a dumb question. Unless the woman has a fistula leading to her vagina, or semen flows out of her butt and into her vagina, she can not get pregnant from "releasing" in her butt.|`|53QQ9KXEaa	If it seeps down into her vagina, she could end up pregnant... Odds aren't that great I don't think, but yeah, it's possible.

Ready - this is who bored i am :  From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia  Ho Hos    Ho Hos are cylindrical, frosted, cream-filled cakes that are made by the Hostess company and are distributed in the United States and Egypt. The Interstate Bakeries Corporation owns the Hostess company. These chocolate cream filled cakes have a pinwheel design. Ho Hos were first made in 1967, when a San Francisco bakery began making "Swiss-filled" chocolate cakes coated with chocolate. A nut-covered version, "Nutty Ho Hos," was introduced in 1999.[1] "Caramel Ho Hos" were introduced in February 2004.[2] The name is a play on "Hostess" and the sound of laughter.    A Ding Dong is a chocolate snack cake sold in the United States under the Hostess brand name, which is owned by Interstate Bakeries Corporation. The snack was originally known in the Eastern United States as a King Dong and later a King Don. In some areas it was marketed as a Big Wheel.    The chocolate cake is round with a flat top and bottom, similar in shape to a hockey puck. It is about two inches in diameter and a little more than an inch high. A white cream filling is injected into the center, and a thin coating of chocolate glaze covers the entire cake. The cake was originally wrapped in a square of thick aluminum foil, enabling it to be carried in lunches without melting the chocolate glaze.|`|GZdvHbT5aa	A ho-ho is the same thing as a swiss cake roll (a circular chocolate cake with creme in the middle, and then hard chocolate on the outside)    And I think a ding dong is just a chocolate cake the shape of a cupcake with icing in the middle.|`|4c7QomPoaa	The shape.  They both taste like crap.

I like June Olivia Bell because it just rolls.|`|jy52NZEjaa	June Liliana Bell      sounds so beautiful, graceful, and classy.|`|UYAhesuvaa	Ellizabeth or Olivia  ..please not bug :P|`|2c26d8fc94ce0e90f359f38553c9f608aa	June JINGLE bell.|`|5391432c598af97eb451cfd80531a5e3aa	June Olivia Bell|`|0abc7b6c3865e21018ce64c64d0ea018aa	June Esmerelda Bell|`|UrcheOECaa	June Elizabeth flows nice together!!!|`|hv10quoPaa	June Renee|`|Wx7Jrwf8aa	anita souns the best with the rest of the name but i qute lk olivia aswell|`|iyRf0UJsaa	june olivia bell|`|KjGWUlKKaa	I like June Elizabeth Bell or June Bug Bell(:|`|fXj2kVpPaa	Are you having a baby?

You've got a short name on front and back, so a long name in the middle would be good.  Mackenzie is a confident sounding name, plus when she gets in trouble it's the best sounding one when you have to yell her name across the house!  ; )  Try it out!|`|b7CNWZgTaa	I am certain that June " Renee ", is a name that flows nicely when you say it..

June Liliana is very pretty, and the names flow well together. I also like June Olivia.
yCwPxulYaa	ALL THE TIME.  I will start getting sarcastic and impatient.  Thats when I know that it is time for me to get off and go to bed.  <br>  <br>  HAHA its that "TIME".  Goodnight!|`|04dc0d2596b5e8336fe567281e72fb2faa	I totally get it! I didn't used to be that way, but I am just starting menopause, they call it peri-menopause.

5b3cd64667a391942de231867c44d64caa	My daughter was asleep in the bassinet - I went to say something to DF who was outside having a ciggy and the door closed. The second the door closed, she woke up and started crying. We had to smash through a glass door (all with the neighbours looking) - it took about 10 minutes to get back in. I felt so bad but hey, it was an accident - same with you. <br>  <br>  You're the mum - anything another person thinks isn't relevant, no matter who they are. You know you're a good mum so that's all that should matter.<br>  <br>  PS Another time our daughter fell off the bed. I told people because it was interesting but they were all like 'oh you have to be more careful...' as if I couldn't work that out myself!|`|CFN67QnRaa	Its okay...everyone makes mistakes and now you have learned an important lesson. You learn as you go. Love your baby and always strive to be your best. Your baby will thrive with that love. Always put your child's safety first.Good luck!!!|`|En9gIC3Zaa	im a teen mom also, and stuff happens. its not a big deal. The main thing is that he was ok and he didnt get hurt. No they are not going to come because you closed the door and it locked. So dont worrie. Your fine, hes fine and mothers of teen mothers are always in a bad mood. lol its ok just be glad u did something and got to him before there was time for anything to happen.|`|J3yUXKiyaa	Relax.  All of us moms will, at one point, lock ourselves out of the house or the car with the kids in it (or they'll lock it for us), or lose them at a store or the mall...or something like it.  <br>  <br>  Anyone who says 'oh, I'll never do that, I'm very cautious' is in for a shock when it does happen...you called for help immediately - so you did the right thing.  <br>  <br>  Don't beat yourself up.|`|KQU5y20waa	you did nothing wrong. im sure you didnt mean to. tell youe mom.....that if you thought you did such a bad thing...then why did you call  the cops. dont make to many mistakes though......give your baby extra hugs and kiss....=)..... and keep your head up.....i heard alot more horrible stories on here then that|`|KUxEBQuYaa	its not like you left him alone in a hot car. he was inside, nice and warm in his swing. safe.i locked myself out of my apartment while my son was in his crib. i had to go to the office to get them to let me back in. he was fine sleeping away. stuff happens. be cool and relax. its not like you would have taken him outside in that weather.|`|MeYILJeSaa	This could have happened to anyone, not just a teen mom. While you probably shouldn't have left your baby inside, I still think you're beating yourself up too much. Parenting is a learning experience, and all parents mess up. This will just teach you to be more careful in the future. Go give your baby kisses now. You're his very favorite person, he loves you. :) You sound like a good mommy, otherwise I don't think you would be this upset.|`|SxgOy9uPaa	Don't know about reassuring advice..Think you should get babies Dad to park on a hill,so you don't have to go outside,with him..6 months not real old you know,could stop breathing if head rolls forward & he cant get it back,needs his Mom a lot more than his Dad..Make the father wait until your Parents @ home,for whatever he wants..That way no problem for baby..Good luck with everything..Guess the "SS" are gonna come a calling,make sure your in the right space..Suggestion,please don't get angry here..Maybe take up some home schooling,like English..Maybe learn to grow things outside,help Parents with fresh food etc,if you get to like this,might even get to doing,homemade pickle's,which everbody will enjoy way more than store bought think about it???Will show your serious about yours & babies life..The jolly best of luck to you & yours..Stay well & above all take care & enjoy..|`|pGbjjnWcaa	Take a deep breath.  I locked my son in the car once (stupid automatic door locks!) and had to call my husband at work to come home to get him out.  I am sure you will be extra careful from now on.  Nothing you can do to change it now.  And most important, your son is ok!|`|aJLx0nhNaa	Okay, take a deep breath.  When my son was a newborn it was actually one of my biggest fears that I would lock myself out of the house while taking out the garbage or getting the mail.  This did not happen because you are a teen mom, this really is something that could happen to anyone.<br>  <br>  You did the right thing by calling the cops.  However, you do need to be extremely careful in the future.  As a teen mother I expect that the police would be much, much more likely to call child services on you in the future.  I'm not saying they would be right, I'm just saying I think they would be more likely to.<br>  <br>  Make a copy of your front door key, get a tiny dog clip and hook it to the belt loop of your jeans any time you step out for any reason.|`|7rCeCVl2aa	As parents we all make mistakes. Even like this. Save yourself the trouble and just kick the door in next time. It'll save you the hassle of the social services visits you are going to be getting now.<br>  <br>  I don't think I would have waited. I would have kicked the door in. A locked door between me and my baby? Not a good thing.<br>  <br>  <br>  **Edit** Being that you are teen mom (This makes you a target) You probably will get a visit if the police got involved.|`|Cx5Zo7IIaa	Sounds like you've had a bad is all. Sh!t happens, try to relax.|`|8f6fff32b0caffa89ef6b762f487ae26aa	This happened to me once and I had to call the landlord. Luckily I just put the baby to sleep in the crib and the landlord came in like 5 minutes.  I was so panicky and scared because the baby was inside and its just a habit closing the door behind you, I know.  But after that experience, I ALWAYS MADE SURE I CARRIED AN EXTRA SET OF KEYS WITH ME. Just in case! :)<br>  <br>  Dont worry, everything will be fine and tell your mom to stop being so hard on you, that everyone makes mistakes.  If it were me, I would just save and be on my own. Always carry another set of keys and keep emergency stuff on just in case.  You never know ok.  They will not call DSS. That was not neglect or harm. It was an accident.  It happens. Huggs. :)|`|SjX72fPyaa	I actually did something similar once. While my boyfriend was at work, I ran outside quickly while my daughter was napping to take the garbage out and forgot my keys and my cell phone inside so I couldn't get back into my building or even call anyone. I usually keep my keys in my coat pocket but I was doing laundry that day so they were sitting on the table next to my door! Luckily for me though about a minute of complete panic after I realized I was locked out someone came walking out the door so I got back inside almost immediately. <br>  But I think every mum is gonna have one of those moments or something similar eventually. But you do learn from it. Now whenever I take the garbage out I check my pocket to make sure my keys are in there before I leave, even when my boyfriends home lol.|`|h59Bc4wfaa	I did this one time when I was baby sitting my friends baby. She was about 6 months old and sleeping in her swing. Well my apartment was right above my friend's and I ran upstairs to get something. I even took the monitor with me. That's how I knew she was awake and crying. I go back down to find the door locked! <br>  <br>  My heart has never beat that fast ever! Luckily I was able to climb my big butt through the front window....but the people across the street called the police and told them I was a burglar, lol. Lord, I learned my lesson. <br>  <br>  Just chalk it up as a lesson learned.
9a3sNrEqaa	I would go to the drs hun! B/c u just had a D&C n you will want to make sure that your HCG levels are doubling and its a healthy pregnancy. I would guess you would be about 5 weeks since you ovulated late. Trust me go to the drs. I thought after getting the positive HPT that everything was cupcakes and candy but its a struggle. Just hang in there! Get to the drs so that they can make sure everything is going smoothly for you!!!! |`|liVa8foFaa	well I think that depends on whether your hcg levels went back down after the dnc. i am not sure if that happens right after you have that procedure
c4e0f4398cbb2577d252628c76d0781baa	I didn't have a c-section BUT I am now 7 months PP and my periods are alot heavier than they were previous to getting pregnant.  I have severe dysmenorrhea (VERY painful cramping during period) but I have noticed that I don't have it now.  I do have cramping but NOTHING like it was before.  I had to take Darvocet and Naproxin with my periods before b/c they were SO painful, the pain would even radiate all down my legs, I couldn't walk, or even think about working.  I have since had about 6 periods and have not had to take a Darvocet once, only Motrin. <br>  <br>  I have always heard that your period pains were better after having a baby, and it proves to be true with me, or at least so far.  Also I even have to wear a pad with my tampon in the begining b/c I bleed so heavily...I never had to do this before. (sorry if tmi lol).  <br>  <br>  Hopefully that will make you feel better, but you can always talk to your gyno about it for even further peace of mind.  Good luck girl!|`|50lIaC8zaa	My first few of periods after having my daughter were really heavy, well alot heavier than what i would call a normal period for me. Its probably just your body getting back to normal i wouldn't worry too much unless you start to feel dizzy or anything like that or if it seems to be staying very heavy for a long time.|`|33c0b6060f319b3537f5ec8348f23f45aa	Your body is trying to get back to normal. Plus it is still healing from the pregnancy. I am sure that you are bleeding more when you are up and moving around alot. You need to just take it easy for a while. You should be back to normal after 6-8 weeks of giving birth. But you can always go in for an exam if you are that worried about it.|`|be8738c7b3a936fc2e865b3f0e6ad7d4aa	I am going to agree with DMG on this one. My first post partum period was *awful*. I was so afraid that every period was going to be that way. I had to get giant pads! <br>  <br>  Definitely talk to your doctor about this but my guess is that its just a rough period and your next ones will be better :) <br>  <br>  Good Luck!|`|ME62Mtv4aa	after baby alot of things change with periods some gets better some gets worse if you are truely that worried call a dr. and speak with them.|`|g9vw4ovGaa	My first period after my daughter was HORRIBLE!! More than likely you're still getting some of that stuff out. I would still call the doctor just incase, but just for tonight, I think you will be ok. My first period, I would spot kinda then all the suddon after standing up all the suddon or moving, i would feel a gush and it would stop for a few hours. I didn't call the doctor, but after about 4 days of that, it stopped and I had a normal period. As long as you don't pass clots the size of a quarter, is all that i can remember you need to go to the ER about. Call the ER advice nurse, most hospitals have em|`|Zz9NJlETaa	Well I am 6 weeks postpartum.  I stopped bleeding 3 1/2 weeks ago and got my period a week ago.  The first 2 days mine was brownish looking and barely none at all.  Then when I thought I was over it and in came a rush and I've been bleeding quite a lot since, soaking pads and all.  It's going away again now that I've been a week with it.  Seeing how both of us are experiencing the same thing, I'd say it's normal.  I wouldn't worry about anything unless you are in pain down there.  Everything seems normal and on track.  I hope this makes you feel better seeing how we are both going through it together....:)|`|dpig5odPaa	Had the same thing, c section and all. My doc said that's normal. It was scary though b/c blood seemed to just pour out of me. As long as you are not having large blood clots you should be fine, but just to be safe check with your doctor in the morning.|`|3Se5nlJtaa	I don't believe that you should be bleeding this much. You might actually call the hospital and ask them if this is something that is normal. They might have you come in right away because this does not sound normal. Thinking about you!!|`|aJLx0nhNaa	My first post partum period was a complete nightmare. As bad as my lochia bleeding at times (I had a c-section.) Talk to the doctor, but really, it's pretty normal.
bqCk3lEWaa	I think that if she's able to walk or even run, it's definitley time for serious "time-outs".  I say this because the weather is starting to warm up, and once my 15-month old gets outside, she likes to test out her new skills and wants to run.<br>  I'm scared that if she doesn't respond to my stern "No!" around the house now, that this summer she won't respond to me.  If she takes off for the street or something, I want to make sure that she KNOWS that "No!" means business, and it startles her enough to make her stop.<br>  It's nice and all to want to "teach" and not "scare", but when you're talking about a toddler wanting to play and run away from you, they need to know when you're not kidding around.<br>  <br>  We're going to start time outs now in the playpen (which is in the office) and start with 1-minute timeouts if she continues disobeying after one warning. <br>  <br>  They are smart enough to start testing you at this age.  I know the difference between innocent exploring (redirection is appropriate) and total defiance (timeout).|`|Hx6K5AqGaa	<a href="http://youranswers.andrewbolam.co.uk" rel="nofollow">http://youranswers.andrewbolam.co.uk</a><br>  A very informative website, kindly stay in website and check|`|fXzed3fLaa	No not too early. The playpen idea is great but make sure you take the toys out first.  You also dont want her to associate the playpen with bad.|`|gN9sEAmnaa	spank her. she's testing you. so spank her butt|`|tQVBDx5Paa	I think she is too young for time outs.  Most ppl are anti spanking, but we tap Emma on the hand for most things and will spank her bottom for major things (which like a once a week occurence).  Sometimes I will tell her after a spanking to go sit down and that seems to be very upseting to her..<br>  <br>  If you use the playpen for this discipline you'll never be able to use if for anything else b/c she'll associate it with punishment.|`|WlU3NFu6aa	Well you already know I do it with Shayden. At this age, i think they are kinda playing but also know what gets a reaction out of you. IDK if they mean to be "bad" but they do know that it gets a good reaction out of you so they keep doing it. You can try a one minute time out or whenever she's acting up put her in there and let her calm down. Chances are if you put her in and ignore her, like literally walk away and go on with your business, the fit sill stop shortly. At least is does when I put Shay in her playpen . I have even just put her down on the floor (or let her throw herself down) and walked away. I think if we dont acknowledge the tantrum, they will stop cause lets face it, why do it if no one reacts to it. <br>  Also I am totally against spanking at this age. Maybe later but right now its jsut teaching her to hit.<br>  <br>  ETA~ oh lately its been hard to take stuff away from her. And yelling no doesnt work. Last night I asked her nicely a few times to give the object to me and what do you know. she came over and handed it to me. It was met with lots of thank yous and good girl's and she was happy and there was no yelling or crying cause mommy took something away.<br>  IDK if you have that problem but your girl and my girl seem to be going thru the same thing. the onry ones. hehe :-)|`|1hciyvKdaa	Yes gently removing her immediatly with no big toodoo about it, and let her cry for a small time and then try doing the same thing again or something else. They do learn to push our buttons!! They are born to be taught, its not always fun either!!|`|RwoN3E9Uaa	She's way too young.  IMHO I think time outs are not effective.  No matter the age of the kid they aren't sitting there thinking about "what they did".  They just know mommy separated them and is ignoring them.  <br>  <br>  All that you describe is pretty normal toddler behavior, not her attitude.|`|tecPZUq2aa	Well If They Are Old Enough To Misbehave Then They Are Old Enough To Learn How To Face The Consequences. <br>  <br>  Good Luck X|`|Ccs9LeIEaa	john and kate (of john and kate plus 8) use a time out mat. Its this tiny rug that says time out on it... and they've been using it forever. <br>  I dont think its too early for her to have time outs. Just explain that thats not how we act and give her time to collect herself.  <br>  <br>  If you dont think that time outs will work at this point, then you can try ignoring her bad behavior and reinforcing good behavior (you can do verbal praise or, if you are out or something, get her a small toy or something to show that when you are good, you are rewarded.)<br>  <br>  good luck :)|`|ntdGOZqGaa	Oh yea been there done that before lol its fun! I would just tell her when she screams at you or hits or throws food firmly NO and that isnt nice to do. If she does it again I would get her out of her highchair and put her in the livingroom and tell her no again. Eventually she will get it, and if they throw their food they arent hungry lol took me a long time to figure that out. I wouldnt call it a time out bc she is still little but you could place her in her playpen just to distract her from what she is doing. Hope it helps
zQWNb6neaa	My husband saw it this last time because I was trying to determine if it was bloody show or not. He is a painter and works with colors all day so I asked him to come in and verify the hue- it wasn't obviously red and I couldn't tell in the low light. He was fully warned of the gross factor before he came into the bathroom! But it was my third pregnancy so it didn't phase him really, he has seen worse things (episiotomy being given during my first labor- he is still scarred).|`|o8xNTVWTaa	hahah o god this question just made my day i needed a laugh|`|d6df9c3bab13d4a609d4641b785de6b0aa	No my husband has never seen it. Each time I lost mine I was in or went to the bathroom..alone.  I don't think he would gag though..lol.|`|a68665ef6c4434c025138a75281114eeaa	lmao!! i won't even let him see my dirty clothes!!!  your man sounds like he'd be fun to play some jokes on!|`|SONLm2Ilaa	Haha yes me and my husband are very open... It became a joke in my family! We call it show and tell lol!|`|em8A42Bqaa	I hope that my husband is home (he works at night) or that I'm home when it happens b/c he thinks he can handle all of this stuff, but he will be grossed out I'm sure.|`|8mLJJVGhaa	Nope, but he cringed when I told him about it!|`|GgrNdDxVaa	Ya my hubby wanted to see when i told him about it lol. He was very involved with everything from my first preg, and has been with this one so far as well. he always wanted to take me to the ER for any little thing that would happen to, so he did get scared and wanted to take me in when he saw it.|`|gD6MynLdaa	Hehehe...  I lost mine last week.  I wiped and there it was.  So I called my husband into the bathroom and showed him.  He is used to seeing disgusting stuff with his job, so he looked at it and asked if I was going into labor... LOL. I said no, and he shrugged his shoulders and walked out... LOL.  It was a lot funnier in person. Sorry.|`|Q0DLGuGwaa	ha ha how funny, well i suppose it could b like a introduction to the joys of labor lol, maybe i shall do the same with my partner|`|df67fd068a793b414d6deeb66df24512aa	Yep. I never noticed it with my 1st baby, but i lost mine with my 2nd baby.  I called my husband into the bathroom to see it.  He wasn't disgusted though.  I was about 37 weeks at that point so I was excited and so was he, we thought that the birth was imminent at that point. Wrong though, I was exactly 1 week late.|`|ZKm894kfaa	Thanks for the laugh.  No my bf didn't see it, but he would have probably gagged and passed out.  He doesn't do well with anything like that.  The neighbors mare was foaling and he wanted to watch.  As soon as he saw the afterbirth his face turned red and he started gagging! LMAO  I don't know how he made it through watching me give birth!
4Uuehq2Faa	that is beautiful! i think how everyones body changes in pregnancy is different this would include how much weight and stretch you gain :) i wouldnt worry, as long as you know your baby is growing, moving, has heartbeat it will be fine, congrats & good luck!|`|wgbAyuYRaa	No, your belly is surely within a normal range.<br>  <br>  You look small overall, though.  Very thin.  Maybe when you give birth you can consider a weight program to help build yourself up a bit.  That will not only look great but it will build your energy (something you'll need as a mom) and your strength (something else also useful as a mom)|`|AA12206218	No you look like your're healthy and in good shape <br>  You have a bump to be proud of<br>  I am now 23 weeks and this time around I am so much bigger than my last pregnancy. I guess it all the stretching has already been done<br>  this time around|`|iXQYd0Cmaa	nope, everyone is different some people just show more than others i didn't show until i was 24 weeks along|`|OUbgs89taa	No, your size is normal... actually you are bigger than me at 22 weeks (im 32 weeks now) My baby was all in my back but has sinced moved to the front so i feel HUGE!!<br>  <br>  Everyone carrys their bump in different positions and shapes.|`|7OZQ7PqTaa	No you look fine-I was still having morning sickness around 20 weeks so I hadn't gained much weight at all...your doctor will tell you if there's anything to be worried about.|`|OjXvYEZDaa	No, its pretty normal size for 22 weeks. Mine was the same at around 22 weeks.. but got massive bump at 35 weeks! congz!
hSTNMnFPaa	Austin Ray.    Austin has been growing on me as of late- it being the surname of one of my favorite authors, Jane Austen.    Good luck!  ? Q???|`|kCiizn5oaa	Joesph Owen|`|w4zjmhxoaa	Joesph Owen -- I think it really flows nicely and is very classic    I have bad associations with the name Ray, and I just prefer Joesph over Austin|`|FvYqKZSMaa	Austin Ray.Because Austin is one of my favorite names.|`|7wixocuDaa	joseph owen .. :)|`|A7ovwP94aa	Austin Ray. Joseph is too common.|`|UTsZLjAlaa	Joseph Owen... it's cuter and Ray sounds like a nick name.|`|TUNvbXbgaa	Joesph Owen  I do not like the name Austen. why name a kid after a city?|`|CRvdmFwCaa	Joesph Owen...    Sounds cute!|`|im40rf6zaa	Austin Ray, it's cute for a baby and he'll like it when he grows up - it's a cool name for ever|`|VHHis05Naa	Joseph Owen, because I hate Austin and Ray|`|Elxuvon8aa	I really like them both  Owen is becoming more popular   Austin Ray is probably more common but I think I like it a little better.|`|rFMRgHTdaa	Joseph Owen because for one it sounds better also because Joseph is a biblical name and Owen is the last name of my favorite football player. Good Luck!|`|EePf63ajaa	how about Ray Owen its cute.|`|aWPQXoIAaa	Joseph Owen.....Joey is cute.
7SKVCPcSaa	hm.. i dont' know. but either way its a great deal!    email them if you can.
7rCeCVl2aa	Not at all. If she enjoys it encourage it. So many moms have a hard time with tummy time.<br>  <br>  My favorite was to lay side by side with my little one and just gaze in to his eyes. It was great bonding time!|`|IGcS9K62aa	It's great that you're giving her tummy time, and it's even better she loves it. At my daughters 2 day visit (they call it the Newborn Club), they told us all about tummy time and to do it a few times every day. It's never to early to start. It won't do anything to the cord--she can't feel it. They say just not to let her sleep on her tummy!!<br>  <br>  Keep it up! It'll help her muscles develop especially in her back and neck. A lot of babies hate it (mine does). So let her get in as much time as she desires.|`|2674548b6a4c9cdbb098044c58c7af7aaa	If she hasn't had a problem, then she's fine.  Most generally, you should wait until the cord falls off, because the friction could make it come off early, but if she hasn't had a problem go for it.|`|h9Eg6r81aa	first of all... CONGRATULATIONS!!! and, its never to early!! =]|`|Vp83Fuakaa	she probably cant move enough to hurt any thing, but even if it did a little she wont brake .I promise|`|QlCRHbmBaa	mm|`|Zz9NJlETaa	I would say that it's not to early for tummy time.  I started my son at 2 weeks old.  Now he's six weeks and is pushing himself up with his arms, rolling over from belly to back, and has very string neck muscles.  His Ped. was impressed at his well child visit.  As long as she's not crying I don't see why it would hurt at all.  They say at about 3 weeks old, 30 minutes a day is excellent.  We have to start sometime.    If she's loving it, let her go.  And as far as her umbillical cord, it's almost ready to fall off anyways, she can't be too squirmy at 9 days old, not enough to hurt it anyways.  Like I said if she's not crying and she's enjoying tummy time, you can enjoy a little break as well from carrying/holding her.  You're a great mom for taking advantage of such a good exercise for the little ones at such a young age.  Keep up the good work!|`|wmc7uHLIaa	I would think it would be wise to wait for her cord to fall off first.  I don't think it would damage it, but it might be uncomfy for her to lay on that stump.  But tummy time is great, and you are lucky she enjoys it.  Congrats mama!|`|g1coKXlHaa	no it's never to early for tummy time. my Doc told me to put my daughter on her tummy when we went home.it's great for strengthening her neck and back, and hey if she loves it then why not!|`|7CTvtek0aa	No it won't hurt her cord. If you keep her on her tummy too much she might prefer it over being on her back and then have trouble getting to sleep.|`|Kg9H5ROcaa	it NEVER to early for tummy time. or too late. i still enjoy tummy time
6ELSwKKvaa	They shouldn't be sexually active because neither of them really has the ability to take care of a baby well and they are not married. I know it is fashionable for young people to have babies but a person gives up a lot of their own youth when they become pregnant. Also, it's nice that he loves her but to be honest, people do a lot of changing up until age 25. They very well could grow apart. It would be better to wait and see if they grow in the same direction with the same ideals and then get married and have a baby. If they have one now ( which we know BC is not 100%) they suddenly have a huge responsibility when they should be out having fun and just enjoying life.<br>  <br>   If they are not married and have a baby, suddenly there are extra pressures of which house gets the baby on the holidays. The father could very well walk out on her even if he seems to be very "in love' now. There is also the fact that enjoying the pregnancy is going to be tough as people will look down on her for having a baby so young. She will feel like she is an outcast because she won't relate well to her friends who don't have a kid and she won't relate well with adults. At least if the person is married, there is an extra piece of paper that says "you should work this out or it is going to get expensive". Without that paper, the guy can walk away without much trouble at all, leaving her to take care of everything. No one needs that type of hassle at her age.<br>  <br>   If her boyfriend is as caring as you say he is, he would not want to put her in a bad position. He would think more about her than his own sexual urges. I am sure that he can not financially help her or if she gets pregnant to fund the baby. The child will become the state's problem and that is where I take issue. I don't want to pay for someone else's child because they were not responsible and had sex on a regular basis when they should have been figuring out what they want to do in life. The country can not afford another welfare baby and that is what a baby from that union is going to become.<br>  <br>  EDIT: My daughter has been given all the information about STD's and Birth Control. She has also been told that it is best to wait until marriage to have sex and I understand she might not. I hope she makes the smart choice but I have given her the tools, I just hope she uses them. Just because I am against teenagers having sex, does not mean that I am against teaching birth control and healthier sexual practices.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  EDIT: Do me a favor, print this question and put it away until you are much older and you will see how foolish you sound about this. You will look back and think... did I really sound like that. Seriously, do it....|`|AQwoCjj3aa	**** you you are a ******* ************* **** face loser and I ******* hate you, go suck on a ******* ****.|`|5tqh0akYaa	sorry but she shouldn't have a sex life so she is still a slu* to me.Sure she is people but technically she isn't even an adult, and protection doesn't always work; condoms break and you forget to take the pill.

Yeah, she now has a screaming crying pooping baby that she has to support for the rest of her life, and isn't even in a stable home to raise a child or at a stable age. <br>  <br>  Ha, think again my dear.|`|cxVmq2kraa	Here's why.<br>  Your not emotionally ready.<br>  Your not ready to handle things that CAN happen with sex.<br>  I don't care if you use a condom & birth control BUT guess what.<br>  They don't always work.<br>  I'm not 30.<br>  I'm 14 & I think if you DO have a sex life, thats pretty pathetic.<br>  To post it on here JUST proves your not ready and your a attention seeker.|`|F9EvPa1Uaa	that's gross because you are saying a 12th grader is going out with a freshman??? That's just nasty because he will out of school and she will be still in school.  He would be 18, she would be 15, and if they continue to have sex, it's ILLEGAL! He can go to jail for that, once he turn 18, because he is considered an YOUNG ADULT|`|EZyHOht7aa	14 year olds shouldn't have a sex life.

You must be a very lost and misguided child. I reccomend you take a health class and get some education.|`|9ntoGPFyaa	you from Miami or something?<br>  <br>  no, sex is something people around the age of 18+ should be involved in. im 15, and im staying out of it.|`|a7xUvhqpaa	Them getting permission from their parents is disgusting.

And I got pregnant at 14, I thought I loved my bf, nah, love fades in the worst of times. I'm 15, and 21wks6d pregnant. However, I due have a bf who I am NOT having sex with. I think it is very wrong, because considering what you have said about her, she will not make a good mother. She needs to sort her life out.. And if her parents have given her permission to have sex, (which in most states is illegal considering their ages) then they are at fault, and are not doing their job as parents. <br>  There is a difference between to have sex, and make love to. You can have sex without love, and love without sex.<br>  -Violet|`|AA12073051	She's fourteen! a baby! tell them to ............<br>  <br>  <br>  never mind. let them have sex. I realized I would do it too. If I was really in love.<br>  <br>  why is this even a question though?<br>  do you REALLY care about what people are going to say? or are you really bored? Or for some reason, do you just want for everyone to know about your friend?|`|HX4B4Rtvaa	If they were really in love then they would love each other enough to wait for marriage.

Being monogamous and using birth control is a definite sign of responsibility! At the age of 14, especially if she doesn't have relationship experience, she is more vulnerable to heartbreak, but that is a risk almost everyone takes with their first sexual partner... regardless of age!<br>  <br>  I lost my virginity at 14, I'm almost 19 now, and I've never regretted it. Actually, I'm with the guy who I lost my virginity to... and he is 4 years older than me, so he was 18 when we first had sex. It was also a "norm" where I grew up for girls to lose their virginity around 9th or 10th grade. I have always been responsible and used birth control. There are people in their 20s who don't have that kind of common sense!<br>  <br>  I can't believe everyone has been calling her "wrong"! That's just the kind of attitude that keeps teenage girls from talking to their parents about birth control and sexual activity! It just creates a negative and hostile environment. I don't think the answer to the "sexually active teenagers" dilemma is "get them to stop". I think it is to encourage responsibility and safety. That goes for people of all ages.|`|MxxNjf9Zaa	Well my views or my choice is to save it for marriage...<br>  but since you want us to think in an open minded fashion this is what i say. <br>  It is their choice whether they believe that they are comfortable about having sex together. I wouldn't say daily, maybe 1 or 2 a week. Also don't share the fact that they are sexually active together because there are people that don't get it (like me) and then there are people who will call her a ***** without knowing her. <br>  Use protection so that you will have a smaller chance of getting pregnant. Enjoy the sex and enjoy their relationship, if their parents don't mind then they should enjoy it! It's only bad if you feel its bad! Doesn't matter what others think! She can go have sex all she wants but at the end of the day you have to relize what this makes her look like. She might be the sweetest and shyest person ever but with her having sex people will only see her by her actions and that is tough.<br>  Good luck with her.<br>  Tried not to state my opinions, just state what needs to be known.<br>  Hope i helped!|`|RMIX8vzHaa	I feel so sorry for her. This is obviously not okay because it is due to the repercussions of rape. It's really sad. And she probably has an STD right now. Plus in some states 14 and 17 is illegal. And its just not right. She doesn't sound mature enough to handle it.<br>  and btw most kids do not lose their virginity at 13 or 14. Definitely not the actual average is around 17.<br>  btw im 13. <br>  and i just feel like it;s wrong. If u grow up so fast, were else do u have left to go. they have nothing 2 look forward 2. I personally think its best to wait until marriage but i can understand ppl at 16 or 17. 13 and 14 just seems wrong to me. Were still kids. Like do u think its okay 4 3 y/olds to have sex. I bet u don't and neither do I. Even if no one got pregnant or physically hurt it seems wrong. She shouldn't be ashamed of what happened to her and what she did (waste of time and makes u feel bad about yourself) but she should stop having sex.<br>  <br>  <br>  EDIT:  Umbrella under top hat is completly right the age of consent is usually 16 in most states. No mattter what he rapes her everyday.|`|g9vw4ovGaa	I don't believe at 14 years old you are responsible enough to care for a child, which is what will most likely become of sex. At 14 years old you can't get a decent job to take care of such child and will end up on welfare. Birthcontrol is not 100% and neither are condoms. And if she doesn't use them every single time, she can still contract an STD, maybe even HIV and i'm not sure at 14 years old she wants her life cut down to maybe 35 if she is lucky. At 14 years old you either are in MIDDLE SCHOOl or a freshman in highschool. I was 17 when I lost my virginity and I wasn't even responsible enough to care for a newborn child. In the end, you are not old enough to be making life changing decsions, you can't even cote yet!|`|iU4Q2GOdaa	*EDIT* im actually kind of amazed you are so mature about this... and i dont think you needed to ask this question. you already know how pathetically critical most people without their OWN sex lives are, youre just looking to see if there are other people out there to corroborate what you already know.... youre completely in the right, honey. anyone who rebukes anything of what youre saying is an ignorant. its refreshing to know that theres such smart young girls out there, tho.<br>  <br>  FOR THE LIFE OF ME I do not understand why age is such an issue with people when it comes to sex. when youre ready, be it 18 or 10, its your FREAKIN choice, and noone should take it upon themselves to judge just because youre not a COMPLETE MORON and are "saving" yourself for marriage (which, if you ask MOST honest couples who actually waited, was a BIG mistake).<br>  i do think your frind has some issues, but she coped in the best way she knew how, and now she seems to be happy, which is the ONLY thing one has to worry about, to be content with yourself. everyones opinions are just that, OPINIONS. they dont count.<br>  your friend would be classified as FINE AND DANDY by any freakin smart psychologist out there, and anyone that tries to turn her sexuality into a disease or condition is just trying to take your money. she needs no professional treatment. her boyfriend (as you said) is giving her the strength and support that she needs. so what if she enjoys sex? and as gross as the idea might sound to you, the fact that your boys parents have sex everyday is an EXCELLENT example of how marriages should be (which is double good for you because that means your man doesnt have any sexual hangups, trust me its awful dealing with those that do!). sex is a very important part of life for adults, and denying our sexuality is whats REALLY a problem. Loveless (sexless) marriages are failing mariages.<br>  <br>  its not wrong at all for her to be sexually active, however, when he turns 18 there will be some trouble with the law concerning the fact that shes gonna be a minor, so anyone that opposes the relationship will try to get them in trouble.|`|j4Mjc4Ecaa	if shses positive hes the one...then i guess go for it.  Although, as you mentioned above, it is good that she is using protection and even better that they have permission from their parents.  Personally however, oh btw im 14, I have a boyfriend who I love very musch, but I feel that at my young age I dont exactly know what love is.  So until I come to that point we will not do anything.  Im saying that your friend or yourself are this however, maybe you matured faster than me and truly understood what love was.  Anyway best of luck to all :]<br>  <br>  p.s.- no one in this post is a slut, just wanted to get that out there lol|`|lwBS8eOhaa	Because people who date and become sexually active before age 16 tend to base their personality and SELF-WORTH on whether they have a boyfriend, who their boyfriend is etc. then things go horribly wrong (especially with self-esteem) Also sex is meant to be physical, emotional, and spiritual and it's not the same out side of marriage where your not committed 100%. Third, guys want to date a girl they can use, but when it comes to a serious relationship they don't want to date someone who's been used. It's not smart, and if the 17 year old really cared for her, he would wait. There relationship isn't gonna last long after he satisfies his physical needs.|`|oMAyaFZAaa	Parents don't want kids to have sex because they don't want to child to "grow up". I think anyone can have sex as long as they are ready for the consequences. If you aren't ready to handle a baby, what makes you think you are ready for sex? That's kinda stupid to me... Kinda like me robbing a bank and not expecting to go to jail. <br>  <br>  Anyway, that's my opinion. Live your life! :)|`|wNdB8Gjyaa	A general reason for anyone not to have sex is the world has enough children as it is. <br>  <br>  I don't want any extra scumbags competing for jobs or uneducated unwanted children growing up to vote and therefore effect my future.<br>  <br>  but, as I said, this applies to anyone of any age - no, just because you're over 18 doesn't mean your intelligent enough to raise a kid. This generation of kids is proof enough of this. <br>  <br>  That being said, sexuality is an undeniable part of human culture, more so in adolescence. So, from a cold, uncaring and purely logical standpoint (cultural morality is so gross), do what you want - just, for god's sake, get rid of any "accidents" that come from it. It may not be nice, but there really simply isn't room for more us.|`|yfO69px8aa	well they can do whatever they want. the consequences of having a kid is their fault. they should just use protection and it'll be fine

cP03k3cXaa	This is just a quick easy answer to your question, but I suggest a few things.....<br>  <br>  1. Go to your local library and do a search for party planning books. <br>  2. Try planning a scavenger hunt. <br>  3. Go to your favorite search engine and pop in birthday party ideas for 15 year old, and play with it. You might find a great suggestion for a party and take that idea and search that specifically. <br>  4. Get ideas from your child and their friends.

TQW5E6olaa	Dogs are animals, anything is possible. Get a baby doll that cries, carry it around, treat it like a real baby, see how the dog reacts.    You'll need boundaries for both the child and dog. A training refresher course might be a good idea, if he needs it when the baby comes. The dog will need loads of attention just like the baby so he won't feel resentful.    I had a wonderful dog, who had to find another home when my daughter was diagnosed with severe asthma, we miss her so much|`|0781f56992749b6d9de1b9aa61424bbbaa	What really matters is how your 'pack' is structured and how you introduce this new member of the 'pack' to the others.      As long as the adult humans in the home are the alpha dogs (and you don't have to be mean to do that - just confident and clearly in charge) and you introduce the new baby as a favored pup, you should be fine.  Our kids are, clearly, alpha to the dogs in the home.  They know their place.  The dogs are loved & well cared for, but they know that the 'alpha dogs' expect them to treat the human pups with as much respect as they do the alphas.|`|ERjGLJaEaa	You will be surprised how your dog might change when a baby comes.

You seem to be the type that will teach the child to be considerate as well as the dog not to be aggressive around the child, so I think with all things considered, it will be ok.  Take it a day at a time--and don't neglect the dog too much with the new child, everyone will have to adjust:-)  Good luck|`|3fcf101a2615a631d556e32ec980eae0aa	There is practically no reason (other than severe aggression or health issues) that a household can't have children and dogs.    Number one rule is to never leave a child and a dog alone unattended.  Seems like common sense, but there are people that don't grasp this simple concept and that's when accidents happen.  And yes, part of having a child around a pet is teaching BOTH what behaviors are appropriate and what are not (ie. pulling dog's ears is not acceptable.)|`|sidRlOL9aa	She's a really nice looking dog. From what you said, she seems like she is going to be okay. But, I wouldn't let her get too close to the childs face. She might get startled if the kid tries to grab her, or pet her. The dog might take it the wrong way and lunge. From my friends experience, she had a 7 year old yellow lab. The dog was a great dog, laid back, loved everyone, friendly to people and other dogs, but about a year ago, they had a child and when the child got about 6 months the child went to go pet the dog and the dog ended up biting him in the face. The child had flight for life. The child ended up being okay but has a pretty bad scared up face and was in critical condition for 2 months. So, just be careful. Make sure you teach both of your dogs not to go by the kid(s). Make sure they understand.|`|agTCqkLDaa	Just to be safe, I'd take them both to an obedience class.    I'm nowhere near having kids, but they ARE in my future and I have a 14 month old dog who is sweet but a bit aggressive.  I can't bare to put him to sleep if he bites someone, so we have an appointment Friday to discover and treat his aggression.    I just think you can never be too safe.    I think as long as you teach your kids how to handle dogs too that it should be fine, but an obedience class can't hurt.|`|a9YfUGzSaa	I work at my local humane society with the dogs and we have classes out of St. Joseph Mercy hospital about helping pets and babies coexist, so you should call around and see if there is anything like that around you.  Dogs and babies can get along very well, but you have to watch them like a hawk and NEVER, EVER leave them unsupervised.    It sounds like the two of them will get along great, but in the first several years of baby's life you shouldn't allow them to play together.  They can be in the same room if you are holding the baby or the baby is in some way inaccessible to the dog, but you should wait until at least the toddler stage to allow them to play together on the floor and at the first sign of trouble SEPARATE IMMEDIATELY.  Little things can happen in infancy you wouldn't even think of, like the dog rolling over on the baby or stepping on it.  It's a relatively small dog but that's still a scary thing for a little kid.    Our "kid proof" test at the shelter is to grab and pull on the dog (gently, of course) to see if they get aggravated.  By the sounds of it your dog would pass our test.  I think everything will be fine as long as you pay attention.|`|ad9efc98eb0fbeeae6b6c4abfd63046caa	kids need to learn to respect dogs and if a dog is gentle and the kids know the correct way to treat the dog it should be ok|`|qDnFaYTUaa	i dunno i n ver had kids|`|2xS1Jro7aa	Aww!! She looks just like our male dog Diesel! Only he is a little darker! She will be fine with the baby she will get used to her before she starts grabbing at her and chasing her so she will already see her as part of the pack and will tolerate it. So I would not worry about it if I were you! They do say that you should bring a blanket that the baby has been using in the hospital and bring it home for the dog to smell and sleep with for a night so that the dog is already used to the babies smell! Good luck and you have a very cute puppy!|`|AA10976951	We had a rat terrier when our daughter was born.  He was very mouthy and wouldn't let most people near him without a fight.  As soon as we brought our daughter home he was instantly protective of her, like she was his or something.  His barking didn't bother her (and he barked a lot lol) and she could do literally anything she wanted to him, even pull his tail...which he hated to even have anyone touch!  Your dog should be fine with the baby, if yours is anything like our they know the baby is coming and are expecting their arrival.
JvZY0ZS4aa	I'm in my third pregnancy (no miscarriages or anything unusual) and I still only really believed it when I started feeling him moving around in there, which was at about 16 weeks for me this time.     I can imagine with your experiences you'd be very hesitant or unable for it to really sink in for a while. I think if nothing else, the baby kicking/moving will do it for you. An ultrasound can still just come across as watching a movie of 'some' baby. But when you have those kicks and sense this little being inside that has a mind of it's own, you can't help but get the realization of it.    Then again, with my first baby, it only fully sank in a few days after she was born! :o) Fortunately for us crazy moms and moms-to-be, our worrying and emotional ups and down don't change the fact that there's really a baby in there!|`|kT7GVOosaa	I was 5 months when I looked at myself in the mirror and said "holy ****" I really am pregnant. it took a while!|`|OU9xnW86aa	It sunk in for me when I hit the second trimester. Once the fear of miscarriage was reduced (never gone) and I started feeling better I adjusted to the idea and accepted it as real. Before then, even when I was having morning sickness, fatigue, etc... I didn't "feel" pregnant, now I feel pregnant.|`|WPI0Z47saa	I knew I was pregnant, looked very pregnant, saw the ultrasound, but didn't totally take it all in until I held the baby.|`|mc6YtaRbaa	I didn't believe it and when I saw the baby's heartbeat at 7.5 weeks I believed it for that day, but the belief will still come and go! Once you start showing it will sink in. I think it hit me around 12-14 weeks.|`|Zb7AGTwAaa	WHEN I ACTUALL FELT THE MOVEMENT AND MY GROWING STOMACH.|`|kQC4HX6vaa	I tried for 3 years to conceive, and now I'm 15 weeks pregnant.    I still don't believe it, until I do something and my husband laughs at me in disbelief.    Apparently, I've become very short tempered and "sassy," as he likes to put it.  I don't even know I'm doing it, and he blames it on the baby.    He's my Jimminy Cricket reminding me I'm pregnant and psychotic.|`|kv8ZFPP1aa	it didn't sink in that i was pregnant until i started getting the baby bump and i felt him move. so it just depends on the person on when they feel they're really pregnant. and your situation is understandable seeing as you have already had 2 m/c, but you're dr is right...after 12 weeks the percent goes down but the more you stress it isn't good.|`|PwhrTNZraa	Well I'm sitting at 15weeks3days and it still doesn't feel "real" yet.  I've heard the hearbeat (at 13 weeks), good and strong 160.  I have been SO sick for the last 2 weeks with a cold that is just not subsiding but I seem to be relapsing if that's even possible with a cold lol.  I went to the doctor yesterday to get all checked out because I'm just not getting any better and of course I'm always worried about baby, especially having suffered a m/c myself, but dr says it has no ill effects on baby and everything is fine.  I get to finally go for my ultrasound on the 24th of this month, around 18weeks and I'm thinking THAT'S when it's finally going to sink in.  I have a bump already, so it's visible that I'm pregnant but until I see my little bub on screen and feel him/her kick....... I did relax a little more after I hit the 12week mark though.|`|DTg3USppaa	The crazy thing is, I found out I was pregnant 6-7wks ago, and now yesterday I went to my first doc visit and got my ultra sound...NOW IM A BELIEVER!!! LOL. I didn't feel pregnant or think i really was even after 3 pregnancy tests!! LOL.|`|jLNwrVZRaa	Usually the miscarriage rate drops significantly once they can see that the embryo is implanted and the can see the heart beat.  I have a 4 1/2 month old son and I didn't really believe I was pregnant until I started showing and he really started moving a lot.  Once you can feel them move then it is undeniable that there really is a whole new life in your belly!|`|GUUgeptjaa	Honestly, I did not find out until I was 8 and 6 weeks, and this time not until I was 4 weeks and since I only told my dh until I was 3 months, it did not really sink in until then.  Once you hear the heatbeat the miscarriage rate goes down remarkably and also when you get past 12 weeks you are usually good to go, especially when you have a heartbeat.  But yes it did not really sink in that I was pregnant until I told all of our family.|`|4XfjUcvDaa	I didnt fully believe that I was actually pregnant until I was able to see the baby move on the ultrasound. I still had thoughts of miscarriage but then when I started to feel him Kick, I knew it was for real.    After having amiscarriage it makes it very hard for both mother and father to believe that it will be for real.|`|fTLzKg5Eaa	In my Second Trimester I let myself to feel happy... I was trying for this Baby for over a year, I miscarried 3 mont before I got Pregnant (I had early miscarriage) and when Doctor confirmed my Pregnancy I did not show my emotions even though I wanted it so much... someone even told me you are pregnant I thought you would look happier... the Reason I did not let myself to be happy I was afraid if something happens I would not be able to handle it... but Reaching my Second Trimester changed me completely I wake up with the smile on my Face, I am full of energy and soo happy and waiting for my baby to start kicking... there is so much to look forward to... I understand you and soon you will relax, (of course occasionally I still get scared but all the Pregnant women do)|`|qVEJ7OVJaa	It hadn't sunk in with me that I was actually pregnant until this past Friday (20 w 6 d) when I had the ultrasound that showed me it was a boy! I thought whoa..I actually have a baby boy inside of me right now! And I am getting a pregnant tummy now and can see the inside of my belly button...lol :)|`|Yl79igD7aa	I just had my 18 week u/s today and found out we're having a girl and it's FINALLY sinking in.  Yes, it took me all this time.  I'm also sitting in newly purchased maternity clothes due to the little potbelly I now have but we were concerned about possible birth defects because we learned last week that one of our tests came back abnormal.  I think I wasn't allowing myself to celebrate this pregnancy until now because I wasn't sure what we'd be facing.  Now that I know our little one is healthy, I'm finally ready to celebrate!     http://lizspage.shutterfly.com/|`|Qfq4lpe7aa	When I seen the little one on the US and I could see his face in the 3 d!  It was so cool now I am showing pretty good so there is no denying it now... :) Good luck to you!|`|AA11327039	It really didn't sink in for me until I started getting a big ole belly on me.  Even then motherhood didn't sink in until I brought my kids home.  I guess I'm slow.|`|JsaEk8UAaa	It didn't sink in for me until I could feel my baby move. As long as I could feel the baby I knew all was well. Right now it is hard because you can only hear the heartbeat what a beatiful song!!!! Congrats!!!!|`|0BC2WTyoaa	12 weeks...that is when it sunk in for me.  When I had my 12 week nuchal scan.  Even if you aren't concerned about Downs I would get this just to see that your baby is growing at a good rate.  :)  Plus you know you can get a profile picture and ask the girls on in-gender.com what the gender is.  ;)|`|aB2zSt6Vaa	I'm so sorry for your losses. I have not miscarried myself, but watched 4 m/c's happen between 2 girlfriends this year, and it was devasting since all 3 of us girls were TTC at the same time. I found out VERY early that I was pregnant, about 10 days past ovulation because I was a crazy tester. Finding out early meant having to go even longer until I reached the "safe zone" of 13-14 wks. The fact that you have been so sick is a good sign, there is a direct link between morning sickness and "sticky" pregnancies, since hormone levels tend to be very high in good, viable pregnancies and that's what causes morning sickness. I am in the middle of my 4th month, about 14 weeks along right now and feeling great, very little morning sickness during my first trimester, so of course I was scared to lose this little bean. Now that my belly is growing a bit and it's uncomfortable to lay on my belly, I feel sorta pregnant, but I think most women really feel it when the baby moves for the first time, which I'm looking forward to! Seeing the heartbeat was awesome, and my OBGYN said the same thing, at that point the risk of m/c was reduced to only 4 or 5%, but I still don't "feel" pregnant sometimes, so I understand!    Hang in there, it sounds like this baby is a keeper!
D35xKICoaa	No i would be upset too but because it happen already just go easy on him hope she don't make this mistake again.|`|65e0c93e39fac0974cefe1be5c93b58daa	This is a perfectly reasonable reaction.  I can't imagine why you would want to feel proud of her, its pretty easy to get pregnant.  The time for pride will be when the baby is born and she is taking care of it.    Of course you should support her, and advise her, but she'll make whatever decisions she chooses to make.  And as a big sister, of course you can be upset with her for making the wrong decision, older siblings get to do that!  You should also feel fortunate that your family is in a position to help her, so that she still has the opportunity to go get an education to support her child later on.  Not every teen mother gets that chance.    I'm sure it'll all turn out for the best.  Just keep being her big sister.|`|JsaEk8UAaa	Sounds to me like you love your sisters. You have been through college and know how tough it is without having a child. You are far enough along in your pregnancy to see how it has changed your life - what a Blessing!!!!  You sound like you are concerned just because you love her. Try not to let this take away from your joy!!!!!|`|eS4CSdQ5aa	i would be upset as well..she is too young.    i dont understand how some girls just cant take good advice.    a women at my job just announced her pregnancy and she is tiny (thinner) so i feel her belly looks cuter than mine and i am so mad, like cameron's mommy just mentioned, i feel like she's stealing my light/thunder|`|DNygQdmVaa	No your not.  she should of been more resposible..  When my son was 5 months old my SIL announces she was 7 months pregnant, i felt like she was stealing my light or something.  and i was pretty mad.|`|oHbFCuGDaa	you know wat. YOU told her to be careful and she just brushed it off her shoulder like nothing and she is NOW pregnant.. at 17!! honestly if she's not mature and resonsible enough to listen to you and her PARENTS you should be pissed and teach her a lesson.  Now she has to deal with a BABY. Seriously if you don't talk to her and say what you have to say then get prepare to be giving her money for child support.|`|9vgZNLP8aa	You are not stupid at all. Your sister is the one being stupid! She sounds like another dumb bratty kid who thinks they know everything. She's only 17 and if it was my sister I would be upset too!    All you can do is be there for her and the baby and know that you did your best to offer good advice. It's not your fault she didn't take it.|`|48suPjHcaa	no it's okay my little sister david just got pregnant the other day and i feel just so ashamed.|`|8mLJJVGhaa	No, not at all stupid, I think you would probably see things differently if you were not pregnant yourself, but your body is getting ready to have your own baby, and your mind is getting ready to make your baby's life the best you can possibly give it, so your sisters news has probably thrown all this into disarray!|`|HtpRBMFraa	You have every right to be upset. It sounds like you feel responsible in some way. Maybe this is a good opportunity for her to learn from her mistakes and grow up a little.|`|ymaVUEFZaa	well first tell her that she needs to stop being a snob to you and your family then tell her you will always be there for her no matter what and you want the best for her in her life. but i would feeel bad if my younger sister was pregnant because shes way to young!|`|gdnL63ngaa	I can understand your upset. My sister was selfish and rude before her baby. She did change a lot as she realized that she wasn't the ONLY person who mattered.    Maybe your sister will change once she realizes all the work of a child and that child will get all the attention instead of her.    You never know, it may bring you guys closer like it did for my sister and me.|`|7f5af7e7fb02a50e93290cbababdc097aa	No I'd be upset too. Its not easy watching someone you love and care about making wrong/ bad decisions. But,what is done is done so try not to go down to her level and be mean/ rude back. Its nice to hear that the baby wi be taken care of no matter what but I would talk to your parents about not making motherhood for your sister too easy either. She needs to learn responsibility, and if they make iteasy on her by taking care of all her sisters and her babys needs, she wil probably keep being irresponsible and could have another pull out baby very soon!|`|wObmwK1uaa	Im also 17 & pregnant, your little sister might be a really good mum and you should help her through it as she will be very scared like me and will need all of the advice she can get. try not to be upset with her and just see the happy side of things :) x
LDHu66Vraa	I just found this thing online that you can make a crossword puzzle with all the stuff the mommy likes. Also I don't know if this counts as a game but you have everyone at the shower put there names and mailing address on envelops and then you pick on. (the best part you already have the thank you cards ready for sending)<br>  <br>  this one is kinda perverted but fun. <br>  <br>  you take a stocking and drop in orange in one leg make sure it goes all the way to the bottom. Then tie the stock around your  waist. Make sure that the orange hangs down so you can hit the other orange. Now you want to "thrust" to get the orange in the stocking to knock the other orange into the goal. its kinda like Crockett.

The person with the most correct answers wins!<br>  <br>  DIRTY DIAPER GAME<br>  You melt different candy bars and put each melted bar in a diaper, so it looks like poop.  You label the diapers A, B, C, etc.  Then your guests have to guess which candy bar is in each diaper.  It is really funny.  The person with the most correct answers wins!|`|7SwmxIvaaa	buy those teeny tiny plastic babies, put them in ice trays,<br>  <br>  the purpose of the game is to rub your ice cube until your water 'breaks'<br>  then you get the prize!|`|xo0wxQXBaa	At my baby shower they had an arts and crafts project. Each person drew a number between one and eighteen. They then created a birthday card with construction paper, stickers, markers, etc. for the year that they drew.

Take it away and see how many people can remember what was in the bag...whoever can name the most stuff gets a prize.<br>  <br>  Race: Get a bunch of 4oz baby bottles and fill them with juice....see who can finish their bottles first, then they get a prize.|`|MMj7YcXkaa	at both my showers, we played a game where we had to put clothes pins between our knees and drop them in a jar like 15 feet in front of you, the person with the most clothes pins won!  and guess how big the mommies tummy was.  get a ball of string and pass it around.  Everyone has to cut off the amount that they think is the proper length to go around the pregnant mommy's tummy.  the one closest to the actual length wins.And Lastly; blow up a bunch of balloons.

I know it sounds really hard, but you when you're in your last week of pregnancy, always expect to go into labour. It helps you get prepared.  Also from 34 weeks, start drinking one cup of rasberry leaf tea twice a day. This tones your uterus and prepares it for labour.    Also take gentle exercise. This gives you stamina which helps you cope during labour.    Also fill your diary with places to go and people to visit during the last couple of weeks, this keeps you busy and keeps your mind off delivery, as you may find the time will drag.    Also sleep alot, you need enough energy as possible for when you go into labour!    If you're giving birth in a hospital, take a tour around the maternity unit if you haven't already, so you know where to go etc. when you arrive.    Good Luck x|`|JvZY0ZS4aa	Have you ever been terrified of a crazy roller coaster or scary ride? Imagine you decide to get on this ride because you see how many others get off and say how awesome the ride was.    Now you're on the ride and no matter what, you're on it till it stops. Sometimes it's scary, sometimes it's awesome and exhilarating, other times you think you're going to crash. Yet at the end you're 'pumped' and think it was an exciting, awesome experience.     You didn't really know what to expect and while it was happening you couldn't comprehend it all. Then when it's over, you realize it was great and worth it.    Pregnancy and labor is like this. Only experience can really open your eyes to what it's like and like other 'crazy rides' you'll find that you can do it and it may be terrifying and bad at times but when all is said and done, the good parts stand out the most!|`|W0d6NsGBaa	Best advice is just RELAX!

They really will help.|`|9vgZNLP8aa	Relax and trust your body. The more tense you are the more pain you will feel and the worse things will be. Try to focus on the fact that you are about to meet your little baby for the first time! For me that one really helps. I try to remind myself that the pain is for a reason and soon I will have my little one in my arms and hear her first cries and finally get to see what she looks like. :)

5270639c059ab08c1b3431555f150db7aa	CONGRATS to you!  I went through my pregnancy and had our baby when I was obese.  Once I saw my doctor, he sent me to a nutritionist - and what I was most worried about was the 'typical' weight gain of 25-35 pounds. I just cried and cried while she was talking to me about this. I just couldn't imagine putting on more weight (my weight had been the same and stable for years).  Anyhow, in the meantime, we ended up moving to a different city about a month later, and I was referred to an ob/gyn. Well, he set me straight - he had many obese women as patients, and said my overall HEALTHY weight gain would maybe be in the five to 10 pound range. What a fountain of information this wonderful man was!  Because I was eating WAY healthier, cut out almost all junk food, and fried foods, and was exercising more, I actually was losing weight at the beginning of my pregnancy (under dr. strict care!) - and I was healthy, and so was baby! Overall, I gained five pounds through the pregnancy, and the day after my 8 lb. 3 oz. son was born, I had lost 13 pounds.     Hopefully you have a doctor you can talk openly with - and write down questions you have ahead of time, and bring the list with you.  It's said some pregnant women who are obese have problems with gestational diabetes - I sure didn't - but funny, the moms I know who had it were thin, and then ended up with 10 lb. babies.  The same is true with blood pressure. Just watch the salt (stop with the pre-prepared foods, deli meats, etc.) - just good home cooking and lots of fibre, fruits, and veggies.    About you and your husband - you two need to reconnect NOW and make sure you get your intimacy back. Explain to him that you need to connect, to communicate - and that being with him makes you feel happy and wanted and loved - and all those delicious hormones that come so wonderfully with making love and having orgasms are very good for your overall health through your pregnancy.  Don't assume it's because of you  - please!|`|UcgWrGaAaa	You should look into the South Beach diet.  If you are obese already, you will be perfectly fine to gain little or nothing.  I had gestational diabetes and they put me on a 2000 cal diet.  That is plenty of food and you can make sure you don't  over do it eating for 2.      Just make sure you get plenty of protein and fat, it's counter intuitive but when you eat these you get full faster.  Of course you can over do it.   You have to learn to stop when you are satisfied.    The reason I suggest South Beach is because  it is a moderate carb level diet.  Carbs such as bread, pasta, rice, pancakes, tortilla, in excess along with sugar will raise your blood sugar and make you feel tired when it's high and then your sugar drops and you feel tired and hungry when it's low.  The way to keep control on your appetite is to keep control on your blood sugar, did I mention that protein and fat last longer in your digestive system and will barely raise your bs.     Some people get scared when you start talking about fats, but you just have to remember that some sources are a lot healthier than others.  Avocados, olives, olive oil, nuts and seeds.  Butter is better than margarine.  Same cals but healthier, because it is natural. and not made with artificial oils|`|7add460ae24c9452ae87b5a99c5aa756aa	You can exercise regularly...but Im guessing you didnt exercise before the pregnancy, so talking to a trainor and your doctor is your best bet.  Eat healthy!  No need to eat bad foods just because you are preggers.|`|em8A42Bqaa	I was worried, but there are pregnancy workout tapes and also I bought an excercise bike.  I'm 7 months and I've gained 15 pounds.  It's breasts and stomach, my pants still fit!|`|eS4CSdQ5aa	walk regularly.  i eat more veggies than usual|`|phwivaqNaa	You will probably actually lose weight in the begining, which is very common.  I am overweight and my due date is today.  My doctor has never mentioned my weight gain or voiced concern.  I lost 11 pounds in the begining and then gained 20 pounds.  I am know 9 pounds up from my original weight.  I tried to eat healthy, but did induldge.    Dont do new excercises unless consulting you doctor.  Squatting,etc isnt good.  Just try to fit veggies and fruit in and take you prenatal vitamins.  I thought I would never look preganant.  At 6 wks, I know how you feel.     People started out asking "Do you have any kids?" as to not put there foot in there mouth.  At 20 weeks I could say, yes Im pregnant!    At 40 weeks, people just say, "Wow, your gonna drop that baby at any minute!"    Try to be positive until you make it until people can start to tell and you wont feel "fat" anymore.  It helped me a lot to only by empire waist tops because it helps to show off the bump.  When we are already padded, they cant see the bump and it just makes us look big.  Also, the panel pants that cover your whole stomach smooth things out more and give the illusion of a bump more until your stomach gets harder and rounder.  I had  t-shirts and other stuff, but to go out that is the only thing I will wear.    Make sure your husband isnt scared to hurt you or the baby now that you are pregnant.  He found you attractive enough 6 weeks ago!  Take time to put on a little makeup and pamper yourself, that makes all the difference in how you feel.    I think you will be surprised out how much mother nature balances the weight gain out when you are overweight and pregnant.|`|FGgnaQplaa	Exercising while you're pregnant (if you're smart about it) is an excellent idea.  Try walking between 2 and 3 miles daily (it should only take 45 minutes to an hour, and walking is hugely beneficial).  Other than that, be persistant to eat healthy foods (lots of veggies, few fruits and starches) so you should lose enough weight to become healthy again or maintain your weight long enough for your baby to be born.  As for your husband not finding you attractive, the key to physical attraction is confidence.  If you can stick to a solid/ non intimidating plan to lose enough weight that you'll feel beautiful, your husband will see it in you too.  Try asking him to work out with you, you can spend time together while reaching your goals.  You could join weight-watchers, they're always supportive and give you honest-to-goodness life lessons that will get you healthy and keep you that way!  Best of luck! :-)|`|2ObqoJbKaa	Well, make good food choices. Cut out most junk food from your diet, and try to eat healthier foods. Also, it is healthy and good to exercise during pregnancy. Just don't over do it. While Im pregnant I just walk on the treadmill for about a half an hour a few times a weeks. You could also do a little biking, or the eliptical machine. good luck|`|aJTBF7opaa	I know the feeling, i am not skinny myself and pregnant. Just eat healthy, snack healthy, and the best exersize is walking. Boneless skinless chix, is very healthy for you, and can be eatin as a healthy snack just put it in the frying pan with pam and some seasoning that you love. Hard boiled eggs, cheese, pudding cups, granola bars. Just because you are eating for two doesnt mean you eat enough for two adults. You eat fatty, high calorie foods all the time during pregnancy you are going to gain the wait and its going to be just as hard to get it off afterwards. Its okay to have a craving and fufill it, or slurge and eatwhat you want. Just in moderation. Good luck.|`|AA11459214	Talk to you doctor...mine was ok with losing some weight. this is my 2nd pregnancy and I lost 5 lbs and with my first I lost 15. As long as your eating healthy you should be fine. Don't diet just watch what you eat and it will naturally come off. Walking is great exercise as well as yoga. they make great dvd's for pregnancy so go check those out. Don't feel fat cause now you have a reason to stick out that belly instead of sucking it in...well thats how I saw it be happy it's a great time in your life and if you change your attitude your husband might change his too :) good luck with everything|`|PlqMl73Gaa	I had a simular situation when I was pregnant with my first son. I was very obese, then I ate real healthy, and I started walking in the evening. Just around the block once or twice a week.  I lost almost 70 lbs during my pregnancy. They said it was perfectly natural. The baby gained weight and grew normally, and I was the one person in the hospital excited about their post prenancy weight. They said that the extra weight that I was carring supplied the nutrients and energy my body needed to grow a baby. The thing with your husband could be of your own doing. When you feel good about yourself, you have a different attitude about your body that your husband will pick up on. Perhaps he is getting the negative vibes you are sending and that is what is turning him off, not you or your body but your attitude.|`|tZfkPQF6aa	I'm overweight and pregnant as well. My doctor told me I am only allowed to gain 15 pounds max.    I try to eat smaller meals more often in the day with healthy foods. That way I don't feel hungry as often. Lots of veggies, fruit, and dairy. (Yogurt is my favorite snack). I also keep a granola bar or protein bar in purse in case hunger strikes on the road. And drink plenty of water - that has helped me tremendously!    If you didn't exercise prior to pregnancy, talk to your doctor because it may not be a good idea to start now. I walk some every day for about 20 minutes. I have DVDs specific to pregnancy that are yoga and some cardio. I do those a couple of days a week.     I'm 25 weeks and have only gained about 4 pounds so far. Talk to your doctor and see what they think as well.|`|5X3Wsxfwaa	Walking is one of the best exercises you can do.  Park at the back of the parking lot and walk farther to the store, etc.  Eat LOTS of fresh fruits and vegetables.  Eat whole wheat bread, pasta.  Sweet potatoes instead of white.  Brown rice instead of white.  My husband and I lost a lot of weight the healthy way.  No fat, trim meats and bake, grill, no frying.  Don't eat anything white.  Eat a salad with your dinner and lunch....greens, celery, green peppers will help you burn calories. Get rid of margarine and use real butter...but only a little.  Eggs are good for protein.  Oatmeal and bran cereal with skim milk and a small amount of sugar is a good breakfast.  Fat free yogurt and fresh fruit is a great snack in between meals and in the evening.  Sugar free pudding with fat free cool whip is also a satisfying snack in the evening.  My husband lost 100 pounds this way.  Talk to your doctor but if you loose a little weight in a healthy way I really think it will be okay.  I was overweight with my 2nd child and my doctor told me I needed to walk 2 miles a day.  Also, fish is good to eat like 5 times a week.  You can make tuna salads for lunch.  Grilled Salmon is the perfect food.  I have read that in magazines.  You can grill or bake other fish of your choice.  Best of luck!
Hx0a0Q8Uaa	I think you shouldn't be thinking about anesthetic but be thinking about permanent birth control. I'm not going to give you a moral reaming, i'm sure that you've already gotten a few of those, but I'm shocked that they would give you anesthetic at all I didn't know they still give people general anesthetic. Which leads me to believe that you are just a troll trying to get a rise out of people.     Which ever it is, I think i'm morally obligated to at least give you the best advice I can. First if you are considering abortion for the 5th time you may want to take the pill instead (ru486), especially if you are looking to actually have a child in the future (which I say get some therapy and join a cult or find Jesus before you do that) Having surgery is never good, even if its something minor and going under general anesthetic is also never good, so avoid it even if it's painful (i'm sure it's even more painful for the baby) 12% of all legal abortion patients experience a major complication especially after the second abortion.   but to answer your question   usually only a local anesthetic is needed.|`|kv8ZFPP1aa	agreed. maybe you should stop having sex and using abortions as a form of birth control!! every time you get an abortion you are killing an innocent life that didn't ask to be brought into this world.|`|48f05721032a07151098ef338560718eaa	this is the first thing that came to mind and i don't care if it sounds cruel... Maybe your mom should of killed you and that way you would not have this problem ... you make me sick.. have sex.. but be responsible.. i really hope this is a joke.. cause if not there is something really wrong with you and you should get help|`|lV8i73unaa	You have never had an abortion, have you???    They don't use general anesthesia for abortions!    I know a few people that have had them, and they don't do it except under extreme conditions!    You are just trying to get a large number of responses!    Shame on you for doing such a thing, and in this category!    SHAME!!!!!!    *shaking my head in disbelief*|`|vzIEn14zaa	lol...no one is answering the question.  Sorry about your luck.|`|AA11284789	wtf is wrong with you....... maybe you should try Birth Control!!!!|`|JVO8XlKOaa	Is this serious? You haven't her about birth Control Pills or condoms, you really should use this, do you realize how bad is what you are doing to your body, but worse you are killing your own seed. OMG, you are not mature enough to be having sex.|`|oSP09sXsaa	This is definitely a joke...|`|ycVOCVLbaa	You should be ashamed of yourself. I have been wanting a baby for a long time and I have had 3 miscarriages. People are on trying to conceive and not working. just think next time....|`|AA11210211	I hope it feels HORRIBLE,your 5th abortion?? Haven't you heard of Birth Control.Why don't you stick to playing video games??|`|7iMZ91K7aa	this isnt a serious question....you've killed 5 babies?|`|2oc6TDiGaa	wow your such ahorrible person...use protection 4 kids dead already !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!111|`|rFMRgHTdaa	no i cant tell you how bad it feels but i can give you some advice, since its getting expensive try birth control & condoms.|`|ZNhP3mpUaa	you people are all dumb. this is another bullsh!t question to stir the hornets nest... PLEASE DELETE IT!!!|`|iTEf1dP3aa	For mother's day, If I knew who you were, I'd give you 5 mothers day cards and wish you the worst of luck....are you the only idiot that goes down the line giving everyone thumbs down and actually expect a serious answer.....Go get circumsized b ! t c h!!!    Oh yea sure, a co- worker, then just "pretend" this is to her and dont be mad for everyone bashing on you, after all you are the one who posted it!|`|aB2zSt6Vaa	You're a mother to 5 dead children. Instead of worrying about cost maybe you should worry about a more permanent form of birth control, like a hysterectomy, or being responsible enough to use a condom. Post this in women's health, not a pregnancy forum where women are desperately trying to get pregnant or handle their pregnancies.|`|pvH3oHRfaa	I really hope you're joking. You would hope that someone would learn their lesson having had to have one abortion, let alone four.    And maybe you shouldn't ask these sorts of questions in 'pregnancy' since most people who look at these questions are pregnant, have children, or are trying to get pregnant, and we don't want to advise you on your 5th abortion.    BIRTH CONTROL!!!!!|`|871bf9188469fa10404159e74fc6200caa	Why don't you get on birth control that would be a lot cheaper. Your sickning abortions are not birth control, start being responsible.|`|0pPT2HqKaa	I would should stick to the general if it's what your comfortable with. Be more cautious next time and your costs will be cut.    Look at all these haters on here hating you for your abortions. Kudos, for being responsible and not bringing kids in the world you know you can't handle. Unlike many of these haters, who bring in kids which they know they can't afford, they are truly the selfish ones not you.|`|ibWLdXlJaa	First of all you shouldn't be bringing that crap here. Second, karma is a b****. Keep killing babies, esp. when so many can't even get pregnant, she will catch up to you.|`|Z1FdawAOaa	fifth abortion? i would think you would no either NOT to have sex or to use protection.    people these days..|`|6sAbs2iiaa	I think youre a dog and should keep your legs closed instead of killing your baby's . Go to google and to abotion pics and look what you're doing you are not humain.|`|7add460ae24c9452ae87b5a99c5aa756aa	Its not too bad...Ive never heard of someone being put under for it.  You will be fine.|`|HXfHkoSHaa	By now you should be able to do it with no painkillers at all!!!|`|3K7ffKn2aa	wow that's horrible, i hope you are joking. if not condoms and contraceptives are a lot cheaper.|`|KZCrNa7Zaa	Condoms are probably a lot cheaper    Edit: The most amusing part of this all is that no one actually answered the question.  This really isn't a place for Opinions (Even though everyone is more than happy to express theirs) it's a place for answers, opinions aside.|`|oXzHvsBpaa	5 abortions are you serious? How about adoption or keeping your legs closed.|`|ffAmoqFTaa	If you don't mind me asking why have you had so many abortions?  It would be a lot easier to just use birthcontrol.|`|PYySLOw6aa	wow I think you need to get some help as to NOT HAVING SEX ANYMORE!|`|ejHfqSD1aa	This question does not belong here! ABortion is not meant for birth control! You must be heartless to kill 5 of you children!|`|Y7sio6Yhaa	seriously ur gonna get so much crap for this question. and usually i'm not against abortion but i really think you're taking advantage of it, and ur the kind of person that is the reason why people get so much **** for getting one in the first place. learn another way, or stop having sex cuz that really is just wrong. i cant even answer ur question i'm so offended and embarassed for you.|`|kT7GVOosaa	Don't have sex! You have killed 5 Humans! If you are mature enough to have sex you are mature enough to get pregnant. it isn't like anyone has ever made people think sex is only fun and nothing happens because of it. this is really disgusting to me|`|9vgZNLP8aa	What a stupid question! Why are you here? There are pregnant woman and people trying to conceive on here. Nobody wants to hear you talking about murdering your 5th baby like it's nothing!    Stop having sex and killing babies that didn't ask to be made because of your stupid selfish behavior!|`|4uqj8Nf1aa	did u reall think people would anser your questions! come on now!|`|qHAgbuHkaa	Are you F-ING serious? Seriously..are you joking or are you seriously aborting your 5TH BABY? My GOD you make me sick. May God rest your baby's souls in peace. You don't deserve any anesthesia at all. If you don't care about the fact that you're going to have your 5th baby ripped from your body into pieces with pain, why should anyone care about giving you meds for your pain? Worthless piece of **** you are!    EDIT::: So this is for your co-worker huh? Yeah..right..sure it is. Why would you even associate yourself with someone like that if it really truly is about someone else? Why would you even use an ounce of your time trying to help someone have a 5th abortion? I think you are either making this question just for attention, or the question is really about you and now you want to pretend its about someone else. Sicko!|`|e0eb82b689e1db392eb51c89982ed115aa	oh I hope you are just inciting people to get mad at you...    your 5th,, hmmmm I think if you just sniffed some sneezing powder it should slide right outta you.|`|A7J0MHORaa	OMG YOUR ALL SO MEAN!!    Yeah ok she should use contraception saying she has killed BABIES?? That aint true she chose the best option for herself!! Its not even called a baby atm its a foetus!!  She may be a little silly not to get contraception but i bet she has heard it a thousand times!!    Keep the horrible remarks to yourself!! Every1 has their own opions and yes i agree she should have birth control but being horrible?? God thats harsh!!    I knwo their are people trying to get pregnant and i feel for them but not every1 is in that position where they want a baby yet!!     And sorry for those who can't concieve!!    -x-|`|lUO6wLGAaa	This is one of the saddest questions I've ever seen.  To think of how many parents would be thrilled to welcome a baby into the world, and give that baby a nurturing, loving family.      And then there's you.    It may be your legal right in the U.S.A., but that doesn't make it morally right.  You're obviously experienced, so why not use birth control?  Better still, in your case, would be giving up sex altogether.  You're already proving yourself to be too irresponsible to handle it.|`|fE5zMOfJaa	I think even people who are not against abortions would be highly disgusted by you!  You obviously have to be asking this question as a sick joke 'cause no sane human would ever have 5 abortions!  Instead of thinking of the pain you will be in, think of the pain your baby will feel!  But obviously you don't care because you're insane!|`|GPW6HUZFaa	Maybe you should stop having sex.  That would completely cut down your cost.  You're not ready for a baby, you're not ready for sex.|`|T9gaHu1kaa	you dumb ***!  go ask your mom.   there are ppl on here trying to concieve and you come asking this stupid question.|`|atCtfNQyaa	ARE YOU FRICKINE SERIOUS???    how about u just close your legs. or get on birthcontrol. STOP getting pregnant you are killing innocent babies, but thank god they dont haev a mother like you. u r nuts!!|`|WGXdfh22aa	5 abortions!!!!! get your tubes tied. its not a birth control method.|`|2tLEr5i2aa	get the general anaesthetic and next time spend your money on condoms.|`|Hi5h9739aa	probably not bad enough for someone who is on their 5th abortion.  I dont normally judge other ppl but come the F on 5 abortions?

FREE at planned parenthood places. You'd be doing the world a huge favor by not even creating a new life and then killing it.  I don't know that I'd be wanting everyone to know that I've had that many abortions...you'd think you'd learn your lesson. Sex=babies. Condoms=NO babies.|`|kVBDpAMTaa	People like you really make me sick! You are using abortion as a form of birth control. You need to start thinking about someone other than yourself like your child that you are killing. You think you are feeling pain, well the baby has feelings too, just imagine what you are putting them through.|`|Eqln1jmNaa	quit spreading your legs apart so easily and maybe you wouldnt be getting pregnant so damn much.. its sad that there are people like you out there... so get a reality check and use birthcontrol if you cant stop with ur childish ways|`|ldc75vYpaa	murderer|`|ylQPsjNAaa	Do the local and I hope it's the worst pain you ever felt.

Why don't you use birth control and stop killing your own babies. How dumb can someone be and I hope it hurts really bad.|`|a7xuzUPeaa	wow are you serious. 5 abortions. Why would you even come here and ask that. There are soooo many people that try and try to have kids and can't. Here you are just disposing of them like they are trash. You should tell them when you get your last abortion to take all female parts to so you can't get pregnant again. You really don't ever deserve to have children. I hope it hurts like hell this next time!!!!|`|uzCaG1ayaa	I'm going to try and be reasonable about this. I'm not sure that you are going to get your answer on here because everyone is concerned with the fact that you are having your fifth abortion and trying to make you feel bad about it. BUT, you really should realize that abortion is only a last resort and not to be used as birth control. If it's expensive get condoms, that way you can save lives being wasted and save money. IF you are into fate and all that jazz (im not saying you are) then maybe you are meant to have this baby, why else would you get pregnant five times when other people can't even have one?  As for your question:  I've never had an abortion, however i know someone that has had one and chose local. She told me it wasn't good. So my advice is that you should go for general again and make sure you use contraception next time so you don't need to ask this question again.|`|loEiJ241aa	All i have to say is "5TH ABORTION" your nuts. stop having sex then you wont have to have abortions. and the dumb f**k that keeps nocking you up is retarted|`|GQQ9lty3aa	You know whats so great about these questions? The answers. I'm not agreeing that you shouldn't have your head examined, however the recent case of the single Mother who gave birth to 8 babies, is leading to questions of restricting the number of children allowed. Not thinking that it's her right to have as many as she wants. Although, there are many that believe she should have as many as she wants to. Its her body. But, since she is single there's that possibility that she may not be able to care for those children properly and that her case will be one that the People will end up having to financially support through Our taxes.  Your consistent abortion practices are no different than the choice that same Mother has to raise her children.   So, where do we draw the line here? Damned if ya do, damned if ya don't. Not everyone will agree in this 'perfect world', and thats why these debates are so confusing.  But, I would suggest that if you do not want children, then to stop abusing the priviledge to have an abortion ( which I believe should only be used in cases where the Mother's life is at risk, or the Mother was raped and having an unwanted pregnacy. ) Others will beg to differ and see that that is just as 'immoral'.   Safe sex practices are more than just about not getting STD's. It's about responsibility all together.|`|D35xKICoaa	You should get use to it by now rem this is your 5th???????????
mGhzmZC2aa	I didn't really get any signs until my period was due. And then they just felt kind of like PMS. Actually, having said that, my breasts got sore pretty much after ovulation, but they always did, so it was no different. They were perhaps a little more sore than usual, but I didn't think it was worth paying any attention.<br>  I also had cramping a few days after I tested, sort of felt like mild period cramps. I had to keep checking that my period hadn't started after all! Oh yeah, and the other thing was discharge... Loads of it.<br>  <br>  My pregnancy sickness didn't start until about 7 weeks I think.|`|VeuJB4lEaa	i am about 14DPO and i got my faint pos 3 days ago, at the moment i have sore bb's, i am tired during the day whic i got before i got my BFP, i also had a metalic taste in my mouth. at the momen i am gettin cramps on and off, i got concerned but found out they are normal aslong as they dont get painfull!!|`|FKR45WLPaa	I would say about two weeks, they were very similar to my PMS symptoms.  Somehow I just knew that I was pregnant.  I didn't have any unusual cramping, but I did have some pains after about four weeks.  Nothing really bad, just growing pains.|`|R21aV2mLaa	i started getting my signs when i was 5 weeks pregnant and it lasted for 4 months straight!! it sucked it was all day sickness!! i dont ever remember getting crampy! good luck!! :)|`|Cu8svhwAaa	About five weeks I was feeling symptoms and I also got a positive pregnancy test result. Yes, you can get light/moderate cramping about the time your period is supposed to be but not actually get y our period.|`|IjOEpqgOaa	I got my signs when i was about 12weeks, I started getting morning sickness like it was nothing! I was always dizzy, peeing, hot, just not really so good, i got some cramping but nothing too bad it was just gas building up.<br>  <br>  I understand completely! <br>  Congrats to you!
2ObqoJbKaa	I think that you should test again to make sure. The first time you tested, I think you may have tested too early to know for sure. sex two days after your period isn't a very high chance of pregnancy, cuz its not your most fertile time, but it can always happen. You don't have to have any symptoms to be pregnant, especially not this early. I would take another test and then you'll know for sure. good luck.|`|V31Vs0nJaa	id wait a week while  having these symptoms and take another pregnancy test if you dont want to go to the doctor just yet if it still says no then you should go just to make sure.    as for the acne, when im on my period i usually always get 1 bad pimple so.. i dont know, i just dont think its unusual.|`|E1K685ZNaa	well i would only take one after you are late. It could be stress from thinking about it? who knows for sure? take another one just to make sure. it may be nothin. and did he go in you? sorry that could help too.|`|0026bdb79893f6dc16bf106bece79789aa	Having sex two days after your period makes me doubt that you are. In the menstrual cycle, an egg is released about two weeks after the end of a period. Sperm lasts about 72 hours (or three days) in the female body, at which any time you can get pregnant. However, I don't think an egg was released by then, unless you're fairly young and therefore extremely fertile. When you get off of birth control, it can cause your periods to be extremely late, extremely early, disappear for awhile, or all sorts of other things. Take another test in a few days to a week. If your period still hasn't come, it's always a good idea to head to a doctor's office. If you're a minor, check to see if they require a parent or guardian approval if you don't want your parents to find out.|`|Z1FdawAOaa	see a doctor, they will give you an accurate answer.|`|6L4fCcyGaa	when i found out i was pregnant, i had "the cramps" you get before you get your period... it just never came, and at the end of the month i started feeling sick.. .and i had a missed period|`|ltHKURBhaa	Yes you could be pregnant i would retest in a week or so if your period dont come on    good luck|`|87WOSjwgaa	I think you should get another test and take it! You never know. You could possibly be pregnant
xfZWmPJPaa	cleared out my system thats for sure.  didnt have any cramping though, didnt put me into labor either.   although many of my siblings and relatives have used it and worked for them. i think its a 50/50 chance really.   depending on how far you are. 38 weeks is fullterm, but in the end it will be her baby that decides, trust me.  although when the oil was gone and out of my system *along with everything else* i felt really good!! ( and light ) haha  well good luck, its different for everyone, all depends on baby!     -Sarah.xo|`|f46ed724435ac2ee47d248b74aef9b48aa	1.) She is only 38 weeks! I would not even CONSIDER  c/o until 42 weeks and facing induction. There are so many risks associated with having a baby before he/she is ready to come.     2.) Castor Oil can affect the baby and also cause the baby to pass meconium in the womb, which has even more risks.     Instead of c/o and trying to induce a labor that is not ready to start, maybe consider taking some herbal tonics and 5W's to strengthen your uterus and wait for your time to come. Your birth will be much quicker and more enjoyable this way, as well as easier on baby.|`|mVD3TQkFaa	Don't do it people told me to try it when I was overdue I went to 41w2d and went into labor on my own. You are already bearing down during labor and that causes you to move some stool as it is. If she really wants to **** herself in front of all those people tell her to give it a try. Also it can cause stressful contractions for the baby and that alone is not worth it at all. Just tell her to wait the baby will come. It can't stay in there forever right and she has already come so far.|`|y6FAv4bEaa	Make her poo runny so when it comes to pushing the baby she will poop every where!|`|FplTPoAyaa	Maybe it doesn't work for everyone, but it did for me.  My doctor said it was safe (but I was late....I wouldn't drink it unless you are very close to your due date).  He said that many midwives use it to induce labor.  I drank about a tablespoon (it was VERY nasty) and chased it with OJ.  Twelve hours later, my daughter was born.  She was perfectly healthy, there were no complications during labor, and all was well.  of course, you should ALWAYS consult your doctor before doing something like this.  Good luck !|`|MtC3CWZraa	It gives you the craps and that's all it does.|`|cfdooGylaa	Tell her dont do it!! For many of women it doesn't even induce labor! They just sit on the toilet sick all day and its also bad for the baby. A lot of times it causes the baby to pass stool before delivery time!|`|PN7ELn3aaa	Castor oil could make the baby have a premature bowel movement that could make him or her very sick. It can be a dangerous situation.|`|dFOcEmWMaa	i heard it gives you the shits realy bad|`|mc6YtaRbaa	I've heard that all it does is make you sick and the sickness is what actually brings on the labor. I would rather try something more fun like sex to bring on labor!|`|AA11284789	My friend did it and it worked but she regretted it because she had massive diarrhea before and during labor and after.....|`|lWDsDG02aa	http://www.justmommies.com/articles/cast...|`|e0eb82b689e1db392eb51c89982ed115aa	Castor Oil is more dangerous than good. Its a common product to INDUCE vomiting. Thats all it suppose to do, Gives you the pukes and the poops and you are more likely to dehydrate than go into labor. Plus thats not going to be very comfortable to have the Craps while in labor, the doctors wont like it for sure.   The only reason it works on some occasions is that it makes you poop and puke so hard it may kick start your muscles into labor. Why not let nature take its course and tell her dont do that. Its uncomfortable at the least.|`|8eGrFwXQaa	for my sister it didnt make the baby come it just made her poo all over herself.
kBqxRuPLaa	Well, a "sign" of spotting would be the actual spotting. Like the spotting is your sign. So if you're spotting, then you're spotting! There's no other sign clearer than that! How late is your period, if it is? If its been a week or more, yes definitely test. Good luck!
c60d629a9c752c61dbe6a0c1f82dda78aa	It sounds like she is regressing to baby-mode because she knows she will be starting school soon. <br>  <br>  What you need to do is explain to her that only babies still wear diapers and that if she is going to poop/pee in her diapers/pull-ups/panties, you will treat her like a baby.<br>  <br>  Then, follow through. She will think its all fun and games with bottles to drink out of and pacifiers to suck on. But then take both kids to the park and don't let her play because "babies are too little to play at the park". Continue in this fashion with other activities that big girls can do that babies cannot. Make sure to follow through and don't give in to the crying.<br>  <br>  If there is no medical reason behind her bowel controls, the babying during activities will be enough to make her want to be a big kid and use the toilet.|`|iMaTMWMxaa	Awww, sounds like you're having a really tough time. I'm afraid I don't have any advice, as you have obviously tried everything. The only thing I can think of, is to reward your older children with stickers when they use the toilet, and then when they get a certain number, give them a treat. Just do it matter of factly, no great deal.<br>  <br>  Although, if she has a problem, that may not be fair.<br>  <br>  I'm not sure, just wanted you to not feel alone. Maybe try find some other parents who have been through the same thing. x|`|1WBimx1laa	I would whoop her, but if you dont beleive in whoopings then I would let her sit in it until it is very uncomfortable for her and she gets a rash then she will not want her bottom to hurt anymore. If you dont agree with that either then I would suggest sitting her down on the potty and telling her that she can have her favorite candy if she pees or poops on the potty and reward her for doing it, that will make them want to do it more.
b978f631fc787a963337206aa3833370aa	If there were something wrong with him, he'd probably cry for longer than five minutes. Also, check his pupils to make sure they're not dilated. If he starts vomiting, then it's a possible head injury. Otherwise, he's probably fine.     I think my doctor said something like, "I don't think it would be a normal kid if they didn't fall off the bed once!" Your child was likely startled more than anything.     One mother told me her ped said a child can actually fall from several feet before any harm is really done ... sure, that doesn't make us moms feel better LOL but babies are pretty resilient!|`|0nb1rQhnaa	I was super surprised when I read an article once that said that for a fall like that they don't need to go to the ER. As long as he did cry, and calmed down. He really should be ok. Of course watch for sleepyness, and vomiting. But I am sure he's fine.|`|ibWLdXlJaa	How old is he? Just check him over and if there isn't any bumps or bruises don't worry. I made the mistake of putting my son in bed with me to breastfeed. I was exhausted and I could have swore I put him back in his bed. If I did then I got him back out and don't remember. At any rate I woke up to his crying and when I got up to get him he was on the floor. He cried for a few minutes but he was fine. If he is acting normal I wouldn't worry but if not or you are still worried call your doctor.|`|BW7Nrqjzaa	My son rolled of a hotel bed at 5 months old. My husband has put him in the middle and walked away why I was in the shower. He ended up with a black eye from the post on the bed. And we were 10 hours from home... He was fine though. He cried for about 5 minutes and then was back to being himself.      I would just watch for signs of sleepiness or vomiting, which are the two biggest signals of a concussion.    You could also call his pediatrician and see what he says.     Good luck!|`|Zl3re1Vhaa	Call your pediatrician and let them know what happened and his reaction to it and see what the Dr thinks you should do if you're really concerned it happened with my daughter when she was 3 months old and her Dr said to keep her awake and check her pupils|`|925b8594ae5633969b8af717d31ecb54aa	Take him to the hospital. Just for your peace of mind it's best to have him checked out. Dont be afraid that they will call you a bad mother, they won't.|`|I3V7hE32aa	If he stopped crying he should be fine.  Try moving all of his limbs and gently push on his stomach and back.  If he doesn't cry, there is probably no issues.    However, you may want to call your doctor, just to be sure.  He could have hit his head, and I have no idea how you could tell if he would have a concussion or not.  I'm not trying to scare you, but it's always best to check everything.|`|qStmw7qgaa	Does he have any bumps?  bleeding?  did you see how he landed?  How old is he?  and how far of a fall?  If you are super worried, call your dr. But kids and babies fall all the time.  If he is acting fine now, that I really wouldn't be worried.  Just give him extra love.  If he is not acting like his wonderful normal self, then take him in.|`|7RhXX7qfaa	get off YA and look after your child!!  we are not doctors ring NHS direct if your worried but if he is acting normal and not bleeding or constantly falling asleep he is probably fine.  this doesn't make you a bad mother accidents happen, but I think you shouldn't ask people you don't know for medical advice.|`|aba81bf0dd1e368904161a0c15faf44caa	I would give my pediatrician a call and ask for advice.  Chances are, you won't need to take him in, but it is better to be safe than sorry.    Sounds like he is okay though, since he cried and then calmed down pretty quickly.  He probably just scared himself silly.    You didn't mention how old he is, but the younger the baby, the more critical the fall, since their brain has some room to move in their skulls for a while after they are born.  However, if he is old enough to roll around on his own, he probably doesn't have the wiggle room in his head that really young babies do have.    Hope he's okay though!  Keep us posted!    If it makes you feel any better, I was tickling my daughter the other night from one side of my in-law's bed and she rolled over and off their bed.  It is one of those super high ones.  She rolled to the edge and just disappeared!  She cried for a few minutes, but then was fine.  She is almost three though, so not really a "baby".  I felt really guilty though...|`|AA11296044	He cried and calmed, he is fine.    If he begins to vomit or you see a change in personality, take him to the ER, otherwise he is fine.    At some point almost all parents have a little oops where baby manages to wiggle off something, you are not a bad mother, it happens.|`|9kMJJ1giaa	You did not include enough information for anyone to give you GOOD advise.  You didn't tell how old he is, or what part of his body hit the floor.  I am worried too!  Accidents happen, to the best of parents.  DO NOT be afraid to go get him checked out by a doctor.  An ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure.|`|RuHtOvnJaa	dont worry u are not a bad mother wen my son was 4 months old i put him in his pram and walked away for a second i was so sleep deprived that i forgot to strap him in and he slid out and fell on the floor i felt like such a bad mother it was awful . i took him to hospital and they reassured me that i wasnt a bad mother and it happens to the best of mothers atlest once my son had a little bruise onn his hed he cryed but stoped after hundreds of cuddles and kisses as i smothered him with them afterwards. if he had a cry but stopped after about 5 to 10 mins he should be fine aslong as he seems his normal happy self now|`|MtU2yH3gaa	First off, you are not a bad mother...any parent knows that kids can do things in a seconds time! The same thing happened with my daughter and I felt terrible, but she calmed down and ended up being ok. You could call his doctor and let them know, they will tell you if you need to take him to the hospital or have him seen. You should also watch for vomiting and sleepiness, because those things could mean concussion. Just keep an eye out on him and give your dr a call just for your reassurance! Good Luck with it!|`|upldz6oPaa	Do not bring them to the hospital unless the irritability continues or you are unable to wake him. Call your ped if a bump develops. Your little boy can get very sick from the hospital. It's so much better to keep him home than risk things like RSV!|`|AjqO1aJgaa	No, don't take him to the hospital unless you think he is sick - i.e. he continues to be not himself.    We've just had a hospital administrator on the news BEGGING people not to bring their healthy babies in "just to be sure" - because there's a serious risk that they will catch something really nasty from the actual sick people in the waiting room!
3K7ffKn2aa	no, babies around that age do things to see whats the best way to get what they want. I say put him somewhere safe until the tantrum stops and then pick him and love on him. That way he learns when i scream and shout with mommy i won't get what i want but when i calm down get faster results. What you teach him now is what he will keep for future references and its easier to break habits at 6 months vs a year. Children are smarter than people give them credit. they know who they can act a fool with and who will make them behave.    Do your own thinking: you don't let a child cry when you know they are in pain or hungry but if they are just acting because they want their way thats another story. It doesn't make anyone a bad parent because they choose not to let their child run the house. A baby (newborn) and a toddler/child (6months and up) have completely different comprehensive standards.  Lets get real he cant say im hungry but your 6month old can go to his bag and get a bottle if thats what he wants. And if he doesn't want to be in the swing he can just fuss a little be to get his point across not flail about until he hurts his self.   Its easier to give into your children then to actually teach them to behave the way they should.|`|UghJ0XROaa	I agree with my Brooklyn, people assume that babies don't know what they are doing and don't try to "manipulate" people. If by throwing a little baby tantrum at this age gets him what he wants from you, but not from daddy, then by the time he gets older, he will throw temper tantrums for you, but no so much for dad. They develop habits now, and letting him do that is going to teach him bad habits for getting the results he wants. Make sure he is somewhere safe obviously, and just let him calm down and then figure out what he wants.     Distraction with another toy, which DID NOT work for my daughter, you can attempt the sling method or ask Nana to give him more floor time, instead of carrying him all the time.|`|toOzi7aLaa	No. People often underestimate there children. He knows what he is doing.     This works for me!    1. DO not give in to bad behavior.     2. Attempt to distract him with another toy or something okay for him to play with.    3. If nothing works let him cry. Show him that you will not accept temper fits!     As for the Nana i have had that problem with my hubby. If i went out or if we all went shopping he would always want to hold the baby. Then when it came time for me and him alone he would expect the same thing and be unhappy when he wasn't held.    That is just proof infants know about cause and effect.     If he keeps with the temper fits check out Autism because the banging of the head is a sign of that.|`|PwrF9OtWaa	my son has been doing this since about six months also.   when i take something away from him i say "no!" to get him used to the word so he'll learn what it means. he looks at me and yells or cries for a second until i distract him with something acceptable to play with and then he's happy again!    you just have to redirect his attention and don't give in.  distract him when he's having a fit: make funny faces, noises, laugh, tickle him and make him forget why he was mad--- but don't give him what he wants!|`|mlT1ZrZtaa	just leave him to calm down before you go and see to him no no one is to young to thro a tantrum just get on your knees to his leval and say what would you like to do if he wants the laptop sit with him whilst you are there babys like to no wjhat is going on around them put him on the swing at litely push him and walk him regually sometimes when a baby after a baby has teethed it hurts i hope this helps if you are still worried call the doctoe just to make sure  x|`|BUCwZYnzaa	yes he is spoiled. 6 month is the age where they can start to be spoiled talk to nana and see waht she is doing. and tell her not to be picking him up every time he cries. no he is not to young to be having a meltdown. i have 3 kids and they all started to go thorugh this. i just put them in their bed and let them cry. and that is what you should do. just let him cry it out. yes kids are usually buttholes when they are teething i like to freeze a washcloth and give it to him|`|ANHsv4ENaa	Well we see those as "little things" because we have the perspective to know that there are far worse things in the world than having a toy taken from us. He doesn't know that. He thinks it's AWFUL and mean and doesn't understand why. He thinks you are doing those things just because you can, not because you have a good reason. He is telling you in the only way he can that he is upset about it. It's not a tantrum, he's trying to communicate with you and at this point it's not like he can say, "Excuse me but I want to play with that," or "Please, don't put me down, I really need to be cuddled right now." He needs you to be reassuring and hold him as much as he wants so he knows you are there for him. Get a baby sling so he can be carried even if you have chores to do. If you meet his needs now he will be more independent later. If you take something from him tell why even if you think he doesn't understand it's a good habit and he will understand one day. Distract him with a toy of his own too. He is so young right now and just starting to express himself, be sensitive to him and understand that he doesn't know right or wrong or think about manipulating you, he's just trying to tell you that he has wants and needs.|`|aJLx0nhNaa	I don't think he's spoiled, babies just get frustrated sometimes.  I mean, it's not as if when he doesn't feel like being in his swing, he can just ask you politely to take him out.  Or unbuckle himself and wander out.  So if he doesn't want to be in the swing, he uses the only tools at his disposal to communicate this to you.  Crying and fighting it with his body.  To me, a temper tantrum is when an older child, who either can fix the problem themselves, or can explain what it is that's bothering them, decides to just a pitch a fit instead of doing either of those things.    He does sound a little high-spirited, but I don't think that means he's spoiled, or going to be spoiled.
W1p6LetFaa	Are you due the 23rd? Cuz I sure am!  Anyway, I am pretty sure that the shooting pain is actually your little one's head "bopping" up against your cervix.  PAINFUL.  But actually good, because the pressure should be helping you to dilate/efface.  <br>  <br>  The cramping is also normal, but if it comes and goes you should start timing it.  At this point, I pretty much have a constant dull cramp (feels a lot like a period cramp but not as strong) and it doesn't mean anything, considering that as of Monday I was only finger-tip dilated and not effaced at all.  It depends how strong your cramping is.  If it's strong, you might be in a whole different ball-game than me!  Call your doctor if you are concerned that the cramping might actually be labor, but I'm pretty sure you will KNOW when it's the real thing.  <br>  <br>  Best wishes to you and your little one!!|`|KNxs4PrZaa	pretty normal, the baby is dropping lower into position and there is alot of pressure on your cervix right now, if you are worried check with your doctor, otherwise get some rest it wont be long now.|`|W4J7Ary0aa	I have that too and asked my doc they say that it is your pelvic bone moving since it apparently has to open a little to let the baby out. It is so painful though and I can't beleive that we are supposed to feel that way. I am clueless about labor pains as well I get severe cramping in my lower abdomen but very irregular. I am 40 weeks and 2 days I give it till Monday at my next appointment and I am calling it quits and asking to be induced. This is too much for me right now.  GL|`|d1df7701087311fcf1008982d372a396aa	it's probably the early signs of labor, or the weight of the baby putting pressure on your pelvic bone. Good luck!|`|J3yUXKiyaa	Very normal.  You're in the final countdown - baby and your body are just getting ready for the main event.  Expect more of this to come before labour hits.  You're close.

AA11283706	The clearblue fertility monitor is the BEST, but around $190. Perhaps if you try ebay you can get a good deal. I know it's expensive, but it's something you will have for years. It is so worth it. They are really accurate, and much better at tracking your cycles. Once you are past the initial cost, you just have to buy the test sticks that come in a package of 30.<br>  Best of Luck!|`|WBw9lDG8aa	the digitle one is b-cuz it tells u straight up yes or no...

Some men are completely sterile.<br>  <br>  There are other drugs you can take to help with fertility... metformin isn't the only one, so talk to your fertility specialist about another option. There are also drugs available to help raise your husband's sperm count. So that will probably be the first route the fertility docs will take.<br>  <br>  As someone already said, don't have sex every day - try to go every 48 - 72 hours to give his sperm some time to 'build up'.<br>  <br>  If the drugs don't work, you can try artificial insemination. <br>  <br>  If that fails, you can try In Vitro Fertilization, which has a much higher success rate than artificial insemination.

JEnsHADCaa	Ah the sky is the limit, during pregnancy! First, yes, the sensation could very well be Braxton-Hicks or simply a gas bubble that settled and started moving when your baby started moving again.     Second, Braxton-Hicks, false contractions, will mimic real contractions almost identically, but in my experience where never equal times apart...I was never able to count them down as I was the real contractions. They just sort of came and went on and off as they saw fit.    Something else you might consider, as your baby grows and begins to take up more and more of mommy's interior...he/she is pushing vital organs, nerves and muscles out of their normal positions, this alone can create pain especially in the lower back and legs.     Please be sure that you stay hydrated and maintain your health with nutiritious foods and prenatal vitamins as prescribed...if you continue to have this discomfort on a regular basis then at least put a call into your physician...let them decide based on your pregnancy history and current and past health issues whether to be concerned or not.     There are no silly questions, if you don't know the answers, your doctor will not mind talking to you about this!    Hope this helps.|`|jLNwrVZRaa	Because you are at 22 weeks I would say that what you are feeling are you ligaments stretching.  I had the same thing when I was pregnant.  If they become very painful then I would call your OB/GYN, other than that I think you are ok.|`|lc57ntoFaa	Babies have a sleep period in the womb, for about 30 min-1hr. And you not being able to feel her move, could have just been her sleeping, or maybe your mind was somewhere else. Normally if you count less than 10 different movements in an hr time period, you should see your doc. As far as the pain, it could be braxton hicks. Which is nothing serious. It's just your uterus getting ready for the real deal. Orr it could be the baby adjusting. Make sure at your next doc appt. let him/her know your concerns. They'll probably stick you on the heart monitor, and that usually monitors the movement in your uterus too. (if it contracts or not). Webmd is the shiznit, here's a helpful link too.     http://www.webmd.com/baby/guide/true-fal...  http://www.webmd.com/baby/fetal-movement...    Good luck! Oh if it really bothers you, try a 24/7 nurse adivce call line.  Usually the hospital near you would have one, so you'd have to google it.|`|FplTPoAyaa	Call your doctor.  I was freaked out almost my entire pregnancy about things like this, and I worried my poor doctor to tears.  But its okay ! You are paying that doctor ! That's what they are there for.  You may feel badly to "bother" him, but he truly won't mind if he's a good doctor.  I had pains like you described, and mine were stretching pains.  Maybe yours are the same thing, but call your doctor anyway...it will make you feel better.  Good luck to you.|`|Y7sio6Yhaa	dont read so much into things, at the most their braxton hicks contractions, the very least it's from you stretching out.. chill|`|mlAI5S5Eaa	they could be false contractions. its very possible or the baby could just be moving around and kicking. either one of those is very possible|`|CsLyyRQeaa	Some times the baby will move in ways that hurt.  they Can kick your cervix or your ribs.  Also your body is always preparing.  It could be just a little cramp.  If it continues then talk to your doctor.  Try not to worry to much.  Enjoy this time because it goes by so fast.|`|4XfjUcvDaa	its probably just the baby moving around.
SAMRKyZsaa	True ADD is a chemical in balance and vitamin won't help.  I do agree that meds are not the answer alone.  Meds calm them down but they need to go to therapy and learn how to deal with it.  There are some good books.   The organized student  The ADD child  That give you techniques but you do this while they are on meds.    They should not be on meds forever no more than a year or two .|`|ZcrsqMbcaa	fish liver oils help in some children..but thats the omega 3 factor ..The B 12 & B Complex help with brain function and nervousness|`|lGKq9NXbaa	you should really reconsider the meds. vitamins are the same, they are good in small amounts but bad in bulk. If you don't put her on meds she's going to suffer in school. trust me, it sucks not being able to focus. I went to school with a girl who had ADD and she just decided one day to stop taking her meds. She became hyper, and her grades dropped dramatically. Talk to her pediatrician about some medication with minimum sidde effects.|`|FvYqKZSMaa	Actually there is my little cousin takes them.I can not remember what they are called.And I used to be on one when I was younger.|`|jLYTKr33aa	I would speak to your child's doctor about it.  Some people use such things as St. John's Wort to treat ADD, but you should NEVER give your child a new vitamin without consulting a medical professional.  Keep in mind that true ADD is very real.  There is no shame in getting her on medication if it would help her.  After all, you wouldn't deprive her of allergy medicine if she had allergies, would you?  There are also some non - stimulant ADD medications now that you might be interested in considering.  *ETA* Actually, NCISrock, TRUE ADD can be detected via MRI: http://www.healing-arts.org/children/ADH...  There was also a time when cancer didn't have a name - are you going to try to use that as proof that it doesn't exist?  You had a negative experience with the medicine, but it can be helpful for many individuals when used in conjunction with other methods to help manage symptoms.|`|gJlxZdL5aa	I would get a second and 3rd opinion.    Almost every kid has ADD these days and they most likely don't.  I mean I think alot of it is kids aren't allowed to be creative or daydream or just be kids anymore.    I was diagnosed with ADD when I was 11 years old.  (Because I would daydream and draw pictures in class) well the medicine took a toll on me.   And I feel to this day it weakened my heart.   I'm 23 now and I no longer take the medication.    It also suppressed my appetite I became real thin.  I couldn't sleep I was awake all the time.  I actually became hyper on the medicine.    So by all means if there is a natural alternative go for it.....I don't want my kids to ever be on that medicine either.    It causes too many problems      Funny how ADD and ADHD didn't exist until about 15 to 20 years ago and now every child seems to have it?   Something is a little off there don't you think|`|AA12174100	My son has it too and we have heard of fish oil pills and giving them a half cup of coffee in the morning and after school. The meds seem to be the only thing that works. He takes Concerta. It does not make him drowsy or all doped up, just seems to be calmer to be able to function in school and sports.  good luck, its a tough road. I hope you find what works for your child, whether it be meds or something else.

But no i don't think it will get better on its own, most likely only worse. You would have to stop re-enforcing the tantrums, usually by waiting until he has calmed down before you give him what he is asking for, to eliminate the behavior. But it will probably get worse before its better.
75c40712ce4c1c9063d61b17387937f9aa	if your gonna be honest with anyone, it should be the dr. the type of birth control pill she would put you on depends on your reasons for needing it. there are SSOOO many types of BCPs out there and they all do slightly different things. one helps clear up acne, one helps with the length and severity of your periods. so please please! tell her the truth. in Ohio the Dr is not allowed to discuss anythin with your parents without your permission, its called HIPPA. see if its active where you are. girls are able to come and see a GYN without an adult. call your local GYN and see what kinda of privacy they do there, but please don't lie to the Dr. :)<br>  also, if you are under 18 or are not yet sexually active, you should not need a PAP done to discuss BCP. ask when you call to make your appt.|`|vKEYa8aeaa	you have got to get a pap smear to get put on the pill. you have to see a gynecologist if your family doctor doesnt also preform OBGYN services<br>  <br>  EDIT: well every doctor i have talked to has said you have to have a papsmear first, and everyone i know who was put on BC had to get one. i even got mine at planned parenthood and they made me get one. if you are a virgin they use a small speculum is what i have been told.|`|tAZe8XJsaa	Yeah, it's not as if your doctor will ever find out. Just say you're in a serious relationship. Warning, though, it will most likely make you put on weight,|`|Eg1G2mvVaa	You should tell the truth, they will provide it anyway.  Have you though of going to your local family planning clinic, they may be able to provide you with more information and there is still no age limit.  Have you considered the contraceptive injection, you would only need it every 3 months and it is more reliable than the pill.  If you go to the family planning clinic they should go through all of the options with you.|`|dnG7fhnbaa	Tell the truth...I think s/he will actually respect you for admitting that you want it for birth control, it's a very grown up decision and makes you so much more mature than all those kids having unprotected sex.  Although you will be advised to use condoms as well. The pill isn't 100% effective (I personally know three people who have got pregnant whilst on the pill) and, as I'm sure you know, it doesn't protect you against STDs.<br>  <br>  Don't worry the doctor can't breech patient confidentiality so s/he can't tell your parents that you're on the pill. x|`|DF6ihDDCaa	The doctors probably wont care as much<br>  as your parents because<br>  they have to know either way. <br>  Try Planned parenthood if you dont want them<br>  to know|`|Zl3re1Vhaa	Just call and schedule an appointment and you should always be completely honest with your dr to get proper medical care|`|Ze0XaOwnaa	Don't lie to the doctor. Think of it this way : What happens in the doctors office, stays in the doctors office. Your doctor has no right to share anything you've told him/her to the public, so its not a good idea to lie to your doctor. Tell the complete truth about everything. Even ask him/her your questions/concerns, your doctors not going to like, laugh in your face or anything.<br>  Just make a regular appointment. Everything will go fine.<br>  Good Luck :)|`|1iDSGET4aa	I went on the Pill at 15, and I just went to the doctor and told her I wanted to go on because my cycle was so messed up and I wanted some control (they used to be really heavy & painful) so I could make sure I wasn't 'on' when I was on a water-sports holiday. I didn't need a pap smear or anything, I just had to make sure I went for regular check-ups to make sure everything was OK. The doctor asked if I was sexually active and I told her I wasn't, and she said it wasn't a problem. I don't think it's really worth lying; the doctor isn't going to judge you if you tell them it's for birth control|`|ErCJnABBaa	You DO realize that the pill is NOT 100% effective, especially if you don't take it properly every single day... something that is less likely to be happening if you have having to hide the fact from your parents.<br>  <br>  And BTW, it does NOTHING for sexually transmitted diseases.<br>  <br>  Bottom line, the PILL isn't meant to be a free ride to teen sex.  It's best used by married couples.|`|upK8oN2oaa	Tell the truth. Your doctor must keep everything confidential. Tell him/her the exact reason you want the pill, if its for periods then say so. My sister takes the pill for exactly that reason and she has never had sex.<br>  <br>  You will only need a pap-smear once you are sexually active. The doctor will explain all this when they prescribe you the pill.|`|m3rsLUgDaa	in England you can get the pill and you can lie but there's no need to, no you wont get a pap smear, my god ive been begging for one because i feel i need one (i have pain etc) but they said they cant give me one till im 25!!! total BS, so they wont give you one. i don't know if your in America though?|`|FR4fzr4Zaa	well u can jus book a doctors appointment n then if u r embarrased about goin on the pill you can saii that you would like to go on the pill becoz of ur periods as it helps yuu bleed less and it also helps you so you dont get pregnant <br>  <br>  hope this helps<br>  <br>  -x|`|ULo8Cwdfaa	What ever you tell the doctors about personal things are confidential so if you told them you are having sex or that's what you want it for then they can't go tell your parents. Just tell them the truth they won't care.|`|YuqTcSSDaa	be honest with your doctor. If you lie, you will lose trust with your doctor.|`|g2ZQ4Qzjaa	im 16, nearly 17. and i went on the pill about a month ago, i went to the doctor, just made a normal appointment and asked if it was possible to go on the pill as i have painful periods, which yes is true. but it was also so that i don't get pregnant i just felt comfortable  leaving that out. the only thing my doctor asked if i had a boyfriend. she didn't ask anything about sex.|`|awA3KFsGaa	you dont need a pap to go on the pill [i started when i was 15] .... (at least in america) i'm on the pill and i didnt even need to take my clothes off..... i got it for menstrual reasons though... keep in mind you shouldnt lie to your doc. there there to help and they wont tell ur parents|`|HaeYC2p8aa	No, don't lie or you could get the wrong thing and doctors have to keep it confidential anyway. Just be honest and say that you want the pill for birth control and don't lie about your age or anything else.
MrNkNnhyaa	i am in gymnastics and have been for six years,i felt th same way my first day,but trust me,the other kids if it's their first time then they feel the same way you do,and if some are better so what,thats why you go,to learn.<br>  <br>  have fun when you go.:]|`|V6EgDitqaa	You're scared they'll be better than you? That's nothing to <br>  worry about. If your mom/dad/parent signed you up for a<br>  beginners class, then everyone else will probably be<br>  first-timers, too. Inhale and exhale deeply to keep your nerves<br>  calm. That's what I do all the time.|`|AA10034455	I felt the same way when I went to my dance class for the first time.  The worst part is that I'm the oldest in the class.  I'm not the best either, but I looked confident and had fun.  I learned new things and I still am learning new things from it.<br>  Just think.  Everyone else has been doing this for a long time.  You're not gonna be as good as they are at your first class.  So look confident, feel confident, and try your best.  And who cares if youre not as good as everyone else?  Try to impress yourself.  Not everyone else.  And have fun.  Good lukk!|`|vUqf6mHqaa	dont worry they will probably be as nervous as you are.
qStmw7qgaa	I nice dress or pant suit.  Try not to wear black or white.  Black, for the obvious reason of it is a happy occasion, and white because the baby will be in white.  Calming colors are always a plus.  Christenings are happy occasions, or color is always great.  A light purple or blue would be really pretty depending on your coloring.  :-)  Good Luck!|`|vue9NOhYaa	Something nice.  The same sort of outfit you'd wear to church.|`|rFMRgHTdaa	Well maybe a nice dress would be nice, make sure that it is not too revealing and not to short, also make sure it is flattering to your figure.
gl4DFLVGaa	I absolutley love the name Layla! It's awesome! And yes, it does seem to really fit you!<br>  <br>  Now as for Karen, I do like this name. Layla would be #1 when Karen would be #5. My friends mom's name is Karen.<br>  <br>  Layla Karen-That's a cute name!!!<br>  <br>  Both of these names are wonderful!|`|hZjPYyFTaa	Names that end in A are the best. More lyrical and feminine.

2ed5c5743ec637190dff1ac2f92e4f0aaa	Hmm... Well, you might want to go to your doctor, ob, or the best option would be a local health department (since most of the services there are free or on a sliding scale, that way if you aren't you won't have wasted money).  They can do a blood test to test for pregnancy.  Even if you took a home test, you're probably too early to show positive yet.<br>  <br>  Normally, those symptoms shouldn't come this early, but everyone is different.  Also, I wouldn't be too worried about the bleeding.  I had some break through bleeding the first couple of months in to mine.|`|Rlm7VjeEaa	I'd wait a little longer. It would be too soon for a home pregnancy test. A doctor may be able to tell you this early.|`|PLbmKNpvaa	We can only tell you if there is the possibility that you're pregnant. Going by the dates that you give, it is possible. Asking on Y!A won't get you anywhere unfortunately. Take another test in 2-4 weeks time and see what you get.|`|IjOEpqgOaa	You're having signs of period. Maybe this time you're period was just acting funny. <br>  But just in case wait it out a little bit & take another one<br>  <br>  I think you're just fine tho!<br>  <br>  Good luck|`|fRBZSVvIaa	If your on birth control that's why it's happening.

e0eb82b689e1db392eb51c89982ed115aa	yes very possible. You are very fertile after a miscarriage|`|o8xNTVWTaa	iam pretty sure u can|`|Z1FdawAOaa	yes your fertile after a miscarriage.|`|H0fXySX9aa	you can ovulate 2 weeks after a miscarrige so yes you can hence why they say wait a full cycle|`|cBMwHdn4aa	I believe so.  Your ovaries are at work as usual even though your womb/uterus may not be.      After giving birth women are especially fertile, this is because the cervix is still partially open, for one.  If you've miscarried then that doesn't apply.    What are your symptoms?  If you've already tested again and the test was + it could mean that you still have the HCG, pregnancy, hormone in your system from the previous pregnancy and you really aren't pregnant. It takes a little while for the hormone to be fully removed from your body.    Good Luck and sorry to hear of your misfortune.|`|373b04f6dbf649a6ef357e85b32df3e4aa	Yes I miscarried in Sept 08 and found out I was pregnant Oct 08.    Unfortunatly I miscarried that baby too at 19 weeks pregnant. So I am hoping I can become pregnant again asap.    If the miscarriage was fairly late 12+ weeks, then you could still get positives from that pregnancy.    I lost my baby 1 week ago today and my tests are still positive :(    Good luck xx|`|AA11099963	I believe so, yes.|`|Q0DLGuGwaa	yes of course this happened to me and im now 13 weeks pregnant tomz take a test when your period next due and good luck|`|YuA7a08Maa	Yes, you can get pregnant whenever you ovulate.  A lot of times, you'll ovulate shortly after a miscarriage.  It's your body's way of getting back to normal.  Good luck!|`|ADjeuxIiaa	Yes. Same when dealing with a full delivery. Once the fetus is out of the uterus, your body is extremely susceptible to another pregnancy since it already has pregnancy hormones circulating.|`|3lP5M6zwaa	very possible.

2451MT2Haa	The mother i nanny for had the same thing happen to her accually. She also had a C-section. Her pregnancy went well, she had a scheduled C-section which you probably will too since the births are so close together. It wasnt her initial plan, but she tells me all the time that she wouldnt change it for the world. She loves that the kids are close in age, and personally i do too. isabel just now turned one (i cant believe it) and Roman just turned 2, they are just precious together. Delivery went well with isabel, no complications. They went throught the same incision as the first c-section. She said her 2nd c-section was a bit easier on her body than the 1st, she could walk with the second, but couldnt walk without bending forward in the first. Your partner if you have one will have to step up a ton when the baby is born, you are going to need rest and taking care of 2 babies after a major surgery isnt going to be easy on your body. Just make sure you take it easy while recovering. Im sure it will end up wonderful! Congratulations on your recent arrival and on your upcoming!!!|`|jgtfWjE4aa	stay strong!|`|4jeqIx6Paa	Oh GOSH! GOODLUCK honestly ! i couldnt or wouldnt wanna be pregnant right after giving birth thats a hell no !

Hi5h9739aa	I would get baby monitors for their room and put a gate at the top of the stairs.  Talk to them about waking up in the night and if they need you to call through the monitor.  You will probably have to tell them that a few times before they get it but they will.|`|DDFSITiYaa	The best way to safety proof them is to teach them. At 2 and 3 they should be able to navigate stairs.  If they have never learned, now is a good time to teach them.  Allow them lots of practice.  They are eventually going to have to go up and down the steps freely.     Now, even if they are good at stairs, I understand your concern over them wandering the house.  You can install a baby gate at the top of the steps or if that isn't possible, you can put a pressure baby gate where their doorway is.  Teach them to call out to you when they need you.|`|mPTBU0QDaa	This may not be the most fun option, but you and your husband could sleep in one of the bedrooms upstairs. The master could still be your bedroom but you could just stick an extra bed up there, that way at night they wouldn't have to go down the stairs. It will only be for a couple years, at most.     You should probably have a child-proof gate at the top no matter what. Also, put a rug a the bottom of the steps, in case they do slip and fall.    I do think it is important for them to learn how to sleep alone and to spend some time in their rooms. My sister has a 2-year-old and a 3-year-old, and they both have bedrooms upstairs. The 3-year-old goes up and down the stairs without too much trouble, and the 2-year-old has been taught to walk or crawl up the stairs and then turn around and slide down backwards to go back down. She's really good at it. You could carpet your stairs, too. Kids are going to fall sometimes! It is okay. I am glad you are careful, but if you practice with them, they can get quite good at steps.|`|m2aznd8xaa	well if your cocerned about the night time mainly  then get  a baby gate only for night time that way when they wake up at night they have to call out for you for what ever they may need.they would have no choice but to call out for you.also make sure the stairs are well lite at night .  make sure there are well built banisters and encourage them always to grab them no matter how well they go up and down.  if  you have been living there a while now and they are used to the stairs than they should be okay but if you feel nervous about it just get a gate .they sell gates you dont have to attatch to the wall perminatlly you can remove them in the morning. they are pressure mounted ones.you can get one at toys r us and babies r us.and are cheep.  i have a first step brand .they also have fisher price ones too. mother knows best so if your worried for there safety a gate is the best bet. and enjoy decorating that room for them.they can still have there own room and be safe at nite. good luck.and give them there room you so want them to have. get that gate and youll sleep better.|`|uiOFJasoaa	baby gates!!|`|AA11327039	As long as they can climb up and down the stairs they should be fine.  The only problem with stairs is when they are goofing off and playing/roughhousing, etc.  In the middle of the night, they will be so tired they will basically just inch down the stairs one at a time.
jYPeis3Saa	i think you're a troll.<br>  <br>  but anyway.<br>  <br>  it starts getting thicker when they start eating solids.|`|IXBl5l5kaa	When you offer solids the poops will change dramatically, especially if you have a breastfed baby. You'll LOVE those exclusive breastfed poops when solid food poops come along. My daughter is 7 months old and has been introduced to carrots, banana, avocado, sweet potato and apple sauce. She actually poops less now, like every 2 days, but it's normal. Just a good explosive poop comes out, or i'll get like 3 or 4 poops in a 3 hour period like I did the other day lol.<br>  <br>  <br>  **The poops aren't like what you and I know... they're just thicker and more smelly than they used to be heh.|`|TVC3mAP7aa	If you're breastfeeding, it won't turn into "normal", stinky poo until after you start solids (usually around 6 months).  It will also get thicker if  you use formula.  It is thought that it doesn't actually hurt babies to poop, but it is a sensation that they aren't accustomed to, so a newborn may experience some discomfort while having a BM.  They should outgrow that discomfort after a month or two.  If discomfort is caused by gas, you could try Mylicon drops or gripe water.|`|ev8ZZYx2aa	How old is the baby? What does the baby drink or eat? If the stools are soft and mushy then it does not hurt them. They do not need anything to help.|`|NvrVjOhBaa	When they start eating whole foods and not baby food. It does not hurt them, but it is uncomfortable if they are constipated just like us, so avoid dairy.|`|qQJdi0p1aa	when you start to feed them formula or solids....or cereal! there is a medicine called little tummy's and it works really well|`|BR4c4GGIaa	Jonathan L shut up that is a normal question to ask.<br>  <br>  My son is 6 months.  I started feeding him baby food when he was 4 months.  It started getting thicker right away.<br>  It is really hard for my son to poop so when it does happen feed your baby prunes or put some pear juice in your babies bottle And give your baby just a lil water.<br>  Those things will help.|`|nyuB4POqaa	when you start introducing cereals and other foods
4hNdYjjraa	spotting is dribbles in the undies and like a stain. just a patch, but sometimes it can be a quarter of what a period is, and that is a bit more blood than expected. period is defiantly heavy or decent enough to be irritating. spotting isn't so messy. congrats for starting a family. good luck.|`|IGcS9K62aa	Your period has to regulate itself out. So it's probably another period. I'd wait for the next one and see. In the mean time just prepare yourself for pregnancy. No drugs/alcohol/cigarettes. Start taking prenatals. =) All that good stuff!!|`|bWyKAFwuaa	When I went off my bc I bled on and off for ever!!!!! like 5 days off 10 days on, two weeks off, three days on etc
5ULJZsqpaa	Kids at school...<br>  <br>  If a 9 year old is telling her that it's normal for little kids to have sex, he needs to be spoken to. He's either been abused in some form which led him to think of child sex as normal, or he's an enormous troublemaker bully, or both. Either way that kid has issues that need to be sorted pronto. Talk to the school, or have the parents of either child talk to the school for his sake if nothing else. And I hate to say it, but brace yourself for the possibility she's lying about this kid. It may be that one of these kids learned about sex from someone else entirely, if you understand me. If so then that situation obviously needs to be identified and dealt with ASAP.<br>  <br>  And as far as breaking it to the mother goes, all you can really do is tell it straight, but with tact. You know her better than we do. <br>  <br>  I can't completely rule out the thought that I might have done the same when I was that age. I had a "boyfriend" at age 6, so I thought we had to kiss each other. I'm glad to say we chickened out, but the thought was there. Even at that age there were playground rumours about sex and what exactly it was, don't be surprised that little kids have at least some idea. <br>  <br>  These kids need to have it explained really clearly that they shouldn't be doing that, at age 6 "sex is something that only mummies and daddies should do" could even suffice. But I'm sure you knew that. <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  And, look after yourself, hey? Don't work yourself into a breakdown. Little kids lack understanding of these things, they would not have been thinking about sex like an older child or adult would. Try not to let this upset you too much, kids experimenting with sex isn't that uncommon.|`|cscNhn5Qaa	Wow.<br>   I actually can't believe what you are saying.<br>  And well the best way to tell the mother is exactly how you are<br>  explaining it right now.<br>  Children learn things at such a young age nowadays<br>  so dont be surprised that a 9 year old told "lilly."|`|uxOxkyEGaa	Omg. Just break it to the mother gently. Wow. When I was six years old I didn't even know what the word "***" meant. D: I didn't even know there was even such a word as sex. e e; Wow.|`|TiN0pZjOaa	omg, that's not right. i would call the 9 year olds parents asap and the school to tell them about what they're telling the girl. and tell her mom , too.|`|IjkPBYlkaa	wow im so surprised!! i didnt think that was really posibble specially at that age!!:[[ kids minds are not all that developed to understand but i guess soo|`|VP7A10bXaa	Holy crap!!  Can you imagine living the rest of your life knowing that you lost your virginity at 6?!?!<br>  <br>  6!!!!|`|7Oee9Afaaa	holy ****. this is so hard to read. jesus. 6? 6?!?<br>  i am speechless.<br>  i am so sorry.<br>  god. <br>  ....|`|NzezdETKaa	wtf? what are children learning these days? jesus,i'm only fifteen and i barely think of those things.|`|YYV3Azo6aa	i agree with the other people... it will be far more worse when she does find out if you keep it a secret.. you really dont wanna keep something like that from a childs parents...|`|8e62aeae88cc99e4727e560c786fd9b9aa	FIRST OF WOOOOOOOOOOOOOWWWWWWWWWWWW and second it seems to me like the mother of that boy has influenced her child.kids do what they are taught or how they are raised.obviously that 6 year old likes it if shes thinking it was "normal" last how the hell is that mother not ware of the kids having sex??!!!! that little girls parents can sue the boys mother...just thought i should let you know!!! AND YOU HAVE TO TELL HER!!! SHE WILL FIND OUT REGARDLESS|`|MH57e8HJaa	at times older kids for fun sake teach younger kids all kind of stupid stuff and tell them that it is ok to do it cause it is natural, it is the need for the parents to talk to their kids about all this. i do not mean sex education but i mean a briefing about girls not letting boys touch them at there private parts and all that, tell her mother also the same thing that it was not the girls fault but a misguiding by the older kid, hence they need to talk to the school authority to b careful of all these incidents. u have to tell the mother, make her understand, that the time has changed and the kids learn about every thing at a much younger stage, n we need to b careful with our kids.|`|nOeUT67Laa	Well, I think you should take her somewhere where you two could be alone.  Have the little girl far somewhere else, possibly not at the same house (with a relative, maybe).  Then explain to the mother that what you're about to tell her is going to be very difficult to understand.  Explain to her that the child is only six and that it is not her fault and that she should take a few hours before talking with the child (at least a few hours).  Then tell her what happened.<br>  <br>  This is nuts.  I can't believe it.|`|qRElKKjXaa	I really pray you are a troll making this up. If you are being serious, then you need to just tell the mother straight-out what you saw. Six years do not naturally have the inclination to have sex, and so I wonder if the child has been sexually abused. They are not physically ready for sex, and the children should be examined by a doctor and a child psychologist.|`|prqrQcd1aa	You come right out and tell the mother what has been going on. I"m a mother, i'd want to know exactly what was going on. Then you have the mom explain to her 6 year old girl what sex is, and her views on it, and how it's possible to have a baby when you have sex once you have gotten a little older. Then you make shure that you have the mother get the girl into some counseling!|`|SiPGcBnYaa	that's ridiculous. i have no words.|`|HrsPCzaBaa	what the hell? <br>  Theyre not even old enough to procreate!|`|HclKftzAaa	The average age of first sex in Australia is 13- now, think about all the ppl who have sex at 16 etc, now think about how young a bunch of kids must be to bring the average down to 13. Scary huh?<br>  <br>  When the mother comes back tell her 'When i went to collect lilly from 'boy's' house, his mother and I found them having intercourse. Lilly told me that they have done this lots of times.'<br>  <br>  This way she knows it's not just you who saw it, and she knows straight away it was ALSO happening when she was in charge of Lilly's care. It's not your fault.<br>  <br>  Then explain to her what you and Lilly have talked about regarding the incident. And about sex. Tell her what you know about how they know about sex.<br>  <br>  and then just be there for them both and support them.<br>  <br>  Do not let her blame you for this.|`|OI3bf4yjaa	Holy crap, that is crazy!! Goes to show you what kind of world we live in. As for telling her mother, don't hide it (obviously). Straight out tell her that you walked in on them engaging in intercourse, and you talked to her about it. Tell the mother exactly what her daughter said. (How she thought it was normal and how the kids at school taught them). Find out who the kids are who taught them about sex, talk to their parents!!!<br>  <br>  <br>  That is.. wow.. I'm actually lost for words.|`|ey8aWCPUaa	I knew everything by age 9...<br>  <br>  Tell Lilly's mother, and make sure she and the mother of the boy have a talk with both of the children, together and/or separately.|`|g9l8ed4qaa	Kids don't just do this. I don't know where it started. With which kid but there is some abuse involved. It needs to be reported.|`|HJfOVhSsaa	so was i :|<br>  thats reaky weired<br>  just explain to the mother u caught them and u think she should talk to her son about it-no hard feelings|`|5XwY9aP8aa	From now on while shes your responsibility do NOT let her go over there. Then talk to her mother ASAP! She needs to know.|`|alAtUXvyaa	omg....WOW....that is messed up.......omg.....wtf|`|7KhIn4HJaa	I only can say OMG OMG what's really going on in this world damn|`|7UV3OVANaa	lol I found out what it was like when i was in 7th grade! what to do... what to do... well you HAVE to tell the mom, that's a fact. Talk to the other boy who informed them about it's mother. tell her what she doesnt know her son is doing. Shes ur best friends duaghter, so itll be easier to tell ur friend right? tell her slowly, and carefully. it wouldnt be nice to tell ur friend her daughter is having intercourse, a 6 year old too! say it slowly, and carefully. MAKE SURE u mention her duaghter had no clue it was wrong, or u know we dont want it to be nasty. HOPE U GET THROUGH !!!|`|dShnJ20raa	I would tell her exactly what you told us. Also I would suggest she sit down and have a serious discussion with the other mom and both children explaining that it is inappropriate at such a young age. You may want to try to find out the 9 yr olds name and speak to his parents as well as he may have just heard about it from someone older and not fully understand either. Good luck

bAp35x7uaa	It's highly unlikely there would have been any damage unless there were complications with the abortion - and even then, it's not definite.    I had a missed abortion/miscarriage ten years ago which meant I had to have a d&c (the same operation as an abortion).  It didn't work the first time and so they had to repeat the procedure.  I was so worried that having two operations so close to each other would cause me problems but it hasn't and I'm now 4 months pregnant.    Your poor friend has a lot on her mind at this obviously very difficult time.  Try and reassure her as much as you can and I think she should go and speak with her OBGYN to set her mind at rest.    You're a good friend! x|`|ktbRE826aa	yeah, she should get checked by her gynecologist.. thats really the only thing she can do|`|phwivaqNaa	The doctor is going to be the most knowledgeable person to help with this.  Plus, she would want to get checked sooner or later if she wants children in the future.  Just tell her to be careful in the future because the more abortions, the more chances of damage.|`|mxixfE3Raa	If she bled heavily for more than three days then it would be a good idea to see her OBGYN or Doctor or whatever.  It is really rare to have problems after an abortion, so she should only see a specialist if she thinks it's neccessary.  She should watch any of these videos:  http://www.mariestopes.org.uk/Womens_ser...    Although she lives in the USA it will be the same procedure etc.    Good Luck To Your Friend x|`|dSuZ5x1Saa	As long as the abortion was done a certified doctor she should be fine.|`|T6xd0OxWaa	Go to a different OBGYN if her OB was the one that performed the abortion because, that person may try to cover up a mistake.|`|xfZWmPJPaa	teh most you could do is get your friend to ask her doctor, like you stated.  thats all i can think of.|`|AA11284789	I believe there can be a risk of scarring of the uterus....but my friend had one a year ago and now she is pregnant and doing great so i think it differs woman to woman|`|67f0250eadbdb98de695907e5267d964aa	As long as she got it done at a licensed place there should be no damage to her reproductive system. I have a friend who has had 3 abortions I know of and she had a healthy little girl 6 months ago.|`|D35xKICoaa	Only a doc can tell you so speak with your doc.|`|V3UmvkVOaa	Although there are risks associated with abortion, if it was performed by a professional, she should be just fine. I hate to admit it, but I have had 2, and I'm now expecting a son in March. It has been a textbook pregnancy thus far, absolutely perfect. But every woman is different, and I have read about abortions that were performed correctly and still left the women with a weakened cervix (this can cause baby to come prematurely). As everyone else has said on here, the best advice is to talk with her OBGYN, as he/she will certainly give you a sound diagnosis. Good luck!
27jdKozNaa	My 18 month old daughter is the same exact way.     She will drink anything under the sun out of a sippy cup except milk!     It doesnt bother me too much & I dont really care if other people wonder why she still drinks out of her bottle. I guess if i really pushed her to drink milk from her sippy I could by just never offreing her it in a bottle again & basically she'll have no choice but I just figure it's the least of my worries LOL & if she takes it that way then well why not.     But like I said everything esle goes in a sippy =)|`|vue9NOhYaa	The best advice is to just relax.  THere is  nothing wrong with a toddler drinking from a bottle.  Continue to  offer the sippy for other beverages, and try putting milk in it.  But there's no law that says a baby has to off the bottle completely at 12 ... or 13 ... or even 18 months. As long as she isn't walking around with it all day, or sucking on it all night, it won't harm  her teeth.|`|qB4KvbDiaa	you need to wing her slowly from the bottle don"t give it to her at nap time,only at bedtime|`|TOljxMLMaa	My son was about 14 months,  You just have to stop no matter what her actions are.  Stay strong and just do it!!|`|LfGQjuZnaa	When I was young my parents took me to the mountains and told me we were giving my bottles to the baby bears. You could try to do something like that. It worked for me.|`|auUeI2Vnaa	Well, all you can really do is just stop giving it to her and go through a few rough nights.  When I wanted my boys off the bottle at bed time, I started giving them water in their sippy cups.  They weren't happy about it and the first week was hell, but then they realized they weren't getting anywhere by screaming for bottles and finally started just going to sleep.  Same with the milk, just give it to her in her cup.  When she realizes that she isn't going to get it in a bottle, she'll take the cup.  It doesn't happen overnight, but persistence is key.  If you give in at all, it'll just take longer.|`|QzWHMGHJaa	So then stop giving them to her!  She'll eventually drink milk out of her cup, when that's all there is to drink from.  She shouldn't be having a cup in her bed anyway!  Take them away and she'll get used to it, just like all kids do!|`|2rXWZkbnaa	She is only 13 months old. Who cares if she still uses her cuppy. Its normal. She is still a baby. Let her have her fun.|`|M85Dn5Ccaa	Don't rush her she will let you know when she doesn't want it any more.  My daugher is 22 months and I give her a bottle at bed time, and a sippy all day.  She is still happy and healthy.  You have time.  Don't rush it.  You can slowly take them away if you want.  That is what I did for the nap time bottles.  I slowly took them away from 3 a day to 2 and then after a few days of that I went to 1.    Hope it helps!|`|dFOcEmWMaa	i remember the night my dad through out my bottles, he trough them all in the trash and was yelling... i was sitting on the counter with my mom holding me... I never got another bottle, i dint remember how old I was, but it had messed my teeth up so bad from being on the bottle so long that I spent many years in braces|`|J1Gfjcvuaa	this will work dude, im 15 years old and my parents did this to me when i was a kid, atleast they say they did, okay get the tip of the bottle (the part the kid sucks onto) and dip it into some water that you put salt into, and give it to him/her and let them suck onto it and they would not ever want it again, trust me works on all my causins and nephews, if it doesnt, its because your not an armenian|`|3EhoJ42zaa	When my son turned a year old we took the bottle away completely.  He was only using it at night and for a comfort.  He would fall asleep with the bottle in his mouth, but he would never drink it so I figured it was time to get rid of it all the way.  We just tossed it.  He was drinking sippy cups during the day so it wasn't too bad.  The first three nights were the worst.  We would lay him down without a bottle and he would start fussing.  We did the CIO method where you walk in after 15 minutes, rub their back, cover him back up and walk out again.  It took three nights for him to finally sleep through the night without his bottle.  You just need to stay consistent otherwise it wont work.  There were times when I wanted to give him his bottle just so I could get some sleep, but I didn't.  So when you take it away, take it away for good.  Cut off the top of the bottle or throw it away so you dont feel tempted to give in.  As for not drinking milk out of her cup, all you can do is keep offering it to her.  She may push it away or throw it to the ground, but just keep offering it.  Your daughter will not go hungry or thirsty trust me.  She will give in.  Give it a couple of days to a week and she will have it down.  Stay consistent and strong.      EDIT: people you need to learn how to read.  She is not asking how old her daughter should be when she takes the bottle away.  She is specifically asking how she can stop giving it at nap and bedtime, not what age YOU think is acceptable to stop with the bottle. Just answer her actual question or move on.|`|QPPcUyyyaa	Stop giving her the bottle.  The onus is on you.    Problem solved.|`|52U22fiAaa	You shouldn't be putting her to bed with milk whether it's a sippy cup or bottle because it can lead to tooth decay.  The milk sits in their teeth and rots.  You should brush her teeth in the evening and only give her water after that.  Best time is obviously after dinner when she's full.      Anyway, use a soft spout sippy, she'll learn eventually.  Don't give in.  NUK sippy cups worked wonderfully for us.  Also Nuby sippy cups.|`|aJB1OPoFaa	introduce her to cuppy slowly|`|qa20ll5baa	aa|`|hrFGKAeraa	you can do two things here. you can ween her and gradually take the bottle away at nap time and bed time until finally she won't use it anymore. or you could just cut her off cold turkey.|`|NKYy41qAaa	Tough Love Man...  you have to be firm and tell her NO!  I know it's hard but it could really help her understand that she needs to be a big girl now!  Good Luck!|`|o1hvya8zaa	She's still a baby it won't hurt her to use the bottle a few more months.....Mine is 16 months and we're just taking her bottle away from her.....|`|KSpnZ0QHaa	so she is still so young.....|`|bDRDJ8Vtaa	You don't need advise. You need ear-plugs. Throw them out, and then weather the ensuing tantrum. Don't negotiate, pamper nor lose your temper. Just be resolved. If she doesn't want a drink out of the cup that night, she goes to be with no drink. It won't do her any harm, and she'll learn that you won't bend to accommodate her, or reward her for disobeying you.|`|GzNb3Ih8aa	try different types of cups/drinking beakers|`|E5CnUdhsaa	keep offering it in her cup, as soon as she can take a certain amount out of it take the bottles away and offer her the milk she will take along with cheese yoghurt to keep up her daity intake.|`|YPvyvDzQaa	I went through this with my son too. I just had to keep putting milk in his cup and stopped the bottle totally. I hid it so he couldn't even see it and called the cup a baba. He still calls the cup and baba and he's 2 now. He cried the first time but got thirsty enough that he drank it. He was fine the next day. It may take a few days but that's ok, it won't hurt her to cry a bit and as long as she can't see the real bottle she'll know that its all about the sippy cup now. I know it's hard but you can do it! Good luck!!|`|CsLyyRQeaa	Try holding her and giving her milk in the sippy cup.  If it still does not work as hard as it is just take the bottle away.  It sucks and it will be hard but now is the time to do it.  In a couple weeks she will be used to not having the bottle.  Just take one away and then when she is used to not having it, take the last one away.|`|jhFuwR7Jaa	TRY GIVING HER A CUP BUT SOME BABIES GET RID OF A BOTTLE WHEN THEY ARE READY YOU CAN ALSO TRY LETTING HER DRINK OUT A REGULAR CUP|`|sHHskOflaa	throw away all her bottles except one. when giving her milk in her cup give a her little milk at a time or try giving her strawberry or chocolate milk instead|`|AA10572259	I don't have personal experience, my daughter would never take a bottle but did breastfeed until after she was 13 months old.  I just stopped cold turkey because I thought it was the best things for both of us, and it worked.      Anyway I have had lots of friends who had to take their children off the bottle.  You have two options really.  You can go cold turkey.  Offer her milk out of a cup only.  If she is healthy a day or two without milk or much to drink isn't going to harm her.  She will eventually give up and take the milk out of the cup or fall asleep without it.  You will have a few hard days but after that it should be over.      Your other option is to try to wean her off of it more and more.  You could try putting a little chocolate in the milk that is in her cup so she will be interested in it.  Try to give her the bottle just at night time and not at nap time first.  After you are sure she is good without it for nap then take it away at night time too.  This may be easier on both of you but it could be harder too.      Overall she is at the perfect age for this.  As with most things the longer you wait the harder it will get.  Good luck, stay strong!|`|IuOxDlzCaa	this is normal. i know so many children aged 24 months and older who have a bottle when they wake up. maybe at 13 months they arent ready to not have a bottle.|`|B4Cz1vUEaa	When my son was between 15 and 16 months old, I decided he needed to be off the bottle.  So we went cold turkey.  Everyone told me that he would eventually give in and use a sippy cup.  Everyone was wrong. He went from 40 oz of day to less than 5 oz a day.  I gave him two choices: water or milk.  We went on for weeks and he didn't take more than a sip or two of milk.  So finally I added juice back, I was afraid he would be dehydrated.  Anyway, he is now 26 months old and will drink milk out of a regular cup but has never accepted a sippy cup.  He will also drink from a straw but we totally skipped the sippy cups.  I don't know that I would do what I did again.(I am referring to going cold turkey on the bottles)  He now drinks about 8 oz of milk a day and he eats a lot of yogurt and I buy applesauce with calcium added. He also gets about 2/3 cup milk each morning in his hot cereal which he loves.  My doctor says he is doing just fine and that I shouldn't worry too much about the milk thing.  Some kids drink a lot of milk and some kids don't.|`|v3J7LbfEaa	the sippy cup stage is totally normal.  i dont think i stopped using mine till i was 3 years old.|`|dc54d4959bea67dd90fb7a1de82f0aa3aa	Well she doesn't need a bottle at nap time or bed time. There's only one way to do that and it may seem cruel, but you just gotta take it away and let them cry. They will get over it. Good Luck.|`|DdKsz5A8aa	my daughter is almost 2 she still uses her bottle she refuses to use her sippy cup occasionaly for juice but never milk    spoke to my doctor & mom about it and they said when she is ready to she will do it -- not to be concerned  so wait it out and if u are still worried call your doctor's office speak with the nurse to get some reassurance.    good luck!|`|46otjIowaa	I might use something sweet like apple juice or white grape juice.  Let her know this is a special treat that only goes in the sippy cup.  Once she is using it and has something positive to associate with it, the transition might be easier. Also explain the treat is for big girls only and big girls drink out of sippy cups.  Make it fun.  Find a sippy cup that has a design on it that she really likes.  Like Dora the Explorer.  Maybe have her help you pick it out.  Have it be a "big" outing for the two of you.    Once that has started, take all the bottles out of the cupboard and pack them away.  You could have her help you and explain you are giving the bottles to babies that need it.      If you don't want to her to drink out of the sippy cup at bedtime either, take it away at naptime and tell her no.  Taking it away in stages might be less traumatic to you both.    If you can't do this, you can put in on the babysitter to get you started. They will be mad and cry, but once they realize fighting doesn't work, they will stop.  But that means you have to stick to it. If you say no, DO NOT give in.  You can give it to them at special times.  But don't give in.  That is giving confusing signals.

c09e1f232acd578a9f591c5b83a68f43aa	You have to wonder how competent she is, don't you? Both my children were an absolute pain at 4-8 months old, but you have to put up with it.|`|44OH7Si6aa	You need to find another car provider. Obviously this woman isn't as qualified as she thought she was if she actually called you to come get him because he cries too much. The only times you should need to go get him is when he is sick or injured. Ask her what her policy on sending children home is. If she responds with, I'm sorry I just couldn't handle him you need to go look at other day cares immediately.  As far as her calling because it may be a sign he is getting sick, that's bull. A professional would call you and say they are having some trouble with him, he seems to be crying a lot today and we were wondering if he was showing any signs of teething or fussiness at home. Asking you to pick the child up and giving only the reason that he is crying too much is a red flag that the person doesn't know what they are doing.|`|pXSKSS3daa	I don't know about her being "used" to crying babies but I'd be concerned if she cannot cope with it. How many other babies are in her care? Is she the only one doing the care? And was your son only sent home due to crying? I mean, was he showing any signs of illness too?    If he was just a bit fussier than usual she should be able to handle that, being a child care provider and all. If your son has only been going there a month he's probably still in that adjusting phase. Sending him home every time he cries isn't going to help him transition. She'll just have to buck up and try to show him a bit more attention and love while he's there. If she cannot do that then you may want to look into finding another place of care for your son.|`|vue9NOhYaa	I'd guess that they called because the baby is inconsolable, which might suggest that he's sick.|`|F6lZHRkVaa	A daycare worker should be know how to soothe a crying baby and barring that, they should know not to get frustrated by it. Pull your kid out and take him elsewhere.|`|b978f631fc787a963337206aa3833370aa	Uhh....did you tell her, "That's why we're paying you"? Unless she thinks the baby is sick, I'd maybe either tell her sorry - I can't do that! or find another daycare. How awful.     I know someone whose wife runs an in home daycare with like a ton of kids. he said he'd call her sometimes during the day and so and so would be screaming, and she was totally used to it. LOL I'd say your daycare provider needs to find a new line of work!|`|fe6fcbf713d0ed0538de9c9304001a52aa	Babies shouldn't cry, crying is a sign that something is WRONG.    Obviously she can't fix what is wrong with the baby for whatever reason so the baby's parents need to go and get the baby and make sure the baby is OK.    I would fire a babysitter that didn't call if my baby was crying and she couldn't calm them|`|7SKVCPcSaa	she needs to get over it! babies cry. if she can't 'take it' then she doesn't need to be in day care. i would refuse to pay for that day since it was HER fault your child wasn't there.|`|4DoXomHZaa	She is not fit to be a daycare worker. Unfortunately this is what happens so often when we pay others to watch our children. They don't love them like we do, they just want a check.|`|dPmK83UYaa	The child is probably suffering from seperation anxiety. it is very difficult for him. If the daycare provider is caring for many children this may be affecting the other kids as well. It can be stressful and difficult when your attention has to be on the kid ALL the time to keep him happy. Unless the babysitter is just watching one child.       Help your daycare provider by giving her a list of all the things you know seem to make your child happy when they are not in a good mood. Sometimes children have something that makes them feel a little more secure. A certain song, a way of playing, a certain way to be held or comforted, a blankie? whatever helps.|`|90fomWglaa	Normally after a week or so the baby should be used to it. If you have to go pick up your child it isn't the babys fault and it deff isnt the daycares fault. And it's not fair to your son or the provider to have the baby crying all day. Maybe your son needs a different kind of care. Have you consitered a nanny? There are websites to help connect you with nannys and babysitters in your area. A couple I know of are  care.com and sittercity.com.  Hope that is helpful.|`|dt2Vl76Gaa	I wouldn't take your child to that daycare. Whether or not the daycare worker can handle it personally, it's their job to be able to deal with a crying child. That or the worker may not be doing their job right and could have been hurting the child, so I would find a better day care.|`|nKXTjqQWaa	I would find a new daycare provider immediately, do not pay her for any time that your child wasn't there. Do not send your child back to this provider.|`|mc6YtaRbaa	Unless your child ends up sick tonight, I would say she needs to learn how to be a real provider and you need to find a new day care place!|`|uGFzzLYWaa	Is this the first time she's called to have you pick up your child?    If so, she may feel your child is ill. She is not under any obligation to watch a sick child, and she has every right to call you if she suspects illness.    It is unusual if your child is requiring all the attention and the daycare provider cannot pay attention to the others in her care.     I'm not defending the daycare provider, but every situation is different, and perhaps you should be discussing this situation with the daycare provider.|`|E5CnUdhsaa	i would change my day care provider immediately...she cant cope with  her job as a day care provider because a baby is crying? that concerns me|`|AA11099963	I really question this persons professionalism.  If she cant handle crying she shouldnt be in the business.  Its good for babys to cry doesnt always mean they are in pain or sickly.  Take the child to another day care.|`|yUyx2nhmaa	omg take him out of there! i personally would prefer my child in a nursery/crche where there are more people around. maybe he's starting teething, poor thing. they only cry for a reason at that age. presume he hasn't been crying for the whole month?|`|2274dcf5eba0ee2ef3aabbe2c8b0a89daa	yea thats rediculouse. maybe she should see whats wrong with him. and if she cant handel it then find another sitter. cause when they start teething it may get worst|`|6ZKdO0Iqaa	I dunno, there's two sides to every story... as someone else mentioned, the baby might have been inconsolable or crying in a certain way that made her concerned for the baby and for her liability. I'm sure you chose a provider based on references, and she seemed like a competent provider so you should talk to her about it before you give up on her, especially if you have a contract. I fyou're still not comfortable, you have every right to tak your child elsewhere, but that doesn't necessarily mean she was wrong for doing what she did.|`|436f65cdc88ba6b0bf9a6e1b9239b42daa	Yes, and no.  I work at a daycare, granted I work with 1-2 year olds but it's still the same.  Children definatley cry.  The only time a caregiver would decide to send a child home from crying would be if it is out of the norm and can not be controlled.  Most time's infants will cry because they are in pain.  In my class we have only once sent a child home, jsut turned 1, because she had been crying non-stop for 2 hours straight and a pacifier, food, comfort, TLC and anything else would not work.  It turened out she had an ear ache which was causing her to cry.  Babies also have a different cry for different things and maybe the caregiver does not recoginze this cry.  With the 1 year old, it was a cry never heard before and anytime she is sick, you can tell because she gets the exact same cry.    If you are worried ask the caregiver about it.  Or even ask for refrences.|`|AA11626328	You need new child care because   babies do cry, and yes they need some attention.|`|Irdj2KAFaa	I agree 100% with emmas*mo.    In fact, as a concerned father, I might even do a little 'sublte' investigation and begin asking other parents at your daycare for their opinions.... you never know if there's a 'history' there.    I think I watch Dateline NBC too much. :)
qhqLjRlQaa	No baby is born at EXACTLY 9 months. ACTUALLY, since your scheduled due date is 40 weeks, most people consider that 10months.     Twins do not "share" weeks, however for the most part multiple births are born slightly earlier than singles.|`|pXSKSS3daa	They don't share weeks but are typically born earlier than just ONE baby.    "A twin, or any other higher order multifetal gestation, is by its nature a higher risk pregnancy. The most frequently encountered problem with a twin gestation is prematurity. Growth restriction is another difficulty that may be experienced by one or both of the fetuses. Some labors need to be induced before term if one or both of the babies is in jeopardy."|`|XOtHsTo0aa	Usually they come a little bit early....I had mine at 36 weeks.|`|5tvM9T7vaa	They do not share weeks, but every pregnancy is different, and most are not EXACTLY 9 months.|`|AA11296044	Multiple pregnancies can end early for a host of reasons, and in general twins tend to be born slighly earlier than a single birth.  This is not because they share the weeks, rather the babies are sharing a very small space.    For twins and singles term is still 37-42 weeks.|`|r52rfBkeaa	Actually, the 9 month idea is misleading.  Pregnancy is 40 calendar weeks, which equals 9 calendar months, or 10 months if you allow 4 weeks per month.    Twins usually don't go full term (the full 40 weeks) because there's just not enough room for them all to grow to 6-7 lbs.  They're usually born early and weigh less than a baby who was a single and went to full term.    They don't share weeks, they share the womb and there's only so much space to go around.|`|4YIUxSlYaa	The average pregnancy is 40 weeks.  Twins tend to come earlier, but not always.    My mum went 5 days late with twins.|`|3lwJ5zFlaa	yes they arrive early within a month of meeting my wife my twins were born. i would of never of guessed a twin pregancy would  only of lasted 4 weeks.what i cannot understand is why they are both chinese as neither my wife or i are. oh well......|`|pRaPxsLzaa	haha i like your thinking but no 9 months in total unless you go into labour early for natural reasons not for shared weeks!!    good luck
zIAeznSEaa	Wow, I love the girls name, so much!  I think the first name for the boy is good as it is unusual, but easy to pronounce - you can see how it's pronounced just by reading it.

Lovely names, good luck with the baby :)|`|Elxuvon8aa	sorry I have come to hate|`|GFzDwIk6aa	Not too fond of either tbh|`|99Dvcw29aa	i dont like them either but name your future kids whatever you want|`|TffCSzHxaa	How about switching them around?

And for a boy David Keoki.    You can still call them by their middle names but I cannot imagine a high flyer being called Keoki.|`|32K93DP4aa	dont like them but that is just my opinion|`|IEQqdYO2aa	i like the girls not so much the guys first name|`|IvkNTqDMaa	Awful...sorry...my opinion...you asked.|`|UYAhesuvaa	I've never heard of Andie as a girl's name (just as like a nickname for Andrea), it's cute :)  Keoki is a little too out there for my preference but I still think it's cute and if you like it then totally go for it :P
gdnL63ngaa	Nope, I really had a feeling I was having a girl (which was strange becuase i wanted a boy) and its a boy!    Even a friend of mine thought it was a girl but a boy. I still have dreams about her and that she's having a girl, but still a boy hahaha    Maybe this means its a BOY!!!|`|Qfq4lpe7aa	no you already have a girl so it is natural to use the feminine tense! :)  But good luck hope you get what you want I said he all the time and I am having another boy but I think I said he just because I already had a boy! :)|`|fMnzjULCaa	Maybe, but my baby is a boy & the other day I said to my Mom "I can take HER to the gym w/ me when I'm on maternity leave." So I called my baby, who I know is a boy, a girl. Weird!! The day I found out what he was I picked out blue tissues. That was my sign lol. Also a lot of other people called him a boy before I found out what he was.|`|8cLLhDrfaa	maybe. but your probably just so use to saying "her" cause of your other babygirl.|`|QYYWBrG7aa	Nope u calling ur baby a girl means nothing.my cousin has 3 boys and finally expecting a baby girl in June.and sometimes she still mistakens and calls her lil girl a boy.|`|eS4CSdQ5aa	maybe    i was right about my little boy  i always said "he" or "him"|`|d6df9c3bab13d4a609d4641b785de6b0aa	You are probably just saying that bc you already have a girl. And that is what you are used to saying. I have 3 boys and I call this baby I am carrying a boy all the time. And we have no idea what the sex is. My sister and I are very close and she spends alot of time with my boys and all during her pregnancy and even after her daughter was born she called her a him..lol.|`|pRTFjaK4aa	girl maybe.|`|ffAmoqFTaa	I called my baby him everytime I talked about being pregnant up until I found out I'm having a girl - but you never know!|`|WPI0Z47saa	No it doesn't mean anything. Everyone kept calling mine a girl and I even had a dream it was a girl and I just found it out to be a boy. My first pregnancy I did the same and it was right but it doesn't mean anything.|`|5X3Wsxfwaa	When I was pregnant with my 2nd child I just knew I would have a girl because I already had a son.  Nope, I had another son.  Saying "her" was just a subconscious thing.  I am so glad you didn't say "it". I hate it when people call an unborn child "it".  From conception, that baby is human!  Best of luck to you.
SJ9lOnCOaa	I get that too! but mine starts at the top and then my whole belly gets sharp pains. there is no more room in your belly so im guessing its just limited space thats causing the pain. try eating smaller portions, and see if that helps.|`|35kVNi5oaa	i get that too. i think its because all of your organs are already smooshed and the food fills it up even more..

E2UXN7J1aa	In a situation where all other forms of punishment have failed and the child did something very bad that could possibly be endangering them I think spanking is an ok option. They should be fully clothed though and swatted on the bottom only once and not in front of others. Spanking shouldn't become routine though so if the parents is the kind of person who is going to become dependent on hitting their child then it shouldn't be done at all.|`|0e0a0f1828f99f87ea3d5e5bc8cbd46daa	NO it is NOT necessary. NO to everything you asked.|`|qTVkydt1aa	What is the matter with you?<br>  <br>  Spanking used as punishment is acceptable as long as it doesn't turn to borderline abuse, but what you're talking about is sexual satisfaction.|`|JivuAmfiaa	NO! It teaches children the wrong message of they can hit someone because their parents hit them.|`|kCiizn5oaa	No, No, No, No, No<br>  <br>  I cba to go into all the in's and out's of why hitting children is wrong.|`|eya1WDS4aa	Your view on spanking of the children: YES <br>  <br>  what is your view on the spanking of the children? as long as your not doing it out of anger or taking it to far i think its okay.<br>  <br>  do you do it to their bare bottoms or make them put on diapers first? my son is always in a diaper and i never do it bare but.<br>  do you spank em with pants or take of their pants first?  i would only spank with clothes on.<br>  do you puthem over your knee or no? nope i just do it when he is standing<br>   do you let them watch you in the mirror? no<br>   do you film? your sick.<br>   is spanking necessary? in some cases yes. <br>  is it abuse? not if done in the right way<br>  it is illegal? no not if its done in the right way<br>   how hard do you hit your children on their tender bottoms? not hard at all i have never left a red mark or any kind of mark period.<br>   how hard are you supposed to spank your child? not hard enough to leave a mark<br>  do you spank them on front?  wtf is on front?<br>  spank them in front of their children friends" my kid doesnt have friends yet but i would say no i would take him to a different room<br>  <br>   spank your friend chils? nope i would never disiplin a child that wasnt mine.<br>   while watch?   ....what?|`|sp1x3ZUAaa	I'm not a parent, but I think it is wrong.<br>  I mean, children have feelings, and thoughts, and memories - do you want them to remember you in a bad way? do you want to scare them? they might end up hating or resenting you, or having serious problems.<br>  It is only legally abuse if you hit them above the neck or do it simply to hurt them (and/or give them visible BEATINGS).<br>  And, in my opinion, spanking them infront of their friends is rude and embarrassing, maybe a bit over the top.<br>  And if you spank someone elses child, that is child abuse, and very wrong...<br>  Spanking has also been connected to child molesting and paedophilia.|`|idgJndmBaa	You've asked this before! <br>  <br>  Jeepers Creepers, fetish much?????

gHR4vlcDaa	NOTHING to do with body being used to it! Get her to the doc talk to him he will explain it all, can cause severe problems for the baby even women and child of child bearing ages should not eat alot of certain kinds of fish, it does depend on the type of fish and where it comes from BUT you need to check it out I just kept it to 2x a month thing to be safe<br>  <br>  What are the foods I should avoid during pregnancy?<br>  <br>  Fish with Mercury: Fish that contain high levels of mercury should be avoided. Mercury consumed during pregnancy has been linked to developmental delays and brain damage. A sample of these types of fish include: shark, swordfish, king mackerel, and tilefish. Canned, chunk light tuna generally has a lower amount of mercury than other tuna, but still should only be eaten in moderation. Certain types of fish used in sushi should also be avoided due to high levels of mercury. Please see Mercury in Fish for specific types of fish and further information on how to calculate mercury levels. <br>  <br>  Smoked Seafood -Refrigerated, smoked seafood often labeled as lox, nova style, kippered, or jerky should be avoided because it could be contaminated with Listeria. (These are safe to eat when they are in an ingredient in a meal that has been cooked, like a casserole.) This type of fish is often found in the deli section of your grocery store. Canned or shelf-safe smoked seafood is usually OK to eat. <br>  <br>  Fish Exposed to Industrial Pollutants: Avoid fish from contaminated lakes and rivers that may be exposed to high levels of polychlorinated biphenyls. This is primarily for those who fish in local lakes and streams. These fish include: bluefish, striped bass, salmon, pike, trout, and walleye. Contact the local health department or Environmental Protection Agency to determine which fish are safe to eat in your area. Remember, this is regarding fish caught in local waters and not fish from your local grocery store.<br>  <br>  Raw Meat: Uncooked seafood and rare or undercooked beef or poultry should be avoided because of the risk of contamination with coliform bacteria, toxoplasmosis, and salmonella.<br>  <br>  Deli Meat: Deli meats have been known to be contaminated with listeria, which can cause miscarriage. Listeria has the ability to cross the placenta and may infect the baby leading to infection or blood poisoning, which may be life-threatening. If you are pregnant and you are considering eating deli meats, make certain that you reheat the meat until it is steaming.|`|JP2h62qiaa	There is only a few fish that you can't eat while pregnant. A lot of fish out there is really good for you, only some of it has high mercury content. Her dr will know exactly the few fishes that she can't eat. MAke sure to ask about it when you go next time. Good luck.<br>  <br>  Fish has good omega fatty acids. Great for the baby's developing brain. I will try to find a link for you.<br>  <br>  **<a href="http://www.parents.com/pregnancy/my-body/nutrition/safe-pregnancy-eating/?page=3" rel="nofollow">http://www.parents.com/pregnancy/my-body...</a>|`|PN7ELn3aaa	Some fish are completely fine in pregnancy! High in protein, omega 3s, low in fat...fish are a great choice! <br>  <br>  Certain fish to avoid are fish that grow too large. Tuna/Swordfish/Shark/King Mackeral are a few that contain high levels of mercury.<br>  <br>  Salmon, Tilapia and Trout though are good for pregnant women. <br>  <br>  Don't worry, women in her culture have been having babies for a long time and they are doing fine. :) Maybe have her bring a list of fish to her Dr. to get his or her approval for the certain species and you two can compromise. <br>  <br>  GL and congrats!|`|mgiJVjaKaa	Have her talk to her doctor about it. She needs to ask her doctor and hopefully listen to whatever he/she says, get a list of fish that are okay and not okay. <br>  <br>  Also, you can give her links to resources about it so she's more informed, but you guys can look up what fish are ok and not ok together. She may think you're telling her an old wive's tale or something|`|7zMtmKJaaa	i think she should eat less fish, beause of the mercury it contains.<br>  it's best not to take risks on eating to much fish.<br>  <br>  Hope all goes welll <3|`|4rV15ZYuaa	She's fine :-) First of all her body is used to anything that might be irregular to others who do not consume as much seafood. She does need to stay away from certain fish that are very high in mercury such as swordfish, even though they are so yummy! <br>  <br>  In my first trimester the only protein besides peanut butter and beans that I could keep down was shrimp, crab and catfish. I consulted my midwife and nutritionist and both of them told me the same - concerning the "warning" it is about high levels of mercury in fish. You will inject your child with hundreds times that amount when you administer the shots in the first year. <br>  <br>  So really - let the woman eat! It's cooked and it has soooo many beneficials for her and the baby! If we all ate more fish we would probably be a lot more healthy society overall :-)
H3Va1OKqaa	Birth control sometimes can make your periods painful/irregular, esp for the first few months. It's unlikely that you are preggers, but while the patch will make it difficult for sperm to get to you, having sex so soon to starting could mean that you had already ovulated.|`|X4gsnyOaaa	you can certainly get pregnant but to make sure you should really go to the Doctor! and about the boyfriend thing don't worry about that you will see him soon and you should not worry especially if you are pregnant ! i hope you aren't but in case!|`|vygYFdsSaa	It depends on how quickly the patch becomes effective, I'm not familiar with it myself. You should take a test and/or go and see your doctor if you are worried.|`|iU4Q2GOdaa	youre fine, im pretty sure of it, but take a home preg test just to make sure.|`|AA10670300	yes go see your doctor!|`|77NzfiVkaa	If it was a normal period (not extremely light) then you aren't pregnant. If you were your period would have been very light.|`|QAGhFzFsaa	Sounds like you're ok ... take a test if you're really nervous... but yes stress sure does screw with your period. hope all turns out well (I'm sure it will!)
DTGO1pgyaa	generally that is true. although some girls can mistake implantation bleeding with a light period but otherwise if it is a normal one then you should be fine.|`|ev8ZZYx2aa	usually that is correct. Although sex relations should not happen unless you are ready for the consequences.|`|hbxQvQboaa	Usually if a girl is getting her regular normal periods it means no pregnancy but if relation is made just 3-4 days  or later before the starting of period then the next normal period is only a confirmation for no pregnancy. If more than a weeks gap is there in between the relation and the period then only can you be sure of nil chance pregnancy.|`|1U7yLEf9aa	1st.... She wouldn't have a regular period if she was pregnant. 2nd Ovulation is 14days before the period. If she started a few days later than she wasn't ovulating at the time anyways... The chances of her being pregnant I would say are... none...|`|d4DYyAd6aa	periods!! then no chance of pregnancy|`|TELl62yKaa	no there is no chance until next time u don't go for unprotected.|`|K99BbZHbaa	as long as its a normale peroid then no but if its light then yes
2Pp2cDbJaa	do we look like your doctor? Piss on a damn stick if you think your knoked up<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  birth control, you can still get pregnant<br>  Condoms, you can still get pregnant<br>  Plan B, you can still get pregnant<br>  Pull out, lmao thats not a method and that will definitly get you pregnant<br>  <br>  all of the above together= you can still get pregnant|`|IGcS9K62aa	Well.... you're on the pills on which your period arrives (usually at the end). So you period is probably arriving. Also... if you took the pill the next day and that was the only one you missed you'll be fine. Especially if you've been on them for any length of time. You're probably not pregnant!!!|`|aEZcc9LBaa	WOW all these people are assholes yes u can get pregnant on birthcontrol its accually very common. if you feel pregnant chances are u might be. you know you body better than anyone eles. get a blood test done than take it from there. good luck.|`|fqhtSiyxaa	id bet money that your not pregnant but you should take a couple tests. a couple because sometimes the tests fail so take a couple. if the problems don't go away go to your doc and talk to him/her about it.|`|aca803aafd407291581b58b9be71df4daa	doubtful.|`|gYkQc8Lraa	no, you idiot|`|AA10916164	Take a test.. we cannot tell over the internet if you are pregnant. Go to the dollar store and buy some tests.  Do you normally spot each month ? Don't think about it too much, you can actually psych yourself up into thinking you are pregnant.  <br>  <br>  Take a test... then see.|`|kBqxRuPLaa	Yeah, i agree with everyone else. You're probably not pregnant, but if your period hasn't come on in a week or so, i'd test just to be safe. Good luck!
949517353a847c7e512b934758a0b451aa	it will probable take some time but if it doesnt go down u need to take her bac to the er|`|2Pp2cDbJaa	HOPSPITAL NOW!|`|Fy9S6hjIaa	Awww... I hate it when babies are sick.  I'm sorry your little girl isn't feeling so terrible.  Ear infections are the worst :(<br>  <br>  I would try giving her a warm bath (my doc said cool or cold is not a good idea).  It will help soothe her and get her sleepy, plus it could help bring down her temperature.  Just be careful not to get water in her ears.  Try lightly putting some cotton in each ear before the bath just to keep out splashes.  You can also rotate Tylenol and motrin every 4 hours to help keep the fever down even better.|`|vUoEgKxpaa	put a cold wash cloth on her head, but dont let her get chilled. or give her a luke warm bath, when my nephew had a temp of 102 i put a cold wash cloth on his entire head( obviously not over his mouth or nose) and it dropped his temp pretty quickly. but if it doesnt go away with in an hour or two call the er and ask what you should do.|`|PymLdXM8aa	i guess someone missed that because she already took her to the ER but anyways...lol<br>  <br>  I agree with the first person... try a cool bath or a cool washcloth on her head and see if that helps. Otherwise I would call the doctor if it  lasts for longer then 24 hours.  I hope this helps and she feels better :)|`|pJ7icz0taa	Temps are always higher at night. As long as she has all her medications she will be Ok.. It takes 24 hours to take effect. Try rocking her  ..keep her warm... rub her tummy..lay her in your bed for tonight..that might help.<br>  I know this is hard, but give it time  she is in pain.<br>  She has ear aches  No bath or water in her ears.....Just do what the Dr. told you and make sure she gets her meds. Give it 24 hours and if she is still in pain and crying call your Dr.|`|gFiRi5xnaa	Give her a cool bath or at least rub a cool wash cloth on her head to try and cool her down a bit.|`|V7sfV5odaa	Since fever is part of the body's defense against bacteria and viruses, some researchers suggest that the body may fight infections more effectively when its temperature is elevated. (Bacteria and viruses prefer an environment that's around 98.6 degrees F, or 37 degrees C.) A fever also tells the body to make more white blood cells and antibodies to fight the infection.<br>  <br>  On the other hand, if your baby's temperature is too high, he'll be too uncomfortable to eat, drink, or sleep, and that will make it harder for him to get better.<br>  <br>  You can try to lower your baby's fever by sponging him down with lukewarm (not cold) water or giving him a lukewarm bath.<br>  <br>  Never try to reduce a fever by sponging down your baby with rubbing alcohol. Rubbing alcohol can be absorbed into your baby's bloodstream through the skin. It can also cool him too quickly, which can actually raise his temperature<br>  <br>  Fever-reducing medicines bring down body temperature temporarily. They don't affect the bug that's producing the infection, so your baby may run a fever until his body is clear of the infection. This can take at least two or three days.<br>  <br>  Some infections, such as influenza (the flu), can last five to seven days. If your baby has been treated with antibiotics to fight a bacterial infection, it may take 48 hours for his temperature to fall.|`|UVwRSpDjaa	Cool wash cloth on her head. Keep giving the medicine when it's due. Monitor her often and keep calling the advice line at the hospital. If it starts to creep back up then cold shower. Maybe popsicles.|`|Fe56VaX4aa	try a luke warm bath. Not a cold bath because might make situation worse but just warm. Give her a lot of fluids. Hope she gets better!!|`|ZnLBBOQeaa	If her temp doesnt go down with in the next hour and try giving her  a luke warm bath. If it don't work take her back in the e.r room right away.|`|a03b0b5014fce6dc67440fe39f59a44aaa	you should crunch up an ice cube and give her little pieces of it to suck on it will cool her body temp down.|`|i6mydMOyaa	Cool liquids, cool baths or wipe downs and maybe some baby Tylenol, but check with a doctor first.|`|MMj7YcXkaa	go to er and tell them exactly what you told us
8kwiMnVQaa	The 99% accuracy that they tell you about is true for a positive result. It is extremely unlikely for it to detect the pregnancy hormone by mistake.  <br>  The false negative is more common.  It is more likely that the test does not detect the pregnancy hormone because there was not a lot present.  If it read negative before and it reads positive now, there is a 99% chance that you're pregnant.|`|CYcqQb6Caa	i agree with judy when a test says positive then your pregnant its when it says negative that you have to worry.|`|aqto0hJTaa	A positive EPT means pregnant.<br>  <br>  False positives are extremely rare.|`|QwHHmJohaa	Two April Fools ago (I was 6 months pregnant), and my friend wanted to play a joke on her mom.  She told her she was prego and had me do my thing on a EPT test so it would show positive... It didn't, but I DEFINITLY was!!
2ed5c5743ec637190dff1ac2f92e4f0aaa	Actually, yes, and you'll want to go see an OB-GYN about it.  <br>  <br>  What the pregnancy test detects (most of them) is human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) which is a hormone that the zygote/embryo develops soon after conception.  The purpose of hCG is to maintain a lining that is involved in making progestogon, which is needed to actually maintain the pregnancy.<br>  <br>  For some reason, my friend had a problem with a few of her pregnancies.  I'm not a doctor or anything, and just going on her personal history so I'm not sure if it was a problem with her or the embryo but she had several miscarriages due to low hCG levels.  Her first pregnancy that took, she had low levels early on before they caught it in time and it was ectopic thanks to low the levels during early stages.<br>  <br>  Since she was trying for a baby, she went and got a blood test as soon as she had the suspicion that she might be.  It came back positive and she went to a doctor that day and he referred her to a specialist who started giving her injections of the hormone and her second pregnancy was without problems.<br>  <br>  My advice is, go with your gut instinct.  If you're periods aren't normally late, and it resulted in a miscarriage before, you should go take a blood test as soon as you can.  If you are pregnant, the longer the insufficient levels can increase problems. Just to be safe.<br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|mGCYkqXNaa	Yep. Twice. <br>  <br>  I found out the second time that, due to a kidney condition I have, hCG won't filter out into my urine. Therefore, negative tests.|`|IjkPBYlkaa	yup i my hormones levels werent up intil i was four months thats wen i found out it was finally positive|`|IDmaxViIaa	well yes i have 5 girls and the 5th Alisha came out negative but in my heart i felt like i was pregnant so i went to the doctor and he said i was pregnant.|`|nyuB4POqaa	Yes, I didn't test positive until I was 8 weeks pregnant.

Although the chances are about 1 in a million.<br>  <br>  Really, they only live for a few hours outside of the body until they dry up.<br>  <br>  THEY DO NOT DIE AS SOON AS THEY HIT THE AIR. This is a huge myth and the reason many girls are teen moms!<br>  <br>  Educate yourselves, guys.|`|alAtUXvyaa	in open air, it dies after about 5 - 30 minutes.<br>  in you, it dies after about 1 - 3 days.|`|4268d61bf5ff452e0f18883391534252aa	what i heard from my bio teacher is , sperm will die as soon as it is expose to a temperature which is higher than 37 degree.|`|rkSBHqtQaa	Not really. Sperm pretty much die once air hits it since there's no where to travel to. Inside you I've read they can live anywhere from 3 to 5 days.|`|nJaZOi7caa	There is a very slim chance, but sperm can live for for a few days in the vagina and a few hours outside in the open air, but that also depends on the conditions. I would truthfully not be too worried there would be a very small chance that you would get pregnant. Try a condom or birthcontrol so u dont have to worry about this happening again......|`|gWiZAsfBaa	They don't die fast enough.|`|ce3t8tWiaa	sperm can live for up to 9days, if that helps|`|9cu82009aa	In open air it can live up to anywhere between 30mins-4hrs.<br>  Inside a woman anywhere up to 7 days.<br>  <br>  I can't find the other website I have referred to in the past as I had to reformat and the cookies are obviously gone, but here's another one.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.teengrowth.com/index.cfm?action=info_advice&ID_Advice=2484&category=sex&catdesc=Sex&subdesc=Pregnancy" rel="nofollow">http://www.teengrowth.com/index.cfm?acti...</a>|`|EGEOOZLXaa	They swim.

4d448b682afb9904eff9c42d4e74d02baa	It does not look infected.  Also being that you are 4 months post partum your chance of infection has gone done significantly.  It will take some time to heal and will feel funny (numb) for a while.  <br>  <br>  A rule of thumb for infection would be redness, pus (and yes it's spelled correctly) oozing from the wound site, very hot to the touch and the infection would spread more out as time goes by.  <br>  <br>  Congratulations on your little one!|`|1ezYfkX7aa	It doesnt look infected to me but if your feeling pain i would deff talk to your doctor right away. The numbness is normal, its been 3 1/2years sinse my last baby and i still have no feeling around the incision area. Its probably just the the nerves they cut through. Goodluck =)|`|WXCa8zQoaa	well my mom had me and my Sib's all c- section and she says she always wished she wore a stomach girdle to keep the muscles in shape and every thing so just a tip lol it probably is still healing Personally you should ask for the doctors opinion if you think it is infected just to be safe the burning feeling sounds like soming sketchy|`|2HETgiwgaa	I had a c-section 5 1/2 years ago - part of my tummy is still numb - so, that part is normal.  I don't remember exactly what it felt like at 4 mths - but I think your guess re the burning feeling is probably right.  Maybe mention it next time you see the doctor - unless the pain is bad, in which case see your doctor sooner.|`|ntdGOZqGaa	It still being numb that will be like that for a while, mine kinda hurt for a while too I remember my son was like 6 months and he would press right there and it was like ouch. More then likely it is from it healing, you have to think they cut you from hip to hip and its pretty deep down in there and it will take it a long time to fully heal. It doesnt look infected or anything. Good luck|`|Coc593Ikaa	It doesn't look infected. However, it looks a bit fresher than 4 months to me, so maybe it is not healing as well as it could. It can't hurt to make an appointment with your doctor to go over your concerns about this.|`|bwKZ8MWWaa	I'm a guy but it sounds like your skin is still streching there|`|IjOEpqgOaa	My best friend had a C-section about a year ago still to this day she can't even touch her scar!

The doc spread your muscles and cut your uterus so, its gonna be some time to fully heal! & your body getting back use too.<br>  & i heard it's always gonna feel a little funny when you touch the scar! <br>  <br>  Congrats on your baby!|`|G9UNW0NYaa	That looks really good, actually!  We all scar different colors.  Mine is more red than yours.  Btw, mine is still numb almost a year later!.  I remember feeling some pulling and stretching for at least the first 6 months.  I still feel that way sometimes.  My dr said some women will never have feeling back at the site.  I'm having a c-section in June, so I'm going to start the healing process all over again.  Oh well.
xEXb96UKaa	i'm surprised the dentist left the tooth in place if it is fractured beyond repair. did you try letting him drink through a straw. you can place the straw in such a way that it wont touch his broken tooth but can have a good drink.<br>  i think you should also go to another dentist to get a second opinion, usually if a baby tooth is fractured and causes pain the dentist will extract it if it cannot be repaired.|`|492681182d7c9b1f14276670369e851baa	Marleen M has a good suggestion - straw.|`|VhE4KWhOaa	i don't know if this will work but hopefully it will do something!

2ed5c5743ec637190dff1ac2f92e4f0aaa	Don't worry.  It's normal.<br>  <br>  Right now, your body is gearing up for the delivery.  You're little parasite (and I say that as an endearing term) is trying to take all it can before it comes in to the world.  It is actually a good sign to lose a little weight in the third trimester if you're dieting as the doctor told you.  It is also a sign that your little one is probably coming soon.<br>  <br>  You'll probably want to bump up on what you're food intake a little bit.  Not all that much though.  Talk to your OB first.  Mine did a blood test to check my different nutrient levels and found out I was getting low in iron so he wanted me to start eating more red meat and green veggies.<br>  <br>  As long as the drop is pretty minor and nothing drastic, you're fine. <3|`|MqFeJiukaa	Yes its normal.  I lost 4 lbs in week 37.  I am now first day of week 39 and at the hospital with broken water and waiting for pitocin to start contractions.

LOL<br>  <br>  <br>  Congrats.|`|vXXDzBaKaa	Yes its normal, but it doesnt happen to everyone. Just a few lucky ones..:-)|`|BqXSymxjaa	Don't any of you people have a Dr.?|`|g3m7Z5Ewaa	The calories required increase during last trimester.  You should eat slightly more but not much more.
2ed5c5743ec637190dff1ac2f92e4f0aaa	Well, apparently, something happened pretty recently that started your periods to become irregular.  New job, college, sick something causing stress?  Supposed to start in October and going until January, with a negative pregnancy test given by the doctor in that time... that's a long time to go.<br>  <br>  There is a very good chance that you're pregnant.  From what my OB told me, it is pretty common to have some break through bleeding early on in pregnancy which could account for the January period if it was lighter than normal.<br>  <br>  Regardless, I guess you'll find out for sure next week!|`|QdIFhWjfaa	Ok, well i was ttc and thought that i had got luckky this month. Stomach aches, bloating, no spotting, a little dizzy and my period was a month late, but all neg tests. So my period showed up this morning, if they are neg (even blood) then your usually not pregnant, but good luck with your app. and hope you get the results you want|`|uIAHkm0Naa	youre probably knocked up|`|g3m7Z5Ewaa	My wife had tummy pains and was depressed we weren't getting Pregnant.  Like you did not have a regular period.  On the 12th Jan a home pregnancy test was negative, on the 13th a doctors test was negative.  Somehow by the 4th Feb she was 6 weeks pregnant.  It happens.|`|lQelUqFoaa	Well, i know my recent g/f had periods that were dead on schedule too. But once we started having sex they were all over the place. Been broken up for over a month now and no sex for two, so i know she isnt prego.|`|gT31DB1caa	my second child was concieved using the pull out method ... and one way to know for sure if you are pregnant when you go for the ultrasound you will either see a baby or you won't|`|qxlVHhkFaa	Cravings? Moody? Constantly Irritated in the last few weeks?
CuCrGDuRaa	Unfortunately morning sickness is different with every pregnancy and is difficult to predict.  I started getting morning sickness at 8 weeks and it got worse up until 18 weeks and then I had to be hospitalized for dehydration.  I'm now on Zofran because otherwise I can't keep any food or liquids down at all.  Your hormones actually peak at about 12 weeks, so you may feel sick for the next month but hopefully it won't last much past then.  Good luck!|`|NiOjHyfKaa	every pregnancy (even with the same woman) is different. with my pregnancy i was naseous constantly around the couple of weeks up until about 9 weeks. it went a way for a couple of weeks and cames back @13 weeks. i am now 16 weeks and still naseous 24/7.|`|i3pn4jNcaa	you probably just made yourself dizzy. your stomach is very sensitive while pregnant & im sure you know that from experience so from the moving around it probaby just didnt settle with your breakfast.

Don't be afraid, because I am your God. I will make you strong and will help you; I will support you with my right hand that saves you. <br>  <br>  Matthew 11:28-29<br>  Come to me, all of you who are tired and have heavy loads, and I will gives you rest. Accept my teachings and learn from me, because I am gentle and humble in spirit, and you will find rest for your lives. <br>  <br>  2 Corinthians 1:4<br>  He comforts us every time we have trouble, so when others have trouble, we can comfort them with the same comfort God gives us.<br>  <br>  <br>  Isaiah 40:31 (this one is my personal favorite, I turn to it often)<br>  But the people who trust the Lord will become strong again.

Sorry<br>  <br>  ETA: Here this is better:<br>  1. 2 Corinthians 4:16-18.<br>  <br>   That is why we never give up. Though our bodies are dying, our spirits are being renewed every day. For our present troubles are small and won't last very long. Yet they produce for us a glory that vastly outweighs them and will last forever! <br>  So we don't look at the troubles we can see now; rather, we fix our gaze on things that cannot be seen. For the things we see now will soon be gone, but the things we cannot see will last forever. (NLT)<br>  <br>  And this is the same as what I wrote earlier, just longer:<br>  2 Corinthians 4:8-12 (NIV) <br>  <br>  We are hard pressed on every side, but not crushed; perplexed, but not in despair; persecuted, but not abandoned; struck down, but not destroyed. We always carry around in our body the death of Jesus, so that the life of Jesus may also be revealed in our body. For we who are alive are always being given over to death for Jesus' sake, so that his life may be revealed in our mortal body. <br>  So then, death is at work in us, but life is at work in you.|`|723QHuicaa	We seem to give him back to you, dear Lord, who gave him to us.

Open our eyes that we may see more clearly, that in drawing nearer to you, we may draw nearer to those whom we love who are with you.

5dc42b275b638aa5e6b0b8b56bcb0c75aa	I'm not sure what the back story is with his mom and not having the shower, but in my family we tend to have showers later on in the pregnancy.  Like 7th or 8th month.  So before inviting all of his family, I would just tell his mom that your friend is planning a second shower and make sure his mom is definitely not planning any thing.  If she says she is not, then by all means invite the people who were left off the original list.|`|PYYh0E8Faa	You should not be throwing yourself a shower in the 1st place! Second if this is your second baby you should NOT being having a shower!<br>  <br>  Save yourself the headache of trying to answer this stupid question by not having a shower! Its that easy!<br>  <br>  You should still have everything from your 1st baby and if you don't thats your problem, not your families! Times are tough why put your family thru the hassle of throwing your spoiled *** another baby shower? It is fair! Really what makes you so great???|`|kbuHlPoVaa	I say go ahead and invite them.  What's the worst thing that can happen?  THey not show up?  You wouldn't want to disclude them from the party, cause an arguement and place your husband in the middle of a pregnant woman and his family :)  Best of luck!|`|29e94afbd94c485d06730324281a018aaa	In MY experience, I have never known anyone to have a baby shower for a second baby, UNLESS, the baby was of a different sex. Again, this is my experience only. Perhaps for others its different. <br>  <br>  In answer to your question, I'd say invite the folks. There is nothing more rewarding than making people feel like they are one big family.<br>  <br>  Hope it helps.|`|m2aznd8xaa	sure invite them just because it shows your the bigger person.  if they dont show its there lose not your and if they do fine also more gifts for baby right.|`|zATQaiwIaa	First off - under no circumstances is it proper ettiquette to throw yourself a shower! Ever!  So i hope that someone else is throwing you a shower.<br>  <br>  In answer to your other question - if someone else is throwing you the shower, you should ask them to include your husbands family on the guest list.|`|G766dQjtaa	I think you should invite them out of courtesy, if they come great if they don't at least you invited them.

1ezYfkX7aa	I would have it about 6wks before your due. You dont want to have it to early but you want enough time that whatever you dont get at your shower you can go out and get yourself.

I wouldn't wait till June...what if your baby comes early. I know plenty of people that scheduled their baby shower for about 4 weeks before and that was wayyyyy too close to their due date.

I'm due in at the end of Sept. but I'm having mine the last weekend in July ( almost 8 weeks before my due date), b/c i'd want to get it done then b/c i have a lot of things going on in August( my two best friends are both due in August) and definitely don't want to do it at the beginning of Sept. bc that's wayyy too close for me and i'll just want to relax and have everything ready.|`|KLUPLlzsaa	first week of may. It is always good to do it a couple of months ahead of time so you have enough time to get things together, and be prepared.

This way, you aren't having it too early, and it will still give you enough time to purchase the things that weren't given to you at the shower.|`|1bnhwGACaa	may im due the 17 of july im having mine on may 16th <br>  it gives me time to get everything put away and wash the clothes and see what else i need to get|`|nYioXmnGaa	I am only thirteen weeks  and My husband and his co workers already gave me a shower .I herd my  co workers are giving me a shower but i am not sure .|`|3a8c03abddba3f41c749843651814e92aa	I hope that other people are giving you your shower and you aren't giving your own!

2N6KEoVqaa	I plan on changing because the colors are much more fun in the older sizes. (I also use the Nuk silicone). I would assume that using a pacifier that is the correct size for your baby's mouth is important for proper oral health. If the only negative to moving up a size that you have heard of is that the child may not like it, then I would try the larger size out and hope that she does. If she doesn't, then maybe talk to her dr to see if there is a problem with using the smaller ones.|`|e4aF8tdPaa	my son has a mam pacifier. 6mo-9 i think it is. he loves it. i don't mind him having it but i would like for him not to use it once he is about 2 yrs old.<br>  <br>  if your baby pops it back out then you might need to get the next size|`|dXVA1wHDaa	My son wouldn't take the smaller ones at all, I have had him on the 6-18 mnth cherry teats since he was very young.

f9d25be9a86bcb470e6b157992207144aa	I would try and not worry, even though it is easier said than done. I would not be that "lucky" to be the 1 of the 250. Let the doctor do more U/S's and try and relax. Stressing is not good for you or baby. Good Luck with everything!!<br>  EDIT: I opted out of that test just yesterday b/c my husband and I saw no sense in worrying.|`|zBz10IiOaa	no hun don't worry yourself to death i had one done with my last pregnancy same thing fopr me it came back possitive and i had an 3d ultrasound and he did not whatsoever have it don't worry till you find out for sure<br>  i wont be having it with this pregnancy because i see no sence in worrying|`|445676ee4ba9ef6e5bd44f0f3b9d7501aa	Don't panic just yet.  I've read some where that around 1 in 6 mothers to be would come back with a FALSE POSITIVE for Down Syndrome.  This is exactly why your doctor wants you to get a second level ultrasound and examination.  <br>  <br>  I wouldn't worry too much.|`|52092e43afb48f25c3b2832d7f29ae10aa	Don't even sweat it... those tests are KNOWN for not being accurate.  Enjoy your pregnancy and stay positive.<br>  <br>  I failed mine twice out of 6 pregnancies  and none of my babies had any problems...|`|vIYqOG8Uaa	I have been working with people with all kinds of disabilities since i was 15, so for the past 8 years, I have seen everything you can imagine.  Chances are, it's no big deal, but if by some small chance your child does have downs, just be glad it's not something worse.  And it does absolutely NO GOOD to worry, because you can't change it now anyway.  The way I see it, you're gonna love him no matter what and you'll deal with whatever life throws at you when it gets here.  Be glad for the 3D ultrasound.  I only got the one normal one because that's all my insurance would pay for, and i would love to see her up close and personal.  I'm due in a week, and I opted out of the DS test... but just remember that everything happens for a reason, and live each day to the fullest as it comes at you.  No need to worry about things you can't change! :) Hope this helps!|`|rx0ekB9Paa	my doctor asked if i wanted to take that test and i said no. i asked if it was important and she said not really,and that just because you have a 1 in whatever chance of your baby having downs,that doesnt mean this kid is that 1 chance. i would stop worrying cuz theres nothing you can do if he has it or not. if ur that scared just do some research on raising a child with downs so just in case you are prepared|`|7add460ae24c9452ae87b5a99c5aa756aa	Well, I would be worried if I were you.<br>  If you have a child with DS, Id be worried.<br>  If you decided on other measures, Id be worried also.<br>  <br>  I really dont wanna sound like a ***** here, but the reality is that you had the testing done for a reason right?  If a child is positive for DS, it means that the body did not terminate the pregnancy naturally (as DS is a Chrom. defect).  A miscarriage usually occurs when that kind of thing happens.<br>  <br>  I guess ask yourself why you had the testing.  And what you want to to for the future regarding this baby.
ZDZlvqvsaa	If he does good with the cereal than I would say start him off with baby food at about 5 months. All babies are different; some do good with jarred food and others are not as good. Just start him out gradually and see how he does. My niece started on baby food when she was 4 months and she did great.|`|GCSFnc4Haa	My son started eating rice at 3 months and jarred food about 3 weeks later but formula was not filling him enough so my doctor told me to start him on jarred food...use your mothers intution if u think he is ready then is possible he is ready....if you want to try start with very small amounts i found feeding my son oatmeal mixed with just a little bit of fruits was the best way to get him started...NOW hell be a year tomorrow and he LOVES!! his fruits and vegggies not so into the meat though|`|dpMssGdnaa	I started my baby at 6 months with cereal. Then I started making her veggies then fruits and recently at 9 months lentils and tofu. I would suggest you make your own food its so easy you just either boil or steam puree and your done. I don't like jarred stuff anything that has food and expires in one year makes me nervous|`|qesCemuRaa	My daughter was 3 months and she was NOT getting full enough with just formula so my doctor suggested I try some rice cereal in her bottle & it worked like a charm!! Now that she's 4 1/2 months she suggested we try some solids.. She has tried squash, sweet potatoes, & carrots, and she absolutely loved them all & took to them very well.. I think all babies are different|`|8iBOF2h5aa	about 6 months of age. I've know some kids though that were eating table food at 2 months old.

zBz10IiOaa	thats braxton hicks hun.i started to feel mine at 16 weeks ugh it is so uncomfy when they happen i wish it was time for labor i,m so excited and can't wait for my 2nd son to come :)|`|tTh2Q7etaa	that is a contration. braxton hicks contrations and a regular contration feel the exact same. what makes them different is that the b h c are irregular. for example when you are in labor your contractions will come every 5 min and last for about 1 min. with the b h c it will last for 1 min and it will come one after another or they will be 2 min apart then it will come 10 min later then 7 min later then maybe 15 min later.  thats what they meen by irregular.|`|oWAUb6vpaa	Yes, sounds like it's those BH's. <br>  Supposedly, our uteruses contract from the very beginning but is not felt as the contractions are not strong. <br>  I'm on my third pregnancy and began having BH's during my second trimester (as you are) with all 3. <br>  <br>  Make sure to monitor them. You shouldn;t have more than 5 in an hour (that's the max.) If that does happen, call your OB's office asap. <br>  <br>  Those are BH's you're having and it's normal.<br>  <br>  Congratulations, mom and good luck!|`|mqHL4UcRaa	I just started to notice mine at 26 weeks. They usually start in the 2nd trimester (mine just went unnoticed for a while) It just gets tight for a few minutes then relaxes.|`|ulW2Nhunaa	It sounds like braxton hicks ... just remember braxton hicks doesn't hurt, they are not painful at all ! But they can start very early in pregnancy everyone is diffrent ... Good luck !!|`|54cf275d0238f8dd4d90351c9a055b00aa	Yes that sounds like BH contractions. We actually have them throughout the entire pregnancy its just as we get farther along and our uterus is bigger, it gets more noticeable. Good luck and congratulations.|`|AA11883252	My daughter is expecting her first child May 15th She has been experiencing BH off and on for a few months now. Sometimes babies do get into a position that makes the mother feel really uncomfortable. Feels kind of tight, as if something is stuck there.
60b853fe7d4335e1b74668b328b358b7aa	LOL!  Only from my husband.  He is very easily embarrassed.  Other people just laugh with me or smile.  My husband puts his head down and his face turns red, lol.|`|pXSKSS3daa	Lol. No, I get more smiles than weird looks, especially from other women. I think a lot understand and they've been there, done that.<br>  <br>  I do find it funny, though, when I'm going through the baby section and hear a mommy(or daddy) doing the same things as me! I think it's great that you can be silly out in public with your baby. I know I'll sing, talk, make silly faces, etc. to keep Noah happy while we're out.|`|Ojgqd4xNaa	I always sing, and dance for my little girl.  She loves it, and gets this huge smile on her face when I do it, so I do it all the time.  Whether were in public or not.  And I'm sure people stare, I'm not the greatest singer, I'm not even really good at all!  I don't care if people stare at me, my daughters having a good time, and that's whats important!<br>  <br>  My little girls only 4 months, so she doesn't go it a shopping cart yet, but when she does, I'll have one of those floppy seats, to protect her.  If people look at me funny for being a germ-a-phobe, that's fine too, they're not the ones that will have a sick baby.|`|471ca0c8552c4633e525815ba702310aaa	I don't get funny looks from just making funny faces and noises. I prefer to wear my son when out so I get all sorts of looks from that. One time I was in a store buying DS some new pants. I had him in front and his diaper bag on my back. The clerk was ringing up my sale and making faces and stuff at DS. One of her co-workers thought the clerk was making them at me because she didn't see DS on my front until she walked around. She told the lady I thought you were making faces at the customer since I didn't see the baby.|`|fHjSonssaa	I get crazy looks because we have a shopping cart/highchair cover that I take with is when we go to Target/super market/ restaurant.  I'm glad I do- They really don't wipe the highchairs down well and the last one my son sat in (with his cover) coudln't have been filthier.<br>  And as far as the Target cart goes- I just put the cover in there  because like most babies, his hobbies consist of seeing how many things he can put in his mouth in a day- so he'll lean right over and wrap his mouth on the cart- and I see all sorts of sicks kids get out of the carts and I think it's just kinda gross.  I don't care if people look at me though- I don't know how they can put their kids in those!!!|`|xK6wehG7aa	yeh I always wipe everything down with a lysol wipe: shopping carts, high chairs at restaurants, the end of the table he's sitting at, his toys if they fall on the floor<br>  <br>  People look at me weird, but he has only been sick one time in 7 months and that was when I forgot my wipes and he sat in a high chair. It could be coincidence, but I'm not chancing it again!<br>  <br>  Edit: When I'm in the store singing and making faces, I don't really notice anyone else, but I have seen other moms and dads doing it too. So i know I'm not alone! :-)|`|JT4OSUPeaa	No, I never look at people funny when they do that, I think its cute when they play with there baby in public and dont have a care in the world about what other people think. As far as wiping down the seat, thats terrible they were giving you looks because you care about germs and such. I will always do that.<br>  <br>  I was at the grocery store last Saturday and well Colten has learned how to blow raspberries (like make farting noises with his tongue) the funny part is he does it so randomly, we were down the card isle and he started doing it, there was someone on the next isle and she kind of poked her head around the corner. I'm sure she probably was wondering if I was just letting loose in the next aisle over. Which of course I wasnt.|`|ZadTQtJaaa	I get funny looks when I walk to the mailbox with my son.  Yes it's winter time, but it's not like I have the baby outside with a tank top and shorts on.  He's bundled up and warm... but people give me dirty looks like I'm a horrible mother for walking outside with the baby in the cold.|`|sBHhnDwaaa	Lol haven't gotten there yet!! Mom kept getting weird ones when we went to Wal Mart and she had Jamie in the Moby wrap... He was laying low and sideways, so it looked weird, and NO ONE here wears their baby in a wrap or sling.<br>  <br>  But hey, he loves it and slept the WHOLE time so... Bring on the looks!|`|GxMSrrFLaa	haven't been able to have the experience yet. But I can tell you, as long as you're making that baby happy and not whining about every little thing or screaming, those people should hand you flowers and a crown for the miss a-mom-ica award!|`|ntdGOZqGaa	I really dont know lol I dont pay attention to what or who they are looking at. I just play with my son. As long as he is happy and you are happy to hell what they think lol I never did do the whole wipe down the shopping cart or nothing|`|PDHCOrOSaa	I wipe the cart handle down with an antibacterial wipe and yes ppl look at me funny but it's not there kid so who cares.<br>  <br>  And yes....I make funny faces and "zoom" the cart through the aisle's but she has fun so what's wrong with that!? LOL|`|avyv2i4baa	lol im the same I just ignore them and  chat away to baby, <br>  <br>  lately when changing him he starts to giggle which sets me off,. :)|`|XTuhGaL1aa	Honestly, when I take my daughter out I don't look at anyone else. I may get funny looks for acting crazy but I have never noticed!|`|fUC4wCCEaa	Yes!!<br>  I talk to my son all the time, and not in a baby voice either.  I also wipe down everything.  I don't even pay attention to people any more.  If they look, they look.  It doesn't make me stop!<br>  I make silly faces and all that as well, I usually just get smiles ;)<br>  Keep talking to your baby, it is very stimulating and builds a great connection and bond!|`|CwUvYu66aa	i think that is good. i wipe down the cart too for my siblings. and all your doing is interacting with your son. thats not a crime nor a bad thing to do at all!
FQ4nhSiRaa	My son was 1 month early and weighed only 5 lbs. He is now at 6 months old 15.4. So he has tripled his birth weight. I dont know exactly what the "rule of thumb" is but the ped did tell me preemies and small babies will double, triple, etc their weight quicker because there wasnt as much there to start with. He is still only in the 15 percentile for weight but the doc said he is doing well on the growth chart and he eats well and is doing great.|`|h59Bc4wfaa	My son was a 9 weeks early and weighed in at 3lbs 11oz. <br>  At his 12 month check he weighed 22lbs and 31 inches long. He was right around where he was supposed to be. (Even for a full term baby)<br>  <br>  I'm thinking that even with preemies, all babies grow at different paces. If your doc doesn't say anything, then I'm sure he's fine.|`|fHjSonssaa	There is no rule of thumb- as long as they're gaining weight as they should.  My son was 7 weeks early and weighed 5 pounds 3 oz when he was born.  He's a few days shy of 11 months right now and I'm guessing he's about 19 pounds.  In general, they catch up to term babies or pass them - <br>  my.  His DR thought he would weight about 20 pounds @ the age of 1.  <br>  They do the % - our DR's does his adjusted- so he gets compared to other babois that were born at the same gestation as him, and then we also look at the comparison to full term babies sometimes.  He's always in the top for the most part of preemies- but much lower for full term, which is to be expected.  They just do this to show you where your child stands in terms of physical growth.<br>  My son wieghted the same as your at 8 months- about 16 pounds  He really slowed down for awhile, then he picked up gaining again. For the gestation your son was born, sounds like he's on a good track.|`|apJ3t9k8aa	see my son was just a month earlie and he has always been very small. to this day he is almost 3 ( in june) and is only 23 lbs. he was breast fed the first year too.  if the doc saw a problem you would know by now. other wise just realize that all children are different.|`|tQVBDx5Paa	Laura was two months early and her ped. says she should gain an ounce a day on formula and 3 to 4 ounces a week while breastfeeding....
44OH7Si6aa	The best way to avoid over indulging while pregnant is to make sure you stick to healthy foods. The extra calories you need for baby is equal to about 2 yoplait yogurts a day, not eating double what you already eat. Just because you have a craving doesn't mean you have to have it. I crave cinnamon rolls all the time instead I eat a bowl of cinnamon and apple oatmeal. Eat lots of small meals throughout the day it helps with the morning sickness a bit and keeps your portions under control later in your pregnancy. It takes a little bit of willpower but it really isn't that difficult.|`|yNbGq4viaa	I am not a skinny mini either.  I had an unplanned pregnancy and my son is absolutely fine.  I actually lost weight during my pregnancy because I had so much morning sickness, but my doctor told me under no circumstances was I to diet while I was pregnant.  They will monitor your weight gain closely.  As long as you don't see being pregnant as a license to eat anything and everything in sight and remember that what you eat, your baby eats, you should be fine.  Stick to fruits, veggies and lean meats and your baby will get all the things he/she needs without you becoming so large.  The key is not size, hon.  The key is being HEALTHY.  Good luck.  Remember, if you wait around for the perfect time to try to have a baby you'll be waiting a long time.|`|U0KCmsKXaa	If you're already pregnant, I say don't worry about losing weight.  Just eat healthy and exercise, walking everyday.  You can worry about dieting after the baby is born.  But even then, if you're breastfeeding be careful about how you diet.  The point is to always be healthy!|`|AA11222790	Just make sure you watch what you eat and workout.  You will definitely need to gain some weight whilst pregnant but, you don't have to gain a ton if you are heavy to start out with.|`|60a3bbdca78e74fb19db426e27b9a087aa	Since you're not pregnant work diligently on your weight loss between now and conception to try to get closer to your healthy weight.<br>  <br>  Once you conceive you can not lose weight but I have read that heavier women are urged by some practitioners, and some websites I've seen, to gain on the low end of acceptable weight gain for pregnancy, possibly even a little as 20 lbs, and you can still have a very healthy baby.<br>  <br>  Also you only need to add 300 calories when pregnant, that is very little! And most women are strongly encouraged to exercise throughout the entire pregnancy which will help you and baby be strong and healthy.<br>  <br>  GOOD LUCK|`|9P26sacKaa	The best ways to avoid unhealthy weight gain are to start exercising now and continue throughout your pregnancy (barring medical issues, of course) and to eat healthy food that fits your particular needs.  This may mean seeing a dietician or nutritionist now, before you are pregnant, to get an idea of what things will need to change.  <br>  <br>  Some women gain a lot during pregnancy and some gain very little, independent of their BMIs to start with.  It is important to gain weight over the course of your pregnancy, though many women actually lose weight in the first trimester due to morning sickness.  This is not an excuse to continue losing weight while pregnant, however.  <br>  <br>  Even if you do end up gaining more weight during pregnancy than you want to, it's never a good idea to try to lose that weight while you are still pregnant or to stop weight gain for the remainder of your pregnancy.  You will gain weight over the course of your pregnancy simply by the baby and uterus growing, the added blood volume, your breasts, and the placenta.  You may lose some fat while you are pregnant, and this is usually okay, but it's not really a good idea to TRY to lose fat during pregnancy.  <br>  <br>  Even just walking for 30 minutes every day will be a good starting exercise you can do now and throughout your pregnancy.  Swimming is a great activity for pregnancy and before.  Prenatal yoga is also wonderful for toning and light exercise.  It also makes you feel great after you've gotten used to it.  <br>  <br>  So... exercise every day and eat healthy throughout pregnancy.  Avoid fatty foods and the whites - white sugar, white flour, white rice.  These foods have very little nutritional value, thus adding calories without anything of value to your diet and your baby.  Cutting these things out - instead using natural sweeteners like honey or xylitol, using whole wheat breads and flour, and using brown rice/lentils/beans/legumes instead of white rice will improve your nutrition and diet immensely.|`|HPSApjGOaa	Walking is the best.<br>  Eat more fruits, and less starch.<br>  Eat lots of small meals instead of 2 or three big ones.<br>  Make sure a lot of that weight is not water.<br>  The doctor told you that because of possible dangers that we do not think of. <br>  Please, listen to the doctor, your midwife may know a lot, but after your examination, the doctor knows more.<br>  Your choice, your life, and that of the baby. You choose.|`|mF0L5jMNaa	my daughter was overweight before getting pregnant.  the desire to have a healthy baby and not develop diabetes has made a bid difference in her health.  she looks great!  walking, swimming, and eating better has changed her overweight status into baby weight.

Eat lots of fresh fruits and vegetables, drink skim milk and eat lots of cottage cheese.|`|hSJnaysiaa	So, I'm sort of confused about the question. <br>  <br>  I am overweight, but have had a healthy pregnancy (34 weeks 4 days with a boy). My doctor has never commented on my weight (though I know my weight is a problem) but I'm guessing he hasn't brought it up because for a pregnant lady, I've done well on the weight gain.<br>  <br>  Like I said, I'm 34 weeks (almost done!) and I have gained total 7 pounds. Which, at my last ultrasound (30 weeks) the baby himself according to their measurements was 3 pounds 10 oz, add in the amniotic fluid weight, plus a placenta, and the fact that I'm storing water like a camel (I've definitely noticed swelling of my feet/hands/face due to water retention) but add all those "normal" things in that cause weight gain and I've likely lost some weight during the pregnancy.<br>  <br>  I don't know how to be honest. I feel like I eat a ton more than before, but I suppose I am eating more healthy things, but not starving myself, and I don't deny myself things I want either (soda, chocolate, etc). I did have some bad morning sickness throughout my pregnancy (still happens just not as often as it used to) so that may have contributed to me not gaining much, but its not like that's something you plan.<br>  <br>  I would just say to try to not gain too much weight. A lot of women take pregnancy as an excuse to shove themselves full of anything and everything they want food wise all day long, which isn't healthy. I've looked at it from a standpoint though that I don't want my baby eating those things or when he's here, having those eating habits, and since he gets what I give him at this point, I have to make better choices.<br>  <br>  Don't let people scare you though. A healthy pregnancy is possible if you're overweight. And there are some "benefits" to being overweight and pregnant also. For one, I don't have to wear maternity clothes because I haven't gained much. I'm still in my levis and aeropostale shirts, not muumuus. I also am 8+ months pregnant and don't "show" (my husband and those closest to me can tell I'm pregnant, but its not obvious to anyone, which includes strangers). So, I don't have to deal with strangers grabbing at my belly or giving me unwanted advice (besides, I get plenty of unwanted advice just from my family and friends...its annoying).<br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|9bc0c41585ea1c2d5141469e11917d10aa	Eat five small meals a day.  Three servings of fruit and four servings of veggies.  That really help me a lot.
CYwha8Baaa	This has happened to me yes actually the EXACT PAIN<br>  <br>  I actually went to the doctor and I pulled my vagina muscle from sex... but it didnt hurt intill a day or so after really weird how it happened anyways...<br>  <br>  I am 6 months pregnant and I didnt start getting round ligament pains intill my 3 months you wont get the ligament pain unless your uterus is growing... but the pain is exactaly were you describe were I had my pain...<br>  <br>  Best thing for you to do is if the pain comes up agin today or tommorrow call your doctor and set an appointment because I have also had hernia's and that also might be a problem...<br>  <br>   The most common location for hernia is the abdomen. The abdominal wall - a sheet of tough muscle and tendon that runs down from the ribs to the legs at the groins(in between belly button and pelvic) - acts as 'nature's corset'. Its function, amongst other things, is to hold in the abdominal contents, principally the intestines. <br>  If a weakness should open up in that wall, and it does not really matter how or why it happened (more on this later), then the 'CORSET EFFECT' is lost and what pushes against it from the inside (the intestines) simply pushes through the 'window'. The ensuing bulge, which is often quite visible against the skin, is the hernia. <br>  <br>  These 'windows of weakness' commonly occur where there are natural weaknesses in our abdominal wall - such as where the 'plumbing' goes through it. Examples of these are the canals (inguinal and femoral) which allow passage of vessels down to the scrotum and the legs, respectively. The umbilical area (navel) is another area of natural weakness frequently prone to hernia. Another area of potential weakness can be the site(s) of any previous abdominal surgery.<br>  <br>  Just call your doctor I have had two surgerys one on a rupture sist and a hernia....
KPq8kdPjaa	First, I'd ask your OB.  They know your pre-pregnancy health status as well as your "mental" make-up.  But as mentioned in the previous answer, I think the "standard" response from the medical community is ~ 6 weeks, depending, of course, on your delivery and its complications.<br>  <br>  However, with OB's permission you may be able to start back sooner, perhaps starting slowly at +4 weeks and working up to a full schedule at the +6 week mark.<br>  <br>  But I'll tell ya...as much as you think you want to get back in the gym...you'll be exhausted, especially if you nurse (and then those pounds will FLY off anyway).  And finding the time isn't always the easiest as childcare can be an issue.<br>  <br>  As for me, I'm 43 and have a 2.5 year old and a 5-month old.  I was/am an avid tennis player and, thankful, had an understanding OB, husband and doubles partner.  I played competitively until I was ~24 wks and still was hitting the ball with 3 weeks to go (at 37 wks).  I was back on-court at the 3-week mark but didn't really feel up-to-speed for a few more weeks after that.<br>  <br>  Good luck with the remainder of your pregnancy and here's hoping for a speedy delivery and recovery.|`|iH2whFkHaa	You really should take it easy hun; if you were in good shape before you got pregnant it should be easy for you to get back into shape with minimal effort. Getting back on your exercise routine too soon could actually hinder you losing the weight because in those months after having the baby you are going to be recovering still and adjusting to taking care of a small baby; and you need to use your spare time for relaxation and rest. <br>  <br>  The best thing you can do is breastfeeding. I gained 39 lbs and it literally just fell off within a few months without me doing any type of exercise whatsoever; and believe me I have never been the type that just loses weight with no problem; then again I was also in good shape and that helps too.|`|Bhy4k9wPaa	Wait until after you have had your 6 week post natal check before starting any exercise like running (same with running with your little one in a stroller, and just make sure he/she is wrapped up warm so the wind isn't blowing in his/her face!). But you can go walking from when you feel fit enough to.<br>  <br>  Bear in mind, though, you might not feel like it! You will be exhausted from lack of sleep and a, likely, crying baby. Remember it took 9 months for your body to get this way, it will take at the VERY least that to get back to normal. 2 years after my youngest was born and i'm still not back to my pre-baby weight but i'm coming to terms with it now!|`|LXpjIH0Haa	Usually its six weeks after you have a baby. It also depends on whether or not you get stitches and how they heal. You're dr. will let you know after you have the baby. You'll lose about 10 pounds by the time you go home and some more the first few weeks. Then you have the rest that is harder to get rid of. Good luck and congrats on the baby!|`|dR4QN0gHaa	The rule of thumb is 6 weeks. Exercise can make bleeding worse. My bleeding was really light with my daughter and I felt fine so I started with light cardio at about 3 weeks after.|`|hXoUFWL1aa	Honestly, I didn't even feel up to it til my son was 3 months. Now I work out at home and sometimes I take him out in his stroller at the park.|`|2448af06b59df00dd8a1a3ac6d057c75aa	i started back to walking about 4 weeks after birth . i wouldnt run right away but and good fast walk ,|`|TLjNUJHLaa	I started doing walks, squats, and light exercises 2 weeks after I had my baby. I did get stitches, I didn't breast feed and my bleeding was light. I gained 36 lbs when I was pregnant and lost 22 lbs by the second week. But I'm pretty sure your doctor will tell you to wait 6 weeks. About the running in the stroller with you its going to depend on the weather. If its cold out I wouldn't take the baby. My baby is now 3 weeks old and he goes with me everywhere as long as its not to cold outside.|`|la1KlgJ3aa	you will have to ask your dr after you have your baby. Each person is different and depends on if you deliver natural or c-section, I believe c-section you have to wait alteast 6 weeks. I had my first child naturally . My dr said I was safe to go back to the gym at 3 weeks. Good Luck|`|Y3DR1EBUaa	probably when ur ob gives the ok at 6 weeks after... <br>  i gained 45lbs & breast feeding help a lot!! b4 i got pregnant again 5 months after i had lost like 35 lbs & i am 7 months pregnant & hav not gained a pound
4917bb54185a6e0ce588c170c8db1bc9aa	I did that. I just swirled the milk together. As long as it's all from the same 12- 24 hour period it's fine.  My lactation consultant told me.<br>  <br>  <br>  ceallaigh123 that has got to be out dated info. Breastmilk doesn't need to be refrigerated that fast and it's perfectly safe to combine pumpings.|`|iH2whFkHaa	Yes you can as long as the 'old' milk isn't older than 24 hours. You do not have to cool the freshly expressed milk before you add it, either. <br>  <br>  You can also add fresh milk to frozen milk as long as you cool the fresh milk first and the amount of the milk you add must be smaller than the amount of frozen milk.|`|oUtEVKDHaa	I would do that|`|nuBRcuwvaa	Sure, if you are going to use all that milk before freezing.<br>  <br>  Most working/pumping moms are making milk that they freeze for the future.  I don't think most mom's are relying on today's milk for tomorrow's bottles.  In other words, we are always trying to get ahead.<br>  <br>  If you're going to freeze the milk, then you need to store it in "meal" size bags because you wouldn't want to defrost and heat a big bag when you only need 1/3 of it...<br>  <br>  I don't think it does any harm as long as you don't freeze it... you just don't want to get in a habit of cooling the milk, heating it back up, cooling it, and heating it again.  Once cold, once warm, and then toss it.  Good luck!|`|gvLjbVFJaa	My lactation consultant said it was safe to combine pumpings into one bag or container, as long as it was all from a 12 hour period. I heard that it was okay even up to 24 hours, which I've done several times myself. I only use bags when I plan to freeze it, If I know I'm going to need it the next day for while I'm at work, I just combine the pumpings into a Rubbermaid container thing rather than using up all my bags.|`|F8iyUqJBaa	Yep!|`|i7oGjwJBaa	Yes, just don't add fresh milk into milk that was already refrigerated.  I pumped twice a day into bottles - I left the bottles at room temperature from the morning pump until the afternoon.  Then stuck them in the fridge at work after they were filled.  As long as the first pumping is refrigerated within 8 hours, and you don't mix warm and cold,  you're good.|`|qBtTAgBqaa	Yes it is okay to put them all in one bag.  Be cautious with this however. I'm not sure how old your baby is or how much he/she drinks in one feeding. But it is better to store breastmilk in 2-3oz packages, especially if baby doesn't finish a whole bottle. It's better to just warm up a couple more ounces if baby still wants more, then to think you could waste a lot of unfinished breastmilk.|`|KPq8kdPjaa	I did a lot of "mixing" but be careful not to co-mingle warm/just-expressed milk with milk that's already been cooled.<br>  <br>  You might consider pumping into storage containers that you can then wash/sterilize at home.  They make containers specifically for this purpose or you can just use some inexpensive baby bottles if they fit on your pump (mine did :-) )|`|3hIr3Dllaa	If it's expressed on the same day, you can mix it.  I do it all the time.|`|Vti7o1m5aa	Not unless you're lactating 3 different kind of milk! Just kidding. Here is your answer....|`|WGXdfh22aa	i always heard that you shouldnt mix it. i would look it up on the internet or ask a  docotor.
xRZ1PRZwaa	Yes! I was just looking at my end table (the table near where I nurse) and thought "hmmm...just cleaning that table will take me 3 hours!" Yikes!<br>  <br>  I did get all the kids' toys disinfected the other day, and the laundry is actually in the laundry room! Yeah! Progress.<br>  <br>  Ah - I'll clean tomorrow (seriously, because I need that table back!).<br>  <br>  *Edit<br>  <br>  Um, it's tomorrow and my table is still messy. Whoops!|`|CVdcrY3kaa	It does sometimes. I tend to be anal about getting my housework done, but never at the expense of my child. I'll do it while she naps, and I keep a daily schedule of what to do -- that way the entire house gets cleaned every week. Today has been a lazy day today, I'm suppose to be doing laundry but it's still laying in a pile needing to get put away..I'll do it later, my daughter's taking a nap and I've needed a lazy day.|`|IlyS8KGzaa	I would, but my boyfriend does not have a job yet, and my baby comes to work with me, so usually when I get home, the house is spotless.  My boyfriend gets evevything done by the time I get off work.  Sometimes I let my work build up because I am online or playing with my baby.  My boss doesn't mind because she does the same thing!!! lol|`|zcYl3ftTaa	Yes. A lot oftimes my wife waits for me yo come home from work to do some choes so I have my time to play with baby.|`|5aJ6E3JFaa	All the time!  For me though picking up clutter and organizing is a lot easier to just work in than actual CLEANING.  I hate cleaning, but dealing w/ clutter and doing laundry is something I don't mind doing.  I find that it is possible to multitask and have her be in whatever area I'm in so we can still be spending time together and interacting while she explores her world and I can be a little productive!|`|KPq8kdPjaa	LOL.<br>  <br>  I did with my first one.  But now that I have two, I can't really let it pile up too much.  Since the oldest is 2.5, she can "help" and we turn some of it into a game.  It's win-win for all of us.<br>  <br>  A little routine helps us:  get the groceries on Monday, iron on Tuesday, "special projects" on Wednesday, clean upstairs on Thursday, clean downstairs on Friday.  Laundry needs to get done every other day it seems.  Hehe...<br>  <br>  And with that routine...what doesn't get done this week, is left for next or done (some) on the weekends with Daddy's help!|`|1dueLOdvaa	Very rarely. I'm a clean freak, but I do take many breaks to stop and play with my kids.<br>  <br>  My 4 year old pretty much entertains himself, or he'll color etc while I do a little cleaning. And my 7 month old sits up now, so he likes to be on the floor with his toys.|`|quEkro0Faa	All the time..especially if I work alot that week. I get to the point I would rather spend time with my 11 month old than cleaning the house. The housework can wait..he's only going to be little for so long and he honestly seems to enjoy our one on one time|`|AA10988719	YES, ALL THE TIME!!!!!!!!!  Sometimes if I just had like 2 hours to myself I could get caught up, but that 2 hours never happens.|`|dR4QN0gHaa	Yes. I hate to but I feel like housework will ALWAYS be there but my kids will only be little once.|`|3hIr3Dllaa	yes, often|`|pXSKSS3daa	Sometimes, but usually not. I'm a bit of a clean freak so I'm either picking up while Noah is napping or he's able to entertain himself now(10 and a half months) so I'll pick up while he's playing.<br>  <br>  Our kitchen and living room are open to each other so I'm able to see him when I'm cleaning.|`|aJLx0nhNaa	Sure, all the time.  If we wanted a clean house out of this we could have skipped having the kid, I could have kept working and just hired a house cleaner.
KLUPLlzsaa	That actually happens. It is old blood from implantation and your endo lining. Just monitor it that it doesn't get heavier and cramping doesn't occur because that could be a sign of problems. Just relax and rest. Congrads!|`|ns1F0p8Laa	It is probably just a little spotting nothing too serious but ask your doctor.|`|xzh8r0jIaa	its called implantation bleeding, its normal. it is when the egg burrows into the uterine wall - that causes the spotting. it happend to me a couple of time during my 5th week, scarred the crap out of me, i even had some cramping b/c of it. <br>  <br>  but it should be much spotting - it may last about 5 days. i dont think its a miscarriage.|`|a65ec070ac47cd090dc1218e138ac837aa	Did you have sex recently? If so, that could be why. Your cervix is more sensitive during pregnancy. I had that brown spotting happen to me after sex and I freaked. It stopped after a day and everything's fine now. Maybe that's it.|`|a1x0xqARaa	That's spotting.  Natural.  But if you see blood, watch it.  A lot of people bleed during pregnancy.  It's normal too.  But if you start cramping while you're bleeding, that could be serious.  That's when you need to call your dr.  Good luck!|`|G2IoZpeqaa	It is not unusual for that to happen all is well here|`|0U9469GAaa	It could be implantation bleeding..this is usually the week that the egg sets in the uterus
W1p6LetFaa	This is my first (a girl) and I keep craving milk shakes, slurpees, ice cream bars, chocolate dipped ice cream cones... Basically anything cold and creamy/sweet, which is funny because it's February.  I laugh at myself every time when I'm sitting in McDonald's with my big pregnant belly inhaling an ice cream cone while the snow is whipping outside.|`|YfwgvPaCaa	My first one I craved pickled eggs and pickled sausages but was always hungry with her and could not eat anything too sweet.<br>  My second - boy - I couldn't hardly eat anything with him but raw Bermuda Onions dipped in Ketchup, A1steak sauce, and anything (even salad with chicken which I ate with lots of onions) with Tabasco sauce. If it didn't have Tabasco on it, the smell of the food would make me sick or I couldn't digest it properly (won't go into details on that one) lol . <br>   I also craved crushed ice ALL the time throughout that pregnancies. <br>  They are now 11 and 8 and their eating habits reflect what mine were when I was pregnant with them. Odd isn't it?|`|J6WSMpTlaa	It seems like ur gonna have a girl!<br>  Congrats!<br>  think of baby names yet?|`|0C6VJ8mqaa	popsicles and nachos|`|sRy2SKpXaa	With my 3 year old son, I craved hamburgers. Whoppers, double cheeseburgers (not healthy, I know) but I also ate a lot of salad. And I loved milkshakes. Now i'm 30w 3d with another boy, and it is pizza, and fruity things, like yogurt, fruit juice, jello, ice pops, etc. I don't believe anything they say about food cravings being related to the gender, because mine are completely different, and their both boys! Good luck.|`|vygYFdsSaa	I don't know the gender yet :( And it seems like my cravings are changing by the week!!!<br>  <br>  I've been eating TONS of my mom's homemade chicken and rice soup :) So delicious...<br>  <br>  My most recent craving is extra crispy french fries with ketchup from the local pub :) They're big but not too potato-y and they're just perfect, lol.|`|zF4acGKPaa	1st i craved mcdonalds double cheese burgers (girl)<br>  2nd i didnt have any noticeable cravings (boy)<br>  3rd was A1 sauce (boy)|`|be5076c0b98b495ffe00aade08f96b65aa	I have craved:<br>  <br>  Fish<br>  Shrimp<br>  Tacos<br>  Twix Bars<br>  Kit Kat Bars<br>  Ice Cream<br>  Potato Chips<br>  Chocolate<br>  Pepsi<br>  <br>  All in that order, and I am having a girl!|`|OT6vCUU1aa	I dont know what Im having yet but so far I have had a craving for Cinabon and I need to have apple slices and cheese curls on hand at all times lol.|`|4byrQqgOaa	Vinegar!|`|3a8c03abddba3f41c749843651814e92aa	This is my first and I know it is a girl and I have been craving sweet things... I was never really a sweet liking person|`|Sx7ohLM7aa	my bff ate brownies dipped in mustard when she was pregnant with a girl|`|gb3brjnuaa	I only had one child but I craved salsa, steak and mangolian food ugh but I hated  chicken.. Good luck Congrats.|`|bYhqPOtwaa	I craved broccoli & cheese, taco bell, and dairy queen ice cream cones.<br>  <br>  I have a boy.|`|faPKwClPaa	I craved sour things during the first trimester, nothing really during the second, then sweet things the third (boy).
lGcpXteaaa	I think honestly, your been a little silly. I know how you feel though but its *nothing* compared to losing your baby.<br>  <br>  I lost one of my twins and the ultrasound technician said she thought she saw a 'tidge' although she had her legs closed...<br>  So i went through thinking i had a boy. Which was what i was hoping for. At birth obviously i found out she was a girl. I was still so happy even though i had my heart set on a boy. I was just so glad that this one was healthy and alive in my arms. Not like my other little hunny in heaven.<br>  <br>  Just be thankful that he is healthy and you get to see his little face. Some people dont get to experience this.<br>  All the best x|`|AA10315542	I have experienced 3 pregnancy losses and am amazed that someone who just had a healthy baby is comparing "gender disappointment" to the actual loss of a child.  This is distubing, especially for your son.  I think you may need to get some counseling also.|`|CuCrGDuRaa	This hasn't happened to me, but has happened to several women I know.  That is part of the reason why my husband and I have decided to wait until birth to find out their sexes.  I'm sure it will just be a matter of time and then you will forget that you had been prepared for a girl.  But it is makes sense that you feel the way you do right now.  Just take it one day at a time and pretty soon you won't even think about what it would have been like to have a girl.  Plus, there is always next time!  Good luck!|`|GUUgeptjaa	Ok I understand gender disappointment, but you had two weeks before he was born to return things and adjust.  Another reason I am a fan of 3D ultrasounds (its pretty clear there) and also I would never have bought a closet full of any genders clothing on two ultrasounds, I didn't buy anything for my baby until I had 4 ultrasounds and 2 3D ultrasounds telling me the gender of my child, and I still have kept the receipts and tags even though I am told by 8 different ultrasound techs that they are 100% sure of the gender and have 3D pics proving the gender.<br>  <br>  You need counseling really, because my second, I felt was a certain gender and was told my second could be that gender and I got some things for each gender and some gender neutral stuff, I was a little sad when I got the opposite of what I thought I was getting, but when I saw my baby all of that ended and I never looked back.  <br>  <br>  But with you idea of thinking its like a miscarriage then Id say you have a lot more then gender disappointment and may look at that being linked to postpartum depression.|`|n8vBnA9Iaa	I feel really bad for your son. You feel like he was a miscarriage. Please don't tell him any of this when he is older. He will be devastated. <br>  This is why you should never rely on ultrasounds. They are never a 100%. And to buy all girls clothes? Wow, what a waste of money. You should of bought generic clothing and then bought gender ones, once the baby was here. <br>  Be happy with what you have, not what you could of had. Enjoy your son for what he is, not for what you wanted him to be. <br>  <br>  Maybe you will get a girl next time or destined to have all sons. Babies are wonderful, no matter their gender.
pCZPtegeaa	I'll put this politely, unlike the first poster.<br>  <br>  If you're really concerned, and nobody's explanation can comfort you, then you should really speak with your pediatrician.<br>  <br>  Best wishes.<br>  <br>  Edit:<br>  --------------------<br>  I guess you shouldn't ask your pediatrician.|`|1WenTp01aa	I agree with blondie, it was the first thing that came to my mind.  My 14 month old son does it.  I know it is hard not to, but I definitely wouldn't worry about the holding the breath thing.  At worst, she will pass out and start breathing again.  I suppose bottom line if you are still worried about it, you could take her to the doctor.|`|9QVjNaIPaa	no way to say it nicely...she's humping. of course they don't know what it is but it does make them 'feel good' and relax them. my daughter used to do the same thing and i was just as concerned as you are but after much research i have learned it is very normal. as my daughter got older she began using blankets or a stuffed animal when going to sleep in bed as well.|`|FP8Avd3oaa	She hold her breath and moves up and down, like she is trying to get out? Well that is normal some children just don't like being restrained, at 11mths just tell her no she will understand. If I'm confused then I suggest talking with you doctor at your next check-up!|`|Fsr2Rofzaa	I would think it has something to do with being strapped down, a lot of babies do that to try to wiggle free.  But if you think this is a problem I'd def. talk to your ped. about it.  I do not however, at 11 months old think your daughter is humping as another poster stated|`|nhgQKvwEaa	I would take her to her doctor and ask them, I do not believe she is "humping" as a couple of others said that. It kind of sounds like it, but she's too young for that, at least in my opinion. But we are not doctors, we don't know.|`|1S7uXsInaa	Maybe it has something to do with being confined to a space, like being claustrophobic?  That's the 1st and only thing that came to mind.|`|AA10988719	Maybe she is curious?  Perhaps she is trying to look out the windows of the car, or see what is going while in your arms or in the grocery cart?  unsure about the sweaty thing.|`|q4rG5Dwtaa	Sounds a little like autism, does she make eye contact with you, does she look when you call her name? How is she around alot of people?
hOOs3SQhaa	Hello there. <br>  I'm 10 weeks in my 3rd pregnancy and this was the first time I had to deal with being sick...the best advice that I can give that has actually somewhat worked for me--is to force yourself to eat a bit of protein as soon as you start to feel hungry (cheese, meat, cracker w/ peanut butter)--it might be hard to stomach it because of course those things don't sound good at all-but if you can just get a bit in, I find that it stabalizes your blood sugar well enough so that you can eat something else until you feel satisfied.|`|obXAeNW5aa	try nibbling on crackers that helped me and about 10million other women out there as for the smells good luck that hard i couldn't stand the smell of coffee or men's cologne the whole of my pregnancy soon u will be able to eat better right now there are no safe foods u just have to try and eat and see if u can keep from losing it  good luck if i really was queasy i ate cracker my 2pregnancy i think i lived on them|`|sRy2SKpXaa	That was my main problem with this pregnancy, the aversions to food. Foods I used to love would make me sick at the smell or sight of them. However, one of the things I COULD eat all the time was salad, go figure, haha. I could not eat ketchup though. And I love ketchup, can't not have it, haha. Just try to stick to plain things, if that makes sense. Jello, cereal, pudding, yogurt. Things that are bland. And don't worry about the not being able to eat. Just make sure you take your vitamin everyday and try your hardest to eat good things. Good luck.|`|vygYFdsSaa	I'm so sorry :( I had terrible morning sickness/food aversions all through my first trimester so I do feel your pain. I actually ended up losing weight my first tri because I couldn't eat many things at all and would ultimately throw up most of what I did eat. You just need to keep offering yourself foods until something sounds and tastes good... I was living off homemade chicken and rice soup for awhile :) Experiment with different things, even if you didn't like them pre-pregnancy. It should get better within the next 1 or two months; it did for me, at least. Just eat as much as you can, always take your prenatals, and let you doctor know whats going on with you, he might be able to offer you solutions. Like I said I lost weight my first trimester but I'm doing great now and so is my baby, so don't worry too much.|`|8oAlBL91aa	Oh gosh I thought when you said finally you meant like thank god I hate some foods now lol. <br>  <br>  Now i can't get enough salad, I cannot stand the taste or smell of bananas, I have been eating lot's of chicken but can't stand the chicken that has been in soup. Eventually with time you start to love those foods again. I highly doubt you'll be hating every food just wait until you get into your second trimester things will start to perk up.|`|1d02fcff81d2bb070fc361fbe28e3606aa	Food aversions are often replaced by food cravings later on.  In my case, I too felt an aversion to a lot of healthy foods, namely veggies.  Just the smell of them made me want to run out of the house gagging!  At that time, I lived on ginger ale and raisin English muffins.  That was all I could eat for months that didn't make me choke.  Hopefully, you are taking a good pre-natal vitamin.  I never got over my food aversions, but later I developed some food cravings.  In one pregnancy, it was the proverbial pickles.  Couldn't leave home without a baggie full of them!  In another pregnancy, it was anything citrus.  At this point, just eat what you can tolerate and make sure you are taking your vitamins.  Good luck!
b8f0CfSsaa	You shouldn't try to move the baby yourself, your doctor or midwife is the only person who can do that!<br>  <br>  Sometimes the baby moves his/herself so its quite common for doctors to wait until the eleventh hour to try and move them!|`|44OH7Si6aa	Don't do anything, she/he still has time to turn on his own. Your doctor will be the one to try to flip the baby if need be.|`|159e15bc29abe3e551d868753b39f233aa	your doc will deal with that.|`|wxImZRssaa	My daughter was breech. I was told to try going down on all fours, then resting your arms down so your bums stuck in the air. This gives the baby more room, so that they are able to turn.<br>  <br>  My baby wouldn't turn. At 39 weeks the doctor tried to turn her. They push on your belly to try to move the baby round, this procedure can induce labour, and even cause the baby to be in distress. It also hurts quite a bit. Its called an ECV.<br>  <br>  They couldn't budge my baby so at 39 weeks I went in for a c-section.|`|0bX3uZ3Baa	it's fairly normal. it may mean you're not quite as far along as you think. but my baby girl was breech at 36 weeks and turned herself by the time she was born at 37 1/2 weeks. if the baby stays breech, they will probably try to turn the baby.|`|la9zji2Uaa	This happened to my friend and they said he wouldn't move so booked her in for a section. On the morning of the section they gowned her and decided to do one last scan and guess what.... He has turned. So they sent her home. x|`|i3pn4jNcaa	i just looked it up and your dr can put your baby in the right position. just by moving your belly around|`|5jjGo6XTaa	it is a good thing your baby is breech your baby had moved so when the time comes he or she is ready you baby may more around again by them selves but its ok if your baby is already breech your around that time its nothing to worrie about you baby maybe like this for the reast of the pregnancy and you even maybe become 1cm 2cm dialated but it never means your gonna go into labor early.|`|MujKSebLaa	Get down to your local pool and get swimming.
4917bb54185a6e0ce588c170c8db1bc9aa	We played a fun game at my shower. We had a plate with numbers around it. Like 1-5 we each got a little spoonful of baby food with each number and had to write down what we thought it was. The one with the most right answers won. We also did baby bingo. I didn't want any of the "guess how big her belly is games. I liked the baby poo guess though. We got cheap scent free diapers and melted candy bars on each of them. Then you could sniff, touch and taste the "poo" to figure out what it was. Again, most right wins. <br>   Just serve simple food like sandwiches and such and don't forget the baby shower punch. Sherbet and 7 up. You can add fruit punch or pineapple juice to it too if you want. It's so yummy.<br>  <br>   Oh you can also play to oh so popular clothes pin game.

Also look for decor at online sites. I had to do my own shower so I did a lot of research. I got bright colorful tablecloths, multi colored napkins and cups. Rec centers are good places to have showers at cause most ppl know where the local one is. Go online to find really cute invitations.  Make or buy here a keepsake box for all the cards, bows, and little kick knaks from the shower. That was my favorite thing, I'm saving it to give to my lil girl. And get her one of the little books that you write the gift and guest list in. Hope this helps!
BXd4I9mmaa	transvaginal is an awesome word|`|Fh4B88ZGaa	I suppose they could, but I'm not sure why you would want one, since it's just going to look like blobs anyway. Doesn't hurt to ask.|`|vygYFdsSaa	I've never had experience with this (my u/s was for pregnancy so they automatically gave it to me), but they are obviously capable of taking a pic, so I don't see why they wouldn't give it to you.|`|3a8c03abddba3f41c749843651814e92aa	You could ask them for a copy, but make sure to tell why you want it so they don't think you are a weirdo and want to make up a fake pregnancy or anything...|`|JRXpYW3Naa	They might if you ask. When I was 12, I got one of my gallbladder. I was amused by it, now it seems kinda weird. Well, that was abdominal, though...|`|aNrjfpyaaa	There wouldn't be much of a point they might think your a little goofy|`|1K0n0Sk8aa	why would you want a picture of somethings thats not a pregnancy ??
muTZeGOgaa	The actual statistical failure rate is 25%. That means that out of 100 people using the pull out method in a year, 25 will end up pregnant.<br>  <br>  It's not a good method at all.|`|DF6ihDDCaa	Pretty likely. <br>  I would definitely not suggest it by any means<br>  if you do not want to get pregnant.|`|73808e403987212ba673162fcda0802daa	There's always a good chance you can still get pregnant no matter what method you use.|`|DRb4Qlypaa	The "pull-out method" = just as much of a chance of getting pregnant as not pulling out!|`|d6dzoHvvaa	very likely because there is still the precum that occurs.|`|AA11993919	The same as not pulling out.|`|r3jMts26aa	I am 34 weeks prego the pull out method does not always work. There is that pre ***. If the *** even gets near the vagina opening and some how gets in you can get pregnant.|`|a1x0xqARaa	I actually know a couple that got pregnant on the pull out method.  There is always pre-ejaculation that can still get you pregnant.  Not an effective birth control method!|`|dd5d0f065b45c14a02d51f88fefe773eaa	If you want I can go get my 3 1/2 year old and let him tell ya...that's how he was conceived!! LOL!!!|`|4SZ8EEsraa	Very likely. pre *** can get people pregnant. dont do it unless you want a kid.
H74F8jxuaa	Yes, if you were ovulating during this time then implantation can occur 6-12 days, so there is a possibility to get pregnant that quickly.|`|OqBkdIfFaa	yep, pregnant within a couple of hours...|`|LXSq2K1kaa	of course it is a possibility. sperm can last on the ovaries for 7 days. i would take a test
t4HXotwEaa	My husband could feel mine.  And yes they can fall out, mine did and now i'm 12 weeks pregnant.  But its a good thing.  Just check once in a while to make sure it's still in there.|`|5bc21d2d2a57683cdbd5ef3c4094ebc4aa	You can actually remove the NuvaRing during sex and then put it back in afterwards if you are worried about him feeling it.  You are still protected if you do this.|`|Q05rrSX4aa	You want to push it up as far as it will go.  If you leave it that close to the outside of you, it will fall out.  Your partner may or may not feel it during sex, but if it is only up there about an inch, they will feel it and it will fall out.  You can get it back there pretty far.  Its hard to do sometimes, but it wont hurt anything in you.
QM7cAE4vaa	I never even heard of that.|`|7Bsb0CNQaa	Strep B in the most extreme case can cause death in a newborn baby if gone undetected, but in the majority of cases baby is given antibiotics and all is well.  <br>  <br>  My niece gave birth at 27 weeks as the Strep B (found out much later this was the reason) caused serious recurring urine infections which in turn caused early labour.  Baby didn't contract the virus at birth and is now a normal 3 year old.  However, it wasn't until her second pregnancy it was diagnosed and thus this was the cause of the first premature birth ... she was given close attention and gave birth to a boy at 39 weeks.  He was given antibiotics at birth as a precaution.<br>  <br>  I asked my midwife to be tested for Strep B as a precaution and she informed me that the test was innaccurate and a result one could be different to the next hence why it isn't funded by the NHS due to the unreliability of it!  She stated they only test if there is serious question/symptoms for it.<br>  <br>  I am glad all is well with your pregnancy.  Good luck and congratualtions when your little one arrives.|`|goNi28Eraa	I tested positive for strep B.  My doctor told me about it Monday and said I will have to be treated with antibiotics before I have my son so he doesn't catch it.  He said I can't treat it now because it will just come back which sucks.  I am glad I know about it now so it can be taken care of before my son is born.|`|a88c35ef9c55d87377ccb9c18365cc44aa	They test for it here (US) in all pregnant women. At every Doctors appointment they test a urine sample for it and if it comes back positive at any time during your pregnancy, they will prescribe you antibiotics for that time and also have you be on antibiotics during labor.|`|IdWleKAyaa	GBS is quite common however most babies are fine even if the mom is a carrier..GBS only becomes a concern if the mom herself becomes sick with it during labor like she develops a fever..you can carry GBS and Not get sick from it (kinda like havin a cold sore virus but no cold sore on your mouth)..Breaking the membranes (having your waters broken) puts the mom at higher risk of developing an illness because of the GBS. I have had GBS many times but only became sick with it once, my first child and I was induced and my waters were broken. They gave me antibiotics and my son antibiotics for 4 days he never showed any signs of sickness at all..I also have carried GBS and never gotten sick with it had completely healthy babies with no problems. And the last pregnancy I did not have GBS at all...GBS can be a concern but you also have to completely educate your self of all the risks because OBs see no problem with fear mongering
A0W1ezmbaa	1st off its your responisibility to educate yourself well i too was raised by my dad and know how hard and uncomfortable things can be! The dr should have told you that it usually takes 1 month for the birth control to be effective and it needs to be taken everyday at the same time or at least with in the hr ex. if you take it at 9pm then always take it between 8 and 10pm but try to get as close to 9pm as possible. When its not taken properly there is always a higher risk of pregnancy and your dr should also have told you that you should ALWAYS use a condom to further prevent preganancy and protect youself from things like stds. There is only one bc that is 100% effective and thats abstenence.<br>  As for the way your feeling it could be a hormonal imbalance due to starting and stoping your bc and not taking it properly. It could also be that your preggo. you'll have to wait and take an at home pregnency test and if your symptoms continue i would see the dr as soon as you can get it. He/she will be able to guide you through whatever one it is.|`|159e15bc29abe3e551d868753b39f233aa	well starting and stopping can mess things up. anything else, take a pregnancy test. or go to a doc, or get a blood test.
m2aznd8xaa	they learn so much in one year. from being so  delicate. to learning how to crawl and walk. from breast milk only to after 4 months eating baby foods and juices. clothing outgrowing faster than you can even put the outfit on. baby learning to communicate. learning babys ques . dangers are shaken baby syndrom when bad parents dont have patience on a little baby..crib death from not followeing crib rules to keep sheets to a minimal and no toys in crib. baby choking on foods when given to early or not appropiatly.  baby bumping head when learning to walk ,not child proffing home etc etc. the dangers are endles s for a baby and any child at any age really. parents need to be educated to learn self control and know all possible ways to prevent dangers.|`|BxrU8kUJaa	read your textbook|`|rx0ekB9Paa	wow is this for a school assignment?<br>  <br>  birth to 1. well the first couple months they just sleep,eat and dirty their diaper. then they start to crawl,then walk and they start to try to talk during this time also.<br>  <br>  no matter what age there is all kinds of dangers that can happen. theres millions of what ifs that can happen<br>  <br>  i dont think its that important to go crazy about research cuz indians did it not knowing anything (i mean no books or articles to read)  and look,obviously theres something that just helps. books and articles can only help so much,after that you just have to let your instincts kick in.
e8Z2FVofaa	Lora half here....<br>  <br>  The exercises help condition the muscles.  Even though in their resting state they are tighter, when you work em out, you also increase their ability to stretch.  The more your vagina stretches the less likely you are to tear, because your vagina will accommodate the passage of the baby, and not cause the skin to rip.  What actually tears is the patch of skin between your vagina and anus.  <br>  <br>  Sometimes when it appears you might tear the dr. will cut this skin so that you at least have a clean cut, which won't bleed or hurt as much and is better for you than a tearing wound.  Then they have an easy time stitching it up versus a ragged wound from a tear which takes way longer to heal.  They call it an episiotomy.<br>  <br>  Congrats on your baby and good luck to you.|`|MMj7YcXkaa	lol  they will cut you  Its called a pesiatemy (its spelled wrong)|`|Bhy4k9wPaa	The perineum (that's SO not spelt right there is it/ lol) is on the outside and has nothing to do with having a tight vagina. Doing kegels isn't so prevent tearing so much as to help with the stretching the vagina does (makes it easier to 'bounce back') and to make sure you don't have bladder issues after.
EOW8DOoNaa	awww my babys 4 months old i remember when i was pregnant...:) okay but anyway did it have a ting of blood in it? and whatever if it didnt it could be possible you can have her anytime between Tonight or within 3 days  i think you might make it to not get induced i got induced when i was 3 days over due and im a young mother (19 years old) and boy you do not want t oget induced the contractions are much worse but meh you gotta do what you gotta do thats IF you dont have the baby by TONIGHT WooHoo!!!  :)|`|irGE84Qdaa	u could be go in to labor but this is not the actual sign of labor hun,i wish the best luck for u i kno how u feel i can only pray for u that u go into labor naturally but if u have contractions or ur water broke these r the ultimate signs of labor only losing the mucus does not mean u,ll go in labor soon cuz i have lost mine when i was 37 now i m 38 weeks and few days still no sign of labor.<br>  good luck|`|AA11222790	You can lose it 2 weeks before you go into labor.  But, it is likely that you might be having her before Tuesday.|`|5pgVIlLFaa	Oh Get ready to go . You should start getting contractions by tonight or morning. Awww a baby! Congrats|`|a1x0xqARaa	Quite possibly!  Call your Dr.  You should at least get an exam done to see what's going on.  But if you aren't contracting, then I would't worry quite yet.  But I heard that your water can break easier once you lose your plus, and once you lose your water, contractions start!  I don't know because they had to break my water.  I was dilated to 9 when I went in and litterally had my son 2 hours later!  Good luck!|`|UmqLkwAraa	Well with my last baby I walked the stairs a lot just to have her it helps to move them down. And walk a lot they say sex helps but it did for my son but not my girls. So everyone is differnt. Bending ur knees and getting back up helps. you can look up on google things to help move her down. Well good luck !!! Wish u the best|`|iGlXhQw5aa	It is indeed possible. But it doesn't mean you will. You can loose your mucus plug up to 2 weeks before having a baby. Since all is harmless. Walk walk walk! Good luck and hope s/he comes soon.|`|erKyfwSbaa	Sorry there is no sure guideline of when you will go into labor. I didn't go into labor until a few days after I lost mine. <br>  <br>  I feel your pain though. I didn't go into labor until 42 weeks...ugh!|`|NADlb5Ffaa	You could definitely be having her before Tuesday! Good luck!!|`|DWLfKACYaa	I expect you will soon start having contractions|`|G2IoZpeqaa	Its called a show...you will go into labour soon before Monday she will be born|`|g7wQij2Oaa	oh yeah.. it's close! good luck!<br>  <br>  :)|`|jQDeTTVhaa	its possible I didn't lose mine until I went into labor at 40wks 5days.I hope you have her before getting induced good luck|`|AA12035186	You're getting ready to have that baby soon.  I'd bet on it before Tuesday for sure.  When I lost mine, it was less than 12 hours.  Best wishes and congrats!
dd8cb229ee241de8ca385f84ec4b33d7aa	Yes you could be<br>  <br>  You need to take a test<br>  Use the first urine of the day, best for early pregnancy<br>  <br>  I hope you the answer you want|`|KPkLwdn1aa	You could be.  Get a test kit at the drugstore to find out for sure.
fnHvzmyEaa	my daughter caught it from just playing at a soft play area, it didnt seem to bother her though, doctor told me that adults were likely to be immune but i caught it and had it worse than my little girl!|`|eytlIKITaa	It is very contagious, but I wouldn't worry about it too much.  It's not really that bad...  But I can understand how your feeling.  Just keep checking his palms, bottom of feet and mouth.  Good luck!|`|ntdGOZqGaa	Yuck, I would be prepared for your son to catch it, sorry hate to say it but I would rather think he was going to catch it and be fine then the other way around.  My son has never had HFMD but it looks awful and my son jut got over a bad bacterial infection in the mouth from his cousin! So just be prepared|`|ckxpknr0aa	HFMD is pretty contagious - my son caught it from a playmate though they had little physical contact. It's not as bad as it sounds though mine only had it on hands and feet (looked sore but he was fine) and not in mouth which can apparently cause feeding trouble.<br>  <br>  We went to the doc who confirmed it was a viral rash (HFMD) which cannot be treated with any medicine. <br>  <br>  We were more bothered about it than my son ever was, so try not to worry, it won't be his last rash!!|`|gBEq0zo5aa	My doctor said it's only contagious if kids are sharing cups and stuff like that. Your son will likely be fine. Also, even if he does get it (and it is pretty common) it will go away pretty quickly- it's not a damaging illness or anything. Good luck!
Fsr2Rofzaa	this is easy, he's a guy.  They are not wired like women.  I have never in my life with 4 kids expected any type of gift from my friends for my child.  I really think you are thinking to deeply about this.  It really isn't a big deal|`|WlU3NFu6aa	Maybe he just doesn't realize that he should. No offense to men, but alot of them just dont think that way. Wait until her first bday. he may go all out and get her something big. If he still doesnt get her something, then I would talk to him about it|`|p2Njf5gBaa	Guys, especially single guys (because they don't have a women to help them with ideas)  are clueless as to what a baby needs or how to shop for a baby.  Especially a girl.  <br>  I would try and not take it personally.  Many men are too macho to purcahse a card and write something nice in it as well.  <br>  <br>  I have a best friend, who has a son a few months older then my son, and she has never bought my son anything.  I have gotten her son things, but she is tight on cash.  I'd rather she didn't overextend herself purchasing my son something that we are perfectly capable of providing for our son.  Although her mother buys my son things and puts both of their names on it.  <br>  <br>  I really don't think there is any polite way to approach this subject.  Although I am sure he will get her something for her birthday.|`|ax2t6AVzaa	1- maybe he's just "not that into babies"<br>  2- maybe he doesn't like to give gifts to babies because they can't properly thank him.<br>  3- maybe he sees how many other gifts baby has received and doesn't think baby needs any more.<br>  4- maybe his presence in baby's life is the greatest gift anyone could receive, (or at least he may believe so).|`|LXpjIH0Haa	You never know, but it could be that he feels jealous or it hurts him that you have a baby. Maybe secretly he also wants to have a baby. My baby is 2 1/2 months old and my only cousin on my mom's side, who I grew up with as a sister didn't get me a gift or anything. But I know its because she and her husband have been trying to get pregnant for 6 years and it's too painful for them. You never know what's going on in his mind. <br>  Or it could be it just didn't occur to him to get you a baby gift. Maybe he doesn't know that you're supposed to get something for a baby.|`|ntdGOZqGaa	Not to be mean but I find the fact that you guys are sitting around thinking and talking about what all people have and havent gotten your child is selfish. Does it really matter who gets your child something? I cant think that I would disown my friend bc he or she didnt get my child a card or a present. I havent gotten my friends anything for their babies and the same thing with them to me. And your best friends money situation is really none of your business who cares if he went and spent 60 bucks on someone else, just bc you have a baby doesnt mean everyone has to buy you something|`|i6mydMOyaa	Some people just don't 'get it', especially guy, and you probably can't just tell them and have them smarten up. <br>  <br>  Next time he is over, try suggesting they do some colouring together, and let him see you put a special note on the back saying they did it together, with the date. Little things like that might help him realize keepsakes and little mommentos mean a lot once baby is grown up.|`|1S7uXsInaa	I would be surprised if it were a female friend, but I do not think that men think about things like that, or even know what to get a child that young.  You may find that as your child gets older that he will be more apt to buy games and things for her. . .or since she is a girl he may not really know what you get a girl.  And remember that time he spends with her is far more important than a gift or a card.|`|vZwJyqc6aa	Maybe he just has the attitude that your child is really small and won't realize what the gift is or be able to appreciate it anyway. As far as a card or letter, I wouldn't give that to my friend's baby. Babies obviously can't read and lots of parents probably wouldn't keep a letter like that until the child could read anyway. Give your friend  a little slack. Maybe he's just not into babies a whole lot.|`|ckxpknr0aa	Probably a typical guy - useless at cards and presents! I bet once he has a regular girlfriend your daughter will get loads of cute things from them....<br>  <br>  As for him buying the date a gift - well, what do you expect?! lol.....  Crude as it sounds his generosity was probably encouraged by his d**k!!|`|jsdDgIuRaa	Honestly who cares?  No one has to get your baby anything.  I don't see any point in this.<br>  <br>  I have family members who never got my son anything and I really don't see the big deal.|`|Tb5FUvJVaa	Maybe invite him over on special occasions like the baby's birthday or Christmas.|`|Ysv6cU0zaa	Either that or he resents the child secretly b/c he wished it was his and that you were with him.
YSahnI9Maa	I use ear plugs.|`|LXpjIH0Haa	I use AYR saline solution. It works for my baby.|`|nCF0BwJ1aa	I use a nasal aspirator.  My son has an abnormally small nasal passage and is almost always stuffed up, so this is a long term, relatively safe resolution.  When he is really suffering we use a saline solution in his nose (there are many different brands) that squirts up the nose and is made with a specially sized applicator for baby noses!  I also prop his crib mattress up slightly with a towel rolled up under it to help him sleep at night sometimes.  Good luck!|`|UB4J9dtMaa	Try Loratidine, or Children's Claritin.  Follow the directions explicitly, however. It's a 24 hour med.|`|ntdGOZqGaa	stuffy nose try some saline drops two in each side and booger suck them out|`|O97ZoHGXaa	i've heard from my mum she used salt water drops.<br>  this makes the baby sneeze to clear the nasal passage slightly.
7df7b4b18dad1b2e751d2688606ff576aa	Have you taken an pregnancy test? If not I would take one ASAP or just go to your doctor's. 3 weeks with no period is long time,a nd u said u never been late, so it won't hurt to take a test before u make an appointment with doctor's so u can put ur mind at ease, then wheather the test is positive or negative i will still make that appointment, good luck!
03rggPF2aa	assuming that you only missed one or two pills and took them as soon as you remembered, you should be fine. my boyfriend and i have been using only birth control pills for a year and a half now, and he never pulls out, and i haven't been pregnant, and i have missed a pill or two here and there as well. you have nothing really to worry about.|`|MbmHripJaa	you probably aren't.. and if you want a baby plan it with your man...|`|i3pn4jNcaa	no your fine.|`|sMVKFBk9aa	I took birth control pills for years.  I wasnt real good at them either, I always had atleast 3-5 extras left over at the end of the month that I had forgotten to take.  I completely stopped taking the pill and it took me a year to get pregnant after stopping.  Now... word of warning.  I had a bad sinus infection and had been on antibiotics and I got pregnant even taking the pill.  so make sure you believe the warnings if you take antibiotics
dR4QN0gHaa	It could be normal or you could be pregnant. Women are really fertile right after pregnancy or miscarriage. It has been long enough so that the pregnancy hormone may be out of your system if you aren't pregnant so I would take a test.|`|gwuTKiNXaa	It is possible since you did at least one time. but I would say it could be because of your hormones being every which away. If you don't get it next month I would tell you doctor about this|`|159e15bc29abe3e551d868753b39f233aa	you just had a m/c your body is still out of whack. chill.|`|yznZqcznaa	After a miscarriage your period is usually late, however since you have been taking birth control.... you would not ovulate anyways. Based on what you wrote no I dont think you could be pregnant, but you never know.|`|i3pn4jNcaa	your cycle probably isn't on track yet from the miscarriage and now being on birth control i don't think you need to worry. but if it still dosent come for another week i say get a test.|`|IdWleKAyaa	Your cycle could be off because of the birth contol..You should take a test to be sure|`|AA11916244	Well it could be both. To answer your question, it is possible to get pregnant that soon after, it is possible to get preggo using the pull-out, and there also is the possibility that your bodys just getting back to normal after the miscarriage. I got pregnant using pull-out over a year ago. Yea that was a big shocker!! Anyways I lost that baby at 6 weeks due to miscarriage. I didnt bleed for very long after it happened but it took about 1-2 months after for my periods to go back to normal. Also if u think you are preggo you may want to check with your doctor about a blood test because if you were to do a HPT it may come back positive because of leftover hormones. I hope that helps!|`|Q05rrSX4aa	I have heard of a lot of women falling pregnant right after a miscarriage.  It is common to get pregnant right away, but since you just started birth control, that will affect your period.  You period will come with in a day or 2 of ending your pack of active pills.  But because you just started it may be late.  I would take a pregnancy test to be sure.<br>  <br>  I am sorry to hear about the miscarriage:(|`|AEyztU2laa	Your cycle may still be unreliable after the miscarriage or you may be pregnant.  I'd go to your doctor for a blood test as you may still have enough hCG in your body from the miscarriage to give a positive urine test without being pregnant.|`|ulW2Nhunaa	Yes you could be pregnant .... when you have a miscarriage it messes with your ovulation and it can take it a couple months to get back on track  ... I would get a test or call the ob and make an appt. and have them do a pregnancy test ... hope that helped|`|sMlNvnxmaa	I had a miscarriage in Oct. 08 i was 7 weeks. One week later was pregnant again now i am 21 weeks!
vygYFdsSaa	I can't say what its caused by, but this same thing happened to me and its how I knew I was pregnant (Missed my period week). Wait til you finish out the pack and take a pregnancy test and/or see your doctor if you still don't get your period.|`|gwuTKiNXaa	not really normal if you are to start your next pack and still don't get it I would call your doctor and say something to he or she about this issue|`|EXhVHMAlaa	It is possible for your period to be different every month.<br>  If you took your pills as directed then there should be nothing to worry about.<br>  <br>  Take a pregnancy test to be sure if you are worried.|`|i3pn4jNcaa	im sure its ok. but if you continue the pack and end it withut a period i say call your doc for a check up|`|DxoodgOtaa	its just prolly a little late. i doubt anythings wrong.
sbeoF50gaa	14 years old... that's a bit young. I was 16 the first time I had sex and stayed with him til I was 18. We had a 6 month old baby by then. You tell your dad and he gets angry, trust me, that will pass. But have the baby. The baby should not have to pay for your mistake. I'd say give it up for adoption. You made a mistake and having a child is life changing. I'd be in college right now had it not been for my kid. She's 5 now. I love her to death, but I was also old enough to care for her. You are only 14 so I think the best choice for you would be adoption. The boyfriend you have now won't be your boyfriend next year. How he feels about your baby doesn't really matter. Right now you're dating. Think of it as practice for the REAL relationship. You do what's best for you and no one else. The father has a right to know what's going on. And your dad... well he's going to be angry because he loves you. He's going to care and be upset because he cares. Understand that parents get mad at their kids because they get worried and they care about you. If they didn't care then they'd have no reaction to what you were doing. Also You're probably going to continue having sex. Just be safe. No one is safe from STDS and you can't get rid of AIDS. Use condoms AND birth control. Condoms for std and of course to prevent another baby and birth control as ur back up in case a condom breaks. And always get yearly check ups at a Dr. Planned Parenthood is where I go. You are 14 and can get medicaid for an OBG. Good luck.. and I hope you don't have an abortion. This wasn't the babys mistake and that baby has a right to live.|`|gwuTKiNXaa	Everyone on here is talking very negative to you and right now isn't the time. Yes you are young but so what no one is perfect. Look you have to sit down and tell your father about this. This happen and people make mistakes everyday of their lives. I know that it hard but you should wait a movie called Juno. this is a very good movie about a teen mom and big desions of your own as hard as this is going to be. Your young and you have a long life to still life. No saying that this is going to mess up your life but it is going to be hard. My first advise is contact the boy and let him know. Tell your father and aunts let them be alerted of the situation and then tell the boy that you are currently with. I hope this helps you out and I wish you the best|`|047IPSovaa	Tell your dad - NOW.  That news will not get better for him or you with age.|`|If2ww2i9aa	Well. I think you should keep the baby. Tell your dad and see what he thinks.|`|kyTBaYFlaa	START THINKING OF NAMES?|`|xreWOKBYaa	Tell your dad, tell your new boyfriend, tell your old boyfriend, go to a doctor and then go from there.<br>  <br>  Abort, adopt or keep it. (At 14 I would reccomend one of the first two options)|`|8oAlBL91aa	Wait so you have been dating a boy since you were 11 and had a boyfriend before that around 11? Hummmm something just doesn't seem right here.|`|EXhVHMAlaa	The first step is to tell your father.<br>  He should be able to help you from there.|`|rISPXbiLaa	how could you even have sex at a very young age?!?!?|`|uF8RLL4laa	thatll teach u to use a rubber!|`|4UhSsISBaa	stop having unprotected sex first of all.<br>  tell your dad, you're going to have to ....<br>  and tell your ex boyfriend and current boyfriend<br>  common sense.|`|7TcdrFKdaa	Im sorry to hear that this happened to you.....you have only been dating him for two weeks...so you cant be that attached to him...so i say you should probably just tell him and if he dumps you...he dumps you....its better to tell him soon...because if you dont it will only get worse and worse...because then he would say why didnt you tell me sooner and stuff like that....but probably not so calm....and tell the boy in newyork ASAP because as you said he is a father....and dont blame your self for it....its his baby to...so think of yourself also...whatever you do...dont try to commit suicide like the idiot above....and its going to be really hard now...especially since you are 14...well best of luck -Deardra|`|soUND2xEaa	get rid of it if you cant support it or see if your boyfriends ok with it and <br>  <br>  the only thing i dont get is whyd you have sex at 14? im 14 to and a guy but i can control my urges.and at least use protection.......|`|i3pn4jNcaa	wow. uh i say tell your ex. see what he wants to do. then if your going to keep it tell youe current boyfriend. im sure hell still be there for you. then both of you tell your dad together.|`|w87jwOaOaa	You are a baby yourself.  Go and visit your school guidance counselor or your local Family Planning, either one can help you through this difficult time in your young life.|`|zF1MRdUFaa	Do the right thing and put the baby up for adoption after all you are just a kid yourself. There are so many families out there who want a baby and can't have one. Like my sister and her husband they make over 100,000 a year and have wanted a baby and can't have one, then kids like you can have 10 by the time they are 20 it makes me sick.|`|OEMIkJTUaa	First you need to be honest with your father. He will be the one who will help you out the most. Second, you need to tell your current b/f the truth about your ex-b/f. It will be hard, but don't twist the truth to anyone, that will only make it worse. Your father will be disappointed but he still will love you no matter what, so just tell him.|`|1NF6f4y7aa	you should have used protection #1.  i'd do the right thing and tell your dad or somebody in your family like a grandmother or something.  i'm sorry this happened to you but you are very young to be having a child at this age.  I hope you make the right decision, no matter how hard it is for you, there are people who love you so don't be afraid.|`|hD4D2ce3aa	well im 14 and pregnant too. idk if my babys dad is the guy who raped me or my boyfriend... so im kind of in a bad situation. my boyfriend doesnt kno i was raped and he thinks the baby is his. <br>  <br>  tell your parents and just take care of yourself and dont worry about your boyfriend it will stress u out too much.<br>  please keep your baby. <br>  good luck and god bless that baby.|`|yuGW9AlCaa	I guess it's a little late to ask now.. but why weren't you using protection.. <br>  <br>  You just got to tell your dad.. that's all you can do.. .and break it off with the new guy.. he's just a little boy, he doesn't need this drama... also, you need to call the father and let him know ASAP.|`|sAbah6dTaa	tell your parents, but i'm sorry if you don't want to be in this situation, keep your pants on OR use the proper techiques to keep it from happening.|`|5jjGo6XTaa	first things first tell your parents you and your family firgure somthing out because 99% chance your boyfriend will not be there and you ex wont eithger being a parent is hard  work so be ready step up to the plate and dont be another kid having a baby and not taking care of him or her. figure out what you are gonna do first them bring your ex and curent boyfriend into it but remember this is not your current boyfriends problem its yours and even though its also the fathers child he ownt have the same conection with the baby as you will and hes young he might not truly know what its gonna take and he might not be ready so you figure out what to do keep it or not and how you will take cae of it your self. dont count on daddy the govermant or child support babies truly shouldnt be having babies. you have no idea what you in for the cost the theething the school they do grow up the dont stay young and cute all the clothing you wil  by drs apptment teaching then to walk making sure they chew their foods what to do when they r sick how to get fluids out of a new borns throught when it starts choking theres a lot more to it .and say good bye to your friends cause its hard to hang out with them and gooff to do whatever when ever with a baby on you hip.|`|Zmay11uvaa	I feel very bad for you and don't know what I would do in your situation. Just sit down and calmly tell your Dad and explain it was all just a mistake. Tell him your as upset as him. Try to work it out. The best of luck, <3 taylor|`|DxoodgOtaa	well, do you have your ex bf's number? you should call him and tell him. i know its sad that you'll be parents so young, but unfortunately you cant help it.<br>  <br>  you should tell your current bf and your dad. dont do it at the same time though. but whatever you do, please dont get an abortion. its a living human being, and if you get one, you'll regret it. try tyelling your schools guidance counselor or someone you trust. or you could call a hotline for pregnant teens.<br>  <br>  best of luck, and i hope that everything turns out ok. (:<br>  <br>  **also, people stop being so mean. she made a bad choice, and now im sure she regrets all of it. but just be respectful, you dont have to like it. none of you are perfect either. so stop acting like it.|`|FyQYdILeaa	First off, don't listen to these pricks on these answers.<br>  why bother even answerings its not fair to be saying such harsh and rude things.<br>  <br>  Look mistakes happen, thats the way it goes.<br>  <br>  Lets get this straight, your pregnant.<br>  Okay your a month in? <br>  Your best advice is to look around school or find the local clinic.<br>  Its bloody hard.<br>  But approach them and say hi i'm wondering if you can help me, i'm looking to talk to someone over pregnancy and abortion. <br>  <br>  They won't bite your head off, neither will you need to tell your father because at a young age you can have an abortion without parental knowledge. ITS YOUR BODY.<br>  <br>  Its not worth the time and hassle of keeping the baby.<br>  Its a sad fact, but it best be done.<br>  Don't worry yourself too much, thats not going to help. <br>  Seriously i've seen so much worse!<br>  Your less than 2 months pregnant surely?<br>  Well then, it should be okay!<br>  The clinic will help, i wouldn't advise telling the boyfriend it would be a tough time for him and unless you don't mind bring curtains on the relationship then steer clear.<br>  <br>  Get a best friend and go down to the clinic.<br>  They will help you, i promise. <br>  If you go ahead and want to tell your parent then let your dad get angry. But at the end of the days whats done is done. Whats going to change? Hes going to shout alot, but so what? He will help you in the end.<br>  <br>  You either do it alone with a friend and risk nothing.<br>  Or tell your father and risk very little.<br>  <br>  The pregnancy stages sound early on to me, so i'm guessing it will be a pill or two. No serious operation needed.<br>  <br>  YOUR GOOD TO GO GIRL.<br>  Stop worrying:) <br>  It'll be okay!|`|5SCKHiPAaa	Hey, I know this is a scary time for you. Do you possibly have a counselor at school that you could talk to? Hopefully this person can help you figure out when your next step is. Make sure you eat healthy and take care of yourself.|`|MOHgYm8raa	First, you're going to have to tell your ex that you're expecting his baby. He said he'd be there for you, now you have to see if he was telling the truth. He has a right to know, if you decide to keep the baby. <br>  Then you have to tell your father. He should know, whatever you decide. If you keep the baby, he'll have to help look after it, and if you abort you're going to need a lot of support. He will be angry at first, but we all make mistakes. <br>  Tell your current boyfriend. Sadly, it will probably mean the end of your relationship, but that's what happens when these things occur. <br>  Good luck!|`|be5076c0b98b495ffe00aade08f96b65aa	Your 14 sweetie! You shouldn't be having sex with 1 boy, let alone 2. But I'm sure you know that by now. Well first you need to tell someone you trust, whether it be a friends mother, teacher, or your dad. I'm very sorry about your mother by the way...Then if you choose not to tell your father first, then maybe whoever you do tell can be there with you when you do tell him. You do have to tell him, because there is no hiding something like this.<br>  <br>  Then you need to make a doctors appointment to make sure the pregnancy is even viable(meaning it's implanted strongly, and producing enough hormones to sustain it). Then you need to get started on prenatal vitamins. Then you and your dad need to contact this boyfriend in New York, along with his parents, and figure out what you and him want to do. Personally, I think that you should consider adoption, but then again, if you think you and your dad can take care of this baby, then by all means do it.<br>  <br>  Finally, you shouldn't be worrying about this new guy. If he loves you, then he will understand, although he may not accept it at first. He'll be upset, which is understandable. Let him be, and don't push. Also keep in mind, that he is young too, and if he chooses not to be with you as a result, that is his choice, and you should understand. If it's not his baby, then he shouldn't be expected to raise it or be with a girl who has a baby at such a young age. Also, I am sure his parents would strongly disapprove of him seeing you, as the baby isn't his.<br>  <br>  Hope this helps, and please, please, please, learn a lesson from this. Unprotected sex=possible baby, and in your case a baby. You are so young, and this isn't going to be easy, but I'm sure you'll be okay in time. Good luck hun!|`|nEgI4u4faa	I am so sorry!! First of all you are way to young to be having sex! Second of all it has happened and now you have to deal with it and be responsible.  If i was in your situation i would try to find someone to talk to like maybe an aunt, or an older close friend or even a teacher or something at school. Someone who can maybe take you to a clinic or something to get you checked out to make sure you are ok. Then you can worry about telling your dad and maybe you could have someone there with you when you tell him. Now about telling your boyfriend you pregnant with another boy's baby, he will either be there for you ad help you or either he will be a jerk. He will have to understand. You need to make sure you tell the father tho. It is very important for him to know. <br>  Good luck with it all,<br>  *Court*|`|prq0Y1Jaaa	Why are you people so judgemental? She has come here for a bit of advice and moral support and has been attacked! So she is young but there is no reason to believe she will be a bad mother! Woman in their 20's 30's and 40's that screw up and are terrible mothers! And for the one that said it's sick that she can have babies and others can't, how spitfil are you! It's hardly her fault that some people are infertile! At the end of the day it's YOUR choice what YOU do. You will need to tell someone and let the father know. Good luck and keep your chin up you are not the only one who has been in this situation|`|4RxE1Ad6aa	first tell your dad, and then find out who's baby it is, and then tell that guy that hes a father|`|vjgc9qpwaa	Wow why the hell are you having sex at 14. Way to screw up the rest of your life. Your to young to be supporting a baby.|`|IHmf7F63aa	u shouldnt even be having sex at ur age but fist u should tell your ex boy friend that your pregnant with his baby he has a right to no and you should tell your current boyfriend ur pregnant too and that its not his baby friend then you should tell your dad cuz he really has a right to no and he could help u out alot in your situation <br>  also if u are not capable of taking care of your baby you should consider adoption<br>  YOU HAVE TO THINK OF YOUR CHILD TOO!<br>  <br>  *hope everything goes all right with problem*<br>  WISH YOU LUCK|`|xS0erGmEaa	DONT COMMITT SUCICIDE OR ABORT. even though people think its nawt a baby if its in your belly it is just a little reminder.|`|5tcm5xhbaa	My sister was in the same situation as you. My mum died and my sis, she was pregnant. My dad decided there was no chance she could be a mum. I'm totally against abortion but my dad wasn't. I was 16 then. <br>  You should have protection on. To be honest you shouldn't have sex and your age anyway. Tell your dad he is the best person.|`|1c68aa37678bc208432a61d5735bbbf1aa	OMG!!! I dont really know what to tell you.... i will flip if my daughter will be having sex with a guy at 14 years old and at 2 weeks of dating him you might want to talk to your dad and let him know.... he will be the only one that will be able to help you since you are a minor and nobody else.... he will be the one making a good choice for you, he will know what to do... good luck though|`|3a8c03abddba3f41c749843651814e92aa	You need to tell someone that you trust about this, preferably an adult. You need someone to support you and be on your side for all of this. Your main concern right now is you and the baby and keeping the both of you healthy. You need to tell your dad also and decide what you want to do. Good luck.|`|yA3KNKF9aa	Loosing your mother could be a big contributor to your actions.  Yes they were not the smartest ones, but you obviously need to feel loved.  I would tell your dad.  Yes he may freak, but hes your dad so he'll most likely be there for you.  Also see a doctor and tell your ex.  He should know.  Your family will help you through it so don't worry.  Just stay calm and good luck!|`|gnMogncpaa	Well, you're in some predicament! 1st of all, you need to stop having unprotected sex!!!!! You're 14, and are putting yoursel and your partners in danger of contracting an STD. Secondly, you need to let the other kid know you're pregnant and then you need to talk to your father or a school counselor.  Good luck and STOP SLEEPING AROUND!|`|jCB7S6sfaa	its not that bad.i was 15 when i had my son.my dad wanted to kill me but he got over it.you should really try contacting the dad and the boyfriend of 2 weeks he should understand.You can always get help from the state too.WIC and food stamps and medical assistance.Give it try its worth it. <br>  -Best luck|`|CohGLroBaa	well hun u should tell your boyfriend and your ex because if you dont your gonna make things worse.|`|4oDMSe6baa	Don't let the hateful//hurt full//dumb answers discourage you.

But it reminds me of The Secret Life of an american teenager you should watch it its a good TV show and i would say just tell your dad he is gunna have to find out sooner or later because you wont fit in your clothes and u will get a stomach so just better to get it over with now.|`|2914093d823c63f871f0d2f45ca1b544aa	What is wrong with you?  Where is your father and do you even go to school?  You obviously are not afraid of HIV, AIDS or STDs.  There is no cure for HIV/AIDS and some STDs either.  Depending on how far you are along in your pregnancy you should go the Planned Parenthood or some other Abortion clinic in your area and abort this pregnancy.  You do not have to tell your parents but you need to speak with a counselor and get yourself some help.  You seem to be confused and are looking for attention in all the wrong places.|`|55H2DM0Baa	ok grl. You need to actually tell your parents first.Get some Pink pills and tell your boyfriend. Right now your in a tough pickle i personally dont have experience in this matter, but i watched my sis go through it and it wasn't pleasent.Pink pills will do wonders for your nails and will help the baby as well. Its going to be alright.|`|AA10176536	dont listen to those freaks that call u bad names. they r stupid. people make mistakes. i however think that u are way to young to be going through child labor... it could kill you. so my best option for u is abortion. now, i know how many people hate me for saying this, but it's true. tell ur dad... if u have to... dont get murdered or anything. good luck :)|`|ni4YME93aa	If you don't feel you are capable of raising a child, perhaps you should consider adoption?  That would be a noble thing that could help a couple in need.  But either way, talk to your father or a school councelor.  They will help you.|`|GZ0bEbPuaa	I had a baby at fifteen almost sixteen and I regret not telling my parents right away. The sooner you tell your dad the better. It will be hard, trust me, I know. But in the long run giving him time to prepare and get over it is best. You also need to tell your current boyfriend the truth. I know this is all going to be tough. Then you also need to tell the boy from NY that you are pregnant. If you still want to be with your current boyfriend that will probably be up to him if he wants to stay with you, but relationships at your age don't last to long so don't worry. You also need to make a decision about the baby. Email me if you need to talk. I can be your friend through this tough time!|`|YvzcVxuFaa	You have to make the hard choice weather you want to keep the baby or give it up for adoption, my best friend had a baby when she was 13 she found it really hard but she's glad she kept it. i think you should really call the father he has a right to know and waiting longer will make it harder to tell him. also if i was you i would tell my current boyfriend too that way he knows. and make a doctors appointment to make sure your healthy enought and to make sure your getting the nutrition you and your baby need.<br>  <br>  I have the deepest sympehty for you living with just your dad, my mom moved away when i was 7 and ive lived with my dad since and im always scared to tell him stuff because he is so protective about stuff like that, but you should tell him, he'll probably flip but he's your dad he will still love and take care of you<br>  <br>  I'm sorry and i really hope it all works out for you....Good Luck|`|2n0B4cY6aa	well you need to talk to your dad and doctor and work out what is best to do all round.<br>  In future, use condoms,contraceptive pill etc or dont have sex as so young.|`|ckgiPMm4aa	In a way, I understand you. I had my daughter, when I was only 15.<br>  <br>  I suggest that you call the baby's father first, and tell him, then honestly, I think you should break up with your now boyfriend, because if you don't he's probably ganna end up breaking up with you, and even if he doesn't, one young boy already has a huge responsibility, don't put that on him to.<br>  <br>  Then you should sit your father down and talk to him, I'm not going to lie, this might be the hardest part. Just remember, that it's your choice on what you do from here, adoption, keeping the baby... i would say abortion, but im pro-life, after my parents tried to get me to abort what turned out to be the best thing that ever happened to me.<br>  <br>  Good luck.|`|gBH2n7Gyaa	well if i was in your shoes i would get an abortion cause thats way to young you have you whole life ahead of you.. yeah your dad will probably flip out and your boyfriend well just tell him if you two just started dating then when you tell him and he leaves oh well you can find some one else... man i feel bad for you.. my daughter is 14 right now and if she was pregnant i would take her to get an abortion fast... may god bless you and if you do deceide to keep the baby i wish you well and happinest... GOOD LUCK young mother..|`|UhY60Kcraa	im sorry about your mom :(. but seriosuly your 14 and your sleeping around!? im sorry about the situation your in , but its kind of your own fault, why didnt you use protection! id say go online to a help website or call a help number.|`|hxS4GPKeaa	Gosh! No need for the rudeness and insults. Even though teens shouldn't be having sex (unprotected at that) it happens everyday..some teens that you know are probably doing the same thing...so chill!!! its not going to help to put her down and make her feel bad<br>  <br>  **Girl i know your having all kinds of mixed emotions right now...but dont be scared, everything will be okay..your just going to have to grow up have to take care of your new responsibility.. first you need to decide if you want to keep your baby or not and you also need to be truthful to both boys... and especially your dad...believe me...the sooner the better. & dont feel bad and put yourself down because many others are guilty as doing the same thing as you, unfortunately you just got a little caught up in yours..try not to stress and Congratulations!! <br>  Just make sure you use protection from now on and if your going to have sex at least stay with the same person to avoid  std's and other unnecessary stress... <br>  * No matter what you decide, good luck!|`|nAwqrAqDaa	First of all, girl, you are FOURTEEN! You are still a child, regardless of being a teen and having a woman's body! You have to take responsibility, and this shows that you cannot even be responsible for  your own body. You are so young! This is very sad, I must say! If you cannot handle your body, how do you possibly think you are able to take care of a baby? And having sex so young is ridiculous! You need to be scolded, this is not being mean at all. Wait until your father finds out.<br>  <br>  You need to tell your father as soon as possible. Despite you being the carrier of the baby, you must have him decide on what to do with it. You have to accept that you are not responsible for this anymore, other than to healthfully carry this child into the world. I am sorry to say that this child will be your consequence. Your father should decide whether to abort or list it for adoption or to keep it. Do not try to make any other decisions about it by yourself, you do not sound to me like you are capable of making thought out choices on your own.<br>  <br>  I am sorry to be so harsh, but I am 16 and think you should do this for the better. You are young, and I am, too. And this just sounds ridiculous to me! You will soon see consequences, ones that will change your life!|`|phGow6Qvaa	is this real? well you can see you're doctor first if you want but yeah same rubbish: tell your dad|`|yT3Jyo3Laa	Well 1st off all you're going to have to tell your dad. I know you are scared that he's going to be furious but you need to tell him. I know that he will help you. Yeah he'll be fricken pissed but he will help you through it. I know because the same thing happened to me. I found out I was pregnant a couple years ago and I was scared shitless and did NOT want to tell my dad cause I knew he would be pissed. but i did tell him and yeah he was pissed he was so fricken pissed but he helped me throug it and we are closer than ever. he's going to find out sooner or later hun it's easier to just tell him now and get it over with. I will pray for you.|`|jeqxygkFaa	omfg. thats disgusting.

fMilDRgLaa	The best thing to do is let your wife feed on demand and have skin to skin contact with yhe baby.  The more your baby demands it, the more your wife should produce it.  Giving a baby Goodstart could hurt your wife's milk supply.  I would see a lactation consultant or a pediatrician and express your concerns.  Is your baby having 6-8 wet diapers? Any bowel movements through the day?  All this should be taken into consideration.|`|O97ZoHGXaa	no, i used to supplement breast milk with a little formula until i started producing enough my self.<br>  just make sure that your still stimulating the milk supply.|`|9qf2HSGYaa	No, I use to mix it, or give breast milk one time and goodstart the next.|`|9scpRClxaa	Every time you feed the Goodstart to your baby, you are telling your wife's body to not produce milk.  I've seen many a breastfeeding relationship prematurely end because of this type of panic.  Has she seen a lactation consultant or call the local la leche league chapter--www.llli.org and go to their locate a chapter link--and have someone come talk to your wife to make sure that the latch is good.  Also, eating from a bottle is easier than breastfeeding so babies often end up preferring that.  <br>  <br>  Your wife needs to just lay down in bed with the baby and do nothing but breastfeed.  You take care of the house and everything else for now.  Breastmilk is digested very fast and a newborn's stomach is the size of a small walnut.  <br>  <br>  Do not limit the amount of time the baby spends on the breast because you want her to get the good hind milk (that is the fatty, high-calorie satisfying portion).  It may take longer than 15 minutes to get to it depending on when your wife's letdown is.  <br>  <br>  If baby just wants to suckle, do not offer a pacifier, but breastfeed.<br>  <br>  “Just One Bottle Won’t<br>  Hurt” -- or Will It?<br>  Supplementation of the Breastfed Baby<br>  <a href="http://www.health-e-learning.com/article..." rel="nofollow">http://www.health-e-learning.com/article...</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.breastfeeding.org/bfacts/bott..." rel="nofollow">http://www.breastfeeding.org/bfacts/bott...</a><br>  Did you know....<br>  That just one bottle can have serious consequences for both the mother and baby? Unfortunately, it is very easy to give a breastfed baby "just one bottle" and the reasons for giving a bottle often show concern and compassion; e.g.,<br>  <br>  1. Letting the mother have a well deserved rest after a long delivery.<br>  2. Settling a hungry baby who is difficult to feed.<br>  3. Give the mother's sore nipples a rest.<br>  <br>  But studies show that "just one bottle" can be harmful to both the mother and baby by<br>  <br>  1. Increasing the likelihood of serious allergy to cows' milk protein.<br>  2. Increasing the chance of bowel infection and diarrhea by changing the pH of the bowel. It may take up to a month to return to normal, safer levels.<br>  3. Causing nipple confusion--having difficulty latching to the breast.<br>  4. Affecting the delicate supply and demand balance.<br>  5. Increasing engorgement by not emptying the breasts.<br>  6. Decreasing the mother's confidence in her ability to feed her baby.<br>  7. Reducing the duration of breastfeeding.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.breastfeed.com/articles/issue..." rel="nofollow">http://www.breastfeed.com/articles/issue...</a><br>  Breastfed babies who are fed formula in the first week of life have a delay in the development of a healthy gut flora. Their gut flora is more like formula-fed infants. This description appears in Lactation: Physiology, Nutrition, and Breast-Feeding by Margaret C. Neville and Marianne R. Neifert: "The effect of breastfeeding on the infants' gut flora was abolished by cow's milk supplementation. However, in the same study, infants fed on breast milk with supplementation of humanized cow's milk established a low stool pH and a dominant flora of bifidobacteria (the good stuff) with a two- to six-week delay. At present, it is not known to what extent supplementation can be practiced without destroying the characteristic intestinal flora of the breast-fed baby."<br>  <br>  Colostrum helps to build a mucosal barrier, which protects babies against infection and is anti-inflammatory. Breastmilk is living protection against all kinds of germs. Mother Nature sure knew what she was doing.<br>  <br>  It takes many weeks for the baby's gut to close up the leaks in order to seal off germs and to develop the ability to shut out allergenic proteins. If given formula in the early weeks, this closing up is delayed and the risk of allergies and illness increases. The type of bacteria in the gut becomes less protective. In other words, Baby is more at risk for illness.<br>  <br>  Just one bottle of formula - given for any reason - can sensitize babies who may be allergic to cow's milk protein or soy protein. This is especially important to know if you have allergies in your family. Some studies have indicated that giving cow's milk formulas early may also increase the risk of some children for developing insulin dependent diabetes.
yUyx2nhmaa	i'm not sure that much is normal, though baby is pressing on your bladder so could be. i'd check with the doc as it could be a UTI|`|e0Om6Onqaa	I've always heard your bathroom trip increase as you get further along since the baby is pushed against your bladder. This doesn't sound out of the ordinary to me.|`|jf4UOCElaa	its normal especially when your drinking a lot of fluids your baby is sitting low thats all and right on your bladder very normal it may get better maybe not i didnt have no symptoms  till like right the time of my due date|`|fnPyq2iqaa	.
Ysv6cU0zaa	Have you been holding the gas in? Let it out, b/c when you hold it in it gets worse. I remember I had terrible gas while<br>  pregnant and it was so embarrassing. Maybe you could check with your doctor to see if there is something you could take to help the gas subside or try not to eat foods that produce gas for you. Good Luck!|`|96HWpdkFaa	I have gas pain alot also..not bad where i want to cry though! lol<br>  <br>  If your worried you can call the doctor you know your body best..but It's most likely normal.|`|JRXpYW3Naa	Its very normal. Take some Gas-X, up to 200 mg of Simanthicone is okay a day. You should buy a pregnancy book and read it so you have some basic knowledge of what to expect. <br>  <br>  I suggest Great Expectation: Your All In One Guide To Pregnancy and Childbirth|`|whYlVR2saa	i am 7 weeks and 4 days pregnant, and i am definitiely going through the exact same thing. i am going to talk to my doctor asap because it is very uncomfortable, but i have heard that it's o.k. to use gas x. hope you get some relief!|`|ihL0FkJYaa	i  have gas pain alot also..not bad where i want to cry though! lol
b0ff0526fe90638f8e2ac0fea7c1171caa	not at all. I was on BC for 7 years and would miss a day or two here and there and never got pregnant. it takes a coupld weeks for the hormone in the birth control to get out of your system anyways. I am 99.999999% sure u didnt get pregnant.|`|jf4UOCElaa	um depends u may want to get to morning after pill just in case or if you are you will find out pretty soon youll start to cramp while still taking the pill|`|RR7UX4jkaa	the medicine from the pill is still built up in your sytem.|`|DxoodgOtaa	if you used a condom, prolly not. if you didnt, well maybe.|`|Tewbfnu3aa	some of my friends got pregnant while on the pill, i don't know if they forgot to take the pill or not. the only way you will know if your pregnant or not is by waiting to see if you miss your period.|`|dNlCfhD2aa	Most likely you are  not pregnant.  It sounds like you did exactly what you should when a pill is missed.  Don't stress about it, you should be fine.|`|HrgLhqmvaa	all i know is that you have to take the pill on that day, and if you take it any other day to make up for when you missed it, it wont count.|`|7vKeZYcYaa	Chances are low but it's still possible. Birth control is still only 99.9% effective. God still has that other .1% :)|`|3a8c03abddba3f41c749843651814e92aa	I got pregnant on the pill taking it religiously... so anything could happen whether you take the pill or not!|`|eeaXYyCNaa	You probably aren't pregnant.  If you only missed one pill.  But, you will know when your period is due.|`|kaqPSgTVaa	Only way to know is to wait two weeks and take a test.
65f9bf63277a3aad10cb477ed6f41708aa	I will never understand any of this stuff neither! My LMP was November 28 2008 and so far my EDD is September 14 on the ultrasound? Seems off to me but I jut dont get it!|`|kaqPSgTVaa	You'll never know the actual conception date because every woman ovulates at different times and it's hard to say when the sperm and egg actually met. It's usually about 2 weeks from the start date of your last period.|`|OM1zJPFtaa	I'd say you conceived in early December. I was due September 10, and I know I got pregnant around December 10. If you are having a natural birth, then they generally don't let you go more than two weeks past the due date, depending on your health. If you are scheduling a c-section, they will do it a few days before your due date. But again, it will be based on your health and the health of the baby.|`|a1x0xqARaa	I think I gave birth 3 days after the due date.  The doctors don't usually like you to go very far past your date since the baby is still growing inside you.  The longer they're in there, the bigger they get, obviously.  I was going to be induced if I was a week late.  Luckily, I didn't have to be.  :-)<br>  As for the calculations, that confused me as well.  Still does sometimes, after rethinking it and so on.  Check out www.babycenter.com they have some informative articles you can learn more about how calculations are calculated!  Good luck!|`|LTCB69fZaa	ok my last menstraul period was Nov 22,08  my estimated due date is Aug 29 i would say somewhere around the 8-14 of december but i'm just guessing because thats around the time i conceived and we're close in dates|`|RR7UX4jkaa	Go by when you actually had your last period. That's how the doctors do it as well. Our baby is due on Sept. 1st!!|`|kgE96Nhcaa	Well, my LMP was Nov 30 my EDD is anywhere between 9/1/09 and 9/17/09.  We conceived on either Dec 14 or Dec 26 (busy month haha, not much time for you know what!) we had been trying for over a year so all my dates are in a calendar.  Ultrasounds and blood work have been confusing so the MD is hoping on March 3rd when I get my ultrascreen for genetic disorders to give me a more firm due date.  Can't wait to see, this is all such guess work anyways but hoping with that ultrasound they will be able to give me a more firm date, still knowing that the baby will come when it wants to of course but I wouldn't mind knowing for work etc!  Good Luck!|`|5UcdeeX8aa	It differs by length of cycle. If you have an average 28 day cycle them you conceived Dec 5th?
0BC2WTyoaa	I got this one... it's 2.5 MHz and when I got it I was 15 weeks along.  I could hear the baby.  I have only used it 3 times.  I use it only about one time per week since they haven't decided if they are harmful or not and when we listen it's only for a few seconds at a time.|`|FGjanFY1aa	I LOVE MY DOPPLER! I listen to my babygirl every morning & night just to make sure she's ok. I got it when I turned 14wks & am now 19wks4dys. When I first got it, I would listen to her every few days. Now I listen to her twice a day (since I keep hearing horror stories of the umbilical cord wrapping around a fetus' neck).<br>  <br>  I hope you enjoy it as much as I do! It's GREAT for reassurance. You shd definitely be able to hear the little on'e heartbeat!|`|JRXpYW3Naa	The FDA says don't use them. I'll post the link as to why. If you really want to risk it...it was something I was not doing. Unlike most women, I researched them first. <br>  <br>  "Doppler Ultrasound Heartbeat Monitors: Similar concerns surround the OTC sale of Doppler ultrasound heartbeat monitors. These devices, which people use to listen to the heartbeat of a fetus, are currently marketed legally as "prescription devices" that should only be used by or under the supervision of a health care professional.<br>  <br>  "When the product is purchased over the counter and used without prior consultation with a health care professional, there is no oversight of how the device is used and little or no medical benefit derived from the exposure," Phillips says. "The number of sessions or the length of a session to which a fetus is exposed is uncontrolled, thus raising the potential for harm to the fetus." "|`|QCUPeW8aaa	No I hate to be the bearer of bad news but I bought a home doppler and have not had it work yet!<br>  Im already 30 weeks and haven't been able to find babys heartbeat on the doppler yet.<br>  Good luck to you!!! =D
xue72D76aa	It is always possible that you are pregnant.  Let's look at the timing If you have a typical 28 day cycle. Having started on the 8th, you would have ovulated around the 22nd.  If the timing was off by a few days (say you ovulated a few days earlier), the sperm from having sex on the 15th could have lived long enough to fertilize the egg.  This is all assuming you have a typical 28 day cycle - some women cycle longer or shorter than others.   Wait until you are a day or two into your missed period and take a home pregnancy test.  They are 99.9% accurate after you miss your period.  Good luck!|`|kj507W26aa	Wait until your next period is due and give it 7 days after the day your suppose to start and go take a blood test at the clinic.<br>  <br>  Epileptics cannot use any form of birth control because the meds they take kill the effects of bc.  Thats weird that the doctor didnt mention any of this to you since you are on the NuvaRing.|`|ns1F0p8Laa	it doesn't really sound like you're pregnant go to a doctor and get checked.|`|BZiZr4Hcaa	It's still too early to tell if you would be pregnant or not, to do a home test you have to wait at least until 5 days before you're supposed to get your period. If you do blood work at your doctors you can do that much sooner, even next week.|`|eytlIKITaa	There is no way you could feel any pregnancy symptoms now, it's way too early!  Implantation doesn't even happen for 7-10 days after fertilization.|`|AA10771601	I got pregnant on Nuva Ring!<br>  You can use an early detection test a week before your period is due to start.|`|FClC80XPaa	Its way too early to tell. I think you are probably just a little freaked out. If you still feel this way in a week or so, then I would suggest maybe going to see your physician. I doubt you are pregnant though.  I am also on topamax and birth control, and have been for quite some time, and have had no oopsies yet. :)|`|I9vZkww8aa	Well yes you can be pregnant. The Nuvaring is only 96% accurate to begin with. So that means even without the Topamax, you have a 4/100 chance of being pregnant. Thats pretty darn high. <br>  <br>  People feel different symptoms than others, I felt mine almost right away.|`|VEkkn2Otaa	Probably not, thats only 7 days after your period you shouldnt of ovulated yet, but who knows best thing to do is wait until you can take a pregnanct test. you can take a first response 5 days before your suppose to start your next period!|`|8hgrkiK5aa	take home test first. you can get them fro a dollar at dollar generals and family dollars and other stores. you have to get them from the counter.|`|b90e42d25bd45025e46d388ab0c06d12aa	Take a test then get on the shot it works with Topamax; I was on Topamax for about 2 years and the shot was the only birth control that wasn't effected by it.  Good luck|`|xCfHnQBbaa	Wait let me get my crystal ball out!  HELLO!  go to the doctor or take a pregnancy test.  how would anyone here know that for sure.|`|NADlb5Ffaa	If you have a 28 day cyle, your fertile days are usually around day 12-14.. which would be the next few days. I think you are probably ok and not pregnant. Good luck!!|`|pcpi2g4Iaa	its to early to tell if your pregnant. you have to wait about a month
0mSpQjzCaa	Pray about it the lord will not put more on you than you can handle.  Get up be a mother to the beautiful daughter, and enjoy her until the new little one arrives.  Don't turn to meds while you are preg.  can't be good for the baby.  Be strong and stop wasting time feeling sorry for yourself,  its not the end of the world.  just pray for another health baby and cherrish every moment you have.|`|EOW8DOoNaa	oh hun you just had a baby i mean my son is also only 4 months old so we basically just had them like 80 something days ago and thats not loong there just babys they dont even have teeth yet nor are they crawling cant even say mama or nothing yet a baby now is Definitly going to be hard but your doing the right thing by not having abortion and plus your married so thats also a + you have somebody right there to help you next time just trust the condoms never trust those things that go into your body and plus sometimes they can do worse in the long run but anyways hun goodluck|`|aYCjy8Neaa	Wouldn't they be 13 months apart? Me and my sister are 13 months apart. My mom always says that it was hard, but after we got older it was such a blessing having us close in age. We played together and had the same friends. So just hand in there it will be ok. God only gives us what we can handle!|`|kMe0kNgVaa	I think that your just really worried and stressed out, things will get better dont worry about it:)<br>  congrads n goodluck|`|KLUPLlzsaa	Okay I don't have the same situation but I am apart of a board that may help you. I could ask my friend on the board or if you want to you can join. Fertilityfriend.com. One of the ladies has a 1 year old and a new born that was just born a week ago. Congrads again! first of all congrads on a beautiful 4 month old and now a little one on the way. Sometimes it will happen...I have a 3 week old at home and I am not sure what contraceptive I want to try. I am afraid of the pill because number 1...i don't t hink it works well with me and 2 i think i don't have enough discipline to remember to take it everyday. I don't want 2 babies in the same year but you know what, If you believe in God...I believe that he won't dish out what you can't handle. Not like I am belittling you, trust me...I know and understand. <br>  <br>  Only thing to do now is to move forward. It will be hard at first but it will get better. I am sorry I couldn't give you more information. Good luck to you. If you need someone to talk to, add me.|`|ck5edW9kaa	I have two boys that are 13 months apart, and honestly it is great. I know how you feel because I felt the same way and here I am with the two of them and it is wonderful. My oldest son loves his little brother want to help and my second son is calmer because his older brother is so intense, but dont be scared. I love every second of having the two of them. Its also nice because they entertain eachother and I get a little more me time. So congrats and please dont be scared. By the way, my labor and delivery was much shorter.|`|byXx3o1oaa	My brother and I were born 11 months apart. Our parents were barely out of high school and had a new baby when they found out they were pregnant with me. It made things difficult and my brother was jelous when i first came home but he got better about it and it became easier for my parents and proved to be beneficial as we got older as well...It may seem stressful now but you'll get through it. Good luck and Congrats on the little one.|`|E0SJx3Csaa	I had the same thing happen to me, only i was only 18 years old ! I was sooo scared and all the other feelings you mentioned, i even thought about abortion but my husband wouldn't allow it ! He said it would all be okay, and it was ;)<br>  <br>  my almost one year old daughter was jealous for the first week, i spent some alone time with her at the park and i swear that cured her !|`|KWaTVVpGaa	This may not be what you want to hear, but you are so lucky! I have three kids, 16, 10, and 20 months. I really wish I could have two close together! <br>  <br>  Good luck!
bVaZ72f3aa	the day i lost my virginity i got pregnant.|`|rx0ekB9Paa	me and my hubby tried for 4 months and nothing happened,then he got deployed and i started taking fertile xx by native remedies and when he came home on r&r i got pregnant the first time we had sex.<br>  <br>  <br>  just because you are having unprotected sex doesnt mean you will come up pregnant,it definetly helps,but you have to hit on your fertile days. talk to your doctor about it. he can do some tests to make sure everything is ok with both of you|`|OKarH9Zsaa	We tried for two years before conceiving. Everyone is different, if you are concerned see a doctor, after a year we seen our doctor to make sure nothing was wrong with one of us.|`|mTyu7CKoaa	My husband and I tried for our son for about a year and a half, and I finally got sick of buying the tests every month and said that we should just stop trying ... We didnt start using condoms, but we just went with the flow, and a month later I was pregnant... And this time we tried for 6 months and decided maybe it wasnt meant to happen yet, and again a month later I was pregnant (now currently 29 weeks).... my advise is to forget that ur trying and just have fun with ur husband... It seems to work out for alot of people|`|zATQaiwIaa	in all honesty that is a long period of time to try with no protection and not get pregnant, it could be age, his sperm, your fertility.....<br>  <br>  With our first it took 4 weeks, our second took about 8 weeks.....we are 25|`|AA12314337	It took us 7 months. <br>  <br>  If you have been having sex on a regular basis, I might be a bit concerned. Have you taken any ovulation tests to determine if you are in fact ovulating each month? I would start there. I would also speak with an OB/GYN. <br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|PpYBnxgpaa	with my son it took one night . with my twins im currently pregnant with it took us 3 months|`|gGchCKC4aa	Have you tried charting your ovulation or using an OPK to help narrow down the BEST week to make a baby?  <br>  My husband and I did this as practice for a few months, and then the first month we "tried" for real, I got pregnant.  The second time took two months.  <br>  I would really look at your ovulation, before you get too concerned.  If you try that and it still doesn't work, you may want to consult your doctor.|`|MMj7YcXkaa	hah!  i was with my husband 4 yrs, and no baby.  I never used  any protection.  then when i wanted a baby we tried almost every night for 3 months and finally got pregnant.  If still having problems, you can do what my girlfriend did.  She just told her dr and she was prescribed glucophage  (might not be spelled right)  after a few weeks on that, she was pregnant.|`|f9d25be9a86bcb470e6b157992207144aa	No, you shouldnt be nervous. Normally doctors will test is you've been trying for longer than a year w/o a positive. Have either of you been tested? I think the minute you stop TRYING for a baby, and just have fun, it will happen. My DH and I were not TRYING, but not not trying either and we conceived on the first try. Good Luck!|`|MQ83HGD5aa	I've heard that if it takes longer than a year you both need to get checked out. If you already have, you may need to start narrowing down your fertile days and tracking them so you'll know when the best time to have sex is. Good luck!|`|ZVCm3XAEaa	It took us 12 months from when i came of the pill until i conceived.  Maybe you should go talk to your Doctor just to put your mind at rest. All the best|`|WLtsumGBaa	after the pill it took me 7 months
672Wl59Paa	Yes it is possible to get pregnant and have your period, it just depends on the time of conceiving.  You should probably take a pregnancy test just to be sure.
vACNWfeWaa	You mean nursing school?  Most LPN/LVN programs are 1 year long, but that's cool that where you're from it's only 9 months.  You should take to your advisor and see what they will allow you to do.  I will be taking 2 weeks off and then going back to school (I will graduate with a BSW next summer).  <br>  <br>  Good luck!  I think it's awesome that you're so motivated.|`|445676ee4ba9ef6e5bd44f0f3b9d7501aa	You need to discuss this with your school and its professors.  Some course work requires you to be exposed to radiation, chemicals, etc...or may require you to do some heavy lifting...none of these things are appropriate while you are pregnant.  Perhaps they can develop a specialized learning plan to accomodate your condition, or give you a recommendation appropriate for your situation.|`|MmXHvBlNaa	Sure your class can deliever the kid for credits.|`|vIYqOG8Uaa	it depends on the program.  some schools will work with you, you just have to ask your advisor.|`|bebee00e4f3a4e5d156594de8d4a527eaa	You'd have to ask the school about that.|`|m2aznd8xaa	you should be able to stay in school as long as your well to do so.and when baby is due you can also put your studies in hold and go back when ready to as well you wont advance with your normal group of peers probably but you can always go back and finish. if you have a dean of anyone else in charge of your studys and credits let them know your situation and that u will be back to finish. as for staying as long as your healthy and up to it you can attend until your in labor.
byXx3o1oaa	Looks like twin girls to me|`|72SrLDQ3aa	They both look like girls to me, they have the 3 lines.<br>  Though Twin A could possibly be a boy...that one is kinda hard to tell.<br>  But Twin B is definitely a girl.|`|em8A42Bqaa	They both look like girls|`|miPubuDYaa	They look like girls to me. My sono pic (of my son to be) you can clearly see a penis. Even at 16 weeks. Now that i'm 29 weeks my last sono pic look like my little had a hard on. It was complete evident that he is a boy.<br>  <br>  My hubby is happy|`|UXoTCL98aa	Twin A does look a little IFY. HMMM could be a boy, but i'm doubting it. I'll go with a girl, b/c i think its leaning more in that direction. But Twin B is DEFINITELY a girl.|`|sHzSYL5raa	Are they identical?|`|dd5d0f065b45c14a02d51f88fefe773eaa	I am 27 weeks pregnant with my 3rd boy. I would definitely say it looks like both babies are girls!! CONGRATS!!|`|gLnCgMVJaa	they both look like girls. When i was pregnant the second time the doctor at 16 weeks told me to guess based on the ultrasound pic i told him boy and i was right. I clearly looks like a penis, your pictures show 3 lines in each picture. What did your doctor say?
HAIHByGOaa	My hubby has been pretty good about taking more c hores on and not complaining about it, but emotionally.... I could beat him too lol.  Its like i bore him when I get all excited about something the baby does, or something i  found out at the appt.  He just doesnt wanna hear it.  Like I think he was excited in the beginning, now its kinda old because he really doesnt understand how awesome it is and feels, but when our son is born next week... I think he will be a complete wreck.  So all the frustration I have towards him now should be worth it in the end lol|`|gx4s68s8aa	Yes- I am 33 weeks now and my husband does not understand how difficult it is for me to move around.  We have a two year old and it is getting very difficult for me to clean up after her and do anything beyond the basics with regards to taking care of her.<br>  <br>  And since I am high risk he thinks that I should just be happy because nothing bad has happened yet with this pregnancy.  With the first one I had a blood clot in the 26 week and it was very scary.  So now I am not allowed to complain about anything (heartburn, the painful kicks, throwing up, back aches) because as long as it is not life threatening he doesn't seem to think it matters.<br>  <br>  But- yes I can completely understand wanting to "cheerfully beat my husband'  I am all with you on that.|`|qcS20U9eaa	Until every man in this world has a baby, not one will understand or be understanding of a pregnancy.|`|ixD2RnqTaa	My boyfriend acts like a jerk to. Doesnt really realize that I am the one carrying the baby and it takes a toll on me to.|`|43jBlaesaa	No. BTW:"tireder" is NOT a real word.|`|jNPCT96Xaa	I am not going to pretend I know what your husband (or any man for that matter) is going through while his partner is pregnant, but I will say this about my husband during all of my (failed) pregnancies: He was extremely concerned about the baby. From what I gathered, to him if the baby was ok, it would make me feel better and reduce stress for me. At my appointments, he was the one asking questions about heartbeats and size and everything else. He took all of my hormonal mood swings in stride but I think from their point of view they look at us as the strong goddesses we are and that we can do anything and don't need their help.<br>  <br>  I do also think there are jackasses out there who don't think they need to cater to a pregnant woman's needs and just don't get it. I think they are the ones who are well acquainted with their sofa.<br>  <br>  If it were me, i would tell my husband he was being an *** and to at least be a little more accomodating.<br>  <br>  Good luck with a healthy pregnancy.

I am no expert but I think the pain in your chest is due to heart burn as you are 4'11 & bub is growing hence causing the "pressure" in your chest. Also, cos of your size, there is not much room for bub to move hence causing the pain. Tell your concern to your doctor / midwife during your fortnightly visit.<br>  <br>  Good luck|`|xeS8pUfbaa	heart burn! im 34 weeks pregnant also and i get the same thing. try tumms, and try pooping more
sVPToYvKaa	ZACHARY MARTIN & EMME GRACE*<br>  They sound like royalty names [:|`|cCXGEZxaaa	Zackary Martin and Emme Grace<br>  <br>  personally I like spelling Zachary with an h but your kid :)<br>  <br>  Congratulations<br>  <br>  I think naming a child Maksim is rather cruel and Genevieve is a mouthful for any little girl, and I just plain dislike the name Jack for some reason.<br>  I do think that Zackary Martin and Kaelyn Joy would sound good together, if you're open to change|`|k4gXIxJNaa	Zack and Emmy, it sounds the best together.<br>  <br>  Not Genevieve, the two repeated strong G's in the last name would be to much.<br>  <br>  Maksim, even though it looks cool, nobody would be able to pronounce it and that from experience is very annoying, but max and kaelyn would be good|`|prllht3vaa	1. I really like Zackary Martin & Emme Grace cause it sounds really proper and cute!<br>  <br>  2. And Maksim Gabriel & Kaelyn Joy cause they are unique, and really nice names.|`|z0ro3VkJaa	One of the first two, the names that don't sound God awful.<br>  <br>  Jack and Genevieve is probably best...|`|mbfXOPRXaa	I like Genevieve Grace DiGiovanni and Zackary Gabriel DiGiovanni|`|lBW6n3I1aa	My favorite is Zackary Martin and Emme Grace, but I also love the first set too!|`|fiUF4cAXaa	I like Emme Grace and Maksim Gabriel because these names I really dont hear.|`|DHwPgw9iaa	I like Zack and Emme. But I really don't like Grace. My favorite combo would be this one:<br>  <br>  Zackary Gabriel DiGiovanni & Kaelyn Marcelia DiGiovanni.|`|IN1X1CVGaa	Jack Bassam & Genevieve Marcelia: i just dont like jack<br>  and Genevieve is a mouth full with the last name.<br>  <br>  Emme Grace: that name is just annoying, but grace is cute!<br>  Maksim Gabriel: is that even a name? seriously?<br>  <br>  Zackary Martin: cute with kaelyn joy<br>  Kaelyn Joy: cute with zackary (:<br>  PICK THESE!!|`|e17025d63b591426b1c43c2197cd3fc8aa	I love Jack and Genevieve!  They are both classy and sweet. <br>  <br>  Zackary is spelled wrong. Emme is boring and childish. Maksim is nice. Kaelyn is trendy and tacky.|`|vSTtAfOWaa	Okay well my favorite for the baby girl is Kaelyn Joy but I don't really like Maksim Gabriel. I think for a boy Zackary Martin is the best.|`|JgDRKLuLaa	Zackary Martin? Like the character from Suite Life of Zack and Cody?|`|423983e632cb60a59de566f2b6c70711aa	Maksim Gabriel and Kaelyn Joy.
Lwsv80xhaa	I love Noah Braedyn!  When I was pregnant, my top 2 boys names were Braeden & Noah (with a different middle name we had already picked out)!  I had a girl though!<br>  <br>    I like Lauren Isabella or Adison Belle (Adison Leighann is good too).  I prefer more traditional names, not popular names "of the moment".  If you go with Emma, your daughter will be one of a bazillion!  Same with Isabella.  I think Addison may get more popular (because of Grey's Anatomy) .. and with Caelyn, even though it's pretty, it's too trendy for me .. people may not know how to pronounce it & your daughter will ALWAYS  have to spell it for people.  <br>  <br>  Good Luck!|`|k4gXIxJNaa	Defiantly for the boy the is cute.<br>  <br>  Addison Tristan or Addison Belle, but leigh anne is too long, and the other first names are too boring and too common. Like all middle names though|`|dnEmjUkNaa	i think noah brayden is really cute<br>  <br>  my favorite girl name is caelyn isabella<br>  i think you and i have similar tastes in names<br>  <br>  vote on mine :)<br>  <a href="http://babynames.com/namelist/9682789" rel="nofollow">http://babynames.com/namelist/9682789</a>|`|DmZw8nq5aa	I love Noah but don't really like Braedyn. What about Noah Bradley?<br>  <br>  I like Lauren Isabella the best out of your girl's list.|`|GTcqiMpoaa	Adison Leigh-Anne<br>  I like the boy's name.|`|P6FI1ihmaa	Isabella Tristen|`|ebf87818368e1c5ba437b603a767ba44aa	Aphrodite for girl name<br>  <br>  it's god of beauty|`|DHwPgw9iaa	Noah Braedyn is very cute, though I think it should be spelled Brayden, the usual way. Braedyn is just too cutesy, and it's a little feminine looking.<br>  <br>  I like Lauren Isabella. Lauren is my middle name. :]|`|SVyBjDguaa	Boy- Noah Braedyn [YES OR NO] --- No, love Noah but don't think it goes good with Braedyn =]<br>  <br>  Girl- Please pick your favorite.<br>  <br>  Adison Leigh-Anne<br>  <br>  <br>  =]|`|vSTtAfOWaa	Um...well I am not crazy about the boy name.
