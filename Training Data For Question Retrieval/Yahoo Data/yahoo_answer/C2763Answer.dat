j3o8q7e9aa	In Nacogdoches, you might try Union Cafe, Auntie Pasta's, Clear Springs, Szechuan, or maybe the Fredonia Hotel.  (I like Delacroix's, but it may not have a lot of room for Valentine's Day, as it's basically a little converted gas station).    In downtown Lufkin, there's a place called Manhattan's that's pretty good and off the beaten path -- maybe a little pricey, though (you should also definitely get reservations).  South of the loop in Lufkin, there's all the normal chain stuff like Red Lobster, Outback, etc.|`|VXcp8hvHaa	burger king|`|pbV7dnKKaa	The best way to find good restaurants in Nacogdoches is by looking at an online phone book, thats typically what I do to find restaurants! A good place that might be worthy lol is Delacroixs Seafood Restaurant. Being close to the ocean in Texas makes the seafood really really good. Hope that helps!

Don't spit in peoples' food if they don't tip.  I've noticed a lot of junkies here don't.  Be polite, smile and know your specials.  Eat there when you can so you know what's really good.  I like lemons with my tea, so bring me a bowl of them, please.    Good luck with your new job and don't let snotty people get you down.  We're all not a**holes when we go out to eat.|`|jutjY81Paa	I have waited tables for several years, and have been at the OG since May of 2008. Here's my best advice for someone just starting out at OG with little or no waiting experience:    Most Important Tip:  - At Olive Garden, the single most important thing is getting a complete, accurate order in the computer correctly and getting salad/soup out to a table as fast as possible.  Most problems start here.  You'll learn all about the computer in training and it will take some practice, but the principle is getting from the table-to the computer-and back to the table with salad/soup and breadsticks.  You want salad out to a table as soon as possible.  On busy nights, hungry guests have already waited an hour or more for a table, so they're going to have short tempers for long wait times once they are at a table.  Waiting tables is a lot more than just bringing the people in your section the drinks and food they need.  You're going to have to run other people's food, make tea/coffee/breadsticks, change soda cartridges, fetch ice, glasses, and change, and do other stuff.  All of this takes precious time.  Try your best to do as much of that as you can when your tables are sitting fat and happy, and definitely run food when you aren't taking care of your own guests.  Concentrate very hard on the order and putting it in.  Hungry people care most about one thing: food, and as fast as possible.      Suggest, Inform, Endorse/Reading Your Guests:  - At training they will probably tell you about SIE - Suggest, Inform, Endorse.  Most servers forget to do this but it can and will earn you bigger tips: find an appetizer that you like personally, learn everything about it.  Do the same for 2-3 entrees (Mine: Seafood Portofino, Tour of Italy, Braised Beef Tortelloni).  Learn everything about these items.  Tell guests about your "favorites" whenever they ask you for your suggestion or can't make up their minds.      - Try to read your guests: Find out what they're doing that day.  If they're on a trip and it's late at night, they'll probably want coffee.  If they mention something about trying to eat healthy or staying away from carbs, inform them of the garden-fare options, which in my opinion, have no sacrifices in taste/quality (OG also substitutes whole wheat linguine for free in place of any pasta or other starch such as rice, potatoes, and french fries.)  If they're about to go shopping, they'll probably want a to-go cup.  If you're trying to get a drink order at a table with screaming kids, inform the parents about Milk and Apple/Grape Juice.  Soda will only keep the kids going 100 mph.  If they mention something about someone in the hospital, someone being sick, or someone at home, (basically, if they inform you of anyone else in their life that's not with them at the moment), encourage them to place a to-go order!  Talking to your guests makes you human, versus a faceless being running back and forth from the kitchen, and the things you learn about them can increase their overall satisfaction, and therefore, your tip!  Plus, talking to your guests makes the job fun (or at least not completely boring), and can really save you from doing a lot of the stupid physical work of running food out to tables.  As long as your other tables don't need anything at the moment, never pass up an opportunity to talk to a table.    - Of course, don't be annoying.  Have you ever been out to eat and been annoyed by the server?  Having someone constantly in your face doesn't make you want to give them a higher tip.  Also, realize that there will be many tables that won't allow much interaction.  They'll tell you what they want and that's it.  Don't bug these people.  Play their game and you'll get a higher tip.  Just keep their drinks full and anticipate their needs -- have their check with you when they're 3/4 finished.  They'll appreciate you being prepared and the sooner they get up, the sooner you'll get another table.    - In my opinion, there is no need to ask tables "How is everything?"  Because things are fine unless they're not!  It's very simple!!!  If something's wrong, a table will be quick to let you know about a problem.  If the table makes eye contact with you while you're walking by, that probably means it's okay to stop and chat . . . .usually about something more interesting/uplifting than questions about anything that could possibly be wrong.  Don't say "Do you want more Coke?"  Just say "I'll be right back with Coke," because they'll always want more to drink unless they specifically reply that they don't!  Pay attention to what you say, and eliminate stupid questions.      - It's not appropriate to interrupt a table's conversation or distract them in any way, before, during, and after a meal.  A table will invite you to talk with them through their body language and eye contact.  If they aren't giving you the signals, don't force yourself on them.  Here's a few reasons when it's okay to interrupt:    - The first time yo

It's on Raphael Street, www.zumarestaurant.com   Or see here for roka, www.rokarestaurant.com     You can alos try Coccoon on Regents street, or Yakitoria in Sheldon Square, Paddington.  I've eaten at them all.|`|7c8b371e0b04e76e20703cd13835fb60aa	Depends how much you're planning on spending. For a serious sit-down sushi meal, head for Roka on Charlotte St or Kulu Kulu in Soho. There's even not one but two outposts of Nobu (one in Park Lane and one in Mayfair - if someone else is paying!)    If you want the more informal "conveyor belt" thing without questionable fish, go for Moshi Moshi near Liverpool St Station.    If you just want a box lunch, Sushi Samurai on London Wall or Baker St is pretty good, but even Pret's sushi is surprisingly palatable for a chainstore.    And yes, Ping Pong is dim sum, but thoroughly gorgeous. Biggest and best one is next to National Theatre on the South Bank (5 min walk from London Eye and Houses of Parliament... and always jammed on a Friday).    Another excellent dim sum place is the Drunken Monkey on Shoreditch High St - 5 min walk from Liverpool St Station|`|46CsV5oQaa	the one opposite harrods is nice! had some there on saturday :) mm mmmmmmmmmm..|`|BmbysFc3aa	Definitely Roka, fantastic|`|167dde7630e3f823a73ffc55a8b41632aa	Roka is definitely the best place for sushi in London, at least in my  opinion.|`|I8rnOqyeaa	My friend took me to Ikkyu in Soho and it was lovely!

k8HpMaHxaa	Its different for different states. We start @ $2.50 where I work    We get paid less then minimum wage, and our tips are supposed to even that out to a reasonable hourly wage. Although with the economy the way it is, tips have been going down tremendously.    *Just viewed your other post, and I noticed this one is a much 'nicer'. I'm hoping thats because you started to understand that not tipping your server is rude. We dont JUST write a check and carry the food. Not only are we doing thinks for you, but we have to juggle that between 4 or 5 other tables. While making salads, and getting refills, taking order, making desserts ect.     We are also taxed per bills. So if you come in and eat dinner, pay your bill, and dont leave a tip, because they are counted as our wages, we are taxed as if you HAD left a 15% tip.       If you told ever server that was 'underpaid' to get a new job, who do you think would serve you when you wanted to eat out?|`|PxJXJKCpaa	Not as a server making tips.  Most places I go, the waitstaff makes below 3 bucks and hour and lives on tips.  Now, pizza delivery guys make minimum, but if the joint needs a two dollar delivery fee, it does NOT go to the driver.  It goes mainly to maintain or buy new hot bags.  They're pretty costly and I've lost my share of them.  Tip your waitstaff, your pizza guys and your haircutting people.  They all work hard for a living.|`|AA10804824	Where are you, sweetie?

For example, I wouldn't want to suggest a Red Lobster to someone who hates seafood.      If it were me though.... I'd probably choose Outback Steakhouse or Olive Garden, depending on what you feel like.  Any place can be affordable or expensive, depending on what you order, but at most restaurants, I would say an average of like $15 a person should be expected, more if people decide to have more expensive meals.  Also depends on where you're located since there may not be the same places everywhere.    Another idea, if you want to be really affordable to your dad, would be some type of buffet.  Generally there's something for everyone there, and they aren't usually too expensive.  The food may not be as good as a regular restaurant, but its a trade off.    Afterwards, depends what you like.  Bowling, pool, mini-golf, some kind of multi person activity could be fun with like 7 people.  Could even go to a movie.  Just some ideas.|`|LSxBwiFSaa	What kind of Food do you all- Like ??? You could go Pizza (wherever YOU like); Wings (Streets of N.Y.); a good Burger place (like Ruby Tuesdays); a popular Mexican (Chili's)- you name it !!!
