EMDNVrcjaa	Glucuronolactone<br>  Glucuronolactone is a natural metabolite and carbohydrate that forms when glucose breaks down. It is believed to help rid the body of harmful substances and provide a big energy boost in a short period of time. It is a naturally occurring chemical compound produced by the metabolization of glucose in the human liver. Glucuronolactone has been shown to improve memory retention and concentration and act as an antidepressant and stimulant. It is present in some energy drinks and is purported to fight fatigue and provide a sense of well-being.
ozWi3TJlaa	I'm not quite that old, but we have a similar soda shoppe near us.  They've used black and white floor tiles, backless stools at the counter (the kind you can spin around in), and have decorated mainly with toys and 45 rpm records from that era.  The "soda jerks" wear paper hats and the waitresses wear poodle skirts.  Both wear white bucks or saddle shoes and short-sleeved white button-down shirts.<br>  <br>  The toys include a pedal car, an old parcheesi game, a 50s Monopoly game, comic books, etc.  I believe they had actually collected these items through the years, but I'll bet you could find reproductions online, probably from a restaurant supply.|`|36a3ynpJaa	I agree with the checker floors.  You also have to have a juke box.    Big skirts for the girls and short sleeved white button down shirts for the guys.  Old fashioned roller skates.  You could have someone in roller skates deliver to picnic tables.<br>  <br>  How about a vintage car parked  in front that they can eat out of?

AA11725139	If your ingredients are ready, you can probably grease or line your muffin tins, make the mix and fill the tins in about 10 minutes.

hQIfVWdMaa	Hells yeah!  The type of sugar in Apple juice is really unhealthy in large doses, especially without the antioxidents and pectin that aren't processed when the apple is juice-pressed.<br>  <br>  Orange juice with pulp is best.<br>  <br>  Stick to one glass a day of fruit juice.  It has just as much, if not more sugar than soda.  Any excess Vitamin C is peed out, so don't think you're doing your body all that natural goodness.|`|eL268hETaa	Too much orange juice can give you diarrhea and acid reflux... Sort of a vitamin C overdose flush-out.  I prefer to get the frozen Minute Maid LOW ACID orange juice, which is easier on the tummy.<br>  <br>  Apple juice also will flush you out, as it contains pectin.  Try to increase your water intake so you don't get kidney stones.|`|aGOI2AZ4aa	no there good for you, but you might have a sugar rush.|`|Gk4kNAWsaa	they are full of sugar. even Natural sugar can contribute to WEIGHT GAIN if you don't exercise regularly. please consider drinking a glass of water for every glass of juice. h20 is the best for you and just because juice is a liquid, doesn't mean that your body doesn't need the water.

Dice up chicken breasts and saute with salt pepper and soy sauce.  Buy a bag of frozen vegetables...there is usually a "stir fry blend" and steam those.

Sj9Z8jJKaa	Well first off, while you're sleeping you're obviously not putting any food into your system, thus your body naturally/biologically goes into "starvation mode" it thinks that you will not feed it for several hours more/days more, so it starts conserving all the fat you have in your body and storing it.. (what makes you gain weight).. it is very highly recommended that as soon as you wake up, eat something! (Of course unhealthy are not recommended) That way your body knows it shouldn't go into starvation mode and thus NOT store any fat.. <br>  <br>  Second, eating meals throughout the day (small ones every few hours) helps keep your metabolism running - and you want to have high metabolism to keep burning the foods/calories you consume..<br>  <br>  Third, eating breakfast helps your body jumpstart into working mode (energy burning) for the rest of the day..<br>  <br>  I'm sure there's several other reasons but from what I know those are some important ones..|`|ILpp3ncYaa	jumpstarts metabolism.|`|pIlIEgqoaa	After sleep you are breaking the fast...hence the word breakfast.

It not only helps you focus and keeps you warm, but it sets your metabolism for the day.  If you dont eat breakfast your body will think your having trouble "finding food" and therefore will try to conserve it.  This makes it harder to lose weight.|`|2c23e0a639132804f82bc3188ed0c455aa	if you don't eat breakfast, your metabolism will slow down because your body thinks that it isn't going to get much food that day. this means that anything you eat later is going to get stored as fat. plus, your mind works better and you're more alert when you eat breakfast.|`|vgCw179baa	because its good for you and by lunch if you didnt eat breakfast then your going to eat more than you should cuz you skipped breakfast which will cause ou to gain weight but if you dont skip youll feel better and wont gain weight

71h39Q5faa	One of Jamaica's most popular foods is coconut rice and beans.  You can use coconut milk or processed coconut.  Both are found in stores that carry island food products.  <br>  <br>  The easiest rice would be made with parboiled rice.  One part rice to two parts water.  I don't rinse my rice, some do.  If you use processed coconut, scrape the bar or slice it and place in the water.  Add an extra quarter cup and boil the coconut for at least 5 minutes then add the rice.  If you are using milk you add it to the water after you bring the water to a boil.<br>  <br>  You can use dry beans, you have to soak them in water overnight (or at least 6 hrs).  Or you can use canned kidney beans, any type.<br>  <br>  In the steamer you add all of the ingredients (salt, sazon, adobo, dry thyme and pepper, or whatever seasoning you use) and use the cook time listed in the directions for rice.  <br>  <br>  In a pot on the stove you place the rice in the boiling water, let it cook for ten minutes on a medium heat, then add the beans. When all of the water is gone taste the rice to be sure it's cooked.  If it isn't you need to add water in 1/4 cup increments if you are making 2 cups of rice or less.  1/2 cup increments if more than 2 cups.<br>  <br>  I prefer to use a rice pot on the stove but I hear good things about the rice steamer.  You may have to practice a few times to get it perfect.  You can add sliced cooked chicken to the rice or serve it separately.<br>  <br>  Good Luck.<br>  Dee|`|3d1XRIzkaa	http.yahoo.com/_ylt=A0geu7MFfqhJvHsB3BhX...

So celery, lettuces and cabbage are otherwise very low in carbohydrate sugars. They are wonderful when added to a daily diet full of fruits, vegetables, lean meats and dairy--but on their own, they don't do a lot for the body, especially helping you to feel full. <br>  And while it may seem like a fun fact, it's kind of useless when applied to what people actually eat!|`|AA10970943	No it's not true.<br>  <br>  Lettuce and other similar veggies, especially celery do have very little calorific value, i.e. you get very little energy (calories) from them compared to the amount required to chew, eat and digest them, but they have many other essential micro nutrients and fiber.<br>  <br>  As you can see from the sample chart below, a small head of lettuce even contains 3 grams of Protein. <br>  <br>   * * Lettuce, iceberg (incl. crisphead types), raw * * <br>  <br>  Refuse: 5%  (Core)<br>  Scientific Name:  Lactuca sativa var. capitata<br>  <br>  Nutrient - 1x head, small (324g)<br>  = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = <br>  Water   309.87 g<br>  Energy       45 kcal<br>  Protein    2.92 g<br>  Carbohydrate 9.6 g<br>  Fiber, total dietary 3.9 g<br>  Calcium, Ca  58 mg<br>  Iron, Fe  1.33 mg<br>  Vitamin A, 1626 IU<br>  Vitamin C, total ascorbic acid  9.1 mg<br>   <br>  Please look at the link below for the full list of all the nutrients you'll find in the lettuce.|`|EP07aiKkaa	The lettuce has almost no calories, but most darker green lettuces are very high in minerals and nutrients!!

My husband also loves apple pie, it was one of the first things I baked for him before we got married and he thought it tasted better than the store kind. Since you already have a recipe, I'm assuming it's the usual apple pie recipe. Crust made with flour, butter, and salt, and apple sauce made with apple slices, cinnamon, brown sugar and corn starch, right?<br>  <br>  I think apple pie is just apple pie. But if you want it to look extra special, you can always weave the top crust of the pie, it'll look really nice! It may look a little tough at first but it's really easy. You should also consider serving the pie to your husband with a scoop of vanilla ice cream, or whatever other flavour you both enjoy. <br>  <br>  PS, Save me a piece!

Meanwhile chop 2 bunches of green onions, 2 jars of marinated artichokes (save marinade) and about a cup of sliced green olives.

oMmBhWK4aa	The use of curry powder directly imparts a rawer curry taste & is not that fragrant. The best way to bring out the aroma is to make a spice paste which is very easy if you've a blender or food processor. Blend or finely mince onions, garlic, shallots, some ginger, fresh chilli if you want it spicier and mix with curry powder and some water to form a curry paste. If available, herbs like lemongrass, kaffir lime leaves & galangal are a bonus. Stir fry the paste in a little oil for 4-5 minutes or until the fragrance really comes out. When the paste is cooled, you can use it to marinade your meats for a few hours, longer time for a more intense flavor. Fish is delicate so just a short 30min is enough. If you don't want the hassle, then buy ready-made curry pastes instead of raw curry powder.|`|wVJ4PJJXaa	Try making a "marinade" for your chicken.

You can sautee it in a few teaspoons of oil or you can place it in water at a boil for a few minutes.<br>  <br>  Either way you would add your seasonings to the mixture and marinate your chicken overnight or for a few hours before you steam it.  You want the chicken to absorb the seasoning so that it will remain while steaming.  I use 4 teaspoons of curry to 6 medium chicken breasts.  I use a spicy/hot jamaican curry but there are a few different types.  After you have done it once you can adjust according to your taste.<br>  <br>  Clean your chicken, rub the marinade you have made (mine would include the curry heated in oil, adobo, fresh garlic, sliced green onion or chopped onion, black pepper, and thyme) into the chicken.  I use skinless but if yours has skin on it, either pierce it or move it and rub the meat under it. <br>  <br>  You can steam it, broil it, bake it, sautee it in the pan, or braise it in a dutch oven.<br>  <br>  Good Luck.<br>  Dee|`|uq4ZuWnEaa	I do't have a steamer but here is a way I marinate chicken for the grill/oven or barbq.  which I am sure you can use in a steamer too.<br>  as many chicken pieces as you require pricking the pieces all over with a fork and placing them in the yoghurt and curry mix covering the chicken all over.  Place in the fridge overnight is best place the chicken in your steamer when you are ready to cook.  I usually make my own powder and paste a little on the strong side but you have to adjust yours to your own taste|`|sqCvPQIRaa	Absolutely you must fry the spice briefly before using it.  Many of the curry spices are lipophilic, whihc means they give up their flavour to oil when heated.  They wont give up flavour in the same way to water, no matter how hot that is and the whole dish will have a horrible uncooked spice flavour.

Enjoy!<br>  <br>  Copycat Starbucks Frappuccino Recipe<br>  I have played with Todd's Wilbur's recipe for Starbuck's Frappuccino, until I have gotten it just the way I like it. Here is my recipe that half my family is hooked on and making. Enjoy!<br>  <br>  This recipe makes 5 different flavors, if desired.<br>  15 empty Starbuck bottles & lids (I mark with permanent marker a letter on 3 lids for the flavor of that batch - i.e. C=coffee, M=mocha, V=vanilla, etc.)<br>  <br>  1 1/4 cups sugar<br>  5 tsp. dry pectin<br>  13 3/4 cups 2% milk - or Lactaid 100, 38% less fat (I use this since it has a longer shelf life, even though it costs a little more)<br>  10 Tbsp. Maxwell House Italian Expresso Roast Coffee<br>  5 1/2-3/4 cups water<br>  <br>  Flavors -<br>  1 tsp. unsweetenend cocoa or Quick drink mix,<br>  1 Tbsp. of liquid coffee flavorings (sold in grocery store by coffee) vanilla, hazlenut, almond, almond roca, raspberry, irish creme, etc., desired amount of extracts, 1 Tbsp. liquid baking flavorings (i.e. cinnamon, praline, etc.)<br>  <br>  1. Brew the 10 Tbsp. of coffee with the 5 1/2-3/4 cups cold water.<br>  <br>  2. Get blender out and ready.<br>  <br>  3. For each batch of 3 bottles...While coffee is still hot...measure out 2 3/4 cups milk, set aside...in blender, place 1/4 cup sugar, 1 tsp. pectin, any of the above flavorings (or make up your own)-for just plain coffee flavor, do not add any flavors, 1/2 cup of hot coffee and mix a few seconds at a low speed - #5 for me(too high and you get too much froth) to give sugar a chance to dissolve. While running pour in steadily the cold milk. Turn off after only a second or two of being mixed.<br>  <br>  4. Pour into 3 prepared bottles.<br>  <br>  5. Repeat the above for 4 more batches, changing flavors if desired. I try to do my flavors so that I don't have to rinse out the blender each time (i.e. coffee, vanilla, hazlenut, praline, mocha), saving the strongest flavor until<br>  last.<br>  <br>  I did try adding eggnog as part of the milk over Christmas, but wasn't crazy about it.

Just like any addiction you may go through with drawls when you quit. Some of these with drawl symptoms you may feel are easy to fix by switching to decaf or try herbal tea, other symptoms that are usually more physical (for example headaches, exhaustion, clumsiness) will only go away with time, but you will be better for it if you can push through it.|`|B3BrDzSyaa	Absolutely. That is why most hospitals now routinely serve coffee or a caffeinated soft drink to patients after coming out of surgery. Generally, patients are told to refrain from caffeine 12 hours before surgery. If you're a real caffeine user, by the time the anesthetic is wearing off, you will be in withdrawal, which causes the headache.|`|AA10231834	yea  u can get a lot of side effects when you  stop drinking coffee.  u can also get a lot of other effects.<br>  <br>  here is a site to check on the other withdrawl syptoms<br>  <br>  <a href="http://coffeetea.about.com/od/caffeine/a/symptoms.htm" rel="nofollow">http://coffeetea.about.com/od/caffeine/a...</a>|`|MPX0f5jzaa	Yes, due to the caffeine addiction (chemical) that the brain has built.|`|ceebbd5b347bf3b3c44701e742d76f97aa	Yes, caffine is a vasoconstrictor. When you suddenly cut yourself off it causes swelling in backlash.<br>  <br>  Get some caffine pills from the pharmacy, or caffinated mints. Dose yourself like it is a medicine so you can keep breaking the habbit besides the addiction.<br>  <br>  If you normally drink 4-6 cups a coffee a day try 200 mg caffine. Or two pills. Try that for about a week, then cut back to 100 for another week then 50, you should be fine after that.<br>  <br>  Don't take more than the box recomends, the warnings are for a reason. If caffine pills seem weird to you check out some OTC migrain pills, most of them are just tylenol with caffine.|`|HMzsm50vaa	Yes it's true.  I like Crystal's solution.  You could also try green tea like lipton green tea bags and they even have different flavors.  It tastes pretty good with splenda or you could even chew some peppermint gum as a sweetener.  Anyway, green tea has caffeine, but it is much less than coffee.  I really don't think you should take the excedrin migraine....I just don't think that's a good idea.|`|rGci1ehoaa	yes it is. when your body is used to consuming caffiene on a regular basis and you quit you are likely to get headaches... try excedrin migraine it has caffiene in it!!|`|Uiew8yuCaa	Yup, while visiting my mum she gave my husband decaf coffee.

If I'm feeling spendy, I top it with shredded cheese and sour cream.<br>  <br>  You are spending double what my household of 2 persons spends. Sometimes, quick and tasty = expensive. You may have to revise your cooking style if you want to save money. <br>  <br>  Use coupons - I can't say this often enough. Consider using store brands; most of them have a money back guarantee. Be flexible with your menu - sometimes, seasonal foods are less expensive. Example: fresh asparagus is more expensive in the wintertime. Steer clear of prepackaged convenience foods like Shake & Bake, frozen mac & cheese and Hamburger Helper and make your own for pennies. Spend a rainy Sunday making chili or soup and freeze some in 1 or 2-cup portions for later use; a full freezer runs more efficiently, so you might as well pack it full of food.<br>  <br>  I could go on, but you get the general idea. You don't have to live on ramen noodles to save money on food, it just takes some planning.|`|XcNoptFbaa	Meat Loaf<br>  2 lbs hamburger <br>  6 saltine crackers <br>  1 egg <br>  1/4 cup ketchup <br>  1 tablespoon sweet relish <br>  1 teaspoon garlic powder <br>  1 teaspoon dried parsley <br>  1 teaspoon dried oregano <br>  salt and pepper <br>  Sauce<br>  2 (10 ounce) cans condensed tomato soup <br>  1 (28 ounce) can tomato juice <br>  On the side<br>  5 potatoes, cut into quarters <br>  6 carrots, cut into 1 inch thick pieces <br>  Directions<br>  1preheat oven to 350. <br>  2crush crackers. <br>  3beat egg. <br>  4combine all meat loaf ingredients. <br>  5mould into a log shape. <br>  6place into a deep oblong roasting pan (with lid). <br>  7Surround meat loaf with patatoes and carrots. <br>  8cover with 1 can of tomato soup and all of tomato juice. <br>  9Cover and bake for 1 hour. <br>  10Remove lid. <br>  11add second can of tomato soup, directly on top of meat loaf. <br>  12Return to oven, without lid, and bake another 1/2 hour. <br>  13Enjoy! <br>  14The next day, I make a second meal of the leftovers, by cutting up meat in chunks (leave meat,patatoes and carrots in the sauce) and serve over rice or pasta. <br>  15OPTION: I sometimes add a handful (1/4 cup) of basmati rice to the mixture before cooking.|`|hT7BhNamaa	Josie T, slow down a moment here, before you look at cheap meal ideas, you have to sort your shopping out first. You have to look at your pantry, make a list for your next grocery order. On your list should be things like potatoes. Do you know how long a five pound bag will last you, and a two pound bag of onions. When your looking at meat, look at the tougher meat that you use for stew, also look at the leaflets with the specials. I cut our household shopping expenses from an average of $285.00 down to $90.00, but I hit the farmers markets, sand I also look at free range direct from the farms. <br>  <br>  Think about it, think about one Saturday taking a drive. if you buy a whole chicken you can cut it into segments, and freeze the pieces how you want etc.<br>  <br>  Chris|`|zjFMdPOiaa	I would recommend getting the coupon section of the newspaper and spend a few minutes a week clipping coupons, and looking at the sale flyers.<br>  Purchase your staple items like canned goods, milk, bread, pasta, eggs, and fresh vege's at a discount store like Aldi.  Watch the sale flyers for meat and items on sale and use your coupons and stock up a little bit when things are on sale.<br>  You can purchase a larger piece of meat, and cut it into individual bags and freeze it.  You can still eat really good on a budget.  <br>  I would start with the paper, and don't dismiss the coupons.  There are many stores that offer double and sometimes even triple coupons.  Take full advantage of that!<br>  <br>  If you spend some time on planning and organizing, you will be amazed how well you can do with your budget. <br>  <br>  Another tip:<br>  If you have a turkey breast of whole chicken, don't throw away the carcas.  Use it to make soup.  Place the carcas in a pan with some water to make your chicken stock.  With a few additional ingredients, you will have some yummy soup.<br>  Same with a ham.  Save the bone and use it to make ham and bean soup.  The bone will create some yummy flavor to the soup.<br>  Many things that you would consider trash, can be turned into something delicious.<br>  Good Luck!|`|EMfLFsXEaa	Cheap, quick and easy meals can be made with rice or pastas. If you cut down your meat intake and stick to vegetables and fruits, it can make a huge difference. Instead of meat stus, make vegie stus. Eat fresh fruits and make fresh salads. Instead of buying coffee before dinner, by a genaric brand of instant coffee, or better yet, get one of those one-cup coffee makes (since it's just you at home.) Remember to use coupons and stock up on a lot of dry foods and maybe even canned stuff. Some of the stuff that my husband and I have lived on are:<br>  <br>  no name pasta<br>  no name pasta sauce<br>  dry chinese noodles<br>  rice<br>  canned beans (used in stus and curries)<br>  canned chick peas<br>  frozen juices<br>  frozen mixed vegetables<br>  homemade coffee<br>  coffee whitener from the dollar store<br>  <br>  Good luck.|`|juXQJJrXaa	THIS RECIPE IS EASY EASY AND CHEAP CHEAP!

If we knew what you usually eat it would help us help you cut down.<br>  <br>  I gotta get going with dinner but I will be back to offer some tips.<br>  <br>  *********Once again it would be nice if we knew what you were spending 200 bucks a month for just one person on? I spend around 200 or less for 4 people.<br>  <br>  Buy store brands of ketchup, mustard, and most condiments. I do draw the line at mayo though, and also if I buy canned tomato soup it must be Campbells, but others I buy what ever.<br>  <br>  Buy meats in bulk, and packaje in one or two servings of each meat in freezer baggies. Date and lable then stick in the fridge.<br>  <br>  Stock up on frozen veggies. As far as fresh I keep carrots, celery, onions, garlic and potatoes. Then of course I buy other fresh produce as long as it is a good deal.<br>  <br>  Fruits are harder. I like ornages and usually have ornages in the fridge, then anything else depends on sale prices. But frozen or canned are good and cheap.<br>  <br>  Don't buy pre-packeged meals or other things. You can make your own spahetti sauce, salsa etc... for really a lot cheaper than store bought brands.<br>  <br>  Cut back on junk. Soda and chips are expensive. If you must have them buy store brands, or even as far as soda goes. A 2 liter of store brand soda is usually less than a dollar. At Smiths thier brand of soda is only .69 for 2 liters. And buy wal-mart brand chips for like 1 dollar or 1.25.<br>  <br>  Don't forget about the dollar store. I can get a lot of spices and that kind of stuff at the dollar store.

When I was divorced in 1994 I lived on Pasta with my own homemade sauce, and bean soup without ham. Meat and fresh veggies are the more expensive items on the menu (not all fresh veggies) so if you can get your needed proteins and fiber from other sources but at less $$ you can get thru. I found that pasta and beans gave me what I needed at an affordable cost.<br>  <br>  Look at some of the squashes that are available. On a pound for pound basis, they are very affordable, and can be used to make sauces for your pastas. Tons of recipes on the web.
AA11600789	I have been a chef, I have been a caterer...the only stuff I would buy is Farberware.  Calaphon and all that other "designer" stuff?

Four four people you need four pieces of chicken or 8 thin pork chops, four carrots, four stalks of celery, about two cups of chopped spinach, and a half inch piece of ginger..<br>  <br>  Put diced carrot, celery, and chopped spinach in a lightly oiled roasting pan with spices of your choice. Try a half teaspoon of shaved ginger and then add a few other spices, a dash of allspice or a teaspoon of basil and a teaspoon of salt.<br>  <br>  Then add the chicken pieces, breasts, leg quarters or you can use the pork chops. Cover with aluminium foil and roast  for 25 -45 minutes until the meat is done.<br>  <br>  When the chicken or the pork chops are finished, set aside with the vegetables and keep warm. Set the roasting pan aside so you can deglaze it. <br>  <br>  Boil pasta of your choice. Fettuccine would be good. When it finishes, drain, toss with olive oil and season with salt and pepper. <br>  <br>  While the pasta is boiling, deglaze the roasting pan with a half cup of white wine. Heat the pan, add the wine, stir and scrape continuously Cook down until syrupy. Add one and a half cups of light cream and cook gently for three minutes, stirring constantly.Season to taste with salt and pepper.

It dries to the touch.  Once your cake is decorated, do not cover it.  The shortening in the frosting seals the cake and keeps it moist.

One is the linking of Black people in a negative way to chicken and watermelon. The origins of these stereotypes are unclear. They may have begun as Southern stereotypes and then evolved into Black stereotypes. It's also possible that these evolved out of American slavery. Numerous primary sources chronicle Black resistance to slavery through "silent sabotage," or, day-to-day acts of resistance. Stealing from the master was one example. It seems logical that, given that food would be among the most desirable of items a slave would pilfer, and chickens and watermelons would have been commonly available. Solomon Northup, for example, tells of being put in charge of punishing slaves who got into the master's watermelon patch. Rather than carry out the punishment, Northup had the slaves show him the way to the patch. The connecting of Blacks to chicken and watermelon was done in a way to dehumanize Blacks and subject them to ridicule. This process helped contribute to prejudice and discrimination. Surprisingly, many young people are unaware of the long history of these stereotypes, while some older Black people refuse to eat watermelon because of that history.|`|J3Y3HO7Kaa	I'd have to be one of those naive people like the Los Alamitos mayor who didn't know that the watermelon symbolism was offensive to black people.

Just make sure that it's not a friend who would want to bug you and your guests, too!<br>  *Set out a few board games so the ones who don't fall asleep right away can quietly keep themselves busy. <br>  *Get something special for breakfast or easy.<br>    Donuts, bagels & cream cheese, fruit with whip cream and dip, individual juices.|`|A5nZFjEoaa	You could have a mall scavenger hunt.

mzk0t6Ovaa	Malt = Malted barley<br>  <br>  Yes, it's natural.  In its purest form, it's the base from which most<br>  beers are brewed.<br>  <br>  Basically, the barley is harvested and dried.  Once the barleycorns<br>  have dried, they're steeped in water at around 65F, with the water<br>  being changed out over three to four days, until the acrospire has<br>  grown until it's about 75-90% of the length of the barley kernel.<br>  <br>  Once the malt has had a chance to modify, it's kilned off at varying<br>  temperatures and moisture levels to impart different characteristics<br>  (e.g., caramel, pilsner, roast, chocolate, etc.).<br>  <br>  Once it's finished kilning, the malted barley is ground into "flour" or<br>  "powder."|`|us5rh2I5aa	Same thing as a shake, except they put malt mix into it.|`|OXaT6E2vaa	its like chocolate kind of with a slight difference. it taste just liek whopper candies if you have ever had them i do not think it natural
XHnpraaxaa	The flavor should be the same but the texture would not be.  I like making it fresh myself.  Same effect as doing green peppers or others foods in the freezer.  Can be used for cooking but you would not want to add them to a salad or something like that.|`|AA11600789	I can't live without my frozen orange zest! ...and lemon....and lime. Whenever I need OJ or eat an orange, I zest the outside first.  I line an ice cube tray with plastic wrap, pack in the zest and freeze.  Then pop them out, wrap and...well, I have a vacuum machine, but you could put them in a ziplock too.<br>  <br>  Whenever I need zest for any of my baking recipes, I just pop one out.  The skin...the "zest" is oil-based, not water based, so if properly wrapped it should last a while and be just as good as fresh zest in most recipes.

They are a great alternative to bread and really filling.  In winter I warm up a tortilla for a about 15 seconds in the microwave with last night's chili on top, so it takes the cold edge off, then pack it with salad and some mayo.  You can always serve some hot soup with wraps as well, they go really nicely together, like a sandwich and salad.  Makes a filling lunch or dinner, just pack in your veg or salad to add to one of your 5 a day!  You don't even have to use standard salad veg, rocket and spinach make a really nice addition to any wrap.  Freshly ground black pepper will pep up all of these fillings, too!

PTc2HApMaa	this is extremely normal:<br>  contrary to what others believe, dieting is stupid, it makes you sick, it makes you depressed,it makes you obsessed with food it makes you unhealthy,it makes you stupid-although I think to go on a diet you must already be stupid and-, THEY DON'T WORK!!!. But there are two diets that work, no not the Atkinson's, or binging or bulimia. The first is is called a healthy balanced lifestyle. The other is called EAT WHATEVER YOU WANT!! No I am not crazy, it does work. This is a revolutionary idea and scary for people who crave chocolates and 'bad' foods all the time. But think about it - maybe the only reason you are so crazy about ice ream is you wont let yourself eat it. You have to be friends with your body, live in it, and trust it. some people are a little freaked out at first by all the permission. They think they will eat 12 gallons of ice cream, 6 pizzas and dozens of donuts.After a while your body will be calling out broccoli as loudly as it used to call out ice cream. Try it it is so much easier. You won't just balloon out and become fat all of a sudden. Your body normally has a set, natural weight.|`|IDBTk9Ydaa	Drink more water.

ZCzxHXVqaa	Yes,<br>   your going to have to cream the butter, peanut butter, and sugar till they are lighter in color, and make a very well, creamy texture, and you should definitely use a blender or hand mixer. otherwise your going to get pretty sore trying to do it with a spoon or spatula.<br>  Blending is just combing the four ingredients, no machines required, this is just to make sure that you evenly spread out the baking soda and salt.  <br>  by the way, when you add the eggs to the butter mixture make sure you allow to blend till you are positive that they are fluffy, it will be very easy to under blend it.  <br>  Good Luck :)|`|TqGnv59gaa	to cream you're gonna use a mixer and blend it, but not a blender, its usually a Reference to combining sugar and butter, they want you to know the butter has to be soft (NOT MELTED OR MICROWAVED). When milk is removed from cows it sits and the cream rises to the top and is then removed, the cream is much sweeter than the milk thus creaming butter is replacing sugar or sweetness.|`|JxCCjH0Uaa	yes there is a difference...blend means to mix/add together, cream means to use egg beaters or a mixer(with the paddle attachment) to incorporate the ingredients into each other.|`|bd7388851727f8e5810b81c40752ffb1aa	Creaming usually involves butter or vegetable shortening to which sugar is added and then beaten so bubbles will form in the fat and act as like a leavening agent.  To that you can add your other wet ingredients such as egg and vanilla. Beat some more.<br>  <br>  To the wet ingredients, you add the blended dry ingredients and then try to blend only until it's fully incorporated (no more).<br>  <br>  Always bake in a Preheated oven.

HoHHpwDlaa	Hey Hey!<br>  <br>  So, there's a reason why some tobacco (shisha) gives you more of a buzz. Some are washed - a process where a lot of the nicotine and tar are "washed" out... and some are unwashed - where it's just straight up tobacco as is. <br>  <br>  So be on the look out for unwashed tobacco like Nakhla, Tangiers (not lucid line), & Ayam Zaman<br>  <a href="http://www.hookahpro.com/forum/showthread.php?t=8306&highlight=unwashed+shisha+brands" rel="nofollow">http://www.hookahpro.com/forum/showthrea...</a><br>  It looks like Ayam Zaman kincda kicks every other shisha out of the ball park (in regards to buzz)<br>  <br>  So.. it's not really up to the flavor, it's up to the BRAND. And no, changing the liquid in the base will do nothing for you. And i've heard from many people that alcohol and hookah dont mix very well together.<br>  <br>  Oh, and by the way.. for SOME reason i got a HUUUGE buzz off of starbuzz lemon mint. uggh.. i felt almost comatose and i couldn't hardly walk. haha. I guess if you're trying for a huge buzz, chain smoke that sucka. like smoke, then exhale, smoke, exhale, smoke, exhale. get it? make sure you're hydrated and have eaten! otherwise you're going to feel nauseous and get a killer headache. <br>  <br>  hope i helped!   :]|`|2c8MZxS4aa	For the strongest buzzes from shisha are Tangiers, Nakhla and Romman <br>  <a href="http://www.hookah-shisha.com/store/pc/viewCat_h.asp?idCategory=3&idaffiliate=284" rel="nofollow">http://www.hookah-shisha.com/store/pc/vi...</a><br>  In that order.<br>  <br>  Adding stuff to the base will rarely buzz you even vodka or some other high proof alcohol. It will alter the buzz, it won't be the same. Trust me I do it all the time it gives you more a alcohol buzz instead of nicotine buzz.|`|GHpS2oPZaa	whatever your smoking, whether it be weed or shisha - ( By the way, i'm used to smoking weed or weed crystal/resin through my bong or pipe I don't know what sheesh is)  - Exhale as much air out of your lungs as comfortable, then inhale entirely on the tube or whatever your using to get the smoke and hold the smoke in for as long as you can, when you inhale try to take as little oxygen in as you can because when mixes with the smoke it will just dilute the smoke and decrease what effects it may have...  and its doesn't hurt to cough a Little bit when your letting it out, to open the glands in your neck... some people get carried away and start coughing up blood. < hope this **** help buddie... but if your looking to get buzzed, i'd stick to weed.|`|9OjelayMaa	The hookah is the pipe you smoke it out of, not the tobacco. Learn your stuff before you ask your questions.<br>  And the tobacco isn't meant to be inhaled, it's there for the taste. That's why it's flavored.

NeTNnvSZaa	From Wikipedia<br>  <br>  A boysenberry is a cross between a raspberry and the Pacific blackberry. For a berry, this is a very large fruit (8.0g), with large seeds and a deep maroon color.<br>   <br>  In the late 1930s, George M. Darrow of the USDA began tracking down reports of a large, reddish-purple berry that had been grown on the northern California farm of a man named Rudolph Boysen. Darrow enlisted the help of Walter Knott, a Southern California farmer who was known as a berry expert. Knott hadn't heard of the new berry, but he agreed to help Darrow in his search for the berry.<br>  <br>  Darrow and Knott learned that Boysen had abandoned his growing experiments several years earlier and sold his farm. Undaunted by this news, Darrow and Knott headed out to Boysen's old farm, on which they found several frail vines surviving in a field choked with weeds. They transplanted the vines to Knott's farm in Buena Park, California, where he nurtured them back to fruit-bearing health. Walter Knott was the first to commercially cultivate the berry in southern California. He began selling the berries at his farm stand in 1935 and soon noticed that people kept returning to buy the large tasty berries. When asked what they were called, Knott said, "Boysenberries," after their originator. His family's small restaurant and pie business eventually grew into Knott's Berry Farm. As the berry's popularity grew, Mrs. Knott began making preserves which ultimately made Knott's Berry Farm famous.|`|AA11865915	Well if you believe Wikipedia I guess it was invented at KBF.<br>  <br>  According to them, a Boysenberry is a cross between a raspberry & a Pacific blackberry.<br>  <br>  I don't think I've ever seen any boysenberry product that hasn't been made by Knott's, just their jam and syrup (which I love; great on pancakes)

If you tell an adult he might get in trouble, but he will resent you and it won't stop him from drinking again.  <br>  <br>  Best just to keep this to yourself.  You can probably ask him how much or how often he drinks.  It might be less than you think, could be more.  As long as it isn't often then it isn't anything to be too concerned about.  Yes, you're both young and it would be better if you don't drink at 14.  But it is just how the world works, some 14 year olds drink and one of them is your friend.  Realize now you can't change others behavior and either keep the friendship or don't.  It's up to you.

64bdf8b2faefd496e5f2b6b5fbd6ecb7aa	L'ananas fresco, oppure il succo commerciale, ma che contiene almeno un estratto secco in altissima percentuale e zuccheri naturali (es. il PAGO) hanno i seguenti effetti:<br>  <br>  Metto la parola "blando" al posto della parola "naturale", ma gli effetti dell'ananas, in medicina sono rilevanti. Si puo' considerare a tutti gli effetti un "farmaco" naturale. Con effetti benefici tangibili ed effetti collaterali reali.<br>  <br>  - Antinfiammatorio blando tramite la bromelina, una sostanza che pero' va assunta FREDDA, altrimenti per uno strano processo chimico, non viene sintetizzata<br>  - IN SUCCO: Nutre e dolcifica ed e' ottimo come bevanda da pasto, senza un apporto significativo di calorie, a meno che non ci siano zuccheri aggiunti<br>  - IN POLPA E FRUTTA: dopo pranzo, tende a sintetizzare grassi saturi e monoinsaturi convertendoli in carboidrati, tendenzialmente, meno pancia e piu' energia e muscoli<br>  - E' ricco di vitamine<br>  - Il succo contiene blande sostanze anti-tumorali<br>  - Proprieta' mucolitiche, tende a sciogliere catarri catalizzati<br>  - Elevata presenza di vitamina C<br>  - Significativa presenza di vitamina A<br>  - Significativa presenza di sali minerali, tra cui iodio, magnesio, manganese, potassio e calcio.<br>  <br>  EFFETTI INDESIDERATI.<br>  <br>  - L'ananas puo' scatenare POTENTI e SIGNIFICATIVE ALLERGIE, in particolare reazioni cutanee, se dopo l'uso avete un'anomala comparsa di reazioni cutanee, arrossamenti, brufoli e varie. SOSPENDETE.<br>  <br>  - A causa di una forte componente acida, va rigorosamente evitato da chi soffre di ulcera peptica o recidive<br>  <br>  - Va evitata l'associazione ad anticoagulanti, in quanto la bromelina puo' aumentare il rischio di sanguinamento.<br>  <br>  Una ricetta sfiziosa:<br>  <br>  Prendete 5 fette di ananas e riducetele a tocchetti, frullatele con 800 ml di succo, 2 cucchiai di zucchero e tanto ghiaccio per 4 minuti. Servire la spuma in coppe e spolverate con cannella in polvere.<br>  <br>  Valori nutritivi per porzione:<br>  kcal 114<br>  Glucidi gr. 28|`|0b4d3b5fe73ca721a45b2a7b6659d7dbaa	penso bruci alcuni grassi....bo..mia nonna dice sempre cosi ma non ne sono sicura...cio bacio|`|43c74cf27f89a4cc03b7cf5cde313349aa	L'ananas fa' bene ai capillari per chi ha problemi con la vescica e fa' dimagrire e aiuta a eliminare la cellulite come vedi un toccasana.|`|CPuJJ2eIaa	brucia i grassi!! e poi contiene un sacco di vitamine!! e poi quando Ã¨ bello ghiacciato...magari in una giornata torrida...slurp k delizia!!|`|c7c4513b902aa74f2d7625c8b5a92162aa	elimina le tossine.... brucia i grassi... ma deve essere ananas fresco e nn quello inbottigliato o inscatolato!!!|`|3f15039da988a70f53cfba97f2e497b2aa	che quando Ã¨ bello fresco toglie la sete ..in quanto a prioprietÃ  dimagranti ho seri dubbi: per dimagrire bisogna mangiare poco e fare attivitÃ  fisica|`|DrWDBpPXaa	brucia i grassi|`|ZEAnjPIYaa	L'ananas Ã¨ un frutto di origine sudamericana, contiene la bromelina, cioÃ¨ un enzima lipoproteico utilizzabile come supporto nella cura di patologie quali lâartrite, lâangina e le infezioni dellâapparato respiratorio.<br>  Lâananas fresco inoltre Ã¨ ricco di vitamina C, di potassio e, nonostante il sapore molto dolce, Ã¨ anche un toccasana per le diete, contenendo pochissime calorie!|`|c9743f2abee4a111df6ec58bd9cd934daa	l'ananans contiene antiinfiammatori ergo..|`|eG6VVGPuaa	il succo d'ananas ha la paricolaritÃ  di esser composto per l'80 % da acqua elemento molto importsante per il funzionamento del nostro organismo.<br>  il nostro corpo Ã¨ composto dal'90% d'acqua e la richiede in grosse quantitÃ .Bere grosse quantitÃ  d'acqua fa si che il nostro corpo sia migliore.Nel succo d'ananas oltre che all'acqua Ã¨ presente anche grosse quantitÃ  di fibra elemento importantissimo per stabilire funzioni importanti nel nostro corpo.Bere questo succo da dei benefici come il miglior funzionamento dell'intestino e del fegato oltre che ha far apparire il nostro corpo in forma ed idratata oltreb che a facilitare l'eliminazione  della cellulite.<br>  Ã¨ indicato berlo in estate,aiuta la non sudorazione e rinfresca il nostro corpo dal caldo,la presenza di zuccheri non Ã¨ molto elevata ma regola la mancanza di essi.<br>  Lo puoi gustare freddo o unito a bevande alcoliche,infatti Ã¨ utilizzato per la preparazuione di drink.<br>  Ti consiglio infine di gustare principalmente il frutto perchÃ¨ hai almeno la certezza di mangiare un prodotto fresco e al naturale senza l'aggiunta di zuccheri o conservanti.|`|1759630df16fda19a8846799638d8673aa	Per esempio per il peeling.....<br>  Crusca e ananas.<br>  Unisci del succo d'ananas non zuccherato a qualche cucchiaio di crusca. Lavora il composto, amalgama per bene gli ingredienti, ed aggiungi un cucchiaio di sale fine; massaggia la pappetta ottenuta su viso e collo, con movimenti delicati e circolari. L'operazione deve durare qualche minuto per consentire alla bromelina contenuta nell'ananas di rimuovere le cellule morte; lavati bene il viso con acqua calda ed applicare della crema idratante.

tFoFchuEaa	Strawberry jam doesn't need ADDED sugar, as strawberries are already loaded with glucose, a natural type of sugar.<br>  <br>  While it's not bad for you, with the already high sugar content, you need to make sure you aren't going overboard. Check the dietary info on the bottle's label.|`|jBVtNmeQaa	Well it's not exactly 'Goood' for you, but it is certainly better than normal Jam which is primarily made up of white sugar which is in no way healthy and definetely a sugar/calorie overdose.<br>  <br>  The thing is even if it's '100% Fruit', You'll see that the fruit content is actually fruit sugar, Like fructose or something, so although it IS better sugar it is still very high in sugar, of course because what would a jam be if it wasn't sweet??<br>  <br>  So I would recommend the 100% fruit/ No sugar Jam because it still tastes the same, even better I think, and you still get your sugar fix but in a slightly more wholesome way.<br>  <br>  :-)|`|6fyFKbriaa	Regular jams are very high in sugar partly because of the natural sugar that develops in the fruit, in addition to the high amount of sugar you have to add. If you get store bought jam that says "no sugar added", it does not mean there is no sugar. Just that they didn't add sugar. Fruits produce a good amount of natural sugar and that is still in the "no sugar added" jam.|`|AA11402528	if its just fruit preserves, with no added sugar, only natural fructose, then yes..but that doesnt mean you eat the whole jar and think you had a serving of fruit lol|`|O0AfxH9Eaa	Ordinary jam is about 50 per cent sugar.

BMBFXXPmaa	Can easily make your own and freeze.  That way you know what is in it.<br>  <br>  Homemade Chicken or Fish Nuggets<br>  This was originally used for fish but I have also used it for chicken nuggets the same way, I just cook them a little longer:<br>  <br>  2 or 3 Tilapia filets (or 2 or 3 chicken breasts)<br>  1 egg (or 1/4 cup egg beaters)<br>  about 1/2 c milk (or non fat milk, I use powdered and make it extra rich by adding more powder to filtered water than recipe calls for)<br>  about 1/3 c parmesan cheese (grated)<br>  1/2 teaspoon salt (or to taste)<br>  1/2 teaspoon pepper (or to taste)<br>  about 1 cup bread crumbs (can grind up leftover bread, whole grain bread is good and healthy, and store extra in the freezer for future recipes)<br>  <br>  Preheat over to 400. Cut the fish (or chicken) up into bite size pieces. Put the bread crumbs, salt, pepper, and parmesan into a ziploc bag. Mix the egg and the milk in a good sized bowl and add the fish (or chicken) nuggets to the bowl. <br>  <br>  Take the nuggets out of the milk/egg mixture a few at a time and drop into the bag. Shake around until well coated and then place on baking sheet (you can grease it but I usually just line with foil). Do this until they are all coated and bake about 15-20 minutes depending on the size of your nuggets, slightly longer for chicken. They are good!<br>  ----|`|7cUDstdjaa	A lot healthier than fried or deep fried.|`|8lYZROjuaa	Many ppl eat them, but remember, most 'nuggets' consist of various parts of the chicken, unless stated all white meat, then it's normally still small scrap pieces thrown in together.|`|n1D90COxaa	absolutely as long as they are cooked all the way through.|`|mcWVZxozaa	depends on what's in em but yeah, there's less oil when u bake em.|`|AA11786341	sure|`|kggpvjdBaa	My little boy loves chicken nuggets.

Extra-virgin is what you get after the first press. "EVOO" has a light flavor and aroma, and is better used for dressing and dips than for cooking. Regular oil is the product of multiple presses, with a bolder flavor and stronger olive aroma. It's a good cooking oil for anything that's 'mediterranean' style. <br>  <br>  (I use it all the time when cooking Italian. Now if only they were easier to catch... )|`|20M2yA9eaa	Extra Virgin and Virgin Olive Oil means that the oil is from the first pressing of the olives to get the oil.   Regular olive oil is the stuff from the second, third and even fourth pressing of the olives.  So EVOO is more pure and light tasting.|`|479182125f393fcf9723202d1fa6b1dbaa	extra Virgin aside from being the first pressing of the olives also has no heat applied to it, which some of the lower qualities do to help extract the oils.

51c775e9cf5e74390036338ae882a3b1aa	Oil gets thicker in the fridge.  The label on the jar should clearly state how to keep them once opened.  That's why I buy them in bags, without the oil.  All you have to do there is put them in a container and keep them in a dry cool place once the bag is opened(I use them to cook original hungarian goulasch).|`|e407015b74d8a21bbc0484c41c8c9caeaa	They are still good when the oil hardens, it's completely normal for this to happen. You can either "thaw" them back out slowly at room temperature when you want to use them, or you can speed up the process in the microwave.|`|smr70o04aa	Simply take out the amount you want to use for your meal and leave at room temperature for awhile.

Rancid oil is definitely not good for you, but I haven't heard of it causing food poisoning symptoms. It's possible something else was wrong with the seeds (mold? bacteria?), but it could have been something else he ate that made him sick--even if you ate the same food.|`|FL75IFtmaa	They won't make you sick but they will taste a little off which will probably cause you to not eat them anyway. sunflower seeds that are yellow in color have usually gone rancid.

3bee646728de0b20b3be20d19b2483d6aa	I'm currently on a diet program through my HMO, and we eat a small meal every 3 hours (5 per day). Each one is about 200 calories, and you can have a 6th if you're up early and go to bed late.  The reason behind the every three hours is so you keep your metabolism up. <br>  <br>  They request that we drink 3 quarts of water per day, and exercise for a half an hour a day. The exercise doesn't have to be all at once, but they do want us to do a half an hour a day.<br>  <br>   I know this is a pretty low calorie diet, but it's working, and I am under a doctor's care and monitored constantly. It has brought down my blood sugar considerably and I have much more energy than I did before. I've also done a pretty good job of losing weight on this. I am eating healthier than I used to, as well. <br>  <br>  I hope this helped.

228ff8fc402414588b912da4f08839f0aa	Hola, soy de PanamÃ¡ y a continuaciÃ³n te cito alguno de nuestros platos tÃ­picos mÃ¡s conocidos, aunque te recomiendo que para encontrar la receta, te metas en pÃ¡ginas de cocina paname?a.<br>  1. Arroz con pollo: suena bastante bÃ¡sico, pero no lo es tanto. El arroz queda te?ido de amarillo, como una paella, sin embargo se hace con pollo y con caldo de gallina (cubitos maggi por ejemplo)<br>  2. Tamales: de maiz y rellenos de pollo... mmmm que rico...ademÃ¡s se acostumbra mucho comerlos para la navidad.<br>  3. Guacho de mariscos: mariscos y arroz en una combinaciÃ³n muy rica.<br>  4. carima?olas: es yuca, pero se amaza de cierta manera y se rellena de carne molida. Muy muy rico. AcÃ¡ ya lo venden listo para freir, sin embargo no creo que lo puedas conseguir en canarias.<br>  5. Patacones: esta receta te la doy yo. Compra plÃ¡tanos verdes y parte ruedas de aprox 2 cm de ancho y frielos en aceite bien caliente. Cuando estÃ©n empezando a dorarse, saca el  plÃ¡tano del aceite y, mientras aÃºn estÃ¡n calientes, aplasta cada rueda con una superfice plana (puede ser un frasco de aceitunas, por ejemplo) luego que estÃ©n todas aplanadas, vuelve a tirar las ruedas en el aceite hasta que estÃ©n doradas o saca uno y prueba que estÃ© crujiente. Listo, cÃ³melos con sal y disfruta.|`|AN36TZUVaa	en asturias es tipico el pan de boro?a,el arroz con leche y sobre todo,la fabada asturiana|`|KJAHbtyPaa	En LeÃ³n lo tÃ­pico es el cocido maragato, el botillo del Bierzo, la cecina ahumada, la sopa de truchas, los nicanores de Bo?ar, las mantecadas de Astorga y las roscas de San FroilÃ¡n entre otros.|`|bRKpVGsBaa	Que tema tan interesante|`|q2UMN3Rdaa	Aqui en Venezuela la comida tÃ­pica es la arepa muchos prefieren la reina pepeada que arepa rellena con aguacate, pollo y mayonesa.
