j9OUIki3aa	Your Own Booth at Winter Flea Market?:<br>  <br>  - Winter 21st – 11:50am – Rode into North Waffle Town entrance<br>  - Cutscene triggered<br>  - Mayor said, "Oh good you're here"<br>  - Then asked me if I wanted to set up a booth to sell some things<br>     that I didn't need anymore to make some extra money<br>  - There was no way to respond<br>  - Cutscene ended and I was back on my horse and still at the<br>    entrance<br>  - No other related anything when re-enter north entrance or<br>     talk to mayor on same day or Winter Flea Market day<br>  - 1st time you enter (Winter Flea Market/Year 1/Winter 22)<br>     - Town Square steps (& inside square) all decorated for <br>        flea market<br>    - Cutscene of Mayor in Town Square talking to resident<br>    - Then immediately another cutscene triggers<br>       - Elli is running (in square/East to West) and bumps into you<br>         knocking you down<br>       - She apologizes and then says, "Do you have a stand too? Or<br>         are you a just here to shop?" (grammar error included)<br>       - You wave your hands (speaking but no words displayed)<br>       - She says, "I see. I'm selling desserts here today. Please<br>         come by and check out my selection!"<br>      - You nod yes, both of you wave, she runs off towards booths,<br>         cutscene ends and then no other related cutscenes can be<br>         triggered no matter what you do or who you talk to including<br>         the mayor (even pressing A around any empty stalls)<br>  <br>  Conclusion: If in fact they had included this at some point then it<br>  has been decided against or taken out after the fact. Or it was<br>  something they were thinking of incorporating into the game but<br>  didn't finish.<br>  <br>  <br>  So, No, you can't sell stuff unfortunately,  but I heard you can on the new DS HM version.<br>  <br>  You can have 6 silkworms until you upgrade to a higher level coop.  <br>  <br>  Too many silkworms and birdies can be a real pain though to feed all the time!<br>  <br>  I think the power berry is the only bonus for getting to the 30th level of the mine.|`|dwVUIVZyaa	a) depends how many times you have upgraded your coop<br>  b) sadly no....trust me I've tried a BILLION times<br>  c) In the Ganache Mine you can fish: king fish, hachen, and crawfish (you can't fish the crawfish in winter but every other season you can)<br>  and in the mine in Mt. Gelato on the 50th floor you will automaticaly find the Shining Baumkuchen <br>  <br>  Hope this helps! I know i had to rely on sites like this all the time. =)<br>  GamersHell is a great place to look for these things!!|`|E2zdlYDhaa	the most worms you can have at one time really depends on the level coop you have, a level 1 coop can only hold up to 8 animals by upgrading it you can hold more animals, in your case more worms. an upgrade costs 4800G and requires 22 material stone and 22 material lumber. <br>  <br>  No you cannot sell things at flea markets, it is meant for players to get special items in each season, I think they should have made the game where you can open your own booth but sadly you cannot.<br>  <br>  The thing that is valuable on the 30th floor of ganache mine other then the power berry is the lake that you can fish in. I don't know what you can find there since i never tried fishing down there although i have been down there, the only REALLY special thing is the power berry. The lake could contain rare items as well so you never know <br>  <br>  ~hope this helps~
YOgs2ITFaa	Call of Duty 4 is an amazing game that I've spent days playing online. COD5 is basically the same thing, but I don't like it as much because the maps aren't as tactically though out. Killzone 2 comes out tomorrow, and that's probably going to be awesome. <br>  <br>  Best Bet------> Call of Duty 4
QWHpXlNCaa	all thee light blue and the closer orangs- they even cost more at a ticket place....that is one way to tell what the good seats are...just go to a place that sells tickets and ask for an alternative concert ticket...whatever seeat they are selling are the best sections...they pay folks to wait in lines at the main ticket sales facility and get the best sections to resell for profit...king of like scalpers but they pay taxes so it is legal for them.
28faeb718c3bfbe0b10b707965bb142baa	you're trading temporarily right? b/c trading fallout 3 for halo would be crazy with a capitol K<br>  <br>  halo will only take about 1 or 2 long nights to beat and has no on line play, where elder scrolls has hours and hours of game play, and is more like fallout 3, and is also newer so it will look a lot better|`|m2eHPeciaa	neither. halo is sick but im waiting for the new one|`|vtUqxX1Raa	Borrow halo, one of the greatest games ever made, Oblivion is equally amazing, but i considered halo as a new beginnign in video game history, the story was amazing, the gameplay was astounding, and the graphics, even though old, are still very impressive, even on local multiplayer i would have such an amazing time, i personally believe halo 1 is better than halo 3. Oblivion is ore of a long term game, endless gameplay, but it might take a while to get into dependign on your play style, dont expect to be walking around slaughtering everyone at level 1, you have to earn it. Very fun game, but unless you own it, you probably wont get the whole experience.

eIGAI8nDaa	dont care|`|AcARmgG1aa	hunter .|`|PBsshqAyaa	Lol. They're completely different classes. You shouldn't base your decision on what they "look" like (Hunters have sick armour too), or whether or not they have pets but if you enjoy their playstyle or not.<br>  <br>  I played a Warrior for a brief amount of time and didn't particularly enjoy it because it didn't really feel versatile enough (compared to other classes) for me, and being expected to tank in end-game content just sucked.<br>  <br>  Whereas with a Hunter you have a lot more control and could just focus on DPS in end-game. Which was a lot more enjoyable for me.<br>  <br>  It depends on your preference but if I was you I'd go for the Hunter out of those two choices.|`|w0ItLA3Maa	You should definitely be a warrior.  Although hunters can tame animals and have special bond with them, being a warrior gives you more opportunities to level up.  Warriors can do a lot of things better, and they are great at PvP.  I have a Tauren Warrior (lvl78) and a Tauren Hunter (61) and i leveled up my warrior so much faster.  I only play on weekends, so its not like I just focus on one. But definetly be a Warrior.|`|fDmRboaiaa	Warrior xD
YOgs2ITFaa	COD5's co-op is pretty good, but if you don't want to play that, i'd recommend Rock Band. I've played that game with my friends for hours on end, but if you specifically want a shooter, there aren't any good T rated ones.

After hooking everything up, restart the modem and router (if you use one), and a lot of times that helps.

It makes sense in a the Pirc is good sort of way.  (As king pawn player I had 0 fear of the Pirc, but 0-0-0 would be a new wrinkle.  The c6 is kinda Czech-Pirc.<br>  <br>  Is the plan to make the strong point d5 not e5.  You would castle behind that?  If you equalize in the center, white busts it open while your king is exposed.  Your king side fianachetto is pointing to attack the side your pawns are not pointing at.You had success with that?<br>  <br>  Maybe that is pearls before swine and I'm the swine.:)<br>  <br>  My advice is admittedly not great.  Abandon the Pirc except for shock value.<br>  <br>  Oh, at some point e5 needs to be played.  Or why fianachetto the king bishop if not to support an eventual e5 thrust.<br>  <br>  This might be bad advice from a guy who thought black needed a pawn presence in the center on move #1 (but plays the Alekhine:)).  <br>  <br>  Since you missed the window for e5 on move #1, do it now.:)  If d5 then c6 and let white try for and end game where the passed d-pawn is big but right now it is briefly isolated.  (The knight blocks c4 and white reaaaalllly wants to play that.)

sNE6qwAOaa	I was in Disney World in late March a few years ago, and I'll be honest with ya bro Disney World is busy all spring long, haha sorry but it's one of the most popular parks in the country.  The park is less busy during the week as oppose to the weekend, but there will still be some lines.<br>  <br>  What I would recommend is the "fast pass."  (I think that's what it's called).  It's some pass type thing that gets you to the front of the line every time.  I forget exactly how it works but they have tons of information about it throughout the park.  <br>  <br>  Anyways, be prepared for a few lines, but no matter how many people are there, it's a magical place and you'll have a great time.

I think your mistake is re-raise him the second time and call his bet on the river.  Basically, once he called your re-raise the first time, you know he has you beat.   Otherwise, he should fold.|`|sEPrpdY4aa	I think you made two mistakes.<br>  <br>  One was just calling pre-flop.  Even if you think he's hyperagressive, your A-4 off-suit is still fairly weak as a starting hand.  You either should have just thrown them away (I would have done that) or re-raised him if you felt he was trying to steal your big blind.  By calling, you  didn't really get any information about your opponent's hand.<br>  <br>  The second mistake was re-raising him on the river.  I'm not sure why you did that since you only had a pair of fours and he already demonstrated strength by putting out a pot-sized bet which should tell you that you were likely beat.|`|3Iyu7hrcaa	You could have just folded preflop, or, because of his image, raised preflop.<br>  <br>  But once that turn hit, you only have a pair of fours, and he could easily have that beat.  Once he calls the 24, what do you think he had?<br>  <br>  Obviously that Ace on the river made you call, what can you do at that point?|`|pAqfWJ8Haa	donky|`|c1fa93189fad57291cf2802937b455e2aa	Why would you even call for 4$ at first place on your big blind?

2d643fe2509c39d5e9d2affcc16d13bcaa	The whole idea of the free room/comps is to get you in the casino dropping your doe. Modern tech. has us pegged. You will get a card and be asked to put it any machine you play and show it to the pit boss whenever playing a table game. If you gamble any amount at all, I'm sure you will be covered. Ask when you go in. They just don't want people staying for free then going to other casino's n stuff. We use to take these "junket" flights from Seattle to Reno. They were free.. As long as you showed the 500 bucks when getting on the plane. Then you wore a name tag and you were watched how much you gambled ect. The casino chartered this plane.. So they wanted "Gamblers Only"<br>   Have a good time. With the economy the way it is, there is alot of competition for the gambling dollar. GL|`|YEooEeKGaa	you know the best thing to do before visiting vegas is to call all the casinos and ask them what the best comp they will give you is. esp if your planning on gambling anyway. you'll be suprised sometimes what they are willing to offer when you ring them up in person. its usually better than what they mail out. <br>  <br>  how much need to gamble depends on the comps but usually its not more than a few hours everyday. normally they do by the hours. <br>  <br>  i havn't been to vegas since the recession but i heard that with business drying up, the casinos are going nuts. so definitely try ringing around and im sure you'll get a nice suite and some shows :)|`|UVUYG5jaaa	yahoo can't answer that, only the manager of the casino can answer that
y02PZj22aa	You didn't ask for a pattern nor mention the gauge of the pattern you're considering. <br>  <br>  If you need a bulky yarn, I'd recommend Lion Brand Homespun.  My 2-year-old grandchild has slept with a blanket made of Homespun every night of his life, and it has been washed at least a hundred times, maybe two hundred times.  It washes well, it dries in the dryer, and it's soft.  Granted, it's starting to pill, but that doesn't matter to the grandchild!  <br>  <br>  If you want a worsted weight yarn, Vanna's Choice (also by Lion Brand) is a good choice.  TLC Amore by Coats & Clark is a worsted weight chenille yarn that does well for baby things.  And Patons and Bernat both make machine washable and dryable worsted weight yarns that will hold up for years of use with a baby.  I especially like Bernat Satin.<br>  <br>  For a sport weight yarn, I like Lion Brand Babysoft or Patons Astra. <br>  <br>  All of the above are acrylic yarns, so they machine wash and machine dry or hang to dry.  They are all soft enough for use with a baby, and they are all tough enough to survive life with a baby.|`|EcJvIQcfaa	Our members have hundreds of years of stitching experience and my personal experience is 50 years!  Hope I  can help.  I suggest you first recognize your skill level.  If you are just starting out, using baby sport or fingering yarn can be a challenge.  These yarns produce a beautiful lightweight to airy  (depending on pattern) finished item.  The lighter weight yarn can be a little harder for a beginner to use (like a child learning to write with a no. 2 pencil; usually the learner does better with a thicker pencil because it's easier to grip and control).  4ply, worsted weight yarn and sport yarns are usually used in making afghans.  It's perfectly okay for baby blankets, especially if you are making one that is crib size, or one you'd like the baby to use through childhood.  I agree with some of the suggestions you were given by others about yarn brands.  Caron Simply Soft yarn is great to work with, very soft, but it does tend to stretch more than I like to see in a blanket, especially when the item is large. Caron "Paints" doesn't seem to have this result.  It tends to hold shape better.  I love working with Vanna's Choice by Lion Brand.  It is uniform, has good substance and workability and has produced very acceptable mittens, hats and afghans for me and is a good value for the money.  I can say the same about Bernat yarns.  Red Heart is an old standby.  Their TLC is preferrable to the regular 4 ply worsted (it is a bit rough), but any yarn will soften up when machine washed and dried and softened with dryer sheets or liquid softener.  Remember, follow manufacturers' directions about laundering (I include them with the gift, and a lingerie bag for washing the item).  There is nothing worse than to spend time, energy and money to make a handmade item, and have it ruined because it didn't hold up in the wash!  Todays synthetic and some wools are made to be machine laundered, but it doesn't hurt to help a little by using a lingerie bag to protect the item from snags.  Even if the item isn't intended for long use by a baby, mom or dad may want to hold onto it for a keepsake and baby might want to use it again one day when she has a little one.  Another consideration is fiber content.  I recommend using only synthetic or cotton yarn (or blends) for babies.  Wools can involve allergies and nylon in a high content can chafe tender skin.  Good luck with the project.  Be sure to contact The Handiwork Ministry if we can be of help to you.  If you are buying your yarn at a yarn shop rather than a discount store or caraft store, you can get support for your work.  The store owner or manager is usually knowledgable in at least the basics of knitting and crocheting.|`|g7igZ4svaa	My favorite is Simply Soft made by Caron.  It comes in a good range of colors, as the name implies it is very soft, wash/dry well, and stands the test of time.  My best friend still has the one I made her son 13yrs ago and he keeps it on his bed when he's not using it, which he uses it quite a lot.  It still looks new.<br>  <br>  TLC made by Redheart is another good one.  I will use it if I don't find the right colors in Simply Soft.<br>  <br>  Good luck!  Hope you find what you are looking for and that your project turns out the way you want.|`|FJyLVazVaa	I always buy Red Heart and I always buy the softest I can find.|`|154dzJ1Faa	You do want a soft yarn, and there are many different kinds to touch and use.  You also usually want something a little finer, which makes for more delicate stitching, but does take a bit longer to make.  It's not as heavy either.<br>  <br>  You can of course, use a heavy bulky yarn, but it's not as useful in day-to-day use.  It depends if you are knitting, crocheting or weaving the blanket.<br>  <br>  I tend to prefer wool for a blanket; however, many mothers simply are too afraid of it, and don't know how to look after it (it's not very hard).  They want something they can toss in the machine with all the other baby things, and into the dryer as well.  You can use a synthetic (although it's not as good for the baby -- my opinion, of course) but they don't seem to hold up as well.  In any case, I'd avoid using the dryer unless you really have to -- that is what really destroys much of our clothing.<br>  <br>  Baby things really don't need to last for very long, so that may not be much of a concern.  However, if I am going to spend so much of my valuable time making something special, I want it to be around for a lot longer than I will be!  I will want to use the best material I can afford, and made to the highest standards I have.  That is only my opinion, of course, and you may have other thoughts.|`|4OjLMQ6Yaa	Vanna's Choice by Lionbrand is really soft. Moda Dea 100% washable wool is another favorite of mine.

qbmkMWqeaa	They don't make game systems, haven't for years. But they make games still:<br>  <br>  2002 would see a major shift in focus for Sega as it moved out of the console manufacturing business.[3]<br>  <br>  The company has since developed primarily into a platform-agnostic software company, known as a "third-party publisher", that creates games that will launch on a variety of game consoles produced by other companies, many of them former rivals, the first of which was a port of Chu Chu Rocket to Nintendo's Game Boy Advance.|`|2Q2ltt1Saa	Sega stopped making systems in 2002, when they discontinued production of the Dreamcast.

Plus, Sega's execs strongly believed there was only room in the video game industry for 3 successful consoles, and Microsoft had just jumped into the mix. So they stopped making consoles, becoming a third party developer/publisher. Shortly thereafter, their financial situation was so bleak that they slod themselves to Sammy, a sometimes video game maker who tended to focus more on pachinko machines.<br>  <br>  Since then, Sega has been making a few games and publishing a lot more, but giving most of their focus to the Wii.

82c09456498d17b7fdcbd55444c0d086aa	Lol. Same here. You probably started around the time I started.<br>  <br>  Draft is where you open a pack, choose a card, then pass the remainder to the next person on your left. You will receive a pile, choose another card, then repeat the process until you have "drafted" the three boosters. You will then build a limited deck from it, of 40 cards.<br>  <br>  I don't like draft. It's driven by bombs. It used to be fun, but now that there are Mythic rares in the format, it's all dependent on luck. If you open Elspeth or Sarkhan, you are set for the entire draft.<br>  <br>  Hope that helped!|`|S8BCApc5aa	Booster drafts are amazingly fun, and everyone should at least try them.<br>  <br>  Basically, you sit at a table with a number of other players (most draft tables have eight players total). Each player is supplied with three booster packs.<br>  <br>  Each player opens one of their packs, then takes any card in the pack (taking the best card is usually the best idea). You then pass the rest of the pack to your left. The person on your right will be passing you a pack, missing one card. Take whatever card you wish, then pass the rest to your left. You continue on doing this until each player has 15 cards. Then, the second pack is opened. You basically do the same thing, except you pass the pack to the right this time, and you'll recieve packs from your left. Then, when the second pack is done, you open the third pack, and pass to your left again, just like with the first pack.<br>  <br>  After you finish, you will have 45 cards. You then have to narrow down what cards you want to play. You have to build a deck of at least 40 cards, including land (you don't have to draft basic lands, you are allowed to use as many as you need, they're usually supplied by the tournament organizers). Once you finish, then you play opponents with the deck you've drafted and built.<br>  <br>  The strategy for booster draft is quite different than constructed. You basically need a mix of creatures (14-16 is a good baseline), other spells (7-9), and land (almost always 16-18 total) for your deck. Since creatures are the basis for draft decks, spells that destroy other creatures are at a high premium in draft. Games are almost always won or lost due to damage dealt by creatures, so good creatures help. You also want to make sure you are not playing too many "big" spells or too many colored spells that are difficult to support with your mana base, as you need the land to play anything you draw.<br>  <br>  There are tons of strategy articles out there on draft - it is an incredibly popular format. More importantly though, it is extremely fun, and gives you a chance to use so many different cards that never see the light of day in constructed. You have to be good at valuing cards, building decks, and playing to be good at draft - it teaches you a lot of different skills. Give it a try - anywhere that hosts drafts will usually have a number of players that can help you get started.

caOfuKl5aa	Don't ship it in it's original box, they don't want you to do that.  I recently had mine repaired & they tell you not to ship it in the original box.

In order to expedite this process, what they do is send you a refurbished console they repaired from someone else's problem & then yours will be repaired & given to someone else.  I don't like this b/c I sent mine in for a hardware problem & I'm sure I got someones refurbished RRoD.

Dso7k3sjaa	I haven't played the game in a couple of years, but there is one spot where you can use paintbrushes.  You have your character drop one but it doesn't actually fall all the way to the ground, then the character can step up on to it and drop another which falls slightly above and your character can step up on to that one -- making stairs out of the paintbrushes.  You'd have to look at a walkthrough though to find what part of the game has this, cause I just can't remember anymore.  Then, there's a couple of side quests which asks for a few odd items such as yarn or something.  But most of that stuff is just junk.  Hang on to the paintbrushes just in case but if you find a side quests that does ask for something else, you will be able to find the stuff easy enough anyway so you don't need to bother holding on to it.<br>  <br>  Here's a link where you can read about the Paintbrush "glitch":<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.gamefaqs.com/console/xbox360/code/927345.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.gamefaqs.com/console/xbox360/...</a><br>  <br>  I did use it once to climb up to something -- I think it was up north in the "frozen" section.|`|ryh5AslRaa	Not that I have found, I believe that those particular items are there just to add to the realism of the enviorment.|`|vWtucEFSaa	Those items are for looks.  Like decorating your house or something, if you want to make your character look like a painter or something.  They were put in the game primarily to make the game look more realistic.  You can sell them for petty gold at shops.<br>  <br>  If you really want, you can click in the right thumb stick while looking at the object, and you can actually move the painbrushes and brooms around that way.|`|mmavy34kaa	There isn't a PRACTICAL use for them through normal gameplay. However, there IS a glitch with the paintbrush. It floats in midair, good for building steps. Use your imagination and enjoy.|`|91qkEnkHaa	No you cant use those items there really kinda pointless in the game.
mmavy34kaa	As far as DOWNLOADING the game, thepiratebay.org has it.

Don't go over 15. Then you start at the letter C from crush.you write the tallys in the square.Lets say you had 7 tallys you start at c then count untill you go to something.If it goes to something like a friends name you cross it out.then you start from where you left off.count 7 . UNTILL you have only one of your friends name and one of your crushes name and one 1234 .( 1) and one letter from crash.The only one friend means that person is your friend for life, the only 1234 means thats how many times your going to kiss your love one.And the only crush is your love one. the only one letter you have in crash thats where you'll live . i hope you can understand this game!

Just to be on the safe side, buy the paste marketed specifically to repair cd/dvds. Many places like Gamecrazy also do these services in the store, though I haven't tried them. Also, if you look at the scratch and you can see light coming through to the bottom side of the disk, you might as well throw it away. You can't really repair a disk if the scratch actually damages the data storage layer of the disc.|`|511e806a702f7f4b678843ad2696165faa	Um.  NO.  This isn't good.  Take your disc to the local game store and have them clean it up for you.  It may cost a couple of bucks, but its better than ruining your disc and possibly your system.  Toothpaste is abrasive to discs, and this would just make tons of tiny scratches on its surface.<br>  <br>  There are actual disc cleaners out there that take small scratches out.  Just don't use anything that isn't recommended by the manufacturers.|`|IlpP4bMDaa	not on the ps3 itself lol<br>  <br>  but its ok on disks. it made my old sims 1 disk work
wkceLdVxaa	Actually in the Sonic Heroes manual, (lol who reads those?) it says hes fifteen and amy 12, and that was BEFORE his 15th Aniversary stuff.  people say he is 17 because Sonic has been around for that many years.<br>  <br>  But if we HAD to get all technical, a year on earth is one month in sonic's world...if you went by SonicX....<br>  <br>  i'd say, come up with ages that make you happy,like me.

wW2VFfsFaa	i switched from 360 to a ps3 and i really like the ps3 wayyyyyy better but the  pros and cons of 360 are the online is good and the marketplace is ehhhhh ok.. it depends on what friends u play with and what kinds of games u like. keep in mind halo 3 is the last halo.|`|pS08xbOhaa	First off...you probably should get the one w/ a hard drive as your going to want to save your files...the arcade one your planning to get comes w/ a small memory card (that includes the 5 arcade games)...<br>  <br>  PROS:<br>  Price...$200 w/o Hard-drive...$300 w/ HaDr (+2 games)<br>  Massive game selection<br>  Easy to navigate interface<br>  Up to 1080p (if your tv supports it)<br>  Online functionality (can easily communicate w/ friends)<br>  MultiMedia source<br>  Netflixs capability (if you already have an account...you can stream select movies/tv shows)<br>  LOTS of downloadable content (for disc games and arcade games)<br>  and lastly, for some...Achievment Points (adds some replay value to your games)<br>  <br>  CONS:<br>  Pay for online (but you can get 13 months for $39 from amazon) [Online is worth the money...trust me!]<br>  <br>  If you want to hook up your system wirelessly, you need to buy a receiver (retail $100, but you can find it cheaper OR just go wired, if possible)<br>  <br>  Hardware MIGHT breakdown..."Red Rings" but you can always get it replaced<br>  <br>  <br>  Its a great purchase...you will definately enjoy it...You can't really compare it to a Wii as the two are totally different...if your a "serious" gamer than the 360 is right up your alley...Great games, great graphics, great gameplay, and great online support/community.  As for the PS3...its a better engine plus the bluray but the game selection is a bit lacking (atleast for exclusives)<br>  <br>  BTW, you will LOVE Banjo...the game is totally worth (its the main reason why I got mine a little over a year ago when I heard it was going to come out on the 360).

(For $50 more, you can get the hard-drive).<br>  <br>  BTW - Microsoft fixed the RRoD breakdown people complained about the last few days, the new one is dubbed the "Jasper" and replaced all of the 360s.<br>  <br>  So, I would say go ahead and buy it, but if you plan on buying alot of games, and saving alot - I would scrape out $50 to save more memory.<br>  <br>  Hope this helps!|`|QiLw8X7Yaa	idk answer mine<br>  <br>  <a href="http://ph.answers.yahoo.com/question/index;_ylt=AgXiJGY180X1q0fiaHTwecyISAx.;_ylv=3?qid=20090226144829AADwpKw">http://ph.answers.yahoo.com/question/ind...</a>|`|rtV052yxaa	Pros-halo,gta4,xbox live,good games. cons-The red ring of death,its very loud.     is it an arcade version an elite or a pro?|`|Nuu5zUWuaa	pros=better than a wii by far<br>  cons=you will be adicted to the games|`|o7RX8Wzeaa	Pros: BEST online gameplay.

7M67mMToaa	Granite Shield, Not only doe sit Req 50 defense to wield it. It also has good stats and one of the best range attack bonuses of any cheap shield.|`|iQU2j6quaa	Get 65 attack and 65 strength. Go to the warriors guild and kill cyclops. Get a rune defender, its +5 strength bonus aswell as defence and attack bonuses. It is way better then a granite or rune kite when you are meleeing. But if you want to tank range or something use a granite shield. Hope i helped. Good Luck|`|flQdzZVUaa	Well i would say that the rune kiteshield is better than a granite shield because it cost less and a granite shield does have better thats but it weighs a lot more... I would say you should get a rune defender because it gives attack bonuses and you wouldn't need that much defense. <br>  <br>  So over all id say rune kiteshield is better at weight and price|`|85K9nMq8aa	The granite shield is better at defending against arrows, but is incredibly heavy, costs way more, and is the worst shield for magic and ranged users.|`|0YjcA2soaa	rune

tVOPEDvxaa	It's nearly impossible to tell from a photo what kind of rocks they are. Some look like various forms of agate and some appear to be Apache Tears (a form of obsidian).  Have you tested the hardness?  Also, rocks don't get smooth from being in the water.  They are smoothed by being abraded by smaller particles.  Is the marsh near a beach?  If not, it's possible the area used to be part of a stream or near an ocean.  Or, they may have been left there by someone who had either collected them from a beach or discarded them after having them in a rock tumbler. <br>  <br>  Until each rock is identified, it's difficult to say where you might find a market for them.  Try local beading guilds or bead shops.<br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|TyqGdBw1aa	it depends... i'm a flintknapper so i make tools and weapons out of flint. and i'm a blacksmith so i have to know my rocks (because some may contain iron) and i'm a mason so i use chisels and hammers to shape ordinary stones. <br>  if you found them near a river or the beach they're just ordinary river or beach stones. they're shiny because they've been eroded by the elements, mainly water and sand. most likely it's a mixture of calcium, silt, sand, and dirt. you can make jewelry out of them but they aren't gems and when they're likely to break.... take a hammer to your least favorite one... if it's grainy on the inside it's an ordinary stone. if it's a mixture of grains and shiny flat pieces it's a got minerals in it. but if it has cleavage meaning that it breaks off into square pieces instead of jagged or crumbled pieces it's more likely a precious stone... not highly valuable though<br>  wear goggles when you break them open|`|5Xmbd6RVaa	There are A LOT of possibilities. First you need to look at the information on rocks and minerals found in your region, then you need to examine color, texture, striations, and so on... it's pretty complex. You can take them to a jeweler and see how much they would charge you to inspect them. Chances are really good they are some sort of quartz though to be honest. Do you have any pictures of them?|`|JpvX0ZY2aa	They are most likely opal or obsidian stones,|`|61Ljkupjaa	I studied these in college they are gout crystals.|`|1hciyvKdaa	Pics please or area, state county or country region??|`|cxnJtmJraa	I can't tell for sure, because the pictures of individual stones are very small and of poor quality.  I can tell pretty much for sure that you have a lot of quartz.  Those will be minorly, if small or thin enough, transparent and come in a variety of colors.  For the most part though, white or sometimes pink.<br>  <br>  While there may be obsidian in your set, it depends on if you are in a volcanic area*[1], it is incredibly unlikely that you will find any opal.<br>  <br>  1.  it does look like you might have a few pieces of snowflake obsidian, which is one of my favorites

NG40UnGbaa	I've always used 7. I don't like the standard five minutes used by Madden because most normal NFL games consist of at least 50 offensive plays (right around 20 or so rushing, 30 or so passing by average) and there is no way to get that many plays out of the 20 minute games, especially if you're a running oriented kind of team. The other problem is how quickly your two minute warnings seem to come up, or at least that has always been very annoying to me.<br>  <br>  I've tinkered around with it for quite some time, and have seen that 7 seems to get about 50 or so plays per team. Of course, if its a blow out or a lot of turnovers on one side someone will get more than that, but that's also more realistic.|`|qEkPcK9gaa	5mins after  5mins it gets boring trust me<br>  <br>  -Meeks aka Hands0me Hustla|`|NkYWScEdaa	Pause the game, get some friends together, and go outside and play football, not virtual football, real football|`|uSPxe2Bbaa	6 minutes|`|mFcLkyudaa	If I have a lot of time, I'll play five minutes per quarter.

2Q2ltt1Saa	Any graphical MMO is going to have large patches when it updates, so either the content is going to be stale if they don't patch regularly, or you'll have to deal with patching.  (Major WoW patches are generally 1gb or so but only happen every 2-3 months or so.)  If you have friends that play, they could burn a copy of the downloaded patch for you as well.<br>  <br>  However, you'd still have a lot of downloaded data going back and forth to the server, no matter what MMO you play.  If you try something non-Flash that's web-based (Kingdom of Loathing ( <a href="http://www.kingdomofloathing.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.kingdomofloathing.com/</a> ) or text-based MUDs, for example), you'll probably have less issue.|`|Sy67CP1Zaa	Well most of the good MMO's require that you download patches.

Some loops are smooth as silk while others might jar you a bit. They are not scary however, just a sensation that you are being flung around upside down and then back to normal. <br>  <br>  If you want to de-virginize yourself with a loop effect, try California Screamin in Disney's California Adventure. The coaster itself is a blast and the single loop the ride has is very pleasant.|`|6Xf0wOgPaa	It happens so quickly you don't need to worry...<br>  <br>  I don't think it feels like a flip because your whole body is staying in the same position. <br>  <br>  It can't get stuck because of the actual physics of a Roller Coaster Loop.<br>  <br>  You have more chance of breaking down on a chain pull when you first start the ride.<br>  <br>  There is only one way to find out and I'm sorry but it's the hard way......you have to get on with it. I don't think us saying what it feels like can really make you feel any better.|`|vDp62eS1aa	It's not going to get stuck, and you won't pass out.

S4X8zOUoaa	Using the same number does increase your chances of winning, unless you pick a number that is more likely to win. This pretty much applies to any game.<br>  <br>  Lets say that there are four numbers you have to pick. Each has 10 possibilities (0-9) so your chances are 10^4, or 1 in 10000. If you picked a different number each time, your chances of winning would be 10000^10000, because not only does the right number need to win, you need to pick the right number.<br>  <br>  Therefore, if you stick to the same number (assuming they all have an equal chance of being picked) then you will win sooner than if you constantly switch. (According to percentages, it is of course still a game of luck)|`|b540a7523d1dcc08713923926477aef5aa	I think there are the same odds no matter what number you pick, but think about this.  If your numbers came out one day and you didn't play them... you'd never know.  If you are happy with the numbers, keep playing them.  Another thing you could do, look up past winning numbers.  Make sure your set of numbers didn't come out already because those odds are very rare that the same set would come out twice.  I'd not play those numbers again.|`|67BjmuWUaa	Increase your chances of winning by using Raven's Lucky Numbers.<br>  I incorporate numerology, astrology, and native American spirituality.<br>  I have a complete dream dictionary, talisman and daily picks based on astrology all for free! check out Raven's Lucky Numbers: <a href="http://www.luckynumbersonline.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.luckynumbersonline.com</a>|`|3Iyu7hrcaa	I think the above poster is correct, other than he makes no sense.<br>  <br>  It doesn't matter.

l6lh6fT8aa	Regenerating a creature (or permanent, as the case may be) does not send it to the graveyard.<br>  <br>  What regeneration does is put a "shield" on a creature when used. This "shield" is then "used up" the next time the creature regenerates (multiple shields can be put on at the same time, and they will be "used up" separately). <br>  <br>  When a creature regenerates, all damage is removed from it, it is removed from combat, and it is tapped. And a "destroy" effect is nullified, if it applies. <br>  <br>  During a turn, you can regenerate as many times as you want, provided you have a repeatable effect. And the resources to pay the cost for that effect. (Or a "permaregen" creature like Mossbridge Troll).|`|sVPjp3dUaa	The creature does not go to the graveyard. During the damage dealing step, a creature dealt lethal damage would normally die and be put in the graveyard. Regeneration 'clears' the damage after the damage is dealt & prevents the creature from going to the graveyard. Since it did not go to the graveyard, you don't gain life from it.|`|evB63qWvaa	No.  When you regenerate a creature, it never technically goes to the grave yard.  It dies, and you bring it back before it hits the GY so there would be no life gain.  I hope this helps.|`|i9V7t3pRaa	Its been years since I played, but I would think the critter has to be put int the graveyard before he can be regenerated.  I am sure you could find the specific answer to this question, but just doing a google search.

On Rock N' Roller Coaster ?, it's speedy, you hardly notice the loops on it, so you'd be fine. <br>  <br>  Expedition Everest is great, too. It's cool how it runs backwards, I think you would be fine on that one,too. <br>  <br>  Space Mountain is fast, and it's great. It doesn't go upside down, but it is in the dark. So you know, if it could possibly freak you out, I think you should have like a friend or family member (that you trust) and ask if they think it would go on the ride and if they do (or did) ask if they think you'd enjoy it, or try to watch it on youtube.  ?|`|Yy1iO8XSaa	space mountain: it only goes up to 23 mph.  Relax.  It's a really interesting ride and you shouldn't let your fears from going on such a ride.<br>  <br>  Rock N Roller coaster: it's dark so you really dont see the track which helps you because you dont get scared of what's coming next.  it all went by in a blur.  very fun.<br>  <br>  <br>  Expedition Everest: You should atleast go on this once.  It's a family ride just a fast family ride.  You learn a lot and it's probably the best ride in walt disney world in my opinion.|`|XwGgzXeuaa	space mountain is so amazing<br>  i was scared to go on it but i went anyways as the ride started i was scared of the bast off part but it was really cool after that the ride was dark with stars it was so amazing. so recommended|`|n9PToQLMaa	those r all fun

z4otPT6maa	Hi, first i say it's probably best to just spend the $2 bucks on the hook that's called for (especially for a beginner). Honestly if you enjoy crocheting than I'd say get ALL the hooks so you can easily adjust a project without having to run to the store when your feeling inspired... Either way you need to do a test swatch, there is usually a reference to it in the beginning of the pattern, such as 3 st = 1inch or something like that. So when you do your swatch with any hook and/or yarn you should have 3 stitches =1 inch. Cast on about 25 sts and make about 15 rows, then you get a ruler and without pulling flatten the swatch and see how many sts = 1 inch.So if you're getting only 2 sts =1 inch, you can use a thinner yarn or smaller hook.  4 sts =1 inch a thicker yarn or larger hook. I know its confusing in the beginning but keep at it you'll get the hang of it! I hope this helps. Also a great reference  book that is well written and even has a sense of humor as well as awesome patterns is The Happy Hooker by Debbie Stoller. I'm mainly a knitter but this book inspired me to try crochet. Good Luck! Keep on stitchin'!  **Also I am starting a web site cult9design.com , selling all original art to wear and share.  If you want to submit something please do!|`|QEkznIewaa	Buy the larger crochet hook. Go to Wal-Mart and get the crochet hook for 2 dollars. First of all, the pattern cannot be changed to fit that size hook. Second, if you could change the pattern it would be sooo much work you would be wishing that you went and bought the hook. Good luck!|`|154dzJ1Faa	You don't choose the size of hook for the size of item to be made, but the hook must be the right size for the yarn used.  If you have a smaller hook, then you need a finer yarn.  If you were to follow blindly the pattern as written (and who really does?), you are going to make something smaller than you intended.  So you need to make adjustments to the pattern if you plan on anything fitting.<br>  <br>  It's the combination of hook, plus yarn, plus number of stitches that make the size of an item.  And the first two are inter-connected, going hand in hand.<br>  <br>  Thanks for the pattern, but be careful about copyright laws if you are copying it in its entirety.|`|y02PZj22aa	Unfortunately, the G hook is *way* too small to make that hat with either the worsted or the bulky yarn, and it's not going to look the same made up in sport-weight yarn, even if you add enough stitches to cover the same size.<br>  <br>  Two suggestions:  <br>  <br>  Buy the bigger hooks.  I just bought a set of five larger hooks for around $7.  If money is super tight, check with the local thrift shops.  Or, and this is a serious suggestion, check with any charity yarn-using groups in your area.  My church's knitting group has a huge box full of both knitting needles and crochet hooks that were donated to us when someone died or moved into assisted living and quit doing handwork.  We would happily "sell" any of them for, say, a canned food item for the food drive.<br>  <br>  Or use a different pattern, one that's designed for the smaller yarn and hook.

BTkUHEdzaa	i collect them!!!|`|XIJHHAAwaa	I used to collect the Ty Beanie Babies and the Plush (which I believe were later re-named 'Classics'). I also remember 'Buddies' (the larger versions of Beanies), but my favourites were the 'Attic Treasures' range. I managed to collect almost every one that they ever made before they stopped making them. I only have a couple left to get and hope that they will come up on Ebay one day. If you look on www.ty.com you can see lists of all the Ty ranges currently available including the Pluffies.|`|HgxRrkABaa	No of course not i collect them a lot seriously its not shameful i  collect em and i have no problem.

vDGFRACaaa	Sometimes hitting the number keys (1, 2, 3, etc) will turn off or on Frames on an Emulator. Smoke would probably be frame 3 or 4, but try all of them.<br>  <br>  1: Foreground<br>  2: Foreground<br>  3: Effects<br>  4: Effects<br>  5: Sprites<br>  6: (Turns on all Frames)
3qZ4SQROaa	Pull-Down Restraint. When you are going up (on the ride) you sometimes feel like you'll just fall out, but of course you never do. (In my opinion) besides feeling like that, it's a fun ride!|`|AA10556592	just a pull down restraint

wYR9KgyIaa	I included a how-to guide on Animal Crossing photos. If you scroll down a few posts, Spellman explains how you can also save pictures without an SD card. However, you do need an internet connection. I hope this helps!|`|c231bbpTaa	Unless you save your photos on an SD card then you can only view the one you just took. Once you take a picture it erases the last on you took. If you save it on an sd card then you can go to the photo channel on your wii and view any you saved on there.
7fX5te3maa	I heard the Mythic Map Pack will be released March 31st, but its not likely. I've also heard its likely to be sometime in April.|`|BV8ZzM6iaa	They haven't said when the standalone download is coming out so that's why I'm buying Halo Wars, two games in one ftw.

Most likely their server has crashed or they are down for maintenence and my best suggestion would be to wait it out. They'll fix it sooner or later. If it makes you feel better i'd suggest logging a ticket/e-mail (or whatever they call it) to the bug reports section of Yahoo!Games.|`|zoSi8gUSaa	The server is down for maintenance
Rx8U8eVnaa	No but if you email me I will try to go on one day soon and give you all my stuff and money becasue I don't use mine anymore.|`|x7FjDcjzaa	3j4424kh424k|`|wjA9ytO0aa	jds8soa0203|`|Qi6ngRrQaa	fhg5f54hffdffght|`|9ocKwWvFaa	Why, why, why do people INSIST on asking for free stuff on random video games?
