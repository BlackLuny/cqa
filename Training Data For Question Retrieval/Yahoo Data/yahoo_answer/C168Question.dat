20090223155208AAiP6c1	Pregnancy & Parenting;Pregnancy	Which is more likely with this pregnancy?	Okay so i am a little anxious. i do have a doc appointment with an ultrasound in two days.      i had what i thought was a miscarriage at around 4-6 weeks i mean clots, heavy bleeding it was period blood not anything else. my husbands sister (obgyn) told me that if it was how i said it was then it was a miscarriage and i should go to the doctor. i didn't (i know not smart)      well about two-three weeks ago i started feeling pregnancy symptoms again. they had stopped completely after the period/miscarriage.      since the period/miscarriage i haven't had a period. took a pregnancy test a week or so ago and it was positive and I'm going to the doc on Thursday but I'm just very anxious and i cant find this answer anywhere online.      its either 13 weeks or 8 weeks.   what do you think?   that five week difference is making me crazy.   (we use condoms but i know how effective those are! hah.)          thanks!

I have an Appt. for an ultrasound 2/24 But, I was just wondering if anyone else has gone threw this ? Severe uterus cramping,Pain on the right side,Sore breasts, sensitivity to smells,urinary freq. Etc. I basically feel like I'm pregnant, I've looked it up online and it says that this can happen. I had spotting non stop since i had the iud put in 5 months it finally stopped about 2 weeks ago. I had My annual pap at that time and told the midwife about the pain, She said i could have thrown an egg, Or it could be scar tissue pain. I really dont think that is the case because with my 1st pregnancy My Dr. really did some damage and i was always in pain until with my 2nd c-seaction when My new Dr. fixed everything, This pain does not feel the same. Anyway i guess i want to know if anyone else has experianced this, My Dr. would like to know if i want the iud removed. I'm not sure what to do. & they dont tell u what u should do. PS. I took a First Resp. Test Sunday and it was neg.

Of course my parents went for it because it last for 5 years and I cant get pregnant (they are big on the teen pregnancy, esp. since i have friends who have kids) My doctor said even though I haven't had a child, im still in a monogamous relationship (i only have sex with one guy) and im now on it.

20090223163946AAbTuMp	Pregnancy & Parenting;Parenting	Rewards for 6 yr old?	We do a reward "lottery" that she can earn at the end of every month. She reaches into a covered can, and picks a paper that has a prize.       What we are using so far: Trip to the movies (rare), rent a movie, toy from $1 store, toy from walmart (rare), ice cream cone, picking dinner night (she almost always picks Chinese lol)       We ran into some problems though.  Picking just a toy from walmart means setting a limit on cost (otherwise she'd ask for DS or something), and if we do set a cost she feels "cheated" if she doesn't spend every penny of it.  Meaning if she gets $10 limit, but finds a toy for 8, she walks around freaking out about spending the last 2 dollars. It turned into a hassle so we thought about just taking that option out in general.         We also thought about instead of  just any toy from walmart, splitting it up into different things.   Like barbie, hot wheels, LPS, a book (she likes books too) etc.   But I wonder if that sorta keeps her from picking what she truly wants.        What do you think?  And can you think of any other prizes we could add that do not cost a lot of money and are not just "toys"?

20090223162622AAltJxQ	Pregnancy & Parenting;Pregnancy	Am I really pregnant or is it something else?	Hello every1, I am a 26 yr old who is very confused at this point about what's goin on with my body. Ok, 2/5/2009 was my mens started and ended on 2/10/2009. I had intercourse on the 11, 12, 13, n of course 14. I checked my ovulation calender & those dates r 15 - 19. Now lately I've been having prego symptoms but don't believe it bcuz people say u can't have symptoms this early on. Starting on the 16th, I had very light cramps which lasted for about 3 days. I felt pinchin sensations near my naval on the 19th. I've had hot flashes, really bad headaches, fatigue, sweaty palms n feet (sweat only lasted 4 1 or 2 days), I feel hot most of the time which is weird, just yesterday my bb's became heavy n sometimes soar. They felt the worst when I first get up in the mornin or just wakin up from a nap, to the point where walkin hurt them. Now u might laff at this, I crave cheese, I ate oatmeal n porkchops 2gether (as if that's a normal meal) lol, I don't like the taste of chocolate n e more, and from time to time I have this very disgusting taste in my mouth which is sort of bitter but also tastes like im lickin on the back of a rusted iron, if that makes n e sense lol. I've been drinkin a lot of water but find myself constipated 2. Right now ur prob thinking, "when is she gonna shut up" lol. But there's more... I cry at EVERY LITTLE THING, my moodswings r horrible. Just about everything my bf does annoys me to the point where I just lashout at him 4 no reason. Im gonna take a HPT on friday but im scared of what the results might be. Right now, I wanna know what u moms or moms to be think b4 I pull my hair out, lol. I've got my fingers crossed.

My partner and I are trying to get pregnant, insemination occurred on  days 11 and 12 of my cycle, and I ovulated on day 13 early afternoon. Now it's 16 and I'm slightly nauseous, have this sort of dull yet sharp pain on the left side of my abdomen (ovulation pain was on the right), and I'm a bit dizzy. To my understanding I'm supposed to ovulate only  about 7 days after ovulation - is it possible that what I feel is implantation just 3 days after ovulation - or is it all in my head because I want to get pregnant so much??? Thanks!!!!!

20061230043045AA1xsW1	Pregnancy & Parenting;Pregnancy	Pregnant and Terrified?	September 29, I had my stillborn son at 21 weeks pregnant. He had a fatal skeletal dysplasia. A month later (october), I wind up in the ER becuse I'm hemmoraging. November comes, so does my period. Almost had to go back to ER as I was bleeding so heavy. So yesterday was supposed to get my period. Nothing. Just on a whim I took a home test. Positive. So I took another one. Again positive. Called my husband in tears. I am so scared. I can't lose another baby like I did with my son. Looking at everything my uterus has been through these last three months, I'm scared that even if this one is healthy, I'm not physically strong enough to carry full term. I lost my son exactly 3 months ago yesterday and I find out I'm pregnant same day. This wasn't supposed to happen, not until we got all the test results back from our son. In fact, I had planned on going back on b/c this weekend. I am so scared. Any advice?

After ejaculation, how long on average does it take enough sperm to actually reach an ovum in a fallopian tube?  I know sperm can lay in wait, healthy, for up to five days in the tubes, but how long did it take them to get there in the first place?  I read in a medical report that sex any time after ovulation, even immediately after, doesn't allow enough time for successful fertilization before the egg disintegrates so it just got me wondering how long it takes for the sperm to travel.  I haven't been able to find that info anywhere for some reason.

But I wouldn't have been able to tell on a test just a week later right? Cuz the baby doesn't even implant its self until like 6 to 10 days and I wouldn't think the hormone levels would be high enough even for an early test. Also I had already missed a period. My LMP was May 8th. Wouldn't that make me like 10 weeks?      I think my DR might be a twit. He was off with my first child and always forgot who I was.

20081012134750AAXUA2F	Pregnancy & Parenting;Pregnancy	Why are people so judgemental?	Why do people feel they have the right to judge, not knowing all the details?? Yes, I call my son MY son. The father is NOT involved and I have had no emotional or financial support so far in my pregnancy from him, which is WHY I'm on Medicaid ONLY... No state handouts. I've had complications and my Dr. even thought I had lost my baby at one point.      Yes I am a young mother (to be) but that doesn't mean I can't love him, raise him correctly, or provide for him. Yes my parents are helping, but its because they WANT to, not have to.      No one but the father and I know what happened that night, if protection was used or not (which it was).      So why are people so jugemental???      Sorry I just needed to vent some!!

20081024102335AAzk9pR	Pregnancy & Parenting;Newborn & Baby	My little baby boy and his lopsided head .. ?	 He is 3 months old and his head is still floppy. He gets a 1/2 hour of tummy time a day (broken up obviously) and he does ok with it. He just started pushing up on his arms and really lifting his head. But his head is still floppy when you hold him. Its almost like he looks down, its weird.  He does have a big head so I'm sure that's a contributor. LOL! I just never had this problem with my 4 yr old so I don't know if this is normal of not. This isn't something I would "rush" him to the doctors for so I figured I'd ask you mommies. And please don't reply with " all babies develop at their own pace"  as I know this. I'm looking for answers from people with experience with this.  Thanks!
20071003191800AAoCB7m	Pregnancy & Parenting;Pregnancy	Possible miscarraige?	i have been wondering if i had an early miscarraige last month.  i had brown spotting two days before my period started which is not normal.  And then when my period actually started it was heavier then normal and there were a few clots on the first day which is not normal either.  It lasted the normal 5 days.  i also remember having bad cramps before hand.  i'm not pregnant this month either unfortunatly but this period came like normal but far less uncomfortable (cramps) then normal as well.  So anyway do you ladies out there think it is possible that i did have a miscarraige last month?

Ok like i thought i was in labor two days ago like i was getting contractions but they were irregular but i was still getting them and they were kinda hurting so i had called the doc earlier that day and i went in at 3:30pm that afternoon to see him and he checked me and was like no your not dilating and your cervix is still hard but he wrote me some medication to stop the contractions called terberthelane(Brethene) and said hey in 6 hours if you are still getting the contraction go to L/D so at like 2:00 in the morning i was still getting the contaction and when i got there the nurse checked me and said that i was dilated to 2 cm well like my doc comes in later that morning and says take the (Brethene) every6 hours and he wrote me a perscription for another medication it started with a P i dont really remember what it was call but im sure someone knows what im talking about anyway last night we got into an argument and he said that he got pissed off at me because we took a drive to the hospital that wasent needed and we were there so long like he tried to say that just becasue i wanted to go because i was getting contraction it was my fault and we should have just stayed home and i asked him well what if i would have been in labor then what he didnt say anything so then i said well atleast i know next time that when i am in pain not to tell you a damn thing because it may not be the real thing ok i dont know what to do (he thinks that the whole thing was unnessissary but i say look its better than me being in labor and staying at the house right) what should i  do or say ( then he said your werent even getting real contraction they were just b/h ) dont braxton hicks contractions turn into real contraction or is this just me how can i explane this to him?

20081024102305AArnlec	Pregnancy & Parenting;Toddler & Preschooler	Parents! Help, My 3 year old is peeing all over the house?? Is this regression normal?	He's been potty trained for some time, AT LEAST 6 months potty trained, been fully potty trained (poopwise) for about 3 months.       In the past month or so, he has been peeing all over the carpet in his bedroom in different spots, on MY BRAND NEW COUCH, the coffee table, pees his pants on occasion. Never in front of me, I always "find" it, or he comes to me with wet underwear and tells me he has to pee. He gets upset or scared when I get a little mad or upset about it. I've tried talking to him about it. I've tried not getting mad, I 've tried getting mad, I've tried making him clean it.       I know for a fact one time was on purpose because he was wearing underwear, went in his room while I was doing something (washing dishes), pulled his underwear down, peed all over his bedroom carpet, pulled underwear back up and then came and said " Momma I peed all over carpet" and he was as dry as could be! I'm not sure if the other times were on purpose or accident. I just don't know because I never catch him doing it.      Is this normal for 3 year old to regress this way?       How would you suggest I handle it? Should I be getting mad or should I try to stay really calm? Thanks for any help or advice       -and please be kind! NO MEAN INSULTS about my child I know how some evil trolls who come through can be on here, telling me to put his nose in it or beat him with a 2x4 or something...so not happening so any USEFUL advice would be great =)

I usually get bad cramps during my period but I am nowhere near it at the moment. These cramps feel different, they're in my stomach, lower stomach and also shooting pains from my vaginal entrance up into my stomach area, not as bad as the ones I get on my period. I know this can be a sign of preganancy but it's only been 4 days since I had sex so I'm thinking thats far too soon to be experiencing any symptoms. Just a weird coincidence?

When it was very quiet, I became concerned and went looking for them. I found my 5 year old daughter and her 4 year old girl cousin both naked. I asked what they were doing and my daughter said she was scared to tell me. I forced the issue and she finally said they were "doing sex."      I asked her what that meant and she said she didn't know. Then, pressed, she said they were naked laying on top of eachother. I freaked...I totally lost it!       I can deal with the normal child curiousity (I wish I had thought about this before) but now what do I do about my horrendous over-reaction? My child will now be terrified to tell me anything. I freaked out so bad that both the girls were hyper ventillating they were bawling so hard. I went on and on and on about my disappointment and blah blah blah...   A few hours later in a feeble attempt to "fix it," I told her that I was more upset by the fact that she wouldn't tell me what she was doing.      Now, what can I do to assure my child isn't scarred by my reaction for the rest of her life? Any advice?
20080929173736AApSbMT	Pregnancy & Parenting;Toddler & Preschooler	Is my son's daycare pushing him too hard?	He is not even 15 months old, but they expect him to take walks while holding hands with other children without crying.  They also say he shouldn't still be falling down when walking on flat surfaces, but he still walks a little clumsily.      He is very tall for his age (>95 percentile), so I figure his muscles might just need to catch up a little.  He also just started daycare a couple of months ago, so I think he is still getting used to others telling him what to do.

Well, my question is, since dr's determine your due date by when your last period was, how will they be able to figure mine out? I haven't had a period since July and I KNOW I'm not that far along yet. Just wondering if anyone else has gone through this same thing!

20081025213402AAMLHhZ	Pregnancy & Parenting;Grade-Schooler	I don't know how to talk to my six year old about his behavior?	So earlier I made a post about what i found on my cell phone. Something I didn't explain was that I let my six year old son play games on my phone some times, or I let him talk to his father. Well i was going through my videos and i saw that he had video taped his privates while he was aroused. I totally freaked out when i saw it (not in front of him) and i didn't know what to do about it. I want to talk to him about it but i don't know how to approach him. I don't want him to think that he should be embarrassed because of what his body is going through, but i do want him to understand that the video was very wrong. How do i bring up such a topic with a six year old?? Keep in mind that his father is mainly around during the holidays so i don't know if he'd feel comfortable talking to his father about it.
20081029081941AAhLnwd	Pregnancy & Parenting;Pregnancy	Is it my fault or his that I got pregnant?	8 months ago I got pregnant because I ran out of my birth control for two weeks and my husband refused to abstain from sex or even use a condom. I however told him when I ran out and encouraged him to be abstinent with me or use a condom if we were to have sex. He refused to do so or use a condom though he was determined not to have a child. But he says that since I was willing it is my fault to. But he was the one who initiated the sex and had he not I wouldn't have done it. I am also ok with condoms for just two weeks and he is not. So who's fault is it? I always get blamed. By the way I have accepted my pregnancy and am having the baby, this is just an argument that gets brought up.
20081102081635AAtpXPu	Pregnancy & Parenting;Parenting	Am I really the worst mom ever?	I am 20 years old with a 1 year old son, I work and go to school full time. Sometimes I forget things like I might forget to fill the diaper bag with pampers or while he is playing he may bump his on the dresser. Yesterday I went to the mall he threw his hat out the stroller and my grandmother called me the worst mother ever. I cried all day. My mom and grandmother always criticize how i take care of my son, they tell me what clothes to put him on, I dont even let his father take him places cause they think he is irresponsible. I know that some things i don't kknow about babies cause i never was really around them until i had my son, I would not mine if they told me you should do this or that, but they call me stupid and say what would happen if we was not here, They try to control everything. what should i do. I am sick of it
20090116122001AAYVgP6	Pregnancy & Parenting;Newborn & Baby	Can my baby feel me touching her- 32 weeks pregan?	Ok this is probably a silly question but the title asks the question because when she moves, I will follow her with my finger and like move my finger around and she seems to respond by bouncing against it or holding her body(part) against my finger. Is this stupid and I am just imagining or do you ladies experience the same?

20090223143841AAzg8rX	Pregnancy & Parenting;Pregnancy	Do u have to be active to go into labour?!?	Hi, bit of a strange question I know but I'm amost 40 weeks and I've got all pre-labour symptoms and most of the early labour symptoms yet I'm still waiting for full blown labour and have been for a week!  My baby is posterior so could be the reason why (as was my 2nd child).   Like most women towards the end of pregnancy, been waiting for a sign, feeling fed up etc...so tried some natural induction methods like a lot of walking, rocking on birthing ball, nipple stimulation and even sex, which can start off contractions but doesn't last.   So my question is, if I were to rest instead of going for walks every day, would it decrease the chance of me going into labour soon?  Because it's been a long 40 weeks and I'm getting tired now(!) but I'm afraid if I don't at least try to help the start of labour I may go another 2 weeks!!   Thanks xx
20090223140804AAFgOHk	Pregnancy & Parenting;Pregnancy	Can wearing tight clothes during your pregnancy give you pain or make your body hurt? more details...?	I'm 18 weeks pregnant and my whole pregnancy has been going well. This is my 1st pregnancy and are loving every minute of it! Even experiencing my first heartburn, pains in my stomach(that from what I've heard it means that everything is stretching inside)      Well yesterday, I put on a tank top, that's lose from the stomach, but the tank top comes with like a bra(it's those shirts that you don't have to wear a bra) but I still wear one anyway. Well right when I put it I noticed that the bra was very tight, but I ignored it, I was like that the whole day with my family, i didn't really feel anything all day, I even slept in that shirt! So, today I started getting a pain right below my breasts, I had even asked a yahoo question, but when I lifted up the shirt and touched with my hand where the pain was it, i saw the line of the bra from the shirt, could it be that the tight shirt wearing it for one whole day, was the reason that my stomach was hurting from that part? Can tight clothes ever make you feel like that? Thanks.
