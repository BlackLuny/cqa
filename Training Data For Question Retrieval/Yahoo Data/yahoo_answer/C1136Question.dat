20090225030707AA6Yzwq	Beauty & Style;Hair	Should I wear my hair curly or straight for my date?	Alright so early next week I have a date with a guy that I've liked for over a year. He finally told me he liked me and I'm super excited. I have my outfit and makeup picked out already, but I don't know how to style my hair-straight or curly[with a spiral curling iron, not naturally curly]. It looks good either way, but I can't decide. I have naturally wavy, long blonde hair. The last time I saw him my hair was straight but he's also seen it curled. Since its a concert date and my hair holds curl very well, I was thinking I might curl it just so I don't have a chance of humidity ruining it. Oh and I haven't seen him in a long time and I want to make a good impression.         This is sorta of like my top that I picked. The sleeves are a bit shorter and the top has lace on it, but its the same basic idea.    http://www1.macys.com/catalog/product/in...

20090225024241AAAp08t	Beauty & Style;Hair	20 year old Male with a dry scalp/hair problem !?	Hi, I'm 20 years old and ever since I was about 16 my hair started gradually getting more dry and sparse. It started out slowly but as I got older it became more noticable(to myself). At 19, I started losing more hairs and at 20 my hair and scalp is very dry and brittle. My hair has become more sparse, although it is not noticable, but by comparison it feels like 50% of my hair has decreased. When I run my fingers through my hair I can feel a dramatic difference. I used to have a more fuller head of hair and now I feel like it's very spacy. I don't know if I'm balding, and I am lead to believe its not male pattern baldness since my hairloss has been all over eqaully (not the typical male pattern baldness).      Another observation is my hair reacts to certain activities. If I work out (wieghts) I knotice my hair becomes more dry like I just fried it. If I'm in a situation where I'm stressed my hair also becomes fried. Lastly, any sexual activity the same happens.       My hair feels rough, and is stiff. This is making me go crazy. I want normal hair!!!      I've gone and seen a family practioner, and got a blood test and they told me everything was fine?! BUT its not !!?       Who can I see to really get some help?            Can anyone please help !?

I've gotten a tattoo on my foot which I thought was a little touchy to begin with (my feet are about as ugly as they come).  I got the tattoo on Saturday Feb 21st and today (Feb 25) it is more sore than yesterday and is puffy and red in one spot.  I squeezed it this morning and it oozed out black ink.  Everything I've been told from my other tattoos is don't use anything petroleum based but this morning I decided it would be a good idea to at least use some neosporin and a bandage to cover it up so my shoes don't further the problem while I'm at work.  Please don't send me that tattoos are an abomination and that I'm going to hell and I need to pray because I'm just asking for honest help not to be saved.  Thank you.

I prefer skimpy undies like bikini briefs and thongs under my low rise jeans (ok, they are technically girls jeans, but they fit so much better than guys jeans).        anyway, if you saw my thong peeking from my jeans, like when I sit down or something, would you like think I was into dudes instead of girls?      I thought wearing thongs was like OK now - very metro.
20090225051753AABSOrY	Beauty & Style;Fashion & Accessories	Boxers or briefs under low rise jeans?	OK, which do women like better on guys - boxer or briefs.      I wear low rise jeans (actually girls jeans) because they fit better and aren't baggy.  Boxers are too bulky to wear under them, so I usually wear bikini briefs or sometimes thongs.        do you care what type of undies a guy wears?  Personally, I think bikinis and thongs are more comfortable (and cuter) than boxers.      Cheers

20090225055716AAeH2M8	Beauty & Style;Fashion & Accessories	Looking for a ladies watch with multiple alarm function?	I have to take quite a few tablets a day, and I keep forgetting, I'm ok when at work as normal routine helps but once home or at weekends I just totally forget.  I figure the best thing to do is to have some sort of alarm to remind me, the best way would be to find a watch as I always wear a watch and it goes next to me in bed at night, but looking about its hard to find a nice ladies watch with multiple alarm settings, loads available for men but I don't think I'd be too keen to start wearing a big bulky mans watch.  Has anyone got any recommendations?

20090225054903AAlgZHx	Beauty & Style;Other - Beauty & Style	Ear Piercings Problem?	Last June I got my 3rd set of ear piercings (so I already have two, one set on my ear lobe, my 2nd set is a bit above my 1st set of piercings). My third piercing is a bit above my 2nd one, (kind of towards my cartilage but not fully on the cartilage). When I got it, the piercings were extremely sensitive, they were red all the time when my earring were in it and touching the skin around it was a painful throb. I did take care of my earrings the way you are supposed to after getting your ears pierced.      It's now Feb and my these piercings still are giving my problems. If I take out my earrings then they start "closing up" and when I put my earrings back in, I put hydrogen peroxide on the piercings to open them up, I work my earrings into the holes and when I succeed, it is so painful and sometimes my holes bleed whether it is putting the earrings in or taking them out...      I'm not sure what to say or do about this..I partially think the earrings I need for this piercing are causing an allergic reaction...Is it normal to have so many problems with almost-cartiledge piercings? Does it take time for the hole to work into a "permanent state"?

I have somewhat short hair, not quite shoulder length but almost, and it is always kinda frizzy when i air-dry it and it gets weird waves and the ends want to flip up, but only in the back. How should I style it? It is longer in the back than the front by a little bit and I have straight across bangs, just below my eyebrows. I don't want to cut it because i am growing it out and I want something that would be super fast, and if you suggest any products, no too expensive. Thanx :)

Heya i'm going backpacking in about 5 weeks,   i wont have hair straightners OR a hair dryer.   Usually i wouldn't care less cos im going with my mm and shes seen me at my worst lol! but shes the type to take loadsss of pictures and show everyone....      My hair is quite (very) big and i like it like that, but naturally my hair is completley flat to my head, i use hair dryer and straightners to make my hair big.

Then I read this article about a woman getting a terrible rash from her Victoria Secret bra...ugh, nothing is safe anymore!  Anyway, do you wash your bras before wearing?  I always wash my panties before I wear them the first time, but what about bras?  I never thought about it I guess until I read that article...also since you're supposed to hand wash them in cold water...is that getting bacteria off them??  I'm kind of a germ freak and I wouldn't think cold water and letting them air dry would kill bacteria if there's any on them...

20090203141433AAGBw7m	Beauty & Style;Makeup	Has anyone tried a wood glue facial mask!?!?	I was actually reading about wood glue on wikipedia and found this..      Wood glue is also one of the most effective household and industrial products to use as a facial mask. The ingredients it contains are highly beneficial to clarifying and removing dead skin cells, dirt and any other impurities that cause acne. One major benefit is its chemical properties allow it to be used on all skin types. Considering its thick consistency and viscosity, water must by added to dilute the strong bonds in order for it to be pliable and easy to spread over the face. As with all other face masks, it should be left on for no longer than 20 minutes.       Has anyone out there ever tried that? Or thought about it?

20090203135430AADQaFg	Beauty & Style;Makeup	Ladies, will you tell us what does?	My friend and i(from 2 different girls at 2 different times) have gotten slapped by girls. They were too fast for us to block out their hand. But we need your help. They both stood like with their weight on their left side standing with their left hip out, then slapped the crap out of us by flipping back the right hand smack. and it works. Neither one of us knows what works to block that move because we don't know any moves like that before, having seen a girl ever do that. For me, she just stared at me and kinda smiled, like she knew it would work. So, we both need your help. PLEASE tell us how to block that move, what works against that? We both were pretty sure we'd block away a girls hand, but it didn't work.
